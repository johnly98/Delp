Our hope was that given this is a upscale place, the service and food would be amazing; we could not have been more wrong!\n\nI booked a table and mentioned that we are coming to celebrate a birthday. At the restaurant, no one wished my wife and no treats on birthdays. It looked like the front person was very busy and did not read on her computer screen that we are here for a birthday.\n\nWe were seated on a very small table in a sad corner. Drinks and food order was taken, food came but drinks came at least after 30 minutes. A restaurant like this should be providing very good service.\n\nThe food was bad--they took some classic Indian dishes and made a mess out of them. Everything was extra buttery, their nan-bread were like grocery store nans, and the rotis were cold. \n\nOverall, for the money and time we spent on this place, we could have eaten a much better meal at any of the normal Indian restaurants in Bay Area.", "author": "Akshay S."}

I especially loved the Kulcha in the chutney sampler, as it was filled with this delicious mixture of green peas & goat cheese. And the mushrooms, wow.

Came here just for appetizers so we had an order of dahi puri and an order of assorted pappads and crisps. I appreciated the contrasting textures of the thin crispy dahi puri shells and the creamy yogurty and flavorful filling. Definitely a delectable treat and would get again. The pappads were good for a try, but did not stand out enough for me to try again. We ran out of the crisps before we ran out of the chutney. Asking for more crisps is another 5 dollars. \n\nAll in all, I think the flavors for the two dishes I had can be had at many lower end Indian restaurants and as such may not justify the high end price. You are likely paying more for the precisely engineered texture combination of the dahi puris and, of course, the location/ambience.

It's possible that we order too many dishes, but hey, sometimes the food is so good it's hard to say no. Honestly we did order a lot, so much that listing it all out *might* make be a little embarrassed, but I will say that not one dish disappointed and I would be happy to order and eat any of them again. Although I'm also inclined to try some things on the menu we didn't get to.\n\nBeyond the food, the cocktails were on point, and the ordering of them is this interesting wheel of spirits and mixtures.

We ordered mostly vegetarian dishes and the food was fantastic! IMHO it's really hard to get fancy with Indian food and make it taste good, because Indian spices have such strong flavors, but the chef at Rooh did such an excellent job. Classic dishes were modified to make it experimental without compromising on the taste (if anything it tasted better).\n\nThe second time was for a birthday dinner. This time we got more traditional dishes like butter chicken and a chickpea curry and were a little let down. It's not like the food tasted bad, but it was definitely not memorable. The service was excellent and they gave us celebratory dessert on the house (the chocolate cake; which tasted okay) , but after my first experience, I expected the food to taste much better.\n\nI guess it depends on what you order, but if you get it right, it's a great experience.

The food on the other hand, failed to impress.\n\nWe started with the tuna bhel and duck shikampuri, both were solid starts to the meal. For the tuna dish, imagine poke, but mixed with melon, crunchy rice bits, and some spice. The shikampuri packed an even stronger hit of spice while tasty, unfortunately overpowered any duck flavor.\n\nFor our large plate we ordered the tandoori monkfish which can only be summed up as underwhelming. With strong flavors coming from our small plates, I expected the monkfish to deliver on what Indian dishes usually accomplish quite easily - depth in flavor. The fish was a bit tough and over cooked, and the sad \"curry\" that it was sitting in was anything but that; I would instead liken it to lentils in a bland sauce. \n\nFortunately for us we decided to order the milk cake for dessert which was perhaps the best dish of the night.

I decided to be a bit adventurous and try the Patna Fizz, which listed mushroom as an ingredient.

My only challenge is I have to be in the right mood for delicate, and that's not often. The Potato Tikki consisted of a traditional potato patty topped with kale chips, a delightful mousse, and individual raspberry cells (must be so painstaking). I hadn't before seen Paneer in any form but cubes; the pinwheels were good but the dish was mostly the surrounding curry, which was the star. Finally, the bread pudding was more like French toast than bread pudding, but didn't stop me from going at it. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is a bit disjointed - they're clearly going for upscale and sleek but the diners are mostly quite casual even at 7pm on a Saturday (T-shirts, hoodies, sneakers, young kids climbing around). I know it's SF - and SOMA at that - but for such a nice (aka expensive) meal, the experience should match. Casual and inviting is great; the just-rolled-off-the-couch look is not.

So, in terms of flavor, I felt that it was a little muted to be really Indian. The taste seems to be tuned for an audience that does not like lot of spice. \nThe service was good and we were looked after well. \nI gave similar comments on their feedback form and was sorry to see the staff disappointed.", "author": "Tejashree M."}

Gone are the days where Amber India dominated the Indian food scene and any Indian restaurant that makes SF Chronicle's \"Top 100 Restaurants\" List is immediately on my \"To Try\" List.\n\nWe decided to go with the tasting menu option in order to get a full sampling of the menu. My parents decided to get the beverage pairing option as well. I have to say that ironically, the best parts came later in the meal. Normally my experience has been that the appetizers are the stars and the main courses are a little too much.  The pani puri/dahi puri were a little underwhelming. I get the need to make it more exciting in an upscale restaurant but I feel like they could have taken a chapter out of August 1 Five's book and had different \"pani's\" instead of trying to have the same old pani puri. The goat cheese and pea kulcha was also very underwhelming. I wish that they had stuffed it with goat cheese rather than integrate it with the naan batter. It would have provided more flavor.\n\nI was starting to get a little worried at this point but then when the lamb ribs, kebab, and tikki came, I began to feel a little better. They were what you would expect from an upscale Indian restaurant. The monk fish/asparagus were even better and finally the main dishes were out of this world. Everything, especially the beef, was cooked perfectly and was so tasty. Finally the dessert was amazing and finished the meal perfectly.\n\nWe got the raita, daal, saffron rice, garlic naan, and papad to accompany the meal. They were good but nothing extraordinary. The papad however, was extremely well put together; they had different kinds of papads and chutneys, all tasty, and I LOVE papad, so that means something. The wine pairings were also very well put together and I must say that I was impressed.\n\nOverall, this restaurant did not blow me away, but I can at least see how this place has knocked Amber India off the top Indian restaurants in the Bay Area.", "author": "Kunal N."}

I expected more with how much we ended up paying. It was overwhelming and underwhelming for our party of 10. Let me explain. \n\nWhen we arrived at our table, our server offered to get us \"celebratory champagne.\" Really? Right off the bat you want to try and sell us champagne? And then he suggested that we order 8 large plates + \"at least\" 8 small plates to share...and he repeated this three times because he really wanted us to do this.\n\nWe politely declined and ordered 1 large plate each, \nrice and naan to share, and 2 orders of the sample platter. This was more than enough food. The large plates alone would have been perfectly fine so I can't imagine what we would have done with the 8 additional small plates.\n\nFor a server who was pushy about the way we ordered, he and his team had a very slow response to my friend while she had an allergic reaction. They just kept staring at us waiting for a reaction instead of asking her what she needed. Fortunately we acted quick and got her out of there to get a benadryl and epipen. That situation was dramatic and difficult but your staff should have some kind of protocol. \n\nThe up-selling to get you to buy more is a turn off.

The gift card was something of a blessing since we could order generously without worrying too much about the price (which could have been prohibitive otherwise).\n\nWe ordered a cocktail each, three appetisers, two mains and a couple of desserts to share. The cocktails were...unusual. Generally good but certainly on the spicier side. If you don't mind your cocktails tasting more your dinner than usual, it's an experience.\n\nWhile the meat dishes are usually the reason to go to places like Rooh, I really enjoyed the vegetarian dishes we ordered. In particular, the Spiced Chickpea Cake went down well across our table, as did the Grain and Vegetable Pulao (which is quinoa, not rice as you may have expected).\n\nDessert was one hit, one miss (or two misses if you ask my girlfriend). As other reviewers have suggested, the milk cake is worth trying. I loved the tangy, creamy flavour. Others in my group did not (which was great - I got to eat all of it). The rose & rhubarb tart, which is vegan, was really not to our taste - to be point where we unanimously agreed after a bite to send it back.\n\nThe high ceilings and a simple but classy decor made this feel like a proper \"date night\" spot.\n\nService was generally good until a large group came and sat opposite us - at which point our waiter all but disappeared. This was after we'd eaten, but made it take around 20 minutes to get our cheque. Ugh.\n\nIndian fusion is always a bit variable, and that certainly seemed to be the case here.

The decor is nice and I love the mixture of colors and prints. Their lunch menu is pretty good, it has a good collection of individual meals which are complete on its own. I was confused between the vegetarian platter (more like an indian thali) and the cauliflower 65 (which was a combination of south indian flavors). The server suggested other than the thali the other portions are small so I got the thali.\n\nThe service was quick and nice so thats a plus. We got some drinks (the chennai colada--delicious and pink lady--good). The food was a bit too rich for my taste. It did feel like a bit main stream indian food at any other restaurant with a super rich and creamy paneer curry. I would have liked lighter accompiments but they were heavy too (dal makhni, avocado boondi raita, chole, saffron rice and naan). I would have liked some freshness like a salad, veggies or something to break the butteriness and fattiness. The naan was cooked well and was my favorite. The daal was good too. The methi malai paneer (the main element of the thali) was ok. The paneer was not the softest however I was super impressed with how smooth the curry was. The avocado raita was a nice twist. I could have done without the chole and the richness in the rice.\n\nThe chicken thali was the same with just chicken pieces instead of paneer. I did not expect a restaurant of their calibre to use the same curry for two such similar dishes.\n\nI would visit again because the other menu items did sound interesting and they did have a good cocktail menu which I couldnt try. I would recommend getting smaller portions maybe and trying 2-3 things than getting the platter/thali. As of today, not super impressed!", "author": "Anuja K."}

I went with a friend so we were able to try most of the dishes. The service was very attentive, maybe too much do since they were very quick to take away empty dishes, and my friend said it seemed like they were watching us to see when we were done so they could clear out the dishes. They were very good at giving us new utensils when we had a new dish and if we looked like we needed help, they were very good at coming over and seeing if we needed something. They also refilled our water quickly and we were able to get our check quickly...\nService: (5/5)\nBathroom: \nThere were only two unisex bathrooms but they were clean. (5/5)\n\nFood: (4/5)\n5 course menu - $65/person\n\nCanapes\n- Pani Puri - spiced passion fruit water, avocado, tamarind\nWe only got one set of two pieces for two tasting menus. Not sure if that's how it goes or if we were supposed to get a total of four pieces. It was refreshing with the burst of flavor once you bit into it. Didn't really taste the avocado, but it was predominately sour with a nice crunch (3.5/5)\n\nFirst Course\n- Green Peas & Goat Cheese Kulcha, winter truffle - \nBefore trying this, I never knew what a kulcha was, but apparently it's like a type of naan. Well, this one was quite tasty with the mix of spices, spicy peas and Goat cheese. Usually, I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but it didn't have a strong cheese flavor. The only thing to complain about was that I wish there was more filling and it was more spread out through the kulcha... (4/5)\n\nSecond Course\n- Potato Tikki - kale and spinach tempura, sweet and sour mousse, raspberry\nThis was THE best dish out of the whole menu. The crispy kale and spinach mixed with the mousse was nice a great blend of crunch, and sweetness. I would definitely come back here just for this dish!! (5/5)\n\n- Duck Shikampuri - spiced Huckleberry chutney, pickled radish\nTwo small round ground duck patties with a small piece of radish. The chutney provided a nice sweetness to the more spiced patties. (3.5/5)\n\nThird Course\n- Asparagus Pepper Fry - Podi Masala, spiced cauliflower mousse\nThere really is nothing special about this dish - just average and nothing to write home about. Just some asparagus with some slight pepper flavoring... (3/5)\n\n- Achari Monkfish - Amaranth Pongal with lemon foam\nThe lemon foam really didn't do anything to the dish, but the fish was tasty, the sauce was pretty good and the Amaranth (like a type of rice cereal) mixed with the sauce was good as well. It provided a different texture. (3.5/5)\n\nMain Course\n- Traditional Butter Chicken - red pepper makhani, fenugreek, butter powder\nI was looking forward to this dish, but unfortunately, it was too salty, although the chicken was tender. (2.75/5)\n\n- Beef Short Ribs Curry - baby turnip, rawa & marrow kofta\nThe short rib was very tender and reminded me of oxtail meat. It's too bad that there really was like only one piece of rib meat. The sauce which tasted like chicken tiki marsala sauce went wonderfully with the rib meat and the rawa (like a mashed potato texture) went well with the sauce as well. In fact, I used up all of my garlic naan in this sauce. The kofta/balled up meat ball was also nicely spiced. (4.5/5)\n\nAccompaniment (you can choose one)\n- Garlic Naan - \nNot that much garlic flavor and it wasn't piping hot when we got it, but still good for dipping into the rib sauce. (3.5/5)\n\nDesserts\n- Carrot Hawla cake - pistachio kulfi, raisin gel, milk skin crisp\nThis didn't really taste like a carrot cake. One corner of my cake was a bit too baked and was very crispy. The crisp kind of tastes like a waffle cookie, except crispier. The gel provided a bit more sweetness and the kulfi provided a nice different texture. The cake wasn't too sweet.

Everything else was just kind of there and not memorable. Everything had very familiar Indian flavors, but each dish usually had a \"California\" element thrown in.  For example, the bhel puri had tuna, the pulao was made of grains instead of rice, the potato tikki had kale, and there was plenty of avocado thrown in.\n\nWhile the California concept was interesting, I'm not sure it really added anything to the food.  For me, what shone through was the Indian flavors and not the California additions.

Fortunately, Rooh exceeded all expectations and truly earned its 5 stars. \nMy wife and I came in about 30 minutes early for our reservation and were okay with going to the bar, but our table was ready! We ordered a drink- I had the berry shikanji, which was just okay, and she had the Kerala, which was good but a little sweet. Our friends came and we started with the chutney sampler, which came with a sweet tomato based chutney, a green chutney, and a traditional chutney- all of which were fantastic. I also had the whiskey drink that came with a curry leaf (I forget the name) and my wife had the pink one, which was perfect. \nFor small plates, we shared the scallop, the cauliflower, the pork belly, and the burrata. The scallop was perfectly cooked and the sauce was fantastic. The cauliflower was a take on Manchurian and was just different enough than the original to be unique. The burrata was good, but nothing too special- same with the pork belly, which was a little sweet.\nFor dinner, I had the tandoori monkfish, my wife had the paneer pinwheels, our friends had the seabass and the jackfruit dumplings, respectively. The tandoori monkfish was fantastic, it's been years since I had monkfish and it did not disappoint. The paneer pinwheels came in a makhani type sauce that's probably the best I've had, ever. The jackfruit came in a similar sauce.\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate pave and the carrot halwa, which was more like a carrot cake that was sumptuous. The ice cream that came with it was dense, a little more like a kulfi and heavily cardamom-flavored. The pave was good, too.\n\nService was a *little* rushed, as I'm sure they were trying to turn the table, but overall was really good.

Really, that's all I want to know!!\n\nAll kidding aside had an awesome lunch at ROOH recently. It was a special occasion and of course, we had to celebrate in the city. ROOH was at the top of our list of restaurants to try and it was a complete success! There was plenty of metered street parking, the restaurant's ambiance was modern and lively, and customer service was on point from start to finish (shout out to Ashley!!).\n\nTheir lunch menu is much shorter than dinner, but there were still a lot of dishes to choose from. And honestly, if I wasn't afraid to \"mix\" I probably would've had a ball trying a number of cocktails from their drinks menu (but limited myself to 2).\n\nAside from drinks, we shared everything...\n\nNon-vegetarian platter | An absolute must have! The only difference between this and the vegetarian version is 1 dish, the chicken cooked in onion, where the vegetarian platter serves paneer cooked in onion instead. The platter was a healthy serving of various dishes mainly to be eaten with rice or naan. I was completely blown away by the yellow dal! Just absolute heaven! I almost didn't want to share anymore.\n\nChicken 65 | A spicy chicken dish served with sour cream and dolled up with thinly sliced radish and micro greens. The chicken was tender and reminded me of grilled chicken nuggets in sauce (but the prettier, fancier type). Make sure to have a bite with the sour cream to cool things down.\n\nTutti Frutti Cassata | A soft creamy cake garnished with strawberries and blood orange compote (sauce) and little chunks of sweet honey comb(?). Light and a little tart. Sorry, we got carried away and forgot to snap a picture.\n\nI would come back just for the yellow dal and will HAVE TO give dinner a try next time.

The server was eager to recommend his favorite dishes and very friendly.\n\nWe started out by ordering cocktails after a chef at Frontier Space in Pleasanton recommended Rooh for just that. I ordered the Filter Kafi cocktail and just LOVED it. I didn't get much of the coffee flavoring, but it was loaded with cardamom and spices and placed a unique Indian spin on a vodka-based cocktail. My friend got the Chai Punch which was also delicious, with hints of Assam tea. I love how their cocktail menu breaks down cocktails based on flavor profile: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, etc. Very innovative here.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Lamb Keema small plate as an appetizer and the Butter Chicken as our main. \n\nLamb Keema: The Keema was simply outstanding! It was flavored so so well, and a perfectly rich testament to the Keema we make at home, with the minced lamb cooked really well. I would highly highly recommend this dish and it was also sizeable for an appetizer. I will be dreaming about this one - easily the best Keema I've ever had. \n\nButter Chicken: We were apprehensive ordering Butter Chicken because it's just such a standard dish normally, and we wondered how Rooh specifically would elevate it. But, it was really good and frankly I found it less creamy than at other Indian restaurants with still loads of flavor packed in. This is an easy dish to love. Most places serve it with really dry chicken, hoping the cream and gravy will balance it out. But at Rooh, the chicken in this dish was moist and perfectly cooked and so while there wasn't an added flare, it is still a very solid Butter Chicken.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Rooh and try more of their dishes and cocktails!", "author": "Sabina S."}

We ordered the cauliflower appetizer and she gave us chicken.  I'm a new vegetarian, but I would feel bad for those that are die hard.  Instead of apologizing or bringing us the right order, she just said we had too much food already so probably didn't need the cauliflower right?

We went for the happy hour to give the place a try before plunging into a full fledged dinner. Being an Indian, I'm always looking for a burst of flavors in my food and believe me it is difficult to make bland indian food. But the place managed to do just that. Everything we had lacked flavors and the portions were extremely small. Also, as the happy hour menu was very limited, we ended up ordering from the regular menu, but all 3 dishes failed to impress. The less I say about the drinks the better. They were watered down and the place is trying too hard to infuse an Indian touch in their drinks. It's not modern Indian food, it's tasteless food which had an Indian look to it.\n\nLastly about the service, so that's what led to the merger 2 stars. Most of the times people coming in for happy hour are generally trying the place and deciding if they'd like to come back and if they get bad service at that time, you've lost future customers. So I'd definitely want to urge the bartender and the other service staff to not treat hh customers like second grade, because nothing irritates customers more than bad service. Also, you ask before you pick someone's plate. They picked up my plate while I was still eating out of it and when I asked them to give me some extra chutney they charged me for it.

Going up in a great foodie family, I am particularly severe on Indian restaurants. Either they tend to be nice and simple South Indian cooking, or the usual North Indian greasy fare. Its hard for them to be special and make a mark.\n\nFrom that perspective, Rooh just blew us away. The food was exotic while straying not far from its Indian roots. We went in for brunch on a Saturday with moderate expectations. CC, the waiter was very attentive, moved us from a drafty corner to a nice place. She recommended the cauliflower koliwada as a starter. We also ordered the Salli Par Eedu. While the Salli Par Eedu was fairly middle of the road, the cauliflower koliwada was an outstanding dish. Never enjoyed cauliflower that much! \n\nThe main dishes were Green Pea and Goat Cheese Kulcha. This was executed well. It came with an accompaniment of Choley which reminded of the exact same thing my Mom made. The desserts simply blew us away. We had a chance to spend time with Chef Pujan Sarkar who was kind enough to talk to us and treated us to a dessert sampler.\n\nThe Phirni Mousse Cashew Cake with the Thandai Ice Cream, followed by Spiced Chocolate Pave with Salted jaggery Ice Cream were simply to die for. Each one was specially hand made by the Chef after we placed the order. We finally had a chance to try the bomb \"Fermented Turmeric Sorbet\", molecular gastronomy without straying from its Indian roots. Truly a work of art!\n\nMark my words, Pujan Sarkar is going to be a superstar amongst Indian Chefs.

For our mains, we got the aubergines with some naan, a stuffed eggplant curry dish, heavily loaded with peanuts. The stuffing and the curry were both rather spicy, and I probably will not be getting it again. A MUST have is the garlic and avocado raita- I cannot describe how wonderful the creamy yoghurt in it is! \n\nFor dessert, we got the Malai Tart- creamy, crumbly, spiced deliciousness. \n\nThe service was very good as well. All in all, I cannot wait to go back!", "author": "Surashree K."}

I arrived on Wednesday, April 26th around 6:30pm. The majority of our group was already there, so they managed to grab two tables in the bar area. We ended up being a party of around 8, so we also had a few seats at the bar.\n\n*CHUTNEY SAMPLER: with Garlic Naan, Green Pea & Goat Cheese Kulcha, Avocado & Yogurt, Chili & Peanut, Tomatillo & Green Mango ($12)\n*TUNA BHEL: Avocado, Tamarind Gel, Puffed Black Rice, Baby Radish, Togarashi ($15)\n*CHICKEN 65: Onion Uttapam, Sour Cream, Peanut Chutney, Podi Masala ($15)\n*PORK BELLY: Sweet & Sour Mango Achar, Masala Cracklings, Green Onion ($15)\n*Mustard Old Fashioned: Four Roses Whiskey, Mustard & Ghee Wash, Aromatic Bitters, Honey ($13)\n*Oban 14 year ($18)\n\nI was actually going to order the mustard old fashioned, but when everyone in my group said it was way too sweet, I ended up refraining. I think everyone said the honey overpowered everything. Instead, I just got an Oban 14. It was an average pour and priced normal for a higher end restaurant. In general, I thought the scotch whisky section of their spirits list was on the pricier side. I didn't try any of the food, but everyone who ate seemed to enjoy the dishes.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice, though I found the bar area a little cramped. Our tables were super close to the bar seating. I could sit at the bar and feel like it was still part of our party. Service was great. The servers were very attentive and nice. And they kept water coming which I appreciated.\n\nI'd love to come back to take advantage of their happy hour specials. Until then, 3 stars for now.", "author": "Elena N."}

At 8:15, they said 2-3 minutes. At 8:30, they said as soon as a minute. At 8:45, the manager finally said \"it will take atleast 5 minutes and we dont know how long\". We had to leave without food, luckily I had leftovers at home. The only person who showed some respect to our time was a waitress (not our waiter) who said \"please dont give up on us, it has been a rough day at work and it wont happen again\". \n\nTo add insult to injury, they marked us as \"table for 6\" and added 20% gratuity. We were a table of four. I think I might give up on this place.

However, the butter chicken, which consisted of 3 measly pieces of chicken, certainly isn't worth the $26 price tag (and of course you need to add the $5-$8 nan and then you are in the $30+ range for this plate). I'd recommend getting an assortment of small plates instead, priced reasonably at $12-15, and for me, always end up tasting better and more interesting than main dishes. Definitely get the tuna bhel--it is a well balanced dish in both taste and texture. Potato tiki was beautiful and tasty. Skip the tasting platter -- as you can see the sausage have shrunk quite a bit since the opening.\n\nHow they price the menu confuses me--for whatever reason, the same plate would cost $15 during dinner but $16 for happy hour?? Now that certainly does not make me happy. \n\nWith the too-constant water refills (I know, first world problems) and sometimes awkward service, the staff needs more training for this truly to be a fine dining destination.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

We came here for SF Restaurant Week and thoroughly enjoyed the creative artistry and inventive flavor combinations that went into the 5-course meal.  \n\nPani Puri\nNotes: Exciting introduction to the meal.  The pop of tangy flavors from the spiced passionfruit water and tamarind were complemented nicely by the light, crisp puri.  \n\nCourse 1: Spiced Lentil Kulcha (we had this as an alternative to the Green Peas and Goat Cheese Kulcha option):\nNotes: Great level of spice in the lentils and soft flavorful bread topped with winter truffle shavings.  Presentation was underwhelming but this was not an issue since the flavors were great.\n\nCourse 2: Potato Tikki\nNotes: Flavors and textures of this dish were incredible.  The lightness of the crispy spinach and kale tempura couples nicely with the dense aloo tikki.  The addition of the creamy sweet and sour yogurt mousse and playfully scattered raspberry bits completed the dish.  \n\n\nCourse 3: Achari Monk Fish\nNotes: Mildly spiced, coconut curry sauce paired incredibly well with the perfectly cooked monk fish (which had a tasty tandoori flavor).  The lemon foam added a nice cloud of zest to the dish.\n\nCourse 4: Traditional Butter Chicken\nNotes: Chicken was beautifully cooked and perfectly moist.  The red pepper butter sauce was absolutely delectable.\n\nCourse 5: Masala Chai and Chocolate Pave\nNotes: Intricate dish with an artistic presentation and intriguing flavors.  Masala chai flavor was not readily detectable; nevertheless, the combination of creamy, mousse-like chocolate, the splash of citrus provided by the orange murabba, the chocolate bits, and the ice cream made for a satisfying dessert.\n\nSide: Garlic Naan\nNotes: This dish tasted more like plain naan rather than garlic naan.  The bread itself was great but the lack of a prominent garlic flavor was somewhat disappointing. \n\nAlso, I wish they served masala chai at dinner--it would have gone nicely with the dessert (we were told that it is only available during lunch).\n\nOverall, this was a delightful dining experience.  The restaurant itself is trendy and eye-catching with the pop of electric blues, orange curtains, and colorful pillows.  Instrumental world music plays overhead, which helps to create a lively, lounge-like ambiance.  Service ran smoothly like a well-oiled machine (we were tended to by 7 different members of the staff who were attentive and maintained a nice pace with the courses).

I came here with my friend because I won an Instagram giveaway for a dinner at ROOH for the special Diwali menu on 10/21/17. An amazing experience where my tongue was able to venture in zones I had never before seen. Everything was well spiced and flavored, and the sauces felt so life-changing!\n\nDranks/menu descriptions:\n- Delhi 6 [wild turkey, rose shrub, elderflower, roohafza]: I really enjoyed this drink because it tasted like my favorite Taiwanese sour plums (\u9178\u6885). LOL It was weird having it in liquid form though, but very nicely balanced sweetness and tartness in this drink.\n- Raspberry Shikanji [appleton estate rum, fresh raspberry, herbsutra]: Nice and safe choice because some of the other stuff on the cocktail menu look quite adventurous. Can't go wrong with raspberry.\n\nWhat was eaten/menu descriptions:\n- Dahi Puri [sweet & sour yogurt, avocado, tamarind gel]: honestly one of my favorites because the sweet & sour yogurt was so light yet subtle-ly flavorful\n-Beetroot & Goat Cheese Chop (Croquette) [peanut, lemon, sour cream]: I didn't even notice that goat cheese was used, so it was great (I detest the strong goat cheese taste). Loved the crunchiness! Another solid starter.\n-Tuna Bhel [avocado, tamarind gel, puffed black rice, green mango]: I loved the sauce in this one, and it was such a refreshing plate. Felt like I was eating an ahi salad, but with nice crunchy puffs.\n-Duck Shikampuri [spiced huckleberry chutney, pickled radish]: I loved the presentation of this dish! The pickles as flower petals were a nice aesthetic touch. The duck mousse was delicious, especially with the huckleberry chutney -- which was the best part of the dish. I basically licked the chutney clean off the plate! Wish I could take home a jar of this!\n-Cauliflower Koliwada [onion uttapam, wasabi sour cream, pickled ginger]: Another one of the highlights of this meal! The flavors in this one were definitely stronger than in other dishes, but if I recall correctly, I tasted all the colors of the rainbow~. The spiciness not at all apparent when you first take a bite, definitely lingers on in the aftertaste. Ugh, 10/10. The uttapam was crispy and relatively thin, and it helped pulled the whole dish together nicely. \n-Anchari Lobster [curd rice mousse, sous-vide mango pickle]: Another nicely flavored course.\n-Tandoori Monk Fish [alleppey curry, kadumbuttu (rice dumpling)]: Yums!\n-Beef Short Ribs Curry [baby turnip, rawa & marrow kofta, baby turnip]: Loved it! If I hadn't known this was beef, I may have thought it was pork belly! The beef was falling apart tender and melts in your mouth type of fatty. Good stuff. Curry was excellent. \n-Garlic Naan: The garlic was very subtle. I loved how it was displayed nicely in a box. Fluffy and nicely baked!\n-Saffron Rice: Yesss. It went well with my beef curry. I should start putting herbs in my rice now.\n-Saffron Malai Tart [burnt butter kurchan, gold leaf]: HOLY MOLY. THIS DESSERT WAS SUCH AESTHETICS. SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL, AND ALSO VERY DELICIOUS. NO WORDS.\n-Masala Chai Chocolate Pave [mango sorbet, hazelnut chikki]: ALSO VERY DELICIOUS. The spiced chocolate was interesting, compared to the usual non-spiced chocolate.\n\nOverall, the service is fantastic, and the concept is innovative and feels very trendy. I love how this place is perfect for a casual night out with friends, but it can also be a destination for a nice, classy dinner date. I am now so very inspired to play around with spices and fail at recreating these dishes (which I will probably not attempt).

Experience overall was wonderful, but let me preface this by saying this is definitely a \"treat yo self\" type of place. They were only offering the pre-fixe menu in the evening, which was $90 per person ($55 additional if you added the wine pairings). We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Overall ambiance was clean, modern, and Indian with a twist, so to speak. We noticed overall that the crowd was a bit older  for SOMA, so probably wouldn't be here for a night out. Service was fantastic, and both the hostess and servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars primarily because you spend a lot of money for not a lot of food. Everything was delicious and plated beautifully. We had the lobster and spare rib as our mains. Dessert left something to be desired (it was a tiny piece of Chai chocolate cake). Food has Indian inspirations but is neither here nor there in terms of origin - which I imagine is part of the appeal and creativity. Everything was tasty, albeit tiny. I ordered a \"Love Potion\" cocktail special they had that night, which was my favorite part of the meal. It was a gorgeous red color with a hint of sage. When it was all said and done we had each walked out spending $140, happy that we treated ourselves for the occasion.\n\nI would to back in future for cocktails or to take a look at their regular menu.

Not that I'm speaking from experience or anything...\n\nIt seems Rooh is trying to be the Indian Hakkasan serving \"progressive\" Indian food in a nightclub atmosphere. Except Rooh was a total miss with most items not translating well on the plate and service was frustratingly amateur for a large restaurant group (http://goodtimesrestaurants.com/). \n\nI've been to newcomers August 1 Five and Babu Ji (also serve contemporary Indian cuisine) and while they're both not perfect, Rooh was by far theeeee worst of the three. \n\nI enjoyed my Mango Mule ($13): http://bit.ly/2lYfI1q. Not much mango flavor but it gave me a good buzz. Ugh, that dizzying cocktail menu though: http://bit.ly/2lMvV9m! Having to spin the phuckin paper wheel in the dark and trying to decipher all the letters at different angles was exasperating. \n\nAs for the food:\n\n*Potato Tikki w/ kale + spinach tempura, yogurt mousse, raspberry ($12) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2lrcKPM\nA fav of the night, the app was like a potato cake chaat with creamy yogurt and a tangy chutney.

The taftan was good though. \n\n*Crispy Lamb Ribs w/ apricot & chili marmalade, horseradish cream ($15) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2mCTTl5\nReally tender with crispy edges but it was severely underseasoned. The accompanying sauces combined tasted like sweet cream.\n\n*Pork Belly w/ tandoor smoked bbq sauce, pickled radish, pork crackling ($15) - 2 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2mCNA0O\nLike boiled pork chunks (very lean) drowned in a commercial American BBQ sauce. \n\n*Traditional Butter Chicken w/ makhani, fenugreek, butter powder ($26) - 2 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2m2RQdh\nVery unappetizing medicinal, bitter aftertaste. This is coming from a fernet drinker. \n\n*Naan ($8) - 3 STARS \nStandard naan that you can get anywhere else for $2.

But, it was really sweet. \n\nThe staff was polite and our server was nice (and doing her best) but service was unbelievably and frustratingly amateur. \n\nWe arrived early for our reservations. We were told our table was not ready and the customers before us were paying their bill. No problem but then they tried to sit us in the bar area. Uhhh, what happened to the table that was paying? We declined the bar area and eventually was seated at a two top...after several parties who arrived after us were seated first (they appeared to be friends of the staff). \n\n1st round of drinks took nearly 30 minutes. For the 2nd round, I cancelled my order after 25+ minutes of waiting. \n\nGiven the mixed reviews, we wanted to order apps first to gauge how they were before blowing $60+ on two entrees but our server was vehemently insistent that we order EVERYTHING at once. Obviously this strange request is from management but it was irritating going back and forth about it. She finally agreed to let us order apps and see how we feel afterwards. Ten minutes later, all the apps came flying to our table and before we could even take our first bite of food, we were asked again, what we wanted for our entrees. Aye! \n\nEmpty plates weren't cleared so when our shared entree came, there was no room to put it. As they took the entree back to the kitchen, we quickly stacked our empty plates to make room and waited...and waited. The same entree returned 20+ minutes later.\n\nBusboys later tried to remove plates with food on it (even after I told them we're still working on it). They would pass our table several times, look at my empty water glass but wouldn't refill it. I had to chase down someone for a refill. For everyone's sake, please use larger water glasses! \n\nTrendy, nightclub atmosphere with loud music. Not recommended for a quiet date. \n\nBeware: parking meters run to 10 pm! \n\nI usually don't like to give less than 3 stars for new restaurants but at $80-$100 pp, it's hard to overlook so many missteps from an experienced restaurant group. Not to mention ALL the suspect 5 star reviews (20+ have already been filtered) particularly ones about the Michelin star potential are very misleading to paying consumers who are spending their hard earned money here. \n\nNot cool, Rooh. \n\nWhy not let the food speak for itself? \n\nNever mind, that's a rhetorical question.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Rooh just opened a few days ago, so perhaps they will sort out their issues in a few months.\n\nWe had reservations for dinner at 7pm and were promptly seated. The interior has a very modern hipster vibe and is very tastefully done.  However, the space between our table and the table behind us was much too small - with my chair and the chair of the person sitting behind me practically touching. We had to scoot our chairs uncomfortably close to the table in order to allow other diners and the waitstaff to access the tables next to us. It was very annoying having to eat with my table wedged against my abdomen for most of the night.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and she apologized profusely and repeatedly throughout the night as our dinner dragged on.\n\nFor starters, I ordered the Goan chorizo Scotch egg, and my dining companions had the burrata and chicken malai tikka. The Scotch egg was quite tasty and paired well with our fancy cocktails. I had a Raspberry Shikanji which was quite nice. The appetizers and the cocktails came out pretty quickly and everything was fine so far, except for the annoyance with the chairs.\n\nAfter we finished up the starters, everything seemed to degenerate. We waited a very long time for the entrees to arrive - about 30 minutes from the time our appetizer plates were cleared until the entrees were served. Our waitress appeared a few times during the wait and apologized for the delay. When the entrees did arrive, one of them was incorrect - and had to be sent back to the kitchen. We received a complimentary order of butter chicken with the chef's apologies - however the person with the incorrect order was vegetarian, so she wasn't able to eat it anyway.\n\nAfter awkwardly waiting for the messed up order to brought to the table, most of our party decided to start eating, lest everything gets cold. I had the Beef Short ribs curry, which is the most expensive item under the LARGE PLATES section of the menu - it was definitely not a large plate - it was not even a medium plate.  All of the appetizers that we had earlier that were listed as \"Small Plates\" were larger than this supposedly \"Large Plate\" short rib. Although entree is titled \"Beef Short RIBS curry\" - it could not have been more than 1 rib, so calling it short RIBS is misleading.\n\nAlthough the portion size was very small - it was actually quite tasty. My companions also enjoyed their entrees and wanted some more naan to mop up the sauces, so we ordered another naan for the table.\n\nMeanwhile, the messed up order still hasn't been served, and lone vegetarian in the party was still waiting. Although most of the group waited to start eating, and we ate very slowly, we all finished our entrees and also polished off the complimentary butter chicken before she was served.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after everyone else finished their entrees, the messed up order was finally served.  She had ordered the Tandoori Portobello, but without parmesan cheese, since she has an aversion to cheese. (The original order was served topped with parmesan). The mushrooms seem to taste OK, but it was a little weird since everyone had already finished eating.\n\nMeanwhile, the extra naan that we ordered still hasn't arrived. Even long after the lone vegetarian finished her messed up order, the naan still hadn't shown up. We had wanted to mop up the curry sauce with the naan, and everything was cold, and the sauces were congealing there was still no naan. Our waitress gave us status updates about our naan every 5 minutes or so, saying that she'll be back with the naan in just a little bit, but still no naan. \n\nThe other waitstaff offered to clear our table a few times, since it appeared that we were done, but we explained each time that we were waiting for a naan to mop up the sauces.\n\nFinally, about 30 minutes after the vegetarian had finished her entree, this elusive naan was finally delivered to the table. The naan was nice and crisp, and the cold curry sauce actually tasted pretty good with the naan.  Even though I had finished about 40 minutes earlier, I was still a little hungry (The single short rib didn't really fill me up) so it tasted pretty good.\n\nWe were offered a complimentary dessert because of our ordeal, and we initially wanted to get the Banana Tarte Tatin, but were warned that \"it would take awhile\" to prepare. We had already been there for more than 2 hours, so we were not in the mood for waiting any longer, so we got a chocolate cake, which was fine, and only took 10 more minutes to arrive.\n\nWe finally got out just before 9:30pm, after arriving at 7pm. It was very pricey, very drawn out, and I was still a bit hungry and actually kind of mad by the end of the dinner, hence the 1 star review.  Our waitress was very friendly and apologized several times throughout the dinner, and the food itself tasted pretty good, but the overall experience was terrible.", "author": "Allen T."}

The netting had a lot of give, which was unexpected and pleasant.\n- Naan + Chutney sampler was _delicious_. The spicy red, hummus-textured chutney was my favorite.\n- The cauliflower appetizer was delicious as well.\n- The little duck-cake appetizer was less interesting. The texture was a little crumbly and the flavor a little bland -- as if the chef was not sure whether to really base it on duck-meat or on bread, and the result is an awkward in-between. It did come with a really tasty dash of black marmalade though.\n- I had the lamb shank for the main dish, which came in a bed of delicious sauce. The meat was very tender and peeled easily off the bone. It was good, though honestly not among the best lamb shanks I've had -- to compete there, it would've had to be more flavorful or more strongly spiced. This meat was a little mild/unremarkable in flavor. It did not come with any rice, which was probably a good thing -- that would've been too much.\n- I had the Greek Fizz soda for a drink, which was all right, though a little too much on the sweet side.", "author": "John L."}

They even let you transfer tabs which is rare I find. \n\nThe table/food service while attentive at times was rather uneven. Bar got confused and sent the same drink I had at the bar again to the table. Then they forgot to give us our naan by the end of the meal and we had to ask.

This high end cocktail lounge and with indian food is located around the corner from AT&T park and is a .8 mile walk from BART.\n\nThis place is often packed to I highly recommend a reservation!  My boyfriend and I came here on our one year anniversary on a Monday night and they could barely squeeze us in somewhere that wasn't the bar!  We were very grateful they did, even though our table wasn't the most ideal in the back on the way to the restroom.  The issue was the hideous wall we were sitting next to, as I personally liked being away from the noise and action.  \n\nWe decided to enjoy our evening by ordering one tapas/small dish at a time and judged along the way how much we needed.  Our waiter was very accommodating to our ordering style.  We started with cocktails, I got the Raspberry one that was good but I kept getting seeds stuck in my straw and my boyfriend got the old fashion, which was excellent.  My previous visit here for a drink I got the Chia cocktail out of the tea cup, that I highly recommend.\n\nOur first dish was the chutney sampler.  It comes with three chutneys ranging from sweet to creamy to savory and two pieces of naan cut in half.  There was more chutney than naan and I wish they gave more.  Next we had the Chicken 65, our favorite dish of the night.  It was decent size for a small plate and packed a punch full of flavor and spice which built over time.  Third was the Lamb ribs that literally fell off the bone.  Although they were cooked beautifully it was a dainty portion to split.  At this point we ran out of our first cocktails and I wanted a glass of wine and my boyfriend wanted a beer.  We reminded our waiter twice for a menu to look at for drinks, placed our order of drinks and he had to come back to be reminded of mine.  We didn't receive our drinks for about half an hour after that.  We finished with the tuna dish that was light and very refreshing.  In hindsight we would have ordered in a different order to complement the dishes better but all were tasty.  We received our last drinks after our final dish, which was somewhat frustrating but our waiter apologized and explained it was unacceptable.  With this apology I thought we might see it reflected on our bill, however we were still charged for our overly late and forgotten about drinks.  \n\nAll and all the food is excellent however the portion leaves a bit to be desired for the price point.

Having a party of 6, the table was pretty small which seemed more appropriate for a party of 4 at max. \n\nThe service was damn slow, order was served inaccurately, and servers were inattentive.

We have a daughter with many food allergies so I called Rooh to check if they could accommodate her.  Our daughter has allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy, and wheat.  The manager on the phone said no problem and the kitchen would make sure no cross contamination occurs.  I was skeptical only because most restaurants couldn't do this.  This reservation was to celebrate my wife's birthday, and she loves Indian cuisine.  We arrived, and the manager remembered my phone conversation, read the notes from OpenTable, and had the chef come out and explain that the kitchen created an allergy-free zone as well as a dedicated server just for my daughter's food.  This treatment is beyond our expectations!  After all of this, they remembered my wife's birthday and gave us each free dessert!  The food was amazing.  It's a modern take on Indian cuisine.  The flavors are very pronounced, but not overbearing with heat from the spices.  My daughter had a special melon and tuna salad, Beef rib - rice - veggies and a mint coconut sorbet with strawberry jelly.  She was over the moon.  It was the most flavorful meal she has ever had!  We loved the Paneer Chili Roll, Potato Doughnut Tikki, Traditional Butter Chicken, Lamb Shank, and Lobster.  Yummy.  Thank you so much to the team at Rooh, the service, Chef Sarkar, and the staff.

I've been to quite a few expensive Indian restaurants but this one takes the trophy. \nI took my husband here for his birthday and we ordered the chutney sampler and beetroot Murabba for appetizers. The chutneys were good but the naans were amazing. I've never even heard of beetroot murabba, we were very curious and the end result was really good. For main course we got the paneer pinwheel and grain pulao. My husband is a true paneer lover and he is very serious about his paneer (lol) He just loved this dish! even though he was satiated, he kept eating it. I ordered grain pulao and it was pretty amazing, starting from the presentation to taste. They give you a side of peanut chutney and avocado raita which was a good compliment to the pulao. \nFor the dessert we got carrot halwa and it was good too! \nTIP: If its a special occasion let the host/hostess know and they will get you a dessert for free :) \n\nCocktail menu is pretty interesting. Wine was not really good, I got the rose. I don't think they store their wines well. \nAll in all must go place!!", "author": "Vijeyta S."}

As in the case with many \"fusion\" places I feel like the core element of the cuisine is often lost. So don't come here for a \"curry\". (Not that we did) We tried a bunch of different dishes, maybe 8-10. I don't remember. Nothing was bad, but nothing was amazing either, and really the only thing to stick out in my mind was the side potatoes and cumin, this was really nice.

This place is yummy!\n\nI made dinner reservations for 6:15 on a weeknight and had some time to kill so I came early and checked out their happy hour (4-6pm) decent menu with some good options. I would come next time and have their drinks! Fairly priced. We were deciding between doing the tasting menu or sharing a bunch of plates. I think at the end the pricing came out to be somewhat the same. We ended up ordering a bunch of small and large plates to share. For the most part it was a lovely time and i'm excited to come back! Food and service reviews below. \n\nFood- \nHappy Hour dish - I had the chutney sampler, the naan garlic bread with the peas/goat cheese was soft, warm, and delicious. It came out with three different types of spread - all amazing. the tomatillo and green mango was my favorite with a bit of spice kick. The avocado/yogurt was also really good as well as the chili & peanut \n\nHappy Hour dish Prawn sausage  - comes in 3 quantity was also very very good. super flavorful and spices were on point. \n\nDinner -\n\nMy friends and I decided to share. This place is definitely family style (without the portions being family style if that makes sense) here's what we had: \n\nJhalmuri Bar - not what we expected. the texture is pretty hard so I would break it apart first then share. It was the only non creamy dish that we got so it was a nice chance from all the creamy dishes we ordered. \n\nMalai Broccoli - mix of broccoli, yams, and artichokes. I loved this dish, it was really tasteful and seasoned very nicely! Good portion size to share. (see pics) \n\nAsparagus Pepper Fry - i liked the asparagus more than the curried cauliflower mousse that came with but nonetheless if you're an asparagus fan, i would highly recommend this. Tender and again seasoned well. \n\nKashmiri Lamb Ribs - Nice spice kick and the ribs goes well with the yogurt chutney. A totally shareable dish. \n\nPanner pinwheel - sauce, amazing. Dip the naan bread over and over. Can't go wrong here. Dish comes in 3 quantity\n\nTandoori Seasonal Mushrooms - also really nicely displayed! The polenta texture was well done with the parmesan cream froth, accompanied by the truffle imported from France. \n\nSea Bass - Really nicely cooked. Presentation was lovely. We could have done it either without the jalape\u00f1o salan or with just a small bit. They do put quite a bit over the seabass and i think it overpowers the flavor of the seabass itself.\n\nWe also got 2 of the bread samplers, different kinds of naan bread to please everyone. All so good. \n\nDrinks - \nChai punch - most common and popular. Comes in a fancy tea cup and tea pot. Don't be fooled though it's not a hot drink. You can also really taste the monkey shoulder. Really good. \n\nMistletoe Kisses - as my friend puts it  it's like drinking a bouquet of flowers (lol) it's very light, light fragrance, and floral. Was not sweet at all. Very delicious and would recommend drinking it throughout dinner instead of just for dessert. \n\nFor Dessert we shared te Carrot Halwa Cake - most popular at the restaurant. Texture, taste and presentation was definitely 5 stars. \n\n\nStaff/Service - Very attentive. replaced our old places, wiped off any excessive food splatters and food on the table. Very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu. Made some recommendations which we took and were pleased with the dishes we ordered (more so) \n\nAmbience of the restaurant is very nice. I would definitely want to come again and try their breakfast/brunch menu and tasting menu. It was definitely a little pricey but not totally surprised by how much things cost. I think given the portion sizes, it could have been priced out more fairly but i totally understand. The quality of the food was top notch, food was beautifully presented and displayed. Overall ambience and vibes of the restaurant was really nice. I can definitely see events taking place here. \n\nNice decor, friendly staff and they have great seating space indoors (limited space outdoors) I would recommend sitting indoors instead of outdoors to be perfectly honest.\n\nWill be back!", "author": "Tammy K."}

I was really excited when high-end Indian started to take hold in the bay area, but generally have been somewhat underwhelmed.   I have eaten at Juhu Beach Club, Rasa, Babu Ji and August 1 Five (not Campton Place....yet), but ROOH, hands down, rises to the top of the heap.   \n\nI won't go into detail about every dish, as we each ordered the tasting menu (recommended) and we each ordered a different option in each category and shared.\n\n- Ambiance:   very colorful, very luxurious, not overly loud.   Perfect mix of hip, luxury and fun.   \n\n- Service:   very friendly, very knowledgeable.   We were gushing about the meal to our server at the end, and she brought the chef out to talk to us.   He explained to us how he executed his concept and how he was able to extract so much flavor out of ingredients and still keep the flavors very indian despite not being able to use certain cooking techniques here in the states.\n\n- Cocktails:   Amazing!   The glasses and vessels used were beyond elegant....I kind of wanted to steal them all.   The tumeric tonic is probably the best cocktail I have had all year.\n\n- Food:   Everything was delicious.   Flavor was on point every single time.   All of the curry sauces were the best I have had.  The proteins were cooked to perfection.   Every vegetable was crisp and the flavor was allowed to shine through despite the spices.   Nothing was over or underseasoned.   The mushrooms were incredible.   The canapes in the beginning were all very different and fun and unique (I the egg foam thing served in the egg shell was my favorite).  The desserts were great.....best carrot cake I have ever had.   The only gripes I had were that there were a few things that were a little hard to eat.   They served this rice puff bar thing with avocado on it, and when we went to cut it with the fork, both of our flew off the plate.   Also, on the chocolate dessert, there was this compressed ice cream log thing on the side, that was either a little too compressed or a little too frozen so, again, was difficult to cut with a fork.\n\nOverall, this is the best Indian food I have ever had in my life, and is probably my new favorite restaurant.   If you love Indian food, come here.   If you don't love Indian food, come here.   Honestly, I don't know what there is to not like here.

When we walked into the restaurant we noticed the cool decor and music. It was pretty loud and crowded for a Thursday evening. We were promptly seated and began to look at the menu. Our server was awesome and gave us some hints on their specialty cocktail menu. It was creative and broken down into palate (sweet, salty, astringent, etc). I do not remember the names of the cocktails, but I had one with bourbon (astringent) and it was quite good and also a tequila drink that was also good. \n\nWe opted to sample some shared plates (plus a few sent out from the chef with his compliments) and started with the shared combination appetizer plate. We then had lamb ribs, cumin potatoes, chickpeas, pork belly, kale tempura with a potato cake and a few others. The sizes were perfect for sharing and getting a sample of the food. I was very impressed with the originality of the seasoning and created excitement for Indian food. Nothing was spicy at all. In fact, some spiciness would be an asset. Overall, quite good. The pork belly tasted more Asian than Indian, but pretty good. \n\nMy only complaint would be that it took forever to get our drinks. Like look at your watch kind of long. Also, the food came out in two bursts with the appetizer and 3 items at once, then almost 20 minutes later for the rest of the items and by that time we were pretty full so needed to take some home. This, I am sure, will get worked out in time as the place is very new. \n\nOverall, exciting flavors and great service (albeit slow) and once they get their service smoothed out, this place will truly come into it's own, and we will definately be back for that!", "author": "Lorenzo R."}

They were varied from the spicy to the cooling. Each was individual; each was very good. The lamb ribs with apricot glaze was tender and flavorful.

It came with a dosa crisp made from cauliflower that surprised with its subtlety. We finished with lamb chop with pistachios. The meat was warn and tender. The flavor was divine. What impressed us the most was the tenderness of the meat and how well each sauce complimented, but did not overwhelm what it accompanied.\n\nWe ordered wine by the glass. They have good, not ordinary wines by the glass. More restaurants should learn that trick. The wine list was varied with prices for many price points.

This is a high end Indian restaurant, so expect to pay like any other SOMA upscale establishment.  The atmosphere is modern, beautiful bar and modern decor.  The presentation is nice, they take the time to put the ingredients forward, it's not the usual takeout Indian.\n\nWe walked in after a happy hour on a Friday, were seated promptly and had very attentive and knowledgeable servers.  The only thing I would recommend is spacing the food, we shared 4 appetizers and they all came out at the same time, I would have enjoyed a meal that was a few courses.  \n\nThe food: \n\nChutney Sampler with Papad: the sauces were great, and the papad was crispy and absolutely not oily, nice start to any meal to wake up your taste buds. \n\nCharred Sweet Potato: The flavors were bold, well executed and cooked just right.  You can have it by itself or order it as a side to an entire. \n\nKeema Haderabi: this was interesting and we did't really know what we would get, it was a nice flavor, more the Indian type texture of sauce you'd expect but again not heavy, you can see and taste the ingredients.\n\nCrispy Lamb Ribs: great sharing portion, we had 2 each, the meat was falling off the bone, no fat, great flavor.  \n\nWhile we were plenty full from this meal, I liked sharing small dishes and trying various things rather than committing to a main course. The portions are generous.  I will definitely want to come back and try more dishes, nice Indian places are not easy to find in the city, we only have a few and this one is definitely playing with the food and new concepts.", "author": "Inga W."}

My table tried a variety of dishes and they were all fantastic.

I can't remember) \n\nI also really enjoyed the pink city cocktail. As the waitress said, it definitely has some personality! I believe it was tequila with guava pur\u00e9e and some chile, garnished with a spicy cucumber. Very interesting and delicious with a kick!\n\nThe service was fantastic. Beautiful food presentation, not pushy about ordering food (as a different review said), constantly refilled my water glass, and honest about food/drink recommendations (I asked for drink recs and she said she recommended staying away from a particular drink because the kitchen was re-working the recipe and I appreciated that tip!)\n\nAdditionally, I came here for a work dinner so I didn't personally pay for this meal, so I didn't pay attention to food/service value for the money you pay!\n\n\nOverall very tasty, unique and flavorful food with great service.

The yellow couch benches are gorgeous, and the wicker chairs with an old school vibe are awesome. The color combos in this place are so great. \nMenu was organized into small plates, entrees, and large platters. Separate 7 course tasting menu was also an option but too much for a Tuesday night so we opted for a few shared small plates. All the small plates were actually much larger than I expected. \n\nWe started with a assorted platter: chorizo scotch egg, sausage, and a shisito pepper stuffed with riccotta. The tasty morsels were served with a house ketchup, sriracha mayo, and spicy green sauce. While everything was flavorful on it's own, the sauces were a nice compliment. \nThe small plates we share were the potato tikki, asparagus pepper fry, paneer chili, and tuna bhel.  I'll admit that there is so much going on with all of those dishes - they all have like a million ingredients so while i didn't really taste ONE thing in particular it did all tasty delicious. \n-The potato tikki was a mash/hash potato type with fried kale and spinach and some sauces drizzled over it. Tasty but again all over the place. \n-Asparagus pepper fry was just asparagus with a lot of yellow curry foam on it. It was fine but not for that price. Nothing interesting there. \n-Paneer chili was probably my favorite because it was paneer wrapped in some crispy fried katalfi, with a really refreshing side papaya salad, and some chili paste. Definitely nothing what I was expecting and favorite of the night. \n-The tuna bhel was definitely delicious but it just kinda tasted like a poke. \n\nMy only issue: I wanted to order dessert but the waiter took so long to take our dessert order and by the time he came back, we had to leave. Boooo. \n\nI had a sip of my friend's mango mule and it was delicious.

The ambience looked great on entering, and we were assigned seats immediately.\nWe started with their famous cocktails, a few vegetarian and non-veg appetizers. Cocktails were good, too mild though. Vegetarian appetizers were quite average, non-vegetarian were good. \nThen the disappointing part. We ordered a few mains and breads along with it. The service went haywire after that. They started serving dishes one at a time with at least 5 minute gap between each item, and by time everything was on the table, most of the items were pretty cold. We had to ask them to change plates after the appetizers, and even after that, plates given were too small to eat properly.\nAnother interesting part was the bill. Initial bill was 373 dollars(gratuity included) for 8 people. After giving them credit card, they swiped it for 395. After telling them that, they came again, refunding 395, and swiping 381 this time.

It is quite an upscale restaurant that adds a touch of fusion and fanciness to each of their dishes.\n\nI came here with a group of coworkers on a Wednesday afternoon and opted for their Keema dish which consists of ground lamb and green peas with a potato mousse on top. It came with a buttered pao which was firm in touch but chewy in texture with a sweet buttery taste like a sweet Hawaiian roll. The Keema had a lot of various flavors, but all of them were rather mild. The sauce, mousse, and lamb were all great, but lacked a key flavor I could identify the dish with. It left me in a state of \"yeah. It's pretty good.\" rather than giving me a wow moment. The portion also felt lacking as it felt more like a small plate than a large plate which it is categorized as.\n\nIn addition to my order, I got to try some bits and pieces of their two tasting options. They have a selection of non-vegetarian and vegetarian tasting meals, with the differences being the addition of butter chicken in the former and also different appetizers. The tasting meal seems to be the way to go as it offers a lot of goodies to form a full meal. There is quite a bit here so unless you come hungry, it may be a good idea to share some.\n\nOverall, I find Rooh to be a nice place for a more fancy upscale Indian food experience. I do wish they added more prominence of flavors to their dishes and some spiciness to them as everything felt mild in flavor and heat. However, I would say that because of this, Rooh could be a great location to take someone who is not as familiar with Indian cuisine to in a way, ease them in to the cultural flavors with these light dishes.", "author": "Joshua M."}

This was a very uncomfortable situation as we are very familiar with Indian food and so as we asked questions the poor waiter become more and more uncomfortable. Seriously, if you are going to have waiters who are not Indian, then train them about the food and the ingredients and the variations. Secondly, the service was terrible. Our lentil dish was never delivered and while we were not charged, we would have loved to have enjoyed it. The rice had to be asked for at least three times. Thirdly are the portions. Indian food is like Italian food, it's family style, meant to be shared, and the portions are generous. These portions were like tapas, and a lot of our favorites are not on the menu. Now if you are basically afraid of Indian food, or you want to pay a fortune for little fancy bites that are \"safe\" for those afraid of Indian food, then this is the place for you. Forth point, the decor. The painting of the Indian woman on the wall had all of us chuckling! I mean really????? She is as white as they come! As my sister in law pointed out, no one in my family looks like that. Again, if you are wanting a hip place that allows you to say you \"love\" Indian food, then this is a safe bet for you. I try not to write bad reviews but when you call the only options this place gives you is to leave a message. I usually try to call the manager and express my concerns but that is not an option with this restaurant. The only redeeming factor here is that they do use some of the traditional Indian spices that we all love. If you want Indian food, don't pick ROOH.", "author": "Kayleen L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-25", "description": "I have to give it a mixed review. The food was absolutely amazing. The service was absolutely terrible. \nWhen we first got in, we had expressed interest in wanting to do the tasting menu with the beverage pairing. When you do a tasting menu with a pairing, it is the server's JOB to explain the wine which we get with each food item and how it enhances the taste. We should know the bottle and year if it's asked, which our server did not know. On top of all of this, we realized at the end, that our wine pairing was running slower than the food. So at the end of the meal, we had one entree and 3 glasses of wine in front of us. How is that a pairing? Why would we pay $40 extra for a wine pairing if you can't even PAIR it correctly? \n\nIf this wasn't bad enough, the managers who walked around were very judgmental. As my husband and I are relatively younger, it felt as if the managers were purposely ignoring us as they assumed we didn't understand food or wine. They went around to every table in our area except ours. When I asked one of the managers in which order I should eat the entree presented to me [there were sauces, meats, sides etc], I got a very rude response. I didn't feel welcomed or appreciated as a customer. \n\nIt's not all bad though. They really have done an excellent job with the food,and perhaps this lack of service would not have been noticeable if we hadn't done the tasting menu, it's hard to say. The chicken tikka masala was created very well. The twist on the pani puri, while very different, managed to keep the original flavors; it was delightful. They have really worked hard to create a very one of a kind menu.", "author": "Aastha V."}

I'll just give a brief overview of my experience.\n\nWhen I first arrived I felt like the host was not very friendly - he was this way throughout my entire time at the restaurant. It's a shame, really, because my waitress Marija was so friendly! I had the chef's tasting menu and was there for about 2 hours. The food was quite good - very interesting as well. I think the price was fair. In regards to the ambience...it was quite attractive. My only complaint is that the interior was a tad cramped and I was squished by one of the windows for the entire meal, but it was tolerable. On the other hand, the bathrooms (well, the men's, specifically), really seem out of character in conjunction with the dining space. They were definitely an afterthought and should probably be thoroughly redone given the upscale vibe that ROOH is trying to embody. At the end, the check came right away -- so I can't complain about that! \n\nI would probably come back here with some friends, perhaps - I went alone this time. The bar looked well-stocked so this could be a good place to visit for the happy hour, although I do believe theirs ends quite early - around 6, but I could be mistaken.\n\nI definitely left with a fairly good impression, but I did not love ROOH. I think next time I will try some of the more traditional options. Their butter chicken is quite delicious - it was offered on the tasting menu - so I anticipate that they nailed the classics across the board considering butter chicken is a good litmus test for Indian restaurants in general.

The food was good but I was very disappointed by the service. We arrived early as we usually do to have a drink at the bar. They also class themselves as a cocktail bar. When we checked in at the front desk we were not welcomed in the normal way. The response from the front desk staff was 'oh you're early'. This was the weirdest hello I've ever received at a restaurant. My wife suggested that we go to the bar and the front desk agreed that was the only option. \n\nAt the bar we were given menus but it was an age before we were served. I was getting pretty frustrated as the bar was quiet and there were almost more staff than customers. However, I realized that only one guy could make the cocktails out of the 4/5 people behind the bar. Everyone else was just cleaning pots and looking busy. \n\nWe ordered appetizers at the bar which were very good. However, we were called to our table before we finished. I asked the member of staff if we can bring them to the table and he told me sure we can carry them ourselves. Again, this stuck me as strange. However, I carefully carried my cocktail and appetizer plates across the restaurant and slid past other diners as the member of staff strode quickly away. \n\nThis restaurant has potential if they sort out the service and make it more customer friendly.", "author": "Stephen M."}

The menu is very simple so I made the dining experience very stress-free. You have the choice of two main entr\u00e9es today we had the choices of chicken or paneer. I myself chose the chicken and it was delectable. The chicken comes In a yellow curry sauce that goes really well with both the naan and the rice. Your meal also comes with avocado raita, papad and chutney, And to start with as an appetizer, You get some crispy spinach and kale which I highly recommend trying some time.

Chicken was surprisingly moist!\n- BEEF SHORT RIBS CURRY\n- 3/5: the actual short rib was a little dry. There was also this fried ball of short rib meat (don't know how else to describe it) that was super moist that saved the dish\n\nAccompaniments\n- Avocado & Garlic Raita\n1/5: tasted like plain greek yogurt straight from the tub\n- Saffron Rice\n3/5: it was basic saffron rice\n- Garlic Naan\n4/5: flavorful and fluffy\n\nDesserts\n- CARROT HALWA CAKE\n4/5: cake was moist & not too sweet.

We were presented the regular dinner menu, the cocktail menu, the wine list, and the tasting menu. The most interesting one was the cocktail menu, which had a circular design. I had to spin it around in order to find what I wanted - the delicious mango mule.\n\nThe 7 course tasting menu was $80, which seemed in line with other places in pricey San Francisco.\n\nSeveral of the courses had vegetarian and meat options; since we decided to share everything, we basically tried every item on the tasting menu except for the vegetarian entree: paneer pinwheels.\n\nAll of the courses were delicious. My favorite was the fish; It was perfection in my mouth.\n\nI found the \"entree\" courses of butter chicken and short rib vindaloo to be very true to traditional Indian recipes.\n\nFor dessert, I liked the Chocolate Ganache cake (with masala chai ice cream, hazelnut chikki, and buckwheat crisp) and he preferred the Carrot Halwa Cake (with cardamom and pistachio kulfi, milk skin crisp). I was quite happy with the food from both a flavor and presentation standpoint.\n\nWe had three main people providing service - the person who took our order, the person who presented the dishes, and the person who refilled the water. The first two were not good at their jobs. The guy who brought out the dishes stumbled over the descriptions of each course. Does the tasting menu change every day? If not, he should be able to memorize clearly what is on it. Shortly after guy #2 would bring out the dishes, guy #1 would come by to check on how we were doing. He didn't do a reality check when he proceeded with his rehearsed script. He would ask how something tasted when it was clear we had not yet even touched the plate. Could he not tell that the entire presentation was in tact? We told both guy #1 and guy #2 that we were sharing all of the courses yet sharing plates were removed with every course but not always replaced. At times, utensils would be missing.

Lively crowd in the bar, we were seated towards the back behind the hostess stand where it wasn't too loud but you could still feel the energy.  The menu says \"Progressive Indian\" but I would describe it as Gourmet Indian.  Shared a chutney platter, the Sea Bass, Short Ribs, and Butter Chicken.  I can't tell you which one was the best because they were all delicious.  Perfectly done and the sauces were to die for.  Portions were reasonable, presentation was a work of art, and service was friendly and responsive. Cute pinwheel cocktail menu that guided you toward your taste preference--I had the Mustard Old Fashion that didn't taste any different (to me) than a regular one.  Good--but nothing special.  House Pinot was very good and paired well with all of the dishes.  I will be back to Rooh and often!", "author": "Dawn W."}

It is not visible in the presentation - so not sure what I am missing here.\nKashmiri Lamb ribs - this was truely great. The lamb ribs were perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.\nLamb chops - Again most amazing - however I would expect at least one more piece for the price we are paying. $12 per piece is way too much - and the chops were not sizable to boot.\nChanna curry - this was really bad; Please, please do not order this. Tasted like it was out of a pre-packaged packet. Smelt bad and tasted badder. If they don't do a better job at this - better to remove from the menu.\nSaffron rice - was good, but did not enjoy because of the bad Channa curry.\nBanana Torte - Amazing.

Minor issue but they should be able to handle this. \n\nThird, waiters would consistently overlap duties with food questions and descriptions. Yes we would like tap for the third time.  \n\nFinally, the food. Some decent stuff but most was mediocre to poor.  The curries were all too sweet.  The sauces and chutneys appeared multiple times across dishes lending a sameness. World class high end Indian exists - Junoon and Tamarind in NYC, a couple places in New Delhi and London.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-07", "description": "Alright, here's the thing...I was trying to decide between three and four stars and decide they get four stars based entirely on the food.  It'd be five stars, though, if the rest of the night went according to plan...\n\nTo start, I made a reservation at Rooh, because both my boyfriend and I are so intrigued by the concept of an Indian tasting menu along with not-just-wine beverage pairings.  \n\nWe get to the restaurant at 7:28 for a 7:30 reservation. We're told our table isn't ready, but that it won't be more than ten minutes.  That's fine--I get it.  We sit at one of the two-top tables by the bar and are greeted by a server (who we wound up having all night and who was fabulous).  We order drinks, which take about fifteen minutes.  This wound up being okay...because our table wasn't ready until 7:55.  So we eat. And we're hungry. And we're excited.\n\nWe sit down and look at the menus and notice there is no tasting menu.  We ask about it. \"Oh, we're not doing that tonight, because we have too many reservations.\"  Okay...so you only do the tasting menu on nights when you're slow? Why offer a tasting menu if you can't offer it on nights when you're at capacity?  I get that it'd be tough for a kitchen to handle a full menu and a tasting menu, but then maybe only offer it on certain nights...or, ya know, don't fill the restaurant if you can't handle both offerings for everyone there?  We were incredibly disappointed, because we came across the Bay just to try their tasting menu.  I'll be honest, I came close to walking out, because at the price point, I really wanted to see what the chef came up with for the tasting menu rather than blindly guessing at food I wasn't familiar with.\n\nHowever, we stayed, because again, we came all this way.  We ultimately ordered a variety of things (recommended, in part, by our super friendly waiter) and they were all (mostly) amazing.  He even tried to pick out the most popular items from the tasting menu and explained what they were in more detail. \n\nSmall plates: the lamb ribs and the tomato/burrata kut.  Both were 5 stars.  The tomatoes were just slightly warmed through and the flavor combination was stellar.  It's also served with this bread and when we asked what it was, we were told \"well, I like to think of it as an Indian foccacia\" and that description is spot on.  Think foccacia with cumin.  So absolutely awesome.  And it paired great with the kut.  The lamb ribs were fall off the bone tender and when we asked if they were sous-vide the response was \"oh, we sous vide pretty much all of our protein.\" Smart.  \n\nLarge plates: the butter chicken, the sea bass, and their mushroom dish.  The butter chicken was fantastic (I'm new to Indian food, so my boyfriend said the flavor was definitely better than what he had experienced at other places, but not by much.)  The sea bass was cooked to perfection (again, sous vide), but the sauce is definitely peanut-y.  I hate peanuts and was really bummed about this, because I don't think the menu mentioned peanuts as a flavor profile, but maybe I missed it.  The mushroom dish was also super awesome, but definitely on the rich side.  I only had a couple bites and then focused on the naan and butter chicken. \n\nSides: saffron rice & naan sampler with avocado raita.  All good. All standard.\n\nWine: again, we were planning on beverage pairings.  Luckily the wine director dude (who also had the awesome responses above) made a suggestion based on what we were having and it was spot on.  He also said that they're changing the tasting menu + beverage pairings in the next month or so, so I'm excited to see what he has up his sleeve.\n\nAll in all, I'll definitely be back.  However, I'll make sure to call the day of to make sure they're still doing the tasting menu.  As a pro-tip, if you know you're not going to be offering a big part of your whole shtick, how about you call the people with reservations and update them so that if they don't want to travel an hour to your restaurant, they have the option to cancel?", "author": "Shannon B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-14", "description": "Over priced. Interesting menu and flavors but flavors could be better - eg NiharI having such little gravy is very weird and the flavors themselves were gamey. The meat, while well cooked, had not absorbed the flavors of the curry (we are Indian, and very familiar with the flavors they're trying to replicate / achieve) Great cocktails. Nice decor. \n\nBad service - the servers are not educated about food allergies and have no attention to detail. I am gluten intolerant and the server was not very knowledgeable about the menu wrt this. Worse is he went to ask the chef some questions and came back with responses that made no sense (e.g. \"This item is not made gluten free because chef says potatoes have gluten in them\". Really?) Ultimately we ordered what they recommended and even then had a reaction when I came home. \n\nMy friend who is nut allergic received a dish laced with peanut, despite having requested it be put on the side. He found out only after taking a bite. This was followed by a perfunctory apology and a replacement of the dish. It would have been common courtesy to knock the dish of the bill / dessert on the house / some indication of an attempt to improve the dining experience - but no such effort was made.\n\nAll in all, for the prices, I'd expect : better food, more options accommodating food allergies or at least the willingness to customize (indian cuisine is one of the most food allergy friendly cuisines) and better service. Sad to have wasted $200 for a special dinner here.", "author": "Yelper 2."}

It has been less than a month since they have opened, and we've already been there 3 times. \n\nThe decor and ambience is very ethnic and classy, their attention to detail shows.\n\nService - their service has been top notch, the owners - Vikram and Anu are quite involved every evening, to make sure things are going ok. Their staff know the ingredients and menu quite well and are good at making thoughtful recommendations. \n\nCocktails - I love the wheel, where they have classified their cocktails based on flavor - sweet, pungent, sour,  bitter & salty. We have tried almost 6 of their cocktails, all of them are really good.\n\nThe Food - I am vegetarian - I still found a lot of options to chose from. I love their Chilli Pakoda, the Potato Tikki was delicious and took me back to Delhi, Paneer chilli, in the small plates is also very nice. In the entree section, I liked their Paneer Pinwheel. Don't bother with the portobello tandoor it stuck out like a sore thumb on an Indian menu, even the flavors were bland and not very Indian. Highly recommend their dal makhni & laccha paratha.\n\nMy husband LOVES the Prawn Sausage & butter chicken (very authentic)!\n\nIn desert - highly recommend trying their carrot cake. It was delicious!\n\nStrongly recommend visiting Rooh to get a taste of India :) Please keep up the good work and high quality, Team Rooh!", "author": "A S."}

We were excited to try out a new place, especially an attractive Indian alternative to our old standbys. Very nice place. We were greeted and seated quickly. Attentive waiter. So far so good.\n\nWe ordered cocktails to celebrate a fake birthday -- someone somewhere was having one -- and after a brief Q&A with our waiter we ordered. As is typical for our lunch event, we just went straight to the entrees. The food came quickly but as it was placed down we all made eye contact with each other at the small size of the portions. They were tastefully arranged art pieces but this was, after all, an Indian meal and we expected to get fed and full. The food was tasty enough and we all enjoyed it but to a man we all felt like we'd had appetizers and joked about going somewhere else to eat on the way back to work. \n\nAlthough the portions are small, the prices are not. At $20 per entree this was definitely on the high end of what we manage for lunch, but coupled with the very small portions we weren't happy. \n\nNext Indian we'll stick to the local faves which are both tasty and (too) filling - North India, Chaat Cafe, etc.\n\nOh, the cocktails were tasty, mid priced, but at least of the normal size!", "author": "David F."}

We had Placed our order which included cocktails, appetizers and entrees. Some of the Appetizers came in around 15 mins, they were served with the side dishes that we ordered for the entrees. We had to remind the waiter about our cocktails and a missing appetizer, which he seemed to have forgotten about. Anyways, the remaining appetizer and cocktails came in another 15 mins. \n\nAfter another 30mins had passed we asked about our entrees and the waiter assured us it'd take 1-2mins more. In another 15 mins we asked for an update. Waiter said another 2-4 mins and said he'd call the manager to assure us. Another 15mins later we demanded to talk to the manager. At this point we had been there 1.5 hours and no sign of any of our entrees (although our entire order was made all at once since we got at the table). Meanwhile, the manager shows up and tells us it's \"restaurant week\" and orders are taking longer than usual. Tells us it'l take another \"2-3 mins\". Another 15 mins go by, we ask the manager to cancel our orders. He tells us he's sorry and we can have our food packaged but in at least  \"5 more mins\", but can't assure us if it'l still be within 5mins. We ask for the check instead. The check showed they charged us 20% gratuity and had incorrectly listed us as a 6 person table. We demanded they take off the gratuity. We spent 2 hours there only to have left without dinner. We could have left an hour earlier had they told us it's a busy day and our orders were to take this long. Instead they kept misleading us with \"2-3 more mins\". The mismanagement of time expectations was what riled us up. This place is too expensive to get away with such bad service. There was barely any remorse expressed by senior management. This \"take it or leave it\" attitude is unacceptable. I'm never going here again. \n\nP.S. A different waitress who came to clean our table while we were leaving apologized profusely and hoped this wasn't the last time we came here. She was the only person who seemed to care the entire evening. Can't say the same about the manager or anyone running this place.", "author": "Gautam K."}

The ambiance is lovely, cool colors, art, lighting, etc. and the drink menu was really cool. I would have had more drinks, except that no one came back to offer me another. So one drink it was! \nThe servers were all lovely people. Very sweet and when they were with us, gave some input. However, with the small plates style of this restaurant, we thought we would have the dishes somewhat staged out. Instead, we drank our drinks, sat there with empty glasses and waited for an extraordinarily long time to get all things served at once. \nThe food was delicious tasting, but it has clearly sat in the kitchen for a while, as it was about room temp. Also, the servers forgot 2 parts of the order, which would have been an appetizer. \nThe servings are quite small, so it is key to order more than you would think initially. We thought we were ordering a lot of food, but it was light. Again, this is fine and I know it is a fine dining experience, but with better service, this would not be an issue. \nI am sure that Rooh will go on to be very successful if they can get the system right, but I left feeling pretty disappointed and did not feel the experience matched the price point.", "author": "Emily P."}

The decor felt like English influenced Indian spot.  Bright colors, people around walking and talking.  \n\nService:  The service was great.  The servers were incredibly knowledgeable and they educate you on your dishes as they arrive with the ingredients, intention, flavors, etc.\n\nFood:  What can I say?  Everything we ate was absolutely delicious.  We started with the pappadams and the 3 chutneys.  They were incredible and the chutneys were unlike anything I've tasted.  Then we had the tuna small plate, which was a deconstructed crudo.  It was perfect.  Then we had the sea bass, which was covered in this deliciously rich sauce that tasted like a lobster bisque without the lobster.  Finally we had the mushroom tandoori.  Holy hell, that was the best tasting mushroom anything I've ever eaten and will order this every time  I go back.  Then there were the drinks.  We had the margerita-ish drink (forgive me, I can't remember the names of these things).  They put some seasoning in there that made it so damn good and unique.\n\nAny downsides?  I will say, it was a bit expensive. For the 2 of us, we had a small plate, 2 big plates, 4 drinks, and an appetizer.  With tip, it was over $200.

All three of us are vegetarians, and having previously been to Rooh for brunch, we knew that their menu would have lots of options for us. \n\nThe place wasn't packed but pretty lively for a Tuesday night. We ordered four small plates and 1 large plate to share\n\nBeetroot Murraba\nCauliflower 65\nAsparagus Pepper Fry\nDahi Puri\n\nTandoori Seasonal Mushrooms with upma polenta. (Truffle)\nCarrot Halwa Cake with Kulfi \n\nWe enjoyed the dahi puri, cauliflower 65, and tandoori mushrooms immensely. The dahi puri came with 6 pieces that you eat whole and was like Pani puri assembled for you with yogurt on top. The cauliflower 65 dish was as delicious as we'd remembered from brunch, with balls of fried cauliflower arranged artfully in a ring on an utthapam (different presentation than the brunch menu). The beetroot murraba was yummy, but not so different from any other beet salad in the bay-- tender chunks of multicolored beets tossed with greens and a tangy dairy counterpoint. The Asparagus fry dish fell flat-- we were envisioning a more South Indian style dish and flavor profile, and we were disappointed with the stalks that were cooked through but didn't really taste like anything beyond asparagus. The tandoori mushrooms were fantastic-- several different varieties baked with that tandoori char and piled onto creamy dreamy upma served polenta style. So good. \n\nWe will likely be back at Rooh sometime soon. If we came again for dinner, we'd probably order the dumplings or paneer off the large plate menu. We'd probably also get the tikkis and paneer chili off the small plate menu. Overall this place is delicious and beautiful and we'd highly recommend to others!", "author": "T K."}

She was excellent with following up with me regarding numbers, timing, etc. I even came in and tasted a few items during the day, well in advance.\nOn the evening of our party, everything was perfect and smooth. Our server Ashley was delightful. Even though there was a lot of vegetarian food, they created a vegetarian main dish for the few strict vegetarians.  \nEveryone really, really loved the food.  The potato tikki was a hit, as was the tuna bhel. We also had paneer chili as an appetizer, which was good as well. The traditional butter chicken was a hit, as was the halibut a la plancha. I really liked the black dariy dal as well. For desserts, the masala chai chocolate pave and ice cream was a great treat. \nWe also did a flight of Indian whiskies (there is much more than just Indian whiskies, but we thought we would try several Indian whiskies.) That was fun, and got to sample various whiskies. \nIt was terrific for a party of 20, and I would definitely come back here again for dinner because the food was that good.", "author": "Michelle G."}

The service was great, and they had amazing recommendations. We went to brunch on Sunday, and the food was AMAZING. I recommend the chicken tikka &a cheddar kulcha, the pain puri, the short ribs curry, and the tuna bhel for brunch, and the banana tart tatin. This was great and I will definitely be returning soon!", "author": "Sofia C."}

It seems to develop a new taste for Indian food and in spite quite yummy. We tried their bread sampler, dal makhani, artichoke and grain pulao and paneer pinwheel. Its on the expensive side for the quantity but gives a decent fine dine experience.", "author": "N P."}

Recently we have seen few new arrivals trying to showcase the inherent richness, diversity and complexity which is the bedrock of Indian cuisine. Our dinner experience last night at Rooh, was one that left us quite content and satisfied, presenting a refreshing take on Indian cuisine executed at a high level that is rare to find in the Bay Area. My family and I had been planning on dining at this restaurant ever since it had opened, so we finally decided to go on the occasion of celebrating my birthday. We made our reservation for 8:30 P.M. \u00a0and upon our arrival at 8:27, we were seated promptly by the hostess which we appreciated.\n\n\u00a0Our waitress Patty explained to us that the head Chef Sujan Sarkar was out of the country and the sous chef Jesse was at the helm of the kitchen for the evening. We sampled a vast array of what the menu had to offer and came to the conclusion that the small plates were far superior to the large ones overall. The potato tikki ($12) was extremely subtle in terms of the spices that were used, while still being very delicious and the kale and spinach tempura provided a nice textural contrast to the dish. The chicken 65 ($15) was crisp on the exterior yet juicy on the inside and the uttapam accompanied it well. The cauliflower mousse served with the asparagus pepper fry ($15) was simple, buttery and absolutely divine - perhaps the standout item from our entire meal. The Alaskan halibut ($29) with khichdi was definitely our favorite dish from the large plates section of the menu. We found the fish to be flaky and flavorful and the khichdi almost mimicked the feeling of eating a risotto. The desserts which are a result of the creative mind of the Pastry chef Ravi, were impressive to say the least. We had the carrot halwa cake ($10) that was served with a creamy pistachio kulfi and the chocolate pave cake ($10) was rich and satisfying. The drinks were just as creative and innovative as the food, with the standout being the Banaras sour cocktail.\n\nWhile we were impressed with our meal as a whole, we did find some shortcomings in the food that we felt could not be overlooked. The butter chicken pave ($26) was too sweet for our tastes and the lamb chops ($32) were far too bland- perhaps they were not marinated enough or given enough seasoning for the flavors to penetrate through. The chicken malai tikka ($15) was also a dish that we found to be quite one note and had far too much cheese for our liking. The sides of the saffron rice ($5) and the bread sampler ($8) were also lacking in execution and needs much improvement.\u00a0\nThe service at Rooh was another highlight of our dining experience. Our server Patty was very friendly and willing to accommodate all our needs. It was also evident that the gentleman bringing our dishes to the table had a strong understanding of the food being served and was able to explain each dish flawlessly. The ambiance at this restaurant was absolutely incredible. We loved the vibrant and lush colors that were used throughout, and the lighting was dimmed to just the right level.\u00a0The decor was elegant and sophisticated, while also providing a sufficient amount of whimsy and fun. A minor constructive observation we have regarding the layout of the  kitchen is that, it is secluded away from the dining guests. We feel that a restaurant of this caliber should have the kitchen at the center of the establishment in an open concept which would have provided an added theatrical element to the dining experience. After all, the kitchen is the heart and soul of any restaurant and should be showcased properly instead of just being an afterthought.\nAt the end of our meal, the Co owner of the restaurant Ms. Anu, came to our table to speak to us about our dining experience which we found to be a very kind gesture on her part.\u00a0\n\nMy mother is a very accomplished,\u00a0professional Indian chef in the Bay Area, and she does not get easily impressed with Indian restaurants especially considering the pathetic variety that currently make up the majority of the Indian food scene in the Bay Area, however, she was pleasantly surprised at how much she enjoyed her experience at Rooh. My entire family was in agreement that the dishes were cooked with progressive techniques and presented in a modern way, but that in no way compromised the integrity of what Indian cuisine is. We did not feel the Indian flavors of the dishes were muddled or hidden through the disguise of fusion with other cuisines. It was simply Indian food executed with a unique and creative thought process. If Rooh keeps up its current level of creativity and service and improves on the shortcomings of certain aspects on the menu, we have no doubts that it will continue to prosper.", "author": "Zareen A."}

They were fully booked for the evening, but we were able to be seated on the patio. We ordered several cocktails and quite a few of the small plates: the chutney platter, the cauliflower, the potato tikki (a standout), the asparagus, the scallops, a saffron rice, the garlic naan, and the baked chicken (I would skip next time). Everything we had was great. We raved about the food the whole time, until dessert came. We ordered two carrot cakes and one of the chocolate desserts. They were all $10 a piece and maybe two bites. They were really beautiful, but not tasty at all. The ice cream each was served with was icy and not flavorful. The carrot cake itself was kind of dry and honestly looked like end bits of a loaf of bread. We were all really surprised by how bad the desserts were considering how much we enjoyed the rest of dinner. I would totally come back, but I recommend skipping dessert for sure.", "author": "Jannah T."}

There were 7 of us and it was not clear what we should be ordering so that everyone could have enough. Server should have done a better job in explaining. The service was not that great either. Looks like a good place for a happy hour, but I do not see it as a serious restaurant. The food we had could not be faulted; it was not Indian though.", "author": "Anil K."}

The space is colorful and modern, and filled with light.  I feel that it adds character to this SOMA block...this area has changed dramatically over the years and while I miss some of the old establishments, Rooh brings a touch of flavor and culture with a fun vibe.  From the greeting and service to the bill, attention to detail was paid.  We had the pork belly, tandoori mushrooms and beef short ribs curry.  We also tried a Banaras Sour (Bloom gin, basil, cucumber, chartreuse) and Pink City (Plantation rum, guava, Indian chili, masala spices) cocktails, both of which were served up, yet still refreshing and not too heavy.  We also ordered the mustard old fashioned, which was much more stiff, in a good way, but tasted basically like an old fashioned, garnished with a crispy, candied orange wheel.  The kitchen sent out an amuse bouche shortly after we ordered - I couldn't tell you what exactly was in it, but it was delightful.  All the dishes we ordered were beautifully presented, and full of authentic flavor.  The manager was also very kind and attentive.  We can't wait to come back.", "author": "Selene W."}

We had the potato tikki, chicken 65, chili paneer, pork belly and vegetable dumplings. We loved everything except the pork belly. The pork belly had a nice texture and was good, but lacked the creativity of the other dishes. The textures and flavors of the potato tikki were standout. My only complaint about our dining experience is that all of the plates came out at about the same time. Halfway through our meal, our food was cold.
