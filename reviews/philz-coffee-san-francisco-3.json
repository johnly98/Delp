I love Philz, so it pains me that this Philz location was pretty disappointing.\n\nThis spot is pretty crowded since it's near Caltrain and a busy area. It doesn't have much seating and feels cramped. The layout needs a lot of work... Don't know how it made much sense to them. \nOnce you walk in from the front entrance, the seating area is to the left, while you order immediately to your front after queueing in line. Once you order, there simply isn't much room for you to wait for your coffee. You just stand awkwardly around, not sure where to wait. The way it's set-up doesn't make very efficient use of the space.\n\nMy go-to drink is always a Iced Silken Splendor straight-up (black). However, my coffee today was surprisingly bitter! Not as smooth as it usually is. Another issue is that it was somewhat slow since there were several people ahead of me and only two employees making drinks (versus the La Jolla location which can have like four). The employees were friendly, but it was just a \"meh\" experience.", "author": "Anthony T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-02", "description": "Oh, of course.  It makes perfect sense that the first coffee shop I review in over a year would be a Philz.  One, because I chose to, in part so I could use that line as an opener (ha!).  And two, because, honesty, who doesn't love Philz?  Personally, I can't help but smile whenever I hear the barista call out drink and see my brown cup of delicious goodness waiting for me on the counter!\n\nCompared to the other Philz locations that I've been to (this is the...ninth?), this is easily the smallest of the bunch.  With just a few tables around, there's really not much space to camp out at to do some work.  Though, with the way the meters/parking rates work around here, I'm sure most people who come here are those who live/work in the area or just happen to be in the neighborhood.  Like my friend and I, who just happened to stop in after one of the last Giants games of the season at AT&T.\n\nBetween the wealth of reviews/photos posted already and Philz's overwhelming popularity, there's really no need for me to break anything down (or post another photo).  If you've been, you know what's up.  And if you haven't, then you should just come here.  I'll just say - the Mint Mojito is one of my personal favorites (the Tesora is the other) and it was all too familiar and delicious here.  That being said, the balance of sweetness, cream, and coffee was a bit off this time around (light on the first, heavy on the second).\n\nWhile none of them were all that bad individually, the totality of the lack of tables, unfavorable parking situation, and slightly off drink makes this Philz more of a (reluctant) four star location than five for me.  Love how clean and convenient it is, but my return trips would probably be limited to before/after a Giants game or if I was already in the area, as opposed to making it a point of coming here.", "author": "Mike L."}

At first, the location seemed a bit out of the way for me but when I worked about a 5 minutes walk from this place, it made the perfect break and you get a delicious cup of coffee!\n\nIf you've never been to any Philz, just go to one, all Philz will carry about the same things when it comes to coffee and teas, some will carry different desserts but that's usually not a big deal for me. \n\nThe famous one cup at a time process for making coffee definitely earns the $3-4 price. When you get to a Philz, you'll notice baristas making coffees and they'll signal you to order. \n\nOrdering is pretty simple, pick a type of coffee you want, how sweet and how creamy you want. Pro-tip: for sweetening the coffee, you can get it with whatever type of sweetener, like sugar, honey, agave, Splenda, or nothing and also how much of it you want. My favorite way to sweeten is to use about half the average amount of honey. Same goes for creamer, you can choose milk, half and half, almond, and depending on where you go, other options as well. \n\nMy go-to drink is: small cup of Tantalizing Turkish with medium honey and medium creamer.", "author": "Muhammad U."}

Had it not been for the lack of clear signage and over-iced drink, I would've been happy giving Philz a perfect score. \n\nI enjoy going to coffee shops that have ample seating and wifi (it was on the small side, but I was just scouring for caffeine before taking a bus back to Southern California), but I also like getting in and out of there quickly. As soon as I walked through their wide doors, I was really confused about whether I should be ordering at the counter in front of me, at the register, or shouting my order at the heavens and hoping someone there would here me. It's not until you turn left and walk more into the shop that you see the wooden sign that says \"ORDER FIRST, PAY LATER.\"\n\nOn the bright side, someone at the front said she could help the next person in line, but that made no sense when there was just a small cluster standing in front of the counter, waiting for their drink. They could benefit from some tape to make a line.\n\n$4.25 for a small mint mojito was extremely pricey considering that my drink was filled to the brim with ice. Mint isn't cheap, but ice certainly is. I'd spring for a large next time I'm here, even if I don't want that much coffee.

I like to think that Philz's objective is to bring coffee to the forefront of the food and beverage world by making it seem like more than just a simple beverage that people drink on a regular basis.  \n\nAnd why should the preparation and serving of coffee not be treated with the same time, precision and emphasis that is placed into, say, the preparation and serving of wine?  When you walk into Philz, you start off by placing your order with the barista instead of with the cashier.  You can specify how you want your order prepared and the barista will get right on it and will call you when it's ready.  You then go to the cashier and pay for your order.  You can also get coffee beans, tea, bottled water, pastries, parfaits and other food items too.  Once your barista lets you know that your drink is ready, they have you taste it first to make sure that it was prepared to your satisfaction.  Any adjustments that you want made will be taken care of without hesitation.  I like this because the service is more personalized and the baristas at Philz are treated like sommeliers in a fancy restaurant.\n\nThus far, my beverages of choice have been hot chocolate and Ambrosia Coffee of God.  The hot chocolate has been the best hot chocolate I've ever had.  Not burning hot, but not lukewarm and very rich in flavor.  My Ambrosia coffee has been very flavorful and wakes me up very quickly. \n\nPrices are fair, transactions are quick and I don't have to deal with my name being butchered like at Starbucks or Peet's.  \n\nThis is how coffee and coffee shops should be everywhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-07", "description": "Besides tons of hipsters hanging out at all the Philz, the reason is simply because  it's great coffee! You really taste the difference in richness, flavor, and freshness from a single pour-over cup. The best part is, there are so many blends you can choose from on their menu. If you're feeling a light roast, you can have it! If you're feeling like having a medium or dark roast, there are many to choose from! And the names of the coffee blends makes drinking Philz coffee that much more enticing. \n\nThey pride themselves in brewing the coffee one cup at a time with the pour-over method, which is great because they can control the temperature of their filtered water and the amount of coffee they use to brew each cup. Your cup of coffee is highly customize-able. The blends are very rich, and I noticed its less harsh on my stomach because of its lower acidity. The baristas have great product knowledge and are very friendly. Some of my favorite blends of the Medium Roasts are Tesora and Ambrosia Coffee of God. My favorite Light Roasts are Sooo Good and Canopy of Heaven. They all have very complex flavors and are very smooth. It takes longer to brew but its worth the wait. I am currently in love with the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee, sweet and creamy, it really hits the spot! Its made with fresh spearmint leaves which adds an amazing aroma that wakens you!\n\nReally, if I could afford to go to Philz everyday for a cup of coffee, I would! Luckily they have a coffee of the month for $12 a pound (compared to $16/lb) that I bring to my office's coffee club when its my turn to contribute. We all love it so much and can never turn back and drink stuff from the Bucks of Star. We love to buy beans that are roasted locally because its so much fresher and Philz definitely does it for us. I even use Philz to make homemade coffee ice creams and they taste amazing!!! No joke!

The whole set up seemed hokey to me, but as I reflect, I realize how cool this place truly is. So for that, I'm sorry for my pre-judgement Philz!\n\nOne cup at a time movement, says it all! They literally make each cup to order and also add the cream and sugar for you. If you cringe at the word cream, then don't fret, they have soy milk too. As for sugar, they use cane brown sugar...if I remember correctly.\n\nI was a newbie with no prior knowledge about what I was about to experience. I thought the logo looked too commercial and I wasn't going to get a good cup of coffee. I was a little nervous, because their menu is overwhelming, to say the least. If you're anything like me, reading all that is too much time, so I just asked the Barista what she recommended in the medium roast family. She told me and I went with it - Philtered Soul and Tesora. Both were tasty, but the since I can't decide if I do or do not like hazelnut, Philtered Soul was my second fave out of the two. Tesora was good, not too bold, but not wimpy either. Both coffees were sweetened and had soy milk!\n\nAfter you order at the coffee bar, you head to pay. But they do have a case that holds pastries, donuts, and breakfast goodies. They had these burrito's that were individually wrapped in white paper. They looked a little suspect, but it said Bacon so I ordered it. I also ordered the Vegan Coffee doughnut! I was wrong again. That Mame's Bacon Burrito was so damn good, I immediately found them online and tried to order some - still working on that, by the way. Oh and that doughnut, was pretty amazing. It was moist, the glaze had coffee grounds in it too. Just enough to bring a delish coffee flavor through, but enough to feel like you're eating coffee beans straight up.\n\nNow I know whey this place was so busy and NOT because the SF Giants Race just finished. It's because their craft is what is important and they only sell the good stuff, from their coffee to their food. Not to mention, the Barista was so sweet, with my newbieness and awkward self. \n\nThey have indoor and outdoor seating, but it's high real estate. You gotta grab it while its there. The line can be out the door, but it goes fairly quickly. For all those other newbies, such as myself, just enjoy the experience and remember you get your coffee from where and who you ordered it from...this ain't no Starbucks ;)\n\nA coffee movement I can get behind!", "author": "Steph G."}

I've had this before at another one of their shops and it was perfectly sweet. I got my drink and it was just perfectly creamy, but no sweet. I had mint leaves in my cup, but I also had stems floating around. It also took a bit long for my cup of coffee. I'll have to come back again. Maybe it was just an off day.

Bottom line it's legit and I come here like it's my 2nd home.\n\nPro Tip Drinks:\nMint Mojito- This is probably what they are known for and what you've all heard about and it definitely lives to the hype. Take a sip of this and shit just got real. Keep in mind though the mint mojito is sweeter and creamier by default amongst all other drinks. So if you say \"Philz Way\" which is default for normal there, it will come out sweeter and creamier. Oh and the mint mojito is a mixture between hot and cold which is unexpected.\n\nPhiltered Soul: Ahhh yes. The drink that is made for the elite. Philtered Soul is one of my default for hot drinks that I usually get. It's very nutty and has a sweet hint of aroma to it. It definitely pairs well with a multitude of different pastries if you are interested in that color matching stuff. Highly recommend this one if you are conflicted.\n\nSilken Soul: This isn't even on the menu, but my sisters bf recommended it to me. Just a heads up. At Philz you can mix and match your beans so that you can come up with the one that you like. So be creative and think outside the box, before someone tears up your box.\n\nFood Selections:\nBurritos: Dude you can't go wrong with the burritos here. It's legit.

They have several locations around San Francisco and the South/East Bay.

And yet, here I go anyway!\n\nI'll admit: I had a very \"meh\" experience my first time here. The coffee was fine, but I wasn't blown away. This \"meh\" was probably colored by the fact that I revealed it was my first time at Philz... and then was sorta spoken to like I'd never had a cup of coffee before. Given all the woo-hoos of friends and yelpers alike, I decided to try it again, and I'm glad I did. I think the barista you get makes a big difference, but it's not like you have a choice about who calls you up. \n\nGranted, Philz takes a bit of getting used to. You order, then pay. And it's not like you just say, \"I'll have a mocha\" (or whatever), then move on. You choose your roast and blend, decide if you want it with milk or with sweet, and then they make the whole thing for you. In that respect, it's sort of like ordering at a bar. If you don't know what you want, you may sit there for a second and ponder... all the while phearing that you may be holding up the line. But the good thing is, the phine pholks at Philz are happy to make recommendations. \n\nEventually, trying out the different roasts gets to be kind of fun. So far, I've tried Code 33, Philharmonic, Ambrosia, New Manhattan, and a couple of others.  As someone else mentioned, I do kind of prefer it with the milk. But, I realize that's a bit of a heresy among some hardcore coffee drinkers, so let's put it this way: Philz coffee seems to be designed to pair nicely with milk, but it can be enjoyed nicely on its own as well.\n\nPRO TIP 1: Even if the line's out the door, it may not actually take that long to get your coffee. The line sticks out because it starts kinda far back from the counter.\n\nPRO TIP 2: Ask your \"coffee-maker\" to make you his or her favorite drink. It's fun to explore their menu this way, and you're sure to try something that you wouldn't have thought of yourself!", "author": "Tami S."}

I never thought I'd make a stop here for coffee until I walked over from Caltrain Station today. This is the second Philz location I've been to since I went to their location on 24th & Folsom back in September. I didn't think I would actually be able to taste a cup of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee here in SF until I started going to Philz. From my coffee shop experiences, Philz Coffee is the one coffee shop with Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee available.

If you are looking for a coffee shop to order a cup of Jamaica Blue Mountain, then Philz is the answer.\n\n11/28/2012\nI came in today and ordered a small hot chocolate with medium sweetness. Friendly baristas and some of the customers here are friendly as well. My favorite beverage items here are the Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee and Hot Chocolate. I love the design of Philz Coffee cups, paper sleeves are not needed. All you need is the cap on your beverage and you're good to go. This is my third time coming to Philz Coffee; the members behind the counter are very friendly. I don't recall having a bad experience at Philz so I'll definitely come back.\n\n11/29/2012\nToday is my third going to Philz Coffee at Berry St and I love it. I ordered a Turkey Sausage Breakfast Sandwich and a Large Hot Chocolate when I came in here today. Someday, I'm going to make a stop here to try their breakfast burritos.

I said I will order a Mint Mojito Iced Coffee and a Breakfast Burrito when I go to Philz, so I did and I am loving it.

My first impression is what lowered my rating from a 5 to a 4. If you're a local, you know how this place works. But walking off the street as a stranger, it wasn't clear, and I find that frustrating as a traveler (I travel 100% of my life).  \n\nHere's what you need to know:  The cashier line may be empty, don't approach until you have your drink ordered. There IS a line to order from (because of the way it's laid out, if you are like me, you may think it was people waiting for their coffee). They are actually in line to give their order. Get in that line, Philz is busy. Once you give your order, you go to the cashier & let him/her know what you ordered. The cashier is also where you put in your food orders. Your barista that took your order will also be the one that calls out your coffee order when it's ready. Keep an eye on that person. \n\nMy order was simple, I like my coffee like my granny made it with lots of cream & sugar. Trusting someone else to get the proportions right is unnerving, but my barista nailed it!  The coffee was full flavored without being bitter. It was delightful creamy & sweet. \n\nI also ordered oatmeal. It was pre packaged Umqua Oats, but not bad at all.

Every time I go this Philz, I walk in grumpy and stressed, and in a matter of minutes I walk out transformed, smiling with some pep in my step.\n\nThey're also dog-friendly! How cute is that. The signs around the shop remind you to keep your pups outside, but they have a big jar of dog treats at the register, dog bowls outside, and little dog decor around the shop. :) Who doesn't like seeing some happy puppies in the morning.\n\nI also come here for BREAKFAST BURRITOS. If you haven't tried one of their sausage or green chili breakfast burritos, you must. They're delicious, and they toast it up for you in the oven beforehand so it's nice and hot and cheesy on the inside with a crunchy tortilla on the outside. It may not look very big, but all those cheese, eggs, and potatoes will fill you up for sure!\n\nLove Philz!!", "author": "Stephanie P."}

I went to the register in shock with an \"OH NO, OMG\" expression, and they immediately handed me a fat stack of napkins and a towel while offering to give me a free Mint Mojito... Uhh, I definitely didn't deserve this. It was my fault for spilling that shit everywhere, resulting in a lake of sweet & creamy goodness by the entrance. And there was a decent amount left in that cup for me to slurp. Yet they insisted they'd give me the free drink. \n\nI smelled like Mint Mojito the rest of the afternoon, but I didn't really care because 1) everyone later said I smelled good for some reason; and 2) the staff just made my day for being so quick and responsive, saving me from even more awkwardness/embarrassment. I mean, imagine me just standing next to the puddle not knowing where to put my hands, while a stereotypical snooty barista guffaws and continues to clean up my mess with a condescending \"wow\" death stare. (Something I expected, since a similar reaction has happened to me before... but thankfully, a reaction that did not repeat itself in today's mishap.) \n\nOverall the whole staff were super friendly, & I just love the small, cozy vibe of this particular Philz... Not to mention, it's right across the metro and near AT&T park and tons of other hot spots, so the location is pretty ideal. \n\nDidn't get to catch their names, but to everyone who worked today at 2:30 to 3pm-ish, thank you. :)", "author": "Valerie F."}

Our first experience back in June was a little rocky, though. If you haven't been to a Philz Coffee before, the set-up is a little different. You wait in line until one of the baristas calls you, and you place your order. I was a little taken aback when they asked how I wanted my coffee, as I am used to adding my own sugar and cream. What does \"light\" or \"medium\" mean anyway? After you place your order, you have to walk over the to the register to pay --- however, no one is actually checking that you pay for your coffee so I'm sure people have gotten away with free coffee here! We ordered a couple warm breakfast sandwiches, and again, no one asks for your name or any identifying feature.\n\nSo, of course, there's quite a bit of confusion when there are a lot of people in the shop (which is often). You don't know if it's YOUR medium Philtered Soul with light cream up on the bar or if it's someone else's. Additionally, people who ordered after you can snatch up your breakfast sandwich, no questions asked. Or actually, they can snatch it up even if they didn't even order it. That's what happened to my husband's breakfast burrito. We kept waiting and waiting, and it turns out someone took his burrito so they had to heat up another one, but only after we inquired about where it was.\n\nThe coffee is good, but the cream can be a little heavy, even if you ask for \"light\" --- I've stopped asking the baristas to sweeten it because \"light\" always ends up too sweet for my taste. I really wish that I could add the sugar and cream myself. All in all, I'll still come here because it's our closest coffee shop and the coffee is pretty delicious, but I don't like the set-up of this business. We also decided not to order any food that needs warming up ever again, especially when the place is packed and chaotic. Once we use up all our existing coffee beans, we'll definitely be buying our own Philtered Soul to use with our Chemex to avoid the awkward set-up.

My favorite, coming highly suggested from a friendly local, was Tesora, a medium-roast with nutty tones and a smooth finish.\n\nThe process here was understood, the lines were consistently manageable, and customers always seemed content with their individually filtered drips.

Lately, I've taken to a certain appreciation for mojitos, especially in hot weather, so I ordered the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee.\n\nNow, I cannot vouch for the quality of the coffee alone, but I consider that a good thing. The combination of milk, mint, coffee and ice in this beverage is proportioned to a heavenly standard. I have never tasted anything so deliciously refreshing. Go and taste one -- you will never have had anything like it. There were enough fresh mint leaves in the cup that I could take a couple out and chew on them to freshen my breath.\n\nIn my mind and to my body, the mint-coffee-milk-ice combination is absolutely perfect. Caffeine takes a solid 15 minutes to kick in. If you have a hot coffee, the stimulant properties of the drink is even more muted. The ice takes care of that -- the drink is immediately refreshing and cold. The mint adds another layer of freshness. The milk rounds out the entire experience. What results is an wonderfully balanced refreshing beverage that elevates your consciousness to a place of blissful zen focus. \n\nYou will never forget it.\n\nThe wifi is also blazing fast.

If you're unsure, I recommend starting the sugar and milk off light, then when you pick it up, the lid is off so that you can take a sip to see if you like it. More sugar? Sure! More milk/creamer. Sure! If not, ask for their recommendation and you end up with something the majority likes. I came back the second morning with a similar experience. I like that they read into your body language as opposed to rushing you through the process and assuming you're an avid coffee drinker. Sure I know what I want at Starbucks almost every time, but not all coffee is made the same and I'm no expert. \n\nLine was long both days, but it's just a little more wait to have your coffee freshly brewed and line goes faster than you'd think because they have between 3-4 people making the coffee (cashier separate).

A sprig of mint in the Turkish sent my olfactory senses into overdrive and my taste buds salivating. The coffee was magnificent.  The temperature perfect. The paper cup designed as the perfect vessel to hold such liquid gold.

A bit chilly though with the wind blowing off the bay. \n\nHere's my biggest mistake...instead of sitting down at the available chair and table, I decided to continue my drive home...Southbound on the 101 then 280, I achieved caffeine induced speeds which turned my GPS speedo red.

When I finally got my drink I had to go so I couldn't taste it to know if it was made right. It was a cup of VERY WEAK coffee. He put extreme amounts of ice and chunks of sugar on the bottom. Not enough cream which pairs terribly with a drink that barely resembles coffee. I had to toss my drink after getting home without even drinking a quarter of it. This drink is a $5 cup of coffee and I feel ripped off. Come on, care about the quality of your product or/and get better baristas!", "author": "Pony R."}

I've tasted just about every blend on their menu (back when I used to frequent the 24th and Folsom location more) and Phil has even treated me to secret blends he's made that aren't public yet! \n\nAfter trying all the blends, I've gone through different flavor phases coming here. There was a phase where all I drank was Jacobs. Then it became a Tesora phase, a Four Great Horses phase, and currently I'm consuming Philtered Souls like crazy. \n\nPhil is incredible.

The $3.25 blend beverage, which is equivalent to a medium-strength blend, was prepared fresh in a filter to drain the fresh coffee-grounds directly into Matt's approaching cup. Just by reading Matt's review, you can easily tell that the cup of coffee is extremely fresh, unlike some of the places that have their coffee sitting in carafe or a pot for a long extended time. \n\nAlthough the coffee is off the record classified as Medium-strength, it sure was compelling enough to make Matt dance to any slow song on KOIT. He also topped off his breakfast with $2.00 flakey Almond Croissant. \n\nThe newest Philz location also sells Coffee beans, tees, caps and Mr. Jaber's famous brimmed hat.

You know, when you sit down, sip, and \"ah\" involuntarily. I had the Anesthesia To The Upside. \n\nI was confused walking in, not knowing where I order and paid and in which order. I walked up to a drip station and the guy working there was more than happy to walk me through their blends as a first timer. Then I went to the register and paid. The process was different, but doesn't deter from the experience. \n\nIf there were more of these closer to me, I'd make trips to Philz more frequently. Are they worth the hype? Perhaps.

I was trying to order at the register, silly me, and that is where what COULD have been a nightmare - where it not for the excellent staff - started.\n\nA fellow standing behind my cashier (The Manager?) noticed what was going on, and stepped in. \"I don't think he ordered with a barrista.\" Then the guy - Rob, I think was his name - guided me over to the barristas, where you are supposed to order. When I mentioned I was looking for a Vegan hot chocolate (fingers crossed) he knew enough to check the cocoa powder for milk ingredients. \n\nHe then made my drink himself while I spaced off thinking about work. When a barrista called out \"Hot Chocolate!\" and nobody stepped up to the counter immediately, I thought perhaps he had handed my drink off to her. When I tried to ask if my drink was the one she had just put on the counter, she was gracious and helpful in informing me that the drink would come from the person I ordered with.\n\nLike I said, I've avoided going to Philz coffee in the past, but this one has the kind of staff that just might get me over the hump when it comes to becoming familiar with how things work - especially now that I know I can get an EXCELLENT vegan hot cocoa. ^_^", "author": "Jonah P."}

I don't think you could ever go wrong with this drink.\n\nTips: This Philz has less seating than the ones on Van Ness or the Mission, and the set up is more reticent of a coffee store in the suburbs. However, there IS a TV, which is kind of cool since I'm pretty sure they only installed it so that people could watch the game (this Philz is super close to the baseball park!)", "author": "Melody L."}

It was convenient because it was down the street from AT&T Ball Park.  She always posts pictures and raves about the Mojito Coffee.  I just want to make this clear; it is not an alcoholic drink...insert sad face.  None the less, it was an amazing cup of coffee.  The coffee was fresh and it had a great flavor to it.  The mint was quite intriguing, in a good way.  I rarely go to specialty coffee shops, so this was a treat for me.  Another great thing about this place is that it is very pet friendly.  We waited for almost 20 minutes to get a cup because the line was out the door.  Would I do it again? Heck yeah.

Every visit was pleasant in it's own way. The baristas are very welcoming and entertaining. Even though there are rushes which can lead to a line going out the door, one can find entertainment in watching the baristas dance or sing while they are making drinks. When the employees are having fun working, it just creates such a positive and welcoming atmosphere. The coffee never disappoints either. The iced mint mojito lives up to the hype. There's nothing better than having an iced coffee with mint, sweet and creamy (especially on the rare hot days in SF). Philtered Soul, Silken Splendor, Sumatra, and the Tesora are my go to blends. I usually get my coffee sweet and creamy but sometimes I feel bold enough to order my coffee with vanilla soy and honey which makes all the difference. The Chamomile tea is amazing too (especially with extra honey). Even though all the baristas in this Philz are amazing, my go to baristas are Puka and Abby.

It tastes just as good as it looks. \nThe coffee is strong, bold and rich when you first start but the type of cream they use makes this lovely blend and it smoothes out the coffee. Once the cream hits then you can feel the vibrant taste of the fresh mint they use that adds that pop of flavor. This coffee is unlike any other and I have not found any other place that makes a mint mojito iced coffee or an iced coffee as good as this.  \n\nI think if you do not like coffee, that this will definitely open your tastebuds to enjoy coffee.", "author": "Kristina L."}

I wish I had known sooner about the uniqueness of this coffee shop.\n\nI love my coffee, but since I drink it daily, I usually want to opt for espresso when I go to shops - when I looked at the menu, I uttered \"uh babe, they don't have an espresso menu...\"  I thought, interesting...\n\nThe girl who was working was very helpful - we each told her what we liked and what we didn't, and she chose very appropriate blends for the each of us. For me, I told her I wanted strong, dark, and similar to African blends - she chose the Ecstatic for me, which I loved.. for the boyfriend he likes Caramel Macchiato type drinks - I tried his, and she made it taste just like one, although when it comes to sweet coffee, no thank you for me, but it did taste great.\n\nWhile we were waiting, I realized the coffee took a few minutes - so I nosily peeked behind the bar and realized that they do hand drip. I was very excited to see this and after asking the barista, I also found out that they grind the beans to order and drip to order. LOVE! I used to work at a coffee shop where we carried and brewed Blue Bottle, and that's when I learned all about grinding beans to order and hand dripped coffee. And it makes a world of a difference.\n\nTo sum it up - great, friendly, attentive, informative service; delicious coffee; laidback environment.

I've gone to this location about 5 times now and 5 out of those 5 times I have yet to receive a warm welcome from the employees.

Of course, I wanted to study the menu so I'd know what to order. HOWEVER, the baristas kept yelling \"I can help who's next\" when clearly, there was no one else there but me.  Again one would yell, \"I can help who's next\" as if they were implying \"hurry up and order\" or something. I felt rushed so I bought I drink I didn't really like. \n\nThe next time I went in, I decided to go with the mint mojito that everyone kept talking about. I walk up to one of the baristas and ask for a mint mojito. I could've sworn he rolled his eyes at me. Seriously! That made me feel like I ordered a drink that was such a nuisance to make. \n\nOverall the coffee makes up for the lack of service in this location.

That one day changed my life.\n\nIt was a beautiful, sunny Fall day amongst friends. Friends that had much to say about this one coffee spot by the ballpark. I was very intrigued, because these are friends I never thought would be coffee drinkers. They were talking about how good it is, how friendly the service is, and how much they crave it now. Wow!\n\nWe stopped in right before noon on a Sunday. There weren't many customers in at the time. That gave me some time to decide. There were so many roasts to choose from. Thankfully, they had a board with descriptions of what each roast had to offer. That still didn't help me! I wanted to try it all. That's when I decided to tell the barista, (who was patiently waiting with a smile) that I was new to Philz and what she'd recommend. I told her how I like my coffee. She gave me the whole spiel on Philz coffee, and then recommended Jacob's Wonderbar Brew. Sounds good! After about 2-3 minutes, my drink was ready. She asked me to taste it to make sure it was good. It was perfect! Just the right amount of sugar, and definitely flavorful! It didn't even burn my tongue, as I thought it would. At that moment, I could've sworn I heard a harmonious song.\n\nI sipped slowly to enjoy all the subtleties. Ahhh..         \n\nThis is how my coffee drinking life has changed. I now come to Philz to try a different roast every time. They're all really good. When I don't have Philz, I have to \"settle\" for something else. I come from San Mateo just for it. Addicted? Maybe. You can call me a PHILevangelist.\n\nI highly recommend Philz Coffee. Oh, and as it says on the cup.. Tell A Friend.", "author": "McWendell R."}

And even though the last sip is a bit unpleasant (read: grimy)... the rest is just so damn good you won't care. They usually put cream and sugar in the iced coffees so make sure you specify. I usually take just a little cream in my coffee but the gingersnap needs a little sugar too. It really is a treat! \n\nOh and I tried their turkey sausage breakfast sandwiches and they are actually very good (pepperjack cheese? yes please). Too bad they don't have ketchup. (Is ketchup on eggs an east coast thing?)\n\nAs for regular coffee... I really like the Ambrosia blend. \n\nI also like the Tesora, Canopy of Heaven, Silken Splendor... and probably anything else I get around to trying after they discontinue the gingersnap and break my heart.

I was actually pumped that I was finally trying the much-hyped PHILZ.\n\nI was stunned, literally, when I couldn't make in the doorway because of the line of customers waiting to order at 3pm this afternoon.  This really made me think that the I've been such an idiot for my love of Sight Glass, Farley's & Equator Coffee all these years...seemed to me that the crowd at Philz should have been an indicator of an amazing coffee experience.\n\nI'm a regular latte, cafe a lait, or cappuccino drinker.  Espresso and HOT milk.  That's all I'm really after.  No sugar, no fuss.  Just espresso and HOT milk.\n\nI was told:  No espresso (even though it was on the menu?).  No hot milk.\n\nI explained that I NEED hot milk.  I even own a one-hundred dollar electric hot-milk-maker-thingy at home because I NEED hot milk.  No luck.  \n\nThe \"coffee maker dude\" (not an actual \"barista\"...because barista's actually pull a shot of espresso) suggested that he'll make me something great.  Insisting that they prefer to \"shake\" the milk which is promised to be a superior experience to my beloved HOT milk.\n\nAfter a long, LONG wait.  I ended up with a strong, STRONG cup of coffee.  SO STRONG in fact, that I couldn't drink it and brought it home so that I can warm it up with some DAMN HOT MILK tomorrow morning to make it drinkable.\n\nI am utterly stunned that this institution is gaining serious momentum in the marketplace.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for tipping my hat to any business that is thriving in this economy.  But I am sincerely shocked that in our \"have it your way\" society this place is thriving.\n\nSimply:  Not for me.", "author": "Stacey M."}

My all time favorite is the greater alarm, it has the most caffeine.  I also really like the soo good.  I like this location because it is right by the ballpark and about 5 minutes form work.  A major negative though is the parking around there is very limited and metered.  The space is nice, but not big enough for the demand.  I wish they had one big table down the middle.  It always seems to be cold in there too.  Despite all that, the main attraction of course is the coffee!  I go there to get my beans too and I make it at work every day since I cannot always get there.  I also got to the Berkeley location, which I love!  I so wish there was one right next to my office and one in the Walnut Creek area because then I would go more often.  If you are a coffee drinker, then it is a must!  You have to go and try it!!  Even if you aren't, maybe you can be converted.  I do beleive they have some teas and decaffeinated options for those of you who don't like coffee or are sensitrive to caffine, but who doesnt like coffee, thats crazy!!

I was sorely disappointing and couldn't figure out why...until i visited Philz Coffee themselves! \n\nI visited Philz after the Hunger Bowl and my impression totally changed. \nFirst, they offer like 30 something blends with helpful descriptions plastered around their store. I ordered the famous medium roast Tesora, at the recommendation of my friend. \n\nSecond, they ground each cup fresh and brew it through their special filtering process. What was supposed to be just a simple cup of coffee turned out to be a frothy smooth and aromatically/tastfully strong cup of coffee- enough to waken the senses after a long day but not so bitter that it tastes like Starbucks. \n\nThird, I figured out why my home brew tasted so bad. I asked the staff how they brew their coffee and told them how my home brew came out so bland. The girl at the counter asked me a bunch of questions and we determined that I wasn't grinding the beans fine enough. NOTE TO PEOPLE BUYING THE COFFEE FOR HOME: Do a fine grind on the beans, not medium coarse or coarse. That's how much they grind it at Philz. \n\nThank you Philz! I'm excited to try their dark roast blends now that I believe in their flavor.

Both places had great coffee but I still needed a lot of cream and sugar to put it in that excellent category.  Not with Philz Coffee...serve that stuff black to taste the smoothness, then add just a little sugar and cream to taste.  These folks are coffee experts.   When you walk in, they know if you are a regular or not, I obviously wasn't.  So the barista explained to me the various coffees they served and asked if I wanted to try any flavors.  After deciding on \"So Good\", she made it right in front of me and then asked me to try it to make sure I liked it.  No one at starbucks does that, ever.  The coffee was excellent.  It didn't have that gross acidic aftertaste that most coffee has.  It had the caffeine buzz of authentic Turkish coffee without the sludge at the bottom.\n\nWhat I like about Philz is that they don't try to be a jack of all trades, they just do one thing and do it well....Coffee (heh, and tea I guess).

A TV with ESPN hung in the corner and there were comfortable couches and arm chairs full of people typing away at emails and reading their morning Bloomberg business reports.  On a shelf lay some books and board games, indicating that things slow down at some point for a casual hang out.\n\nThe burrito was microwaved and surprisingly sufficient, while the tea was perfectly balanced and ordinary.

I was down with their model of \"make while you wait\" and I was even down with the chaotic service factor. A good cup of coffee is worth it. The line was decently long but the coffee didn't take long to make. I asked for the best brew they're known for...black, in a small. They recommended the \"Tesora\". I have to say I wasn't impressed at all. It was too hot, too acidic and lacked all the complexity of what the description had to bear. \n\nI'm a fan of a good blend and a company that takes pride in their blends. To me, this is what makes a great coffee company. I liked that they take pride in their process. Aerating it before serving is truly a good way to get to know a cup of good coffee. \n\nUnfortunately my Tesora tasted like anything you could get from a french press with a darker than average blend made a little strong. Neither the process nor the blend seemed necessary for what I tasted. Even the cup was reminiscent of something you'd get at costco. \n\nIf you insist on Philz blends, you're better off going the french press route and doing it yourself in a mug. Definitely not worth the time or the hype to get a cup to order. (to me) Fortunately there are plenty of companies in SF that take pride in their coffee. I would encourage anyone looking for their perfect cup to keep looking, there is definitely better and there's not much that Philz does you couldn't do yourself in your cube. \n\nI realize I'm only going off of one blend. I'd try others, but not not in a hurry to go back any time soon.

I ordered a 1/2 decaf/regular and was amazed that they grind the beans and brew it right in front of you.  They actually put the cream and sugar in it for you which was a little strange, but then when I tasted it. Wow. Amazing coffee.

I wanted to mix blends but the barista suggested that that was a \"pro move\" so I settled on Julie's Ultimate - light cream and sugar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-06", "description": "I moved back to the San Francisco Bay area a few weeks ago, after having spent a few years in a degree program in New York City. Living in Manhattan's Canyons of Steel felt a bit like living on Trantor - or Coruscant, for those who prefer their space opera on celluloid, not cellulose - with everything else existing out in the galactic hinterlands. I know better, of course, having felt the same way in other places I've lived, e.g. Tokyo and London. I speculate there's a psychological dynamic at play here akin to placing one's self in the \"center\" of an inflationary universe: anywhere the observer stands is the center. \n\nThe One Thing I really missed about San Francisco's food scene was the apparent superabundance of good coffee shops where I could feel perfectly at home nursing a cup of decent coffee for a few hours with a good book or a laptop. Yes, there are \"coffee shops\" in Manhattan, but no, you can't really dawdle for hours in the ones that serve the Good Stuff, can't park it without molestation. And that's OK, it's consonant with New Yorkian charm, but it's not \"coffee culture\" in a more informed sense of the phenomenon. Like truly good Mexican restaurants in NYC, or simians in the Bois de Boulogne of Eddie Izzard's \"Le singe est sur la branche\" standup sketch, it's \"monkeys: thin on the ground.\"\n\nSo, where was I? Oh, yeah: genuinely good coffee in a place I can treat as an office of sorts. Philz is a place like that. On my first visit, I immediately laid it out to the counter help: \"So, hey, first timer here. Heard of this place, read the reviews, wanna try, hit me with something you guess I might like,\" to which the java slinger immediately replied, \"Tesora. I think you might like the Tesora. Give it a try?\" I did, and loved it. And I admit that I was a bit tickled simply by the brewing arrangement, which resembles nothing less than one might imagine the prototyping lab for Keurig's K-cup, a slightly-messy profusion of individual ground-holding blotter filters capping the individual cups. \n\nScrew Tyler Durden: these are *my* kind of Single Serving Friends.\n\nI would give this place 5 stars if they were graced with the facilities and pasty selection of the nearby The Creamery, but otherwise, I'm cool with their oddly sterile location across from China Basin. Not being personally acquainted with the shop's history, I'm guessing from clues around the physical plant that they've been elsewhere in the course of a few years, and the present location is the latest enclosure for an enterprise of genuinely long standing. The \"free\" internet access is decent. The staff are helpful and they seem to love their craft. If you're near the Caltrain terminus, consider dropping in on them. Order a Tesora and chat up the charming girl with the tattoo of a caffeine molecule on her arm.", "author": "Russell W."}

However, the coffee here is a step up from the rot gut that you would get at any other chain establishment. With savory and sweet treats like the Philtered Soul and bold and crisp knockouts like the Ether, Philz has a bunch of roasts to accommodate everyone. All of them have lovely flavors and different personalities, but there's little to separate Philz from the rest: great coffee, but standard fare.\n\nMy personal favorites are the Philtered Soul and the Mocha Tesora. Make sure you ask for medium sugar and medium cream at most. You don't want to drown out the nice chocolate flavors in either of those drinks. The Philtered Soul is lighter than the Mocha Tesora, but both give a nice nut+chocolate combo. It's almost like Philz somehow extracted the essence of Nutella and put it into their coffee.

The guys who work here really know their stuff and they don't get annoyed when you enter and are overwhelmed with all their coffee choices, and they don't turn up their noses at you when you really can't say what you want in a coffee other than something that tastes good.\n\nWhich isn't too difficult to satisfy at Philz.  Their coffee tastes fantastic!  I've never drank a cup of coffee and been amazed before.  Usually, it's like, yeah, this is coffee.  Now it's like, yeah, this is REALLY coffee and the taste buds light up.  I guess it's my coffee moment or coffee epiphany.\n\nThey make it drip style using a paper filter and will ask you ahead of time whether you want cream or sugar and how much.  Then after making your coffee they'll ask you to taste it to make sure you like it.\n\nI feel like Philz must be the big brother of the Orbit Room or something.", "author": "Jean K."}

How about...\n\nPerhaps you didn't know this, as I only recently learned this after being a regular (as in at least once each day) for 18 months.\n\nThe light roasts have more caffeine than the dark roasts.  The beans lose caffeine during the roasting process.  The darker roasts, having been roasted longer, therefore have less caffeine.  \n\nThat was counter-intuitive - to me, anyway.  I always associated dark coffee with strong coffee.  Turns out that was false.\n\nThe Soooo Good thus has a lot of pop.  On flavor profile alone, however, I prefer the Turkish.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I had my first Iced Mint Mojito - now one of my regular orders.  The \"mojito\" is good even if you make it diet-friendly.  The baristas make it with cream and sugar, but I order my large sans cream, and 3 splendas.  A fantastic drink.\n\nOne more tip: You can buy this 24 oz. mug from Philz for $16 (or so).  They'll fill it up for you, while charging you the price of a small.\n\nIf, like me, you stop by daily: You'll have the mug \"paid off\" in a month or so.  Since its plastic, it won't break, either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-28", "description": "If you like inconsistent coffee, long waits, and paying 2x as much as SBUX come here!!!\n\nSo, I've had a dozen or so coffees from philz over the past few weeks because it is close to the jobby job and although the concept is compelling it doesn't really work. Each barista will make your coffee different than the rest. This is particularly the case if you like a little sugar in your coffee because everyone seems to have different concepts of \"medium sweet\". You are better off adding the accoutrements yourself (at the risk of offending them). The only way around this inconsistency is to try to order from the same barista every time, but even this has inherent variability when you are talking about hand-made anything. The only way to REALLY have a consistent single brew is the Starbucks Clover system which is amazing, but still isn't available at all locations. Clover coffees are only a couple dimes more expensive than their regular drip which is pretty great. \n\nLines can form quickly (right out the door by 9am at this location) and you can wait a long time to checkout as baristas often double as cashiers.  Today, the wait was quite long and the barista seemed flustered and put cream in my coffee when I had asked for none.\n\nThe good news is that they have nice comfy sofas, free wifi, a plasma TV for sports, and people have generally been nice. Also, about 20% of the time when they get things perfect the coffee is heavenly. But at this price-point, I will take SBUX (fast and consistent for the past 18 years I've been addicted to coffee) over Philz anyday.\n\nCandy C. is right that the menu can be absolutely intimidating to the first time visitor and they could do a lot more to orient newbies with better customer service, maybe a little cheat sheet \"how-to\" menu, and clearer instructions/signage on where to line up to order. It is ironic they would make fun of Starbuxians when SBUX made Philz possible to exist at all. \n\nFrankly, and this may come as good news to locals, the Philz concept is unlikely to be able to scale the way Petes and SBUX have for the above reasons so there is probably little chance they will ever become a successful corporate behemoth and spread around Cali or the country. \n\nBottom line... I'll still come here on occasion if I am walking by and crave a brew and have $3-4 to spare, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.", "author": "Shawn C."}

It really was one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had, and the end user experience is incredibly positive (these are baristas who've had some training in the coffees they pour, how they're made, what they taste like, etc), and so on.\n\nBut at $3.25 for a large coffee, we're getting close to doubling my usual coffee splurge, which is the $1.95 large over at Peet's.\n\nLook, the experience of eating, of drinking, hell, of jerking off... these are all experiences which can be refined.  They can be elevated and taken somewhere new and, frankly, more enjoyable.\n\nBut there's a price to be paid for this enhanced experience, and it's always a larger pile of coin.\n\nI just can't do it.\n\nOrganic produce, heritage beef, free range chickens, I mean FUCK, it just goes on and on.

No, I'm not talking about lattes, and cappuccinos that use the same coffee with different combination of other ingredients. This place has a billion different whole bean coffee blends you can have made into a glorious cup of coffee. (okay, maybe not a billion, but there's a lot) It's a coffee lovers dream!\n\nOn top of that, the baristas are really friendly and passionate about what they do. If you don't know what blend of coffee to get, ask them to suggest one. Then they'll grind the beans for your cup, filter it by hand -- not WITH their hand -- and ask you to try it and let them know if you like it. You don't get that level of service, well, anywhere.\n\nThis is a perfect first stop after you get off the caltrain.\n\nPlus, there are fedoras!\n\nI tried the philtered soul (AKA #16) and was really blown away. I'm used to coffee having a hint of flavor, but this one packed a punch of nuts and hazelnut. I had to go up and ask the guy behind the counter if it had syrup or other flavoring in it. Nope, that was just the flavor of the pure, black, unadulterated beans. So I bought a 1/2lb of it to give to my parents, which are bigger coffee snobs than I.\n\nPlus all their coffee comes from shade grown sources. Why is that important? Well I'll tell you. Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, after oil, and it is wreaking havoc on rain forests which are being clear cut to increase production. Shade Grown means that the coffee is grown in the traditional manner, under the shade of the natural tree canopies and does NOT destroy the surrounding forests (http://bit.ly/P6BSh). Fair trade is good for the farmers, BUT shade grown is good for the environment. Always ask your barista if the coffee they serve is certified Shade Grown!", "author": "Jeremy G."}

(For the record I was a barista in the US and have travelled to Turkey, Israel, France, Italy to name just a few, and tried several styles of coffee).  I must say Philz is like no other!  the cardamon and other spices added really bring on flavors both subtle and robust.  I love the way the baristas shake the milks to prepare a distinct latte-like froth and use sweetening agents to your liking.  I've tried all sorts of coffees and teas at Philz, and I loved them all for different reasons and drink them on different occasions.  \n\nWith that being said, not all Philz are created equal.  \n\nI started as a regular at the Mission District location and the ambiance and staff's attitudes are quintessential San Francisco: lax, friendly, inviting, and all around enjoyable with a bit hippy dippy to follow suit.  Then I moved and had to find a new Philz.  That one is now the SOMA location.  The ambiance is a lot less distinct with it's corporate-style coffee house decor, which makes sense considering it's closer to the financial district and the customers might be less hipstery and more young-urban-professionals.  On another note, it's sad to admit and report that the quality control and barista attitudes aren't as regulated here.  Sometimes the coffees are phenomenal and at other times they're watered down depending on the barista.  In the same regard, the staff's attitudes sometimes comes with genuine generosity and others are nothing but sour-faced or snobby.  \n\nThe potential is there as long as the staff receives a little more training.  I continue as a regular because I'm willing to gamble to get that perfect coffee that I've randomly received at the SOMA location.  Nothing is perfect, but I'm just saying this Philz may have some things to work on to become a 5-star joint from this regular.", "author": "N F."}

I don't not know the difference between an expresso or cappucino...nor did I ever care to...but coming to Philz has changed all of that.\n\nI have always winced taking a sip of black coffee from Starbucks, Coffee Bean, and only God knows where. To me, coffee emits only one flavor...and that is bitterness--that, and I can feel it decreasing the pH in my stomach. But at Philz, coffee doesn't taste like burnt water.  Instead, their wide selection of coffee, hints at notes of hazelnut, chocolate...and so much more. \n\nRecommendations:\n\n+Philtered Soul, since that is what they recommend to coffee noobs. Extremely delicious, especially with the cream-sugar-mixture they pour on top. Coffee has low acidity, which is great since it doesn't drive my stomach too crazy. Medium Roast, which means it has quite a bit of caffeine in it, but not as crazy as the light roast!!\n\n\nSigh, I regret giving my coffee maker away (I bought it on sale and gave it away thinking that I would never ever buy coffee).

You can let the barista (is that a crime to use the S* word in a Philz review?) know how sweet or creamy you want it. For example we both wanted light on the sugar.

Just don't come here. Because it is so amazing, so life changing, so mind blowingly awesome, that if you can't have it daily, its not worth knowing that it exists. \n\nWe were told to come here by a friend who doesn't like coffee. We, who are addicted to all things caffeninated , were not hard to convince. You walk in and the menu is immediately overwhelming. But FEAR NOT! The baristas and other employees are totally sold on their product and willing to sell you too. \n\nWe had, on our first visit, the Jacob's Wonderbar Brew (me) and the Tantalizing Turkish (him). I was a little scared, so I asked my barista to add a tiny bit of milk. She knew exactly what I wanted and created for me, a brew of the greatest perfection. It was cool enough to drink immediately, but warm enough that I could taste exactly what it is that makes this Philz most popular choice. My BF is vehemently opposed to ANYTHING in his coffee and so had it black. \n\nThe cool thing about ordering coffee black at Philz is that they make it so that there is a foamy fabulousness on top. The purpose of this is for you to taste the coffee before you taste the coffee. You swirl the (cooler than the real thing) foam in your mouth to ready your taste buds for the rest of your drink. This keeps the brew from tasting bitter. \n\nOn top of the fabulous coffee, they also have the typical San Fran spread of vegan delicacies. Additionally they have (at the Mission Bay store) a set of burritos. We had one on Thursday, the bacon burrito. They nuked it, perfectly, so that the bacon, cheese, potatoes, herbs, etc, were just ... perfect. This is part of the reason we came back the next day. This time we got the Ancho Chili burrito, which was pretty much the same as before - delicious - except sub ancho chili for bacon. They also had a black bean burrito, which even my carnivorous boyfriend would have gotten if we had one more morning in San Fran. \n\nI got back to Maryland and posted on Facebook how sad I was to drink Folgers again, after two days of Philz. And I had no less than 7 positive comments from locals who had visited Cali and also miss Philz.", "author": "Beth K."}

Very patiently.\nAfter total of 5-7 minutes of being the FIRST in line, one of the \"baristas\" for lack of a better term calls forward the guy in line behind me and takes his order.  Apparently the \"barista\" knows the guy that was behind me and thought it appropriate to serve him before me.  The barista in this case was some young, tall, Latino / Asian guy with one of those annoying, dumb smiles.  \nComplete lack of customer service.  Maybe he knew that guy drops fat tips all the time and was trying to get him for the tip, who knows, who cares.  \nPoor customer service.

They have a unique way of preparing tea..... I love tea a lot and my nails curled when I saw how they prepared it. I was so skeptical, even panicked a little. I tried to intervene (thinking back I am laughing), but they promised me all would be just fine. Guess what? Their tea is a bomb. Seriously. Absolutely amazing, rich flavor, and just simply good. Still today I have to hold myself back to beg them to do it the traditional way. But I am a dinosaur that way - they do great. \nHendrik, my husband loves their coffee. They don't prepare anything but regular drip coffee in different roasts and flavors. As you can see, I am not a coffee drinker.. But I trust my husband, who is.

That said, it comes as no surprise that Philz is getting a 5* review from me considering the enthusiastic and passionate staff. I've probably been to Philz about 4 times these past few months for my home coffee fix. I know what I like; I'm a medium girl who purchases whole beans and brews by the good ole fashion drip method. You'd think it would be simple enough to walk in, select a blend and be on my merry way. Well it is! But not without getting some quality schooling on Philz, their coffees and their blends! Personally, I love it! I'm a coffee enthusiast remember?! Every experience I've had here has made with walk away thinking about how great it is to encounter folks who really seem to enjoy their jobs and who don't just share a passion for a damn good product but who also enjoy educating the general public about the multifaceted dynamics of quality coffee. Yes, I'm a coffeek! I'm not ashamed!\n\nNow then, the blends. I am determined to get through their entire selection (Gasp!). I liked Anesthesia however Ambrosia didn't do a whole lot for me. I picked up a bag of Silky Smooth but  quickly returned it to the shelf once the sticker shock kicked in! $19 bucks for a lb of coffee? I'm sure it's good but I don't even know if I like it. I'm gonna have to hold off on that impulse buy this time around. \n\nOn my most recent visit, I was helped by yet another fantastic barista who took some time to go over a few options. \n\n\"How much do you like coffee?\" she asks. \n\"I LOVE coffee!\" I responded.\n\"How do you take your coffee?\" she asked. \n\"With soy milk and no sugar\" I replied \"so I prefer something smooth and balanced\". \n\"Great, then let me suggest New Manhattan, let me make you a sample.\"\n\nI HAVE FOUND MY NEW FAVORITE COFFEE! And that's a huge statement! And to top it off, it's a $17 a lb coffee (well worth every dollar) so that says something! The only thing that bums me out about this discovery is that I was looking forward to sampling other Philz blends which I still intend on doing. I just think it's going to be a while before I veer from New Manhattan but I'll get around to it. \n\nThanks Philz for your doing what you do so well and more importantly, hiring and training the right people with great, passionate & helpful attitudes!", "author": "alexa c."}

But then, to call these one-cup-at-a-time, hand-conjured potions \"coffee\" is like calling the sun a lightbulb.  Your tastebuds will be prostrate before the all-consuming flavor.  No surprise that they sell fedoras on their website--this is the kind of stuff I always pictured those hardcore Mods to be drinking in their Italian suits and motorscooters.\n\nAs for what kind of coffee to order, well I'm clearly out of my league here, but Philz recommends starting with the house blend, Tesora.  I tried out the Tesora Mocha and wow--it's like they fused the cocoa and coffee at the molecular level or something. \n\nPS, props for being one of the very first indie businesses in Mission Bay.

The cups were topped off with fresh mint ... a wonderfully delicious addition.  \n\nAfter we retired to drink our spicy elixirs, the barista returned to offer fresh, and FREE, bakalava samples for everyone in the shop.  Now, I am gluten intolerant, so that means I could not partake, and that there were no options for me to eat (hence the 1 star off)... but the gesture was not lost on me.

The coffee is what makes it so, not the ambiance or price or staff or parking or whatever, it is the coffee. Some cups are better than others, but make sure you try the Ether, Tesora, and Jacob's Wonder Brew. I make this part of my Saturday morning routine and (sadly?) look forward to it on Friday nights. \n\nOn the corner of 4th and Berry, this place isn't in the tourist area at all, so it is missed by many (though Philz has other SF locations). Is the place you went to in Athens that looked up at the Parthenon at sunrise better? Better olocation certainly, but I swear, not a better cup.\n\nThe baristas are friendly, talk it up with you, and make sure you try a sip before you move on. They handcraft each cup, so it takes a little time (or lovin'). It isn't too expensive and they are very green.

Your barista calls you back over when your drink is ready and even asks you to take a sip to see if it is exactly how you want it.  I thinkt that little touch is pretty good for the customer.

Starbucks and Peet's coffee just don't do it for me. \n\nThank goodness I found Philz. Each cup is individually brewed so it is always fresh and you can pick from a variety of beans. The list, albeit a little overwhelming, has something for everyone. They break out each bean by light, medium, dark and decaf - and have great descriptions so you know what you are getting. The staff is also always helpful if you don't know what to get. I tend to like my coffee light to medium, which is probably why I don't like most other coffee places in the city. They also put the cream and sugar in for you which for some reason always makes it taste better. I was also impressed because I have seen a barista remake a cup when a customer didn't think it came out right and they often offer to let you taste it to see if it needs anything else. These people value good coffee.\n\nI have tried the Sooooo Good (light), Philtered Soul (medium), New Manhattan (medium) and Ambrosia of the Gods (medium).  \n\nWhen I recently moved across the country from NYC my boyfriend met me at the airport with a bag of New Manhattan beans for my coffee pot.

This is great because I trust those Philz people to do it just right, depending on the bean, the size of the cup, and maybe even what they think I would like, just by looking at me.\n\nIt's never too busy. It's busy when I go in there, but not insanely busy, and I can get in and out in 5-10 minutes.\n\nThey do one thing and they do it well. Drip coffee.

I am much more of a tea drinker and it is almost always tea I brew myself.  Putting these two things together makes it so that my mouth easily burns when drinking scalding hot liquids.  I went about ordering my tea and things were looking good.  I asked for no sweeteners so it was really simple.  Then, when the guy handed me my tea, he said to try it to make sure it was ok.  Looking back, I should have just fake sipped it and said yes, as it really was just hot water and a tea bag, so there isn't much to screw up here, but I cracked under the pressure and took a real sip, and my tongue burned because of it.", "author": "Jason P."}

I like that they put the cream and sugar for me (and they use a lot of sugar-good for me-, and heavy whipping cream to give it that thickness, although sometimes I would like to add my own sugar and that's apparently not an option). The coffee is brewed a cup at a time, somewhat like Blue Bottle, except Philz uses a filter with more holes so the coffee comes out faster. I also think it tastes less strong than Blue Bottle perhaps because the water doesn't sit in the grinds as long. If you ask, they will pour it through a couple more times for you though. Interestingly, this is how they make \"espresso\" at Philz; pour the water once and the coffee three more times. No thanks, if I want espresso I want espresso. Call me a traditionalist.\nIn short, I still prefer Peet's for the taste and strength of the brew, but Philz is closer to home, has waaaay nicer seating, and the variety is kicking! The crazy girls that work here are absolutely insane and high on caffeeine all the time, which makes for some really fun conversation. \nMy one big complaint is the dessert selection. In all four times I have been here, the pastries all look like they fell off a truck two or three days ago then were put on a tray. I haven't tasted them and never will.

To me, it's inexcusable - if you have flies you have a hygiene problem... you throw all the produce away, disinfect the cabinet and restock. = no flies, unless the flies are coming from source - in which case get a different supplier!  It's actually pretty gross.\n\n***Their ice coffee sucks***\nThe downside of making 'one cup at a time' is that they don't really do a good ice coffee.  They seem to have a container at the back that they pour a cup off coffee into time-to-time to keep a small batch of cold/ice coffee, but it's not really very nice.  In the summer months I like a nice ice coffee and sadly for that I have to visit Peets.\n\n***Erratic closing hours***\nI guess this is San Fran-casual but they close at different times of the day which is very frustrating.  It seems to be based on what they feel like - there's no pattern I can tell (like staying open late on ball game nights, etc).  I can go down there at 7pm after work and they might be open, they might not.  It's a lottery, which I now tend to avoid out of disappointment and otherwise coffee abandonment with no other decent joints nearby.\n\n***Location***\nDon't get me wrong, **so glad** to have a good independent coffee shop in SoMa.  However the location is not great and it's a shame Philz didn't open up in one of the new units actually on King.  If I have to ride the CalTrain unless I'm like very early for the train it's just a little too far away to quickly grab a coffee a few minutes before the CalTrain pulls out (the lights across King and also across 4th take forever to change to let you cross, cos of the tram way).\n\n\nSo ok, there are a few bad points, but I gotta say this is the best coffee in Soma and so I can't give it anything less than 4/5 even with the bad stuff.\n\nOh and in addition to there being lots of WiFi around as previously noted, I'm pretty sure they have an \"official\" hotspot too.

It's more of a place where you stay for a few minutes and then leave rather than really do any work there or hang out for hours (although I have seen others doing things like that). \n\nService is a crapshoot. Twice I went there, and was helped by a friendly guy eager to teach me about the different types of coffee and make recommendations. Last time, we had some fairly indifferent people who were all business and just wanted us to order as quickly as possible. And no, it wasn't based on them being busy- we were the only people in there the last time we went!!!\n\nSo maybe it's not the homey place were everyone knows your name. But the coffee is incredible, decently priced, and full of new and exciting flavors (cheesy as that sounds). \n\nGet it \"to go\", and prepare to be amazed.", "author": "Angie B."}

I have been to ritual and blue bottle and all the others...but for some reason this place is the best.  I think it is all the choices, the individual drip brewing of each cup of coffee.  Not a place to go to if you are in a rush, but if you want an insanely good cup of straight up coffee this is the place.  Decent snacks...try the sambosas...like samosas I guess...a little spicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-05", "description": "Before I moved to San Francisco and began graduate school, I was not a regular coffee-drinker. Now, a year-and-a-half into my program, I need at least a giant cup to start the day, and maybe a cup or two in the afternoon. I may have to get an IV drip by the time I graduate.\n \nThe thing is, as I've noted in other reviews, I don't actually appreciate the taste of coffee very much, and usually cover it up with lots of sugar and milk. That is why, when I heard from someone in the lab that a Philz had opened up nearby, and that their $3 coffee was worth the price, I scoffed. The shitty coffee in the bookstore downstairs is only $1.25, I thought to myself. But I was up for a walk and a change of scenery, so I figured I'd give it a try. And damn if the house coffee wasn't the best cup of coffee I've ever had, and perfectly complemented by the mint sprig on top.  Very enthusiastically served by Phil's daughter, too. How did I know she was his daughter? Because she unsuccessfully attempted to wake the man in the fedora, who was sound asleep on the comfy leather couch, by yelling, \"Hey Dad! Dad! Phil!\" when a customer wanted to talk to him. Apparently opening a new store really took it out of poor old Phil. \n\nI have a feeling that I'll be inevitably drawn back here until I've tried every single one of the coffee varieties. The only question is whether that will occur before I complete my thesis. Hah--who am I kidding? I've got years of Philz coffee-drinking ahead of me.", "author": "Rachel J."}

I would not   try coffee ever again- even through late nights of studying in college or even to appease a night of drinking.  \nLittle did I know that coffee would someday be a factor into social status a means to show one's income and personal growth.\nAs a check to check worker- putting in time for on call hours at the hospital- was how you earned your merit, your badge of honor - it entailed going in at 2, 3 4 am and working through the afternoon shift!\nI was 'lucky' enough to live near one of those ostentatiously fluorescent  coffee shops where the donuts were as big as your head- this kind of coffee was just that passive stimulant to get you  through the day...\nA few years into work- and starbucks coffee has become a twice a day habit-- and seems like everybody's liking it...frappuccino this machiatto that...why not add SBUX to the portfolio please.  It became a requirement that starbucks be the choice of beverage from pharm reps & med reps... I felt like I was on my way....\nThen I read about the hostile take overs, of the company's unfair trade practices...I looked for something more- something that will suit my conscience as well as my now enslaved palate.\nThis was when I found Philz Coffee.  Coffee that is from the heart- a passion to make the best cup of coffee possible.  With the help of his son, they've assembled an array of blends that will cater to your taste! \nCoffee should be brewed fresh- not stored in a vat and pumped out in a hurry.   It should be chosen- and discussed- much like talking with a friend about a menu. Stand by close to your coffee attendant- as she/he grinds your choice and gingerly pours hot water over the granulated beans,  washing all that oil and fragrant ambrosia, funneled into ONE cup- YOUR cup.  \nService of this quality is seldom heard of- especially in this business- when one rarely thinks about the preparation or the thought behind all of it.

It of course tasted good in all of its greasiness, but Philz needs to step up the pastries. I say, go to Philz for just coffee, but if you want coffee and a pastry, go to the Creamery.

I had work coming up and needed something to keep me curling up in bed and missing work. so i stopped in for a boost.  \nMy initial thought was, sh*t I know nothing about coffee, this is overwhelming, im going to look like a dummy walkin in not knowing a darn thing about coffee.  \nThen, a cute girl smiled and asked what I would like..long story short she helped me find a wonderful taste that fit me perfectly without saying one thing about coffee.\nNext, as I was heading to the register to pay, another cute girl, who obviously had her coffee today was shimmying and smiling behind the counter and said, \"I have found it is impossible to shimmy and NOT smile..\"\nthis made me smile.  \nbut this doesnt end, she made light conversation then gave me the most delicious cupcake I have ever had, and in one bite hit all my senses right to leave me with a perma grin for the rest of the day.  I mean damn..that was probably the best costomer service I had had in a long time..and it flipped my day from complete crap to actually a pretty good day! :)\nPLUS\nthey had water outside for my pup to sip on while i went to get my fix!\nA + for the whole shebang!", "author": "S B."}

The d\u00e9cor was inviting and the seats looked very comfortable. Since I got there so early there was hardly a line. The layout is confusing. You have to pass by the register to place your order then backtrack to pay. There were no signs to make this very clear. I didn't think the service was anything extraordinary. I get same type of service when I go to starbucks or peets. So I ordered a mocha from the menu and was very disappointed. The coffee was only luke warm and tasted very chalky, kind of like hot version of Ensure. It wasn't a soothing or tasty cup of coffee I was hoping for. The barista attempted to fix it however it tasted worse. I still ended up with the coffee however after a few sips of my large coffee I ended up throwing it away. \n\nHonestly their coffee was just very average street coffee.  Next I will just stick to my soothing latte at Starbucks. I really wanted to like philz cause it's walking distance from home.", "author": "Meredith L."}
