This meant I needed a place that was original and impressive, but not too popular to the point where we would not be able to converse. I read online that this bar does receive customers, but not to the point where you must wait for a seat and are shoving people around to reach the bartender.\n\nThird Rail addressed these needs of mine perfectly. I arrived at 8:30pm on a Friday night, and there was abundant seating, and maybe around three or four small parties already there.  We were handed a menu by the bartender, and decided to order the $10 deal, which is a choice of beer, a shot, and a bite of beef jerky. The drinks were good, and my shot of tequila went down easy. The only problem with the beef jerky was that there was not enough of it! It was tender and juicy, not at all like a supermarket jerky. \n\nI will come here again to grab a drink with a friend. It's the perfect ambience for catching up in a lively enough environment.", "author": "Katherine L."}

Such a great deal! After trying the jerky we decided to order a few more drinks and split the large jerky sampler. All of the jerky flavors were really really good but of course we had our favorites. My personal favorite was the Mighty and the Sriracha but all of them are a must try. \n\nThe bartenders were very attentive and really very nice.

It wasn't too busy, but the best menu item (the Third Rail Shot) takes awhile to prepare. For $10, you get a half shot, half beer, and piece of jerky. Great deal! My favorite combo was the IPA, bourbon, and mighty jerky. Just remember to tip the bartender well.\n\nWe had a great conversation with the bartender. I think her name is Shannon? Anyways, she made us feel like regulars, which we just might become. Good variety of cocktails, fresh bar snacks, and beers on tap.

So dead there aren't even crickets chirping in the background.\n\nI'm so glad my friend found this place, since it's close to home! Hidden right behind Dogpatch Cafe lies Third Rail, a 1920's themed bar that serves innovative cocktails, similar to Alchemist or Local Edition, but smaller in size.\n\nMy first order consisted of the Rail Shot for $10, in which you get to choose a beer, a shot, and  a jerky. A great deal if you ask me. However, do note that the beers are smaller than your average glass of 16-20 ounces. The beer was for the bf and the shot for me. I got a shot of the Mezcal in which I enjoyed before gulping it down to the hoorahs of a birthday celebration. It has a strong similarity to tequila with a smokiness to it. I would definitely order this shot again. I got the Mighty Jerky which was very tasty. They sell their jerky separately too.\n\nFor my second order, I ordered the Jigglypuff consisting of gin, sherry, orgeat, lemon, egg white, and nutmeg. How could I resist a drink named after a Pokemon? So befitting of me. The drink was delicious, more on the sweet side. The only thing I could complain about was that the egg white foam was a bit too much.\n\nService was great. It didn't take long for a bartender to notice me then shortly after took my order. They take credit cards too, for those who never carry cash such as I.\n\nThere's plenty of street parking. The only downside to this bar is that the noise level is quite high.

It was my first time in the neighborhood, and I got the sense that this bar was perfect for me and probably terrible news for somebody's rent. (I just googled it and one of the first hits is \"The Scoop on Dogpatch: San Francisco's New Indie Neighborhood,\" from 2013.) God am I a sucker for good $13 cocktails with big fancy ice cubes.\n\nI came here with my husband and our friend Mike W. for early drinks before a late dinner nearby. I loved the place immediately--cozy, dim, and quiet, with \"oh, this? we just slapped this together out of reclaimed woods\" decor. It was very relaxed at 7:30 on a Thursday, and we nabbed a table along with ease. Service at the bar was quick and polite.\n\nThe drinks were excellent, though two months later, I can't remember every one we got in our two rounds (a real thorn in my Yelp OCD). The ones I do remember are the Bone Machine, the Rhinoceros, the Aftermath, and the Diplomat, all outstanding. The first two were both strong, smooth whiskey cocktails: the Bone Machine made with bourbon, oloroso sherry, amaro, and bitters; the Rhinoceros with rye, ginger liqueur, bonal, and bitters. I tend to like these boozy brown liquor drinks when they're made with that golden balance. The Aftermath and the Diplomat were made with rum, but they also fit into this category. The Aftermath mixed rhum agricole with burnt honey, vermouth, and bitters, and was probably my favorite drink of the night, bold and warming, with a lot of depth. The Diplomat wasn't on the menu that night, but Mike knew to order it. Another winner, a rounded combination of rum, madeira, walnut, and bitters.\n\nIf we weren't going to dinner, I would've been into the beef jerky pairings, though that seems like a random gimmick for a cocktail bar. I hope to sample them in the future. I'd like to come back to Third Rail whenever I get the chance.", "author": "Steph C."}

It has the unique effect of allowing you to smell it every time you take a sip, which adds to the flavor in a totally unique and wonderful way compared to if it were mixed in. The pomegranate was the strongest flavor, and it was boozy but didn't taste so much so.\n\n* Harvest Moon - 3.5 stars\n(Pueblo viejo blanco tequila, Asian pear, kubler absinthe, lime)\nThe tequila definitely stood out in the flavor here - not as sharp in flavor as the Sweet Thang, more mild, more mellow, but also well balanced if you love tequilas. \n\nPhoto of these drinks: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/third-rail-san-francisco?select=W9FGEus1myp76_WpFahZ0g#Yp9G8I6RA77xG9R69DN9vA\n\nCITRUS:\n* Third Rail - 4.5 stars\n(Buffalo Trace bourbon, lillet, honey, lemon, orange bitters)\nDidn't get to try it but all my roommates were raving about this.

Needless to say, I felt pretty manly ordering a couple fingers of whiskey neat and some dried up meat to munch on. Too bad I'm not much of a straight whiskey drinker, so ordering (choking it down) was mostly for show to impress my girlfriend. But really though, nobody in the commercials ever has it with rocks! Maybe not so manly after all...\n\nBesides their huge assortment of whiskeys, the rest of their cocktail selection is really good too. Of course, you have to try their namesake, The Third Rail. It's a very solid cocktail that I recommend everyone get their first go 'round. The Tally Ho is also a winner in my books. Definitely get those two. \n\nThey also have a great  seasonal cocktail selection, but I won't waste my time writing too much about it. When they seasonal, they mean seasonal. They're always keeping it fresh and updating the menu, so prepare yourself for disappointment if you come back half a year later and it's no longer there.\n\nTheir regular menu does a great job of sorting out their cocktails into different categories, so it's easier to figure out what you want to drink based on the kind of flavor/feel you want to have. While this may not seem like a big deal, but it's nice to have be able to be a little organized right before you get smashed (tastefully, might I add). \n\nThe drinks are all reasonably priced (~$10) and pretty strong, so that definitely earns a thumbs up. One tip I'll give you is to sit up at the bar for at least one round while the bartender is making your drink. The drinks take a little bit of time to come out, but that's cuz the bartenders are seriously working magic. I've never seen anybody put so much care into crafting a cocktail. Seriously cool stuff.\n\nDefinitely has a bit of a hipster vibe to it. It's a pretty small place and probably can't fit more than 35 people in it without posing a serious fire hazard, but I like it. Feels a little like Austin, TX, which I definitely dig. Makes it feel like home.", "author": "Zi-on C."}

The bartenders are knowledgable and not as snooty as the usual hipsters (mixologists).  They have yummy jerky that can accompany all their drinks.  This place isn't looking to pull in the average sunday funday goer.  Our group got some pretty annoyed looks, but we managed to stay for a good four hours.  This place is often dead until the night, so it's a nice place to go if you are looking for a seat, solace, and a stiff one.\n\nMy favorite thing: These bartenders do not cut people off, then continue you to pour drinks, but omit the alcohol.  I guess it is there way of sticking it to over the top drunks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-16", "description": "Came here tonight and couldn't wait to write my review!  A friend and I tried the following:\n\nDouble date: date infused rye, whiskey, sweet vermouth, amaro, cinnamon bitters.  My type of drink - stiff and served on a large rock.  The date flavor was noticeable and the cinnamon bitters came through in the finish.  It was actually very drinkable for being a stiff drink, which could potentially be dangerous ;)\n\nMt. Tam: My favorite drink of the evening!  Gin, sweet vermouth, Gran classico, kina l'avion, served up.  I learned that kina l'avion is an aperitif that tastes halfway between white wine and bitters.  The friendly bartender offered us a taste neat.  He described this drink as a play on a negroni... in my opinion it was a thousand times better than a negroni because Campari can be so overpowering.  The Mt. Tam was perfectly balanced, herbal, and hands down one of the best drinks I've had in the city.\n\nZapatista: tequila, sherry, benedictine, and chocolate bitters, served up.  I found this drink to be heavy on the sherry and therefore too sweet.  The flavor of cocoa was very subtle in the finish - I wouldn't have known it was there if I wasn't looking for it.  They did do a good job masking the flavor of tequila though, if you're into that due to a bad experience in college.\n\nHarvest Moon: tequila, pear, absinthe, lime, served on the rocks.  A \"yummy\" very drinkable cocktail, though you must like absinthe.  Too sweet and too absinthe-y for my taste, though my friend was quite pleased.\n\nRed eye jerky: coffee, chile, mustard, and cumin.  Had a nice kick to it and I loved the coffee - never had that flavor profile in jerky before!  Most of their jerky is $2.50/oz.  \n\nAll cocktails are $10, and all prices include tax which scores major points in my book - it makes the math so much easier at the end of the night!  Bottom line?  Damn good cocktails with good service, sophisticated but chill ambiance, and close to my place.

So, color me excited when my buddy Jean Y told me about this new addition to the neighborhood!\n\nWe showed up a week ago, where I ordered one of their Ol' 55s, and an Envy. And, well, the bartenders know their stuff, as far as naming and suggestions go, at least. As the \"spiritous\" category would suggest, the Ol' 55 was indeed a much stronger cocktail, with some slight medicinal notes. When asking for something a little more refreshing for my second, my bartender's suggestion of the Envy was spot on.\n\nNow, while they're not quite at the level of favorites such as Martuni's, Rickhouse, or Zero Zero, I did like their cocktails more than say, Bar Agricole or Azucar. And at $10 a pop, and within walking distance of my home, you can be certain I'll be dropping by here more in the future, simply for the balance of quality, value, and convenience.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While the space isn't huge, they're new enough that there isn't such a crowd as to make the place feel cramped and hard to navigate through.

It's one of the bartenders from Serpentine (which previously was the only place for a good cocktail in the hood), so I have high hopes. And it didn't disappoint.\n\nIt was a 3 cocktail evening and all were good. \nCloven Hoof was great. Highly recommended for those wanting a serious cocktail.\nThe Third Rail was good\nThe Tally Ho was a-ok. Though would have been nice to know before ordering that it's almost snow cone in a glass. A bit simple. Just not my style.\n\nJerky wasn't bad either.  A very solid drinking establishment and a welcome edition to neighborhood. (You might just be able to get a sampler if you ask)\n\nMy only concern is that I sorta love the sleepiness of Dog Patch. It has a few great places that you can more or less just walk in to without reserving a spot 3 weeks in advance or waiting 30 minutes for a seat. But this place is pretty slick and I hope it doesn't get too much of a buzz to attract every Tom, Dick, and Harry. Yeah, I want to keep this place for myself (as I advertise it over the interwebs)", "author": "Zack S."}

Had a sour citrus drink with mezcal, nice smoky flavor and foamed egg white atop. Delicious, expertly crafted. Friend enjoyed her third rail.\nLove the atmosphere, roomy inside despite being a shotgun space. Kudos for the built in banquette and small, beautiful wood tables. Nice alternative to sitting at the bar. Couches and chairs fill the window up front.\nIt seemed the customers all purchased the homemade jerkey. I would prefer another snack option.\nParking is easy and free, do not leave anything visible or i guarantee you will be sorry.

As a beef jerky junkie, I'm sincerely upset I didn't come up with the idea for this place myself. \n\nAll cocktails cost $10. For the amount of alcohol in each drink, they are a steal. Our favorites were the '12 Angry Men' and the 'Bone Machine' (both whiskey-driven). The bartenders were all very friendly and can make you something off the menu if you ask.\n\nThey have several varieties of jerky available and my friends and I tried all of them, apart from the \"vegetable jerky\" (which is an affront to jerky in my carnivorous lifestyle, but maybe that's your bag). The clear favorite in our group was the \"spicy beef candy\" which was sweet, spicy, sticky, and delicious. We also really enjoyed the \"cowboy\" and \"red eye\" as well as all three jerky sticks which have interesting and varying flavors and textures. Jerky is ~$2.50/oz and I'd get at least 2oz per person to start.\n\nWe never intended for our dinner to be in jerky and liquid form that night, but after three rounds that's exactly what happened. I'll definitely be back, especially if it's too late in the day to hit up The Ramp.", "author": "Thomas U."}

The reservation process was simple, although I made it probably more complicated by asking a lot of questions (all of this was handled via e-mail and one call)...but simply put, all you have to do is drop a credit card to hold your place, give them a general head count a few days out, and they'll have some tables set up for you. The card isn't charged; you just have to give 48 hours advance notice if you cancel or you get some type of drink credit if you don't show up and/or less than 48 hours notice. But as long as you show up on your scheduled day/time...you're money. We had the tables near the back, so we had easy access to the bartenders the entire night. The place got pretty packed throughout the evening, so I was glad we set up some tables. Justin introduced himself to me when I arrived just to give me the general lay of the land and let me know how everything would work.
