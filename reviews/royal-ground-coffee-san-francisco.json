When We in asked about a tea latte advertised in the cafe, the man behind the counter responded short and curt \"we don't have that\". I then asked if the hummus bagel could be modified and he responded again with the same attitude \"it's a dollar more\", as if he was not trying to do it and it would discourage me. When I asked if I could have whipped cream on my iced drink he said yes, but shorty after gave me my drink without it. He said he forgot, opened he drink in front of me and put the whipped cream on with the lid wet on the counter. When asked if they had a lid for it he said \"we don't have that\".  His demeanor was very unwelcoming and was as if we were bothering him. We were also the only ones in the cafe. We felt like we were being treated like second class citizens.

Also, the girls there all talk to my pup - I like it when they speak Russian to her and she acts like she know what they are saying.\n\nThe soups and sandwiches are very good, the coffee is great, and the service is excellent.\n\nIt is also nice that they have a separate room towards the back.

Otherwise, go to Cup & Cake Cafe 4 blocks away.\n\nMy main complaint is with the service. The employees have always come off if it's that time of the month.  Several times they have been lazy in seeing I am ready to order, haven't been happy to have to pause their conversation with their boyfriends and always show zero emotion for your business.\n\nAlso, do not come in any later than 30 minutes of closing because on multiple occasions I have witnessed customers been given excuses for not having time to make sandwiches.\n\nOn a side note do not buy their cookies.

The Asiago Pasta Salad surprised me the most because it was fresh and tasted quite gourmet.  My boyfriend claimed to be full but once he took a bite, he couldn't stop.  \n\nI originally wanted a bagel but they ran out.  Guess they're quite popular!

I actually visit this cafe when I drop my car off for service at big-o tires, so I end up working there for 1-2.5 hours and they are really cool.\n\nVery quiet most of the time, although a group can be chatty at any time. Most people seems to be there solo to eat and get a little work done or catch up on the latest international foreign affairs and world reports.  The TV is usually tuned to the news or a sports events, but not too loud.\n\nEnough seating in the mornings and they even have a comfy couch for sitting or lying down in the back room (no, not a seedy back lounge, just extra seats). Lots of windows everywhere to let in light - even though it's probably foggy in the richmond (I have sun blasting through the fog into my eyes at this moment though).\n\nThe only down side that I have noticed is one of the staff will walk out and chain smoke near the back door and the smoke can get into the shop. I noticed it a lot the last few times I was here and sitting in the front area, but not this time while I was in the back room. maybe that person has stopped, maybe that person was not working today, maybe I didn't notice from the back room.\n\nSince it's on the corner with lots of windows, there is 'some' people watching.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-16", "description": "As I live right across the street from here, it has become a staple in lunch study breaks.  Upon entry, the location provides a warmth that many of the larger chains have lost.  Whereas places like Starbucks feel like a hospital ward, Royal Grounds greets you with dark stained wood everywhere, with little antique coffeepots and grinders adorning their walls.  It has the feel of a local joint, and I was surprised to learn that it was in fact a chain that proliferates the city. There is a big bench lining the wall that is maybe 2 inches too tall to be completely comfortable, and could do with some padding.\n\nThe initial thought I had was that they must do their own roasting, because the smell of roast (read: burnt) is quite thick in the air.  \n\nThe entire place is staffed with Russian Batistas, and they carry the stereotype well.  Since I have become somewhat of a regular, they smile now, but it took melt the ice.  Regardless of their stony interaction, their service has been impeccable, and I've never felt like they ignored me.  My major complaint is that frequently they will take the order (especially for sandwiches) and start making them before the customer pays, leaving the customer standing there for a good while when they could go have a seat.  \n\nI've only had the house coffee, which is passable by any means.  I'm not a coffee snob and haven't been spoiled by Blue Bottle or the like, so it does the trick for me.\n\nThe reason I keep coming back is for the sandwiches.  They aren't by any means legendary, like Arguello Market's Turkey breast, but they are pretty healthy portions, and they are using Boar's Head meats, which I find to be a higher caliber than most.  For a deli sandwich to be good, the bread must be excellent, and here the Sourdough is top notch.  \n\nRoyal Grounds always has a some special (that I always get) that includes the sandwich and a can of soda, which seems to sweeten the deal.  \n\nCoffee or not, the Deli is what keeps getting me back here.", "author": "Richard Y."}

Also, they aren't the friendliest, but I prefer when they just leave you alone. I think they warm up to you once you become a regular. I like that they make the sandwiches extremely fast.... like faster than McDonalds serves you food. Arguello Market takes absolutely forever and frustrates me too much. I have an entire room to myself sitting on a nice couch with a view of Geary Blvd. It is a nice and relaxing atmosphere. It is also very hot inside, which I like.

The fresh pastries are to die for and if you get them the next day they are in the dollar bin of tasty things that need a good home in your stomach.", "author": "Muhammad R."}

Unfortunately, their hours are listed incorrectly.\nNOT OPEN at 7:30am on Sunday, they were definitely closed at that time. Someone please update their hours (or open your darn business on time).", "author": "Bob B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-02", "description": "This is a quaint cafe with great coffee and sandwiches. This particular Royal Ground usually isn't as busy as some of their other locations and there are some nice window seats in the front. There is also a back room which looks secretive and private. On a sunny day, the outside tables are a good option since they never seem to get the cold wind that Geary Street is subject to. Also, this cafe is right across the street from the Bridge movie theater--a good place to go afterwards and chat about the film!", "author": "A Y."}

I'll come in for breakfast--usually a bagel with cream cheese and a chai tea (very delicious and sweet).  They offer a plethora of different sandwiches from homemade chicken salad to prosciutto to more standards such as  ham, turkey and roast beef.  The ingredients are always fresh and nicely cut...I'm hardly ever having to readjust lettuce or tomatoes.  The service is excellent--fast and efficient.  The owner, Joe is great and their regular server (Asian girl) is too.  I used to go to Royal Ground Coffee out of convenience, but once I found out that the food is good and consistent, again, it has fast become a staple in my work week lunching.", "author": "Marie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-03", "description": "I go to Royal Ground almost every other day for coffee and a sandwich. I highly recommend the Turkey Bacon Club w/ Avocado, finding a window seat and enjoying the warm atmosphere and dedicated staff. I'm confused by all the reviewers that seem to have gotten their feelings hurt by the supposedly \"unfriendly\" staff. I think patrons are becoming too accustomed to the overly cheery 'hellos' and fake smiles from the Starbucks employees. Or maybe some prefer the ultra cool, hipster-lite crowd working behind the counters at Peet's. It's a mystery to me. Royal Ground has very friendly workers that I've had several genuine conversations with. I hope a few hyper-sensitive reviewers that had a bad day and decided to take it out on these staff members doesn't deter anyone from checking out this great spot.", "author": "Tobias G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-01", "description": "I live across the street and work from home, so I go to Royal Ground every day for food and coffee. This is partially a matter of convenience, but also because, for the bit of every work day when I have actual human contact, I want it to be with people I like. Every time I go inside, I get treated like a real person, whether it's a short conversation when no other customers are waiting or simple speed on the order when there's a rush. Often, they even pour my coffee before I've ordered anything. They value my business, but more than that, they're genuinely personable, not some people who were trained on how to act towards customers at a day-long training seminar.", "author": "Eric F."}
