He also seemed really intoxicated! While we tried numerous times to just explain what happened he kept interrupting without really listening. When we felt he was being rude, we asked to see the manager and he says \"I'm the manager\" when he wasn't!!

It didn't take more than a minute before he physically grabbed and choked us absolutely unprovoked, giving me no time to even take out my ID. He handled the situation in the worst possible way, having no reason to be extremely unproffessional, irrational, and accusing us of nothing - we were not inebriated or disturbing anyone at all having literally just entered the building. On top of that, my boyfriend has had a severe back injury in the past and put him at risk for absolutely no reason. The irrational and downright discriminatory attitude Travis Lafouf came on with should not be in a workplace and situation where mediating crowds professionally is priority. For the sake of this institution, the crowd, and the other people who work here, I highly urge investigation of this behavior especially if it results in needless, uncalled for violence. That being said I'd be happy to remove this rating once it's looked into, but for this worker to escalate the situation so terribly is incredibly improper and needs to be spoken on. \n\nIt's a huge shame and disappointment scrolling through reviews and reading people experiencing these rude and discriminatory biases as well.

But the back is where the party is at (interpret that as you will): HIDEOUT, a cocktail bar where they don't believe in vodka. Once 7 PM hits, shimmy over to the back and seek out a bartender called Jason, who will make you a clean mean drink of whatever the heck you want. Their cocktails menu seems to change monthly, which includes new renditions of a varying \"classic.\" Each cocktail will cost you $10, CASH ONLY, but be worth way more.\n\nBut really, those cocktails are worth every dollar and then some. I have never enjoyed drinking as much as with the drinks I had that night (this is obv the start of a great relationship). My first was the BOURBON MULE involving my favorites of mint and ginger (Jason overheard my conversation with my drinking partner...given how loud I am, that's not too difficult hahaha). It was the pinnacle trifecta: light, delicious, and inebriating.\n\nMy next two drinks came from previous Yelpers' recommendations--I literally gave Jason my phone so he could see the ingredients. The SWITCHEL, made with Venezuelan rum, apple (which they ran out of), lime, ginger, and cinnamon, was another home run. Then came the 16TH STREET SWIZZLE, a fave of Jason's. Don't confuse this with the listed Hideout Swizzle #2 (gin, genepy, lime, pineapple, and orange bitters), as the 16th Street Swizzle is made with Jamaican rum, lime, honey, orgeat, and ginger shrub (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dalva-san-francisco?select=o-ojEQ19lp2A-xdNGn960w#waNr1XmkUqJg0eiYf6kPPQ). It's like a sweet liquid ginger. It's kinda awesome.\n\nMy drinking partner started off with an Old Fashioned, later ordering the Clover Club, which they swapped out the grenadine for raspberry puree. Another good drink.\n\nSometimes Jason had to run to the back room to grab ingredients, which is when I got to chat a bit with the other bartender, David, who has been with Dalva for 16 years. Epic, right!? Srsly, they care about the drinks they make without the snotty pretentious 'tude of some other mixologists (that's Mission versus FiDi for you, I guess), and it makes all the difference.\n\nHIDEOUT = $10 CASH-ONLY COCKTAILS, THE BEST YOU'LL EVER HAVE", "author": "Adele F."}

The Hideout is the bar within Dalva. They serve the most amazing cocktails I've ever had in my life. Other Mission bars might be more trendy like Trick Dog and ABV, and they do have awesome cocktails. However, my local recommendation is definitely The Hideout.\n\nThe front bar (Dalva proper) takes credit cards but The Hideout only takes cash. There is an ATM by the bathrooms if you need one. You can go straight back to The Hideout and ask for a menu and choose your new favorite cocktail (I have faith you will be returning, lol). Their menu consistently changes but they will always make old menu drinks if you fell in love. My favorite drink ever is the Grapefruit Soda, which ironically has zero grapefruit in it besides the garnish, but tastes like the freshest grapefruit you've had in your life (with a touch of vodka, of course). It is SO GOOD. Watch out though, like all of their drinks they are pretty strong.\n\nAmbiance: perfect for a first date or a GNO.

It looks very cramped and long, and I'm not trying to involve myself in that. Then when my chef friend said that there's a secret bar in the back, the Hideout, that offers craft cocktails and a cozy atmosphere, I rallied my girlfriends and we headed over on Friday night.\n\nDalva was exactly what I expected, so we happily made our way back to the Hideout. It was small back there too, but I liked the intimate feel of it. We all ordered the drink of the evening, which, I of course can't remember the name since we glugged a couple bottles of wine with dinner, but it was basically a fancy, straight up Old Fashioned in a small wine glass. Very strong, with an orange finish. I got to sit and chat with my friend about life and boys before we headed out to Toronado to meet the rest of our crew. Very cool spot, I highly recommend checking it out.", "author": "Crystal C."}

The ambience is nicely precious-- Low benches, leather, and candlelight; one small bar, one master bartender, working like an artist with a messy mise en place.  It was a little too loud for a group of five, and we took our cocktails to one of the many spacious tables in Dalva itself.\n\nThe cocktails were the best I've had West of the Violet Hour in Chicago.  The House Whiskey Cocktail, was some kind of surprisingly complex, easy-drinking boozy cocktail with bourbon, maraschino, bitters, etc.; the bourbon mule was pleasant and refreshing but a little safe; Autumn in Italy was a mix of apple brandy and bitter italian liqueurs that was quite complex, for an apple drink; a gin & amaro drink and a frothy gin sour were well done but a little safe.  All in all it was an impressive array of solid cocktails with no true duds.  \n\nBut a cocktail bar is ultimately judged by its best work, and it was outstanding.  Hideout has done the impossible, produce a delicious cocktail made with fernet branca (mixed with sweet vermouth and gran classico, apparently).  It was astonishingly crisp and bracing, yet pleasant.  But the hands-down winner of the night was a gin and celery cocktail that was fresh, herbal, clean, and addictive.

But Dalva's Sunday night karaoke makes it impossible to enjoy films at the Roxie Theatre next door.  If you prefer films in the original version, without a backdrop of drunk monkeys howling through the wall, avoid the Roxie on Sunday night.  And stay away from Dalva, the cause of the din.  They don't deserve your business.\n\nDalva is a dive bar gone upscale and pricey.  It's nothing special, really.   By contrast, the Roxie is special.  If you love film, it's a gem, screening independent and foreign films that nobody else bothers with any more.  But if you love film, you might as well assume the Roxie is closed on Sunday nights.  Dalva's loud karaoke makes it nearly impossible to enjoy any film in which silence is part of the oeuvre.  And management simply doesn't care.  Maybe they think that the Roxie screens mainstream action films, with a strong soundtrack, full of helicopters, explosions, revving motors, gunshots and yelling, so that patrons wouldn't notice the din from the drunk monkeys in the dive next door.  But that's not what the Roxie screens.  :-(\n\nTo be clear, Dalva doesn't actually close the Roxie on Sunday nights.  But its insensitivity drives business from one of the last independent film houses in San Francisco.  If you love film, or if you just want to make a statement for neighborhood civility, don't patronize Dalva.  There are other dive bars in the neighborhood.  But there's only one Roxie, and Dalva makes it impossible for them to operate one night out of seven.  Dalva will do anything (karaoke?!) to attract business on a slow Sunday.  As such, it doesn't deserve your business on any night.  Go elsewhere.", "author": "Paul S."}

Some friends and I were bar hopping in the mission. The birthday boy of or group wanted to hop over to this bar. We were asked to show our I.D.'s, the usual upon entering any bar. Good music was playing, the crowd and ambiance was pretty chill. We had a few drinks from previous bars so we were just enjoying the scene and music. It was a cool bar.  However, the moment four of my friends: 3 Filipinos & 1 Saudi, attempted to order drinks the bartender immediately, with no hesitation, responded with a flat out \"No\". Surprised by his reaction, my friend assumed maybe the bartender didn't have the right alcohol for the drink requested. He asked for a different drink, and like before the bartender responded with a \"I can't serve you guys\". The bartender asked for IDs. Once he came across my Saudi friend's ID, he said that he didn't recognize the I.D. (Well yeah, he's a foreign exchange student). Convinced that we were all \"under-age\", even though the bouncer let us in, he refused to offer us drinks. Confused by the bartenders actions, we looked around the room and near the bar to check out our surroundings, and yes, there were more Caucasian individuals than colored Filipinos and Saudis in the bar. We obviously were not the usual \"crowd\" that came into that bar. Considering that this was a bar in SF, the last thing we wanted this incident to be was an act of racism. However, it definitely felt like it. And it was a feeling that I've never felt while living here in SF until that night.

This bar is in the back of Dalva and their menu is specialty cocktails. My favorite drink here is the dirty pigeon. I did try the doorman, but it was too strong for my taste. Place does get crowded, but luckily with my eagle eye, I was able to snag a booth just as the group was leaving. The space in Hideout was just too tight. I think if I didn't get a table, I would have left early. No where to put anything. There is an upstairs area, but that night there was a private party. Even then, the space upstairs was even tinier, and there was no bar. Overall, good cocktails, small space. Get here early!", "author": "Lisa T."}

The upstairs looks to be a whole other private area, but if they have a birthday up there you're out of luck. No bar though, so you'll be forced to walk down and mingle with the other non-cool people. Has a great selection of tequila drinks, but didn't really feel the whiskey ones they had. Guess I'm more of a Bourbon guy.  Props to them for knowing how to make \"smokey\" tequila drinks for the ladies, though. Pliny for over $5 was steep, but the best I could muster (hard to find this anywhere, anyhow).

This may or may not have something to do with the Karaoke they had going on. I never asked but I'm assuming this means that Sundays are karaoke nights. I've never really cared for karaoke, but when you're at a bar listening to other people go up and possibly going up for yourself....it's the best thing EVER. Especially when alcohol is involved.\n\nI ordered a Black & Tan while my friends got a whiskey/coke and a cider drink respectively. I originally wanted a white Russian but they didn't have milk. That's the only downside to this bar....they run out of things a lot. Or don't have it in stock. \n\nDidn't really faze me though. I enjoyed my drink although I admit that I've had better/prettier versions of the same drink. Plus side to this bar is that the drinks are much cheaper.

In this case, that prize is The Hideout. The best thing I have to say about Dalva is that the layout is a nice, expeditious straight line between the entrance to the building and what I actually care about. \n\nThe Hideout, as anyone reading this no doubt knows, is (one of) THE places to get snooty artisanal cocktails from mustachioed bartenders who on the best days are wonderful gentleman-scholars about the art of getting customers fucked up for money and on the worst days ignore me in favor of staring down the top of every girl who walks by while mainlining shots of whiskey. If you beat the crowd and get a table for you and your friends (especially in the loft area up top), the Hideout is generally a lot of fun as long as you're the type of person who appreciates that they will garnish things with blood orange peel or a splash of rosemary-infused gin. Since I am that person, I think this place is amazing. If you are looking for a place to get some dollar drafts and chill with your bros, you might want to try elsewhere.\n\nAlso, this place is not \"divey\" in the most important sense of the word: the price.

He mixes the cocktail right up to the line on the measuring jigger not to be skimpy, but to make the flavor of the cocktail *exactly* how it should be. When he's done with the beverage, he takes a quick sip out of it (with the straw, not out of the actual glass) to ensure it's the way it should be. It may take a minute or two extra to get your cocktail, but it's worth the wait.\n\nThere's a cool red, little room up the stairs way in the back that is a nice spot to hang and talk some shit with some friends. Such a good spot. While the music is awesome, it isn't super loud, so you can actually hear the people you're talking to.", "author": "Patrick Z."}

No judgements.\n\nThe Hideout, Dalva's back bar, is where you'll find me more often sipping Bourbon and Whiskey with friends and strangers alike. Its got a great selection of higher end and rare spirits. The cocktails there look and sound amazing yet I've only had a few sips as I'm a \"straight up\" kinda guy.

Still quite minimalist in feel - it's certainly not over decorated by any stretch - and they still usually have a movie projected against the back wall.\n\nThe beer selection is good, and the bar is usually not too crowded, which is better.  But the best part is the Hideout - basically a whole second bar in the back, tiny, intimate, even darker than the front, but with fantastic high-end cocktails on a revolving menu, and a rotating set of bartenders who get to ply their delicious trade to an appropriately attentive audience.  Seriously - there are all of 6 seats at the mini-bar, with table/bench seating for maybe 10 more people, plus an additional upstairs space that tends to get too warm & stuffy.\n\nThe only down side to the Hideout is the volume level - such a small space, with nothing but hard wood surfaces, and as soon as there are more than about 5 people the conversations have to start fighting each other for space.\n\nBut other than that minor quibble, it's pretty fantastic.

What a welcoming entrance! The good thing was that they left enough wiggle room for me to order a drink from the nice bartenders. The place is nice and intimate, almost like a cave of wonders type of lighting. The red candles spread throughout was a nice touch. There's also a screen up above playing obscure cinema for your conversation starting pleasure. Like, \"What the...? Are they crucifying that guy? Oh no, it was some dude's crazy dream. Oh shit, no it's not a dream! What the fuck am I watching?\" You know, that kind of stuff. A little visual stimulation along with drinks is always a good time. Also, they have a great beer selection. Any place that has Death and Taxes on tap is fine with me.\n\nIn the back there's The Hideout. At first we thought it was some sort of exclusive place and thought, \"Whoa, a bar within a bar!\" That is awesome. They have more of a liquor selection for your refined tastes, also it's a great spot to just hang out with your group of friends without having to move for a crowd of people every second, but that usually happens on the weekend.\n\nThis place is always a first stop on the Mission block when it comes to barhopping.

Big difference. It seems that Dalva, and their clientele, hasn't quite figured that out yet.\n\nIf I may return to the subject of adolescence--Yes, waiting 12 minutes for my Linkin Park song to download on Napster probably made me appreciate my music a little bit more, but waiting 12 minutes for my Manhattan doesn't make me appreciate my drink anymore than if I got it in 2 minutes.\n\nNow that that's out of my system, the drinks were good. Just as good as going to any other place that habitually serves \"craft cocktails\" (I'm almost certain that's how they would describe their drinks).\n\nI won't pretend to be hipster. I won't even pretend to be hipst. Maybe I caught some attitude because I forgot to wear my flannel out to 16th and Valencia again. Maybe I was just a little too buzzed for their liking.

Regardless, I was impressed with his professionalism and how he still took meticulous care in making every single cocktail despite people changing orders midstream (like me) and adding drinks to orders.  He was slammed and yet handled it like a true professional.\n\nDrinks were really good and I loved the kooky (kookie?) fish theme throughout the bar area.  I thought the metal coelocanth above the bar was hilarious.  Not sure if most patrons even know what that is.  Bar stools were kinda cramped, but the people were nice and even moved over one for us.

Repeat that!\" That's me yelling over the unnecessarily loud music, trying to establish how much my beer cost in this nearly empty bar with terrible acoustics. Toward the back there are a few high tables for 4-5 max with uncomfortable bar stools and, although it was slightly better here, having to yell at the person right next to me and the pounding in my brain so soon after work on a Monday made me anxious to leave the entire time I was here.\n\nApart from that, Dalva seems to be your typical Mission bar - sparing decor, decent liquor selection, variety of local/indie beers on tap, and choicer imports in bottles. I was happy to see a couple kinds of Chimay and Hitachino, including a large bottle of Hitachino white that was very nice indeed.\n\nSo, I guess this is a cool spot with good stuff to drink... but given the quality of the several bars within a block of this place, I doubt I'll return unless invited.", "author": "Kristina A."}

Happy hour is never so crowded that you can't find a seat, and the variety of beers they have is pretty bomb.\n\nOther yelpers are raving about the Hideout - but it didn't really cut it for me. The ambiance is great - suuuuuper relaxed and loungey without being smarmy. Just the good kind of loungey - like you're in a cute, dimly lit living room. I just wish their cocktails were more delicious (especially for $10-$11 each)... \n\nThe Brooklyn was fine, definitely the best of the three, but plenty of other bars can make this tastier. Their version was fairly sweet, so if you like that, then go for it. \n\nWhiskey in Church was just...bad. I know they said smokey scotch, but dang this was like drinking a liquid campfire. Where places like the Rickhouse succeed in balancing a crazy ass smokey scotch, the Hideout just failed. None of the amaro or pear flavors came through, and there was just a teeny tiny hint of maple.\n\nToast and Coffee I guess was alright. But after a couple sips the novelty of drinking it wears off, and I'd much rather be sitting there with actual toast and coffee.", "author": "Monica C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-22", "description": "This might be the worst bar I have ever been to in SF.  Actually I know it is the worst bar I have been to in SF.  I can break it down.\n\nI went to Dalva for MK's Madmen event so I was in a suit.  It was also a weekend.  I think that I was pretty much the only guy in a suit, at least a full blown suit.  I am not sure if that had anything to do with my experience or not.\n\nFirst of all the prior reviews are right on.  The bartenders measure all drinks in measuring cups.  Think about when you were a kid and your mom measured out you medicine by the tablespoon so accurately, that's pretty much how they treat their liquor.  I hate places like that.  There have been numerous studies done that if you pour with a heavy hand you make more money.  Now some will say that that the bloodhound for example does the same thing; not true.  Most of the concoctions that they make that require measurements have more than one alcoholic ingredient.  A manhattan does not, unless you count vermouth and bitters...\n\nSo basically what I am saying is that they skimp on the juice i.e. alcohol.  They skimped on the juice all night; yet all night I continued to tip well, throwing 1 or 2 bucks down per drink.  And the drinks are not cheap...\n\nSo towards the end of the night I ordered another manhattan and they gave it to me on the rocks.  I asked the bartender if he could serve it \"up\" and with more alcohol stating that I had been tipping well all night and he yelled at me.  I immediately turned around and walked away.  Didn't bother me at all.  In fact, for me, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I left.  Vowed never to return.  Don't think that will have any impact whatsoever on their business but it is my quiet protest.\n\nSo if you like hipster bartenders with a bad attitude, that measure your drinks by the tablespoon in the mission then this is definitely the place for you.  If you want a good value for your money I suggest going somewhere else.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

When I first walked in, nothing stood out to me. Just looked like a regular bar so we waited until \"The Hideout\" opened which was about 7pm. The Hideout, I would say, was pretty awesome. Cute cozy speak easy feel and the Farrah Faucett poster just made me smile. It was a total contrast from the rabbit with antlers decor they got next to it. \n\nBut it all boils down to drink selection and as a lover of whiskey, the selection blew my mind. It reminded me a bit of bourbon and branch (another bar I love). The posse ordered scotch related drinks and I ordered a whiskey, coffee, orangy taste concoction. One of those got me pretty tipsy.

It's a simple cocktail, but the drink I had was like a hard Roy Rogers: definite cola taste with a splash of sweet grenadine, and a rum kick.

I felt really awkward at all the ones I went to practically, but this was one of the better ones for me.  \n\nThe main room was very crowded.  I couldn't even get to the bar.  Good thing we were with big guys that could butt their way in.  But then there was no where to stand so we had to move towards the pool table.  And then we were in their way.  \n\nAlso, we had the misfortune of standing next to a group that had dropped their glasses twice and refused to pick it up or tell the bartender about it.  So there was just random glass on the floor.  \n\nI also know that they let underage people in, which isn't a big deal, except that it was really crowded and it just made me crankier.  \n\nWe finally made our way into the second room where it turned into a weird prom scene.  People were seated in a huge circle along the wall talking but not dancing.  But that changed after about an hour so it wasn't sooo bad.  \n\nThe entertainment was a transgendered woman dancing very brazenly on a small ledge.

Sweet, innocent, demure, waif-like (yeah right) little Stephy?\" *Gasp!* \"Never!\"\n\nWell, it's true. I have been in a scrap or three in my years and the night it almost happened here, would have been justifiable because a girl violated....\n\nThe Bathroom Door Rule.\n\nAllow me to explain. It's a bar. There are chicks. This means that the drink to bladder ratio gets challenging. There is the magical thing called the \"seal\" but once that is broken, well, you are as they say in some countries, \"screwed.\" Well, on my first weekend as a SF resident, we came here for drinks and my seal was definitely annihilated. And so, I did what any lady would do and excused myself and went to the ladies room. It was towards the end of the night and as seals go, many were in similar states as mine, but here's where the line was crossed.\n\nAs I walked over to the door, I reached for the handle and saw that it was locked. Cool, no worries, I will wait for the young lady to finish. I did, she came out and then I walked in and closed the door behind me. Then not 3 seconds. Count them. 1,2,3 seconds later, someone starts pounding on the door. I'm not talking, \"Helloooo, is anyone in there, may I borrow some sugar\" knocking, but more like a \"Bitch Betta Have My Monaaaay. )(@#&#%)(&!!!\" pound. That, my dear friends, is totally un#@&!ingacceptable.\n\nAnd so I did my business for all of 45 seconds. Did the pounding end? Newp. Did it dull in its rudeness and volume? Newp. Did it piss me the hell off. Oh you bet, and so when I opened the door, I practically hit the broad with the door (intentionally of course) and got right up in her face and said, \"45 seconds! Really. You can't wait 45 fucking seconds!\" To which she responded some gibberish about kicking my keester. Yeah, yeah, yeah, suck it. I was new to town and wasn't all that interested in destroying the girl on a Saturday night and an arrest may have affected my first day at work, so I opted out. But believe me, the temptation was there to knock Impatient Patty the fuck out!\n\nAnyhoo, I came here again last night and definitely had a much nicer experience. There weren't any drunk and unruly broads, just nice, friendly faces and some great nipple art on the wall. I know that sounds weird, but go in and look, this artist is awesome. I had the wine and I will say, it's not the best, but who orders wine at a bar anyway? No biggie and I will definitely be back again :)", "author": "Stephy S."}

Bars on a Friday in the Mission are not only crowded, but generally crowded with really annoying people that I want to stab. \n\nWe walked by this place and I just happened to glance in. The only thing I noticed was that it wasn't packed with people, so we went inside and immediately found a table against the wall. \n\nIt was suitably dark, which always works to my advantage because I like to do sneaky things to my dates under the cover of darkness. There was a DJ spinning cool hip-hop, and a projection screen in the back was playing a retro 70s movie. \n\nThey have a really extensive selection of beers I'm not familiar with. I ordered the one that looked like it had a dead body in a coffin on the handle. It tasted delicious and I'll have to go back to get the name of it.

And, while Flair itself is not particularly cool (see: the opposite), the employment of bottle tossing by one bartender is hardly a fair measure of the establishment.\n\nThe truth is, Dalva is kinda great. They have a really fantastic beer selection, and good draft specials on a regular basis. Also, the \"Hideout\" in the back (when open) makes good cocktails.

Well, for me anyways cuz I love me some Bill Withers.  \nI'm just not a bar girl no matter how hard I try though.  I'm definitely a blow girl and the minute they start serving that at a bar I will NEVER miss a Happy Hour.  However, that is still not the case so I tried to hang with the peeps over a drink at Dalva.  Unfortunately, my drink wasn't great.  I had something with mint in it that wasn't a mojito and while I was initially impressed with the use of fresh mint I quickly realized that it was irritating as I was unable to drink my drink without sucking a friggin' leaf into my straw.  Yuck.  Also not fond of the whole cash only bar thing either.  Granted, I'm not likely to open a huge tab but it's nice to not have to always have cash on hand.  Especially in the Mission.  Not a bad bar otherwise but not something I'm likely to fall head over heels for either.", "author": "Jill D."}

(bacon dogs get five stars on their own, however.)\n\ndalva is one of those bars that i like, but not overly. nothing stands out for me, except the steve mcqueen movies they play, which i really like because they give me an excuse to ignore gross men who try to talk to me, and really, i think EVERY bar should have something like that, an escape route for women, and that it doesn't deserve anything like four or five stars just for providing it in the form of steve mcqueen.", "author": "Irene S."}

This is most definitely one of my favourite places for poetry--not only to read my own work, but to listen to others.\n\nMany open-mic events suffer a seemingly inexorable din from the rest of the coffeehouse/bar--hissing espresso machines, chatter among non-participating patrons, etc.--that makes it next-to-impossible to really listen and consider words.  Not so at Dalva; the main reason being that everyone in the back room is actually there to listen; otherwise they'd be on the other side of the door, in the bar itself.  Walking in, it feels a bit like the scene from Fight Club; the one where everyone is walking straight through the bar to the basement as Tom Waits' \"Goin' Out West\" plays on the jukebox.\n\nHost Jonathan Siegel puts considerable effort into summoning strong, talented feature performers, and it shows.  Often, the only complaint is that the back room is packed too tight, and all those bodies make the temperature rather uncomfortable.

We started the night in the relaxing recesses of  Dalva on 16th Street. Dimly light with red cylindrical glass candle-holders on each dark stained wooden table, it was a perfect atmosphere for a low-key beginning to a long night. The classic B movies they play make Dalva more speakeasy dive than trendy nightspot which was a crowd-pleaser for our group. There's no sense in going to Blondie's, you might as well be in the Marina or Cow Hollow. At Dalva, they played the bizarre and wonderful \"The Snake People\" and if you haven't seen it- it isn't to be missed (Voodoo, Hoodoo, and gyrating half naked people). We watched the movie projected on the large back wall of the place as we sipped our beverages. It was beers all around. The drinks are standard for this type of watering hole. Nothing out of the ordinary except a great spot to chill and (for my ever-so classy friend) a spot in the very back to make out with some guy in a dark corner.
