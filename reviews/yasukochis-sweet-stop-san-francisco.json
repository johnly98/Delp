Got a whole cake for someone's birthday and make sure you call in advance. I called about 1.5 hours in advance and it was fine for me.\n\nAs someone that doesn't like coffee, I was surprised I still enjoyed the cake. The outside is where the coffee crunch is and it really does remind me of caramel. There's a great crunch with the soft inside. The coffee flavor is pretty subtle.

I've been wanting to try this San Francisco legend for a few years now and didnt get a chance to until recently. I dont know what rock I was hiding under growing up in the city but I had never heard about coffee crunch cake when I was younger. \n\nFast forward a decade or three and we are walking inside Super Mira Market to find the Sweet Stop counter (right side) and grab a slice of some cake greatness. The lady behind the counter was great. She was friendly and engaging. There were only a few slices left and 2 whole cakes so I just got one slice. There were a few people behind us in line and the slice was plenty big to be shared by 2 people so it was perfect. And I didnt wanna be greedy and get 2 slices knowing others behind may want to sample them as well. The nice lady offered us forks and it was perfect as we were taking it back to the hotel.\n\nMy first bite was a great one. It It had the coffee crunch bits, some cake, some frosting, some filling, some more cake... Delicious. The topping is quite sweet but the rest of the cake balances it out. The cake was moist and the frosting was tasty. It was a perfect slice of cake IMO. It's all about the coffee crunch topping of course. It was like a crunchy, deep caramel flavor of a topping. The sides of a whole cake are also covered in this crunchy goodness. It's unique and really something to behold. I cant imagine a whole cake... That is something that would make a party for sure. \n\nYou gotta try it. One of the iconic desserts of San Francisco they said... I listened. \n\nCash only.", "author": "Chuck D."}

I ended up ordering slices of the coffee crunch cake and the green tea cake roll.  \n\nThe cake and cream filing was really good but in all honesty the crunch part of the cake was too sweet for me.  A little went a long way for me.  It also tasted more like butterscotch than coffee to me but was fine nonetheless.  \n\nThe green tea cake roll had a hint of green tea flavor.  The cake was tender and moist and the cream filling was light and had a hint of sweetness.  I really enjoyed this cake and could easily return to try the other flavors.\n\nAs a native SFer, I cannot believe that this was my first time at Yasukochi's!  I have had the coffee crunch cake before but wasn't 100% sure it came from here.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was incredibly sweet and kind.

It was already close to noon, and the lady told us they were sold out.\n\nSince we don't live in the city, getting up there early morning on Saturday was not going to be very likely. I had quickly given up on trying to taste this cake, knowing that it was probably never going to happen.\n\nFast forward to a holiday party this weekend... one couple brought the coffee crunch cake to the party! :-O While other guests were still trying to figure out what it was, I recognized it immediately and pounced at this rare opportunity to taste the cake. Cutting myself a generous slice, I enjoyed this cake that I'm sure took the couple some effort to procure. The inside is like a chiffon cake, similar to the inside of an Asian roll cake. Each layer of cake is sandwiched between some whipped cream, but the highlight is the coffee crunch topping. It's kind of like crushed toffee in appearance, but melts in your mouth. The sweetness of the coffee crunch topping pairs perfectly with the actual cake.\n\nI've also heard that the lemon crunch cake and the green tea roll are also fabulous. If you want a slice, it's hard to get without going to the bakery very early. However, if you want an entire cake, you can call ahead to order.

Coffee is still the best seller.\n* Cash or check only. No credit cards. \n* It's a bit sweeter than most other Japanese desserts. \n* Try to finish the cake within 2 days, before the crunchy pieces get soft and stick together like toffee bark. \n* It should be fridged a all times for freshness.

She also asked us if we wanted writing, and that there will be an additional $2 charge. \n\nWhen we got home to cut the cake, it was very hard and sticky. As we took our first bite, we all agreed that the top toffee/coffee crunch was way too sweet and had a burnt aftertaste. The cake itself was hard and frozen-like, whereas the cream was flavorless and also hard. It tasted a bit better when we took a fork full of cake with a bit of toffee/coffee crunch top, instead of consuming each separately. I was only able to finish half of my slice of cake and ended up giving the other half to my boyfriend, then I went ahead to chug water due to the sweetness of the cake.

The cake has three layers of super light sponge cake. Between the layers, there's just a bit of cream and, in guessing, a smear of some sort of coffee/caramel sauce. The crunch part is what makes the cake special. I think the crunch is a more porous toffee, very crunchy and nice burnt sugar flavor. \n\nWhat a great treat.

Yasukochi's been around for 41 years and I didn't know they existed until I read Janet T.'s review last year. Props and shout outs to y'all for talking about the delicious, heavenly coffee crunch cake.\n\nToday is my younger sister's triple 20 day aka the big 6-0. Now all my five siblings and I are in our 60's...yea!!! For this occasion, I felt a coffee crunch cake would be appropriate and I wanted to surprise her and my mom (even though she's diabetic). \n\nBefore leaving on this venture to Yasukochi's, fellow yelper, Albertino M., left me a tip - parking will be problematic or difficult in the area since the Cherry Blossom Festival is going on at the same time. It took my husband and me almost two hours to reach our destination. \n\nDrive and park the car at the Alameda Ferry Terminal about 11:10 AM, then hop on ferry boat to SF Ferry Terminal. Walk to Mission Street to see if I can find the #38 Muni bus for Geary Blvd...no problemo. Husband asked me where do we disembark from the bus. It was no worry as I knew where I was going even though I never caught the #38. I told him we just follow the nice Japanese women passengers and get off at Geary & Laguna. Walk up two blocks to Sutter and then down Sutter to Buchanan...voila. \n\nMy hubby and I walked in to the market, and we totally missed the bakery section until I asked a female customer. She was nice enough to tell me where and I thanked her. Thank you, Janet T., for mentioning in your review to order the cake from them the day before. The employee had my cake ready, packed it in a pink box and I thought hubby and I would be on our way back across the bay...not. We browsed around briefly and darn I did not see the Hello Kitty Truck. \n\nCost of a 9\" coffee crunch cake: $43.00...yum, yum. It was absolutely delicious that I had three slices. OMG, I was such a greedy gut to eat that many pieces. Do I feel like a babuy!?! Maybe I have become a fei gee for being such a glutton over the coffee crunch cake. LOL.\n\nI had coffee crunch cake before from Eastern Bakery in San Francisco Chinatown several times at my job. It was okay, but the texture of Eastern's cake was coarse and dry - cornmeal cake. So move over, Eastern Bakery, and let me enjoy Yasukochi's coffee crunch cake with a cup of hot green tea.\n\nFinally, reliable reviews by my fellow yelpers did not lead me down the wrong path. I was definitely on that happy trail from the SF Ferry Terminal to Yasukochi's. Yes, I shall return for their delectable cake and other goodies.", "author": "Carol C."}

The cream in the cake was certainly my favorite part, the crunch part was perhaps my least favorite since it sort of sticks to your teeth.  The lemon was light and refreshing, and if I had the option of only lemon again, I'd probably go with it.

This roll was out of this world. The roll itself was made out of a moist chocolate cake that I would assume only an expert baker can create in such large quantities  to fill a bakery shelf. It had a light and airy feel when eaten and had the same consistency throughout. The cream was perfect textured with a light fully feel when consumed and a mild sweet flavor which was so refreshing. This really made it stand out from other Bay Area bakeries that either have a good cake texture or cream filling, but not both. In addition to the flavor that made my Saturday, they also have green tea with cream, chocolate with strawberry, and other yummy fillings and treats for purchase.

When it came time to eat, my mom loved it, I loved it, and even my dad who isn't a big dessert fan came for seconds. Overall, soo delicious, and the couple who sold me the cake was so nice and sweet. I need this cake for my birthday!", "author": "Corinna T."}

The coffee crunch bits on top give it such a buttery kick to the subtle sweetness of the cake.  I'm not a dessert person but I crave this cake!  That says a lot.  Love it!  \n\nMy friend and I stopped by one early afternoon just to see if they had any slices left to sell.  We got all nervous because there was one slice left and there were a couple people in line in front of us.  Bite nails, pace a little.  The two people were buying whole cakes of a different kind (I bet any dessert or cookie they make is yummy - they've just got that touch!) for a social gathering.  Ok ok good good, can I buy that one slice of cake now, please (we were planning to split it)?  And just as we were inching forward, the man in the back brought out a full tray of coffee crunch cake.  We whooped and hollered with glee!! - I think they get a kick out of the joy we feel about their cakes!  They also sell the coffee crunch bits separately in a bag - to add to your own cakes?  Or eat it straight out of the bag?  I'm not sure - either way, it's going to be good but not as good as the combination of their cake and the coffee crunch bits on top.\n\nSeriously though, it is some really good stuff!  We had lunch, did some shopping and took the bus home.  As soon as I got home, I served it up (a slice for each of us, thank you!) for my bf and I and oh wow, total silence as we ate so happily.

Tender layers of chiffon (I think?) sandwiched between cream, with caffeinated crispy crumbles on the outside will make your tastebuds stand up and belt out a showstopper.\n\nThe cake keeps well too. Crunchies soften some, but keep your precious pastries in an airtight container. CCC was fine three days later in the fridge.\n\nTake away messages: Cash only, closed Sundays and Mondays.

After \"looking\" for 10 minutes, they realized that someone had written \"Fri, 3/21\" instead of \"Sat, 3/21\" ... At least they got the date right so they knew that they were at fault.

The fluffy cake in between layers of light frosting mixed in with Violet Crumble-like candy was hands down one of the best cakes I've ever had although it didn't have as much \"coffee\" flavor as I expected.

I heard amazing things about this cake so I had to make my way to Japantown to try it. Once we got there, my friends and I got overly ambitious and decided to order not only the coffee crunch cake, but also a slice of the lemon crunch, and a slice of the vanilla/strawberry roll! \n- Turns out that the cake lives up to the hype! All the cakes were moist and fluffy but what really gave it the 5 stars was the \"crunch\" topping!! I don't know what it's made out of but it's so unique and tasty!! I've never had anything like it before! (I was going to take a picture but I got too excited and finished more than half the cake by the time I remembered... aha oops )  \n- The coffee crunch and the lemon crunch are tied in tastiness in my opinion :) Just go for whatever you're craving, lemon or coffee. \n\n** I really love small family owned businesses and I'm a huge supporter of it.

I think it is a little sweet to eat on its own, but it pairs very well with a cup of black coffee, which is my bet for why it is called \"coffee\" crunch cake. \n\nSo many things in this world do not live up to their hype, but this cake is definitely not one of them. \n\nIf you are in the neighborhood, you must try this cake. I don't know if they sell slices, but you can order a whole cake as long as you call the day before. Plan ahead. Do whatever it takes. I am not really a \"cake person,\" and I didn't know what to expect. I mean, you see all of the pictures online here and wonder what the heck is that cake made of?!?  \n\nIf you are familiar with seafoam candy (or the \"Violet Crunch\" candy bar), that's pretty much what the coating of this cake is made of. On its own, it is very sweet, but also has the bitterness of dark caramel. This is complemented by the creamy frosting that holds it in place on the outside of the cake and also separates 4 layers of the lightest white sponge-type cake that I've ever had. The slight bitterness of the crunchy coating is a perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the frosting and the lightness of the cake itself. You get sweet and bitter (not in a bad way), creamy and crunchy, all wrapped together with a very light and tasty cake. \n\nA friend picked this up for me in San Francisco and I carried it on the plane back to Phoenix where we had it for dessert, then I ate it for breakfast (2x) and a snack a couple of days later. For the best experience, I recommend eating it on the day that you get it, but even after 5 days in the refrigerator, this cake was still very tasty and the topping retained a lot of its crunch.\n\nI don't know what other goodies they sell at this place, but I am going to find out on my next trip! There is a reason they have been around for 41+ years. No lie, it might be just because of this cake, but I am hopeful that there is even more.", "author": "Doug B."}

Their heavenly coffee crunch cake. \n\nYou're probably wondering what could possibly make this cake so appealing. It's just cake after all.

It would be too rich to eat by itself, but paired with the soft and creamy cake underneath it all comes together to be one of the best cakes I have had. \n\nDefinitely give this cake a shot if you get the chance, and don't let the fact that the storefront is nestled in the back corner of a small grocery mart turn you away.", "author": "Mark O."}

Yes, I walked here from Union Square for the sake of cake from Japantown.\n\nThis place is inside the Japanese market and it's a very modest setup. They have other sweets, but I had my eye on the prize - Coffee Crunch Cake. It was soft sponge cake, with a light cream filling, and the delicious, crunchy, yummy, mmmm mmmm good coffee crunch on the outside. Those pieces of crunchy toffee are the best... seriously! This was so damn good and I want some more!\n\nI ended up buying a couple of slices for our stay in San Francisco and had it as a snack. I also gave some to some friends as a thank you for taking us around. \n\nThe lady helping us was nice and friendly especially considering they just opened and it was pretty early in the morning. She put both my orders in two separate boxes and wrapped it with a nice ribbon.\n\nThis place is definitely wroth the stop! Just as a side note, your cake should be refrigerated or kept in a very cool place to ensure it stays yummy!", "author": "Hugh H."}

It's soft, moist and not coyingly sweet.  They have 3 varieities: vanilla, chocolate and lemon. An 8\" cake will run you about $31 and yes you might get a cheaper knock off at Red Ribbon or other Asian bakeries.  But Yasukochi's is the real deal.  When you ask for it sliced, they will charge you an extra $2 and they slice the thing down the middle and put it in two separate boxes.  That's a little shady though because sliced to me means portioned slices not 2 big pieces of cake.  But Debbie behind the counter had mad customer service skills and after all she was doling out some really good cake which for all I care they could have served in a shoe worn by a homeless guy, it was that good.\n\nParking is a bit of a hassle, thought not too bad during the earlier part of the day.

Nothing like the crispy and chewy bear claws I've had at other bakeries. And on top of it this place is cash only and has zero ambiance.

BUT there's benches right across the street with a nice view of japantown and they kind of wrap each slice is wax paper so we just picked it up and stuffed our faces that way =p\n\nOnto the cakes!\n\nWe got a slice of each of the guava cake, green tea & strawberry rolls... HOLY MOLY they were good! Still totally worth the trip! The cakes are soft and airy with perfectly whipped frosting to match!\n\nThe green tea had a nice strong flavor, while the guava was more subtle with the flavor still being present. I liked that their strawberry wasn't too sweet and tasted all natural! I think my favorite cake was the guava while my boyfriend's was the strawberry. The green tea was wonderful too and would highly recommend it to any green tea lovers! We will definitely be back for that coffee toffee cake though!", "author": "Melissa C."}

I go pick it up before they close, keep it in a cooler in the car, and kill time in Japantown until our dinner reservation. \nI retrieve the cake from the car & bring it to the restaurant asking them to serve it for dessert. Some places charge a small fee for \"dessert corkage\", some don't. It doesn't matter. This cake is worth it. \nI only buy slices depending on the # of people attending our dinner because a whole cake serves 8-10 people & I don't want to bring leftovers home. Portion control and all that. This way I can have my cake but still be mindful of when & how often I can indulge. \nYasukochi rocks!\nP. S.\nTried the lemon roll & chocolate mocha roll. Wowzer!

They only accept cash and check and they have a sign on their counter to that effect (I was lucky I actually had cash on me, forgetting that also after having read the reviews).\n\nI've baked desserts at home most of my life so I get a kick out of visiting various bakeries to compare their items and quality.  I was able to try their strawberry in phyllo and except for being a bit more baked (as seen by how brown the phyllo were), the strawberry in phyllo tasted light with fresh strawberries as everyone said and while they don't have a vast selection such as Schubert's, I would LOVE to have a bakery like theirs in my neighborhood.

The thing I love about cakes from here is that they are always full of flavor, has the best combination of texture, and they don't give you a food coma even after eating a huge box of sushi.  \n\nListen to this, they get sold out quick so if you want a piece of the coffee crunch, chocolate crunch, and other population sliced cakes get there before noon if not earlier.  \n\nOne time I got there and saw 2pc of coffee crunch cake sitting in the glass shelf, but the owner said they were reserved.  Therefore, I am guessing that she may take reservations for frequent shoppers (???). \n\nAn 8\" Coffee Crunch Cake is $29.50, per piece of any cake if $3.85 as of early March/2013.   \n\nCash only!", "author": "Louis T."}

I'm not too familiar with Japanese bakeries but I will keep coming back. The office had a birthday and we wanted to try something new for our coworkers birthday cake. I did a quick search on yelp and saw this as one of the highest reviewed place. \n\nThe shop was in some random Japanese market. We had no idea but I remember the picture that was posted up and decided to walk in to see. (Thanks to whomever posted that, it was a real help!). We saw the guava cake and the coffee crunch cake and the size of the coffee crunch was the deciding factor. It was GINORMOUS. 4 freaking layers of orgasms- one right after the other. I couldn't take it when I tried it. I had to get 3 more slices! \n\nThe lady at the shop was so friendly and so cute. $26 for the 8in round.

Unfortunately, they were all sold out of the coffee crunch by the slice (go figures...you def. have to come early in the morning for those babies!) since we came too late in the afternoon.  :(  Instead, we opted to try some of their other cakes, got ourselves a slice of the guava cake, a piece of the chocolate strawberry roll, and a slice of the fairly new chocolate crunch.  Oh man, the chocolate crunch was delicious, I might like it even more than the coffee crunch since it gives off a rich chocolate flavor and still have the crunchy goodness sprinkled on top.  If anything, maybe a little bit more of the chocolate crunch toppings to make the cake even better!  :)\n\nAt $3 a piece, I love how they offer their cakes by the slice, definitely helps satisfy a craving without having to wait for a birthday or a special occasion to purchase a whole cake.

I went super early one morning on a Friday. Japan town is usually pretty quiet around the morning, but I still parked in the lot a street down... to only find that there was a perfect 30 minute metered parking right on the corner of the market where Sweet Shop is located... GRR! So prior to heading to the shop, I called in to reserve a cake because I heard they sell out quick.. well that was unnecessary but it's better to be safe than sorry. The owner (lady) was very nice and friendly and put a chocolate crunch cake to the side for me to pick up. Sure enough, no one was there and all the cakes and pastries for the day looked untouched. Along with the cake, I decided on two slices of coffee crunch cake for me and my parents to try out and a slice of chocolate crunch for my friend. Everything went smoothly and I went back home and put everything in the fridge because there is a lot of cream in the cakes.. didn't want it to spoil or anything! I couldn't resist any longer and took a bite of the coffee crunch cake and it was really good.. you definitely have to have some crunch with every bite of cake or it's kind of boring.. but yes it is really yummy. The chocolate crunch one was okay to me.. it was good but I definitely prefer the coffee one. Everything came out to $40, so it wasn't bad at all.", "author": "Tiff C."}

No joke! Well worth the money spent.\n\nHowever, if you do get there a bit late but still have a craving for something sweet, almost anything else they have is amazing. Personally I like the roll cakes-- the Vanilla Cake w/ Strawberry filling is my fav. It's got REAL strawberries mixed in with the creme...\n\nThe Strawberry Pastry is also quite yummy-- strawberries sandwiched between flaky pastry and whipped cream. \n\nMy little sister swears by the Bear Claw and Mini Almond Ring Pastry. \n\nAs a kid I loved the Jam cookies and the Sugar Cookie Ring with mini ball sprinkles--- glad to see that they still have those around!", "author": "Jessica Q."}

Thank goodness they sell individual pieces though, or else I would have to order a whole cake every few months... this is a great marketing strategy on the owners end. \n\nAnyways, the cake is just perfect. The thing I like most about the cake itself is that it's not too sweet. So even if the coffee crunch is a bit \"sweet\" to some people, the cake balances out the taste so it works out. The cake here is always fresh because come 5pm every day they're opened, I'm sometimes rejected from the store with no more cake to purchase. Not only that but the coffee crunch cake slices are a HIT, if you don't call in to ask them to put it aside before 12:00 pm everyday, don't expect to walk in at 2:00pm finding any slices left. Not only is the coffee crunch cake a hit, but definitely give the strawberry chocolate cake a try, it'll almost NEVER disappoint. I actually think the Strawberry Chocolate roll is more of a go to for me than the coffee crunch. It's just the right amount of sweet and they use actual strawberry pieces in their cream which is DELICIOUS. The cream is homemade by the amazing baker, and it's not too heavy or anything. Just thinking about it as I write this is making me crave more! \nThe very sweet couple that owns the places has been there for years, and they make a heck of a team! If not both, one of them can bake nothing but delightful treats while the other has beautiful penmanship which is perfect for any celebration cakes! They are super pretty precise with what you order and is almost always willing to correct their mistakes if they ever make any. 100% customer satisfaction guaranteed ;) \nAnd to top it ALL off.... They're a family of basketball and they have their mark in Asian American basketball leagues!", "author": "Johanna T."}

My family has been coming here for 30 years, usually getting the coffee crunch or dream cake, and sometimes the strawberry shortcake. For my dad's birthday, he wanted a strawberry shortcake with chocolate cake instead of white. We called in the order and were told it would be $1 extra to customize it to chocolate, which was fine and we did.\n\nWe picked up the cake ($31) and took it home. Once we cut it open, we found basically one sheet of cake that had been cut in half, and about 2 inches of whipped cream inside. He had cut strawberries in halves instead of slices, and filled up the middle of the cake with just these halves of strawberries and a ton of whipped cream. There was more whipped cream than cake.\n\nIt was the most disappointing birthday cake ever. My dad was understandably very unhappy as we could have just gone to Schubert's, paid less, and gotten a better cake.\n\nTypically Sweet Stop's strawberry shortcakes have multiple layers of cake, thinly sliced strawberries in layers with whipped cream much like their coffee crunch cake. This time, the guy was just being lazy and made a really crappy cake.", "author": "Tiff L."}

I hadn't noticed that scent before, because I think I only came in the afternoons.  I've come here many times when the bakery looked closed.  Yelp didn't have the hours.  They open at 9:30 AM, M-Saturday.  They close at 5:30 PM on M-F and 5 PM on Saturday.  They have their numerous magazine and newspaper mentions on display as well as the People Love Us on Yelp sticker.  For those of you who are not familiar with Yasukochi's - yes, it's Japanese and it's inside a Japanese market.\n\nThis time I arrived right after they opened.  I've never seen the bakery case look so full before.  The selection is wider than I realized.  Besides cakes, they have cookies, danishes (family size & individual size), croissants, and bread (sold by the loaf).  I kept reading about the coffee crunch cake and I saw that they had a lemon crunch flavor too.  As for the cake roll slices, there are about 6 varieties including lemon w/ vanilla cake, mocha, chocolate with whipped cream, etc.  They also had a wide variety of chiffon cakes (family size only).  And they had the famous guava cake.  Nothing is labeled and prices are not displayed.\n\nI decided to go with the chocolate cake roll slice with strawberry cream ($2.95).  It's a substantial slice - larger and heavier than the cake roll slices I'm used to - a sign of quality.  The slice is dusted with ample amounts of powdered sugar.  The slice is a good 1 inch thick with more cream than usual.  The cake is moist, not too sweet and with a light chocolate flavor.  The slightly sweetened pink whipped cream is chilled and the strawberry pieces were frozen (there weren't too many of them).  It would much taste better with fresh strawberries.  This place isn't delicate like Satura but it's more homey and mom & pop.  Watch out, serious sugar overload ahead.", "author": "Lolia S."}

When I stole a bite from my friend I had to go back and buy myself some more. It's soft in the middle with the perfect blend of sugar bound to make anyone's day better.", "author": "April K."}

He had wanted a coffee crunch cake from a small shop at Japantown and though it's the eternal NO-parking situation as usual, I did finally find a spot and went to the location.

I was advised the \"good stuff\" usually disappears soon after opening, and I believe it!! Stopped there today at about 11:20AM, and already there were four empty cake spots!!! The kind mature japanese woman treated me very kindly and was very courteous. I asked for two slices of the SF-famous Coffee Crunch Cake which was still in cake form. She cut two generous slices, patiently wrapped each in tissue, then enclosed them within a small box, tying the box closed with a thin pink ribbon. The sugary coffee-flavored \"crunch\" added a welcome change to soft-top cakes, and was delicious as was the whole slice itself - I don't normally eat or even like desserts so if you see me buy one let alone eat it, it must be DARN good!!! Well-worth the tedious patience in finding a parking spot - better to go with someone who can go and jump out to get it while you wait like the bank bandit!!!

Anything I write will not explain the delicious piece of heaven that is in every bite. You just have to get yourself down to the Sweet Stop and pay a mere $2.95 for a slice. Oh yeah, $2.95 is what they charge for each slice of cake that I mentioned above.\n\nThe lady behind the counter is the owner and she is as sweet as sugar.

There were so many days where we popped in at noon and everything we wanted was sold out. We were determined alright, even if I was about to fall asleep in front of the cakes.\n\nAs we we were paying, the sweet woman behind the counter told us that we need to have our yummy treats refrigerated fairly soon. My sister and I exchanged looks and told her that we still planned on doing lots of shopping. She told us not to worry and that she can hold onto our desserts and that we could come back for it when we were done. My sister gave her a five dollar bill as an extra tip for being sweet, and after lots of playful fighting, the woman took it.\n\nWhen we were done shopping and got home, we opened the bag only to find an envelope -- the woman returned the $5. How cute!\n\nHomey, wonderful, and helpful service paired with amazingly light, fluffy, sweet cakes makes for a wonderful stop that everyone needs to try.", "author": "Vinh N."}

I immediately thought of yelp.  My friend Elieen had just reviewed Yasukochi, and I thought ... coffee crunch ... Sutter.  This has to be the place!  And it is.  My mom suggested to get this cake for my sister's upcoming birthday, so maybe I will do that.\n\nI bought slices of the Lemon and Coffee Crunch.  Actually, the last two each for the day, at around 5:00.  So if you wanted some tonight, and the tray was empty, blame me.  ** note my evil grin **\n\nAnyway, these cakes are not overly sweet, and are very good.  Sponge cake, with whipped cream, and either lemon or coffee crunches.  Four slices cost me about $11.  You really have to look for this place, as it's inside of a supermarket, and they have early hours.  Other cakes are available, as are pies, cookies, and other good stuff.\n\nRed Ribbon Bakery has a similar cake, but this one blows it out of the water.  If you like that one, you will LOVE this one.\n\nSo, go, buy a slice or two of each, but be sure to bring either cash or check ... they do not accept credit cards!", "author": "Michael M."}

But at the risk of blaspheming, I will say it's not my favorite--I still like Schubert's the best.  Why? 2 reasons: first, the \"crunch\" in this coffee cake is made of bits of caramel, and I'm not big on caramel (if only it were made out of nuts instead).  And second, the cake itself, while perfect, has more of a traditional birthday/wedding cake texture (it even has layers of whipped cream), whereas I like coffee cake to be a little more bready or pastry-esque.  However, I spied a lot of other delicious cakes here too, like the lemon or guava ones, so I will definitely be back to try some of those.\n\nAlso, bonus points for the friendly service and cute store-within-a-store location.", "author": "Wes M."}

Every bite tastes like fluffy clouds floating in the sky. The balance between cream and cake is absolutely fabulous. The best part is, the sweetness level of the cake is just right.

I had gotten into the whole Asian Bakery thing thanks to a birthday cake I had from San Jose.\n\nI get there around 1pm on a Tuesday, determined to try the coffee crunch cake that I heard so much about only to find out ALL the slices are gone.  The only thing they had was a full sized cake.  Well this was my last day in California and my only day in SF so I went with the full sized cake.  I figured I was going to a party a friend's house and could bring that as a desert.\n\nI get to the party and the cake sits there cause no one wanted to be first (it looks so pretty all caramel colored) so since I brought it I figured I'd be the first.  I sliced off thin piece, tried it, and was instantly transported to food heaven, desert division.  It was perfect, not too sweet, not too heavy, not too spongy.  The cake was a toffee like flavor that was very light and the frosting wasn't over powering.  Then you get the surprise burst of flavor from the crunch things as they melt away after one bite.  The crunch things had the texture of a burned marshmallow but tasted like toffee/caramel. The frosting was light and most likely whipped cream based. \n\nI am a sweet tooth and usually I can't stop eating sweets.  But for this cake, I savored every single bit and took my time.  I knew if I took the cake home, I'd eat the whole thing so, I became the Cake Pimp.\n\nI went around the whole party and talked up the cake and told people they had to try it. 15 minutes later, the cake was all gone.  I became known as the girl who brought the cake and made instant friends :-) I find it amusing that *I* who does not live in SF introduced roughly 20 locals to this great locally own bakery that's down the street from them. \n\nIt's located at the corner of Sutter & Buchanan right across from Japantown plaza (pedestrian only area?).  It's inside Super Mira Supermarket which you will probably only notice the Mira part when coming from the street.  I'm not sure how much street parking there is as my friend dropped me off and drove around the block to pick me up as there was no parking available at that time.\n\nI'm not sure about the hours but since everyone says they close early (early is so relative people!) I went as soon as I got into SF.  Given that there were no individual slices left and a few full sized cakes, I can image that they close as soon as the last cake is sold.  I would try to get there in the morning to try and increase your chances.\n\nHere I am nearly a month and a half later and I'm still craving this cake.

I had an appointment to get my hair done at Notorious hair salon so I thought  I'd pick a few slices up for the girls to try too. \n\nThe lady at the shop (didn't catch her name, I was too busy drooling over the case) was kind enough to deal with my indecisive wavering and increasing order size, and complicated cake separation without any hint of impatience.\n\nI got two coffee crunch and one lemon crunch for the Notorious ladies and one coffee crunch and one Hawaiian Delight (guava) cake slice for JR and I to try.  The ladies loved the crunch cakes and I couldn't WAIT to get home to try ours!

Guess what? They did. \n\nThe Coffee Crunch Cake was delicious. Light, moist cake, lightly sweetened whipped cream filling and a yummy coffee brittle-like topping was generously sprinkled and pressed into the whipped cream frosting. It was a really good balance of crunchy, sweet and soft, and the coffee crunch wasn't overpowering at all. \n\nThe Guava cake slice was good as well, although in a different league. it  had what tasted like a bright swath of seedless strawberry jelly on the top which gave it a more pronounced fruit flavor, but still it was quite yummy! The true test was JR having more than a bite- he usually only has one or two bites of sweets and he's finished- he actually helped me finish both slices!\n\nOnly downside to my whole experience was the quest for parking, which was absurdly lacking for a noon-ish Saturday afternoon.

Now, those same kids are married with children. \n\nThe coffee-crunch cake is tops.  I don't recall the source, but either the baker worked at Blum's on Union Sqr. or received permission after Blum's closed to use the coffee crunch receipe.  (There was another notable coffee-crunch cake baker in Chinatown (Eastern Bakery) if I recall.  Coffee-crunch cakes must be consumed on the day it is made - the shelf-life of the crunch is probably about 10 hours refrigerated.\n\nThe crown jewel at Yasukochi's is the strawberry cake.  Large, ripe whole strawberrys imbedded with a red glaze and surrounded by whip cream.  Order it as a cake or a sheet - the strawberries must be handpicked by the baker, they are all uniformly at the peak of sweetness.", "author": "Joe R."}

I have to put it on my calendar to pick up a whole cake here the next time a special occasion requiring one arises.  I keep on forgetting!  When I do come by the market this bake shop is housed in, I always walk over to check out what's in the display case.  On my most recent visit, I got 2 slices to go: a Chocolate Crunch and a Vanilla Cake roll with Strawberry Cream.  Like I said, YUMMY!  I love their crunch cakes.  Great for those with a sweet tooth.  You can even buy the crunch topping on its own, to top whatever you like.  Just a warning for the non-sweet tooths out there, this cake may not be for you.  The cake itself isn't overly sweet, but the topping may be over the top for you guys.  Just scrape it off and hand it over to someone who does love sugar.  Try one of the cake rolls instead.  The Chocolate Crunch was really good.  I'm not usually a big fan of chocolate cakes, either.  This was not dried out, thank goodness.  It was just right.  The crunch topping made me feel like a kid again.  Crunch, Crunch, Crunch....MMMMMM....  I've tried Lemon Crunch and the Coffee Crunch.  They're all great.  They have a guava cake, too, no crunch on it though.  I'll have to try it again to update my review.\n\nI'm eating the Vanilla Roll with the Strawberry Cream right now, but sharing, because I have to.  It's strawberry season, so there's some fresh ones in the filling, too.  This dessert is not too sweet, but once again, just right.  Very satisfying, without making me feel too guilty for eating dessert. They also have a green tea one, and a few others.  \n\nI first heard about Yasukochi's Sweet Stop in an article I read, explaining the famed crunch cakes and how they are carrying on the tradition from some now long gone bakery.  So, I had to seek them out and I am so glad I did.  I haven't tried everything they offer, yet.  They also have cookies and pastries, but for me, the main draw are the cakes.  I just need to remember they're not open on Sunday or Monday, so that I can time my visits to the grocery store for when they are open.  I think they may be cash only, so make sure you have some of that if you stop by.

To stick to the calorie restrictions of the day, or indulge in the joys of eating a Hawaiian Mochi.  To those not in the know about Hawaiian Mochi, it's very, very similar to Filipino bibingka, which would be a national Filipino dessert, if there was such a thing.

As Toro E pointed out, the counter and the cakes don't look appealing at all and certainly not screaming attention although the color of the strawberry cream is in a horrifying shocking pink which screamed attention! I asked bf if he was sure he wanted something from there, he insisted, ok, there is no stopping him. Lord and behold when we brought the slice home, it tasted so good, I didn't want to share the heavenly goodness! Not with bf and not with anyone! My gawd.....it was so soft and spongy, not overly sweet and just fresh with bits of strawberry! \nWe went for a returned visit and bought the coffee crunch cake and chocolate vanilla slice and they were all divine!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-09", "description": "\"If your expectations are great enough, you will always be disappointed.\"\nThere are only a few things in life that your expectations are truly met. I'd say, true love, your first born, and maybe your first grandchild. And now, this coffee crunch cake from Yasukochi's Sweet Stop.\nThe first time I had this cake was in 2001, when I was a freshman in college. One of my buddies in my dorm who grew up in San Francisco brought in a cake for his Birthday. He said he has always had this cake for his birthday and that it came from a hole in a wall place.\nI had a slice and I was in love. I was never a cake person, though I've always had a sweet tooth. The cake, it was everything that a good cake should be. Sponge cake itself was moist, soft but not too soft. The whipped cream was fresh, milky, creamy and most importantly not sweetened. That was the most surprising thing to me, the unsweetened whipped cream made the cake so amazing. And the coffee crunch. Oh the coffee crunch. Crispy, crunchy, chewy. Coffee and toffee. When mixed with the whipped cream, it was a dream combination.\nI eventually lost contact with that friend and I never got the name of the place, only that the cake was covered in yellow coffee crunch and had un-sweetened cream. The cake itself came in a pink bakery box and sold in a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place somewhere in San Francisco. Great.\nAnd so my great search began. I went from old China Town (Eastern Bakery - coffee crunch was too small and dark brown. No coffee crunch in the layers of the cake) to new China Town (Schubert's - Coffee crunch cake was basically a regular cake with coffee crunch in the layers. The cakes they bake came in white boxes with a see-through top.Great cake, but not THE cake) Japan Town to Little Italy. Nothing. Over the years, my mind grew tired of searching and kind of assumed Schubert's was the one. But truth be told, in the back of my mind, I knew it couldn't be the one. There was just too many inconsistencies, too many loose ends. But what could I do? In a city FILLED to the gills with \"hole-in-the-wall\" bakeries and not to mention San Francisco was home to Blum's THE originator of the Coffee Crunch cake. The search would probably consume the rest of my life.\nFast forward to 2008:\nMy girl friend, somehow, some way found a small place called Yasukochi's Sweet Stop Bakery in Japan Town. She asked me could this be the one. This place was small, in fact it didn't even have a store. It's INSIDE a small grocery market on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan (Super Mira's) It's a stand maybe 6' wide at the corner of this small discreet store. In my original search, I literally walked by this store without looking in.\nWell, long story short. This is THE cake. Just the way I remembered. Pink box, hole in the wall, covered in yellow coffee crunch, and that oh-so-good unsweetened, fresh whipped cream.\nIt's funny that finding this cake reminded me of a lot of related/unrelated things that happened in the past 7 years. All the people I've told my crazy cake finding expedition story to. All the people I've asked about \"the coffee crunch cake covered in coffee crunch that came in a pink box from a hole in the wall bakery\". All the people I've given Schubert's business cards to.(Sorry to all those people, THIS is the place.) At the end of this crazy story, sitting in front of me is a pink bakery box, and in it, is an 8\" round cake. This simple cake probably only took a couple of hours to make, but it took me 7 years to find.\nYes folks, if your expectations are great enough, you'll eventually find the one that you've been searching for.", "author": "Foodatarianism L."}

I had seen a short segment on tv about this place last year and thought I'd give them a try (it was this or several goodies from Tartine).  \n\nAfter reading a few of the reviews I thought it was best I arrive early so I didn't miss out on the infamous Coffee Crunch Cake.   We were very lucky and found a space less than a block away.  It also helped that it was Friday around 11am.\n\nWandering in, we found the bakery just as someone had mentioned; turn right as you enter the market.  We bought 1 whole cake for the party and 5 slices to try with my folks.  For them, we picked the strawberry in yellow and chocolate sponge roll, the guava, the lemon crunch and coffee crunch. \n\nWhen we dropped it off to them, I had to sample a bite of everything but the coffee crunch.  The strawberry in both yellow and chocolate was YUMMY; very moist sponge cake with strawberry cream that wasn't super sweet.  The lemon crunch was ok.  It wasn't overly sweet and it was moist.  I was HORRIBLY disappointed with my guava slice though.  It tasted like it was left sitting in the fridge for 3 days - the cream and the spongy layer was so hard that I spat it out.  \n\nAfter dinner, three of us tried the coffee crunch cake.  We all agreed it was good but too sweet and a few of the crunch pieces tasted stale while others were very crunchy.  No one had seconds and no one wanted to take the cake home.  \n\nOverall, I was disappointed.   If I go back, I'm going to stick with the strawberry sponge rolls.", "author": "Angie C."}

The coffee crunch cake, lemon crunch cake and the chocolate with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  They  are are the bomb.  The best thing is that the cakes aren't too sweet but just right.  Everytime I come here, I can't make up my mind.  So, what I do is get a slice of each cake they have and endulge!", "author": "Susan W."}

The sweet little lady told me the coffee crunch toppings were available but no more slices. I bought the guava slice instead which was spectacular, but I HAD to try the coffee cake. Going through who I was going to share with, I opted and bought the entire coffee cake, which definitely was the best idea I had all day. The cake was fantastically covered with coffee crunch bits and light whipped cream and moist cake. Every bite was joy. I do admit the cake was bit on the sweeter side, but what do you expect from yummy gooey goodness! \n\nThey had different cakes available that I will definitely go back to try.", "author": "Lily L."}

Coffee Crunch Cake! \n\nAfter reading the other reviews, I realize that for decades, i've never tried that many things at Sweet Stop. i always fall for the CCC. Must try other ones.\n\nThe Yasukochi's are SOOOOO nice. (And I mean genuinely nice, not fake nice.)  If only more people in the world were like them.", "author": "C K."}

We come to San Francisco often for family events, etc. This past weekend, I threw a surprise party for my husband's 40th birthday at a local San Francisco Restaurant and bar and wanted to order a cake from San Francisco as well. My husband loves anything haupia so I googled haupia cake in San Francisco and Yasukochi's Sweet Stop was the only one that made haupia cake. I decided to give it try without a tasting it. I got lucky! All I can say is that the haupia cake is absolutely ONOlicious!!!! That was the best cake ever!!! This is the city's best kept secret.", "author": "Myra E."}

She is half Japanese so I thought she would really enjoy it.   I asked that I be able to pick it up at 9:30AM the following week.  However, the day before I picked up the cake, I called them to change the pickup time to 1PM.  Then I had to call them back that same day to change it back to 9:30AM because my friend wouldn't be around in the afternoon to receive her cake.  \n\nI called the sweet shop to let them know that I had to change the order back to a morning pickup.  The woman who answered said that the cake pickup time could not be changed back to the morning.  I asked her nicely how they had planned to finish the cake by 9:30AM for my original order, and instead of answering me, she handed the phone to the owner.  He was very short with me and said that I could not have the cake because he was getting an order of strawberries delivered tomorrow morning.  I asked him what other options there were for a birthday cake, and he told me, with a very rude tone, that he didn't know and that I'd just have to find out when I arrived there the next day.  We went back and forth with him refusing to give me any options to choose from for a cake.  And when I asked how I was supposed to order a cake without knowing what type of cakes were available, he said \"oh well\".  He then said that  I couldn't have a cake by 9:30AM.  I told him I never specified 9:30AM, just that I was hoping to get one in the morning.  Then he conceded that maybe he could have one done by 10:30AM.  So I said that would be fine, but then he said, \"no, 11AM\".  So I said ok, and he essentially hung up on me.\n\nNeedless to say, I called back and cancelled the order.  I don't care how good their cake is.  They have a real attitude problem, and there was no need to be so rude to a customer.  It really turned me off and I have no inclination to give people like that any business.", "author": "Jupiter S."}

I was having a second thought for a second, but I decided to give it a try and got a Guava cake for a party. It surprised me with its taste. The cake and the cream are the tastes of the homemade, but the cake has the professional level of integrity as a whole. The famous Coffee Crunch Cake was sold out, so it must be very good, too. Also the lady in the shop was very friendly and nice. Try their cake and you won't regret it.", "author": "Charlie S."}

I am in search of my 2010 wedding cake and think I may have found it here!  I picked up a strawberry roll, a lemon roll, a slice of their famous coffee crunch cake, and a slice of guava cake.  The strawberry and lemon rolls were just ok.  The cake was too dry for us.  The strawberry filling was good.  Pretty pink color... The lemon filling was too sweet and too tangy at the same time... Now the coffee crunch and guava cakes are totally on another level.  The cakes and fillings were fluffy, light, and not too sweet.  The coffee bits topping are not hard candy hard but rather has this airy lightness that's not overpoweringly sweet.  Everyone of us loved both cakes.  My sister is calling the shop tomorrow to order the coffee crunch cake for her daughter's birthday this weekend!  Cash only and pay attention when looking for this little gem or else you may pass it up like I did the first time (as it's located inside a grocery store).", "author": "Amy T."}
