Despite it being around 4 o' clock, there was a good amount of people inside already, but getting a seat wasn't that hard. We were right on time for the happy hour menu, but alas, there wasn't any options that included something with a hearty side of rice. On to the other menu, I suppose.\n\nWe settles on a plate of black pepper beef and spaghetti with an iced coffee (The hot version comes free, but the cold/iced version cost a buck extra) and the pork chop with rice. The iced coffee was a bit too sweet for me and tasted a lot like milk tea. They must have spiked the milk or something. Our food arrived and they looked great! \n\nPork chop with onions and rice\n- The size took us by surprise. Luckily, we didn't order anything else other than the spaghetti because I doubt we'll be able to finish it. If you've ever had salt and pepper pork chops, imagine that along with a sweet and salty gravy on top. It was decent and the pork chop stayed relatively crisp throughout.\n\nBlack pepper beef with spaghetti\n- The portion was spot on for the price and tasted alright. You taste more of the veggies that come with it like bell peppers, onion and bean sprouts, but that's to be expected in Chinese restaurant noodle dishes. \n\nThe bill came out to be $15.77 which isn't bad for lunch for two. We were relatively full and left satisfied. Service was rather quick, but the waitress there could smile a bit more. She just gave the entire restaurant a really bad vibe.

This is one of two popular Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood that I have yet to review.  In fact, I hadn't even tried it until this past weekend.\n\nThe waitresses talk to you in a rude tone of Cantonese.  It's almost as if they're barking at you.  It must be their training since I encountered two rude waitresses with just one visit.  If you've grown up in San Francisco and eaten at many Chinese restaurants in the City this shouldn't bother you.  In fact, rude waitstaff at Chinese restaurants is often expected.  They speak Mandarin too so I'm certain they can bark at you in Mandarin if you desire.\n\nI ordered my staple dish of Dry Fried Beef Chow Fun.  That's my go-to dish at most Chinese restaurants that I visit for the first time.  I must say that 2546 Caf\u00e9 makes a good version with lots of noodles and very little white onion or bean sprouts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OS-inNsv-GFH_qrk1_rfDg?select=EccDTMgutqPoyNgSkEI4YQ).  The pool of oil underneath is to be expected since chow fun is normally a greasy dish.  That's why they give you hot tea to wash it all down with.  The beef was a bit chewy even though it seemed to have been tenderized with baking soda.  They must use fairly low grade beef.\n\nAll in all with rude service and all, I can now say, \"2546?  Been there, done that!\"  It cost me less than 6 bucks not including tip so prices are definitely on par if you're in the neighborhood looking for Hong Kong style cheap Chinese food.  Me?

(You only have wars when you know the place is on and poppin). \n\nFood wise:\n*Tomato beef noodles; depends on which chef is cooking, but you have chow mein noodles cooked with beef, onions, bell peppers and tomatoes which makes this dish oh so saucy.\n\nBlack Pepper Fried Rice; It's simple fried rice with a zast of black pepper which being the spicy food eater that I am, loves bc it hits the spot. \n\nChicken Udon; Udon noodles stir fried with black pepper, bean sprouts, green onions and succulent chicken. \n\nTomato Beef Pan Fried Noodles; Just as good as the original tomato beef but with crunchy noodles which has become my ultimate favorite by far. \n\nTofu Clay Pot; Tofu cooked with tons of veggies and all sorts of meats so you have little bit of everything. \n\nSteamed Fish; Can't remember, maybe it was a sea bass or rock cod but steam fish is always on my menu. Mmmmm oh so saucy, tender fish steamed with soy sauce that makes you keep wanting more :)\n\nFried pork chops & chicken wings; My kids love chicken wings and I love how their lightly battered and fried with jalepenos :)\n\nMeat Sauce Spaghetti; Mmmm I usually tend to choose spaghetti over rice bc well I'm a noodle girl. Saucy, meaty and oh so tasty and served with garlic bread.\n\nOx Tail; Yep I love meat too just as much as noodles. Their ox tail has become my obsession. Cooked with red wine, sweet and falling off the bone and with a side of their spaghetti it's a winner in my book.\n\nLastly I'm definitely a groupie for their Hong Kong Style Milktea (cold please). A great way to wash all the good food down; sweet tea and milky. *Ok now I'm craving one!!! :)", "author": "Anonymous P."}

Judging from both exterior and interior of the place, it is relatively clean for a chinese speaking restaurant if you know what I mean. Upon entering the restaurant, my friend and I were seated immediately with menus in front of us. While the selection of dishes are quite numerous, both of us settled down with the western style dishes (to be exact, curry beef stew and curry chicken) which came with garlic bread, soup, and your choice of spaghetti or rice.\n\nThe downhill part starts. My friend noticed my side of the table did not have a fork and a napkin. Trying to get a waitress' attention is impossible either because they were either too busy or simply they did not want to acknowledge. Once we got a waitress' attention bringing my lack of eating utensil issue up, the waitress responded with the rude \"I know, I KNOW!\" and proceeds to continue with whatever she was working on. After a while, I did get my fork and my napkin.\n\nFood came out in huge plates for both my friend and I. While she got her curry beef stew in a stew dish, mine was in a form of a chicken steak with curry sauce over it. I do not recall my dish saying it would come in this form since it only said \"curry chicken\". Anyway, we went on eating but the food was just so-so. Bland and greasy curry sauce over chicken steak, super sweet red sauce (I think they might have just heat up ketchup with bits of meat) on my spaghetti with 3 bite size pieces of vegetable---I suppose it is alright if you need something to fill your stomach up. Otherwise, I would recommend something else to order.\n\nThe \"bright\" side of this whole thing:\nThe only thing trying to get the waitress' attention quicker than anything else above was her handing the total bill to us, taking it from us once we plunk down a $20, and giving us our change back.", "author": "Kim L."}

The waitress asked if I wanted condensed milk with it and I said yes, not knowing that they charge .35 extra. Not a big deal but it just adds to the horrible experience. Our milk teas came, then my bf's club sandwich came. My porridge NEVER came! I just thought it was taking longer because it's harder to prepare than a sandwich. But nope, they just forgot. When I finally realized they forgot, I was already kind of full from picking off of my bf's plate so I didn't care about the porridge.\n\nI was ready to ask for the check when the waitress finally realized she forgot my order. She and the chef were scrambling around trying to see if there was a extra bowl of porridge lying around until I said \"check please\". The waitress then said \"oh you don't want it anymore?\" I said no and she apologized...to the chef! Not to me! I was pissed! \n\nI can understand that I shouldn't be expecting good service at a place like this, but I did expect an apology at least.

It still have the sort of burned piece you would find at the bottom of rice cookers - and it is not good, restaurant quality rice either. The sauce is tasteless. The seafood and the vegetable? The fish is soft and mushy with no taste. The vegetable are pretty much raw - this is not a Western restaurant, and this is not a salad.

Others have mentioned that the service is really fast-- and that is true. It's so fast that the waitress came back to us 3 times to ask if my friend and I were ready to order.\n\nWe ordered the 3 course meal for $21.99 and selected scrambled egg and beef, fried flounder, and kung pao chicken. The scrambled egg and beef were really just scrambled egg and beef-- not minced beef and egg-- which is what I was hoping for but I can't blame them for having the correct translation (which is also surprising for a Chinese restaurant :P). The fried flounder was my favorite part of the meal. It was perfectly fried and flavored. The kung pao chicken could have been a bit spicier but I still liked it because it was flavorful (with baby corn, mushrooms, and peanuts). Unfortunately, they didn't offer rice with the 3 course meal-- but getting separate bowls of rice is pretty cheap anyway.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was definitely HK cafe style, which I liked. (I was trying to eat Chinese food after all). They serve free tea and have Chinese music playing faintly in the background. I would definitely come back-- and I probably will soon when I'm craving some Cantonese home-cooking (which I can't make even if I tried).", "author": "Julie H."}

We ordered a Thai Chicken with Rice and a fried rice.  The fried rice came out really quickly - within 5 minutes actually. Made me wonder when they made the rice...or maybe the chef was super ready to cook that. Too bad, as the Thai Chicken took about half an hour to come out. And the server didn't mention it to us. Nor is it written that it takes THAT long to make the Thai Chicken.\n\nWhat is a Thai Chicken with Rice? I didn't know either...until I ordered it. Turns out its a breaded curry chicken with Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. I liked the crispiness of it, but overall it wasn't worth the wait. Or, perhaps, its cause I filled up on the fried rice and wasn't feeling hungry any more.\n\nSo as we waited, several more people came into the restaurant.  I saw two tables get their entire order while I waited for this chicken. Again, probably why I was expecting this dish to be off the hook...and it wasn't.\n\nPrice-wise, its not too bad. But still a couple dollars too expensive for the quality of food and service you get.  I did the math on the 3 entrees and soup deal. Unless you're dining as 2 people (because rice is $1 per person), its not really worth it. As 2 people, it'll be about $7 per person.

Really slow service, but the best part about 2546 is the pan fried noodles(worth the long wait) and the location of this place.", "author": "Raymond S."}

To my surprise, to go food doesn't come with the garlic bread or the soup, which you would get while dining in.  Thats fine.  So I ordered the Korean style ribs, Rockcod and Pork Chops.  The ribs weren't bad, but the other two were absolutely inedible.  The rockcod had about a pound of salt in it and the pork chop was like chewing on leather.  Definitely some meat that has been in the freezer for quite some time and borderline, rotten.  Needless to say, we're never going back to this place again.", "author": "Milton W."}

The little one had the spaghetti in meat sauce, which he really liked and the adults had the 3 dishes for $16.99 (I think it was $16.99) and we all thought the food was not bad.  We had the curry beef stew, tomato with beef, and king pao chicken.  The one thing that did not taste good was our drinks.  We ordered the lemon ice tea and all around thought that it was tasteless. \n\nService was okay.  One thing we did not like was that they had to keep their front door open for circulation...on a cold evening, that is not so cool.  I was impressed to find that the restaurant was actually pretty clean.", "author": "Stella C."}

The surrounding neighborhood at Candlestick is pretty pathetic in terms of food.  I started coming here since I noticed that other Chinese joints on San Bruno lack quality.  It is a somewhat blighted neighborhood with change coming slowly if at all.  2546 had a somewhere more modern appearance but it's nowhere near \"nice\" or \"trendy.\"  I enjoyed the 3 item dinner special where for around $18 you get 3 dishes, soup, and rice.  The dishes themselves were a little greasy but not bad for the price.\n\nWhy I got pissed:  Coming home from work I stopped by to get some greasy Chinese comfort food and ordered braised rock cod with vegetables over rice to go.  I waited for the food, took it home, and opened the box to see deep fried rock cod with no sauce and no rice.  It was 100% fried fish, like something you see at Long John Silver's or something.  And NO RICE.  Bastards.  I didn't feel like driving back after the long day I had so I ate the fried fish.\n\nThe next week:  I ordered the same thing and pointed to the menu to make sure they knew I wanted the braised rock cod.  Maybe I should have looked in the box before I left, but again I was tired from work.  THEY FUCKED IT UP AGAIN.  Bastards..\n\nSo I had a hate hate relationship with this restaurant for awhile.  But overall it's not bad for the neighborhood and I like how it's close to my pad and I don't have to go all the way to the Richmond with it's terrible parking or to the Sunset with the fog and endless local traffic lights.  \n\nTry it out if you're in the hood, but don't go out of the way for it.

We weren't exactly greeted with warm smiles.  Their tables can't really seat more than 4 people so our party had to sit at 2 different tables.  Our waitress tossed our menus on the table and walked away (MINUS 1 STAR.)  It took quite awhile to flag down a waitress.  I ordered the tomato and beef pan fried noodles and my coworker had the satay beef with rice.  Once the food arrived,  I was shocked by the presentation.  It was literally pan fried noodles with a few pieces of beef and giant chunks of barely cooked tomato.  Some of the pieces of tomato had dirt on the peels... The only upside was the price.  $5 for a huge plate of noodles.  My coworker's Satay Beef with Rice wasn't terrible.  If i ever do go back, that's most likely what I'd order since the tea looked sketchy too =P\n\nBottom line,  poor service and unimpressive food for a cheap price....\n\nThe sign lied to me =(", "author": "E C."}

We love this place cuz the food is good and the price is good also. \n\nThese people complain about the food not being that good and comparing it to elsewhere like chinatown. This place isn't the best but at the same time you can't ask for much more in a area like this. \n\nAnd for the people that complain about service... You get what you pay for. If you want good service go to a expensive fine dining restaurant.\n\nYou have to try this place out for yourself, I definitely recommend this place.

For breakfast, they have like 3 choices of the daily special for you to choose from, which is macaroni, ham and eggs, and porridge or rice noodles.  I'm not fond of breakfast item so I usually order chow fun kind of food instead.  But when I ask for that, they said they are strictly doing breakfast only.  I know it's breakfast hour but don't people know how to think outside the box?\nFor dinner, I've tried the baked pork chop rice and the salt pepper spareribs.  The baked pork chop rice doesn't taste or look like it's been in the oven.  What I received was a piece of pork chop next to some steam rice.  The salt and pepper spareribs was suppose to be deep fried until crispy, instead I got some pan fried pork chop soak in oil sprinkle with salt and pepper.  The bottom line is the food here sucks and it is nothing close to what you can get elsewhere.  The chef here just can't cook!", "author": "Heidi F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-06-27", "description": "I came here 3 times. Meaning I gave them 2 chances to redeem themselves, but my rating just explains most of it in general. \n\nThe price for the happy hour is NOT the cheapest, but far the highest price I have encountered.  Over 4 USD for happy hour food is not really cheap for happy hour.  Besides the price, the food is below average to poor.  The noodle I ordered, was horrid. Maybe others like baby food feel for the noodles, but I dont. The noodle was not like noodle, their all broken to pieces, like the left over noodles on the bottom of the basket.  For a note, I did not go there during closing hour, I went there during 4pm.  As for chicken wings w/ french fries, its not as it is named. It turned to 2x Chicken wings w/ 1x hash brown.The Chicken was actually fried well, but it is bland.  Seems like they just took it out of the package and threw it into the fryer.  No taste, only the taste of the oil they fried it with.  \nOverall, 1 star. unless you like their milk tea, which is 'ok.'  But not enough to bump my score up higher than 1.  You gotta try to believe. You might like it, but not me.", "author": "Albert W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-14", "description": "I would normally give 2 stars to this restaurant, until I tried their breakfast menu.  Their chicken mushroom porridge is so good.  The porridge is not watery at all or too chunky.  The chicken and mushroom was soft and flavorful.  It also comes with a small order of chow fun.  Their breakfast comes with a drink as well.  All for only $3.05 or so.  What a deal.  As to dinner, it's not impressive.  The dinner menu is decent and worth going if you're in the neighborhood.  I would however not try any of the ramen stuff.  They have the chinese ramen where they would try to make it like chow mein, but I don't know what kind of ramen they use b/c it sucks.  As to the Japanese ramen in the soup noodle, that is really bland and the ramen is not even good.  The soup base sucks too.  Stick with the rice  stuff or baked spaghetti stuff.  Stick to basics.. and don't be too adventurous with the dinner stuff.  HOwever, I would have to say that their Ox-tail was surprisingly good.  It's like home-cooked, so it's not bad.  Their curry is so-so.  Their pork cutlet is not bad.", "author": "AhLin C."}

My first experience there when it first opened was with my family.  We basically ordered food and they totally forgot about us.  We stayed there for 2 hours literally waiting...waiting.... FOREVER for our food.  The table behind us came like an hour after us and they were practically done eating.  We reminded them multiple times and they'd nod their head at us; supposedly reassuring us that our food would come soon.. did it come? NEVAH!  Then I started throwing some kinda fit, and they started rushing it out.  My mom says it's not the waiter's fault but more so the kitchen.. i GUESS... But that was way before. It's been opened for awhile now.  It's not super tasty but I don't mind ordering take out from there once in a while.  There's a deal where you can order 3 entrees + rice + soup(enough for a whole family dinner) for around all but $17.00?  Today my mom bought me the chicken string beans meal with rice.  Usually I love this entree but today it tastes a bit dry.  Perhaps they cooked it differently?  Something just tastes different.. If its gonna stay tasting like this,  I'll have to rethink this.", "author": "Leslie Y."}

I think everyone can agree that it's the best place to eat at on San Bruno Ave. Go for their breakfast menu - it's cheap and it's worth it.
