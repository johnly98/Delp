When we originally made the reservation they were still doing the 4 course tasting menu for $90, but they just recently changed the menu to be 7 courses for $135. We figured we'd splurge given we were celebrating and it does have a Michelin star. We were not disappointed! The restaurant is small and it has a subdued mellow feel to it, and they have an open kitchen which is awesome to see. The service was also excellent- they definitely do a good job of making your meal an experience. \n\nFor food, we started with an amuse bouche of strawberries with a miso sauce. It was a perfect bite which set the tone for the meal. Each of the 7 following courses was delicious and had a nice smoky flavor tying them all together. Some of our favorites were the roja beans with whipped potatoes and egg yolk, the trout dish, and the frozen peach dessert. The house made sourdough bread with house made butter that comes with the bean dish really takes things to another level! Another nice touch was a couple of extras they threw into the meal- we got a rice milk sorbet as a palate cleanser before desert as well as a caramel and a truffle after dessert. We finished the meal with full stomachs and were impressed by the quality of all of the food. \n\nOnly reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price point. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is lovely, and I'd definitely recommend coming here for a special occasion. There are other places with equally awesome food that are just a little better value for the price. Overall, I loved my meal here and would come back for the right occasion!", "author": "Rachel D."}

My boyfriend and I walked in, unaware that they had a pre-fixe menu ($75 per person) and how lovely this place was going to be. We sat at the communal table, but were treated just as nice as the other patrons. The courses came on such a timely manner, and not once did we feel rushed or had to wait for a long time. The service was so professional and polite. \n\nFor each course, we had 2-3 options, which was nice, since we wanted to order different things and try more of the dishes. My boyfriend's favorite was the cold summer squash soup (which I ordered!)-- he said that the flavors mixed so well together, which he didn't expect from reading the description on the menu. As for me, my favorite was the lemongrass custard (the dessert)-- omg, it was SO refreshing and it had grapefruit shaved ice and flower petals on top! It was soooo delicious. I couldn't stop thinking about it all night. I also really enjoyed the soft-boiled egg. I thought it had such fun textures going on (the crunch from the rice puffs, the gooeyness from the egg). The only con about eating that dish was getting seaweed strips stuck in my teeth! Haha. \n\nAs for the wine... what a lovely selection. We really enjoyed the glasses we ordered (sorry, we forgot which!). Overall, we both highly recommend this place for an exceptional experience.", "author": "Christina W."}

So it was a bit awkward start for our date (and their date :)).\n\nThey accommodated our dietary restrictions beautifully (I'm vegetarian, he lactose-intolerant), and our servers were very professional and informative about every dish that was brought to us (4 courses $75/pp). \n\nI mist admit it was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time.

It's cheap because other 1-Michelin star restaurants are charging over $100, but this place is charging $75 for 4 courses. But the food isn't that spectacular though, and the wait between courses is incredibly long, making the experience not that great. \n\nFirst course, I got the Dry Aged Beef (beef tartare). That was really good! Second dish, I got the soft boiled egg, which was probably the best dish out of my four courses. The portion was pretty small though. For my entree (third course), I got the trout, which looked a lot like salmon. This was really nothing special at all. You can get this at pretty much any restaurant. It didn't taste bad, but I was pretty disappointed at how unremarkable it was. Dessert (fourth course) was the caramel/chocolate. This was a big portion, probably too big and too sweet, considering how small the other dishes were, and felt sort of overwhelming. \n\nThe server told us about the specials: caviar and truffles, but didn't tell us the price, which wasn't very nice. \n\nThe wait was too long. An hour after we were seated, we only got one course! Unacceptable. Service is way too slow for a Michelin starred restaurant. There were no \"snacks\" or complimentary treats between the courses. We also had to sit at a communal table, where you can hear every word of your neighbors' conversation. Not a very pleasant dining experience. The upside is, the wait staff were all very pleasant and friendly. Water was very very promptly refilled. \n\nHowever, for the price, the long wait between courses, and too crowded dining atmosphere, I would not recommend this place. I can you can pay a tad more to eat much better food at similar-caliber restaurants.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

The trout skin chip is a really nice touch too. \nDessert - Smoked Caramel with bitter chocolate, sour orange and vanilla\n\nI also ordered the sourdough bread with house cultured butter (in my opinion, they should just increase the prix fixe price and include this in the meal.

We stopped by Aster based on this alone, but it was a pleasant surprise this also had one Michelin star. \n\nWe arrived when they opened and the host was very good. The server seemed off for a restaurant of this caliber, maybe because she was starting the night. We had to ask a lot of questions and she seemed a little rushed, though no one had arrived yet besides us and a table of three. The menu is a tasting menu where each person picks a dish for four courses. I chose the delicata squash, mushrooms, trout and pink lady apple. All of the dishes were excellent, the trout was my favorite. We also added on a cheese course with our dessert that was exquisite. I recommend the beverage pairing which had some really great selections, including a number of sparkling wines. In fact, my beau got three sparkling wines with his four courses, a very unique selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable. The service was quite good.

It's 4 courses but you get to choose from 4 different categories so you do get some options (pro-tip - definitely opt for the house made sourdough as the bread is really fresh and the butter so salty and creamy).  The menu changes I believe but some quick notes on what I had (3/23/18):\n\n- Dry Aged Beef 3.5/5 - Essentially a beef tartare with a brown rice crisp.  Good but nothing special and could have used a tad more seasoning.\n\n- Soft Cooked Egg 3/5 - This dish sounded great in description but it was very salty and a bit one note.\n\n- Duck 5/5 - This is where the meal really picked up as both entrees I tried were great.  The duck was cooked perfectly and paired with delicious greens.  To top things off there were also a pair of duck confit fritters!\n\n- Trout 4.5/5 - I personally love trout and this was a great version.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the skin crisped expertly.  \n\nDesserts 4.5/5 - I forget the specifics but one dessert was a sort of brittle atop a buttermilk sorbet and the other was a tart fruit sorbet with lots of goodies mixed in (sliced kumquat for sure but I forget the others) \n\nIn a sea of New American restaurants in SF I'd recommend this as definitely worth a try!", "author": "Aaron K."}

Aster offers a four course tasting ($75/pp) menu with the option of wine pairing ($48/pp) or reserved wine pairing ($98/pp). We opted for the tasting w/ wine pairing.\n\nOrdered between the two of us:\nx SOURDOUGH, house cultured butter ($5) - Must order. The bread is sOOOO good and the butter is divine. 5/5\nx GRILLED GEMS buttermilk ranch, milk bread, fennel, bottarga - Nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad at all.

Love all the textures and flavors in this dish. 5/5\nx CHILLED SUNCHOKE SOUP pohas, kohlrabi, walnut, berbere - Flavors were good, but it was TOO chilled in my opinion. The sake pairing with this put me off as well. Didn't think it went well together :( 2/5\nx SOFT-COOKED EGG nori, puffed rice, bacon, smoked trout roe - Favorite of the night. Super yummy and fun textures in the mouth. Beautiful presentation. Must order! 5/5\nx TROUT black garlic mole chard, black trumpet, oro blanco - The boyfie really like this one, but I didn't find anything very special about it. Pretty, though :) 3.5/5\nx DUCK tatsoi rabe green garlic, vadouvan - I usually hate duck, but this one was SOOO good. I actually ended up eating 90% of it :) The wine pairing with this was fab as well. 5/5\nx LEMONGRASS CUSTARD blood orange, mandarin, cocoa nib - SOOO good and refreshing. Just what we needed after the meal. This is a very light dessert. Highly recommend if you aren't huge on desserts. 5/5\nx SUNFLOWER PAIN D'\u00c9PICES pumpkin, ginger, buttermilk - I call this, deconstructed pumpkin pie! Not my favorite, but I'm also not huge on desserts. 3.5/5\n\nThe wine pairing was just OK in my opinion. They always are. I really did enjoy my meal here, though.

I would also gander that Aster provides one of the most affordable Michelin star tasting menus in the city at $75 per person.\n\nWhen you first see the menu, one of the things that pops up is \"whattttt $5 for bread??\" But like other reviews affirm, it's totally worth it.  The sourdough was warm and fluffy- definitely might be the best sourdough I've ever had.\n\nThe appetizers at Aster were the star of the show, while we found the entrees good, but uninspired. So that we could maximize our tasting potential, my husband and I ordered different things and split every course.\n\nCourse 1: dry aged beef tartare with rice puffs and a market salad.  Both were freaking amazing. The tartare was in tiny cubes topped with aioli and it just melted in your mouth. The rice puffs provided a nice crunchy contrast. When I first saw the market salad, my first thoughts were meh, salad, how boring. This salad, however, was super unique and unlike any other salad I've had. The fruits provided a sweet crispness, but there was also a strong umami flavor and sesame seeds. Who knew salads could be so fancy???\n\nCourse 2: slow cooked egg and rye spaetzle - you really can't go wrong with a slow cooked egg, honestly.  As expected it was deliciously creamy and well balanced with the things it was served with.  The spaetzle was the pleasant surprise.  My only encounters with spaetzle has been with a typically German preparation. The spaetzle was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside- it really gives a whole new meaning to spaetzle for me. Highly recommend \n\nCourse 3: lamb 3 ways and the trout - this is where our dinner became a little more normal. The lamb 3 ways was definitely the winner. The lamb was juicy and moist, but not a revelation like our other courses. The trout, unfortunately, is the reason for the drop in the star. The flavors were nice and rich, but unevenly distributed over the trout, and it was slightly over cooked.  Nothing makes me sadder than overcooked fish :(\n\nCourse 4: an amuse-bouche if you will... since it was our anniversary, they brought us out a rice gelato with umeboshi. It's a really interesting combination of super salty and sour with the umeboshi balanced with the sweetness of the gelato. I'm not sure I crave it, but it sure did take my taste buds on an interesting trip.\n\nCourse 5: dessert!!!! Strawberry 3 ways and chocolate custard - the strawberry was super light and refreshing, with lots of floral hints. On the other end, the chocolate custard was creamy and rich. And they were topped with coconut mochis which I love! The desserts were a win for us!", "author": "Jenny C."}

They should have told me that they went from $69/pp fixed menu (which was first increased to $85) to $135 in one shot.  This isn't a price adjustment for inflation, you need to warn us.  I am also not a fan of 7 course menu, Aster was a great casual affordable option, now the dinner had to drag artificially for two hours \n\nMoreso, I am convinced the food was actually worse than before:  I used to love the bowl which had salmon roe and crunchy stuff and it was replaced with an egg and some average sauce\n\nFinally, even attitude wise, they didn't accept my cancelation...which they used to many times in the past.  This time they explained that they ordered the ingredients 48 hours in advance. As if they had to put an attitude of a $200/pp restaurant.\nThey told me I had to show up at a given time before losing the table, yet when I arrived there were many open seats.  \n\nIn conclusion, it's become extremely expensive for the same food at best and with an attitude.  \nAdios, my last time here after 2-3 years we preaching it was my favorite.\n\nNote; they canceled the brunches and even on a Saturday night they were not full.

I don't care about the conversations of my neighbors, and I wish the place were quieter and more intimate.\n\nNow, the real topic: the food. We had the fixed 4 course dinner with wine pairing. It was overall a flatliner, with a single spark and a complete downer. I had the aged beef for starter, and it was just fine. Nothing special about it. My dining partner had the carrots, and I have never seen a sadder plate: a few carrots with hints of condiments that you'd hope would enhance the experience. Alas it didn't. My dish was paired with a prosecco, which I found rather odd.\n\nWe then moved to the second course. We both picked the egg, and that was the highlight of the evening. Not only was the dish delicious, it was interestingly paired with a sake, and that was a good experience. I wish the overall dinner had the same level of taste and sophistication.\n\nI then moved to the third course, the pork. It was good, nicely paired with a dry red wine from Italy. My dinner partner however, picked the trout. Not her lucky day, as it was another meh. It looked like salmon with lipstick, and tasted like it. Her white wine from Portugal was better than her dish.\n\nAnd then we both finished with the same dessert, the so-called bitter chocolate. How do you spell bitter in this place? It was so sweet that we didn't finish it. It was cheap, childish, and a complete downer. What a punishment on the taste buds!\n\nTime to exit, the bill is $400. This is a joke.

The service was excellent as they were always checking in and asking for feedback.\n\nI found that the restaurant was pleasing to be in. I was seated at the large long table with my fiancee. I would have preferred a booth or side table but it was still fun to be around others and enjoy almost a communal styled evening. \n\nAster, as of right now has a 7 course tasting menu. I was pretty disappointed not by the menu but how they performed the transition from a Prix fix to a tasting menu. I was notificed just 1 week in advance about this switch from a 95$ four course Prix fix to a 135$ Prix fix. This put me in a spot where I had to swallow the extra 80$ I will be spending on this meal as getting a reservation elsewhere was practically impossible. I would have preferred a better handling of this transition as I chose aster over other Michelin star restaurants due to the simplicity of choice and the price being slightly less than other places. Possibly a reduced price tasting menu for those who booked before the switch. We did receive dishes we didn't expect but I was still miffed about the whole switch.\n\nWarning: if you do not like certain elements of a dish whether it be lamb, raw fish or have issues with a certain food you may need to consult the restaurant. One of the courses did include a lamb chop that I know is not exactly favored amongst some people. Consult the menu before coming. Luckily, my fiancee and I are not picky and enjoyed all of the dishes provided.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable night with my new fiancee.

Food, service or otherwise. \n\nLet's start with the service. It was a bit strange. I couldn't tell if our server was either bored or didn't care. To be a Michelin star rated restaurant, I was expecting a whole lot more energy and/or knowledge than our server was providing. Also, it was unclear if the person standing behind her was training or just helping. She never introduced him and it made for a very awkward experience. Other than collecting our food/cleaning the table, we were never asked how the dishes were. \n\nAs for the food, it was very different. I'm not going to say I fully understood the menu. TBH, my meat-eating friend said his four course menu was superb. But from more pescetarian POV, the seafood and vegetarian dishes were mediocre at best. The server advised that a SB uni could be added onto any dish. I LOVE me some uni and was expecting a dish married and interwoven w flavors when it arrived. Sadly, they laid ONE piece of uni atop my squid app for an additional 8 bucks (really 10+ after tax and tip). Was that worth the add? Uh, no. The remainder of my dishes were okkkk. Let's just skip to the dessert portion. I honestly cannot even describe to you what it was except that it wasn't good. It looked like tofu slices with cheese on the side. I mean, it was goats milk with what was supposedly a cake mixed w coco nibs. Was it? No. Omg I couldn't even eat a quarter of it. \n\nWhen the server finally came around to collect the dishes, she didn't even ask why I didn't finish or if it was okay. She just said finished? Before I could say more than a half yes, she already grabbed the plate to go. My friend and I were treating another friend for his bday...total btw two ppl came out to 190+ each. Was it worth it? Not even close. Pretty disappointed by the entire experience. Esp bc the bday boy said this was one of his fav restaurants in the city...even he said the menu was a let down tonight. \n\nThough I will end it w them acknowledging my OpenTable note about it being my friends bday.

I understand why they do charge because it would be nonstop request for free bread. I highly recommend ordering the bread. \n\nIt's was one of my birthday stops with my best friend. Dinner experience was very good. Not every dish was amazing but every course had at least one delicious dishes that made this a good experience. \n\nBetween MCFARLAND SPRING TROUT and DRY AGED BEEF, the winner was the beef. The flavors were all there, very tasty. Love the brown rice crisp for the added texture. \n\nMy best friend and I have a different favorite between POTATO DUMPLINGS, SOFT-COOKED EGG  and the OCTOPUS. Second course was definitely our favorite. The egg was cook to perfection, paired great with nori, puffed rice, bacon, smoked trout roe. I really like the dumplings because it was not too heavy and not too chewy. It was delicious.  \n\nThe DUCK beat out the HALIBUT. Halibut is on the lighter side. I feel like it needs more flavor. But the duck was great, especially the sweet kumquat. My taste buds love this dish.  \n\nCHOCOLATE CUSTARD vs STRAWBERRY. We love the strawberry because it was the perfect ending to our dinner. Very light, refreshing and not too sweet. I think the lemon and sesame was the perfect touch to this dessert. \n\nService was great and love the open kitchen.

The day before our reservation, the restaurant called to confirm and also informed us that they now only offer the 4 course tasting menu (as opposed to having a la carte) and the price is now $75. Womp. \n\nThe restaurant itself isn't that big, with a few two tops, booths and a large communal table in the middle. We were seated at a booth near the kitchen. \n\nWe started with the sourdough bread and butter ($5). The bread was soft and tasty, but I didn't find it to be mind blowing. But if you're starving it's a good thing to get your appetite ready. \n\nWe ordered the following : \n\nDry aged beef: I don't eat beef so this was all on the BF. He didn't like it at all. He said there was a strong lemony taste that overpowered the beef. The cracker was good! \n\nMarket Greens: since I don't eat beef, I was disappointed that one of my courses would be a salad. I enjoy salads, but don't necessarily think they're worth ordering at an upscale restaurant. BUT THIS SALAD WAS GOOOOOOD. Tons of flavors and depth. BF is anti-salad and he agreed that this was tasty! \n\nSquid: tender, cooked perfectly. Just wish there was more!! \n\nRye and morel spaetzle: we loveee spaetzle. My family lives in Germany so we're no stranger to the dish, but this was a pleasant twist!! The morels make it meaty and savory. This dish is a must get!! \n\n\nTrout: the trout was cooked medium rare, which is fine for us. Skin was crispy! And the miso dashi was delicious. Overall, a light dish but still was flavorful. \n\n\nDuck: NOMMMM. Another standout dish. BF usually isn't a fan of duck breast, but really enjoyed this one. Skin was crispy and the meat was tender, not chewy. Then you get a bit of the duck confit on the side which was DELICIOUSSSS. \n\nCocoa nib financier: interesting dish. More savory due to the goat cheese foam, so order this if you're not a fan of sweets. \n\nChocolate custard: this dish isn't the prettiest lol, just a lot of brown and not a fan of the shape. But the taste was amazing!!! The perfect sweet ending to our dinner! \n\nWe received an anniversary dessert which was light and refreshing. \n\nService was friendly and spot on. Water was constantly refilled and tables were cleared and reset after each course.", "author": "Noelle H."}

I watched him check in and sit in the booth across from me and basically reverted to my 18 year old self. Was basically swooning over him from afar all night like a crazy person. My date was not amused. \n\nCame here on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. The restaurant was never full and there was only one couple on the communal table the entire night. Refused to give us a booth but Kevin Rose got one ahem ahem. Some people just live in the light. \n\nI don't know why there are so many negative reviews regarding the service because everyone was super friendly and nice. I am a huge stickler for service too and I had zero issues. \n\nThe 4 course menu was $75 and my date got the wine pairing and I just ate edibles because I couldn't drink and then I got way too high and was paranoid I looked super high but apparently I looked fine. The wine pairing is a way better deal than any of the wines they have on their menu too. We also got the sour dough bread but only because everyone on here was raving about it and I actually do not think I would order it again, especially because I was crazy full by the end of the meal. They also had a special uni addition that my date added to one of his appetizers. \n\nWe got the same entree and I freaking hate doing that and GUESS WHAT both our entrees were so freaking salty. It was a weird salty/sour thing though so not sure if it was supposed to be like that but otherwise it was tasty. The appetizers were all good and my dessert was horrendous I cannot believe they even served such a thing. Abort abort. It was so dry and not tasty and I had to hijack my dates dessert because it was way prettier and yummier. We also got an additional dessert with candle and errythang because it was his birthday, sweet! \n\nDefinitely the most reasonably priced Michelin restaurant I have ever been to and they literally just increased their prices too so probably better to get on it now before they increase it again.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-06", "description": "Interior - Laid back and casual for a Michelin restaurant. \n\nFour Course Menu - $75/person with 3 choices in each section. So many options and so much to share between you and your date. \n\nDietary Restrictions - Despite making reservations and informing them ahead of time of being pescatarian/vegan, the service refused to accommodate. My waitress didn't even tell the kitchen to make alterations in the menu despite promising me that she would. Bummer. \n\nSourdough - Extra $5. Bread was moist and fresh. Never had this texture before. Not sure if it was worth $5. Save your stomach for the meal. Asked for the rest to go. They didn't pack the butter that came with the dish. \n\nDelicata Squash - Refreshing, sweet, light. Probably my favorite dish. \n\nDry Aged Beef - Beef tartare eaten with light crispy chips. Good, cold, and savory. \n\nSoft-Cooked Egg - Stir the egg in rice, bacon, and smoked trout roe. Comforting, nostalgic, and light. \n\nChanterelle - The dressing is on the bottom. The top looked like a vine forest. Artistic and savory. \n\nTrout - Cooked very well. Overwhelmed by how much sauce was on the fish. It doesn't need any sauce at all. \n\nHen - Also too much sauce. Took away from the savory flavors and textures. \n\nFrozen Yogurt - Nice, sweet, comforting finish. \n\nChocolate - Was told twice to change my menu options so I pick a dessert without dairy. It still came out with dairy. Looked like poop but it was good. \n\nPacing - Good. Our meal started around 9:45pm and we were out by 11:30pm. \n\nOverall, despite my preferences, the food was objectively Michelin-worthy. I wished they accommodated my dietary preferences.

I didn't realize that this place has a Michelin star! So knowing that coming in for dinner, I had my expectations set high.\n\nThis restaurant is very cute, modern and intimate. As we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and seated promptly. We ordered the the sourdough and house special butter first. Who would have thought that such a simple bread and butter will be such a nice way to start the rest of our meals. The butter was smokey and had an umami flavor that set it apart from other bread and butter starters I've had from other places.\n\nWe all opted to get the four course tasting menu and we made sure to order different plates for each course to maximize on the opportunity to try as much as we can. \n\nFirst Course - DRY AGED BEEF\n\nOh my! This dish was just spectacular! From the dry aged beef, brown rice crisp to the uni - everything was in harmony. The pickled plum gave the dish a nice touch of brightness. The uni was a very good addition, creamy and salty to round out all the flavors.\n\nSecond Course - SOFT-COOKED EGG\n\nMuch like the first course, this one was an awesome dish as well. The addition of puffed rice with the soft cooked egg was just enough to make sure textures are balanced. Even with the bacon and salmon roe combination, the dish was not overly salty but instead worked in tandem.\n\nThird Course - PORK\n\nThat pork dish was just delish! It wasn't dry and the pork flavor really stands out. It was paired with brussel sprouts and sweet grapes. The addition of grapes was unexpected but was a good one. \n\nFourth Course - FROZEN CHOCOLATE\n\nTo my fellow chocolate lovers, this is the dessert to get for sure!! It's their version of a frozen chocolate. The block of chocolate in the center was bittersweet which was paired perfectly with the huckleberry compote. For crunchy element, the meringue and cacao nib crumble were an awesome touch. \n\nOur whole table really enjoyed all the dishes that night. Service was attentive. Our water glasses were always full, plates and silverware cleared out after each course. The tasting menu was reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food we got. I wouldn't mind coming back again here next time we're in the city. Definitely worth checking them out!", "author": "Patricia A."}

The flavors were impressive, the presentation was perfect and the colors looked so beautiful. Also, their tasting menu is  one of the most affordable multi course tasting menus ($65)\n\nThe boyfriend and I were in the bay for our culinary and wine tour post his PhD graduation. And Aster was one of our stars in our celebration! \n\nWe made a booking in advance and our table was ready when we arrived. The parking is tight so plan to arrive a little early.\n\nWe did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. We both got different dishes so we could try a lot more. The \"BEETROOT SALAD\" was just perfect. The beets had a sort of crunch but softness at the same, which made the texture interesting. We also got the \"HEIRLOOM CARROT, PISTACHIO, YOGURT, GOLDEN RAISIN\"- beautiful colors! the flavors played on your tongue, making it a well balanced, yum dish. \"POTATO DUMPLINGS, BLACK TRUMPET, CAULIFLOWER, PINE NUT, SAGE\" very well crafted dish. You could taste every element, feel different textures and the flavors were bang on. The black trumpet, the sage and the pine nuts elevated potatoes from ordinary to extraordinary. The perfect cooked cauliflower only added to the flavor. The \"TROUT, ARTICHOKE, SHELLING BEANS, ORO BLANCO, PRESERVED MEYER LEMON\" was one of the best cooked fishes I have ever had. Fresh too!\n\nThe desserts were decadent and devilishly delicious. designer and divine. They surprised us with Lemon Sorbet with Fig! They gave this as a congratulations complimentary dessert for the boyfriend. Minimalistic and tarty. Personally, I am not a big fan of tarty stuff, but the fig balanced the taste and it was perfect otherwise. We also had \"FROZEN CHOCOLATE, HUCKLEBERRY, BOURBON MERINGUE\" so rich and chocolate-y and well-balanced sweetness and indulgent!\n\nOur experience here was wonderful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-18", "description": "It's a fun place - definitely $$$ - but if you go in prepared to spend, then it's all good. \n\nReally nice presentation on all the dishes, and generally pretty flavorful and creative food. \n\nHow it works:\n\nThey have a tasting menu with four sections with four options. You can order anything Ala carte, or if your entire table chooses to do so, you can get a tasting menu - with one item from each four sections - for $65. Each person gets to choose the dish they want from each section, so if you have a group of four and want to try a lot of things, you actually could try everything for $65 per person. We didn't get all the things, because well, some didn't really appeal, but we got a lot of them (13 of the 16) and for the most part were pretty impressed.  \n\nThey also do wine parings for $42 a person. I was impressed by this because they actually pair a wine with every dish. And like I said, we got a lot of different dishes and each one came with a different wine, and they kept them straight and remembered which was which. Also, they were unique wines. A few from grapes I had never heard of! So that was fun to just try some new wines. It seemed like they had really put time and effort into their wine selection.\n\nBest dish of the night in my opinion was the duck. It was just really really perfectly cooked, and the sauce that came with it was light enough to not over power, but still flavorful. I also thought that the Halibut was extremely good. Not over cooked at all and the miso dashi complemented it very well. \n\nThe soft cooked egg was also very flavorful.  That whole dish came together very nicely and was very rich. \n\nThe asparagus, soft cooked egg, and potato dumplings all smelled amazing. \n\nThe homemade sourdough was solid (which is very important coming from a bread nerd) and the homemade butter was super good. \n\nReally all in all, the food was all around well done. \n\nThe only dish that we didn't really like was the Green Farro, it just sorta had an off taste. \n\nI was really happy they had a cheese option for the fourth course. I'm just not a sweet desert person and I'm usually sad when it comes to the last course - but not this time. \n\nService was prompt, but not too prompt.  We enjoyed our 7 - 9 dining experience, and didn't feel rushed or that we waited an exorbitant amount of time. Maybe a bit slow on the first course? But not really. They did the thing where they had multiple people deliver the food and clear plates so that it was a seamless process (that's fancy!). \n\nRelatively small space, so felt intimate. Would be a great place for a fancy date, although about 1/3 of their seating is at the community table, so don't go expecting it to be too intimate, because you might be sat at that table. Nice big windows by the street - we got one of those seats which I was excited about - because I love light - and it was on the darker side near the back (although they do have an open kitchen, so if you sat back there you could watch the chefs at work!).", "author": "Sarah C."}

We all did the 4 course menu, which costs $65 per person.  We were advised to not do the wine pairings, as we would not get as much wine as we wanted.  \n\nSince we were all sharing, I got to try every single dish on the menu.  Firstly, spring the $5 for the fresh sour dough bread.  I'm not a huge fan of sour dough but it's moist, fresh, and delicious --even the crust is good, and i don't even like crust.  \n\nMy favorite for the first course was the \"dry aged beef, pickled plum, kimchi furikake, and brown rice crisp.\"  This was delicious, and was our favorite for the group.  I would definitely recommend it, and it may have been my favorite dish.  \n\nFor the second course, I really liked the \"potato dumplings, black trumpet, cauliflower, pine nut, and sage\" option.  The potato dumplings were so delicious and the dish overall was just surprisingly good.  \n\nFor the third (main entree), I think the duck was the best.  \"Duck, celeriac, quince, maitake, and grains of paradise.\"  This was tender, cooked nicely, and the most flavorful option.  \n\nFor the last dish (dessert), I was shocked to find that I loved the savory option, \"contralto, chardonnay pate de fruit, rye, and poppy.\"  The cheese and fruit combined with the cracker -- we honestly all loved this.  \n\nOverall, the decor of the restaurant is very nice.  I love the lighting on the ceiling, and how mirrors really make the ceiling look larger -- and expands the space.  It is very intimate and romantic, I can see this being a nice anniversary spot.  The kitchen is open/exposed so you can see what is being done.  I loved the ceramic handmade dishes they use and the coasters that seemed to be made out of a felt like material.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and very friendly.  \n\nI would say the presentation of the food is phenomenal, service is great, decor is great, but I can't say I'd ever crave any of the dishes or think of them again.

Seeing that this was also a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, I was both excited and hopeful to finally dine here after a week of anticipation. I kept my hopes low in order to be truly blown away by their dishes. (Seriously need to do that or no restaurant will ever meet my high expectations. : ))\n\nAster is located on Guerrero Street in the Mission District of San Francisco. It's only a few blocks away from Mission Delores Park. It's mainly street parking and we were able to find a space pretty easy just a block away that night. Parking in the Mission is always hard, but you can get lucky if you park farther away from Valencia Street. \n\nThe restaurant space is small but quaint with an open kitchen towards the back end. It has a contemporary decor with a dimly-lit romantic ambience. There's small tables for 2 and 4 with a long communal table in the center of the dining room. (Guessing that's for walk-ins?) Our server was very helpful and friendly seeing that it was our first time dining there; asked us if we had any food allergies first. He walked us through the menu and made his recommendations. \n\nTheir menu consists of a four-course $65 prix-fix menu with $36 wine pairings. (Perfect if you go with 3 other friends if you want to taste every single thing on the menu.) In order to indulge, the whole table has to participate. There's also an option of ordering a l\u00e0 carte if customers don't have the appetite for 4 courses. (The amount per dish isn't teeny tiny either.) I must say that you cannot miss their desserts. Each one is delicious in their own way and a big amount too. \n\nDishes not to be missed -\n\nSoft Cooked Egg : So good! The coddled egg reminds me of the jelly-like yolk at Commis in Oakland. (Without the price at Commis.) The puffed rice adds a good crunch. You can totally taste the bacon vinaigrette too. \n\nPotato Dumplings : Soft and pillowy. Reminds me of Gnocchi but better. A very rich dish. \n\nTrout : MUST GET. Like now. Get it now. Crispy skin. Perfect texture. The best trout I've ever had! I would go back just for this. \n\nPoached Pear : This was delicious. A whole pear with vanilla ice cream on the inside and top with a crunchy pistachio cookie on top. \n\nFrozen Chocolate : Looked delicious as it looked. Smooth and rich. Bourbon Meringue added a light contrast to the rich chocolate.", "author": "Julie W."}

We were seated immediately in the cozy restaurant with an open kitchen and were briefed on the menu by our server Andrea. This is a review from our visit in August 2016 and comparing the menu from then to present, repeat diners that want variation will be pleased to know that the menu is fluid. The prices are also fluid as the tasting menu and wine pairing are both $6 more compared to 7 months ago. \n\nService from Andrea was Michelin star worthy with her being laid back but still maintaining the utmost professionalism. Her extensive knowledge of the menu and wine made our experience that much better by offering great recommendations and descriptions of the flavors, even giving details of the rationale for the wine pairing for each course. \n\nAfter we ordered the sourdough bread, we received 9 dishes that were presented beautifully with a wine pairing for each course for me. All were delicious and we were both happy with our choices. Luckily, I was recommended to have the duck instead of the pork which turned out to be my favorite. We actually ordered the milk chocolate custard, which was our favorite dessert, after we finished our courses because we couldn't get enough.\n\nThe total for the tab was $192 before tip which is a fair price considering the number of courses and the quality of the food and wine.

Was fairly easy to score an OpenTable reservation, and we had been meaning to explore this Michelin-starred menu for a while. We decided against doing the prix fixe, since we felt like it would be too much food. However, we did delve pretty deep into the starters, and had no regrets. \n\nThe place is pretty small, intimate, and had a fairly casual, yet elegant vibe. The open kitchen was not very far away from where we were seated near the window, and we could still see a lot of the different dishes being prepared. Everything we ended up ordering was very beautifully plated, which is what sort of attracted us in the first place, after seeing the Yelp pictures.\n\nSome of our favorites:\n- Dry-aged beef tartare: A good balance of textures and sweet/salty flavors.\n- Soft-cooked egg with puffed rice: The bacon vinaigrette that it came with was really well-executed, and the salmon roe added that bit of saltiness that really put it over the top\n- Potato dumplings: Really nice and dense, without actually being too heavy, and the sage was a great flavor contrast\n- Winter Mushrooms: A great mix of different mushrooms, and the slightly pickled cabbage really helped bring it all together\n- Duck: Probably my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly cooked, and went well with the mushrooms and grains of paradise.\n\nService overall was very attentive, although the the time between the 1st and the second course was a little long (over 20 minutes). We still ended up paying around $65 a person, but that included tax and tip, as well as a drink from the menu, not to mention we were all very full by the end of the night.\n\nDefinitely worth a try for dinner, and wouldn't hesitate to come back and try their brunch menu. Very glad that we had a solid experience, and would definitely recommend for a nice dinner for small groups and dates.", "author": "Eric J."}

We were happy to know that Aster won its fist Michelin star and decided to try its New American Courses. \nWe four people reserved a week ago. It was a small restaurant with warm lights and vintage decorations. The kitchen was in open style so you could actually see the chef preparing your food. \nWe order all 4 different sets of courses. That was one reason for friend's gathering because all of you could share and try all courses in Aster! \nA set is composed with 4 courses. Simple but delicate. In my opinion, I fell in love with the desert with some orange flower petals. It tasted fresh and sour-sweet reminding of the feeling of a cool summer day! The main course with salmon was delicious. Crispy skin and fish meat seasoned with sea salt made you imagine the wide ocean in your mind! \nIn general, the wonderful experience includes good service and aesthetic food. You had better try it!", "author": "Gigi G."}

It's one of the nicer settings we have eaten at, although there is still a sense of casual ambiance despite its Michelin star. They have a great corner location. \n\nWe opted for the four course menu. There are four options for each course so you still get the choice to customize your own meal. We started off with their sourdough bread which is something Aster is known for. The fuyu persimmon appetizer was a unique but delicious bite. The potato dumplings were warm and paired nicely with the crunchy black trumpet mushrooms. My main dish was the pork with miso potatoes, Brussels sprouts and grapes - everything juicy and flavorful. Then we were treated to a special sorbet dish compliments of the chef for our anniversary. That might have been my favorite part! My poached pear dessert was so good, something I wish I could mimic in my own kitchen! \n\nAster was yet another amazing Michelin experience. We were stuffed by the end, and it was half the price of most Michelin restaurants. Aster would be a great choice for an affordable first time Michelin experience!", "author": "Ashley C."}

It is my first Michelin restaurant in California, though it certainly won't be my last, and I was really excited to give it a try. \n\nI made a reservation via OpenTable and received a call from the hostess the day before confirming it. She also checked to make sure that there were no food allergies or religious preferences, and whether it was a special occasion. (It wasn't officially but for the record, eating is always a special occasion in my book!)\n\nAster has a clean, contemporary California feel. It's dimly lit but not romantic per se. It's more of a cool edginess. We absolutely loved the ambiance. While the mirrored panels at the ceiling made the restaurant seem like it goes on forever, it's smaller than I expected. It probably only seats 40(ish?) people, and about a third of that is made up of just one large elevated table that runs the length of the restaurant. The open kitchen runs the length of the far end wall. \n\nService was just OK, which disappointed me a bit. I wanted a little more assistance with the dishes as some of the ingredients were foreign (or just plain hidden). Two of the plates came directly from the kitchen and the server explained the best way to eat them, but for all the rest we were left to our own devices. (Is that even a complaint?)\n\nIt was both of our first visit to Aster so we both elected to do the four course menu and selected different items for each course so that we could try more of the menu. (Re: the tasting menu, it's $65 per person and the whole table must participate. The menu is split into four courses with four choices in each.) We had the following:\n\nCourse 1: \n- PINK LADY APPLES, yuzu preserve, brown butter-squash, yogurt, arugula ($16): just OK\n- DRY AGED BEEF, pickled plum, brown rice crispy, kimchi furikake ($18): really tasty. The ageing process enhanced the beef's natural flavors. \n\nCourse 2:\n- THUMBELINA CARROTS, sunchoke, coconut, black lime ($16): unbelievable! Sunchokes are trending hard right now and this was honestly my favorite dish of the night. \n- SOFT-COOKED EGG, nori, puffed rice, salmon roe, bacon vinaigrette ($15): a little more on the Japanese spectrum. The salmon roe added some of that bonita flake flavor you find in a good ramen shop, and the puffed rice changed the consistency of the entire dish (in a good way).\n\nCourse 3:\n- PORK, miso potatoes, brussels, grapes, verjus ($28): perfectly cooked and beautifully plated. I would eat this EVERY DAMN DAY.\n- DUCK, celeriac, quince, maitake, grains of paradise ($29): again, perfectly cooked. I didn't think the plating of this dish was particularly great but I had one bite and none of that mattered. Really excellent. \n\nCourse 4:\n- POACHED PEAR, pistachio, vanilla ($12): YUM. This dessert was delicate and oh-so-tasty! \n- COCONUT COFFEE TART, futsu squash, lime ($12): I liked the tart but the crust was a bit tough. I almost flipped the whole tart off the plate trying to cut it with my dessert spoon. Flavor was great, though, and I loved the savory coffee flavor in contrast to the sharp lime sorbet. \n\nWe also ordered the SOURDOUGH ($5). As expected in SF, the bread was on point! The portion was only four slices served with a whipped and salted butter, but they were BIG slices. I took most of it home and enjoyed it with that excellent salty butter and a strong black coffee the next morning - very European, right?\n\nOverall, at $65pp (not including the $42 wine pairing), the pricing felt fair for the quality of the meal. We left completely full and fully satiated. I would definitely come back.", "author": "Lexi W."}

The food was good, but nothing that blew me out of the water and service was fair. \n\nI came here with two other friends. I thought that this was the perfect arrangement because there were three choices per course. There were four courses to chose from. It's $65 for the four courses. It was nice to mix and match. \n\nThroughout the menu, it was good. I think that items were well cooked, but no flavor pairings were amazing. In the first course, I didn't think anything stood out too much. Even the beef tartare was only okay. It was good textures but it was under seasoned. \nThe second course was probably the most impressive for flavor profiles. The spatzel was good; it was more so for richness than flavors. The egg with burnt rice was a mixture of good textures. And the squid was my favorite. It was cooked well and presented so nicely! \nThe mains were also very good. I think the proteins in all of them were well prepared but the sides that accompanied them didn't do that much for me. They're simply seasoned. \nThe desserts were kind of disappointing. I didn't like the olive oil/cake/goat cheese whip. It just wasn't up my alley. I did like the others. They were light and not too overpowering. It was good. \n\nI would recommend this place for a very safe American choice... but I don't think that I would come back.", "author": "Tina Y."}

Everything had a light and satisfying finish and yet I was very full by the end of the meal...flavorful without being weighed down by sauces...not overwhelming in the amount of food given.  They also did a great job spacing out the dishes so that you can fully enjoy each course.

Having been here for brunch before, I recently had the chance to try their dinner service as well (which has a completely different menu). The service was extremely friendly, and as one of my dining companions was friends with our waiter, we got some really great recommendations as well!\n\nOur dinner started off with a plate of the homemade sourdough bread--this was one of the best sourdoughs I've ever had! It came with a cultured, salted butter that was absolutely irresistible, and the texture and flavor of the bread was unbelievable! For starters, we had the aged beef tartare, which was particularly beefy and raw tasting (thanks to the dry aging). We also had the brassicas, a light dish of root vegetables. But by far my favorite was the potato dumplings--these gnocchi were light and pillowy and saut\u00e9ed in butter; they came with toasted pine nuts, which added a contrasting crunch and earthiness that was absolutely fantastic!\n\nAnd then we moved on to entrees--the trout was decent, though it came with pieces of the hard outer leaves of artichoke, which were sharp and inedible, and these seemed to ruin the dish for me. The wild mushrooms with farro was a tasty dish as well, but my favorite was the duck breast, which was tender and had such a distinctive flavor--it also came with shreds of salty duck confit, which really brought the flavors of the dish over the edge!\n\nDessert here was definitely a highlight--the poached pear was served in a light syrup and filled with ice cream--so tender and not overly sweet. The frozen chocolate was unbelievable--the chocolate mousse was thick and creamy without being too heavy, and it was topped with a crunchy meringue, slightly tart huckleberry jam, and surrounded with cacao nibs, which added the perfect crunchy texture to the soft, delicate mousse. \n\nOverall, this was a great place for dinner--every dish was good, but some particularly stood out--the potato dumplings and frozen chocolate were probably the highlights for me! Given the menu prices, the portions were certainly a bit small, though this was not too much of a splurge for a Michelin-star restaurant!", "author": "David K."}

We sat at the large communal table on Wednesday night, 7:30pm and the restuarant never got super busy (I guess for a Wednesday). It's a 4-course pre-fix meal, with 3 options in each course. While figuring out our orders we started with a bottle of red and the bread/butter which I read rave reviews on. It was definitely delicious and soft, moist (everything you want in a good bread) plus the unique salted flavor of the butter was great... but I also just love bread and butter. For my meals I had the following: \n- Dry aged beef - interesting tar-tar like consistency with large puff on. 3.5 stars\n- Soft cooked egg and added uni - I love a good raw egg, but my friend and I both agreed this was kind of odd. The white was also decently raw, which was kind of weird to me. I could have done with just the raw yoke, but flavors were still good. It's one of their signature dishes, but I would venture to something else. \n- Hen - Yes, loved, moist, get this 4 stars. My friend's trout also looked delicious. \n- Chocolate custard - More like a soft chocolate bark with carmel inside and custard dots for decoration. It was a good, lighter way to end my meal so I recommend this if you like a lighter chocolate treat to end your meal\n\nOverall, it is more expensive, but the quality of food is there and the service is great.

I thought the food was good, but wasn't blown away despite its Michelin star status. The restaurant is really cute (perfect for date night!), the host was really friendly, but the meal was overall a little disorganized and overpriced...\n\nI was a little disgruntled to start because the restaurant raised their prices AFTER I booked my reservation on May 1 for June 10; well over a month in advance. This was when the prix fixe menu was priced at $65 pp, which I consider a good deal for a nice restaurant San Francisco. However, less than 24 hours before my reservation, I received a lovely voice message from the restaurant saying they have increased the price to $75 pp. Really.... I would expect them to either to 1) have notified me when they increased the price on June 1 as a courtesy; 2) honor the price made for guests who made reservations prior to June 1; or 3) list on their website their expected price change. I just think they have communicated/handled this poorly. \n\nI expressed my disappointment to the host, who said he'd ask, but never got back to me, so I had to reach out to him again at the end of my meal when we got the bill. I was referred to the restaurant manager who wouldn't budge about her decision and was not accommodating whatsoever. I'm also a little peeved that they didn't notify me until after the meal... At $75, I probably would have reconsidered dining here had I known about this price increase. $75 is a good threshold for price point. And they have a list of upcoming reservations, shouldn't they be transparent and let us know earlier? \n\nAnyway, onto the food:\nLike I said, it's a 4 course prix fixe menu. 1 cold app, 1 warm app, main, and dessert. I really appreciate that the dishes were all on the more light and refreshing side. I loved the egg bowl bacon dish because duh, bacon. The crispy rice added a nice texture to the dish. The granita dessert was awesome as well and perfect for a hot summer day. All dishes were plated so beautifully and totally instagram-worthy, so keep your phone in your pocket to take pictures. FYI, they charge $5 for the bread, which I personally did not think was worth it. However, my fiance liked it because the bread was soft and not crunchy like most sourdough breads.\n\nAs for service... We felt we were ignored for quite awhile and two different servers asked what drinks we'd like to order. They also forgot to bring packed leftovers when we paid the bill. My Lyft driver was outside when I realized this and scrambled back into the restaurant to pick up m boxed food.\n\nOverall, Aster was just an average meal, with some improvements to be made. I have gained a huge appreciation for chefs ever since watching Chef's Table on Netflix (haha). Chef Brett Cooper's has such a cool culinary experience such as developing the fire cooking program at Saison, cooking with now chef of State Bird Provisions, etc... so I was a little disappointed.\n\nAlso, note that this restaurant is pretty small and you may end up sitting at the communal table.

Courses used to be small/medium size. Now with the seven course tasting menu the dishes are extremely small. It's a shame because the courses you are really looking forward to are gone in just a few bites (like the beef course with a very small serving of beef). The service is good. Staff are pleasant and know their menu and produce well. We had seven courses plus wine pairings (which are great and do perfectly complement or bring to life the flavours as they should) and an additional cheese course. The menu doesn't show prices for the food or wine pairings. In all honesty we were a little surprised at the bill which was double what it was when we came the last few times. So for that we felt the very small plates didn't quite match up and decor (or location) could do with something more. Also as others have mentioned tables are a little too close together.

Sourdough was easy to bite into and the dark chocolate shavings just melt in your mouth. \nButtermilk biscuit, bacon, honey butter - this seemed like an odd dish since the biscuit and bacon don't seem to pair well together\nGoat cheese, poppy cracker, apricot jam, hazelnut - this was pretty tasty and the cheese had a light flavor that mixed well with the apricot and hazelnut\n\nEntree: \nDuck confit hash - two perfectly cooked runny eggs, duck was juicy mixed together with brussel sprouts and some sauce. breaking the eggs and mixing everything into one bite was delicious\n\nSourdough and duck confit hash were my favorite dishes here. -1 star for lack of service.

There were open tables around the sides but they made us wait 1/2 hour for the communal table because those tables were for special occasions. Never mind that my husband specified when making the reservation that this was a special occasion- my birthday- which was never acknowledged by the staff in any way- a first for a restaurant experience when you specify it's someone's birthday.\n\nAll in all I have to say I hated the service and hated the vibe of the restaurant which seemed to be: you should be honored to be spending your money here. The place seemed to cater to a young well to do crowd and for being in the Mission and being in SF it had a suffocatingly stuffy vibe and judgmental feel. I had a strong yearning for the old Bar Tartine where the service could be sloppy and haphazard but was almost always warm and welcoming.\n\nThe food was good, though it's not particularly innovative, just the usual heavy-ish California cuisine that felt like you were transported back to the 90s. Even when the food was good it felt like the chef was trying too hard and the food lacked vibrancy. For example we got the lamb special which was an over the top umami bomb. I thought I detected added MSG or Maggie sauce or marmite or some similar Umami boosting ingredient which seemed to me like cheating.\n\nBut overall the problem with this place is not so much the food as the attitude.

Decor is very simple and it really showcases the food. Service amazing, friendly, not pretentious and I felt they really genuinely wanted us to enjoy our meal. Started with a nice bottle of Terrebrune dry rose. Excellent wine. You must get the bread with the cultured salted butter. I could eat it everyday. I had the market greens it was so good so fresh. I took a taste of the dry aged beef it was rich and delicious. My next course was the rye spaetzle, the aroma when the dish was placed before me was amazing, it smelled like a loaf of rye. I love mushrooms and this was full of mushroom flavor very rich. Next up for me was the green farro probably my fav of the evening, if green had a flavor it would be this dish. Again when the dish was placed the aroma wafted up, I couldn't wait to eat it. I ended the meal with strawberry so refreshing.

First, great luck with walking in and getting seated immediately. The set up of the restaurant is very cool with a mix of tall and short seating options, a grand long high table in the middle and lower benches around the outside. The ambiance is very french, romantic, and I love the decor. \n\nWe each ordered wines to sip while debating the tasting menu although the wines didn't come until dinner was served. This was a little awkward for me as I wanted a wine before doing the dinner and wine pairing set but in the end all were delicious and much fun was had. Unfortunately I didn't end up getting to specify which wines should come with my food pairings, so while I started with a crisp white for an aperitif and intended to transition to reds for my meals, I ended up with all whites in my tasting regime. Not my usual preference but I decided to give it a try and was pleased, though would have preferred reds for the last two dishes.\n\nWe started with the fresh bread and cultured butter which was totally delightful. The bread had a wonderful crust with a soft delicious inside and the butter was delectable. \n\nWe all ordered the tasting menu which involves four courses and is totally worth it, and the price makes it an absolute must! For each course all members of the table can choose from four options which makes for a fun opportunity to mix and match. I am a lactose intolerant pescatarian and was delighted with the number of options I had to choose from which is rarely the case, especially for limited menus. I think this goes a long way to compliment the creativity of the chefs and dedication to local and fresh ingredients. \n\nI began with the Halibut which was a generous portion of fish, amazing pickled plum and shiso leaves which I love. The halibut was juicy and flaked off in plump bite size pieces packed with incredibly flavor. This was paired with a Sauvignon Blanc that was bright, smooth and really complemented the halibut and highlighted the shiso. \n\nNext was heirloom carrots with sunchokes, coconut and lime. This was simple but totally divine. The vegetables retained their hearty root nature despite being infused with incredible flavor making a great second dish. The sunchoke creaminess perfectly compliments the carrot crunchiness. \n\nMy third dish was trout with nettle, snap peas and benne. Again, the fish was incredibly well prepared, retaining good moisture and fresh flavor with a delicate texture. I was particularly curious about the nettle though I enjoyed the dish together so much that I forgot to pick some out on its own. The wine pairing with this dish was a bit too sweet for my flavor. \n\nThe final course is dessert for which our table ordered an assortment and shared (sometimes I defy my lactose troubles for the sake of deliciousness). The Oat Vacherin with honey and lavender was completely awesome, though I couldn't have very much of it. I specifically enjoyed the contrast of the oat chunks within the liquid lavendar/honey center. \nThe milk chocolate custard, sorrel, basil was a tempting play on bittersweet and fragrant. I am a diehard basil fan which I think fueled my love for this dish. My dining mates agreed with the chocolate custard but were skeptical of the basil pairing but I found this a refreshing contrast well deserved. \nThe final dessert we tried was the peach melba which was incredible. Absolutely vibrant and fresh flavor. \n\nHighly recommend Aster for a lovely evening, the four course tasting menu for a creative and delicious meal, and when it comes to the wine pairing, it's worth it just make sure to specify preferences!", "author": "Angela D."}

An affordable (by SF standards) 4 courses for $65, and every single dish was great. Wine pairings were a reasonable price (again, by SF standards) and well-curated with wines that brought out a lot of the subtle flavors of the food. \n\nThere were thought-provoking dishes that melded together flavors that I wouldn't normally associate with each other, such as the persimmon, yuzu preserve, brown butter squash, yogurt, and arugula dish. There were others that provided soft and crunchy textures to an already well-done dish, like the soft boiled egg with puffed rice and ikura or the dry aged beef tartare with rice crisps and furikake. Then, there were the dishes that were just plain perfectly cooked, like the duck and the trout. I think I always avoid the trout at restaurants since it's such a bland, flavorless fish that is often overcooked, but after reading other people's reviews on here, I went out on a limb and ordered it.. no regrets. It was great!\n\nI really hope they don't raise the prices like every good restaurant around here has been doing, because I would love to be able to come back again and again, and also to be able to recommend this to any out-of-town friends who are looking for a great meal that's representative of SF cuisine.", "author": "Kazu O."}

We sat at the long communal table in the middle, which was fine, (and the table is made of this gorgeous wood) BUT I could definitely hear the conversations to the left and right of me. I wanted to face palm when my fiance started talking to me about the same topic right after the people next to us started talking about it. Clearly, we were eavesdropping....\n\nWe had a 5 course meal, and since it was valentine's day, it was a set menu for over $120ish or so. This is almost double the normal menu price (granted the normal tasting menu has only 4 courses). Fine, it's valentine's day, I get it. Also, this was still cheaper than other michelin star's marked up Valentine's day dinners. So, overall, I think this would be a greaaat value at $65 for 4 courses. There was an appetizer supplement of uni that night. Of course I was super interested, and was pleasantly surprised that it would only be an additional $10, when I was expecting a heftier markup. (Hello Keiko a Nob Hill, asking me if I wanted to pay $50 for 'generous' shavings of truffle after letting me sniff it... no thank you... that's 1/3 of the price of the entire meal...)\n\nEverything about the food was amazing, we had scallop for appetizer, beet salad, a mushroom farro type dish, trout and a chocolate mousse dessert.

We were right next to the open kitchen and it was nice watching some of the chefs preparing and plating food. Our server, Ricky, was very warm, engaging, and personable, and we enjoyed all of his recommendations. Here's what we got:\n\nFirst course: \nDry aged beef with sea urchin add on (5/5) - One of our favorite dishes of the night. The texture and flavor was beautiful; it tasted tart from the umeboshi but rounded out towards the end, if that makes sense...\nCucumber (3/5) - Good flavor and texture, but could have used a touch more sweetness...more nectarine or a little less yogurt perhaps. Just a tad bit bland. Wish we had gotten two beef tartares instead lol\nCured trout belly with charred avo and nori-togarashi (4/5) - This was an add-on, the skin was almost like a chicharrone and the whole dish was really beautiful and very tasty as well.\nSourdough bread (5/5) - This bread was so good, crusty and robust and overall just amazing; how can you go wrong with bread?!\n\nSecond course:\nSoft cooked egg with sea urchin add on (3.5/5) - This was good but a bit too rich and heavy for my taste with the bacon..\nSquid (4.5/5) - The squid had really good texture and all the flavors were very cohesive for this dish.\n\nThird course\nTrout (4.5/5) - I really loved this dish. The fish was cooked perfectly and the miso glaze was excellent, albeit a tad bit too salty (although I think it's hard for a miso marinated dish not to be very salty)\nLamb (3.5/5) - This dish had beautiful presentation, with the lamb prepared three ways. I didn't particularly care for one of the three types but I forget which one \n\nFourth course\nStrawberry (2.5/5) - We both really didn't care for this dish, it came with some weirdly flavored marshmallow-looking things and overall just tasted kind of meh.\nChocolate custard (5/5) - Smooth, rich, and overall just beautiful. \n\nOverall most of the food was just okay. I was pretty impressed by the presentation of the food and especially by the dishware. While the service was good, eventually another couple was seated next to us and our server wasn't able to give us as much attention as I was hoping for.

Solid ingredients and great value for tasting menu. \n\n3 stars for ambience. A bit too bright with the blinding overhead lights. And the music is rock n roll with Tommy petty and Blondie, more for a beer place than a setting for classy tasting menu in SF. \n\nMost dishes are solid. I was not impressed with the wine pairing - skip it and pick your own. Out of the wine offered, I really liked the Hexamer Riesling from Germany. Very balanced. A hint of sweetness at the end. The roederer estate rose bubbly was quite good. Do not take the sweet wine pairing with the contralto cheese (just didn't pair well). If you are looking for rules of thumb on cheese wine pairing, read this article on Atlanta magazine: \n\nhttp://www.atlantamagazine.com/dining-news/high-on-the-vine-how-to-pair-wine-cheese/\n\nIn general, these Sauternes or sweet wine pairs best with blue cheese. I did a bit of research after the waiter mentioned that this is the typical pairing with contralto, and saw that even though Soyoung (the cheese maker) said that Sauternes is one wine that pairs generally across her cheeses, there are nuances of individual wines that pair well with each cheese (on her website) and white Burgundy tends to pair well with creamy goat cheese with the acidity cutting through the fatty tones of the creamy cheese.  \n\nOnto the food...\n\nHere are the best dishes:\nPork shoulder - very tender. Nice carrot sauce that adds color and vivacity to the flavor. Save your stomach for this dish though.\n\nBeets - a bit of cameralization adds complexity. \n\nSolid dishes:\nLamb - lamb loin was of great quality. Order this only if you have the stomach for it and love strong gamy flavor of lamb\n\nPotato dumpling - delicate. Love the vibrant green color of the Brussels sprouts, the subtle yet intense flavor of maitake mushroom, and the texture on the potato dumping. Quite buttery - I think that this dish can benefit from more acidity. Ask for a slice of lemon and try it out. \n\nContralto - I am a bit torn about this cheese since the wine pairing wasn't on point. I will try it again with white burgundy. I don't think that the cracker is the best way to serve this cheese. Fresh bread (non sourdough) is probably better to absorb the creaminess of the cheese. \n\nHokkaido squash soup - hearty but not exceptional. Again, I would add a bit of lemon to brighten up the flavor. Like the crunch that they have added to the soup. \n\nSkip:\nHazelnut gateau - a bit sweet for my taste and fell flat\nSourdough - if you are ordering tasting menu. It will fill you up and make you loose appetite for the other dishes\nSprouted grains - a bit too earthy for the first course.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Without exaggeration, there couldn't have been a more perfect meal to celebrate the evening.\n\nWell in advance, my partner requested that we not be seated at the communal table. We had a cozy two top right next to another couple celebrating their anniversary as well -- a happy coincidence.\n\nWe opted to buy a bottle of wine instead of doing the wine pairings. Our server, Ricky, was very knowledgeable about the offerings and recommended a Furmint, a white from Hungary that had a great price point and that we both enjoyed very, very much.\n\nFor the tasting menu, our highlights were the dry aged beef, the squid, the green farro and the chocolate custard dessert. If I could have a meal comprised entirely of the chocolate custard dessert, I would -- sublimely sweet caramel ice cream, coconut mochi pieces and toasted coconut topped with fresh fennel. I'm not normally a star of anise flavor but every bite was delectable.\n\nOn our way out we took the opportunity to thank the chef/owner, Brett Cooper, for making our anniversary meal spectacular. As a sweet gesture, they had given us a complementary dish of a citrusy sorbet atop an omebushi compote that was a refreshing palate cleanser between courses. Brett was very warm and gracious and bid us to come back again soon.\n\nWith such great service, a spectacular variety of dishes and a ton of flavors, we will definitely be visiting again (and bringing friends along with us)!", "author": "Bianca P."}

First two dishes (cucumber and shellfish) were absolutely beautiful, and taste was very good. Main (lamb) was ok - it looked better than it tasted to me. That said I was with someone who has a much more sophisticated palette than I do and he thought the parts of the lamb dish I didn't like were great, so it may be just me. I didn't like my dessert at all (cocoa nib financier) because it tasted more like a caprese salad than a dessert, but switched my date for his strawberry dish which was mind blowing amazing with mixed textures and temperatures. Other than the sake (which is a personal preference), the wine pairings were great. \n\nThe ambiance was higher end casual, in heels I felt overdressed. Nice lighting and the long communal table is nice. \n\nService was fantastic. All people in the establishment were helping out, friendly, knowledgeable and made the night enjoyable overall. \n\nLikely won't go back but it's worth a try for sure.", "author": "Caitlyn M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "It seems as though people haven't had positive experiences at Aster, but I had a fantastic time at dinner awhile back! Having heard a lot about Aster, and its recent inclusion on SF's Michelin List for 2016, I wanted to make sure that I gave it a fair shake before writing it off as a place to try but not in a hurry to get to.  In coming here with my in-laws, and knowing how hard it can be to sometimes come to a consensus on what to eat, Aster's four course menu option at $59/person seemed like the best way to go so that everyone could be satisfied with their meal.  That being said, it was pretty amusing that we all generally gravitated towards the same menu items save dessert. Since full participation is required by all parties at the table for the four course menu, we did our best to cover as much ground as possible. In any case, here's what went down that evening among the four of us:\n\nAppetizers (I):\nChicories, Olive, Early Girl Tomato & Buttermilk\nChilled Golden Beet Soup with Mussels, Pistachio Crumble, Dill\n\nI had the chicories salad and was a little hesitant about the inclusion of olives (not a huge fan) but actually this was really delicious and light! The tomatoes break up the saltiness of the salad, so it actually turned out to being a very well-balanced dish!\n\nAppetizers (II):\nPotato-Caraway Dumplings, Maitake, Brussels, Yogurt\nSweetbreads with Pickled Summer Squash, Charred Peppers, Thyme\nSourdough bread\n\nI absolutely loved the dumplings! I tried a half of the sweetbreads dish, and to be totally honest, I was annoyed that I had forfeited half of the dumplings dish for the sweetbreads.  The soft, pillow-y dumplings were fantastic, and the yogurt sauce that came with it was money. The sourdough bread that came was also incredible, and the presentation of the softened butter on the plate was genius since we were sharing. \n\nMains:\nTrout with Tokyo Turnip, Grapes, Charred Scallion, Brown Butter\nPork Shoulder with Sweet Potato, Umeboshi, Grilled Bok Choy\n\nI didn't get around to trying the trout, but the pork shoulder was good! It was a little on the small side for a main, so if you're looking for a hefty entree, be prepared. The pork was presented in little cubes/bite-sized, and was definitely pretty to look at.\n\nDessert:\nPink Lady Apple with Brioche, Sunflower Seed, Shiso\nFrozen Yogurt with Concord Grape, Sourdough\nChocolate Ganache with Black Caramel and Cocoa Nib\n\nI had the frozen yogurt, and I couldn't be more surprised when the dish came out and it was totally not what I was expecting! The concord grapes and jelly that came with the yogurt (which was presented in a square!) was delicious and definitely something that I had never tasted before!  Things were going well until I saw that my father-in-law had ordered the chocolate ganache, and had a small bit of regret when I saw how beautiful the plate was.  He definitely enjoyed the chocolate ganache but said that the black caramel was something he didn't really enjoy since it was a little too bitter.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed the meal at Aster, and service wise, everything came out in a timely manner and our server was very helpful in assisting us with the navigation of the menu.  The restaurant itself wasn't overly busy, but I felt like we had just enough attention paid to us and not overwhelming at the same time.  I would definitely like to visit Aster again, and I would like select the four course menu option as well since I think this was the best way to try as much as possible and not run the risk of being uncomfortably full.", "author": "Lisa I."}

The halibut with berries was fantastic, as was the frozen peach mousse dessert.  The other courses were all good to great, and creative elements throughout.  My hang up, like many other recent reviews, is the new price tag.  To spend almost $500 for two people (after drinks, tax, tip), every course should have been spectacular.  You can have a meal that is as good or better for half the price all over the Bay Area.  It may not have the detail and attentiveness that the full staff offers at Aster, but I don't think we'll be back for as long as the 7-course tasting is the only offering.  At the end of the day, I think there's a reason this is the only Michelin-star restaurant in SF (that I've seen) that you can just walk into and get a table any time of night, and would be excited to see Aster revert back to the more accessible menu/price point that earned them the notoriety in the first place.", "author": "Daniel V."}

In fact, the worst service I've ever had. We made reservations for 4 and a baby. We requested a high chair, however when I arrived at the restaurant with my 14 month baby girl, I was greeted with appalled looks from the hostess and uncomfortable stares from the waitstaff. She was upset and confused on why I would bring my baby and a stroller. She continued to ask me, why I didn't make a note in the reservation that I would have a stroller. She even scolded me. I have never been treated this way at a restaurant for bringing my baby and a stroller. The waitstaff stared and treated my baby like she was an alien. Like they have never seen a baby before. I have to mention, my baby did not cry during the entire evening, nor was she disruptive. I will NEVER return to this restaurant. And I would suggest anyone who has children not to bring their children to this restaurant. This restaurant should make it very clear that it is NOT kid-friendly because it isn't. In fact, if you bring your child to this restaurant, they will make you feel incredibly uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that you can not enjoy the delicious food.

Full disclosure: I went a few months ago. I was so upset about the experience that I decided to wait until I calmed down to write a review. \n\nMy co worker and I popped in for dinner on a weekday night. We are both serious foodies and were wondering what the hype was about. I had, hands down, the worst experience, I've ever had at a restaurant. \n\nBetween the 2 of us, we ordered the beef, salad, soft-cooked egg, the potato dumplings, duck, a fish entree,  the frozen chocolate, another dessert, and bread. We both also each had a glass of wine. \n\nThe food was clearly not memorable, as I have already forgotten a few of the dishes. They tasted ok, but nothing that made me feel like I would come back to try more or have the same thing again. \n\nThe service is truly the reason why I decided to write this review. The restaurant is not well lit. This is the type of place where people might hold a candle up to the menu or have their phone flashlight on in order to read the menu. I had ordered a darker sparkling rose. After drinking half of the glass, and was halfway through with my duck entree, I finally actually looked at my wine and saw that there was a black thing floating in my glass. Because the glass opening was smaller than my spoon, I decided to use my fingers to fish the black thing out. Turns out, it was a dead beetle. Yup, a beetle. The server served me a dead beetle with my wine. I stared at the dead beetle, now sitting on my duck plate, for a few good minutes due to shock before attempting to call our server over. He was nowhere to be found. Luckily(?), we sat close to the hostess. She just kept staring at me, as I had a look of horror on my face. After 5 minutes, she decided to approach to ask what was wrong. I pointed out the dead beetle, and she whisked my plate and wine glass away. \n\nTo make a long story short, I never had a chance to finish my duck, nor did I want to eat much more after the experience. The glass was also taken away, and never replaced with something else. The server was never notified of the issue.. He only found out 15 minutes later, after I informed him. He never apologized. I asked to see a manager about this, and only saw the manager after another 10 minutes. The manager, like the server, didn't offer an apology. Instead, she said it was the winery's fault. I don't care that it was the winery's fault. You served me the wine. There was never any effort made to rectify the situation, like offering me another glass of wine because I never finished my glass in the first place. \n\nEven at a McDonald's, if you found a hair or an insect in the food, they would offer to make you a new sandwich or whatever, no questions asked. This restaurant has a Michelin star. There is clearly no communication or training on what should be done in a situation like this. Both the server and manager were like deer in the headlights. \n\nThank you, but no thank you, Aster. I will not be back and I've been telling all my friends to never come to this restaurant. I understand that the beetle may not have been your fault, but it is your responsibility to not serve it, or apologize if you did serve it. Neither of which was done. And even if the beetle situation didn't happen, the food was not Michelin star quality. There are far better restaurants in the city where you can spend your money and not regret it.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-07", "description": "Chef Brett Cooper has such an impressive culinary pedigree (Rubicon, Coi, Saison, Outerlands... Outerlands?) that it would have been near-to-impossible for him to fail in this relatively new venture under the auspices of Daniel Patterson (Coi). Jamie W. decided to take me here for my birthday even though he probably could have gone for a burrito bowl at Chipotle given what he perceived to be a persnickety approach to the dishes. I certainly won't argue the meticulous nature of the presentations, but thankfully Cooper has managed to balance most of the bold flavors he and his staff blend together on each plate. Our challenge, and perhaps it was a petty one, was the smallness of the portions.\n\nUnderstand I was raised by a dad who constantly took us to \"All You Can Eat\" cafeterias because he was always looking to maximize his money even if the lasting impact was the bottomless pit of my stomach. Even with this in mind, it made sense to go for the $59 four-course dinner for me, while Jamie ordered two plates even if it meant a couple of bites a piece for both of us on a couple of shared plates. He first started with the $12 Chilled Golden Beet Soup, which required the server to present the supporting ingredients - mussels, pistachio and dill - naked in a bowl before she poured the soup (photo: http://bit.ly/1je7vBJ). It was a confusing preamble to a luxuriant ladle of soup. Yes, it was tasty.\n\nMine came next, the $13 Duck Liver Mousse which was almost completely hidden by a passel of fennel marinated with sesame, sprouted grains that tasted like wheat kernels and a strawberry coulis (photo: http://bit.ly/1Onhame). Bits of actual duck were mixed in to give the dish a bit more savory heft. Very good and gone in about two minutes. We decided to share the $17 Sweetbreads which were given a surprising deep-fried treatment and covered with a pickled summer squash relish mixed with charred peppers and thyme (photo: http://bit.ly/1R0C9bX). The consistency of the sweetbreads was perfect, but given my druthers, I would have preferred them more naked and less Southern in treatment.\n\nEntrees came next, and here is where the meal started to pay off more discernibly. Jamie ordered the $24 Pork Shoulder with sweet potato, creamed rhubarb, and grilled bok choy, and it was a savory hit in a more satisfying portion (photo: http://bit.ly/1hrOQAo). Mine was even better, the $27 Milk-Fed Lamb, which was prepared three ways and accompanied by pole & shelling beans, smoked eggplant and nepitella (an Italian mint herb) (photo: http://bit.ly/1LmX6tu). That was a masterful dish beautifully prepared with the grilled lamb roulade particularly winning. I got a dessert with my meal, so we shared the $12 Chocolate Ganache, two small blocks of dark chocolate and an unbelievably creamy dollop of white chocolate, with black caramel and cocoa nibs (photo: http://bit.ly/1jaGkXT).\n\nIt was a strong finish to an impressive meal that was only curtailed by misjudged portion control. I forgot to describe the ambiance, which was deceptively casual in spite of the price points. The strings of lights on the ceiling were another source of deception but in a good way in the way they reflected in the mirrors. We were seated in the central communal table which fortunately didn't crowd up until we were finishing our meal. A particularly affectionate couple locked hands as if they were ready to arm wrestle despite the broadness of he table width. Jamie and I were not nearly as demonstrative. An occasional wave sufficed until we left the restaurant into the wilds of the Mission.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a strong finish with the lamb and the ganache helping to overcome our marginal disappointment at the paltry portions\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...casual considering the price point, a bit loud judging by the cackling hen party behind us\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...efficient, not overly intrusive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Cooper has talent on display here, still think there could be refinements and maybe an extra sweetbread or two on the plate", "author": "Ed U."}

There is a large community table in the center which feels nice and \"homey\" as well.\n\nThey serve four barrel coffee. Nuff said. You don't go into a restaurant expecting to have some of the best coffee in town, you expect great food and mediocre coffee (at best) but it's was brewed perfectly! I decided to get the duck confit which not only tasted amazing but looked beautiful as well. I've never seen poached eggs look so beautiful in my life. Started off with the smoked black cod on a cute little pancake. You might think it to be odd but it was such a good flavor combination. Also, you must have the sourdough with salted butter and dark chocolate shavings on top. Perfection.\n\nThe last thing I would talk about would be the service.

We are both vegetarian, and normally, we skip over places with such limited menus because we enjoy ordering a bunch of different dishes and sharing everything. But we'd heard good things and wanted to give it a try. We ordered the house sourdough and butter and our choices for the four course tasting were as follows (copied from the menu):\nMarket greens (avocado, toasted seeds, blackberry, honey-lime)\nMatsutake (cabbage, apple, garlic)\nGreen Farro (peas, ramps, sheep's milk ricotta, nasturtium) \nStrawberry (chamomile, lemon, sesame, coriander)\nFrozen Yogurt (berries, honey, Szechuan pepper) \n\nWe also shared wine pairing.  Service was excellent, as one expects in a Michelin starred restaurant. There were a few service mishaps (wine pairing brought out late, mixed up dessert order) but they acknowledged and corrected mistakes immediately. \n\nAs everyone has stated, get the bread. It's wonderful as is the salted butter that it comes with. We loved the salad. It was perfectly balanced in taste and in texture. The mushroom dish was great in that it highlighted the matsutakes, but it was pretty one note overall. The farro was good-- very green and fresh tasting, but we were disappointed because we prefer a slightly creamier preparation of farro and had been anticipating that. They were very kind and brought a small rice milk frozen treat with a candle to celebrate on the house. The desserts themselves were okay-- very complex and not cloying, but also not amazing enough that we kept wanting more (which is sort of a key indicator of whether we liked something or not). \n\nOverall? We liked it, but it felt like the food was high concept and we just couldn't appreciate it.  We'd recommend to our friends that eat meat and want a slightly more affordable fine-dining experience.", "author": "T K."}

From $7 beer in a plastic pee pee cup, $15 sammies, to a $49 million condo (yes, it exists: http://bit.ly/1CsQQ1V). For pete's sake, my parking space at work has gone up $90 a month and when I step out of my car, there's a pool of used needles on the floor and a drunk hobo offering me a sip of his 40. Sorry, dude...not before 7 am but maybe at happy hour?\n\nWhen it comes to food, I know no boundaries...as long as it's good, I don't mind splurging. For date night, I picked Aster, the new restaurant that opened last week in the old Beast And The Hare space from the Daniel Patterson Group (Coi, Plum, Alta CA). The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. Prices included tip but not tax. \n\nOur waiter recommended that each person order one dish from each category but $200 for a regular date night was too spendy so we ordered 1 small bite, 1 app, and 1 dessert to share, and we each ordered our own entr\u00e9e. Portions are tiny for the high prices but we didn't leave hungry. If you have large appetite, I would plan for a second dinner: 20 piece McD nuggets for $5. FTW!\n\nWe started with the Pig Croquettes ($6) had an uber soft gelatinous center with a nice, crunchy crust: http://bit.ly/1CsQQ1V. Good amuse bouche-type starter. \n\nEverything we had after that was underwhelming. Nothing was remotely bad but when compared to all the other brand new restaurants we visited this year (BDK, Sous Beurre Kitchen, Dragon Beaux, Liholiho, Al's Place, Cockscomb, Californios, and The Progress) nothing stood out. \n\nThe Cold Smoked Trout ($17) was ok but I wish there was more smoke essence: http://bit.ly/1DbLCJp. My Black Pepper-Potato Dumpling entr\u00e9e ($27) was like a pan-fried gnocchi: http://bit.ly/1xWSjPd. Mr. NSS' Lamb Shoulder entr\u00e9e ($33) was tender but minuscule and way overpriced: http://bit.ly/1CbUjys. It reminded me of a braised beef dish we had at their sister restaurant, Alta CA except this was $10 more and half the portion. =/\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Strawberry w/ cultured cream ($12) which was light and refreshing but nothing earth shattering: http://bit.ly/1aCkJUt.\n\nI washed everything down with a glass of the Hobo Cab ($15) and the La Rioja Tempranillo ($15). The latter was wonderful and highly recommended. \n\nService was polite but there were some kinks as to be expected with any new restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly but went MIA after we received our order that we had to request a knife from the manager (?), and ordered dessert from the hostess. \n\nContemporary rustic space with track lighting. Good for small groups only but there is a large communal table (fits 12) which I believe are for walk-ins. \n\nParking is horrible in the area but there's a parking lot 2.5 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. \n\nI feel bad for just giving 3 stars but the prices were too high for underwhelming food. I forgot to mention, it was $5 for a 6 ounce glass of soda filled with 90% ice. \n\nAND, Mr. NSS, had the balls to order two!\n\nNo wonder he said, it was my turn to pay...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Once we were seated, the waitress came to our table immediately to take drink orders and to ask us if we had any questions. Throughout our meal, the service was very quick and the staff was courteous. I would give them a 5/5 for service without a doubt. \n   Now to the food. I can say the best thing we had was the appetizer. We ordered the potato dumplings (which do not resemble anything like a traditional dumpling). They were good but the description on the menu for this dish was vague. Next, we moved on to the entrees. I ordered the pork while my friend ordered the duck. Unfortunately, my pork seemed to be on the brink of being undercooked which really freaked me out because I recently contracted a food borne illness at a restaurant for having undercooked meat. The pork was just not cooked to my liking so I was unable to eat all of it. My friends duck was just okay but he didn't really care for it. Finally, we moved on to the desserts and we were underwhelmed by what we received. The frozen chocolate was very simple and we could tell it was pre-made by how cold the plate was. The lemon merengue was placed on the sides of the chocolate dessert and server almost no purpose because it lacked flavor and the texture was similar to chalk. \n  Overall, this place seemed really underwhelming and I was disappointed because the reviews were good when I scrolled through. I do not think I will be returning and I hope the food progressively becomes better in the future.", "author": "Ricardo R."}

(it's a funny story how we met - if you message me, I might let you know). This place is in the same group as Alta and that's one of our favorite places to grab a drink together. \n\nThe Michelin star was definitely a reason why j decided to come here, but it was actually really enjoyable for both my friend and me. We went with the 4 course dinner and wine pairings. \n\nWe did get some bread - some delicious bread that was. Sourdough with this awesome butter. \n\nI started with the trout; I guess I had expected it to be cooked, but it was raw. It was delicious though. The friend got the sprouted and puffed grains. I got one bite of it and it looked interesting. Definitely liked the trout more.  \n\nFor our second course, I ordered the potato dumplings and he ordered the soft boiled egg. The dumplings were good - the mushrooms were good even though if you know me - I dont love them. The soft boiled egg was interesting, but not as good as the dumplings. \n\nNext course, I got the duck and he the pork.  The duck was interesting - I didn't love the rhubarb and other additions (especially the olive jam that came along), but the duck itself was amazing. The pork was pretty good as well - didn't have much of it, but the sauce seemed really good. \n\nLastly, for dessert, I got the milk chocolate custard and him the strawberry parfait.  I super enjoyed the custard - it had an interesting herby addition of sorrel which I had never heard of before. It was good though! The strawberry parfait was pretty good too! Frozen strawberries are amazing! \n\nService was great!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "I dined here with a friend last November and we both got the 4-course menu with wine pairings. First off, Aster is an affordable michelin stared restaurant, but I'm not entirely convinced that the cuisine is reflective of one. The cuisine is Californian with some farm-to-table influence. \n\nThe good:\n-The thumbelina carrots were so simple, but complimented with sunchoke and lime to create a harmony of sweet and savory. It is reminiscent of Nightbird's corn in 3 ways dish.\n-Potato dumplings were an umami bomb with chanterelle, eggplant, black garlic, and hazelnut. I wish this came in a bigger serving because it was SO good!\n\nThe mediocre:\n-Pork with miso potatoes, brussels, and grapes was a very simple dish. Very small portions; 2 pieces pork belly the size of a dollar coin and 2 pieces of 2 tenderloin. Overall it was an OK flavor combination, nothing spectacular.\n-Soft-cooked eggs with puffed rice, salmon roe, and bacon vinaigrette was WAY salty. The puffed rice was more burned, and the bacon vinagrette was kind of like those burned bacon pan drippings. This was only exacerbated by the salmon roe.\n-Kampachi with cucumber, pickled plum and shiso was simple. Nothing memorable.\n\nThe wine pairing was OK as well. You get 4 glasses total, and for $36 its not that expensive to feel regretful about. None of the pairings elevated the dish much or were just standard textbook pairings. My gripes with this place are the portion sizes that are on the smaller size, making this place slightly more expensive than it needs to be. Another issue was the service was horrendously SLOW. Our whole dining experience took 3 hours; ~20 minutes for us to get our order taken after being seated. Our waiter kept putting us on hold. The interim between each course was also unjustifiably long. For 3 hours you could get swept away by a tasting menu, relatively speaking. \n\nOverall Aster had some interesting dishes, but the entrees were nothing memorable. Desserts were OK too. I think the kitchen is understaffed because I only saw 2-3 cooks there.\nI'm not in any rush to come back with all the other great alternatives in the city.", "author": "Chad S."}

I received a call the day before our reservation to confirm the appointment for party of five at 7:00 pm. First, she asked if we were still planning on coming. Duh. I made the reservation two months ago so yes we're planning to come. I mean it literally took me months to get reservations for a group of five that is at a decent dinner time instead of past 9 pm.  She then said, \"Also there has been a price increase for the prix fixe menu and that we no longer serve ala carte items.\" This is what was annoying. I did not mind so much the amount of price increase (10) and the menu change, but what did not make sense was the way she informed me, which was one day before my reservation. For a one star Michelin restaurant, this was not something you would expect. She said, \"this price change has been long time coming.\" Strange. If they knew this was \"long time coming\" how come I only heard about this the day before my reservation?? They had my phone number and email from day one. It sounded like they were planning this change for months. Could they have not made a call or sent a brief email to inform me of these changes given they literally had two months to do so? Any day between April and June would have been a nice gesture. \n\nRegardless we showed up the next day because we were not given any other choice since all other Michelin star restaurants were already booked in SF for party of five. I get there and also noticed their menu items changed. No more duck! The only meat item on the entree list was lamb and I do not eat lamb. So I ordered the following: \n\n1) Dry aged beef tartare: way tooo much and over-powering lemon aioli.\n\n2) Squid: sauce was too salty. Squid was tender though. \n\n3) Trout: sauce was too salty again. I liked the crispy skin of the trout but it was nothing special. \n\nBonus: small sorbet balls to celebrate our recent wedding. I just found it weird that only two out of five people at our table received a small sorbet scoop even though all five of us were celebrating together. \n\n4) Chocolate dessert dish: pretty yummy prob the best thing that happened all night. \n\nAfter all courses, I was still hungry. \n\nOverall take-away: not worth the money, lacks flavor, too salty. Two stars for our servers who were polite, patient, and competently answered all our questions at the dinner table. Minus one star for the way Aster management handled the phone call and menu change. Minus one star for food saltiness and flavoring. Minus one star for portion size.", "author": "J C."}

I walked gingerly, skipping puddles as I had been working and did not have time to change into my rain boots. Restaurant called and said that there were some cancelations due to weather and asked if we'd be willing to come early. I emailed friends mid day and solidified a 8 PM dinner schedule in lieu of 9:30. Pouring rain. We got the best seat in the house, it's tucked in by the front window, you simply cannot get a better view than that with the rain coming down. Endless Victorians. A bottle of Bordeaux was ordered for the table. San Francisco is now rich people's playground, with residential home sometimes well over $1000 per sq foot (Nice, Provence, in French Riviera, where I'm at, at the top of the market is about $400 per sq foot). Aster's prime Guerrero and 22nd street location is a quintessential food mecca. They are surrounded by their peers and the food, as I'd later learn, justifies its one star Michelin rating.\n\nThat evening, instead of looking at the traffic, with the rain storm hitting us, you see a skewed view of the streets and car passing, and a lot of Victorian architectural elements through the window. \n\nWe went for the 4-course but there were lots to choose from. The price range is right for what we want to eat, the portion of the food well managed. The scallops were quite delicious, the second course were dumplings, pumpkin soup, and soft boiled egg with salmon roe. Simply all divine. The mains we chose were pork shoulder and lamb. The desserts were good, but for me, thankfully, they had included cheese. \n\nOverall, the food reflects this city: it's modern, Californian, European light, with abundant Asian influence. \n\nThe menu is surprisingly assembled similarly to Sbraga, which also serves a four course menu for the same price range, and located in Philly. I'd be interested in seeing if the two chefs have studied under the same chef. \n\nThink, I shall rename the city by the bay as La Petite Ville de Bijou Victorienne (the Small city of Victorian jewel,) after dining here. It's that quintessential Californian cuisine coupled with the locale that give Aster, the newly minted Michelin star restaurant a leg up over its peers. While it's the chef's name dropping prior digs at Saison, Coi, State Bird, Outerlands that send new patrons here; it's the food, however, that keeps people coming back.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I was able to make same day reservations for a dinner on a Thursday night, for a party of 4 at 6:30pm. Our table was ready when we arrived, and they weren't busy at all during that time. The restaurant eventually got busier, but they weren't packed by any means. We tried:\n\n-Sourdough (House Cultured Butter, $5, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3V91ozGWsarim2yG3Wa3_A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok- the bread was very dense, and I thought the butter was too sour and had the texture of a Greek yogurt versus butter. I wish restaurants had an option for diners to choose regular butter instead of all this house cultured butter, since I always think regular butter tastes better. Skip!\n-Bay Scallop (Radish, Persimmon, Sunflower Seed, Basil, $16, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iW1NuR3K3oYJtr2Pupfm0Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the scallop was super fresh, and went really well with the rest of the ingredients.

The texture of the sprouted grains was strange, and I didn't get the strawberries. We all felt like this dish needed a bread/cracker of some sort since the mousse was too rich to eat on its own. \n-Soft-Cooked Egg (Crispy Potato, King Salmon Roe, Agretti, $14 + Uni Add-On, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LNrO4lpgUaRpUmpiilMZ7A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I thought I would love this dish, and it was good, but the crispy potato really threw off the texture for me. I wasn't a fan of the combination of ingredients for this dish, and wouldn't order it again. However, the uni was really fresh, but not worth the cost of adding it on.\n-Potato-Caraway Dumplings (Chanterelle, Brussels, Yogurt, $15, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uv33KtF3oUmYDp7rnUMOoQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was probably my favorite dish of the night.

Slightly higher on the price scale at $59 per person, but the quantity of food that you get for 4 plates is pretty decent, and the quality of the food, plating, and service is nice. The ambiance is also great, quiet, and perfect for a date night (but probably not a first date) or a party of 4.\n\nIf you choose to do the tasting menu, everyone in the party must participate. Otherwise, you can get items a la carte.\n\nWe got the sourdough bread & butter for $5 as a starter, and it was delicious. I think that if you're paying $60 a head, the bread and butter should be complimentary, because it probably costs them $0.50. But it was fresh & delicious nonetheless. You get 4 pieces with butter that has sea salt flakes on top.\n\nI came here in April 2016, so some of the dishes that I ate are probably not on the menu anymore, but out of what I got, I loved the trout and the potato dumplings (gnocchi) the best. But I don't think you can go wrong with anything.\n\nLocal Halibut - This was a cold dish with cucumbers, pickled plums, and shiso. The proportion of fish to cucumbers was definitely light, and it seemed mostly like cucumbers. It was good, but not necessarily the most memorable of appetizers I've had.\n\nPotato Dumplings - This came with fava beans, pickled mushrooms, and fennel and I really liked this. The gnocchi was fresh and pan-seared, and the fava beans were a nice complement to the starchiness. I'd get this again if they had it on the menu.\n\nTrout - This was a generous serving size of trout, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and perfectly cooked. It was served on top of snap peas, and it all came together really well.\n\nHazelnut Gateau - This was a cake that came with sliced kumquat on top, and hazelnuts on top. I didn't really taste hazelnuts inside of the cake -- if it was ground up in there, I couldn't taste it very well. I thought it was on the dry side and didn't really care for this dessert.\n\nMilk Chocolate Custard - This looked like it had a little garden growing on top of the chocolate cake. My friend got this, and once I tried a bite of her dessert, I wish I had gotten this one instead. \n\nAll in all, a nice meal - they didn't really do a ton of crazy combinations and I didn't find the dishes terribly unique, but instead they focus on fresh ingredients. They don't go overboard on trying to combine too many different flavors, so that you can taste everything you are eating. With the 4 course menu, you won't be hungry when you leave (and I eat a lot).

The halibut was sashimi style, with radishes and chili oil on top, that was great, however they also sprinkled peanuts on it which just didn't seam to belong. The garlic soup was delicious, but again it had raw daikon which I had to just chew away, it didn't seem to blend well with the dish. Also ordered the house made sourdough (which is quite the rip off that they charge just for bread). \n\nFor the main course I got the poached salmon and hubby got the lamb. Both were small portions and decent tasting. \n\nThe dessert was by far my favorite course, as the frozen chocolate was delicious with tiny marshmallows and mango puree drops. \n\nUsually a restaurant will earn back some stars if the food is subpar but the dessert is good, but I felt Aster was lacking in the service. The servers never actually talked to us, just dropped off the food and left. Our waiter seemed chatty with all the other tables but us, and never really explained the menu. The only thing he did manage to say was that they now accept tipping, so that's encouraged. So after we tipped on our way out not a single staff member said bye, or have a nice night, we just walked our selves out.\n\nSo in total I was not impressed, the food was alright, but its definitely lacking in service.", "author": "Bevi K."}

It's a wonderful way to get a good feel for Aster's style and approach to food.\n\nSTARTER: The bread is so soft and sour, and the butter is seriously heartwarming.\n\n1. DRY AGED BEEF, HUSK CHERRIES, BROWN CRISP RICE, KIMCHI FUNKAKE:\nTexture was king here. The crisp rice was very brittle so it was a little difficult to eat with everything, but I liked the crunch with the beef. This is more of a tartare and a nice way to start a meal.\n\n2. PINK LADY APPLE, YUZU PRESERVE, BROWN BUTTER-SQUASH, YOGURT, ARUGULA:\nSurprisingly, this was hands down the most interesting dish we were served. The textures were interesting, but it was the flavor combo that really made the table go quiet and have a moment.\n\n3. SOFT COOKED EGG, CRISPY POTATO, SALMON ROE, BACON VINAIGRETTE:\nI saw this dish being made on Chefsfeed, and it made me immediately book a reservation here. It did not disappoint. As expected, it's super salty, but it was a an enjoyable, savory, umami explosion. It was a nice followup to the tart, creamy apple dish beforehand.\n\n4. POTATO DUMPLINGS:\nThese were DECADENT. This was a course where there was closing of eyes, no real words, and knowing looks. I think we made the table next to us uncomfortable, until they too got this course. Loved the slight crisp of the dumpling, and all of the crispy/harder textures with it. I could have had all four courses of this.\n\n5. DUCK, CELERIAC, QUINCE, MAITAKE:\nThis was the best cooked duck meat I have ever had. So soft and savory, and it paired really nicely with the sweet sauce. The duck is the heartthrob of this plate.\n\n6. TROUT, ARTICHOKE, SHELLING BEANS, ORO BLANCO, PRESERVED MEYER LEMON:\nTasty, but definitely my least favorite. The bean flavor was really dominant, and the other flavors didn't come out as much as I would have liked (especially the subtle fish that had such a pretty sear).\n\n7. POACHED PEAR, PISTACHIO, VANILLA:\nI was excited for a pear based dessert, and this did not let me down.\n\n8. FROZEN CHOCOLATE:\nI thought I was sold with the poached pear, but this smacked me in the mouth and made me feel stupid for even considering a fruit for dessert. If you are a chocolate fan, DO NOT miss out on this.\n\nWe opted for our own wine choices instead of the pairing. Looking back, we think it may have been better to do the pairing, as it's not much more at the end of dinner of you know you'll have more than one glass of something.\n\nCute, quiet location.\n\nService was very personal, not too pushy and incredibly pleasant.", "author": "Haley J."}

Been waiting for this place to open to try and we stumbled upon a reservation a couple weeks ago.\n\nFood- I can definitely taste the Outerlands' style in the food! Cod wing was interesting, prepared with spicy yuzu and plum vinegar. It was soft, light, and a bit tangy. Young kale was like a salad that came with delicious carrot chips. Green garlic soup was tasty, not very garlic and Aster split the portion into two bowls without me or my husband asking. Each portion was the size of one full portion! Potato dumplings were pretty delicious, a bit peppery, but that added some good heat, tasted like gnocchi, served maitake mushrooms, peas and charred scallions. I was so full already, but dessert did not disappoint! The frozen chocolate was yummy. Husband ordered the green elixir which tasted good.\n\nDecor/ambiance- good use of the space and sleek design/decor. Dimly lit so each table had additional candlelight. If you want brighter lighting, dine here earlier. We had 7:30pm reservations and they dimmed the restaurant even more during our meal.\n\nService- staff are friendly and took our order accurately. However, our waiter came by and told us he will get us water when another staff member already poured us water. Another instance (I forget the details) suggested he didn't remember something. Overall, service was okay. I think a chef dined right next to us, so a chef always bought over his dishes with nice introductions. \n \nOverall- good experience with interesting food. I would come back to try other items and when they change up the menu. Portions are of decent size and service charge is already included in the prices, so your bill is only the prices on the menu plus tax.

She confirms a time and date then gives me driving instructions.  Being familiar with the neighborhood, we were fortunate to score a street parking space just a few blocks away.  Walking into this corner restaurant, I gazed at its interesting design, a cozy feel to an industrial space.  I remember the restaurant name, but could not put the face to the place.  Only after searching my phone did I remember.  After a quick gaze through the menu, we agreed on the four course menu for $59.00 which went like this for me:\n\n1.  Golden beet soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Dd3VqyifpoiKSOm76svPg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Great summer dish, serving a cold soup; nice flavors with the sweetness of the golden beet and the brininess of the mussels.\n\n2.  Soft cooked egg (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DiczIjnkFUK8FcpDsn8D9g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - What's not to love about soft egg?!  The crispy potatoes weren't all that crispy as this had more of a salad feel than a carb dish.\n\n3.  Milk fed lamb (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NBzNYqaByNx7gq7v2eFBGg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Done two ways, the lamb was tasty and not the least bit gamey.  The eggplant puree and flavors definitely gave this a Mediterranean feel.\n\n4.  Chocolate ganache (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kiQwjBZELYTjwsQSDA6r4A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably my least favorite as nothing about this really shined.  Because my gracious host did not enjoy her dessert, I gave her my macarons.\n\nGiven the chef's pedigree and after reading M. Bauer's recent Sunday paper review, my expectations were tempered but with a lean towards the higher side.  The meal was fine and the presentations and flavors were interesting with the first two dishes being my favorites.  We also ordered the bread service (yes, it's extra) which did not disappoint.  \nThe dining room was only a quarter full when we arrived just about 6:30 pm on a recent Friday night, not really a good sign for a growing business.  The service was very efficient and professional as dishes were quickly cleared and beverage glasses were replenished.  The food rates 3.5 stars in my book with a 0.5 star bump for the service.  The location reminded me of several long gone restaurants that I do miss, Watergate on Valencia and Flying Saucer.

The bread was warm, delicious, and generous in quantity. It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but the salted butter complemented it nicely.\n\nSince we got a lot of food between the four of us, I'll just review them all in list form:\n\nSprouted & Puffed Grains: eh. The puffed parts themselves were nice (reminded me of rice krispies) and the yogurt went well with it. It just didn't blow me out of the water and was almost an overwhelming flavor .\n\nBeets: I loved these! They were cooked so nicely and I stole three off my brother's plate. They tasted earthy and just delicious.\n\nSpring Greens: Delicious, but presented really poorly. Upon first glance, it just looked like a normal salad. We didn't realize there was avocado until a couple bites in because it was hidden.\n\nLocal Halibut: Yum! The fish was nice, fresh and tender. Reminded me of ceviche almost.\n\nSoft-cooked egg: The concept was nice, but it really did not just work well together. In the words of my brother, \"it tastes like that asian snack mix from Costco\". I personally think the roe made it too fishy, but I also have an unsophisticated palate.\n\nPotato Dumplings: Also not great. The gnocchi was cooked well, but the copious amount of cheese on top made it taste like one of those Pirate's Booty cheese puffs but not in a good way. \n\nAsparagus: The presentation wasn't nice, but the asparagus itself was cooked thoroughly and tasted good. However, I don't think it was delicious enough to merit 25 dollars.\n\nMilk Chocolate Custard: Delicious (I love chocolate) but we found a hair in it. It wasn't a big deal but it just put me off, especially since we were in such a nice restaurant. They didn't really do anything about it, either, just briefly apologized.\n\nOverall, an underwhelming experience at what's supposed to be one of the world's finest restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "I am usually not one to write reviews, but I felt that this review needs to be made so that others can learn from our experience. \n\nMy family of 4 came in knowing that it was a $75/person, 4 course meal, (so around 300, not including wine). That was fine by me. However, the reason why I am upset is due to the service, portions, and pricing of the upcharges. \n\nOur reservation was at 545, we left the restaurant at 830... The restaurant was not busy when we arrived and it took an hour from our 1st course to our 2nd course (no joke) and this was just our appetizers. The server was also rushing through the menu and not very informative about the pricing of the extra additions such as caviar and truffle. If she was, we would have not ordered 2 orders of truffle and 1 order of caviar. The truffles are $40 each, and I couldn't taste it due to an over amount of salt on each plate, totalling up to an extra $80. The caviar is an extra $60 and a miniscule amount. So with the extra addictions, that totals up to an extra $140 to the bill. When we got the bill, it was around $700. More than twice the amount of just 75/person, and that bill didn't even include tip. I am in the restaurant industry, and I still tipped 20%... Which made my final bill total up to $840... \n\nThe reason for this review is to let you all know before hand that if you're expecting a 75/person meal, don't add extra. It's not worth it. It's a sham and an overpriced upcharge for a small amount. My family dinner was not worth $840. I would have just gone to Pabu or Michael Mina. \n\nHope this was useful.", "author": "Sarah M."}

The menu just did not reflect what the food actually tasted like for the most part, and the food wasn't very delicious.  \n\nThe atmosphere and service, however, was fantastic.  There were lots of people on fancy dates, dressed to the nines and sipping on wine.  I felt a little embarrassed wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but was not treated any differently by the staff for my wardrobe.  Service, in fact, was hospitable and very knowledgable about the food.  The layout is interesting... One communal table in the middle of dining room and lots of booths and standalone tables.  I loved the feel of it... quiet and romantic, warm dark woods, lovely paintings on the wall, twisty light fixtures and sculptures on the ceiling, live plants lined on top of the entryway, and an open kitchen.  Cons: there is one unisex bathroom, and the door stays propped open if opened too far, which was a little distracting on a 50-degree evening, but staff was diligent in closing it promptly.  When my boyfriend and I got up to use the restroom, no one folded our napkins, which generally is the practice of a fine dining establishment, but obviously not a huge deal.\n\nCola was house made, not too carbonated, presented in a glass bottle the size of a Coke glass bottle. Not too sweet and you can taste all the spices used in making it.\n\nDish - Price\n\nSOURDOUGH BREAD WITH HOUSE CULTURED BUTTER - 5\nThey charge for the bread here, and it is worth it to have a warm loaf to nibble on before the food comes out.  Other than that, the bread is not special and it is kind of sad to have to pay for it.\n\nPOTATO-CARAWAY DUMPLINGS, MAITAKE, BRUSSELS, YOGURT -- 15\nThese tasted like browned gnocchis and the caraway was an excellent flavor.  Maitakes were charred perfectly and tasted delicious.  Brussel sprout leaves were also good, but there was a brown sauce drizzled over everything that just tasted like salt to me.  The yogurt was compliment enough to the dish. 4/5\n\nSWEETBREADS, PICKLED SUMMER SQUASH, CHARRED PEPPERS, THYME -- 17\nGetting my boyfriend to like sweetbreads is becoming a losing battle.  I really liked the sweetbreads themselves here because the breading was light and preserved the fatty/cartilaginous texture of the sweetbreads.  I'm not a huge fan of squash, but I think plating the sweetbreads over something pickled was smart. 4/5\n\nPORK LOIN, DELICATA SQUASH, KISHU, FURIKAKE -- 26\nThe pork was ever so slightly tough and was a strange cut, with a small vein of fat running in it.  I personally like the fat, but for those looking for a healthier option, I thought I should note it.  The squash was kind of mushy, and the mandarin oranges didn't make sense to me.  I did not taste any sort of furikake.  Though the pork was cut in large bite size pieces, I would have liked a steak knife to cut it with.  I sawed through my pieces with the knives that were given to us standard. 3/5\n\nMILK-FED LAMB, CABBAGE, QUINCE, SUNCHOKE -- 27\nThe lamb was done in three ways: chops, stuffed, and one other I forgot.  The chops were good, but the stuffed one was very salty and the stuffing overpowered the flavor of the lamb.  The cabbage was overcharred and the sunchoke skin was tough while the inside was very mushy. 3/5\n\nPUMPKIN PARFAIT, PECAN, CORIANDER -- 12\nThis was not at all presented like a parfait.  The pumpkin rectangular semifreddo was topped with an orange zest tulle, with a blot of a strong pecan puree.  I don't really understand why this was billed as a parfait.  We were instructed to take a dab of the pecan puree with each bite of the semifreddo.  It was a weird and not very satisfying dessert. 2/5\n\nCHOCOLATE GANACHE, BLACK CARAMEL, COCOA NIB -- 12\nBlocks of fudge sandwiching a dab of some sort of cream, with a semi-frozen caramel, topped with a sweet cracker.  This dessert was better, but still not great.  It just didn't taste very special, though I have to say the semi-frozen caramel was quite good.  3/5", "author": "Christina G."}

There were tiny edible flowers mixed in, making it a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors that had an amazing taste.\nDuck was surrounded with dots of celeriac & quince, and served  in rare slices that was sprinkled with some dry Maitake mushrooms, which didn't seem to compliment the meat as much as I would have liked.  Odd, I don't remember the grains of Paradise.  I tasted the Pork which had more complex flavors, but was accompanied by potatoes in miso. Kind of a miss I thought.

This was too much for my friend & I- I work in cardiac surgery.\nAlso, the local halibut was outstanding but it was not cooked~ totally fine with me but not if I were pregnant.\nThe servers were super accommodating & took the chicken heart dish away & off of our bill.\nInstead we super enjoyed their house made bread & butter, their local halibut which was fresh, with spot on clean flavors & a little spice.\nWe also enjoyed the trout & park shoulder. The trout melted in your mouth as did the pork shoulder.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-25", "description": "I read many reviews after our experience tonight. If one were to average out reviews of those who gave Aster 4 or fewer stars it would be as follows: nice space, creative menu, over priced, good food that's not too memorable and not deserving of a Michelin star, too small but nicely plated dishes, over-precious and overly confident attitudes, good, attentive but cold service, excellent wine selection and basically they don't care about you. That's pretty much our experience tonight. This coming from people who dine out everywhere in sf all the time and around the world, who absolutely love great food and enjoy a memorable experience. \n\nOur evening began with a lovely hostess taking us to our table and telling us she knew all about us. I had mentioned in the reservation that I don't eat gluten and my husband has a nut allergy and tries to avoid cow milk and cheese. Mind you, we hate this about ourselves but we try to be clear to avoid misunderstandings later and these are merely food intolerances that we try to get out of the way early in the meal. We make up for it by being friendly, appreciative guests, repeat diners and generous tippers. This was not relayed to the waiter so when I told him our limitations he seemed thrown off and angry and told us there wouldn't be much on the menu we can eat. We were made to feel ashamed, not good. We told him we'll do our best to find something that works. He proceeded to describe one of his favorite dishes that he thought we should get, which had a potato pur\u00e9e in it, turns out its actually a Dutch word called Bintje which is a type of potato. My husband who is a Dutch native, got so excited and said, cool! I love bintje, this is actually a Dutch word and I'm Dutch! The American waiter had the nerve to correct his pronunciation of this Dutch word. Actually sir, it's pronounced ----. That was the beginning of the end. \n\nIn addition to our dinner order I asked our waiter to select a great glass of red wine for me. He had quite an attitude and instead of just bringing me something great to try, he went through the fact that every wine was hand selected to pair with each dish, and they take pride in ... blah blah. He seemed a bit defensive. He ended up bringing me a glorious cotes du Rh\u00f4ne and I was a happy camper. After he left my husband still seemed a bit stunned by his pompous attitude. When he came back to our table the waiter knocked over my wine glass and all the wine went flying and splashed all over my husbands new jacket, new sweater and pants and my jacket not to mention all over the table. I felt bad because I encourage him to dress up tonight so he wore his favorite jacket. It was a huge scene with wait staff was super attentive and wiping wine off my husband and off the table, cleaning the floor and moving our jackets away. The whole restaurant was watching and it was a 5 minute ordeal. I was trying to comfort my husband who was not smiling and at this point wanted to leave. Our waiter obviously felt bad and said they would pay for our dry cleaning, and said, if there's anything I can bring you, let me know. But he didn't want to make a fuss. I figured they would comp our wine or bring something special at some point. Right? My wine was obviously replaced because it had been emptied out and I hadn't had any yet. After the B- meal which was beautiful but not at all spectacular, our bill arrived. No discount, no comps. No apology or acknowledgement. Nothing. So tacky. I asked the waitress if she recalled what had happened earlier and mentioned we thought we'd at least get our spilled wine comped. She said the the waiter had replaced my glass of wine and didn't charge for it but only charged for a single glass. I mentioned that the glass had been emptied onto my husbands clothes before I began drinking it. So obviously they wouldn't be charging me for the first glass.\nShe said that since we were only charged for one glass that was the comp. She obviously felt the need to comp our wine glass after leaving the table and returning and realizing that she was being super greedy. But only after the fact. We gave our waiter a full tip and left. Aster needs a major attitude check and an accounting class so they can lower their prices and learn some humility, humor and etiquette.", "author": "Lynn R."}

The bread was pretty amazing, but they charge $5 for bread! WTF?\n\nAnyways, moving on:\n\n+  The cucumber salad is a great and refreshing way to start the meal. Plus, all these flavors worked SOO well together: cherries, preserved meyer lemon, avocado and coriander ($12)\n\n+  Red trout appetizer was SUPER fresh. It's topped off with peach, almonds, chili oil, and basil. It's a great change from most crudo or tartare's out there. Nice touch Aster! I would definitely recommend getting this as an appetizer.\n\n+ Pork Shoulder: Most of the time, pork belly is served because it's easier to cook and has a ton of flavor already. But Aster does a phenomenal job using pork shoulder in this dish. It's tender, yet flavorful, and not dry at all.  Combine it with the sweet potato and broccoli, adds a nice touch to complete the dish.\n\n+ The dumplings were OK. Ummm, I didn't hate it, nor did it like it. Get it if you want to try another take on dumplings.\n\n+ The black cod was my FAV thing here. It's flaky, moist, outfitted with a coat of chard leaves that sits on a thin slice of miso levain, placed in a smoked bone broth, with a hit of lemon. If this dish is still on the menu- you HAVE TO, have to get it!\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nThe ambiance is chill with good music and great service, which is perfect for date night. Every dish we tried was thoughtful, creative and awesomely executed. The prices aren't too ridiculous, but the portions aren't big, so you might find yourself ordering a lot of stuff.\n\nOverall, it's a more than decent place to check out.

The space previously occupied by Beast snd the Hare is so sparsely decorated that despite all the wood, it still feels cold. A long communal table fills the center of the room, while some booths and banquette seating line the walls. Seriously? For this price point diners expect a table of their own.\n\nFrom the start, the menu at Aster insults diners by asking $5 for four thin slices of sourdough bread and house cured butter. This smacks of the \"coperta\" that diners face in Italy. The chicharrones ($8) were heavier than expected, but saved by the red espelette seasoning and charred avocado dip. Wrapped in chard leaves and stems and drenched in smoked bone broth, the black cod ($34) was quite tender, but a little hard to cut. Despite the profusion of somewhat tasteless sun choke, radish, and preserved Meyer lemon, the cold-smoked trout ($17) was good, but lacking in smokiness.\n\nWith only a beer and wine license, there is no full bar. As with everything else at Aster, the wine list is pricey with some glasses breaking the $40 (!!) barrier.\n\nGratuitously expensive even for The City, Aster further escalates the bill with its service-included policy. And, perhaps because of this, service is medicore: polite, but cold; accurate, but not friendly; precise, but somewhat uncaring.\n\nWith his excellent pedigree, Brett Cooper can do better.

The beets were fantastic, but only because they were fresh. I thought the pistachio topping was overwhelmingly salty. \n\n2nd Course:\nChilled Garlic Soup (4 stars) - Although my husband wasn't a huge fan, I loved. It was light and refreshing. Not garlicky as one would think. I thought the fresh herbs, nuts, and peas added texture and complexity without taking away from the base.\nCarrots (4 stars) - Simple yet divine. The toasted coconut added a great crunch to the dish. The black lime puree was also delightful. TBH I could have licked the plate.\n\n3rd Course:\nPork (3 stars) - Although the meat was expertly cooked, I felt that the pairing with the grits and smokey turnips was a bit off. Polenta would have been a much better choice. \nTrout (5 stars) - Trout is a tough customer and well this was just perfect: skin had that crunch and a soft, flaky interior. It paired well with the soured greens. One comment, the pureed nettle didn't add to the palate of the dish.\n\n4th Course:\nVacherin (5 stars) - Wow! Now this is where the Michelin star came from.

We shared the following:\n-Chicharrones\n-Pigs Head Croquettes \n-Delta Asparagus \n-Broccoli and Pork Belly\n-Cold Smoked Trout\n-Poached Rhubarb Pumpkin Seeds Dessert\n\nI was really surprised how much I liked the Delta Asparagus, almost addicting. Broccoli and pork belly was amazing. Hats off to the chef of Pigs Head Croquettes, as its mix of flavors will tickle your taste buds until the cows come home!\n\nFor dessert, I think we had a split opinion about it. I know I enjoyed trying something new, but we weren't sure if there were curry influences on that dish, not my partner's preference. By golly, I still liked it!\n\nIt was an enjoyable early-evening dinner for sure. Great service. Hope to return!", "author": "Garett T."}

Vacherin had it's own forthcomings - the buscuit was hurting the dish by being too dry. However, honey and lavender cream was very much close to perfect and I returned for the one more. Unfortunately, the whole dessert was taken out from menu and replaced by the melon biscuit with cream, where i didn't like neither biscuit, nor melon, nor cream. Texture was not interesting, taste is just good, leaving the potential to be fascinating. I wish cream was lighter, biscuit more Austrian waffle-like, and already presoaked in the melon+sage jus. Also, biscuit everywhere is wished to be warm and cream - colder. But better please return the oat vacherin, just kill the biscuit base there. The crispy walls were just amazing!!\n\nA side note - I don't how to say it better, but the plates leave the feeling of dullness and not always show up the dish.", "author": "Lyuba F."}

The staff was friendly and warm, but gave us plenty of space to enjoy our meal. They played great music, too!\n- The sourdough and cultured butter were 100% worth the cost. The butter was some of the most flavorful that I've ever had.\n- The octopus had a great texture and flavor -- I'd order it again the next time we come!\n- Fresh asparagus with a light, fluffy potato puree (bintje) was unexpectedly delicious.\n- The trout was delicious. Perfectly cooked and paired with crispy artichokes. \n- The frozen chocolate was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Pairing the chocolate mousse and huckleberry with fresh dill was a surprise in the best way possible. \n\nThe one thing they could improve on is that a few of the dishes were a little on the salty side -- particularly the mushrooms and farro.

I have never loved a salad as much as this), chilled green garlic soup (I'm not a fan of cold soup but I loved the raw peas.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-21", "description": "Went for dinner with a couple of friends and the wife. I like to try the new Michelin starred restaurants the year they gets it. It was ok, but not as great as I expected. Definitely in the bottom half of the One star restaurants we tried in SF, and I would even say that I enjoyed some Bib Gourmands as much or even more. \nThe good thing is that the price is reasonable,  the place well decorated and the chef friendly. There were some mistakes you shouldn't see at this level though. More details below. \n\nWe chose the tasting menu, which is basically a choice of 4 dishes for a (slighlty) discounted price compared to a la carte prices. $65 is pretty reasonable, and it is nice to see a pairing at $35.\n\nThe good part: I was pretty happy with my choices\n- Local halibut ($16) was really fresh. Presentation was ok, the fish was perfect. Missed a bit of a kick (some yuzu maybe)? \n- Potato Dumpling ($17) was the most interesting dish on the menu. Never really considered gnocchis as a dumpling, but nice presentation and interesting mix of flavors. \n- Duck ($29) was fine, but too classic. Perfectly cooked (at least mine - more to that later). Presentation was not super creative - especially after the dumplings which were set the same way. The sides were good, but nothing mind-blowing.\n- Peach melba ($12) was probably my choice mistake. Presentation was ok, but it didn't taste like peach at all. It was basically some kind of panna cotta with red fruits coulis. Should have ordered the milk chocolate with basil, which looked way more intriguing. \n- Bread and butter ($5) homemade, small portion but really tasty. \n\nThe less good: \n- Service was a bit snooty. The waitress was not really friendly/natural, but some places like to play it this way.  She was not really helpful, didn't provide suggestions when we were looking for a bottle of wine. A bit too cold for my taste. The chef was warm though.\n- My friends were less enthusiasts about their choices. The soft-cooked egg was apparently nothing special, even though it was the (only) recommendation from our waitress. \n- One plate was named \"lobster mushroom and summer beans with sungold bouillabaisse\". I am really familiar with the bouillabaisse, it's a fish stew from my hometown in a France. What we are not familiar with though is the \"lobster mushroom\", which is a type of mushroom. All my friends ordered it with the assumption it was actual lobster with mushrooms and summer beans, which made total sense with a bouillabaisse sauce. They asked for \"the lobster\" without any mention from our waitress that it was actually a vegetarian dish with a \"lobster mushroom\". Luckily I asked a question which made us aware of this, and my friends all changed their choice for the duck. But they need  to do a better job at explaining the dishes. \n- As mentioned, everyone chose the duck. We got an issue that should not happen in any michelin-starred restaurant: basic cooking consistency. All four ducks arrived at the same time, only 2 were perfectly cooked (including mine). My wife's was blue. My other friend was a bit overcooked. They had to trade their plates to match their preference. That should not happen. \n- 2 of my friends ordered the summer melon with brioche, lemon thyme ($12). The presentation was cool, but this one had a huge issue : the brioche was extremely dry. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but they didn't like it. Brioche should be soft, light - this one tasted like it was a week old. \n-  A small side note, but it would have been nice to have a couple of amuse-bouche or palate cleanser as part of a \"tasting menu\". Especially for a place where you already have to pay for bread. \n\nOverall, it's a 2.5 yelp stars experience for us. I was still debating while writing the review but If I stick solely to my experience, I am giving it 3 stars. My duck was perfectly cooked and my dessert was ok.  Moreover, the price range is fine for what it is. \nBut there is room for improvement.\n\nI don't think I will come back, and wouldn't be overly surprised if they don't retain their star in the next years - It lacked originality, and consistency is a big component.", "author": "Lionel F."}

The servings, while beautifully arranged on the plate, are very, very small. The service, snobbish. Some of the creative dishes work well (aside from their minuscule size that leave you hungry), others look nice on the plate, but barely edible. Be careful re what usually comes for free in high end restaurants, for which Aster will bill enormous amounts (4 half-slices of bread with butter, $5.00, and if you ask for another serving, because after all, the dishes themselves leave you hungry --  it's additional $5.00 for each serving of 2 slices of bread!). Likewise, be careful when the waiter wants to treat you for an additional minuscule dessert, on top of the one you've already chosen -- at high end restaurants such an add on is offered on the house, but here, additional $15.00.

We wanted to go eat at a Michelin rated restaurant and decided upon Aster because as far as Michelin ranked restaurants go, Aster is very affordable.  4 course tasting menu for $75 and wine pairings for $45.  Don't skip the bread, it is divine.  Our first course we had the beef tartare and grilled squash, both very good.  Second course we  had the chanterelles and the soft poached egg.  I thought they were both tasted great, especially the egg.  For our third course we had the hen, which came served as a roulade with what tasted like hen breast meat and a ground forcemeat.  The gooseberry sauce served with the hen was overwhelmingly sweet in my opinion.  The roulade itself was very good.  They paired it with a cider, that wasn't the greatest pairing in my opinion.  I would have rather kept going with a Chardonnay or some other kind of white wine.  The cider came off a little too heavy.  For desert we had the chocolate mousse.  It was piped in a circle and served with what tasted like coconut dumplings and a Carmel ice cream.  This dish was the least pretty all and felt very anti climatic.  The plating was weak and the ice cream was to strong- I felt it could have been creamier.  It's was paired with a vermouth that went great with it though.  The service was fantastic and the staff seemed very friendly.  The music was a little too loud and not to my taste but I'm picky about music anyways.  All in all I do recommend Aster.  The food is great, tasteful, thoughtful and beautifully plated with the exception of the chocolate dish which wasn't bad by any means but just didn't live up to the dishes that proceeded it.  The restaurant space itself is beautiful with an open kitchen.

The only down side to Aster is no cocktail menu. We didn't realize that they didn't serve cocktails until we arrived, so wine pairing it is! I will also say that the music in the restaurant was so loud that when food was delivered to our table - we could not hear any descriptions. We just smiled and nodded. Although these are downers, it does not take away from the food taste and quality.\n\nFirst, we both did the four-course menu which was a great deal and I liked the fact that you could choose one item from each course. I had the smoked albacore appetizer and it was amazing - as a heads up I will be using amazing a lot in this review! The albacore was fresh and the flavors were abundant but cohesive. I could eat it over and over again. \n\nNext I had the potato dumplings - it had the texture of Gnocchi and it was so delicious and rich. If I only knew how they made that! Ugh Amazing. I almost just got up and walked out after that dish because I would have been completely satisfied. \n\nThe trout entree was perfect, and the broth was perfect as well. I would have liked the broth to be just a tad bit warmer since it got cold very quickly. I ate every single bit and the pumpkin dessert was to die for! I did not care for the nut based garnish next to the dessert at all, but the cold sauce and cold yogurt was absolutely perfect. My dinner date did not seem to give the same praise for all of her dishes but she chose the wrong items! She had the chicories, which she loved.

TROUT TROUT TROUT, seriously come for the trout it is actually amazing.  Everything else was good but not memorable. \n\nService-wise, Aster definitely needs help. You are a Michelin rated restaurant, so act like one.

She said we can do that.  \n\nThe food was a mix of disappointments from the guests at the table.  We found the portions to be very small.  They certainly spend the time to make sure the look of each plated course was very well done.  The lamb lacked taste and was over cooked for one guest.  The presentation made it look like duck with three styles of preparation.  While we were waiting for our desert the table next to us asked for their deserts as they had a movie to be at and had to leave.  The waiter who was a bearded man who looked a lot like the chef but could not confirm that told her that \"the deserts are hand made and take time\".  The customer said she asked for them and then said \"get me my check\".  I found him to be rude.  Sad you are sitting eating a desert with the bill in your hand dealing with a credit card in a restaurant while paying so much for the four course ($75.00 per person). At 7 PM we asked that same guy about our deserts and he looked at us and said, \"I can assure you that that no one is standing around\"  and before he walked away he was asked to send the manager over.  He never did.   I asked our waitress at 7 pm to bring us our check when I was waiting at the restroom and she walked out of it..  I told her we are nervous about the time frame at this point.  She never returned to our table nor sent our check.  We asked again to speak to the manager.  No one came.  At 7:13 we asked a male food server (African American) to tell our waitress we needed our check and to send a manager to the table and that we have asked twice before.  At 7:17 Sarah came over with two deserts and said that she heard we were having a time issue.  At this point our mother was fairy upset and refused the deserts.   It was nearly 7:30 by the time we left the restaurant and with $800 in theater tickets we were not pleased.  Sarah apologized and without us asking made an adjustment on the check that was very generous.  Our waitress never did come up and say anything to us at all.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean and had a nice decor.  Our main issue was the lack of professionalism displayed by the bearded waiter/chef?

The restaurant had plenty of seating, so it was okay it seemed.\n\nIt wasn't that crowded at all, so I am very confused as to how the waitress assigned to my table ended up taking the food order of the table 6 inches from me on my left and then, several moments later, taking the drink order of the table on my right without so much as asking me if I was okay, or wanted to order drinks while I was waiting on my friend to arrive.  So, I approached the receptionist after being blatantly ignored by my waitress and made my drink order with the receptionist.  The waitress then came to my table quickly and took my drink order.  I told her I'd have ordered with her, but had failed at getting her attention.  Then, as time progressed, she asked other tables if all was okay and not me.  Had she done so, I would have gotten started by ordering our appetizers so that they would be ready once my brunch date arrived (and to save time).\n\nThe waitress was later replaced, without mention (which is a departure from other fine dining restaurants- usually your waiter/ waitress lets you know).  The replacement was far superior and attentive.\n\nClearly their front-of-the-house staff has varying levels of competency as this point.  At this price point, I don't expect to be waiting ten-fifteen minutes to only get up to make my drink order with the receptionist.\n\nThe duck confit was the star of the show and very well made.  The dessert I chose was unexpectedly good and... healthy.  Too bad so much of my experience was tainted by the poor service from the first waitress.", "author": "Jannah M."}

Four of us went based on finding Aster on a list of the best of SF restaurants.  We arrived at 6:30 and got the best table in the house at the large street-side window.  We went for the prie-fixe and ordered everything on the menu.  The first three courses came at a good pace and were excellent, with special kudos for their duck breast.  But, it then took nearly 45 minutes to get our desserts, which were pretty good, not great.  There was obviously a mixup in the kitchen and at no time were we notified of the delay.  It took a couple of us getting up from the table to finally get the serve.  We were a bit surprised to find that we weren't comped at least a bit for the lousy service. to \n\nWe were ready return when relatives came to town, scheduled for a coup;le of weeks from now.

Not sure why tip is included but not tax - if you're going that route why not to all the way and make it you pay what you see? Maybe because the prices are already inflated?\n\nAgree with the other review that I much preferred sous beurre over here - more comfortable space and ambiance and the price was way cheaper AND included tip and tax.\n\nThe baby kale salad was ok. \nThe croquettes also ok  \nLamb shoulder the other girls liked. \nWe all loved the potato dumplings (also randomly cheapest main). \n\nThe service was mediocre. We were left hanging in situations - after ordering the $5 bread -4 thin slices we didn't have plates to eat them on and had to ask. The place wasn't even busy! There were only a few people at the communal table and maybe 8 other people in the restaurant.

If you're going to do the four course meal, everyone at the table has to do it, but each person can pick whichever dishes they want. The homemade sourdough with butter was so comforting and good, the bread warm and the salted butter melted on top. Definitely worth getting. The cold starters were 5 stars. The salad was beautifully plated and delicious, the smoked albacore was a highlight, and the beets were also fantastic. All the plating was gorgeous. The hot appetizers (second course) was also delicious. The potato dumplings were my favorite dish of the night. The main courses were creative and incredibly tasty.

The hostess was very real and cool (tatted) and she sat us right behind her on the communal table. \n\nThe menu's set up to encourage a four course menu which we were down to try, but did have some reservations. The server was friendly, approachable, answered all of our questions and  we decided to do the menu. \n\nFirst course came out fairly quickly and the portions are fair (five beets in a large bowl, plate of bay scallops covering one side and chicories), but as we wanted to share everything, it created an unnecessary tension among us to withhold from truly enjoying each dish. Plus, the flavor are striving for complexity, but are bland. From that course onward, the timing became very lengthy and the wait was the norm. \n\nIn the second course, the egg was spectacular and was the true standout of the night food-wise. Again, waiting for small courses is a net negative. \n\nWe practiced patience through the rest of the meal, but as each dish is dropped, the runner explains every component of the dish and it becomes a bit invasive after a while. I wish they wouldn't have interrupted us. Read your guests. \n\nThe food is fine. The story is fascinating, but each dish is treated too precious to enjoy; instead, you spend energy trying to preserve the dish's components and less time satisfying yourself. With the emphasis on food, it seems they are missing some major connections to nourishment. I want to eat something that taste good, inspires conversation with my friends and creates a memorable feeling. This food is overthought, smaller and makes me question if I'm getting enough. \n\nThe atmosphere is sweet. It's romantic, darker setting. The mirrors make it appear far bigger than it is (nice touch). \n\nThe price is moderate in SF, but the overall experience was underwhelming. \n\nI think this is the kind of place that you'll go to once, maybe twice (for a special occasion), but you'd never visit regularly because the price point is higher for less. I appreciate the service and the ambiance, but would invite them to quit trying too hard with the food.

The restaurant features dark wood furniture, artwork on the walls, and an open kitchen that looks over the restaurant.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good, although I personally preferred the small plates over the large one I tasted.\n\nMy favorite dish was the smoked trout: the lightly smoked fish, the radish, the sun chokes, and the preserved meyer complimented one another well and left me wanting more. The asparagus with ham hock and egg yolk was also a good mix of flavors. The pig head croquettes are worth trying; I don't think I'd want the croquettes by themselves but they pair really well with the mandarin kosho on top.\n\nI was a little disappointed by the lamb shoulder.

Why do places make their guests less comfortable than they might be?  Common sense and hospitality should be a rule.\n\nHowever, the food was really good.  Golden beet soup came with mussels, pistachio crumble and dill.  While the mussels were a bit lost in the mix, this was a perfectly astringent plate that wakened the appetite.\n\nPotato caraway dumplings with maitake mushrooms, brussels sprouts and yogurt was perfectly balanced and perfectly wonderful.  Some version of this should be on the menu always.\n\nTrout with grapes, tokyo turnips, charred scallions and brown butter was another big winner.

It's menu changes quite often so it is hard for me to tell you which dishes to try. However, what I will say is that the 4-course meal I had was generally pretty good. I started with a salad of wildflowers and greens, which was actually quite amazing. This was followed by an octopus dish, which was pretty good. My entr\u00e9e of lamb was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. The lamb was cooked three ways; however, I couldn't really taste the meat because it was overly marinated with other flavors. Last, I had a very yummy ice cream for dessert. The atmosphere of Astor is like many restaurants, but what makes it stand out is the service. My glass of water was always full, and there was always someone close by to answer any questions or to take drink orders. It was very impressive. As for the price, it was also fairly reasonable.

They took care of it very graciously and we appreciated that.\n\nThe only other comment I have about the food is that the portion sizes are VERY small - and, the entree sizes are barely bigger than the starters.

I was able to book a table same day (Wednesday) without a problem, and we were seated promptly. Each of us got the 4-course tasting menu, which is priced at $59 and I thought a reasonable price, although definitely a splurge for a Wednesday. I got the following:\nEarly Girl Tomato dish with figs and ricotta: 4.5 stars, one of my favorites of the night! The dish had a slightly sweet tone to it, and tasted very fresh. \nSoft-cooked egg: 4-stars, very good and a bit more savory, although I felt by the end of the dish a bit bored with the flavor. Overall very enjoyable. \nTrout: 4 stars, nicely balanced with the snap peas.\nSummer melon brioche: 2 stars. I was disappointed with my dessert, I was hoping more melon flavor would shine through, but apart from a few cubes of melon on top, it just tasted like plain brioche. I think this dish needs to be reworked--it is not bad, but I found it uninspired and boring. My friend got the Chocolate Custard instead, and I think she chose better. I had a bite of hers, and wish I had ordered that instead. :(   \nService was good, but didn't have any personal touches that I would associate with a 1-star Michelin restaurant.

After sitting on my hands for a couple years I finally went here for the first time and I was really pleased on what I found and kicked myself a bit for not coming sooner. \n\nWe dined here late on a weekday so it wasn't terribly busy when we arrived. I noticed everyone was sat on one side of the dining room on two tops and the left side had a bunch of empty booths.  I really hate it when restaurants seat you among the crowd of people rather than comfortably seating you in more than available booths. Aster did not add to my hate. So right out the gate they were off the a great start especially because my friend and I expressed how comfortable with thought the booths were.  I'm a huge fan of clean stylish bathrooms and Aster is right up there. The room itself is well lit and beautifully designed. Loved the art work and the lighting throughout the restaurant. It all paired nicely with the large windows that looked out to the neighborhood around us. I could see myself dining here alone as much as I could with a friend or a group. \n\nThe best reason to dine here aside from the food is the value.  It's one of the best deals around to have 4 courses for 59 dollars.  Only Trestle can boast a better deal in my opinion. The food here was a touch better for me and I especially liked that we could mix and match so we weren't each forced to have our own courses (there were 2 of us). We were able to try 8 different courses and none of them disappointed our palettes. They went well with the wine our server suggested us.  The bread and the homemade butter here is amazing and we were even gifted a loaf as we were the last customer out the door.  A very nice gesture on their part which added to the really great service we received. I don't recall the details of the meal but that often happens to me. Like when I watch great comedy I just remember the laughing and rarely can recall the jokes. A good meal does that too. I know my stomach was a happy camper that night I just can't tell you why.

We were finally sat 30 minutes past our reservation time without more than a cursory apology.  Once we sat down we were given a special Valentine's Day menu- this was not mentioned online, on the reservations page or when we confirmed the reservation over the phone.  This led to a dinner that was literally twice as expensive as planned and felt like a complete waste of money.  While we were looking forward to Aster I doubt we'll be back soon given the lack of respect for people's time.

I and my four girl friends went to Aster for celebrating my friend's birthday on Saturday. We spent about $500 for dinner. If I spend $500 dinner, I will expect descent treatment from the restaurant crew. We are all foodies who go to different restaurants very frequently. Funny thing is a wait person for our table provided us an excellent service, but I experienced horrible attitude from a manager of the restaurant. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, four main dishes, and two bottles of wine to start. A partial appetizers came out pretty fast, so we were enjoying wine and food together, and a lady(we didn't know she was a manger at that time) brought out the second last appetizer. Our side plates had already been used for other appetizers, so we asked her if she could bring us extra small side plates. Then she pointed out the side plate that we were alread using on the table, and said this is the small plate you should use, why do you need extra plates for? She asked us twice the reason why we needed to have extra plates, so we had to explain that it was because the side plates had already been used for a few appetizers, so we just want to clean plates. I thought she was already being really rude at that point, but she countinued to show her rudeness. She put down the dish that she was holding while we were asking for extra plates and gave us the name of dish and a brief description. However, we noticed that it wasn't what we had ordered, so we told her politely that we didn't order the dish. Her face expression was like she was so annoyed by us as if we ordered the dish but we were claiming that we didn't order. Without saying any word, she just snatched the wrong dish and walked away. We were pretty bothered by her attitude, but I didn't want to make a scene at that point because we were celebrating birthday. However, I don't think she should have reacted the way she did on Saturday when we didn't demand any kind of unreasonable request to her or to the restaurant. I'm so surprised that a so called 'high-end restaurant' that obtained Michelin star provides such an unpleasant experience to its customer.", "author": "Julie P."}

I had beets (on a bed of cultured cream and pistachio), potato dumplings, black cod, and cheese (contralto); while he had spring greens, potato dumplings, spiced duck, and chocolate tart. The beets were really really fresh and tasty - toasted pistatchios added a lovely texture. The potato dumplings with hint of comte and caramelisation were warm and hearty - although I felt like there was too much happening on the plate with added maitake, brussels, rye crumbs, and dill. I think they could have shown a little restraint, but it was nevertheless a good dish. The cod came in a gentle broth (charred allium - but tasted more like a dashi), and was just what I needed on a rainy evening. The star of the evening however, was the duck - perfectly pink and seasoned. I would return just to have the duck again (and again). The tart was served with caramel ice-cream and dark chocolate shortbread crumbs - to die for. \n\nService was attentive but never stuffy. Each course was well-timed so we didn't have to wait long between dishes; but also didn't feel rushed. \n\nWhat I love most about Aster is its authenticity.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-06", "description": "Aster was this month's restaurant of our Dinner Club -- probably my least favorite of the 8 places we've been to*\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the price doesn't match what you get -- and we went knowing it was a little pricey. But usually something makes up for that: out of this world food, amazing service, beautiful decor. Maybe it was our uptight server -- he didn't get us & we didn't get him. By the 4th bottle of wine, he finally got us ...\n\nThe food was A-OK (hence three stars) but nothing really stood out and it certainly wasn't worth the price. It's New California cuisine -- but nothing was surprisingly harmonious or deliciously daring. It was a strange bunch of mish-mash, a few dots of this & that. The most flavorful dish we got was the green garlic soup. And yes, we finally ordered the $5 bread -- mostly to satiate our hunger, which wasn't going to be satisfied by the meager portions of food and tiny dots of flavor.\n\nMaybe it was because my best experience had been at the most recently attended Central Kitchen, where everything was flawless, so Aster greatly paled in comparison. Or maybe they haven't found their voice yet. Our hostess was really nice and the other servers seemed to do better with their tables. \n\nThe one highlight is they let us linger for a long time and drink our wine....\n\n\n* (1601 Bar & Kitchen http://www.yelp.com/biz/1601-bar-and-kitchen-san-francisco; Seven Hills http://www.yelp.com/biz/seven-hills-san-francisco; Kin Khao http://www.yelp.com/biz/kin-khao-san-francisco-2; Beso http://www.yelp.com/biz/beso-bistronomia-san-francisco-4; Prubechu http://www.yelp.com/biz/prubechu-san-francisco; Stones Throw http://www.yelp.com/biz/stones-throw-san-francisco-2; Central Kitchen http://www.yelp.com/biz/central-kitchen-san-francisco).", "author": "Yasi S."}

The sun happened to be be right in  our eyes where they seated us.  I asked if we could move over one spot (as the entire table was empty).  Our server had to check with a bunch of folks until someone finally came over and said, we were able to move.  We had the four courses, the salad was AMAZING!   The appetizer was okay and the main course was bland.  I asked for hot sauce and was notified that \"the chef does not like the flavors of the dishes changed\".  I asked for chili flakes and was also denied.  To me, this is poor customer service and arrogance/ego.  An evening out is meant to be enjoyed and lighthearted. This place was arrogant and stressful to diner.

I also found the menu to be very vegetarian heavy, especially considering the prices.\nThe first thing that really annoyed me was the bread, it was decent but there was not enough butter for the amount, but the thing that really chapped my ass was that there were 5 of us, as we've already covered earlier, and they gave us 4 pieces of bread,  I find that incredibly chintzy, come on people it's bread and you're probably marking it up 70%, put on an extra bloody slice.\nService was INCREDIBLY slow, almost 3 hours for 4 courses, too long for a Tuesday night supper.\nI found the menu to be a little off, seasonally speaking, it was mid October and I was still seeing things like Early Girl tomatoes, summer squash and blackberries on the menu.\nMost of the food we ordered was alright, but portions were small and no ones socks were being blown off, and there were definitely a number of fails, notably the kabocha squash second course dish was very strange and none of the flavors on the plate meshed. My mother in laws pork entree was also a miss,the pork  tasted bitter and overly salty, I suspect because of the brining liquid.\nI ordered the duck which was cooked well but everything else on the plate was freezing cold, including the actual plate. I sent it back to the kitchen and when I got it back 5 minutes later it had been replated sloppily and the garnishes were still very cold and unfortunately by this point so was the duck. Epic fail.\nI'm glad I ordered the cheese plate for my dessert course as it was the best option, between us we tried all the offerings and we found all of them to be subpar, my cheese was good but the cracker it was served with was stale.\nAs I already mentioned it's a real head scratcher to me how this place has been given a Michelin star, maybe we were there on a bad night but a restaurant of this supposed caliber shouldn't really have those...\nWill not be back.", "author": "Leal L."}

Good.\n\nNight of the dinner, we are seated right away. The server seems somewhat knowledgeable of the menu and wine list, but had to go an ask someone else on a few occasions, when we asked a harder one like...this glass of Riesling for $42, how much is the bottle...ten minutes later that bottle is $150. Okay, so we order a bottle of Pinot for the same price. Oh and there are only THREE cocktails on the menu, which is why we went with wine. So if you are a cocktails person, do not attempt to come here.\n\nThe menu itself is pretty limited. It is designed for four courses. I don't count the $5 bread and butter as a course. Each person is recommended to order one from each section. Pricing per plate per section per person runs about $20. Times four, you do the math.\n\nI ordered the halibut appetizer, garlic soup and potato dumplings as my main dish. Originally I wanted the trout, but then the server mumbled something about they only had three fish left and it might not be fresh....hmm not fresh seafood no thanks! I decided not to risk it and went vegetarian. \n\nThe halibut was delicious. Presentation was very nice. When they bring out each course, someone comes by and tells you what's in it, the sauce, etc. The soup was alright, not too garlicky as promised. The potatoes were not good. Oily and hard to chew. \n\nWe ordered four different desserts to share, and boy, was that the worst!

Although I too balked at the $5.00 price, it was well worth it.  The prix fixe menu is really worth every penny.  I can't wait to go back to see thier\nnext menu.", "author": "Helen S."}

Seasonal vegetables were fresh and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe service is still working out some kinks, but glad we got in here before it becomes impossibly packed -- as it certainly will. That will bring it up to 5 stars. \n\nMaybe a bit gratuitously expensive, as are many new San Francisco places (do they really need to charge for bread and butter?), but I really appreciate the service-included policy and hope it catches on.

After only four months in, they seem to have settled into the neighborhood quite well-- the place was bustling with patrons on a Thursday evening.\n\nThe key is indulging in their four course meal for $59/person, and bring at least four people. If you wanted to, you could all easily taste the entire menu. My group, due to various dining restrictions, ordered without the intention of much sharing and still enjoyed four courses. The first course are cold, salad-type entrees. I had the Cucumber served with blackberry, avocado cream and coriander flowers. Others found the coriander overpowering, but I thought it was a complex flavor on top of fresh cucumber. Next came their black pepper dumplings-- which our waitress informed was something they were known for. This was my favorite savory bite of the night-- the spice of the pepper was calmed by the yogurt and peas served along it. My main course was the farro, served with sungold tomatoes and topped with crispy kale. The great thing about Aster is the servers take the time to explain every dish, proving that they studied and know the menu well. She informed me to eat from the center, as there was an herb sauce that made each bite brighter.\n\nOf course, the final course was dessert, and most of my party couldn't say no to the chocolate ganache. Served with edible flowers and and small cocoa crisp, it was the perfect indulgence without being overly rich.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, featuring many European and American wines. If wine is not your deal, there are a few beers-- but cocktails are not available. \n\nI will say, the plating and ambiance was another highlight, aside from the various tastes. The kitchen is an open focal point, giving pretty much any seat a view to the chefs. The plating was delicate, which, is to also say, the dishes were on the small side. Still, I can't say I left hungry, but if you're looking for something gut-busting, you'll be disappointed. But, if you're looking for creative combinations and a thoughtful approach to presentation, you'll enjoy Aster.", "author": "Bryan B."}

I like what they've done with the decor particularly along the ceiling, and it really lightens and opens up the place.\n\nThey have a beer and wine license only with some glasses going into the $40 range, but they had a pretty good variety of wines by the glass from both Europe and America.\n\nAs the 5 of us were resuming our \"dinner club,\" we went with one of everything on the menu (our usual), minus the trout and soup (as appealing as green garlic soup sounded, it's hard to share).\n\nBites: \n- Sourdough: fresh bread that's light and and chewy inside, served with house cultured butter. I actually used the bread to soak up the remaining miso from the radish dish, which I thought was a better use for it\n- Miso marinated pickled radish: everyone at the table wanted to skip this one (except me!), and it ended up being well liked - it's slightly pickled with a hint of miso richness\n- Chicharrones: not as light as I expected and slightly stale in texture. The seasoning on it is really nice, though, with the red espelette powder.  What made the dish was the charred avocado dip, which was smooth and like a more refined version of guacamole (minus onions, tomato)\n\nSmall plates: \n- Pig head croquettes: definitely eat these warm. As you would expect, they're quite tender and soft on the inside, crisped outside, but I don't love head meat); the sliced kumquats help to cut some of the heaviness\n- Young lettuces: good dressing but a little too heavily dressed for me. The leaves were tender, but the highlights were the pickled beets and the shaved and crisped carrots on top\n- Delta asparagus: I can't resist anything that has an egg on it, but it ended up being a dish sitting in a pool of egg yolk, which did the job for richness. The asparagus was ridiculously tender, and it still stood up well to the ham hock (I was scooping up every last bit of that). I could have used another of this dish\n\nLarger plates: \n- Potato black pepper dumplings: I had read about the nettle ones, but I know nettles are fleeting in their season. These dumplings were the favorite of the larger plates and possibly an overall favorite.  They are nicely seared outside with a softer texture inside, but it still had bite. The accompaniments made the dish: roasted tender turnips, spring peas (not as sweet I would expect for this time of year?), maitake mushrooms (love these!). This is definitely a must-get and doesn't feel like a vegetarian dish at all\n- Black cod: a close contender for the second favorite. The cod is super tender, but the highlight is this smoked bone broth underneath and the crouton that soaks up all the juice. The chard leaf it's wrapped in makes it a little harder to cut, but the stems were really nice in the broth below. Definitely eat this one with a spoon and don't miss this dish\n- Pork shoulder: a little richer and a little more standard in flavors, but the smooth new potato, rhubarb, and grilled broccoli were nice\n- Dry age beef: medium rare and sliced, so it's easy to share. The beef texture was good, but flavor wasn't amazing. What was amazing, though, was the green farro and pioppini mushroom porridge underneath that had amazingly rich flavors and good texture (I usually do NOT like farro)\n\nDesserts:\n- Poached rhubarb: we debated over this but were curious. The rhubarb was diced up, cooked down a little, and tart in flavor. It sat on a white creamier thing underneath (forgot what it was) and was unique, but not sure I would order it again\n- Beet and cara cara orange cremeux: not everyone loves beets, but I actually really like the subtle beet flavor and smooth texture. Some people thought the beet was a little too strong, but the cara caras really help balance it out\n- Frozen chocolate: probably the favorite dessert. The center is like a frozen rectangle of chocolate ice cream or semifreddo, but the mandarin oranges, cocoa nib, and mostly, the basil, really make the dish. I loved the basil with chocolate and have never thought to pair the two since you usually just see mint with chocolate\n\nFood came out at a reasonable pace, and they never rushed us even though we definitely took our time getting started.  My main complaint is that I wish the sizes of the dishes were larger.\n\nWhen they first opened, the restaurant started out with 18% gratuity included in the prices, but they said it didn't go over well with people, so now your check does NOT include gratuity.  In the end, with 2 bottles of reds (we went for the less expensive ones) and after adding gratuity, it was around $90 a person.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I say experience because the food was good, tasty and refined, though on the small side.  It was the actual experience of eating there that was lacking.  \n\nTo not go into too many details,  here's a list of downfalls with service on our slowish night with about 1/4 of the tables empty.  Our server was unsure on how to explain a potato dumpling dish, offering \"enjoyable\" as a description (I suggested gnocchi and he agreed).  We waited a good 3 minutes after getting our pork dish to flag someone down, who ended up being the host, to get knives so we could start eating.  Our drinks were empty half way through the meal and stayed that way, on the table, until we left at the end of the meal.  And, not once did anyone do a quality check to see how things were going for us.  \n\nBecause they are adopting a new tipping format where gratuity is included (which I'm totally down for), these problems that usually wouldn't make me want to follow up with them did.  This wasn't just poor service.  With service included in the price, it was horrible.  \n\nI wrote directly to Aster letting them know what my experience was, not wanting to add a rating on yelp, but rather have them address it.  All I asked for was a response.  I submitted my words on their website template and I have never heard anything back from them.  This tells me that the lack of communication, attention to detail and service from our waiter that was actually apart of their FOH model and how things are run here.  I left hungry, dissatisfied and, to be honest, a little taken advantage of and with the last slap from their management, there are so many other restaurants I'm excited to dine at.", "author": "Tucker X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-14", "description": "When I go to a restaurant within a month of it opening, I expect a few flaws in execution and service. Acclimating to a new kitchen and new menu, and cooking with people you haven't cooked with before is inherently challenging. So the experience I had at Aster just a week after it opened was all the more impressive. \n\nThe two of us ordered:\n--Bread and butter (delicious)\n--Croquettes (Light but meaty, and just delicious -- though I thought the mandarin kosho was a bit too sweet and too much, so i scraped a bit of it off)\n--Kale salad (best in SF -- tender baby kale, perfectly dressed, and the crispy, flavorful carrots just set it off)\n--Ham Hock (flavors were on point but asparagus was a bit over)\n--Pork loin (perfectly cooked, incredibly tender, and interestingly paired with flavors and textures that all came together well. Nothing on the plate would \"wow\" you by itself, but everything came together really nicely)\n\nThen we had the strawberry dessert and it just sent everything over the top. Sorry for getting a bit wordy here, but I spend most of my money on food for two reasons: first, to experience new flavors and new sensations that only a great chef can really bring out. And second, to have old flavors I've tasted countless times before elevated to a new level. This dessert was an example of the latter. There was nothing really special about the ingredients themselves (though the strawberry flavor in several components of the dish was damn good), but eating it brought me so much happiness, I was glad we were the last ones in the restaurant. I made noises. And it's very rare that sweet trumps savory for me. \n\nAnyway, if this were a restaurant that were two years old, I would probably be right between four and five stars. But after so many underwhelming meals at new restaurants that turned out great just a few months down the road, I have to give Aster a five, and just express my excitement at where this team might go if they continue to improve upon what they're already doing.", "author": "Jeremy H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-11", "description": "$30 dollar entrees in the Mission. There is just something so odd about that to anyone who has lived in SF for more than a decade. Aster is the kind of restuarant that would have been in another neighborhood a decade ago or even five years ago. While the decor and service were casual enough, the prices and food was far more Fidi or Marina.\n\nTip is included in the price but surprisingly not tax and you would be hard pressed to leave here without spending at least 50 a person. Even with just one entree per person it would be 30 a person. The server recommended we EACH do one plate from each of the four courses which would have been around 100 a person which puts this out of the daily dinner rotation. The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. \n\nWe did end up getting 2 small bites, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert as well as a dish they accidentally prepared for us and we didn't pay for. We also had two bottle of sparkling water at 7 dollar a bottle. Total came to $140 including tax.\n\nIt's still 4 stars because the food was good, really good. The flavours were all there in every dish. The bread that was present in so many dishes was just as good as I remembered it at Outerlands. The food was interesting without being flavourless or too precious. \n\nWe started with\n\n1. bread ($4) which is considered a small bite which is just odd and a practice I despise. But it's delicious bread that we kept and used throughout our meal.\n\n2. Pig Croquettes $6 which are very soft with gelatinous pig cheeks inside a crisp shell. If you are expecting more a fritter texture avoid these. I enjoyed them and 4 is the right amount for this rich meat bonbon.\n\n3.The cold smoked trout ($17) was very light on the smoke and a rather small dish for the price. I couldn't help but compare it unfavourably to the smoked trout at Al's Place that was cheaper and better tasting. The dish was enjoyable with all the flavours you'd expect in a Scandinavian inspired dish.\n\n4. Green Garlic soup, olive oil crouton, pickled fennel, lemon  ($14) as good as any we've eaten in the spring in the south of France this dish was a hit with the French Spouse who felt strongly it needed a poached egg on top.\n\n5. Black Pepper-Potato Dumpling entr\u00e9e ($27) had a nice combination of flavours for me but I felt there wasn't the right portion of starch to vegetables. The French Spouse loved the dish and the gnocchi like tiny dumplings. \n\n6.Black cod. chard leaves and pickled stems, miso levain, smoked cod broth (34) This was beautiful dish with amazing vibrant flavours, delicate fish and a broth I would have loved to drink by the cup. It was also a rather small piece of fish for $34.\n\n7.Strawberry vanilla, cultured cream, chamomile ($12) This was simply a deconstructed strawberry sponge cake. It tasted good but was in no way at the same level as the savory dishes and 12 for dessert needs to be something more than that.\n\nWe also were given delta asparagus ham hock, alliums, egg yolk ($16) which we did not order and were not charged for. It was tasty but not memorable.\n\nI get a little sick of restaurants that spend more on the decor than they do on the food but I loved the decor here. No freaking wood on the walls and they actually soundproofed the entire ceiling. They had a very simple to make but highly creative lighting system on custom metal channels and with the use of mirrors and a black ceiling really expanded the space while keep the sound baffling. They used soft fabrics on the long banquets and burlap on the walls. The huge problem with the decor is having a door that doesn't close and clientele that are so clueless or entitled that they can't seem to close the door. Do not sit near the door or you will be cold from the door constantly being open. The reception person was oblivious to it with other servers and patrons having to close it as she just stood there. I am not sure how a wheelchair can access the space with narrow double door unless the second door is unlocked and the aisles are narrow. Walk-ins were seated at the huge communal table which is not wheelchair accessible. The tables are very close together and we got to hear all about how the table next to us was evicting people from the Mission building they just bought and how hard it is to find good contractors in the city. That kind of sums up the patrons here.  \n\nWith the influx of tech money in the Mission who also go out for every meal and the national level attention Brent Cooper already has this place will be popular. For a DPG restaurant this is far better than Alta CA but targeting the exact same demographic and it succeeds at that.\n\nI would love to come and try more of the menu but with delicious and cheaper places like Al's Place so close by, it will be a while before I return.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

(I wish I could do 3.5 stars...)\n\nI liked the layout and decor of the space, and the service was outstanding. Our server was really friendly and super sweet (side note on the guy who sort of bombarded us with a wine recommendation: 1. we had literally just opened the wine list when he came over, 2. he was sort of aggressive about recommending a very expensive bottle of wine...idk that sort of bugged me, but whatever, it's a personal thing I think). \n\nOur food was very good. We got the porchetta, which I would skip because it was just...fine, and the green garlic soup which I LOVED. It was beautiful - the color, the texture, the super intense flavor, I highly recommend the green garlic soup. \n\nFor entrees we got the black cod  and the spring lamb with farro. Both were very good, but I wouldn't call either of them great. The cod was the better of the two - the fish was wrapped in swiss chard, on top of a large crouton in a bowl of bone broth. While it was seriously delicious, and the fish perfectly cooked, it was sort of difficult to eat! The chard and crouton were neat impossible to cut through and so the whole thing was messy to eat. The spring lamb was also cooked extremely well -- perfect temperature really, but everything on the dish was very sweet - the way the lamb was seasoned, the farro, even the mushrooms...we both would've preferred them to tone down on the sweet and up the savory. \n\nWe also got two deserts - both of which I recommend: the frozen chocolate and the cheese plate.\n\nOverall our meal was good, the service was even better, and I would likely go back. I will note that I feel like Aster is a bit expensive/overpriced for what it is.", "author": "Anna S."}

Specifically asked if it was required that entire party had to have the 4 course menu. The person put me on hold so she could check with the manager. She gets back on phone and was told that we could order a la carte and not required to do 4 course menu. \nWhen we got there, we ordered a la carte and then the server comes back & says that \"management\" requires that the entire table orders the 4 course menu! Server was totally rude, muttering \" I really don't like being put in these situations\" (as if we purposely put him in this awkward situation).\nWhy would I agree to a 4 course long and drawn out dinner with 2 kids?! I never would've agreed to that when I made the reservations over the phone. \nManagement and service needs to get their act together. I will definitely not go back and I have told all my friends not to try this so called Michelin Star restaurant!", "author": "De C."}

Aster plays on really fresh, bright flavors, and interesting combinations of ingredients and textures. (sound familiar?) It was however a pleasure to dine there, and there are a couple dishes I would definitely revisit if I went back.\n\nThe standouts from our meal were the beet soup with mussels, pistachios and tiny crunchy squid ink croutons, and the potato black pepper dumplings. The other savory dishes were good, but not in the same league as that ridiculously delicious soup.\n\nThe desserts were disappointing. We had the poached pluot dish and the melon dish, and each tried too hard, having an ingredient that overwhelmed the subtle flavors of the rest of the dish. Those pluots with lemon verbena were perfection on their own; the strong cashew butter overpowered their delicate flavor. Ditto for the sesame in the melon dish.\n\nMore likely a place I'd revisit for a couple appetizers with a glass of wine than for a full meal.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

It was nice but very overpriced and not really memorable for that money you pay. I dont even remember what I had to be honest... But we do love to have a place across from us with the \"fancy\" food that attract people from all around... Yesterday 12/10/2016 we had reservation for 7.30pm and upon our arrival we were informed our table is not ready and wont be for the next 20 minutes. The host made impression she actually does not care about that and was not even pretending she feels sorry for our party - which our guests felt immediately. The table was ready after 50 minutes or so but at this point we choose Tuba where they always welcome you and find you a space. I don't know what to say... Maybe to be more friendly? If I want to go to a fancy place with overpriced food at least I will choose a place with a nicer decor and where I can dress my fancy clothes. This place looks very casual and more like some coffee bar or co-op place which is perfectly fine with me - don't take me wrong! I am tired of \"stuffy\" places and love the fact I can dress down and make jokes with the staff! But if you want to give me an attitude like some upscaled restaurants and give me \"the look\" - than get your valet service, change the interior and slightly improve your cuisine for that price you are charging... the restaurant also report us to Open Table as No Show... I forgot to mentioned that... so sad", "author": "Monika K."}

I am a big proponent of this idea and believe that diners should pay a fixed price for their dinner, like in Japan and France.  To me, great service is expected and should be part of the job and the price should not fluctuate with each meal I have at the same restaurant.  Keeping this brief....I was completely caught by surprise and disappointed to find out the restaurant had decided to revert on this decision to have all-inclusive menu pricing.  (At almost $40 for my smallish beef entree, I really could not tell that it was not all-inclusive).  I really wanted to like Aster, but all-inclusive menu aside, while the food was not bad (we tried 85% of the menu), and the service was attentive, there are so many other good restaurants in SF.", "author": "Stella A."}
