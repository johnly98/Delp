It definitely isn't the biggest bar, but it still has a good vibe. Drinks are good and reasonably priced. I've been only twice and got the fire bowl both times. The first time I got raspberry and the second time I got peach. Both very delicious and you can still really taste the alcohol!\n\nThe one thing I really wanted to point out though from the first time I went is about the bartender. I understand that it's super slow and it may be boring, but it's unacceptable to be on your phone the ENTIRE time. On top of that she was eating a full meal behind the bar; never in my life I've ever seen a bartender eat their dinner behind the bar even on a slow night. Literally the biggest turn off. Every time I'd go up to her for another drink, she just looked like she did not want to help me. She didn't even greet me and my significant other when we walked in. All she said was \"I need to see your ID's\" okay hi I'm good how are you?! I never caught her name but she has tattoos on her arms.\n\nThe second time I went though the bartender was really sweet. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name but I hope to run into her again next time. Still giving this place 5 stars because of the service from the second time, drinks are good, and the place itself gives off a good vibe.", "author": "Kanella G."}

I took my brother out for a bday dinner at House of Prime Rib and we decided to stop by this bar.  Came here at about 8pm Sunday night.  The vibe was super chill.  The bartender working that night Kathy was super chill and kept checking up on us.  \n\nThe coolest thing about this bar is that if you have a group of friends there are areas that have couches.  There's a room upstairs and one by the vending machine.   They also have a couple of games that are pretty fun.  My most favorite thing about this bar is that they have a music machine where if you put a dollar you can choose a song you want to play.  \n\nI've had a couple of their drinks before, the fire bowl is a super cool experience.  Blended drink lit with fire in the middle (wayyyy cool)!!!  I'm also pretty basic sometimes, a shot of grey goose is always good!  :).

They have many flavors to choose from and even allow you to combine them, so we got the Strawberry Mango mix. Between two people, we actually finished the entire bowl even though it was a serious struggle. It's a fun experience for groups with a huge punch bowl of alcohol and seeing your drink get lit on fire. Despite that, the taste was so sweet and full of alcohol flavor. It took me back to my college days drinking AMFs to get as drunk as possible for as cheap as possible.\n\nWe later tried adding in some extra tequila to make it taste less sweet, but don't think it helped that much. So next thought was to just get extra shots on its own, which was cheap at only $5.\n\nI was getting pretty buzzed from the drink from there and needed something tasty. Good thing they have a vending machine for some drunchies. I got myself a small bag of hot fries chips for $1 to recover from the Fire Bowl. This was definitely more of a locals type of spot with the bartender chatting it up with everyone at the bar.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

This place has a menu so you aren't lost in sauce when you decide to order your drink, I must warn you that these drinks are sweet AF in other words they will creep up on you. \n\nYesterday I ordered the zombie because my tolerance has been high and I needed a alcoholic beverage that's a little stronger then the usual fruity drinks here & it was very satisfying the drink had 4 types of rum and I think pineapple juice. \n\nWhen it comes to the venue there are tables against the wall and some games in the back as well as some board games in the front.\n\nTwo restrooms in the back which are for both sexes I don't know if I can agree to that idea only because guys pee standing and I wouldn't trust a drunk guy peeing in the right direction after a few drinks. \n\nAlso there are no appetizers offered at this location but there's a restaurant next door where they allow you to order take out and bring into the bar to munch on. \n\nParking is easy to find and it's in a well lit location but because San Francisco car theft is on the rise I recommend you take all your belongings and place it in the trunk. \n\nOverall with my experience here i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good positive vibe with good people and friendly bartenders who attend to you when you need a drink ASAP.", "author": "Marilyn A."}

Since we came on a Wednesday and are on grad student budgets, we got the fire bowl and chose the pina colada flavor.  Although the flame wasn't as impressively flashy as those at Smuggler's Cove (meh... that's for tourists and people with an objective of getting likes on Instagram/Vine videos rather than the actual bar experience), I think it tasted better: Smuggler's Cove just tastes like straight up Jamba Juice, while at Tiki Haven is alcoholic Jamba Juice.", "author": "Edna C."}

Lots of parking and you can get late night food from the Korean restaurant next door or the Chinese restaurant across the street.  Also cute Asian bartenders who are super friendly.  I don't get to come here or the other similar Sunset Asian bars (Dragon Lounge, Chug Pub, Firefly) as much as before since I live on the Peninsula now.

We ordered one of the bowls meant for 2-4 people, couple beers, hornito shots & 2 mixed drinks. The shots here were huge & the cocktails tasted delicious & you could actually taste the alcohol in them- unlike some places where it's more sweet than anything else. I forgot the name of our bartender, but he was great! Hooked it up with a birthday shot & definitely easy to talk to. He even gave us a bunch of recommendations on places to eat & you know your girl loves her food so this made me happy. Got hungry between drinks & he was cool with us grabbing food and bringing it back into the bar to eat. I'll be back!", "author": "Tammy N."}

I have been going to Trad'r Sams for a while, but I just lost interest. It's too far and the parking sucks. Tiki Haven is pretty cool. It gets crowded so try to come early if you want good seats. \n\nThe Place: It's a bit small, but they have an upstairs (which I have yet to see because there was some kind of private party up there). You walk in and it's super narrow and difficult to maneuver through the crowd at the bar and from the tall bar seating to the side. Then it opens up towards the back where there are two benches along the wall with a small table, and then a table in the other corner that is sectioned off from the rest of the place. I wanted to sit there, but the group didn't budge the entire night. It would definitely come as early as you can if you want to sit down. It's fairly clean, but I'm assuming that's because it's new. I really like their tiki decor! My group sat on two tiki looking benches towards the back. It was ok, but kind of difficult to talk to everyone when we were separated on two benches. \n\nThe Parking: It's actually not that bad. Noriega is a pretty busy street, but we were able to find parking right away on a Saturday night at around 10:30pm. \n\nThe Bathrooms: There are 1 stall bathrooms for both men and women. Clean bathrooms with cute tiki door signs.\n\nThe Service: I wasn't buying the drinks, so I honestly don't know how the service is first-hand, but it seems fine. My boyfriend called it \"regular bar service\". I think what he meant was that they didn't talk too much or weren't completely friendly, but they took his order, made his drink, and handed it over while gladly accepting the payment. \n\nThe Drinks: Pretty strong :) We got the Fire Bowl for $17. I shared it with one other person but others still came and sipped it a little. It was good and strong! Definitely creeps up on you, so be careful!!

After all, when tiki bars were first popping up in the U.S., the attitude toward women was basically the same.

The drinks are nice and stiff, but the service could be better.  Extra points for their tiki themed drinks.  There is something for everyone on the menu; even picky girls like this place.

My friend and I went in on a Saturday night and there were only about 8 people inside at 9 pm. It's a nice quiet place to have flaming drinks and play board games, with none of the sticky tables and standing room only of more popular tiki places. Dang their restroom was ghetto though, there was no toilet seat and it was filled with kegs. The drinks themselves are not bad. We got a strawberry fire bowl and I got sufficiently sauced. I like the fact that both a BofA ATM and Safeway are within stumbling distance so that I can buy donuts for my drunchies. Good times were had; I will be back. \n\nP.S.

This experience is as follows: going out, cramming 8 people into a table meant for 3, getting hammered with three friends, getting hammered again on a grasshopper and then stumbling 15 or so blocks to the Jack-In-The-Box down Geary. After eating a disgusting selection you awaken to a splitting headache vowing never to do so again, and then you repeat a month and a half later after the shock has worn off. It's a very intense experience, but also a lot of fun, and for better or worse it's colored my experience of Tiki bars.\n\nTiki Haven is quite the opposite. It's a relaxed little spot nestled between small Asian restaurants in the Sunset, and while the drinks are strong (both the bowls and the the cocktails, as evidenced by my Hurricane), the atmosphere is not. Young professionals, some in Hawaiian shirts (for which you get a discount) milled about the bar area, and we found a Connect Four board nestled in the corner by a table.\n\nWe drove in quite a ways to get to this place based on something we'd heard from my friend. While I don't think it was worth the drive (there's not really anything around it except Asian restaurants) it is a relaxig little haunt to enjoy if you live in the area.

It was clean, well lit and the bartender was SUPER friendly and very nice. But it kinda felt like a sports bar with tiki heads thrown in.....\n\nDrinks: Taste, value, drinking pleasure. The drinks were fine. To be honest they jsut weren't memorable in anyway. But they were fine. Everyone else was drinking beer.\n\nSCORE: 6\n\nDecor: Looking for Unusual, evocative, fun, cheese factor. In my evaluation \"cheese\" was a plus!!!!!  Tiki Haven's decor was just too regimented and matchy-matchy. After expereincing Frankies in Vegas with tons of original art I was looking for some originality. Tiki Haven's decor appeared to have come from a \"Buy a Tiki Bar\" set. \n\nSCORE: 5\n\nBartender and staff: Two primary criteria here: Mixology skill and aloha spirit.  The bartender had the Aloha Spirit - friendly,warm, chatted us up about other Tiki bars in the area (That she didn't go to but heard about). I watched her handle a somewhat difficult customer very graciously. I docked her points here becasue she didn't seem to know much or really care about the drinks or the mixology and was just following a recipie - I just don't think Tiki or perhaps even cocktails - were her \"thing\" (The entire context of this review is Tiki)\n\nSCORE: 7\n\nPrice: I evaluated price with the understanding that Tiki drinks ARE pricey and I was in expensive cities. We hit Tiki haven duing some kind of happy hour, the drinks were reasonably priced\n\nSCORE: 7\n\nOverall: This was the most subjective category and scored solely on how much I enjoyed myself at the bar.

But  I'm not sure how to feel about this place. It has all the typical tiki decorations and 2 floors. They only have one big table  on the first floor (which was reserved) and seats at the bar and small tables that seats 3. Anyways, they have a menu that lists tropical and fruity rum-based cocktails as well as bowls. $8 for a cocktail doesn't seem too bad but it's still a bit hard to justify. First, the barteneders (however attractive) don't know how to make their drinks. Ok , I understand that each cocktail consists of multiple ingredients but it looks so unprofessional to have to reference a cheat sheet in front of your patrons. They also don't smile. Maybe a bad day? Second, the drinks aren't strong but what do you expect for $8, right? They do have board games like battleship and Jenga. We played jenga and the loser had to take a shot of rum so it made the time pass.\n\nPlace can get packed since it's rather small. Crowd is diverse which makes it more fun to people watch.", "author": "Steven L."}

Small bar that doesn't have much, but is a nice place to meet up a friend and talk if you dont want the rowdiness of a bar.  Beers are extremely cheap and I would come here again if I were to meet up with someone to grab a beer again.  Other than that, I can't really review it much more.

Yelped it and found TIki Haven. Never knew that this place existed until now and I will definitely return. If you wear hawaiian outfits, automatic discount! Theres also specials that go on during certain days and hours. Last time we came we were able to get those big bowls on fire for about 10 bucks a pop! Drinks are good and I definitely recommend the Pina Colada flavored Tikibowl!", "author": "Sappho C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-06", "description": "I was very excited to try this place but it was definitely not what I expected. Based upon the exterior of the bar and their tiki-tastic website, I was expecting a tropical oasis. They did a nice job with the interior and they seem to be serving the proper tiki drinks, but the ambiance was just not what I was hoping for. The lighting as a little bright, first of all. Most upsetting was the modern digital jukebox on the wall that seemed to be blaring exactly the opposite type of music one might expect for a place like this. I forgive the sports on tv, but the music really did not fit the atmosphere. Also, the Mai Tai was just so-so which is a problem for a tiki bar. I really wanted to like this place, but it was just not quite right.", "author": "Anne Y."}

They were playing a lot of hip hop which inside isn't what you'd expect at a tiki bar but whatever, the drinks are not too expensive, the bartenders are nice and the alcohol per drink ratio is pretty good. We got a few frozen drinks, some big ass shots, and a strawberry flavored \"firebowl\" which was good. They have different specials every day which is cool and the upstairs of the bar was awesome! When we came we had the upstairs to ourselves to sit and catch up, drink, and play games like jenga and break the ice. A lot of the games were missing pieces but still we had a good time and will definitely be back!", "author": "Jess H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-02", "description": "It was a late Sunday evening, so there was plenty of street parking.\n\nType of food:  Bar\n\nAmbiance:  Like I said before, it was a Sunday night- so the place was not very crowded but there were still people there.  I liked the quiet and chill atmosphere.  It was a nice time to catch up and chat with friends.  \nI love the Tiki decor.  There seems to be a lot of \"tiki\" spirit since the people working there were all wearing leis. We sat in the back where there were two tables and a long bench.  It felt like we were in a private area.  I liked that they had board games for entertainment but it made the environment feel a bit tacky.\n\nService:  Only 21+ are allowed in.  They checked ID at the door, but it doesn't seem like they are that strict. There were friendly two bartenders who greeted us.  Since it was a slow night, the service was quite fast. They brought out our drink in less than 10 minutes.  \n\nTaste:\nThe menu has a lengthy list of tropical drinks to match the decor. They even have special deals on the weekdays (check their website).  \nOur group decided to settle for the \"Fire Bowl\" since they are infamous for it and it seems like a good size to share among our group of 5. The Fire Bowl is described as \"our signature blended punch made with rum, vodka, and gin with cranberry and your choice of fruit wild berry, pina colada, strawberry, peach, or passion fruit. This drink packs a punch as well. Served in a large volcano tiki bowl with a fiery surprise. Serves 2-4 people.\"  We decided to go with the passion fruit because it sounded exotic.  It was good, sweet, but I didn't really taste the alcohol.  It looks like cocktail bowls from Tradr Sam's (but their drink is way more intense).  Besides that, it's called FIRE bowl because they light a pineapple at the center of the bowl.  Interesting, but the fire went out after 2 minutes. The bowl looked different and cool, but I could have lived without it.  I rather have a stronger kick.\n\nPrice:  As mentioned before, they have weekly specials that seems to be a good deal. The Fire Bowl was $17.  It's a bit pricey for juice and a tad of alcohol.  \n\nOverall:  I would definitely like to come back on a Friday or Saturday because it seems like a fun place to hangout with young adults.  However, even on slow days like Sunday, it seems like a fun place to just chill and relax since there were plenty of empty tables and it wasn't very noisy.  I'm giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars because the cocktail wasn't as infamous as it seems.  Also, I didn't feel the fun bar vibe; but that may change if I decide to come another day.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

The bartender pretty much ignored us. We were finally able to order our drinks after like 10minutes. We got a pina colada fire bowl and a wiki waki woo. The wiki waki woo was pretty good but the pina colada was pink and nasty. I dont think pina colada is suppose to be pink and it tasted like rubbing alcohol. Never coming back to this place again. I should have listened to my friends and gone to the tiki bar in San Mateo instead.", "author": "Stephanie L."}
