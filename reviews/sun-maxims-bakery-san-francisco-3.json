Their dim sum is not stored in a steamer therefore the Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) had an entirely hard shell, and the shell for the chive one was inedible.

Not here! And oh btw did I mention their steamed pork buns are delicious? The bread is so soft and just a little bit sweet. Perfection in small doughy form. \n\nThe only thing I dinged a star for is that the pork buns are very bread heavy. Not much meat.

Sssssshhhh...\nThey have the best \"Soy Sauce King\" stir fried noodles (See yiao wong chow mein) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) that I've had.  This small dim sum location in the Inner Sunset makes me wonder how much better the food quality of these neighborhoods are than Chinatown.  For me, what makes this dish special are the ingredients, flavor, and preparation.  First, they use egg omelet strips, whole chive slices, and sesame seeds in making this dish.  Next, the flavor is not overly salty, which commonly happens since the namesake is Soy Sauce King.  Finally, the most impressive thing is that, given that this is a takeout place, their food is normally reheated.  One peeve of most Chinese takeout food is that the grease/oil settles to the bottom of the container, reminding us of the damage we will be doing to our heart.  There was no visible grease or oil on my plastic box nor, after reheating in another bowl, in my eating bowl.\nAnother favorite is the Sticky Fried Rice (Lo Mai Chow Fan), mostly found in sit-down dim sum places.  Like the noodles, the rice is flavored well and not too much dried shrimp, one of my least favorite ingredients.  \nCome by here if you need a quick bite or want to take something for a future reheated meal.

I love tea so I'll buy this again and share it with my dad...tea addict and see what he thinks. But it's soft and easy to eat I think there's chunks of taro inside too? I don't know but I'm going to semi pan fry one of the pieces to see how it tastes crunchy on the outside later this evening.\n\nShrimp Dumplings ($1.90_3 pieces)\nI've always ordered shrimp dumplings every where I go, it's one of the best things for dim sum in my opinion. What I like about this store's version is the size isn't huge but it's not tiny either. Also the flour wrapper isn't really thick or too thin that it breaks when it's steamed and just looks ugly. The inside is good because they don't use huge pieces of fat as stuffing instead of shrimp like some places, I can actually taste shrimp and when I open it up there's small shrimp that aren't tiny tiny.\n\nChive Dumplings ($1.90_3 pieces)\nI got addicted to chive dumplings because of my sister...these ones are a bit different to what I'm used to, they're wrapped flat instead of like a potsticker. It has lots of chives and the wrapper isn't chewy, however the one thing I noticed is it's a bit oily so think just one order (3 piece=1 order) is perfect.\n\nChicken Siu Mai ($1.80_3 pieces)\nI've also never tried chicken siu mai, I've always had pork so new experience! It's interesting, it's chicken and ginger, I love ginger so definitely a plus! I'll order this again to have my family try since the other places we've been getting our siu mai are failing our expectations.\n\nConclusion: I will order again for myself 100% shrimp dumplings, chive dumplings, chicken siu mai! Not too sure about the taro yet it might be because I didn't grow up eating it so it's a bit different but I guess for those who've had it before can do a better review on that than I can.", "author": "Olivia O."}

It's nice - only if the case weren't so steamy. It looks like a good presentation, but problem is when the dim sum comes out it's not that warm or steamy. \n\nSo about the dishes:\nThe taste of the hargow and the shu mai are standard, nothing to rave about.\n Egg Tarts - okay\nbarbeque pork buns are decent - not too big, which I like\nThe congee with black egg and pork is good - not too salty.\n\nMy advice i that it's always cheaper to buy things in 3's here, if you buy one sometimes it's more expensive than just going and getting 3. \n\nIf you don't speak chinese, you're going to have a really hard time communicating to these people what you want, so this is where your pointing and hand gestures need to come in for this place.\n\nOverall: This isn't somewhere you rush into for dim sum, just somewhere you stop by when you're in the neighborhood when you have a craving.", "author": "Christine B."}

No. Would I ever come out of my way to get here? No.\n\nAlso, I wish that when the person selling us all of this stuff signaled that we took a closer look at the displays to see what they did have left that everything was label.

I get my yummy dim sum, and a cute space as well. \n\nNow onto the food! So far, So good! The dumplings I've had were all super tasty, shrimp and pork. The chicken bun was good, a little bread-y for me... I just tear off what bugs me and keep eating! The custard tarts are ridiculously good. And today, the sweet smiling lady  behind the counter enticed me with fresh mochis! They had just come out. There was Strawberry, Mango and Pineapple. Such beautiful colors, a rainbow of flavorful fun. There is REAL fruit inside these babies! no paste. Real. Live. Fruit! So good.

Am I jealous? Noooooo.\n\nHey where's my free coffee, dammit. \n\nEnvy aside, this place is pretty cool (and I know I shouldn't be envious because my friend has bought so much stuff from that place over the years, he's probably earned it!). Their food is a lot like the food I grew up with in Hawaii. You can get rice cake, bean cake, taro cake and these really delectible, greasy sesame seed rolls (here's a pic http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWBDP3TampJ03W0Mn9erxQ?select=6BQPbmGbqeoQ2QKTovfERA) and it's all cheap, cheap, cheap.\n\nThey also have a good assortment of boxed carton drinks that are like no other \"American\" drinks you'd typically find in a drink section (see pic http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWBDP3TampJ03W0Mn9erxQ?select=02q_CrXzoPT6Ek9NbwIEZQ).

Luckily, every one I've tried so far has tasted good, and they're inexpensive. Their guava juice is amazing (I think it's made from green guavas as opposed to the ripe kind, and I like this type better). They have a coconut drink, sugar cane drink, taro drink and a few others I haven't tried yet but have been meaning to. Sometimes they sell out of the ones I want - like the coconut or the green guava - pretty quick.\n\nAnyway, my friend just called me today to let me know about his latest coffee hookup (well aren't... you... special), which reminded me to do this review. At first I was like, dude, those women want to see you naked. But apparently even the guy who works there gives him the hookup too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-01", "description": "I've been to this place twice in the past few weeks and I've been pleasantly surprised each time.  It is probably one of the better dim sum places I've been to in the past year or so.  As a lot of the other reviews say, the service is great, and they always get your dim sum with a smile.  They have a lot of tasty treats in the front counter case, but they also tell you what is steaming at the moment to make sure you get the hottest stuff.  \n\nThe place is also clean, which is an added plus when eating at Chinese places on Irving St.  The pork buns, both steamed and baked, are very good.  Lots of meat and veggies in them, and very good sized portions.  The shrimp and chive dumplings were also very good.  A little oily, maybe, but not overwhelmingly so.  It's something like 80 cents for 3 of them.\n\nNow, I've been eating dim sum since I was a kid, and I came across something here that I haven't seen before: a baked bbq pork cookie.  It was phenomenal.  Imagine the pork from a pork bun wrapped in a crunchy flaky dough.  Biting into it is an experience, you get the salty and the sweet and the different textures make this dim sum something worth making a trip to this place for.  It also is something like  80 cents, so why not.  \n\nAll in all you can get a good sized meal here for between $5 and $8 which is saying something in San Francisco. My only two issues with this place is that they could use a better place for customers to sit down.  They advertise mainly as take out, but a nice place eat in would be nice too.  \n\nThe other thing is that I was very disappointed with their sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  It was a hug portion, which was nice, but all the taste seemed to have been cooked out of it.  The rice was over done to the point of literally being wallpaper paste.  I think this is the one dim sum to pass on, but over all, this is a place I'd go back to.", "author": "Adam E."}
