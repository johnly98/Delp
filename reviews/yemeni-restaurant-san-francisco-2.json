It turns out that they don't have an electronic system for managing orders, preferring fax via a service called EatStreet. That evening, the fax system was down and so EatStreet phoned them up to make the order - but they didn't manage to get through...\n\nIn any case, the host took our order once we worked out what had happened and we decided to eat it there instead. The restaurant was almost entirely full of Yemeni customers (presumably breaking their fast after sunset) and so it took a little while to get our food. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is relatively authentic (at least what I'd imagine a typical Middle Eastern place would look like - I've never been to Yemen).\n\nIt was well worth the wait though. We ordered a classic dish called \"Saltah\" made with chicken that was hot enough to burn the lining off of our mouths, but was spicy, flavourful and the perfect thing to dip the fresh bread in. \n\nThe lentil soup that we also ordered was relatively bland but tasted fresh enough.\n\nI'd go back!", "author": "Sunil S."}

The shawarma was bland and doesn't belong to shawarma at all. It was a had cut small pieces of chicken cooked in a pan. The mandi wasn't traditionally cooked as it supposed to be cooked in a hole underground with the rice. It was a piece of boiled lamb with some rice! The kofta was burned and dry. Same with sheesh kebabs and chicken which supposed to be cubes of juicy meats but it was a thinly sliced cut of meat that was dry and hard to bite. Very disappointed!", "author": "M K."}

It was really good specially with that price. Totally worth ordering it. \n\nFahteh ahhh my favorite. I can eat Fahteh for the rest of my life. The bread cooked with the lamb tastes really good. Highly recommended. \n\nThe vegetable and veal entree was pretty good as well. But my personal opinion is that both Fahteh and that tastes pretty much the same.

A quick search on Yelp threw up Yemeni Restaurant so I decided to give it a try a couple of days ago. Yemeni Restaurant is located in Lower Noob Hill so there is no need to shoo off pan handlers on the way so definitely a step up. \n\nTo keep things simple I decided to get the same dish that I got at Yemen Kitchen namely the Saltah ($6.95 small +$3 for lamb and veggies) which is the national dish of Yemen. It consists of vegetables and roasted lamb cooked in a clay pot that is topped with whipped fenugreek. I ordered ahead using the app on Yelp and landed up there after 20 minutes.\n\nI was expecting a small hole in the wall but Yemeni Restaurant is a decent sized place. Unfortunately at the peak lunch hour on a weekend there was only one person eating in. Good news is that my order was ready and I was on my way.\n\nAs soon as I opened the container my entire room was filled with a strong aroma which indicated that this was prepared the right way. As it had a ton of fenugreek I thought that its bitterness would overpower the dish but that was not the case. The lamb was a little chewy but stopped short of being overcooked. The saltah came with naan bread (unlike the cheap store bought pita that I got from Yemen Kitchen) actually it was a little crispier than normal naan bread so was more like a tandoori roti. Overall this was a good dish. \n\nPrice-wise it was pretty cheap and comparable to prices in the hood (Tenderloin). Service was fast, ordering was painless. Looks like I've found my preferred place for Yemeni food so will be back periodically to sample more stuff off their menu.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Came here after reading the SFGate's article on Yemeni food and I just had to try. \n\nParking wasn't too bad since it's in a quieter part of the tender-nob. Inside, pictures of Yemen/Middle East decorate the walls while music videos from the Middle East show on their tv. Went for lunch and it wasn't really busy but I knew this place had authentic food from the steady stream of Middle Eastern men, most of them dining solo. \n\nStarted with the maraq ($1) - lamb broth soup which reminded me of miso soup since it was clean without any fatty residue. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_M1DqDEZx2k24g1onEAQUQ&userid=pDfL8xt8F8ls0-kQIG_ADg)\n\nFalafal ($5) - 4 pieces and these were more pancake like in shape with a denser texture than a typical Mediterranean falafal. \n\nSaltah $10 - Our waitress suggested this Yemeni traditional dish which is like a braised lamb soup. It came to the table bubbling and the flavors of the tender lamb reminded me of Indian cuisine but softer, not as bold and complex. A comfort food type of dish. \n\nChicken gyro plate ($11) - came with a bunch of fresh veggies and the chicken was more chicken strips than the gyro that comes on a spit. Just ok. \n\nFinished the meal off with some Yemeni red and milk tea which had a hint of sweetness. ($1.50 each) \n\nIf you want an authentic taste of Yemen here's your place. Bring your quarters for the meters, not your passport.\n\nI'd come back to try this grilled lamb dish that everyone else was ordering.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-25", "description": "My friend and I were initially interested in going to Saha, but the two-hour wait eventually steered us across the street to this Yemeni restaurant. The interior was large, spacious, and filled with Yemeni customers of all ages. Upon entering, there was a two-tier platform overlooking the open floor and cash register. Lighting was a tad bright for dinner, but the trade off was the feel of authenticity in the air.\n\nThe Hummus with Tahini ($4.50) came with a generous portion of creamy hummus served with tanour bread. The bread was a bit thicker and dense than pita, and the hummus was smooth with a chickpea flavor without the zing at the end. The bread was served warm and easy to peel by hand. I've had better hummus elsewhere, but this was a solid beginning.\n\nThe Chicken Shawerma ($10.95) consisted of marinated chicken, rice, and veggies. The chicken was tender but the marinate was quite subdued. The rice came with generous portions, but there were noticeable clumps that made it unpleasant. I don't recommend it.\n\nThe Haneed ($12.95) came with a large bulky piece of roasted lamb served with rice and veggies. The lamb was soft, tender, and easy to fork into. This dish usually comes with a plethora of spices, but the flavors unfortunately were held in check. It was a decent dish, but could be improved. \n\nOur servers were very generous to treat us to their version of Rice Pudding. It was served warm with rice, raisins, and milk. The consistency was thick and custard-like. It was a nice dessert to complement our hot Yemeni Tea, or also known as Adani ($1.50). \n\nService was warm, hospitable, and friendly. In all, portions were very generous and the flavors could be much more robust with refinement. The Rice Pudding was a nice gesture, and prices were solid for the area that we were in. 2.5 stars. I will have to visit other Yemeni restaurants before deciding whether to return.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Based on my visits, the waitstaff was friendly, but service was kinda of slow.  The place seemed dead. Not too many customers.  The place lacks ambiance.  I tried the Saltah (the national dish of Yemen).  It was OK.  It was basically a meaty stew.  I would recommend stirring the stew, before eating it.  Stirring it brings out the subtle flavor of the dish. The Tanour oven baked bread (sort of like Nan bread) was good.  I also tried the Malawah bread (sort of like a buttered Nan bread), which was very good.  It was moist and tasty.  The Mandi Hadrami (baked lamb dish) was very good.  The lamb meat was moist and tender. I think they use lamb rib meat. I think it is their best dish.  Kabsah Lamb (Yemeni Lamb Biryani) was above average.  It was not amazing. I think Kabsah is also the national dish of Saudi Arabia.  The Masoob (a warm creamy bread and banana Yemeni/Saudi pudding) was OK.  The serving was huge, but the presentation was lacking.  The Yemeni milk tea was good, but a kind of pricey. I got charged two dollars per 8 ounce cup I drank during my last visit. \n\nOverall, a nice place to visit if you want to explore Yemeni/Saudi cuisine. The servings are huge.  I would not recommend coming alone.  A lot of the dishes are sharable. Customer service is a bit lacking.

It's probably like presuming Korean food is not much different than Chinese or Japanese food. Cultural ignorance and xenophobia abound in this cold world, so it is my personal mission to discover the unique cuisines in this city, one restaurant at a time. You can thank me later. So there are actually two Yemeni restaurants on the same block - the fancier Saha, which I haven't tried yet, and this modest corner operation (photo: http://bit.ly/14ctfFb).\n\nI've seen it riding past on the 2-Clement line, so I wanted to give it a shot. I entered at 6:30 on a Monday evening to a nearly vacant, triple-tier space (photo: http://bit.ly/15XwITY). I waited about five minutes before one of the waitresses, perhaps the only one, acknowledged my presence at which point I was told I could sit anywhere I want. I sat at a table on the second tier only to be told it was not set, and so I was told to sit somewhere else. I walked down to the main floor where I sat at a table with a setting. At that point, I waited another five minutes for a menu. I started feeling unwelcome until the owner stopped by and asked me whether it was the first time I dined here.\n\nI said yes, and then he described all the house specialties (photo: http://bit.ly/14ZMfWP), which was great but then I waited another five minutes for the waitress to take my order. Based on the owner's recommendation, I went for the $12.95 Mandi Hadrami, which turned out to be a lamb shank baked in its own juices in a way that recalled osso bucco. It came with a side salad and a scoop of the house rice (photo: http://bit.ly/1bz8gzb). It was pretty good though I frankly like lamb shank in any culinary style that's presented to me. I just thought the dish as a whole was on the bland side, and I think I will need to try other Yemeni dishes to give this cuisine a fair shake. Next time maybe I'll give Saha a try.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a good lamb shank, just nothing that makes me shout from the rooftops\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...atmospheric in here\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...well, uhhh...the owner was nice\nTOTAL - 3 stars...is Yemeni cuisine the new black?...not quite", "author": "Ed U."}

What we did get was a tiny portion of saut\u00e9ed green pepper and onion (maybe 3 tablespoonful), sans sauce, over rice, which was not mentioned on the menu.  So this turned out to be a very expensive side dish disguised as an entr\u00e9e with the addition of the rice.\n\nThe chicken dish was topped with cream sauce which was not mentioned on the menu.\n  \nThe lamb stew was quite bitter, something that I am not sure should be the case.

I ordered the chicken Kabsa and an order of hummus. The chicken dish said it was sauteed chicken with rice, scallion, onion and spices. I assumed it was boneless chicken but I was incorrect. Bone in pieces which were very moist and tender. The rice was delicious and the meal was plentiful. The spices were good and not overpowering. All and all this dish was a winner. The hummus was tasty but different than any other hummus I have ever had. I can't quite describe the difference although it was runnier than most hummus I have had and I would say it didn't taste very chickpeaish. The tanoor bread was delicious although I don't think I would order the hummus again.", "author": "Linda M."}

The restaurant is divided into two sections, the one in the back is elevated a bit. Although there were only a few diners in the lower section, we were ushered to the very back of the restaurant, where it was a bit lonely. undaunted, we ordered our dishes from the lovely waitress.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the meze platter - exquisite hummus and baba ganoush. The Yemeni bread was also a treat.\n\nThe entrees were pretty basic, nothing too memorable.\nMy dish, the Trout (Yemeni Masqoof) 12.95, was fried but still light.\n\nThe marinated Boned Chicken Roasted Chicken 11.95 was prepared well, but a bit bland.\n\nWe would definitely be back for more appetizers - especially since we found out about their byob or wine policy.", "author": "Carole B."}

The service is excellent too. We have ordered Mandi (my favorate dish in Yemen) it was excellent, Fahsah similar to saltah but only yemeni people can tell the difference it was great, chicken kabsah was great but I didn't like the taste of cilantro in it as it is not used in the original dish and chicken should have been cooked with the rice not separately (but still very good). \nIf you are looking for a great Yemeni food, this is the place to go. To be more specific, if you like Lamb this is the best Yemeni style lamb you can get in California.\nAll in all it was excellent experience, I finally ate the food I am craving for years. I have to say that the Eritrean girl was so friendly and just complimented my experience there.\nMy only complaint if I had to say it, is that i live in the central valle, and don't come often to SF, and when I do most of the times it is Ramadhan and they close during the day.", "author": "Naif B."}

The falafel was quite dry, and seemed like it had been made hours beforehand. It just wasn't quite as fresh as I had remembered. The salmon filet was also cooked to a well done state rather than the medium salmon that I had and really liked the last time. It looked like a large piece of the crispy skin had stuck to the pan and peeled off. I almost couldn't believe they had the guts to serve that to a customer. The portion also seemed smaller than before, and it came with a side of lettuce, which looked pretty sad. It came with a brown rice, although I remember a white rice sprinkled with orange the previous time. The waitress didn't ask us whether we wanted brown or white rice. I thought the white rice was a bit more visually appealing, although the brown may be slightly healthier. \n\nI'm not sure what happened to Yemeni's, but the quality has really declined, I'm sorry to say.

The marinade  was good but didn't seep throughout the fish so we had to eat it with the super spicy and yummy Yemeni green chili salsa that was served with our food.\n\nHaneed (Roasted lamb leg) was slightly saucy and huge. It was sweet, savory, and smoky at the same time. Tasty, but we liked the Kabsah most. \n\nUnfortunately, hygiene and service were lacking. The floor and dishes seemed a little dirty and the waitress, who was quite friendly, didn't actually think of giving us extra plates even though we were eating family style.

I had some falafel and stuffed grape leaves, while my friend had the chicken shawarma. Oddly enough, the restaurant was quite empty around lunch time--I think we were the only other guests aside from one table. The food was tasty, but nothing memorable that would prompt me to return.\n\nService was also a bit off--our waitress apparently mastered the art of disappearing because I don't think I saw her at all after she took our order, and it was a task to flag her down for the bill. \n\nFrom what I could tell, this block has quite a few Middle Eastern restaurants and markets, so perhaps I just chose a slightly underwhelming one...onward toward my search for legit, mind-blowing SF Middle Eastern cuisine.", "author": "Ellie W."}

We all really love Middle Eastern/Arabic food (since I worked before in Saudi Arabia), and we have eaten at many different restaurants here in US with this cuisine. However, the food we enjoyed here at Arabian Sky definitely stands out among the rest! \n\nTo start off, we were given complimentary lamb soup, which tasted very good, and was also very aromatic, due to the other spices included in the soup. We also ordered falafel as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the Lamb Kebsa, my wife and one of my daughters ordered the lamb shank (which is called \"Lamb Haneeb\" on the menu), and my other daughter ordered the Shish Kefta. My lamb kebsa was very flavorful, and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of lamb that was in it, too! I had a piece of lamb in every bite of my kebsa! My wife and daughter were very pleased with their lamb shanks, which were fall-off-the-bone tender. And my other daughter really enjoyed her kefta, too! The entree actually came with 3 keftas, and they were seasoned very well. Both the lamb shanks and the kefta came with basmati rice that was very aromatic and complimented the 2 dishes very well. Also, the portion sizes here at Arabian Sky are very much worth the price! While I was able to finish my kebsa (I enjoyed it so much!), my wife and daughters had to take some of their orders to go! By the way, the food tasted just as good once we ate our leftovers at home as when we were eating at the restaurant itself! \n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our experience here, at Arabian Sky. The waiters were very kind, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was family friendly. If I had to say anything negative about this place, it would only be that some of the food was a bit on the salty side, and we hope that the chef can reduce the amount of salt in the future. But we will definitely be looking forward to coming back here again the next time we are in San Francisco!!", "author": "Stanley C."}

At first, I thought this was a Greek or mediterranean restaurant.  When I think mediterranean, I think of only kabobs.\n\nI ordered the mandi hadhrami which consists of a generous portion of lamb meat, long grain rice with some brownish color oil for flavor, and small salad.  The lamb meat the waitress gave me was a lamp chop with a bone in the middle but I noticed my friend had many bones with slightly fattier meat.  We asked the waitress and she said it's a different cut of lamb and usually regulars only want a certain cut.  It's hard for me to describe the lamb other than the spices they put on it was tasty since I'm unfamiliar with Yemen food.  With the amount of lamb and rice given, you can easily fall into a food coma so definitely order some caffeinated drinks to wake yourself up.\n\nRECAP: Mandi Hadhrami's lamb can be a certain cut if requested.  I'm sure other dishes can be customized as well.", "author": "Ronald L."}

Since this is one of the only Yemenis restaurants in the bay area I guess they are allowed to set the bar and unfortunately  they set the bar pretty low. For food that is as unique as Yemeni food they should take that uniqueness and integrate it with their decor and ambience as we are all to familiar with the norm of middle eastern restaurants and kabob houses. The place has the look of a typical cheapo Chinese restaurant. In fact I believe they probably got the furniture and interior from a Chinese restaurant because of the leftover cantonese writing I could see in the wood. \n\nNow for the food. I have been to Yemen many times (Sanna, Taiz, Aden, Hudaida) and something that is common with all Yemeni food is thick pans and searing hot food. I mean soo hot it looks like lava, it should always be this hot as it helps you take your time and enjoy every bite slowly and it brings each flavor and spice to your taste buds. Over here I got cold food, i almost felt like it was a leftover forgotten in the kitchen. The chef also loves salt, my tongue is sensitive to salt  and I left with a sore tongue (too much salt). Also aside from bringing you cold plates, they take forever bringing 1 plate at a time. Usually by the time every last drop is eaten off your plate 10 min later the next will arrive. By the time half our order has arrived I become full from waiting soo long that I just want to leave. \n\nService sucks. The place is understaffed or the staff is way unorganized. Not my business so I don't pay attention to their ethics but what bothers me is that :\n- They don't write orders for the kitchen, I am always asked multiple times what did I order. \n- They don't care much about you if you are a returning customer or regular\n-They never want to help you or check up on you\n-THE WHOLE MENU IS NEVER AVAILABLE! They ate always short on something. This bothers me the most, I go because I want to order exactly what I want, not to get the cold salty kitchen leftovers. \n\nI am tired and can no longer stomach the food from this place. The only thing keeping it open is that it is the only Yemeni restaurant in sf. Its sad that they take such little pride in what they do, being the cullinary representatives of a country most know nothing of.", "author": "Yosof R."}

Sit where ever you want\" as the hostess explained with attitude.\n\nOkay...I'll always give the benefit of the doubt. We were seated at our table. Literally ten minutes goes by without even being acknowledged by the waitress even as she passed by us numerous times. We had yet to even receive a menu. However we didn't notice that our waitress did have time to stop at \"a locals\" table while speaking and flirting with a gentlemen for five minutes while speaking farsi. \n\nEventually in disgust, I get up, walk to the front door and grab two menus myself. The girlfriend and I look over the menu, make our decisions, and put the menu down. The waitress continues to ignore us while passing us by numerous times. We wait ten more minutes without being acknowledged and I start to really loose my cool. I'm embarrassed at this point even in situations wear I pride myself on being calm, cool, and collected.\n\nEventually I have to grab what looks to be the owner and tell him we are ready to order. He says okay, speaks something in farsi to the waitress and she comes over to take our order. Keep in mind, there was no acknowledgement of any wrong doing or anything at this point. \n\nFifteen minutes later (now almost 40 minutes into dinner) we get our food. The food is quite tasty although very dry without any sauces. At this point, I figured it would take another ten minutes to have them bring me any sauce so I refrain from asking.\n\nI'm sorry but I can stand restaurants in this city that can't hire people who have basic customer services skills or a desire to provide good service. Obviously this is a family run restaurant and boy can you tell that they hire the 19 year old cousin to be the waitress. The whole atmosphere and level of service felt extremely weird. Almost a sense of \"anti white\" sentiment while blatantly ignoring my girlfriend and I throughout the meal and just an overall feeling of, \"wow...this place is really amateur and doesn't have it together\".\n\nI'll never be back at this place for dinner in the restaurant. Take out? Maybe, but dinner inside the place, no way. Too many other good \"mediterranean\" places in this city that know how to deliver a good dining experience with real solid food.\n\nMy recommendation, pass on this place!!!", "author": "Jeff R."}

And we really enjoyed it. So we put in a reservation via Yelp Open Table for a Friday evening.\n\nUm don't really need reservation. It's really not a fancy place and not a lot of people. First impression was not good.. our table had yellow stain on it. And the lady owner maybe? grabbed one of our menus as it was handed over to us because she was taking an order over the phone. Not too professional. Most of the tables were set up for 4 or more people, which I found odd. Tables for 2 were pushed to the fringes like ours, by the kitchen.  \n\nWe ordered the La Sanaa Meza for appetizer which is like a sampler of many sauces like hummus and baba ghannouge, with falafel and tanour bread. I would recommend getting this as everything was delicious, esp the bread. They will bring you extra if you want. \n\nFor entrees we went adventurous and ordered dishes we've never even heard of (but looked up on Google LOL). The Maqluba looked amazing on the pics we saw, so my partner ordered that. What we got was not at all what we saw.. it was just  grilled beef (or chicken if you want) over rice. For $14 not sure about the value so overall it was OK. The taste was good but like I said not at all like the pics. I had the Mandi Hadrami, which is baked ham served with rice. The lamb was super tender and good taste. I liked it but felt it was a little boring. \n\nWe'll be back because we want to try the Salta and some other things. Service was good. It's not like Saha but it wasn't that bad. It's probably a family-run restaurant so some things are are not up to par but that's OK.", "author": "Vol T."}

I had tried it for Iftar with a friend last year, and i really did not like it.. had a bad memory of it. This year my friend wanted to return for Iftar so i decided to give it another try - especially that they are under new ownership and now called Arabian Sky.\n\nFood: I dont know Yemeni food.. but i know Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, and food from the Maghreb. This \"yemeni food\" seems to be just a mix of anything deriving from any Arab country.. no specialty dish.  It serves Shak-Shoukah (Tunisian though made in different countries), Taboulleh, foul, hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves, etc. \n\n*The hummus is the worst i have ever had anywhere.. i can make a better one FOR SURE. I think it was 3/4ths tahini (that they forgot in the baba ganoush lol) and 1/4th chickpeas. \n\n*The baba ganoush is not baba ganoush, its just crushed and cooked eggplant - i know there are different variations of this dish but i dont think there was even Tahini in it. \n\n*the grape leaves were really really bad. Again, they taste different based on who makes them usually (Turkish are always most flavorful) but these were canned and terrible.\n\n*the Tabbouleh.. hmm.. i dont even know that it could be called Taboulleh. At least there was parsely.. but barely any tomatoes or bulgar/couscous\n\n*The Lebneh was thicker than usual. It wasnt bad but it was not Lebneh as i know it.\n\n*The bread was awesome\n\n*The soup - my friend said was good, and it smelled good\n\n*The \"samosas\" are not samosas.. though they are triangular. They were good but not typical \"briques\" at all. \n\nService: Very sweet woman helping... but one woman for Iftar is not enough staff.. She can not bring dates and milk to everyone on time.. my friend ended up having no milk and other tables dipped their dates in water. We had to ask for bread.. ask for dates.. etc. Ask to order.. which of course didnt happen in time. \n\n*During Ramadan they have a buffet of soups, (one vegetarian included which is good), and fresh fruit salad (good).\n\nSetting: ugly and depressing. Door was open and it was cold. \n\n-- I was sick all night.", "author": "Sara S."}

I ordered the kafta kebab and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and tender ground beef kebabs with rice and salad.

Their yogurt was store bought and ONLY had cucumbers (no mint as promised from the menu). The chicken was burned and hardly spiced. The lamb (which my partner ordered) was mostly bones and overcooked. It came with a side of salsa that tasted suspiciously like the salsa Costco sells. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and overripe tomatoes with a rancid-y tasting dressing. The lights in the restaurant (all of them) flicker.\n\nThe waitress was nice and was wearing a pleasant perfume.

The fava beans were flavored really nicely and made for a hearty dish, although it was entirely a sauce/dip of the beans - nothing on the side or anything else.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-07", "description": "They say the first impression can color your perpetual perception of someone (or something). Well, the hostess/waitress who took my take-out order seemed impatient with me as I inquired about the specials advertised outside, as well as how two dishes that sounded fairly similar differed from each other. Okay, fine: maybe this is a place that is not welcoming to newbies. That's understandable, I suppose. Having learned that the chicken version of the kasbah advertised on the specials board came with flat bread while the lamb version did not, I went with the chicken one. I was told there would be a 15-minute wait before my order would be ready, so I walked across the street to Jerusalem Market (which was awesome, by the way) to kill a few minutes.\n\nAfter I returned, I sat in a little booth that faced the front of the restaurant and waited quietly for my order. Five minutes passed, and a dude who works there (maybe a waiter, maybe a kitchen staff member) came to me and asked if I had ordered the mandi hadhrami with lamb. Yes, in fact, I did. \"Well, we're out of lamb.\" What, really? Um, okay. I really didn't want to order another chicken dish, which was the special I ordered. And the fish of the day (salmon) didn't sound interesting to me. After some stressful minutes with the menu and this guy I had a hard time understanding, the original hostess/waitress came by and said that my order was the last one they were packing up before they had to make a new batch of the lamb mandi hadhrami. Oh, okay, so really, I'm fine. Great!\n\nAs she later came out with my order, she even went back to it and double checked something while I was getting ready to pay. Despite the snafu, I tipped generously given that I thought I was going to get exactly what I ordered. Well, not quite. After I got home and unpacked everything, I realized that they forgot my flat bread, which I had really wanted to try. Argh, that was the only reason why I ordered the chicken kasbah instead of the lamb! At least everything else was there and tasted excellent.\n\nThe verdict: I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, but maybe I'll give them another chance later on when I've exhausted other options.", "author": "Tiff T."}

It had its initial struggles, as any new business does, but the improvements more than make up for the mistakes here and there that are part of the growing pains.\n\nTo those of you that have been in the Middle East, this is a real Middle Eastern restaurant, almost to the T. The owner, Ali, is a super friendly Yemeni immigrant that goes out of his way to ensure all of his guests (because you are guests, not just customers) are having a good time - and he will do what he can to make anything better. He also lovingly helps to prepare a lot of the food himself.\n\nThe waitresses are fine, decent, and friendly themselves, but be aware that all of the servers are rather 'green'. Don't be afraid to grab their attention. Be Middle Eastern! Be assertive (not aggressive), but kind and you will have a great experience.\n\nThat is really what Yemeni's Restaurant is - an experience. Sure, the decor isn't flashy and it could easily classify as a 'hole in the wall' restaurant atmosphere, but that's what makes it so great.\n\nI've been there now at least a dozen times and have tried about everything on the menu. The menus, btw, have been updated to reflect the current menu choices and prices, although (as their website says), prices are subject to change.\n\nThis is truly a gem of a place in the Lower Nob Hill, and is well worth a visit.

The menu is full of hard to pronounce dishes that stray from the standard falafel and kabob choices.  Anything in a stew is probably awesome and a perfect excuse to use the bread!\n\nSahawiq Cheese: Ground up chilies, spices and cheese in a consistency somewhere between yogurt and cream cheese.  The dairy helps prevent it from being crazy hot.  A great dip alternative to the standard Middle Eastern choices.\n\nMandi Hadhrami: Basically slow cooked lamb shank with some stewed vegetables on rice.  The lamb was extremely tender with delicious melt away fat.  The veggies (celery, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant) were a bit soggy and bland.  The rice was long grained and quite fluffy.\n\nYemeni Salteh: You can't go to a Yemeni restaurant without having their national dish!  It comes out bubbling in a metal bowl like something you'd see at Korean tofu house.  The broth is a very thick and rich gravy topped with some egg foam and all sorts of spices.  Tastes amazing when you let some of the fresh bread soak up all the goodness.  I feel it's more about the broth base than the morsels of meat and veggies on the bottom.  HMM!\n\nGrilled Kofta: Tiny little hockey pucks with a ton of flavor.  I like that it wasn't overly cooked with some nice pink hiding beneath the seared outer edge.  Much better spices in the minced lamb than a lot of those kabob houses around town.\n\nGrilled Lamb: Thin pieces of lamb that still manage to have a nice medium rareness inside.  Very tasty spices on the charred outside.\n\nGrilled Chicken: Dry and chewy.  Not their best grill offering.\n\nTanour Bread: Fresh out of the oven!  More like an over-sized puffy pita than naan.

I felt like I was back in Turkey (as close as I have been to Yemen, geographically and cuisine-wise). We were seated and disregarded the menus, instead asking the waitress what was available and what she recommended. We all listened and made our selections accordingly.\n\nDinner was tasty overall, but most of the meat dishes and the rice accompanying them was good but not amazing. However, the vegetarian \"FOUL something\" composed of Fava Beans was indeed AMAZING! Best flavors of the night. I would probably go back and just order a couple plates of that and bread and chow down.\n\nFor dessert the waitress said the owner's family had picked some fresh fruit over the weekend, and brought out a pretty fruit plate with honey drizzled on top. We had tea (loaded with sugar!) and ate our perfectly ripe fruit. The bill came and it was totally reasonable! (Gotta love being forced not to order alcohol - really brings the price of dinner down!). I'll be back for sure.", "author": "Jonah C."}

We also found out about Saha but I figured we'd give this restaurant a shot, and I hoped it was as authentic as it seemed.\n\nWe weren't disappointed. Though my diet these days doesn't include wheat and goes easy on carbs I was able to eat here without guilt - they also offer a vegetarian menu and solid veggie dishes. We got the lamb kabsah which was served with the ubiquitous Yemeni chili sauce zhoug, and not-as-traditional mezze platter and stuffed grape leaves, served with the traditional flatbread.\n\nAs soon as I tasted the lamb I knew this was the real deal. It was tender, moist and well-spiced, and the rice was excellent - the flavor of the food triggered many memories of when my family was invited to generous meals in Yemeni houses. We'll have to try the mandi and salteh next (and the lamb soup which tends to be a Yemeni staple), preferably when both my parents are in town. \n\nThe owner is quite courteous as well, prices are extremely good for what you're getting, and the pictures are pretty much what you'd see in a true Yemeni restaurant. I'd complained often to the BF that a lot of restaurants purporting to serve authentic cuisine from Asia and the Mideast here seem to like to tone down their spiciness, perhaps to cater to a more Western crowd, but I was very happy to note that this restaurant has retained the flavor in its food.

It took about eight minutes after we were seated for them to realize that maybe we needed water. I asked the tittering preteen in charge for a vegetarian menu as they had one on display outside. My dinner date had to get up and ask the other girl for it about 12 minutes later. After an additional ten minutes of my death stare, it occurred to them to take our orders.\n\nThe food was mediocre. We had fatoosh, \"grape leaves\" (dolmas), and falafel wraps. I'm not a falafel snob, but the falafel in the mall is way better. \n\nI felt a bit sorry for the table next to us. She was allergic to garlic, and he was trying to find out what dishes could be made without garlic. The server didn't seem to understand or accommodate. Then the guy sitting alone at the table next to them started barking about how they could just order the cheese and olive plate and some bread and \"make a meal out of that.\" I thought that was pretty rude; having my own dietary restrictions, it's totally lame to have to settle on, like, a salad made only of iceberg lettuce at a restaurant, where they seemingly would be able to cook something to order. Plus, a garlic allergy is, to me, a fate worse than death.\n\nThat guy acted like he knew the \"working\" girls but wasn't really concerned with whether they were working, which they weren't unless you count snickering behind a screen and squealing about texts they were receiving and sending.\n\nWe waited 20 minutes or so for our check; my icy glare did nothing but exhaust my eyes.

This restaurant intrigued me for a long time, as I frequently drive past it. For some silly reason, I thought that I might feel out of place there or not understand the menu, but I got over that. I went there with 4 friends, one of whom spent time in the middle east and was able to offer some explanations of different food. I'm sure the servers could have done that, too, obviously... who, by the way, are most likely the teenage daughters of the owner & were very sweet. \n\nWe were pretty much the only people in the whole place (we were definitely the only white people). A couple of guys came in as we were leaving. I ordered the \"Foul Wrap\" (pronounced 'fool') which was spiced fava beans in a buttery flat bread - REALLY GOOD and only $6.95!!! The prices here are great. I also had the sahadiq (sp?), which was a very spicy feta cheese dip. Our table also ordered shawarma and a few other appetizers, and many side orders of the delicious flat bread - i forget what it is called. Everyone was satisfied.\n\nIt is halal and pretty much the only drink options are sodas. The owner came out and said hi to us, it is that kind of chill place where they have the time to do that. I bet the Yemeni community in SF has a lot of parties and special events here and thats how they manage to stay in business. Well, I found out that I really love fava beans from my dining experience here - definitely a good & useful discovery!!", "author": "Shannon R."}

The service was great the ladies were very friendly. We ordered the Meza platter that disappeared into our tummy within 5 minutes, no joke it was that good! We all wanted number 30 on the menu, it was rice, tomato lettuce cucumber salad and meat! Chicken, beef, pork. We ordered 3 orders of that and had them put it on a large platter for all of us to share. It was a delicious family feast! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the beef kebab, it had some spices I wasn't a fan of. We ordered a side of yogurt sauce(MUST GET) to dip our tasty meat in. To end the night we had this HEAVENLY dessert. Holy crappers! I love bread pudding..I don't remember the name of this but it was like french toast bread pudding it was amazing!! It had a crunch from the caramelized outside, nuts, dates, bananas, honey, yogurt sauce, moist. I am making myself drool right now. I was seriously in heaven I wanted to KISS the Chef!

Went for dinner -- restaurant was about a quarter full. Our waitress appeared to be around 16 years old, shy, inexperienced and poorly trained. She initially brought water and one menu, although we were three people. After we ordered she did not take the menus away. When our meza platter arrived, she forgot the bread. And so on it went. Meza were good (especially the warm dolmas) but rest of meal was average -- a Yemeni chicken and rice dish was bland, with a few small pieces of chicken still sporting rubbery, flabby skin and otherwise mostly rice. Koftas were slightly burnt, overly compacted and dry.  A Yemeni salad was fine.\n\nThere was sporadic running around visible in the doorway leading to the kitchen, and an overall sense of confusion and amateurishness that would have been forgivable had the food been memorable -- alas, on our visit, it wasn't.

The waitress was really nice, even though we didn't know what Yemin was, and did not know anything about their food or culture. We ordered the Taboleh (I think that's how it's spelled), Salta, this Yemin national dish, which was a sizzling stew in a clay pot, and an order of falafels. When we asked if they served alcohol, they did not, so we asked if we could bring some in. The waitress said it would be ok, so hubby ran out to the liquor store. While he was gone, the waitress moved me to the back of the restaurant, explaining that she did not want to offend anybody coming back from prayers. It turns out they're Muslim (I think), which means no alchi. :( \n\nThe food was amazing. I've never had Yemin food before, but it seemed similar to Indian food, but not as salty. They used natural spices, instead of salt. The stew came out sizzling, and the meat inside was so tender. The falafels were crispy, and we were told they were made fresh daily. The bread they used to dip was just OK.

The food is some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in San Francisco, but I received some of the worst service possible in this restaurant. The two male servers are very nice but the waitress I encountered was very very rude. They just opened up so the service is sub par, but the rudeness is just unnacceptable. I would advise you to speak to the two male servers because they are very friendly. Also, the prices they print on the menu are not correct, so if you do come here, ask for the price for everything you order before ordering them. Apparently it takes too much effort to print out a new menu.\n\nFirst of all, they served us the main dish first, then the appetizer, then our drinks. Shouldn't it be the other way around? When we ordered an additional dish, they forgot to cook it for us. When they realized this, they told us they did not have this dish, the Tandoori chicken, but had a similar dish, the Grilled Chicken. I asked if the price was the same and the waiter said yes. When we asked for the bill, they billed us $9 instead of $4 for the grilled chicken. When I told them that they said the dish was $4, the waitress went away and raised her voice and said to the other person she was working with, \"I tell everyone that the prices in the menu are wrong! They want to pay $4 for a huge dish, this dish is clearly not $4!\"\n\nThis is very unprofessional behavior because all the other customers in the restaurant could hear her complaints, including me. She did not even mention to me that the prices in the menu are different until after I ate the dishes.

It was a grilled beef that was exquisitely seasoned and prepared, with a bed of basmati rice. Large portions. \n\nAlso had a Spicy basmati rice casserole dish with marinated beef chunks (sorry, forgot name, maybe kabsah, #26? It had the option of beef or chicken). This beef was so tender, like beef brisket. Sooo addictive.\n\nLamb is a must have here. Tender, fragrant, not gamey b/c it is so well-prepped. The waitress recommended the lamb dish we had, a bone-in lamb (generous pieces of the rib section). Yummy!\n\nMy friends loved an okra dish we had here. Cooked well, not slimy like okra sometimes is.\n\nThe flatbread that comes with dishes like hummus is piping hot and freshly made. Everything was very fresh actually.\n*Tip: Don't refrigerate leftover bread. Keep it wrapped. Heat in oven at 350 degrees covered in foil for three-four minutes. Good as new!\n\nTry the hot tea if you like sweet cinnamon flavors.\n\nThe owner recommended a bread pudding  type dish for dessert that my friends loved. I saw mention of it in another yelper's review. Lovely dates and currants in it and interesting crunchy texture that western bread puddings don't have.\n\nI've been twice and both times were delicious. The restaurant sadly was pretty empty both times, but the few other diners there were raving about the food. The ambiance is casual - probably was a Chinese restaurant in a previous life. I will say it looks like the owner has done some remodeling in the last month - Chinese lanterns replaced with regular lamps. That's a good move. This is not a date spot by any stretch of the imagination - it's in the Tenderloin, so don't come here by yourself at night. (For those not familiar with what to expect in the Tenderloin: A random guy sat on the hood of my car and asked for $5 to \"watch\" it for me. If I weren't from Memphis, I would have been scared.)  If coming in the morning, call ahead to make sure they are open - once they weren't ready at 11:30am on a Friday, but maybe that was an off day. On this Friday morning, their doors were wide open.\n\nCome here if you want to try delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food at a reasonable price (entrees around $10-$14).", "author": "B B."}

Friend #1 got the Yemeni soup, which he reported to be good.  He also got a lamb dish that he barely picked at, even after a day of fasting.  Makes me think it wasn't very good.  Friend #2 got the equivalent of lamb chops and liked it, but I think his standards are pretty low.  I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, on my continued quest to find good shawarma in the city.  No luck!  It was wrong on so many levels.  Even the rice was not anywhere near authentic.  My friend got the Turkish coffee and he was served a dirty little mug, which I ended up cleaning for him. \n\nThe service: there were 2 waitresses, one who knew nothing about the dishes and spoke little English (the boys I was with guessed she was Russian) and another who was nice enough, but the service was still pretty bad.  \n\nSuffice it to say that I will not be returning and I will continue to search for good Arabic food in SF!", "author": "goph s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-15", "description": "I have no idea how I found this place.  I'm even more amazed because every time I try to go, I nearly miss it.  I think my boyfriend said that it was award-winning and of a cuisine of which we had not yet partaken and I said, \"Yea verily, omnomnom.\"  That's what I say to most dinner suggestions, come to think of it.\n\nI've been a couple times now, and it's never full.  There are only ever one or two other groups in the restaurant, and it's always nice and quiet.  The atmosphere is very casual, though I do like to stare at the carved wood throughout.  It's pretty, but also very homey.  The combination of decor and emptiness make it feel like Yemeni's Restaurant is really mine, and I like that.\n\nSo what's Yemeni food like, you may ask?  Well, it's surprisingly like other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food.  You have your large, mostly-flat, delightfully-somewhat-charred-but-otherwise-squishy bread, your hummus, dolmades, yogurt sauce, tabouleh, baba ganoush, etc.  In fact, if you get the mezza plate, you can get all of those things!  And also the \"mossaka,\" which is sort of like a cross between what you normally think of as \"moussaka\" without the bechamel, and baba ganoush.  It's really, really good.  I always fill up on this stuff and then remember that I have a main dish coming.  And as good as these little treats are, the entrees are where it's at.  You can get your standard couscous, kebabs, or schawerma, and those are all good.  But!  If you want to be really legit, you should get the Yemeni national dish, or the foul.  I don't recall what all is in the national dish, but it comes to you in a stone pot, bubbling away.  You can have it vegetarian or with lamb, and it's about the most comforting meal you could have - except for the foul.  Foul is a traditional Middle Eastern dish containing fava beans, tomatoes, a ton of garlic, and not a ton of oil.  It also contains joy, rainbows, and sunshine.  Really.  I looked back in the kitchen and saw jars labeled with all those things.  And once you taste it, you'll see that's the only possible way it could taste so good.  It's filling-but-healthy, and just feels really good to eat.  Scoop it up with huge hunks of that awesome flatbread, and feel the warmth penetrate.\n\nIn addition to being a quiet place, Yemeni's Restaurant is also a friendly place.  They have a vegetarian menu for which you'll need to ask, but the servers happily provides that and anything else you'd like.  More bread?  Certainly!  More bread to go with your leftovers?  That's fine, too.  The service isn't always very prompt but since you're probably going to be the only one in there, you can't necessarily expect them to be perpetually on their toes.  I've never had to wait any amount of time that was unreasonable, either.  And really, this isn't a place you want to go to in a hurry, anyway.  Enjoy the private dining, the hot food, and the friendly ambiance.  Siddown.  Stay a while.  Gorge.  Repeat.", "author": "Becca S."}

She likes spicy food and is rarely served dishes that she finds hot enough for her taste. I'm a spice wimp -- I took one bite and was glad I'd gotten a kebob!\n\nMy husband said his shawarma was pretty average and I'd say the same about my kebob. But the whole table raved about our appetizer combo platter (baba ghanous, hummus, tabouleh, and yogurt/cucumber sauce--I think of it as raita even though it probably has a special Yemeni name). Everything was fantastic. The hummus especially stood out: silky, tangy, much MUCH better than the bland chickpea paste you often get. The baba ghanous was comparable to what you get at A La Turca, which is my gold standard for the stuff, and the fluffy, nutty-tasting bread is very good too: it's more rustic than what they serve at A La Turca, I think it has a higher proportion of whole grains, which is good. My son loved it, and the servers brought out more whenever we were running low.\n\nI was really surprised at how good the raita was, because normally I can take or leave the stuff. I wonder if they use a special yogurt as the base? We all enjoyed the appetizers so much that we also ordered a plate of olives and a plate of cheese, two bucks each for good-sized little plates. \n\nWe'll definitely come back to Yemeni's. The dining space is nice and inviting, if you can get over the cheesy Chinese lanterns left over from the previous owners. We liked the young international crowd that the restaurant seems to attract. Next time we come I'm really tempted to make a small-plates meal out of the appetizers, since they're so good and very reasonably priced.", "author": "Shannon P."}

My friend got Salteh, which was pretty damn good, but not spicy at all. I want to say we got the Fattoush as an appetizer, but whatever it was, none of us could stop eating that stuff!!! The tea was awesome. My friends BF got one of the lamb dishes, which I didn't like as much, but it was still good.", "author": "Ken L."}

The Maza platter is a great appetizer that has all your favorites to put on their fresh flat-bread.  It's a meal in itself. For dinner we had the mixed grill platter which comes with chicken, lamb, rice and salad.  For $24 it's an amazing meal that will fill up two people and you get to try almost everything on the menu.

Something for everyone here, from carnivore to vegetarian. Beautifully prepared, generous portions. The tab shockingly low! Service is a little rough around the edges, but the staff are all helpful and friendly. The mixed BBQ platter - chicken, lamb kebab and lamb kibbe - superb. Meza platter - to die for! Fresh-baked tandoor bread, so yummy! For dessert, try the layered Yemeni flat bread, buttered and drizzled with honey. Splendid!!!! Can't wait to go back next time I'm in SF. We ate there 2 nights in a row--no reason to go elsewhere! They don't serve alcohol, so get your pre- and post-dinner libations across the street at the Fly bar.", "author": "Jennie M."}

I tried it just tonight, and have to say that the food is pretty good and the service is fast.  I had a very nice young lady as my waitperson, and she is a native English speaker.  Not that it should matter or not, but it is convenient for those who want to get further explanation about what is on the menu.\n\nBut this place seems to be a bit mismanaged in other areas.  When I first came in, I was greeted and seated right away... but there were no menus available.  Wha?  They couldn't seem to drum one up for several minutes, and at one point one of the waiters came over and asked if I wanted to order without one.  Wha ??  How can I know what to order without a menu?\n\nThe rice wrapped grape leaves was $3.50 and very, very small.  The saving grace for the whole meal was the fact that I ordered the combo grill special as my entree, which was good.  It had kefta, beef, and chicken, all deliciously grilled and tasty on a bed of rice, all with a salad on one plate.\n\nThe prices here are reasonable, though I can't recommend the sides like the dolma... I'd stick with the entrees.\n\nI am a fast eater, and the waitress asked if I was done when I still had a bit of food left on my plate.  I like that she is efficient and quick, but some eaters might be annoyed by it.  Personally, I don't mind, but take note.  \n\nAnd at the end, when I paid in cash, they had absolutely no coins in change, so they just bumped my bill down to the nearest dollar.  It was a bit strange, because I've never heard of a moderately priced restaurant having no change whatsoever.\n\nI still tipped my waitperson well, because she was nice and the food was pretty decent.  And it did come out very, very fast, which I always like.  Maybe I'll give it another try, but I have to say that I think that Aicha a few blocks down might be a bit better overall, despite the seemingly higher prices.", "author": "Dave N."}

I'm so disappointed that I did hit this place up sooner. I wanted to try pretty much every dip on the menu and was prepared to pay $3 each but, when I asked the server, she said the have an off-the-menu appetizer sampler for $8.95. We ordered that and it came with hummus, baba, cucumber/yogurt sauce, tabbouleh, and flat bread. The flat bread is fresh and awesome!! I was in love with their babaganouj and am usually pretty judgemental about it. It was garlicky and had a little extra spice (not heat) that I couldn't put my finger on - but I loved. We also got the spicy cheese appetizer (i wish I could remember what it's called but it has Zahaweg in it) - it was really delicious. We got two entrees. The first was a lamb dish (it's also the first item on the menu but I can't remember the name. It was served with flavorful rice and spiced veggies for $8.95. I had the leftovers for lunch today. YUM. The second was the Salteh with meat and bread. I think this, the baba, and the cheese were my favorite things. The Salteh had pieces of lamb in it along with vegetables in a flavorful green broth. It's served in a clay pot, still boiling, and looks like a witch's cauldron with the green bubbles on top. \n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone and definitely grab a takeout menu if they have them. The ambiance here is not amazing but the people are friendly and the food is cheap and delicious!", "author": "Natalie G."}

A friend and I decided to try it. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is definitely decent, a step up from competing TL places having a similar type of food. The person greeting us (we ignorantly assume) was from Yemen and overly polite which us grumpy Americans don't come across too often. (nice change)\n\nWe sit down and start to contemplate the menu. This was the first menu I have struggled with in quite a long time so we had plenty of questions for the waitress. \n\nWe ordered the recommended Salteh with Lamb and the Mixed appetizer plate. The appetizer plate was nice with some of the better dips around.  \n\nThe Salteh arrived and it was something very different than what I/we was envisioning. We did our very best to give it a fair chance at a good review. But to tell you the truth, it was not anything I would ever order again. It was a bit on the (welcomed) spicy side and kind of like a potato soup colored green. No fireworks when it comes to flavor is what I am trying to say. The restaurant must of got our order wrong because there was no lamb in the dish at all.\n\nThe thing that bothered us was the carafe of water they bring to the table. They put cucumber, and lemon slices in it.  My friend who does this at home noticed immediately that there was no taste to the water and without a doubt there should have been. He suspects they are filling the carafes and not replacing the slices. In other words, our first water came, the slices looked all worn out (not freshly cut), and the water had no taste. That is, we suspect the taste from the slices were used up by previous customers then we walked in and took over the same water carafe.\n\nI guess, all in all, the place was not a repeat for us only because of that.  Maye next year we will try it again and give them a chance to tune things.", "author": "Jon I."}

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. This place recently opened, and we are really rooting for it to take off.\nOur waiter was extremely sweet, and seemed like he was still learning the ropes, but we asked him for suggestions and he was very helpful and polite.\nWe had an appetizer salad that was very fresh and light, with Sahawiq cheese with bread. The cheese was awesome! It wasn't too cheesy, it was more of a spicy sauce with bits of fresh feta cheese.\nMy husband had the Yemeni Salteh with lamb and bread. It came out in a black cast iron pot, and was still at a roaring boil. It was full of flavor and the lamb was so tender. There were also some veggies in it (more of a stew). \nI had the Kufta plate. The plate had spiced meatballs of lamb (and maybe some beef), on top of rice, and a side of veggies (which I thought needed a pinch of salt). The meatballs were soooooo good! \nWe will definitely be back for dinner. \nAlso, the interior is much nicer than I thought it would be.", "author": "Debbie R."}
