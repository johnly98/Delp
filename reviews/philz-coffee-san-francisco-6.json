Good often takes a remarkably long time, and they no longer seem to call out when a food order is done, or check whether you're eating in or taking away, so sometimes you will return to the counter after fifteen minutes to find three bagels wrapped up and you have to ask them which is which. \n\nI'd now rather go somewhere else on 24th or in the Castro, unless this place is really quiet.", "author": "Dominique G."}

Sure, I didn't brush my hair. And maybe I rubbernecked as I walked in, having never been to this location before. Where do I make my order? Where is the menu?\n\nWe locked eyes, so I went toward her. \"Do you guys have hot chocolate?\"\n\nI don't care what she heard me say. I don't even care how she perceived me. She was simply rude. Rude. Rude, with her smirk and \"WHAT?\" An attitude I did not anticipate given my question. My fight or flight kicked in. It shouldn't have, and maybe I should've taken the high road, or given her a hug. Perhaps, she was having a bad day. I repeated myself in a tone of voice and volume no one would've missed. \n\nI just wanted a hot chocolate and to do work with friends. Now I have a second story (first was at Gracias Madre) of going into a boogie, pretentious place and having to repeat myself because an employee made a judgment about me before they heard me speak. \n\nBTW, this girl thought I asked if they had a driveway. Even if I had asked that, there was no need for the gross attitude. \n\nShe didn't make my drink, so I would've tipped.

This place was pretty packed on a Sunday, but we were lucky to find parking right across the street. As always, I finished my Mint Mojito iced coffee in a jiffy! Always my go to, and an instant cup of happiness. It's pretty difficult for me to order anything else, so I decided to get a second cup to share with my friend. I ordered the highly recommended Tesora. Which had hints of butter and caramel. She made it creamy just like the Mint Mojito so of course I loved it. Just what you needed on a cold rainy day. \n\nThe atmosphere was alright. I really enjoyed looking at the paintings on the wall. They were scenic yet abstract, just something about them was inspiring. I actually was very tempted in buying one. The music on the other hand was blasting pretty loudly that it was hard to think, so my friend and I ended up having to relocate. \n\nDriving out I realized that I totally forgot to pay for my last cup of coffee!! So I called them immediately to ask if they could take my credit card over the phone. They were so nice about it and said it's fine and can always just pay next time I was there. That's some genuine honest customer service right there. Makes the coffee taste even better on that regard.", "author": "Cindy C."}

Yes, some of the locations can be quite hipster-ish, but I've never felt weird or intimidated or out of place. A guy, who was there with his family, came back to the barista who I just placed my order with and she asked him if there was anything she needed to adjust for him.

That said, this was the only pleasant thing about this location after I saw the way the staff treated every customer who dared purchase a coffee while walking their dogs. First there was an awkward staff member greeting all dog owners outside the minute their dog even made a sound, and then this obnoxious hand written sign outside urging customers to tell the barista their order -presumably from the door if their dog was expected to bark even once while they went inside - their order, pay quickly and await their coffee outside. In my case, I paid quickly and waited at a bench outside for 10 minutes- no coffee. I inquired from the door and the staff members looked at each other as if confused before confessing they had no idea what I'd ordered. They didn't ask me how I wanted it and brought me out a black Tesora. I then told the staff member that I had asked for vanilla soy and sweetener. She replied, \"No problem\" very sarcastically with a plastered on smile and returned, pet my dog and went in. \nHonestly, why would anyone open a coffee shop in a neighborhood that doesn't welcome even the presence of dogs OUTSIDE?!

Also, I appreciate how the baristas here are always friendly and never let the stress of a long line of customers get to them. Great job, guys! The only reason why I'm giving this location 4 stars instead of 5 is because there isn't much space to sit and work; you have to get there early if you want to post up and study or work.", "author": "Yvette L."}

My usual is the one in Mission (where I believe the customer service is excellent.) We were in Noe Valley and decided to bring my parents who were visiting by for a coffee. The coffee was not the issue. My dad (who has never been to Philz) picked up the wrong coffee and started drinking it thinking it was his. Long story short... instead of the staff saying \"no problem at all\" and just correcting the issue, they made him feel almost stupid. I witnessed this and was appalled. As a person who's had customer service experience you never make the customer feel this way. They acted dumbfounded and annoyed like this hasn't happened before. I felt really bad for him and the way he was treated while visiting his daughter. I was embarrassed that the city I love and a place I usually love had staff that didn't know how to react kindly to a customers mistake.

I was expecting a really pretentious vibe, but I got the complete opposite. It's actually very low key. The staff were very friendly and helpful. \n\nMy iced mint mojito iced coffee was AMAZING. Seriously, the best iced coffee I've ever had. I was really skeptical, because I've been lead astray by a few rave reviews about coffee houses on Yelp, but not this time. \n\nApparently every cup is made by hand, one at a time. It shows. My drink was phenomenal. There was fresh sprigs of mint as garnish and at the bottom of my cup. The flavor might sound odd, but it was refreshing, slightly sweet, creamy and still had a really good, mellow coffee taste. \n\nI also tried a vanilla scone and it was also really good. Scones seem hard to fuck up, but this scone was exceptionally good--not too dry, not too sweet, not too dense. \n\nAfter finishing my small coffee I toyed with the idea of going to another Philz for a second cup.

The coffee is made one cup at a time and they can add sugar and cream for you. The experience is strange since they don't have typical espresso drinks and I'm used to adding my own sugar and cream (if I'm in the mood, usually I prefer black). \n\nThe baked goods (croissants, muffins, scones, kouign amann) come from Starter Bakery of Oakland.

I then walked over the to cashier to pay for my beverage and sat back to wait for my order.   Each cup is prepared to order so expect a bit of a wait for your coffee.  When it was ready the barista asked me to try it immediately and if it wasn't to my liking, she would make me another one.  Now THAT is service!

I asked if they had any non-dairy options for the gingersnap coffee. The girl behind the counter couldn't remember if they had non-dairy options. 'Like almond milk?' Yes, like almond milk. That would be fine. And then ensued a two minute conversation about how she can't remember which is dairy and which isn't. I said, 'Milk is dairy. Everything else is non-dairy.' She was all, oh yeah, teehee. It was unbelievable. Was she wasted? One of the other guys, clearly the manager, came over and spoke past her mumbling and fumbling, said yes, they can do almond for the drink. Great. Ordered it. How sweet do I want it? I don't know, medium?\n\nFive minutes later she hands me a drink with so much clove in it that the tip of my tongue went numb. There was no sugar in it. I handed it back for a little sugar. She put maybe a teaspoon in, said to taste it. I decided, fuck this, I'll drink it, it's good enough. \nI swear she was tripping her face off from last night's acid. \n\nThe other guy, the one who wasn't tripping, and wasn't the manager, made my bagel.

Without really realizing it, I became accustomed to a certain level of quality and flavor in my coffee beverages. This can be disappointing to forget when you travel and expect coffee to be good - I couldn't seem to find the good coffee in NYC no matter how hard I tried, so I'm a little wary of the coffee in foreign cities, even the big ones.\n\nWhen I first arrived in SF, my temporary apartment was across the street from a Philz. From the looks of the logo (I'm superficial?) I thought the place was going to be like a chain Peet's-style coffee joint. I was hesitant, especially after all my bad coffee experiences in other cities, so I consulted Yelp. Yelp people say it's amazing, so I tried it.\n\nHoly @#)(*@#. I thought I had already tasted the best coffee of my life, but upon my first sip of a creamy, sweetened cup of Philharmonic, I realized I hadn't until now! I know this is a really dramatic review, but I'm being serious. It was show-stoppingly delicious and I've been hooked ever since. I prefer Philz to all the hip, Seattle-esque espresso places SF boasts about like Blue Bottle and Ritual, etc. It's just more my thing, I suppose.\n\nNow I live near the Noe Valley Philz, and I head over there a few times a week for a large Philharmonic. It's so good, I have a hard time ordering anything else, though I have tried the Jacob's Wonderbar and Tesora, which are also good but not as special as the Philharmonic blend, which they add cardamom to. I've actually started adding cardamom to my (Philz) coffee at home because it's so comforting and delicious.\n\nSo yeah. I'm a huge fan of Philz. The Noe Valley shop is really chill. I always find a nearby parking spot and usually get a table when I need one, else I just read outside on a bench. The people working here are extremely friendly and there are lots of babies and dogs around. Love it.\n\n\nPS: if you're unaffected by copious amounts of sugar, definitely try a donut with your coffee. I like the regular glazed ones. They go so well with the coffee.

It's better than your Tazo tea bags, but it's on the same playing field as your loose leave teas from any Chinese tea shop. So, if you're at a Philz, don't waste your energy ordering green teas, and just go ahead and treat yourself to a mint mojito. You'll be a happier person!", "author": "Mabel Y."}

I love the unique choices they have and probably my favorite is the Mocha Tesora. Every time we're in San Francisco, we make sure we get our coffee here plus the drive down the hill is just fun, it's like riding in a roller coaster!! The staff is really nice. I remember when I first came here that I don't know what I'm getting and they just asked me what I was in the mood for and suggested the Mocha Tesora. The place is nicely decorated and it's not too crowded either. That's why I rather go to a locally owned coffee shop that doesn't rush you to order and worst get pissed that you are taking so much of your time. I love everything about their interior, quality and their inexpensive price as well, down to the staff.I love that they the temperature for the coffee is perfect,unlike the mainstream coffee shops that make sure you won't appreciate taste for a couple of days  This location is my favorite.

Now I've given a fair number of 5-star reviews, but let me just say that this is one of the more solid of those, a legit 5.0 if you expand the rating points system to an additional significant figure.\n\nNow I've been a Philz fan for awhile.  I've been to 6 different locations and of course was into it waaaaaay before it was cool (no hipster).  This new location is perhaps the best yet.  The vibe in the place is great, the staff is extremely friendly, it's far enough out of the way that it doesn't get that crowded, and of course it has Philz coffee.  If that last part doesn't mean anything to you, read on, because it should.  \n\nIt's hard to put into words how much better Philz is than, say, Starbucks.  I think some comparisons from classic comedies will give you some perspective.  Let's just say that Starbucks is that crappy house party you threw that nobody came to and Philz is the F**KING CATALINA WINE MIXER.  In the coffee world, Philz is pretty much Veronica Vaughn (soooo hot, want to touch the hiney) and other places are Principal Max Anderson.  In more discrete terms, the coffee is bursting with flavor, has little acidity, and is exceedingly smooth.  Just trust me that it has the best coffee any place that has a significant presence in the Bay Area.  If you haven't had it, you should get it now, even if it means selling your dead bird to a blind kid, trading in your sheepdog van for a moped, and driving all the way to Aspen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "So this rather unfortunate, but absolutely hilarious and somewhat sweet story/review is mainly for the super nice barista with the glasses and (pink? some kind of bright color) streaks in her hair.\n\nIt was Valentine's Day, and probably one of the most memorable starts to any Valentine's Day I've had. I was suffering from a MASSIVE hangover due to the craziness of the previous night. I wanted some coffee and my Valentine suggested we go to Philz since he's never been and wanted to try the iced mint mojito everyone raves about. We walked in and this particular barista greeted us very warmly and had such a bubbly personality. She highly suggested that we get the iced mint mojitos super creamy and sweet since it's her favorite, and so we did. \n\nSo while we waited for our drinks, he decided to sit near the back at the only table with the two high chairs. We sat down and I immediately noticed the table top was pretty wobbly....that should've already been a red flag to switch to a different table. But we stayed anyway. \n\nWe heard our drinks being called and he got up to retrieve them. He handed me my drink and I immediately started sipping on it. So let me point out that my beverage had been in my hands the moment he handed me my cup. I DID NOT SET MY DRINK DOWN ON THE TABLE AT ALL. He, on the other hand, took ONE SIP and then made the biggest mistake of setting his drink down (with no hands for support) and slightly leaning his arms on the table. \n\nNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT seriously appeared in slow motion for me. I see the table lean towards him and his cup wobbling back and forth, deciding whether or not to tip over. The coffee gods decided to be mean so the cup was pretty much leaning over towards him...and of course he wasn't paying attention. At this point, I had a flash of the epic spilldown that was about to ensue. Again, picture SLOW-MO: I reached my hand out to try to grab his cup whilst screaming, \"NooOOOoOOOOOoo!\" but was a little too late....and all I could see was his terrified facial expression and his coffee spill all over his pants and shoes as well as hear loud splatters of coffee and ice hit the ground (again...in SLOW-MO). All I could do was put my non-cup-holding-hand over my mouth in total shock. Horrified, he rushed to the bathroom to clean himself up. Little side note: This was probably our 3rd date together and I know he was trying really hard to make a good impression....so I know this catastrophe was pretty embarrassing for him. But as bad as I felt, I couldn't help but get a huge kick out of it hahahahha. I know, I'm horrible. \n\nANYWAYS, BACK TO THE AWESOME BARISTA. So he finally came out of the bathroom after 15 minutes and we sat down (at a different table obviously). There was a brief moment of silence....I could just see the embarrassment in his face and so I tried comforting him. Shortly afterwards, the same barista came out and personally handed him a freshly made iced mint mojito!!! He kept saying that he was sorry and that she didn't have to do that, and she replied (not exactly verbatim), \"IF I SAW AN ICED MINT MOJITO SPILL ALL OVER THE GROUND, I WOULD BE HEARTBROKEN! ABSOLUTELY HEARTBROKEN! SO PLEASE, LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU!\" Instant five stars right there for this barista being a damn rockstar!!! \n\nSo about 30 minutes after the fiasco, we finally got to enjoy our beverages together. I couldn't help but replay the event in slow-mo in my mind so I kept laughing to myself (and at him ahhahha). But hey, at least it cured my hangover AND he won another date with me - so not all was lost ;) \n\nMoral of the story: Avoid the table with the two high chairs.\n\nUPDATE: Less than 2 months after my posting of this review, I find out he's actually a complete d-bag (go figure!) I no longer feel bad about laughing hysterically in his face. *drops mic", "author": "Tee C."}

Another difference between this and the Noe Valley location is that one feels quite the pretentious place to be in. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it was an off day but c'mon dont make a sly remark that it'll take you awhile to make a drink even if it does plus exacerbate the situation when you leave in the middle of making the drink to take your break and hand it off to a coworker. \n\nFrom all the other Philz Coffees, this is by far the cleanest and that alone earns it a star. My friend counted people diligently working on 11 different Macbook Pros while the only diligent thing I noticed in the SJ location was students and regular ol'folks getting their caffeine high.  What stood out the most was the famed mint mojito iced coffee in Noe Valley tasted like a plain iced coffee you can purchase for a cheaper price at your local Starbucks.

It feels more about taking time out to enjoy every sip and not rush in and out. Their pastries are self serve and in a case of their own which was great too! I love that they have fresh mints and herbs and ingredients and I can't wait to try more beverages from their menu!", "author": "Julian I."}

I've been to the one in the Castro and the one on Berry Street. This one is kind of tucked away in Noe Valley. Parking is a huge thing for me and parking around here wasn't difficult. Very easy to find parking and I thought it was nice that there was a park across the street. I didn't have a difficult time finding a seat to do some work at, but it can get busy it looks like. However, this one has more tables then the one on Berry, which has more couches and compared to the one on Castro, this one is much larger as the one on Castro only has maybe 3 indoor tables? Anyways, if you do decide to do work there I would bring headphones at least because it can kind of get out due to the fact that everyone loves this place. There are a few outlets, but it's not a ton. Staff is very nice and very quick. I think I found my new go to work cafe here!", "author": "Julie L."}

I felt so dumb, but then, I felt really pissed off. I asked another barista, an angel by the name of Emily, and she helped me out and assured me that not all of their staff there were pretentious and profiling baristas. I mean, I am paying customer promoting their business to my friends and family, I don't think anyone deserves that kind of treatment.

They were so nice and especially Rory who was patient and explained the whole thing and gave her recommendations and was just wonderful.  I highly recommend the Mojito Mint Iced Coffee.", "author": "J W."}

Being a novice coffee drinker, I appreciated their friendly, non-pretentious attitude and willingness to give advice on a great cup. They were willing to customize it however I liked, asking what type of milk, how sweet, how hot even. Watch out - their coffee is STRONG. They also had complimentary dog treats and offered to bring my coffee curbside so I could wait outside with my anxious pooch. I'll be back!", "author": "Katie R."}
