I felt the ingredients were much better and they have tofu as free topping! I don't see tofu as a common topping. There's always seem to one lady working there. The free yelp check in for miso soup was a little on salty side but it did have chunks of tofu and seaweed inside this time around. Last time it didn't have much ingredients. It's a very laid back and easy going tiny environment. I pretty much ordered tuna and salmon with ginger sauce which was really tasty and I just loaded it with toppings I would enjoy.

It's a quaint, little shop with only three tables with some fake plants. To order, you grab a sheet on your left as you enter. It's pretty straight forward with steps to choose your size, base, protein, sauce, sides, and toppings. It made it easy to order without the pressure of standing in front of the server choosing what you wanted, so I liked that. I ordered the large bowl ($12.50) with almost every topping. I do like that there's so many add-ons here. Despite that, I was quite disappointed from the poke bowl. There was hardly any sauce in my fish despite choosing heavy. I even had to ask for extra ponzu sauce on the side, but didn't make much difference. So if you're looking for plain raw fish, here you go. The rice was also pretty hard, which could've helped if there was more sauce infused into it.\n\nTip: Free miso soup with a Yelp check-in, although the miso soup was a bit watered down.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

I walked into a tiny little spot, filled with a few tables and chairs, and a poke bar at the front where the person creates each bowl. There is paper and pencil right next to the door for each person to check off what they want in their poke bowl. I would imagine that this place may have customers lining up outside the door since the place is so small.\n\nI hope this place makes a few changes, because I was not impressed at all. What's different about this place is that they put the rice and the poke next to each other in a to-go box. Usually the poke is on top of the rice. However, the presentation of it all put together looks quite appealing.\n\nDon't be fooled, it looks better than it tastes.\nI ordered: a small scoop of brown rice topped with seaweed salad, masago, green onion, avocado, mango, and corn\nnext to it was: tuna + salmon with spicy mayo mixed with carrots, edamame, onion and cucumber.\n\nThe brown rice was so dry and unappetizing. I took 2 bites and didn't bother eating the rest. The fish tasted fresh, yet bland even with the spicy mayo sauce tossed in. The sauce simply tasted like mayo with no flavor. The toppings made up for the lack of taste. However, paying $1 extra for avocado was not worth it. They gave me a few pieces, but I don't think it was enough to pay $1 extra for.\n\nThe bowl gives you enough food to satisfy your hunger, but I don't think it's worth paying a little over $10 for mediocre poke.", "author": "Rachelle Y."}

My friend would always suggest Park 77 (now The Lister), a college bar in the Parkmerced Plaza for us to meet up at. He was always adamant about going there and we always declined. \"Y'all are missing out,\" he would tell us. \n\nAfter watching Bar Rescue...I found out what we were missing: porn. Apparently, some porn scenes took place at Park 77 (links to videos are NSFW): http://bit.ly/2aAurtB. Damn you, why didn't you just tell us this in the first place? \n\nSome \"friend\". \n\n*HUFFS*\n\nI heard that a new poke eatery just opened up over the weekend, and after google mapping the address, I realized it was in Parkmerced Plaza near SFSU. The plaza can be very confusing to get to but Waze steered me in the correct direction. There's also a grocery store, Papa Murphy's, a taqueria, Hall of Flame Burgers (highly recommended), and The Lister in the plaza. \n\nPoke Kana is currently in their soft opening phase and is the newest BYO poke bowl eatery in San Francisco. Price is determined by the number of protein scoops: 2 - $8.99, 3 - $10.50, and 4 - $11.99. They have the same bases (white rice, brown rice, organic greens), fish (salmon, tuna, scallop, crab), sides (cucumber, corn, edamame, tofu, etc), sauces (shoyu, unagi, spicy mayo, etc) and toppings (wakame, onion, masago, sesame seeds, etc) like most other poke eateries. Avocado is +$1 but if you check-in on Yelp, it's free. Cc's accepted. \n\nI stopped by on my way home from bringing Tater Tot to the vet, and I ordered my usual that I do at other poke eateries, Salmon & Crab Poke Bowl w/ brown rice, all veggies, all toppings, spicy mayo (4 scoops protein - $11.99): http://bit.ly/2aFQlcz. \n\n: : P R O S ::\n*Friendly employees. \n*Very clean. Didn't see cross-contamination issues with food bins. \n*Salmon was in large chunks, fresh, and buttery. \n*Veggies were fresh, crisp, and good quality. \n*Brown rice was properly cooked. \n*They use a two compartment, compostable containers so the warm rice and cold proteins don't touch! This is the first poke eatery in SF to use the two compartment containers. Yay, thank you! \n*No msg in the sauces, I usually have an msg reaction when I eat at nearby Poke Bowl (Daly City and Ocean Avenue).\n\n: : C O N S ::\n*Heavy handed with the sauces so request \"light\". \n*The protein-to-rice ratio was really off. In my pic, it may look like a huge portion but it was from the veggies and the shredded surimi. I had to fish for the salmon (they use a tiny ice cream scoop that fits like 2-3 chunks). They really need to beef up the amount of protein they provide.\n*The crab was surimi, faux crab. It's counted as a protein but at other poke eateries, it's counted as a free topping. \n*Tiny portion of avocado: 3 small chunks. I would have been livid if I had to pay $1 for this. \n*Need to offer crunchy topping option like fried garlic or crushed macadamia nuts for some texture. \n\nPoke Kana has done a great job renovating the dry cleaning service that was previously here. There's only 3 two top tables but it's very contemporary, clean, and lots of natural lighting coming in from the windows.\n\nThere's easy parking in the private lot.\n\nPoke Bar in the Twitter building is my current go-to favorite since I work nearby and they're generous with their proteins. Once Poke Kana works out their kinks and fix their small protein-to-rice ratio, they could easily rank in my top 5 poke eateries in SF.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The spicy mayo reminded me of a faint thousand island dressing that was not very appetizing. I also got a scoop of salmon and tuna. The sauce was so overpowering that it masked the taste of the fish. \n\nIt seems like the place is still fairly new and can work to master their flavors. I probably won't be back to try it. \n\nI also strongly recommend they invest in window blinds. Depending on the time of day, it gets pretty warm from the blistering sunlight that shoots directly into the store.

It wasn't too expensive for it. Although the drink was great, I wished they could've opened it better for me; they broke my coconut and it starting leaking. If you check in on yelp, make sure to grab the miso soup because they will try to play you and not get it for you.

I've tried a few others around the city and wasn't really impressed, but this one really got me. Their bowls are a little over $11 and unlike other poke spots, they give you a decent amount of fish. The restaurant is clean and hip. In addition to the heap of raw fish, the great service really sets this spot apart from other poke shops.", "author": "Raquel S."}

My first day I came the portions was Great and hearty. Lots of fish and veggies. The 2nd day there was barely any salmon and tuna when I ordered the 3 scoops. (Both days ordered the exact same thing). I had like 1 cherry tomato when the other day there's was like 6... *i love tomatoes* but yea. The 2nd day was like dam what happened???!!!  There portions should be more consistent. For a new business to attract more customers and existing ones they should have good hearty portions for their customers to be happy! That's my only issue. Other than that good place.", "author": "Dong H."}

The miso soup was room temperature. The bowl itself had really dry brown rice (not the sticky kind but long grain). Really subpar. \nWould think twice before coming here.", "author": "Jacklyn L."}

All ingredients were very fresh. Also, they were very friendly providing help to those that needed it when ordering. The place is mainly designed as take out, however it has a few small tables. We will definitely be frequenting this place.", "author": "Gabriel V."}

The miso soup tasted fresh.  Small eat-in area decorated with selections of IKEA furniture & accessories.  Recyclable/compostable take out cutlery & containers.  Expect to spend about $10 for a meal with beverage.", "author": "Judith B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-04", "description": "I came across this place after my run around Lake Merced. I ordered the 2 scoops of fish salad bowl, The fish is very fresh, both tuna and salmon with the spicy mayo sauce, portions wise might be a little small but considering how much I paid and the quality I got from it is way worth more than the others I have tried. Their miso soup is also great, taste like homemade, I could tell it didn't contain any MSG in it and also in low sodium.", "author": "HappyFridays H."}

I paid $ 11 for tiny plastic container and when I came home and opened it it was scoop of salad and 2 tiny pieces of fish! And it locates between 'Dos Charros\" and \"Hall of flame\" where you can buy real good salad in big container! Never again!", "author": "Sonia Y."}

As a poki place, you're biggest objective should be ensuring that you are serving fresh fish and this just did not meet the standards. It gave my girlfriend and I pretty bad stomach aches. We won't be coming back.", "author": "Andrew D."}

I am an avid poke eater and always love trying new spots around the city. Currently, I'a Poke is my go-to when I get the craving, however that might be changing soon! Right off the bat, once I walked into Poke Kana I was greeted by a worker and made small talk with me. He waited patiently for me to fill out my form, rang me up for my bowl (that totaled a little above 11 dollars) and promptly began making my bowl. Contrary to other reviews, the portions of fish and veggies were very generous. My bowl was prepared quickly and had a very nice aesthetic. I walked out a very happy customer. Compared to other poke places around the city and in DC I think the prices are very fair for the quality of fish and abundance of food I was given. The only reason Im reluctant to give 5 stars is because they're brand new and I think theres always room for improvement! I'll definitely be back soon.", "author": "Laurel H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-04", "description": "Small poke shop in a location nearby to Uhaul; this place grabbed my attention as I was returning my rental to the Cambon Drive Uhaul, and thinking about a fast bite of food. There was no line when I arrived, however the order protocol and staff seem to be efficient enough to handle some volume during peak hours. My order consisted of a rice bowl with four scoops of spicy tuna, avocado, and some toppings and sauces, plus a bottle of water, which came to $15. Having worked in a big city it seems on par the cost of a nice lunch, generally. I recognized most of the ingredients from patronage of another poke shop. The raw tuna was diced small, stirred into the chili and sauces, and served a bit below room temperature. The temperature of the raw fish seemed appetizing, yet sufficiently chilled for safe handling. Great experience, and I will be back when I am I the area and looking for a fast, tasty poke meal.", "author": "Justin B."}
