Decided to grab two beers: a Trumer Pils and a Bass Ale. There was one bartender who was nice and attentive. There were only a few customers, so it wasn't too busy.

Everyone knows that San Francisco can get quite cold at night. \n\n3. The low noise level. See #1. Very easy to maintain a conversation while speaking in a normal voice.\n\n4. Friendly service.

With fire!, 2) in the half-hour we were there, Queen, Prince and MJ all played on the jukebox (give that DJ a raise! haha), 3) pinball machines including AC/DC pinball, WHAT! and 4) the bar has got my name all over it.

The drinks are strong and reasonably-priced, the bartenders are all wonderful as it's entirely family-owned and operated, and the atmosphere ranges from raucous and loud to super chill and quiet depending on the time of day and day of week. It's got something for everyone.\n\nThey recently spruced the place up and rearranged, adding a few super cool, old-school pinball machines. They have a total of four now, which is remarkable in such a small place. The bar also has an internet jukebox, so you can jam to whatever you want while enjoying a beer or a martini (served with shaker glass and enough for 2 additional pours). \n\nSummer Place no longer allows smoking inside, which is actually a plus for me. I know it is a drawback if you're a smoker, but it's in a nice neighborhood and there's a great sidewalk outside. Best of all, you never have to worry about the status of your drink while it's waiting for your return atop the bar, because this is a true neighborhood place and even the weirdos aren't creeps. This is one of the few places in the city I can go alone for a drink and not worry about being bothered by other patrons.\n\nBottom line: I've been to tons of SF divey/neighborhood bars, and Summer Place one is easily my favorite.", "author": "Meredith S."}

I'm not sure any of us had been there before, so we made like Columbus and discovered the secret wonders of this cozy saloon. And when I say cozy, I mean it! There are deep red accented lights that wrap around the perimeter and look as though they were hung for a Christmas party eons ago, only to never be returned to the dusty cardboard box with \"X-Mas\" written on top in Sharpie marker ever again. They also have a fireplace against the eastern wall that emits a pretty intense dosage of warm air. Sounds funny that one would geek out on a lit fireplace in the middle of summer, but hey; we live in San Francisco and jackets are a must throughout most of the typical summer months. \n\nAnother notable feature about this bar is that they serve Doritos to anyone who orders a drink! I've seen bars with pretzels, peanuts and Chex Mix before... but I can't say I've ever had complimentary nacho cheese Doritos after ordering a Miller High Life. We also discovered that they make for a surprisingly great chaser after slugging moonshine from plastic bottles that simply say \"Whiskey\" on the front label.  \n\nThe regulars at this place really run the gamut as well. In one corner, there was a young couple engaging in some serious heavy petting (I think we may have witnessed conception in motion), and in another, there was an angry drunk who told me, \"here's a flyer: use your fucking mouth and tell people yourself\" when I inquired about attaining a leaflet with information on their forthcoming 12 year anniversary party.

A great selection of songs from 70s rock to modern R&B.  It is a smallish place, so the sound fills the room nicely.  The music can get a little noisy, but it's not as loud as a nightclub!  I've heard from people that they now have a digital jukebox which is slowly becoming the norm, rather than the exception.\n\nAnother really neat feature is the large fireplace and you could consider yourself really lucky if you got a seat near the fireplace.

Give it a few ferns and it's virtually identical to the singles bar where Goldie Hawn meets Dudley Moore in \"Foul Play\" (yes, I know, another film reference).\n\nNowadays, it doesn't get too crowded, which is a plus. It's always easy to get a table and some chairs...which makes for a nice place to smoke some cigs, soak up some booze, groove to the awesome '70s jukebox, and chat with some fellow drinkers.", "author": "Derek R."}

I have come here twice now, once last year when I was in town and again just last week.  The seats are cozy, it's nice and dark, the regulars and other patrons are friendly, the new digital jukebox is full of great classics and the drinks on tap are cheap and tasty.  The woman behind the bar is sassy, funny, and she loves Patsy Cline and Bill Withers which is my kind of person! My fiancee and I will always make a point to set aside a night where we can drink away our sorrows when we are in town at this bar.", "author": "kate m."}
