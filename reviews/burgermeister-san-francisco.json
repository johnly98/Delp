He reminded me of my cousin Jeremy but younger.  That's cool.  The burger was good but I got my self a root beer float;  and even though I'm lactose intolerant I drank it anyway... and it was good.  ( I mean I'll hate myself later but it's not their fault).  The burger was descent and made to order.  I like fries extra crispy if you have thicker fries... maybe years on the line have made me like the crunchier ones... but I digress.\n\nA burger joint in walking distance is good.  And friendly people are good too.  I would have said the cool guy who served us name but alas,  no name tag.   Soo, all in all a descent burger.  She had a portobello mushroom burger and the coleslaw... she quite enjoyed both...\n\nOk 11 burger is kinda pricy for other cities but in this city everything is expensive.... so that's cheap? Sure.

We decided to try Burgermeister for brunch / lunch. We placed our delivery order on Sunday, December 10th at 12:38pm via DoorDash. Our order arrived at 1:49pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*12 Wings: Buffalo Wings, Lemon Pepper Wings, Ranch ($13)\n*Firehouse Burger: Fried egg, jalape\u00f1os, pepper jack cheese, red pepper aioli, jalape\u00f1o cilantro mayo, brioche bun, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickle, Medium ($15.50), Onion Rings (+$4.50)\n*Meisterburger: Avocado, thick-cut bacon, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled onions, cheese, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro mayo, house bun, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickle, Medium ($15.50), Garlic Fries (+$3.50)\n*Chili Cheese Dog: Chili, nacho cheese, onions, shredded cheddar, parsley ($10.50)\n\nThe wings had decent flavor. Though they were a little small in size. Not the big, plump, juicy wings I'm prefer. I got the meisterburger which was pretty good. A lot going on with all the toppings, but it melded into a comforting bite. The garlic fries were a little disappointing. Just regular fries topped with garlic bits. If you just ate the fry by itself, it tasted like a regular french fry. I liked the roomie's firehouse burger better as the egg gave it more moisture. Their chili has beans, so I didn't really try the hot dog. Good to note, the dog does come with regular fries. I did wish they gave us the same upgrade option as the burgers as I would have liked to vary our sides. Their regular fries are just meh.\n\nPretty good burgers, though rather pricey at $15+ each. At least it was a lot of food and managed to feed us 1.5 times. Glad I finally tried Burgermeister, but I think there are better burger spots out there. And for about half the price!", "author": "Elena N."}

My friend suggested this place as it was close by the bar we last visited. It also helped that it was one of the only burger joints open at that time so that was a no brainer. \n\nI like the bold red and yellow colors that give it the diner feel. Lots of awards and publications framed on the walls throughout the location. There were different types of seating throughout the joint and a self service condiment bar which I'm always a fan of. Walk up to the counter, order and find a seat; the kitchen will deliver your food when it's ready. Simple process. \n\nFor my first visit, I decided on the classic Cheeseburger for $10.75. All burgers come with fries, tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles. I decided to add on curly fries instead of the normal french fries. I'm glad I did. Their seasoned curly fries were so crispy and flavorful; reminded me of Jack in the Box curly fries which can NEVER do wrong in my eyes. The curly fries alone will keep me coming back! The burger was good too! Juicy and cooked to a medium rare perfection, I chose American cheese. The overall burger was big and filling. \n\nYeah, this place certainly not THE BEST burger joint out there but for what it is, they do it right!

But the menu has recently been revamped, and not for the better.  Our to-go meal tonight was just barely ok, and was really a disappointment compared to the past. The serving size of the fries was about half of what it used to be. Seriously, when we opened things up at home, it looked like somebody had eaten half our fries.  I counted mine. There were only 15 in my order, and many of them were only partial fries (fry fragments? :-) a few inches long.  Very sad, lonely fries.  Not even McDonald's caliber. On top of that, the fries that were there were greasy, soggy, and not quite thoroughly cooked.  Burgers were just ok . . . buns were on the dry side, not toasted or warmed at all, too thick, too much bread, and didn't seem totally fresh.  Burgers themselves were also on the dry side, and pretty bland. No excuse for that at $14+ for a burger. They also used to have a really great condiment counter where you could get all sorts of saucy extras -- several kinds of mustard, mayo, ketchup, bbq sauce, A-1, and more, served from nice, very clean stainless steel dispensers with nice clean pump handles, with the little plastic cups and lids right there.  Now, all the dispensers are gone (except one for mustard), and instead there are a few bottles of things across the room on the counter, near the cashier, in plastic squeeze bottles, with a handwritten piece of tape on them indicating what they are. The little plastic cups and lids, however, are on the other side of the room . . . so you have to do a lot of walking back and forth.  And the condiment squeeze bottles themselves were sticky and gross, having been handled by a few hundred people every day.  Not either appetizing or appealing, and undoubtedly not hygienic either.  You have to actually ask for mayonnaise, and when I asked for an extra one, I really got the feeling I was pushing things. Anyway, what a disappointment.  Really used to love this place.  The food, the set-up, everything used to be totally together, and the burgers were great. Not the case anymore, with (sadly) the food itself having taken a real dive. There are much better places to get great high-end \"artisan\" burgers in a foodie town. Yes, there are still a bunch of interesting high-quality cheeses, and other toppings available here. That hasn't changed. But honestly, the burger itself was less than average, and in terms of the actual burger quality, tastiness, seasoning, juiciness -- and also the taste and quality of the fries -- In-N-Out Burger is a LOT more enjoyable, and at $10 less per burger.", "author": "George D."}

I like that the buns are toasted and the patties have a subtle, charred taste. A bit overpriced though, ranging from $12 - $15 for a burger, and the restaurant itself is pretty dirty. The tables are diner style, not particularly cohering to any kind of ambience. It is self serve - order at the counter and throw away your own trash - but they don't wipe off the tables very often, and with burgers it gets greasy really quickly. Fries are good though!

The Habit and Red Robin both understand how to make a lettuce wrapped burger.

I'm an EMT and my partner and I just got off a call and stopped in here to give them a try on our way back. Best decision ever because our burgers were AHHHH-mazing. We had zero complaints. I had the ABC and he had the western burger. Juicy, full of flavor, and satisfying. In my opinion, better than any other burger out there. I also had the regular fries that come with (most places make you pay extra for your side, not here) and those were pretty good. My partner had garlic curly fries. We've never heard of a place with garlic curly fries. He loved them and to be honest, those were deish. I loved the roasted garlic on top. If you're a ranch fan and like to dip your fries, burger, etc. Their ranch is homemade and it's BOMB. Need I say more?!?!Yeah it's sort of a small place but it's clean, inviting and the staff are very nice and helpful! In fact, you'll probably be ordering from an EMT/Medic future firefighter.

The other did not come with the chili cheese fries ( extra 5 bucks ) just normal fries. C'MON WE'RE HONGRY BURGERMEISTER !!! The second burger was soaked in roasted red peppers, jalepenos, and more onions than I ever thought possible on a burger. DOUBLE EWW!!!!

Too bad.\n\nI used to work fairly close to this Burgermeister and it was always great. But, after visiting recently, it is no longer the same and I will not be back. \n\nBeyond the fact that the menu had changed since we'd last visited, there were issues with the food, service and restaurant itself. After placing our order for four dinners, the food took a bit longer than expected, especially since the place was not very busy. \n\nThe counter tops were greasy with old cups and napkins that we had to discard ourselves. The worst area was the ketchup/mustard/relish station which was sticky and had what looked like fruit flies hovering where you pump your condiments. \n\nThree of the dinners were standard hamburgers, which were fair, but a bit on the greasy side; this should not have been the case since the average price was about $12 each. The fourth dinner was a turkey burger that was supposed to come with a fried egg. \n\nWhat arrived was a dried-out piece of beige-colored leather with grill marks on it and no egg. We asked the employee about it and he said he would bring the egg and apologized, which was fine. But then, a different employee came up and said that he forgot to charge us for the egg and asked that my wife come up to the counter and pay for it(!). \n\nThe employee admitted that it was his mistake but still insisted we leave our table and pay for it anyway, even though we had already waited about 20 minutes. It would be another 10 minutes before the substandard turkey burger could be consumed as originally ordered and it was a disappointment.\n\nAt this point, we wished we had gone to Super-Duper or one of the many good mom-and-pop places in the area. \n\nSorry to see Burgermeister on Church St. go down hill and be so nickel-and-dimey about their services. Any business that is this penny-pinching over their own mistake is not a place that I want to be patronizing.", "author": "James A."}

I went in and tried for a while to figure out what to pair that with. After deciding for quite a while, I opted for a \"make your own burger\" option. \nAs I started to order, it took the cashier a while to figure out everything. No problem, I've worked in bars/restaurants for almost 20 years so I'm sensitive to newer employees or cashiers that just want to go slower to make sure they got it right.\nAfter going through my order multiple times (on their end), I pay, tip, and take a seat. When it takes almost 15 minutes to pour my draft beer, I was concerned but noticed that they were having trouble pouring the beer and patiently waited. (Seriously, train your staff on how to pour beers and you could save yourself a lot of money in beer waste and labor).\nAgain, no problem. I don't mind waiting when I have the time. After a long time, my food is finally ready. After telling them 3 times that I was dining in, my food was packaged to go. \nThe server proudly declared that I got the last order of (garlic) fries for the night since the fryer had stopped working.  My main issue was that the fryer wasn't working when they made mine either. They were lukewarm, soggy, and gross. I immediately went back up to the register and explained that I couldn't eat them since they were raw. He kindly apologized and asked if I would prefer salad or coleslaw. I ended up a minute later with a bowl of lettuce with my salad dressing on the side. A bowl of lettuce is not a salad!!! Especially, when the customer paid for an upgraded side.\nAfter eating my overcooked burger, I waited in line to try to recoup some of my money from being overcharged, but I lost interest after a while. \nI don't really care about getting a dollar back, but I do care about telling management that they need to step up their employee training. Things happen, I get it. I think you have some great people working for you, but you need to work on training them. When things go wrong, you need to make sure that they understand how to handle things. The $1 overage should have been immediately been refunded to me or my salad should have been offered to be upgraded. \nNothing that happened tonight is enough to make me never go there again, but in a city as competitive as SF, it will be a long time till I'm willing to risk spending my hard earned money on a meal where I might not feel value to it.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

After tossing out the fish, even the bun was ultra-salty.  I did not need to get salt for the fries because I could get my fries season just by touching the fish itself.

They take their job seriously and it shows with their growth in locations. I applaud them for their detailed nutrition listings, for all types of patty and condiment combinations. \n\nHere you'll get a good burger at a fair price. In my case, it was $10.42 with tax for a 1/3lb bacon cheeseburger, which comes with fries. The patty was cooked medium as requested, though nearly medium rare, with a clear distinction between the brown and pink parts of the patty. \n\nThe wide variety of sauces for my burger and/or fries was a nice touch. The red pepper aioli and the peppercorn steak sauce were solid and clearly carried their own distinct flavorings.\n\nOverall, this burger exceeded expectations, and helped me understand why several local Burgermeister franchises are operating today. The management has put a lot of thought into creating a good burger experience, for both food and service.", "author": "Mike H."}

I'm from Los Angeles and I was visiting this great city for a week when a local friend of mine showed us this compact, full-flavored burger spot.\n\nThe first thing I saw on the menu was the Pastrami Burger, and my mouth immediately began to salivate haha. I'm a HUGE fan of pastrami and I was happy to see that theirs are Niman Ranch beef also so WHY NOT right?? Their patties come in two sizes, third-pounders and half-pounders, and i was thinking I should probably get the third pounder patty because another 1/3 pound of pastrami would be layered on top of that juicy patty. The last few burger places I've went to asked \"would you like pink on your burger or no pink?\" and i would reply, \"medium-rare\" but they looked puzzled o.O? and that made me NOT wanna go there anymore because they would most likely be using a pre-set charbroiling oven. I'm a chef that enjoys the expertise of a fellow cook using his skills to KNOW when a burger is cooked so I was happy to see that my \"medium-rare\" specified burger was cooked EXACTLY that way. \n\n\nHonestly, the burger was so huge, I had to cut it into pieces to not look like a complete carnivorous animal in front of my friend and girlfriend. The burger was juicy, the pastrami was AMAZING, but my only comment would be to not add so much of  the caramelized onion and maybe 86 it all together because the sweetness of the onions overpowered the well-seasoned taste of the burger and pastrami. Overall, I was very satisfied, and next time I go, I will surely grab a pint of the four or five beers they have on tap. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Trust me!", "author": "Jared A."}

In this case, it is the Meister Burger.\n\nI am a burger critic. I have eaten at all the local burger restaurants in SF. I even lived across the street from Pearl's for a year, but would still venture all the way to the Castro for this king. The Meister Burger truly is a masterpiece, and I say this because it's the only burger I have ever had that was abnormally large but didn't fall apart when I picked it up. Every bite, and I mean every last one, was perfectly balanced with delicious beef, avocado, onions, cheese and mushrooms. I devoured the entire thing, and felt 100% satisfied as I did so. I even said to my girlfriend, \"This is the best burger I have ever had.\"\n\nThe prices are higher than average, but the quality is much higher than average. I have never had a bad experience here in at least two-dozen visits. They actually cook the burgers over an open flame (a lot of places are fond of griddles). The beef is perfect. I eat my burgers medium-rare, and they executed that more precisely than I had ever seen. The buns are toasted just enough so that they are not too crunchy, but still don't get soggy from the grease. The fries are yummy, and have a nice little crunch to them. The service is fantastic. They ask for your name and bring the burgers out to you. They also never seem to be in a bad mood. Oh, they have beer! Like, six different beers on tap! There aren't many burger places with that!\n\nI am disappointed that so many people wrote bad reviews for this place. I don't understand it. The burgers here are so phenomenal. Actually, I just reread one of the bashing reviews, and they complained about a VEGGIE BURGER. Eat some real meat, dork!\n\nIt might be expensive, but there is a price to pay for the absolute best in the city. If you like delicious, juicy and beefy specialty burgers, you will love this place.

Ask for Ranch!] and a shake [strawberry]. Portions are generous, even on those items. I tried many times to pawn off the curly fries to my friends who were already struggling with their orders. The $5+ shake was delicious, and it was really the size of 2.25 shakes. No complaints! The burgers my friends had ordered [1 each] were size-of-your-face-HUGE. \n\nDon't get thrown off by the prices. You're getting fresh ingredients, happy Niman Ranch cows, and enough food to feed a Lego village.

I think that's how it works. Yes, red meat, as we all know, is basically poison and instant death most of the time. But for reasons that I can't remember, if if you see the words \"Niman Ranch\" anywhere in the restaurant, that means that every burger you eat there adds five days on to your life. Five juicy, tender, succulent days, covered in avocado and maybe A1 sauce. \n\nThrow in a glass of cool, nutritious beer and you are basically immortal if you eat there enough.", "author": "Tim S."}

I had my worst customer service experience here.  One employee has guaranteed that I will never visit again and will also convince my friends to do the same.  \n\nOk so I'm from Ohio and was in the area starving for a burger.  As I walked in the narrow corridor I approached the cash register.  I saw one employee behind the counter cleaning the counter area.  We made eye contact for a strange awkward 10 seconds.  I was expecting to be greeted but he just turned his back to me and continued cleaning.  Two minutes later as I am still standing occasionally glancing at the clock above, the cleaning associate finally put down his rag and approached me.  As he got closer I could see the dirty looking employee covered in tattoos and frizzy hair that look like his hair contained an ecosystem.  He walked to the cash register very unwillingly and just stared at me without saying a word.  I asked him, \"Sir Can I place an order?\"  Than he said very quickly, \"What do you want?\"  I am very agitated by now so I just order the cheeseburger.  He began to ring it up on my card but he said my card was declined after trying several times.  So I just left still upset with the whole situation and his attitude.  I walked across the street to the Safeway and my card worked fine.\n\nI was intent on never going back but it was the only burger place I knew of near by.  A week later I traveled back to this place and as soon as I walked in, a young female cashier immediately began to help me.  She ran my card through several times and the same result occurred during my first visit.  However instead of refusing me service, she hand keyed my card information into the system and it accepted my card.  Very strange I thought but I was impressed at how the cashier resolved the situation.  Two thumbs up to her for excellent service!\n\nOk so I figure I will not let that one rude guy ruin my experience I will make this my favorite lunch spot.  So I return after another week and guess who is back at the cash register.  Yes the dirty unkempt long hair rude guy.  Ok the same problem occurs during my order.  I told him that he may have to hand key it in like the other employee before he swiped it.  Instead of listening to me he attempts to swipe my card multiple times.  Seeing that it did not work he began to type it in.  He appeared very agitated as he firmly pressed each key to the point you would think that his finger must surely be in pain.  Then at the end of the typing he stared at the screen for a moment and then said it was declined and I would have to leave.  I asked him to try it again because this was the only place I had problems with my card, and his fellow employee was able to get it to work.  Instead of trying again, he yelled the word \"DECLINED\" using 5 syllables instead of two as the whole restaurant got quiet and stared.\n\nNot sure why my card has problems here but I am sure they lost a customer that would have called that place lunch home several times a week.

It was about two weeks ago that I came here wanting something filling. This being the weekend of the Fillmore Jazz Festival. I came in there dreaming of having one of their nice fat juicy burgers with a tall glass of something and poof the cashier killed that with \"our grill insn't working.\" How lame!!! I came back a couple days later and felt like having some fish and chips. They were really good being that they are known more for their burgers. They don't just give you three big pieces of fish but several small pieces which I think is better. At least you don't burn your tongue as badly. I came out of here pretty satisfied, at least food wise.\n\nThe whole time I waited for my food the waitress/cashier was on her stupid cell phone text messaging someone or surfing the internet. The only time she actually did move was to bring someone something and then back to her phone. I thought this was very unprofessional and she looked totally bored out of her mind. The cook seemed to notice that I was watching this whole thing and took away her phone. Then she started whining and complaining about how she needed to call someone. Then he gave it back to her. Great if your employees whine like a little five year old you give them what they want? I really expected a whole lot more out of this place but this experience takes the cake.

This time the call to action was spurred on by a hectic Friday night/Saturday morning.  After the dust had settled we decided that we needed to eat a hamburger or two.\n\nFortunately we had been given vouchers for a free burger (result!) so with that and a few dollars more in our pocket we stumbled out to Burgermeister.  I had decided in the car that no matter what, I was going to have a milkshake.  I rarely drink 'shakes because they are the most efficient fat and sugar delivery system known to man so when I do, I want it to be memorable.  I was happy to see that they make their shakes with the excellent Mitchell's ice cream, a local favourite and the shake did not disappoint.  In true fountain style the shake came in its own glass with the remainder served in a metal tumbler.  I took this as a sign from the burger gods that I was to make myself a coke float with the excess and both concoctions were seriously decadent.  If I had a slice of chocolate cake at the time, I'm pretty sure it would have ended up in the mix.  My vanilla shake was by far the highlight of the meal and lived up to everything it promised to be.\n\nThe burger and fries whilst not epoch making like the shake were also very nice indeed.  The patty was thick and juicy, well charred and came with a slice of proper cheddar, not processed.  The bacon could have been cooked more, I like my bacon crispy on a burger as a burger should always be a clean bite, so slightly chewy bacon did take it down a bit.  The fries, were fries, well seasoned and crispy.  I did look enviously at the diners next to me as they tucked into curly fries, how did I miss that!\n\nOverall though I think Burgermeister is a solid four star joint, the burgers aren't that expensive at $6-8 a pop and the milkshakes make it worth the price of admission alone.  However if like me, you don't always take your meal with a 1200 calorie carbfest, I wouldn't make a special trip for Burgermeister.", "author": "Tony S."}

Despite the good service I am giving this 1 star to counter the 5 star reviews, The food probably rates 3 stars. I will not go back until they have reasonable prices.", "author": "Darryl D."}

The wussily misnamed \"kid's burger\" gives you a less-overwhelming quarter-pound option when you just don't feel up to the challenge of the half-pound standard burger.  I'd steer clear of all the toppings, including all the hokey-jokey California-style mangos and pineapples and all that crap, because it detracts from the flavor of the beef, which is always excellent.   With all these burger joints using Niman Ranch beef and other high-grade chuck, one starts looking for the other details to separate the champion burgers from the pretenders.   Burgermeister offers the best fries of any local burger joint I've tried... If you want to snazz up your burger and don't want to goof around with all the crazy toppings they offer, get a side of chili fries.  The chili is top quality and really augments the flavor of the fries and burger.  The shakes here are great too.  The chicken tenders are dissapointing.   Also, the Cole Valley location offers an amazing \"econo lunch special,\" of a 1/4 pounder, fries and soda for a total of $6.50...a great deal, especially compared to ridiculously over-priced competitors like \"Burger Joint\" on Haight & Pierce.", "author": "Dan L."}

YMMV, especially if you're not a vegetarian like me, but for my money, these guys make the best burgers on the continent--some goes for their onion rings, actually. They also have a fairly decent selection of beers and window seats which make good people-watching. And they're sympathetic to the various dietary requirements that people I go there with have. Definitely five stars.", "author": "Mik S."}

We get to Burgermeister and they inform us their fryers are down. WHAT?  A hamburger with no fries?  That's unthinkable!  So we head to the Church Street Burgermeister.  We park practically in front of the place - I'm thinking this is too good to be true - their fryer will probably be down too.  But nope - we check that out first thing and it's up and running.  Alrighty.  We get down to the serious business of ordering and when that is said and done they ask for $46.  The next sound they hear is my jaw hitting the counter.  $46 for three hamburgers, fries, one water, one Diet Pepsi and one beer.  AWK!  Oh - and put the plastic away - they only take cash.  While I'm trying to get past the shock of paying the $46, we find a table and we sit down and wait.  Cute decor - comfotable little place.  After a short wait the food is brought to the table - and one forgets the pain of paying $46.  Great hamburger - good meat really does make a difference.  Nice fresh pickle and great fries!   The only thing left on my plate by the time I was done was the lettuce leaf and part of the red onion.  And I was full the rest of the day and didn't eat again so really that hamburger wasn't so expensive after all was it?!   Well that's how I justify it anyway.   I'm headed back there next time I want a good hamburger.", "author": "Cindy D."}

Niman Ranch burgers piled high with fresh lettuce, juicy red tomatoes, and other toppings of your choosing makes these burgers a comfort-food find! They tend to cook their burgers a little past what you've ordered, so order one step below your perfect burger...", "author": "Michael H."}

They said I couldn't order just a hotdog--I had to order a whole meal.  What a joke.  $7.35 for a hotdog meal.  It's cheaper at Metreon or the ballpark.  How can you not be able to order just a hotdog?  It's not like I came in asking to order just a slice of tomato.  Oh well.  I went next door and got two delicious tacos for $5.", "author": "IMHeAsURHe B."}
