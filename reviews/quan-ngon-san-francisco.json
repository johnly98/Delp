I came to this Vietnamese restaurant many times it's because close to my house. I know long time that guy super rude so whenever i craving for Vietnamese food I will call them order Togo. \nThis time I tried dine in. Around 2weeks ago I went there, dine in, ordered crab noodle soup. Ok, crab noodle soup ready to served, put on the sticky table. The soup not boil, not even hot. The temperature level is like warm to cold! And bring a plate of cabbage, peppers,half lime for us put in soup noodle. I put all the cabbage,peppers in my soup noodle, mix them and take a sip the soup! After put them all in, it turn to a bowl of cold soup noodle . So I asked the waiter(the short guy, see him all time there) asked him politely \"can you help me heat up my noodle because its cold\". He replied, you put everything in thats why it become cold! He then ignored me &walked away. I wonder, is that plate he gave me just for display, not for my soup noodle! He deserve zero star for his bad attitude, bad service! \n\nNow whenever craving for a bowl of hot delicious crab soup noodle I will go to their brother restaurant located in San Bruno, same owner but diff location. I been there few times now, still have not yet disappointed me, bring to me always hot and yummy. After put peppers in a boiled soup even more perfect, bring a little spicy to my soup.", "author": "Epicure M."}

However, having someone else place an order in their native language and receive an incorrect order is unacceptable. \n\nThe bf called and asked for 2 orders of pho and a BBQ pork rice dish with eggroll (#25). The lady repeated the order in Chinese and he acknowledged it. When the order was picked up and brought home, the pho was there but instead of the rice dish, we got spring rolls. What sucked the most? This dish was for me. \n\nThe bf called back and and explained the mishap.... I really wanted that rice dish but she pretty much said there's nothing they can do and hung up on him. Since I believe this was a discrepancy on their end, I felt they should have honored that so I called them back. \n\nThe same lady answered and I tried explaining the issue but it did not seem like she could understand me as she kept responding in Chinese. I repeatedly asked if she speaks or understands English, saying I don't understand her and what the issue was. Trying to hold my temper i was finally able to compose myself and ask if I can speak to someone else who may understand me. The usual guy answered and I felt like a dick for asking if he could understand me and so explained the issue and asked if we can come back to exchange the incorrect dish with the right one. He said thats fine so we make the trip back, egg rolls unopened in their box, in hand. \n\nWe get there and I hand the guy the box of egg rolls. Less than a minute later, he gets the dish and tells me I owe him another $2something. I told him I don't have any cash and he tells me theres a difference in price all while ignoring the fact the order was placed incorrectly. I felt the need to remind him that the order was placed wrong, was brought home, and our unnecessary trip back to exchange the dish. He told me it was fine and I thanked him and took my food home. \n\nAs I'm really appreciative that we eventually got the correct order, I did not feel it was necessary to brush off the BF saying they can't help us as well as demanding I pay for the difference of the dish after getting the wrong one and having to drive back to exchange it. \n\nWe won't be coming here for a while which SADDENS me but to treat customers that way is not right. We'll come back one day, hopefully with better service.", "author": "Clarizeyale R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "From the looks of the food and the name of the restaurant I had the mindset that Quan Ngon was one of those places that was very Vietnamese, but when I walked in all the servers and customers were speaking in Canto. Lol I guess this area of the Sunset is pretty Canto, in the vicinity of ABC Cafe, Mong Kok Dim Sum, and Cheung Hing.\n\nUnlike most Chinese places that have overwhelming menus of endless glossy pages with colorful photos, Quan Ngon featured a simple menu inclusive of all Vietnamese comfort food--pho, rice plates, vermicelli bowls.\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nBeing sick but being adamant about going on a Yelpventure, chicken pho seemed the most appropriate choice for eating out and I found Quan Ngon via Yelp. (Asian chicken noodle soup? Yes please!) \n\n[THE NOMS]\n\nThe pho was quite on point, with a flavorful balanced broth, not too fatty or salty, and excellent with the noodles. It could have used more chicken and onions, but overall it was satisfying. We ordered both the large and a small chicken pho ($8.50/$7.50), and the larger one was in a bigger bowl but it seems that they just split it more or less evenly into the two bowls. \n\nAnd just a warning, the jalapeno toppings are spicy!!! I don't think remove the seeds, and I was too excited about the vitamin C toppings to notice; I ended up literally crying. They serve hot tea without water so I just cried more T-T\n\nWe also tried the 5 spice chicken rice plate ($8)--you could hardly taste the 5 spices... so it was more like 0 spice but it was tasty roast chicken nonetheless. The portions were generous: if you want more chicken I would strongly suggest this, as the pho only gives you a few pieces of chicken hidden in the noodle soup.\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nMuch better pho and 5 spice chicken than anywhere in the Inner Sunset.\n\n[AFTERTHOUGHTS]\n\nHonestly I had my doubts with their iffy health score... but alas, my love for food prevails and it was pho adventure time despite being sick and despite any risks with mediocre health scores. Quan Ngon turned out to look decently clean--there's a bit of the hole-in-the-wall feel, but more in the sense of feeling family-owned feel than being unkempt and dirty. \n\nLastly, a tip on parking: the immediate area looks formidably like the Richmond with metered parking and few open spots, but if you go like two blocks down into the residential area it's easy street parking.", "author": "Edna C."}

So, this place is open for another 2 hours and half your menu (prepared with chicken) is gone? This doesn't bother me too much though. What really bothers me is them walking over, waiting until we say something, then telling us they've run out. Then waiting again for us to pick something else before they give us more bad news. That's one thing I appreciate about American restaurants--their need to notify you of menu changes ahead of time. It really makes a difference to some people. \n\nFOOD: 50% of the time I come to eat here, they run out of what I want. I like to think I'm pretty flexible too. I can generally pick out 2-3 items to order as backups. Like many others, I recommend the Bun Rieu (crab with tomato broth). This is, by far, their most popular item on the menu.

We have a lot of take out orders.\" Looked over at the counter and didn't see a single take out order being made, nor did I see people coming to pick up their food. They were just very understaffed.\n\nWhen the food came, the waiter just placed in randomly on the table, without bothering to ask whose order belonged to whom and just left. What bad service! After we asked for the bill, they literally stopped us from leaving and told us that our bill did not include tip. A tip is reflected upon good service, which was definitely missing from this establishment. The waiters were also talking behind our backs in Chinese, thinking that we couldn't understand them. This was definitely the first time that a waiter had the audacity to ask for a tip, don't get me wrong, I'm not being stingy from tipping.

I actually prefer the BBQ pork rolls with sprouts and request it, and they have accommodated with no issues.  \n\nI would have only two small negatives about Quan Ngon.  The first is that they do tend to run out of items - I'm not sure if its because they are so busy or ordering issues.  And the second is sometimes you may not feel warm fuzzies from the staff.

It's an extra 50 cents but it's well worth it. Their steak is no ordinary steak you'd find in any typical pho restaurant.

I was quite concerned when I saw mispelling of the name ( H\u00e0 Ni) but the food wasn't as bad as I thought. They use fresh wider noodles which are the ones you'll find in the north of Vietnam, but I felt like there is too much MSG in the broth. The broth is bland and yet too artificially sweet at the same time. However the meat was sliced by a machine so it's thin and quite tender.

The northern style focuses more on the simplicity and clarity of the broth. \n\nI wish more people would post fully informed reviews about cuisine style so that it's an accurate representation. \n\nAs for this restaurant, it is a decent place that'll do the trick. Turtle Tower is still probably better, but it was so long since I've been. Supposedly, the one in the Tenderloin is the best.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-27", "description": "A local's spot for sure.  Lines get rather long here especially during the prime time hours on the weekends.  If you have heard of or been to Turtle Tower, then  this needs to be the next stop for possibly one of the best spots in SF for a northern Vietnamese style Pho Ga aka Chicken Pho.  Their soup base does, however, have MSG.  That doesn't stop the zealous locals from coming back on the regular.  The chicken is never overcooked here, and the light chicken broth is like the gift from the gods especially after a night of alky overdose.  If you like chicken innards, then you can get that with your chicken pho as well.  Just can't go wrong with that crunchy bite of gizzard contrasting the soft silky bite of wide rice noodles.  For the spicy lovers out there, don't forget to dash on that ridiculously tantalizing house blend of tongue zapping, tear jerking, fire breathing chili sauce.  I'm not sure what they put in it but I do believe I taste habanero.  I've never had crack before but I can empathize with those addicts through this crazy good sauce.\n\nAlthough they are well known for their chicken pho, their other options could equally steal the show depending on what you're craving on a particular day.  They have a wonderfully done fall off the bones tender ox tail noodle in a red wine soup.  Hard to find great ox tail done right here in the city.  They make it perfect here.  I want to say that is one of my faves, but let's face it, I have many faves here.  \n\nThere's the Satay Beef Noodle Soup flavored with a bold peanutty satay sauce, topped with thick slices of rare beef that slowly cooks in the hot broth.  I like to take those out when they look med rare so they don't get too cooked, and dip them back into the broth when I'm ready to eat each slice with my noodles. \n\nThe Bun Rieu is so addictive!  This traditional noodle soup uses tomato, shrimp paste, shrimp, crab, and crab paste as base.  It is served with soft tasty meat balls made from pork, shrimp, and crab with silky bites of vermicelli noodles.  If you are feeling adventurous, ask for extra shrimp paste, mix that with lime juice and chili sauce, and add that to every spoonful of noodle.  My friends from Vietnam do that, and it is to die for.  \n\nMy last fave here is the Curry Chicken Noodle Soup.  Perhaps the best in the city in my books.  What makes them so much better than any other spot is the free range chicken they use.  It's not shredded chicken like the chicken that comes with the Chicken Pho they are known for, but actual pieces of chopped chicken along with the bones.  The flavor of the chicken soup is enhanced by the curry and softened with coconut milk.  Cilantro and onions make the perfect toppings brightening the flavor altogether.  I like to add extra cilantro.  Too good.  Way too good.\n\nThose are my go tos.  Any time I take a seat there, I accept the fact that I am no longer the boss. If it were up to me, I'd sit there indecisive, and probably order all of it just so I can get a few bites of each.  That proved damaging to my pockets at one point in time.  It was the right choice for me to give up my decision making to my board of directors while I'm there.  What I order solely depends on the demands of my belly, my cravings, and my gf.  I trust they know what I want, and they get it right every time.\n\nRemember, a dash of their house made chili sauce to every bite will change your life forever... You will give up Sriracha while you are here like I did.  Now isn't that life changing enough?", "author": "Colin M."}

I've noticed they aren't always consistent with the noodles; sometimes they are the wide flat ones (that you might find in Thai khaosoy), sometimes \"standard\" thin ones seen in most traditional pho.

Wine sauce oxtail broth was incredibly delicious, broth was rich and flavorful and the oxtail was tender and cooked perfectly. This soup is rare and unique, overly impressed. Pho t\u00e1i (rare beef) was  well executed. Flavorful broth and I liked their use of medium rice noodles in both soups, which is different, and had a perfect texture and consistency. Not too chewy, stuck together, or overcooked and soft. The chili oil on the side is a good addition if you are looking for spice and a little more flavor. The condiments and sauces provided on the table of Vietnamese restaurants may be a good indicator of how authentic or good the food is, and I was pleased to see that there was no shitty Hoisin or oyster sauce in sight for people to dump and destroy their pho with. \n\nAlso ordered the imperial rolls. Crunchy, well seasoned filling, pickled daikon and carrot and noodles provided as should be, and cheap. \n\nAs many of my experiences in Vietnamese restaurants, service was terrible. People are unhelpful, don't acknowledge you whatsoever, and randomly charge you for things I'd never been charged for before. Had to yell across the restaurant for my servers attention, unsure if she heard me but asked anyway for a takeaway container for my soup, and five minutes later handed me a cardboard box. I pointed to my soup and said I needed a plastic container, and after grumpily going back to get one she grabs our check that she already handed us to change our total price because apparently it's extra cost to ask for a container to take your leftovers home. I don't really mind paying for the plastic... But she was extraordinarily rude about it and didn't communicate so. *shrug. Fortunately for this place I'm not one of those amateur yelp reviewers that base my under $30 Asian food restaurant experience on their below stellar service.

Kelvin had said that this place had pretty good Chicken Pho, maybe even better than Turtle Tower. So sure enough we had to check it out. That and the fact that it was so close to Bush's place.\n\nYup the chicken pho was very good, very light, noodles had good consistency and i was very satisfied.\n\nSecond time here, was here to have a nice get together with good friends Julie, Adri, and Henry. I then once again ordered the chicken pho. And yes once again I was very satisfied. I can't really compare the chicken pho..but i have to say that there is more chicken here than i had over at Turtle and I like the broth here a bit more too. \n\nand yes i believe chicken pho is pho ga..", "author": "phillip w."}

That was on top of the meal, followed by the BBQ pork, peanuts, vermicelli, cucumber, bean sprouts and mint along with the sauce.  This dish is a hit.

I hate to do this to you since I've been eating here for so long when I was living a couple of blocks away and your pho ga had been so fantastic.\n\nI moved out of the Sunset for almost 2 years and I was so missed the taste of the pho ga offering here. Just so happened that my girlfriend was invited to a house party (think poker night w/o food) nearby this evening at 8:30. The girlfriend and I walked in at 7:30pm and thought we would have plenty of time to fill up before she hit the party. Wrong! The house was full. That's a surprise to me because that doesn't happen when I was a regular.\n\nWe waited for a few minutes for the (only) waiter to turn over a table for us. Fine, then a couple of tables had finished and left. We got the hot teas and promptly ordered. At this time more customers came in and fill the place up again. I began to notice that more than half of the tables in the dinning hall are sitting without food. Anyhow, we chatted happily and thought all of the customers sitting without food were just came in right before us. Then, 10 minutes gone by, the table next to us got an imperial roll app. Another 10 minutes later, one table got a couple bowls of pho. At 8:00pm, 30 minutes after we're seated, another table of 3 got their order. I'm sorry, did we mistakenly walked into a French joint? where a meal takes over 3 hours? I thought pho supposed to be a quick, worm, and no thrill sort of meal.\n\nI started to suggest to just walk because there were 4 other tables still without food, who arrived before us. A simple math tells us that our food will be here... what?! 8:40pm?! 1) we're staving 2) she'll be late to the party, therefore, we walked. To be fair, the waiter was apologetic when we informed him that we can no longer wait, +1. We're strongly suspecting that there were only 1-2 cooks in the kitchen because clearly informed by the waiter that our order weren't being prepared, after 35 minutes of waiting. \n\nWe ended up walking across the street and ate at ABC cafe. Wonton noodles and deep fried pork chops with noodles in fish broth were both good. But still, we wished we had pho ga instead. At the end of the day, Quan Ngon left us staving and ABC did the job by provided us dinner, in what?! seating to giving the check in 25~minutes. \n\nAgain, I feel so sorry for giving this place 1 star, for how much I love their pho ga a few years back. Too bad that I didn't get a chance to taste it again. I'm sure it's still good or even better, given THAT many people came in this evening. I guess I'll try this place again at some odd hours maybe. C'mon and start focusing on staffing in the kitchen and the dinning hall would you?!  You have done it well before and please bring it back.", "author": "Rio T."}

Something like that, someone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThe broth is the same as any other place, good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nBut the beef, OMG THE BEEF, WHAT YOU KNOW 'BOUT THAT RARE STEAK ON THE SIDE?!?

The same friend told me that this restaurant uses filet minion beef as opposed to the traditional eye round steak. Makes sense, usually other pho restaurants charge an extra $2-3 for a side order of extra steak, I think I paid anywhere from $4-6. TOTALLY. WORTH. IT. \n\nWhenever I go out for pho, which is quite regularly, I always get the beef broth one with rare steak on the side.

Although these are very delicious here, I think it'll be highly unlikely that I ever come back to eat here again. Why? A big part of any good restaurant business is customer service...and this place SUCKS at it. They're so rude, dirty, and have no respect for any of their customers. \n\nPrior to this review, my family came to dine at this place for lunch at least three times a week. Their food is good and their broth comes out hot which is important for us. However, after hearing about my parents experience when they came here I was furious. During their 2nd visit of the week, the two waiters that was working that day accused my parents for not paying their previous bill. My parents were very confused because they always pay for it and my mom even recalled the last time when they were paying the bill that she asked my dad if they charged for their takeout box before my dad gave his cash and got the change. Although my dad knew it was wrong, he paid for it anyways because he didn't want to start a commotion and genuinely enjoyed supporting a restaurant with good food. But that's stupid on so many levels because those waiters were rude about the situation and probably thought they were able to take advantage of a mistake they may have committed with someone that was sitting next to them that day. If anyone decided to dine and ditch at a restaurant any day... why would they ever go back?! Not only that, but how can you throw a receipt in a customer's face and accuse them? (Cash only, and this might be one of the big problems cause someone could have easily used the money left there to pay for their bill and ditch so that innocents are left to blame.) Besides, even if it was an innocent mistake, you would think the waiters are familiar enough with my parents and they could even let one check go.. considering we feed their business consistently.\n\nThey always say the dirtier the place, the better the food. And it's true, next time you eat there be careful that the waiter's dirty fingers are not all up in your soup. He touches all the money, wipes his nose, and doesn't even wash his hands before he brings the food out. \n\nI would also avoid drinking the hot tea they serve and use it to wash your oily utensils instead. On multiple occasion I've found lipstick stains and tea residue when i wiped the cup down. \n\nService is very important, and service here sucks. Less than one star if i could.

Get a sauce pan for their home-ade hot sauce for the chicken, put a dab of it into my soup, and BAM, meal of the year.\n\nI like turtle tower, but its def not as good as this place. The broth here is just so much more tasty and fragrant. Turtle tower, to me, uses broth straight from the can and is pretty bland.\n\nHow about you try and compare and tell me what you think!", "author": "Jennifer T."}

The beef broth was good if not a little salty, and there was probably some MSG because I was a little thirsty afterwards. The chicken broth was a little more subtle. Overall, I liked the pho ga at Turtle Tower better because their broth seems more fragrant, and I liked the pho tai here better. Service was rather slow, and we had to ask for water twice before we got it. I do like the noodles and the broth in this style of pho, though.

Normally a little squirt of each to add a little zing does the trick, but this particular time I had to continuously add more sauces and lime to enhance the flavor.  \n\nThe beef was extremely tough to where you would be chewing it thousands of times and it wouldn't get any softer.

Although the last time I ate here, I left very thirsty, which is sometimes an indication of too much MSG. oh well... wouldn't be good if it wasn't!\n\nThe imperial rolls/egg rolls are just ok, not really Vietnamese style but more Chinese style (which the skin that they use).\n\nI have never eaten anything here but the Pho Ga.

I've come here for imperial rolls before but never had the balls to try the infamous wide noodles sans bean sprouts and, gasp!, served straight up with no basil -- only lime and jalapeno.  \n\nOf course I had to customize it (read: Saigon-ify it) for my palate.  Here is what to do: come in a group of two or more and convince somebody in your party to order the crab and tomato soup, because not only is it a deliciously different treat, the finely shredded raw cabbage that comes with it makes an excellent substitute for the missing bean sprouts in your pho!  I am sure there are people who will hate me for doing this.  Even the waiter advised me against it.  It's just that I really need the extra fiber, excuse. (TMI!)\n\nAnyway I think I like the beef broth here more than anywhere else in SF, it's definitely in my top four or five beef broths ever.

Being a northern style restaurant, there were no beansprouts and mint leaves to drop in (which is fine since I don't think it would go well with this pho), but plenty of jalapenos and lime (which does go well).  Plus, rather than the usual pho noodles you would get, they give you the wider, flat noodles instead which was a nice change.  There was plenty of meat in the order, but the broth was just okay - it was less oily than PPQ's, but maybe that's why it seemed to be a little lighter on flavor and spice than what I'm used to.  As for the Imperial Rolls, they were a little disappointing not so much in the flavor/taste (crispy, not overly fried), but in the size of the rolls that you get for the price (1/2 to 2/3 the size of a roll at most places).  The accompaniment of vermicelli noodles on the side was nice though. \n\nTheir menu isn't as expansive as other restaurants I've seen, but I imagine this is in part because it's a northern style restaurant.

If you read the awning, it says Hanoi style.  Guess what, Hanoi is the birthplace of pho.  In the north, pho is served without sprouts and basil - just a slice of lime and sliced chilis.  Southern Vietnamese changed it up a little and started adding star anise to the broth - and also the bean sprouts and basil.  Guess who fled Viet Nam mostly during the war?  South Vietnamese.  That's why most all pho restaurants in the US are southern style.\n\nAlso, since when has packaged noodles become more welcome than freshly made noodles?  This place has soft, flat, thick noodles that go down like butta.  Why would you even want a choice?  And what would your choices be?  Egg noodle?  Come on.  It's like saying, \"I can't believe I wasn't able to order a wheat sourdough bread.\"  The broth isn't overwhelmingly beefy, but atleast it's not fake MSG flavored like 95 percent of the pho restaurants in California.\n\nI agree with Dawn that everyone has been brainwashed by bad pho joints!  This is one of the best out there.  It tastes like someone actually cooked up the bowl - instead of the flavor that all pho restaurants taste like.", "author": "Minkz N."}

It's a pretty light broth, not much fish sauce or MSG, if they even use MSG.  \n\nTheir wide noodles weren't the best I've had, but still good.  The best wide noodles are still at Pho Ga Huong Que in Oakland.\n\nOnly garnishes were lime and jalapenos, scallions and cilantro are pre-added to the bowl.\n\nThe beef was fresh and dark, Tai was similar to Turtle Tower, pounded to tenderness.

The restaurant was getting fairly crowded so we wanted to leave to give our table to other customers coming in. There were 2 workers, (1 male & 1 female), wandering around. My boyfriend flagged down the male worker & asked for the bill & he gave us an \"ok\". We were waiting for about 5 minutes watching him do other stuff besides getting our bill. Apparently, there were 3 guys waiting outside for a table (I guess the regulars) and the male worker quickly set up their table, gave them special cups ( customers usually get the tall nasty plastic cup, but these guys get the Chinese ceramic cups)  & a tea pot for the table. After that, the worker started chatting up with the regulars while we were waiting for our bills. It's like we don't exist anymore... Being fed up with that crappy service, I waved down the female worker & asked for the bill, she quickly gave us the bill, but there was no amount on it! I was like \" Cool.. free meal!\" We could have easily gotten up & left because they weren't paying attention to anyone! But my boyfriend made me tell the female worker..  so I flagged her down & told her \"You didn't write an amount\" She was like \" Oh, ok.\" She quickly took the bill & just wrote \"$15.95\" & rudely handed the bill back to us.. so we just paid it & left. Closed the door & NEVER coming back!\n\n- The tea tasted weird... tasted like soap. I don't think they wash their dishes all too well! GROSS!!!\n\n- CASH ONLY!

Pho Quan Ngon is a northern vietnamese style place and that is the type I like more.  There is sparse condiments.  The noddles are a little thicker.  To give a better analogy, think a hot dog without the ketchup/mustard/relish or a hamburger without the buns.  Har har...i digress.  The service is lightening fast...like click our heels 3 times fast.  I ordered, blinked, and my food was set besides me.  This pho joint is run by genies.  The pho is good.  It has a rather greasy sheen to it, but the meatballs were good and the noodles soft.  My girlfriend ordered the beef carpaccio, which was the first time I had raw beef ever.  It was not to my liking.  It was sweet and had a weird taste.\n\nTo bid you adieu, pho quan ngon is a no nonsense pho joint.  You go in there, scratch your left food with your other foot, and slurp your pho.  The only downside is that is is cash only so I suggest you sit near the door if you intend to eat n ditch.  But please, keep it rieu and do not be a bad human being unless there are dire circumstances where you must avoid the bill.", "author": "Brian V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-01", "description": "Very good pho tai.  They use the wide egg noodle, which is okay, but which I don't prefer, but more than make up for it with an excellent broth.  The soup is very rich and meaty and really sticks to the tongue.", "author": "Eric W."}

The broth was kind of bland and I really prefer the small rice noodles and the choice to add my bean sprouts and basil. We also ordered the fish cakes that the waitress recommended but they tasted more herby than fishy...which we didn't like that much either. I wouldn't come back.", "author": "Tiff L."}

I found a long strand of hair in my pho. SO GROSS!!!! I mention this to the server and he asked if I would like something else.  Because I was with my friend and he just got his food I did not want to make a big deal.  The server offered to bring me another bowl of pho.  When the second bowl came I fished around and saw ANOTHER piece of hair in the pho.  I would not recommend this or any of the other location to anyone unless you want to eat something that is disgustingly.", "author": "Beau S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-09", "description": "First of all, I grew up on my mom's cooking.  She made the BEST pho, bun rieu, cha gio. You name it, she made it. All my aunties agreed that hers was the best. Now that my mom is not with us, I either have to cook it myself or find a close second. That being said, this place is great when I don't feel like cooking.  My husband and I tried this place last week and I held up a cha gio (imperial roll) and told him I'm glad I know how to make this, but damn it's close. I have not ordered the pho yet, but will next week when we go back.  I ordered the bun rieu (noodle soup with crab and tomato) and my husband ordered the oxtail stew in wine sauce. I just want to say that it is rare to get a clean, clear  broth that tastes this good.  I noticed that the first time i ordered this soup. My soup was served with mint, cabbage, chilies and lime, with a side of shrimp paste. It was all good.  My husband's meal came with rice and french bread for dipping. The cha gio came with lettuce, noodles, some pickled carrots, and nouc mam for wrapping and dipping.  But the thing that made my meal great was that when i ordered it in Vietnamese, our waitress not realizing I spoke, started talking to me in Vietnamese.  I haven't spoken my mother tongue in years and it felt good.  I think my husband was impressed as he has never heard me speak it.  I even ordered his meal for him. Ooooo now he knows I'm a cunning linguist.  We have been here twice, and will be coming back for sure.  The wait staff work together and always greet you and bid you good bye.  The food is not fancy, but it's not supposed to be. Oh yeah, there's DDR rave music playing in the background.  It's not loud or anything, just worthy of noting...", "author": "kim s."}
