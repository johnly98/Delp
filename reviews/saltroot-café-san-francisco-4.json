This place has relaxing and upbeat music with and large inviting Windows. When I first walked in, I was pleasantly surprised that the heater was turned on. After sitting in here for 10 minutes, I had to take off my scar and then my jacket, wishing it was less warm as it became stuffy. Anyway...\n\nI'm a little disappointed they don't do chai lattes here, BUT the tea is good and it comes with a delicious popover! I chose the Parmesan one, found it to be so good that I ordered two more--one parm and one guava. They're slightly crispy/crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey-like interior. The texture is quite pleasant. The parm one is cheesy and savory, so delicious! The guava one tastes like guava and is just the right amount of sweetness. It didn't have as much guava filling as some of the their pictures I saw though. Both are great with tea!  \n\nI'll def be back for more tea and popovers!", "author": "Angie Y."}

This is a small and intimate shop with limited seating so it's not ideal for big groups. I think a lot of people tend to grab and go rather than sit down so I think you would be able to find a place to seat if you plan to dine-in. The shop seems to be run by just one guy (at least when we were there), so the service can be a bit on the slower end, but the wait is not bad at all. \n\nMy favorite part of this place is that they give you a FREE cheese puff with any hot drink purchases. This includes any of the coffees and teas but excludes the juices. There are a couple of different flavors for the cheese puffs that you can order in addition but the cheese puff that comes with the drink is the original one. I absolutely loved the texture of the cheese puffs. It reminded me of the mocha bread at Asian bakery sometimes since it's pretty chewy. My sister had ordered a guava cheese puffs with her orange juice, and I was a little surprised that the guava cheese puffs are still on the more savory side. The cheese flavor for these cheese puffs are pretty strong so they are on the savory end even if you order the sweeter flavors like guava. \n\nI had ordered the tea with turmeric and ginger because I was feeling a bit under the weather and it was pretty good. It was definitely on the lighter side but I just liked that they had the option that seemed to hit the spot for someone who wasn't feeling well. It was a great alternative to the coffee drinks.\n\nThe menu was pretty simple, which I liked. They also have free wifi! I think this is a nice little cafe and would love to come back and try out the other cheese puff flavors.", "author": "Nina W."}

It's a small and quaint cafe, but we managed to secure a table in the corner.\n\nEach beverage comes with a cheese pop-ups, which looks so simple but makes your taste buds explode with joy. It's dangerous that they sell these for taking home... I could sit in front of Netflix and snack on them forever. The empanadas are amazing, too. So fresh, flaky, and tasty.\n\nEverything about the experience at Saltroot Cafe is carefully crafted. It feels casual yet classy to be here.

The atmosphere is warm and cozy, calm and bright. The coffee is fantastic, served with a cheese popup. I always order extra of these because they are so unique and delicious! The service is also excellent. They are so aware of and responsive to any need you may have. Whether it's helping me clean up a spill or giving me two apples instead of the one I purchased \"because they are small\", these guys make me feel taken care of. It's such a comfortable environment. And they even have a bunch of plugs for all your charging needs.", "author": "Natalie W."}

After doing a bit of searching on yelp for another cafe to work at in my neighborhood, I found Saltroot, which numerous reviewers said would be a good place to study/work.\n\nThe place is small. Which is totally fine - it is well lit with natural lighting and big windows, and simple decorations to make it feel homey. But its size means that even two people having a conversation with each other will take over the entire environment and make you, willing or not, a listener. Maybe I was just unlucky with timing, with numerous chatty Cathy's and one lady on her phone (why people do this in cafes where people are obviously working as opposed to taking their call outside is beyond me). \n\nIn regards to their food/beverages offerings, I had a smoothie. It was just alright if I'm being honest.", "author": "Natalie H."}

The coffee was a little on the pricey side ($5 for a latte), but each drink came with a cheese pop-up so it probably wasn't too bad of a deal once you take the tasty bite into account.\n\nMy husband and I ordered a latte and a drip coffee, two empanadas (one spinach and feta, the other mushroom and gorgonzola) and two cheese popups (so we got four total, taking the complimentary ones into account). The pop ups come in a variety of flavors. We had two plain, one guava, and one mustard potato. \n\nCoffee: The beans are from intelligentsia. Both coffee drinks were solid. The latte came out blazing hot, but was quite tasty once it was cool enough to drink. \n\nEmpanadas: Very flavorful filling, yummy tasty crust. They're not very big but they're pretty rich, so one each was plenty for us (especially with the cheese pop ups).\n\nCheese bread: Chewier than I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing. The one we had right out of the oven was soft and warm...yum. The others were tasty too. The flavored ones were fun to try, but I think my favorite was the basic cheese pop up. :) FYI you can buy them frozen so you an eat them fresh at home.\n\nOverall: This was a fun place to discover, but probably won't become a destination spot for us because it's a little far from our home base. The staff was super friendly, the ambience is chill, and there aren't very many places in the city to get tasty Brazilian bites, let alone cheesy ones. :) I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a little something different but for whom quality coffee is nonnegotiable.", "author": "Ali S."}

I have tried their pao de queijo (Brazilian cheese puffs), empanadas and coffee. All are superb. I had only tried pao de queijo when a Brazilian friend made them, but they seem simple yet tricky to make, so I was happy to find this place. They offer various flavors. I think my favorite is the gorgonzola one. The price is great, too--$3 for coffee and one puff! I also enjoyed their lunch option of three pao with different fillings. They seem healthier than European style pastries (ie, croissants and other butter and sugar laden treats), and FWIW, they are gluten free! They also offer a vegan version, too. Coffee is superb. Empanadas are also tasty, but I haven't tried them as much as the pao de queijo. Parking is tricky, but if you ask the owners, they have a helpful hint.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

Maybe you've traveled extensively through Brazil and know what I'm talking about. Or maybe you're just a hipster foodie who rolls his own on Sunday mornings. But for the rest of us mere mortals running between Korean taco trucks and tonkotsu Ramen specials, let me tell you, you need to stop and smell the queijo. It's these little delightful cheesy puffy thingies but that's like calling Delfina just bread with cheese. It's like a salty cheese-infused golden crusty doughy little puffy thing-a-magic that disappears in a bite. More importantly, I now have a bag in my freezer. Anyway, I digress. As for the yelp review. Great little spot. It's in the outer rims of Clement, where a lot of the good finds are. Good juices, legit coffee, friendly dude with kind of a Justin Timberlake fro behind the counter. But the pao de queijo is what you go for.", "author": "Sid S."}
