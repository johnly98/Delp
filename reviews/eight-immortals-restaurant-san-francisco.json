Good wok heat flavor.  \n\n - Beef Chow Fun with Gravy $8.00 - 4/5\nThe taste is still the same as last time which the gravy was a little salty.

This hole-in-the-wall restaurant is located on Taraval Street, very close to other Chinese bakeries and shops. Whenever we come here, we park across the street from the restaurant and walk over. Paying for parking is a hassle, but like with anywhere you visit in SF, there will always be parking meters. \n\nMy family usually comes here for dinner after spending a day in San Francisco. We've been customers for many years now and like to order from their \"set-list\" menu, where the food is served banquet style. It's a pretty good way to order food and also get a variety of delicious flavors. You get soup to start with and dessert to finish! \n\nEnvironment:\nPretty small and enclosed space. Very loud whenever we go too. The noise level escalates very easily due to just how small the restaurant is. There aren't that many tables either, but we never have a problem getting seated right away. There are some round tables with the rest being regular rectangle ones. The kitchen is also located in the back, but noise from the cooking and preparation of the food travels all throughout the restaurant. \n\nFood:\nI recommend their deep fried flounder fish with soy sauce! It's one of my favorites there! The fish is fried to the perfect level and the sauce that comes with it is amazing (not too salty). The Peking spare ribs, on the other hand, are mediocre. My sister thought that the sauce tasted very fake and artificial. They are also overly fried, which made the ribs very difficult to eat. I would also recommend the Mongolian beef and the chicken and salt fish fried rice! The Mongolian beef is very authentic and the chicken and the fried rice is just absolutely the most mouthwatering--love the seafood flavors that are packed in and you can really taste the heat from the wok in each bite! Lastly, you can't go wrong with any of their tofu dishes either! Love that food is all priced very inexpensively too! \n\nService:\nEight Immortals does not focus on the presentation of the food. Like with most Chinese restaurants, you shouldn't expect to have the best experience when you dining here. The service is also on par with everything else here. Service is very prompt, but waitresses do not check up on you. If you need something, you really have to go out of your way to get their attention. The most they did was take our dishes away when the plates until we were finished. \n\nLast Thoughts:\nI would say just let the food speak for itself!! Overall, my family still loves to come back and eat here every once in a while. Pretty great all around!", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Ok so I'm working in he SF area with a crew, we all agreed on Chinese and this was the closest location. I looked online menu, I just wanted a side of broccoli beef it said it was only $4 so I figured it might be a small portion and got a appetizer pot stickers also $4 online. When we got there to pick up food she said it would be $17 something!???? I asked why she said \"new prices\" so I said I didn't want the pot stickers, she wouldn't let me take them off my order! So basically I had to pay for it all or not eat that night since we didn't have enough time to stop somewhere else. Finally got to sit down and eat and it was disgusting!!! The pot stickers were half burnt & half mushy, how does that even happen!?? The broccoli beef had a ton of ginger in it, after 2 bites I was sick. Horrible experience!

Where one gets shut down another is teetering to keep its health score up.  The struggle is real here.  \n\nThe food is nothing short of your average drowned in a corn starchy sauce Chinese fare.  Fresh flavors are lacking here like cleanliness.  If it wasn't for family members, I would never have come here.  It was disheartening that I was unable to find a clean chair without some sort of wet substance or the idle attempts of wiping, only to leave visible smear marks  on the seat.  \n\nI decided to order the shredded duck silver noodle soup with vegetables.  \"Vegetables\" was an overzealous listing as an ingredient with only sparse amounts of Chinese pickled greens.  In fact, the 5 or so \"shreds\" of duck and these bits of pickled greens, served as garnish to the heaping bowl of noodles sitting in a puddle of broth.  This bowl of soup noodles is the biggest joke of noodle soup I've seen in my entire life.  If I wanted a bowl of noodles, I would have just ordered that.  We ended up using all these noodles as rice with the main dishes.  The fried pork chops, fish with bok choy, beef & tofu and chicken and mushrooms can all be categorized the same way - average with mininal flavor, swimming in greasy sauce, and stingy with certain ingredients.\n\nThe service is on par with everything else here.  You won't get anything unless you make a serious effort to get someone's attention.  The heaps of empty plates and dirty dishes from our entire meal with all of us idling around the table waiting for the bill wasn't obvious enough to bring the bill. Boss lady got the sign finally when I stared at the kiosk long enough until she looked my way though.\n\nI didn't find bugs in my food or see any cockroaches, but I wouldn't be surprised.  This restaurant's condition, food and service is sacrilegious to Chinese mythology's Eight Immortals.  Blasphemous!", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

But this place was surprisingly decent looking and the price was cheaper than what I would expect. All four of us each got one dish and the total turned out to be $40! Heads up they don't split checks to those who are paying with credit/debit cards so bring cash if you guys are planning on splitting the check. Our food was served within ten minutes after ordering. My boyfriend and I got the Mongolian beef on rice and it was delicious! The portion they serve you will definitely get you full when you walk in with an empty stomach. My little brother got the porridge which was on their \"special menu\" and he said it was flavorful but extremely hot. The portion of the porridge can definitely serve about two-three people as an \"appetizer.\" They definitely do serve you fresh authentic Chinese food. Please don't expect amazing service and to be pampered like what you would receive from any other well trained restaurant. Service was good, but it's like your average family owned authentic Chinese restaurant where you have to flag them down for any request. Besides San Tung on Irving Street, Eight Immortal will definitely be one of my boyfriend's and my new go to places in the city when we're craving for Chinese food.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Not talking about HK nouvelle cuisine, but those classics like steamed salted egg or fish over pork, fried taro duck, and shrimp egg foo yung... wait a sec, what is that?!  \nBack to my experience, I studied some Yelp photos from this sleepy Sunset mainstay, finding three attractive dishes for a recent dinner with my parents.  Here's what we ate:\n\n1) Steamed razor clams (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xud4P0ciA1UgVArGR1xO4w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Presented in shell, medium slices topped a hefty bed of cellophane noodles.  As mentioned in some other reviews on other dishes, the flavor is on the bland side.  Not sure whether they forgot the soy green onion dipping sauce that usually accompanies this .\n\n2) Taro duck (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NUXlREghRzjiDhwqUZcKzQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My memory of this is the fried taro puff dim sum sandwiching lean duck meat slices.  Their rendition is nicely fried (not too greasy), but the taro texture is on the dense side which lessened the crisp on this.\n\n3) Steamed salted egg minced pork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lcLRWBMVlLa-FnGIdBiIXg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Generous portion, the flavors were good though a tad on the dry side.  Perfect with a bowl of rice with a couple spoonfuls of the juice.\n\n4). Foo Chow fried rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LfiMjjwsVug0D4FXYuWYSw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Again large portions, the flavors were nice as the chef has a light hand on salt and soy or oyster sauce.  Dominated by bay shrimp, there was a smattering of shiitake mushrooms, dried scallops, and sliced Chinese brocolli.\n\nThe food did not disappoint as the flavor profile fit our family's palate.  My father prefers heavier flavors which he satisfied by adding light soy sauce.  Just don't expect a HK gourmet meal at these prices here.  They also cooked and packed my order in about 20 minutes.  Parking here can be tough peak hours but, arriving at 5:45 pm on a Saturday, street parking was available.  May add this to the family dinner rotation.", "author": "Mike C."}

The outside of the restaurant may not look like much... in fact... it is a very 'hole in the wall' type place, but the food is oh so tasty! And to top it off, it's reasonably priced too!\n\nThis year my family decided not to do the traditional huge Thanksgiving cook-off at home and came out to Eight Immortals for dinner. Like many Chinese restaurants, Eight Immortals IS open Thanksgiving day! The restaurant was abuzz with activity and people. I actually think the amount of people in the restaurant today was quite standard for a night here. This restaurant seems to be popular and frequented by people in the neighborhood.\n\nThough there were many people we were still able to get a table pretty quickly. We were handed menus, but many of the best items can be ordered from the wall. Make sure you check the walls to see what special items they have!\n\nTonight was decided on some delicious chinese bean sprout leaves (these are AWESOME), half crispy chicken, fish, and two tofu dishes (one braised with vegetables and the other fried). I was a little hesitant to go for two tofu dishes... but I'm really glad we did because they were quite different from each other. The fried tofu squares were so good I think I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. I'd definitely recommend this dish if you come here. It comes out piping hot, and the tofu is perfectly crispy on the outside, melt in your mouth silky on the inside, and tastes amazing.\n\nTo finish the meal off, the server brought us red bean soup dessert - a wonderful ending to the meal.\n\nTonight our server talked to us a bit about his opinion about Black Friday. Though he was fluent in Cantonese, and spoke to us in Cantonese when we ordered... we actually carried on a conversation in perfect English too! I was a bit surprised... but I'm not sure why I should be!\n\nOverall it was a great night out with delicious food and friendly service.

The sea salt portion was a little stingy but I love squab and this was a perfect appetizer. \n\nThe deep fried flounder was larger than the large plate it came on. The sauce was under the fish rather than poured over the fish and really completes the fish. It was light crispy batter fried. Not greasy in the slightest,  nor did you get an oily after taste.\n\nThe walnut prawns were different than you usually get in the walnuts were roasted but not candied. Good, clean taste. The mustard greens were perfect not hard to chew or stringy.

I love the casual atmosphere & friendly service.  The pot stickers are crispy golden with a wonderful ground pork, ginger, & cabbage mixture; perfect with the well balanced sweet & sour sauce.  Thje beef lo mein is okay; the beef could have3 more flavor, but everything else 0is wonderful including the wonderful egg thin noodles with a bit of wok char taste.  The sweet & sour spareribs are crispy with a lite badder & tangy Hong Kong style sweet & sour sauce; there is just enough to coat the ribs & no excess sauce.  The filet of rock dod with black bean sauce is flaky & tender with onions & green peppers in a flavorful black bean sauce.  Round it off with a Ching Dao or glass of wine & you will not be4 disappointed.  So, for some bargin Cantonese food in a friendly casual atmosphere, Eight Emortals cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.", "author": "Brian S."}

To my surprise there was a parking spot on Taraval Street right in front. Free parking on Sundays that's great. We were a party of four and ordered our normal faire Peking Duck, Pork Fried Rice, Seasoned Greens with Garlic, Mongolian Beef, Deep Fried Flounder and Wonton Soup. Although the food was still good I took away 3 stars because number one our waiter seemed to intentionally place his thumb in all four of our soup bowls! Lucky thing they gave us all a glass of water I hope he didn't place his fingers inside each cup?  I then used the water  to wipe the bowls out. About fifteen minutes into our meal I saw the waiter off to the side playing with his cell phone? People please leave your phones alone while you are on duty. Is it too much for you to wait until your break? I have never seen him before so maybe he is new. The wait staff that the previous owners employed were much more professional. One more thing since we did request soft drinks and on warm days like today maybe next time you could give us some glasses with some ice cubes in them?

It's quite possibly the most delicious time of the year.\n\nThe meal started with some tofu soup which was hot and warmed the soul as it went down.  With that came the jelly fish course which was briny and crunchy, and tasted of the sea.  The main courses came out about this time and was made up of a stir-fried lobster with garlic sauce, stir-fried crab in ginger sauce, salt and pepper pork chops, steamed shrimp, scallops with squid and vegetables, fried sand dab, stir-fried clams in black bean sauce, fried calamari, and of course steamed rice.  My favorites were the pork chops and lobster, those the shell fish is always a little bit of a pain to eat.  It was all pretty good but I will say it wasn't the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.  The fish was WAY overcooked and might have been old to boot.  The fried calamari was also overdone.  Despite that, I'll never turn down a Chinese feast and I'm always up for cleaning my plate when there's food around.\n\nService was pretty dismal all night and they were totally slammed.

Thirteen families averaging eight people per table, share large passed plates of glossy, good-looking stuff. Is it rude to point and say \"I want what they are having?\" \n\nA compliment to the chef, my family is the only one of European ancestry. The wait is short. One thing to note. There are no parties of one or two here. \n\nThis place was made for families. The largest tables don lazy Susans. ( a device which acts as a rotating platter on the table) It is the perfect way to share platters of food. \n\nWe read the specials that were in English on the wall, which listed the more rare seasonal dishes. There were some neat ones! Whole crab, whole steamed bass and interesting animals and organ parts like frogs and faces etc. I am almost kidding about the face part. Were my skittish family not with me, I would have gone for an exotic item to have tried it for the first time. Like Anthony Bourdain! \n\nAfter making my food allergies very clear to our server, we ordered the whole steamed bass. One and a half pounds at $12.99 per pound, mixed vegetables with mushrooms in clear garlic sauce, combination seafood flat rice noodles, (no gravy) chicken curry, rice and tea for the table. \n\nGluten free friends, Chinese food is very hard to eat for us. We can not eat soy sauce, black bean sauce, barbecued meats, marinated meats, oyster sauce, Hoisin sauce, dumplings or hot and sour soup. What is left? Clear sauce, egg drop soup (no egg noodles) and curry. Be very clear about the \"clear\" part. If your food has any tint of brown color anywhere, chances are that you are allergic to it. \n\nThe good news is that you can have rice and rice pastas etc. This restaurant is a wonderful treat for my gluten free friends who take the time to be clear about their allergies. Only clear sauce! No gravy! \n\nThe whole steamed bass was covered in shredded Chinese leeks.(four stars) My sister said: \"It's looking at me!\" Ha ha! It was accompanied by a very good sauce of yellow broth and crunchy garlic for me and traditional brown sauce as well for the family. I was confident that my sauce was superior and confirmed it when my family preferred my sauce to theirs when seasoning the bass. (five stars) \n\nThe vegetables were good, not great, (3.5 stars) the curry chicken was very mild with large chunks of potato, the sauce was a little thin for my taste (3.5 stars) \n\nOur favorite dish was the rice pasta with combination seafood. (five stars) We ordered more, we liked it so much. Gluten free friends, rice pasta, made fresh, is even better than the egg noodles off limits to you! Large flat rice noodles with fresh bok choy, shrimp and squid. This dish is traditionally made with soy sauce but can be made with nothing but salt on request. It is light, delicate and de-freaking-licious. They don't punk out on he seafood here friends. The large portion of shellfish makes this dish an outstanding value at only $6. \n\nThe menu is huge, the service is good, the prices are obscenely affordable, the food is great.

The dish arrived  bubbling hot and loaded with huge chunks of fresh ginger and I do mean huge. Of course you don't eat the ginger but the savory brown sauce and the chicken infused with the spicy ginger along with the scallions was this side of Heaven.\n\nHong Kong style noodles with sliced beef was perfectly executed and delicious.\n\nSauteed A-Choy (That's a green vegetable native of south Taiwan) tender, flavorful and so fresh tasting you'd swear it was picked from a garden moments before.

I regular this spot for lunch for their amazingly cheap lunch prices.  Rice plates range from $4.75-$6.00.  Can't beat it! \n\nAside from being extremely reasonably priced,  I really enjoy the food here too.  Cheap and good is a rare combo these days.   \n\nFor the portion size, they could easily be charging a bit more, but they don't. No complaints here.  What I come for are simple dishes that satisfy those cravings. \n\nMy favorite comfort dish is Minced Beef with Raw Egg Over Rice.  What I love about this dish in comparison to other restaurants that also serve it, is that they included peas, carrots and chopped onions to add that extra flavor. I've had this dish at plenty of places before that most spots only give you peas for texture. Saucy and flavor, and just the way I like it. If this doesn't scream simple and comforting Chinese food, then I don't know what else does.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/R7QrC8pX9luLd5cx3Fzl3A?select=zLb5aTwZkdrrhGjQAqOFZA\n\nI also like to order their noodle dishes for lunch as well.  Other favorites are the Hong Kong Style Combination Noodles and the Tomato Beef Chow Mein.\n\nWhat's nice about the Combination Noodles is that there's plenty of variety.  Good options for seafood, and for meat in one dish.  Included are BBQ Pork (Cha Siew), Chicken, and pieces of Beef.  There's also Prawns, Scallops and Calamari, and of course your much needed Bok Choy.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/R7QrC8pX9luLd5cx3Fzl3A?select=rUjZjgAS6nlQpMEu2aWByg\n\nTomato Beef is also quite flavorful and included good pieces of beef.

Haha. \n\nCome here early, like 6-6.30pm. Anytime after that, you'll be waiting for a while! I think it's related to good luck or something, but some Chinese people thinks that if you change something that's going well, you'll ruin it. That's why I know the owner of this place can easily move this restaurant and find a bigger space. But I bet he thinks it's bad luck. With the way business is going in this place, owner must be well cushioned for retirement. I love his hard working attitude though. He is always here, almost every single day, along with his wife. They make sure things run smoothly and employee acts accordingly. That is the sign of a very excellent owner!\n\nAnyway, entrees are pretty cheap here, considering this is SF and everything is overpriced. They have a great selection of food, and if you speak Chinese, you can pretty much ask for anything and they'll make it for you. The quality of food is 100% consistently really good, always!! It's not too greasy, the portions are sufficiently generous, and they do not hold anything back for the sake of money in order for customers to be happy with the food. You can order pretty much anything and you'll be happy here!

As a child, I wasn't so picky. As long as I got an Inca Cola, I would eat whatever supposedly good-for-me seafood they would shove my way. Looking back though, I wouldn't  eat there now. The food is quite heavy, and filled with msg. Every dish save the white rice seems to be sprayed with oil. It's as though they use oil instead of another seasoning to dress the food before it can go out. \n\nRecently, I guess my family felt pangs of nostalgia, we decided to eat there again. We knew that the previous owners had retired, but we wanted to see that one kind faced and dimpled smiling waitress who had watched me grow up. We wanted her to take our order as she'd done so many times in the past. As though it were justification for our being there, an acknowledgement that though the passage of time can bring sudden change, pleasant reminders of the past are still around if you look closely enough.\n\nBut the food was sh*t. Everything tasted like it came out from cans of Chef Boyarechi. Eugh, never going there again.\n\nStar for that waitress, another star for nostalgia, one more star for Inca Colas, and finally, a negative star for horrible food.", "author": "Alan H."}

That was their polite way of addressing her.  It was like watching a old Chinsee kung fu movie with the boss lady sitting in the store front collecting money.\n\nWe were seated at this weird table that were two \"four tops\" put together.  I guess the purpose was to seat 6 but is was jammed in between two tablest so you really couldn't sit two people at the end.  We didn't like the configuration so we asked to change tables.  The people at the end could not reach the food at the other end because of the length of the table.  So instead of just moving it to the new table, the waiter cleared the new table and literally moved everything from the old table...placements etal.  Tacky...really tacky or pure inexperience.\n\nOur meal for the evening consisted of deep fried flounder, crispy chicken, salt and pepper ribs, walnut shrimp, mustard greens and steamed eggs with clams.\n\nThe deep fried flounder was cooked to the right temperature.  The mustard greens was slightly oily.  The chips on the crispy chicken was soggy and stale...ca't anyone fry it correctly.  The salt and pepper was more salt than pepper.  The walnut shrimp was soggy and the walnut were stale.  The steamed eggs was cooked nice...good favor.\n\nDespite the food's short fall, it was still an ok meal.

Dishes started coming out pretty quickly and universally I can say that every dish was almost totally without flavor.  I know that Cantonese food is mild, but it should have some flavor!  Then after 4-5 dishes had been served we get the news that the extra dish we wanted was not available - even though we had ordered it 5 days ahead of time!  So we ordered another dish.  Then the extra dish that we originally wanted that wasn't available suddenly makes an appearance.  This did not sit well with my Chinese friends - they felt that we had just been nudged into ordering more food than we really wanted...\n\nThen about 3 dozen Lincoln High School kids trooped in to order their fried rice - the noise level went up so high that we could no longer converse among ourselves.  \n\nSo, after you read this, you still want to eat pretty flavorless, not very well prepared food in somewhat mingy portions, don't go at lunch time on a weekday - unless you like lots of loud teenagers.\n\nBetter yet, go down the street and go to Ming's Diner - much better food!", "author": "Karen M."}

I've seen this hole in the wall Chinese when I go for ice cream at Marco Polo next door, but have not gotten the courage to walk in as the place looks a bit like a prison from the outside.  The interior really isn't all that great either as it looks a bit like a funeral parlor.  Since the reviews were fairly positive on Yelp, I thought I order a take out and give it a shot.   It's simple and a bit rustic, but surprisingly the Cantonese  food was quite good for the price.\n\nWe ordered a Beef with Snow Peas ($6.50) which was very flavorful.  The beef quality could be a bit better and there could be more beef, but for 6.50 it's hard to complain.  \n\nThe Fried Duck($6)  with Taro was also very yummy.  It was perfectly crisp and not greasy at all.  The sauce that came with it went well with the entree.  It's mostly Taro so there could be more duck, but again it was only $6!  So, can't complain here either.  I've had a version of this in a nice Cantonese restaurant in Hong Kong when I was a kid which was phenomenal.  Like most High Chinese dishes, it was labor intensive and involved multiple steps of boiling, deep frying and baking, coating and re-coating (like the real Peking duck).  This obviously is a much humbler version, but tasty non-the-less.\n\nThe last item, Pea Shoots with Garlic ($9), was simple but very well stir-fried.  The Pea Shoots were tender which means that they got rid of the not-so-tender parts of the shoot.  Many places keep more of the shoot than they should to increase profits....   \n\nThe negative is that there's quite a bit of MSG in their food since they don' t use a lot of meat in the dishes, it's one way to enhance the flavor.  So, if you're tolerance for MSG is low, you may want to skip this place or see if they can make the dishes without MSG. \n\nI would recommend getting the food to go, unless you're okay with a rather depressing, sparse, windowless environment.  It's definitely worth a drive for their simple Cantonese items.  But remember to stick with Cantonese items (nothing Sichuan or Mandarin!).\n\n4 stars is for the food only.\n\n2 stars for decor and service.", "author": "Paul K."}

I don't eat pork, so I can't tell you how the pork is; but the broth is pretty flavorful, the noodles are good, and the veggies in the soup are nicely cooked. They give a good amount, too. \n\nChinese Style Beef Cubes On Rice- $3.50 for lunch. My dad likes to order this and likes it a lot. He asks for it to be curry style, which they do for him. I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds good.\n\nThere was a time that my boyfriend was craving steamed chicken with green onions and garlic/ginger sauce and we ordered it from here. Apparently they didn't know what he was trying to order because they gave us some kind of chicken that was more similar to kung pao chicken. Not a very good experience for my boyfriend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-25", "description": "This is another restaurant I have some childhood memories.  My recollections of 8 Immortals are of home-style Cantonese food and their signature waiter with a permed out fro and big o' eyebrows that grew a half an inch from each side of his face.  He was a funny guy to say the least.    \n\nOn that Friday night, I decided to take my family there for old time's sakes since we haven't been here in ages.  When we got there we were seated immediately.  Usually on the busy times, there would be a wait.  Everything seemed the same as usual, but cleaner than what I remember.  \n\nThe service was very personable as expected and they took our order pretty fast.  \n\nWe ended up ordering something along the lines of this: clams with black bean sauce, oyster clay pot with tofu, deep fried taro duck (not a lot of places have this), and walnut prawns.  Since we have three \"rice buckets\" in our family, we got white rice.  (Yeah, you saw that right.  There are no vegetables on that list.)  \n\nWe ended up eating about half, consequently, leaving a lot of leftovers.  The food was satisfactory.  Much of the dishes were on the salty side (even the walnut prawns seemed salty) or was drenched in its sauce.     \n\nComparing the food of then and now, the quality hadn't improved, but the prices went up.  This place isn't expensive, but with competition of comparable quality or better in the area, the price tag makes a difference with the focus on their quality.  Back in the day, if one could believe, they used to have some $3 dollar entrees.   \n\nIf I were to recommend a Cantonese restaurant, I wouldn't recommend this place.  I would send that person to Ming's Diner.  8 Immortals is cleaner, and the service a tiny bit better than Ming's (depending on your perspective).  When looking for home-style Cantonese food, the food quality/price comparison is advantageous in favor of Ming's Diner.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Tonight's dinner was a new low in a long string of occasional visits over the past few years as I kept hoping for a new chef or improvement to their menu.  I won't be going back.  \n\nFor about $20 I got two simple dishes.  The first was steamed, shrimp-stuffed tofu.  The shrimp paste had either gone bad, or was a very cheap brand.  It was really fishy tasting -- no shrimp flavor at all.  The sauce was watery and almost flavorless.  The garlic guy lan had almost no garlic in it, and the dish was oily.  The oil would have been OK if it was full of garlic, but oily guy lan is not appealing.\n\nI got a very small bowl of rice packed in with an ice cream scooper, so it wasn't fluffy.  The rounded scoop made eating food on top of it impossible until I ate the plain rice down to a flat surface.  It was too small of a bowl to put food on top of the rice anyway, especially guy lan.  I don't know if they gave me this ridiculous serving because I am not Chinese and they didn't think I'd know better.  I also don't know if I got overcharged because I'm not Chinese; the price was way out of line with the food.  I didn't order off of a menu, and my bill wasn't itemized, so I don't know if they charge that much ordinarily.", "author": "elsa z."}

That was back in the early 1990's. Fast forward to the present. I was visiting my parents and was hankering for some Chinese food. I was flipping through their to go menu pile and spotted this place. I wonder if its still open. Better yet, I wonder if it's still good. I'm a gambling man... Ring ring... \n\n\"Hello 8 Immortals, what would you like?\" \n\"Wow, I'll call you right back!\" \n\nSo I flip through the old menu, reminiscing of the cheaper prices back in the day, looking for some dishes to order. My brother in law is caucasian so I needed to order some Chinese dishes that everyone can enjoy. I picked out:\n\nCrispy Taro Duck - I love taro. I LOVE duck. Naturally these two go hand in hand. They take some taro and place it on top of a slice of duck meat and then lightly batter and deep fry. YUM. It came with a gravy sauce to serve on top. The dish came with about 12 pieces.\n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - I usually always order this dish when I go to Chinese restaurants. I just love the mayo based sauce on deep fried shrimp. Served with honey walnuts and I'm golden. Dish came with about 15-18 pieces of shrimp.\n\nBeef Chow Fun - Typical beef chow fun. It had good flavor and it wasnt too greasy!\n\nBBQ Pork Fried Rice - Surprisingly good. I usually dont order fried rice since its just left over rice from the day before with egg and meat. Oh, and my dad always yells at me when I do. Haha. This one had a good flavor to it and unlike most places, it was not greasy!\n\nRoast Pork & Oyster Clay Pot - Yum! Another favorite dish of mine. Roast pork. Oysters. Tofu. Chinese Mushrooms. Tons of gravy so it goes soooo good with rice.\n\nBeef and Tofu - The staple dish for my niece. She loves tofu. LOVES. This dish was pretty good for being simple. I liked it.\n\nThe best part of the meal? When I went to pick up the food, I also grabbed a new to go menu. WOWSERS. The price probably went up like 50 cents to a $1 for each dish. Not bad considering how old the menu I had was. Still honey walnut shrimp for $8 is NOT BAD AT ALL!\n\nI also posted some mouth watering pictures. Seriously, if you dont get hungry looking at the pictures I posted...

I say I hate to admit it because it's rarely happened to me personally. I take a little bit of pride in being a long-time SF resident who understands that levels of service at restaurants in such a diverse place are naturally, culturally different. Which is to say that we're super patient and always ready to offer (or accept) an excuse for slow or virtually non-existant service. I say this also as someone who has worked and cooked at restaurants in the past. I'm patient. \n\nBut we clearly weren't their ideal customer. We were the only non-Chinese folks here for lunch on a Sunday, and it took us forever to get a menu or an order placed. And then it took eons to get our food made and sent to our table. We sat and watched people (who were still waiting in line for a table after we ordered) get sat, order, eat, and get their check before we even got a set of chopsticks and a cup of tea and a menu -- much less an order placed. (And then they gave us forks when we asked for chopsticks. Of course.) \n\nIt was unwelcoming, to say the least. We stuck it out as a matter of principle, but we may not go back. Food is decent, though, with a few standout dishes, but it's not awesome overall. They eschew condiments on their tables, which saddens me. The flavors are mostly on the tame side.", "author": "Casey C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-10", "description": "My friend from the Richmond District decided to bring me to Eight Immortals. The restaurant is understated with no windows to look into so it is very easy to miss if you are unfamiliar with the area. Upon entering, you can see a small but busy place with a lot of families eating there. The place is very good for family style dining and the atmosphere is warm and it makes you feel like home.\n\nThe food there is simply outstanding. The pea sprout leaves are a must. They also specialize in oysters which were fresh and tasty. I thought the two versions of Chicken with ginger and scallion were both delicious; with the Chinese style chicken less meaty but has a more flavor with every bite. I thought the combination seafood with bean curd clay pot was a bit overwhelmed with bean curd, but the sweet and sour beef steak cube was nice and tender. The quality of the food sets the standard for good Cantonese cuisine, enough for me to travel out of my way into the neighborhood. \n\nThe dishes I would not recommend are the roast duck and the double mushroom with bok choy. The duck was too dry and too skinny for my taste and the bok choy we had was old, not fresh. The honey walnut shrimp was good and on the sweet side, but I've had better elsewhere. But overall, this place keeps it down to earth and has yield great results. The atmosphere and food quality is fitting for large and small family gatherings, a good place to introduce your parent(s) to your new girl/boy friend, and your closest friends who don't need the fancy decors to be impressed.\n\nI wish there's an exciting dessert place on Taraval to visit after the meal. I'm a big fan of Eight Immortals and my friend from the Richmond District has finally put us back on the right track. For cultural authenticity, taste, freshness, this place deserves a five star rating. However, I'm giving it a 4 star since the food was a bit inconsistent on my third visit.

Definitely would order the Spicy Salt and Pepper shrimp over this.\n\nMongolian Beef: Alright, kind of on the salty side, good if you have steamed rice but doesn't go too well with the fried rice.\n\nShrimp in Lobster sauce: Didn't touch it, it looked like shrimp and egg goop. Not very appetizing. \n\nYang Chow Fried Rice: Good, not too salty and I thought it was prepared very well. Lots of meat and good amount of seasoning.\n\nLemon Chicken: It looked and tasted more like honey-lemon chicken. Sour initial taste then the sweetness kicks in. It's not too bad but I could only eat so much before the sugar got to me.\n\nIn addition to the Mandarin Dinner:\n\nClam in Black Bean Sauce: Very Good, this was probably my favorite out of all the things we ordered. Clams were cooked almost to perfection and the sauce was not too overpowering. Definitely recommended.\n\nSauteed Fresh Oyster with Ginger & Green Onions: This would have been delicious if I hadn't eaten 20 oysters this past weekend. It was overall pretty good, enough seasoning to compliment the oyster but not enough to overpower it. We did ask for some lemons to add a little bit of zest to it.

From 11AM-5PM, they have a special menu with 138 items where you select 3 items for $20 and it comes with the house soup and rice!  Additionally, happy hour is 2-5PM wth 32 items for a mere $2 each as well as 5 drinks (milk tea, lemon tea, ice red bean, honey tea). A bargain for good tasting food.\n\nThe next day, we went back for more but did take-out.  The beef, pepper, blk bean sauce ho fun was oily, the noodles were smothered in gravy.  Ick.  It tasted OK.

The inside is rather small and it fits the description of a nice clean small chinese restaurant.  Im sure the people who come here are locals and long time loyal customers.  Between the 6 of us, we ordered up a storm and only paid about $11 each.  \n-Taro Duck - plenty of taro, not so plenty duck....it was ok.\n\n-Pan Fried Noodles - really greasy but love the tasty msg flavor\n\n-Shrimp and egg over flat rice noodles - this dish has been my backup dish for all chinese restaurants, you can't go wrong with it, just like here.\n\n-Peking Pork Ribs - pretty good, nothing spectacular\n\n-Walnut Prawns - I dont' know if its because it got cold, but the shrimp was rather soggy and small.  \n\nI guess overall, don't expect too much, but you won't leave feeling dissaopinted.", "author": "Vincent K."}

One of the problems with Chinese restaurants is that, when a new owner takes over, they'll change the Chinese name but keep the same English name. The Eight Immortals of my youth (Jiu Baht Seen) is now Eight Immortals (Lai Yun).  Rumor has it that these are the folks who ran the Empress Garden restaurant on 9th Avenue in the Inner Sunset (the one that has stood empty for ages).\n\nWhat I've learned: Just because a Chinese restaurant is crowded with Chinese people doesn't necessarily mean the food served is good. It can also mean that the food is cheap. Peking Spareribs, Beef Skewers on a hot plate, Eight Ingredients clay pot, and steamed rice for two was $21.70 (incl. tax). Portions are huge, but you don't really want to take it home afterwards.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

The other half is coated with a thick sauce as well (contains starch of course to get that texture), containing egg whites, peas, carrots, and shrimp.

The reputation that this establishment earned  is no longer valid as they have clearly changed their philosophy.  We ordered the $55 set dinner and added an additional dish for a total of 6 adults - and we left hungry.  The additional dish of Honey Walnut Prawns was acceptable - but there were literally a dozen shrimp.  Which wouldn't be bad if it were larger than a silver dollar.  Literally, these shrimps were sized 26-30.  (Shrimp is catergorized by size - so 16-20 would mean in one pound of shrimp - you'd fine 16-20 shrimp)  \nYes folks, we were charge $12+ dollars for less than a 1/2 lbs of shrimp and a bunch of candied walnuts. \n\nSadly, the shrimp set the tone for the rest of the meal.  The lobster was easily under a pound.  The lobsters were the same size as the ones they serve at the Moonstar and Hokkaido buffets for an extra $2 bucks.  The ones filled with cheese.\n\nThe salt and pepper shrimp were the same size as the honey walnut ones - so I guess if you put both orders together, we'd get a pound of shrimp total. \n\nThe quail was on the cheap side as well, a mere single whole quail cut in 1/6s.  The golden fried chicken was 1/2 a chicken and the fried flounder was also on the smallish size. \n\nThe steamed oysters with black bean sauce was ok - but someone ate 3 of the 8 and wound up having really bad stomach cramps. \n\nThe best dish was the gai choy with garlic was spectacular - it's probably the final connection to the previous greatness this restaurant once had.  I don't believe that I will ever choose to come back, which is unfortunate considering the service was adequate, and the decor reminded me of my younger years.   \n\nNo need to fight the lines to try to eat here.

They used to be very good (both price wise & food quality wise), and even though it's run down we keep going back cos we love it.  A year or two ago, they switched owner. I have been there twice since. Waiters there are very helpful and friendly. But food is not like before. Still acceptable given the price, but not a place I would visit if not because of my curiosity that pops once a while wanting to know how that restaurant is like now, and always a hope that perhaps it will be just like before. \n\nBEWARE IF YOU ARE ORDERING SEAFOOD CHARGED BY WEIGH\n\nOne thing I really dislike about this place (and the reason for the 2 star instead of 3) is their dishonest business practice. And we may just never return again just because of this.  We had ordered steamed fish in both visit, and each time they would way over quote the weigh of the seafood (fish & lobster pricing is by weight). Their $ per pound pricing is lower than some restaurants, but they decide to cheat on the weigh instead to make even. The fish we got is max 1.25 pounds. We were quoted 1.7 lbs. Even worse in my last visit. We got something 1 pound max, and got quoted 1.7 lbs. Same with lobster. First time when that happened, I decided to let it go (thought perhaps it was a mistake?). Today I decide to talk to the owner, and as expected got some lame excuse (she tried to blame it on the waiters & insist the fish is right size...come on...she should know better than me) Frankly I want them to earn $, but I think customers would feel better if you charge a market $/pound rate and be honest about the actual weight.  I know it is not unusual for restaurants to quote ~a bit~ higher weigh (and I accept the fact), but please don't over do it thinking your customers are dumb.", "author": "BonBon H."}

Me and and the woman got the cantonese lunch special, and had some excellent won-ton soup, coupled with some fried egg rolls, stir fry rice, some sweet and sour pork, topped off with some stir fry beef with greens. \n\nFried rice is possibly the best I've had in recent memory. Very light yet tasty. Doesn't taste oily, or super fried like most stir fry rice I've had in the past. It's seasoned lightly, and seems really light. The other dishes were excellent as well. The won-ton soup was very tasty and good as well.\n\nMy advice is to avoid the usual dining times, such as early morning during the weekends, and early dinner times, such as 5 till 7pm on any other day. Avoid the crowds, and you'll be pleasantly surprised as I was. Cheap too.", "author": "Clinton L."}

For their tea items, the $2 items include wonton noodles, beef stew noodles, macroni soup, spiced salt chicken wings (4 pc) and drinks like cold / hot lemon tea ($1). Its really tea items cos you'll probably need to order a few. My spiced chicken wings came out freshly fried. Its a chicken version of the spiced salt pork ribs. The wonton is nice too.

Only thing that prevented a 5-star is the smallish and always crowded place.\r\n\r\nAs others have written, main selling points of this place are: cheap, cheap and cheap. By cheap, I meant really cheap, I think they charge like $4 for a big bowl of hot and sour soup that is enough to share for 4. And their hot and sour soup is better than the one that costs arms and legs at \"The Mandarin\" Chinese restaurant by Ghirardelli Square. \r\n\r\nDownsides are: really crowded and in a typical Chinese joint, of course, \"no service\". Then again at $4-6/dish, do you really expect any service?\r\n\r\nWith that said, if non-Asians (or non-Chinese) want to really taste \"Chinese Food\", this is THE place to go. It's not that their food taste crap because it's so cheap, it's excellent. \r\n\r\nSome items I'd recommend are: sizzling beef on hotplate, crabs (any style) and definitely the walnut shrimp. Another plus point is that it's a couple door next to Marcopolo gelato place, a good place to drop by after the meal.", "author": "Ferian J."}

I'm pretty picky about Chinese food, and frankly, sometimes I just don't like it that much. However, a reliable friend highly recommended this place, so off we went.\n\nI was not disappointed! There were only 3 of us, so we couldn't order that many dishes, but everything was good. We had the pea sprouts, fried tofu, and fried catfish, and everything was delicious. I was most impressed with how whatever they used to batter their fried foods was light, fluffy, and not at all oily! The fried tofu was probably my favorite dish of the three, with the outside being perfectly crispy, but the tofu soft and silky. The food here is pleasantly and surprisingly not greasy for being a kind of a divey-looking Chinese restaurant. The bill ran us $42 for those 3 dishes, which sounds a little high, but it was a huge fish and we probably had more than half left at the end of our dinner.\n\nNot the BEST Chinese food I've ever had, but definitely better than most.", "author": "danae c."}

I heard the service was bad but really I came for the food but was the service really that bad? YES, the chinese waitress commands, 'SIT HERE' and even if we barely had room they could have cared less and rolled their eyes.  They insist that although the half the restaurant wasn't full at 4pm for dinnertime, the bigger more roomier tables were reserved.  We ended up having all our plates and bowls side by side and eating elbow to elbow with some dinner plates utensils falling to the ground.  I'm not exaggerating their tables are really dinky and the place looks like a hole in the wall.  I don't think its that clean either.\n\nSo to the food, we ordered a grilled scallop dish and get this. They brought out a dish full of onions and had 3 broken up pieces of scallop which they charged about $8 for. The waitress decides not to send back the food, although thats what our request was. Its high way robbery to call that scallop dish, should've called it onion dish. We had to make a scene where other tables and the boss came out to see what the complaint was before they sent the food back to the kitchen.\n\nPrawn and walnuts dish was decent but the price was outrageous $10 for only 6 pieces of small shrimps. What a rip.\n\nCabbage stuffed minced meat that greasy oil and bland flavoring. Price was $7 but so not worth a penny.\n\nAnd last dish was a beef claypot that had greasy oil.\n\nI'm a big fan of taking leftovers home, but this time I decided not to because those leftovers were not even decent for homeless people.", "author": "Peachie Y."}

I must have gone there 10x, but most of the time it was a group thing with lots of people.  On a few occasions, it was just me and someone else.  Seriously the worst when it is just two people. You are treated like they don't want you in there.\n\nOnce, me and my girlfriend went for lunch.  We waited for someone to come over to seat us for 15 minutes.  No one came over to even say hi or please wait, or have a seat or anything.  We left after that.  Two months later, we went again to try again.  Again we waited, but 10 minutes this time.  We got out menus and decided on what we want.  No one wanted to take out order.  We waited a good 30 minutes.  Waving someone down just did not work.  I joked with my girlfriend about how they are ignoring us.  Again we walked out.  We went to Szechuan Taste again.  Cheaper and better tasting.  I don't know why I even bothered.  And, it is like I never learn or something, I went again with my girlfriend.  It was like redemption or something.  This time we were seated in a timely matter and they took our order after flagging them down from across the restaurant (embarrassing).  I ordered something I forget what and a soup or something that had some fish balls or something.  It tasted like leftovers from last night.  It was not hot, it did not have much flavor.  It was just blah.

First was the wait time, not too bad only a couple minutes, but the place was full. Then the wait for a waiter to take our order, 15 minutes, then for the foood 38 minutes, and one dish at a time, so we never all ate everything together. From the menu I wanted the individual meal for me, yet the waiter said it was too busy to do this meal for one person, so I just settled on fried rice, still 38 minutes to get an order of fried rice. Then we are finished eating and waiting for dessert, 20 minutes not even a waiter came by to ask us anything. When my wife finally saw a waiter and asked about the dessert he said ok, still nothing came. Then asked another waiter and she boldly said no sweet soup today, which was a lie since the people at another table just finished eating theirs.
