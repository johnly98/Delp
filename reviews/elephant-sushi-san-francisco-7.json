Our food came out after other people who ordered the same food as well as AFTER us. Not only that, but they failed to recognize one of the dishes we had ordered and simply left us waiting and didn't ask us how our experience and meal was until we flagged the waitress down (which should be easy to do given the small size, but bad service means they didn't recognize us.) The waitress still tried to pile the order on us and make us wait on it, so I had to explicitly mention I didn't want it.\n\nGood to decent food, but not worth the terrible service and generally long wait.", "author": "Francis V."}

THIS WILL BE THE NIGHT.\n\nWe popped over around 8:30 pm, saw a couple waiting outside, the slender sushi bar packed (so much so the waitress took our names outside). We were quoted 30 mins, so we went across the street to grab a cocktail. By the time we ordered a drink, my phone started buzzing, so we pounded our drinks and went back. I guess we didn't have to chug, since the waitress said she'd hold our seats, but we wanted sushi ASAP!\n\nWe took the recommendations of our waitress and literally everything was fantastic. I've got some pictures here but doesn't do it justice. Suzuki carpaccio I think, himalayan trout, ya man roll, toro nigiri. I may swap out the toro next time (!) for something creative and more Elephant-y. I assume they've refined their menu to show-stoppers only, so I'd probably love anything I ordered. Some sake and beer.

Huge flavor, few reasons not to go. \n\nElephant is easily one of my favorite sushi spots in SF. This town has some great sushi, but it's mostly prohibitively expensive. Elephant hits that sweet spot between quality and value. \n\nThe fish here is no joke. The cuts are generous, the quality is high, and the flavor treatments are dynamic. O-toro with caviar on top? Yeah. Seared butterfish? More please. Himalayan-salt-cured salmon? For sure. Scallops with yuzu? I do. I really do. The $40 omakaze plate has 16 slices of fish, and they're not small portions. The numerous $20 sashimi options have 5 solid slices of fish. Double the normal cut size of many alternative spots in town. And the offerings are very interesting flavor combinations. Oh, and the ginger seems to be pickled in-house. It's absurdly good.\n\nThe space is tiny - maybe like 12 seats total? So you'll likely be waiting unless you luck out and come at just the right time. It's all sushi bar, and all sushi. No izakaya food. The sake menu is very limited, and they have some beer. It's really all about the fish here, and the fish is very good. \n\nDrop in with your friend or small (very small) group, drop your name on the list, and go grab a drink somewhere.

The restaurant is extremely small with only about 20 or less seats around the bar. \n\nWe ordered the Hon Maguro, sake, ocean trout, scallop nigiris and the white out roll. Here's why it's two stars, they put sauce on everything and all things making it extra salty, but the fish quality is still A-okay/meh. \n\nHon Maguro - came with sauce mixed with but the sauce is just drenched with oil. I mean a shit ton on it which I really didn't expect and yes it did say sesame oil and olive oil but all I taste is the oil. The sauce should be there to enhance the flavor not to cover the flavor of the fish. \n\nNigiris - the nigiri already came with soy sauce or similar sauce and yet again drowned in the sauce. Every piece of the rice is just.... drenched and salty. Cannot TASTE ANY FISH BUT THE SAUCE. Then comes to scallop nigiri with NO sauce but wasabi inside, but I can tell the scallop was a-okay quality. \n\nWhite out - A okay but dry no sauce/flavor, not even wasabi was given on the plate so we asked them for some. Fish quality meeeeh, did not taste the butter fish when it already got torched.\n\nHomemade Ginger - I give them props for doing their homemade ginger, but I feel like it's not pickled enough to pair with the dishes.

I pop into a bar next door, order a drink, and immediately received a call that my seat was ready.\n\n2. I ordered the white out roll, Alaskan trout and beastie boys.

There was only one other group in line so we got a seat at the bar, no problem.\n\nThe White Out was the first roll we got and was a great opener. Everything was super fresh and the torched fish on top gave it a lovely smoky note. The Ya Man was definitely our favorite - the fried onions gave it a satisfying crunch and the olive oil in the pesto paired surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients. I thought the Red & Yellow was a bit overly sweet with both the mango and the soy glaze, but my partner liked it a lot.\n\nWe also got the Hotate and Hamachi nigiri. Both pieces were quite generous in size, but the Hotate was definitely more memorable because of the sweet and delicate scallop.\n\nAll in all we left full but not stuffed.

This is a highly recommended item!\n\nI also got the ya man roll which had salmon on top and fried onions and avocado inside. I'm allergic to avocado so I was able to sub it with cucumbers. The salmon was a bit thin and the fried onions really took over in flavor. Maybe the avocado would have balanced the flavor out better. Not a bad roll though, still good. \n\nWhen my friends and I picked this place to eat, we didn't realize it was a bar seating style with limited seats so we had to wait a bit.

Elephant Sushi is a small counter seating only (I think, but I could be wrong) restaurant in the hood (Tenderloin). At around 6 pm the first seating was already full and there were a couple of people on the list for the second seating which was to start after about 45-50 minutes. We put our names down, provided a number to be contacted on and dutifully made our way to the RxBar next door to down a couple of beers. \n\nWe were seated at the end of the bar that is used to go behind counter, one of the worst places to be seated at the bar. The setup of the restaurant is that even though you are seated at the bar there is no interaction with the sushi chef. You give your order to the server who relays it to the chef and then delivers it to you. You might as well be sitting comfortably at a table rather than on a half stool in front of the bar.\n\nAnyway as soon as you are seated they start you off with a free Walu Carpaccio ($16) which is butterfish topped with garlic, ponzu and truffle oil. This was so good that we ordered another round of the same later that night. After the first round it is honestly a blur. We ordered multiple rounds of sushi, rolls and sashimi all washed down with Kirin ($8), till we were stuffed. My take is that the fish was good but it was a little over-sauced for my liking. The rolls could have been made a little better as they seemed to fall apart but the rice used was of excellent quality. Service could have been a little more attentive, but it was not bad. Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nDamage seemed to be close to $$$ per person with tip, but we did order a lot of the good stuff. Price seems to be slightly higher when compared with other $$ sushi places in downtown.

So yeah, get the Ya Man roll and Yummy Pocket. The Ya Man roll ($13) had super fresh salmon and the olive oil drizzle on top was a nice touch. The Yummy Pocket ($6) was so good I wanted to get 2 orders! At a price point of $6, it's cheaper than a lot of the maki rolls on the menu, and might I add MUCH BETTER. The sweetness of the tofu skin really complimented the spicy scallop. It was so addicting I could probably come here and order 2 of these (4 tofus hehe) and be happy. \n\nI wasn't completely full after the 2 items, so I opted for a negi hama (yellowtail scallion roll) as well. At $7, it was more expensive than the Yummy Pocket but maybe only half as good, if that. So I suggest stick with their specialty rolls and appetizers!\n\nNext time I'm back, I'll def get the Yummy Pocket (duh) and probably something with uni (since I asked the guy next to me if he thought it was fresh and he said yah).", "author": "Sally L."}

Been coming here since they opened and totally obsessed with this place. I tell everyone to come here. It's the perfect mix of AMAZING sushi in a fun trendy atmosphere. This place is perfect for date night or a small birthday dinner (they do not take parties larger than 4 and I've seen them turn many away!)\n\nThe pro tip is to get in line before they even open or else you're looking at an hour long wait. They have lines even on weekdays before they open. They've started taking reservations for the first seating so you can call for that as well. \n\nEverything here is amazing and they have the cheapest cocktails god knows why!! This is the only fancy sushi restaurant I've seen with $5 cocktails and they used to have $2 sake bombs like wtf they could charge $15 for a drink and no one would bat an eye. \n\nStaff here are all great. They look like they're having so much fun working together!!! I even had one waiter stop me while ordering and say I was ordering too much! Love it!!!!!! Everything here is delicious and the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-26", "description": "I like elephants, and I like sushi. And when one of SF's most popular sushi bars is called Elephant Sushi, of course it becomes my favorite. (Side note: If you are looking for more restaurants ft. elephants, The Pink Elephant has bottomless mimosa brunches)\n\nElephant Sushi is probably among the closest you can get the intersection of amazing fish and fusiony sushi rolls. Yes, there are some places with good quality rolls, but the fish at Elephant Sushi is upscale-sushi-bar grade, and there's more thought put into their rolls than your standard rainbow/caterpillar/dragon. \n\nWe started off with a complimentary appetizer of butterfish with ponzu, a simple yet decadent combination of textures and flavors. \n\nOur favorite was the popular YA MAN ROLL ($13), and you can (should) describe it as sublime without sounding like an exaggerating food critic wannabe. The buttery king salmon and avocado synergize to a heavenly indulgence, and the fried red onion adds a satisfying crunchiness. The pesto and ponzu sauces blend in an intriguing contrast to finish. \n\nAfterwards arrive the BEASTIE BOYS ($12), another hyped item on Yelp. Remotely akin to pate, definitely requires a sophisticated palate and an acquired taste for sea urchin and monkfish liver blended with raw egg and made earthy with the nori wrap and shiso. The fancy nigiri creation is larger-than-bite-sized, but the composition with the runny yolk and oblique piece of akimo would be otherwise difficult to eat.... so my advice to my friend was \"Put the whole thing in your mouth, and if it falls apart then just try to suck up the yolk so it will be less messy.\" I suggest asking the server for more useful insight on how to eat this.\n\nThe DOUBLE ALBACORE ($16) was another delicious roll with a lot of dimension. The subtle nuances of the albacore were enhanced by the boldly contrasting sauces of honey mustard, toasted sesame aioli, and sweet teriyaki. And avocado is always a good idea, though I wonder if one day SF will make us pay extra to add avocado to sushi rolls.\n\nI liked how the wasabi is strong with the proper amount of masochistically satisfying nasal spiciness. You can help yourself to as much ginger as you like since it comes in a large mason jar, though I wasn't a fan of their acidic version. The novel taste is interesting at first, but I couldn't get used to my ginger tasting like it's been soaked in vinegary kombucha. \n\nAs several reviewers have mentioned, this location is small and consists only of bar seating. The wait can get long, so I recommend getting here a few minutes before opening. There's also an awkward seat on the far left; I was right up against the wall on the side, and there was a pipe inches from my back. Essentially I could hardly move, and I don't consider myself a big person. \n\nI think that one seat is the only negative thing I have to say. Prices are extremely reasonable--it totaled to less than $20 per person, and this is a city where appetizers (\"small plates\") can cost $20. The dining experience at Elephant Sushi was memorable, and we savored the intersection of fresh fish and creative, expertly prepared rolls.", "author": "Edna C."}

Thank you, Elephant Sushi, for putting up with a few slightly buzzed (and likely mildly obnoxious) ladies storming in for a late dinner on a Thursday night! We had called earlier that night for availability for a party of 7, and they were fully booked at that time since there are only 12 seats available. However, since we left happy hour later than expected, they called us to let us know they could seat our party, and we came in around 8:45pm. Elephant Sushi has a good variety of fusion sushi rolls to choose from, and we tried:\n\n-Himalayan Trout (New Zealand Ocean Trout, Green Onion, Spanish Chili, Garlic Ponzu, House Basil Oil, $16, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=l6FcGOVCOhlvRxCRS8Cckw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum! The trout was super fatty and delicious, and I loved the combination of ingredients- highly recommended!\n-Hon Maguro (Sea Salted Ahi Tuna Sashimi, w/Capers, Olive Oil, Sesame Oil, Tangy Vinaigrette, Ripe Mango, $25) & Spicy Hamachi (Avocado, Jalape\u00f1o, Lime, Cucumber, Scallion, Masago, Toasted Shichimi Pepper Aioli, $15)[https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IR_jrGdU6ROYa-ORrtqRcg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: Both were very fresh, but just ok for me. I didn't like the shichimi pepper on top of the spicy hamachi roll, and wouldn't order either dish again.\n-Spicy Tuna (Red Tuna Mixed in Spicy Sauce, w/Cucumber, $8, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=g0LuYc93SVtvxC8t1qfh2w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok- the spicy tuna was too mushy, and I've had better versions. Skip!\n-Ya Man (King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto & Ponzu Sauce, $13): Yum- the combination of ingredients worked well together, and the fried red onion chips gave it an interesting texture. Recommended!\n-Beastie Boys (Sea Urchin, Ankimo, Quail Egg, Shiso, $16): Super luxurious, and an ambitious one-biter. The combination of uni and ankimo was delicious- recommended!\n-Double Albacore (White Tuna Inside & Out, Avocado, Honey Mustard, Toasted Sesame Oil, Sweet Teriyaki Sauce, $16): I loved the albacore in this roll, but I'm still unsure about the honey mustard in this. I probably wouldn't order this again, but it's worth trying once.\n\nAlthough it was interesting trying some of the new combinations in the sushi rolls, I'm not sure how often I'd want to eat these flavor profiles again. For SF, the prices are about average, but a bit pricier for the portions compared to the Peninsula and South Bay. They also make the pickled ginger in house- I liked the flavor, but a lot of the slices in my jar had a lot of fibers, and it was tough to eat. Service was quick, and our food came out pretty quickly. Parking in this area can be tough, but there are street parking spots (especially a few minutes before 6pm/at 6 pm since a couple blocks have prohibited parking until then).", "author": "Amy D."}

The fish was so rich and melt-in-your-mouth fatty. Rubbing the slices on the slab of Himalayan salt made them even better! Definitely a must-get item!\n\nYa man roll was pretty good, nice touch with the crispy onions.\n\nDouble albacore roll was disappointing. The fish was too soft like they weren't fresh.

Very cool!\n\nWe got the spicy trio sashimi bowl, which was probably the best thing we got. Great value for $18, a ton of fresh, high quality fish. I find it more similar to poke than chirashi, with awesome flavors, and great texture from the seaweed (real seaweed, not the dried kind!). We also go the spicy tuna roll and the Ya Man roll. The spicy tuna wasn't anything out of the ordinary (just very, very spicy!). The Ya man roll was pretty good, with some crunchy thing in the middle that I didn't think added much to the overall experience of eating it, but the salmon ontop was buttery and delicious.", "author": "Ke C."}

I can't say it's as good as it used to be (taste wise about the same but missing some options I used to love and price has gone up) but it's still a solid bet if you want \"fancy\" sushi. The thing with Elephant Sushi is that the actual fish quality isn't all that great. The texture is too soft and there's still some taste but it's fading fast. What they are good for is their spins to the fish. They definitely add in some less-traditional ingredients but it's delicious so I can't complain. If you plan on coming here make sure you have some time because the lines can get really long. The seating is very limited (basically one long cramped sushi bar).\n\nFor my visit I got the #3 and split a Ya Man roll w/ my friend. The #3 has been my go to for a very long time because I love the capers w/ the acidity and it honestly covers up the subpar quality of the albacore quite well. I do feel like they went a bit overboard with the capers this time because the dish was a bit too salty. The walu was a bit more disappointing. The fish itself lacked flavor and the garlic pieces weren't quite enough. Rice was average and nothing special. (3.5/5)\n\nThe Ya Man roll seems to have everyone raving and while I can't say it's the best roll ever I did enjoy it. It's a pretty roll and none of the ingredients stand out too much but as a whole bite it's quite tasty. There are other options I would like to try but if you definitely want to get a roll this is a safe bet (4/5)\n\nMy friend got the #2 and enjoyed it but said her rice was soggy. I didn't try it so nothing else I can note.\n\nOverall, my experience here didn't quite live up to my original memories of Elephant Sushi but the price still isn't awful, their flavors are good, and I'd probably still return (if there's no wait).", "author": "Vivian C."}

Unlike other sushi restaurants, the small spaces allows you to enjoy your sushi in an intimate setting.  It's a small restaurant with limited bar seating, so be prepared to wait if you are visiting during prime dinner hours.  My friend and I went on a weekend evening, and it took about a 20-30 minutes to seat 2 people.  There is a bar nearby if you need a place to wait out, and they will call you once your seats are available.\n\nOverall, I think the fish was excellent; from the Hamachi Truffle to the nigiri/sushi, I though all the fish I sampled had a fresh and buttery quality that I enjoyed.  They offered a sample of the Hamachi Truffle, and if you like truffle flavors, you will really like this dish.  While I'm not a truffle fanatic, I appreciated how the seared yellowtail combined with the oil, ponzu, garlic, and scallion bits.  The maguro nigiri was sizable; they do not skimp on the fish here! \n\nHowever, the size of their items turned out to be a downside when it came to their sushi.  It's true what they say: size does matter, and I felt like the huge sushi cuts were harkening a bit too closely to the elephant referenced in the restaurant's name.  I tried the Ya Man roll, and while I thought the salmon, avocado, and other assorted ingredients practically melted in my mouth, the sections were falling apart and seemed ginormous.  If I go again, I think I will stick to the other items, since my friend really enjoyed her rice bowl and the appetizers looked interesting.", "author": "Keith H."}

We got seated at the small bar (the only available seating at this maybe 15 person restaurant). They offered a taste of the walu carpaccio, which the bf and I both enjoyed. It really did taste like ribeye! Super weird! The bf is a fish...hater but he said he'd eat fish every day if it tasted like this.\n\nI got the Ya Man (I just realized it's supposed to be like \"yeah, man!\"...I forget people spell \"yeah\" that way. It was okay...the fish was very fresh and they definitely had added some sort of salt to it (which I really like). Wouldn't call it buttery but definitely melts in your mouth. The red onion chips didn't really taste like onion chips-- more like stale-ish crispy things in your sushi. The pesto sauce was more like basil-flavored olive oil, didn't even notice it until I asked. Not bad, but not amazing.\n\nThe bf got a spicy tuna roll: standard, but you could tell the fish was very fresh. Their spicy tuna is cut up and mixed, but not into the mush / goo that other spicy tuna rolls are. You can still tell it's fish.\n\nTried out our friends' rainbow roll and spicy hamachi roll.

Not sure if the tuna was unfresh that day but everything that we had that had tuna tasted a bit off.\n\nThe hamachi truffle was okay but the truffle sauce was overpowering. If you think you can't get overpowered by truffle oil, come try a bite of this.\n\nThe blue fine bites, once again with that tuna tasted unfresh so we sent it back.\n\nThe chip and dips with the tuna and garlic chips were the worst. It was like a Costco tuna sample with pita garlic chips, no thanks. We ended up not even eating this dish.\n\nThe ankimo and quail egg were the best thing at this place that we tried, along with the sea bass sashimi.\n\nThe service is slow, and there's usually a line out the door since they have limited seating.\n\nFor the wait, the price, and the quality and taste of the food we had for around $150, I'd say 3 stars.", "author": "Jack R."}

The name \"Elephant Sushi\" didn't exactly scream out AMAZING SUSHI to me.  But after my dinner there, I am now echo-ing the sentiments of my friends.  Elephant Sushi is pretty amazing!  We came near the end of the night and were the last seating.  It was about a 25 minutes wait and we just went next door to Rx for a drink (I highly recommend getting a drink at Rx regardless if you have a wait or not).\n\nElephant Sushi has just one row of seating, which I noticed is very SF.  So expect a wait time, which is ALSO very SF.  I wish I can find another word to describe my experience here.  But like many of my other SF reviews, Elephant Sushi is also FRESH TO DEATH.  The restaurant is very trendy and intimate (may be due to the lack of space).  My friend loves their Mussels Shooters here, but they were not on the menu unfortunately.  Restaurants running out of their most popular dishes is a central theme to eating in SF.  I guess that just forces me to come back next time.\n\nRecommended:\n1. Monk Fish Liver:  Sashimi style; the pieces are so generous.\n2. HIMALAYAN OCEAN TROUT:  I can eat this every day.  The moment it was served on the pink rock salt plate, I was in love.  The salt plate gave it just enough kick so you don't need soy sauce.  The ocean trout is so fresh and so orange, I love it, love it!\n3. Hamachi Truffle:  Truffle anything is good\n4.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-02", "description": "I recently read an empowering article from a woman who decided that she was going to date herself. On Saturday nights, she would treat herself to a nice dinner at one of the hottest new restaurant in the city. The benefits of dining alone: you don't have to depend on anyone, you can pick whatever restaurant you want to go to, and order whatever the phuck you want. \n\nSounds great to me except I have an irrational fear of dining alone. Remember that depressing [dinner alone] scene from \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\": http://youtu.be/sBcWR_fArKM? Welp, I would need to romance the bottle before attempting that. \n\nAfter some reassurance from friends that I wouldn't look like a loser (yes, I know this is ridiculous but my middle name is self-conscious) and googling random articles about eating alone, I worked up enough courage and decided I was going to hit up Elephant Sushi's newest location in TL...alone for lunch. \n\nHowever, the day of, my friend asked what I was doing. I told him where I was going and he said, he wanted to join so we can catch up. \n\nI am SO glad that he came. Not because it saved me from dining alone but because I was able to sample a lot more things than I would have alone. \n\nI've never been to the original and wildly popular Elephant Sushi location in Russian Hill (http://www.yelp.com/biz/elephant-sushi-san-francisco)--I wrongly assumed it was sushi for yuppies. Their newest location (soft opened 12/1/15) in TL has a combo of both menus from their other locations. On the menu you will find fusiony apps and sashimi dishes, sashimi salad, sashimi bowls, sashimi, nigiri, and rolls. Online reports said there's omakase; there's only omakase for sashimi (16 pc - $40). Beer, wine, and sake only. There's only 12 seats and there's no reservations. I highly recommend coming alone or with one other person only. If you don't want to wait hours for dinner (we were told there was a 3 hour wait last night), come during lunch. \n\nI'm not a fan of fusiony Japanese sushi or rolls but Elephant Sushi is legit for Americanized Japanese sushi. They use high quality ingredients unlike your run-of-the-mill Japanese restaurants in SF. The only drawback is they don't have a large selection of fish because they serve only wild or sustainable seafood. They also pickle their own ginger, make their own low sodium soy, and use real wasabi root!\n\nMy friend and I ordered the following (everything was solid but below is a list from our favorite to least favorite items): \n*Beastie Boys: Ankimo, uni, quail egg nigiri (2 pc - $12): http://bit.ly/1SzCSlv\n*Ya Man Roll: King salmon, avocado, scallion, fried red onion chips, pesto, ponzu ($13): http://bit.ly/1QhvY5e\n*Himalayan Trout: New Zealand ocean trout, green onion, Spanish chili, garlic ponzu, house basil oil ($16): http://bit.ly/1lbwHtr\n*Vodka Marinated Ankimo Nigiri (2 pc - $7): http://bit.ly/1lbx9rR\n*Basil Sake Nigiri (2 pc - $8): http://bit.ly/1lZAR7O\n*Hamachi Nigiri (2 pc - $7): http://bit.ly/1YKSLcx\n*Maguro Nigiri (2 pc - $8): http://bit.ly/1N5DMTh\n*Hamachi Truffle: Seared yellowtail, truffle oil, fried garlic chips, ponzu, scallion ($20): http://bit.ly/1SzD2cF\n\nWe went a little crazy with the fatty omega-3 fishes (salmon and ocean trout) but damn were they super fresh and buttery. \n\nThe Beastie Boys is a must order--a menage a trois of decadently creamy ankimo, sweetly briny uni, and silky yolk. \n\nAs much as I like authentic sushi, I get roll cravings from time to time and the Ya Man thoroughly satisfied it. Great combo of textures from the buttery salmon, avocado and onion chips. I like that Tamir (owner/sushi chef) doesn't use too much rice and doesn't skimp on the neta topping; it covers the entire roll. \n\nThe Himalayan trout was beautifully presented and the silky pieces of sashimi were like a umami fish butter; great with sake.\n\nThe nigiris were all solid but the ankimo was my favorite. Like foie gras of the sea, the housemade ankimo that was marinated with vodka had a sinfully rich texture. The shari was nicely seasoned and compact so you can finish in one bite.\n\nI love truffle but it overpowered the hamachi so I would skip the Hamachi Truffle next time. \n\nOh yah, I couldn't get enough of their house pickled ginger as a palate cleanser: http://bit.ly/1IrwexA. I almost finished half of a jar myself. =/\n\nElephant Sushi is family owned and they take pride in ensuring that they don't serve mediocre sushi which is why all their locations are tiny (one sushi chef only). Tamir and his wife (who runs the front of the house) were very hospitable, engaging, and attentive. \n\nMinimalist ambiance with just a sushi counter so I can't stress enough to don't come with more than another person. There's no space inside to wait. \n\nParking is much easier than their original location especially during lunch. \n\nI'm a omakase whore so I hope Elephant Sushi considers adding omakase nigiri in the future.

The place is perfect for that nice, intimate night out with your significant other. Reason being because they are a super small restaurant with only a handful of seats available at their sushi bar. \nI give them 3-Stars because the hype is a little too much. I admit, they have some really great flavor combos, the trout sashimi on the salt board was amazing, but the pricing can be a bit lower than what it's priced at. Other than that dish, the rest was okay. They have great presentation with their dishes, and truly have some unique dishes. But honestly, don't go in their hungry because you will leave and want to order a slice of pizza from across the street. On any note! \nI definitely will go back though (when I get a bonus check) because there are a few dishes I really wanted to try, but damn you have to be either rich or saving up for that night to get what you want plus more. My girl did a great job making the selections on the menu, so overall I left happy knowing we got to try some of the things we went for. \nBut if you know me, you know my ratings are highly based upon service, and let me just say this again, it's no more than 15 people in that restaurant so there is no excuse to missing orders or being slow to get to people, either with their food or their orders. The server that night was probably just off her game, but no excuses when you are paying that kind of money to eat out at a heavily hyped spot. One being that the people behind the counter are helping out with serving, just like any other sushi bar setting. Two, when you call out for the server and they respond that they'll be right there, I expect them to come right after they do what they were doing prior to your call out. But no, she failed to tend to our calls all night. We even waited for one of our dishes for half an hour. That's after we put in the order, and asked about it twice. AND IT WAS THE TROUT SASHIMI! \nBut like I said, I'll give them another shot.

We ordered:\nWhite Out Roll: After the first bite I was speechless. I honestly didn't have super high expectations for this place but I was shocked at how fresh and flavorful the fish was! (~$16?)\nSashimi bowl #2: Tuna, yellowtail and avocado! I added some wasabi and soy sauce for additional flavor but I think the rice comes flavored already. Very large portions with plenty of fresh fish and rice! ($18)\nSashimi bowl spicy trio: My friend ordered this but I tried a bite and thought it was really good except definitely pretty spicy!

At first my boyfriend and I were skeptical of a menu that featured all Japanese/Hawaiian fusion rolls. We were afraid it would stray too much from the classic sushi experience we love so much. But let me tell you- this place is on another level. \n\nWhen you go you MUST try the Ya Man roll. It's a hot roll with white fish that will blow your socks off. The flavors fill every corner of your mouth. The warmth is a pleasant and welcome surprise. Highly recommend. We ordered several other rolls and we're not disappointed by any of them. Amazing flavors all around.\n\nDown side? This place is tiny. It has 12 seats at a bar and is usually crazy busy during dinner hours especially on the weekends (like 1 hour + wait busy). However we've found that before 6pm is usually just a 30 min wait. Going between 7-8pm? Forget about it. We tried to go again last night at 7:15 and they couldn't even put us on the list for the night because the waitlist was so full. \n\nAnother pro tip: the Elephant Sushi on Hyde is nowhere near as good!!! Please be advised! Just decent restaurant sushi, nothing extraordinary. But the 12-seater on Geary is the REAL DEAL.", "author": "Tamara S."}

We arrived 20 mins before opening , and there was already a line formed. I found this very promising. The doors opened promptly at 6, and we were lucky to be in the top 15 to be seated. The small bar only seats about 10-15 ppl total at a time. Plus, the line continued to grow as we were ordering and eating.  I'm guessing bc they are fairly new, we got a complimentary appetizer- the butterfish with ponzu. It was my first time trying butterfish raw, and I loved it. That prompted us to order a few extra butterfish items- so good job elephant sushi  for sucking us in!! The three of us shared 6 items, and each was as delicious as the last.

Clean lines, exposed wood and pipe, and mostly standard sushi options dressed up with foodie accoutrements like truffle oil and runny eggs.\n\nAnd yet it all worked. The $14 sashimi bowls are a better deal than most comparable lunch options available in the city. The White Out roll in its ponzu'd glory jumped right to the top echelon of rolls I'll seek out in the city. And after seeing it choked full with a line of folks waiting for weeks, a strategic call 45 minutes in advance sufficed to get in the door with practically no wait--perhaps I have the Mensho Ramen people down the street to thank. Attentive service, an attractive setting, beautiful ingredients and presentation, and they don't even gouge folks for drinks. The total bill came to around $75 for two and we both ate more than our fill--better than can often be done at sushi joints in the neighborhood with a lot less to offer in the way of style and creativity. In one meal it went from a neighborhood curiosity to a roster entry I hope to frequent as long as I'm in the neighborhood. Good show.", "author": "James D."}

I have refused to go to the Hyde location because I dislike that they don't take reservations and the wait can take up to 2 hours on a first-come first serve basis. We eagerly came to the Geary location when we heard that they recently opened less than 2 months ago!\n\nThe nigiri and sashimi here are both excellent. Extremely high quality fish! They are a bar-only restaurant with 10-12 seats. They also do not take formal reservations - get here at 5:45-6PM when they open, put your name and phone # (write both very clearly) on the list, and they will call you with an ETA. We were the second on the list and they called me at 6:30PM promptly letting us know that our seats would be ready within 5 minutes.\n\nGot there right at 6:35 and got seated right away and were given a complimentary amuse bouche of their Walu - pretty nice gesture!\n\nSince Elephant Sushi is more fusion-y than other traditional sushi bars (Omakase, An, Kusakabe, Sushi Yoshizumi), the style reminds me a lot of Akiko's and Pabu's. They have authentic nigiri and sashimi but also have rolls and other creative dishes.\n\nWe decided to create our own Omakase between the two of us- we ordered:\nthe Sashimi Omakase for $40\n4-5 pairs of Nigiri ($6-8 a pair)\nthe Beastie Boys ($12 for a pair of Uni/Ankimo/Quail egg goodness!)\na roll ($12)\n2 Beers\n\nEverything was delicious and it was very obvious that Elephant Sushi catered to both the true sushi enthusiasts and Americanized-sushi fans alike. We really really enjoyed the nigiri, even though the shari was not as sturdy as traditional sushi bars. The flavors were optimal and the fish were cut with care.

I'm wary of new places--typically there are lots of kinks to work out--but I was feeling sassy and decided to stop in and roll the dice.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that it's small. But like, GET OVER IT. Know what? Applebee's and Chili's are plenty big, so if you want room to lay down while you eat, definitely keep on walking and head to the burbs. If you want some place with personality, and a chance to get right up there and personal with your staff and fellow diners, this is the spot. Seriously, it's not for everyone, so if you look in and see that it might be too small for you, don't grab a seat and don't have dinner.\n\nIt's just the sushi bar. It's not a place for a group. There aren't tables, let alone large tables. Belly on up and grab a menu. I ordered the Whiteout roll, which is hamachi, avocado, a few tricks inside, and topped with butterfish that's finished with a torch sear and garlic ponzu. I chased that down with a couple of pieces of walu nigiri. I mean, the fish selection was mostly soft, buttery fish. But that fish was definitely soft and buttery. The roll had a great mix of char (the burn, not the Arctic fish) and smooth flavor. And that walu, served with lemon juice, was soft and delicate and had the right taste and profile to make me so happy.\n\nOn the scale of authentic to cream cheese, this has found a nice little place in the middle. In fact, they're striking a balance that's kinda hard to achieve. This is not one of those secret places where the chef just gives you his vision of sushi and you eat it pure and clean. Yet it's also not one of those places that's a complete takeover of sushi, with rolls oozing sauces and all kinds of veggies and candy corns sticking out of them. No, it's a place where the fish still reigns supreme, but there are other creative flavors used to enhance them. Both my selections were a perfect example of that. Perhaps sometimes they miss the mark? It's bound to happen, but having a couple of other locations come before them helps me understand why, on their first week of business, they seemed to have it dialed in pretty well.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

While I was waiting, another two-top showed up and put themselves on the list behind me. The table ahead of me got called but didn't show up, at which point I expected to be seated. Instead, the two people that showed up after me were seated. At that point I politely informed the restaurant that they could remove my name from the waitlist. I was (and still am) very hungry, and this made for a very disappointing experience that made me feel like I am not at all valued as a customer. \n\nIf this restaurant is so busy that they don't care about people like me, then good for them. I wish my business was so good. However, if they do care about customers like me, they should really find a better way to manager their waitlist.", "author": "Mike R."}

I've been eyeing it since I made a couple visits to MenSho and debated the line between the two. \n\nThe place is teeny tiny. Like so tiny that if you're near the door, you could get brushed by them closing the door and so tiny that if you're sitting in the corner, you can use the restaurant's pipeline as a backrest. It holds like... 12 people? \n\nThey actually were nice enough to start us off with the walu carpacci on the house and I will say that it was mighty delicious, so it made me really excited for what was to come. \n\nI had read reviews about their sashimi bowls and was pretty disappointed that this location was only open for dinner, vs lunch at their other locations. So I had to try it here (off menu item - menu on the counter). I got the #1, which was spicy scallop, salmon, butterfish. It was delicious. The walu was marinated in truffle oil and it seeped into the rice in a good way. I thought all their fish was pretty fish. \n\nWe also ordered the yummy pocket, which was ok. I actually thought it was supposed to be fried for some reason, but it was not. The two rolls we got were really good too, the spicy hamachi (some pieces had more lemon than others though - inconsistent) and the ya man roll. \n\nI'd come back ... but I wish they were open for lunch, so I could come by on a slow day at the office.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

Items to order include the Ankimo nigiri, scallop and tuna roll, salmon roll, uni nigiri is oceany and rich. The prices aren't much higher than Sanraku but the food and value are much better.

Disclaimer, I have been to their other location as it's right next to my office. First of all, it was absolutely pouring rain outside, and upon entering the restaurant the waitress asked us to step outside of it and wait outside. We were made to wait outside for 5 min in the pouring rain. I never experienced this before. I get the restaurant was small but my bf and I are skinny and don't take up that much room. I felt embarrassed in front of my bf because we came here under my suggestion. Minus one star for that. Upon getting in, there was no room to store our coats. The sashimi bowls, the most cost effective option that I enjoyed at the other location, was completely arbitrarily $6 more!! The portion and quality was close to the same. The food itself tastes good, 4 stars, but I needed to deduct another star for the arbitrary price difference. :/", "author": "Crystal Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-16", "description": "The service was great! However, the sushi was just okay. I presume more people come here for the rolls though? I didn't order any. I usually order nigiri to get an idea of the quality of the fish. The complimentary sample of their walu carpaccio was tasty. I also liked the sake, ocean trout, hamachi and seabass nigiri. However, the hotate nigiri came out ice cold and was over salted. One huge issue I had was that there was too much rice in the nigiri!!! Please consider preparing your nigiri with just a little bit less rice so it doesn't overwhelm the fish. The place is small so I recommend showing up early, especially before 8:30pm.", "author": "Q C."}

Small place with only sushi counter seats which is the only place you should ever sit at when eating sushi.  In response to Nicole's review below:  buttery is the exact description you give to something that melts in your mouth and pesto is precisely basil with olive oil so I think her point reductions were entirely unjust.

About 12-14 seats total in the whole place. When we showed up we sat outside and decided it was too small and didn't want to take the chance of it not being great so we started calling other places around the city. We had no luck as everywhere else had an hour or more wait so at the last second we sat down to give it a shot. GREAT decision. \n\nBefore we knew it there was about 15 people standing outside waiting to get in for 45+ minutes. Service was amazing, friendly chefs that called us by name based on our reservation, food was INCREDIBLE. We ordered 10+ rolls between the 4 of us. Great prices. \n\nThis will be a spot I return to every time I'm in the city.", "author": "Richie S."}

The hamachi and maguro melted in my mouth, and had a sweet taste to it.  This is good stuff folks. The rolls were great too.  The customer service was excellent.  Really friendly servers and chefs.  Five stars all the way.  The place is small however. (Think Jiro Dreams of Sushi)  It might be nice to have somewhere to hang coats/jackets.  They don't take reservations, so if there's a wait, you might want to put your name down, then go to a nearby cafe and have them call you when your seats open up.  The restaurant is too small to wait inside of and it was in the 40s outside so we waited at the cafe Joy's Place a couple blocks away at 611 Post St, it's open until midnight.  After dinner we drove up to Coit Tower (Ten minute drive) and watched the lights on the Bay Bridge.  :)", "author": "Mike A."}

If you can get past this aspect, you will have a great sushi dinner. They keep a wait list, and will call you when your spot at the bar is available. The Blue Fin bites are great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-29", "description": "The TL area is getting some great influx of new restaurants recently and this is one of them. The first thing to note is that the restaurant is very small. They only have seats for 11 people, so I would recommend planning accordingly. The menu has a great assortment of small plates, rolls, and appetizers. I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered the mussel shooters. The dish came with 6 mussels on the plate and I think it came out to about ~$12. My friend ordered a few vegetarian rolls and reported that they were also very good. In total, we only spent about $30 which is pretty standard for any sushi restaurant. We however did not order the pricier rolls/dishes on the menu. I thought it was worth it considering the quality of the ingredients compared to other Japanese places nearby (ie. Sanraku and Ryokos). The quality of the ingredients here is something to be noted; everything tasted really clean and fresh. I also thought the setup of the restaurant, while small, felt authentic to a small sushi bar you might see if you visited Japan. All in all, a great experience.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

Been obsessing about The Beasties Boys for awhile now. Finally, I got my opportunity to go. I chose the Geary location because it was close to work. I walked in and boy is this place tiny! There's only a sushi bar with seating for 11 people. So, yeah it was little cramp. I ordered Beastie Boys, White Out Roll, Walu and Monkfish Liver Nigiri. So, the first thing that comes out is the Hamachi Nigiri. I told the waitress I didn't order this, but I will take it. It was delicious! The Walu and Monkfish was underwhelming. I won't be ordering those two again. The White Out Roll was super good. Excellent texture and flavor. I couldn't have chosen a better roll. Finally the BEASTIES BOYS. Ah yes...UNI. I get it now. Never really cared for uni in the past but damn the uni here was divine. And to add the quail egg on top and all the other good bits they put in it? Genius.  I could've eaten another order or two but I had to be an adult and show some self control. Service was quick. Food was delish. I knocked off a star because there was a basic nigiri I was craving that I couldn't get here. Tobiko and quail egg. I asked for it, but they couldn't provide.  Overall, I would go back and order the Beastie Boys and try other stuff off the menu. I'd even go back and order nothing but the Beastie Boys.", "author": "Aimey T."}
