Go the extra mile for an independent, large, airy place with lots of clean tables and plug ins for your wi-fi device. The coffees are made in a row one at a time and kick like San Francisco beans of yore. I recommend the $4.88 grilled cheese sandwich with delicious slightly-herbal crispy sourdough and perfectly melted ample cheese. The $4.75 garden bagel has just the right amount of high quality spread softened by a nicely toasted bagel of your choice with bite size vegetables stacked inside. Mouth watering food, strong coffee, industrious and respectful family staff and neighborhood regulars--it's my go to. Parking is best in the pretty neighborhood off Ashton.", "author": "Vince's S."}

They are indifferent at best, rude at worst. Greeting customers kindly with a smile is pretty standard service 101. I really hope they all leave at the end of the summer. \nWith Philz as new competition, the owner is going to have to hire or train better people.

This time the new owner just updated the facade and the interior a little so they could raise the price on everything. Both drinks we ordered were watered down and cold (hot chocolate & chai). They were out of whip cream, which well known, is every child's favorite part. It still smells like mold at the front counter and its condiment area is still super cluttered, ugly, and unorganized. Everything looks broken. There's a sound system with no music playing and a tv with nothing on it. The flooring is all warped and even the lighting doesn't match.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-02", "description": "Here's the review I wish I could leave:\n\n\"A mostly comfortable cafe with limited space but big windows, plenty of outlets, reliable wifi, and good coffee. The prices aren't great but not terrible, and the music is usually pretty good. A little out of the way for people without a car but you do what you can with the cost of SF real estate. Overall a good deal. Four stars.\"\n\nBut if there was ever a time to start saying I just can't even, this is the exact moment where I just...can't...even.\n\nFull disclosure, I came in with someone who already posted a review below. But I was there too, so I get a vote too, and in the end, the wages of sin is death.\n\nForget someone's latte? Fine. It happens. I've worked in food before--twice in the front of the house--and I get that things get busy and even when you're running as hard as you can sometimes not everyone will be completely satisfied. But when you mess up, the bare minimum that's required--and all that's required, if you're dealing with reasonable people--is to apologize and fix it as soon as you can.\n\nToo much to expect in this case, apparently. Instead of finding out why a customer was waiting, the barista calling herself Jenn J. chose to chat with her fellow staff members and ignore my friend, paying her no mind. Then upon learning of the issue, the same Jenn J. accosted this same customer in an icy tone. The words may have literally been, OK, we'll start that for you right now, but it came out as a sneer, and in a way that conveyed the request for a drink already bought and paid for 20 minutes ago was a major imposition.\n\nI don't know the reason for this hostility. I also don't know whether or not I was paying for someone else's supposed sins when Jenn J. later denied me entry to the restroom. To be sure, there was a piso mojado sign up, but that usually means watch out and be careful, not, the restroom is out of commission. Even if it was, the explanation was suspect because too long, and because of the gratuitous observation that I could use it in ten minutes, \"if you're still here.\" Maybe she didn't mean anything by it. But I finally decided, I don't care. I only have to ask these questions in the first place because of the completely unnecessary hostility she visited on both of us earlier--hostility that neither of us came looking for, and that neither of us reciprocated.\n\nAnd now I come to find that Jenn J. herself has responded to the first review describing this situation with an insulting and demeaning personal message. To the owners: Straight up, fire this person outright, or I will never patronize your business again. There are plenty of people--including both the customers whose morning she ruined that day--who take pride in their work and know to treat their customers with decency and respect. If that's not something you require of your staff, well, good luck with that.", "author": "James D."}

She is hostile, bad-tempered and unpredictable. In short, we asked her not to mop near our table while we were eating, and she became verbally abusive, berated us and ordered us out of the cafe. This woman is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nWe arrived 45 minutes before closing on Aug. 20 and asked a young employee at the counter if they were still serving, since the food was wrapped up, a section of the cafe was blocked off by chairs, and there was yellow tape across the bathroom entrance. She said they were open, so we ordered coffee and pastry and went to sit down at one of the available tables.\n\nMinutes later, the manager (Erica, with tattoos, wearing a backwards baseball cap) pulled out an industrial bucket and wet mop reeking of cleaning fluid and started slapping the mop around. We asked her to please hold off while we were eating, that the fumes were overwhelming (this is a completely reasonable customer request - not to mention the fact that it is bad practice to clean while a restaruant is still open!). She became instantly combative, said this was how she did things and we could leave if we didn't like it. We were stunned.\n\nWhen my husband commented on her rudeness and said he had just been in Japan where customers are treated like honored guests, she interrupted \"Good for you!\" He started to respond and she said, \"Shut up, old man!\" When he raised his voice in reply, she walked menacingly toward our table and threatened to call the police and have them throw us out of the caf\u00e9 (absurd - for asking that she not mop near us?!). She also said she was banning us from ever coming back.\n\nWe are longtime patrons, working professionals, and have lived in this area for 20 years. We like to support local businesses. But we've never had such an outrageous thing happen, in this neighborhood or any other. \n\nThis manager has no business interacting with the public. She poses a danger to others and is a liability for the business. Her hostile, angry outburst was a fireable offense. It's a shame the owner seems not to care (he ignored a letter we sent to him).\n\nOurs is not an isolated incident - many other customers have been mistreated in recent months (see other posts).

The menu (as you can see in my picture) lists pickles as one of the ingredients. My sandwich came without pickles and when I asked for some at the counter, the girl working there said \"I don't think we have pickles\" (even though they're listed on three of their sandwiches). Then a girl working in the back said pretty rudely, \"Well, first of all, that's a typo on the menu\". Then erase it? The menu is literally on a chalkboard, couldn't be an easier problem to solve. They seriously wouldn't give me some freaking pickles for a sandwich with pickles listed on the ingredients? What kind of sandwich place is this? \n\nLater my friend asked for some jam for his toast, which they wouldn't give to him either. I guess they don't have jam or pickles or customer service here.", "author": "Elen H."}

I'm hooked.\n\nThis place is walking distance from CCSF, but if you really gotta take the K or drive, then by all means go for it. But the walk there is actually really nice, especially in the morning when you gotta wake up, like me. It's a small quaint little cafe near 24 hour fitness. Inside you'll find small tables, two sets of couches by the window, and a long table for people to share. There's a very homely atmosphere here, great for catching up with a pal or to study up and read.\n\nThe menu is fairly vast, serving coffee and tea, smoothies, salads and sandwiches, and pastries. The workers are very attentitive. They work fast and help you through the menu if you ask them. \n\nThis place serves some legit delicious coffee. I love coffee and have tried some places that serve the legit kind of coffee (not the kind at Starbucks, just saying) and this place has got it down. I love Chasing Lions at CCSF, but sometimes I gotta get around to other places. They serve drip coffee here and you can actually see them do it right by the register. Neato!\n\nI've had the following:\n- Caffe Mocha: this can be served in a cup if you're planning on staying, or in a paper cup to-go. Their mocha is very strong, the chocolate is rather prominent if anything. It's a warm and silky drink that isnt too hot, but it's warm enough to warm your insides on a cold day. If you have a sweet tooth and would prefer not to deal with the strong taste of coffee, this is your best bet.\n\n- Macchiato: this is preferably served if you are planning to stay in the cafe. Their traditional macchiato is served in a tiny glass cup, somewhat like a shot glass lol. This drink is pretty strong, they dont use too much cream and it goes straight down with a bitter cocoa taste. A preferable drink for those who can handle a few caffeine jitters. You can also take it to-go, but i believe thats a different macchiato.\n\n- Hot chocolate: what i really like about this place, is that they have drinks for kiddos too. Their hot chocolate is really smooth and has a hint of cream in it. Naturally the chocolate is dominant in taste, but it goes down nicely.\n\nLATTE ART. They do that here. It's pretty cool, if you show them a picture they may actually try to make it. But I am satisfied with the classic leaf latte art :). They accept cash and card whooop! \n\nI think i might frequent this place more. When i try their other drinks i will update this review heh.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

Recently we came by here one morning to get some coffee and egg & cheese croissants (the only things we ever order here). After ordering, we waited about 20 minutes with no egg & cheese croissant called up. We have ordered them many times before and we know that it does not take that long to make, even on a busy morning. He went up to remind the folks behind the register that we ordered food, after which they assured us that they'd be coming up soon. We waited about 10-15 minutes longer to no avail. In the meantime, we observed other customers' drinks and food getting served (including sandwiches and a *plain* croissant). I hate to bring the race angle into it, but it should be said that my boyfriend was the only black guy in the cafe and we were the only mixed race couple. I'm willing to give the employees the benefit of the doubt, but it's hard not to feel singled out when everyone else seems to be quickly served except us.\n\nAnyway, we ended up just getting a refund with no explanation as to what had occurred. I don't know if new management is to blame, but this just really put a dent in our morning. I used to love this cafe and I didn't want to give a negative review. I also work in customer service, so I sympathize with how tough it could get sometimes.

The 2 kind-hearted and efficient gals who ask about Brillo, you always make my day. And the chef makes great grub, with such a warm attitude. *blush*\n\nYes, the coffee's good! Sight Glass brand, hook me up! I like their white chocolate mocha, vanilla iced coffee, or a simple coffee straight-up (I add the extras). Chai lattes are yum: spicy goodness.\n\nDo order the tasty yet simple grilled cheese (made by the awesome chef)! The soup option changes, I have enjoyed it every time. I think you can try a small sample cup, but yeah you want it. The sandwiches are great (and big). Cookies and such are available, too.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Always clean.

Parking is plentiful (around the corner and down the block is all-day parking). \n\nThe coffee is decent, but when you already start with blue bottle coffee its hard to mess it up. Blue Bottle coffee without the crazy lines that happen downtown! That plus a relatively comfortable place to work and strong WiFi makes me inclined to come here more often.\n\nI'm just a little iffy based on staff here. Staff in general are cool. They run your orders pretty quickly, and from my best guess are probably students. They're just not the most customer-service oriented or...for lack of better words, professional. \n\nWhen I got my coffee, I was relatively friendly and the staff was...not. But I don't need bubbles and smiles all the time. It just felt a little curt/rude when I don't believe I did anything wrong. Hell, for a $3.50 coffee, I tipped $1. They were also complaining about what I can only assume was a yelp review, as the female behind the counter mentioned \"flagging it\" several times, as evidently the review was about her. But...maybe there's a reason this girl was mentioned in a previous review. \n\nI'd normally bump this place to a 4 star, because its a place I WOULD like to return to (though...if I come back and get mean service, I'd hazard a guess that they found out who I am and is not pleased). I'm bumping down because...of unprofessional demeanor. \n\nIt looked like someone had left a jacket, as this female staff skipped over to a table and loudly exclaimed \"someone left their jacket!\" Then. She promptly puts on the jacket. And sniffs it. \n\nUmm. No. I'm sorry. If someone left an item, you should only take it to the back or a safe place and hold it in hopes the person comes back. Feel free to wear and sniff if the jacket's been there for a month or even a WEEK and no one's returned to claim it. But. To wear someone's jacket who left it there for maybe an hour?

The workers! So much character, always cheerful, and they know their coffee beans! I like everyone that works here and they all have their own distinct personalities so you'd think an acting troupe had invaded this shop! \n\nThis spot has it all, occasional live music, diverse recorded music (great list), corner window views of frequent Ocean Ave near-crashes with the Muni Metro, bad-ass buff dudes going into the 24HR fitness across the street (for the ladies); for the guys: gorgeous eager and inconspicuous-looking women nearby the gym. And if you want cool, older dudes living off a pension by sitting under parasols drunk on the sidewalk while listening to the Giants, yep, you have that too just up the street! Soccer moms, hipsters, and college students unite at this place where studying gets serious after 5 PM. \n\nWith a tattoo parlor, yoga rooms, Eastern and Western (medicinal) herbal remedy places surrounding this spot, your life will enthusiastically become an Ocean Ave Bubble. \n\nUpdate: they got a cozy parklet in front!

I stood there looking at the menu looking confused on the menu (if youre not a regular, which unfortunately I am not) and not even one offer from the staff to help me figure out what I want. I ended up getting something safe to get so I got myself a tea. cold weather, hot beverage.. boom. but thats not the end of it. As I didnt know that there are types of teas to choose from and their menu for the tea was another battle for me to fight on. I thought I won and its all over but, its just getting started. took me another minute to decide and this lady staff in front of me looked like she tired of her work or doesnt wanna work in there no more. blank staring me like \"order already.. geeez\" kinda face. I decided to get whatever and I decided to get a bagel for my tummy. suddenly she uttered, \"we dont do bagels no more\" and I was confused as I see lots of bagels in front of me and didnt fully understood what she mean so I asked her to repeat what she said and meant they dont toast or warm up the bagel no more. I flared up inside as I try to shout inside my head bout what kind of coffee shop is this who sells bagel but dont warm them up? but because im starving, theres no way i would hate and not eat a cold bagel. I could take the cold bagel cause im pretty sure shes colder than it and im happy im not getting her but the less colder bagel instead. she sounded surprise that I still want em even if they were cold. she has the look on her face that I am really making her work and its pissing her off. finalized everything and i thought its all done yet again, as I paid, i was asked for my signature and whooosh, she flipped the iPad in front of her and wow! if its not attached to the base of it, she wouldve sent it away flying. well, that all leaves me for not givin any tip. must be harsh for me as I know that I need to give tip but with all that, i cant. sorry but not sorry as she is not either. ate my food and left.", "author": "Ian N."}

Like every serious person who likes to get out of the house, get work/study done, find a yummy and healthy cafe, with awesome wifi along with great smoothies/caffeine fix, bright, airy, lots of windows, open space, and friendly attentive staff that seems to really enjoy themselves? (Btw, we always drive by this cafe to and from WholeFoods and 24).\n\nHere's what happened. The bf and I knocked out a ton of work from 3-8pm closing. We were exhausted by the time we left, our brains were fried. We left and didn't realized till Sunday (yesterday morning) that my bf had left his laptop case, inside was the battery charger (super awesome battery charger that can charge multiple devices at once even iPad and laptop without having to recharge it after...I gave him for Christmas!!!). \n\nI called around 11am, someone answered that seemed very mellow and tired. I mentioned that we were the last of two couple that left before closing. I even in detailed told her where we were sitting (two square tables put together before the window table next to the armoire with magazines/flyers) told her my bf left his laptop case on the chair that he had tucked in. Not even a hold or, \"let me check,\" she just said (and I knew she didn't look for it).\"no there's nothing here.\" Great! She seemed unhelpful. Being that my bf is a patient man, he was understanding of their situation, (the bf: \"I remember retail, they're not going to look for it, they're busy or something.\")\n\nAnd me...I rarely take no for an answer, I called just about under 5 minutes later with hopes to speak to someone else that was more awake and helpful.\n\nI forgot her name but after asking questions she was one of the two girls that was tending the cafe on Saturday. I asked her the same, she said no and it wasn't there, but was more responsive and asked for my number in case she finds it. I asked if she was the girl with the beanie that closed and she said, \"no that was Chelsea I didn't close.\" I knew then she was the other girl that was there with Chelsea, but remembered it was only Chelsea closing and asking us if we needed to throw anything away from our table. I knew that if I talked to Chelsea she would have remembered us, after all there were only two couple that stayed till closing.\n\nWe then decided to stop by around 1pm or so. My bf went in and approached a guy name Ryan, and miraculously Ryan knew exactly what my bf had left and mentioned that Chelsea found it last night and Ryan opened the cafe earlier. Ryan went by the back area (kitchen) and my bf's laptop case and expensive battery charger was inside it! Viola! It was there! Maybe is was a miscommunication on some of the staff, but it was night and day between the 1st girl who answered, to the second girl, then Ryan in person. \n\nBravo to Ryan and Chelsea for not being dishonest and helpful. \n\nFrom the 5 hours of experience at Cafe Fog Lifter, although I didn't interact  much with Chelsea or come to the front register area (the bf took care of that for me), I'm an observer and being in the PR/Marketing field, Chelsea is good for your business. She was very interactive with everyone, she walked around the cafe, cleaning, changing the music station, making small talks and was overall a breath of fresh air to hear/see.\n\nMy bf and I plan to come back soon to thank Chelsea and hangout for a few hours and enjoy our day, maybe not work for too long this time.\n\nOh, I can't forget about their tasty and healthy choices of food, blue bottle coffe, drip coffee and cozy atmosphere. Fast wifi, too!\n\nAnyone can open a cafe, but not everyone is lucky enough to have it all. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Jules V."}

The internet is fantastic. The snacks and tea are decent, though just a smidge on the pricey side. The atmosphere is fantastic for chatting with random strangers or working and listening to great tunes. I've made friends with most of the employees there and had some great discussions on life and what not with them. \n\nSo here's the deal breaker. When I go to a place I don't want to be breathing the exhaust from what's being cooked and walk out of the place stinking to high hell. Especially, when I have to run out to an important meeting or something. Unfortunately, this has been happening all too often lately. I see a fan up near the ceiling and it doesn't get turned on to help with the ventilation. This is problematic and  I'm starting to loathe coming here. I hope they can solve the situation soon. \n\nI've been a loyal patron and my loyalty is being tested :(", "author": "Ehb T."}

However, with that said, I couldn't ignore how I was treated today at Fog Lifter Cafe.  I come here at least 3x per week to get coffee for myself and bagels for the kids. Today, I went in with my 4 yo and ordered us lunch. When we sat down, my son noticed that there are samples of pound cake next to the register and asked me to grab him one little sample. He ate it and asked me to grab one more, when I took the second one, I was told (in a condescending way) that it's one per customer (to which I explained, I'm one costumer and my son is another costumer). Her attitude was beyond rude and when I came up to the \"supervisor\", Erica, her attitude wasn't any better. As I tried to explain to her that this is no way to treat a respectable/repeat customer, she basically walked away from me as if she doesn't hear what I'm saying. Neither my son or I ate our lunch (which I spent over $25 for and left a 20% tip), I paid prior to this incident, and we both walked out of there. I'm appalled by this. This is beyond rude and I have never been treated this way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-10-07", "description": "This place is HORRIBLE! I was recommended by a friend and went in deciding to skip Noahs  for the first time for a lox bagel. BIG MISTAKE! The owner was at the register. I ordered the lox bagel. I asked if I could have half hummus and half cream cheese. The owner told me he didn't want to do it because the hummus was runny and sloppy when you put it on the bagel. I told him all they needed to do was cut it in half and do the spreads. So he rang it in. I asked for it scooped. He rolled his eyes... and rang that in. I could see is customer service skills lacked big time. He tells me the total is 10 something. The bagel was $7.75 plus he was charging me $2 for the hummus lol. Okay fine. I questioned the displayed price of the bagel. It said it was $6.75 for the entire lox bagel with everything.  He showed me the itemized pricing which said: $2 for the onion bagel, $4.75 for the lox and toppings and $1 for cream cheese which totaled $7.75.  The price that said LOX BAGEL with cucumbers, capers, red onions, lox and cream cheese read $6.75 and I was asking him why am I getting charged an extra $1 ? He said for the bagel. I explained to him the menu read LOX BAGEL with the toppings for $6.75 which means it comes with everything it says on his menu for $6.75.. nowhere does it say the bagel is extra. Then his employee behind him said \"that's what you get\" very rudely. Who owns a business  and allows their employees to bad mouth a customer?! I said nothing to her she looked like she came from a dumpster anyways, like she didnt shower. I asked him to honor the price it says. He said he would change it later but he's not going to do anything about it now and can't change the price.. I told him I run restaurants for a living and when we advertise something on our menu for a price we have to honor it and that's what his menu read. IT GETS BETTER!  He then turns around pointing to a sign saying he is refusing service to me and has the right to... After being rude to me as a first time customer, trying to be lazy just because hummus gets gloppy, rolling his eyes, letting his employee badger me, false advertising, not honoring posted prices he then refuses service to me. I have written one yelp review in my life but  told him I would write one as i proceed to walk out. OH FOR SURE. And as im walking out he continues to yell at me saying \"oh yea?! another yelp review!\" I have never in my life experienced anyone so miserable that acts like that to someone who is starting their day and contributing to their business. It was the most horrifying experience i have ever had. I have been in the restaurant industry managing fast casual to huge 400 seating fine dining restaurants for the last 15 years with hundreds of employees. If I could give 0 stars would. He and his staff lack serious customer service and business skills. No wonder they are stuck working at a coffee shop. Needless to say I will NEVER go back again and I am going to spread the word that false advertising, attitude and allowing your staff to attack your customer is not the way you run your business. Customers help your business stay afloat. They are in your house. You honor what you advertise and you give service with a smile. Customer service is about a happy business exchange. You people should learn the key to customer service which is believe, listen, apologize,satisfy, and thank and I definitely did not get any of that. For every one customer that has a bad experience, they are going to tell as many people as they can not to go there. As a business, fighting over a $1 to keep all the customers you would be losing is not worth  it... that's REAL business thinking. Now look, here I am writing a yelp review because of how I was treated when it could have been easily resolved if they knew how to handle the situation. They keep it going that way they will eventually go under. Greed is not the way you execute. Karma will come back to bite them. UNPROFESSIONAL.

The espresso is fantastic, brewed with a wonderfully creamy head and their regular coffees are brewed by the cup (which is a superb method, making every cup unique and perfect). But this isn't a blue bottle review! \n\nAnyway the owner is a real swell guy (and I'm not just sayin' that cause he's also my neighbor haha) who was at the front when the store just opened. Now its manned by a motley crew of baristas who, although quite efficient at what they do, are a bit on the icey side.

Just like most cafes, there are a lot of young people with laptops and stuff. We went there after lunch time, so there were plenty of seats available for the three of us. We ordered 3 panini (North beach, Roast Beef and Chicken) for each of us and a drink. It was very hot today, we didnt get any hot drinks. I'll definitely try the coffees next time. So, we ordered our food and the total came up more than I expected.. Then I asked the lady for the receipt, but she didn't give it to me, i don't know why. Well, I thought, let me talk to my son, maybe I was wrong. We only ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 ice tea, and I paid over $35??? The panini is no more than $8 each, plus an ice tea, $35? Then, my son went to the counter, picked up the food and asked the lady about it. She looked into the computer and then realized she pushed the wrong button. I was overpaid by $8. I'm happy I got the money. Later, the lady came to our table and apologize for the mistake she did. I thought that was kinda nice. I bet she already said sorry to my son, so it wasn't necessary to apologize to me again. I really appreciate for her attitude. Well, the panini was so delicious. It was big.

I think this is an understatement - they take no prisoners!  \"Huh\" is a popular entry in their limited vernacular. They don't know how to properly drip coffee.  And can't tell you the county of origin.  They used to serve Blue Bottle before they ended wholesaling.  Too bad, because no one knew how to prepare it.  They have served me stale - as in \"HARD\" - baked goods.  I ordered a soup once . . .  the owner said it was very good.  It may have been \"very good\" about a month before I ordered it; the texture was mush.  (I can take exception since I do have functioning teeth, in sufficient quantity).  I asked the barista - the type you wouldn't take home to meet mama - if I need a key for the rest room.  She is no slave to fashion and I think she hides a whip under her apron.  \"It's closed, we have to clean it, there are only two of us . . .

I live right up the street and I planned on making it my daily morning stop on my way to work.\n\nI went in a week or two ago and my excitement promptly fizzled.\n\nI walked up to the counter and there were only two other customers in there-- a girl on her laptop at a table, and a guy ordering at the counter in front of me.  I stood behind him a bit, and looked over the menu while I was waiting to be helped.\n\nThe guy in front of me wasn't buying anything, it turns out.  He was standing there chatting with a man I have to assume is the owner.  He was standing at the cash register, but he was going on and on about how fresh his ingredients are and how proud he is of his cafe, so I'm pretty sure he's the owner.\n\nCool, I'm all for pride in your work!\n\nSo I wait.  And wait.  And I'm being completely ignored by the owner who is so into talking about how his cafe is the best place in the world that he can't even say hello to me or ask one of the guys behind the counter to help me.  So I wait more.  And wait.  And wait.\n\nFinally one of the other workers noticed me and took my coffee order.  He was super friendly and nice, cracking jokes while he helped me.  I liked that.  The one star in this review is for that guy.\n\nWhat I didn't like was all this time the owner STILL hasn't even acknowledged I'm there, and the poor guy helping me had to physically MOVE the owner out of the way in order to ring me up.\n\nOh, and the icing on the cake?  The owner was SLAMMING other local businesses.  It's one thing to be proud of what you do and your cafe, but he did NOT need to mentally go down Ocean Ave and put down almost every single other business on the street, naming names and saying you're so much better than they are.  Real classy.\n\nThat was my first impression, and it will also be my last.  I won't be stepping foot in there ever again, I'll simply take my daily business elsewhere.

There are two decent coffee places along Ocean, and this is one of them (the other is Java on Ocean). Their coffee and mochas are perfect, and the ambiance and setting is nice. It feels very open and inviting just when you're walking in, and the food they offer (though somewhat limited says my friend), is good, and made fresh. Because of this however, the service can be a little slow. It took a very long time for them to toast a bagel and put cream cheese on it when I went a few weeks ago, and I'm not sure if they've been able to speed it up at all.\n\nI'm optimistic however that any negative things (both in their service speed, and things said in the other reviews), will hopefully be resolved.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-17", "description": "They have a sign at the register that reads \"no cell phones when ordering\" or something to that effect. Makes a lot of sense, it's rude when customers try to order while on the phone. It was ironic that with that sign posted the girl behind the counter was completely ignoring me while she was at the register totaling receipts or something. No I'll be right with you or even eye contact to let me know she sees me and she will help me when she's done. A guy came from behind the counter to help me and as he went to use the register to charge me, the girl still wouldn't get out of the way so he could provide me with good service even if she didn't. I ended up feeling like my business was bothering her. As I consumed my purchase I couldn't help but notice that all other employees seemed pretty nice while she remained indifferent to other customers. At least she made time to chat with and be friendly towards her coworkers. It would be nice, and good business if she treated her customers the same way.\n\nNow the food, I had an awesome turkey and provolone sandwich the first time I came, it was pretty good. I ordered it again another time and it was terrible. It was made with different bread, little to no cheese, and I swear the first time it had some sort of pesto mayo or something like it that made it taste delicious, the second one-plain and dry. On another occasion, I met up with a friend who was having quiche served with salad. It was great, the spinach salad had goat cheese crumbles and I could see on the sliced tomato that it had been salted and peppered. Since I ended up eating half of my friends food, I got up and ordered another quiche no more than 10 minutes since the first was ordered, totally different experience. The quiche was the same but there was no cheese on the salad and no salt or pepper on the tomato. Bland! \n\nIn summary, food is hit or miss (apparently due to lack of consistency or attention to detail from the too cool for school hipster staff), service sometimes okay sometimes makes you feel like you are bothering them if you need to be acknowledged.", "author": "erika e."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-22", "description": "I really want to love this place because it's so close to my house, and the decor is nice, and the place is always clean. BUT, I went there today and there were two apathetic barristas who obviously would rather be ANYWHERE else doing nothing (like picking out hipster-sweaters) than doing nothing behind the counter of this cafe.  \n\nI had not eaten all day, so I wanted to order a bagel sandwich for lunch, but they ran out of bagels (really, that's half of the menu?!), so I ordered a vegan falafel and hummus sandwich. It took the sandwich over 25 minutes to appear even though the place was entirely empty when I arrived.  I also had ordered a famous \"blue bottle drip coffee\" and 30 minutes after ordering, I went up to ask where my coffee was and the guy said, \"oh, I forgot\" to make it. Nice. So I had to wait 10 more minutes for the coffee.  So, just a 40-minute wait for a small coffee and a 25-minute wait for a sandwich when the place is empty.  Awesome service guys!  They were literally standing there just staring blankly into space.  I spent $9 for these two items.\n\nFinally, a few people wander in and they also wait at least 15 minutes (to 25) for their coffee.  This is so striking, that I say aloud, \"wow, this is the first coffee shop I've ever been to where no one has a coffee in front of them.\"  SO, 6 people just sitting in their seats waiting and waiting endlessly. For coffee. Wow.  I so want to go to Starbucks right about now!\n\nSo then comes the sandwich. Ugh. Really, really terrible.  The \"bread\" is actually a wrap, not panini bread as advertised (they just panini press it)  and the falafels are re-fried to a burnt crisp in really old (bitter) oil and taste VERY foul.  They overdid the tahini and not enough hummus, so overall, the sandwich is the most bitter item I have ever paid to eat.  It was 1 pm, so out of starvation & convenience, I ate it anyway.  To top it off, the sandwich sent me straight to the bathroom in a bad way 15 minutes after eating it.  You think that's a coincidence?  By BF went straight to the bathroom 10 minutes after just taking a few bites. They should call it a bullet sandwich.  So it was like buying a $7 enema. :-p\n\nDO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE unless you have 20 minutes to waste waiting for a small cup of coffee or you really need to end your bout of constipation FAST.  \n\nBoth stars above are solely for the look of the place itself, which is nice. Zero for service and product.  By the way, the first time I came here, I was buying a coffee a few minutes to nine on my way to work...BIG MISTAKE! I had to cancel it as ten minutes later, no coffee in sight. Half of the slowness is the workers' fault: they just don't care.", "author": "Lisita P."}

Standing around watching it drop didn't seem like a good plan, there were 3 cups up there and not sure which one was mine. When it was finally ready, the splash on the cup was a mess.

Spacious and populated by the usual suspects along with one time visitors like ourselves. Though we enjoyed the local flavor the coffee was brewed by adding hot water to the grind in a filter held by a funnel with the cup a few inches below. This allowed the water to drip freely into the waiting cup. Nice idea however the coffee ends up tepid at best as it cools on its way to the cup. Granted this was a cool SF day but aren't most Summer days like this? Since I stay away from Microwaving if possible, this would have been the only way to make my coffee HOT!. The inventory of sweet rolls etc. had been picked over by the early crowd no doubt as we struggled to find something to have with our coffee that we liked. We also noted the servers were having conversations that were continued until completion while we waited to give our orders and again as we came to the counter to get our coffee. Some on site management, customer policies and alternative brewing techniques would help this establishment. Good luck, Michael M.(SF Native).", "author": "Michael M."}

I took a few bites before I started to read my book. It was very tasty, so I ended up eating it all before I delved into the world of Murakami. Then, as I was reading my book, I started coughing uncontrollably, out of nowhere. I wondered what the cause was until I realized that the whole cafe had filled up with a smoky feeling from all the sandwiches that were being made. I was the only one coughing, which made me feel like an anomaly, so I tried to move to another area of the cafe that had better ventilation. As it turned out, wherever I sat, I had the sensation to cough. At one point, I was relieved to see the door opening to let air in. I couldn't open the door and leave it open because it was one of those cold and windy days in San Francisco, where if I tried to open the door, the customers would likely give me the death stare. I couldn't take it anymore, so I had to leave that place.\n\nI still go back occasionally.

The coffee is wonderful, staff friendly and the owners are very hands on within the shop. I highly recommend Fog Lifter Cafe if you are looking for a delicious cappuccino (my favorite) and some quite time to yourself. Coffee has always been a love of mine and Fog Lifter Cafe has never let me down!", "author": "Teresa V."}

I love the casual atmosphere and the sandwiches are great too! On the other hand, sometimes staff members get confused on which order was for whom. If this could be more organized, then I would give this place 5 stars. The live music on Sundays is just okay. The band is great but the singer is okay.", "author": "Palina P."}
