The service was a tiny bit slow because our group of 8 was in the upstairs dining room, but none of us cared because we were having such a good time catching up on each other's lives. \nThe food, however, was excellent. Each dish was tasty and beautifully presented, and they were all served at the same time (a big plus with our group); there were no seasonings on the table, but none was needed. \n\nI had an appetizer of grilled jumbo shrimp, which were so large they approximated small lobsters, with a big serving of really tasty saut\u00e9ed fresh arugula. Mmmmm! My penne pasta main dish was really good, too. \n\nDessert I shared with two others at our table. It was a sampler of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, wild fruit and walnuts, and four other ice cream delights. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant if you are in town. The view alone of the light show on the Bay Bridge is worth just sitting there and sipping a glass of good wine.", "author": "Jane G."}

Stated CLEARLY that because we have family visiting from oversea, we wanted to make sure they able to sit at the deck and view the night view with bridge( that is the main reason why I chose them).  I also told them that my grandma is on wheelchair, so definitely no stairs.  One day before the dinner, i called and double confirmed my reservation. \n\nOn the day, i called 30mins earlier and I told them we could be 15 mins late due to heavy traffic. In result, After 20 hrs flight, they had us waiting at the sofa area for nearly 45mins! Not even apology, no a glass of water to offer. AND NO DECK TABLE.  If it wasnt for my grandma as she couldnt walk , and it was already almost 9pm,  i would have walk away.  \n\nFood was ok. My husband had business dinner there and still chose there purely for the view. Did not have much expectation. Dining Service was ok( well Our dinner for four was 570usd). What ridiculous was, I was later told that our tips was not enough for their restaurant policy or whatever.  In conclusion, if it wasnt because I had no other choices that night, i would not welcome my family on such a place. \n\nI have been to so many places, but never be treated like that. Its not a cheap place, but with this kind of service, they should be closed down.", "author": "Trace N."}

We came here for a birthday celebration with a reservation for about 18 people. We were able to be seated in a semi-booth section where one side of our table was on the booth seating and the other half had individual chairs. Originally everyone was going great and we started with drinks, but suddenly we were approach by one of the floor managers.\n\nThe manager scolded us and shared that one part of our table was too loud and disrupting other nearby guests. It was extremely rude how he approached the table and rather than warning or explaining politely that the table should be considerate of nearby guests, the manager came off as brash and impolite. The servers were very friendly and did not have any issues with the table, and oddly enough the guests that had originally complained about some of us being too loud wanted to congratulate our friend for her birthday and shared that they did not agree with how the floor manager handled the situation.\n\nThe food did not all come out at once and it took quite a while from the first entree placed on the table to the last entree delivered from the kitchen. I ordered a mashed potato and chicken thigh combination plate that was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I also had two desserts brought in from outside to be fridged and brought out at the end of the meal, but the cook or server accidentally broke a part of the dessert (cracked a macaron on the cake and a piece of the chocolate fell off). Not a big deal, but a reflection of how detailed this place works.\n\nOverall, for the price and location of this restaurant, there could be some improvement. The FOH manager basically ruined the night of celebration and I would not recommend going to this restaurant for large parties as you may get entrees at random times and everyone would not be able to eat at the same time.", "author": "Jason Y."}

They also have a small parking lot adjacent to the building which makes life very easy.\n\nI find the negative reviews related to service puzzling and unfortunate. The staff is like a family and takes great pride in working there.  The owner treats them like family and is dedicated to making dining there a great experience.  All that said, there is only so much that restaurant staff has control of.  The review from someone in a 18 person party seems incapable of having any self-awareness and did not like being told to tone it down. He also complained about how 18 entrees didn't all come out of the kitchen at once so doesn't seem to understand how restaurants work. Also, when I read such negative comments from one side of the situation, you can be assured that there is an opposite side to the story that is never heard. Not all restaurant patrons and their expectations are alike and some will never be happy with their experience.\n\nThere is a reason the Waterfront has been in business for so long and it is not by providing the type of service that some recent reviewers have commented on.", "author": "Don S."}

Since our timing was just before the dinner rush, we were seated quickly in a lovely table facing the view. Our server, Doug, came over quickly and brought us waters. There was fresh bread baking so he asked if we minded waiting, which we didn't. He also served us some bread from the earlier batch while we waited. Doug answered a lot of our questions about the menu, and we ended up deciding to start with the lobster risotto. It was a fabulous choice. Super flavorful and delicious. For our dinner entrees we ordered the mixed grill and the whole, both which were amazing! Tariq greeted us and ensured that our experience was to our liking. We also had coffee and the Nutella pie.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-25", "description": "Extremely disappointing experience over the phone this past Wednesday (10/24/2018) with Waterfront Restaurant's special events coordinator.  My interaction with this special events coordinator was not only extremely disappointing, but her language and tone of voice toward me demonstrated a discrimination toward those for whom English is not their first language.  So much for open-mindedness and equality for all in San Francisco.\n\nFor anyone else in the Hospitality industry, and really, for anyone who is looking to book a dinner along San Francisco's waterfront, I would like to share three items from my interaction:\n\n1.  The special events coordinator called me to discuss the menu for my group of 24 guests.  She ticked off each course, specifying how many of each I could select for the pre-set menu.  Because I received the call without notice, I was pulling up the menu as she spoke.  I kindly asked her to repeat so I could follow along.  Her response?  \"Can you READ numbers?\"  She went on to pronounce that what she had said was CLEARLY shown on the menu.  Who would have thought that kindly asking a special events coordinator to repeat something as benign as a menu would provoke such an impatient, rude, and clearly condescending response? Her tone and choice of words smelled horribly of discrimination and was very offensive.\n\n2.  Let's talk about READING.  The order form clearly states, and I am proud to say that I read it all by myself, that menu choices and final head count are to be provided 48 hours in advance.  So, when this special events coordinator said that my choices should have been given 5 DAYS in advance, I was incredulous.  I asked her, where on the order form does it say \"5 days in advance?\"  To this, she could only respond that the order form indicates \"48 hours in advance.\" You're questioning MY ability to read numbers?!  How dare you try to insult my intelligence when you are telling me you can't do mental math at a second grader's level?  Yep, and I'm the one who can't read.  Gotcha.\n\n3.  So, this is the best that Waterfront Restaurant can do for a special events coordinator?  Is this how a restaurant treats its corporate partners and clients?  I am bringing to your establishment a party of 24 on a weekday, and this is the service that I get?\n\nWaterfront Restaurant:  The message your staff member sent me is loud and clear - You don't appreciate or value your guests.  There are plenty of restaurants along the Embarcadero.  It is not a problem at all to hold a party at any other restaurant, and on a weekday at that.  So, don't worry, after this past Wednesday's experience, I will not bring any more business to your restaurant again.", "author": "Cookies388 C."}

I let the waiter know it was my birthday and I really wanted to enjoy this meal and night... I didn't want to feel RUSHED through dinner, which was my feeling as it began....  long story short, we were VERY DISAPPOINTED with our meal. Not the service... he was very nice, so nice that we didn't say anything to him and we absolutely should have.

I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be a complainer, but after eating what we could of it, my boyfriend says \"that salad wasn't very good...the lettuce was so bitter\" YES!! was my answer.... Boyfriend ordered the New York Strip medium rare,  I ordered the Whole Crab with a chili oil pasta under the shell. I asked the server if he thought I was making a good decision?... \"Oh yes, that's one of our specialties\" he says.  Awesome lets do it!!! \nBoyfriends steak comes back WELL DONE, he sends it back and a new steak comes back so purple in color it's so raw. He sends it back again.... ok now he can eat it! However...he's got a pile of gristle on the side of his plate thats building up as he's trying to enjoy the steak. My crab was pretty much tasteless, not one bit of sweetness, and the pasta under the shell was gummy and mushy, it also was bland, nothing interesting about it and gushy.... It wasn't worth the work needed to get the crab out of the shell. I stopped eating ... we had another glass of wine to soothe our disappointment.

I have hosted many holiday parties, team meetings, and summer events around San Francisco and the Financial District and never have I been so stressed and unsure about how the event was going to turn out that night. Cheryl was so hard to get a hold of and made it seem that if we didn't put down $10K right away then she would give away our reservation hold to the first person who would put down the deposit first. I signed the contract and assured her that I would get her the check within a week since it has to go through approvals and through our accounting department.

We politely told her where we had requested to sit and she rolled her eyes, and we overheard her say something to another waiter as my girlfriend and I walked back down.\nCool..\nWhen we eventually did get seated, it wasn't where we wanted, but it was close enough, we were tired of waiting.\nNow the food......\nWe ordered three dishes to share: The peppers as an appetizer, the lobster mac and cheese, and the grilled salmon plate. We did not wait too long for the food to arrive, but when it did, it looked and tasted like my brother in high school had cooked it up before going to the gym so that he could eat it after. Just throws the food into a skillet and makes due, to him food is food, no additives necessary. \nThe peppers were just... peppers.. literally just a plate of (semi-roasted?)peppers (with the seeds inside) and sauce. Ate one and done. The mac and cheese was eh. Go to homeroom in Berkeley and save yourself the trouble. If it weren't for the lobster, which was rubbery and NOT fresh, you can get this mac and cheese anywhere for a fraction of the price. Now the salmon.. bland. bland. bland. Here is what was on the plate of salmon: one piece of grilled salmon, and some greens.. that's it. Oh and a lemon. No creativity, at all. Again, it looked like my brother in high school cooked up that salmon dish.\n\nSo with the sub par service, and bland, somewhat okay to eat food.. You are mostly paying for the location. My girlfriend and I would have been much happier walking a few blocks down and getting some innout burgers and fries instead. Pretty good location, but they would at least have more flavor.", "author": "Nesrine B."}

The food was average for what you paid for, but I guess you're really paying for the location and views of the Bay Bridge. My friend who organized everything had difficulty the entire time with the manager Mustafa. He even apologized to the party next to us for seating them there because he thought we were being \"too loud.\" They actually came over to us after and told us happy birthday and to continue celebrating and actually apologized for having to deal with that because they didn't mind having us next to them at all and were really sweet! I used to work in the restaurant industry so it's interesting to see when managers are the problem rather than the ones going out of their way to help you.

However, Muni was in a funk and after 30 minutes of waiting in vain we had the ambitious idea of walking to the Wharf along the Embarcadero. Alas, ambition flagged around Pier 5 when we saw the Waterfront Restaurant and our feet voted for lunch now.\n\nWe enjoyed our lunch here, anchored by beautiful views of the Bay Bridge. A highlight was the side order of clam chowder, which was just excellent. A nice chowder thick with clams, potatoes, bacon cheese and vegetables, it was a very rich chowder and so tasty. The sourdough bread on the table was perfect and fresh, the type of bread you could make a meal of.\n\nWe both had the crab sandwich ($24) with a side order of sweet potato fries. Given the cool day, a hot sandwich might've been better, the crab sandwiches are cold. But they are on that good sourdough bread, and the crab is excellent. They come with a small green salad on the plate, which is good but the sauce is quite salty.  The sweet potato fries were also heavily salted, more so than necessary, but we still polished them off.\n\nAll told a fine lunch, but pricey, as the total came to $82.", "author": "David F."}

Chris provided us the level of service you'd expect if we were his only table when in reality he was assigned to way too many tables. We watched his service at nearby tables and he provided this level of service across the board! His knowledge of wine exceeded most sommeliers that have served us. His commitment to proper fine dining service (when he was clearly overworked) was impressive. The food was good but that is not what made my review 5 stars it was the service. We ate here about six months ago and again about 3 weeks ago both times we were lucky enough to have Chris as our server and he remembered us!

Expensive usually means either good location (on the Waterfront... get it?) or great quality food.  This place has a little from column A and a little from column B.  \n\nI came here with the family and out of 4 people, 3 got their cioppino and one (me) got the branzino.  We also ordered a calamari to share.\n\nCalamari: It had a decent flavor and it 'wasn't overly greasy.  The dipping sauce complimented it well and was a pleasant dish.  It was a little on the pricey side though at $15.  Was it worth it?  Yes.  \n\nCioppino: I tried some from the other peoples' plates.  The most amusing thing to me was that none of them finished.  These plates were a healthy portion and if you ask for it \"lazy\" you get the body meat instead of claw meat.  The broth had a good taste and the seafood was well cooked.  \n\nBranzino: Normally don't order this but I'm actually TRYING to watch my figure.  The fish was cooked perfectly with a great crisp to the skin.  There was a dungenous grab concoction in the head cavity which was also tasty.  All this served on a bed of veggies.  Pretty good food and I'd definitely order it again if it weren't $38.  Definitely not enough for me to share. \n\nThe best part of this place was the view.  It's located on the embarcadero and has a great view of the bridge.  A very romantic spot perfect for a date.  Except I was here with family.

There were 4 clams, 2 of them were like someone already ate , just left the edge of part of the clams . I told her abt it, she took them to the kitchen & took the same one back , & said : the Chef said they were like that   we were like Why another 2 are so full & juicy , after we asked for some more bread, our waitress put the bread on top of the empty seafood shell. Hello !! No clean plates ? Really? Where is her common sense. We have to told her to gave us some clean plate. After all, food was tasteless , I don't like salty food, but i have to put salt in every single dishes.

Many of the restaurants we looked up were all booked up that night, but we were able to make 7:30 reservations here about an hour in advance. \n\nWhen we arrived we were seated pretty quickly in the \"outside\" dining area, which was covered by a plastic tent thing with heaters and a good view of the water. The whole restaurant was very beautifully decorated for the holidays. It was a bit chilly that night despite the heated tent. I think the tent could use another heater. Since there's not much of a view at night other than some boats and the lit-up bridge, I would recommend sitting inside, where it's warmer, if you get here after dark.\n\nOur waiter was friendly but not really great at giving advice about what to order. One of my coworkers asked for wine recs and he spoke for a few minutes, but mostly along the lines of \"it depends on what you feel like.\" My coworker ultimately didn't find that to be helpful. The service was attentive when the waiter was at our table, but otherwise it was a bit slow. It took awhile for the table to be cleared after our mains and our dessert. \n\nThe food was surprisingly good; I expected it to be very bland since I thought the restaurant was more touristy, but my coworker and I both loved the seafood linguini, which was flavorful and had a generous amount of seafood. My other coworkers got the sea bass and the cioppino; both were presented attractively and had generous portions. The entrees were pretty pricy, but you got a lot of food and it all tasted great, so it was probably a good deal for the location.\n\nThere were quite a few dessert options; I would recommend the chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake if you have 15 minutes to wait for it to come out. It is piping hot when you cut into it and really delicious. We also got the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was pretty standard. The desserts were about $9 each, which I found to be a bit steep for the size.\n\nOverall, a good meal, if a little pricy.

I have eaten here a few times now and I'm surprised at the 3 star average. The food has consistently been very good. The view is awesome and they have plenty of outdoor seating. The price is a bit high but for the location on the Embarcadero overlooking the bay it's well worth it.\n\nI had a Caesar salad (points for coming with bocarones), and fried calamari, fennel and rock shrimp. All were very good. The buttermilk fried rock shrimp were especially tasty. My friend really enjoyed his meal (apologies, I can't remember what he ordered). \n\nThis is a 'hidden gem' right in plain sight.

Service was very slow, and I don't mean in a good way.  We enjoy a leisurely dinner, but this was too slow.  It took about 15 full  minutes after being seated before our waiter checked in.  We also had to request bread service as there was no bread basket, but a bread server who made appearances only upon request.  \n\nI had prosciutto wrapped shrimp and my wife enjoyed a salad as an appetizer. Both were good to very good (but how hard is bacon wrapped shrimp?!).  We split a seafood pasta that was good, but far from great.  The scallops, for example, were pea sized, which is no crime itself, but higher quality seafood restaurants typically warn when scallops are atypical.  I had one cocktail, and we skipped dessert.

It was unusually warm the week we were there so we took advantage of the weather and decided to just walk and enjoy the beauty of the city. My daughter was getting hungry for lunch after our visit to the Ferry Plaza. We stopped to look at menus of all the restaurants we passed as we made our way towards Fisherman's Wharf. The Waterfront is where my 12 yr. old daughter exclaimed, \"I want to have lunch here!\" \nWe were seated right away and told that computers were down but serving us would not be a problem. Specials of the day were explained, menus were handed out, water was poured and we were told some one would be with us shortly.  The view from the restaurant is AMAZING. We sat for about 30 minutes without anyone coming back to our table. We watched another couple get seated, order their entrees and get served round 2 of cocktails before a server asked if we had been helped.  No, we replied. He acted like he was super confused by that but immediately launched into action by asking if we'd like to hear the specials of the day. No, we replied, we already heard them when we were seated. His reply to us, \"Oh? So you HAVE been helped before this?!?!\" I had to make a personal choice to keep it together, not get annoyed, stay positive and and enjoy the moment I was having with my wonderful family when I literally wanted to walk out and not patronize an establishment with such rude, sarcastic waitstaff.  He continued to have his panties in a bunch the entire time he \"served\" us. Seriously, rude, rude, rude. \nPositives: The view from the restaurant is incredible. On this particular day, clear and absolutely breathtaking. The food was good. My daughter really liked her Caesar salad and my hubby enjoyed his crab sandwich. Lunch for 3 including 2 cocktails was very reasonable. \nIf it wasn't for the unfortunate service that we received, I could have seen us making this restaurant a regular stop when we come to town.

Their website said since 1969.  I used to ride my bike around here when I was eight years old, and they are still here!!  I think that's so cool.\n\nMany famous people have dined here from Sports to Music to Movie Stars.... It is a definite destination for the big names. I even remember seeing in the news that Madonna came here, and the Waterfront is considered as one of her favorite places to dine in San Francisco.\n\nYou will find the Waterfront menu is known for their Seafood, particularly their Waterfront Cioppino. It was really good. I also enjoyed my Buttermilk Calamari with Rock Shrimp and Fennel.  I did noticed that they did not have a Vegan selection on the menu which was a bit of a let down for some of my coworkers.  I hope that they can incorporate this in their menu as San Francisco is a major foodie hub!\n\nFor some that may not know, the Waterfront also serves Happy Hour with cocktails for only $7, fresh Oysters for .99 cents and try their bake Oysters for only $5.  It will melt in your mouth.\n\nWhen you make your reservation, asked for the view towards the Bay Bridge. When the lights are lit up, it makes a very cozy and romantic dinner for two.\n\nFor a large group like company parties, you can dine in the middle where you will have your own space, and your group will be separated from everyone else.  It keeps conversation a lot easier to understand too.  \n\nOverall, service here was great, and I suggest you use their valet parking for about $16.  It is very convenient and only a few steps away from the front door!  \n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

They were fighting a leak around one of the plexiglass doors but we were seated on the other side so no problems for us.  We had a really great view of the Bay Bridge that was undiminished by the rain.\n\nI had chowder for lunch so opted for the heirloom tomato salad for my starter which was quite good.  My husband had the chowder that he thought was really tasty.  From there, I had seafood linguine and he had sea bass.  I'm surprised to see the bad reviews for the sea bass here as his was well cooked and moist as one would expect.  My linguine featured fresh pasta  and seafood in a light broth.  A little salty for my taste but probably just right for most as I don't eat much salt.\n\nWe shared sticky toffee carmel pudding for dessert.  This was a letdown as it was nothing like we expected.  Extremely sweet it was sort of a sliced sweet bread (think banana bread without the banana) with the sauce poured over the top.  The table next to us had the apple crisp that looked much better.\n\nThere are better restaurants in San Francisco for sure but most don't have the view the Waterfront does so balance the two and you'll have a great visit.", "author": "Ann K."}

Seating was instant and we overlooked the Marina area. \n\nThe food: \n\nI had the salmon entree which included mashed potato and a thick tomato [paste] side. With a side of white sauce that I didn't really care for or touch.\nIt was a good plate. I wouldn't recommend it for those who could eat because I wasn't really filled up much but it's perfect if you get an appetizer. \n\nI had garlic fries appetizer and I actually really liked it. Usually I'm not a fan of fries and have something to complain about. But it was good\n\nWe had the pizza and that was pretty plain. I'm not a big pizza person but it was pretty bland. \n\nThe service: \n\nService was on point. The host was nice and we were seated immediately. The food came out in a timely manner. When we sat down, drinks were brought up really fast. Although our male server wasn't the friendliest, he was cordial, proper and attentive. The busser was friendly and really fast. We never had to wait long for anything. And when we requested items, they came out almost immediately. There weren't many customers. I'd say it was outside, but that's still points in my book. Props to management for scheduling enough workers. \n\nThe ambiance: \n\nAbsolutely perfect. I wasn't really a fan of the paper atop the table over the cloth because my water kept seeping through it. But besides that, the ambiance was amazing. The view was superb. Temperature was perfect. It wasn't too crowded. Tables weren't mushed together. I liked it. I had nothing to complain about. \n\nOverall: \n\nI had an amazing late lunch experience. I would do it again and also recommend it, especially during that time. For someone who wants something nice, easy, and simple.I would say for improvements, maybe our server should be more friendly and smile a bit and I would say maybe add some pizzaz to the pizza and maybe take away that tomato thing & sauce for the salmon (but the salmon thing is just my preference; maybe others really like it).", "author": "Jill H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-24", "description": "After dinner reservations were somehow taken over at the Slanted Door and we were turned away last weekend (despite dinner reservations being made over the phone), we had to look for another option nearby and this, The Waterfront, was it. \n\nTo begin, getting seated and welcomed here was a breeze. The woman at check-in was inviting and prompt. My mother and I were seated in the covered outdoor seating where the temperature was cool and the pretty porch lights and Bay Bridge were twinkling. Great seats and we did't even have to ask for it - sweet! \n\nWe started with the house bread and butter, of course! No complaints there but I never complain about bread. After that, the prosciutto wrapped shrimp to start. I'll be honest, when this dish came out the smell of the ocean was real. I get that shrimp come from the ocean (duh) but it was just so fishy that it was concerning. We proceeded anyways and while my mom had 1/4, I did finish the other 3. The shrimps were large and despite the scent, good. I would however not get the dish again as $18 for 4 shrimps is simply too steep! How about $12-$15 instead? \n\nNext, I ordered a bowl of clam chowder and my mom got the filet. I will not recommend the chowder here - rather disappointing. As for the filet, this is no steakhouse and for $44, we could have gotten better elsewhere. \n\nLastly, we did not order any dessert but we did enjoy two cocktails. No complaints on the cocktails as they were both standard beverages. \n\nService was OK. For whatever reason, our server's helping hand wasn't all that helpful. I was left without a spoon for my chowder for more than 5 minutes - a little too long to wait to begin eating a warm bowl of soup. Our water refills were always delayed and had to be asked for. In addition, I gave my credit card to the server when we were seated and he brought the bill to the table at the end as unpaid and no CC inside. This was rather annoying since I was trying to pay in advance with intention. 10 minutes went by and I had to go find him to let him know he had my card. I do keep in mind that it was getting late (10 PM) and I blame dining here so late for the overall service experience. \n\nAnyways, no real mess here with food or service but I simply wouldn't think to go back or recommend it.", "author": "Juri M."}

(M-F from 3:00pm-6:00pm)\n\nAfter a fun-filled day at the Exploratorium, my friend and I thought this would be a great place to have some beer and chow down on some munchies. Luckily, we didn't have to walk to far and decided to stop by The Waterfront for happy hour. \n\nAll I have to say is $1 OYSTERS! I am pretty surprise at the size of these bad boys. Fresh, juicy, and soooo delicious. We had about 20+ shared between the two of us and was fairly satisfied. If I came back again, I would just get this. \n\nThe other items on their menu.. not too sure! \n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50) - I would pass on this. The serving size was super super tiny. I would say there was about a handful. It was a tad soggy, but still flavorful. \n\nKobe Sliders ($6.00) - This was okay too! Patty was tender, but pretty pricey for the amount you get. The sliders are comparable to the size of a macaroon or so!  \n\nOverall, this place is definitely on the pricey side, which is completely understandable.

What she received was a grilled rib eye steak with horse radish. I've never had a grilled prime rib before. Say what? Anyway, she said she will give it a try anyway. It was very salty and dry to a point where she could not eat it. That's correct. The waiter noticed she was not eating and asked if there was anything wrong. She stated the problem, and it was replaced with the cioppino. That was better. As for me I had the sea bass. It was a small entree, but it didn't mind, just as long as it was good, but that was not the case.  It was over cooked and dry. It was quite dissapointing.  I wanted to replace it with something else, but after 2 and a half bites It was already half way done (it was a small etree for $30. Not good value).  I felt i couldn't exchange it for anything else because returning another dish back to the kitchen would be too much coming from one  dinner party. In short, my wife left disappointed, and I left hungry with a fat bill that in no way substantiated what we ate. The food was bad, and on top of that pricey. Certainly this is only 1 of hundreds of opinions, but for a so called \"fine dining\" restaurant to have 3/5 stars. You decide.\n\nFor me, the failures here are too consistent. I would conclude that this place is only preying on the tourist from out of town, because there is absolutely no way they can get repeat clients from what I experienced. Would I come back?  My answer is a resounding NO.", "author": "Rock A."}

Other people were coming in and getting seated in the patio area even though our party of two and a party of 3 had been waiting for 15 min. I complained as did the other group and we both were told to just go see if there were any tables left ourselves. For being a fancier restaurant that is not acceptable by any means.

And funny enough - the SF restaurant week menu (which was then Dine About Town) was IDENTICAL! So I decided to try something off the prefix. We were seated with a beautiful view of the bay and had great service. In regards to the food. The clam chowder was very good. However, the mahi, sole, and salmon were all rather bland and unexciting. This is certainly a place you go for the view. For dessert, we tried the souffle and it was good, but small, and did not have any ice cream on the side. Overall, I had a nice time here but the food could do better.", "author": "Nikita K."}

Service was good, except for my comment below.  Food was good, though my sea bass was overcooked.  My husband enjoyed the seafood linguini, and my sister loved the cioppino.  \n\nMy main comment is about the wine list and pricing.  We love wine, and we love wine with seafood even more.  But this place expects you to down a bottle at a time if you want a decent wine.  Their sole choice of a wine by the glass if you wanted Chardonnay was a crappy Modavi selection.  No other choice, no half bottles, not even another choice that was overpriced by the glass.  It was a bottle or nothing. Really?  I can't drink a bottle by myself, my husband is diabetic and cant drink much, and my sister wanted another kind of wine.  Where is the logic in this?  I watched the whole glassed-in area while we were there, and not a single bottle of wine was sold . No one was ordering their whole bottles.  \n\nI just don't get it.  Have a few choices of wine by the glass that are decent.  Have some half-bottle selections so two people can share without getting soused. So charge me and let me decide if I want to overpay for wine for an evening I enjoy.   What is the goal here? To have your patrons appreciate a lovely meal accompanied by a nice wine, or to stubbornly insist that we pay $44 for a bottle of Kendall Jackson chardonnay that is way more alcohol than we want? I just don't see the logic behind this management decision.\n\nAnd the waiter's response when we complained about the situation?  \"I don't choose the wines\".", "author": "Jennifer A."}

I went here last week with my family. It was such a beautiful day that we opted to sit outside.. we were taken to a table with bird poop on the chairs and the ground.. not off  to a good start. The person who set us was extremely kind and apologetic and got us another table right away. We ordered calamari, a burger, and cioppino along with some drinks... the calamari was fabulous as were the drinks... we waited over 45 minutes to receive our food!! I guess the ticket was lost and the kitchen never got it... regardless with two kids under two we have a time limit before they start getting restless. At the 45 minute mark we cancel the order, enough is enough... we ask for our check which never came. 10 minutes after that we are still waiting for our check and they bring out our food. We were done 10 minutes ago!! I say we already cancelled the order so why is it here? We said we were leaving and the manager ( the guy who has been there 25 years) says he will comp us for the food. I guess it's cool that we got the food to go after waiting almost an hour to get it. I ended up eating it at home and the cioppino was the best that I have EVER had.. my husband's fries and burger were soggy and blah by the time we got home... he didn't eat it. 5 stars for the manager, calamari, and cioppino!!  It gets better because the Cioppino was so good my husband decides to take me there on Mother's day to give them a second try... I wanted a crabmeat benedict.. my favorite restaurant that makes it was overbooked... so, my husband called to ask if they could make it for us at Waterfront.. they said they could. We get there and we are ordering and they say they CAN'T make it!! I was like \"um, but my husband called and made sure!\" The waiter is extremely unpleasant and says well you can have something else. I DIDN't want anything else ! They say they can make me something.. finally. I say I will pay extra (thinking they would put crab meat on it). They bring me a crab cake benedict.. which was all bread crumbs and horribly bland with  a butter sauce/ not hollandaise! And then they charge me 2 meals!! One benedict price and one crab cake price... so, basically they charged me 20 bucks for an english muffin and two poached eggs. I only ate half because I was hungry it tasted like soggy bread with crab flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "I had to wait until after my Christmas holiday was fully over to write this review in order to keep our trip festive.\n\nWe had a party of 5 that had dinner here on Christmas night and yes, the view was amazing, the staff was attentive and pleasant and the food was delicious!!!  As you may know, Christmas night in San Francisco leaves few fine dining options and we had to power thru a few major hiccups at the Waterfront Restaurant to avoid leaving and searching for another option.  Here's a summary of our experience that led to this 1 star review:\n\n1. Due to limited options on Christmas night, we called several fine dining restaurants (that were closed) prior to a staff person at the Waterfront answering the phone and stating that they were open but the only seating was at the bar due to prior reservations for the evening.  Not to be dissuaded, we decided to stop in anyway and perhaps wait for a table to open.  Upon entry, we saw numerous open tables inside and 95% of the tables in the enclosed, heated, tented patio area were available also, perhaps due to chillier temperature in the areas not close to a heater.  After being informed that the open tables inside were already reserved, we chose to sit in the tented area.  The location that we chose initially was rather cold so we went back inside and asked what the wait time would be if we took a chance on waiting for a table and we were told by the Restaurant Manager Mustafa (as we stood looking at numerous open tables) that it would be at least an hour and in the most condescending tone that he could muster, he basically said you sit outside and deal with it or sit and wait.  If our dining options were not so limited on Christmas night, we would have left immediately but we found a fairly warm location in another area of the patio and had an outstanding dinner.  By the way, when we left, there were still numerous open tables on the interior of the restaurant.\n\n2.  Both of our families are business owners with employees and we understand the impact that poor management can have on customer service, employee moral and ultimately, the bottom line for the business.  As a business owner, I can honestly say that if a manager in my business communicated with customers in the manner that Mustafa communicated with us, he would be looking for employment elsewhere.  I read some of the other negative reviewed and would advise the business owner to take notice of what your customers are saying about your business and make some staffing changes.  We, the consumers have lots of dining options in San Francisco and I think Mustafa in particular has lost sight of that!!!!\n\nWe won't be back!", "author": "Ken S."}

Not sure if he had a bad day --just simply passing on the message to the manager that may want to provide some basic training to their waitstaff.   Surely there are many restaurants on the Embarcadero, so be mindful of how you treat your customers who dropped $80/for lunch ....as that money could go to many other businesses.", "author": "Linda N."}

The food is extremely overpriced for what your plate ends up with, the staff is horrible, and the only shinning aspect of the restaurant is that the bridge is in the background. I went to this restaurant for my 21st birthday, not only did they know it was a special even but they didn't treat it any different than a regular dinner, when we were there we had to wait more than an hour for our food and let me say the restaurant was not full at all, for what we ordered it shouldn't have taken more than an hour. Then at the bed and we received the bill not only did they not give me a complimentary dessert because it was my birthday but also because one guest canceled on me at the last minute they charged me a $25 \"seat charge\" because she was not in attendance. Let me remind you the restaurant was so empty and there was no need for it especially on someone's birthday.

I was really surprised at the big portion I received, as it is often from these types of restaurants to get a comfortable size portion, but I am not complaining. Beba enjoyed the Sea bass, I had a taste and liked the combination of components; however, it needed a little more flavoring in my opinion. \n\nLast but not least, we ended on a very nice note with the chocolate souffl\u00e9.

Right when we arrive, we are waiting on valet, after about 5 mins we call the restaurant & let them know we are outside in a white Audi waiting for valet, the hostess who answered said the valet guy was currently parking a car & will be there w us shortly...waiting...10 more mins pass, still no valet. We call again. She informs us that he will be there any minute. We turn around & a man who has been sitting in a corner the entire 15/20mins approaches our car window to park our car!! So unprofessional & we were not happy about waiting so long for valet when he was just sitting there, the entire time.\n\nAfter about 10 mins, we get seated (we made reservations which I recommend you do bec it was busy). Our table was near the window so we had a beautiful view for dinner. The location is one of the main reasons we chose The Waterfront for dinner & it was def beautiful esp when the bay bridge lights turned on. Once we were seated we were served a loaf of sour dough bread & butter & our server did a good job on making sure we were taken care of the entire night. I recommend the buttermilk fried calamari, rock shrimp, and fennel w spicy aioli for an appetizer! It was large enough to share w 5 people & delicious! We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese bec a lot of people recommended it on Yelp but out of 5 people, none of us really liked it. But if you're a fan of lobster, I'm sure you'd like it. I ordered the Penne Pasta w shrimp added ($4 per shrimp) - personally I thought that was a little weird bec I've never had to give a number of how many shrimps or chicken or steak I wanted added to a pasta. Nonetheless, it was fresh & pretty good. Nothing special in my opinion, but it was fulfilling- about half way through I was stuffed. As a dessert we ordered & shared the mini sampler- the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was a favorite for all of us as well as the walnut brownie. The other two- apple crisp & sticky toffee pudding were okay. \n\nOnce we were done, the server was kind enough to take photos of us & gave us our bill in an orderly fashion so that we could make it on time to our next activity for the night. Again, we had great service from our server which is why I was shocked to see all the bad reviews on poor service. Thankfully, the ending to our dining experience at the Waterfront was not as bad our start- we were able to retrieve our car fast from valet and make it on time to our next spot. \n\nIf it weren't for such poor valet service, I would have given 5 stars.

Why would a restaurant even have this still in service when clearly you cant use a highchair without that front bar even though there is a seatbelt?!?! I dont understand. Then, we were informed that the kitchen \"would be opening shortly\" AND on the table was a \"special menu\". The \"special menu\" that I was informed would not be there.

Has it gone downhill? Was it an off day? Were the real chefs on vacation? Don't know, but we might not be coming back.\n\nFirst of all, the menu was pretty limited. Normally, there's a nice little selection to choose from, such as fish options, scallops, etc. This time, it was pretty plebeian fare: chicken, salmon, prime rib, or lobster (okay, not pleb, but also not unique or special.)\n\nI would never go to a place like this for chicken, and fish would've been good -- but wasn't in the mood for a fish as \"fishy\" as salmon.\n\nWe got fried calamari appetizer, prime rib, lobster, and I got the \"lobster ravioli\" appetizer as a main course since none of the entrees appealed to me.\n\nI put that in quotes, because it didn't seem like lobster ravioli at all... the filling was pink, had the consistency of canned tuna, and tasted like fish. In other words, it seemed a lot more like salmon ravioli than lobster. I didn't want to complain or send it back because I rarely do that, it was Christmas, and there was nothing else I wanted on the (more limited than usual) menu. (Note: About 8 hours later, I also had some, uh, \"gastrointestinal distress\" ... could my fishy ravioli be the culprit?)\n\nMy wife got the whole lobster, so I figured if I wanted real lobster, I could just have some of hers, right? Well, it simply wasn't very good. It was poorly cooked (tail overcooked/chewy; other parts seemed a little undercooked), and it, too, had a little bit of \"fishy\" flavor. Lobster should not taste like that. So, it seemed both poorly prepared and not as fresh as it should have been (not expected at a pricetag of $52!) \n\nFather in law got the prime rib, and said it was decent, but that the biscuit that came with it was too dry.\n\nThe fried calamari appetizer was good (a little greasy, but fresh and tender), as was the creme brulee we shared for dessert. The two gin fizzes we ordered were okay, but not as good as ones ordered on previous visits.\n\nSo, all in all, a pretty lackluster meal, especially considering it was $265 for 3 people (2 entrees, 3 appetizers, 2 cocktails, and 1 dessert)\n\nI can't give this place one star, because the location/view/atmosphere is nice and the service has always been decent.

Ceviche is pretty light, citrusy, and really adds to the meal. The grilled prawns were juicy and tender. From the prix fixe menu, there is the smoked fish croquette, the seared Hawaiian ono comes with terragon peas and...a slice of disappointment. The peas are so crisp and buttery, and I could probably just order the peas as a side. Unfortunately, the bread on that dish was burnt and soaked in oil. At the end we ended up leaving the bread alone. The smoked fish croquette was deep fried goodness. The prix fixe ends with a chocolate pavlova. The raspberries, cream, and chocolate cream were amazing but the meringue did not. The prix fixe  menu does well for the price point.

I really wanted to eat at the waterfront because my husband and I love lobster Mac and cheese,a good happy hour and the view were all amazing on Yelp! So I got married in sf and wanted to have a nice dinner with my family who drove 5 hours.My dad who's from the area said he would call to make reservations , so he called 2 weeks in advance and talked to the owner who said they don't take reservations,Which is no problem my dad just wanted to give them a heads up since it was a large party and wanted us to be able to sit in the patio area. The owner was so nice and insisting it wouldn't be a problem. So Wednesday (may 3rd) comes, our party arrives around 2:30 they get seated and order drinks . My husband and I arrive , and were asked if we'd like to order drinks and I wanted to order drinks off the happy hour menu and was told we couldn't order drinks or anything off of happy hour . No explanation . We ordered a Shirley temple for my 6yo son and was told we couldn't have a Shirley temple because my dad had already ordered a shot glass full of cherries for his coke .... I've never had a problem ordering cherries from a restaurant? But okay. I thought he was joking but he came back with a sprite in hand. At this time I was still wondering why he was being so rude to our entire table. Maybe it wasn't his day , but then I asked him one more time about the happy hour and he said we could not order anything off the happy hour menu because we were seated outside . I understand most restaurants  have happy hour in a specific part of the restaurant but for a large party and a special occasion making an exception would've been nice. His attitude just continued to go down hill , he was so rude and arrogant to every body at the table. He was blatantly disrespectful to my nephew who has a speech problem and he didn't bother to make him feel comfortable when ordering.My money is just as good as everyone else's . He made everyone feel so uncomfortable . I guess at really nice restaurants In the city it really doesn't matter if your'e friendly or not since your going to get a nice tip anyways since the gratuity is added! So lucky for him his shitty attitude didn't effect his tip! Just think about how much bigger your tip would've been if you'd smiled , let us order some sliders and onion rings and drinks off the happy hour menu or just friendly. So I can say this was by far the WORST experience on one of the BEST days of my life !  Thanks waterfront !  P.s just want to let you know you have a. African American young male server , who walks around with a huge smile on his face so friendly. Maybe you should hire more waiters like this and not old and grumpy men !", "author": "Chantez W."}

When we seated at our table we ordered ice tea and orange juice to drink plus pizza - steak and caesar salad. Orange juice never came.\n\nWe had few bites of our salad and with big surprise we found a roach in our salad. We called the waiter right away but he did not apologize for it and offered us to order something else. We asked to talk with the manager and she apologized giving us the option to cancel our order (?!?).\n\nWe decided to try the pizza anyway but every bites we were looking what was in there... For a restaurant of this level this is unacceptable and customer service non-existent!!! For sure will never come back here and will not recommend...\n\nBe careful if you plan to come here for lunch or dinner and definitely look what's in your salad.\n\n-------\nTo answer the management: we were there on Saturday September 5th from 2.30pm to 3.30pm.\n\nRoach in the salad is unacceptable and it should never happened and a better customer service to save the situation it would have helped!!!!", "author": "Cristina R."}

We were off to a great start.\n\nWe arrived early and notified the staff that we would be waiting at the bar. They told me they would be making some adjustments to make things work. Their happy hour menu was quite good. I highly recommend the oysters, of course. Followed by the delicious truffle parmesan fries and wash it down with one of their well drinks which are also on special from 5-7pm daily. Our bartender was extremely attentive and the oysters on the half shell were great appetizers.\n\nAll of the guests in our party arrived and they were able to accomodate the changes that I requested. We were seated by the window and it had a spectacular view of the San Francisco Bay and the Bay Bridge. I was very impressed.\n\nEveryone was here for the Dine About Town dinner so I started off with the soup. I want to point out the sample menu was different than what was listed on the website. The clam chowder was better than most places and the most notable thing about it was the large pieces of clams in the soup. For the main course I ordered the hanger steak, cooked medium rare. It was well seasoned and cooked right as expected. The fries again were quite good.

The sea bass was really good and the asparagus was cooked perfectly. The scallops were also great along with the prawns - which is why I'm giving two stars.

The staff is dressed well and had great manners.\n\nFood: things we had\n-crab cakes: great but you only get 2\n-calamari: this was a mixed bag. They fried the lemon which i thought was a dumb idea; the shrimp was not of high quality but the squid was really quite good.\n-scallops: these were absolutely delicious. Probably the best thing on the menu.\n-sole: a solid dish but its not my thing personally \n-seafood linguini: the seafood is good and the sauce is okay (good for bread dipping). However, i found it pretty insulting that they \"hand made pasta\" and then served it cooked WAY past al dente. To be frank, ive had instant pasta cooked better.\n-skuna salmon: definitely the lamest dish we had. Without a side dish its simply not an entre (so its basically a $40 dish once the side is factored in) and was just a fillet of grilled salmon seasoned with a bit of salt and a small salad. The quality was good but not at that price.\n-desserts (peach/blackberry tart, sticky toffee pudding and the chocolate souffl\u00e9) all were pretty good with the exception of the toffee pudding which was more like toffee cake (not sticky or much of a pudding and not enough sauce).\n\n-drinks: were all pretty good. Perhaps a LITTLE bit on the weak side for some but i was fine with it.\n\n-final thoughts: i would only recommend this place to impress someone (for dates, clients and maybe birthdays). If you want amazing food food or good value for money i would simply advise you to go elsewhere.

The accompanying serrano chili oil did nothing for me though. For the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer ($14), they used buttermilk which held on to the frying oil. Heavy.

The grilled snake river farms 12 oz American wagyu new york strip ($39) with a side of lobster mac and cheese ($12). The steak was a perfect medium rare with a solid char. I didn't ask if it had been aged but it tasted like it. I thought about giving Waterfront 4 stars because I loved the steak but it's more of a testament of Waterfront NOT messing up the steak and just letting the Snake River wagyu speak for itself.

I picked Waterfront this year because of the location, the view and the good things I'd heard about this restaurant.  I planned to propose to my girlfriend outside the restaurant before dinner, right on the water with the beautiful bay bridge all lit up in the background.  So...I called the restaurant a few days before Christmas to request the best table they could offer, I even explained the situation about proposing that night, and the person answering the phone straight up said \"No, we don't do that here. Is there anything else you need?\"  I feel that the gentleman I spoke to was extremely rude in his response and I feel that in the hospitality industry, they should do everything they can to make your entire experience positive, especially such a big event.  Next, I asked this man if I could order a bottle of champagne/sparkling wine in advance to have ready at the table when we arrived.  He was helpful with this request and immediately recommended the most expensive bottle they had.  I decided on a bottle to have ready at the table and the call ended.  So fast forward to Christmas night; we get to the city, park the car, walk over to the water, I get down on one knee, she says yes!, take a few selfies and then go in to the restaurant for dinner. \n\nFirst of all, they seat us, they don't even offer a seat outside on the patio because we're told that it's cold outside (even though there are other people eating out there).  Why don't they have heaters out there??  Oh well... Next, we're seated and no champagne in sight.  After we're seated they even come over to confirm my name on the reservation, I thought the champagne would follow shortly.  NOPE!  No champagne, no mention.  So I decided just to forget it and move on.  \n\nThe food was good, extremely overpriced but that is definitely expected especially on Christmas.  Crab cake, good.  Crab Bisque, pretty good. Spinach salad, good.  Prime rib, good flavor but overcooked, as though it had been sliced before dinner service and then heated up which led to it drying out and definitely not rare/medium rare.  My fiancee and I agreed that the best thing we had was the cheddar biscuit that came with the prime rib.  That definitely should not be the case.  The service was decent, although, I feel like our waiter was not very attentive and disappeared at different times throughout our time there.  Finally, I was a bit bothered having seen members of the waitstaff on their phones while on the restaurant floor.  \n\nOverall, not the engagement experience I had hoped for at the restaurant but we'll always be able to share the view from along the water, OUTSIDE the restaurant, and I guess you can't count on other people, especially the staff at Waterfront, to make your special night a bit more special.", "author": "Matt K."}

The one salad came out, and we waited at least another 15 minutes for three of the entrees to come out.  The fourth took another 15 minutes, so all our entrees were cold by the time the final one showed up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "So part of me wanted to give this place a 1-Star review, but that would be unfair. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I took a friend who had just arrived in town to Waterfront Restaurant so that she and I could enjoy a nice meal, and a bottle of wine on the bay. From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left, the service was uneven. Granted, we arrived at the blue-hair dinner hour of 4pm, so I can understand if there was a break in shifts from their better staff. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of white wine, oysters on the halfshell, the beet salad, seafood pasta, and swordfish.\n\nOverall, the service was attentive, and courteous. The oyster shucker could use some serious practice. There were several broken shell pieces in my oysters, and the flesh of the oyster was not separated from the shell. This made for an awkward dance in attempting to elegantly eat one of my favorite bivalve mollusks. \n\nThe beet salad was good, but if they had screwed up this very basic salad, I would have dropped them down to one-star. My friend enjoyed her seafood pasta, but given how everything else tasted in my mouth, I just didn't even want to bother presenting my palate for another disappointment. \n\nI'm a diehard swordfish fan. Whenever I see it on the menu, I usually order it. 9 times out of 10. I've had swordfish at some of the finest restaurants around the world, and some of the best hole-in-the-walls. Sadly, the swordfish I had at Waterfront Restaurant was the worst preparation I've ever been served. And that's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe swordfish was woefully undercooked. Yes, some fish can be cooked, or even just seared, and that works perfect. However, with swordfish, and the nature of the texture of the meat, it requires a delicate and thorough cooking in order to leave a flaky, falling apart swordfish steak. When I first dug my knife and fork into this piece, I had difficulty cutting the meat, and the still cold tendons made my job even harder. This led me to do something I have not done in over 15 years: I sent the plate back. I simply asked for a properly cooked swordfish steak. \n\nThe server was gracious, and returned minutes later with another piece of swordfish. However, this piece of fish was COOKED EVEN LESS than my previous plate. I simply did not touch the food. I didn't ask for a refund, or to have the item removed from my bill. That's tacky. But, it prompted me to make mental notes for this review. \n\nBottom line: Avoid this restaurant at all costs. They need new management, more refined decor, more comfortable seating on the patio, and a completely new kitchen staff. There are literally hundreds of better seafood restaurants in San Francisco that offer better food with less compromises. \n\n[NOTE: Upon review of my bank statement to see what the charge was for the meal, and I couldn't find it. My guess is the restaurant removed the charge after the fact. While I do appreciate that, I think they should have communicated that to me at the time.]", "author": "Justin S."}

We were asked to sit for a few minutes then were led straight to our table out on the covered pier. Our table faced the gorgeously lit up Bay Bridge and the financial district over the water. The views alone make this place worth it.\n\nThis was the first time I've ever been faced with two different knives and two different forks on either side of my plate and not known which goes with what. Lucky for means other uncultured swine, the waiters know and take away the unnecessary cutlery as the courses go by.\n\nEveryone gets a choice of tap or bottled water, then the drink orders go out. As you're sipping on your wine out comes some tasty sourdough bread slices and butter. The soup and salads, if you decided to spend the extra $10 on one of those. And finally outcomes the main course. I had the vegetable linguini, which was delicious! Everyone else at my table chose sea bass or salmon and enjoyed their's as well. Though everything on their menu was at least $20+ and designed on their plates in such a way that are pretty and a tad on the smaller side that fancy places seem to like so much, I was comfortably full.\n\nA special dessert menu is brought once the plates are cleared, coffee is offered, and drinks are constantly refilled without even needing to track down your waiter (who I must mention had a stereotypically French accent). The chocolate cake sounded too good to pass up, so I stuffed my face with it. It was perhaps THE best, most chocolatey thing I've ever eaten. At $9 a pop, the chocoholic in me was more than happy to pay.\n\nOutside the covered pier is a walkway where you can take beautiful pictures of the bridge and the surrounding city, whether you're a tourist or not, it's a view worth checking out.", "author": "Emily G."}

Arrived about fifteen min early, greeted warmly by host and seated quickly to an upstairs window table with wonderful view. SO far so good. Took some time for waiter to approach and ask for our cocktail order. He did not introduce himself, which is customary, but not a huge deal. Food and drink servers very prompt and friendly. \nLobster Risotto is wonderful, as is the pancetta wrapped gulf prawn appetizers... however when the appetizers were delivered our entree order was not taken which we found odd. \nFor the price paid the waiter was nowhere near as attentive with service as he should have been. We enjoyed the view and the quiet ambiance but service is what keeps customers coming back. We had finished eating our appetizer courses and had to request more bread before our entree order was even taken. No check back on us during appetizer course by the waiter , this would have solved this and allowed for refresh on drink order as well. We both had the mixed seafood grill entree and the crab mashed potatoes on the side. The scallops were to die for, the lobster tails a bit dry but overall the crab mashed potatoes stole the show. We dine out weekly in the bay area and would only recommend Waterfront for the saving grace which is the food... and was wonderfully delicious. Would have loved dessert but did not want to wait again for service so just had a cappuccino and paid the bill.

My friend actually beat us there and she told to wait at the bar. Once we arrived she had already had an issue the one of the bartenders and she was upset! Apparently the older guy didn't make her drink to her liking and when she told him he ignored her and argued with her. The younger bartender stepped in and made her the drink after she asked for a manager! Once I sat at the bar I ordered my sister ordered the younger bartender made our drinks and my boyfriend tried to order with the older one (he was totally dismissed) he was asked for ID as he was pulling out the ID the bartender walked away! Eventually he came back and took his order, gave him his drink. Then told us your table is ready you need to cash out! Huh?!? \"Can't u just send it to our table no cash out now\"! So my sister said can u split the bill everybody will pay for their own drinks except the birthday girl.So when she went to pay for hers and my drink he said \"I thought u said split all the checks!\" With such a nasty demeanor.  She said \"I'm paying for my sisters it's her birthday, I tried to tell you that sir\" He was so rude and just treated us like we were nobody let me say we are all professional working ppl..

My previous experiences at this restaurant have been good but I will not go back or recommend them after the horrible customer service I encountered from the management.\n\nI called on April 25th and made a reservation for Wednesday, May 24th at \n7:00pm for 12 people for my daughter's college graduation celebration.  The \nyoung woman that assisted me took all of the information, including my \ncredit card, telephone number, and email address and then emailed me a form \nto complete. The email came from \"Al Falchi\" at \nwaterfrontsanfrancisco@yahoo.com.  I completed the form and emailed it back \non April 26th and requested an acknowledgement that it had been received.  I \nnever heard back so I emailed the form a second time on May 1st and \nrequested an acknowledgement that my reservation was confirmed.  Once again, \nno reply. I called the restaurant directly yesterday, May 5th, and Brooke \nassisted me.  She was very apologetic and said there was no record of my \nreservation. She said she did not have access to the email inbox to access \nthe form I had sent but the owner, Al Falchi, did and she would check with \nhim and get back to me.  As the email below from Brooke states, my emails \nwere not found and I needed to send the completed form again. As I was \nreading the email, I received a phone call from Brooke. She stated the \nreason my reservation was never confirmed was because she had just found out \nfrom her manager that the entire restaurant had been reserved for that date. \nAs a consumer, I have to ask, why was my reservation taken at all if the \nrestaurant was already booked? Why didn't I receive any responses to my \nemails? Why wasn't the hostess aware the restaurant was booked solid and \ncontinuing to try to take and confirm my reservation? All of my information \nwas taken on April 25th so why didn't anyone attempt to contact me and \nlet me know an error had been made and the restaurant was not available? \nHaving worked in the hospitality industry for many years, this is a direct \nreflection on the quality of the management.\n\nI thought it was cowardly to have Brooke be the one to give me the bad news \nwhen it was the owner and management that caused this problem by not \nadequately communicating with their staff or following up with a customer. \nFor that reason, I didn't express my anger to Brooke as she was just the \nmessenger. A quality manager would have called me directly, explained the \nsituation, and would have tried to salvage the relationship as to keep me as \na future customer. The potential fall out from this, is that if I hadn't \nbeen diligent and assumed all was well, there is a good possibility that \ntwelve of us would have shown up on May 24th and been turned away. My piddly \nlittle party of 12 is certainly insignificant in comparison to someone \nbooking the entire restaurant, but in my little world, this is an important \nevent and we had chosen this restaurant, out of many, to celebrate. I won't \nmake that mistake again.\n\nThis email will probably go into the depths of the unknown like my others, \nbut I wanted to put in writing my utter disappointment with how this was \nhandled.\n\nMaybe now that this is on Yelp, it will actually get the attention of management.", "author": "Kami B."}

This elegant restaurant provides great service along with delicious food. My favorite is the clam chowder with smoked applewood bacon. I am pretty picky about my chowder and this by far is my favorite I've ever had. It was creamy yet flavorful. The clams weren't fishy or incredibly  chewy. There was just a hint if bacon that added that something special to the dish. I also ordered a Kentucky Lemonade for $11. Sure it might seem pricey but the amount of alcohol and taste make up for it. Of course while waiting for my chowder I had bread and better and let me tell you this was some of the best tasting better I've had at a restaurant. It may seem trivial, but I couldn't get enough of it. \n\nI like to sit at the bar since all I wanted was a bowl of chowder and a quick relaxing lunch. The bar area has one tv for those sports fans that walk in, but this is in no way a sports bar. White table clothes and suited up waiters prove this point. They have both indoor and outdoor seating for those warm sunny days and small but clean bathrooms. I will be returning for a visit again sometime soon.", "author": "Melia J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "This review is specifically for the owner Cheryl who I had the displeasure of working with while trying to coordinate a company dinner. I at first thought she was a snotty event coordinator or sales manager but unfortunately she was a super snotty and customer service unfriendly owner.\n\nI booked a reservation for 12 people and asked if I could create a custom menu for our team based off of their menu (in other words, minimize the selections so we could keep costs down). She advised that they had a group menu we could use for the event and I advised that on the website, it clearly stated for 50+ people. She said no, we would need to use the menu for our group as well. (personally this makes no sense to me since 12 people is not that terribly large of a group). I conceded and proceeded with the prix fixe menu. Two days prior to our event, I gave her a final headcount of 6 people and asked that she just switch our reservation to a normal reservation and we would select off menu. She replied with \"your reservation has been cancelled.\" \n\nBecause I was concerned that she just completely cancelled our reservation, I called the main restaurant and booked the reservation with the hostess.\n\nWhen my team went to dinner two days later, they were told that they were to use the prix fixe menu as the food had already been cooked. THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP as the prix fixe menu had options so unless they cooked everything on the menu and had it sitting prepared and dying in the window,  this was a lie. Also, when I had rebooked the reservation with the hostess, I had not mentioned the prix fixe menu.\n\nWhat's sad is that while the food can be good, and the location can be great, the service and the people are what bring the customers coming. I work for a company of over 200 people and a dealer base of over 1500; we coordinate dinners and events all over the country for our employees and dealers and this would have been an excellent opportunity to confirm another great location for our future events. Sadly this will never be the case. \n\nWhile I can't vouch for the food or floor staff, I can say that Cheryl is a horrible representative for her own business. What scares me though is that since she's the owner, my guess is her apathy towards her own customers and lack of acknowledgement of what further business they could bring may very well be passed down into the culture of her company and her employees and for this I cannot recommend Waterfront Restaurant.", "author": "JoLynne C."}

We ordered two specialty drinks and two bowls of chowder. With the drinks came a basket of yummy sourdough bread and butter.  You really can't beat SF sourdough.  But the highlight was the chowder.

The location of this restaurant cannot be beat! With views overlooking the bay and the bridge, I can certainly see why they try to get away with the prices they charge - but sadly - the food does not do justice to the view.\n\nI had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were under ripe, and I question whether or not they were actually heirloom tomatoes. It had a small - very small - amount of delicious buratta cheese on top - and get this - wait for it - fried onions (like those you get in a can for green bean casserole for Thanksgiving dinner). I believe there was one small piece of wilted basil as well. VERY disappointing.\n\nI had the Wagu beef steak with arugula as my entree (entrees are served a la carte - and from what I hear - the lobster mac and cheese is a good side dish option). The pile of plain, fresh from the bag arugula went untouched (why even bother putting it on the plate? i would call it an expensive garnish). The steak was mediocre, and heavily salted. It came with a sweet dipping sauce to cover the poor preparation. Avoid it. \n\nOther items at the table that got equally poor reviews ; clam chowder (sweet and too rich), Choppino (full of salmon and pretty much nothing else). Our waiter was loud, bizarre, and condescending. It felt like family night at a fancy retirement home. I will not be coming back here again.", "author": "Katie G."}

Was hoping it wasn't too touristy and it wasn't at all. Perhaps it was due to the time we got there. Came around 4pm and it was completely empty which was nice. I love that this place is open all day instead of shutting down and then reopening at 5:30 like so many SF restaurants do (some us are hungry for dinner before 5:30 folks).  \n\nWe were seated on the enclosed patio without even having to ask. The weather and views were lovely. We started off with the calamari and crab cakes. The crab cakes were full of crab and very flavorful. The meyer lemon aioli with the crab cakes was a little too much mayo and not enough lemon however the flavor of the crab cakes stood on its own so it didn't need the aioli at all. The calamari was perfectly cooked and had a nice dipping sauce on the side. Great portion size and perfect for sharing. Enough for 4 hungry ppl and still had some left over. I did find it to be a little on the salty side so if you're sensitive to sodium (like me), you may want to pass. \n\nI ordered a mixed green salad which was simple but fresh and great flavor. The vinaigrette was bright and was just enough to flavor the salad without being overpowered. I ordered the handmade seafood linguine and it was amazing. Full of fresh crab, rock shrimp, clam and mussels. The cream sauce was very light and perfectly seasoned. I finished the entire bowl without intending to but couldn't help it. I would definitely order that again. There are a lot of great choices on their menu so it was hard to choose but a pasta dish with everything? Can't go wrong. I will be back to try some of their other dishes (might get the pasta to go though!). \n\nWould've loved to have one of their desserts as their selection was really good (strawberry rhubarb, sticky toffee and brownie all sounded amazing) but was much too full to go there.

On the other hand, overall service was unexpectedly subpar, far outweighing the quality of the sandwich. We were led to a table set up for 6, but our reservation was for 7. While easy to address, our server, who seemed grumpy for the whole time, apparently failed to pay attention to the some very basic things. He neglected to provide eating utensils for the 7th person until after bread had been individually served to 6 of us by kitchen staff. Then he neglected to (ask his kitchen staff to) serve the additional bread after casually transferring utensils that had already been properly set up from an adjacent table. Another person came and served ice water, but only for 5 of us because his jar ran empty, but he never returned with more water. Meanwhile, our server had forgotten something else yet again: glass for the 7th person. This wouldn't have been an issue, only that it was the afternoon of the hottest summer day of the year here in SF while we sat with sweat running down our face and back in an enclosed tent without ventilation! Our server hurried us to order food with an impatient and impolite attitude, as if we weren't welcomed. It's the \"hurry up and don't waste my time, I don't feel like serving you\" kind of attitude.

Escolar is a type of mackerel that cannot metabolize wax esters, which are similar to castor oil. Anyone know what happens when you ingest castor oil? Consumption of escolar causes explosive, oily, orange diarrhea. People who are affected by this often have accidents because it comes on so suddenly and explosively. The Japanese and Italian governments have banned the importation and sale of escolar for these reasons. Luckily for my boyfriend, we were back at our hotel by the time he was hit - but poor guy was up all night :(. \n\nOtherwise, the rest of our party had fairly tasty meals - I just think its a poor decision on the part of a restaurant to offer such a dangerous fish and OVER the recommended 6 ounce portion.

We came by for a drink on the patio over the weekend with friends and had an almost-okay experience.\n\nAt first, things were a little weird.  We came in and the hostess greeted us.  We said we were just there for drinks.  She seemed to not really listen to us and we were guided into the dining room and handed menus.  My husband said \"all this just for drinks?\" and the hostess was all, \"Oh, if you just want drinks you can't sit in the dining room.\"  Uhh, no shit.  So we had to wait for her to figure something out (calculus in her head, maybe?) and then she finally seated us on the patio.\n\nOur waiter wasn't much better.  He forgot to bring one of our drinks with the first round, so we had to wait like a year for him to come back so we could tell him.  Then we got charged double for it on the check and had to have him take the second nonexistent drink off the bill.  What, is everyone here on Ambien or something?\n\nWe ordered a round of snacks -- parmesan truffle fries for one of us and oysters for me and my BFF to share.  The truffle fries were $5 for a teensy little serving....but it came with the cutest, wee ketchup bottle ever so that seems legit to me. ;D  The oysters were $1 each for happy hour, but they were teensier than the little baby ketchup so I'm not convinced they're worth it.  I sure as hell wouldn't order them here at regular price.\n\nDrinks were good, the view of the bay from the patio was nice, and the people-watching along the Embarcadero sidewalk was amusing.  Service was pretty crappy but then again, when the majority of your clientele is tourist traffic, it's not like you have to work your ass off to impress people and angle for return customers. \n\nThe dinner menu looks good, but I'd be reluctant to come back due to the mediocre experience we had.

A few years ago we did Thanksgiving at Epic (same view) and it was wonderful, but they were closed this year. \n\nThe service was terrible (1/5). We weren't even sure who our waiter was for the first 20 minutes we were sitting there. We brought our own bottle of wine with us and our server was more than okay with opening and pouring it but did not inform us of the $30 corking fee. Most places do this, so it was fine, but at least let us know so it isn't a surprise when you get the bill. Our server never greeted us, told us his name, happy thanksgiving... nothing. Just \"are you ready\". The thanksgiving menu was small and looked good, but they would not allow substitutions at all. We had to beg to get a side of stuffing. \n\nWe all ate the turkey plate they offered which came with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and a cranberry sauce. Overall it was okay (3/5). Nothing special... but not terrible. We would have been fine with the overall experience if the food was the same and the service was great, but since the service was so poor it was hard to say we enjoyed it. We also were not sat by a window even after asking to be, and tables remained open by the window the entire time we were there. The lighting was very dark, we noticed another table next to us didn't have a light over them at all so they were essentially eating in the dark! Our table was also very cramped so the overall ambiance was worse than imagined as well (2/5). \n\nThe best part about the experience was the bottle of wine... but that is because WE brought it!

Once was for happy hour with the girls, and another time was with a group from work. I LOVE the location of the restaurant. You can't beat the view! \n\nHappy Hour:\nMoscow Mules for HH? Yes please! This was my first time trying this drink after having my eye on it for a while. The ginger beer cocktail was delicious! Not too sweet with a good kick. We also got some of their $1 oysters. The oysters were fresh and had almost a sweet water flavor. Definitely worth it!\n\nMy only complaint about the HH is the limited amount of space available at the bar. A group of 6 of us had to stand because there were no seats available. All the outside seating was fully too!\n\nLunch:\nWe started with an ahi ceviche with a pineapple salsa. The ahi was a little chewy but the flavor was great. It was paired with a savory pan fried plantain that complemented the ceviche nicely. \n\nFor my meal, I got the fried soft shell crab. It came with an avocado crouton salad drizzled with a champagne vinaigrette. I love crab, but have never had a soft shell. Let me just say if I could have licked the plate clean, I would have. The crab was perfectly fried and crisp with just the right amount of seasoning. The salad was buttery and added a different crunch to the meal. \n\nDessert consisted of the lemon souffle. A pillowy cloud of lemony heaven with a rich custard inside. It came with lavender shortbread cookies which in my opinion, had just a little too much lavender. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed both experiences here. I will most likely be back for HH, little too pricey for a meal.", "author": "Olivia B."}

My experience here was not pleasant.  \nBut I'll start with the good\n\nThe whiskey sour was made well, I ordered two and it's just how I make them at home (bartender for two years)\nBread was wonderful, tasted fresh, and warm.  \nAnd the view absolutely fabulous. What a location, and a very nice looking dining room.\n\nHaving worked in food service before here is what I found difficult to swallow about waterfront restaurant. \nFirst the service\nHalf of our party arrived at ~715 was greeted promptly and placed at our table and we're able to order drinks, good drinks.  The other half arrived a 10 minutes later and they too were greeted well and were able to order their drinks promptly. So now with drinks in hand we're talking about the menu we're ready to order and it's impossible to get our waiter. I happen to be in a great seat to observe the whole restaurant, I notice our waiter passing by a few different times but always in such a rush that he doesn't look around to us trying to get his attention. It almost takes a half hour before able to order. We had finished our drinks before were you able to order. We were not given bread until after we had ordered.  Now if the restaurant was packed this would be completely understandable however the restaurant was half packed and half empty and you should have to wait half hour to order.  \n\nThe food \nI'm going to give the positive and negative about the food. You're a party of 6 three of us ordered for appetizers the clam chowder two of us ordered Caesar salad I found the clam chowder to be excessive with cream and to be lacking in clams. One of the other souo eaters agreed with me while the other thought the soup was fantastic. Both Caesar salad people thought the Caesar was fair and that the lettuce tasted old.  \nFor the main course we had the crab beat salad, a bowl of risotto, escolar, the handmade linguini, and the fresh fish of the day. Those who had the salad found it nice and the one who had the linguini loved it both fish eaters however we're not enamored with the taste of the fish and as the risotto eater I've never had a worse risotto. If the restaurant didn't have such a pledge towards local and fresh food I would have sworn the risotto lobster was frozen, and so overloaded with lemon juice in order to mask the lobsters shortcomings.\nAt the end of the meal we sat waving around a credit card trying to get our waiters attention so we could leave\nAll in all the food was fine, it was ok, not great.

It was more than 5 minutes into the discussion before he apologized, and that was after I pointed out that we had not yet received an apology. \n\nWe're reasonable people and understand that accidents happen. We had a circular conversation for over 10 minutes (I'm sure this disturbed other diners, but what did he care?) with someone who has blatant disregard for customer service and not an iota of people skills (rude, condescending and hostile is the extent of his abilities).

My friend called over 48 hours as the contract says to change the reservation. She talked to a woman named Laura about it. When we finished dinner and wanted to pay he added on 8 people for no shows to pay for. We asked to talk to him and he was so rude and unprofessional about the whole situation. He was literally in front of my friends face. Just because our party was full of women didn't mean that he should talk down on us and think of us as inferior. We have the money to pay that wasn't the problem. The problem was that he has communication issues. We had proof as well that we changed the reservation. I personally would never go there again. It's supposed to be all about customer service but as the floor manager he failed. It's sad that his employees had to apologize on his behalf.", "author": "Patricia T."}

It feels like the ideal picturesque San Fran evening. The bridge lit up at night, the sound of the Bay lapping in the distance, and the constant breeze blowing the sea scents through the air. \n\nAll of this ocean indulgence made me really hungry for some of the ocean's finest, natch, so I conned my colleagues into squirreling away their entire daily meal allowance for a seafood feast at Waterfront. I'm a bully like that. But it is always for everyone's best interest. Most of the time. Definitely some of the time. Okay I'm a bully for purely selfish reasons. But this tryst through The Embarcadero was honestly in everyone's best interest, not just mine. \n\nBut I digress. I wanted lobsta and shrimp and scallops and every other creature of the sea I could get my mitts on. And I found it all at Waterfront. Succulent crustacean heaven, I tell you. Served with grilled lemon halves and sides of your choosing, Waterfront quenched my seafood cravings with aplomb. Our server was a peach, and did a really nice job of recommending the driest white wine in the house. She seemed a little miffed when our party of 10 had to use 10 credit cards to pay (corporate life, what are ya gonna do?) but she was still a doll and split up the check a zillion times for us. \n\nMy only qualm with Waterfront was the layout. It's just awkward. If they cleared out all the tables and chairs, it'd be a great multi-layered stage for a pop singer to sprinkle her backup dancers on. I didn't see the point of having raised platforms every so often for some tables. But hey, it was nice looking down on the peasants while munching on Sebastian & Friends.", "author": "Sarah V."}

I did not have any entrees, as it was hor dourves all night long, but the only thing that stood out for me was the lobster mac and cheese (but as a mac n cheese lover, this is hardly ever wrong in my book) that came in shot glasses and the crab cake which is pretty standard everywhere. They had a couple stations, and I started off with the raw oysters and they had huge shrimps! they also had a sushi station and grabbed some sliced tuna with sauce as well. The oysters were majorly dissapointing. Being in SF, you expect it to be fresh and great. But since they were pre-shucked, they were majorly dry. The sushi, the fish just did not taste fresh, and I wonder if it's because it may have sat out for a bit, and quite flavorless. They had a slider station as well, and the meat was as dry as can be. Fail. \n\nService was great, waiters were constantly coming by and offering the hor dourves, as well as glasses of champagne and mojitos. Props to them, as the place was packed with hundreds of people in the packed space downstairs. The chicken skewers with peanut sauce came around the most and I nibbled on one, it was alright. Bruschetta had cilantro, yuck! who puts cilantro in brushcetta?! Was there a basil shortage? There was another thing I tried that was not good as well but cannot remember what was inside. Cheese quesadilla was standard. On the second floor, there was another slider station and cheese and fruits table. No thanks. \n\nThe very top floor had a live band playing, so it was quite loud to chat, although this was the least crowded floor. Here, was an assortment of desserts. I was happy to see the fruit tarts, but they were just okay, which is hard to mess up. The chocolate covered chocolate cheesecake was too rich for me, but the creme brulee was excellent.\n\nThe bartenders were a bit rude, and the shot glasses are TINY. maybe 1/3 of a shot that you'd get elsewhere.

The view was amazing and the menu looked great. We were quickly seated on the patio. A few minutes later a man comes up to us and says he will be with us shortly. A few more minutes later a different man comes up and takes our drink order. We order two waters and a coke. The drinks come, we tell him we are ready. He says he will be right back, which is fine. We order. We both get two kobe cheeseburgers and my boyfriend gets the lobster mac n cheese. I ask for the lettuce, tomato, & onion on the side. Our server asked \"what about the cheese?\" I told him that I wanted that on the burger. \n\nEveryone around us is getting bread, except us. I have to flag down a buss boy and ask if we can have some bread... Strange... Finally someone else brings us our food later and my cheese isn't on the burger. The block of cheese is on the side, so I have to flag down our server and ask for them to melt the cheese on the beef... Finally it comes back out. We cut into our burgers and they were both medium-well. I ordered medium and my boyfriend ordered medium-rare. We were so hungry that we didn't say anything. Besides the burgers being over cooked, they were okay. I've had better, I've had worse. The one delicious thing was the bacon truffle aioli. I loved it! \n\nOur server never once checked on us. We had to flag everyone down for anything we needed.  And it wasn't even that busy. Had to ask for my boyfriend's refill both times. Each time my boyfriend would finish his coke (an 8oz glass) we would line them up to see how long it would take someone to come buss our table. We had three empty coke glasses lined up before they came over. We also sat with our dirty plates in front of us for a good 10 minutes. I pushed them away and stacked them to see if someone would get the hint. Finally they came over and bussed our table. We also had to flag down our server and ask for the bill. Was it his first day??? And when we looked at our bill we got a pleasant surprise! (sarcasm) $10.50 for three cokes. I have NEVER been to a restaurant where you don't get free refills on soft drinks. And if this were the case, we should have been told about it beforehand. No wonder we weren't offered refills. $3.50 for an 8oz glass. Lol what a joke!\n\nAt this point, we had enough. I did mention this to my server. Walked up to him cause God knows we would never see him again if I didn't. He said \"Sorry about that, I should have told you before...\" Yeah! You should have. And you should have fixed this. Needless to say, he got a $2 tip on our $60 something bill. And the only reason he got a tip is because my boyfriend felt kind of bad. And thought it might be this guy's first day. I told him not to leave a penny. I am a server and he is a chef. The entire meal experience was unacceptable. When leaving, I wanted so badly to warn the people coming in to stay away. However, my manners got the best of me. Will never return or recommend everyone here.

I recently went to the Waterfront on a Tuesday evening with my fiance and we had a lovely time! We were in the city doing errands and thought that we should have a nice meal before returning to Walnut Creek in order to miss traffic. \nUpon arrival to the restaurant, I felt slightly bad because the vibe of the place is upscale, and we were both wearing jeans and casual tops. The crowd was mixed, though, with those just getting off from work and others that were more casually dressed. \nWe were seated immediately, and were led outside to the covered patio and had an excellent view of the water. We waited a bit, and were given water and our waiter introduced himself. He did come off as a bit stuffy, but our waiter did a great job. We decided to take him up on an appetizer special, each ordered the seafood linguine, and I ordered a lemon drop martini. Let me just say that I am the type that loves a good \"girly\" cocktail, and this was hands-down the best lemon drop that I have ever had! I was raving about it!\nSo, while sipping my delicious drink and enjoying the view, we were each given a piece of very tasty foccacia bread. The bread was good, but I had wished we were offered a second piece when the pasta came out. A small detail. \nThe spring roll appetizer special was delicious! It was beautifully plated and equally as tasty. For our first dish, we were very impressed. The seafood linguine was also very tasty. It had a light tomato broth and was packed with crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams. As a side note, the leftovers reheated beautifully the next day as well! \nNow, to the biggest disappointment--dessert. I love dessert, and was excited to try something from here based on how good the other fare was. We ordered the strawberry-rhubarb crisp, and I would definitely not call it a crisp. In truth, the dessert was barely warmed strawberries with a crunchy top sprinkled over it. Hardly the baked crisp that I have come to expect with that title. The vanilla ice cream on top was very good. \nAll-in-all, we had a really good time.

Service had been pretty friendly and attentive till this point but they got flustered with our large group. As food started coming out, there was quite a bit of confusion with sides and I realized that they had an extra side of the root vegetables at the other end of the table so they just gave it to them. When I was served with my entree, they didn't bring out my side. When I asked our server about it, he insisted I didn't order any. \"No I totally did. You wrote it down and served it to the other end of the table instead.\" I did eventually get my side dish when I corrected him. Food was decent.

My fianc\u00e9 (now husband) and I reserved the upstairs main dining room for our wedding reception (which was to take place in June) back in January of this year. The following 7 months of working with The Waterfront were less than stellar. We dealt with a handful of staff members, all of whom provided us with contradictory information (including, Cheryl).\nUpon originally signing the contract, we were told that the items for our wedding reception could be dropped off the evening before the wedding reception. \n\nFollowing a few attempts to contact the person with whom we signed the contract with follow-up questions via email, we were put in contact with another individual, who explained to us that the staff member with whom we worked with was no longer working for The Waterfront Restaurant, and that they would be assisting us with the setup, organization, and finalization of our wedding reception. \n\nIn order to ensure that everything originally agreed upon was still going to be honored, I took an afternoon off work to meet with the new contact at The Waterfront Restaurant. She explained that we would not be able to drop any items off at The Waterfront the day before the reception, as the earliest anything could be dropped off at the venue was 3:00PM the day of the event. \n\nAs the day of our wedding drew closer, I attempted to reach out to the new contact a couple of times with questions regarding seating charts, but heard nothing back. A few days later, I heard from Cheryl, who brought to my attention that the second staff member whom I was working with was no longer working in the special events department. My fianc\u00e9 called Cheryl and had a phone conversation where she confirmed everything that had been agreed upon with the previous staff members.\n\nOver the course of the following month, Cheryl and my fianc\u00e9 had a handful of email exchanges regarding seating layout, children's menu, removing of tables for a dance floor, etc. Though exhausted and dissatisfied with the amount of effort I, the client, had to put into verifying such details, I was confidant that all was in order and that our wedding reception would be wonderful.\n\nImagine my surprise when seconds after the conclusion of my and my fianc\u00e9's wedding ceremony, we were reached out to via phone call from our family friends, who were not being allowed in to setup, as the banquet manager on duty said that he had heard nothing of their arrival and that no setup could start until 4:30PM. Cheryl, of course, was not onsite.\n\nAfter nearly 30 minutes of reasoning, the staff began setting up the room, finally allowing our family friends to initiate setup. To add insult to injury, the banquet manager was extraordinarily rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional to not only the setup staff, but to members of the wedding party and to the DJ, who also arrived early for setup.\n\nOn top of the above mentioned \"miscommunications\", the banquet manager was never given permission to serve our tiny (baked to serve only eight people) bundt cake, as we were serving our guests creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The banquet manager, Mustapha, went on to cut 30 incredibly thin slices of cake and serve only a portion of our guests (we had more than 80 guests), defending his actions by explaining that it was too late not to serve and be charged for the service as he had already sliced the cake. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I formally reached out to Cheryl with a very thorough and respectful note outlining our experience, and asking for a proposed solution. Cheryl's response was very rude and dismissive; not once did she offer an apology. She also had the nerve to call my husband and leave him a belittling voicemail, suggesting that we should feel \"lucky\" when looking at the \"bigger picture,\" appreciating the \"deal\" that we were given. That she would never allow a wedding to take place on a Saturday for the amount of money we spent.\n\nWe reached out to the owner, Al Falchi, after realizing that Cheryl was unwilling to make good on our original agreement not being honored. In addition to not returning our phone calls or emails, he had Cheryl call my husband, again. She was extremely disrespectful and stated that they would not be giving a penny back to us and that we can sue them if we want, before hanging up. \n\nAl Falchi, as it is incredibly evident that you are so particularly fond of apologizing via Yelp, I look forward to what I am sure will be an elaborate expression of your sincerest apologies with no proposed solution. Or perhaps, you will offer not apology either, which will continue to speak to the treatment one can expect from The Waterfront managerial staff.\n\nYelpers, please note that I am not the type of person to bash a business, but felt very obligated to in this instance. I hope that most of you will take my advise to NOT have a special event held here.", "author": "Joanna P."}

So last night I, my girlfriend and two other friends decided hey why not, lets go check it out. Luckily for us the place wasn't packed, I've heard it usually is and on the regular there is a 45 minute wait.  But hey maybe we are special so we had zero waiting time. No the reality is it was a Tuesday evening. What can I say?\n\nAfter taking a glance at the menu and seeing the pretty expensive salads, I'm not even going to touch on how much the main courses were, we decided to keep it light. So I ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach along with their cabbage and mash potatoes. Honestly I was not that impressed and these sides were greatly over priced. Now my friends were not as conservative as I was, one friend ordered the \"Whole Fish Dish\" and that was exactly what was served. It actually creeped me out a little to have the fish staring at me while my friend was devouring its insides.\n\nThe others had the macaroni and cheese with lobster. Now they appeared to be content with their meals, I didn't hear a word out of them while they ate. Just munching and chewing.\n\nThe bill came after a timely wait on our server getting it to us. I was not going to pay for the overpriced sea rodent that stared at me during the entire dinner, nor for the two who ordered the mac and cheese with lobster simply because they enjoyed themselves to much. Lol  However, I had to bite the bullet and pay the cost for my fancy side orders!

When our waiter arrived at our table the first thing he advised our party is that they are not able to fry or bake any food as there was a problem in the kitchen.  This left us with limited choices on the menu to choose from.  They knew there was a problem in the kitchen far in advance and did not think to call and let us know before we got there.  Extremely unprofessional and shady.  I wanted to leave, but it was already after 6pm and it would be kind of a mess for us to walk into another restaurant with a party of 9 people having no reservation.  I have to note that upon entering the restaurant the host was very straight faced as in no expression, not happy to see us, no enthusiasm, very much like she hated her job. \n\nOur waiter was not on top of his game.  He did not ask us how our meal was at all and stood in the corner most of the time.  I guess we are supposed to call him if we want anything?  I believe it was actually the bus boy who asked us if we enjoyed our food at the end of the meal.  Our waiter just seemed burned out like maybe it's time for him to move on to something else.  There were some other issues, but I know if I address them that the management will probably know who I'm talking about and I don't want to get them in trouble.\n\nOn to the food.  I ordered a Caesar salad and it was the the whole spine of the lettuce, which is disgusting IMO.  Then I had to cut the lettuce up myself and the salad only had 2 croutons.  Listen....I know this is supposed to be a sort of pish posh restaurant....so the salad may have not been typical of say a Chili's restaurant.  That's fine, but it just wasn't good IMO.....from the lettuce to the dressing.  I didn't enjoy it.   I also did not enjoy the oysters or shrimp cocktail.  The reason this restaurant gets one star and not negative stars is because my linguini had good flavor.  \n\nFor the amount of money you spend at this restaurant you'd think the service and food would be top notch, but it's not.  I've received much better service and food at \"lower end\" restaurants.  \n\nThis restaurant is very much for tourists, which was very fitting as we were hosting some business partners from the UK and Japan.  It was nice for them to see the the Bay Bridge at night and all of the lights.  Other than that I won't be recommending this restaurant.\n\nI'm not happy to give this sort of review because I don't like to trash anyone or any establishment, but I have to report things as I see them.  I asked a few people in my party what they thought of the restaurant and they were not impressed either.  I know one of them who is also from the Bay Area will be writing their own review.

We've never dined here before so we wanted to give it a try. When we arrived, the hostess didn't greet us, smile or even say anything to us first. We told her that we had reservations and her exact words were, \"There were some people that arrived late and some people that arrived early so we are trying to even it out.\" Strange.. but we didn't think of it too much at the moment so we took a seat at the bar thinking that we'd get seated shortly. Twenty minutes went by so we checked in to see if they skipped or forgot about us and the hostess said that it would be another twenty minutes before our table would be ready. You've got to be kidding?! That would make it forty minutes after our scheduled reservation. We waited at the bar and had another round of drinks. I could see the frustration of other couples at the bar also. The additional twenty minutes went by and the table was still not ready. I noticed that couples that showed up after us were seated before us so that really pushed me over the edge. Checked in with the hostess again and she said that we were next to be seated. Almost an hour and FINALLY we were told that our table was ready. Walked upstairs and turned out that our table wasn't ready so we had to wait again for them to clean/set it up. We finally took our seats, looked at the menu and ordered.\n\nStarted off with the star route little gem salad. It was drenched in dressing! Way too much on a salad. Would have been better with less dressing. Had the wagyu cut filet as my main and it was cooked the way I wanted and was good. For dessert, I wanted the vanilla bean creme brulee but was told that they ran out so ordered the warm apple tart tatin instead. \n\nThe star goes to the great view. Food wasn't horrible.. it was decent but the ridiculous wait made this experience not so memorable and made this entire dining experience bad. Would have been better off cooking and eating a nice meal at home. Why would you seat early arrivals and not give tables to those who have reservations at that time or those with reservations that have been waiting? Doesn't make any sense. That just screws up the entire purpose of reservations. Understandable if fifteen minutes plus late but that wasn't the case in our situation.\n\nWon't be coming back here again.

We were the only table in our section, except for a couple at another table. They poured water for us right away, then asked us what we wanted to drink. We asked for one regular coffee and one decaf. \n\n15 minutes went by. No coffee. Then when they did bring the coffee, they brought two regular coffees. We reminded him we wanted one decaf. Then the waiter takes our order. Ten minutes go by. Decaf finally comes, along with our food. (Read: coffee took longer than food. What??) \n\nTwo busboys were standing with their backs to us in our section, joking and chatting. We said \"excuse me\" three times to get their attention to bring us salt and pepper. (There wasn't any already on the table.) They didn't turn around, despite an increase in volume while we tried to get their attention. Then a third busboy, who was walking past, saw our facial expressions and immediately asked what he could get for us. \n\nThe food was pretty good at first, but a busboy came by (one of the ones who had his back to us while chatting with a co-worker)  to pour some more water and spilled it all over my plate. I moved it out of the way before it could destroy my meal but my home fries were a total loss. \n\nWe didn't see our waiter again until our plates were mostly empty. As they were cleaning the table, they started piling plates on top of my guest's plate. After there was a stack in front of her, they took everything away. \n\nI won't be going back.", "author": "Ann H."}

There were 25 kids and all of them made sure they had plenty of money for what they hoped would be a very enjoyable dinner.  Aranda helped me with everything up til the day and my daughter held the reservation with her card.  Despite being assured that their service would be no problem, many of the kids reported back that the service was poor despite asking repeatedly of  their server for something as simple as water.  They also went on to say that it seemed like their server was too busy with other tables.  With a large party, my experience is you have a server dedicated to the large party.  Sadly, it seems since they added on such ridiculous extra fees in addition to the tip maybe it was felt that the service wasn't important.  The extra charges on the bill were up to 30% of their food.  Not acceptable!!!!  And at the price the food should have been enough to fill them up, at least the girls.

Several other reviews indicate the restaurant was understaffed, and at our dinner, while there were plenty of runners and busboys, only maybe two or three waitstaff? \n\nOur waitress was perky and friendly when talking to us, but not overly helpful as I asked questions about menu items that clearly indicated I was trying to avoid lemon. I was dining with my sister-in-law and brother. Our apps were fine, seemed to take a long time for main courses to come out. My SIL ordered one dish but found food mixed in it that clearly didn't belong. While we were eating our waitress never came by to ask how everything was.  \n\nBusboys cleared our plates, and eventually the waitress appeared, announced that she'd bring two desserts and zoomed off. So the three of us shared them. One was a chocolate cake thing and the other was some sort of apple crumble thing with vanilla ice cream on top. \n\nThere's a certain standard you expect from non-chain restaurants in SF, and Waterfront didn't rise to it. All the food was ... okay. Except the desserts, which I thought sucked. But all the other stuff? I could have done it at home, just as well. \n\nOn our way out the manager was by the door, and my SIL went to let him know about our spotty service and the accident with her main dish. At first she reported back that he'd said he would comp the whole check. Then he came over and told her he would comp our valet. But we're local - we used mass transit. So then he said he couldn't do anything except give her a free drink at the bar or free valet service. She asked to speak with HIS manager, and he said, \"I AM the manager.\" Well, if you're the manager how is it you're all of a sudden not capable of reversing the charges on a credit card? \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, he totally ruined my impression of the restaurant. I could have chalked everything else up to being busy and understaffed. But the manager first saying he'd comp the whole check (which was more than generous) and then reneging and then claiming he couldn't?

I made reservations for my girlfriend and myself on Valentines Day. First mistake on my part. \n\nI made a 2 PM reservation for lunch. 2 days before the reservation I get a call from the restaurant asking me if I could move my reservation to 1:45 to accommodate them for the dinner rush they would be expecting, I agreed thinking it wouldn't be a big deal. \n\nFast forward to Valentines day my girlfriend and I are stuck in insane traffic on the Embarcadero. I give them a call ahead to let them know I'd be late, they adjust the reservation and nothing more. This would be a perfect time to warn me about the bad experience I was going to have. We get there at about 2:20, very late, I wasn't expecting my reservation to be held at that point and decided to take my chances since the place was pretty dead.\n\n I was afterwards told that the manager had actually decided to have a preset menu with no exceptions. They could have told me on the phone about the menu change that had apparently been in effect for a while. I reluctantly agreed and that was my second mistake. \n\nThe preset menu was an absurd $85 per person for a very drawn out and subpar dining experience. My lovely girlfriend and I were sat in the very corner of the \"outdoor\" section which we requested. Our lovely \"waterfront\" view consisted of a piece of driftwood jutting out of the water and a barnacle infested pier.\n\nEven the circus troupe that would be called our waiters took 20 minutes to actually greet us and bring us our water. We got waited on by a different waiter about every 15 minutes while I could see the waiters before this one jostling each other and joking in plain view standing around.\n\nThe 3 course meal should have been done in less than an hour but thanks to the molasses themed service and waiting almost 20 minutes between meals we were there for 2 hours. How long does it take to heat up preset meals? Food 3/5 parts of our lamb were cold and the texture of the raw salmon was cringe worthy. God bless whoever made the desert to pull the food rating up to a 3.

The setting is so wonderful, and decor is great... but the food and service were marginal at best.  I had a downright rude waitress one time, and the other two times, they were just... fine.  Not what I would expect from a fancy restaurant.  But the food is the real disappointment.  How does such a restaurant -- with its location and history -- not know how to prepare and serve whole dungeness crab?  And the clam chowder was so thick and heavy -- not refined at all.  The crab sandwich was also funky.  Just seems a shame that such a place should not be fabulous.  Save your money and go elsewhere until this place rethinks its head chef and service committments.", "author": "A. W."}

I came to this restaurant only because I saw that they had dine around town special, so I followed the link on opentable and made a reservation for dinner. Once we got there, I was already disappointed at the decoration of the place, the outside was extremely gorgeous but once you walk in, everything inside looks old and dirty. None of the staffs had smiles on their face and you would expect a nice restaurant to have great customer service right? Nope... Not here. It took them basically 10 mins to set a table up and there's barely any other customers in the restaurant. \n\nOnce we sat down, I asked for the dine around town menu and the \"mute\" looking waiter said they don't have a menu for that. He went over to ask his manager and that's when I found out they don't do dinners for dine around town, only for lunch. So why was there a dinner menu on  the dine around town website? That's false advertisement! I went over to talk to the person in charged, supposedly the manager of the place. He obviously did not care, no wonder all his staffs act the same as him. He said \"dine around town\" is for people who cannot afford fine dining and his restaurant does not need that kind of service because they have 300 tables booked for the night. I'm very curious to find out how many other tables that came in yesterday and left because of the false advertisement. A manager that knows how to run a restaurant business will understand the value of customers satisfaction, it was quite disappointing that he did not even try to keep customers around. \n\nNevertheless, I will not come back to this place to even bother to try the food. The service, the environment (besides the bay bridge view, which you can get that  at 10 other restaurants along the pier) and the food is just not attractive at all. If you are interested in fine dining experience in San Francisco or try to impress on a date please don't fall for this place. Good luck!", "author": "Sandy L."}

Given its prime location, we expected a tourist trap that had the views, and only the views, going for it.  We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the seafood and meals there.  \n\nThe ambiance and pleasant atmosphere was as expected.  The only downsides that I see are as follows:  (i) as other yelpers have commented on, the service can be a tad slow -  they have a ton of folks running around running food, clearing tables, etc., but for whatever reason a waiter if often difficult to find; and (ii) the menu isn't terribly diverse - there are a lot of boring entrees and appetizers and, while at most places there are like 5 apps and entrees that I am deciding between, here there are only like 1 or 2 of each that tickle my fancy.\n\nAlso, happy hour is kind of brutal.  They have an interesting happy hour menu, but there isn't real seating anywhere unless you want to eat at the bar or communal couches.", "author": "Jay F."}

After some strange wait for a table on the deck, we sat down and waited for menus for about 15 minutes.\n\nWe had the lobster risotto to start us off, which did not turn out as amazing as I had hoped for it to be. I had the wood oven roasted blue nose bass, and seeing as how this place serves predominantly seafood, it didn't quite cut it for me. For this price, you'd think that it would be leaps and bounds better than Pacific Catch!\n\nAs a whole, we had a good night there. Tranquil, with an amazing view of the bay, and a pretty delicious dessert mini sampler between us three.

We got there at different times, some on time and others a little late but the staff was very nice and accomodating.  The restaurant is nice with white tablecloths and big windows so you get a fantastic view of the water and Bay Bridge. Our waiter was very good - attentive and available.  Surprisingly the restaurant was not packed on a Saturday night for dinner.  We had a great view facing the Bay Bridge and had a very good time.  I ordered the wood oven roasted whole fish that had crab on top with green beans and we shared sides of brussel sprouts, crab mashed potatoe, and lobster mac 'n cheese. We also a bunch of appetizers - small seafood platter and the mussels.  I got to say that the small seafod platter was a very good portion size. The seafood was fresh and there was 3 different sauces. There was an assortment of clams, oysters, mussels, crab, shrimp, and ceviche.  It was delicious!!  I also really enjoyed my fish which was cooked perfectly and there was a lot of crab meat on top. They did not skimp on the crab meat. I enjoyed some wine that we brought and also their cocktail called Lemon Meringue was so good.  For dessert, I had the rhubarb crisp a la mode which was good.

Sigh, but at least their happy hour lasts an hour later than most, so I was sure we'd come back later in the evening after walking around.\n\nHappy hour is only available at their bar area, as well as their \"lounge area,\" (but that's how it is for most restaurants).  I would have loved to sit on the patio area, but I was all about those 99 cent oysters.  The bar was full, so we sat in their lounge, which wasn't much of a lounge, but still comfortable.  I wish there was a better view of the bay from where we were.\n\nI couldn't stop ordering oysters.  They were just ask delicious as the ones we had at the Ferry Building earlier, and much cheaper.  Along with the oysters, we ordered the clams in white wine/garlic sauce ($5), truffle fries (they were either $3 or $5), and a glass of sparkling wine ($5) off of the happy hour menu.  All the prices were very reasonable... I believe no more than $5, yet the quality was great.  The clams were delicious; I drank all the sauce like it was soup.  My bf also ordered a bowl of clam chowder off of the regular menu ($9), which had included of bacon bits (yum).\n\nService was very friendly.  We were originally told by the hostess to order up at the bar if we were to sit in the lounge.  When we did, one of the bartenders told us to relax and he would come over and take care of us.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant evening after a long day of walking around.

Really?  sitting for 20 minutes and no can even come and greet us??  Awful.  the only reason Im giving 2 stars is because the menu LOOKED good.", "author": "jessica b."}

Dim lighting, good seating, great view. There was this one table that was placed right behind the podium, cramped in the walkway that led to the main restaurant and right in front of the kitchen doors (I don't know if you can visualize that, but I SERIOUSLY crossed my fingers that we wouldn't be given that seat haha).\n\nBut we got there around 6ish I believe and surprisingly we were seated immediately in the back, with a great view of the ocean. Like some other reviews have noted, they did not give us any of the open tables right next to the water...maybe it's a policy to only give prime seating to old men who bring young women and buy a shit ton of wine. I kid.\n\nTo be honest, we weren't that hungry, we just wanted to spend some time to chat out of the cold. SO, we ordered some appetizers and some dessert.\n\nI have to say, they have some bomb ass $7 french fries (HAHAH). Their clam chowder was pretty bland and bleh (I had some clam chowder from Fisherman's Wharf the other day, and OMG SO FREAKIN GOOD)... Their crab cakes are reaaally good. \n\nWe also got the dessert sampler, which had 4-5 different tasties in it for $18 I believe. The brownie with chocolate ice cream was my favorite. It was so freaking good.\n\nOverall, the prices were above-average but understandable. The food itself was okay-to-good. The place itself was gorgeous. That in itself would be 3-4 stars.\n\nBut like many people have said, the service was not the best. Well, more specifically, our server was just plain WEIRD. He was European for sure, but that notwithstanding, he just served us very....strangely. His response to anything I asked, requested, or said, was a...2-second stare and a general nod (not in my direction). LOL, I mean I got what I needed, but it was so ...strange. No tableside banter or recommendations, just 5-7 NODS all night. The busboys or what you would call them were attentive, although all-over-the-place at times. Plenty of shoulder bumps and nods throughout the night from the staff to each other. But our waters were constantly refilled...the staff was polite. Oh, and they were definitely older than the standard 20-somethings you usually get in restaurants, which is fine.\n\nBut I would say this restaurant with its service was \"A-ok\" but not \"Yay! Im a Fan\"\n\n...moral of the story is, Yelp! reviewers do not lie. *nod*", "author": "Jeff L."}

Came with carrots and peas that seemed like the frozen bag variety. Honestly it looked like a Swanson TV dinner. What a joke! The place looks snazzy so I was shocked. Plus the bartenders act like they're doing you a favor when they finally decide to serve you. To top it all off there was a very drunk guy who bothered us the whole time.

I had always wanted to try Waterfront after driving by a few times and then checking out their menu online though.  Plus, it's right on the waterfront (so THAT's where the name comes from... =P), so that view alone made it worthwhile to try.\n\nWe came here on a mild evening for their Happy Hour menu, and got a chance to eat in their \"patio\" area.  Wanting to try a bit of everything, we ordered their Clams with White Wine and Garlic, Mussels in Madras Curry, Calamari, Fries, and the Duet of Sliders.  The Calamari and the Fries were pretty standard, though they went great with the aioli sauce (calamari) or the mussels/clams sauces (fries).  The Clams and Mussels were pretty good, but I would opt for the mussels again if only because the Madras Curry made it a little more unique.  The real winner was the sliders plate - really hit the spot with a cold beer after a day at work, and probably one of the better sliders I've had.  \n\nThere are certainly some redeeming qualities about this place, but I have to admit I can see why some felt their experience was underwhelming.  Service was uneven, as the waitress was nice, but it took a while for her to make her rounds.  Also, when we arrived to get a table for the happy hour, the hostess gave us an odd look and checked the clock before bringing us a table (we were there 30 mins before it ended, so not sure what was going on there).  Some of the prices seem to land a bit on the high side based on the menu, but hard to say if it's worth it quality/portion wise.  Decent chance I'll be back at some point though, especially to try their Lobster Risotto and Crab Mashed Potatoes.", "author": "Mike L."}

The view is great, skip this place and have a romantic picnic instead. The highlight for our friends birthday dinner was the Foccacia bread. The interior is not very special at all. Our server was nice and personable. Although they have a way of talking to you that makes you feel as though you dont have money. If someone orders just a salad, dont insult them by saying is that your first course, not everyone can afford your overpriced main courses. Also the portion to price ratio is very low. I ordered the mixed grill and although the scallops were very good, 38 dollars for maybe 8 pieces of meat and a little arugula is concerning. So we split our bill with cash and card. They were supposed to be 70 on my card and had the other 300 some dollars in cash. We were very specific and told him 3 times. Mind you he had the cash in his hand already and still charged my card the full amount. When I went to sign the receipt, I noticed the error. So he had to void that transaction and still charge me the original 70. So now I have a hold for 410 dollars for this restaurant that in 3 days still hasnt cleared. I asked to speak to the manager expecting him to be sympathetic and offer some sort of compensation for the huge inconvenience but NOTHING. He was RUDE and kept waving his hands way too close to my face and saying what do you want me to do? Do ANYTHING, do something to make me leave with a smile. We just spent a lot of money, it may not be a lot compared to other customers but its a lot to us, and you should cater to all crowds. Word of mouth means a lot! Go somewhere else and youll leave happier, such as Tonga Room or Thanh Long. 410 dollars to the average person is a large amount of money and you dont know if you could have left me with no money, or worse, overdrafted due to your mistake.

I like dining in the city, and the thought of beng on the embarcadero looking out at the bay at night with decent food... but the experience was marred by poor service and lackluster, almost offensive, food presentation.\n\nHad a 8pm reservation for a party of four - two couples. My wife and I arrive a few minutes to 8. The hostess welcomes us but points out, oddly, \"your reservation is in 13 minutes.\" I took it to mean, 'go sit down, you are early and we can't seat you now.' Ok when someone gives me precision like that - sort of with an attitude, then I hold them to it. So at 8pm, I look over and ask if the table is ready. This is when the cluster#$% starts. There is another hostess who does the seating, walking to the table with menus bit. The gal at the front door who looks at the reservation computer has no say in the matter. So together they do this lame ass thing where she looks at the computer to see who is to be seated next, the other gal looks around and sees if the table is ready, they debate which party is next and why, then she runs around to get that party seated... it's total goofball behavior. Anyways, it's now 8:30 and we're not seated. They make some excuse like, \"oh we are just waiting for the rest of your party.\" Well I told them, no, we want to be seated and they will join us.\n\nAnyway, during all this, about 3 waiters come up to the front to bitch to the hostesses about something... I presume it's about what tables are being seated in their stations. Totally poor display in front of customers for the wait staff to be bitching and flailing arms...jeez a-holes take it up at a staff meeting.\n\nSomewhere near 8:45, after two more requests, she seats us. She tells us, \"oh I have a special table for you near a window.\" She takes us up to the 3rd floor... weird, as I expected the 2nd floor. The 3rd floor 'looks' nice, but you quickly realize it is some overflow after-thought area. Not only aren't we seated next to a window (she puts us in the middle of the room) - which is fine, there is a 360 glass window all around so the view is decent... but the ambiance in the room SUCKS. Weird flourescent canned lights create bright glare, and the AC is on and its cold.\n\nWorst of all, I know the 3rd floor must have been some overflow spot because there is inconsistent wait staff service. We were served by 4 different waiters, and waitied 15 minutes to even be asked if we were ready to order. Asked the first guy for some bread... nada. Asked the second guy.... nada. FInally asked the hostess as she seated another couple, \"Can we have some bread?\" to which she replied \"Yes you can.\"... more attitude biatccccch!?!  Finally yet another guy comes by with some delicious cold and stale sourdough. mmmmmmm, good.\n\nWhen the dinner finally arrived, its was all pretty disappointing.  Small portions, and I'm not a big eater by any means. Ordered the homemade linguini with various sea food.... lobster, crab, mussels, etc.  I kid you not, I think I got 5 small little diced up pieces of lobster? WTF, isn't this SF in the heart of shellfish season? I expected some big juicy lobster pieces, not some shit that looks like it came out of a frozen bag.  My wife asked for crab with her vegetable linguini. Couldn't see any crab, asked the waiter...who said he'd ask the cook. Waiter comes back and says 'cook says yes there is crab.' Well guess what, there wasn't any g.d. crab in there.\n\nBottom line, I wouldn't eat here again.

Fermin, instead, was very friendly, warm and pleasant to talk with. He gave us the best service ever, he was on top of everything and even took a picture for us. Out of a $150 bill, we left a $60 tip just because Fermin was very nice and always there offering a better service than our actual waiter. We will definitely come back, but hopefully we will be attended by Fermin. Overall is a must have experience in San Francisco.", "author": "Moni T."}

Ordered the drink called \"lemon drop\" and that was amazing too. Point being I went about a week ago expecting to have a nice date with my Bf. They gave us both beverage and food menu. Went to order my food and drink and they asked us for our id (I understand it's required by law, but every other time they hadn't asked us for it and gave us drinks) then when I explain that we hadn't brought them because the other times they didn't the waiter rudely told me that he could tell I was MAYBE 20. Which I get because I'm 4'10 but left me wondering why he gave me the beverage menu if he thought I was 20. *later on he came back and told me that he believed me that I wasn't 20 because I looked older but he couldn't serve me alcohol without id, like ya ya didn't you just tell me how I looked 20* Later on ordered what I normally do and it was terrible. The calamari wasn't cooked all the way thru and to top it all off it was drenched in oil, also the Cesar dressing was as thick as mayo and smelt like it had not been refrigerated well. All in all I will not go back and that was a complete WASTE of 140$ spent on food parking and bridge toll.", "author": "Melissa C."}

It was definitely an older crowd, but it's understandable since it IS a really nice restaurant. We were told that for happy hour, we had to sit at the bar or at their couches, but it was pretty full when we got there. One of the waitresses was really nice and told us it's okay if we sat at the tables, so yep, that's where we kicked it back and had our happy hour, with the whole nice dinner set up and all. \n\nThe main reason YOU should come here: $1 oysters and $3 beers. Oysters were bombbbbbb...mmm hmmmmmmmmmmmm. We ordered two dozens for 4 people (but pretty much shared by me and my buddy). Beers were good too of course. We also ordered some other appetizer dishes from their happy hour menu, like \"truffle fries\" I believe? and calamari? The portions for those were pretty small and I GUESS pricier than normal for happy hour, but hey, it was not bad at all at such a classy restaurant. The server was also really attentive. He even served us bread, as if we were actually having dinner. \n\nConsidering I was with a bunch of boys, they just watched a basketball game at the bar after, so the place can be pretty cool and laid-back too. After that, we hung out at their balcony with a GORGEOUS view of the bay. I can't rave about their non-happy hour, but this is definitely not a bad place to START a night out!

I'm thinking this restaurant doesn't know much about the saying that goes, \"one good thing you do and maybe a couple of people hear about it, but one bad thing and everyone knows about it.\" Would I ever go to this restaurant again? Heck no. Would I recommend this restaurant to anyone? Never. Will I tell everyone I am aquainted with and whoever plans to go to San Francisco about this horrible restaurant? Yes. \nI walked in around 530 yesterday evening with my two children to get something to go. We've been hanging around the area and wanted to grab a quick snack. When I walked in the restaurant I was greeted by a curly hair blonde, I told her I wanted to place an order to go. She politely told me I could do so at the bar. So I tell my children to follow me so we can place an order. Before I even reach the bar some darker skin male (maybe in his 50's) comes over and starts screaming at me about how I cannot take my children to the bar. I tell him that I was only ordering my food to go, wasn't planning on sitting down, wasn't planning on staying any longer than it would take them to get my food out to me. I look over at the host, and she's looking as confused as I am. Then this rude worker asks me if I am over 21 and that if I want to order food from the bar I have to show the bartender my I.D. Uhhh, ok. He shoos my children back to the waiting area. At this point I'm holding my tongue from saying something to him. I wanted to leave but I already told my kids we would grab a quick bite. I really just wanted some damn fries. I go over to the bar and tell the bartender I want to put in an order to go. I show him my I.D and say, \"Apparently I need to show you my I.D to order food?\" He tells me that I do not need to show my I.D to order food and gives the darker skinned male a weird look. (I'm thinking to myself at this point, everyone must not get along with this guy.) Bartender takes my order, I tip him $2 on at $7.99 tab. It takes them 5 mins to bring out my fries and I get my children and myself out of there as quickly as I could. \n\nSo...\n1) This restaurant is not kid friendly.\n2) Service is horrible, unless they have something against my kind of people. I really don't know. \n3) I know kids can't sit at the bar, I wasn't planning on sitting at the bar, I was planning on having my kids next to me (because obviously the restaurant is not kid friendly and I wouldn't want them sitting somewhere associating with strangers.) \n4) Maybe if you don't want to have people order food to go from your bar, you can have your hosts take orders in the front. It's really not that hard. \n5) Also, thanks for the 10 pieces of fries. I gave your bartender a $2 tip because he offered me water, but seriously I should have deducted $ from the tab for how horrible the service was.

We were originally greeted by the kind and gracious hostesses who told us we were going to have to wait an hour for a table but that we could pass the time in their cocktail lounge. If you have been here, you know their cocktail lounge is small and right next to the hostess stand. When I turned to walk over to the cocktail lounge, the so-called \"manager\" put his hand in my face and said he did not have room for me there. I replied that perhaps he should speak to the hostess because she just directed us to wait over here. He then proceeded to stomp over to the hostess stand and yell at one of the poor girls that there was no room for me and my friends. The bar stools were taken in the cocktail lounge but there was NO ONE standing and there was additional seating on a bench directly across from the bar. The \"manager\" then stormed outside to presumably yell at someone else. \n\nThe hostess apologized to us and then told me that we could order from the bar and then sit on the bench. When the \"manager\" saw that we were standing next to the bar he came in screaming at us yelling at us asking whether we had heard him and that he didn't have room for us. I simply asked him why he was being so rude and then he proceeded to scream at me while waving his hands in my face and kick all of us out. He refused to give us his name; he said that he was the only manager and that he didn't have a business card. We asked the hostesses what his name was but they couldn't give it to us, which I understand because they don't want to lose their jobs.\n\nI use to work in the food industry and have never seen someone act so atrociously to customers.

Finally a bus server came by our table, poured some water and asked if we needed anything. We politely requested that our waiter visit our table. A few minutes later he did. No greeting, no apology no nothing. He stood there with his tablet in hand and waited for us to begin a dialog.

We sat in a waiting area, where many other diners were waiting to be seated. We waited about 10 minutes, and then I went to speak with the host. We were told there were several parties ahead of us, waiting to be seated. I asked how this could be the case, since we had a reservation, arrived on time,  and we were there to celebrate a birthday. I was told that there was nothing they could do since the computer system had gone down, other than to sit in a part of the restaurant without a view (which is one of the main reasons we chose this place). We ended up leaving because I was able to get a reservation for another restaurant nearby on short notice, where we were seated immediately and treated much better. We were definitely understanding about the holiday rush and computer issue, but if anyone had greeted us warmly, with a genuine apology, that would have made a big difference.

Beautiful view of the San Francisco waterfront, with a complementary nautical theme in the restaurant proper. Sure, it's no pineapple under the sea, but it feels like the deck of a sailboat or something. In terms of service and food, it falls far short of the standard it gives off. For my experience, the service was overall average, nothing spectacular but nothing horribly wrong. I got their handmade linguini, which was nice - though definitely not worth $20+. I'm not generally picky about my food, and I did eat the whole dish no problem, it just wasn't anything to devour with relish. I went with my family, who all agree that, while the food is okay, it is far overpriced.

I felt like I was on an episode of hell's kitchen with the worst cook on the line. We really could have used Gordon Ramsay to have our backs this Mother's day. Really too bad because the location and view was gorgeous. They also charged two people's credit cards double! Our check had two extra mimosas and one extra champagne on it as well. Our main waiter was great and tried very hard to make everything right but some of the other people that helped him out were rude and completely ignored our questions.", "author": "Kimberly B."}

Then everything comes to a screeching halt.  Our service was terrible.  I'm not sure our server was properly trained because every time she approached our table, something stupid happened. (\"Do you want me to pour you more wine?\" Huh?  No, actually, I ordered it so I can take it home with me.) \n\nI could forgive it if we were eating somewhere under a hundred bucks, but this was no cheap dinner.  We were also dining with our toddler son for a special occasion - who was very well behaved.  But it was clear from the very beginning that the staff of the restaurant was not happy to welcome children.

The manager (I think she may even have been the owner b/c we tried to talk to someone above her and didn't get anywhere) claimed I hadn't reserved the place when I definitely had, and kept trying to up the price on me after we had already agreed to a price.  I finally had to pass the event to my boss b/c I felt like I was allowing myself to get taken advantage of.  I read a few other online reviews who had similar problems here, so it wasn't just me.  \n\nIn the end she even refused to honor part of our agreement  to have the food and beverage minimum include tax and tip.  We spent far less than the minimum, keeping in mind that the tax and tip would bring us up to it.  I have worked with a good number of vendors and never had such a negative experience.  If you work with them be sure to get EVERY detail in writing.\n\nThe staff was fine the day of the event.  Nothing spectacular, but they brought out food and poured drinks and did a find job. The food wasn't memorable and didn't seem worth the price, but it did at least come out on time.\n\nThe view was the redeeming point of the entire experience.  They have an awesome view, but there are plenty of better restaurants along the waterfront that have good views, good food and good management.", "author": "Aubrey Rose V."}

It was ridiculous! We waited for at least 15mins and therefore our booking was 15mins late! \nWhen we were finally seated, we had a lovely waiter who was friendly and knowledgeable. However when our food arrived we were surprised at how small the sizes were and I know we get large portions here, but i am talking - TINY!

For the past couple years, I've been lucky enough to observe this week-long celebration of the coming of spring (characterized by inebriation, heavy partying, and usually a lot of nudity) in South Beach. Spring break in Cancun? That's for children compared to Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference week in Miami. And this year was no different. I flew back from four straight days of debauchery on Sunday night, and I was DEAD tired. All I wanted to do for my birthday the next day was sleep. However, having the sweetest sister in the world (poor me), she wanted to invite a couple of my friends and set up a little birthday dinner. How could I possibly say no to that? \n\nSis suggested that we go to the Waterfront. I knew where it was, but I hadn't been there in years. Since I wasn't doing any of the planning, I basically let my little sister do all the legwork. We got there about 15 minutes late, but thanks to the adorable valet who calls all the ladies \"bella\", we were able to get inside right away. My sister had called ahead and requested a table with a view, and they had told her they would try to accommodate us as much as possible, but it so happened that there was a huge Siemens conference going on that night and they had taken up the entire downstairs patio that overlooked the bay. Waterfront, however, was gracious enough to save a table for us upstairs that had an equally amazing view. We were seated right away.\n\nOur waiter came by and gave us the usual spiel on recommendations for the night. He then took our order, sans notepad. I love when they do that. Not only was the staff extra knowledgeable about the food, they were helpful and attentive, even though we were sitting in a table tucked away into one of the more secluded corners of the restaurant. Our glasses were never empty, our dishes came out promptly, and our food was at perfect temperature. I had the handmade seafood linguini, but I did try a little bite from everyone else, and they all tasted amazing. When the lobster mac and cheese came out, I could smell the truffle oil wafting into my brain and tantalizing all my senses. I. Love. Truffle. And you put truffle AND lobster AND cheeeeeeeese together? Kill me now. I'm in heaven. The staff brought out the cake my sister bought at the end of the night, let me blow out the candles, then took it back to the kitchen only to return 10 minutes later with perfectly cut pieces for my guests and I. By the time we were done with dessert and paying the bill, we were full, happy, and we all decided to leave extra tip on top of our 18% gratuity, because the service was so good. We hadn't even noticed that we were the last table in the restaurant, because no one had rushed us out, even though it was way past closing. \n\nWaterfront, you are one class act. Thank you for making my birthday dinner absolutely perfect.", "author": "Jeani L."}

But after thinking it over, what am I really paying for?  The service?  The view?  The food?  The wine?  All of the above.  I already knew about the service, so I had pretty low expectations coming in.  Annnnd...I've decided that they are deserving of 2 stars.  Maybe only 1.5.  \n\nIt was 4th of July and prior to the day of, I called to see if I could make a reservation for four.  They kept putting me on hold, but not without letting me know that I had called during a busy time and seemed as though I was bothering them.  Okay...no big.  I get it.  \n\nI then proceeded to call them back during a \"less busy\" time and asked if I could get a table with a view and order a dessert plate beforehand.  She basically rudely responded by saying that it will be a busy night and can't guarantee anything.  But she will note the requests.  When we got there during the mad rush of people walking toward the pier to catch a glimpse of fireworks behind all the fog, there was a guy at the door who didn't even look at us when we approached the door.  Then, when we reached for the handle, he rudely asked us if we were eating at the restaurant and had a reservation.  REALLY?  I understand that you are busy, but you don't have to give that \"bouncer/doorman\" attitude.  EW.\n\nOnce we got in, they seated us almost right away and sat us at a table with a view.  Perfect!  I hope you don't forget the dessert!  I asked my friend to ask the manager again about the dessert and she rudely responded with \"Yes, I spoke with you about it over the phone.  We have it noted\".  Again I ask, REALLY?  She didn't speak with her...she spoke with me!  And ultimately, guess what?  They forgot the dessert so we reminded her again!  Oh man...they BETTER comp the dessert! \n\nWhile ordering our drinks, the waitress proceeded to recommend a different wine from our original every single time.  I get that she was trying to recommend something that others prefer, but  I'm sorry...do you know what we like?  She also made a not so nice comment to one of us...I think she mistook joking for being inappropriate.  \n\nSee...what sucks about this place is that they have decent food.  The calamari was good, but they didn't offer any appetizer plates for us to eat it with and they took the plates away before we were even finished with it.  What?  Why?  The Lobster Risotto was good with lemony chunks of lobster, the NY Steak was thick and cooked perfectly (Although the NY Steak came way after the other dishes because they overcooked the first one).  The Kobe Stuffed Cheeseburger was okay, but the Truffle BACON Aioli was amazing!  Does your mind change about the food when the service is spotty at a fancy-schmancy establishment?\n\nWhen the check came, they comp'd some items off the list, but this leads me to wonder...Do they resort to comp'ing something off everyone's meal because their service sucks so bad?", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Fortunately (or so it seems), I've only had cocktails here and happy hour food, so I can't be a judge of the true menu/service.\n\nThe  waitress approaches us and friendly Matt asked her how her day is going.  She then proceeds to whine to us for a good five minutes about how she worked a double on both Saturday and Sunday, and is only still at the restaurant (On Monday around 230pm) b/c a co-worker called out sick. Wahh wahh, cry me a river. We don't want to hear that. Make something up and pretend like you're having a decent day, considering it was 65 degrees, sunny, and President's Day!  \n\nWe finish up our bottle of champagne and move inside around 430 when it started to get a bit chilly outside.  We met some cool folks at the bar and the bartender was friendly and talked me into ordering some sweet drink that he swore wouldn't be too sweet for me after telling him over and over I did NOT want a sweet drink.  \n\nWell, he talks me into it and it was gross and way too sweet. We split the sliders and fried calamari and shrimp, which were both good, but definitely nothing spectacular.  They have about 6 or 7 appetizer options to choose from that are $5 each from 3-7pm Monday-Saturday. Not a bad deal.  Well drinks are also $5 and beers on tap are only $3! \n\nSo, just based on happy hour, ambiance (the lovely outdoor patio facing the bay/Bay Bridge), and the wine/champagne selection, Waterfront Restaurant is pretty A-OK in my book.

This place looks way better at night than it does during the day. Great view of the Bay bridge, Yuerba Buena and Treasure Island.\nWe were seated quickly as there were only 3 other parties. We ordered drinks, skipped the appetizers and went right for the entrees.\n\nI ordered the Grilled \"SRF\"(Snake River Farm) American Wagyu Flatiron Steak with a Demi-Glace and Mashed Potatoes. Also got a side of Grilled Asparagus.\n\nThe steak was very tasty, cooked medium-rare and quite juicy. However, it was a very small serving, even with the potatoes it was as filling as an average appetizer. For $24 it was too small of a portion. Grilled asparagus was undercooked, had grill marks but was still very crunchy and cold.\n\nI tasted some of the Crab Mashed Potatoes which were delicious, much tastier than the regular mashed potatoes that came with my steak. \n\nThe service was quite bad. After we ordered Entrees the waitress did not come back for ~30 minutes. We were all in need of drinks for a long time. 2 of the sides we ordered never showed up, and one of them was the wrong order. My friend's entree showed up as another wrong order, and it took another 20 minutes or so to bring the correct one out.

For example, the oil in the fryer for the buttermilk calamari appetizer was obviously not hot enough.  (When the oil isn't hot enough, the breading soaks up a lot of oil; when the oil is at the correct temperature, the breading immediately seals with a nice crunchy coating.)  The seafood pasta entree had too much seafood for the amount of pasta.  The chairs were chintzy aluminum tubing.  The tab came to $75 for lunch for one appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol, and tip - that's a lot for lunch for two.\n\nNormally this would warrant a two-star rating, but.... food poisoning takes it down to the minimum.

Upon entering I give my name and rather than a welcome I am told that they have a table for me (I did make a reservation ) on the second floor but must vacate by 7:30.  As it is not yet 5:30 and I am a single it is most unlikely that I will be dining for more than two hours.  The absence of a real welcome was not made rudely, but rather bespoke an absence of training, or so it seemed to me.  The absence of training carried through to my waitress who was intrusive and pushy.  Not rude.  She just didn't know any better.  Really.  If there was someone who would take the front of the house in hand this place would be so much better.  It would be good enough to deserve the food that comes from the kitchen.\n\nThe food.

A mildly spiced tomato broth contained two large crab legs, some very large shrimp, chunks of fish, and shellfish.

So we decided to not spend another second wasting our time with a place that lost our reservation, never told us about a prefix menu, and on top of that couldn't even spell a name.

I've decided I like my box and I will crawl back in after the holidays and stick with my tried and true.\n\nThe Waterfront has a nice view.  Nice staff.  Friendly Valet parking.  Nice Bar area, which, oh by the way has a pretty decent happy hour from what I could tell from their menu.\n\nOther than that the food was just okay.  Nothing to brag about.  Perhaps if they had a more extensive Christmas day lunch menu it would of been better.  I do give them kiddos for nice presentation of food items.\n\nMy main issue was I ordered Prime Rib and wanted it rare and it was 1/2 rare and 1/2 well done.  The portion was HUGE and I think I was given 1/2 the cow but I wasn't looking for huge portions... I just wanted a nice piece of meat.  My mother ordered some sort of chicken that did smell good, and it came with polenta, however the polenta was a glob of dryness and just sat on the plate.  My sister had the salmon and I think she probably made the right choice since all of her food was gone and she seemed to enjoy and compliment the dish along the way.\n\nHere is my thing... anyone who has to work on Christmas Eve or Christmas day deserves a big pat on the back, so there was NO freaking was I was going to complain.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-08", "description": "I came here for a work lunch, to celebrate our hard work at the end of the year (ugh, working in finance sucks at year end). With 8 of us, we tried most of the menu.\n\nTo start with, I got the $11 CALAMARI appetizer to share. It was sooo good. Everyone liked it; my supervisor really liked the spicy aioli. It's topped with an arugula salad and I love arugula.  I ordered the $22 grilled FRESH FISH as my entree. Apparently I'm way too Chinese because I thought fresh fish = whole fish with head etc. Nope, it's just a big piece. I ordered the escolar hoping for fishy fish; it's not. I should have paid more attention to the server who described it as being between a bass and a salmon, with the flakiness of a white fish. She also said it's a very meaty fish; I felt like I was cutting (with my fork) into chicken. Although it came with a bit of salad, I was glad to have eaten the calamari. Maybe it's because my stomach is at its holiday-stretched size.\n\nFISH 'N CHIPS: the fish were shaped like mozzarella sticks, not the fried fillets I'm used to. My co-worker was not impressed. He said he's had better and prefers them beer dipped. Keep in mind though, he's a beer drinkin', football-watchin' kinda guy. LOBSTER RISOTTO ($30): looked very creamy. My co-worker said it only looked that way and the rice was undercooked. SEAFOOD COBB SALAD: looked good, huge prawns, nice avocado, lots of crab meat. You don't even need to work for your crab and there was plenty of it. CRAB MASHED POTOTES: I tried a bite of it, very buttery. Good if you're into crab; I'm meh about crab. LINGUINE CLAM PASTA: this was the largest entree; I didn't get her take on it.\n\nPricing: ok on the company dime. Mains are in the $20+ range. Surprisingly decent portions; I'm used to smaller portions in this price point. The CIOPPINO actually had more than one shrimp (reference to the cioppino I got at a highly rated restaurant with meager portions). Don't get it if you're well-dressed as the crab leg is not pre-cracked. When my co-worker started cracking her leg, my other co-worker held up his napkin as a shield.\n\nService: very nice. Maybe because it's a Wednesday in January and it was dead. We were the only customers. With the 8 of us, 4 servers would come to serve us all at once. Our waters were kept filled too. Only one of us drank faster than they poured.\n\nBathroom: underneath the stairs by the front door. Dark lighting.\n\nIN SHORT, decent portions for its price point; good service; average to good food. I would come here again for the calamari, probably during happy hour.", "author": "Yan E."}

However the chairs in this place are uncomfortable to the point of unbearable (in the lower dining room.

I had to sit perched forward leaning on the table just to sit upright. Of course I'm a skinny minny, not a big fatty with a huge rotund belly so maybe that's who the chairs were really for. My sole was very good and the steamed spinach was cooked perfectly. DH's Mahi was served raw. Our waiter was good but the girl at the front messed up our reservations not once, but twice.

Never had a yelp account, but forced to create one today to review the trashiest place in SF! I was on the same table with Alistair N. ( reviewed earlier). Some pointers for the management to understand our frustration;\n1) One of the ladies at the table was half way thru the appetizers. The moronic waiter comes with the entree and asks her to finish the appetizer as he is holding the entree! She was literally forced to gulp it down. He refused to give her time and come back even though she politely asked him. If I call this guy demented, that would be an understatement!!\n2) Drinks - completely flat. Possibly the bar tender is another one of his breed. Asked him if he had a drink menu that had beers. Tells me it's better if I just hear the beer menu from him....can you believe the crap that this guy was talking?? Gives me couple of names and then stops to look at me. So I asked if you have Trumer - response comes back - \"I am not done yet\"!! And then he rattles off a few more names. More proof on how demented people think, act and behave. If a customer asks for something, it's either a yes or no. Don't give an opinion when not asked. And if you are itching to give one, then be pleasant in your demeanor and offer an intelligent choice. I am sorry, I am using the word intelligent for this man!!\n3) Comes to clear the table and drops forks and knives on my back. So I turned around and asked my wife to check if my jacket was soiled. Guess what - he picks up the knife and shows it in front of my face, tells me that was the \"only thing that fell on my back and it's not sharp\"!! The audacity of this creep to come with that response. \n\nWhile leaving the restaurant I tried to convey our feelings to the hostess at the front desk. Response was pretentious. - \"Too bad, hope you will come again\"!!\n\nHonestly I would be least surprised if this guy was high on something! \n\nFor the management- this guy should either be sent for rehab or back to school for training. From the world I come from (Financial Services), such unprofessional attitude leads to only one thing - getting fired. \n\nTourists or Locals - do not even go here for a drink. Nothing is worth here. Many better places - Waterbar, Epic, RN74, Chaya, Perry's, LaMar, Prospect, Ozumo...endless list. Great food, awesome drinks and excellent service. Been multiple times at all these places and never had a problem. \n\nThis was the first time at this place, definitely the last.

The hostess that sat us in the beginning led us to the back area, which I guess wasn't the patio where dogs were allowed. However, she didn't say anything to us, even though she clearly saw me with my dog and even commented on how cute she was. After she sat us, another staff member came over and informed us that dogs were not allowed in that area, and had us move to the patio. My mom got so upset with all the moving around that she wanted to leave and eat somewhere else. As a redeeming factor, one of the staff members brought out a dog bowl and filled it with water for Riley.\n-The price. If it weren't for the DAT menu, I probably wouldn't come here to eat, as it is otherwise quite expensive.\n\n-L.", "author": "Leeann C."}

Lowlights included improperly cooked brussel sprouts & limited vegan choices.\n\nThe Service - our waitress was very friendly but English was her 2nd language.

We figured it should be fine. Staff was busseling around and it was a full house but not overly crowded. We even overheard the staff saying that fireworks were see-able from the patio where we were sitting. \nFirstly, it took forever for the waiter to take our order. I understood that it was a holiday, so I didn't let it get me riled up. An hour from when we ordered, we get our food....and one wrong dish. We decide not to send it back because we don't want to wait. The food was okay. Mashed potatoes were bland, asparagus was undercooked, but the flat iron steak was very good. The glaze was delicious. \nWe foolishly ordered dessert. 20 minutes later it arrives. A piece of flavorless chocolate \"fondant\" (AKA: Cheesecake) and sticky toffee pudding (which is really cake and I had no idea). The caramel ice cream was lightly flavored but completely ruined by the giant piece of mint placed underneath. \nFireworks started before we even got our dessert. And the waiter lied in saying that fireworks were visible. It even took about 10 minutes for the waiter to even run my card.\n\nOverall, the food was bland and sub-par. Prices are astronomical compared to what the quality of food is. Service is S-L-O-W. \nI would never recommend this place to anyone. How they stay in business with so many other restaurants nearby astounds me.\n\nUPDATE: I was contacted by the manager today through Yelp, and was sorely disappointed. He apologized, only to then lather his message with excuses as to why they were slow and that I misunderstood what was said about the fireworks. \nTo me, this further lowered my opinion of this establishment. It was uncouth, and was generally insulting. When I hear a waiter say \"Yes, the fireworks are visible from here.\", there is no way to misunderstand that statement. On top of that, blaming the slow service (and wrong dish) on the holiday and on staff is a poor excuse, especially for someone claiming to be the manager. \n\nBecause of this interaction, I have re-rated from a 2 star to a 1 star rating.", "author": "Tessa T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-08", "description": "My friend and I went there for an early dinner on the 4th of July. It started off with a friendly hostess who told us the wait would be about 30 minutes and then invited us to sit on one of the comfortable sofas in the bar area. We wandered around wondering if we had to order or drinks at the bar or if someone would wait on us. Several servers looked at us and brushed by, ignoring my questioning looks. We finally flagged one down and he immediately got us seated and handed us a wine list (nice, but we didn't want wine).  He came back about 10 minutes later and took our order, then delivered our drinks a short while later with the check.  We sat for about 15 minutes enjoying our drinks with our credit card out to pay for the drinks but he never came back.\n\nWhen our table was ready the hostess came and got us. I asked if we could transfer the tab and she said, \"No, you can wait for your waiter to pay him. I'll hold your table.\" I looked around for him for a few minutes and tried to get someone to take the check. No one would. So I asked the hostess if she could just seat us and then run the check back for us. She said sure.  \n\nWe get seated at a great table upstairs with a great view - in a nearly empty dining room (so not sure why the wait...). And our friendly waiter comes by to give us menus and water. We ask him the specials and he said he just got there so didn't know them. I'd expect that after a 20+ minute wait, our waiter would be ready to serve us. \n\nThen our cocktail server comes rushing up to the table in a panicked voice, \"I was looking everywhere for you, I thought you left. I didn't get your tab.... where did you go?\" I explained that the hostess said she'd run it down to him and his response was, \"Oh, she's stupid. She didn't' do it. She doesn't do anything and I couldn't find you anywhere.\"  I assured him that I wasn't running out on my check and that calling a co-worker stupid wasn't nice and very unprofessional and I handed it to him with my credit card, it was still sitting on my table, where the hostess had left it.  By then our waiter was back and he apologized for the cocktail server's outburst. \n\nSo then during our meal our waiter goes on and on and on about it, oblivious to the fact that he was interrupting our conversation.  Then the GM came over and crouches down at the table to apologize for his cocktail server, saying it should have never happened, it should have been handled better, and then asks, \"Can you do me a favor?\" He hands me his business card and asks me, 'Please put this in an email and send it to me so I can document it. That will really help me deal with it.\"  He spent about 5 minutes at our table (too long, a simple apology would have been fine), admits his staff acted inappropriately and then asks me to do him a favor? Are you kidding me? We spent over $85 on 2 dinners (with no drinks) with tip and this is the level of service we get? They treat us unprofessionally and then I'm asked to do them a favor??? No offer to comp our salads or get complimentary dessert. Nothing. We just shook our heads. \n\nI ordered a Cesar salad that was bland. It even had fresh anchovies on it and it was bland. I had to wait 5 minutes for the cracked pepper I asked for and we didn't get our (delicious) warm sourdough bread until after our salads were gone (they said it wasn't ready - again, why the 20 minute wait for the table? Obviously they weren't ready for an early holiday rush).  For $12 I expected a really great Cesar dressing and some amazing fresh Parmesan cheese. It was just ok. \n\nI ordered a halibut dish ($29) as my main course. Halibut is supposed to flake off as you put your fork into it. It was practically raw in the middle; tough and gummy. I called the waiter over and his response, \"oh, you want it well done..?\" No, I want it cooked. When I got it back it was still not quite cooked enough in the middle, so I just left that part on the plate. \n\nDuring our meal the cocktail server guy came over and apologized and stood there forever going on and on and on making excuses and talking way too much. It was painful. \n\nSo overall - for a $40 per person dinner, the food was average at best, the service was painful, and they didn't have it together, they weren't ready. For a place with crisp white linens and servers in button up shirts and ties, you expect top-notch service. This was mediocre at best. And the GM should have definitely not asked me to do HIM a favor after a bad experience.", "author": "Carolyn H."}

We were strolling along the Embarcadero and it was around lunch time. It looked inviting, and we decided to try it. Loved it! \n\nSo when it turned out that we were going to be back in The City in mid-April, we decided to try Waterfront again. This time for dinner. \n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation. Were greeted very cordially when we checked in and escorted to our table. It wasn't very busy, but for some reason, our server seemed very hassled. My wife had questions about some of the specialty drinks on the menu. He seemed very frustrated about getting her info about the drinks. \n\n\"We've got a new, celebrity bartender. He's added a lot of new things to the menu. I don't really know what's in it . Yadda, yadda, yadda.\" \n\nOK, we ended up ordering things that we knew. Fine. \n\nThen we got to the food. Yum! We picked the restaurant for 3 reasons - the view, seafood, and our favorable lunch experience. The view was fab-fab-fab. The menu choices met our expectations for fresh fish and seafood. My wife ordered the prix fixe 'anniversary special.' It was Maine lobster served with a starter choice of soup or salad and a choice of dessert. So, do you need to go to San Francisco for Maine lobster? Maybe not. But she was very pleased by the meal. \n\nI started with a classic Caesar salad. It was good, but not remarkable. Then I had roasted fresh wild fish; my choice was escolar served with a saffron buerre blanc sauce. Fabulous. \n\nBy the end of the evening, our server warmed up to us. He struck up a casual conversation. Asked where we were from. Engaged in casual chit-chat. Linda thought he was just fishing for a tip. Maybe. \n\nSo my conclusion is this: Food = good. Service = mediocre. View = Great. Value = ok. \n\nAs I think about the restaurants that we've eaten at in SF, I don't think we'd make a point of returning to Waterfront.

The bartender was really nice, but the wait staff was very unfriendly. Asked for bread and was told we could have it after we ordered our meal, not before!  Then after we ordered had to ask for bread again 4 times before they brought it.  Simple things mean a lot.  Food was nothing special and not presented very well.  Will not make the mistake of eating here again.  Obviously a place for out of town tourists who do not know the good places to eat on the water.  I agree with Jessica P, if I could give this place a 0 I would.  Do not spend your money here, whether is is $10K or $10.  Do not go here.

We were in town for a vacation and after walking by the this place on several previous business trips that I was on solo I suggested we try it.  It was a Saturday night and we had been out walking and were wearing jeans.\n\nI was concerned that we weren't dressed appropriately but relaxed when I saw that most of the other guests were dressed worse.  We were seated right next to the windows upstairs with a view of the bridge.  The food was nice--nothing special but the fish was high quality and well prepared.  It was truly an evening to remember, so why only four stars?\n\nThe waiter was an absolute snob.  They all were.  My husband is a great tipper--he's always really appreciative of restuarant staff.  I used to be in foodservice so I'm more discerning but always assume the best in people and leave 15%.  Let's just say that when he left 10% that night I was shocked becuase he never does that.  It takes a lot to offend me, but being treated like a white trash tourist (which I'm surely not!) will surely do it every time.", "author": "Sally D."}

Even better, it was by a window!\n\nWe were taken care of by 2 servers and while they were good at what they do, they were both a little reserved and borderline snobbish.  Any jokes or attempts at lighthearted banter from us was met with either a blank stare or a courtesy laugh, but whatever, they got our orders right and kept our wine glasses filled.  I really liked that the bread guy came around regularly too and kept us well stocked with yummy sourdough rolls and real butter.\n\nI had the $40 prix fixe dinner...I decided on a summer salad with citrus vinaigrette, a 1.5  lb Maine lobster, sauteed veggies and chocolate fondant for desert.   The lobster was really, really good, with lots of sweet meat and thankfully, finished on the grill because I can't stomach plain boiled lobster.  The veggies were just average but the fondant desert was delicious.  \n\nIt's nice that they have their own valet too, saving us from using a public lot and walking a mile.

We called for reservations so that we could sit in the first row of tables right over the water.  However they sat us in the back row over the water.  The funny part was that I noticed two open tables, but didn't bother to say anything to our waiter.  I understand restaurants get busy over the weekend, but they were out of everything.  For instance Dungeness crab, soul, lobster, steak etc.  I mean c'mon there must be some way to get an order in that morning when you are that close to the bay.  The first batch of bread we received was old, hard, and cold.  I thought maybe that was how they served it.  When the next batch came, it was soft, warm and delicious.  I ordered a cream of mushroom soup for an appetizer and it was plain and tasteless as can be.  My girlfriend ordered a Caesar salad, which was a small portion.  It looked and tasted disgusting.  Our waiter was somewhat attentive, but she could have provided better service.  I work as a server in a restaurant so I know it can be hard at times.  We had already ordered our entrees, but we were so disappointed that we told the General Manager that this was not what we were expecting and left.  With a prime location like that, they have some polishing up to do or else someone will have to take over and turn it around.

I had their anniversary dinner special that was a three course meal.  I choose the butternut squash soup, lobster, and finshed off with a chocolate fondant.  As I waited for my food I had a glass of sangiovese wine which I don't really find in most restaurants so I was excited to get it since it's one of my favorite reds.  So on to the food:\n\nThe butternut squash soup was just ok to me.  I make this at home as well but it tasted different.  Theirs tasted very sweet especially with the apple sauce which kind of threw me off.  I thought it'd be a little savory and creamy like the one I make but their's wasn't so I didn't enjoy it too much.  I had to add salt and pepper to even out the overly sweet soup.\n\nNext came the lobster which was great.  Large and succulant. It was perfect.  I didn't really even need to use the butter since it was so creamy and buttery already.  I even used some of my left over bread to pick up the juices left from it to get every single last morsel left. Yum...\n\nThen ending with the chocolate fondant was amazing.  My bf put it best when he said it tasted like eating a See's candy with a fork.  So rich and chocolatey but not overpowerling sweet...more on a rich thick flavor.  Very much a piece of heaven for a chocolate lover, which I'm not reallly but I did enjoy it.\n\nOverall the experience and meal was great.  I didn't like the soup but everything else was great.  Huge wine list, and seafood done well.  I took a bite of my bf's cioppino and it was also amazing.  I came in with low expectations since majority of yelpers gave bad reviews but I can personally say they surpassed my expectations.  It is a bit pricey for some dishes but if you did the 3 course pre-fixe meal like most of us did we were satisfied...especially the lobster anniversary deal their having at the moment!

She went back to the stairs where the server was waiting and after a few minutes of animated discussion, she came back with the OK of the server, I guess. We sat by the window. The servers came to greet us with a grim look on his face. He looked very unhappy. We ordered some wine.  I was told that the wine I ordered was not available. The server seems to be very frustrated. No big deal, I ordered something else. Food was ordered and when the oysters were served, I ask their origin, the waiter seems confused, and then said something, inaudible and left. Main course came along a while later and when they served my father, half of his French fries went on his lap. My steak was over cooked and my sister's scallops were barely cooked. I started to wander if I made a mistake by coming to the restaurant. Then, a gentleman, nicely dressed, came along and ask us with a French accent if everything was fine.  Of-course, I explained the situation. In a NY minute, he brought me a steak perfectly cooked, as well as my sister's scallops done faultlessly. Everyone was impressed and very happy.

The busboy provided reasonable service but the waiter should've be fired! After we sat down the waiter came to take the drink order. My friend said nothing for him only water. I turned toward the waiter and said \"i'll take...\" and the waiter just turned and walked away. Okay that was wired. Then we waited and waited and water never came and the waiter never came back either. We eventually had to grap one of the busboy to get us some water and bread. Since then the busboy did took care of us and refilling our water and bread while we waited patiently for the waiter to come take our food order. After nearly 40 minutes my friendly went to him. We can't believe the excuse that he give for not servicing us. He was waiting for us to stop talking. REALLY? Seriously!!! Finally he came and again he repeated himself that he didn't want to interrupt our conversation. for 40 minutes????Other than he took the order he did nothing or checking to see if we needed anything else. \n\nOther than the waiter the rest of the restaurant experience was fine. We made reservation but arrived early. They seated us right away. We both ordered fish - salmon and halibut. Both dishes were cooked perfectlly. They were moist and tasty. We also shared the dessert sampler. That was really good too.\n\nOverall I am so disappointed for the experience eventhough the food was good. Afterall it is Saturday night dining in an expensive restaurant plus parking is also expensive. To have service like this, it's so NOT worth it.", "author": "Celia M."}

This is because we had no food at Waterfront after sitting for one and a half hours for lunch today.  Allow me to explain.\n\nThe lunch began normally.  We were seated promptly, drink orders taken, specials explained, and food orders taken.  One of the members of our party of nine came about forty five minutes after we were seated (work is a harsh mistress) and tried to order some food.  At this point, we discovered that the order for our table was never put in to the kitchen.\n\nIt turns out that our waiter, who seemed fine when helping us out, suddenly became sick and left the restaurant without telling anyone, and also without putting our order in.  I found this completely bizarre; if he left without saying anything, how did the management know he was sick?  And if he did tell management that he was sick, why wouldn't management try to follow up on the tables he was working?  The fact that we discovered this failure through complete chance, i.e., our late dining companion, is unacceptable.\n\nSo a new waitress comes by the table to retake our orders.  Not only is she completely unapologetic, she is complaining about how she was called in early to work.  Uh, right . . .  The person heading the lunch politely asks if she could bring out some appetizers for the table, seeing how we had been sitting around for an hour with no food.  The waitress replied that the only thing she could do was put in our order as quickly as possible.  Uh, what?\n\nHead lunch person is unhappy, and goes to talk to the owner of this establishment.  The owner was very apologetic and said that the kitchen and staff would make sure we would be served promptly.  Cool.\n\nWe wait for another half hour.  Nothing has come out, not even fucking lobster chowder that one only has to ladle out of a pot into a bowl, and then serve.  Nothing.  During the entire time, we have one drink refill, and only because we asked.  And the person refilling spilled iced tea all over the feet of two people and a Marc Jacobs bag.  Said person didn't even say a word of apology.  After this half hour, we inquire as to the status of our food.  \"The kitchen has just gotten started.\"  Thanks, but no thanks.  The owner again was very apologetic for the delay and understood why we were walking out.  Our waitress, not a single word of anything.\n\nThanks for stealing an hour and a half of my life.

Our family went here at 6:15 on a Friday night with reservations and before they were busy. Our waiter, Christophe, was one of the most aloof, disinterested and lacking of personality that any of us had ever experienced. He seriously acted like it was the last place on earth he wanted to be, wouldn't say a word unless asked and even then, said as little as possible. We waited an extra long time to even get waited on, and again it was no busy. We had to ask for bread. We told him we wanted to order wine, said he'd get a wine menu, which we already had, then walked away and didn't come back. He walked by twice before we flagged him down again and told him we wanted wine. My husband ordered the soup special as a first course. He told us it was a soup with chicken and when it was delivered it was a tomato soup. The server assisting him said he thought they were out of the soup special (at 6:30?) and called Christophe over. Christophe just said oh we don't have any other.  So I guess he assumed my husband would just take whatever they brought. No apology, nothing. My husband order a med well $50 steak and it came well done. I got petrale sole which was average at best-zero flavor with a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach- again zero flavor. The rest of our party was satisfied with the food but felt it wasn't worth the price. For dessert we ordered a sampler plate and rather than dropping it off and explaining what each was he just set it on the table and walked away. No offer of coffee or any other comment.  This was a very disappointing experience!  Which was sad because we had heard wonderful things about it.

Don't know about all of the negative reviews below, but the food was great and the service better.\n\nI had the Cold Smoked Salmon, the Waterfront Cioppino, and the Strwaberry Rubarb.  The sauce on the salmon is a little heavy for my taste, but overall a great dish.  The Cioppino was absolutely phenomenal.   There is tons of seafood in it: crab, prawns, fish, and clams.  Definitely worth the price of the dish.  The Rubarb was good but nothing spectacular.\n\nOthers at the table had the Spinach Salad, the Chicken Escalope, and the Chocolate Fondant.  The salad is interesting in that the vinaigrette is not a simple olive oil base.  The Chicken Escalope, interestingly enough, looks like scrambled eggs but tastes good.  The fondant is very heavily chocolate- good for those with a love of chocolate.\n\nService was great and view was ok.  It's the same view you get while standing on the Embaracadero (which means no Golden Gate Bridge views are possible, so don't know why someone's complaining about that).  The meal is pricey but the prix fixe menus are great choices, and when you walk into the place you know you're going to spend a good chunk of change, so it's to be expected.\n\nA final note: they have a happy hour from 3-7 M-S and it looks like the menu is pretty decent.

Not a huge deal, because it was only a mix up in the sides, but still not a good showing.  They also allow cigar smoking in the outdoor patio - at lunch no less, which I find objectionable.  \n\nBack to the food... my party of five all selected from the fresh grilled fish / seafood list.  We very much enjoyed the Escobar, the Ahi, the Scallops and the Sand Dabs.  All were grilled to perfection with a selection of sauces of complement.

After we were seated and ordered our food, after we got out appetizers but right before our entrees another server brought us stale bread with freshly taken out of the freezer butter; neither was edible. I ordered the scallops with the Serrano Aioli sauce, the scallops were barely grilled and were completely raw. When I confronted the waiter about It I had two remaining and he said no problem. The plate only had 5 scallops on it in the first place. He comes back with a small plate with just two more scallops. It was a bit shocking because usually restaurants are supposed to replace the entire plate or take off the total, but whatever. The sauce that the scallops came with tasted like melted plastic and mayonnaise mixed together. The actually scallops had no seasoning, no salt and pepper or anything. They were quite disgusting. My friends got the fish and chips which they said, \"Tastes disgusting and nothing different from what we could have gotten from pier 39 for half the price.\" The prawn salad my other friend got was pretty good actually from what she said. The thing that makes this place the worst is that after I went home I was felling quite sick, which I thought was from walking so much since I don't have a car in SF. But realized that I got food poisoning and when I confronted my friends that had the fish and chips they said the same thing. It was horrible and did not expect and establishment that states itself as a place of class would have that happen. By far the worst restaurant experience.

We were in the city Saturday night for a party. We tried to get a table at the Slanted Door, but without reservations, there was no way. The Waterfront sat us in about 10 minutes. Getting a seat that quickly on weekend evening without reservations is probably a bad sign for a restaurant that wants to be taken seriously. \n\nThe service was ok, but our food took a while to arrive. Hard to say if that's because of the kitchen or the waiter. The price to portion ratio is ridiculous. My wife had scallops and shrimp, I had the salmon. Both were overcooked. \n\nShould you find yourself nearby and stuck for a late dinner, walk down the Embarcadero to Pancho Villa Taqueria. You'll get a great dinner at a great price.

My wife is Brazilian and she ordered an Orange Caipirinha.  It had absolutely no barring on a Brazilian Caipirinha.  For $10 drinks I expected more.\n\nNow to the food.  The theme was everything was very good, but the portions were small and the dishes were expensive.  We started off with a crab cake appetizer.  There were 2 crab cakes and they were pretty small.  Very tasty crab cakes in a wonderful sauce, but $15?  For dinner two of my party got the Escolar and I the tuna.  Once again very small dishes but everything was cooked to perfection.

The place was frightfully empty so I can't figure out the bizarre service.\nWe sat at the bar which certainly did not seem to impress the bartender.  He eventually got around to dealing with us, but was never happy about it.\nHe did take the time to make a very large, very cold martini glass full of vodka for one of the other servers who pounded it before going back to his tables.  Hey, I used to drink when I was a server and having a bad night too, but never so blatantly.  I mean, he sat at the bar and knocked it back in 3 or 4 swallows.\nThe food was mediocre.  The Brussels sprouts tasted way too allyl isothiocyanate-y if you know what I mean.  I HATE that flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-31", "description": "I've eaten here 15 or 20 times over the years. In the past I found the food to be good, and the location and decor is great.  Its a tad pricey - so I usually reserved it for business lunches, often with out of town guests. I've also recommended it to quite a few friends.\n\nMy favorite dish by a long shot is their lobster risotto.  At its best it us a sublime mix of rice, lobster, enriched broth with a great lemon overtone. One of those dishes you think about for a while and pine to try again.\n\nToday my wife and I were going to catch a quick lunch but decided that since it was such a lovely day we would drive down to the Embarcadero and get the risotto. To say it was a comedy of errors would be an overstatement, but they were definitely out of gear. Our waiter was very pleasant, but he admitted it was his second day on the job.  He did do a very nice job of fixing our tippy table.  \n\nWe ordered a beet salad to share, my wife got the lobster risotto, and I got the daily special which was the lobster risotto with fresh scallops.\n\nI ordered two glasses of white wine - an unusual actually white (not blush) Grenache for the wife, and a dry Riesling for me.  I was a bit surprised that by the Riesling since it was actually off dry - it had a bit of  residual sugar and a  slightly dried fruit taste. Probably not the best choices (a Sauv. Blanc would have been better), but I like to try interesting wines.\n\nService was spotty at best.  The bread guy showed up, and never came back.  More troubling, the food was brought out by runners who had no idea who ordered what. I'll admit that this is a pet peeve for me, but we are not talking about Denny's here. This is a pretty expensive restaurant. and they don't understand the basic step of numbering the seats at each table so a runner doesn't have to ask \"Who had the crab cakes?\" \n\nThe beet salad was the first real letdown. The microgreens were great, the beets tasty, and the shaved cheese on top was great.  But the dressing was actually just oil. There was no acid - vinegar or citrus - to balance the fat.  A small thing but it made definitely took away from the dish.\n\nAnyway, here is where things go downhill.  My wife's lobster risotto came out. My dish didn't.  Eventually I tried hers, and it was nothing like it had been the last 5 or 6 times I had it.  It was gummy, overcooked, and too cheesy.  There was very little lemon to balance the richness. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't a $28 lunch entree either.  \n\nMy order was forgotten.  After a bit the hostess came over and asked if I was still waiting for my dish. I said \"yes\" and she took off to see to it.  A small plate of (excellent) smoked salmon appeared with no explanation.  It was a \"tide-me-over\" until they got my dish out. A nice gesture to be sure, but it would have been better if the waiter or one of the hosts delivered it with an explanation, rather than just having a runner pop it on my table.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later my dish finally appeared. The underlying risotto was the same as my wife's.  The scallops were clearly extremely fresh and of the best quality. They were, unfortunately, extremely salty and a dash undercooked.  I also got a big mouthful of cold gloppy risotto on one bite, which pushed me over the edge and I just slid the dish away from me.\n\nA different host came over to enquire and I was honest with him. He was very polite and apologetic.  Indeed, while the meal was a bit of  a travesty food-wise, the folks handled it well and with good humor. I guess it helped that I was in a good mood and wasn't pissy about it.\n\nThey offered to bring a new entr\u00e9e, but I was pretty well finished. We did take them up on a complementary desert (they actually offered for both of us but we split one not wanting to be piggish.)  The almond cake was very tasty and had a great crumb, but was a bit dry and would have done well with a sabayon or other sauce (there was some whipped cream which helped.)  But as I said, the cake was extremely tasty and I didn't leave any behind. \n\nOh, and the first cup of coffee was cold. The second cup was fine.\n\nI didn't scrutinize my bill, but I'm sure they took something off for my trouble, in addition to the free desert. For two glasses of wine, a salad, two entrees, a desert and a cup of coffee, with tax, they charged us $80.  I rounded up to $100, wanting to be a good sport about it.\n\nSo, what to make of this?  Was the meal worth $100 with tip?  Not a chance.  They clearly messed up (the host told us the chef had taken a day off for a change - which helps explain things.) but they also did their best to remedy the situation.\n\nI'll give them another shot, if only because I love that lobster dish so much. But this is a case of two strikes and you are out. If things don't' improve a lot the next time will be our last.  Pity", "author": "hOWARD y."}

If the new chef is the reason I loved it despite the reviews here, this place's ratings should shoot up.\n\nI had mussels.  They were pretty darn good.  The linguine with clams was just right and the shrimp with some sort of meat wrapped around it appetizer was just ok.  But that's not what this review's about.  \n\nWe ordered the soup of the day: a salsify and dungeness crab soup that I am still thinking about.  I dunno if I ever tried salsify before but this soup was like heaven in a bowl.  Kind of a nutty creamy soup with very little crab, but the flavor was out of control delish.  Seafoody but also kinda nutty.  \n\n(It reminds me of that soup my family ate several decades ago after the rained out Anne Murray concert at Busch Gardens, but no one wants to hear an Anne Murray story.)\n\nPrice is a little steep but if you can afford it, get some kickass seafood here.

It is semi-outdoors because there are \"walls\" to block the wind and heaters so it's still warm in there.

Me, my mom and dad, shared the Seafood Pasta but ordered it without any mussels in it. It was Delicious, there was not that much crab or lobster but the shrimps and clams were perfect, and the pasta was delicious because it soaked up all the delicious sauce and juices of the seafood. 5 star seafood pasta man, I'm telling you. By the way the White Wine lemon garlic broth was not  garlicky at all, it was the center of the dish.\nMy brother had the pan seared chicken, it was just as good.

WHile waiting the bf and i decided to get a drink just to chill out.  I ordered something from the cocktail menu and was persuaded to get a \"surprise\" cocktail from the over enthusiastic bartender.  it was a friday night, i was tired, and it was nice to have someone make a choice for me...i mean what can go wrong right?  hahahah.....i mean it might have been good for you martini lovers...but i personally have not aquired the taste for it yet.   so sadly i did not enjoy my friday night booze......sigh....\n\nWe started off with the clam chowder and duck confitt salad...from what i heard the duck confitt tasted like salted preserved anchovies??? wtf....ok fine....it was still somewhat edible....i on the other hand had clam chowder which was a lil disappointing......there was so much cream and liquidy in the soup that i didn't see the chowder!  The clams that we did get from the soup had tons of sand left....so it wasn't thorougly cleansed...i expect this from a cheap chinese resturant....not some fancy smancy resturant that is known for their seafood.....\n\nthe salmon tasted like any other.....actually the BF's makes it way better.....=T\n\nAlthough the entree was very generous....it was not what i expected.  i had the rib something which pretty much tasted like stewed meat.  i was a bit disappointed, it came with the cross breed of brocoli and asparagus which was bitter...and some mashed potatoes which was yum...\n\nthe only thing that made the meal worthy of three stars is the the crab mashed potatoe and garlic fries... Yum Yum.........thats it.  Even the complimentary bread was horrible.  uGH.\n\ndesert was aite.  it was chocolatey and rich but it didnt hit the spot.  the sorbet was SOUR ! so i guess thats a good thing.\n\nOVER ALL i was really disappointed...especially when we had to pay $7 towards health benefits to the waiters and waitresses? WTF IS that ???  shouldn't it be coming out of the resturants pocket? i think it is just too fuckin ridicoulous to charge customers for this KIND  of service.  i mean im all for employees health and such but the resturant needs to STOP Benig so cheap and start paying their workers!", "author": "Shirley H."}

A bit chilled and all shopped out, we headed out of the masses of shoppers and out to a quieter area for dinner.\n\nWe figured we would pick a random restaurant along Embarcadero would be good. Lo and behold, we ended up picking the Waterfront Restaurant. We haven't been there and were curious to see what sumptuous food awaited for us. \n\nThe location is gorgeous. We were seated almost immediately against the windows near the outside patio. A gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge in the evening and a server who was very polite and attentive to us. We ordered the seared Ahi Tuna, a side of the crab mashed potatoes, garlic french fries, and a half dozen fresh oysters on the half shell as appetizers. \n\nIt was a great evening for us to catch up on what's going in our busy lives. The oysters came out first and were so fresh and delicious. Our eyes lit up as we savored each one.  Then our main meal came out. The Ahi Tuna was grilled rare (just the way I like it!) and the soy wasabi sauce was very tasty! The crab mashed potatoes were my favorite thing out of everything we ordered. Fluffy and light with crab evenly distributed in every mouthful. MMMM. Deliciousness!\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic evening and we had a wonderful time. Of course, the restaurant was more on the pricey side but since we hardly hang out anymore, it was worth the experience.", "author": "Julia W."}

The view was beautiful, they stuck us on a spot where it was secluded from other people, we were looking out to the bay where the bay bridge was very visible and shining...The view was wonderful and so was my date :) Heh..\n\nThe waitress wasn't meeting to par, however.  I was hard to get my order across, and it sort of distracted us from what was going on.  Also, there were about 4 waiters bussing our table!  So, our table was almost always cleaned, cleared, filled, and refilled.  Yes.  We ordered the crab and lobster, and both were all right.  I'd prefer to get some from pier 39 and watch the men crack the crab for us then dip it in butter.  I got some cajun sauce, and it wasn't that great.  I stole my date's butter instead :)  The good side, since it was so empty that night, when I made my order very particular and specific (I wanted to substitute something for mashed potatoes) I got what I wanted, and my date got an extra side as well.  Maybe it was because there was a communication problem...Maybe I'll just get a burger or steak next time.\n\nOur bill came about to be $180 for the two of us.  Now, THAT is not worth it.  I advise those who LOVE view over food to come here.  This is very  much a touristy restaurant, so it's nice for a once in a life time sort of meal, but other than that, there are plenty of other restaurants around the Embarcadero where wining, dining, and viewing are just as wonderful.\n\nLastly, a pier/dock that goes over the water in between pier 7 and 5 allows you to take a nice stroll and take wonderful photos of the bay bridge and old fashioned boats that are docked near by.  It's conveniently next to the restaurant :)", "author": "Kristin O."}

I ordered the sole filet and my husband ordered the taco. The filet was bland, portion size was ok.

It was quite bland and not hot. When i got it there was a layer/film on top...as if it had been sitting out for a while. My boyfriend made this soup much better at home. His tasted more fresh also. He ordered the calm chowder which also came out with that top layer/film and was not hot. Didn't taste terrible...but it was the first time I've had a sweet clam chowder.\n\nHe ordered the fried sole for his main dish. We expected it to be crispy but it was not. (Points for the waiter who asked if he wanted them to de-bone tableside.) He had to order a side dish of spinach because it didn't come with any sides. Spinach was average - garlic sauted .\n\nMy main dish was the braised short ribs. I'm used to the meat just falling off because it's so tender. This one was full of fat and I still had to use my knife. Seasoning not particularly tasty. The potatoes we average. I did not like the sauce. The best part of this meal was the crispy baby carrots.\n\nWe opted out of ordering dessert after all these disappointments.\n\nThen, to top it off, we got a bill which included an added 4% for the workers healthcare.

Also, throughout the entire night, it seemed like their main goal was to rush through the service so that we could leave and get out of their restaurant.  This seems strange and rude to us considering that they restaurant was pretty much empty.\n\nThe food was average at best.  I tried the scallops and prawns, crab cakes, black angus NY steak and the crab mashed potatoes.  \n\nScallops and prawns:  As a seafood restaurant, I don't think their seafood was as fresh as some other seafood restaurants that I've been to.  The scallops were better than average, but the prawns were similar to prawns that you can get at any average seafood restaurant.\n\nCrab cakes:  The texture was a little bit dry, but the crab seemed fresh and the taste was good.  The sauce was a little spicy but good.\n\nBlack angus NY steak:  The quality of the meat was hard to determine since they overcooked it.  We asked for medium, but it came back well-done.  The pommes frites that came with it was very well done and was a good compliment to the steak.\n\nCrab mashed potatoes:  Definitely one of the highlights of the night.  I've never had something like this, so it was a nice new side dish that tasted great.\n\nOverall, I think the worst part of the night was the service.

I had seen the menu outside before, but didn't plan on going there due to the high prices. We were seated right away on the patio, which we were given a choice as to where we liked. \nThank goodness they have glass surrounding the patio, which helps cut the wind a bit, although it happened to be a very windy day, so things were blowing around a bit. The view of the bay is quite nice from there, some folks faced the water view directly, and we had a side view, which was fine for us. I'm a vegetarian, so I found the menu to be quite limited for my needs, but I was happy with my pear & manchego cheese salad, and the mushroom/asparagus risotto. I ordered the appetizer portion, which was generous. I also had a mimosa, which wasn't listed on the cocktail menu, and it turned out to cost $12, which was too steep for me. The risotto is offered in two sizes, for $12 or $24. My dining companion wanted to have the sole sandwich, but our waiter told her they are out of the sole, and two other types of fish, so she was frustrated by that. He just shrugged and said that they don't get their full shipments on Sunday. In retrospect, I don't know if that's an acceptable answer, really. Why don't they stock enough fish, it is a seafood restaurant, after all! \nShe settled for the fish & chips, reluctantly. It looked pretty good, she seemed to like it. As for the service otherwise, our waiter was nice and pleasant, and gave us extra time to take our orders. He seemed perhaps a tad aloof, not sure why. Later on, some woman came by to take my plate and then I ordered a cappucinno from her. I don't know why our waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert or coffee. He brought the check after, and said it's the end of his shift, in a way that I felt was just a touch impatient maybe. I don't think I will be back to the Waterfront again.

The first was with my mom- we had apps and I had a fish entree that I really enjoyed.  The second time was last Friday night with my boyfriend.  We had to catch a movie so had only apps and cocktails.  The crabcake was good.  The shrimp app wrapped in prosciutto was a little overdone and dry but the sauce accompanying it was tasty.  Nice chowder.  But the service both times was excellent.  The chef came out to talk about the fish the first time- very cool and sweet.  \n\nAnd of course, the views.  Last Friday I was happy as the clams adorning my chowder.  With my dreamy man looking at the bay and eating apps and drinking cocktails- what more could a girl want.  \n\nBummed about the bad reviews and I wish I saw this place packed- \nI really dig this place.  \n\nOh, boyfriend just told me to mention they have shitty toilet paper.

I had made reservations for mothers day brunch a month ahead of time and requested outside seating and even confirmed the day prior to mothers day. The day of, to my surprise my party is sat inside, when I addressed the problem with the waiter he and the manager walk over to say that there is no room for outside sitting and that outside sitting is granted on a first come basis. When I point out a open table large enough for my party and ask to be seated there they contradict themselves and reply by stating that it was a reserved table.... Makes no sense right! It seems like a case of discrimination to me... What's the point of making reservations and having the option of requesting a specific seating area if you are not going to be granted your request? To make matters worse when we asked for a booster chair they claimed not to have any although i specifically stated that two children were in my party when the reservation was made. The manager did not respond to this dilemma in the best way. He was rude, did not even try to accommodate any of our request, and acted as though it was our fault for not having outside seating/ booster seat . Based on how he addressed this situation it is clear that the restaurant has hired a manager who is not compitant in handling business conflicts such as this and could use some extensive management training on implementing best business practice and customer satisfaction.\n\nWARNING: Manager (of middle eastern decent) CAN NOT deliver on best practice for customer service.", "author": "Steph S."}

It was hot on that Saturday and the night was absolutely clear and warm. We were seated on the corner of the outer room and we have an unobstructed view of the lit bay bridge and the rising moon. So romantic.....\n\nWe ordered the crab cake as appetizer and it came out amazing fast, probably a minute after they gave us the bread. You can just tell that it was something that they made ahead and just heated through. The presentation wasn't too exciting but I liked it regardless because of they were really generous with the crab meat. BTW, after eating the grilled bread from Pisces in Sunset, plain old bread will never make it anymore. I had the Seabass with lemon caper sauce. I could care less about the sauce because the fish was better by itself. The crab mashed potatoes were pretty interesting. I loved the texture of crab meat in mashed potatoes but I thought it could've been more flavorful. My bf's angus steak was humungo. It came with garlic fries and bacon string beans. I can't stand the taste of bloody red meat so I didn't try it. \n\nMost of the waiters there were older folks that had a hard time remember what the special of the night was. It was a bit slow for them to get to our table although there were people in only 1/4 of the restaurant. The whole place wasn't as fancy as I imagined it to be. The food was definitely a bit disappointing. The best thing of the night was being able to spend time w/ my bf. That in itself is priceless.", "author": "Annie C."}

The lobster risotto was the star of the dinner, it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, full of chunks and claw meat, I mean we almost fought over it (ordered as an appetizer).  Calamari was so tender and the batter so light and crunchy, delicious.  I have always hated mussels, they're too chewy and fishy tasting for me, but my husband insisted I try one....loved it.

It must be another case of people expecting more than what is delivered. I come here a lot with my family when we have out of town guests visiting. The location, the decor, and the view are all amazing. As far as the food goes, it is your run-of-the-mill upscale seafood/steak restaurant. I'm not a seafood person, so it's possible that Waterfront offers worse seafood than you might expect from a place literally on the water. But the overall experience is very pleasant - dark comfortable dining room, cool upstairs area with fireplace, but sometimes a bit noisy. The steak and chicken never disappoint, and you can't really go wrong with the appetizers. But that's another thing - perhaps the menu is too safe. So I guess you're paying for a nice dining experience and reliably good (not great) food - it's San Francisco, get used to it!\n\nNice Embarcadero surf'n'turf restaurant for the spendy tourist.", "author": "Alexander M."}

But I was told that the latest I could reserve was 8:45, which was earlier than my party was able to be there. The person to whom I spoke would not explain why this was so. We figured there was some anomaly in their reservation system and decided to go ahead and show up at 9:15 as walk-ins. When we entered, however, the hostess said that the kitchen was already cleaning up. I pointed out that their posted hours extended until 10:30 - more than an hour later.

It was a perfect time to have oysters and happy hour. We came here and my friend and I wanted to stay outside.  We found 2 chairs without a table outside overlooking the bay.  We approached a waiter to request if a chair can be pulled for us. We would settle with this just to stay outside. To our surprise, another waiter instead, let's call him Mustafa, gave us an angry look in his eyes look and with his voice raised, \" I will not pull a chair for you!\" he didn't say it once but twice and even louder. We were caught by surprise and felt harassed!  So we asked for his name, he said he will not give his name to us. It was getting embarrassing for me and especially my friend who was celebrating her birthday. It was my treat. We asked fellow waiters not the first two who belittled us for a manager to help us rectify the situation. Well, Mustafa followed us as we approached the manager to explain our request.  Mustafa circled around us and again, repeated what he said...again! He won't leave us We heard him instructing the \"manager\" not to listen to us and instead not serve us. This is bad for it was getting uncomfortable. The bad waiter acted very authoritative than a hospitable server. His angry eyes still following us as we walked outside to look for a table. He felt like a stalker ready to attack me and my friend. To cut a long story short. We still stayed cause the manager got us a table, we tried to enjoy the last hour of the happy hour, talk to the owner..Mr. Al...Unfortunately nothing was being done.  We even paid our bill fully left a tip for the other waiters just to show were fair to the other waiters who were very apologetic. Conclusion? We will never come back, ever!

What restaurant books a party of 100 people and then fails to notify the management.   We were then offered another table outside; we moved.  Got our appetizers and then had a group of people come and stand in front of our table leaning over the Seafront railing, rowdy and loud;  waiting to see the Blue Angels.  Once again we asked to see the Manager, this time another manager came over and told us an entirely different story of why we were asked to move from our first table.  He again was very apologetic and asked if we would like to move inside upstairs.  At this point my husband was furious and wanted to leave;  I was really looking forward to a nice meal overlooking the Bay and watching the Blue Angels.  So, we said we'd move.  After about 20 minutes;  yet another employee comes up to our table and asks if we are ready to order!  Really, again!\n\nWe left. Interesting when we were leaving a party of six stopped my husband and told him what disappointing service they had.  Their meals took over 1/2 hour to get to them and they characterized the waiter as arrogant and stupid.  Not the way I would want one of my employees to be characterized.  What a significant decline in service from their earlier years.  Now, this is by far one of the worst service restaurants in San Francisco.  Yes, the view is lovely however, neither the food or the view is worth the disgusting level of service.\n\nThere are so many other fantastic restaurants along the waterfront that respect their customers, value their business and have the desire to make things right when problems arise.   Not only have their lost my personal business, they've lost my corporate business as well.   \n\nStephanie K.B.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

It was really \"fresh\" not so much \"smokey\" as I would like it. Beet salad is ok, nothing wow. The best thing next to the frothy drink was the sole entree. Buttery and melts in your mouth.

I understand why you might end up here but I certainly wouldn't seek this place out as a destination.  C'mon...it's totally a tourist setting and it's not really located near anything exciting or noteworthy.  OOOOH! It's got a view of the bridge!  So do a lot of other places with better food or you could simply walk along the waterfront itself which makes for a more romantic evening IMO.\nSo how did I end up here?  Simple. The Sunset Boat Party was docked next door and, while waiting for my chocolate 'shrooms to kick in, I decided to partake in Ryan W.'s pizza before boarding the Drug Boat.  Said pizza (the seafood/salami kind) was so oily that it was akin to the Exxon Valdez spill.  Seriously, I think I saw relief crews start lining up ready to take care of local wildlife inadvertently harmed in the consumption of the pizza.  There was also the curious choice of combining shrimp and salami.  Definitely not kosher, which means dick to me because I'm not Jewish and if I was I wouldn't restrict myself because I believe that if there is a god then that entity wouldn't give a damn what food I was shoving down my pie-hole so long as I made the appropriate gestures of respect while doing so.  In any case, the shrimp and salami did NOT have what I would consider a harmonious marriage of taste.  I think that their marriage is one that counseling couldn't save and they need to just go their separate ways.  I also found the service to be lacking and Ryan W. had to get napkins and plates himself before we were able to eat.  It also took him an unreasonable amount of time to close out his tab and I watched the bartender serve several other people AFTER Ryan W. had requested his check.  \nIn short, I probably would have given this place a higher rating had my drugs kicked in because you would HAVE TO be trippin' to think this place is good.", "author": "Jill D."}

This restaurant has a better bay view than Slanted door. It was really empty on a Saturday night and the reservation could be made on the same day.\n\n\nIt was a shame that the waiter poured a half glass of champagne on my guest's shoulder.....He finally apologised after my guest told him that she was really upset, but we were seated at the same wet table and we were still charged for the full amount of champagne.\n\nI am not accusing the small mistake anybody would make. But I believe that in order to be a great restaurant, the management should make sure that the customers go out of restaurant feeling satisfied even after an accident. So we decided to see how the manager handles the situation.  We didn't want to cut the tip for the waiter and asked if  the manager would deduct the amount of the waisted champagne ($64 dollars a bottle...!!!) from the bill. The manager was really aggressive and arrogant. She kept saying that we received the piece of cake to compensate the loss (we thought we got a tiny piece of cake on the house because it was my another guest's birthday and the cake came with a candle on it. We were so full but ate it out of politeness and it was tiny anyway.) They offered free cleaning service which wouldn't have helped my guest since we were headed to the next venue and she was leaving SF the next morning. The manager was not apologetic nor sincere at all. She said something to herself angrily and walked away and brought the same check back for us to sign!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy guests were from Paris and Tokyo and they were shocked at the service level of the restaurant....I was sad and embarrassed. I picked up the over $300 bill and even tipped the waiter. I just didn't want to stay there any longer. Will never go there again. Maybe, if that manager gets fired, I might consider going back.\n\nMy advice is, \"If you have guests who are important to you, don't take a risk to dine at this restaurant.\" \n\nIt's a shame that there are not so many great seafood restaurants in the city. I like \"Aqua\"'s friendly and professional service. I don't like the american size meals at Scoma's but the both waiters and especially the manager are really nice there.", "author": "amie n."}

The waiter came right up to our table, and we ordered cokes.  He returned about 3 minutes later to get our order, and then about 10 minutes later with our 2 cokes.  We both ordered cheeseburgers, and got them about 15 minutes after we ordered.  At the time our food arrived, our glasses were half full.  Within a couple of bites we had finished them off.  After dropping off our food our waiter did not return for a very long time, so we sat there with no drinks for basically our entire meal. We were picking at our food trying to wait him out, but it's didn't happen.  After about 15 minutes, he returned to our table, so we ordered refills and our check at the same time since we didn't know how long it would be until we saw him again.

I still thought mine was good.  The drinks, 4 cokes in total came out to $14.00. They are served in very small glasses from the bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-21", "description": "I'm going to break this review into three categories: Food, Ambiance, Service.\n\nFood: 2 stars\nCrab cakes: Actually quite good. They were very small, but the crab was very meaty, fresh, and it wasn't mucked up with any creaminess in the cake itself. The sauce served with the crab cakes complimented the crust nicely.\nFries: Average and for the money I expected better. They could have been a little crispier, maybe cooked another minute\nClam Chowder: It had bacon in it, which was very nice. The bacon was quality (thick chunks of smoked bacon). There was also a nice amount of pepper in the chowder, which I really enjoyed. I think what was missing was that it seemed that the bacon was thrown into the chowder as an afterthought - it didn't taste as if the soup itself were stewed with bacon so the flavor wasn't injected well throughout the soup. Also, it was a little too creamy and thick for my taste. I prefer a chowder that you can't stand a spoon up in.\nLemon Risotto with Lobster: There may as well have been no lobster in there, because I didn't get any lobster flavor at all. I expected the lemon to be more flavorful - there was only a hint of lemon and there was zero lemon on the finish. My expectation was to have some seafood (lobster, perhaps?) undertone but there was nothing. The portion was enormous, however and it took passing the plate around to finish it.\nSpecial last night - seared ahi tuna with butternut squash puree - It was maybe the biggest serving of ahi tuna I have ever seen. It was too thick - the sear was so thin compared to the sheer thickness of the steak. There were two pieces served in a bowl - the bowl was far too small for this portion. that dish could have easily been served on a platter twice as big. Presentation was horrible. Ok, back to the food. I took a bite and I was surprised at the lack of flavor. It was basically sashimi with a 30 second sear on each side with no flavoring. The butternut squash puree was too thin - and there was far too much of it served - you couldn't pick it up really with your fork, you really needed a spoon to scoop it.  The sweetness was nice, but I didn't understand what it was doing with the ahi tuna - there was nothing added to the ahi by combining the puree with the tuna in one bite. \nPetrole Sole - There was nothing really impressive about this dish. The fish itself was well cooked but there was a severe lack of flavoring. The sauce served with the sole was tomato-based and added absolutely nothing to the fish.\nCrab mashed potatoes - this was by far the tastiest thing I had all night. I would go here just to get the crab mashed potatoes... it was SO GOOD. You took a bite and there was the perfect amount of shredded crabmeat intermingled with thick mashed potato and a lovely sweet butteriness that was just fabulous.\nAlmond Cake dessert - I enjoyed the almond cake, but I've had better (often). The cake itself was moist enough but the dish would have benefited from having some liquor-based sauce drizzled over it. Strawberries and creme fraise were served with the dish. . . the creme needed a little more sweetness, it was quite bland. The combination of the three was very light - overall for a dessert too mild.\nPeach Tartin with Cinnamon Ice Cream - Average. The tart itself didn't stand up to the heavily syruped (and very thinly sliced) peaches. Cinnamon Ice cream was very nice - not too sweet and could have actually been a little less sweet to contrast the very very syrupy peaches.\nWhite Peach and Lemon Sorbet - my favorite dessert. Definitely order this. The white peach sorbet had that lovely \"fuzzy\" finish, which seems so hard to replicate because I rarely have the pleasure of experiencing fuzzy sorbet. The lemon sorbet was fabulous. Very tart, made your lips smack, and complimented the white peach very well. I would definitely go out of my way just to have some.\nCreme Brulet - I'd say that this creme brulet was above average. I love when it's not too firm, which this pulled off. Didn't knock my socks off.\nEspresso - this was really very good and my date actually ordered one for himself after tasting mine. did not taste burnt at all, very nice creme, lovely finish. Complimented the almond cake very nicely.\n\nAll in all, I will probably never go back for food. But, it very well may be a nice place to stop in for dessert and espresso.\n\nAmbiance: 5 stars on the patio, 2 stars indoors\nThe patio is the winner here, everyone's said it. The space is small and intimate and the view is to die for. There's really no other reason to take someone here.\n\nService: 2 stars, was three, but they lost a point at the very end. \nService was OK.  He took quite a while to get around to ordering. He never once came by to ask how the food or how the drinks were, which was a bit odd - at the end however, he said \"you do realize service is not included, right?\" Umm... LAME.\n\nomg, I've reached my max.", "author": "Annie T."}

(btw, all we did was call about 15 ahead of time and they were able to set up our table which was very nice) Come on a clear day for lunch and you will see what I'm talking about. I had scallops and mussels and both were very good. I like that this restaurant uses non traditional sauces. For example, my mussel broth had a curry flavor - very unexpected and yummy!

If you get stuck going here, its not the end of the world. Whoever designed the menu did a reasonably good job, but the execution is poor both on the food quality and the service front. And you know what poor execution means in a seafood restaurant: yup, that's overcooked fish. Nothing here tastes _bad_, mind you, but its often not high on the flavor or freshness scale. As other reviewers observed, the crab mashed potatoes are worth eating, esp. with a tasty lemon sauce around them. Your other choices are tuna (got good reviews at my table), slightly overcooked salmon, slightly overcooked white fish of various varieties. And steak. Dessert, ditto: flourless chocolate cake, ok, apple tart , shrug, etc etc. If I were served this food at a large wedding or other event, it would be unremarkably fine. Something you can eat without comment in the background. At an SF restaurant, it seems inexcusable. Especially given the prices.\n\nAs for the service, it was well-intentioned. But it didn't work out successfully. We were a table of 10, and the waitress wrote down the position of every dish. But then the plates would come and it would be a whole 5 min of, who ordered the salmon? Repeated with every course. And the wrong desserts came out, there was a 5 min discussion withe the waitress of whether it was possible to order a half-caf cappuccino (I was spectating and the result seemed highly unclear, though some form of cappuccino did arrive). And each plate seemed to be brought by a different person who had no contextual information, despite the fact that the restaurant was largely empty.\n\nTo sum up: the 2.5 star average on Yelp seems fair to me. Don't go by choice, but if you have to go, you'll live through the experience. My recommendation: order a couple straight whiskeys and eat the crab mashed potatoes.", "author": "Carrie G."}

The service was horrible.  The location and ambiance was impeccable however, the service was deplorable.  When I arrived at 4:30pm, there were very few patrons so busy cannot account for poor service.  We were seated relatively quickly and were told there were no window seats available despite none being filled and never were except for a couple the entire two hours I was there.  The staff was pleasant just slow or non existent much of the time.  We were seated outside and as it became chilly i requested that the patio heater next to us be turned on only to be told that it really wouldn't help.  Another guest asked a few minutes later to a different server who said he was sorry but they would need to be hooked up to gas which was not possible.  Hmmm, ok.  My complete order never came nor did my daughter's ice cream.  It was brought after I paid the check!  I told the waiter when seated that I wished to have wine but it was 30 minutes before he returned so I could remind him.  The food itself was decent but not even lose to being good enough to endure the horrible service.  I typically cut places a lot of slack but this even pushed my limits.  It was never busy the entire time I was there and saw plenty of wait staff standing around.

At the end of the meal, our waitress dissapeared........she was nowhere to be found for about 20minutes. She finally showed up at the very end of the meal to give us our bill. Too bad tip was already included, or else I'd tip her under the avg tip rate.\n\nThe food - The food was bad, it was horrific and most of all, it was holy hell wat the heck is this crap i put in my mouth? The Calamari was bad, it was had no taste whatsoever and all you can slightly taste is the lime on it. The shrimp was just salty, you can't taste the bacon nor the shrimp. All you can taste was just salt salt salt and o yeah, salt. I had the Oven Chicken and it was just okay, but again it was really really salty and it didn't really have much flavor on it. My friend had the bass and it tasted like nothing, it had no taste whatsoever. No problem, just dip it in the butter sauce.......................it tastes like water now. He ended up asking for tartar sauce for his fish because it was just so bland and tasteless. The portion was really really small, so if you're going in hungry, you're probably comming out hungry. Don't expect a lot of food, it's really tiny portions and it's basically nothing. One person ordered the Lobster and all he got was a small lobster head and the tail, which has very little meat on it, and you know how much that costed him? $75............$75!! Now price is nothing if tastes good and it has a good quality to it, but it had no flavor, nothing, nada, uh uh, what is flavor? The chef should be hung by his balls for making tasteless pricey food.\n\nOverall - Overall this place sucks and i will not go there ever again, not even if it was the last restaurant on earth. I'd rather eat rocks then go to that restaurant ever again, because it was lame. The only good thing that came outta there was the hot chicks (i always write about hot chicks) and yes they were hot.

Came here with my wife for a Dine About Town lunch special, and was disappointed. Aside from the spectacular view, the food fell short. The service was decent, although the wait staff wouldn't leave us alone long enough to enjoy the meal. I realize that attentive wait staff is a good thing... but being bothered every 5 minutes didn't make much for a great conversation. Though our waitress, Chelsea was very helpful, the other 2 people tending to us were quite annoying. As far as the food was concerned, I went with the Dine About Town (DAT) featured salad, the Kobe Beef Burger, and added their Waterfront Clam Chowder to the mix. The salad... was salad; no bugs, yay!. The Kobe Burger was dry. I had ordered it to be medium, but it came super dry and well done; cooked through. The Clam Chowder was probably the highlight of the meal. But that's not why I'm giving this place just 2 stars. Why am I giving this place a 2 star rating you ask? Well my wife ordered the DAT salad and pasta. The problem was mainly with her meal. While she was enjoying her pasta, she unfortunately ate a rotten mussel which she described as tasting like feces (if you could put a taste to feces), and she found shell fragments in her pasta as well.

We came on a busy Friday night and were seated within 10 minutes of arrival. We went to the bar for cocktails - the Basil Martini my wife ordered was outstanding - gin, fresh lime and bits of basil served in a chilled martini glass. The bartenders were really friendly and offered me a taste of a couple different white wines in preparation for what we would pair with our dinner. \n\nWe shared the crab cakes to start. Small portion as expected, but extremely flavorful! We asked about the ingredients and was impressed that very little bread crumbs are used as many restaurants do. \n\nThe main course arrived soon after we finished the apps. I highly suggest the Blackened Ahi Tuna. I like spicier foods and this was not spicy enough for me, but an excellent balance for someone who likes a little spice in their dish. My wife had the Scallops with a side of greens beens saut\u00e9ed in shallots and bacon. What really impressed us both, is the degree of attention from the wait staff. There  were at least 3 different employees coming by to offer bread, refill water, deliver food, etc... given that we were in a somewhat isolated area of the restaurant on the mezzanine level(which has the best views in my opinion). \n\nEveryone we dealt with seemed very down to earth and friendly. One our biggest criticisms of other 4 and 5 star restaurants are the attitudes and lack of care some places show to their patrons - this was not the case here. We would absolutely go here again for dinner.

(which you can see and do for free if you stand just outside the restaurant with a pb & j.) \n\nthe service was pretty standard, and the waiter had a hard time getting my friends drink right. :-/ no biggie though.\n\nthe food was fairly decent, a tad bit expensive for exactly what you got. yet, like i said before, you're paying for the view. the dessert was thee highlight of the entire meal. this chocolate with orange sumtin sumtin.. ohhhh hella good! \n\noverall my experience wasn't anything to as i like to say \"jump up and down for\"; but it was alright. i actually went here for my work christmas party last year as well and had the same general experience. this is the kind of place that i personally wouldn't wanna flip the bill for, and my feelings for it are left at very...uhh... whatever.", "author": "Kristin Y."}

Our middle-aged Asian waitress did not do her job at all! She kept forgetting to bring my wine that I ordered. And even once, she asked me, \"Do you want a drink?\" after I had already ordered one! I mean, how hard is it to pour wine? I also thought she did not look professional in the sense that she was working a very nice restaurant - she had WAY too much eye makeup on. At one point during the dinner, I overheard her and another diner arguing. But the rudest thing she did was when we paid our bill, she OPENED it in front of us and counted out the money/tip to make sure it was \"enough\", then she nodded her head to us and said, \"Okay, have a good night!\" That was so damn rude. I've never experienced something like that before. \n\nI'm sure I would've loved dining here even more if we had a different server. Aside from that, the food was DELICIOUS. I eat chicken a lot at restaurants, but the chicken breast from the Dine About menu was the juiciest chicken I ever had!! I definitely don't regret ordering that. My friend ordered a side of the mashed potatoes, and it was served to her COLD. I told her to send it back, but she was worried that the crazy waitress would spit in it or something. I also had the prawn for an appetizer on top of the prix fixe dine-about menu. OH, do you know what sucked about this place? They couldn't provide HALF of their appetizer menu because their oven was \"broken\". Sorry, but I've never been somewhere that didnt' offer a lot of food that is ON the menu. Do you know how bad it is for a restaurant to say, \"Sorry, but our [whatever] is not working, so we can't serve that.\" Well, get it fixed!\n\nThe views were amazing. That's just about it.

Waterfront Restaurant came to mind because she mentioned it to me, so if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have known about this place and probably dined in some French restaurant on Geary. \n\nFirst off, we were greeted politely by one of the waitress and the host and we were given a table at the corner of the restaurant with a beautiful view looking out towards the Bay bridge and the ferry terminal. It was very comfortable and the lights were dim enough to make me feel like my vision was that of a senior. Nevertheless, it was pretty decent table.\n\nWe didn't want to drink, so we kept our waters, which has a strange flavor that I can't quite describe. Either way, I was gurping water down like I returned from a desert trek. \n\nThey served us some bread after ordering, which didn't come in baskets, but rather having a waiter placing a couple of slices on the plate (good way to control cost?). Nothing special there, though I wish the bread was warm even though it was fresh bread. \n\nWe ordered the Dungeness Crab Cakes for appetizers, which was nothing but crab meat! It was on a cream-based sauce and both went very well together. The crab cake itself was crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Very good by my opinion. Then there's the Crab Mashes Potatoes. Lots of potatoes, some strains of crab meat. Not that great. It's also not very consistent as some bites contain less crab meat than others. \n\nFor entrees, my girlfriend ordered the Over-baked Sea Bass with a lemon butter sauce (I think). Sea bass is always good and the night's sea bass was light and flaky. The sauce was interesting, but I felt like it wasn't doing much to the fish. I ordered the Black Angus NY Steak (just cause I felt like it) and it came with two types of sauce (Coconut butter sauce and A1-ish sweet sauce), sauteed string beans with bacon and a butt load of fries. I had the steak ordered Medium-rare and I'm happy it came out that way. Downside, it's drier than I thought. The steak wasn't as juicy as I would expect it to be, so less points there. Now the sauces was quite a delight, especially the coconut butter sauce, which is the better of the two. The other sauce is just...blah... The string beans was good with that touch of bacon, but nothing great after that. The fries is quite the surprise. I would think mashed potatoes would look nicer with the steak on top, but these fries are something else. Now I have beef against soggy fries and I like them crispy and hot. These fries didn't stay warm for too long, but the surprise came from its crispy till the end of my meal! Props to the crispy fries!\n\nI thought the Waterfront restaurant wasn't as bad as I anticipated from the Yelp reviews, but some dishes could have been better. It isn't bad for a date dinner, but I'm pretty sure there are better places out there.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

The dinner menu is small with meat, fish, and seafood options - nothing on the\nmenu for vegetarians. Our server informed us they were out of 2 menu items - artichokes (currently in season!) and ahi tuna. Very good French bread and delicious butter. Highlights were cream of asparagus soup with a small and delicious crab garnish, crab mashed potatoes, spinach side, and dessert sampler. Not happy with the roasted root vegetables (were they roasted a few days ago?), the roasted salmon (oily), or the saffron citrus sauce.

It was down hill from there. . .when we sat down, I noticed dust around the rim of our glass (the waitress insisted it was lint which she was trying to wipe off), asked for new glass and for the adjacent heat lamp to be turned on to balance the breeze from the bay.   I asked for bread 3 times which finally came 15-20 minutes later after our mediocre appetizers were delivered and asked about the heat lamp about 5 times over 20 minutes (this simple request seemed to throw some of the staff off - I don't think anyone wanted to take responsibility for it or it simply wasn't a priority).   I dined slightly shivering for some time.\n\n Food\nThe clam chowder which I like thick and creamy tasted thin and runny.  My b/f didn't find the crab cakes a major disappointment, and I probably would've liked them a little more had I not had to spit out crab shells every few bites (at this point, I was just a little relieved that they at least use real crabs!).   After what seemed like another 20 minutes I asked another waiter to check on our main dishes - the salmon and sea bass plates are forgettable.\n\nSummary\n* The food is not horrible, but it's not impressionable - the food is just mediocre.\n\n* Service is border lining horrible - definitely room, lots of room for improvement here.   I echo some people's sentiments - do not take anyone important here.  \n\n* Prices are high for food and outrageous for service which the restaurant tries to compensate for with the view.", "author": "lucy l."}

My perception of this restaurant is that it's for tourists...and then I made the mistake of reading what Yelper's had to say...oh dear!\nTo start the evening...traffic was horrendous and my husband had trouble getting back to The City on time. He called the restaurant to say how sorry he was that we'd be running late...45 minutes late! They were very nice about the situation and held our table for us! Okay, I thought...this is not so bad. \nWe arrive and I have to say that yes the view is really lovely...and our table was situated where we could see both the Bay Bridge and a bit of The City...it WAS romantic. The menu was Prix Fixe for Valentines day. The waiter was very nice and the menu choices were interesting. Ordering is a bit silly in that those poor waiters are forced to use these really stupid little hand-held gadgets to place the orders...and it just doesn't go smoothly as you have to order in a particular order...how weird! If they would just take out an old-school piece of paper and a pen it would have added a little personal touch instead of feeling a little like a roving fast food order taker. \nBut the food...I started with the Ahi Tuna Tartar...Japanese Citrus and Cumin Scented Wonton Crips...it was good, really good...the combination of the citrus and the coolness of the Tuna...I gobbled it up quick! We had a second course but it came after the main course...which was A Wild Mushroom Mascarpone stuffed Chicken Breast...and it was good too...the molded polenta thing was terrible and made me think the plate had been set up at like four in the afternoon and when they cooked the chicken they slapped it on that plate and sent it out. And you know that is a real shame because the chicken was very tasty. Why they would ruin it with that polenta is beyond me. When our second course arrived with apology...it was good...it was a salad and I just can't rave about a salad. For desert I had the Chocolate Fondant and yep...it was super scrumptious! \nOver all the food was good, we were very well watered, breaded and cocktailed...it's just subtle things that R E A L L Y make a difference between a meh restaurant and a Y E A H restaurant!

I had been hoping that the other reviews were just a fluke, but sadly, this is not true.  \n\nMy first reaction: \"tacky tacky tacky\" when I saw the reference to a 4% surcharge on your bill being added for health insurance costs.  Why not just add it to the cost of the menu without making me feel guilty?  I want San Franciscans to have health insurance.  I want good food.  I do not care for passive agressive political statements on my menu.\n\nThat being said, it's really about the food. I ordered off the \"fresh fish wild your way\"  part of the menu, and selected sea bass.  I mean, really.  Sea bass is a glorious fish and kind of hard to mess up, considering the fat content.  And my fish wasn't bad.  It just wasn't good.  The fish was slightly overdone and somewhat tasteless.  I will say, however, that the soy citrus wasabi sauce was very tasty.  Perhaps the flavors could have been used better than as a sauce added on the plate.  \n\nThe crab mashed potatoes were promising comfort food.  Again, they were good, but not great.  Just a bit underseasoned.  \n\nOn a good note, the pancetta wrapped prawns were grilled to perfection and the wine choices were as expected.  The location can't be beat - great views all around.  \n\nOverall, I'm not going back.  May be worth trying once, if someone else is paying and you want a nice view to go with your dinner.

The place is excellent for NYE celebration as it has a spectacular view of the fireworks and a prime location. The decor is nice too and the food was generally good. However, service was poor. The hostess was very pleasant, professional, and helpful. But in the end our problems with the server were not resolved. Our server was frustrated, sarcastic, and just plain rude. It was somewhat understandable since our party was slightly disorganized and we were confused about the seating (upstairs or downstairs which had different menus; upstairs is suppose to be fancier, where we intended to make our reservations, but there was a mix up and they gave us a table downstairs instead). But that still doesn't justify our server approaching us with a negative attitude and off putting demeanor (tone of voice, comments, vague and misinformed responses to our questions). I've worked in restaurants before and mistakes and mix ups happen. Usually in good restaurants they are handled well and cleared up without any resentment. However, our server did not appear to have let go of some negative feelings she had either for us or someone else. Overall, our entire table very uncomfortable with idea of having to sit through a 2 hour dinner with her. It was hard to determine if she was just frustrated with the evening since it was NYE or if she just didn't like us. Whichever she wasn't very helpful and dampened our evening. We spoke to the hostess, then the manager about our situation. We were told they would resolve the issue but it didn't happen. In the end  our server was not changed so we tried our best to not further upset the cranky server. Needless to say eating dinner with a server you're hesitant to ask too many questions, the wrong questions, or make comments to, is not good. Besides her answers were all incorrect (e.g. are we going to be able to see the fireworks from our table, which was next to window that faced the water, her response was \"Oh NO, the fireworks are WAY DOWN THERE, you can't see it from here. Everyone gets up and walks outside.\" In fact, the fireworks were right outside our window and we had a spectacular view). Plus she made little to no effort to help us coordinate our courses, cork wines, or refill waters...such a shame for a restaurant with a wonderful location", "author": "Royce L."}

For a white table cloth establishment this place was terrible.  The entrees ranges from $20-$30/fatty but thats reasonable considering it is on the waterfront.  Besides the view (which was ok) the real killer about his restaurant was the service.  I hardly remember what I ordered but the bad service has been engraved in my fat tissues.  When you are served a dish the waiter should always be next to you preventing reaching over other guests.  The wait staff would seriously reach over myself to serve someone sitting next to me.  I have never experienced this type of service before.  I am pretty fat so I am impressed they were able to reach across my fat belly to the other person.   Very unprofessional.  The food was also nothing memorable.  As an eating machine I am sad for this restuarant.  So much potential but the staff just ruins it.  They need a fat owner to save this place.", "author": "Fatty A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-31", "description": "We were excitedly expecting to dine at the Waterfront Restaurant for a couple of days, since we had a strong recommendation from the Hyatt Regency concierge. The food and the place were normal, nothing special, (except for the nice view, the great company, excellent crab cakes and nice wine list). At the point when our entrees were being served, the assistant waiter spilled my wine glass by accident on a fellow diner at the table. This is when everything turned unfortunate. The server was scared to say or do anything. We had to tell the waiter, and we felt no empathy there... If the staff is scared to say or do anything, does it say anything about the management staff and owners? The young (junior) manager was slightly apologetic and asked if we wanted another bottle, said she'd pay for laundry. The upcoming issue established this as the worst restaurant experience our group of 7 had in San Francisco.  The GM or owner of the place came to the table in a  confrontational attitude, asked about the incident, asked the diner with wine all over his clothing to step away from the table and speak to him at the other end of the restaurant! In an inappropriate tone and demeanor, and clearly stated that he had never had to comp a bottle of wine... Go figure! He wasn't willing to do anything else even though the entire table had been quiet and upset after the incident, the whole experience was shot. He didn't care at all, even got security behind him, \"just in case\". We were not requesting anything out of the ordinary, and were not being disrespectful at all. In the end, when we paid, we made sure to state that we'd share our experience with everyone, after all, each and every one of us are Hospitality educators in town for a convention (go figure!). After a long while of arguments, the manager invited us (very inappropriate if I may say so) to shots at the bar and to get us a limo back to the hotel, which we clearly declined... After all, its was not about the money, it was about respect and making sure no one else goes through this while paying $400 for dinner. I guess he figured out-of-towners are not worth satisfying (just make sure you get their money before they go back home), since they won't come back soon!", "author": "Angel G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-09-17", "description": "This place was a near-complete disappointment from the moment we stepped in the door.  I wish I'd consulted Yelp before going.  Our reservation was at 7:30, and we weren't seated until 8:00.  As we sat in wait by the host booth, we noticed that a tall, athlete-looking man and his date walked in without a reservation, requested a table by the water, and were seated immediately.  The hosts and manager/owner(?) fluttering about the host stand appeared disorganized and disheveled.  No one smiled.  \n\nWhen they finally seated us after our half hour wait, there was no apology for or acknowledgment of the wait whatsoever.  This tone of unapologetic neglect characterized our entire experience at Waterfront; for a place charging $20 and up for mediocre entrees, this kind of service is inexcusable.  \n\nAt the table, my mother was seated in a chair in which she found her feet entangled in the tubing that supplies fuel to the outdoor heating lamps, a set-up that seems a likely fire hazard.  When she asked the waiter to move her to the other side of the table, he hesitated because, he said, he \"might trip on it himself.\"  Hello?  Why was it set up this way in the first place?  \n\nThe waiter was horrible.  I have no idea why this man is in the food service profession.  He seemed nervous, and had absolutely no sense of graciousness.  He immediately asked us for our order without even greeting us, he didn't tell us the specials until we asked, he offered no explanation for our hour-long wait for our entrees, and (as I read in another review-- must be the same waiter), his response to anything we said was \"understood.\"  My mother's food came without the herb salad described on the menu.  When we pointed this out after we finished our meals (he never came back to check in with us as we ate, and we were not able to flag him down), he responded that our discontent was  \"understood.\"  Neither did he offer to comp a dessert or drink nor to bring the salad!  \n\nAfter an hour wait for the entress, we were so hungry that just about anything would taste good, yet I couldn't even finish my meal.  The lobster risotto was the only dish worth ordering of the three we had at our table.  The mesquite grilled sea bass was AWFUL-- dry and ill-prepared.  I can do better myself at home.  The sea bass came with no side dishes, no garnish-- essentially no color whatsover on the white plate.  The aeshetic presentation was much like one imagines food in the Arctic Tundra in the dead of winter -- white, gray, cream colors.  Bland all around.  I ate about a fourth of the fish before I gave up.  The spinach and fig salad I ordered for an appetizer was equally disappointing-- the spinach leaves were large and tough, and the dressing was gummy and sweet, kind of like Chinese dipping sauce.  I didn't finish that either (it's rare that I leave food on my plate, even if it's mediocre).   \n\nThe one glimmer of pleasure in this meal was the dessert course.  We shared a peach tartin and almond cake, both of which were lovely.  Their pastry chef seems to be the only one in the kitchen who knows what he/she is doing.  \n\nI definitely won't return to this place.  I can get the views it offers (its only bonus, besides dessert) by walking along any pier on the Embarcadero, for free, any night I want.", "author": "Maria M."}

The food view and the food was amazing but i totally agree with all the other reviews on here about how unbelievably bad the service was! We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly at a table next to the window with a gorgeous view of the bay and the bay bridge. Our waitress however was terrible. When we asked what her recommendation her response was, \"everything is good, i'm not going to go down the entire menu and say 'this is good , this is good, this is good.\" So anyway, I started with the soup which was tomato and corn, and the seafood pasta for the main course. The soup was okay, it tasted very fresh and the corn added a nice texture. The pasta was excellent, loaded with crab, mussels, clams, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. All was well until we finished eating and sat there for nearly 45 minutes while our waitress disappeared to god knows where, we had to ask a bus boy to wrap up our leftovers and then ten minutes later she reappears and doesn't offer us dessert, we have to ask for a menu. We decided to get the sticky toffee pudding to which her response was, \"okay, you know it's british and it's not actually a custardy-pudding, right?\" So first everything is good and now the one thing that we are sure about she doesn't want us to get? this is just weird. needless to say, i would go back here only if they improve their service standards.", "author": "r t."}

Simple dishes, done well. Service is friendly and not overcasting. The views, of course. \nInterestingly, some people accordingly to their reviews seem quite distraught with their experiences. I guess the hurt comes as simply as the quote goes, \"don't count the chicken before the eggs hatch.\"  \nI stumbled into the place leaving behind my expectation, as it would not have allowed me to go in had I maintained it, and I stumble no more to be there again.

So why the one star rating? The management and hostesses had less class than the bum asking for change on the street corner, at least the bum won't tell you to leave as soon as he gets your money. \n\nWe had a large group for a reservation that was made over a month in advance. We did not make our orders difficult nor did we ask to split the bill. We ordered each course when the waiter was ready to take our orders. We didn't linger on any course and ordered a steady stream of drinks. So it was to my surprise that moments after we signed off on our $2000+ bill with a generous tip we were told to vacate the premises because we were over our \"time limit\". I would understand if we were lingering or if the restaurant was packed and others with reservations were waiting. However, the restaurant was less than half full. To make it worse, the hostess decided to make a comment to two members of our party while they were walking down the stairs. She said in a snarky manner \"who stays at a restaurant over 2 hours?\" Um maybe a group of 16 who wants to SPEND MONEY at your establishment. But I have a suspicion that this girl can only afford to dine at places like McDonald's and burger king, seeing as how she SUCKS at her job. \n\nBecause we are reasonable people we finished our drinks as fast as possible and left the table. However, since the majority of our group was from out of town and times when we are all together are rare we decided to congregate in the waiting area for a few minutes to talk and take a few pictures while people went to the bathroom. One would think this would be OK since there wasn't anyone else waiting, however the hostess decided that she was important enough to tell us that instead of taking pictures with the beautiful bay view as a back drop that we should squeeze into the small space between the bathroom door and the elevator. She said it had a better backdrop for photos which was insulting because it was a blank wall with a small flower vase in front of it. \n\nSo please if you are thinking about going to a classy place and spending a large amount of money on a good dinner please avoid this self-important, money-grubbing, trash-hole.", "author": "Reed M."}

I ordered my food via Waiters on Wheels (which deserves its own complaint!), so had to live with the terrible food I received.  The clam chowder with applewood smoked bacon should have been called \"bacon chowder,\" as the bacon flavor completely dominated the soup.  Additionally, it was difficult to find any clams at all....just bacon bits and very undercooked-crunchy!-potato pieces.  The crab cakes were very greasy, and whoever was in charge of putting the to go order together did not even include a lemon wedge, which would have helped cut the greasiness.  Their flavor was forgettable.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were just ok--they were really heavy and dense, with some lumps.  When you have to order your sides separate from the entree, it is really disappointing when they are not great.  Which brings me to the worst part of the meal:  the asparagus.  While it physically still resembled a vegetable, the only discernible taste was that of burnt wood or ash.  In fact, the bitter, charred flavor was so potent, that even after a glass of water, some bread and butter, and ten minutes, the burnt flavor still lingered in my mouth!  My boyfriend's shrimp and sausage pizza was probabaly the best item we ordered, and it was just so-so.  I have eaten here twice previously, and it was always decent....did they get a new chef??
