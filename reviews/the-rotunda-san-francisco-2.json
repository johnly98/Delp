It was still a lovely experience, but I've definitely had better. \n\nFor $50, you get a choice of tea, two scones (served with clotted cream and jam), four savory finger foods/sandwiches, and four desserts. My favorite items were the savory crab cone, seared ahi, and prawn (tip: the last two are pescatarian substitutions!) otherwise everything else was average/mediocre. The desserts were the biggest disappointment. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing was the complimentary Yorkshire pudding/popover served in the beginning.

We had a booth, and the atmosphere was so beautiful (which is what drew me to this place) and very relaxing. It wasn't too busy (but it was also Labor Day weekend so people may have been out of town). The waitress was super friendly, attentive, and did not rush us at all. \n\nTea service is 2-4pm Sunday-Thursday and 2-5pm on Friday and Saturday. It's $45/per person for the Signature Tea, with an option to upgrade to Grand Tea for $55/pp or Royal Tea for $60/pp. The only difference between the signature tea and the other two options is that there is a glass of wine offered with the latter 2. \n\nThey offer a selection of Dammann Fr\u00e8res loose leaf teas with a variety of finger sandwiches (4 pp), scones with preserves and cream (2 pp), and other desserts (4 pp). They also served their delicious consomme soup with a mini cheese cracker (which a nice touch but was a bit stale in my opinion) and their classic popovers with strawberry butter (always one of my favorites at Neiman Marcus). \n\nI originally got the Nuit a Versailles tea, as the waitress said it was one of the most popular and I was interested a green tea with fruity flavors such as kiwi and peach. However, while it smelled really good, for me the violet blossom and orange blossom flavors were a bit too strong for my tasting. The waitress was very nice about it and let me change to the Jardin Bleu tea (another super popular one), a blend of teas from India and China with notes of rhubarb and strawberry, which was AMAZING. My mom got the Anji tea, which is a simple white tea that while plain, complemented the sandwiches and desserts really nicely. \n\nThere was a selection of finger sandwiches including a croissant with egg and prosciutto, cucumber/raddish on bread (bread was dry), crab in a waffle cone (super cute idea, but cone was kind of chewy), and brie and ham (my favorite one!). Truthfully, I have had better sandwiches with tea service. \n\nFor the desserts there was a blueberry muffin, another blueberry tart, a chocolate cake (my favorite, was super moist!), and a mousse cake (also pretty good). The desserts were tasty, but I wish that there was a wider variety, rather than 2 blueberry based desserts. \n\nThe scones were on the smaller side and a bit dry, one savory cheese, and another sweet one with cranberries. They were served with cream (so addicting), lemon curd, and preserves which helped to balance the dryness of the scones. \n\nI would come again!", "author": "April L."}

I explained what we're looking for, and he again appeared put out and appeared to handled several other tables before getting around to finding me a plate. When he came back with the plate, he was looking utterly unrushed -- while I was basically tapping my fingers: I had been looking around the room for help, since it had been a while and everyone's eating but us and our food is sitting there getting cold! I said something about that, and he wants to argue with me! He said something like, \"well I had to go to the kitchen\" (rather than something like, sorry about that/sorry you had to ask twice/etc.). When I tried to talk with him about it later he argued again and literally walked away while I was talking. \n\nListen, it's a beautiful environment. A neat shape, a nice view, and with tons of gold and white inside, the details look very palatial. Plus, the food was a step up from average.

Since Union Square is beautifully decorated during Christmas time, we were looking forward to being completely immersed in the holiday spirit and The Rotunda did not disappoint.\n\nWe arrived really early for our reservation and were seated early at a lovely table near a window with a gorgeous view of Union Square. My daughter and I ordered the Signature Tea Service, my husband ordered the French Dip sandwich with a bowl of Tomato Soup, and my son ordered a Burger.\n\nOur meals began with a cup of consomm\u00e9 and a small biscuit.  Wow, that consomm\u00e9 was deeply rich-tasting and satisfying!  Next, we were served our pots of tea with cream and sugar.  We chose Breakfast Tea (a blend of Sri Lanka, Darjeeling, and Assam) and Jardin Bleu Tea (a blend of teas from India and China, flavored with rhubarb, wild strawberry and cornflower petals).  The breakfast tea was delicious plain.  The Jardin Bleu was more fragrant than I cared for - but perfect after adding cream and sugar! Then, we were served warm, flakey popovers with strawberry cream!  These were incredibly tender and tasty!\n\nOur Afternoon Tea sandwiches and petite sweets arrived on a three-tiered tray and consisted of: a cucumber sandwich, salmon on pumpernickel, a chicken salad sandwich, a crab salad sandwich, two scones (one savory, one sweet), a pumpkin spice muffin, a gingerbread cookie, a donut hole, a cake with chocolate frosting, Devonshire cream, lemon curd, and strawberry jam.  Most of the items were very tasty.  My favorites were the crab salad sandwich and cake!  The savory scone was my least favorite - being flavorless and dry.\n\nMy husband's French Dip was fantastic: nice, thin slices of beef with good flavor and a great dipping sauce.  My son's burger was cooked perfectly medium and offered a substantial meal.  Their fries were great, too.  The soup, sadly, was in need of a boost of flavor and salt.\n\nOverall, our Afternoon Tea experience was wonderful and my husband was pleasantly surprised with his lunch, too!

The food is excellent though the pricing is high at more than $20 per lunch entree ($30 for the lobster sandwich) - you're paying for ambiance more than the food obviously.

I would recommend either calling in for a reservation or placing one online. My party and I opted for the signature tea which came with your choice of tea, assorted scones, cookies, tarts, cakes, and sandwiches.\n\nI got the Anji tea which had a floral taste upon first sip but turns acerbic after it settles. I am not too picky with tea, so this was just fine for me. I poured a little bit of milk into it as I am a fan of English-style milk tea. You'll get a whole pot and if you drink a lot or are sharing, you can always ask for more hot water to add to your pot. \n\nAs for the little finger foods, I'll mention what stood out to me. The plain scone on the bottom tier paired well with the jam! It was crumbly and just the right amount of sweetness to remind me of a perfect afternoon in London. Not that I've been, but one can imagine!\nFor the finger sandwiches, I loved the cucumber and crab sandwiches. Both were packed with flavor and balanced nicely with the tea! Lastly, the nutella-chocolate fudge bars were delicious! The size of the dessert was perfect so that you don't feel guilty eating one or even two! You get one piece of every dessert and sandwich... unless someone doesn't like theirs or is full, you might be able to snatch another one. \n\nThe decor is vintage-modern and the facility is clean. We sat right by the edge so we can see the lower floors below. I would not recommend for those afraid of heights!

In my personal opinion, I felt the service had too many sweets.  I personally prefer a more savory tea service.  If you get seated right at the beginning of tea service (around 2:30) you'll be waiting at least 20 minutes for the food to come out.  \n\nSo here's the thing, for the price, the food itself isn't really worth it.

While service has improved with friendly servers, unfortunately my vegan tea set was very disappointing & underwhelming. For $45, I expected more than just some fruit and veggie kabobs. Other than a tiny scone and a piece of fudge, I don't know what the pastry chef prepared. Of course I was not able to enjoy the consume or the popovers as neither was vegan.

However, the tables for two were a bit close together and were quite small (privacy and space compromised). \nThe service was quite nice but a bit on the slow side so by the time we received the tea service, 30 minutes had passed. They offered complimentary chicken soup and a popover with strawberry cream cheese on the side to pass the time. \nThe tea service set I went for with my guest was the basic set, $45 per person,  with own tea. The tea selection was not what I expected as there were more green teas and herbal teas than black tea and the teas may not pair well with the food from the tea set. I ordered the English breakfast and my guest ordered the Earl Gray. \nWhen the tea set arrived, we were quite surprised. It was more modern and the flavors were unique. But taste - well,  mediocre at best. Scones were disappointing due to their size and flavors (one was cheese and basil flavor, the other was cranberry). Note, if a crab cone is given, place the crab onto the cucumber sandwich.

Not once were we asked how things were or if we wanted more hot water for the tea.

There were times conversations were easily heard while enjoying our food. \n\nThe busser looked kinda sloppy expecting to be under a classy restaurant.. He had black jeans on and when he was changing dirty tables to make new table set up his \"green\" underwear was totally exposed from the back side! I mean cmon.. \n\nThe server was kinda ok he asked if it was our first time and we said it was and didn't say much about menu or their known tea service. \n\nWe placed an order for the lavender citrus splash non alcoholic drink and went ahead with food orders. A salmon entree, warm seafood salad, lobster salad sandwich. The water was served kinda warm with no ice served. Water service sucked because they refilled the water after it was waved to need of a refill. The busser was refilling the water and for some odd reason he was refilling both sides of diners but us?! \n\nThe tea service looked classy presented in tiered plated display, My Sister overheard both sides of diners complaining about \"dirty dinnerware/glassware\" and I was not shocked, Because seeing this restaurant you expect high quality and flawless expectations but then again its a \"store chain\" eatery. \n\nThey serve you a Popover with Strawberry Butter. The popover is a hollow bread more crunchy and kinda chewy and airy inside. The strawberry butter is amazing but not impress to what they are known for - Those popovers. I have had better bread at a Asian bakery and more satisfying.\n\nThe lobster salad sandwich requested as an appetizer.. it was split to 2 plates and it was alot of food! 2 pcs of lobster salad club style sandwich pulled together with a bamboo skewer.. with homemade chips! It was delicious but I felt the lobster was shredded and not chunks similar to what Im used to on a lobster roll. \n\nThe salmon entree presentation looked nice but my sisters said it lacked of seasonings and tasted like \"salmon\".. Not sure if she meant fishy or no seasonings at all. She cleaned the plate and said she wouldn't order that entree again.\n\nMy warm seafood salad had large shrimp and scallops but I noticed it was placed sloppy on the salad. Scallops were not seared at all..no seared marks. Looked like the scallops were tossed in hot oil. The shrimps were large and good .. you get about 3-4 large scallops and 3 large shrimp along with fresh greens and cherry tomatoes.. This salad would have been a hit if they properly grilled or seared the seafood. Otherwise its a mediocre pricey salad!\n\nThe Lavender Citrus Cocktail was delicious but they only fill half a wine glass with a mint leaf on top of the ice with a cheap plastic straw to sip on. I would order it again with less ice and request to fill up the glass!\n\nService was okay .. lack of water service and server barely around to check on us.. I had asked fora dessert menu and server recommended the carrot cake but We opted for something more exotic, The panna cotta with mango caviar and sauce with toasted coconut flakes. They added candles they were reminded it was my birthday brunch. The dessert was ok .. It is similar to a milky jello or flan consistency. \n\nI would try the tea service even though I did ask the neighbor diners what they thought of the tea service and they said they would not come back for the tea service and they came for ambience.. They asked about our meals because they thought it looked pretty good and we told them they are better off getting a meal from Nordstrom Bistro Cafe.", "author": "Joy J."}

After we sat down, they gave us popovers with strawberry butter. It was delightful. After they cleared our table, they served us chicken broth which had an intense smell that overpowered the table and our nostrils. We were reluctant to taste. I made an attempt to sample but it was strong that we quickly requested the server to remove from our table. Overall the broth was rejected by the six ladies. We all agreed and were on the same page that it did not have fragrant smell. Every time, they served on other table we could smell it. I strongly urge the managers, to remove this from their menu. \n\nService - I was totally disappointed with our server. It was hard to get he's attention. And whenever we requested anything it took time before he could deliver, forgot and most of the time it appeared he neglected our table. We were in a party of six; he automatically received a 20 percent gratuity. I wish restaurants ban this 20% gratuity policy because most of the time it's seen that servers take full advantage and neglect their customers. And the server was sweating and smelling. He's smell was not pleasing when he came to our table.\nAmbiance - They have beautiful celling, open space and big windows. The stained glass ceiling is breathtaking and stunning.  \n\nFood - Though, it was pricey but it was worth every penny. We ordered salmon filet with kale, lobster sandwich, crab melt, burger, and turkey sandwich. I was pleased with their selections and the taste of food. \n\n The waiter asked one of the girls, what type of cheese you prefer with the sandwich. When we received the bill, we realized he charged $1.50 for the cheese. Please inform your guests that it's not included or don't offer without them asking. We ordered cocktails from the menu too. I loved my elegant mule. \n\nOverall we had a wonderful time minus the service. I would highly recommend people to come and try this place.", "author": "Ashi C."}

I've been here several times for business lunches, tried several things on the menu, taste ranges from mediocre to terrible. This place charges high-end/fine dining prices, but they do not have the culinary skills to justify the prices they charge. In short, nice atmosphere, expensive, but some dishes are barely edible. \n\nIf you happen to get a seat by the window, great! You have a great view, and the general ambiance of the restaurant is nice, it's a good-looking place. Service is relatively friendly and speedy, though nothing to write home about (it's not Gary Danko level service). It's really convenient and fitting to come here for business lunches (if someone else is paying), but that's about all the positives of this place. \n\nThis place has far more negatives than positives. For starters, it's outrageously expensive for what you're getting. For example, two people for lunch, Person A gets a soup and salad, and Person B gets a soup and a sandwich. No drinks. Bill (after 15% tip) is $101, which is absolutely ridiculous. As I already mentioned, the level of their service doesn't quite rise to the fine dining level. And definitely not the taste of their food. \n\nThe lobster bisque is good, but again, nothing to write home about. I suppose you do get chunks of lobster in there. The caesar salad is hardly edible; I got chicken in it and the chicken was bland and tough. The \"croutons\" was this large cheesy crust. I've also had the crab melt, which was just OK, it tastes like a crab melt you can get anywhere else. I've also had the salmon salad, and it was very mediocre. \n\nThey serve you this croissant bread with butter in the beginning, which is alright. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place, even if it's a business lunch and someone else is footing the bill. The food just simply doesn't taste good to have to stomach eating lunch here. The food probably tastes worse than Cheesecake Factory, and yet costs double. SKIP!", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Came here for afternoon tea this past Sunday, and it fell incredibly short of my expectations.\n\nThe venue itself is beautiful, but that's the only thing going for them. My boyfriend and I sat down and the waiter accidentally poured way too much water in my cup, which overflowed and got all over the place. He quickly cleaned it up, but not a good start to a \"fancy\" experience. The tablecloth had yellow/brown stains in several places, and when the silverware came, some were dirty. Thankfully our waitress noticed and got us new silverware, but for a \"fancy\" place, this is not how I imagined it to be. \n\nOnce we got our silverware, a waiter dropped by with a large puff pastry for each of us. It was warm and yummy! I was excited. Then we ordered the $45/person tea set, and I was ready to move past the disappointing start and enjoy this puff pastry and a great tea set. \n\nWhen the tea set came, it looked beautiful; however, everything tasted awful. The scones were COLD (WHAT?!!!) as were all the sandwiches. The sandwiches were subpar, something you could get anywhere, and the cakes up top were meh.

I would say the meat was on the dry side and the thicker dough didn't help.

I knew this place existed but I had never been so I decided to see availability.  I was able to get a reservation same day via Open Table (make sure to write \"afternoon tea service\" in the special requests box) which was a huge perk.  And I am very happy that I went to the Rotunda on the 4th floor of Neiman Marcus.\n\nEntering the restaurant, I was promptly greeted and taken to my table overlooking Union Square.  I feel like there are keen on aesthetic details here, especially with legit napkin rings present.  The afternoon tea service menu is very vague with the edible details but goes in great depth to tell you all about the tea and their origins.  I wonder if that is because the menu items rotate?  Anyway, I knew I was going to get a popover, tiny sandwiches, and tiny desserts so I hoped for the best since I forgot to ask about what was in the sandwiches.  It would have been helpful and welcome if they asked if any food allergies/sensitivities are present, especially in a restaurant with this gorgeous glass ceiling and with a menu that lacks specifics.  But no food kills me so I didn't chase the waiter down to ask him, letting the surprise element come forth.\n\nI ordered the signature tea service (to save a little money) with Anji white tea so that I'm able to sleep early tonight.  Of course, that came out first.  Very delicate but still with distinct flavor, I was impressed.  \n\nFirst came the popover with strawberry butter.  At first I thought it was a bit browner than I liked on the outside but once I opened it, I fell in love.  Best popover I had in years!!!  The strawberry butter was alright but I kind of wished the other side accoutrements (clotted cream x 2, strawberry preserves and lemon curd) was present at that time or even replace the strawberry butter.  It just kind of tasted like Philadelphia strawberry cream cheese mixed with butter to me.  I would have rather have had the lemon curd to spread over the warm, fresh pastry.\n\nThen a little while later, everything else shows up.  The waiter does a great job explaining everything.  I was also happy that out of the 4 sandwiches, I was delighted with 3 (I have never been a fan of eggs by themselves, so I left that one on the plate) since I always enjoy fresh crab (I cannot stand canned tuna), chicken salad had very minimal mayo, and you just can't go wrong with cucumbers and cream cheese.  Plus the bread choices were adorable, I cannot think of a better word than that.  And there was an adorable savory mini scone on there as well, if the popover starter is too unconventional for one's liking.  If that is the case, just send that popover to me, please :0).\n\nThe desserts were a nice mix, although blueberries were in both a crumble cake and a muffin on the same plate.  It would have been nice with one other fruit option, maybe apples in the cake instead?  The pistachio macaron was flavorful and fun with chunks of nuts in the usually smooth surface, I appreciated the change.  The brownie was very sticky, rich and dense.  They didn't skimp on the chocolate, which I loved, but I wish it didn't stick to the plate and my hand as much while consuming the morsel.\n\nAnd they even give you handmade chocolate squares with the check!  Mine were Andes mint style but sized like a Ghiradelli chocolate square.\n\nThis is a delightful treat once in a blue moon.  You can definitely bring your tourist family and friends here.  And you can eat solo and not feel ashamed for doing so.  Plus the service was really friendly and they kept the water glass full and gave me a refill of hot water in my teapot.

We were the last ones there and definitely felt rushed however we were not there past closing time so it just felt weird. \nOverall I don't think it's worth it for the money you pay.

I had to call them an hour before to let them know I'd be 30 minutes late, and they were super accommodating about ensuring I still got the seating I had originally requested for.

It's not super stuffy or anything, so go ahead and wear jeans if you'd like! 5/5\n\nFood: So you start out with a savory chicken consomme as well as the warm bread popover that comes with strawberry butter. Once you choose your tea, you get your pot as well as the tea sandwiches, scones, muffins, and petite sweets. I believe they change their items each time, so if you have a dietary restriction, definitely let the waiter know ahead of time. I liked all the scones and muffins, but the sandwiches I felt were just OK. They were either too bland or dry, but they were still decent.

Tea is from 2:00 - 4:30 pm on the weekdays which is a bit of an odd time for me in terms of my work schedule. Furthermore, they don't start serving tea until 2:30 pm as per their reservation system. I finally found some time and made a 2:15 pm reservation for me and a friend through Open Table. When I made the reservation, I did include a note stating that I was vegetarian so that the restaurant would be aware that they made need to make a few alternations to the typical afternoon tea set.\n\nWe arrived a bit early, around 2:00 pm, but were seated promptly. Initially, I had wanted a window seat for the view, but since much of the area surrounding Union Square is currently under construction, I was completely okay with being seated within a booth type area towards the front of the restaurant. \n\nTea began with a small cup of consomme and a biscuit for my friend. No small bites for me because lo and behold, I am vegetarian. I wasn't too miffed about this since the hot and ready popovers with strawberry butter came out soon after. Still, it would have been cool to have a vegetarian counterpart like a tiny glass of tomato soup or something. My friend and I each chose the Signature Tea ($45 without tax and tip per person) because we weren't looking to spend an extra $10-$15 for a glass of champagne with tea. I ordered the breakfast tea and my friend got the nuit a versailles tea. I know, I know, I was really basic, but hey I love classic black tea blends. The breakfast tea was good, but I have to admit that the fruity and floral nuit a versailles tea was the star. \n\nOur signature tea came with 2 savory scones (cheddar and pesto), 2 sweet scones, blueberry cheesecake (2), brownies (2), madeleines, 3 cucumber and cheese open faced \"sandwiches\", 3 deviled egg open faced \"sandwiches\", 1 lobster roll, 1 chicken open faced \"sandwich\". There was also cream, lemon custard, and jam served on the side. Though most of the food was good, I have to admit that the so called tea sandwiches were quite underwhelming in terms of size and flavor. They were small circles, about the size of poker chips, with scarce toppings. Furthermore, they were open faced and thus, even smaller than expected. \n\nOverall, the beautiful interior and good service move me to give this place a 4/5. Prices have risen over the years and I'm not sure how many times I will return, but I would highly recommend this as a guilty pleasure or a birthday splurge just for the experience alone.

I feel like either they shouldn't be allowed in or you should check with the adjacent tables to make sure other customers are fine with it. My mom ordered the salmon, my sister the turkey burger, and I ordered the chicken. While all the dishes were fine, they weren't as incredible as the finger foods I enjoyed with my previous tea experiences. The fish was over cooked, the turkey was over done, the chicken was good, but the cauliflower it was sitting on was entirely too mushy and over cooked and soggy. They brought out a complimentary cupcake for the birthday celebration, which was nice, but didn't taste very good at all- the frosting was too sugary/fake, and the cupcake itself tasted like it was made out of a box (honestly, not even that good).

The view and location is stunning but food could really use a revamp. A nice touch is hey do serve an amuse bouche of some consomm\u00e9 (clear light broth) which was delicious with a half of a gougere, I for one love gougeres and rather have a handful of those than the popover everyone else raves about with strawberry butter (which they could be a little more generous with) My mom ordered the roasted salmon with warm kale salad which she loved and wiped her plate clean. I ordered the high tea (1st teir) for $45 in which you get mini versions of a rosemary scone, cranberry scone, spice muffin, cucumber on baguette (my favorite of the spread), lobster roll on sesame brioche bun (2nd best), chicken salad sandwich in a brioche roll, chocolate torte, pecan coffee cake slice, almond Madeleine, and egg salad  on croissant. It came with some sauces, Devonshire cream, Creek fraiche?, lemon curd, and raspberry jam, waiter didn't tell us what :( tea I chose was the nuit a Versailles very floral and fruity I wonder if they offer cream and sugar if I had ordered the English breakfast tea.  I think the pastry selection should include more things like a muffin or more viennoiserie to put the spreads on. Also to add a soup or salad course to the tea service. Make sure you get a reservation beforehand the waitlist was longggggg for people who who came and cut it close to closing time. If I went again it would be for the lunch. None of the desserts wowed me so we didn't order it was birthday so they brought out a cupcake which was $8 that they comped, but honestly it tasted like a dry cornbread muffin with grocery store buttercream.

Every single one tasted dry. Each table on either side of us had totally different sandwiches which looked 100% better than what we had. There was no fruit this year, nothing chocolatey, just a bunch of bread. No honey or lemon either. \n\nIt was also our birthday and we didn't get any type of dessert but I watched multiple tables (literally both tables got birthday desserts with candles.

She's been to almost every afternoon tea service in the South Bay so I decided to take her up to SF for something special. Be sure to make a reservation on OpenTable a week in advance! I made a special request to be seated by the window. (It's worth it, trust me.) The view facing Union Square is AMAZING. Everything about The Rotunda is just so classy and beautiful.\n\nThe Rotunda is located on the 4th floor of Neiman Marcus. There is a private elevator on the street (across from the Chanel boutique) that will take you right up. The server promptly seated us at 3:15 PM. I overheard the server saying to the party next to us that they get around 25 total parties for afternoon tea on Sundays. That makes sense since the service is only from 2:30 to 4:00 PM! You can choose to have the lunch menu (get the lobster club sandwich if you do!!), but we settled on just the afternoon tea service menu. The signature tea service is $45/per person and it's honestly more than enough food + drink. You can upgrade to the grand tea service for $55 (includes a glass of gloria ferrer private cuvee brut nv) or the royal tea service for $60 (includes a glass of etoile brut rose nv).\n\nYou get a savory chicken consomme to warm your belly for starters. I decided to pick the Earl Grey tea and my mom settled on the Yellow Lemon tea. Milk was provided on request. The popover is ALWAYS my favorite part of getting tea here. It's light and has a hollow center; I would recommend you eat it while it's still warm. The strawberry butter is delightful, but I always run out before I finish my popover. I usually just take the lemon curd or devonshire cream from the afternoon tea service and put it on the rest of my popover LOL. I love that the tea sandwiches, scones, fruit preserves, and petite sweets switch every single time you go. This time around, the second tier and third tier were amazing. The blueberry muffins were super soft and flavorful. The tapioca with cream and raspberry wasn't too sweet. The crab rolls were honestly some of the BEST I have ever had (and there was a lot of crab meat). I didn't enjoy my assortment that much the last time I came (in 2015), but this time I was definitely floored. Everything was delicious and I was definitely impressed. Overall, service was great (I got at least 4 to 5 refills of hot water in my tea), the snacks came out really fast and filled us up quickly, and the view was to-die for.

There plenty of other afternoon tea options in the city that have MUCH better food and service.\n\nCame here the other day to celebrate my friends birthday. This is probably my second or third time here, and every time I'm left feeling disappointed. The atmosphere is probably the only redeeming quality - located on top of Neiman Marcus, you get a view of a nice open room with a stained glass ceiling and a wall of windows on one side looking out over Union Square. This place is especially nice during Christmas time when they have the gigantic Christmas tree in the center of the room.\n\nWhile the staff here is friendly, they tend to forget about you and we were literally here for 3 hours with all the time it took waiting for the food, and waiting for the check. The other downside is the price. ~$50 for afternoon tea is quite hefty, especially for the amount of food you get. The tea sandwiches are just sad looking; small, dry, and stale. I'm appalled that they would charge so much money when none of the scones or desserts tasted fresh, in comparison to other tea places who bake their own cakes and scones. The tea was good, but thats pretty hard to mess up. All in all, I will never come back here again.

The wait immediately brings us something fancy...I can't even remember what the French word for it was, but the translation is that it was a tiny-looking biscuit with chicken gravy, to get us started. I don't know how that fits with tea time, but it was GOOD!\n\nNext came the popovers with strawberry butter. I had never had a popover before, but it was all kinds of buttery and flaky deliciousness!!! We hadn't even placed our tea orders and already I'm feeling satiated. I ordered a regular tea time with peppermint tea. I was able to swap out some of the tea sandwiches due to dietary restrictions, as was someone else in my party. They were very accommodating with everything on their tea menu, which is rare (a lot of tea places only allow you to have the food as-is, or require advance notice of dietary restrictions). The tea also had several sweet treats, including scones and a petit cake (not a petit-for though, just a small yummy cake).\n\nI impressed not only with the location, but also the flavor and taste of the tea and other foods. My only gripe was that the bathroom was super basic and not all that nice. I just expected more from Neiman Marcus, and definitely didn't expect a basic bathroom! But it was still a fun tea experience.\n\nPlease note that tea time at the rotunda is only for a limited amount of time daily, and spots fill up fast, so definitely make sure to rsvp in advance for weekend time slots.

This is an iconic San Francisco experience and should be special . My husband booked it for my birthday , we were to dine enjoy a bottle of champagne and then head into the mothership shortly after it opened so enjoy a day of shopping ....\n\nThe wait ...we entered the entrance off the side to reach the Rotunda . It was dirty ....the elevator up was dirty with ketsup smeared onto the walls. When we came it the atmosphere was cold - I do not think all the lights were on .  We were greeted by a nice hostess , we were first  ones there ! But truly the hostess should have greeted us at the first elevator up . \n\nShe escorted us to our seat middle of the window to a tiny table . I was pretty excited . I told her we would like a larger table as the space was tight and I knew I would be bumped with every pass of the waiter . She offered to seat us in a booth but told we could only have two seats .  I decided to stick it out as she assured me it would not be bad . \n\nFast forward three seconds later the waiter for the other table squeezes by me shoving me into my table. Evidently the devil flickered in my eyes because my husbands face turned pale at the sloppy service . The waitress came over in her wrinkled day two warring shirt and brought is a complimentary sample of the , I don't know what they called it but it was fatty chicken stock with out salt and a tiny little parmesan cheese wafer that  for some reason defied the laws of nature and I had to chew it for about five minutes to work through it .....it seemed like some weird ration one might give to a military person or maybe people spies you trying to barley keep alive between waterboarding and interrogating them  . Food that you would eat  if your life depend on it , but something you would never choose if any other option existed within two hundred miles . \n\nAnd then it happened again and this time I got whacked in the head by the waiter whom instead of going around squeezed by me by literally shimming between me and the balcony of terror temping fate my head my fabulous shirt and three very hot beverages .  Again my husband saw in my eyes the beyond recoverable experience jump right over the railing into the abyss of disgust . \n\nI called it, I gave in as the waiter was coming once again carrying hot drinks ...one can only play that roulette dare so many times until they lose and truly I would rather save my adorable top and the hassle of suing them for burns on my back when he doused me in fire hot liquid ..... \n\nI was mad . I could not leave without really letting the manager know what an epic disappointment  this experience was ....not to vent, but to remind him that someone owns that store and they operate it for prophet and they would like me (my husband ) to generously  part with our dollars in exchange for some very lovely jewels - which we had planned on doing right after dessert ....the manger didn't seem to care ...actually,  he really wasn't present in the experience at all ....he left the entire front of the house staff manage  decisions  all by themselves . Lol.....wow. \n\nThis experience is not for real shoppers or most adults unless you are trying to relive some childhood moment of high tea or doing a granny and me yes ....it isn't great because it isn't valued by the employees ...lobster is lobster - this is supposed to be an experience . People don't pay you for food they get at the grocery - they pay for elevating the food they make themselves ....to be fair the preview of the meal was horrid as well ....\n\nI wonder if they snicker at you in the kitchen ( if they really have one - if could be prepacked airplane food )  while they \" out  snob \" you into trying to making  you feel lucky enough to be served by them .... \n\nPro tip - try the Waterbar on the Embarcadero , it was My husbands happy birthday wife Hail Mary Save and it was fabulous  !   Here are some photos of my birthday brunch at the Waterbar ....cheers may you choose wisely and enjoy your day !

I celebrated my birthday here on a Saturday for afternoon tea/late lunch at 2:30pm. Our party of 4 arrived twenty minutes early, checked in, and promised to be seated closer to the reservation time while waiting for a table near the windows to clear. \n\nElle(n) waited on us, with Pam taking over during Elle's lunch break. Wonderful ladies! Elle memorized our order effortlessly and brought over warm chicken consomm\u00e9 with a mini crescent shaped biscuit. Walter served the flaky popovers and strawberry butter. I accepted the additional popover offered-- for some reason, the strawberry butter tasted better the second time around! Sweeter and I could definitely taste the strawberries. \n\nI ordered afternoon signature tea for 2, $45 each and picked Chamomile and the Nuit a Versailles tea from the French Dammann Fr\u00e8res collection. Happy they provided tea cups for all four of us and refilled hot water (in teapots) and iced water throughout the meal. I wasn't sure what to expect with the latter tea but Hazel C.'s review convinced me to try it. Green tea with notes of peach and many other ingredients, including kiwi. Peach in tea? Give me a cup! The chamomile was great as well, soothing. \n\nThe star of the meal was the NY Strip steak! Cooked medium well since Elle indicated the meat would've been tough if well done. Each bite remained juicy, tender, and savory while still cooked thoroughly. Green beans, whole flattened grilled onions, and fingerling potatoes accompanied the dish ($30). Enjoyed this so much and it wasn't even my order! \n\nI introduced my fam to Burrata cheese with beets salad ($19.50). They like beets and Burrata is so good! It was served cold with sweet balsamic vinaigrette on top. I prefer warm melted Burrata. The salad arrived with butter lettuce, avocado, crispy kale, 4 slices of toasted baguette, red & golden beet squares, and green goddess dressing on the side. \n\nPlentiful lobster in the bisque. Creamy, everyone enjoyed it. $12.50 per bowl \n\nLobster club ($32) with thin cut fries was a hit. More expensive than the steak! \n\nI docked off half a star for lack of notable color in the tea sandwiches/dessert. Delicious offerings with simple two tier presentation.\n\nMini berry cheesecakes with fig slices on top-- mind boggling! I've eaten fig newtons but never the real thing, yum!\n\nMini chocolate cupcakes with thick cream cheese-like frosting, no buttercream here. \n\nTheir buttery scones had both regular and golden raisins, delightful with the lemon curd, cream, and raspberry preserves. \n\nPistachio meringues were sweet and sticky. Enjoyable. \nCoffee cake was ok, not memorable. \n\nThe savory sandwiches included: tasty mini chicken salad squares topped with half a grape, cucumber & cream cheese triangles, smoked salmon triangles with bread crusts shaved off, and squares of an egg salad club. \n\nElle asked if I preferred chocolate or vanilla and presented me with a vanilla birthday cupcake swirled with a dark chocolate frosting, embellished with assorted berries, plus a lit candle and purple orchid!\n\nBeautiful restaurant with exquisite views of Union Square,  sans construction.

There's a small tea selection and they pick a few sweets and 6 finger sandwiches for you.  When I say finger sandwiches, they really were the size of your finger.  You won't be coming here to get full, but to nosh on little bites.  And if you want more, you can order off their menu.\n\nI recommend to make reservations because the place tends to get full.", "author": "Julie C."}

It was crowded with people waiting for tables around noon.  We were seated about the ten o clock position from the entrance, just past the bar area.  Being a larger party of nine, we were comfortable and the tables are nicely spaced.  Though we were mainly here for their signature lobster sandwich, many of the menu items were tempting.  Each meal comes with complimentary individual portions of a small cup of chicken consomme and their famed popover (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5Rg1Sm6BnJPb9FCxcaPDzg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  After a short deliberation with a friend, we agreed to share the two following:\n\n1) Crab and Shrimp Louie salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-bhp-sz4KWhk8fUFaGcWgg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Salad?  As a meal?  Yes, this is one that won't make you feel like a grazing cow as the fresh shrimp and Dungeness crab meat is lusciously dressed with a rich creamy dressing.\n\n2) Lobster club sandwich (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=regnXeDq4VN-lyJUSZAqwA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This is what I get every time I've come here... old habits are hard to break.  Our host reminded us the option to change the potato chips to French fries which we did.  Just as a remember with a decent amount of lobster meat that perfectly meshes with the bacon.  Since Pos Trio is no longer, this is the only one to my knowledge in the City these days.\n\nThey've maintained this relatively old time department store/restaurant which used to house City of Paris.  The skylight, like the one at the previous Emporium now Westfield, are landmarks to our fair city and are bright reminders of San Francisco of old.  There are romantic window tables that give a birds' eye view of Union Square just across the street.  Been here for afternoon tea which is popular here.\nOur waiter was very efficient and cordial without being to overwhelming, meeting our menu requests, getting share plates, and giving us general information.  Being our host's birthday and having a child at our table, he also presented us a birthday bonus for them both.\nPrices have gone up since my last visit with the sandwich in the $30 range now.\nCan't afford to regularly eat like this, but certainly worth the guilty pleasure once in a while.", "author": "Mike C."}

Not too thick nor too watery... and not salty like some places... just perfect.  Then share the following...Complement the bisque with the lobster deviled eggs ... and share an order of the lobster club (get it with the side salad instead of the fries...)  if there are just two of you.

This review is exclusively for their high tea.\n\nI discovered the rotunda circa 2012, and have made it one of those special places I eat at once a year. I LOVED the Rotunda! The Rotunda was the first place I've ever had high tea, and it forever held a special place in my heart... Until Oct. 3, 2015, my birthday.\n\nI had a day in the city planned with a spa and then high tea at the R. I was so excited because I LOVED high tea, especially at The Rotunda!\n\nWe were sat graciously by the window. We were given lunch menus and I gasped to myself thinking \"oh no, do they not have high tea right now?!\" When we inquired with our server, a younger man with an interesting name that I do not remember, he was PISSED that we wanted high tea, and he wasn't afraid to show it... Okay... That's weird? Should be easy money for you buddy. His saving grace was the bus boy, or server assistant, that handed us our turnovers and refilled our waters, etc. he was adorable and extremely pleasant to talk with. Can't remember his name either, but he was tall, slender, and had a deep voice.\n\nOur server remained 100% aloof through out the entire service. I'm really not sure what my mom and I did wrong for him to ignore us and treat us like horrid customers. Anywho.\n\n It was my bday and I was excited to be there. And then our tier of goodies was plopped down onto our table. You know what else was plopped down? The food onto the tiers. It LITERALLY looked like the chef threw everything on there. And I have pics to prove it. \n\nUnfortunately, The Rotunda has ruined my yearly visit.

I never thought I'd step foot in here but because it was paid for by the company, I was lucky. To get in, you take the elevator on the Geary side of Neiman Marcus or you can take the escalators, diner's discretion. I really liked the decor inside. The design on the dome glass is really pretty and the bright light from outside helped light up the place. You can sit at a table, bar, or booth.\n\nWe were first served a Chicken Consomme upon seating. It's in a cute little cup with a little puff on the side. Though the look is fancy, it's really just chicken stock. I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and I liked it. Wasn't too sweet and can still taste the lemonade. Next, we were served a popover with strawberry butter. MMMM STRAWBERRY BUTTERRR Gimme more pls.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Lobster Egg Rolls. The egg rolls were fried to a golden color. It was crispy and yummy; make sure to dip the sauce! We also ordered the Lobster Bisque. It was really rich and creamy. Super filling, not ideal before a meal for small eaters like me haha. Another app we had was the Ahi Tuna Tartare. I never had raw fish until this dish. All fresh ingredients. Make sure you get some of the sauce at the bottom\n\nFor entree, I had the Grilled Pacific Coast Swordfish Sandwich. The sandwich is pretty small but the size of the fish was big. I was not able to put the whole thing in my mouth... I liked it but not as much as I liked the Lobster Club. My friends all ordered it so I wanted to order something else to try.  Also, the portion size for the Lobster Club is much bigger than the Swordfish.\n\nTo end lunch, we had 2 desserts. The Strawberry Napoleon Special was my favorite. The strawberry cream was tasty and the crisp on top made it like a nice sandwich. The bottom was some nutty spread that I can't remember too much of. We also had the dessert trio. The lemon fruit tart was definitely my least favorite because it was too lemony for me lol. The chocolate ice cream was ok... but the Thai Tea creme brulee was something different. It didn't have a heavy Thai tea flavor but the creme brulee was done nicely.\n\nAll in all, I had a positive experience.

In fact, I suggest, no implore every Bay Area native to get to The Rotunda at least once in their lives. Take their loved ones, go with a friend, take people who happen to be tourists looking for the typical San Francisco adventure, this is the place to go thanks to the ambiance under the glass dome. While others are shopping you're busy enjoying varied fine dining like sipping on sparkling wine, choosing from ten different types of teas or even munching on a lobster sandwich, anything and everything is here. Is it overindulgent? It sure is and I wouldn't have it any other way! \n\nI was lucky enough to sample my first spot of tea under the dome with a real veteran of The Rotunda, Christine who comes here all the time with friends and family to just shoot the breeze and enjoy the people and view watching. Thankfully, Christine knew exactly what to do from getting a easy reservation on OpenTable and specifically requesting a window table, which even though it was a Sunday was an easy accomplishment because we didn't get there until 3pm and they close at 4pm on Sunday so there was plenty of seating to go around. We didn't even need to look at the full menu this time around as the first menu on our table was for the Afternoon Tea at Neiman Marcus, served from 2:30-4pm on Sundays, it features 4 of their tea sandwiches, a freshly baked scone, 4 petite sweets, fruit preserves and devonshire cream (and that was the best I have ever tasted mind you!). At 45 dollars for all of that food plus a pot of tea for one person was a real deal we then asked our server Elle if we could get a second pot of tea for each person and she said it would only be five extra dollars and we were sold with two different pots of tea and all of that food for basically 25 dollars a person! True tea dining elegance on a decent budget and I absolutely loved it!\n\nWhat I also loved was the complimentary popover we were served right at the top of meal along with a strawberry butter spread. It was the perfect companion to go with my pot of Jardin Bleu tea which was a blend of teas from India and China, flavored with rhubarb, wild strawberry and cornflower petals. It was the suggested tea of our server Elle and I wasn't disappointed, it was sweet strawberry heaven in a cup and saucer. Then imagine my surprise when out comes an amuse bouche of chicken consume served with a layered parmesan cheese crescent. The perfect savory treat to go with the sweet tea I was sipping on.\n\nOnce the food came out on the platter and I realized it was the perfect amount to go with my tea. I particularity loved the garlic parmesan scone and the smoked salmon with a spread on a piece of white bread. Everything tasted perfect, especially the desserts like the chocolate mousse bite and the warm apple cinnamon bite, both were top notch that combined with the endless warm water refills to my tea leaves in my tea pot provided the ultimate way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. Things of note: it was kind of cramped sitting alongside our small window table as the walkway around the entire atrium concourse was not very wide and since there's so much construction going on on Stockton Street outside that our view was slightly compromised. But I still loved everything about our day at The Rotunda. It wasn't super packed (it was January) so it wasn't teeming with people and you could clearly hear your tea drinking companion sitting across from you and take the side elevator on Geary Street and it will zoom you right up to the fourth floor without having to go through the Neiman Marcus store. The Rotunda is bright, airy and clean and the perfect way to spend a day with a friend or loved one talking and sipping for hours on end without even realizing it. The Rotunda is a true San Francisco experience that cannot be missed.", "author": "Jason F."}

The Rotunda has that elegant, pinkies-up ambiance that must draw regular customers from elite, electric-fenced enclaves like Pac Heights and Seacliff, but this strictly SoMa resident had never been before. I have to admit I had been curious to come here, and I found my prime opportunity when a former colleague of mine was willing to meet me here for lunch. Outside of the holidays, it was surprisingly easy to secure a reservation and make our way to the exclusive elevator.\n\nWhile we didn't score window seats since neither one of us was an Alioto, we still had a nice table overlooking the atrium under the magnificent stained glass dome (photo: http://bit.ly/1SVLKDD). The waiter had an air of boredom about him as he asked for our orders in the most impassive manner. In the meantime, we received our complementary popovers with strawberry butter (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYEM3Z). No complaints there as it was big, airy, and rather luxuriant for a starter to our meal. This was followed by a cup of consomm\u00e9 with a bite-size crostini (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ti5I8u), which we took our time sipping and nibbling, much to the chagrin of the waiter who rather boldly asked if he should take it away.\n\nUh no, we're just taking our time, sir. Regardless, we decided to start our lunch with the $14 Deviled Eggs, which were just four halves topped with smoked salmon, nori, paprika, and dill oil (photo: http://bit.ly/1NiPFew). Since we are both fans of this picnic staple, these were devoured quickly. My companion ordered the $22 Adobo Pulled Pork Cuban Sandwich, which struck me as an unusual menu option for such a hoity-toity place. It turned out to be a bit dried out even with ingredients like cured ham, Sonoma brinery pickles, Dijon, and gruyere cheese on a telera bun. It came with a generous side of sweet potato fries (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYEDNG).\n\nIt was just middling for the 1,180 calories it represented. Mine was marginally better, the $32 Lobster Club Sandwich with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and lemon aioli on toasted brioche with a side of Yukon Gold potato chips (photo: http://bit.ly/1rgp3QU). For the 440 calories saved over the Cuban, it was worth the extra ten bucks even if the lobster was not the freshest I've ever tasted. There was no room for dessert even though we were somewhat tempted by the $10 box of Neiman Marcus Chocolate Chip Cookies. However, since we had to watch our girlish figures and didn't wear our cellulite-hiding caftans...\n\nSo here's to the girls on the go--\nEverybody tries.\nLook into their eyes,\nAnd you'll see what they know:\nEverybody dies.\nA toast to that invincible bunch,\nThe dinosaurs surviving the crunch.\nLet's hear it for the ladies who lunch--\nEverybody rise!\nRise!\nRise!

Just being in the restaurant alone gives me the warm fuzzies and a smile from ear to ear. Grab your girlfriends and credit cards to come enjoy its wonders. Oh and the shopping! \n\nFood - \nComplimentary consomme - What a rich and elegant way to start the meal. If you are anything like me, broths is one of my favorite things on this planet. Smooth, rich, and complex flavors without any fattiness. \n\nComplimentary popover with strawberry cream - The popover is flakey and airy. Perfectly baked to golden perfection accompanied by a chilled strawberry cream. The cream wasn't too sweet or heavy which I was very thankful for. Don't think strawberry cream cheese! \n\nLobster bisque - Savory and smooth. I was thankful I shared it with my husband because my portion was the perfect amount. There is a slight bitter after taste to it which I didn't enjoy as much but it was very tasty still. My husband didn't like it as much. \n\nLobster fries - Tempura fried lobster pieces. Plump and a generous portion. Crispy golden bites with steaming tender lobster on the inside. I wish I had a little wedge of lemon with it but it was one of my favorites here. \n\nTamarind Braised Pork Belly - A special item of the week so you may or may not be able to enjoy this wonderful dish. The pork was melt in your mouth tender. The tamarind gives a brightness to the fatty cut of the pork. My fear was the that tamarind may be too sour but it was very well balanced. Sweet, savory, and tangy! \n\nService- The service here is impeccable. My server was Tim. He was professional, polite, and extremely attentive. If the food was taking a little long (which I didn't think it was at all) he was sure to swing by to assure us the food is on it's way. They have their staff well organized here as they work like ninjas swooping in to remove finished dishes and every bit or crumb you  may have left. It definitely is fine-dining! \n\nI am dreaming of my next visit here. Cost-wise it didn't break the bank because my husband and I shared all of our dishes. We like variety so we shared all the dishes equally which the restaurant divided for us in the kitchen. As you look at my pictures, keep in mind the portions you see are 1/2 of the actual dish.

After trying a couple of times to get into The Rotunda and the wait list being too long, I finally caved and made reservations . . . two weeks in advance. I was so excited because it seemed like people couldn't stop talking about The Rotunda and my gosh is it beautiful. The stained glass at the top, a reproduction of the coat-of-arms of Paris, stirs up fond European memories. The words are Latin; the translation is \"Tossed by the waves but never sunk.\" That may be, but the ensuing experience left me more than a little seasick. The magnificent setting offers a perfect contrast to the lazy and pretentious restaurant within.\n\nTo start, I was served chicken consomm\u00e9 in a dirty dish that had fresh lipstick stains. I could literally take my napkin and wipe part of it off. When I complained, our server didn't apologize; he all but laughed it off. \"Oh, we're known for that.\" Are you really? He picked up the dirty cup, placed it on the table to the left of us, and walked away.\n\nWhen the hostess came by to seat other guests at the table next to us, she acted surprised, picked it up and dropped it off on the table after that. I never actually saw this thing make it to the kitchen. It may still be making the rounds now. Does anyone take responsibility for dirty dishes here?\n\nAt this point, my fianc\u00e9 had to excuse himself to the restroom, but the men's room was out of order and Neiman Marcus was closed. So they had a hostess awkwardly walk him through the closed store to the 5th floor and sit by the door, waiting to escort him back. This, after we saw them let another woman walk freely to drop off a Rent the Runway package on the same floor. Never mind the inconvenience of a closed restroom, or the guests who doubtlessly had to wait for the hostess to finish her babysitting duties. Are customers so distrusted here?\n\nAnd then, yes, there was food. It was good, if unexceptional. I had the salmon filet, decently prepared on a fairly nice quinoa salad. Nothing to write home about. The fianc\u00e9 had the chicken and waffles (the day's special) which was, likewise, neither objectionable nor memorable in any way.\n\nAnyway, this is San Francisco. We know to expect good food. We really came here for the ambiance and the service and, apart from the lovely setting, it was a MAJOR let down.", "author": "Leann W."}

Service is swift and sweet, linens pressed and clean, view of Union Square unbeatable. They even have an afternoon tea, which I was there to partake - and the hostesses were polite and helpful when I created a reservation. Even better? They seated me at one of the best two-toppers in the house, along the giant glass window with lots of spectacular afternoon light.\n\nIf their food was as up to par as everything else, this review would have a lot more stars. I ordered the Nuit \u00e1 Versailles, a wonderful tea with essence of bergamot, kiwi, peach, orange blossoms, and violets. Honestly it was a fantastic tea by Dammann. The platter, however, left something to be desired. \n\nThe popover was, as always, delightful. Along with their strawberry butter and the chicken consumm\u00e9 palate cleanser, Neiman's knows this is their \"bread and butter\", literally, and does it well. Even the scone, paired with a delicious jam, clotted cream, and lemon curd, were good. The sandwiches and desserts though - the crux of the meal - were substandard. The sandwiches don't need to be complicated or check off every box of flavor, they only need to highlight one. This wasn't it. A small triangle of open-faced cucumber and cream cheese...is something I would serve at a child's tea party. Not for $48.\n\nThe dessert felt forced - forced? Yes. Like, \"We don't need to put that much effort into it, here's something seasonal - a tiny pumpkin cupcake in a wrapper, same with a little pecan cheesecake or something, and a cookie.\" Seriously? A COOKIE!? It wasn't even the best cookie I've ever had, it was way down the list. If you had ordered a bunch of cookies from Cookie Good and passed them off as your own I'd have been more impressed, but no.\n\nAnd I spent a lot of money on this one plate - without champagne, mind you - to be underwhelmed. I used to come here with my grandmother and had better memories but maybe it used to be different back then?

I heard about it in culinary school 6 years ago, specifically for the afternoon/high tea experience.  It's been on my to do list but you know, floating around the bottom,  cuz at my age,  who gets \"excited\" over tea like woooo what a rager. Anyhow ...\n1. They immediately started us off with (sf's finest tap water lol, though they do have bottled and sparkling if you're feeling extra snobby) a small cup of beautifully clear consume and a bite size puff pastry, shape/size reminiscent of an oyster cracker. The other complimentary thing was a HUGE pop over,  texture wonderfully chewy but crisp still and unbelievably light/airy.  It came with an impressive strawberry butter which at first I was skeptical about but noooooo amazeballs!\n2. Lobster bisque- if I go someplace and it's on the menu I compulsively must buy it.  I NEED IT! *spongebob. Really let the lobster shine! I don't think there was much of any cream used,  it may have been thickened with rice like OLD SCHOOL.  Had a small plop of clean lobster meat as garnish as well as chive batons, pretty but would have tasted better if chopped more finely,  only came with 3/4 so that didn't really help the situation either.\n3. Tea!! Skip story time ...(We messed up and you need a tea reservation,  despite it being a Monday!  Lunch is separate from tea menu.  We were devastated,  luckily towards the end of service our amazing server Noe informed us tea was available after all! I am assuming there was a cancelation?) \nSo once we found out we all ordered the most expensive option $60/person that came with a lovely sparkling ros\u00e9 ) IMPRESSIVE, went with 2 friends and all 3 of the teas were fabulous (lemongrass, one with strawberry, and the bergamot/floral one NOT earl grey).  The egg salad divine ontop mini croissants though wish the croissant had been warmed first. The chicken or tuna? Sandwich who knows it was that bland honestly, probably just an off day?  The cutest mini crab rolls, again seafood allowed to shine. Simple. Delish. Mini scones alright, not my favorite but not big on scones personally period, usually too dry for me. Ok, now that I'm writing this it seems like a lot was meh/bad but the service here is really above n beyond and it's nice to feel special! Lunch food 5 stars,  tea food/pastries 3, service 6, ambiance 6, tea itself 5. Would go again... Like tomorrow if I could afford it.\n\nGenuine negatives-1. I was overly excited to have devonshire/clotted cream again but it's not authentic here (No fault of their own;  it's just hard to find in USA) so yeah it's just cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche n whipped cream.  Yummy,  but don't get your hopes up if you've had the real deal before. 2. I'm a pastry chef so not impressed with the desserts but the \"coffee cake\" like thing very good n would highly recommend throwing some of their \"clotted cream\" on top . (3. There was no curry chicken sandwich) 4. When we called, the hostess said they were booked for tea but she also thought it was SUNDAY, how I know? Lol- when she said you HAVE to have a reservation for tea on weekends n I was like wait ... bitch it's Monday! !! Jebus... so we took a chance in went over in person anyway cuz I assumed she was just not the brightest/maybe wrong.", "author": "Monica H."}

I love when you walk in, it has a fancy stained glass ceiling with gold molding and its amazing! Everything about this place just says fancy and I loved everything here. \n\nThis place is known for their high tea and lunch. I was having a girls day and it was perfect for our group. We sat at a corner round table and we were immediately attended to. The server was extremely knowledgable about the different teas and what it came with. We were a party of 6 and each pair ordered a set of tea which came with a 3 tiered plate of small desserts and snacks I would say. Kind of like a tea and crumpets type thing. But the presentation was beautiful. They first serve you small cup of this chicken broth stuff and bread and it's soooo goood! The Jardin Bleu tea is what I tried and it was beyond yummy! I also tried the lobster club, and let me just day that sandwich is the best thing there! Everyone else got different entrees but I think the lobster club I got was the best. The 3-tier plates had cucumber sandwiches, macarons, and a number of different small bites. They were all delicious. \n\nIt is a bit pricey but it's worth it if it's your first time. \n\nThis is a perfect place for a girls day out!

I really wanted to like you, but your Grand Afternoon Tea was just not worth my $55 + tax and tip. I've tried many Afternoon Teas all around the world and usually they're around the same price; however, I leave full from the food (because typically it's unlimited food), not the tea. Today, to feel somewhat full, I drank two pots of tea to suppress my hunger. \n\nSo the difference between the Signature and Grand was the Grand came with a glass of champagne. Anyways, the Afternoon Tea came with 2 scones (a savory scone and a sweet scone along with clotted cream, strawberry preserves, and lemon curd), 4 tiny finger sandwiches (chicken salad, egg and bacon, cucumber and cream cheese, and smoked salmon), petite fours (a macaron, dulce de leche, chocolate mousse cake, and a chocolate chip cookie), and a pot of tea of your choosing (I went with Earl Grey, which was pretty good). \n\nThe restaurant itself is really nice and the rotunda is beautiful. Our service was great until after we were done with our food as we waited for our bill, but we didn't mind the wait. We were even seated before our reservations, which was nice. The complimentary popover with the strawberry butter was probably the highlight of my time there. The popover was baked perfectly, and the strawberry butter complimented the popover so well. I wish I was able to get more of the popover. Also, we were given a complimentary chicken consomm\u00e9, which is basically fancy chicken broth, which was tasty. However, I wouldn't go back, sorry.", "author": "Gloriene E."}

Great view of Union Square (and the seasonal skating rink).  Too bad the construction on the street below never seems to end.\n\nFood was very good as usual:  lobster bisque, lobster egg roll, tuna tartar, lobster club.  We told the server that we will share the lobster club, and she brought it out on two plates, which was nice.  She also let me substitute potato chips with French fries.  Their selection of wines by the glass was pretty good, and Mazzoni Pinot Grigio complemented our dishes nicely.  Generous pour - at least 6oz.\n\nService was spot on, attentive with good pace.

Their signature popover was great as usual, but their tea sandwiches fell flat.\n\nFor $45 you get your own pot of tea, 4 little pieces of finger sandwiches (each piece was 1/8th  of a sandwich bread... so the four pieces were equivalent to half a piece of bread for me, since the cucumber and smoked salmon ones were open-faced sandwiches). Also, the sandwich bread was cold and stale as if they had been refrigerated too long, or they pre-made all their sandwiches and fridged them before serving. I've had much better tea sandwiches, including homemade ones. Their scones were good - there was one savory and one sweet. I have not much to say for the rest of the sweets as I didn't eat them. \n\nWould return for just regular lunch but skip the afternoon tea and try elsewhere.", "author": "K. N."}

Understand that we knew we were arriving as the first guests of the day, but it would have been nice if we were greeted coming off the elevator, especially since the store didn't open for another hour, not just having to walk around to the hostess stand like at the neighborhood Denny's.\n\nWe were promptly seated at a tiny \"two-top\" table that resulted in my wife effectively seated in the aisle with her chair back only inches from the railing of the rotunda.  This resulted in everyone walking by having to utter those special words \"excuse me\" as they tried to shimmy by including the wait staff with trays of hot and cold beverages.\n\nThis situation should have been addressed...oh wait, we tried.  When we were seated we asked for a different table but were told \"no\" there were other larger parties coming in.  We were offered a booth...but wanted the view.  So let me understand, we could have had a booth that would accommodate 4 people, but not a table that would accommodate the exact same number of guests...this was strike number two.\n\nThe third strike was the service that looked completely uninterested in being on the job...combined with the palette cleansing opener...not at all sure what she mumbled but it was a warm cup of ... Something that tasted exactly like the grease drippings poured from the pan used for roasting a Thanksgiving turkey, accompanied by a small, scratch that, tiny, scratch that, micro, Parmesan crisp that tasted two days old.\n\nWe left, went down to the embarcadero and had a fabulous meal, outstanding and welcoming service at the Waterbar.  Crisis adverted! Based on this experience we will enjoy the beauty of the Rotunda from afar and not plan on dining there again.  It was awful enough to not want to waste our time on future trips into the City.", "author": "Paul K."}

The steak was a bit over done, even though I asked for medium rare. I didn't feel like sending it back as I was starving. That could also be the the reason why everything tasted so good? Har! \n\nThe dessert and drinks were equally delicious. The dessert serving size was a tad small for the price. I'd expected little more.

This was cooked medium, just as we asked for (If there's a next time, I would go for medium rare). The dish had potatoes, green beans, and onions... all smothered with mushrooms in a mushroom sauce, topped with black truffle butter.\n- Andean Queen Quinoa Pasta: This is one of their lighter options. A quinoa pasta dish filled with corn, squash, green onions, spinach, tomato, garlic basil butter and goat cheese. A little bland and lacking of any substantial flavor. I would skip out on this! \n- Complimentary tiny cup of consomm\u00e9 and miniature crostini: Cute and tasty little starter.\n- Complimentary popovers with strawberry butter: Quite the generous portion of a popover.

The strawberry was faint, but enough to give some flavor.\n\nService was wonderful--friendly and to the point!

If you don't care about that, move on. Gotta read the reviews that matter to you, right? I got yo back and you are most welcome *fist bump*\n\nAnyhow, I didn't necessarily read all the reviews on here beforehand (sorry - don't verbally abuse me). But I certainly skimmed and scanned like the boss I was in college! After \"thorough analysis\" on the Rotunda, I understood that:\n1. I probably should make a reservation in advance\n2. Afternoon high tea starts at 2:30pm \n3. There is alcohol served (I am a lovable drunk)\n\nFYI, the Rotunda is on the 4th floor at Neiman Marcus. The only reason why I point that out is because my skimming and scanning failed me, and I didn't know which floor to go to. Just knew \"up\". So, I acted like I knew where I was going (clearly didn't) and kept going marching upwards on those dreaded escalators until we saw it. Stressful times, but we made it safely.\n\nWhen we got there, the place was really packed. Luckily, I got to laugh at others who were still waiting and was seated almost immediately. You'll surely be blown away by the atrium and stain-glassed dome. And if you want to become Instafamous like me, you can roughly take 82394923 pictures of this dome, choose one, and subsequently apply the most immaculate filter you can ever imagine and act like you made zero efforts to pretty this picture up.\n\nThe general afternoon tea package comes with your choice of dammann freres tea (hehe... almost looks like \"damnnnnn\"), 6 tea sandwiches, scones, and random sweets that I am too lazy to describe and will post a picture instead. You will also be given three options:\n1. Signature tea service: $45/person\n2. Grand tea service: $55/person\n3. Royal tea service: $60/person\n\nChampagne is served for the Grand Tea and Royal Tea services only. Since I'm a total noob when it comes to champagne and logically thought \"hey, what can get me drunk but also save money\", I decided to get the Grand tea service.\n\nOverall, the service was great - really cool and helpful waiter we had. You should generally get chicken consomme first as a starter, then your teas, then BAM - bigass thing full of stuff to eat. It's surprisingly a lot and the experience all together. \n\nI'm only docking this place one star because the sandwiches remind me of airport sandwiches. You know, the sandwiches with crappy bread that you have to get on the go when you don't have time to dine in? Just me personally venting - rough times.\n\nAside from that, I'd go back again. The table next to us looked like they had yummy food, so I'm thinking I should try something like that the next time around. I probably looked like a creep staring, but whatever. Just remember to do your thorough analysis of this place and book in advance!! Thank me later :)", "author": "Peter C."}

A selection of cream, jam, and lemon curd accompanied the scones. We felt the sandwiches were mediocre. They were a bit dry and plain. But the desserts were delicious.

I crave their popovers and chicken consomm\u00e9 every time I'm shopping at Union Square.\n\nOn this special occasion, I requested window seating for my girlfriend who got engaged, and directly across the street is Vera Wang's bridal shop (formerly Jessica McClintock).  We watched ladies pick out iconic wedding gowns and judged from our seats, fun times.  My girlfriend was ecstatic to have found a wedding dress just by watching prospective brides; thank goodness she's not a bridezilla (^0^)\n\nThank you to the Rotunda staff for making our afternoon extra special, especially our server Joshua.

To be honest, the food is OKAY. \n\nBut people don't really come here for the food...people come here for the gorgeous Ambiance.  The architecture and stained glass windows are just a site to see, and really make the dining experience worth while.  \n\nEating at the Rotunda is your chance to feel boujee  (Fancy for those of you who don't know what that means) and is a great place to visit for special occasions.  \n\nReservations are highly recommended and if you're with a big party, you might want to consider renting out the private room.  However, the private room is off to the side (by the entrance) and you don't get to take in the gorgeous architecture as you eat.

I got the grand set and royal set. The bread was dry, nothing spectacular, and the desserts were awful. There was nothing unique about the desserts and it did not taste good. Two of the desserts such as the mini pecan pie and mini macarons, I've seen for sale at Trader joes. Two sets are unbelievably overpriced for a small quantity and the quality. There wasnt even any effort in presentation, it was all just tossed onto the tier. They have the audacity to charge $55/$60 per set for that?! Something I can pick up at any typical market and call it \"high tea\"? They are situated in the perfect city for sweets and definitely have the money to hire a baker or purchase wholesale from another baker. \n\nService, our waiter was nice but again, for the price we're paying, it was not up to par. You can also see all the other waiters chatting it up near the door. Moreover,  my family helped clear the table for this other server and I always thanked him when he set something down, cleared the table, etc. he did not utter a \"you're welcome\" or \"thank you\" in return. Didn't introduce himself, didn't look like he wanted to be there. The tea cups are also stained, other settings were scratched up. Rotunda is supposed to be a top notch, classy restaurant but it did not feel like it. \n\nYou are essentially paying for the view and interior decor. No doubt the interior and stained glass is beautiful. You get a nice view of the construction across the street.\n\nOf course It is not their fault of that construction is underway but I guess the view was their selling point, not anymore. \n\nI've been to a lot of afternoon tea venues in the bay area, to other states, and other countries. This is by far the worst experience. For the last time, their food and service definitely killed any fancy ambiance this place was supposed to have.", "author": "Rachel L."}

You need to make a reservation for tea time way in advance because it books up fast.  I made a reservation about a week or two in advance for a Saturday time slot.  We showed up about 15-20 minutes early and it was nice that they seated us right away.  I appreciated that they didn't make us wait until our actual reservation time.  \n\nWe weren't seated by the window, but to be honest with all of the construction going on right now, I am not sure the window view would have been all that amazing.  Also, the seating kind of sucks since only one person gets a nice view of the rotunda, and the other person is left facing the other way.  Anyways, I thought the food and tea/champagne was overpriced.  Very easily after tax and tip, you can spend about $150 for two people.  I can think of much better meals I would prefer to spend $150 on for two people.  \n\nIf the food was extremely good, I wouldn't have minded.  But the little sandwiches seemed dry.  It seemed like they pre-made them hours ago and just left them out.  The bread was kinda dry and crusty.  The little sweets and scones were very good though but I feel like you can get good quality baked goods at one of the local bakeries for way less.  Also, I am not a fan of the popover.  The strawberry cream cheese definitely makes the popover way better though. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.", "author": "Jenn W."}

But on the other hand, the high tea platter was so-so. This is a review on their afternoon tea package.\n\nI think the venue is an amazing place, but I was kind of disappointed that we were seated towards the back (on the higher level) and not near the lights or window. I had made a reservation for seating, and I was surprised that we didn't get a great spot - it felt like we got more of a 'walk-in' type seating location. The wait staff is great though, our server was friendly and kept checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. The cooks (I think they were cooks) also actually came over and tried to make small talk as well.\n\nIn terms of the afternoon tea menus, they are all the same - the only difference is the addition of alcohol. My boyfriend and I both got the regular signature tea, without alcohol. In terms of the tea itself, their premium / unique blends are GREAT. They were tasty by themselves, and also had the most amazing aroma. The popover and strawberry  butter was definitely one of my favorite items that was served during the afternoon tea. It was an interesting experience because I've never had one, and when I opened it, it was almost hollow inside! None the less, it was tasty, and the strawberry butter was so noms with it. \n\nWhen it comes to the actual platter that was presented to us, there wasn't anything on it that I really enjoyed. I've had high tea at local places in Sacramento/Davis area, and I actually preferred their platters more than The Rotunda. The sandwiches were both good and bad - some (mainly the sandwiches on rye) had really dry bread. It seemed like it was stuck in the refrigerator and just pulled out - I wasn't a huge fan. Some of the other sandwiches (on white/yellow bread) were soft and delightful. When it comes to the desserts/other choices on the platter, there wasn't anything that I really loved. They were so-so, and once again, seemed like they were just pulled out of a fridge and not really fresh.\n\nI think the experience of afternoon tea here wasn't really worth the value. We had paid about 100$ for 2, and in terms of the quality of food and seating ; I probably wouldn't do it again. \n\nI would definitely give this place another try perhaps, but doing their regular breakfast/brunch menu, and not the signature tea.", "author": "Li S."}

Like everywhere else in SF, it gets pretty packed.\n\nSeating\nSeating can range from bar, group, or date setup. This place is pretty popular so plan accordingly.\n\nFeels\nAs you enter the room it feels very fancy pantsish. I was wearing a plaid shirt and shorts, though it is a fancy place I believe as long as you're wearing clothes you're good to go.\n\nFood\nComplimentary Bread & Strawberry Butter\nI was sold on this and didn't even have the main course yet. The bread was pretty huge (I envision a fat lobster/crab claw size). It's funny to see the servers with a basket full of them as they're walking around serving people. The bread was warm and fresh. Next came the strawberry butter, I don't if this was seasonal but I was definitely fortunate to have a taste of this. The sweet strawberry taste and the rich butter complimented the bread quite well. It was honestly pretty fulfilling so I would out for this bad boy.\n\nBread & Broth\nWe were first served with a mushroom sized piece of bread and broth. It's a flavorful taste dipping the broth to the bread, if eaten immediately it's delicious to get the crunch of the bread and flavor of the broth. I would recommend to chew 30 times before swallowing to savor the flavor.\n\nLobster Sandwich and Chips\nThe presentation of the sandwich was pretty neat. The sandwich was flavorful as the lobster was flavorful and bread provided extra comfort to the palate. The chips smelled and tasted fresh. It was a good mix adding together.\n\nCookies\nI was determined to try their desserts however we were super full. We decided to be light and simple and went with chocolate chip cookies. The cookie was served in a box and had a good balance of crunchy chewiness. The hint of caffeine was noticeable which wasn't a problem. Though I don't plan on using it (because of all the ingredients) recipe was provided too!\n\nCustomer Service:\nOur server was polite and pro-active with us. For dessert we were hoping to ask a small cup of fruit and we got it no charge. I am very appreciative of his service\n\nOverall:\n5 stars. I expected a delicious meal and I got it.

It was in a really cute cup and after I scarfed mine down, my boyfriend offered me his. I was trying to enjoy it but the waitress asked if I was finished and under panic, I said yes...it was too late but that was one of my biggest regrets. We also got this really fluffy pastry with strawberry butter. Strawberry butter delish.\n\nThe 3 tier tower came out and bottom row-your conventional sandwiches, ranging from LOX to your classic cucumber, then the one that I remembered was the salmon with goat cheese. I should have asked for a substitution because I literally hate goat cheese, I think it tastes old and gross-but that was my fault. We scarfed it down and chased it with the delicious tea to follow. Next tier-it was the sweets, I don't necessarily have a sweet tooth, but it was good, from thumbprint\ncookies to rich brownies, I approve. On the very top layer, our scone with fresh fruits.

We were greeted at the door and seated promptly, considering we had reservations (the waitlist had about a 45 minutes wait). I appreciate the host accommodating my request for a window table. This would be the best seat in the house, considering you get a 180 view of Union Square and all its glory.\n\nAs far as our meal goes, I indulged in a Crab Shrimp Salad, while my guest enjoyed the brisket (sandwich). We were served complimentary chicken broth and popovers (with strawberry butter). The popovers were melt in your mouth good!! Flakier than a croissant but just as delicate. The seafood in the salad was very fresh and complimented the Louie dressing, which seemed to be a light thousand island dressing. I enjoyed a glass of Prosecco, while my mother had their special Martini Royale. For the grand finale we shared an earl grey creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. You must try this!!! This satisfied my devilish sweet tooth. \n\nOverall, service was very hospitable and the food was of great quality. I will definitely be back for High Tea Time soon.", "author": "Sarin P."}

This year I was able to join them in on the festivities. She booked the reservation via open table a few months in advance (she's a planner) and requested to be seated near the window.\n\nThey were able to accommodate our request and did so in a timely manner. Our servers, Nicholas (and Pam when Nicholas went on break) were friendly and very personable. We started with complimentary popovers with strawberry butter- honestly, your visit to the rotunda isn't complete with having one (or two) of these bad boys. No celebration is complete without a little bubbly, so we went ahead and ordered the Gloria Ferrer Private Curvee Brut for $41/bottle and each of us had at least a glass or two as opposed to $10/glass. We also had another bottle of Prosecco but the name escapes me. \n\nThe birthday celebrant ordered the lobster club ($32) and it was one of the best lobsters sandwiches I've tasted in life. I prefer it over others because it's on nice buttery sliced bread as opposed to a big ass roll that takes away from the lobster. They do not skimp on the lobster or avocado. It's delicious- definitely a must have.\n\nI went ahead and ordered the Pan roasted northern halibut ($30) - it had gnocchi, scallops, corn, peas, and saffron broth. It was more like a soup entree than anything, but regardless of this it was delicious! The scallops were small, but flavorful. The gnocchi was nice and chewy. And the halibut was flaky and had a good bite to them. \n\nOur dining companions ordered the steak and shrimp Vietnamese salad ($28) and this was very fresh! The papaya noodles were made perfectly and the shrimp were decent sized. They also had the estancia ranch grass fed NY strip steak, she said she enjoyed it but I wasn't able to sneak a taste. At this point I'm 1.5 popovers, an 8th of a club, 4 glasses of bubbly and my own entree in! \n\nI highly recommend the Rotunda at Neiman Marcus if you're feeling a little Pancy (yes fancy with a P). Definitely make reservations in advance on open table. There is a separate entrance to the restaurant from Stockton Street, or you can also enter through the department store itself. \n\nI'll be back for more boujiness and I will be bringing mother here to enjoy their afternoon high tea ($45/person)\n\nLastly, here's a link if you'd like to take a look at their menu - http://www.neimanmarcusmenus.com/ordering/force_download.asp?filename=Proofs%2F193488_NM_ToGo_Rotunda_012+for+web%2E20150430144041%2Epdf (as of 9/17/15)", "author": "Kathleene E."}

Same for the cocktails. They are very standard.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-15", "description": "My parents aren't fans of going to downtown due to all the traffic, road constructions, etc.  Our recent visit to The Rotunda was quite spontaneous.\n\nThe Rotunda is located on the fourth floor inside Neiman Marcus.  Upon entering, you see a really pretty dome mosaic ceiling.  As the area is circular, there are tables lined against the windows, and also tables with couches lined against the wall nested towards the kitchen.  \n\nMy parents and I were lucky to be seated against the window since we arrived early.  It would've been a beautiful view since we were right across from Union Square, but the weather was gloomy and there was construction taking place along Stockton Street.  \n\nOn the house items:\n-Chicken Consomme -  The consomme was served in a tiny cup and came with a tiny piece of what seemed to be a biscuit.  The biscuit was tasty, but the consomme was very BLAND and warm.  I was expecting it to be piping hot since it's soup.\n\n-Popovers with strawberry butter - DELICIOUS!  It's airy, light, with a crisp exterior.\n\n-Bittersweet Chocolate Pot de Creme - Loose French dessert custard.  This pot de creme had just the right level of sweetness, but still very rich and creamy.   \n\nItems we ordered:\n-Lobster Club ($30.00)  - If you're counting calories, this sandwich has 470 calories.  My mom thought the club was delicious and not heavy.  The brioche was toasted perfectly and served with applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, lemon a\u00efoli, and yukon gold potato chips.  She really enjoyed it. \n\n-Tuscan Chicken Melt ($18.00) - My sandwich was served on a ciabatta bread with grilled chicken breast, mozzarella, pesto, arugula, tomato, and  grilled peppers with a petite salad, and fruit on the side.  I was amazed that the chicken was moist and chicken breast tends to be dry.  The ingredients all complimented each other.  It was a tasty sandwich.  The sandwich is a half portion, which is perfect for me.  However, if a guy ordered it, he'll leave hungry (unless he eats like a bird).  \n\n-Filet Mignon ($30.00) - My dad ordered this medium rare, but when it came out, it was well done.  We flagged our server and even she said it was well done.  She took the plate back and had the chef remake it.  When my dad received his filet mignon, it was double the size of the first and cooked perfectly.  No complaints here.  \n\nService\nAs an apology for the overcooked Filet Mignon, our server told my dad to choose a dessert on the house.  I thought it was a nice gesture and showed she cares about her customer's dining experience.  Our waitress was friendly and professional.  As for the hostess, she looked less than enthusiastic.  She needs more training in terms of customer service STAT! \n\nEveryone should visit the Rotunda at least once.  YOLO, right?", "author": "Candice H."}

Tables and booths sit under a colored glass dome and are arranged in a circle around the atrium.  Make reservations especially during the weekend. When we got there around noon on a Saturday, they had an hour wait for a table. They do have a bar, so that could be an option if you don't have a reservation and want a quick meal.\n\nMy friend and I had lunch. We were seated promptly as she had a reservation. Our server brought us each a small serving of consomm\u00e9 and an equally small biscuit on the side. It was yummy. A warm popover came next with a side of strawberry butter. My friend ordered a bowl of the clam chowder which she said was good.  For our main course, we both ordered the Steak and Shrimp Salad which is Thai inspired. The salad had greens and shredded papaya and carrots. The dressing was light but could use a little more acid. The steak came on the rarer side of medium rare, but the shrimp was perfectly cooked. We ordered the warm upside down cake for dessert. It was good. Very satisfying meal and service was impeccable. \n\nThis was only my second time dining here.  My husband and I had afternoon tea service last year a couple of days before the New Year.  I had to book that way in advance as afternoon tea on the weekends and during the holiday season is very popular. My husband had champagne with his tea and I had a cocktail. We had savory sandwiches, as well as scones, Madeleines and petit fours.  The tea they serve is fantastic. They import Dammann Fr\u00e8res tea all the way from France.  I loved the Nuit \u00e0 Versailles tea so much, I ordered the tea online from France. None of their American purveyors were selling that specific green tea.  \n\nThe holiday season is a great time to dine here. The place is so festive.

We split the lobster bisque, beet salad, and chicken milanese and it was a ton of food, especially when you could the popovers with strawberry butter. Pro tip: if you finish your popover, they will offer you another one. They did a really nice split plate on the chicken and soup and the presentation was very nice. \n\nPeople seem to give this place lower marks when they get the lobster club (which as of writing was $32). IMO, get a cheaper entree and you'll probably enjoy the experience better.

We made reservations weeks in advance so we were seated right away in a corner booth.  We tried to request window seating when we made our reservation but were told window seating was for parties of four or less.  I personally didn't enjoy the ambiance because I was seated facing the wall.  Besides, we were too far anyway to enjoy the outside view(Fail!).  Or the view of the glass ceiling (Double Fail!).  \n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter took our drink orders and tried to convince us to order a bottle of bubbly to share...no luck there.  Another guy came to hand out some glasses and filled them with water.  I was surprised that he seemed very unfriendly; he did not even bother to smile.  It was such a turn-off; he put a damper on our party!  He needs more training in terms of customer service STAT! Our waiter was nice and professional, but he could have checked on our table at shorter intervals.  One in our party needed her teapot replaced but since we had a difficult time flagging our waiter, we were almost done with our meal when it was replaced. \n\nFOOD:\nThe complimentary popover with strawberry butter was very good.  The popover was huge, warm, and flaky; it paired well with the strawberry butter.  \n\nThe savory sandwiches were ham, cucumber, egg, smoked salmon, crab, and chicken.  They were so tiny my husband could literally eat each in one bite.  I had to remind him to take smaller bites so he could really savor the flavor.  And so that he won't be done eating in under two minutes :) \n\nThe sweet desserts were macaron, pecan tart, something with coconut, and one other pastry.  Everything was just too sweet.  I love sweets, but sadly, I was not impressed with any of the desserts.  The complimentary chocolate mint given with the bill was even more memorable.  \n\nAnd what's afternoon tea without scones?  The piece of scone came with lemon curd, jam, honey, and cream as condiments.  It was good, but I've had better.  \n\nDRINK:  Our party tried 3 different kinds of tea: Jardin Bleu Black, Yellow Lemon Green, and Nuit a Versailles Green.  My favorite was the Jardin Bleu Black; it tasted well with milk even without added sugar.  The green teas were excellent too.  \n\nPRICE: The afternoon tea was $35 per person plus tax.  They also automatically added a gratuity of 20%.  Our total came to $90.13 per couple.  Honestly, I thought the 20% was not well deserved...from the surly staff to the not-so-attentive service.  I don't think the $35 per person was worth it because the desserts were too sweet.  Some in our party did not even bother eating the desserts anymore.  At least we all agreed that the tea selection was excellent.  \n\nBOTTOMLINE:  I thought it was overrated.  The savory sandwiches were good but the desserts were too sweet.  The teas were excellent but it still can't justify the $35 per person especially since service and overall experience was not even good enough for the Neiman Marcus brand.", "author": "Janice T."}

Luckily we went during the holidays, and I got to see the beautiful Christmas tree there. If the Union Square Christmas tree isn't enough, you should check out Neiman Marcus's tree, its lovely also!\n\nThe Rotunda is on the uppermost floor. Its connected to the women's department I believe, so we had to ask a worker where it was. Upon coming in, we saw the really pretty dome ceiling that looked like a mosaic. The area itself circulates, so tables are lined along the windows, while some tables and couches (yup, some are couches) are nested in the dark. \n\nThis place gets busy fast, but luckily we got to be seated near the windows. The seats are black cushion, so I felt pretty content throughout the whole ordeal. I was somewhat intimidated, because hell I looked like a kid fresh out of high school (but I'm not heh). We had a nice elderly woman serving us, and she was really helpful. She started us off with some chicken consomme soup served in a tiny mug. It was pretty... Bland, to be honest, but definitely easy to down.\n\nTHE. DAMN. POPOVERS. Mmmmm, airy, light, and crisp bread served with strawberry butter? YES!\n\nI was hoping to do tea, but due to the circumstances that we had just eaten prior to this place (I had a whole breakfast platter, I tried my hardest to make way in my belly) we decided on ordering one appetizer. We ordered their shrimp egg rolls (these were some pricey motherfcuks, $8 for 4 rolls). When they came out, they were piping hot as heck! Paired off with the sweet chili sauce, the exterior was nice and crunchy, and the interior filled with shrimp and greens. As much as I would've liked to love it, I only liked it. This is something I could get elsewhere for cheaper monies.\n\nOverall, this place is something a tourist should come to. Paying for food here is almost like paying for your soul, but if it's high-end food, then hell, you only live once right? But do try their popovers, I cannot stress that enough.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

It's located inside the Neiman Marcus by Union Square and the interior is just beautiful. It has a great view of Union Square Park as well which is really nice. We both did the regular Rotuna Tea package, which comes with: five tea sandwiches, five petite sweets, warm scone, pot of Dammann Fr\u00e8res loose leaf tea, traditional tea accompaniments.\n\nOur server was great. Very friendly and quite helpful. Not only did he suggest a great tea for me (though sadly I no longer remember what it was), but he made sure that all of my items were nut-free after I told him about my allergies.\n\nWe were started off with their chicken consomm\u00e9 which was delightful. I wanted more! Then they gave us a fresh popover with strawberry butter. Delicious!\n\nThe five tea sandwiches are: deviled egg, classic chicken, smoked salmon, lobster roll, and cucumber. The classic chicken actually comes with a sliced almond garnish, but of course our server made sure that mine did not have that. Since I don't eat salmon Joyce eagerly consumed mine, but to make up for it she let me have both cucumber ones. I think my favourite was probably the deviled egg though. None of the sandwiches were really special, apart from the lobster I could have made all of them at home, but they were quite cute and, really, we're here for the experience more than the food, right?\n\nOur five desserts were: chocolate chip cookies, petite fours, chocolate brownies, carrot cake, and madeleines. We were supposed to get two petite fours--lemon and pistachio--but he took out the pistachio one and replaced it with an additional chocolate chip cookie. While the gesture is always appreciated, I don't understand why we couldn't have just gotten a second lemon petite four. But it was fine, I love chocolate chip cookies :P Although our server didn't realise (until I brought it up) that the carrot cake has walnuts so I could not have it. He offered to give me another dessert but I told him it was fine (we had enough food). The scone they gave us was raisin. I love scones :) They gave us several preserves along with cream (and a lemon). I finished off the strawberry butter (from the popover) with the scone and then ate the rest of the scone with the cream.\n\nWhile the food here is nothing to write home about, it's still pretty good and I did really like my tea.

Eating at the Rotunda in the evening is definitely different than at lunch because you can see all the lights on Union Square.  The glass ceiling also gave the impression of eating underneath a carousel.  The location is absolutely lovely and if you have a smaller party (max 150), this place will totally work.\n\nI had the staff set up a guest of honor table and since the venue is circular, it allowed a 360 degree view of the table.  \n\nI had the filet of beef and it was absolutely the softest yummiest beef I ever had.  Definitely better than the Sizzler (ha!).  It felt like cutting into butter when I sliced into the beef.\n\nI've heard positive comments about the other entree selections from the guests as well.\n\nThere were probably 3-4 servers but they took care of us and there wasn't a lag time in getting the food to the table.\n\nThey even set up a coat check room with staff manning the room at no addtitional cost.  At first I asked for coat racks but I didn't expect someone to actually man the room because hotels and other venues charge for this service.\n\nMichelle & Andrew were the best.  They tried to work within our budget.\n\nI would definitely consider planing another party here again.  The Rotunda absolutely follows Neiman Marcus' celebrated service!", "author": "Wendy H."}

The popover and chicken broth shot naturally classic Neiman Marcus style and flare, delicious and a great compliment to any meal or experience at their restaurants. The afternoon tea fare itself could have used a bit of oomph. The macaroons were overly squishy and didn't have the traditional consistency. The savories left a bit to be desired, especially the prosciutto roll, which just looked sloppy on the plate. The best part was the scone as it was incredibly light, crispy without being overly dry, crumbly without tasting as if I was eating pure flour. For a tea experience, I do expect a degree of cleanliness and professional presentation. A few pieces of cutlery were already soiled upon seating. Table cloth dirty with a large brown ring. And the tea pots were old, unstylish, clumsy, and were impossible to pour or transport without totally spilling all over the tablecloth. It was even mentioned that they ran out of the classic teapots that had proper spouts so we were given whatever was on hand at the time, the \"old\" pots, so to speak.

And you have a very commanding view of the city while you dine. \n\nI was wearing black, and my waitress took note of it immediately when she came by and offered to get me a black napkin as a oppose to having me use the white ones that have been placed on the table. This made me happy. :) \n\nI had the Grand Tea (you get your choice of tea with a glass of champagne or without) I opted for the champagne to start my meal. \n\nThey start you with a chicken consomm\u00e9, and a to die for popover which is huge! I forgot to take a photo of the popover but you can see it from the other reviewers here. It was soooooo buttery!  \n\nThe raisin scones were amazing! And they give you a selection of honey, lemon curd, cream, and berry jam to eat with your scones, their tea selection is acceptable - I had one of their orange-green tea which was excellent! Their finger sandwiches were fresh, you get smoked salmon (which I forgot to ask them not to give me as I don't like smoked salmon) , chicken over phyllo , egg on biscuit, and cucumber sandwich with cream cheese. Every sandwich was pumped with alot of zest, texture and flavor. \n\nThey give you a bunch of petit fours to finish off the afternoon.

But personally I didn't really see that when I came, I saw a huge variety of ages and people, and yes there may have been some of those people but some people were also super casual.\n\nI like how the booths were very private.

That's exactly what Mum and I had planned on a Saturday.  The ambiance is classy and on par with the shopping experience at Neiman Marcus.  You would expect to have a premiere dining experience here.      \n\nI had reservations for afternoon tea promptly at 2:30pm.  Upon checking in, I got an off-putting vibe from the 2 gentlemen who were the hosts/manager.  They had this pretentious attitude that should have been left at home.  When another host took us to a table, he wanted to seat us in the back booth area.  There were at least 4 open tables by the window and I asked if we could sit there instead.  He seemed a little hesitant and went back to check with the \"boss.\"  He then came back and led us to one of the tables by the window, albeit one of the tables that was next to the huge pillar.  At least we were able to have a view of Union Square though.  Sorry I had to dock one star for the snooty guys at the door.  \n\nSoon after we were seated, we were served consume as well as their famous popovers.  Honestly, we both thought the consume was way salty but I'll take a hot popover with strawberry butter any day!  Mum and I both went with the Signature Tea which was $35 pp.  We ordered the two different green tea choices: Yellow Lemon Tea (lemongrass based) and Nuit \u00c0 Versailles Tea (fruit and floral based).  Loved both of our tea choices but only wish that they would refill the tea leaves and not just the hot water.  The teas get watered down after the first pot.  The tiered platter of tea snacks looked delicious and nicely presented.  I thought the variety of finger sandwiches were just so-so.  The savory items such as the onion quiche, salmon/caviar pastry and  prosciutto wrapped pear with cheese were the best.  Also, we liked some sweets more than the others - mini fruit tarts and dark chocolate muffins were nice but a few items were less exciting.  Scones were light and fluffy but we had to take home since we were too full to finish them there.  More than enough food portion-wise.    \n\nAn older gentleman who was our server was exceptional and I would give him 5 stars alone.  After I asked to have the scones packed up to go, I mentioned that I really enjoyed the popovers.  The waiter then got a popover fresh out of the oven with a container of strawberry butter and gave it to me to take home.  He was awesome!\n\nAmbiance is nice with the disclaimer that you are sitting by the window.  If you are seated in the booths or closer to the bar, there's not much to see and the tables are cramped.  Overall, we had a good experience and I'm happy to have spent some quality time with my Mum over afternoon tea.  Total tab was $92.

For some reason, none of the snacks were that appealing to me. \n\nSavory: As a vegetarian, they had a cream cheese and cucumber sandwich, which I understand is somewhat of a staple in teas, but it was extremely uninspired. No flavors, no twists, no excitement. I was a big fan of the deviled egg sandwich, which was delicious and rich. But other than that, no other vegetarian sandwiches. Big bummer. I think they could have done something as simple as brought out different butters, or spreads, which is extremely simple, to make our savory treats a little more diverse. \n\nSweets: Again, was not blown away by the sweets. The scone was not soft or warm which was upsetting because it just tasted really dry unless I drank tea right after it. The cakes were average. \n\nThe redeeming quality was the white tea I ordered and the big, warm, fluffy croissant type treat we got to start with. Maybe we didn't have a great experience because we came at 4pm and it's near the end of their tea service? Either way, will not be returning / recommending.

THE best thing here. Okay, AND the pretty atmosphere during Christmas with the huge signature tree in the store. \n- Snag a table next to the windows during Christmas time and you'll get a spectacular view of Union Square. \n- Party of two for afternoon tea: Dammann Fr\u00e8res loose leaf teas paired with two tiers of housemade sweets, petite cookies, tarts, finger sandwiches and scones with preserves and cream.\n- Jardin Bleu Tea: Perfect fruity black tea to pair with afternoon tea goodies. Smelled delicious and tasted great. \n- Nuit \u00c0 Versailles Tea: A lighter green tea with a hint of fruit flavor. This was another good alternative if you are not into too fruity or strong tea. \n\nImprovements\n- Putting my name down on the waitlist meant not receiving a text that a table is ready until at least 1hr+ and the hostess put my name down for regular lunch, which meant I had to wait again for another table when the tea service started at 2:30PM. By then I already found a table near the bar. Not as great of a view as next to the windows, but I didn't want to wait any longer. \n- Sandwiches could have been better, skip out on the goat cheese/tomato sandwich. \n- Desserts were a-okay at most. \n- I had to remind the waiter to bring out the preserves and cream with our afternoon tea as well as cream/sugar. \n- The elevator that brought us up to the restaurant level from the Geary Street entrance looked really dated inside and smelled old and musty. \n\nTips\n- Make a reservation, I can't even stress this enough especially during the holidays. Months in advance would be recommended. \n- If you decide to try to do a walk-in to be on the waitlist, go early, check-in, and give them your cell phone number to text you when a table opens up. You'll have to be back within 15 mins or your table will be given away. \n- Another option if the waitlist is full is to scope out a table at the bar as that is first come, first serve. They also serve afternoon tea in this area beginning at 2:30PM. \n- Enter on the Geary Street level to skip out on going through all the escalators within the store. You can bypass everything and come up directly to the side of the restaurant and walk through some tables to the hostess stand.", "author": "Tracy T."}

Here's why:\n1.  Service was well below the usual standard.  Friendly at first, then inattentive, and then transitioned mid-meal with both waiters standing on either side of the table waiting for us to stop a very intense conversation so they could tell us they were transitioning.  Awkward.  We also got the ole' 'not filling your water glass b/c we want you to leave' trick.  I get the need to turn tables, but for a $200 meal (for 2), I'd like to linger and chat a bit.  mmk?\n2.  Lobster Club.  I get this literally every time, which means I've had this nugget at least 20 times.  Where the club is usually comprised of whole lobster claws and pieces, and exquisitely structured, this time it was more like lobster salad.  Not a single whole piece of lobster to be found.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty...but for $30 a pop, some chunks are expected!  \n3.  Facilities.  My gawd people.  You are Neiman Marcus!  But your restrooms are worse than my local JC Penny!

Then came their delicious popovers with strawberry butter. \n\nEgg salad: very \"eggy\" but I'm wondering if they added food coloring since the salad was a bright, almost neon yellow\nChicken salad: toasted almonds added a nice crunch\nCucumber and watercress: crisp and refreshing\nTurkey: didn't care for this as turkey tasted off\nSmoked salmon: yummy \nLobster salad: didn't care for this, lobster tasted too fishy\nCurrant scone: slathered on the delicious lemon curd\nassorted sweets: my favorite was the chocolate tart\ntea: vanilla decaf tea, nuit a Versailles green tea, anji white tea\n\nWhile the food was just OK, you are really paying for the ambiance. A special treat during the holidays. When making reservations, ask for a window view. You can people-watch as shoppers bustle below you and ice skaters glide by in Union Square. Make sure to look up to admire the lead glass dome that recalls the elegance of post-1906 earthquake San Francisco. Then look below you at the 60' Christmas tree rising four stories high to almost brush that gorgeous dome.\n\nWhile admiring the dome, we thought the 2 grimacing faces framing the glass ceiling reminded us of Keith Richards as Capt. Teague and Johnny Depp as his son, Capt. Jack Sparrow. Lol.", "author": "Cece E."}

If you have trouble finding this place, the restaurant is located on the 3rd floor (not the 4th. we made that mistake!). The Amuse Boushe was chicken consomme with a small biscuit on the side which was great. The popovers with their strawberry butter was amazing as well. We had to refrain from eating too many!\n\nGrilled Shimp Salad: It was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of dressing. I usually not a huge fan of goat cheese but the flavor was not overwhelming. I actually really liked this dish.\n\nCrab & Shrimp Louie: Dungeness crab and shrimp in a salad, doesn't that sound amazing? The flavor of the salad was pretty simple and light. Overall, it was good but not amazing. It seems to be a pretty popular dish considering a lot of the tables around us ordered this as well. \n\nDaily Special Salmon: The flavor of the salmon and the sauce was pretty good but the salmon itself was a bit undercooked in the middle. My boyfriend requested that they cook it a little more and the waiter was kind enough to suggest they bring a new dish. However, when we received the dish, the kitchen sent us the same dish as before but the salmon this time was a bit overcooked. I thought the kitchen could have done a better job by being courteous and sending over a new perfectly cooked salmon as the waiter had initially suggested. When they presented us the salmon dish, they said that it was a new dish but it was clearly the same piece that we had sent back earlier, missing vegetables and all. \n\nDammann Fr\u00e8res tea: I have previously bought their loose tea leaves from Neimans but was unimpressed. I was hoping it would be a little better served so we tried their Earl Grey. It was okay but nothing amazing.

However, after waiting for 10 minutes I got a seat at the bar counter next to a woman taking her work conference calls while drinking martinis and a couple at the end of the counter who seemed to kiss and hug every other couple they knew walking by wearing Prada or Gucci.  The bartender let me know a bunch of bar backs called out sick and they were doing everything.  It'd be impossible to get tea time without reservations.  I enjoyed a very nice shrimp and crab louis salad with a popover.  I love the strawberry butter they serve with the popover too.  However, after spending $40 for lunch I probably won't be back soon.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

Although i've dined for lunch once prior, it's an even better restaurant for tea, bite sized sandwiches, and tasty little cookies. I've been Crown & Crumpets all pink princess party and have seen Secret Garden's doilie covered tables. The Rotunda is classy and fit for a girls shopping trip afternoon treat. The room was created to let lots of light in while being able to avoid the sun. Perfect spot in the middle of downtown San Francisco!\n\nMy table ordered the Signature Tea set for $35 per person. You can add a glass of champagne for an additional cost. I suggest the Nuit A Versailles Tea. It's fragrant and light without resembling potpourri (a pet peeve of mine when it comes to tea). \n\nPopovers don't normally come with High Tea. We graciously thanked our attending waiter for this extra treat! I slather their strawberry butter very unladylike all over the popovers. The tiered treats arrived and amazed us all at once. It's the prettiest group of assembled scones, cookies, open sandwiches, and housemade sweets. Each bite was delicate and perfectly sized to just pop in your mouth. The lobster and egg salad savory tarts are so good. I really enjoyed their scones and preserves too. \n\nThe Rotunda provided impeccable service, delicious food, tea refills, and a gorgeous interior.\n\nAfternoon tea is available Sunday - Thursdays from 2:30-4pm and Friday-Saturday 2:30-5pm", "author": "Samantha L."}

Center of the restaurant is completely open, and the natural light shines in which makes everything beautiful. \n\nI came here for afternoon tea around 4pm (they closed at 5pm that day, but I had a reservation). I saw people still coming in around 4:50pm and the staff was still very friendly. \n\nI ordered the Rotunda Signature Tea, and my boyfriend got the Grand Tea. The Grand Tea comes with a glass of Domaine Chandon champagne, and the Signature tea is just tea. \n\nI ordered the Nuit A Versailles tea, and it was good. I added some honey and lemon to sweeten it a bit. One teapot is about three cups of tea. You can always ask for more water. If you order a green tea, I would suggest taking the leaves out after about 5 mins from receiving your tea, because it will get bitter towards the end. You can always ask for more hot water and use the leaves again. \n\nThe assortment of sandwiches and pastries was good. I loved the display of them, and how petite everything was! Everything from afternoon tea was just adorable. My favorites were the savory sandwiches and treats. The sweets were just OK to me. I did enjoy the raspberry cheesecake, but not so much the other items. \n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun! Definitely a must if you're in Union Square. I would say allow about 2 hours to enjoy afternoon tea, and it's not a bad idea to make a reservation.\n\nNote: this is not a replacement for dinner or lunch. There isn't THAT much food. Definitely just a snacking event.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

Easily one of the worst tasting salads I've ever had, and at $26 dollars it rockets up the naughty list. The salmon is served in wildly unappealing chunks. But not like flakey chunks. Like  jar-of-catfood, shredded, minced, mushy globs. I wish I'd taken a picture to share with you guys, but I was at a business lunch so needed to at least feign composure. The salad also includes once pan-fried potatoes that were stone cold. Think day-old home fries, straight from the refrigerator, with leathery skins and cold mealy centers. Yum. After the rest of my party left I hung back to deliver this review in person to a manager, but none could be bothered to come out from hiding in their little closet behind the host-stand.  This place seems to be popular with foreign tourists in town for luxe shopping trips.

Our lunch reservations was at 12:15 and I guess Neimen Marcus doesnt open until noon, but there is a elevator on the side that can take you up to the restaurant directly since it opens at 11.  We get up there and it is very nice.  Unfortunately, there was no window seat available so we got a booth.  The only problem with the booth was another party sitting across from you in the same booth, which was alittle awkward / uncomfortable because you are kinda starring at them eye to eye.  After awhile, it was fine.  I just tried not looking their way.\n\nIt is alittle pricey here, but you are paying for the ambiane, which I don't mind.  I do love their bread and strawberry butter that they brought to us, but wish the butter was alittle softer or the bread alittle warmer,  just so the butter can melt in alittle to the bread.  My friends ordered the lobster bisque which she said very very good.  She also ordered the filet mignon medium rare, but when she got it, it looked more like medium to well.  We called the waiter over and he started to argue that it was medium rare (i see no redness whatsoever, it was all pink to cooked all the way thru).  So, he took it back and brought back another one which was more red, but my friend was not happy with it either.  I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Louie salad and I did really enjoy it.  It was fresh and there was just right amount of dressing. \n\nI was not too happy with the service.  Dont't argue with the patrons plus you never asked us if we wanted more bread vs offering it to other tables around us.  \n\nThe service needs help if you want it to stay classy.  I think we both ordered the most expensive dishes there and this is the service we get, ugh!", "author": "James L."}

Made a reservation the day before I came for the window seat and the view is superb. I like the popover with the homemade strawberry butter they gave us as soon as we found our table and the complimentary chicken soup tasting. Ordered a regular chiken milannese and salmon and the salmon is very crunchy outside but soft in the inside. The portions are just enough for three of us because it is filling. Finally we ordered the signature high tea for dessert and it is enough for us. It came with champagne and tea of our choice, which today I feel like chammomile.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-21", "description": "Even before I talk about the food, I just want to mention that the location is perfect for enjoying lunch or high tea after shopping in Union Square.  Secondly, the restaurant is beautiful.  A glass ceiling and a breath-taking view from the fourth floor of Neiman Marcus -- the view alone definitely secures this restaurant a spot on my list of \"must go eat\" locations of San Francisco.\n\nI highly suggest planning ahead and making reservations.  My friend and I had a late lunch at 2pm and thought that we would have avoided the lunch crowd. Wow.  We were wrong.  This place is poppin'!  After lunch, people are there for high tea -- so at 2pm, the wait for walk-ins were at about 40 minutes to an hour.  Also, perhaps it was because we called ahead, but we scored seats right next to the windows and was able to enjoy the view.\n\nSo I admit, this place feels fancy -- almost borderline pretentious.  Do I drink my water with my pinky up?  Shall I speak in a British accent?  Does the bread go on my left or right?  Sure, I over-think these things, but all of those wandering thoughts were gone as soon as the waiter brought out their complementary chicken consomme and popover served with strawberry cream cheese.  What do they put in this food? Upon first bite, I'm impressed and addicted to their food quality and knew that the universe brought me here.\n\nI wish that I had a bigger appetite that day but I was still trying to recover from the food-ventures of that week.  My heart was saying \"order everything\" but in a battle of wills, my logic won out and I just ordered the Lobster Club ($28).  Now that I think about it, it's probably better that I wasn't too hungry or else I would have had to pull out a loan.  Twenty-eight dollars for a sandwich sounds crazy, I know, but after reading the description -- applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, lemon aioli on a toasted brioche, served with yukon gold potato chips -- how could I pass?  The club was fantastic.  The chips were fantastic.  Generous pieces of lobster were in every bite and the flavors were wonderful.  What more can a girl ask for?!\n\nThey say first impressions are important and The Rotunda left a great one.  From food, to service, to the beautiful atmosphere, I am definitely a fan.  Until I try more of their menu items, I'm going to hold out on that fifth star -- but for now, I'll dream of their popover and strawberry cream cheese.", "author": "Miyeon L."}

I loved the balcony under the stained glass where you look down into Neiman Marcus.  So beautiful!!\n\nThe great:\n\nThe food was AMAZING - all of it!! We shared:\n - Lobster Bisque\n - Lobster Egg Rolls\n - Lobster crab and shrimp salad\n - Lobster Club sandwich\n - Peanut Butter and Jelly Mousse\n - Banana Bread Pudding\n\nWe were in a lobster kind of a mood.. lol! It sounds like a lot but we halved everything.  Next time around, I think I will order the Lobster Bisque, Lobster crab and shrimp salad, and Peanut Butter and Jelly Mousse for dessert. That would be perfect. \n\nOur waitress was also amazing. We could tell that she deals with a lot of snobby people because she seemed a little surprised when we said please and thank you, and were very appreciative of her service. She was very attentive and always on point. She even took the initiative to split the items we ordered which showed us that she actually listened to us say that we wanted to split everything, in the very beginning.  \n\nI also would like to point out that the busboy in our area was also great. He was very attentive with keeping our water glasses filled and our table clean and clear - but not in an intrusive way.\n\nThe not so good: \n\nI would have LOVED to sit near the windows, but the hostess told us that the three (yes - 3) open tables in front of the windows were spoken for.... They didn't fill up until we were almost ready to go, which was really irritating - we could have sat there! That's why I only gave 4 stars.. Plus, our hostess was really rude and had such an attitude. Not a good look.\n\nThe restaurant itself could use a little updating. They have a bit of an 80's thing going on that could use a little refreshing. For example - the dark wall paper, the booths could be refreshed, the leather bar chairs at the bar scream 80's,  and the butterfly decor on the book shelves - some attractive glass sculptures would look really nice there instead.. These aesthetics are not a make or break, but still, just saying...\n\nOverall:\n\nI had a great time and enjoyed every single bite of everything we ordered. Loved our server and busboy. Also enjoyed the beautiful restaurant itself (even though it's still in the 80's). ;o) I highly recommend the restaurant! A definite must!\n\nCiao!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

It's definitely a fancier and more expensive lunch spot but it's worth it.  Starting off with the delicious popovers with strawberry butter is not a bad way to start your meal.  We had the deviled eggs which are always good and these did not disappoint.  My wife had the duck confit salad as her main meal and the duck was phenomenal.  I got the lobster and it was so good.  We also ordered dessert which was the part I'd probably pass on next time.  The brownie was good but a little too strong for my liking.  The service was excellent throughout our meal.\n\nIf you're looking to splurge on a lunch in San Francisco, I highly recommend The Rotunda.", "author": "Blake B."}

By the advice of other Yelpers, I called morning-of to specify that my online reservation was for tea, and had no issues (though I find it strange that seems to be necessary). \n\nThe atmosphere is a tad formal, but come on, you're in a department store restaurant, so I'm not too bothered if they look at me funny for wearing flats and a casual jacket. \n\nAt $35/person it's a little pricey, but I expected that for Union Square with a beautiful view (either of the Square outside or the stained-glass ceiling), and formal dining service. You can add sparkling wine to your meal for $10ish. \n\nI found it odd that for all the formalities (including the palate-cleansing warm broth beforehand), they served some food best eaten by hand-- the popovers, while tasty, were difficult to gracefully manage by fork and knife. The strawberry butter was delicious, but arrived rock hard and brittle-- give it a few minutes next to your steeping teapot to get to room temperature, which makes it spreadable. The sandwiches, scones and desserts were all lovely, though they subbed whipped cream for clotted cream... Not the same, guys.", "author": "Krista L."}

You're paying more for the venue and view than the actual food which I guess makes sense but I rather go elsewhere for tea service, it is not worth it!\n\nThe amount we paid as a party of 14 was about $70-80 per person and all I got was one little scone to share and one tea of choice. I can go to Starbucks and get that under $10. The popovers are good but it will not curb your hunger. I was literally starving after our tea service. \n\nLadies/Gents, I would skip the Rotunda.

We probably spent about the first 10 minutes taking pictures, instagramming, and snapchatting the place because it's just that pretty! We had a great view of Union Square from our seat, and... I just felt so fancy. We both read about the afternoon tea on Yelp, but found out you can only get it after 2:30pm (plan accordingly)! Instead we got the Lobster Club and Warm Seafood Salad. The Lobster Club was pretty good (4 slices of the sandwich), but I wouldn't order the seafood salad again. Other than the interesting mix of salad and seafood, nothing was awesome about it (I'm not a fan of mixed greens (I like romaine lettuce best) and there wasn't much seafood in it). We ended up not finishing the seafood salad and didn't want to take it to go either... As everyone else also mentioned, I really liked the complimentary chicken consomme & small pastry, popover, and strawberry butter.\nService was great, but some time during our lunch, someone came by to clean up the table next to ours... and when the worker... replaced?

Upon arrival we were seated right away since my friend had made reservations. We ended up not choosing the afternoon tea because she heard that the food was pretty good and it did look/smell good. So we ended up just ordering from the menu. After we ordered, they gave complimentary soup and a little tiny cheese appetizer, which was interesting since I've never had such a thing. Then they brought us the popover with strawberry butter was to die for! So... We went with the tuna poke as an appetizer(which was amazing and I'm usually not a big fan of tuna). Then, our main course came.  I ordered an herb crusted salmon over a bead of vegetables, beans, steamed kale, etc. everything was on point, especially with the seasoning. My friend got the chicken melt club? She was not too impressed with it and said she wish she got something else. I always, always, always have to have some type of dessert after my meals. So, I instantly chose to order the earl grey tart since I love earl grey. It came candle lit since they knew it was my birthday. It was a pretty nice proportioned piece of tart with torched peaches on the side. I'm not a fan of peaches torched, so my friend ate it. And I focused on the tart which I believe was the most delicate tasting dessert. I finished it instantly. So good.

They were complimentary which was even better!\n\nHere comes the unfortunate part.. considering a place like this and it's hefty price tag, you would think the food they serve is fresh right?? Think again. These \"crumpets\" have been sitting in the fridge already made hours ago. How can I tell? The food was sweating through the paper, the bread on the sandwiches weren't fluffy..

Since entering the restaurant (located on the 4th floor on the far left), I felt we were entering a stuffy environment. The hostess and host were not warm not even friendly when checking us in. It was a Monday and it was after the lunch rush... Not sure what was their deal. Since it was my mom's birthday, I asked if they can anything for birthdays. I received an abrupt \"No but we will tell your server to say happy birthday\". Awww at least that's something... Never happened though.\n\nComing from a place of \"yes\", I did not want to taint the moment in my head with the attitude received. We were seated and although the server was at least lukewarm, he was still curt. The service was also not exceptional. We were with empty tea pots, empty water glasses, and requests for food items gone unfulfilled. \n\nThe food is mediocre. Tea sandwiches are as expected. Strawberry butter is very good, which is served complimentary with the popover. I'm not sure it is worth the experience and bill though.

The first time my friend and I got lucky and got the last first-come, first serve sofa seating rather than waiting 90 minutes for a table during the lunch rush. The second time, I came with a party of 3 and the wait time was 60 minutes. Since we were tight on time, we decided to head over to Cheese Cake Factory, as we were headed up the elevator, they texted me saying the table is ready. This was the only time I was presented with the mint chocolate square at the end of my meal. Overall, seating is a bit funky, that or I've been lucky this week. \n\nThe first time I came I had the Tuscan Chicken Melt (16) which came with petite cup of fruit and salad. At first glance I thought it looked a bit funky because the cheese appeared as a big blob of semi-melted on top of slices of chicken breast. Everything is cooked to perfection in the sandwich. No qualms there. However, the sandwich itself is small. It's literally like 4 inches long. A bit if a disappointment for the price you pay especially for a person who can eat about three of these and still not be full. \n\nThe Grilled Chicken Piccata Sandwich (18) was equally as good and equally small. \n\nThe popover was a bit too flanky for my liking since everything seemed to flake all over the table and into my lap To me it tasted like nothing. It did not have any particular taste. The strawberry butter is a nice touch. I can see myself gaining a lot of weight eating this combo, particularly the butter, often. \n\nThe complementary tea and mini puff thing was interesting. The first time I didn't like drinking the chicken broth from the miniature tea cup because it was so salty. The second time I think I acquired a quick tolerance for it. \n\nThe atmosphere can get a bit loud especially if you're sitting towards the front where people are waiting to be seated. Further back, it quiets down unless you have a noisy party next to you. The seating is arranged in a large circle with the natural light shining through. \n\nThe waitstaff is generally pretty nice. \n\nI'd come back, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Everything was well balanced in texture and flavor. You get a sweet tenderness from the lobster and creaminess from aioli and avocado which is offset by the pepperiness of the arugula. The bacon was the icing on the cake adding a crisp rich porky richness to the lobster club. The lobster club was very good but not as spectacular as I thought it would be.\n\nTaro is my favorite root veggie and though the chips were perfectly crisp, they were on the oily side. \n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waitress was friendly but lacked attentiveness; she was MIA most of the time.

Mission accomplished! \n\nI'd never been to the Rotunda (have been to other Neiman cafes however) so I had wanted a window table since it was Valentine's Day and our first time there. Unfortunately, that was not to happen. I booked the reservation a month in advance for 2:45 with the special request to sit by the window. Frankly, I would have even waited until a table opened but they didn't give us that option. That was more then frustrating considering other restaurants I'd been to recently and requested a window seat at least let me wait until it opened. The table we were at was on the raised platform and was very nice but it wasnt even in the booths down below so it felt like our desire to try to sit somewhere nice on our first visit wasn't even considered. For a holiday, it didn't seem extremely busy either; there was maybe only one other party waiting to be seated.\n\nThe other thing was, they didn't know we were there for tea, even though I deleted and redid my open table reservation just to add that it was for tea in the comments section when I made it. This was rectified quickly however. Our server was very sweet and attentive. The tea was delicious and we loved all the tea sandwiches, desserts, and scones. Definitely the best tea service I've had in awhile because the selection of food, the display, atmosphere, and the addition of champagne that you can add on for a price make it modern enough to take a date.

We could barely finish it all.\n\nAt the end of our meal, we had delicious drinks with sorbet in them and a strawberry to decorate them. They were absolutely stunning to the eyes and perfect for the palate. Then we had a delicious grand finale of desserts. The plating was lovely with a peach dessert and a chocolate lava cake. I could not have had a better ending for such a fantastic meal. We had great service and great food. We thank you for everything! =)", "author": "Anji W."}

Came here for my graduation lunch a few days ago for the first time and was in awe by it. It's a beautiful restaurant that makes you feel like you're not in a restaurant!\n\nI ordered my $32 lobster club sandwich and it was bomb dot com. It's definitely real crab so I see why the price range is a bit high and the chips that comes along with is super thin and crispy and fresh so you can tell it's house made. Their popovers with strawberry butter is awesome!! I mean, strawberry butter?! Major plus that it's bottomless. And right when you're seated they serve you what appears to be tea in a tiny cup but is actually a broth of some sort along with a tiny biscuit. It's to cleanse your taste palette and it is good too.\n\nOverall, good food, good service! I would come here dressed up a bit more tidy than usual but not overly fancy since it is more of an upscale restaurant", "author": "Amy P."}

Made reservations a week before through the yelp table app thing. \n(finally getting around to reviewing this place)\n\n\nDRESS\nMy mom and i dressed up for this lunch. People dressed up kinda like you would for Cheesecake factory. You should dress up-not like cocktail dress up, but like a nice blouse, jewelry and heels or something idk \n\n\nATMOSPHERE\nBeautiful! We luckily got the window seats! It was a bit cramped but i felt that it was cozy. I don't think i would have liked the experience as much if i didn't get the seats we got. Atmosphere was lovely! The Rotunda definitely has the whole elegant feel..especially with the ceiling. Its not a cafe where younger people can chill at but it's more like a place where older people could meet and catch up with or discuss business matters at. \n \n*I would want to come here again during Christmas time because you could see the union square tree, ice skating rink and all the holiday season decorations from inside.\n\n\nFOOD\nWe got the lobster club and also the afternoon tea because i have this issue where i want to eat everything. The waiter laughed when we told them we would get both lunch and tea. sighz\n\nLobster club lived up to the hype! There were large chunks of lobster that tasted fresh. I wish i had sriracha tho\n\nThe afternoon tea was tooo cute! The little pastries, finger sandwiches and desserts tasted.. alright. Nothing special. I think the whole concept of \" cute tea time\" made it worth the $$. Took leftovers in a togo box. I'm not much of a tea drinker so i'm not sure whether the tea was good or not. \n\nPopovers with strawberry butter = deeeelicious!\n The popovers are served warm, flaky and soft. Spread some cool and sweet strawberry butter all up on that popover and BADA BING BADA BOOM. so gud. Its deeelicious\n\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was attentive but not annoying. Overall service was good. \n\n\n$$$\nIt was not your average meal price. It was actually pretty pricey... but definitely worth a visit!

Set beneath a landmark stained-glass dome and overlooking the city, the Rotunda is a feast for the eyes. I was only disappointed that Union Square is under construction or else the scenery would have been perfect. Situated on the second highest floor in Neiman Marcus, this place serves high tea and lunch. I called in for a reservation for 1:30pm unaware that their tea is only served after 2:30pm. Thus, my friend and I were unable to order afternoon tea. Thus, we ordered alcohol instead :)\n\nTuscan Pesto Chicken Melt: The chicken was very tender and not dry at all (which is my biggest fear when it comes to ordering chicken). In addition, there was a light salad that accompanied the melt. Overall, it was tasty and flavorful, just a tad pricey ( 20 bucks for a sandwich...).\n\nRickey Rose: Much stronger than I thought. I knew they wold put gin in it but it was way too strong. You can ask them to dilute it if you are a weakling like me.\n\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Paillard Milanese. It was alright. Just what I expected. Just chicken. In addition she got a Bloody Mary.\n\nVERDICT: I must say, I was mostly in awe of the actual location. It was beautiful. In addition, service was awesome. They gave us these popovers that are so flaky, warm and tasty. Everything else was too expensive. Perhaps, come here once or twice to indulge.

As several others have said before me, making a reservation is A MUST. You can make a reservation either online or over the phone. \n\nThere is a separate entrance located on Geary St. side of Neiman Marcus and an exclusive elevator that takes you directly up to the restaurant. It's very easy to miss it, I was actually surprised there was no security guard or some other personnel posted. Once you exit the elevator, the check-in/host station is a little ways to your left. The placement of the elevator is a little off-putting and awkward personally because it spits you directly into amidst the tables and dining patrons and not, say, right outside the entrance to the restaurant. If you decide to not take the direct elevator, The Rotunda is on the Fourth Level.\n\nWe made a reservation to have tea around 3pm on a Sunday and it was great timing. It was nice to see that we weren't the only \"youngins\" having tea there. Why is Afternoon Tea not more a thing?!\n\n$45 per person is the cheapest to have tea here and I'm sad to say that what you're really paying for, is the brand name, posh setting, and the atmosphere. The service was very good but I expected no less. The tea was also good but I would have liked to see a wider range and selection offered. The food was ~not~ horrible but for the price we paid, I expected way better quality and quantity. My party of two adults were only offered TWO tiered trays of scones, cookies, cakes, fruit, and finger sandwiches...that's ridiculous. The Crown & Crumpet popup venue in Japantown gave me better and more food for significantly less money. \n\nThe least they can do for Afternoon Tea here is to offer more than one kind of scone, since scones are an important part of British tea times ...and I know this city is definitely NOT lacking in number of phenomenal bakeries that can deliver suitable goodies for tea. The finger sandwiches were actually bigger than I expected (lol) and I especially liked the prosciutto roll with apple and goat cheese filling. I didn't care for the pistachio? meringue cookies and the sprig of grapes at all.\n\nBTW Rotunda, cupcakes. DO. NOT. BELONG. IN. AFTERNOON. TEA.

The high tea sweet and savory items were displayed nicely on our table's tea tray, however the food items themselves were uninspired and more than a few pieces were tasteless. The scones and muffins were pretty tasty, but the savory scones and sandwiches were very bland and far from refined. Our table had two very pleasant and helpful waiters but one of the restaurant's food-runners was very rude and seemed overall miserable. This initial interaction with this staff member made us feel unwelcome from the get-go. For $55/person, our table ordered the high tea with a (very good) glass of champagne. However, instead of a reasonable amount of food for four, the Rotunda only offers 1 high tea order split four ways (i.e. 3 tea sandwiches, 1 chocolate covered strawberry, 1 scone/person, all bite-sized).

It was OK but not up to the hype. It was a little dry. When our tier of sandwiches and dessert came it was nicely presented. The lobster was my favorite sandwich. The dessert was a little too sweet and heavy to me. I think the proportion of food to dessert was kind of high and should be a little more balanced. I feel like I gained an extra lb off of the dessert. \n\nThe second time I really loved the lobster sandwich and lobster bisque, soooo yummy. Get it if you ever get the chance.

Some of the clientele go a little overboard with the dressing up and pretentious snobbery, but that's just more entertainment for your buck. E.g. Play a drinking game for every time a twenty-something wobbles by in heels too high for her frame with a designer handbag dangling from the crook of her elbow. By the end of your meal, you'll either be wasted or broke (or both). \n\nI came here twice within one month, once for afternoon tea, the other time for lunch.\n\nAFTERNOON TEA\nMy friend and I got the standard Rotunda Tea for 2 and added a couple of cocktails to the experience because we're super classy booze hounds like that. The menu offered the usual 3 tiers of scones/cream/jam, tea sandwiches and desserts. The desserts were definitely the best.\n\nNuit a Versailles: The pot of tea we shared. A mildly flavored black tea with just a hint of smokiness\n\nSmoked Salmon Sandwich: Good but nothing remarkable\n\nChicken Salad Sandwich: Tasty and not too mayo-y\n\nDungeness Crab Profiterole: A delicious and rather unique addition to the average tea sandwich platter\n\nCucumber Sandwich: Good but forgettable\n\nGuava Cake: My favorite of the desserts. The mousse was sweet yet tangy with the perfect essence of guava (one of my favorite fruits), and the cake was so moist\n\nLemon Tart: Light, flaky crust and a great citric filling\n\nChocolate Over Lemon Cake: I don't think this was its actual name, but I can't remember. Anyway, this cake was also unbelievably moist without being too rich. Great chocolate + lemon combo\n\nHazelnut Cake: I adore anything hazelnut and was not disappointed by this\n\nFrosted White Raspberry Cosmo: My cocktail pick. Gorgeous to look at, delicious to sip. My friend ended up preferring mine to hers\n\nLemon Gum Drop de Lite: My friend's pick. It was decent but tasted more or less like a lemon drop, which you don't have to pay $12 to get\n\n\nLUNCH\nLobster Club: Applewood-smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, lemon aioli, toasted brioche and yukon gold potato chips. The most popular item on the lunch menu and with good cause. The portions are huge and the lobster is tender and fresh. The combination of the other ingredients enhance and complement but never overwhelm\n\nTuscan Chicken Melt: One half ciabatta, sliced grilled all natural chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, pesto, arugula, tomato, grilled peppers, salad and fruit. The pesto was delicious and the bread was nicely toasted. Portions were large and generous, as with the Lobster Club. However, for the price that they charge, I felt like there should have been more high-quality accompaniments--maybe a cabrese salad instead of the plain, mixed greens salad they provided?\n\nArtichoke Ravioli: Accompanied by dungeness crab, tarragon butter sauce and organic cherry tomatoes. This was absolutely delicious in every way. The ravioli were huge, soft and well-built, stuffed to the brim with an amazing artichoke pate-like filling.

It's close to Bart so it is easy to get to if you aren't from right around there. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very clean and refined, not sure how else I would describe it. It was quite quiet when I was there. \n\nI love the ceiling of the dome that The Rotunda spans around, it's gorgeous. I always admire it when I walk into or by Neiman Marcus. There aren't many places I have seen that have a ceiling as pretty as this. \n\nSo on to the food, I ordered the Lobster Club sandwich for lunch and I really enjoyed it. It was a pretty good sized sandwich and it comes with chips too, I didn't leave hungry. I would highly recommend the Lobster Club to someone that wants some Lobster in their day. \n\nIt is quite pricey - but isn't everything at Neiman Marcus? If you are thinking of coming to Neiman Marcus for lunch, you probably don't care too much about how much it will cost you.\n\nI definitely recommend coming here. To me, it would be a great place to have a nice lunch during a day of shopping at Westfield or around Union Square. If I was still living in the Bay Area and it was a really special occasion, I would consider making a special trip here for lunch. To someone that has wanted to try it for a while or heard about the beautiful ceiling and wants to see it in person, these are both good reasons to go and check it out. It might also be a nice place to take a girl out**\n\nTl;dr: 4-Stars. The Lobster Club Sandwich was quite good, I would give it 3.5-Stars by itself. But that gorgeous ceiling and the clean, crisp atmosphere definitely adds to my opinions and that is why I give it 4-Stars overall. \n\n**I would say this is definitely a nice place to take a girl for a classy lunch if it is your style!

Very yummy pasta dishes. I've had ravioli on two occassions -- butternut squash once and mushroom once. Also tried a beet and burrata salad here once, which was tasty. The popover and strawberry butter, as well as the chicken consumme are the two things I enjoy most about the meal, and both are complimentary. Service is pleasant.

You can choose from having chips, regular fries, truffle fries, or sweet potato fries when you order the sandwich. The truffle fries were absolutely delicious and were very thinly cut.

The Rotunda is something special. It has an allure that i'm sure is similar to what Holly Golightly felt when she took her morning stroll passing by jewelry she wish she owned. As you take the escalator up to Neiman Marcus you will pass luscious fabrics, designer purses, and jimmy choos. But don't let those items fool you, you don't have to have a budget like that to dine at the Rotunda.\n\nIf you haven't been here yet, you have to! Make a reservation. My first few attempts trying to eat here on a weekend I tried to get a table without a reservation and I wasn't able to get a table. After that I wised up and started making reservations. I have eaten the lobster club and crab louie from here. Both were good, were they the best seafood dishes i've ever had? No. But keep in mind you go to the rotunda not just for food but for the experience and the view too. The lobster club was on the heavy side with avocado and bacon sandwiched between buttery brioche. The seafood louie was a lighter choice and I still got to enjoy the seafood so in the future I will stick to the salads. The rest of my party ordered the steak, thai coconut curry, and mushroom ravioli. The steak was tasty, but skip the asian inspired dishes. \n\nDuring my last visit we didn't get any treats at the end of our meal which bummed me out.

Thank god I have a decent paying job now that I can afford to nitpick at their menu. :) \n\nAll day dreaming aside, The Rotunda was well worth the wait. The interior is radiant and classic. Seats are plenty, yet spaced so that guests can dine comfortably within their own group. \n\nWaiter service at the bar is average--similar to the knowledge, courteousness, and speed you'd expect at an Apple Bees or iHop, not a $$$ restaurant. In all fairness, it is the bar. However, I guess I've been forever spoiled to have frequented other upscale establishments with superb wait service outside of the formal dining area that it does take away points in my book when service is lacking.\n\nThank goodness though that FOOD was SPOT ON!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-29", "description": "I never knew Neiman Marcus had dining establishments in some of its stores across the country.  On a very busy day after Christmas while in Union Square, we decided to eat lunch at the Rotunda.  The Rotunda is located near the top floor of Neiman Marcus (second to the top-most floor, IIRC) and has a great panoramic view of the square.  Of course, this place was packed and our wait was about 1.5 hours since we didn't have a reservation.  This was fine with us as we spent all that time shopping and walking around Union Square and the surrounding area.\n\nThe Rotunda is really just a place to grab a fancy lunch (e.g. a sandwich can cost close to $30 here!).  The restaurant is not open for dinner.  The inside is bright, open, and naturally well-lit because of all the glass facing the outside.  Along with all the tables and cozy circular booths on the main floor, they also have a small stylish bar and private rooms.  The crowd can be mixed and diverse -- lots of tourists and also many female shoppers who like to show off their designer apparel, accessories, and shopping bags.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\nWarm seafood salad - seared dayboat scallops, prawns, herb butter glaze, radicchio, Belgian endive, tarragon vinaigrette\nLobster club - applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lemon aioli, toasted brioche\nGrilled rare ahi tuna Nicoise sandwich - mixed greens, Nicoise olive aioli, toasted rustic roll, herbes de provence seasoned fried potatoes\nSeared Bay of Fundy salmon - roasted sweet potato, balsamic brussels sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, leeks, radicchio, lemon\n\nThe meal started off with hot chicken broth, popovers, and strawberry butter.  According to the menu, this is apparently a \"Neiman Marcus tradition.\"  I have to say, the tradition tastes pretty good.  The broth was served in a small mug with a bite size biscuit.  Hot and savory.  The popovers are very popular.  It's basically bread that is hollow in the middle.  The outside was crispy and the inside was very soft.  The inside reminds me of the inside of a biscuit or croissant.  The strawberry butter goes with the popover and it was light and sweet.\n\nThe Seared Bay of Fundy salmon was fresh, tender, and seasoned well.  One of the best salmon fillets I've tried.  The fillet sat on top of slices of sweet potato and vegetables, including firm pieces of brussels sprouts.  The ahi tuna was also fresh and soft.  The lobster club was stuffed with *a lot* of lobster.  The fries here are pretty good - crispy and not too salty or greasy.  Overall, the food is good.  While this is a lunch place, portion sizes are quite large, so don't be surprised if you leave with plenty of leftovers.\n\nService was satisfactory.  We ordered our food before the table next to us, but they got their dishes well ahead of ours.  When our food finally arrived, they totally botched which one of us ordered what dish.  In the end, it didn't matter since we ended up sharing.\n\nIn summary, a pretty cool place to grab lunch if you're in Union Square.  If you come, definitely book reservations to avoid a wait.  The Rotunda is available on OpenTable.  Be sure to check out my Local Photos for pictures of the restaurant and the food.", "author": "Daniel B."}

They have 2 entrances, which is through the actual the department store and a side elevator entrance on Geary Street.  When it comes to parking, I gave up and just decided to park inside Union Square Parking Lot.  \n\nOrdered:\n-Pommery Pom Champagne: this was on their weekly special menu.  It had a smooth touch with citrus accents after every sip.\n-Bloody Mary: this de-virginized me.  Nice spicy kick to it and now I may just keep ordering them.\n-Lobster club: a bit on the bland side for me but it comes in 4 chunks of sandwiches, which is beyond enough to split with another person\n-Open faced prosciutto & egg sandwich: delicious with an oozing egg.  Just like how I like it.  It came with a side of salad with vinaigrette.  Not too big unlike the lobster club.\n\nKeep in mind, they served us an amuse bouche of chicken consomne (which smelled and tasted delicious.. hopefully not just full of MSG. lol) and of course their popular popovers with strawberry butter.  The popovers were the side of half of my face literally.  Eat them while they are warm only!\n\nService was excellent.  Our waiter was very helpful and friendly.  Make sure your whole entire party is there in order to be seated.\n\nNext time, I definitely would like to go back to the Rotunda for afternoon tea.  At $30 and from what the pictures have to offer, it is not bad at all!", "author": "Kathy D."}

Making the reservation was a NIGHTMARE, and I made it a good TWO MONTHS ahead of time. I had to call to make the reservation because I couldn't make the reservation on open table, and I also had a few questions.  It was impossible to reach anyone for 3 days straight and the calls would go straight to voicemail.  I left 3 voicemails over the 3 days, and nobody called me back.  Finally, I had to escalate it to the general manager of Neiman Marcus who was able to promptly take care of the issue.\n\nTIP:  Parties of 5 or less can sit by the window.  \n\nWe came for AFTERNOON TEA on a Sunday, which starts at 2:30pm. It's a set for $35 or with champagne it's $45 or with rose it's even more I think $55?  The service was great.  The food was also good.  \n\nIf they can get their act together reservation-wise, I'd give them a 5.  Host/hostess can also work on their customer service skills.

Sadly, they had a problem with their lobster shipment that day and were not able to offer the club sandwich.  So, we adjusted our plan and decided to split the tea sandwiches/desserts, each order a cup of the lobster bisque, and share an order of the lobster eggrolls.  The meal started off with a huge, fresh-baked popover served with a strawberry butter.  It was delicious!  Our server then brought the tea which my friend ordered and a tiered tray of tea sandwiches/desserts.  He gave us a brief explanation of what each item was.  There were also two small trays with clotted cream, strawberry jam, and lemon curd.  While the presentation was lovely, the food itself wasn't all that spectacular, especially given the $45 price.  However, the lobster bisque we ordered was divine!  So creamy and had small chunks of lobster. Would definitely go back for a larger bowl!  The lobster eggrolls were good as well but we'd probably skip them next time.  As others have said, the real draw here is the beautiful stained glass dome!  The service is impeccable and just what you'd expect.  Both the host who checked us in and our server were kind and attentive.

The sandwiches were worse than something I could have made at home. Lobster roll didn't taste like lobster. There was just too much sweets on the platter. Costco madeleines tasted better than these.

While I'm wearing clothes from Forever21 and H&M, everyone else here seems to be wearing expensive big brand names like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Chanel. How can I not feel like a peasant shopping next to them?! Not that I could afford anything Neiman Marcus sells.. if anything, I spend more on food than clothes! ..And that's when I decide to go to the Rotunda! \n\nLocated on the 4th floor of this beautiful department store, the Rotunda will make you feel as if you're one of rich. Imagine, surrounded by people wearing diamond accessories and expensive brand clothing, with lots of shopping bags, while sitting beneath a beautiful stained glass dome in a curved room. The dome is breathtaking! The architecture and stained glass is just exquisite.  \n\nOne of my friends (Carmen L.) has dined at the Rotunda. I told her how lucky she was to have dined at one of the places I've been wanting to go and to tell me the experience of it (Now I sound like a real peasant, just daydreaming..). She told me it was a wonderful experience and that I should come along with her someday. When she said that, I agreed immediately to go! I didn't go before because I couldn't find company. Arriving at the entrance of the Rotunda, we were greeted by the uniform'ed staff. Seated by the glass windows facing Union Square, I was just in awe of the view and everything around me. \n\n$35 per person for their Signature Teas: \n- an individual pot of tea (I chose the Jardin Bleu Tea, which is a blend of teas from India and China, flavored with rhubarb, wild strawberry, and scattered with cornflower petals -- it was okay). \n- You have about 10 choices to pick from (Black Tea, Green Tea, White Tea & Herbal Infusions). \n- refillable\n- My friend ordered the NUIT \u00c0 VERSAILLES TEA, which consists of sencha basis, bergamot essential oil, kiwi, yellow peach, orange blossom, violet blossom flavors. I think this is by far one of the better teas I've had. \n\nWhen you order the afternoon tea, the food will come served on a two-tier tray that consists of tea sandwiches (cream cheese & cucumber, smoked salmon, deviled egg, turkey club, tuna, lobster), petite sweets, and warm scone. The food itself didn't taste extraordinary but just mediocre. The tea though, was much better than Crown & Crumpets from my experience. \n\nService was good, friendly servers, but I didn't really see them around when we needed them or ask if we were enjoying the food.\n\nOther notes: \n- There's a separate entrance outside of Neiman Marcus, on the side (opposite facing of Union Square). It's an elevator! \n- $44 pp for their Grand Tea, $50 pp for their Royal Tea (Rotunda tea with a glass of champagne depending on the one you pick).\n\nOverall, the food/tea was okay-good. Expensive for the quality, but worth it because where else can you experience sitting beneath a beautiful glass dome?!

This was my first time at the Rotunda and I was very excited. \n\nI was originally going to dock two stars for the hostess stand, which did not fully satisfy my reservation request of sitting in a table that overlooks Union Square. However, after some shuffling and my mother talking to them, we were able to move to the best table. The good outweighed the bad in this situation and I realized that The Rotunda is a very special place for celebrations.\n\nFor two \"Rotunda Tea[s],\" you get the amuse-bouche of the Chicken Consomm\u00e9 and the illustrious and scrumptious Popovers with Strawberry Butter. Stop everything. Can every meal start with popovers? I wish that could be arranged in life. They were flaky, hot and the perfect beginning to the tea.\n\nFor the actual tea, you get a stand with both a savory and sweet section. The sweets vary from day-to-day/hour-to-hour, as I saw different people with a different selection of sweets. However, I was thrilled with everything we received. My favorite was the lobster puff pastry (savory) and the blueberry cheesecake (sweet). In reviews, I read that the scones were dry, but I did not find that to be the case. They were perfect and I gobbled it up with the lemon curd (amazing) and Devonshire cream (delectable).\n\nI am not ashamed to admit that I ate the lemon curd by itself with a spoon.\n\nWhen we were ready to leave, we had a few treats leftover so we asked for a to-go box.

The staff comes around, serving piping hot popovers with a strawberry butter. After hearing about the Rotunda from my mom for years, I finally had the opportunity to try it.\n\nAlthough the popovers were good, I was honestly disappointed with my entree. I ordered their daily special, King Salmon, and was initially pleased by the reasonable portion size and the presentation of the food. This is where it started heading downhill. My salmon was cold. Not even warm, but cold. Considering how much I'm paying, I definitely wanted my food to be served as it should! I mentioned it to the waiter, who said that he'd let the chef know and have a new dish prepared for me. He brought back the salmon around 20 minutes later, grinning and claiming that the chef made me a new dish. i was quite upset to find out that my dish was the exact same - same piece of quarter-eaten salmon, same scattering of veggies that I had previously had some of. Nothing changed except they heated up the food (as well as the plate). As a result, my piece of salmon was well overcooked, making it rather dry, and the sauce they served the salmon seemed to have lessened with the re-heating of my food.\n\nI was rather appalled that the server and/or chef lied in preparing a new plate for me. It severely detracted from the quality of the dish, and sadly made me rather upset for the remainder of the meal.

Anyway that's really the best part of this place. the food was fine, and tea was fine, but not so impressive for that you pay. I mean its tea. tea tastes like tea, the little finger sandwiches sweets were cute and pretty, but not very tasteful and a bit bland. The only exception was the POPovers.  they were heaven. the service was ehhh.  as nice as the waiter was he was not particularly attentive. I got one refill of hot water in my small pot of tea, and the second time around it was so weak just tasted like water, and I read reviews about getting unlimited popovers, but they were never offered again. when the presentation of finger foods came out, I saw that the trays were inconsistent with the types of sandwiches and sweets that each of us were offered, so I feel like I didn't get to try out everything they had to offer for the afternoon tea. ;(  anyway, im glad I got to experience the rotunda, and im very happy for my lovely friend and her bun in the oven, but I doubt I will be back here anytime soon for the food....I may just sneak up here from time to time just to see that ceiling tho.", "author": "Brenda B."}

I was particularly interested in afternoon tea and those famous popovers with strawberry butter everyone keeps raving about. We arrived a little before our 2:45 reservations and were seated within 5min and mentioned it was my b-day. I did feel the wait staff was a little rushed but still felt like others who got seated after us were at least getting their waters brought to them quicker than we were.\n\nFinally, we were brought some chicken consumee along with those popovers. Both were tasty but the popovers were definitely, my favorite! I decided to get afternoon tea for one, while the hubby got the lobster club for lunch. We both got a bowl of their lobster bisque, which was very delicious and not overly salty with some chunks of lobster. My afternoon tea was rather disappointed considering for $35 (which is already steep for finger sandwiches and a pastries) as it only had about 8 tiny HALF sandwiches so it was more like 4 and a few tiny desserts, which i really didn't care for. The tea pot included was very small and they used a tea bag rather than loose leaf tea so it wasn't as strong as you would expect. The black tea with berries was nice but i've honestly had much better tea and sandwiches at Lovejoys for far less. I will say their egg salad is delicious though. My husbands lobster club was far better tasting and more filling, so i would have to recommend coming here for their lunch options rather than the afternoon tea.\n\nOur bill after, came to almost $100 but i was very saddened and disappointed that at the very least neither the hostess or waiter ever acknowledged that it was my b-day, considering it was also my first time there.  Why bother having people list a special occasion when you aren't even making sure your servers are aware of it? \n\nAnyway, sad to say i am glad i didn't book my anniversary here and while the place is lovely for the atmosphere, it still leafs (pun intended) something to be desired in terms of their afternoon tea service!", "author": "Petra S."}

Was not fond of having to wait 30 min to be seated even though we had a reservation. That is NOT a great way to begin a celebration esp when the hostess kept seating several couples in front of us. I think they prefer seating the lunch crowd because they pay more, therefore more $. Our original reservation was for tea $35, but we opted for the lunch menu instead. My niece had the burrata and beet salad  and i had a bowl of their butternut squash soup. We shared a bottle of wine, which totally helped my attitude @ having to wait. Waitress was good even though she didn't come right away. The broth was barely warm and my nieces cup had lipstick on it (not hers!) The nicest part of the experience was the brownie and ice-cream that our waitress surprised us with. Lovely gesture.\nThey need to hire people who smile. Those hostesses at the front counter were rude and snotty. The food was good, but the overall experience was marred by them not honoring our 2:30PM reservation.

Perfect moisture and perfect sweetness. I love it! \n\nBest of all we each got a mimi free chicken broth and butter cream popover. The chicken broth is like 1/2 the size of an espresso. It was very flavorful, tasted like friend chicken in a cup without the fat.  The popover is so airy and delicious and the cream was good enough for me to eat alone.\n\nSince we did ordered so much food, we obviously did not finish the high tea and took part of it home.

Some with hats. Some with pearl necklaces. Some in their business suits.  \n\nBut mostly with shopping bags. Lots of 'em.\n\nMy mom and I decided to do an early Mother's day celebration here last Friday and my aunt joined us as well. I'm glad I made a reservation because this place was BUSY. They have a small area near the bar where you can grab lunch if you don't have a reservation. \n\nSince we were celebrating, mom and I imbibed on cocktails. The pomegranate martini made with pomegranate vodka, pama liquer, pomegranate and lime was too fruity for my taste, surprisingly, my mom said the same.  My cucumber martini was made with Hendrick's gin and fresh cucumbers, oh, it hit the spot. Let me say it again, it HIT the spot!\n\nWe all went the healthy route:  seafood cobb salad, warm scallop salad and a wild salmon entree.  Generous in portion, except for the scallop salad. The salad greens were fresh and crisp and my aunt was glad with the large serving of crab meat and plump shrimp on her salad. My mom raved about the perfectly seared wild salmon and she was all over that mushroom risotto it was sitting on. My scallops were on the tiny side, but flavorful and satisfying. Our lunch came with complimentary popover and strawberry butter (#73 on the Big Eats SF list) which was excellent.  I'd go back here in a heartbeat just to get my hands on that warm, buttery soft popover.  It certainly is a beautiful piece of carb that's hard to resist. \n\nCharlie was our server and I liked his easy smile and light hearted jokes. It took awhile to get our check in the end, but we forgave him.\n\nExpect to spend a good amount of moolah here, as the cocktails are priced at $12 each and the entrees are well into the $20+ range.

I could easily sit in this place all day sipping on cocktails and nibbling.\n\nMost people that come here are Neiman Marcus shoppers dressed to the nines.

They were so damn good!\n\nLobster Bisque- $9\nDELICIOUS! It was creamy sweet and savory all at the same time. I almost wish it was a bottomless bowl of soup because it was that good. My only complaint is that there should be more lobster pieces inside the soup because there wasn't enough. I didnt know there were actual bits of lobster inside the soup until later.\n\nWarm Seafood Salad- $25\nGOOD! There were large pieces of shrimp, scallops over a bed of perfectly dressed spinach. \n\nTurkey Melt- $17\nGOOD! We had to carb up before the drinks and this hit the spot. It was paired with a small garden salad and a cup of fresh berries. The perfect combo.

Then, I slowly snacked and savored my way to the sweeter scones, tarts and chocolate on the bottom - loved these too actually!!  We couldn't finish them so they provided us boxes and a nice little Neiman Marcus bag -- ooo!!  :)\n\nWe talked and caught up on things, drank champagne and giggled our way through our tiered tray of lovely afternoon snacks - loooooved it!

I ordered the lobster bisque and the beef short rib pappardelle. The bisque was okay, I may consider ordering it again. The pappardelle was terribly salty. I was so disappointed. and this is coming from a girl who would eat bacon for breakfast lunch and dinner if it didnt cause me to be morbidly obese. I just sat there and picked at the pappardelle pasta. I did tell the waiter, and he was shocked because it should not be salty. of course not. \n\nthe popover with strawberry butter is really good though.

Lackluster service.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there are so few \"old time\" restaurants left in San Francisco.  The ones that remain should be worth the effort required to snag a reservation.  Not the case with The Rotunda at Neiman Marcus. \n\nThe Lobster Club Sandwich has fallen from the great heights of yesteryear. The current version is positively anemic. The Popovers, as good as they are, are not good enough to be the only reason to come to this place.  And they really are the only reason. The rest of the menu is simply not that special when you consider the environment and the prices.\n\nThe service vacillates between bored indifference and abject abandonment. I have, on more than one occasion, waited up to 15 minutes merely to be acknowledged.\n\nThere may not be that many \"old time\" SF restaurants left but there are options if you want a truly enjoyable meal that is properly served.  Sadly, The Rotunda has ceased being one of them.\n\nI say to all of you ladies of Pacific Heights and tourists looking for a quality dining experience -- stand up and insist upon good food and good service.

When a relative invited us to have lunch inside a restaurant inside Neiman Marcus, I was immediately intrigued. First off, I don't shop at Neiman Marcus. Second, I chuckled when I heard that the name of the place is \"Rotunda.\" Is this place popular with rotund people?\n\nNot unless they have a fat wallet. Of course, this place is super expensive. But not only expensive, but a bit on the \"stuffy\" side. I mean that in a nice way, of course. When you look up, the decor is absolutely stunning, as if it belongs in a museum. There's the urban view of Union Square and nearby high-rise buildings, with the sun shining through on a clear day.\n\nWe tried the following items on the menu:\n\n- Chicken consomm\u00e9 w/ mini puff pastry\n- Popovers with strawberry butter\n- Crispy lobster spring rolls\n- Ahi tuna poke\n- Char siu smoked sea bass\n- Crab and shrimp louie salad\n- Apple cranberry galette with cinnamon ice cream\n\nThe tiny cup of chicken consomm\u00e9 was a warm touch to start things off, a nice compliment to the oversized popovers. Apparently they are known for these popovers -- baked to dark golden brown on the outside, but light and airy on the inside. They are best when eaten piping hot and smeared with their delicious strawberry butter. You could slather that butter on an old leather shoe and it would taste good.\n\nEverything else was okay. Nothing we ate were absolute duds, but neither memorable. My personal dish was the char siu smoked sea bass, which was nicely cooked and tender to the bite. The char siu flavors came through, unfortunately a bit too strong that it seemed to overpower the delicate fish. The accompanying side of cabbage slaw or salad was a joke. Unless you're a rabbit, there's way too much bland cabbage for any one human being to eat.\n\nMy wife's crab and shrimp louie salad didn't seem too exciting. I did enjoy the warm apple cranbery galette, which was warm and inviting on the inside -- a nice compliment to the cold cinnamon ice cream. Service was excellent.

The restaurant is to the top level of Neiman Marcus, if you are here for Sunday brunch there is a side entrance since Neiman's doesn't open till noon. If possible make reservations for a table near the windows, though there isnt a bad seat in the house the glass mosaic ceiling is beautiful. \n\nThe meal started off with chicken broth and mini cheese scone, really savory and light. The boyfriend was slightly confused since it was served in a mini tea cup. I devoured my pop over with strawberry butter, not very lady like considering the environment but it was good. The tuna poke was okay, not all that excited about it. It came with taro chips and seaweed salad, fresh and clean finish its not a must have in my opinion. Besides I was saving room for my lobster club sammich. It came with chips, would of been nice if it was fries but still good nevertheless. The lobster was in nice big chunks, there wasen't a over load of mayo, good sign that its fresh and dosen't need any masking. Good portion of avocado and veggies, toast was a little flaky over all very taste. Like I said before the its a great place for a light meal... even though I shared the club with the boyfriend and he had is own dish chicken paillard which was very good and he killed it... he was still hungry after we left. But I couldn't leave without trying the warm carrot cake, its topped off with vanilla bean ice cream, not to sweet, great way to end the meal.\n\nService was attentive enough, atmosphere is very 'uptown' girl feel.

It took about 20 minutes for her to give us our check and cash us out. I really did expect way better service and food from Neiman's \"restaurant\". \n\nMy overall impression is that this uppity joint is for exact just that. Uppity people that want to pay an arm and a leg for subpar food. \n\nHere's an idea of what to expect for $53 for lunch. 2 miserly portions of NOT so fresh salads, 1 iced tea, slow service and some uppity attitude when you ask for your bill.\n\nMy suggestion is if you want to eat at a department store then go to Cafe Bistro at Nordstrom's instead. They have better food and service.", "author": "V W."}

He delivered one dish, we waited 20 minutes and asked multiple people to check on our other dishes (no- one did), he delivered two more, and 25 minutes later he delivered mine. No apologies. The food also made me feel sick to my stomach. When my mom asked for fresh ground pepper he proceeded to remind her that there was pepper on the table and seemed frustrated that he had to get more. He also said he would refill my drink 3 times and only did it after saying it for the fourth time. We talked to the manager who invited my dad to a lunch to talk about the service but as I was scrolling through other yelp reviews it seem like the manger never wrote them back.

A tasty little shot of very yummy broth and a cheesy crisp certainly is a nice start to any meal.  Once you order you are greeted with a delicious popover with strawberry butter.  Everyone rants and raves about them.  I had never had a popover before the day I had lunch here, but it was certainly yummy.  The butter wasn't so fabulous though, it was good, but I was expecting more with the way people seem to adore it.  Admittedly, I did want another serving.\n\nBoth my friend and I ordered the drink special which was a blood orange and proseco mixed drink, it was tasty.  For lunch, we ordered the Lobster Club and the Vegetable & Hummus Wrap and split them both. \n\nThe Club was very delicious with just the right mixture of ingredients and it arrived looking pretty too, always a plus when you are paying $28 for a sandwich.  The bread was de-crusted, which is nice since I hate biting into hard crust when I am trying to enjoy a sandwich, and lets be honest, it saves calories.  the Wrap was equally as delicious also with the perfect blend of ingredients. although the sandwich was cold, the asparagus inside was perfectly cooked and did not have any mushy veggies messing up the mix.\n\nOne huge giant awesome plus, the menu listed calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, and protein, everything you need to make smart choices without fuss.  They also have a little indicator for meals low in calorie, \"Go Figure, cuisine for a healthier lifestyle\" as well as Gluten Free items.\n\nOne huge minus for me, they don't take Discover Card.  I found most places in SF did not take Discover, but being a huge department store you would think Neiman Marcus would take it...\n\nOverall, a great experience, our server Kelly was attentive but not overly and he gave us ample time to make our decisions on food and drink choices.\n\nOne more plus, for checking in on Foursquare the Fresh Market downstairs had a special, free cookie with purchase.  I did not spend money there, but they let me have a cookie, only spending money upstairs.  But lets be honest, I spent $50 on lunch, you should give me  free cookie.", "author": "Jasmine B."}

The presentation was modern, but it's nothing special. A 5 year old could throw that plate together. The burger was, well, a burger. I can't really say much about it. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. The pasta was below par -- the short ribs were tough and chewy. I don't know how they can mess up braised short ribs. Those things cook for themselves. Maybe the kitchen simply didn't braise it for long enough.\n\nThe best part of the meal were the popovers. I am super tempted to just order a cup of coffee and just eat the popovers and enjoy the view :). They were fresh out of the oven and oh so delicious.

It doesn't seem to matter what day it is.  It's always crowded at lunch.  We showed up at 1pm on a Thursday recently and there was still a 45 minute - 1 hour wait for a table for two.\n\nIt's a good thing (or maybe not!) that you can always amuse yourself by shopping... or if you're lucky.. grab a seat in the bar area and order one of their perfectly spicy Bloody Mary's.  It's hard to find a good Bloody Mary and theirs is of the best I've ever had. \n\nIt goes without saying that the popovers and strawberry butter are delicious.  They are legendary... and if you haven't tried one yet - you must.   They are complimentary with each meal (of course.. considering a salad can run you $23.. complimentary is relative, but still)... as is a warm, comforting demitasse of chicken consomme.\n\nMy last visit, I had the Crab Cake Ceasar Salad.  It was fantastic.  Simple, not too garlicky on the dressing... with a large crab cake and remoulade on the side.   The crab cake was fresh, with great texture and almost no filler.  I'm a crab cake snob and I loved it.\n\nMy friend had the dungeness crab and shrimp salad, with bacon and avocado over spring mix, which came with a wonderful meyer lemon vinaigrette.  Very refreshing.\n\nFor dessert we tried the chocolate peanut butter bombe...  which is a dome of peanut butter mousse enrobed in dark chocolate, garnished with berries and chocolate dusted peanuts.  Since we're both huge fans of chocolate and peanut butter together we thought it sounded fantastic... but it didn't deliver.  The mousse itself was light and airy but FAR too sweet.  Two bites and I was cringing.    It needed a darker/stronger chocolate to balance it out and more of a salty peanut butter quality, IMO.   Oh well, it was worth a shot.. and since our server had made a few mistakes in bringing us the wrong dish twice - it was comped, which was a plus.\n\nDespite the problems with service and what not, I still think it's a fine place to lunch when shopping in Union Square.

Girlish giddy giggles ensued.\n\nTo start we ordered the popovers of course, with devinshire cream. We then all decided to get the Afternoon Tea service with a variety of teas to share. \n\nOut came the popovers and we made quick work of them. Tasty and warm and really nice with jam. Next came a mini tower of tea sandwiches, sweets and pastries. It might have been a little too much for the 3 of us to handle, nevertheless, we took our time, enjoying the daylight while gabbing over gossip. \n\nThe Rotunda is a great place to go with the ladies for Afternoon Tea, I'd also love to try it for dinner as well. They have delicious sounding pastas and lobster everything. Definitely a place I'd visit again.", "author": "Jessica C."}

We had a party of 21 and we had a reservation for a private room.  Mind you we were paying full price per the private room per the contract agreement.  It's not like we had some coupon or were getting a discounted price.  \n\nThe good things:\nWe were like 20 minutes late bcs City Hall ran late and I called to let them know;  the person on the phone was really nice and there was no problem when we arrived.  That was awesome.  Also, the bus boy, Roland, was great, he was super nice and helpful.\n\nBut everything else sucked. A Lot.   \nThe service was terrible.  Given the were were a party of 21 in a private room that was contractually agreed to pay for the servers plus 21% gratuity, you would think that they would give us at least one dedicated server.  But that was not the case.  Actually, it seemed like there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant.  She was never available, we had to wait for ever for everything, and each time I went out to the restroom, she as waiting on other tables across the restaurant.  Plus she wasn't even nice about it, when we were done with our entrees and waiting for desert, I asked her to clean the tables bcs they were pretty dirty and she said \"Thats what I'm trying to do!\" with a ton of attitude.  She never did it either.   When the sorbets came out the table was full of crumbs and all the dishes hadn't been taken.\n\nThe food was terrible.  We agreed to pay $35 for each person for a prix fix menu,  but the entrees that were available were like $20 on the regular  menu and there were no sides or said  to compensate for the rest of what we were paying.  We got the bread with the strawberry butter which was yummy.  But the entrees were ok at best.  People in my party thought the chicken was super plain and almost everyone was still hungry after we finished our main dishes.  We got a sherbet dessert, but still that didn't cover it.  I had to order 9 appetizers to try to compensate for how little food we got.  It really sucked an with the terrible service I honestly wanted to cry.  It was my wedding day and I thought Id pay a little extra to have a nice lunch with my family bcs the reviews said that it felt elegant and nice.  But it felt like any other restaurant, the service was terrible, and the food was sub-par.   I was so so SO disappointed.  \n\nSo we had 21 people eating, I got 9 (NINE!!!) appetizers, and some people had alcohol.  The bill came to $1272.  When the receipt came out, it was just separated into \"catered meals, additions , and alcoholic beverages.\"  When I asked the waitress for an itemized receipt so I can just make sure it was right, she said that was the itemized receipt, and explained what the 3 groups were, like I was an idiot.  When said I wanted to see a list of everything, she said there wasn't one.  Mind you I had just had a dinner event at another restaurant last week where we were over charged $100 because they counted 2 extra people. So I had reason to want to confirm this.  Plus, I have no way of knowing if she did the gratuity correct and I did not want her to get anything more that what I was required to pay (I didn't even want to leave that!!!).  For all I know she over charged me or charged me more tip.  Mind you if it had not been required, I the service we got would not have warranted a 21% tip, if any at all.  \n\nSo basically I don't recommend going here and I certainly don't recommend going here for any special occasion.  My husband and I went to dinner at Max's Opera Cafe and I kept thinking that we would have had such a better time just getting lunch there.", "author": "veronica P."}

We were told to sit & wait at the bench right opposite to reception table is... Then I saw two ladies coming for a big party but the rest of the group was not there.. The other receptionist kindly asked the two ladies to sit at the bar area! So I asked again if we could get seated (2.17pm already and 3 of us were already there missing only 1 person)...

However, it's not as easy as just walking in and grabbing a seat. Sometimes, you need a reservation days in advance.\n\nFor Labor Day weekend, I took a trip up to San Francisco and stayed in a hotel in Union Square. I was planning on meeting a friend for lunch, and wanted a place I could walk to since I was without a car. From the Grand Hyatt, The Rotunda was just two blocks away. It's located upstairs of Nordstroms.\n\nI made reservations through my Yelp mobile app on my iPhone but had to change the reservation due to my friend's schedule. I wasn't able to change it after all because the place was SO booked! I had to change the day and time to get the reservation.

The atmosphere was more relaxed than it was pretentious, and the wait staff was friendly enough. I ordered the scallop salad, and WOW! The scallops were large, succulent, and flavorful. The salad, however, was a tad wilted. Meh. Well, at least the bread was good. ;)\n\nI also ordered the lobster bisque and I was excited to try it. I only had a couple of spoonfuls, as I was mostly focused on my scallops. However, after my lunch companion and I finished our main entrees, the waitstaff came and took our food away. I didn't even get a chance to tell him not to touch my lobster bisque! :*( Ugh. What a waste... it was good, too.\n\nAt any rate, I wouldn't say the food here is out of this world delicious and the price is definitely NOT cheap but I'd definitely come back for the ambiance.

There was a mild heat to the tangy soup which made it amazing.\n\nThe service was impeccable, food was fresh and hardly seemed pricey considering the quality of ingredients, and the ambiance is unbeatable.

The food is good and the waitstaff friendly, but what really makes the experience of dining special at Christmas is the setting. The Rotunda is on a circular balcony on the 7th floor, has a stained glass ceiling and an airy classy ambiance.  It is a perfect setting for a lunch, brunch or tea. During the holidays a 7 story Christmas tree  rises up through the rotunda and fills the spacious opening around the balcony with evergreen and ornaments. The floor to ceiling windows overlook Union Square and the city beyond.  Who needs candles with all this. It is a classy, lovely place.\n\n I had heard that you can not get a table without a reservation at this time of year on a  weekend. We stopped by at 11:30 am on a Sunday and were told the wait would be 45 min, but, we were lucky because just then a table opened up in the bar area and we grabbed it.  People usually want the window tables, but this was very cozy with a sofa for seating and there was still somewhat of a view.  I also had a preview of the menu as waiters passed by with their trays. I would have liked to take photos of all these trays passing by  but this was frowned upon by  Mr. Y  (partial founder of chaos on the home-front)  and so I restrained myself.  But it all looked very good.\n\nThe trays with espresso cups passing by were consomme that is served to all diners,a nice touch indeed. A Yorkshire like popover is served with strawberry flavored butter. This was okay, but I didn't really find the strawberry butter to be anything special. We both had the Scottish salmon served over a sweet potato cake with very flavorful sauteed veggies.  It was quite good. Lots of Champagne was flowing amongst our fellow diners  and there was a festive energy filling the balcony on this day.  Cappuccinos and a slice of Buche Noel finished our lunch. The cake was mostly whipped cream that tasted too much like butter and therefore wasn't worth the calories.  Overall, I I would rate the meal as 3 1/2 stars and the experience 4. \n\nStill, it is a special place to relax, drink, dine and be merry while in the city. A special place to escape the crowd yet take in the sea of shoppers, ice skaters and all of  Union Square below. Its' sophisticated style and ambiance is probably the only affordable thing at the infamous Neiman Marcus, and I give the Rotunda credit for not displaying an air of snootiness to all us regular folks enjoying a moment of refinement above the throng of visitors. Satisfied, we left to rejoin the bustling crowds and the hurried shoppers, in no hurry ourselves. I can't help but revisit.", "author": "Marilyn Y."}

I wouldn't expect anything less for a tea time experience at the top of Neiman Marcus and beneath a gorgeous stained glass dome.  \n\nThe prix-fixe menu lets you choose tea and treats or tea with bubbly (wow - is that an advisable combination?).  I went for the basic afternoon tea option, which came with a filling array of amuse bouche (a savory chicken broth with parmesan biscuit), various savory sandwiches, a hearty scone with a buttery, flaky pastry, and decadent desserts at the end.  I thought the food offerings were good, definitely a notch higher than your usual tea-time spots.  The strawberry flavored butter was a pleasant treat --like spreading Hagan Daaz on my pastry.  \n\nThe tea was also good.  It comes in a sleek, trendy tea pot alongside pristine white cups and silverware.  Some people might miss the frilly, colorful decor of a typical tearoom, as The Rotunda doesn't quite carry that charm with its elegant ambiance.

In years past we enjoyed the view from our window seat and the food was very good. However, a true disappointment when we were seated at an extremely small table for two by the window. When I requested to be moved I was told we could not seat at a table of four, but we could be moved to the back of the room in a booth. My husband had to sit with his back to the window and was barely able to pull his chair out. Talk about being crammed in a very small space. The most uncomfortable we have been to any restaurant in the city.  My husband and I both ordered the Burger. When served we both noticed we had fruit flies in our lettuce. I immediately called our server Megan and showed her these insects. She offered to take the meals and have them replaced, but did say that the lettuce was organic. So.....does that not mean it still can't be washed before served? Needless to say both my husband and I lost our appetite . We received our bill and much  to our surprise we were not given a credit for either meal, but instead was given a cookie box of three cookies at a cost of $11.00 as a token for our inconvenience. Never had we been so disappointed and would have expected a manger to at least approach us and apologize. BTW don't bother to ask for window seat. All you will see is construction on a new subway at the intersection below that will not be completed for another two years.", "author": "Pam M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-06", "description": "I've never been to either Neiman Marcus or to tea at the Rotunda so it was quite a treat to check it out. The Rotunda is up at the 4th level of Neiman Marcus and as you walk through and up the escalators you pass by what looks like little individual shops for each of the major super upscale fashion designers such as Chanel, Oscar de la Renata, Diana Von Furstenberg, and so many more I can't even list them. Super swanky! I have to say though, other than the beautiful stained glass window on the ceiling featured in the Rotunda (and when you first walk into Neiman Marcus), after walking through Neiman Marcus and past all the upscale fashion labels, I was a little disappointed that the Rotunda didn't seem fancier than it did. The seating and the ambience of the restaurant was just.... kind of normal... the wait staff did, on the other hand, definitely infuse an air of elegance to the atmosphere! It's hard to describe exactly. Maybe it's the straight upper lip, the good posture, the soft spokenness, the uniforms? But the wait staff was amazing and exactly what I would expect from such an upscale establishment.\n\nWhen we were first shown to our tables we were served glasses of iced water right away soon followed by demitasse cups and saucers of chicken consume with a mini cheese pastry. Next we were informed that they had made extra popovers and gave one each to us complimentary with strawberry butter. The popovers were warm and fresh. For tea I ordered the Royal Tea with Jardin Bleu Black tea. The tea was excellent with definite notes of fruity rhubarb and strawberry without being at all tart.\n\nOddly enough, for tea here you are presented with small paper packets of the usual sugar, raw sugar, and sugar substitutes rather than a proper sugar bowl. The cream we got for our tea on the other hand seemed to be real cream rather than just milk.\n\nFor our tea, each of the teas came with a selection of five tea sandwiches: lobster salad on puff pastry, smoked salmon with cream cheese, chicken salad, turkey, cucumber and cream cheese, and deviled egg salad. While more or less it was the usual fare for tea, the sandwiches were excellent and so flavorful. Very delicious! The deserts on the other hand were a little subpar. Nothing really stood out as being especially delicious, or especially decadent.\n\nThe scones were the saving grace for the sweets selection. The cranberry scones were extra flaky and very good. These were served with an extra wide selection of accompaniments: honey, lemon curd, fresh strawberry jam, whipped cream, and a lemon. The lemon was wrapped in mesh material to keep the seeds from going on your plate.\n\nFor as much food as we were served, we all finished everything on our plates. I kind of had the impression that it wasn't as much food as I am usually served for tea though it may have been that we were all especially hungry too... In any cast, we were all definitely and pleasantly full by the end of tea.\n\nIn parting, we were served single packets of chocolate mints packaged exclusively for Neiman Marcus.\n\nOverall, it was a fine tea and an excellent day out with the ladies in the city.", "author": "Christina P."}

The amuse bouche left something to be desired, and the strawberry popover that everyone loves left me saying, \"eh?\"  It's a big piece of hard bread.  Yes, the inside is airy and croissant-like, but the dark brown outside flakes all over the table and makes a terrible mess!  The strawberry butter is mild.  Halfway through I started to enjoy it, but I had to get over the lowering of my expectations.\n\nWe shared the warm seafood salad and the beef tri tip sandwich.  The seafood salad was a bit fishy.  That sounds dumb, I know, but it was.  It needed something else, maybe lemon, to liven it up a little and cut through the oil.\n\nThe sandwich was very good, and we enjoyed that immensely.

I'm officially obsessed.\n\nI came here for a Sunday lunch with friends before doing some shopping at the nearby Westfield. We made a reservation beforehand and were able to nab window seats overlooking Union Square! (Quick tip, since the restaurant is inside Neiman Marcus but opens a full hour before the store on Sundays you'll have to take a side entrance on Geary to get in). The Rotunda lives up to its name and includes a round floorspace with narrow walking room all overlooking Neiman Marcus.\n\nFor appetizers we were given chicken broth in petit mugs with a miniature biscuit cut in a crescent shape to hug the cup's base. Cute! After we made our orders we were served with individual popovers and delicious strawberry butter. I've never had popovers before but I'm positive these were objectively incredible. They were light, warm and buttery and perfectly flaky. The strawberry butter is subtly sweet and goes absolutely perfect with the popovers. Amazing! The waiters even offered us another round of popovers but fearing I'd completely lose my appetite I declined. (majorly regretting this decision now as I write this review. UGH want more popovers).\n\nFor entrees I ordered a grilled shrimp salad with quinoa, avocado and grapefruit. The dressing was a bit heavy and although there was a ton of quinoa I had a hard time finding the avocado. Portions of the shrimp and grapefruit were also sparse. Given how expensive the dish was ($20) I was expecting either something small and incredibly savory or large but with a generous serving of shrimp and other toppings. However my friends who ordered sandwiches and wraps had a substantial amount of food on the plate and I'm guessing my dish was just out of the ordinary.\n\nThe service here was very attentive. As a voracious water drinker at restaurants I was pleasantly surprised that my cup never went empty. I'd love to come back here for tea and get a chance to try more pastries because I'm positively obsessed. For lunch I think you could find better in SF, especially given the price, but the location, service and popovers make up for much of this!", "author": "Katrina R."}

He did not notify us of this charge, in fact he shoved the extra plates on our table without asking if we were sharing. When I asked him about the charge, he simply said that it was stated in the menu and it was out of his control. I felt that it was a tricky move. \n\nFor the food, it was not as spectacular as I had other times. The avocado in our salad was barely ripened and the popovers were slightly burnt. As a critically acclaimed chef, this certainly should not be allowed to be served to customers. We don't come here to pay more for less. \n\nMaybe it was the busy holiday season and the two hour wait list that contributed to lowered quality food and service.  Or maybe we just expected too much.

Even with the gloomy weather outside, all the natural light that was coming in through the windows and stained glass skylight made the place breathtaking. I had made reservations a week or two in advance for afternoon tea with a couple coworkers on a Saturday at 2:30, and we were promptly seated when we arrived. Two of us got the rotunda tea, while 1 got the grand tea, which comes with a glass of champagne. At an extra $9, I think you'd be better off grabbing a late brunch somewhere else that offers bottomless mimosas. The regular rotunda tea, though, was beautiful and delicious, and more than enough food for all of us. We were started off with the chicken consumme, which was packed with flavor. You can definitely taste the time and ingredients that went into it. Very soon after ordering, they brought out the food on a 2-tiered plate - top layer is savory, bottom layer is sweet. It comes with another platter of honey, jam, a lemony jam, whipped butter, and lemon for your tea. Things that stood out most to me were the crab puff, petit four, and chicken salad on rye (the rye is what really took it up a notch). Everything else was good, but not anything extraordinary. My least favorite would probably be the cucumber sandwich, the raspberry tart, and the chocolate cake. We also asked for popovers, which came with the much raved about strawberry butter, and I have to agree with fellow Yelpers - yum! Especially when it was just brought out, it was warm and soft, and perfect with the strawberry butter. As for the tea, I had the anji white which was light and went well with both the savory and sweet items.\n\nThis is only the third place I've been to for afternoon tea, but it is definitely my favorite. The most expensive, yes, but for the view/ambience, service, and quality of the food, worth it. Usually, I feel like afternoon tea is more for the experience than the actual food or tea. For example, Crown & Crumpet is a fun place for a girl's day but most of their food is rather lacking, while this is somewhere you can take your parents, date you want to impress, or if you're just looking for a bit of luxury and pampering.", "author": "Kathy L."}

Good... but at $28 I wouldn't get it again.\n\nOur group was pretty full so we only picked one dessert to share. We were all excited about the chocolate chip cookies in a jewelry box. Well apparantely jewelry box = cardboard store gift box!!! The box and the cookies were disappointing. The cookies had a decent flavor, but tasted like they were reheated by a microwave.

Made reservations on opentable prior to getting there (got myself 100pts) and was seated pretty quickly after I checked in.  Saw the rest of the people with buzzer with at least a 30+ in wait.\n\nGot seated in the Rotunda and welcomes with the hot chicken consomm\u00e9 and ambrosial popovers with strawberry butter.  The chicken consomme was a bit too salty for me, didn't really like it that much only took a few sips.  But the popover was DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSS i ate that entire bread and with the strawberry butter. It's a huge puff pastry, baked, it looks big, but its all air inside. \n\nWe decided on the following: \n\nLOBSTER CLUB: applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lemon a\u00efoli, toasted brioche!  Per all the reviews on yelp, had to order this. Mounds of lobster in this sandwich, so big I couldn't put it in my mouth, had to break it half and eat it with a fork.  Wasn't a fan of the lettuce they used inside, the flavor was a bit overwhelming the lobster.  The Club also came with a side of taro chips - yum!  \n\nGRILLED VEGETABLE WRAP & PETITE SALAD: grilled zucchini, yellow squash, roasted red pepper, cucumber, crisp cabbage, carrots, artichoke, hummus, sweet potato fries.  This was on the menu as a \"heart couture\" item - thinking to be healthy, opted for this selection....not a good choice.  The combo of the veggies in side wasn't a great mix so didn't really enjoy this selection.  Sweet potatoes were amazing as usual. The good thing with this choice it was only 400 cal for the entire plate - but it wasn't that good. \n\nLesson learned - if im going to go out to eat, just splurge on the menu, save the counting calories to meals at home!\n\nGreat spot to stop for lunch since it is in the middle of Union Square. Great ambiance.  Service was a bit slow - it was pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon, but it is NM after all, I expected my waiter to frequent my table a bit more. \n\nIt's a bit of a splurge for lunch, but it is worth it once in a while and if you are playing tourist for the day.", "author": "Angela K."}

The popover is huge and fluffy and the strawberry butter is really interesting.\n\nOn to the food: My friend had a chicken sandwich.  I didn't try it, but the fries they served with it were good.  I had the lobster club sandwich (without the bacon, since I don't eat bacon), which is by far, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Chilled lobster with some sort of mayo concoction, avocados, on toasted brioche.  Brioche is my favorite bread.  Very memorable.  I liked the potato chips they served with my sandwich.\n\nA little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it.\n\nMy only gripe about the place was that the guy who took our order was a little snooty.

There's certainly a fine dining ambiance but afternoon tea actually feels quite relaxed.  On my last visit, I wore jeans and a blazer and never felt underdressed or out of place. And no one's going to stop you if you stir your tea in a circular motion or something... (Though I did hear there are strict orders that anyone caught drinking with their pinky up is to be severely beaten... so keep that digit in check, yo. :-))\n\nAbout the tea -- the tea is exquisite. They serve Dammann Fr\u00e8res -- no Celestial Seasonings here! There's also a lovely attention to detail -- the flatware was perfectly polished, the linens were clean and crisply folded. Our server was attentive, friendly and offered well-informed tea recommendations. Also, anyone who offers me piping hot consomm\u00e9 and carries around a basket of delicious and buttery popovers is officially awesome in my book. The sandwiches and desserts, I admit, are nothing special but the tea, people, the tea! $35 is a bit pricier than say, Samovar or Lovejoy's ($25) but still worth it, I think, considering the quality of the tea and setting. \n\nDefinitely make a reservation to avoid any lengthy wait time. Our most recent visit was during the height of the holiday season so it was veeeery busy... fortunately, we were seated immediately. The view really is quite fantastic and definitely makes for some fun people watching. \n\nThough I do have a soft spot for Lovejoy's homey 'I want to secretly pretend I'm the Dowager Countess' feel, the Rotunda is my go-to for a modern, elegant and reasonably priced (compared to the Palace Hotel and Ritz-Carlton) tea service. \n\nAnd come on -- you're in NEIMAN MARCUS.

I was here with other afternoon tea lovers and our feelings toward this place were mutual. We selected the Signature Tea paired with three different loose leaf teas (Earl Grey and I forgot the other two.. sorry!). The set comes with a top tier of various finger sandwiches and a bottom tier of scones, madeleines, sweets, tarts, and cakes. The savory sandwiches were good, but not extraordinary. Scones & madelelines are typically my favorites, but they were both too dry! Madeleine from Costco taste so much better and they're only $7.99 per box :) The other sweets/tarts/cakes = yuck. We barely touched the dessert tray and I love desserts & pastries! \n\nThe only things I liked was the elegant, classy decor, complimentary popovers w/ strawberry butter, and the great group of friends I was with. I don't know why Rotunda is four stars on yelp - I hope it's because the food from their regular menu is better? I would give two stars, but their four stars is misleading so I want to try and bring down their rating :P", "author": "Michelle H."}

It's so San Francisco that it's ridiculous!  Their tea service is up there with a traditional tea you would find in London. I have to say that on Sunday, I didn't like being questioned about having a reservation for tea (because they only had so many tea sandwiches to go around? not sure)  I always make a reservation but I wasn't sure if I clicked on \"Tea\" or \"Lunch\" when I made it.  This kind of thing seemed flawed and made it stressful upon ordering. The waiter checked and apparently we did have a reservation for tea.   My only other complaint is that their bathrooms need to be updated.  We spent $360 (with a tip) for lunch/tea on Sunday (table of 4)... spruce up those bathrooms so that people who are spending a pretty penny can use a clean/nice bathroom.  The women's always has a long line and you can see right through the door cracks... not good!  Make them like the Westin St. Francis so they are more private. Sorry to vent but whomever decides on what happens in the bathroom needs to make a change. With that said, I will still return for high tea service but will use the restrooms across the square or on another floor in the store!", "author": "Rebecca C."}

But what really bugged, was that the lobster sammy was priced at $32; which I thought was overpriced for the amount of lobster meat actually inside the sando.  I also thought the popovers, which everyone seem to rave about, didn't live up to the hype, it wasn't soft or doughy enough for me.

I'm a somewhat regular of Neiman Marcus Fresh Market, which is pricey to me when I consider that I'm having a $15 sandwich, so you can imagine how pricey I think the Rotunda is.  We started off with the chicken consomme which hit the spot since I was craving some soup.  All my friends were raving about the strawberry butter so that is definitely a must have!  I'm not a huge fan of sweet and salty so I didn't put any on my popover.  For my entree, I had half of my friend's burger.  I was doing it low carb style, so I only had the patty.  It had a nice beefy fatty flavor so that made me happy.  I myself ordered the shrimp salad.  The shrimp were cooked nicely and the greens were nice and crisp, but the avocado wasn't quite ripe yet so that was a bit of a let down.  The avocado dressing was good though and I loved dipping my shrimp in it.

At $35 a head, it's not cheap, but so worth it!  Five little tea sandwiches, 5 yummy pastries, scone and 5 different spreads to go with it.  Your choice from a menu of teas.\n\nWe started off with their complimentary chicken consume and cheese puff.  Always a favorite of mine.  From their menu, you could choose from 3 types of tea service.  One is straight tea and pastries.  The other two included glasses of bubbly.  We just went for the tea.\n\nI had the decaffeinated vanilla tea.  I could have just smelled the tea cup all day.  So rich in vanilla, it was amazing.  I normally hate tea.  I drank two tea pots (small) of it today.\n\nFor the sandwiches, they do ask if you're allergic to anything, so I had to switch out my bleu cheese brioche for another of their chicken salad rounds.  Fine by me, because it was delicious.  There was also an egg salad round, lobster in a puff pastry, and the traditional cucumber with cream cheese.  \n\nPastries included small services of opera cake, petites fours, mini pecan pie bites, something that looked like a mini pound cake with chocolate mousse on top, and a fruit based cake (sorry, I don't know what it was).  \n\nYou also get a scone with a variety of yummy spreads that included a wonderful whipped cream, lemon curd, honey, fruit compote and fresh lemon.\n\nWe were little piggies today.

I had high tea in Victoria this past summer, but I was still impressed with my experience at The Rotunda. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, especially on a sunny day. Make sure that you make reservations, as it can get crowded on the weekends.\n\nYou can choose 1 type of tea and the rest of the menu is set. Some of the items include a small cup of chicken consomme, sandwiches (cream cheese and cucumber, curry chicken, egg salad), chocolate cake, raspberry custard tart, banana bread, and the most delicious scone I've ever had. \n\nService is excellent, and you don't have to wait very long for the tea and food to be served.

There were three couples ahead of us to get seated. The hostess told each pair the wait was around 40 minutes but the bar would be first come first serve. Each of the couple opt for the bar and so did we. The service was excellent even at the bar. The reason for the 3 stars was the food. I ordered the lobster sandwich and coffee (instead of tea). The lobster sandwich consisted of three slices of bread, a good amount of lobster, bacon, and avocado with a side of potato chips. It was not as delicious as the lobster roll at Sam's Chowder nor the Lobster Shack in RWC.

Both those entrees were $28 each, not too bad in my opinion.\n\nOur waiter, Jay, really gave us great service.  He gave us a low-down of the menu, he didn't just name off odd ingredients in the menu, he actually explained which dishes were rated what in which magazines and gave us an honest opinion of what dishes were not liked and we probably should stay away from.

Neither of us has spent any time in Neiman Marcus, which moved into the old City of Paris department store space years ago.  Despite the original building having been designated a historical landmark, Neiman Marcus demolished it after a protracted fight, erecting the current one while maintaining the historic dome.  I always disliked the Harlequin pattern of red and beige marble w/ which Neiman Marcus (de)faced the exterior, but that has faded over the past 28 years or so and now it looks OK, although the demolition of the old building by outsiders from Texas still leaves a bitter taste and explains why we haven't spent much time in the store itself.  There is a separate entrance on Geary that leads to the elevator that takes you to the 4th floor and The Rotunda.\n\nThe Rotunda has a stained glass dome w/ gold painted gargoyle-like masks at either end.  It's smaller than the Garden Court and you're closer to the ceiling.  It's beautiful and elegant in its own way.  There are booths on the upper level and tables on the lower.  The Palace concierge had said she would try to get us a booth, but when we walked in I saw what looked like an empty table at the window overlooking Union Square and wanted that.  Happily, that's exactly the table we got.  Nina sat facing in w/ a view of the Rotunda and I sat w/ a view of the Square.  We were both happy.  \n\nThe tea menu offered flowery descriptions of the tea choices.  Nina chose Early Grey and I chose Imperial English Breakfast.  To begin we were brought demitasses of consomme and tiny savory biscuits.  The teas were served in small presses like caffe filtre pots.  Both teas were terrific.  We were brought a two tiered serving tray w/ an assortment of tiny sandwiches on the top tier and an assortment of pastries on the bottom.  A long divided white ceramic dish held half a lemon, honey, clotted cream, lemon curd and strawberry jam.  I tried only the lemon curd on the scone and it was excellent, tangy and fresh tasting.  The sandwiches and the pastries all tasted marvelous. It was a lovely afternoon and turned out so much better than we had feared when we found the Garden Court closed.", "author": "Toni M."}

They kept bringing out these ahi tuna cones that were sensational. I knew I had to try a meal there.\nToday was finally the day. We were promptly seated and brought a lovely chicken consomme tasting followed by their famous pop over. My grandfather was obsessed with pop overs and he would be up at 5 a.m. every single time we visited making them each morning. It was his trademark so to speak, so it brought back some fond memories having one again after so many years. Served with the delightful strawberry butter they are a very tasty start to the meal. \nI had read about the Lobster Club being bomb so I decided to go with that. Looking around and spotting some sandwiches that appeared somewhat small I assumed the Lobster Club would be also so I ordered the Tuna Poke to start (again I had been turned on to their tuna previously).\nThe Tuna Poke was nice. Definitely sushi / sashimi grade ahi tuna (eat it now while you can because there won't be any left in 10 years). It lacked some of the truffle essence I picked up in those ahi cones but it was still quite nice.\nThe main event, the Lobster Club, was everything it's cracked up to be. Normally a sando like this goes wrong somewhere - too much mayo, not enough lobster, improperly cooked lobster, etc. Not here. This sando is incredible. The ratio of the dressing around the huge chunks of succulent lobster is perfect. Crispy bacon accompanies each bite. It is heavenly. A word or warning though - it is actually a big sandwich so don't mistakenly order too much food - the sandwich is more than enough to fill you up for lunch!\nIt's a fun atmosphere of course being in Neiman Marcup, so I'll be back. Plus, it reminds my lovely wife of times she spent with her family growing up going to Neiman for lunch, so what makes her happy makes me happy (happy wife happy life after all). She loved her grilled portabello also.", "author": "Matt H."}

It so huge and bright and airy, yet so wonderful and stunning and classy. It sort of reminds me of the bellagio hotel in las vegas.  Make sure you make reservations and ask for a table in the inner circle. you'll have a great view of union square as well as a cascading view down the four flights of the store.  \n\nAs for the food... They have a 'light' menu with calories listed which is wonderful for watching your waistline. My husband and I always get a glass of champagne with our meals, it just feels right.  \n\nAmuse bouche:   Right when you sit down they give you a tiny cup of chicken broth and a biscuit.  I can't eat it because I'm vegan, but my husband loves it. \n\nBread:  they serve a huge wonderful bread with your meal that looks like a croissant. Again I can't eat it because it's made with butter but my husband loves it\n\nHummus veggie wrap:   This is sooooooooooo good, and it's packed full of beautifully prepared veggies, and a nice side salad.  Wonderful quality \n\nLobster sandwich.  This is what my husband always gs and he loves it. The presentation is amazing and the sandwich is FULL of lobster.  \n\nOverall, this isn't the cheapest place,for,lunch, but a wonderful experience. The food is expensive, but it is great quality.  We love going here when we want to pamper ourselves after a hard day of shopping.  \n\nI'll warn you though, after that glass of champagne it's hard to get going again and hit the racks!\n\nPs, saw lots of people getting the tea time menu, it looked amazing!", "author": "Evelyn N."}

We loved the popover and strawberry butter, we didn't get any consume, but maybe they ran out.  We both had a drink, which arrived quickly.  I wish I could find the recipe for their gingerbread cake.  \n\nI knocked a star off the review because the prices are a bit high.  $95 seems high for lunch, when we only had one drink each.  The service was very good, but I think when it's so busy they shouldn't let customers fight it out for a spot at the bar area.  They say it's first come first serve and that just invites arguments.  We asked our server if he had ever seen a fist fight over a table (in the bar area), he said he's seen that and more.

I've been scouting out places in SF to continue my new love affair. \n\nRotunda really is a beautiful place to have lunch or tea. The problem is where you sit at the table. You could be facing the railing and gorgeous ceiling or you could get blank white walls. I got walls but at least my friends got to see me and a beautiful backdrop.\n\nMy friends and I had a 3pm resveration but we waited about 25 minutes for our table to be ready. This place is very crowded during weekend lunch. Many people walked away after being told the wait time without reservations. As we walked to our table, we saw all the delicious looking lunch dishes along the way. We were expecting our tea food spread to look equally tasty. I ordered chamomile and expectations shot right back down when I was brought chamomile from a tea bag. My friends however did get loose leaves in their pots. \n\nThe savory bites included cream cheese and cucumber sandwich, blue cheese puff, chicken salad sammy, lobster puff and deviled egg. Remember these are all one to two bites max but that wasn't the problem. None of it was unique or anywhere close to above average. The lobster was fishy and sandwiches and deviled egg were bland. The blue cheese puff was good but the outside should have been crispier.\n\nThe sweet pieces were a rasberry tart, brownie, petit four, carrot cake, scone and madeline. Again, nothing special. I felt like I could put together a better spread from Costco. The scone and madeline needed more butter. The brownie was very dense but still lacked a good chocolate flavor. The cakes and tart were okay. \n\nFor $35 a person dining in a Neiman Marcus restaurant, I was quite disappointed with the quality of food and tea. I would definitely do lunch over tea if I ever come back and that's a big IF.", "author": "Julia T."}

On a weekday it doesn't seem like many people go for tea so there were a number of tables available.  Regardless, it's probably best to make reservations just in case and so they are prepared. \n\nHigh tea is $35/person which comes with a two tiered tray of sweet desserts and finger sandwiches.  The selection of teas is relatively small  (only about 9 teas to choose from).  I had the Anji White which is apparently only harvest for two weeks of the year.  It was good - a light tea. \nThe finger sandwiches were pretty good but none of which made us go crazy.  One in particular had a really heavy herb kick to it which neither of us could appreciate it.  It was a herb pastry puff with a herb cheese in the centre.  I really enjoyed their seafood tart and chicken sandwich. \n\nAs for the sweet desserts, the chocolate brownie was delicious and rich.  \nThe raison scones were way too crumbly so it feel apart to the point in which we couldn't spread anything on it (it came with strawberry jam, devonshire cream, honey and whipped cream).  This was disappointing since scones are the main item I look forward to during high tea. \nTheir raspberry tart's crust also was too frail.  Both of the tart's crust broke when we picked them up.  Tart itself was good but again, crust was too crumbly. Nothing else was all that memorable. \n\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful and service was attentive.

Our wedding vibe was both elegant and modern vintage, so the dramatic and historic Rotunda was the perfect place for us. We worked directly with the manager, Lawrence Fogarty, who was so down-to-earth, honest and helpful throughout the months and months of planning. We chose delicious dinner package options, that included our choice of cake/desserts from the famed Gerhard Michler bakery, plus great wines and cocktails, custom table linens and more.\n\nMany people don't know that The Rotunda has a private entrance/elevator (the store was obviously closed), which works perfectly for an event like this (our florist helped decorate the elegant elevator vestibule). They also provided us with a large dance floor space with room for our DJ and photo booth, plus a lounge area for our non-dancers. Everything came together seamlessly, the food was delicious (filet mignon & prawns, lobster spring rolls, the famous signature popovers with strawberry butter) and our guests were blown away.

The consomme, the popovers, the strawberry butter... all things for which Neiman's Rotunda is known.  You won't be disappointed with any food you order here.\n\nNeiman's seems to have a monopoly on afternoon tea in this area as all hotels seem to point you to here if you want to get your tea on.  And I LOVE afternoon tea.  Tea service starts promptly after lunch and ends right before dinner (I think the hours are 2-5pm).\n\n$35 will get you the regular tea service and your choice of tea.  This is the \"cheapest\" option as the others only differ by including wine.  Also, if you plan to share with anyone, you'll get charged (and maybe get more to share?).\n\nI chose the Neiman Marcus Signature Green Pineapple Tea.  It was surprisingly fragrant and delicious.  I had never had pineapple infused in tea before, and I'll definitely get it again.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  No fancy tea pot/cozy set... it was rather off-putting when I received this somewhat crappy metal tea press that didn't work so well... what's up with that, Neiman Marcus??\n\nThe savory snacks were my favorite - the chicken salad was a tiny bite-sized puff pastry with salad settled inside.  The salmon mousse was my least favorite as it was waaay tooo cream cheesy.\n\nThe little fruit tarts and chocolates were super cute as expected from a fancy high-end place like this.  I'm not too much of a fan of sweets, but I enjoyed what I tried.\n\nTo accompany your freshly baked scone (mine was a berry and currant variety), you get a platter with selections of cream, raspberry jelly, honey, and lemon curd.  The honey was BY FAR my favorite.  It went so well with the scone!\n\nIn the end, I couldn't finish my sweets portion.  Was all of it worth $35?

The busboy did not clean off our table with that crumb cleaner thingy which I imagined a place like this would do, but nonetheless he was polite in clearing off our table.\n\nWe were given little cups of chicken consomme alongside an itty bitty pastry. I sipped slowly while taking a teeny bite of the pastry. It tasted cheesy. The popover, big and empty inside, was divine slathered with the delicious strawberry butter. I used up all my share of the butter. There is no doubt in my mind that I now have clogged arteries. I don't know why I ordered the butternut squash ravioli when I should have ordered the NM chicken salad. I was disappointed with my poor choice. Pasta Pomodoro serves a better version of the same dish. The Man had the Caesar Salad and he said it was plain.\n\nThe lavatory was just that. I guess I expected something more lavish, something grand. But a restroom is a restroom and that's all it was.\n\nOverall, I had a lovely experience. This place is really special and would like to return for afternoon tea (and that Balenciaga bag on the second floor!).", "author": "Candy C."}

Service has always been top notch. It is exactly what you would expect from a restaurant that charges what they do per item. It has always annoyed me that in some nice establishments, service suffers when you are paying over $100 for a meal with two people.\n\nThe style is very 'proper' and somewhat elegant. They have stunning decor that is very nice to just look at while you chat. Of course you have to order tea and drink with your pinky up or you are not getting the full experience.  I recommend the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Lobster club. My girl and I split a club and cheeseburger. The burger was very good, but not quite up to par with the lobster.

I am very surprised that I have not reviewed this place before as i have frequented the Rotunda for years.  Usually it is a great \"ladies who lunch\" place where I eat a great meal after shopping with my mother. \n\nToday (and I am hoping it is an exception because it is the holiday season) the whole place was unorganized, the staff rude and the food mediocre.  I am only giving it three stars because my other experiences rate higher.\n\nFirst of all, the hostess was extremely rude.  It always annoys me when someone who works in customer service doesn't care about the customers.  The hostess today fit the bill and since we were eating right after the place opened it couldn't even be excused by a long, hectic day. \n\nSecondly, it was loud.  So loud that I had trouble hearing my lunch companions talk.  Yes, there were many large parties in the room, but I think that the acoustics need some work. \n\nThirdly, our food came out cold and not cooked very well. I had a steak, spaetzle and green beans.  The steak was good, but the spaetzle and green beans were overcooked.  My mother's dish was also cold.  \n\nAll in all, I will return.  i just hope that today was an exception rather than the rule.", "author": "Katharine A."}

Not the best table in the house, but pretty darn good.\n\nWhen Donny S. asked if he could get his latte with soy milk, rather than dairy, our waiter told us they had no soy. When Donny asked what exactly they do when lactose intolerant patrons frequent their restaurant, the waiter stared at us blankly. We ordered 2 black coffees.\n\nThen, it came time to order. Having never been to Rotunda before, I asked if we could just have a popover with strawberry butter to share, along with our coffees. Our waiter replied that, actually, they were serving lunch at present (11 a.m.) When I replied that we had walked in just for a cup of coffee, he responded with \"We are expecting 800 people for lunch today.\" Ummm...that's great but...TOTALLY NOT MY PROBLEM. If it was an issue, you should have confirmed at the front desk that we were there for lunch - not just a cup of coffee.\n\nWe settled the bill by paying a reasonable $3 for each coffee, and a $2 per head for the normally complimentary popovers - that weren't that great. I hope they made a lot of money from their 800 tourists that ate on Black Friday - because I'm taking my repeat business somewhere else.", "author": "Amanda F."}

I had heard of this place from one of the physicians I work with down in LA who did his undergraduate at UCSF years ago. I Yelped this place first to get the scoop, read a few reviews and then made a reservation.\n\nWe arrived about 30 minutes early and requested to be alerted once our table was ready as we went straight to the bar. Upon arriving, we stopped for a second and took note of the giant opening right in the center of the seating area, with a most ornate and intricate golden-glass domed ceiling. After marveling for a minute, we found our way to the bar. The bartender was helpful in making drink recommendations, but D and I ordered our usual, a Bloody Mary ($12) for me and a White Russian ($8-10) for her. The Bloody Mary came in a tall glass with a celery stalk and olives, and two giant steamed prawns perched on the rim of the glass! The White Russian came as usual, a creamy brown and in a small glass. Both drinks were very well made and adequately priced in my opinion (given the scale of the restaurant).\n\nOur seat was ready just as our drinks went dry, so we transitioned nicely into the dining area, and luckily we got the table furthest into the restaurant, with a full span view of Union Park. We immediately received the complimentary chicken consomme and cheese cracker/biscuit after being seated. It's presentation accounted for more than the flavor/taste - it was decent. We ended up ordering another round of drinks before ordering two sets of the High Tea.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of chatting and looking around, our tea pots came followed by a large two-tier pastry mate that was placed in the center of the table. It contained roughly 5 different savory pinky-sized sandwiches on the top tier and 5-6 different sweet pinky-sized pastries on the bottom tier. In addition, they also provided us with a sauce tray that had an assortment of condiments like honey, whipped cream, lemon curd, etc. Overall, the presentation of this 'teatime' was immaculate and quite impressive; the tiny treats looked almost too cute to eat!\n\nOnce finished with the sandwiches/pastries (I left a few behind because I'm not big on sweets), we finished off our experience with yet another round of drinks... I promise we're not alcoholics! Shortly after our last round was done, we request the bill and paid. Upon paying, they offered to box my uneaten sweets, which I declined. The waiter was very helpful and even gave us a business card and wished for our return. And, as luck would have it, I'll be headed back this Saturday with my parents from out of town. I hope we have a similar experience - only this time one of us needs to order a meal to get a popover! I must try one this next time around...", "author": "Steve D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-02", "description": "This restaurant is an homage to bad management. \n\nOne can spend $500 at Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas and think, \"okay, I get it.  My ingredients were top-notch, the staff was A+, and the facility was outstanding.  Money well spent.\"  My Rotunda experience was the opposite.  I paid triple-digits for tea with the expectation that the Neiman Marcus name meant my service would be perfect, and instead was handed one of the worst culinary experiences to be had in San Francisco.  \n\n1.  When we checked in at the start of our reservation, we were told, \"stand to the side.\"  We did, and proceeded to wait another five minutes, with no idea what was happening.  Eventually the host took us to our table.  It was odd.\n\n2.  The mens' room was ATROCIOUS.  And I'm not saying atrocious by a premier shopping destination's standards -- it smelled like the bathrooms at camp, there was a pool of urine under each urinal, and the sink counter was so flooded with water that it had completely soaked through a discarded paper towel dangling over the edge of the counter and was drip-drip-dripping on the floor.  Neiman Marcus, I was disgusted with you.  If this was how the bathroom appeared, what could your kitchen have possibly looked like?  As I left the mens' room, a member of the staff walked in.  I didn't think much of it.\n\n3.  Here's the part where we needed a Ph.D. in mathematics:  a group of 6 of us sat down for high tea.  $35/pp gets each patron 1 kettle, 5 sandwiches, 5 desserts, 1 scone, and 5 toppings.  We asked if we could order three different kettles for the table, family style.  The waiter said no, everyone needs their own kettle.  We asked if we really had to deal with 30 sandwiches and 30 desserts, as this seemed absolutely insane (really, like David Lynch insane).  He said, with the look like he had been through this schpiel a hundred times that day, \"You are not permitted to split tea kettles, but you are permitted to split the sandwiches and desserts.\"  Puzzled by the prix fix menu and our waiter's instruction that we perform multivariate calculus just to figure out what we were ordering, I turned to my fiancee, who said the the same thing I was about to:  \"I don't quite understand how this works.\"  When a tax attorney and an IP attorney can't between them figure out how something works, that thing is probably more complex than it needs to be.  When that thing is ordering at a restaurant, that thing is probably a lot more complex than it needs to be.  We ended up ordering a bunch of things and having no idea how much it would cost.\n\n4.  The kettles looked small, so a few of the six we ordered were the same flavor.  Half-way through the tea service the waiter brought metal decanters filled with hot water.  If I had known this would be done, obviously we wouldn't have ordered multiples of the tea kettles, so it would have been nice to have been informed.  We're not all from merry old England, after all.\n\n5.  I didn't learn about this until later, but apparently they'll bring you warn, legendary pop-overs with strawberry jam -- as many as you want! -- but only if you know to ask.  If you aren't cool enough to know to ask, then go to hell, you get nothing.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Can you imagine going to French Laundry or Eleven Madison Park and after the meal the waiter says, \"oh, you didn't know about that?\" Shame.\"  I found this lack of communication from our waiter to be quite frustrating (it was cool, though.  He put his own tip on the bill so why bother with proper service?).\n\n6.  After the tea service, I used the mens' room again.  Okay, remember up at #2 when I said a member of the staff walked in as I walked out?  When I walked in again, over an hour later, the bathroom was STILL repulsive, which means a member of the staff had walked in, saw the bathroom was in an entirely presentable condition, and thought, \"meh\"?\n\nIn the end, it comes down to value.  What will you give me for what you're asking I pay?  I wasn't buying Chteau Rothschild wine and 55-day dry aged ribeye, after-all.  I was buying tea!  When one spends about $200 on tea, one expects perfect service and perfect facilities. I received neither, and conclude this restaurant gives back very little compared to what it takes from customers.\n\nP.S.:  The sandwiches and desserts were amazing, so, to the chefs, nice job.", "author": "Charles Y."}

For some reason there was a chunk of Ahi from my wife's Ahi sandwich stuck to the top of my bun.  Ooookay...I can just ignore that and head on to my $19 burger. \n\nIt was terrible.  I ordered it medium, and it was overcooked to oblivion.  And really, sometimes you get a well-done burger, but the quality of the beef is so good that it doesn't really matter, but this just tasted like an old shoe. \n\nI ate about 1/2 of it and even complained to the waiter.

The waiter seated us off in a corner where my friend couldn't see anything. When we ask to move tables,  since there was a great empty table w a better view, he gave us some excuse to why we couldn't move. Then the waiter spilled red wine all over my friend and me. After which, because the entire table was wet, he moved us to the requested empty table w the view. He didn't even offer to comp us after the spill.  Our food: ahi tuna tartare was good but not great, my other friends ordered sandwiches that was just ok too, but man they were expensive.  So much for a great SF experience.

Gorgeous, but on an empty stomach not even a gorgeous chiffon dress could detract me from zoning in on the Rotunda.  \n\nThe wretched minutes finally passed, and it was time for brunch, my stomach was doing flip flops, anxious to attack any sort of morsel entering the intestine and into the stomach cavity.\n\nWe were greeted with warm friendly smiles and given the option of a booth or window, we decided on the window seat for a bird's eye view of Union Square.  Lovely choice.  \n\nEvery selection enticed me to no end, but I knew that I had to narrow down my choices.  With all my excitement and stomach churning acid, I neglected to remember the freebie, NM imparts their customer, their wonderful chicken consomme, and fluffy popover.  \n\nWith hunger in mind, I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer, a delightful presentation of ahi tuna with a marriage of complementary flavors, a side mixed greens, and an accompaniment of two fried won tons, the lightest, thinest I have ever consumed.

It looks like a lot of food, but the little finger foods are uninspired. The top tier is savory, the bottom tier is sweet. \n\nTop Tier: \ncrab puff - the puff was chewy, not crispy, the crab was alright. \ncucumber sandwich - boring and could have been made by a 7 year old\nchicken salad on rye - best savory bite, imo\npuff with cheese in it - smelled good, didn't have it, cannot comment\ndeviled egg item - didn't try\n\nBottom Tier:\nwhite petit four cake - looks pretty, tastes bland\nchocolate cake - thought this would be the best, was too sweet and made me sad\nmadeline - lemony and pretty good but the chewy texture threw me off\ncarrot cake - wish it was bigger than a quarter, but it was good\nstrawberry tart with custard - easily second best\nscone - winner. it comes with a whole separate tray with a lemon, lemon curd, strawberry preserves, honey, and cream. not clotted cream, more like whipped cream. unfortunate...how are you gonna serve a scone at afternoon tea without clotted cream? \n\nI'd recommend just ordering items from the dessert menu and separate drinks.

I have no doubt that if we actually got to have afternoon tea here like we intended, I would have happily given it 5 stars. HOWEVER, here's the story. We called in to make a reservation for afternoon tea for a party of 12 or so for a birthday. We were given a choice of 11am or 2pm. Yes, I know 11am is not the afternoon, but it was a much more attractive time slot so we took it. 12 of us show up and are told that they don't have the ABILITY to MAKE tea SANDWICHES until the afternoon. Couldn't make certain sandwiches!! Then they denied that anyone would ever offer us an 11am reservation for afternoon tea. OKAY but if we were just coming in for any random lunch, why were there only 2 time slots offered, one of which was the standard time for an afternoon tea seating, and the other was apparently pulled out of some guy's butt for no reason? Perhaps, you might say, those were the only slots open for such a large group, to which I say, no, I doubt that was the case as the place was mostly empty for much of the time we were there. So we stood there haggling over a plan for almost an hour with a rather unaccommodating hostess until finally we proposed just ordering a bunch of sandwiches, salads, pastries, and tea off the regular lunch menu.

I was feeling extra bougie one day and decided this was the place my Aunt was to take my sister and I to lunch the day before Thanksgiving.  She owed us each a graduation present!  It was fair.  \nThe place is beautiful... It reminded me of the restaurant in the beginning of The Rescuers Down Under, the place where, you know.. the place Bernard & Miss Bianca were having dinner?  Well, anyway, that restaurant.  It was extra pretty at this time since there was a fat Christmas tree poking its head out right in the middle of the place.\n\nThe service is amazing.  The waiter was funny and quite charming.  He made it a fun lunch, even though we created enough entertainment ourselves.  We saw Joe Montana there, just a side note - he looked good! Shape-Ups were lookin like they worked.\n\nThe Food:\n\nPopovers:  I liked this stuff.  I wish it were warmer... but the strawberry butter thaang was good.\n\nChicken Saltimbocca:  Holy... This was delicious.  The chicken was moist, the cheese melted on it was amazing, and the prosciutto was the perfect addition of salt.  The real show stopper though was, surprisingly, the lemon risotto.  Literally the best risotto I have ever had in my entire life.  Yeah. Yumm Yumm. Yumm.  I could eat that with anything.  The hint of lemon really made this risotto taste a little fresher, so it wasn't so drab and heavy.\n\nApple Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream:  This dessert was good.  I was already really full, but this hit the spot.  The apples had a touch of sour to it and the vanilla ice cream was legit.\n\nChamomile Tea:  I capped off this delicious meal with some tea.  It was so necessary.\n\nOverall: I was beyond full and still had half of my lunch waiting for me in a HUGE Neiman's bag (yes, when you get your food boxed up they give you the biggest Neiman's bag to hold it in).  I'm not sure when I'll ever come back, maybe when I become a Lady who Lunches.  We'll See.  'til then, Rotunda!", "author": "Isabella O."}

ONly thing is that it IS pretty pricey for a salad.\n+turkey wrap sandwich: very light yet good portion to fill you up, comes with a small side of salad.\n\nThe service is usually good but sometimes if you get a bad waitress, like I did this past weekend for charging us $5 extra for \"popovers & chicken soup\" which have always been complimentary, THEN it sucks.

Our waiter was helpful in making some suggestions since it was our first time eating at the Rotunda. Like the girls we are, we were on the phone the night before asking each other what the other was going to wear to lunch. Once we got there, most everyone is dressed casually. You see a few well to do shoppers here and there, some people on a business lunch, but really, you don't have to dress like you're dripping with money.\n\nI had made reservations for lunch on opentable the day before since I figured that lunch hour on a Thursday would be pretty busy. I came here again on the following Sunday and didn't make reservations and was easily able to get a table.

It is not uncommon to find Hermes Birkin-toting red soles-wearing ladies powdering their noses (whose authenticity is questionable) in the restaurant's restroom, obviously satisfied with their purchases from Neiman Marcus. \n\nOnce you scratch the surface: the afternoon tea ($35 per person), while not exactly cheap, came with enough tasty carbs to tide you over for the day - scones with cream and jam, macaroons, mini cheesecake, crab vol-au-vent, deviled eggs, cucumber sandwich, mini carrot cakes, and giant strawberries dipped in white chocolate.  The English Breakfast tea was a tad above mediocre but then again, I'm a tea nazi, and with the right company, it was still a fun afternoon nonetheless. \n\nAnd I wouldn't take exception to going back to Rotunda.

We went up to the Rotunda restaurant and saw that they were offering afternoon tea. \"Hmm, that sounds good!\" says hubby -- that is, until he saw the price and his Senor El Cheapo alter-ego took over. \"I am not going to pay $50 for tea!\" Ok, good point. So we opted for a light dinner with drinks, which was a little bit on the pricey side but worth it if only for the yummy popovers and strawberry butter! The chicken consomme and lobster risotto were also heavenly, especially coupled with a peach bellini and mango tea (not the $50 one).

I made a reservation via OpenTable with much ease and got a seat by the balcony, which was wonderful.\n\nWe had to sit there and wait nearly 15 minutes before our server came to greet and assist us - that is, asking us what tea we wanted. Are you kidding me? 15 minutes and no apology? Not to mention the lack of emotion and energy.\n\nAnyway, the much praised about popovers and strawberry butter came hot and fresh, but I didn't find it that amazing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so good that I would crave them and or go there again just for some. \n\nThe afternoon tea was pretty...dull looking. After digging in, I learned that it was pretty dull tasting too. The mini sandwiches all tasted bland; they were just slabs of mayo with tiny bits of meat on top of flavorless breads. The mini desserts were quite disappointing as well - they were on the hard side (read: not fresh) and tasted like something you could get at Safeway. Nothing special...not at all.\n\nThe tea I got, the flowery Earl Grey, was quite nice. That was pretty much it.\n\nPer my visit yesterday, my childhood memories of The Rotunda have been demolished..I don't know if I'll go back to try their regular lunch menu....I have a feeling it's overrated again.\n\nBottomline: this place is not good for good afternoon tea FOOD-WISE - not horrible enough for you to confront or start a protest, but definitely not good enough for you to dream about or salivate when you think of it.

Really nice, really professional.\n\nThe place is nicely designed, they gave us a window table overlooking Union Square which was really nice place to seat it.\n\nSo why 2 stars?\n\nThe food is awful. So outdated, so full of fat, oil and cream - it was way too much for me. This felt like a one way ticket to the 80's. The strawberry butter is funny, others might describe it as embarrassing to serve in 2011.\n\nI don't know I didn't like what we ate from the start to finish - we had 2 appetizers, 2 mains, and one desert - and I didn't like it all. Ahi tuna poke - probably the best dish of the menu, tuna tartare served over seaweed salad - nice and not too heavy, except for the chips on the side - why chips? why put something fried on the side?\n\nFried spring rolls, were, well - fried. Steak looked tiered and dressing was bad.  Lobster club sandwich was also nothing special - the lobster meat was nicely cooked - but that's it - and of course it was served with another kind of chips - so I had 2 kind of chips in the same meal - can someone please call an ambulance?\n\nCreme brulee was very strange - the custard taste was good - but the texture was very runny, as if it was not cold enough, and the layer of burnt sugar was way too thick. \n\nI wouldn't go back to this place, and wouldn't recommend on going there, can't think on even one good reason.

The bottom tier has the cucumber with creme cheese, smoked salmon, and egg salad sandwiches, and a variety of miniature cakes and pastry.

The first time was 3 years ago, and it was awesome!  I requested on my reservation (and was given) a window table, had excellent food, excellent service, etc. etc.  Back then, it would have been 5 stars.  \n\nThis time, though?  Total EPIC FAIL!!!  First off, we had 4:30 reservations with a window request.  I do understand that they can't always honor those.  Fine.  The hostess literally took 5 minutes milling back and forth trying to figure out where the seat us.  It was weird.  I had no idea why it took her so long.  Furthermore, shouldn't they have some computer system in place to figure out where to seat people next?  Or at least some sort of better system which doesn't involve the person disappearing for an eternity.\n\nSo, we get seated, and our server doesn't bother to say anything to us for nearly 10 minutes.  Wait, I thought this was a supposedly high class restaurant??  She finally shows up to take our order, but doesn't offer us any of the popovers or chicken broth as mentioned on the menu.  Um, wtf?  Finally, I ask her what's up with that, and she said that OOPS the oven is BROKEN and they don't have it today.  huh?  Thanks for telling me, lady.  \n\nOur food comes out and I admit, the rueben I got was good, but the house-made potato chips were nasty.  Totally burned beyond recognition!  It was a great disappointment, honestly.  I don't pay $18 for a sandwich to get this type of crap.  Finally, before we left, she miraculously showed up with popovers.  They were totally overdone and crunchy.  It was just awful.  \n\nI highly doubt I will ever come back here for a special lunch again.

Aside from the delish lobster club and Asian chicken salad I devoured (see link for photos), the restaurant itself is situated under an immense glass dome on the 4th floor of the department store. The grandness of the architecture coupled with the top notch service and crisp white linens transport restaurant-goers to a completely different space and time where and when lunch was an event. Yes, the salads are $20+, but it sure beats the cost of a roundtrip flight to Europe or building a time machine!\n\nChicken consomme and warm melt-in-your-mouth GIANT popovers are complimentary, libations are a must (I went with a Mumm sparkling wine from Napa), and next time I am trying to lobster bisque!

I think this may have affected the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the service.\n\nWe walked in at 3pm and were told they couldn't seat us in the formal dining room until 4:30pm, so we opted for the bar area.  It's definitely more noisy on the bar side, but at least it's first come first serve.\n\nAs usual, we were started with heavenly warm, light, airy yet chewy popovers with strawberry butter.  The standard tiny cup of broth was so flavorful and was piping hot, perfect to stimulate the appetite.\n\nWe started with the soup of the day, which was carrot, mushroom, and fennel, pureed with cream.  It was smooth, but it had a slight bitterness to it.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the seafood cobb.  The salad was a bit disappointing in that the crab was small pieces drenched in mayo.  I specifically requested the remoulade on the side but didn't realize the freshness of the crab would be masked by sauce.  The poached shrimp was nothing special.  The blue cheese was super pungent, which I like, and it was kind of the saving grace for the salad.  We also got the open faced grilled vegetable sandwich, which was pretty hearty, and it was very satisfying with the melted brie on top, crusty bread with tomato spread on the bottom.  The best part of the sandwich was the crisp and well seasoned shoestring fries.\n\nIt was a very busy day for them, so I understand things are hectic, but I missed the polite and attentive service.  Everything today felt slow but hectic and rushed at the same time.

None of the bites were too memorable (save for this marshmallow piece of goodness), but the tea was rather splendid.

This is the spot for those housewives who have nice wallets, moms and their kids in of course very stylish clothes and the working stiffs like myself that get to enjoy the finer things in life once in awhile. \n\nMy boss treated myself and a few coworkers to The Rotunda for my birthday lunch. We were pleasantly surprised that our meal starts off with a chicken compote broth (yes chicken broth in a fancy cup) with a itty bitty biscuit and the popover with strawberry butter. The broth I took one sip off and immediately pushed to the side, it was rather salty (duuh chicken broth).. and the popover was fresh and flakey. They don't seem concerned about waste there as all my diners did receive their own strawberry butter and plenty of it! \n\nWe ordered: \n\n*2 seafood cobb salads \n* Burger \n*Grilled chicken sandwich \n*Lobster sandwich \n*Ahi Poke for a starter \n*Lobster rolls for a starter \n*Fondue for dessert \n\nOverall the food was pretty good; everyone enjoyed their dishes except for my boss. She didn't care for her burger at all. I liked my chicken sandwich - had the normal stuff like cheese, tomato, mayo, lettuce...but it was piled HIGH with chicken (and that wasn't dry either). \n\nThe only downside to our meal was that our service was extremely slow and that some of the workers seemed very not happy to be there. \n\nI think the Rotunda is great for nice views and the best part is that you're in Neiman's so you can go back for shopping on a happy full belly!", "author": "Julie F."}

Plus, the hot popovers with the delicious strawberry butter makes it worth your trip and money.\n\nI avoided the Rotunda for years because I figured there was nothing special on the menu catered to vegetarians.  One day I was on-line and perusing the menu when I discovered that they offered a \"house made veggie burger\".  I'm sure a carnivore is thinking, \"What's the big deal?\"  However, for a vegetarian of nearly 15 years, a homemade veggie burger can be a disgusting disaster.  \n\nNonetheless, I decided to check it out especially on my mother's dime.  Needless to say, I felt nervous because what if I hated it?  Would I send it back?  I'm not the type of person who sends back food if I dislike it.  I just deal with it and eat another meal soon after.  But this was a $17.00 veggie burger!  Plus, I asked the hostess her opinion about the veggie burger and she enacted an icky facial expression.  She honestly told me that she thought it was gross and believed that there were way better items on the menu.\n\nFortunately, Neiman Marcus did not fail.  Somehow they manged to produce a delicious tasting veggie burger that was totally unique.  Plus, they served it on a delicious bun with crispy fries on the side.  In fact, I returned the following week for the same entree!  \n\nMy only complaint is that the waiters and diners seem a bit uppity/snooty.  I usually feel confident about myself but I felt that people were staring at me because I did not carry a Gucci or Prada purse.  I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb in my H&M outfit and purse from DSW.  Maybe it is my insecurity and it definitely does not detract from the restaurant.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant looks very nice and features a fantastic glass window overlooking Union Square.

Seafood chowder was tasty, large, and homemade, although you could hardly taste or see the fish life.  The reverse-deconstructionist seafood Cobb salad (meaning, it was all mixed together, not in the usual ingredient strips) by contrast had many prawns and a giant ice cream scoop full of dungeness crab salad.  It's not going to win an award for innovation, but that's not why you're here.\n\nThere are lots of cute touches - an amuse of chicken consomme with a micro-pastry, an endless supply of humongous fresh popovers with strawberry butter, lots of garnishes and frills, although like the service and everything else about this place it tends more to the exuberant than the refined.  Nevermind, the place is gorgeous, it is a lot of fun, and as foo-foo as it is, it's remarkably accessible, diverse, and unpretentious.

A tall long-haired man with his Barbie companion were being seated, at the window. Hmm. The hostess said to us that they had made a mistake and our window seat was not, in fact ready. Hmm.  I later realized that the tall blonde was some tennis star and I guess he had priority.  Whatever. We were summoned to our table ten minutes later. Unfortunately the staff had not been told of the table being readied as it was, well, not ready, but still covered with left-over desserts and wrapping paper from the previous occupants' celebration. We were escorted back to the entry area and asked to wait, again. At this point I was wondering what the euro-trash tennis star was drinking. It did take just a few minutes to ready to table and we were finally seated with the perfect view on Union Square. Quite an ordeal and we hoped worthwhile.\n\nGnats. Yes Gnats. At first there was one, then the food came out and there were more. There were gnats harassing other tables, too. Were we eating on the Bayou or in San Francisco? The waiter insinuated it was a problem and apologized. \n\nEating amongst the bugs was just too much. We attempted to not let it ruin our time but when bugs are chilling in your broccoli, it is just gross. \n\nI thought later I needed tennis boy to come swat the hell out of those Gnats!", "author": "Scott A."}

The Rotunda has an afternoon tea service and it sounded like just the place to sip tea and eat dainty snacks while we asked the bride funny questions and forced everyone to unscramble words like Honeymoon and Champagne Toast.  \n\nI love the concept of the Rotunda --- it's a combination of genteel, hushed voice and white tablecloth eatery, yet off to the side is a bar area for the put-upon husbands to gather while waiting for their wives to max the credit cards.  Very comfortable, very pretty, very elegant.\n\nThe service was all you would expect.  We brought two bottles of our own champagne and they couldn't have been nicer about getting it immediately on ice, even though our table wasn't quite ready when we walked in.  The hostess also set up a side table for the bride's gifts.  I started to get irritated with our waiter for the long periods of time when he seemed to vanish, until I realized he was being unobtrusive and trying not to interrupt our giggle-fest.  \n\nWe each selected our teas and a few minutes later out comes the waiter with these pretty matching white tea pots and cups.  He carefully adjusted our tea cups, saucer and spoon, set down the little tea pots at each setting...and then he handed me a tea bag.\n\n...\n\nExcuse me?  I am paying $23/per person for some delicate dainties and a TEA BAG?  That I could have purchased on my own?   Please tell me you're kidding.\n\nDespite the lovely atmosphere, nice service, delicious teacakes and sandwiches, the fact that the Rotunda doesn't provide a real, decent tea service as part of their afternoon tea was immensely disappointing.  I expected a lot more from a place with this level of elegance than to get the same sort of tea service I would get at the corner breakfast spot.

The star of the show was the scone.   The scones were terrific, crumbly and wonderful but not overly dry.  They were served with lemon curd, raspberry preserves and fresh vanilla bean whipped cream.

For that and the food - 5 Stars! \n\nIn 2000 I was a college student in LA and was offered opening-night Giants tickets to the new Pac Bell Park, if and only if I attended a high-tea at Neiman with my best friend's mom (a second mother to me).  At that time I was a high-tea-virgin and greatly feared the experience, but begrudingly gave in due to the promise of tickets to my new Mecca Pac-Bell Park.  The problem at the time was that I had just pulled a muscle in my back playing basketball and had spent the previous night on the floor of my apartment with severe back-spasms.\n\nLong story short, I found myself at Neiman's high-tea in deep pain.  Unlike a more casual Lovejoys' tea enviornment, Neiman is very quiet and refined high-tea experience where the crowd matches the ambiance.  This of course had to be the venue for a sneezing fit, which if you've had back spasms before, you know hurts like the Dickens [Question: where is that saying from?  Was Charles Dickens a bully? Did he hit hard?]  I ended my sneezes with a very loud \"Ow, Fuck!\" that made tea cups drop and heads turn (as far as the arthritis will let them) all around the rotunda.  I turned red, pointed to my back and mouthed \"sorry, spasms.\"  I think the BenGay crowd actually was sympathetic.\n\nFlash forward to 2005:  I rented out the restaurant on the fourth of July (when they would normally be closed) to host my wedding.  It was a fantastic venue and made for an amazing food service.  No one had ever hosted a wedding (service and meal) at the rotunda before so we got to be the first. Although the food cost was high, the lack of other costs associated with weddings (location rental, table settings, tables, etc.) made the overall cost surprisingly affordable.  Plus the ceiling of stained glass and the wall of windows facing Union Square made for great photos.  I was told many a gawker in the square was spied watching our wedding from the street level.  Very cool.  \n\nI love this place if just for the pop-overs.  But anyplace where you can curse yourself to embarrassment and be allowed back to host a party earns high marks with me.", "author": "Aaron M."}

The server was nice but her uniform and apron were filthy dirty.  When we looked at the other servers, bus boys, etc. same story.  Do they not wash their uniforms??? That's crazy for an upscale restaurant.  It made me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen. Also, no excuse me or anything when the plates were put down in front of us, or when plates were cleared.  Is this a Denny's?\nMy lobster club was very good, not sure if it's worth $28 but it was good.  My partners filet mignon sandwich was way overcooked.  When brought to our servers attention she was nice and said yes, the kitchen is super busy today we will take it off your check.

Nothing to rave about though, although I suppose you can't really find crispy popovers with strawberry butter elsewhere close.  I guess.  Anyway, food is always consistent.  Service, on the other hand, is spotty.  Like today, the water boy, instead of gently pouring the water into our glasses, he kinda just tipped the pitcher over until the glass got full, splashing water all over my popover plate.  At least he redeemed himself somewhat by replacing my plate before placing a popover on it, lest my popover get soggy.  And these popovers, they're just so flaky that they make a huge crumby mess all over the table.  Or maybe that's just me being messy.\n\nAnyway, I usually order the lobster bisque followed by the ahi poke starter as my main dish.  Ahi poke is consistently delicious.  Lobster bisque is getting old.  It was super salty and kinda grainy today.  And oh, since I just about always order the ahi poke, I decided to change it up a bit and order the lobster spring rolls instead.  Those were a good choice.  Very nice.  Lobster club sandwich is good too.  And seafood cobb salad is another good one.  And get one of their Republic of Tea iced teas.  I prefer mango ceylon (althought Rep of Tea is not a Rotunda-exclusive beverage, of course).\n\nIf it's your first time visiting, or even if it's your tenth, request a table by the window.

Attentive when asked, but not what you'd expect at such a fancy dining establishment.  There were two dirty cups set, which were quickly replaced when asked. it took a long time for them to replace missing silverware, and the hostess nor the waiter could name all of the desserts we were to receive with our high tea (the waiter actually called the tiramisu a \"chocolate thing.\")  \n\nThe actual tea service was sad and painfully underwhelming.  I would not ever recommend tea at Needless Markup.  Expensive.  Small pots that turned cold quickly (they didn't pre-heat the pot, for sure).  Worst of all, they brought each of us packaged tea bags with our $37 tea service.  Everyone at the table dropped their jaw when they saw packaged tea and not big pots of fresh loose-leaf tea as one expects at formal tea services.  \n\nThe snacks came out in one fell swoop, and was heavy on the sweets.  We all wanted more than three tiny savory triangles and fewer than the 5 sweets offered per person.  Should have been the other way around.  \n\nFor about the same price, you can get English Low Tea at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, The Fairmont (my fave!),  The Palace, The King George, and the Sheraton hotels, all in the Union Square area.  If you're willing to venture outside of the Union Square area, I suggest Lovejoy's in Noe Valley.  You can also find proper Russian & Chinese tea rooms around town, especially around the Richmond district.  \n\nThe view was beautiful from the Rotunda. I liked that there was a separate entrance from the street to get up there an we didn't have to walk through the store to get to the restaurant.

My first Rotunda experience was when I was a very young girl shopping around the square with my dad.  I was very fortunate that my dad always took me with him in tow.  At a very young age I learned how to eat and shop for the finer things in life.  Note: BAD HABITS START YOUNG AND GET WORST WITH TIME!  Thanks dad :)\n\nAnyhoo, shortly after you are seated, the signature NM warm, pillowy, chewy, flaky, buttery popovers are served onto your bread plate.  These lil' treasures are served with two kinds of whipped butter: slightly sweet berry butter & sweet cream butter.  HEAVEN TOGETHER!!!  Make sure you place your order before these arrive to the table, otherwise you will be too consumed eating the popovers to actually order!  BEWARE: They will keep bringing you these hot gems until you ask them to stop or receive your meal.  OMG-these are soooooooooooo good!  SCRUMPTIOUS!

As other peeps have implied, it's ALL about the popovers. These are lovely flaky croissant-esque mega-buns that could truly be a meal all by themselves. Crusty on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. Once my Asian Chicken Salad came, I found that I wanted to scoop it up in my butter-laden bun and eat it like a burrito. YUM. The salad itself was so-so... I was eyeballing the woman beside of me with the burger. It looked good, although I heard her complaining to the waiter that it wasn't warm enough. I think fancy people - I mean really rich, legit fancy folks instead of posers like me - tend to be a bit fussy though. Good for business lunches. Not loud at all, so easy to carry on a conversation.\n\nTHE PROS\n1. The popover. Outstanding.\n\n2. The view makes this place. A lovely circular wall of windows overlooking Union Square. MAKE RESERVATIONS. You can do this online at OpenTable.com. Request a window seat in the comments section and reiterate the request when you check-in.\n\n3. Reasonably priced with decent service.\n\nTHE CONS\n1. Parking. The Ellis and O'Farrell garage is usually full after 11:30AM so you'll have to go a bit farther away (about 3 blocks instead of across the street) if your reservation is for later. Parking is about $9 for 3 hours. There is free valet on some floors at the Ellis and O'Farrell garage right behind Macy's.\n\n2. Unless I'm having a really great \"up\" day, being surrounded by the Neimanites makes me feel horrifically inferior. I'm trying to cure this with rampant use of Zoloft though. Not really a \"con\", per se.\n\n3. The food/menu is just okay. The view and architecture is what makes it an experience.

The chicken sandwich could have been promising, but the bread was so soggy and the chicken itself was cold (as the fries it came with). The tuna was way overcooked; it reminded of when I tried to sear some Ahi with pops but we overcooked it so bad that we gave it to the dog. Bad, bad, bad! After we are doing eating ( no matter what we were hungry), the managers offers his apologies and restates how the food will be comped. The apology felt very robotic. We get our check, pay and leave.

When I mentioned that I was getting a little hungry, I had in mind one of those $4 hot dogs fresh off the cart, but since we were in Neimans my friend suggested that.  So I didn't initially plan on  shelling out $60 for lunch, I was glad that I did because the dining experience was worth it.  The Rotunda itself is magnificent and the service is spectacular.  I was wearing Converse and capris so it dawned on me that I was slightly underdressed for the occasion, but I didn't feel as if someone was turning their nose up at me.  Tried the salad, lobster bisque and grilled chicken sandwich and all were tasty and filled me up so that I didn't need to eat dinner. Popovers are also yummy smeared with the strawberry butter.  I'll definitely return for special occasions and when I have friends and family in town.\n\nP.S....Yes the prices are on the high side...but what would you expect?

I just don't care for the food here.\nChicken broth and cracker thing was ok; it was free, so I'm not going to complain.\nFriend and I requested popovers w/ strawberry butter, but we were let down.  Maybe it was an off day, but the popovers seemed overcooked.  The outside was more than just golden brown, and we had trouble cutting through it with our knives.  We had to resort to using our hands, something I'd prefer not to do at a \"$$$\" establishment.  I didn't find the strawberry butter to be anything special either; it was much like the strawberry butter cream I make for cupcakes.  If you want popovers, go to Wayfare Tavern instead.  It's also free there, they're better, and they keep on comin!\nPineapple green tea and jasmine were sold out, so we settled for chamomile and English breakfast.  I'm no tea connoisseur, so tea is tea.\nI thought there would be more savory foods, but there were definitely more sweets.  My favorites were the tiny lobster roll and the deviled egg sandwich.  Yay for lemon zest and sugar crystals in the madelines, which were delish with the lemon curd and apricot jam.  Raspberry tart had a generous amount of vanilla bean in the custard, but the crust seemed mass-produced.  Blue cheese puff was hard for me to swallow, friend didn't bother finishing it.  Everything else - cucumber sandwich, tuna sandwich, carrot cake, scone, petit fours - was just meh.\nFor the price we paid, I thought high tea at the Rotunda was overrated.

She came from a wealthy family, studied nutrition, wanted to go to college to study medicine, but her family went broke, so she became a chef.... or something like that.  \n\nI'm trying to imagine what would have happened had she became a doctor.  Would those delicious salads never have existed?  Certainly all of Texas' food would have remained heavy and over-cooked.  \n\nCome to think,  the food does have a bit of a rich white-trash type of genre to it, which I absolutely adore.  It's not French, nor is it trailer-park, but a bit of both.  Unpretentious, but with flair.  \n\nThose pop-overs are delicious and irresistable.  I always thought they were laden with calories, but I'm happy to report that I've read the recipe, and in actuality, they're not bad for you!!!  (sans the cholesterol levels from the eggs, but who cares!)   They taste sinful... but as long as you don't use too much of the strawberry butter, you can eat them guilt-free.  Finally something that tastes sinfully good, that you can feel good about.  How often do you come across that!  \n\nI give it 4 stars as the service is great  and for lunch the food is better than most.", "author": "L. K."}

This time we went for an early lunch and then afternoon tea (had to stay within the Union Square area).  Lunch was fine, service was slow and unpredictible.  Waitperson had a break during our meal and left it to another waitperson to tell us.  Getting a check took forever.\n\nAfternoon Tea should be wonderful there and it is probably one of the worst versions I've had of this lovely tradition.  Tea was lukewarm and the strainer is difficult to remove and even if one could, there's no place to put it.  Food is simply below par.  Finger sandwiches were lovely to look at and several were okay, but a few were soggy.  Dessert agan has lovely presentation, but is drab and tastless - all for $35pp.\n\nThe hostess both times (and we had a res for each) was cold and bored.  She could have cared less about guests in that restaurant and acted as though it was beneath her to sit people.  She was somewhat unorganized because, despite having reservations, she had no idea where to seat us.  We observed this as a normal happening with other people as well.\n\nThe restaurant is expensive, so they need to step it up big-time.  It was not filled either time we were there, so if they want return diners, perhaps need to review how things are handled and level of food. Extremely disappointed but if one would believe the actions of the hostess are reflective of the management of the restaurant, no one cares to do it differently.  Seeing some of the phtos on this site --- esp. for tea --- that's a good photo but in reality, portions are much, much smaller and don't like that inviting.", "author": "Margaret R."}

I loved their chicken broth and puffy bread with butter. So if I couldn't find a place for lunch in the city,  NM's restaurant would be my choice.  I've been to many NM restaurants in different cities although I've never written a review.  I liked NM in SF the most because of its fantastic dome design the location in Union Square. And it seemed to be the only place keeping my favorite lobster club sandwich on its menu.\n\nThe reason to write this review was mainly for the snooty hostess here.  It actually matched quite well with NM's customer service quality if you've ever had any shopping experience with them.", "author": "Ile F."}

At least the last few times I have been over the last 9 months. Today I took the day off to run errands around Union Square and thought I would \"treat\" myself to lunch at the Rotunda.  Once again, I was so disappointed.  I am giving it one star solely for the incredibly delicious popovers. Yummy.  Here's a run down of my experience:\n* seated at nice table iwth window view, which I appreicated being by myself but it was a very slow Monday lunch.\n*  Server politely took my order, very quickly thereafter the fab popovers appeared with my iced tea.  Things were looking pretty good at this point.\n* I looked down at my popover plate and saw the smallest bug (really teeny) walking across the tablecloth in front of me.  Not a huge deal but at these prices, I wouldn't expect to see bugs of any size.\n*  I no sooner had savored my first bite of the warm popover than my asian chicken salad arrived.  Were they trying to rush me out of here but the restaurant was maybe 20% full?  I scooted it to the side so I could eat my lunch at my own (slower) pace.\n*  Glad I enjoyed the popover so mcuh because the asian chicken salad (which now contains far more limp/damp dark green lettuce leaves than ever before) tasted like it was dressed with pure vinegar.  I ate maybe four bites and just couldn't eat any more.  THeir dressing used to be so delicious.  I've ordered this salad dozens of times.\n*  So I waited . . . and waited . . . and waited . . . and waited.  Where was that waiter that was in such a rush to bring me my salad?  Surely he would see that 90% of my salad was still on my plate and he would offer to clear my table and ask me if everything was to my satisfaction.\n*  When he finally showed up, he took my plate without question (I purposely didn't say anything, thinking surely he would) and brought me the check.  I told him I was still so hungry since I had eaten so little of my salad, i'd like another popover please.\n*  A few minutes later the popover man came by and brought me a (second) warm popover - thank you very much - though I could have done without the \"You would like ANOTHER popover?\" comment.\n*  So I paid the bill - $29 for basically two popovers, an iced tea and crappy service.\n\nMaybe I'll come back with a larger group next time because I so want to love this place again and a larger group may encourage better service, but I'm starting to wonder.  Rotunda, where have you gone??", "author": "Sarah A."}

The magnificent stained glass roof and the curved windows facing Union Square make the room warm and bright.  The tables are set with nice linens and silverware with a flower on each table.  A far cry from The Pork Store in the Mission, where I often find myself on Sundays.\n\nThey start everyone off with a little chicken consomme which was yummy.  After you order, they bring you a giant popover.  I hadn't had one in years and theirs are wonderfully tasty especially with the strawberry butter they provide.  Please do not tell me how many calories are in those things!!!\n\nWe split the ahi appetizer which was incredibly flavorful.  My only complaint was that they gave us 5 chips. There were two of us.  5 divided by 2 is an odd number.  Also, there was too much ahi for just five chips.

I had to at least check it out.\nWe came around 4:30pm on Saturday (they close 5pm on weekends), but the two of us were seated with no wait or problem by the window upon request. \nService was a bit lacking... there were many times where our waiter was totally MIA, like when we waited to order for at least 5+ min, but considering we were sitting at the balcony, it's a more difficult place to wait, so it was understandable.\nRegardless, we opted for a lighter afternoon snack, and ordered a bowl of lobster bisque, a coffee, and their signature pineapple green tea. \nWe started off with what I think was an amuse bouche of chicken soup and a cheese bread?, but I'm not really sure since our waiter dropped it off and didn't explain anything. \nThen came the popovers and strawberry butter. Honestly, not thattt amazing.. I think the only thing good was the strawberry butter, but I wouldn't come here for that.\nThe lobster bisque was amazingly rich and flavorful, with huge chunks of lobster. Totally worth the $9.\nTea and coffee ($5 and $4 respectively, each came with a pitcher/infuser). My mom was shocked at the deal for these.. she thought the tea was at least $10. I suppose it's relative.\nConsidering we got that experience for a little more than $20 total, it was worth it. I wouldn't say the popovers are a must-have thing, but I think it's the overall experience of the Rotunda.. it is beautiful (and a perfect view of Union Square!) and very high-class. I give it 3.5 stars.", "author": "Jen T."}

We scheduled to go another day but she forgot and already ate lunch. We planned another day but she was so busy at work she had to cancel.\n\nWe scheduled yet another day but all her coworkers were going out to lunch and she agreed to go with them. She called me and asked if she could go or do I want her to cancel. I'm a very bratty person so of course I said no and to cancel. My mom pouts and says \"You're so mean.\" I whimper back and say \"You promised!\" She giggles and says, \"Well too bad, I'm going.\"  I asked, \"Then why did you ask me if it's ok?\" She responds with, \"Because I didn't think you'd say no!! Ok I'm going now...\" She hangs up.\n\nAfter more failed attempts, a bunch of pouting, guilt trips, nagging, and temper trantrums of \"My mommy promised to take me!\" my mom FINALLY took me to eat at Rotunda for my birthday THIS year.\n\nEven on an overcast December afternoon, the view from the restaurant is spectacular. Seeing people hurrying along in Union Square carrying shopping bags puts me in a very happy holiday mood.\n\nYou start off with a complimentary shot of chicken consomme with a cute moon-shaped puff pastry. It was a little salty but that's the way I like it. After reading so many reviews on this so-called heavenly popover and strawberry butter I was expecting to eat the most delicious thing ever. Eh... I wasn't that impressed. It just tastes like Yorkshire pudding but in a big puff. If anything, I think mine was over cooked and a bit dry. I will admit the strawberry butter was tasty. I noramlly don't use that much butter but I was slapping it on like there was no tomorrow.\n\nThe lobster club looked so delicious but unfortunately both my mom and I are allergic. :( So I ordered the cheeseburger after hearing how good it was. The burger itself isn't much to write home about but the fries were to die for. Thinly cut, crisp to perfection, with just the right amount of salt. Throughout lunch I had to maneuver my way around the plate because my mom's hands kept wandering over to steal fries.\n\nMy mom ordered the sear scallops. Oooo...they were SO good! Tender, flavorful, and juicy....highly recommended.\n\nFor dessert we tried the plate of three pettifores. It was so cute! It came on a plate divided into 9 sections (think the Brady Bunch squares). One was a puff filled with green tea gelato. The dipping sauce for this puff was creamy. It tasted like tapioca pudding minus the tapioca. The second puff was lemon with a vanilla gelato filling. Its dipping sauce was a ground up mint and basil syrup. It sounds odd but it was really refreshing. The third puff was chocolate with strawberry gelato in the middle. The dipping sauce was an ooey-gooey chocolate fudge. To finish it off, they provides a cute baby strawberry, a dollop of fresh vanilla bean whipped cream, and an orchid.\n\nThe food quality was impeccable and the service was extraordinary. Our waiter didn't seem pretenious at all. He was always smiling, checking in on us, and our water and iced tea cups were never empty.\n\nMy mother who is a HUGE high tea fan asked to see their tea menu. We looked at it and it seems reasonable and sounded good that we both agreed we should try it one day. Well...the very next day after we ate my birthday lunch here she comes home and says to me. \"Guess what?\" I look at her and say \"What?\" She smiles and says \"Don't get mad at me now!! But guess where this girl from work took me today?\" I respond \"Where?\" She slyly whispers \"Rotunda for tea.\" OMG! So of course my mom says she \"promises\" to take me there just the two of us....yup, I've heard that one before.", "author": "KayKay D."}

My server said it's the same recipe, but it doesn't matter. Something terrible has happened to the texture and flavor.

It seemed like they brought it to us straight out of the oven and it tasted very fresh. I ordered the cheeseburger medium-well, but it came out more than well done, which made the meat very dry and hard to eat. My friend had the classic chicken salad, which actually is one piece of lettuce surrounded by fruit and cold, hard chicken covered in some kind of coleslaw-like sauce. My other friend had the French dip, which was good, but not great. The garlic fries that came with the cheeseburger and French dip were skinny, crunchy, and delicious! Definitely better than the main entree itself. I saw some people at the next table who ordered the \"afternoon tea\" which came with tea sandwiches and assorted pastries that looked so cute.\n\nThe restaurant was classy and the dome in the middle was beautiful. I think the expensive prices are mostly for the spectacular view, not so much the food. But then again, maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes. Would I come here again? Maybe. But if I do, I will definitely order something different.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

The afternoon tea service is not very proper and English. (For example, the tea was served in a French press.) The interiors of the rotunda and the views surrounding it are amazing and resplendent. It is a bit pricey, but very competitive with hotels offering high tea.

Service was sort of snooty too.\nToday's visit was great! Very young and fast moving man was friendly and efficient.  The Seafood Cobb salad and Lobster club sandwich were excellent.  Tasty, fresh, not covered up with too much sauce, still resembled their natural form somewhat....YUMMY.\nCoffee was pretty good (and I am a coffee snob) 7 Baci hazelnut chocolate mousse dessert was heavenly.

Never been to NM before cuz I  hate shopping, loathe it- so coming up the escalators through four floors of merchandise and crazy shoppers to get to Rotunda was a stretch for me. But it was worth it. We had a lemon basil (I think or something similar) sort of signature drink and that was really good and the tartare app was great too. The O's Rock was way too eggy for me- like an omelette in a shell. I'm much more of a seafood purist though so other people probably really like it. The popovers were amazing and if not for sheer will power, I could eat baskets of those with piles of butter! I would go back here- maybe I can find the elevator next time cuz NM is scary!

One thing in particular I love about this frou frou  lunch destination filled with rich old ladies from Pac Heights is the fact that you can see out through the domed glass, the hustle and bustle that makes Union Square the madness that I have to endure every morning walking to the station, without actually having to partake in the chaos. Not to mention there is a gorgeous stained glass dome which spans the top of the dining area. \nAs we came mainly for the popovers, the actual lunch was a moot point- we both haphazardly picked something sounding remotely interesting from the menu- Lisa going for the seafood salad and I opting for the Asian chicken salad with fried lotus roots and black sesame dressing. First to arrive was a small cup of chicken broth served with a miniature gougere, that, when immersed in the broth pleasantly expanded to yield in essence, a soup filled dumpling. Quite good, but the real fun was yet to come. Once the popovers arrived in all their airy and buttery glory, I knew I was in for a treat. These monster pastries are a meal in and of themselves. I really wish that you could just order the popover, without having to eat anything else. Smothered with some strawberry butter, the hollow eggy delicacies were more than perfect. I was feeling completely content, and could have left it at the popover stage, when the actual salads arrived. Quite large portions, and decent food no doubt, I was so stuffed from the popover that I had trouble finishing my meal. The crispy lotus roots were the highlight of the dish, and the dressing was savory and sweet. However, what I remember most about my dining experience is not the food on the menu, but of course the famous popovers and I will be coming back for these, and these alone.

I got the re-heated popovers which is not it's best , but did not get the chicken consume.  Instead of getting my standard warm seafood salad, I decided to try the salmon with sweet potato.  Food wasextremely bland.  I love brussel sprouts but they ,manage to make it taste bad.  The food reminded me of the terrible food I had when I was in boarding school in UK.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "This is by far, my favorite restaurant to treat my mom for years!  So this review has been long over due!\nI love to take my mom here because of the decor, the view (always try to make a reservation in advance to get a window seat), the service, and the delicate cuisine this place has to offer.  You just feel pampered whenever you walk away from here.  Sure it is pricey for a lunch meal but my mom always enjoys the whole experience, which makes it worth it.  So if you are looking for a restaurant to treat that special lady in your life, I would highly recommend this place.    \n\nFor years, the Rotunda has had the same items on the menu.  Recently they have added new ones, which got us pretty excited.  Usually, whenever we lunch here we share the \"Lobster spring rolls.\"  These little guys never disappoint.  And I'd follow it with the \"Lobster Club sandwich.\"  This is a must-try if you've never eaten here: it raises Club Sandwich to a whole other level!  \nOn our recent visit, we decided to venture our palate with the \"Swiss Raclette\" appetizer instead of our rolls.  I was wondering how they would serve this dish where \"Raclette\" a version of \"Fondue\" consists of melting your own cheese on a special grill which is then enjoyed by spreading it on pieces of toasted bread, and condiments/cured meats.  To our surprise, it came on a VERY hot plate with the huge glob of melted cheese in the middle surrounded by all the items used for dipping.  The presentation definitely needs to be worked on here.  The huge thick blob of melted cheese kind of threw me off a little.  The taste of the warm melted cheese the little piece of toast was good though.  The problem is when you're taking your time to savor your food, time is the \"enemy\" for this dish.  Because as the cheese cools, it hardens and become rubbery.  So my mom and I had to wolf it down to \"enjoy\" the taste of it.  The irony of it all!         \n\nAs for the main course, instead of my Lobster Club I decided to try their new Asian Chicken salad.  Such a HUGE disappointment here!  I could have done the exact same dish at home, probably even tastier.  The meal consists of strips of iceberg lettuce, carrots, celery, cucumbers, and pieces of white chicken breast drizzled with a light dressing.  I kept on adding salt and pepper to try to bring out more taste to this dish.   But, for the experience I paid the $20.  My mom's Cioppino was excellent though.  The combination of seafood stewed in a tomato-ey seafood broth is just a blast of savory flavors.  \nWas I disappointed with my choice of meals today?  Sure, I was.  But I still give this place a five star, just because this place never fails to disappoint my mom.  And all I have to do is just to stick to my favorite lobster picks next time. And I got to enjoy their signature Popover with the mouth-watering strawberry butter! (Remember, you can always ask for a second one!)", "author": "Nadine M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-16", "description": "A very easy, slightly pricey, but rewarding place to grab lunch when you're in the midst of a heady shopping spree downtown. I've been coming to this place on and off over several years, since one of my longtime friends first introduced me to it. The menus are always changing, but the food taste and the wonderful view/decor is always the same.\n\nFirst, the food. A friend (different than the one that introduced me) and I went there today for her birthday, and we ordered the lobster maki roll, the lobster bisque, the cheeseburger, and the seafood cobb. After getting our hot, fluffy, and airy popovers (that always comes with regular and strawberry butter - yum!), along with the chicken consomme, we dug into our hearty lunch. The lobster maki was interesting, the spicy sauce wasn't really spicy but added a good pseudo chili flavor to the roll (the insides had lobster mixed with avocado and a mystery white paste, almost like mayo but not quite). The cheeseburger was huge and came with a airy, slightly burnt bun, thick slab of medium hamburger meat, melted cheese, grilled onions, butter lettuce, and tomato. The whole thing was hearty, juicy (a little oily), and hit the lunchtime spot. I like that the condiments come separately in tiny little bottles (mayo, dijon mustard, and ketchup). The thin fries that came with the burger was salted just right and crispy. I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth.\n\nI agree with Lindsey S that this place feels like a place of 'ladies who lunch.' People dress up to come here, and you can tell that they're in the midst of shopping, but they have a lot of money to spend and are more of the 'hoity toity' crowd. I always come in my jeans and whatever random shirt I happen to be wearing (since I like to dress comfortably when I'm shopping), but I like that the hostesses still seat me and my friends in nice areas near the window and treat us the same.\n\nThe decor is lovely, lots of natural sunlight, huge windows, high decorative ceilings with a mural. It's a great place to rest, watch the shoppers and street traffic below, and enjoy a somewhat pricey but good meal.", "author": "Katherine P."}

I never thought that \"department store restaurants\" could be so good.  The environment and setting is evenly and leisurely paced, the crown jewel of the architecture being the stained glass dome above you and sweeping views of Union Square if you're lucky to score a window seat.  Kick back, relax, order sparkling bottled water, savor an appetizer or two, along with the ever famous popovers and strawberry butter.  Nobody is in a rush to get through lunch -- and neither should you be -- this is where the bored and rich housewives of San Francisco come for tea and lunch after an exhausting morning testing all the newest make up and fragrances.  Everything on the menu is delicious -- and yes, I've tried everything.  The current menu has a shrimp dish which was wonderful.  My guests ordered a variety of things, and everything came out beautifully presented and equally delicious.  Service is efficient and courteous.  Key to getting the full experience of this restaurant is scoring a window table so that you can gaze out over Union Square while eating a lobster dish or crab louie.  The Rotunda also has a popular local bar.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests or just for a special occasion.

I felt we were all treated with respect and overall great service within the store and The Rotunda (nobody looked down on us because we had on casual wear). We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and given the complimentary and delicious chicken consomme as an appetizer? It was so good and perfect for the windy/gloomy weather in SF. We were given the regular menu's, so I had to ask for the tea service menu because that is what we went for. There was some confusion there as I wasn't sure what she meant by three tea services (goodies-tea pot ratio). Finally we settled on 2, my other friend had a regular drink...and when everything came out, I was confused yet again because we received one tea pot with two of each of the treats, but I was certain there were supposed to be two tea pots because they're so tiny!

We had a busy day planned in SF and wanted to start off on the right foot with a good meal.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, lots of natural light from all the windows and a very unique layout.  The atmosphere is a bit 'hoity toity'; many monied folks, probably dining before doing some serious shopping in Niemans.  My friend and I looked a bit out of place b/c we show up in casual wear (jeans, cute t-shirts, and flats).  Everyone else was older and much more dressed up.  We didn't care though, we weren't there to impress anyone and we like to be comfortable...we pushed the boundaries I suppose, but no one paid us any mind.  \n\nThe food was good, the popovers were particularly delicious.  They are huge and come out piping hot with a choice of regular butter and strawberry butter.  Yummmms.  Then the chicken consomme came...mmmm, warm and comforting.  It's the kind of thing I would want to have on a cold day, wrapped in a comfy blanket.  I had the lobster bisque and a nice seafood cobb salad.  My friend had the lobster maki roll and wagyu beef cheeseburger.  The bisque was very good, but not the best I've ever had.  Living on the east coast for a time spoiled me when it comes to all things crab and lobster.  The salad was great.  Lots of lumps of delicious, sweet lobster and shrimp.  The dressing was light and not too heavy all over the salad.  It was well balanced.  The lobster maki roll was a very large appetizer.  A unique take on sushi for sure.  The cheeseburger was huge and the fries were nice and crispy.  All of it was good and the portions were on the larger side for sure.  Both of us couldn't finish our whole plates, but we were full and happy.  The prices are a bit high for the lunch fare, but the view makes up for that.  It was a lovely lunch and if I want to have a nice girls day out, I will come back for sure.", "author": "Kristina D."}

It's expensive, but you get quite a bit of food, perhaps a bit too much even. They started us off with an amuse bouche - a little demitasse of chicken broth. My mom, sis-in-law and I each ordered different teas, and then the fun began. a 2-tiered platter came chock full of goodies! There were little sandwiches - egg salad, chicken salad, smoked salmon, and avocado. On the bottom level, there were current scones (with clotted cream, preserves and honey), and six different mini desserts! Wow! It was so much fun to sit and nibble and chat, perfect for some mother/daughter bonding between my mom and her girls.

Now, not 2 minutes later I saw a couple leave from the window area, their table was bused, and another couple was seated there. Are you kidding me?

Instead of the chips that usually comes with the lobster club, i substituted it with fries and that was a good idea because their fries were delicious! very thin and crispy.

It's not bad by all means, but certainly not worth $26 for that sandwich. I would prefer a whole lobster instead. The taro chips on the side was a bit oily too.\n\nAfternoon tea - It was totally worth going when the cost was $25 per person, the variety of mini desserts and selection of tea is good.  However, recently, they increased the price to $35; yes, $10 is not that much more, esp considering that tea at other places are well over $40, but because the desserts weren't wow, I would prefer a nice lunch instead.\n\nThe location is magnificent, love the booth seats, the view, the ceiling and everything about it; the servers are attentive and The Rotunda is definitely a nice relaxing place, esp if you plan to have long talks and etc.", "author": "Alex E."}

If I had  $375.00 for a plain white shirt with eyes on it I would as soon walk around with nothing but a long burlap sack that barely covered my genitals.  Luckily, I only had to venture through the store in order to eat at the Rotunda for brunch and mother-in-law was treating us for our 1st anniversary.  The Rotunda is a beautiful place inside and has an unequaled view of Union Square.  I ate the Seafood Pasta and it was great.  The only problem I had was with the black, squid-ink dyed pasta.  I don't know about you but I for one have an aversion to eating black things.  I'm sure that eating black things claimed a lot of lives in the evolution of man.  I can imagine an early homo erectus goading another into trying a rabbit turd for the first time and then grunting with satisfaction after seeing his duped buddy's disgusted, pursed face.  I digress.  The food and the service at the Rotunda were great and I would definitely go back when I'm in the neighborhood.

N.B.: you need to order from their lunch menu if you want their delicious popover (which is just like the Yorkshire pudding, as Caroline L. commented, only bigger) and even more yummy strawberry butter.  We found this out when one of my very eager and very blunt friends asked for bread straightaway but was told that if we were just having tea, we would have to order (and pay) for the popover separately.  Luckily we were eating both lunch and tea.\n\nThere's nothing very unique or ambitious about the offerings, but that doesn't mean it's not tasty all the same.  Their tuna poke, seafood cobb salad and lobster rolls are very fresh.  I don't have much tea experience to compare with, but the tea service has your standard tea sandwiches (egg sandwiches with little clover sprouts, another that had chopped up pickles), mini tarts and desserts, scones, lemon curd and fresh cream, and is reasonably priced at $25.  \n\nWhile I thought the food was enjoyable, what really made the experience is sitting in the rotunda window facing Union Square.  On a bright sunny day, the scene at the rotunda really pops out.  Perfect place for a girls' lunch.", "author": "Elaine W."}

The food at the Rotunda is surprisingly very good for a restaurant inside a department store; mind you this Neiman Marcus, so you expect the food be great regardless.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the Rotunda is the chicken consomme they give you (in a tiny cup) and the popover.  I love this soup, it is so good and always makes me warm inside.\n\nIt is hard to order a lot for lunch, but I always go there on an empty stomach because there are so many things on the menu that are great.  \n\nBoth my husband and I always order appetizers. He always get the lobster bisque and I always get the ahi tuna poke.  Both are fantastic!!  The lobster bisque is creamy, rich and full of flavour, while the tuna poke has more food than I need.  The tuna is so fresh and perfectly seasoned to go with the taro chips and avocado.  It was so good and so large in portion I gave about 10 bites to my husband.  We both just loved it!!\n\nFor our entrees, I usually order one of their salads - the last couple of times, I had the seafood club salad.  There is so much crab and shrimp on this salad it is worth the $19.  The shrimp is not the tiny little ones either. They are the ones that are about a dollar coin in size!!!  The crab is always sweet is is my favourite part. I always save this for the end.\n\nMy husband usually orders the Kobe beef burger (his middle name is cheese burger...lol).  The burger was fantastic, made just to perfection.  My favourite part of his meal was his fries....It was fried with a little bit of truffle oil and man was it GOOD!!!  I kept picking the fries off his plate the whole time, and I am not a huge fries fan, but this was so good!!!  The make homemade shoestring fries, thin cut.  So good.\n\nAfter all this food we find ourselves waddling around Union Square to work off our huge tummies.  So worth it.  Always a great meal and we always look forward to going there again.", "author": "apple b."}

The Lobster Bisque is a must to wet the palate.  It is smooth like velvet and filled with chunks of lobsters.  I look forward to eating their Pop-up, yum.  I always have the Lobster Club. It's luxuriously delicious.  I saved room for dessert when I saw they have Eggnog Pound Cake this year.  It is accompanied with a scoope of pumpkin ice cream and presentation beats any 5* hotel restaurants.  Although food is worth raving about but above all it is the service that brings us back here.  It seems the staffs make it their mission to offer top notch service.  I feel pampered and taken care of.  Dining at the Rotunda is not about eating a meal.  It feels more  like being at a spa.

It must stem from my days back in the corporate buying offices where I got spoiled with the best NM restaurant right in the building.  I think the view and atmosphere at the Rotunda is amazing.  The views of Union Square absolutely can't be beat when it's a sunny day.  I've gone here several times, usually when I am shopping in the area but also for girl time during their afternoon tea.  While I think the formulaic recipes are all very good, service is not as polished as a place that charges almost $30 for a sandwich should be.  I feel that the inconsistent execution has definitely frayed my image of the NM restaurant brand.  There's been a few times where I've found lipstick marks on the drinkwear and the waiters simply look tired and out of it, though always very nice.  The popovers with strawberry butter of course is a staple and I can never get enough of the chicken broth  (I always ask for another one!).  My favorites are the seafood pasta and the lobster sandwich.

Strawberry butter smothered on big, airy popovers and a glass of champagne will lift your mood any day of the week.

One quick note: While dining there is a slight chance that you will encounter the occasional awkward model run in. A few years ago I was dining with my mom and two strikingly creepy women came over to our table and just started striking poses and smiling at us. The two of us were not sure what was going on, and my mom (mid bite with leafy greens hanging from her bottom lip) smiled back and looked at me as if I knew what was going on. It was weird and creepy and something I found a bit crass for lunching with the ladies.

My grandmother, who needs the aid of a walker, and I decided to meet downtown for lunch and thought we would try their famous high tea.  We were ignored and not seated until I had to flat out ask for some help.  Then the hostess was irritated that my grandmother was not able to go down the stairs to the table where she wanted to seat us.  It was not busy in there at all today mind you, so the fact that I had to explain that we needed a table on the upper level, when there were more than plenty available, was rather insulting.

But now The Rotunda has become a lovely airy and sunlit room that serves positively bad food.  And it serves it badly too.  At a recent lunch, we waited a full hour for our meals; after half an hour, the waiter came up to tell us that \"it would just be a moment more.\"  And when the food came, half an hour after that, it was appalling: my companion's chicken breast, the dish that apparently required so much time, was dried-out, and not all the scrambled mess called \"corn ragout\" could moisten it.  As for my grilled shrimp salad, the crustaceans had been cooling their heals for too long, both before and after the grill.  The quinoa salad that served as their resting place was just slush; visually, you'd be hard pressed to tell it from the corn ragout.  Even the famous popovers were not up to par, as hard to break into as the all but frozen strawberry butter.  There are no doubt some reasons to go this place--to enjoy the view of Union Square, to see rich well dressed people posing for one another, or to feel oneself among them--and many diners will find such reasons sufficiently compelling to pay,  for instance, $6 for a glass of iced tea.

I've been to the Rotunda many times.  It's a staple for a nice relaxing girls-day lunch or taking mum.  It was our go-to location for afternoon tea....that was until a few weeks ago.    \n\nTo our surprise the 'afternoon tea' selection changed and not for the better.  Our first clue was having been served hot chicken consomm\u00e9 - usually not served with afternoon tea, the flavor does not go well with tea.  On top of the $10 increase per order, the tea sandwiches have been replaced by a few tiny hors d' oeuvre toast points with a smaller dollup, yes a dollup of salmon mousse, chicken salad and one other that neither of us were fond of.  I love housemade desserts just as much as everyone else, but serving 4 mediocre toast points with ~12 bite-sized sweets is not a meal, nor high, grand or royal tea!   The 2 shrunken scones were accompanied by the smallest serving of lemon curd and cream.  Our nice afternoon tea was anything but nice.  Traditional teapots have been replaced with a small individual coffee press, yes coffee press - which isn't refilled with hot water unless you can flag down your waiter, who disappeared upon ordering!  \n\nGiven the increase in pricing, I would have expected my palate would be tickled, not stung.  There is a reason people have opted for the nickname 'needless markups'.  I'd like to go back at some point, if the resto should wise up and stop trying too hard.   They are loosing the core of what made The Rotunda a great place - good service, good food, great ambience.  All of which have decreased over the last year.  A shame really.
