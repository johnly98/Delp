And of course, we were also hungry. So of course, we found ourselves ordering some desayuno en El Taco Loco before we hit the road.\n\nGood choice, Dad. Funny enough, we both ordered the chile relleno. Again, great choice. We were served generously egg-battered poblanos that were stuffed with Oaxaca cheese. The chiles offered a nice spicy kick, but the heat was far from overpowering. They were also served con frijoles that tasted like they were fried with plenty of amor.\n\nSure, El Taco Loco may be a tiny hole in the wall on a mostly ungentrified (at least, for now...) street in the Mission.

With the Giant's playoff admiration, I was hopeful that the taqueria would be broadcasting the National League Playoff on the huge TV.\n\nInstead, the taqueria and its employees and patrons are loyal soccer fans. The taqueria don't realize the Giants are in the playoffs with a huge chance of going to the World Series and perhaps, win it all. If the Giants win, it would definitely be good for many struggling businesses throughout the Bay Area.\n\nBut no, the taqueria's main love is definitely soccer. Because of soccer being shown, a star is taken off for that. I do like soccer, esp. FIFA World Cup, but the entire city of San Francisco's current focus is watching the Giants play.\n\nThe 24th street is still busy despite of the abrupt rain, including El Farolito Taqueria and many adjacent businesses. So I had no choice and ate here. I ordered the Carne Asada Super Burrito. For $6.00, the burrito is not in the same league as El Farolito's. The meat tasted like ground beef used in a Sloppy Joe sandwich. \n\nBeing here like twenty times and majority of the time, I usually have good burritos from here. Maybe I came on an off-day!\n\nThe burrito didn't taste that good especially eating and watching soccer with Manchester United played without United States' own Wayne Rooney. \n\nSince the Giants are going to the World Series, it will remain to be seen, if the taqueria will show any of the World Series.", "author": "Matt G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-07", "description": "I live in what I lovingly refer to as \"Taqueria Canyon\" and have frequented pretty much every place within a six-block radius of 24th and Mission over the last 4 years. Over this time I've had my favorites, mainly Farolito, San Jose, La Taqueria, and now... Taco Loco. I eat at least 4 burritos and/or tacos a week, and am sort of picky about who I give my business to. I judge Taquerias based on a few crucial criteria - and this is how El Taco Loco adds up:\n\n1) Do I ever get sick from the food? - Taco Loco has never made me sick. Farolito has - several times, in fact. We're not just talking upset stomach here, we're talking food poisoning.\n\n2) Is it expensive?\nTaco Loco has the cheapest prices around for regular/super/veggie burritos, and the burritos are huge! San Jose and La Taqueria are both too expensive to eat at regularly. Pancho Villa, El Toro and Cancun have small burritos for the money. The main reason why this place is my favorite!\n\n3) Is the meat incredible? \nBest Carnitas in the Mission - hands down! Al Pastor here is awesome - it's a little different every time (sometimes they put cloves in it!) Chicken is good, Carne Asada is not their strong suit, but acceptable. At the end of the day, pork is king here.\n\n4) Do they give you free chips? \nYes - though they are occasionally stale. My one gripe about the place, but they are still free. Farolito and La Taqueria charge you - total bullshit. Chips are part of the burrito experience.\n\n5) How is the salsa? \nIt is very good, but Farolito has my favorite salsa verde and San Jose has the freshest pico de gallo. It's a slight weak point which will sometimes sway me to go to San Jose - but I ALWAYS come back to the 'Loco!\n\n6) Is it crowded with clueless chatty hipster kids and sleazoids? \nFarolito is the most overrated place, and it's refreshing to always go to Taco Loco and not have to deal with annoying people in lines. The staff is friendly and I get my food within 3-4 minutes every time. San Jose is also mind-blowingly uncrowded, even late on a Friday night!\n\n7) Do the burritos have something special about them that keep you coming back? \nThere is a mystical quality to Mission burritos that allow you to eat them every day for a week, or more. Some places have it, some don't. El Taco Loco definitely has it, and I still do not get tired of their burritos/tacos after eating there well over 100 times. The food is always made with love and the super, regular, and even veggie burritos are satisfying every time. \n\nBottom Line:\nThe people who own Taco Loco know how to treat their customers, and they are all very nice and friendly without imposing. I look forward to bringing new people to try the food, and support them as I do all local businesses that have something special to offer. I don't think you can go wrong with the 'Loco, and it's one of the best-kept \"secret\" Taquerias in the Mission. I selfishly hope they don't become too popular, but ultimately wish the best for their business.", "author": "Chris j."}

I'm talking about a two-men-enter-one-man-leave Taqueria Titan.  My taq. triumvirate also includes Taq. San Francisco and Taq. Guadalajara, all on 24th St.   If you like one of these, you probably will like them all. \n\nHits:\n\n1)  Pork products: a rotating spit of al pastor and about 10 lbs. of carnitas under hot lights greet you upon entering.  I'd much rather see that than some name-tagged uber-chipper hostess any night of the week.\n\n2)  Burritos are consistently excellent in every way.  I usually order a super al pastor with black beans and no sour cream.  The tortilla is almost always well grilled and served hot with abundant melted cheese.  The meat is the star of the show, taking up almost two-thirds of the insides.  Beans and rice play a supporting role, like a Black Sabbath bass line.  \n\nVeggie-wise, the fresh and spicy pico de gallo mixes with the gloppy (in a good way) guac to trick your brain into thinking that you're eating something almost healthy.  Almost.  The well-barbecued pastor is not exactly the leanest of meats.\n\nEven on an off night, the worst I've had has been a 4-star burrito -- only a little bigger than average, a few shreds of unmelted cheese, and other minor whinings.  \n\nBut on a night like tonight, the stars were aligned for the eclipse, and the forearm-sized super-hot multi-hyphenated giant-killer brought much-needed closure to a long work day.\n\n3)  Carrot products: excellent (albeit a bit pulpy) carrot juice, and even better (and plentiful) spicy carrots.  I'm turning orange, and I fucking love it.  The salsa verde and pico de gallo are good, too.\n\nMisses:\n\n1) Like many taquerias, the chips are only factory-fresh.  Tonight they were a bit stale.  But do you really go to a taq. for the chips?\n\n2) The place occasionally smells like some strong fresh-scented industrial cleaner.  Such is life near the 24th and Mission BART.   At least you know they're keeping it clean -- they consistently wash their hands here, particularly before throwing carrots into their huge juicer.  That's a plus.", "author": "Steve K."}

For al pastor, I used to go to San Jose and La Altena, and for carnitas, I used to go to Guadalajara and El Metate, but I can't remember the last time I went to those places.  Now there is only El Taco Loco.\n\nIn all fairness, I would probably go to El Metate more often, but it's a whopping six blocks from my house, while El Taco Loco is piss drunk stumbling distance away.\n\nI can't really figure out why this place is so empty, while, for example, El Farolito stays busy.  I'm not an El Farolito hater (in fact, I love the carne asada there), but both places seem pretty equal to me in terms of overall quality of food, salsas (I like the salsa verde a little better at El Taco Loco, chunkier, more character), cleanliness, and friendliness.  Yet El Farolito is packed (even during times El Taco Loco is open), while only some people are in El Taco Loco.  Is it really the minor price difference?  If so, I guess you pay a little extra not to stand in line.  Fair trade to me.\n\nOne random thought: Ever notice how there is a positive correlation between whether a taqueria serves radishes on the side and the general quality of the place?  Not a surefire test, but a pretty good indicator.\n\nAlso, one small bit of false advertising.  Buche does not mean pork neck.  It means pork stomach.

I usually have chicken or carne asada.  They have most everything else you would want as well, and seem to have various seafood dishes on weekends (signs are in spanish so I am not really sure).", "author": "Steve W."}

Baby papusas holding hands, tortas with mustaches and six shooters, etc. Ah, I love it all. One of the best things about El Taco Loco is the mural outside the building. Wait, first of all, it's not right out front, it's on the side of the building that faces the 24th St. BART, above where the roof of Carlos' Club ends. Look up next time you're in the area. So this mural, it's a jalapeno with a gun chasing after a frightened taco. The jalapano looks like a bad ass and the taco looks like a nerd, meaning he has glasses. I wonder why they call it El Taco Loco when the jalapeno is obviously the crazy one. I want to know that story.\nSo, El Taco Loco, the food is pretty good. The al pastor is nice and satisfying. There is a salsa bar with some hot salsas. The place is clean. The price is good. It's way better than El Farolito's and there's no line out the door. They pack the tacos with meat. Oh, and it's right next to BART, not to mention Carlos' Club. Carlos' Club always reminds me of that part in Gremlins where they take over the bar Phoebe Cates works at. I'm not sure why, maybe because that bar seems so festive and the movie takes place at Christmas time. Either way, El Taco Loco gets my vote.", "author": "Daniella C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-30", "description": "Since there are so many Mexican restaurants within even a one block radius of this place, it's only worth considering El Taco Loco (ETL) relative to its alternatives. I'll compare it to El Farolito, the nearest of these alternatives (I've never been to Taqueria San Jose).\n\nPrice: El Farolito wins.  Burritos looked a bit pricey at ETL, but (to be fair) they were enormous. \n\nFriendliness: ETL wins, maybe just because El Farolito is a madhouse with customers most of the time.\n\nSalsas: I prefer ETL's, especially since they have a little more variety.\n\nIngredients:  El Farolito by a long shot. Good marinades at ETL, but the tortillas and cheese at El Farolito are the best I've had in SF.  \n\nSummary: El Farolito is a better deal and tastes a little better, but if the line is out of control (as it is much of the time), ETL is a nice alternative.", "author": "Daniel S."}

I was a bit reticent at first, given it was empty and fairly dumpy, even by Mission standards. But don't let that stop you from enjoying a great burrito! Al Pastor is my go-to and these guys don't disappoint in that department. The meat is tender, the proportions of ingredients spot-on and the burrito well-wrapped. Minus points for stale chips and a lackluster salsa bar (though the salsa verde was tasty), but it's forgivable since they deliver a pretty satisfying burrito experience.", "author": "Chris O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-24", "description": "So, at first bite, the carne asada taco was quite tasty. First thing I notice when I grip the taco: the corn tortillas are perfect. The temperature was not too hot to the point where I couldn't hold the taco without burning my hand, and the consistency was firm--you could tell they took the time to grill this to perfection on the burner. But most importantly, the double-layered morsels of goodness had a taste that was neither too strong nor too weak--just perfect, subtle hints of corn that hit the roof the mouth with the first bite.\n\nThe red sauce was quite tasty as well. Great consistency. Maybe it could have been a bit spicier, but all-in-all quite good.\n\nNow, when taking the second bite, I really tried to hone in on the flavor of the meat. I was trying to isolate the flavor, and I got some, but it wasn't much. I then tried the meat by itself, and it just wasn't screaming as loud as I would have liked it to. It wasn't flavorless, and it wasn't flavorful--it simply had some flavor, and that's it. It was then when I realized why the first bite was so good, but the second bite was just merely okay: the meat was decent, but really the taco's flavor was coming from the double-layered corn tortillas and salsa roja that was holding it together.\n\nFor the reasons above, I rate these tacos as Asi, asi :| -- these tacos are okay, and I could come here again, but there are certainly betters.\n\nPlease note that this review in no way reflects the taqueria as a whole (atmosphere, location, etc); but rather, this review is reflective of the tacos served at the taqueria.

I don't know why other than the flavors blended best. The Carne Asada was a close second-the meat was very tender- this was actually the burrito I got the first time I went. I got the veggie burrito the second time I went because I'd already had meat three times that week which is my limit these days. This last time I was excited to try another type of burrito and was surprisingly disappointed. I had the bbq pork burrito. It was just strange tasting. I don't know how else to describe it. I actually didn't even finish it but I think my dog, Sheba, was pretty happy about that as she got to eat the pork I ripped out for her.  Next time I go back, I'm getting the veggie one with the works again. In fact, I think I'll go here when I'm eating too much meat because I know I'll be very  happy to order the veggie burrito.", "author": "Lucy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-27", "description": "Two and 1/2  Stars. The Good: Extremely convenient location, Across from McDonald's, and steps from 24th Street and major bus stops and Bart.  Accepts ATM & credit cards. Varied and good menu with many out of the norm Mexican dishes.  Have Mexican specialties and seafood which can be awesome, if the right cook prepares it.  Has consistently good, medium priced food during weekend brunch - mornings. Has a breakfast Burrito and Coffee Special that beats McDonald's for the price. Has an afternoon Taco special, which is hard to beat. Free salsa & chips with order.\nThe Bad:  Don't use their bathroom, its gross. Go across the street to McDonald's. Thugs and homeless people can be bothersome, so don' t sit by the door. Closes early 10pm weekdays, it can be dangerous. The quality and size of the portions are extremely cook dependent (inconsistent). Sometimes the rice is not very good. You never know the quality of what you are going to get.\nExperience. This last time, the two of us went there at 3PM.  Short line, clean with plenty of seating. I ordered chicken tacos and a burrito. The tacos were scrawny and were overloaded with onion and drowned in hot sauce. I like hot sauce and they were cheap, so that was OK to me but not to my friend. As for the Burrito, the rice was not very good and a Baby Burrito Around the corner is bigger.  I have eaten here many times and it is generally a good alternative to McDonald's, across the street (they both take ATM & credit cards), but it is way too cook dependent. I left hungry. (That cook has been moved or replaced since).\nConclusion, if you want out of the norm good reasonably priced Mexican dishes, go there in a weekend morning. If you want an inexpensive small breakfast burrito & coffee, during their morning special or their taco special in the afternoon they are good deals. If you are looking for good fast Taqueria food, go to either of the two other Taquerias in the 24th street corner. Their food might not be as good as Taqueria Taco Loco2 some times is, but the inconsistency in the size and taste of their food, particularly in the evenings, and the uncleanliness of their bathroom brings Taqueria Taco Loco2 down a star or two.", "author": "Charlie T."}
