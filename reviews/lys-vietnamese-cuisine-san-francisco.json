And was looking for something warm and fast.\n\nSearch of Yelp showed many options in walking distance, so I decided to go for some Pho.\n\nLy's is a relatively small place, seats about 25-30.  Got to my seat after about 2 minute wait. The place was quite clean and had three flat screens, two with Thursday night football and one with professional vacation videos of Vietnam.  TVs are important to me as I often find myself dining alone while on business.\n\nOrdered pork rolls and combination pho with Thai tea. Rolls came out quick. Tender, chewy, lots or herbs and the pork was tender and delicious.  Then came the pho. Portion was generous, meats were tasty. I especially liked the tripe, it was cooked so that much of the usual rubberyness (sp?) Was gone and replaced with an al-dente pasta texture.  The broth , which we all know is the real star of a good pho, was hot and delicious.  Could have enjoyed it as is, but I like some spice in mine so as usual I added some chili paste and Sriracha.  The only (very minor) thing was that the broth lacked a little salt, but was remedied by my adding the spicy stuff.\n\nThe staff was quick and attentive.  All three of the floor staff knew all that was going on with each table and were helping each other.\n\nNo parking other than the street as is usual in the city.\n\nOverall, an excellent experience. Would return if given a chance.", "author": "Matt F."}

It's not spacious, but not cramped either.\n\n[Food]\nShaken Filet Mignon: Your typical B\u00f2 L\u00fac L\u00e1c dish, served with white rice and accompanied my a fried sunny-side-up egg and lettuce, spinach, chopped onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers.  Sweet fish sauce on the side.  The beef was kinda rare on the inside, which was my first time eating this dish rare.  There's not much difference in taste compared to fully cooked beef.  The egg was charred and crispy on the bottom, and still runny on top.  I enjoyed the egg a lot.  The onions could have been replaced with sweet onions--they were somewhat bitter.  Could have given me a bit more beef, too.\n\n[Service]\nDidn't take our orders with pencil and paper.  I actually asked for Shaken Tiger Prawns, but she gave me Filet Mignon, which is fine.  I didn't mind.  Refilled our water often.", "author": "Huy N."}

The chicken came on the side to retain crispness- looks like it was grilled then fried maybe? Anyway, my BF said it was delicious and added some good flavor to the pho. Wish I could try it!\n\nWe also got a couple iced coffees. They were delicious, that nice desserty sweetness you get in Vietnamese iced coffee.

Service was incredibly fast - they brought me my noodles in under 5 minutes! The soup was steaming, piping hot and smelled delicious. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was pretty good. The broth was cooked with tomatoes to balance out the slightly seafood-y taste and is a bit heavier than that of pho, but still very clear and not too oily. It had a few pieces of fried tofu and fish / crab paste pieces in it, and the vermicelli wasn't mushy or overcooked.\n\nNot sure I'll ever be back again simply because it's so out of the way for me, but, overall the food is good for the price.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

A quick yelp search in the area and I found Ly's on Lombard street so we decided to go check it out.  We arrived around 2:00 PM on a Sunday.

You know that feeling when the next day the hangover really starts kickin in and all you can think about is eating your hand off you're so hungry.  Yup. Cue that feeling.

They went to every other table, taking orders, seating new guests, clearing tables. IM STARVING OVER HERE! AH!

Shortly after we placed our order the server brought over the usual side of sprouts, lime wedges, basil and jalapeno.  The Pho arrived and I was happy to have a massive bowl of steaming hot soup to chow down on.  I was a little disappointed overall in the flavor and quality of the veggies.  Vegetarian broth for Pho is always a hit or miss for me and I felt this one to be a little flavorless. I had to add quite a bit of sriracha and basil to kick it up a bit.  Also, it was lacking in veggies.  I only got about 3 small cubes of tofu, mostly cabbage and a lot of mushrooms that had an odd spongy texture.  Overall, it did satisfy my cravings and warm me up.

Next time I'm going to get just beef pho with brisket and meatballs.\n\nThe place itself is pretty large and there was plenty of seating. The service here is ridiculously nice and attentive. The free cucumber water even tastes so refreshing! We also got the spring rolls ($7) which tasted fresh. My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl with imperial rolls ($12).

Lys is not your traditional Vietnamese place, so there aren't many options of different types of meat that can go into your pho. But I feel like they have a few things that are unique to them. I ordered the crab paste noodles, by the time my food got to me (there was a mishap where the kitchen didn't see my order) my family had already finished their meals and I was extra hungry. I ate that bowl of noodles like no other. The crab paste is kind of like a giant blob? Of crab and egg I fee like. None the less it was really good. And the soup I think is a tomato paste? But I tried the pho soup from my sister and that was really good. I also was able to take a couple bite of the garlic noodles with grilled pork which was also bursting with authentic flavors.  \n\nAll in all, excellent place I can see myself craving this place and coming often if I was from here.

My soup, an Americanized Bun Rieu, had a nice, delicate, and balanced broth, but was not authentic.

In a way, they really let the food here stand out, because the ambiance is not their top priority. You come into this small place with the bare essentials in terms of a restaurant space, but walk out amazed at their food. Do not let the outside of the space or the inside fool you: this place rocks!\n\nThe Veggie Pho that I devoured was fabulous! They really have a winning recipe here. Tasty vermicelli, unbelievably flavorful broth (with a slight mushroom taste to it), some tofu and broccoli. All I can say is that this has to be the go-to dish if you're looking to get into Pho and you are vegetarian. The garlic noodles are delightful as well; savory flavor and very satisfying. You really can't go wrong anywhere on their whole menu. Also, the service here is fantastic. You can expect to always have your food on the table in just minutes. Anyways, you get the point right? \n\nFinal verdict: it's not easy finding a good Pho spot in the Marina, but the addition of Ly's to the neighborhood was a great one. It's a perfect place on a rainy day, when it's cold or just when you need a pick-me-up.

The broth was very tasty without being overpowering in any direction. The tomato was a lovely addition to offset that aftertaste of crab. I would have preferred a chewier rice noodle that is usually served in pho, but I honestly can not complain. The noodles were served with the bean sprouts, cabbage, mint, jalapeno slices, and lime wedges. The bean sprouts and the cabbage didnt taste very good so I didnt put any in my soup.\n\nThe pandan waffle was very fragrant and was served with coconut ice cream and a thin drizzle of red berry sauce and a mint leaf. The waffle itself was bright green but fragrant with pandan flavor. The coconut ice cream was a little icey but i actually like a little ice crunch in my ice creams. The berry sauce was very sweet and at times a little overpowering. I didn't eat the mint. \n\nDecor: \n\nThe decor was vert simple, as if the restaurant had just opened.

I have an unruly addiction for pho and since there aren't that many good pho places in the Marina (and Asian food in general but that's a story for another time) Ly was my saving grace.\n\nI've had the beef pho, vegetable vermicelli plate, chicken pho, and crab paste noodle soup here so far. If you come here for your first time, I would definitely recommend the chicken pho. I'm usually not a fan of chicken pho because I find it to be less flavorful than beef pho, but Ly's chicken pho is so fragrant and flavorful. In fact, I've literally gone here to get chicken pho three times now in the past week and a half that they recognize me now. The beef pho is delicious as well and if you're looking for something heavier, the crab paste noodle soup hits the spot! My least favorite so far was the vegetable vermicelli bowl. It didn't come with the pineapple, lettuce, bean sprout, daikon, carrot, scallion, peanut, and fish sauce like the menu said. It was just vegetables and vermicelli, which was a letdown. If you're going to eat here, skip everything else and get the pho.\n\nThe food here is authentic (in terms of adapting to the Marina crowd the best it could) and delicious.

No need to go to overpriced Saiwalks, you can get a fresh hot large bowl of pho for $9-10 bucks.

Granted, the place was relatively empty, but it quickly filled up during the course of my meal. The service was excellent. My waitress was very, very nice and only added to the overall lovely experience I had. Seeing I was seated next to the speakers, she checked if I was okay with the music volume (absolutely I was, once I heard \"This I Promise You\") and refilled my water (lemon water, which was quite refreshing). \n\nI ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls (shrimp) for an appetizer, the Beef Pho (3 type combination because I'm indecisive), and a Thai Iced Tea for a drink. They weren't kidding when they said Fresh Spring Rolls. I took a bite and, honestly, it was one of the best spring rolls I've had in a long time. The peanut sauce that it came with really burst with flavor, as well. Then the Beef Pho portion was *huge* to the point that I literally took a Snapchat of it and went \"They expect me to eat all of this?!\" And by some miracle, I did, or at least most of it. I added Sriracha and some hoisin sauce, as per my usual take on pho, but the meats and noodles were perfectly cooked, while the broth was perfect. Couldn't finish off the broth (seriously, the bowl was the size of my head) but having the Thai Iced Tea at the end was great - wonderfully made, as well.\n\nDefinitely would come back here again!", "author": "Alessandra E."}

The food was tasty and well prepared, and the service and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  5 stars for the friendly wait staff and attention to service, and 4 stars for the food!  Plus, it's reasonably priced and affordable.\n\nFull review:\nFour of us came here last night for our monthly get dinner themed \"around the world\" and the letter for this month was V. It was my turn to chose the cuisine and restaurant, so I chose Vietnamese.  Since the local Vietnamese spots serving Dungeness crab are unable to serve crab currently because of the meat's high toxicity, I had to look for other options (I had originally made reservations at PPQ Dungeness). So I chose this spot, Ly's, since it got good reviews and was easy to access for everyone.\n\nLy's was a really good decision, and we all enjoyed it.\n\nWalking in, it was clear that it's a clean space. A member of the wait staff who welcomed us was very friendly and accommodating and sat us down for a 7pm reservation. I ordered the crab paste noodle soup, and it was delicious. I never had this super for,  and I was looking for something different and authentic, something that I never had before. I asked for fresh tofu instead of the typical fried tofu that comes with the dish, and the server was happy to make that change for me. I also got it with the extra meatball, even though the waitress had recommended getting it with chicken. But I had a lot of chicken yesterday, so a meatball was a nice change of pace. Next time I would definitely consider getting it with chicken - not of the meatball wasn't good, but because the friendly waitress said that was the best / most popular preparation.\n\nWe also ordered the spring rolls with pork, which were large and flavorful. Two of my friends the ordered garlic noodles with the filet mignon and with the five spice chicken, and I would definitely consider ordering those in the future. The beef was really tender and tasty, as was the chicken. The fourth member in our party ordered the shrimp, and it was okay.  The steamed broccoli that came with the garlic noodles was good, too.\n\nWe also had the sauteed string beans, which were bit salty but the flavor and texture were good.", "author": "Andrew D."}

All I can say is that for people who claim their dishes are flavorless, you obviously have been abusing your taste buds. That is a shortcut a lot of restaurants take - overdosing on sugar, salt, and spice so most likely, your taste buds have lost sensitivity.\n\nThe VEGETABLE PHO broth is insanely rich with a strong, smooth mushroom flavor and not your typical MSG-broth of cancer you get at a lot of asian restaurants. Did I just say a vegetable broth is RICH? Yes, arguably richer than the beef pho broth. Pho is really one of those hearty dishes for when you're sick or need to balance your diet. I had a fever and ate this to get my body going again and it did the job. \n\nI've also tried the BEEF PHO which was also really tasty and non-fatty/oily.

I would order this regularly as it's such a great execution of a classic, if I lived nearby (or even in the same city ha). \n\nVIETNAMESE COFFEE: pretty standard, but not from mix. \n\nAll in all, I think this is a no-shortcut Vietnamese restaurant with solid food and healthy options (just avoid the fried foods which is common sense.)", "author": "Ulla L."}

The fresh shrimp rolls were actually fresh and yums.\n\nThe staff is Cantonese speaking and they were really considerate in English and Chinese.

Noticeably absent is flank which I found weird but it's not a deal breaker.  The noodles are fine from all the times I've been there so nothing in particular to worry about.  The broth is where things are slightly different.  It's just a tinge off from the reference Pho flavor.

The priciest item on there was $4, and I pointed this out to my husband and said, \"You see this?  NEVER pay more than this for a Vietnamese sandwich.\"\n\nOf course I'm referring to made-for-the-inexperienced-or-unadventurous-American-palate (if your idea of Japanese food is chicken teriyaki and California rolls, and your idea of Chinese food is orange chicken, you fall into this category) places like Bun Mee and Saiwalks.  Both are more than double the price of what banh mis should cost, nor are they even remotely as good.  You could take an Uber to the TL and back to buy a banh mi, and it would still come out to be cheaper than a meal at either Bun Mee or Saiwalks!\n\nWhen Ly's opened, we were like, okay let's hope to god this place is better than Saiwalks.  The Marina has sorry representatives of Asian food, and we were excited to see what looked more like a hole-in-the-wall than a posh hip Chestnut street restaurant.\n\nLet's compare prices to Saiwalks:\n\nPho:\nSaiwalks - $12.  Ly's - $9.\n\nRolls (imperial, spring):\nSaiwalks - $9.  Ly's - $6.\n\nRice and/or vermicelli bowls/plates:\nSaiwalks - $13-14.  Ly's - $9-10 (unless you get the filet mignon, which is $13).\n\nI liked my chicken pho better than my husband's beef pho, but I also don't eat much beef so there's that.  Enjoyed the spring rolls, but wasn't a huge fan of the imperial rolls - the flavor was good, but the ground pork inside was too much.  Ly's also has garlic noodle plates, and though the garlic taste wasn't super heavy, it was good, and I packed mine away for lunch the next day.\n\nSize-wise, Ly's is a much heftier portion.  Their food is also WAY tastier and much more authentic than Saiwalks (which, IMHO, is a gigantic ripoff and not authentic.  It's like saying Taco Bell is real Mexican food).\n\nSeriously super happy this place opened!  There's FINALLY a good place to get a piping hot bowl of noodle soup on a cold foggy night, and there's FINALLY some AUTHENTIC Vietnamese food in the neighborhood!

Egg rolls were meh...pathetic actually; $7 for 3 rolls cut in half. Didn't serve it with the lettuce/mint/cucumber mix like most Vietnamese restaurants do. Garlic noodles with pork was the best dish. The noodles were on the drier side but still had flavor and I found myself eating more of this.

I typically expect to pay a bit less for Vietnamese food, but I suppose a price hike is to be expected in the Marina area. I got garlic noodles with pork and an imperial roll. My wife got the same but with vermicelli noodles (bun). The pork was flavorful and delicious. The garlic noodles were a nice texture but could've used a little more flavor. Both dishes were a good portion size with plenty of meat. I'd come back if I was in the area and hankering for Vietnamese food!", "author": "Laura B."}

Their menu was different from what we're use to in Boston, normally there is more options for beef pho but from what I can recall they only had prime beef and meatball?

Still feeling under the weather from Halloween festivities/ bender I was craving pho. Being the good yelper that I am I decided to venture out based on the reviews and try the Bun Rieu crab paste soup and OMGGGGGG so glad i did because I have a new favorite! This definitely hit the spot and was so flavorful, just wow. The broth is light yet filling and the meatballs have awesome juicy flavor, I loved the shallots or crunchy onions on top and the service was so nice and helpful.

(i don't know if there was any brisket in there now that i think about it.\n\ni'm one of those people who think cilantro tastes like soap (i've read some people are genetically disposed) so i was disappointed that i had to pick out the cilantro (you can't completely get rid of all the flavor once it's in there) and pick out the tendon. even though there wasn't much in terms of meat and tendon, all in all it was a large helping of good tasting pho.\n\nthe chicken was delicious although a few bits were overcooked. still worth getting again.\n\nvietnamese coffee was good but could've been watered down just a little since it was so sweet, although i know many people that would have said it's perfect.\n\ni would order from here again.", "author": "Leonard A."}

I was then presented with the stingiest amount I have ever seen. Meanwhile the table across from us received a far more generous garnish plate and they didn't even have to ask for it. the noodles were also in a giant clump sitting in the bowl.\n\n2)The summer rolls here are called spring rolls but they are wrapped in the rice wrappers, not deep fried. Mostly lettuce filled, not generous with the other ingredients. Might just be me but I prefer the ones with shrimp and a thin layer of pork.\n\n3)Between the rice with beef and the rice with filet mignon, the regular beef was actually more flavorful though thin sliced not cut into chunks.\n\ngood cheap eats.", "author": "S D."}

Great place, wonderful and friendly service and decent prices. \n\nThe first meal was the wing appetizers, GREAT and fresh spring rolls and papaya salad. YUMMY!\n\nI was back this week and tried the Pho / combo bowl. While not quite as good as other places I have tried, was very tasty and filling. \n\nThe place seems to be family run and the staff is very friendly. \n\nCheck it out, for sure!!", "author": "W M."}

Good flavor without being overpowered. Cafe sua da was okay. There was a bit of bitterness from the coffee the came through the mild sweetness from the condensed milk. I would come back without hesitation if I'm back in the area.", "author": "Earl M."}

It is some of the best I have had in San Fran (ok maybe the best). I don't understand how I got so lucky. Life changed.\n\nThe service was also very nice and the new owners are very enthusiastic :)", "author": "Laura S."}

Service was just ok and food was below my standards  for authentic  Vietnamese food. Was Luke warm and not very flavorful. Had to ask for more  water and even then waited a while. Maybe it's an off night, but we were sadly dissapointed.", "author": "Clyde C."}

Simple, clean room -- a bit stark for the Marina / Cow Hollow but what you really expect for a pho joint.", "author": "Matthew D."}

I had the vermicelli salad with pork. This is my usual back home. At Ly's it was amazing. The pork was tender and flavorful. We also had the crepe which we know as a pancake. It was more crispy than we are used to but again, delicious. Wish we lived closer.", "author": "Kimberly W."}

We waited for about 30 minutes for the waitress to come to our table. 4 people came after us and they were eating their food. We hadn't even ordered yet. I don't know why we were mistreated like that. We ended up leaving.", "author": "Carolina M."}

I usually call in orders to pick up and they're always so friendly and have my food ready to pick up in a timely matter. Their rare beef pho is really good with a good portion size and great price. This is my go to place for pho and I will continue to keep coming back here. Highly recommended for their friendly service and amazing pho!", "author": "Ericka C."}

Not within delivery range according to eat24, but called and they have no prob delivering, and people that answer the phone are great.  Fantastic five spice chicken and garlic noodles.  Angel wings are solid, and their pho is LEGIT, and surprisingly legit for delivery... you have to add all the ingredients to the broth, but they package it really well.  Meat and veggies fresh, broth VERY hot when it arrives.  Quickly became my go-to for Vietnamese delivery.. prices are excellent.  Need to to try spring rolls and shaking beef next-- I shall report back.", "author": "Chris M."}

I wanted to give this place a try seeing the high rating on Yelp and I was so disappointed.  Four of us ordered imperial roll, Crab paste noodle soup, garlic noodle with five spice chicken, rice with five spice chicken, and grilled shrimp pho.  The Crab paste noodle soup was just okay and vermicilli in it was over cooked.  The grilled shrimps came with the pho were puny, barely 2 inches long scattered sadly in the mostly empty plate.  The portion for the five spice chicken was small and tasted bland.  Then the imperial rolls!  the waiter delivered to the wrong table and did not realize until we asked (the restaurant was not busy at all).  We were almost done with our food when the rolls came and the outside was stale and inside was mushy.  I did not know that one can mess up Vietnamese comfort food this badly.  I don't understand why its rating is so high either. Perhaps they had a bad day when we visited.", "author": "Wes M."}

No frills, no \"vibe\", just a great big bowl of delicious Pho at a very good price.  I do veggie (which is NOT always that great) and they did not disappoint.

They also allowed combinations and changes to meals. My boyfriend has a severe peanut allergy and they were very informative of his options. It was very clean and the food arrived fairly quickly.

Quiet, not gaudy, robins egg colored chairs. We couldn't get ice for our drinks which seems to be a Cali problem, in RI you usually get too much ice! We ordered potstickers, nim chow(called something different here, the rice paper wrapped shrimp), beef pho, shrimp plate, beef plate, and shrimp paste soup. The beef pho was good, average; more than enough for two people. Potstickers were gently fried (I think) had a slight crust and were excellent. The nim chows were excellent, more complex than I get at home. The shrimp came with greens, rice and a fried egg. Looked great, I didn't get to try. My mother didn't eat much of her soup, but I think she got full. I ate it for a few days, the shrimp paste gave it a great depth of flavor. I also reheated my brothers beef strip plate, I think that was my favorite dish. If you are here and you only like traditional American Chinese food this is what you should order. The food was very 'clean' as I would call it, not greasy.", "author": "C M."}

We went as a party of four and each of us were delighted with our selections.   The spring rolls were fresh,  delicious and were served with a creamy peanut sauce.  The serving was generous, (4 ample rolls) and easily could be shared. The Vietnamese crepe was crispy and was filled with shrimp and pork served with a generous amount of fresh leaf lettuce for wrapping. It was delicious. The papaya salad was also a generous portion and was fresh and tasty . The vermicelli bowl with pork was my entree. My wife had the same thing only with shrimp. We were very pleased. Both entr\u00e9es were cool ,refreshing and served with a delicious fish oil dressing.. The wait staff were attentive,very eager to please and friendly. The waitress even insisted on bringing our table a sample of their signature dish which is garlic noodles. Oh, and did I mention the very reasonable prices? Our party of 4 ate our fill,took home doggie bags and our bill was under $80. Please do yourself a favor and try this restaurant.", "author": "Jim R."}
