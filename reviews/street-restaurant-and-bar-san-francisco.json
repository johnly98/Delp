It's a well-sized portion seared to perfection. The green beans, the mashed yukon potatoes and the aioli complement the ahi very well (although the three of these would have tasted wonderful even without the ahi).\n\nAhi was $23, calamari was $10.

We were passing by with a group of 12 this past weekend and we decided to give this place a try since it was the least packed restaurant in the area. I really liked the atmosphere and the mood lighting, however I wasn't really pleased with the service. The lady who greeted us by the door didn't seem like she was in the best of moods. We asked for a large table so that all of us could sit together and were told to wait at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was really weird. It would've probably been better if we were just told to wait outside for a couple minutes. \n\nAfter waiting for some time, we were seated and given menus. There weren't to many choices that caught my attention so I decided to go with a simple burger. I asked to get the Street burger without a bun, in other words, protein style, but for some reason, received just a patty with cheese and veggies on the side. I'm generally used to getting lettuce instead of the bun, but I guess their version is not the same. Anyway.... that was quite disappointing. I also tried some of the big salad with roast NY strip steak and it was very simple. I would expect there to be some more meat and veggies because the salad just felt empty. \n\nOverall I feel like things could've been better. From the moment we were told to wait at the back of the restaurant by the kitchen, I was not pleased. Service needs major improvement and so does the food preparation and quality. Not sure if I'd want to recommend this place to many people.", "author": "Julia K."}

I happened to have $25 in Restaurant.com credit, and Street Restaurant caught my eye, so it was settled. Needless to say, I was disappointed.\n\nFirst, the food. We ordered a variety of food, starting with the Brussel sprouts and wontons, both of which were recommended by our waitress. The wontons tasted like something I could have pulled from my freezer, boiled, and dunked in soy sauce. They were slightly undercooked and did not have a special \"Street Restaurant zing\" to them. The Brussel sprouts were flavorless, which was surprising, considering how much cheese and chili paste were thrown on them. It was the vegetable itself that was not infused with flavor.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the black truffle ravioli because it sounds amazing. It was also tasteless. I'm very stubborn about adding any salt or pepper to my food at restaurants, because I feel like it should already have sufficient seasoning... but I desperately needed salt to finish that dish. My boyfriend said I should include some constructive criticism about the food in my Yelp review, but that's really all I can say about it. The ribs that he ordered were saved by the spicy BBQ sauce they were marinated in but they, too, were dissatisfying.\n\nFor a restaurant that looks super upscale and classy, I was excited to try this new place, and I'm usually very forgiving. But we ordered quite a variety of food, and my experience with all the dishes was the same. I was especially looking forward to the peanut butter ice cream that I heard so much about, but I was not ready to be disappointed about DESSERT.\n\nI'm not sure why this place has so many high reviews, but I certainly will not be coming back here or recommending it.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

It was our default choice for that Friday night when you're in the mood for a little atmosphere and a good meal with alcohol, but were too busy during the week to make any plans. As walk-ins we usually ended up dining at the bar but that was just fine for our purpose.\n\nThen the one time we actually planned ahead and brought a few friends in, the experience was bad. The food was good as ever, but after we finished our entrees and DIDN'T order desserts they couldn't wait to get rid of us. We still had half a bottle of wine that we wanted to sit at our table and enjoy, but after the plates were cleared the hostess stopped by 3 times inside 10 minutes (this is no exaggeration) to ask if she could get us anything else. After the third no, we were asked to leave the table and finish our wine at the bar. I'm sorry, what?!?!? Unacceptable.\n\nAfter that, we didn't go back for two years, but recently have come back a few times, usually very improptu and based on friends' preferenes. And after all, we live nearby so it's convenient. I gotta say it's slipping. The appetizers and especially the steak entree used to be the best in the neighborhood, but the quality has stooped a bit. And apparently others have noticed this as well, becuase this formerly overbooked restaurant is now frequently half-empty.\n\nAs a basis for comparison I'd say 3 stars is reasoable, and that's without punishing them for that one horrible experience.

Tonight, my landlady took me out to dinner for the holidays.\n\nThey don't take reservations, so we took it upon ourselves to just stroll in around 7pm on a Tuesday. The place was moderately populated and we got a great table near the bar, far enough away from the front door to avoid the chill. In fact, I ordered a hot tea and the water was also lukewarm.\n\nThe service was general. Not particularly personal, not particularly neglectful.... util dessert was brought to the table, but more on that later.\n\nWe started off with the fried calamari app. My landlady immediately commented that the portion wasn't anywhere near what it used to be. It was also particularly lukewarm. In fact, all of the food lacked heat, like it sat a little too long on the kitchen counter before making it to the table.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the \"Big Salad\" with steak, medium well. This was basically a romaine salad with a creamy dressing. It wasn't big. Seriously, I'm not exactly a size queen, but if you're gonna call yourself \"Big\" make sure what you whip out measures up. This was a average sized dinner salad with avocado, radish and tomatoes. Now, this was a good salad, with a decent amount of meat and it definitely filled me up. I do feel like it could have had more lettuce and a larger presentation for little to no more cost.\n\nI also added a side of fries, and I have to say, Street makes my favorite kind of fries. The are large cut with the skins on, not large enough to be steak cut fries, think larger versions of In & Out. The right amount of crunch and meat.\n\nFor dessert we shared the bread pudding with caramel sauce and pecans. Delicious!\n\nHere's where the service tanked. Our dessert was delivered and we didn't see our server again for a long time. Now, this is not a large restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. 2 Servers work all of the tables in the joint. The service had been decent up till this point, but from the time we finished dessert to when we finally settled our bill, I could have solved Sunday's NY Times crossword puzzle....

I'd been coming in for dinners since they opened, years ago. She ordered a Fernat and I ordered a Mount Gay Rum over rocks. A nice bartender brought our drinks. I sipped my drink. It looked clear, like ice and water. My girlfriend said it was watered down. I knew it was ridiculously watered. She has been a bartender in San Francisco for 30 years. I agreed. I asked the bartender for a shot from the same bottle. There was no smell. We all drank it. It was 98 per cent... water. Definitely and very obviously watered down. So, the bartender opened a new bottle of Mount Gay at my request to pour a shot and compare to the watered down shot.(almost nothing left of the first watered bottle). Of course this was the real deal rum I should be paying for. My girlfriend said to me that she thought the owner/chef was watching us in a weird way. I'd noticed this, as well. I asked the bartender if I could take the near empty watered down bottle to the owner/chef as I thought he would surely want to know and surely see that I was trying to do him a favor, especially as he is the owner of Street. I'D put a credit card on the bar. I walked up to the open kitchen counter where the owner cooks. I politely said hi and how are you etc and said I thought he should know that the bottle of rum I placed on the counter was watered down and he might want to take a swig of what was left of the bottle. He looked at the bartender and said, \"has he paid yet...?\" She replied 'no, not yet'. He told her to cancel it. He then looked at me and said, \"get the f... outta and don't come back...\"  Holyeeeeeeee mackerel. I couldn't believe his response. If I was the owner I would have not only wanted to know his booze was being watered down, but, I would have thanked me and taken a sip of that bottle. I started walking and turned around at the end of the bar and looked at him in  disbelief and disgust... He repeated, \"get outta here\". He then something like he was coming over the counter and get me. I left. It was his turf. \nA very bizarre experience at Street... the most  bizarre experience in my 40 years in this great city.\n\n I should have called the police.", "author": "John J."}

However it was really cold still so I had to keep my coat on. \n\nLuckily the table for four was not cramped and tiny and we did have a lot of room at the table. Good service overall - the waitress was very friendly and happy to give her recommendations. \n\nMy boyfriend and I weren't too hungry after coming from Amelie and having lots of tapas there so were shared the seasonal smoked turkey black eyed pea soup and an entree. It was very hearty and flavorful - hint of spice after taste that lingered. Kind of pricey for a small serving of soup though ($9)\n\nFor our main we had the Grilled Hawaiian Ahi Tuna which was yummy but not exceedingly remarkable. The fish was grilled nicely, the mashed potatoes were especially garlicky and textured (which I like) and the green beans were not too overcooked. It was a lovely meal and presentation but not a lot of food. \n\nOur friends got the fried calamari and the shrimp linguine but I'm allergic to shellfish and did not try those dishes.

In a city of coffee lovers, er...addicts, I wonder how they've not had a mutiny already. Anyway to the rest of the experience.\n\nI ordered the New York Steak with steak-cut fries.

We definitely wouldn't have minded paying for a $13 glass of wine if it was good, which this wine was not.  \n\nAnother block later, Street became a 2.5 star restaurant.

The hostess quickly tracked us down and offered us seating at the bar, if we didn't want to wait the whole time. We took her up on this offer because it was arctic outside and we aren't polar bears.\n\nSitting at the bar was a great experience because we really got to chat with our server, Monica and get her recommendations about what to eat. Monica recommended the mac and cheese with the Callabrian peppers. We got that along with the spicy hummus plate. Both of these dishes were very good, but not mind-blowing. The mac and cheese had great flavor and the peppers are really like hot sauce. The spicy hummus was a good hummus with nice sides like roasted eggplant, olives and tomatoes.\n\nFor my main course, I had the sweet corn risotto with tomatoes and rainbow chard. It was amazing. The risotto was perfectly cooked and the chef managed to really highlight each component so there was a really nice balance between everything. 10/10, would eat again. My friends had the crab cakes, the burger and the bolognese. I tried the fries from the burger and they were amazing. Super thick cut fries, but really crisp -- a feat rarely accomplished. Everyone loved their dishes.\n\nI would rate the food as being very good, but the service from Monica really set the experience over the top.

It was a little past 9:30PM when we arrived and the waitress informed us (kindly I must add) that the kitchen was closing up in about 15 minutes (closes on Thursday's at 10PM) but never hassled us about choosing quickly like they do at many restaurants.  Everything was very prompt and yet amazing!  I was sure that the food was \"iffy\" because it arrived so quickly after our rather tasty Martinis.  My boyfriend had a regular Lime Martini while I had the Fig, which was rather delicious.  It made me remember why I love Martinis so much.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious.  He ordered a pasta dish with large pasta noodles and pork, beef, and mushrooms.  I ordered a burger since I wasn't in the mood for the NY Steak I'll be ordering next time.  I have to say, I've had a lot of burgers in my life and this was easily top 5.  I'm sure it was partially because of the perfectly toasted bun but mostly it was the meat.  It felt like every bite I took, two more bites worth of hamburger showed up.  It didn't look as big as it tasted!  Does that make sense?  Anyway, I actually couldn't finish it!  I pushed it, as well.  I was full about 5 minutes before I gave up.  The salad was huge too.  It was fantastic portions for one place!\n\nPricing was fantastic for location.\n\nOh yes, the ambiance!  It was small, which made it nice and casual and not a lot of conversations you feel like you have to scream over.  The art on the wall was fantastic mixed-media on canvasses.  They had a theme that showed a lot about the artist.  They didn't have signatures so I have an idea that someone who works there created them.\n\nThis may sound funny to you but there was a red light that panned the very front of the place on top of the door.  It was small but it projected a slightly red glow over us and our table and was oddly soothing.  The lighting was rather low other than that but I'm a fan of dim lighting so was definitely happy about that.\n\nI truly felt like I was in a cute, nice but casual, out-of-the-way restaurant in a big (although may seem small in diameter) city.  I love living here and this place just added to that.\n\nOh, sadly one detail that I forgot to mention--I don't know if their heater was broken or if it was just so chilly outside that it was on but you couldn't feel it.  Like I mentioned, it's a cozy, small venue so when the door opens and it's cold outside, a big breeze is going to take over for a second but either way it was slightly uncomfortable from time-to-time.  Dress warmly in the evening.\n\nWell, my novel of a review now comes to a close.  I don't know if Street is consistently as great as last night or if others will find it as enjoyable as I did.

We arrived at six when food service began and got right in, but the place filled up fast\n-Definitely have a cocktail or two(or three, no judgement), the drink menu is a mix of classic and modern drinks. The sparkle barbie (complete with a colored sugar rim made to look like sparkles) and the yellowtail were among our group favorites\n-the dinner menu changes a bit nightly. I had the burger and my wife had the tagliatelle bolognese, the burger was perfectly cooked,  juicy and full of flavor. The handmade tagliatelle was perfectly al dente nestled in a tasty bolognese sauce\n-Service was slow, but in a good way. The waitress was attentive and we felt comfortable.\n-the desserts were perfect. The desserts earned this place their 5 rating. All made in house and all equally delicious.

It was perfect. Baked thick rice swimming in fresh hot cream sauce - with thick amazingly sweet skin of slightly browned cream on the top.  \n\nWhen we used to make the trip back to Wales to see our grandparents - it was the first thing I'd ask my grandmother about on the phone. I was obsessed with that stuff. Still haven't found anything quite as good.\n\nThat rice pudding - stirred on my fascination with comfort desserts like bread pudding (my mom makes a mean one. Mostly cause she doesn't really believe in recipes and like to improvise)\n\nSo when I read about the bread pudding here - I knew I had to try Street.\n\nStreet doesn't disappoint on all fronts. The food is well done. The food portions are great. The prices are reasonable, considering the presentation and quality of the food. The ambiance is edgy and sexy, but strangely - still warm and inviting.\n\nI wasn't wowed over by my ahi fish dish - but my dining companion's egg noodle pasta dish with the ideal amount of cream sauce - was incredible and undeniably one of the best entree choices on the menu.\n\nAnd looking around us - as plate, after plate of lightly browned fried chicken made their way to all of the tables around us - I suspect the fried chicken may even be the Ace of the place.\n\nBut to get to my favorite part of any meal and every review - dessert.\n\nThree words for you:\n\ndo bread-pudding here. (let's consider bread pudding one word to make this sentence more more poignant)\n\nStreet's Def. of Bread Pudding: A beautifully formed and textured cake of soft sweetness - sitting pretty on top of a nutty toffee sauce, and dressed lightly with just whipped cream sauce.\n\nTrying to find words to accurately capture it's borderline divine nature - is hard.\n\nCheck out Street. They don't take reservations, but if you're a small party you should be fine. Try their pasta or fried chicken, and go for the bread pudding. Maybe even come here just for a drink and some bread pudding.\n\nRevisit a favorite childhood dessert done right. And then some.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

It's tight up in there, but dark enough so that you don't feel like you're shoulder to shoulder with everyone else (even though you are). \n\nThe menu offerings drift to the new American comfort food side of the street, with solid burger and fried chicken dishes alongside international comfort food faves like gnocchi with a house-made sausage. I opted for the house-made egg noodle dish in a light cream sauce with some sort of nuts and spinach. This came after a starter of a goat cheese custard with greens. Both dishes were fantastic, which was to be expected as they were recommendations of the server. The creamy noodles dish was light and complex, definitely creamy but not too rich. The spinach cut the richness nicely and added a solid green flavor to the dish. The goat cheese souffle was warm and delicious. \n\nDinner was followed by an amazing pecan bread pudding with pecan sauce and a meyer lemon cheesecake. While the cheesecake was tasty, the bread pudding definitely stole the show. Imagine a delicious (and very consistent in texture) bread pudding mixed with a pecan pie. Delicious. \n\nPair this good environment with tasty food and very reasonable prices (in the $10-$18 range), and you have a winner.

Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to its rep for me.  \n\nWe arrived, around 9pm on a Friday night, and there was no visible hostess desk, and nobody greeted us, so we just kind of wandered through the restaurant to the bar where some waitresses were standing.

After a few minutes of waiting by the kitchen, we were seated, but not before overhearing the cooks say there was one pork loin left (which is the reason I chose the restaurant!). \n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter came over, without introducing himself, and quickly took our order. And when I say quickly, I'm talking lightning speed.  There was no polite conversation or listing of specials or anything! Definitely the service thus far was not impressive- but I did get the pork loin!\n\nThe server came back after to get our drinks (we wanted to put in my order so I could get the last one) and I got some wine, and my boyfriend got a beer. My wine came out relatively quickly (though we still did not have water) and then the beer did not follow for at least 5 minutes, which was annoying. \n\nThe only thing that saved this place was its food.The pork loin was amazing, and my boyfriend's burger was one of the best I've tasted in a while.

And most importantly, I did not appreciate a crab and fettucine dish completely devoid of developed flavors.\n\nFrom what I read, the burger might be the best thing on their menu, but rather than experience another bout of abominable service, I will just mosey on over to Polker's Gourmet Burgers instead.", "author": "Nick W."}

I ordered the prosecco, and when it came time to ask for another glass, it took a while to arrive.  The waitress brought it over and explained that this second glass was on the house because they were out of the original one I had been drinking and had to find a replacement and it took longer than it should have.

However, while the Street burger was merely good, Magnolia's Prather Ranch burger was divine.  Street struggled as so many places do with their definition of \"medium-rare\", but it wasn't way off.

I looked at their menu on Yelp and on-line and ordered the Wild Prawn Risotto (for $17.25). \nFrom Street's website:\nrisotto wild white prawns, red chard, basil, reggiano and truffle oil 17.25 \n\nWith tax and the $10 drink I ordered while I waited for my order plus a generous 25% tip, I was out $38. The bartender was really nice so I didn't mind the tip. I got home, opened the box to find a total of zero shrimp! I called the restaurant - a girl answered and I explained the situation - she asked if I ordered online and I said \"No, I called the restaurant and ordered the wild prawn risotto\". She said that the risotto didn't have any prawns in it but that I could come in the next day and talk to the manager to get a refund.\n\nI wasn't able to go to Street the next day so I went tonight. I asked for the manager and was directed to John, the owner. I explained the situation  to him and I have to say that I was less than satisfied. This is what he told me:\n1. Their menu changes everyday - I honestly haven't seen any evidence of this.\n2. The girl on the phone who took my order for Wild Prawn Risotto must have only heard Risotto so she didn't bother to let me know that the risotto just had a couple of cherry tomatoes in it.\n3. They can serve risotto with prawns but that would be WAY MORE expensive - closer to $27! I'd like Yelpers to look at my photo and decide if that looks like a $27 dish, especially with tiny 60-count shrimp, not wild prawn...\n4. When I pointed out that their website had the prawn risotto for $17.25, John told me that the website hadn't been updated in 9 years and that they were a neighborhood restaurant that doesn't bother with the website - take the website down then, John!!\n5. John asked if I'd like my dish made again, with \"prawns\" and comped the dish.\n6.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-25", "description": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while, specifically for their fried chicken.  I didn't know it is only served on Sunday.  After failed visit due to menu or crowds, we finally made it in yesterday.  It really was fate because right when I said to hubby, we'll eat at Street if we can find a space...guess what?  Yup, a space right in front - on a weeknight around 7:30pm?  \n\nThe place was not busy.  Few people at the bar and few table for 2s and 4s.  The interior is a lot smaller than we expected but it's nice - holds 30 or so total?  Quite dark inside w/ dark red walls and lots of abstract looking artwork.  Lighting is what we call \"ambiance\" lighting but to us older folks, reading the menu becomes a squinting challenge.  \n\nSimple one page menu but it took us a while to debate our options.  The drinks menu was 1 page but front/back with wine selection by the glass, draft and bottled beer and a list of cocktails.  Hubby wants a cold beer (Anchor Steam - $5) so I opted to try their Sangria ($6).  The sangria was served in a pint glass with ice and a paper umbrella - it was on the sweet side but quench the thirst.\n\nWe shared the spinach salad ($8.75) and that was a good thing because it was a generous portion, I could have had that for an entree on a hot day.  It was very good, just the right amount of dressing w/o over drenching.  The bacon pieces were a nice treat and compliment to the spinach.  The red beets were sweet and refreshing.  Loved every bite of the salad.  Off to a good start...\n\nHubby had the rack of lamb ($19.75), I think it's really his default if it's on the menu.  It was the special of the evening.  The plate came with 3 pieces w/ mashed potato and green beans.  The chops were cooked as requested - medium rare.  The sight of the redish pink sure puts a smile on our faces.  It looked so good that I made hubby cut a small piece for me before he got a bite and before I dug into mine.  It was good even though it's on the lean side - there was no fat, not even near the bone but it was still very tender.  The sauce, however, was way too sweet -  it tasted like the sweet chili sauce you get from Asian markets.  Did not like the sauce at all.  The mashed potato was thick and buttery.  \n\nI had the pasta w/ crab and homemade spicy sausage ($19.75) - it was also the special.  I'm so glad our waitress, Rachell, recommended it since I was debating among that, the crab and shrimp cakes or the risotto.  The fettuccine was damn good, al-dente!  The texture of the pasta was very good so I had to ask the waitress if it was made there and sure enough it was.  The cream sauce was light and flavorful.  The spicy sausage had a nice kick to it and it really went well w/ the more subtle flavor of the crab.  They must have sprinkled some cheese on top and lightly baked it because the little bit of crispiness was divine!  They should add this to their regular menu!\n\nSimple dessert menu with 6 choices?  The coconut panna cotta sounded interesting but the peanut butter ice cream w/ some kind of meringe and stuff sure sounded tasty.  Bread pudding ($5.75) wasn't really considered but our waitress raves about it - people who don't like bread pudding likes it...she'll buy it for us if we didn't like it.  How can you say no to that?  Well, I didn't like it - I thought it was too dense and dry although the dryness can easily be masked w/ the creamy caramel sauce or the whipped cream, which my hubby loved (the sauce and the cream).  \n\nIt was a wonderful dinner, just didn't end on a high note.

Since they don't take reservations, we planned ahead and came early on Saturday night at about 6:30 and there was no wait for a table of 4. \n\nWe started with the calamari to share, which was good. I ordered the lemon basil martini which was alright. The real cocktail winner in my book is the apripolitan, with apricot flavored vodka and even a dried apricot inside the drink to eat afterwards. It's sweet but not overly sweet, love it. \n\nFor my entree, I went with what I have had here before, the grilled ahi tuna. This is so good and is served  with an aoili on top, over mashed potatoes  and green beans. My friend had the crab cakes, which I've also had before and are delightfully tasty -of course I had a bite of my friends dish :) Both boys had the steak, which from the bite I tasted was very good. I also stole a few fries. I think overall you can't really go wrong with anything you order here.\n\nThe ambiance is nice. We had the high table right in the front, so it was fairly private and made for easy conversation. The lighting is a little dark and funky red colored but I think it adds to the ambiance. I usually stray from American food but Street is the exception. The food is fantastic and I am reminded of this everytime I come. I would definitely recommend it for a date night or an intimate, but fun, dinner for groups of less than 4.", "author": "Carolyn K."}

Everything tasted so good. Starting with the cocktails, all housemade and unique. Something for every palate. Followed by pork belly sliders. The bomb. Good thing there were only two, otherwise I would have eaten a dozen. The accompanying arugula and watermelon salad offset the richness of the pork belly. Had the pasta. House made. Bolognese. So tasty. Followed by the peanut butter ice cream. Take all of your yummiest foods - many of them the things we ate as kids - turn them up a notch. Add a hefty dose of deliciousness and that is Street. Really. Stop here. Eat often. GREAT place. And reasonably priced. Why go anywhere else for a tasty meal?

This fried chicken review echos BOTH of our sentiments as to ALL the places we've taste tested (but I'm quoting him for the most part):\n\nWe've had fried chicken from various places.  Chicken n' Waffles was okay; then you've got your run of the mill fast food joints like KFC, Meh, not bad; Popeyes, YUCK; Church's, Double Yuck.  \n\nWe've also had fried chicken attempted at a home and although the effort was commendable, Hubby thought the chicken turned out too dry (even the dark meat) and over-seasoned.  DH prefers white meat and he stated that it was drier than the dark meat, and thus he was relegated to dark meat for whatever moistness was left.  So getting fried chicken cooked perfectly is very difficult.\n\nStreet took all the mistakes from all these various places and rectified them into succulent pieces of finger lickin' fried chicken deliciousness.

It's important to get there early to beat the crowd and to make sure they don't run out of the yummy fried chicken. :-) The interior is kind of dark with some art work on the walls and  new country music plays in the background.  I wish they were playing the \"Chicken Fried\" song by Zac Brown Band because that would be so fitting. The restaurant space is a bit narrow, tight and long. The vibe I get is a hip modern contemporary feel. Friendly servers. When I was served the fried chicken (4 pieces) it was still hot and the meat was very tender and had good flavor. It also came with coleslaw, corn off the cob, mash potatoes with gravy and their moist cornbread. I totally cleaned up my plate and ate everything. Surprisingly I was pretty filled up. Then i saw the dessert menu and the Peanut Butter Ice Cream caught my eye. Now that's something I don't see too often, so I had to order that. That peanut butter ice cream has caramel sauce, whipped cream, peanuts, and a big meringue cookie. The peanut butter flavor was light, but when I ate the ice cream with the peanut, then the full flavor of the peanut butter came out. The Meringue cookie was also pretty light and not too sticky. So everything was pretty delicious.  However,  on a side note, unless you are a bread pudding fan, then I guess you would enjoy the bread pudding.

I think all of the canvasses were depicting Rocking Chairs on a porch. Anyway, we got a table right away and the waitress took our coats for us, a very rare nicety.\n\nThe menu was complete for a \"American (New)\" category, which is hard to come by. I had a cranberry and vodka, super watered down. \n\nDinner was perfect. I had a NY Strip, he had a some sort of pasta with sausage. Both were amazing. My steak was large, juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked. The gorgonzola butter is to die for. Literally, if I ate enough, my arteries would clog. At least I'd die happy. Dessert was also amazing (Chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, a classic done right).\n\nAfter Yom Kippur (we Jews are supposed to fast for 25 hours), I know where I'm having my first meal.", "author": "Benjamin B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-06-12", "description": "Like Annie S's review, my review unfortunately won't be too complimentary. I came here last night with two friends hoping to do the dine about town special. The first problem (and it was trivial) was that you couldn't make reservations, since the restaurant is first come first serve. No biggie. We arrived at 6:30 and there were tables.\n\nThe women who sat us wasn't too friendly or warm, but we got the prime window table with a nice open view of the street. The DAT menu is supposed to encourage you to try a bit of everything so you save money. The most expensive appetizer is $9. The most expensive entree is $25. And the dessert's around $5.75. So even if I chose the most expensive of each, it would be $40 - not much of a savings at $34.95. And then get this: the Angus steak, the dish I came for, was NOT on the DAT menu. I know it says \"subject to change\" but their DAT website lists their menu as follows:\n\n(Sample Menu (Three-Course Prix Fixe)\nMenu items subject to change, contact restaurant directly for their most current Dine About Town menu.\n\n    First Course\n    crispy pork belly, warm lentil salad, grain mustard vinaigrette\n    or\n    souffleed goat cheese custard, mixed lettuces, tapenade crouton\n\n    Second Course\n    angus new york strip steak, ancho cress, mountain gorgonzola butter, kennebec fries\n    or\n    risotto, wild white prawns, red chard, saffron, basil, grana padano, truffle oil\n\n    Third Course\n    buttermilk panna cotta, raspberry coulis, toasted almond biscotti\n    or\n    bread pudding, dates, pecans, bourbon-caramel sauce \n\nSigh. So we decided to go with a few drinks, two split appetizers, one soup for me, three entrees and a dessert. The food quality was actually quite good. The linguini with steak was delicious - and should have been an entree. The pork & shrimp wontons with a soy ginger splash was ridiculously overpriced and could have been the $1 (total) wontons at any Chinese restaurant. Charging $7 for that was obscene. The tomato wasn't too creamy - but this was a good thing. Hearty and tasty, the soup was a bit spicy too - something unexpected by enjoyable.\n\nMy friends both had the ahi and they liked it. I had the ground sirloin burger with avocado, grilled onions, and gruyere. DAAAAANG. Now THAT was a burger. Lightly grilled bun which turned perfect golden brown, creamy avocado sliced into a nice wedge. Wow. \n\nThe dessert was a peanut butter ice cream that was also outstanding. \n\nIn the end, I paid $50 for a cocktail, my share of appetizers, soup, burger, fries, and ice cream plus tax and tip. Seems like an awful lot, though, doesn't it?", "author": "Aaron F."}

As soon as she approached the table we felt the chill that appeared to be from someone who did not want to be there at all that night. No engagement, no real concern about whether or not we wanted another drink or if we even enjoyed our meals. I asked her to \"course out\" our meals since we were having three appetizers and two entrees. I assumed she knew what we were asking but low and behold, the apps just started flying to our table. \n\n  I sat with an empty cocktaili glass for over ten minutes and actually flagged down another server to order me a drink because our server seemed pre-occupied by whatever was outside, her friend at the bar and with her busser which just seemed odd. \n  \n  What is a true bummer is the food was pretty good except for the soup which I would invite their cooks to my kitchen to give them a course on how to skim fat off the top of their soups because 30% of was chicken fat and not very appealing.

Tonight I was craving fried chicken and when my dining companion canceled I decided to forgo Farmerbrown and Front Porch and fly solo at Street. Usually I'm all about the burger at Street but since I was already in the fried chicken mood and it was Sunday (chicken night at Street) I knew that that was the way to go. \n\nAnd I'm so glad that I did! The chicken was uber-yummy and had all kinds of sides-mashed potatoes with gravy, corn, cole slaw and a slice of cornbread. But the star of the evening was the chicken. Nicely breaded and seasoned perfectly - I thought for sure I'd only eat two of the four pieces but ended up finishing the entire plate.  \n\nAnd if that's not enough, I had dessert. Home made peanut butter ice cream, with caramel sauce, chocolate, peanuts, home made whipped creme and meringue. This dessert was like heaven on a plate.  Again, I licked the plate clean when I should have stopped after a couple of bites.  \n\nBut now I'm left with a dilemma - do I go to Street for one of the best burgers in the city or for some tasty fried chicken?

The idea was to find the best street foods from all over the world and create a simple, delicious, carbohydrate and  sugar heavy menu of comfort foods that, being international, would avoid the dullness and predictability of a diner, chain restaurant or burger joint*. It turned out people want their comfort food to be mostly familiar so the model changed to focus more on American cuisine, but John and Lynne, the talented and hardworking owners of Street, have achieved their goal. Street offers a warm and filling dinning experience in a friendly but sophisticated and attentive atmosphere.  Their sign promises Strong Food, Real Drinks and they mean it. \n\nTables are small, closely packed and often noisy. That makes Street a great place to establish a feeling of intimacy without having to talk too much or work hard. Hello first date, informal work group gathering or neighborhood place to hang with your significant other. Not so much a good place for working dinners, communications heavy third dates or for anyone claustrophobic, or overly noise or privacy sensitive.\n\nDrinks include a range of vodka infusions (fig, apricot, and cranberry are three of my favorites), wonderful mojitos, and a full but reasonably priced wine list. The bartenders are often hot and always know how to rock 'n roll. Name the poison, you won't be disappointed in the dose.\n\nStreet french fries have won best in the city, and with good reason. Cooked using  a double fry process (I asked) they are remarkably crisp and flavorful. My wife and I often split a bowl as an appetizer. The fried chicken (Sunday only.. except when they have some on Tuesday, and spring for the extra piece of cornbread) is wonderful, as is the hamburger and the  homemade peanut butter ice cream (they tend to run out so think about ordering at the start of the meal).  If you are in the mood for a light dinner, try splitting an order of the spicy humus and one of spinach salad or mixed greens.\n\nExpect the bill for two to be around $85 with drinks, desert and tip. To avoid the worst of the crowds try to come before 7:00 or after 9:00. No reservations except on Valentines's day but waits of more than 20 minutes are rare, and the full menu is also served at the bar.\n\nI believe that on the good-to-bad scale, nuclear weapons tend to be near the bad side.  But  if real neutron bombs were as comfortable as Street I just might change my mind.\n\n\n\n\n---\n*my understanding based on a slightly drunk conversation.

It adds an element of fun to your meal. So when I showed up here with my good buddy Manny we decided to take a seat at the bar. We ended up becoming great friends with our bartender/server Amy. Seriously, she rocked from the beginning to the fuzzy end. She dropped good knowledge on the cocktails she made. She also gave us samples of her favorite tequilas (Casadores brand), Armagnac VSOP (a brandy), and some of the house infused cucumber vodka (quite refreshing). We took a shot of the house infused habanero vodka with her which was a great eye opener.\n\nAs for the meal itself I'm pleasantly surprised to say it was the best steak I've had in a while. We both had the started with the Asparagus Soup and had the Angus New York Strip Steak with a pat of Mountain Gorgonzola Butter and Kennebec Fries. The steak came out perfectly seared with a medium rare cook. It had all the qualities of a great steak: tender, juicy, and flavorful. The gorgonzola butter was a nice accent to the steak that just put it over the top. Talk about a foodgasm! They certainly live up to their tag line, \"Strong Food, Real Drinks.\"\n\nMUST HAVE: The steak and anything Amy says is good. She's a top notch bartender.", "author": "Al L."}

I forgot to get the cross streets for the place and phoned in after our movie and ended up putting my name down for a table before we got there.

We also ordered drinks and appetizers\n\nI went safe and got a beer while the gf got the \"Cherry Soda\".  The beer was pretty generous, enough for my Asian tolerance.  The Cherry Soda, however, was probably the most disappointing of the whole Street experience.  It didn't taste like Cherry or er... Soda.  It had no flavor and I ended up drinking it for her while she just ordered a Shirley Temple.\n\nThe appetizers were pretty good.  All I got was the cup of clam chowder and it was REAL good, great clam flavor.  My gf got a salad with pecans, cheese and apple slices; very nice.  Then the real food came.  The burger was nice, BIG and JUICY.  I asked for mayo and then ended up getting some ketchup as well.  I didn't get fries because the steak came with fries so I just stole those.  The steak was cooked sorta medium rare but I like it even better like that, and my gf didn't mind.  It tasted very good as well.

If you're not currently obsessed with crabcakes like me, don't worry - in my experience you really can't go wrong here, especially with the calamari appetizer, or, another favorite, sangria (their version, with a healthy dose of cinnamon, is more than serviceable).

The bottle of Seghesio zinfandel didn't hurt, the atmosphere was warm and mellow, and the service was spot on.\n\nHowever, my husband and our friend weren't as impressed. They both ordered the sausage with gnocchi, which sounds great, right? It could have been, but the gnocchi was just off. It wasn't the right texture.

If it were my meal that was just okay (instead of my husband's), I would have probably rounded down. The desserts could have also tipped the scale, but while they were pretty good, they were not amazing. Same goes for the pate appetizer. What is making me round up was the overall dollar per unit of meal-pleasure. For a bottle of wine, an appetizer, three entrees, two desserts, and a bottle of wine, we came in at about $110.

Not really sure but I am in love.  \n\nAs a person that hasn't eaten fried chicken since childhood, I was intrigued by the promise of skin-free, fried poultry.  I'm from the southeast and my 'issues' with fried chicken having skin and bones to negotiate, made me a freakshow amongst my friends and family. Pretty much, if it reminds me of a once living creature, I can't eat it.  As such, I've steered clear of fried chicken for I don't know, oh at least 15 years or so.\n\nThe fried chicken at Street is impressive.  I don't know how they get the breading to stick to skinless chicken but they do.  It makes for perfectly fried and perfectly moist chicken. I even ate it off the bone.  That's right.  This chicken caused me to have a gastronomical breakthrough.  I wasn't snapping bones and sucking marrow but I feel a little pleased with myself that I took the leap.  It was the chicken, not me.\n\nDrinks were great.  I had the apripolitan and my friend had the fig martini.  Both were well-proportioned, not too sweet and perfect for sipping throughout dinner.    \n\nAlso loved the cornbread.  It was moist and still had chunks of corn kernels mixed into the bready goodness.  We finished off dinner with the apple cake and caramel sauce.  It was delicious and the caramel was homemade buttery yumminess. \n\nYou can't go wrong at Street and I look forward to returning for a sampling of the rest of their menu.  I do love burgers (boneless, skinless and not at all reminiscent of its previous form).  \n\nOh...and go before 7pm or after 9pm to get a table without having too much of a wait.  Seating is first come basis only.  Drinks start at 5:30pm, dinner at 6:00pm.", "author": "Corey F."}

At first, I was alone at the bar waiting for my friends to arrive - I was surrounded by the delightful smell of fried chicken and received food recommendations from a very friendly and nice bartender (Sara, I think was her name).  I watched her pour what seemed to be strong drinks with the many different kinds of infused vodka's. I didn't try one though, I was enjoying the Viognier.\n\nOnce my friend arrived, we tried the potato and leek soup - it was wonderful, and no cream! I love soups without cream (for health reasons primarily). So far, the experience was top notch. The music was great, there were fun people - oh but the bar stools, my friend and I thought we were going to fall of the barstools!\n\nOnce we moved to a table and my third friend arrived, we noticed the chairs were a bit more comfortable but not worthy of a compliment. Our waitress recommended a wonderful red wine; that's about the only thing she did correctly. Our bunless burgers arrived without the cheese we had ordered; the plates promptly returned with half melted cheese on the burgers - the cheese was sweating. It was not appealing, but the beautifully fanned avocado was so I dove in. The burger was good, arrived medium rare as requested. It took the waitress a few reminders to bring onions for my friend, but she continued to eat her burger anyway so that was lame.\n\nMy friend who didn't have the bunless burger ordered the dumplings (YUM!) and a caeser salad which I didn't try. I chose to do that by the look on her face. She wasn't pleased.\n\nAll in all, I think I would go back and give the spot another try.  I liked the vibe, and an eager to try the infused vodka's. Perhaps I'll bring my man this time around and get his perspective. Perhaps I'll remember my helmet so if I do infact fall off the barstool, my head will be protected.", "author": "Iliana T."}

By the time we got there, there was a table nicely waiting for us.  The hostess was very nice and pulled out the table so I could get in, since all the tables were in a tight spot.\n\nChecked out their drinks menu and decided to get the Cherry Soda, definitely very disappointing, since it didn't taste like what the name indicated.  The beer my bf ordered was nice and generous.\n\nFor appetizers, I got a garden salad, which came with fresh greens, gorgonzola cheese, apples, and candied walnuts.  Everything was very well put together, just enough salad to get me started and just the right combinations of flavors for a tangy yet sweet taste.  The clam chowder we got was also very tasty, tasted like clams.\n\nI ordered my steak Medium and it came a little more Medium Rare but that turned out okay since I always anticipate Medium to be cooked more than it should.  The steak was awesome, juicy, and meaty, just the way I like my steak.  The adjacent tables to us all had people enjoying the yummy steaks, so Street must've been doing something right.\n\nWe were too stuffed to have dessert, that and I'm just not a huge dessert person, so it's never a must have for me.\n\nOverall, service was good, food was AWESOME and prices were VERY reasonable.

If so, I have three words for you: house-made ginger ale.\n\nI needed to choose a nicer restaurant on Polk street, as a family friend wanted to take us out to dinner Sunday night. I had heard good things about Street so we ventured there. The four of us walked in around 7pm and seated ourselves at a table right near the front of the restaurant. Nice and dark inside-- just how I like it when I'm tired from a long weekend.\n\nOur waitress couldn't have been nicer. You could tell she just wanted to share in the excitement of the tasty food. As promised, I ordered the house-made ginger ale. We all ordered entrees (I got the pappardelle and the man-friend got the steak) and then our friend ordered two appetizers for everyone to share. \n\nThe fritters were light and fluffy, perfectly done, with little morsels of sweet corn scattered inside. The ranch dressing they were served with wasn't life-changing, but it was a nice cool dressing for the hot fritters. I will probably go back to Street just for those fritters.\n\nThe hummus plate was lovely. Chunky, fresh hummus on a platter with a few pita slices, olives, and cherry tomatoes. \n\nMy pappardelle was great. I never order pasta at restaurants-- something about wanting to eat well-cooked meat when I can, because let's be honest, I'm no cook-- but I asked the waitress to recommend something light and tasty. This was the perfect rec! There was a good amount of pasta and fresh tomatoes. Not too heavy, definitely filling, and very fresh-tasting. \n\nWe were all beat so we didn't make room for dessert. Also good to note: Street does not have an espresso machine, so if you're craving an after-dinner pick-me-up, you'll have to settle for coffee. \n\nA great, local place for an easy, tasty meal. Not the cheapest joint in town, but I would say worth it. (Especially when someone else is paying.) I hear the drinks are outstanding, so take note that I'll be back.

So when someone suggested I check out Russian Hill it was off to a great start already.\n\nOn to what you really want to know about Street. \n\nAtmosphere:\nCozy little space perfect for \"small\" groups (there were only 3 of us) dimly lit with a cute little bar towards the back of the restaurant. The decor itself is pretty nondescript kinda modern artwork Scandinavian style tables. \n\nService:\nKick ass bartender. The wine list was a little short but the cocktails looked really unique.

For an appetizer I ordered the goat cheese souffle split between the 3 of us was a tantalizing start to the meal.  Followed by the yellow fin tuna grilled just enough on the outside the flavor was delish. There was a side of creamy mashed potatoes and green beans that were equally yummy.

The magical little destination, Street, looked busier and busier with every passing-by of their window as we grew weary and hungry.   We were pretty sure we would not be able to get in, or if we did, it would be a looonng wait. It WAS Saturday night and we were on minute 44 of the hunt.  It was not a good sitch in the car with three Starvin Marvins dying for a drink.\n\n\"OK, that's it, I've had it, we're going somewhere else!\" grunts my dining partner (and chauffeur).  He's getting to that point where your stomach is indeed eating itself, and if you don't get somethin' up in there, all around will suffer dire consequences i.e. a fierce round of BK Tenders in the car pre-dine.  Our visiting guest agrees.  He, too, is losing stomach lining by the moment and cannot bear it any longer. \n\n\"How about one more time around the block while I bust my Zen vibes and get us a spot in front?\" I quip, though it didn't really seem funny to either of the guys.  I really, really, REALLY wanted to eat here and I wasn't afraid to whine.\n\nI muster up my very best inner Om for some good karma to come my way in a large installment, when all of a sudden, we come upon THE spot, the one right in front of Street! It practically glowed.\n\nAside from the fact that I appeared heka-on-top-of-heka psychic and cool, everyone was glad to just have made it after almost sacrificing the best cut of asphalt up to indecision.\n\nStreet was packed.  Super packed.  I noticed an exquisite spot in a nook by the front door that faced the street and fervently wished for it to be ours.  The peeps already sitting there were almost done, I could tell.   I mentioned to the hostess that we would love to have the window table (which I'm sure she hears about a hundred times a night), and she sweetly told me there were 2 other parties ahead of us but that she would try.  \n\nI was happy with the parking luck, and didn't want to push it, but somehow the karma continued as three seats in a row were open at the end of the bar.  If there were placecards with our names on them, I decided it would be creepy and we would have to leave, however, the only thing waiting for us at the bar was a really friendly bartender who suggested the Apricotini. \nIt was perhaps one of the most delicious infused vodkas I have ever enjoyed, and it came out of a real-deal giant jar of apricot goodness.  She was totally slammed but made us feel welcome, chatted with us a little, and did her job very, very well.  Big props to her for not putting on the \"weary tendress\" mask, which you see in any busy bar.  Her night was hellish by all outward appearances,  but she had a great attitude and was enjoying her evening.\n\nRight after we had a few sips of our drink, sweet hostess lady comes over, again, I think there was a halo of sorts, telling us to come with her.\n\nAnd guess where she takes us?  The window seat, the spot we wanted and even obnoxiously requested.  Fate had worked for us, as the folks there before us were \"loungers\" -the service industry's most dreaded patron, he who practically camps tableside.  The ones with the \"Type Stay\" personality (heh heh I just made that up).  And we were the beneficiaries...yessss!\n\nThe food, wonderful.  Our hummus app was delicious, but for the price, very disappointing portion-wise.  A half-star deduction for that.  \n\nMain?  I had the gnocchi dish, which the chef happily prepared for me sans saucisses.  Our server brought them out on a separate plate before the meal and my BF enjoyed them as an app- very nice.  The gnocchi were like perfect pillows of carbaholic pleasure, potato-ey but fluffy.  I could have eaten another bowl of it, but who wants to be the only one at the table having seconds?  I decided to have another Apricotini instead.\n\nStreet was great, but quite noisy.  We were in the only seat in the house offering a noise buffer to the extreme talky-talky in there.  It's like everyone just won the lotto, graduated, had a baby, and became a grandma all at once and they are all squealing about it.  And they can't stop.  I have never heard more bird-like laughs and Chatty Cathys in one room in my life, so trying to have a date here would not work out unless it was the last one before a break up.

Like in surveys, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being you abso-freaking-lutely agree and 5 being hell-no-no-way disagree, 3 would just be essentially \"I really have no opinion because it never occurred to me that this survey question even mattered at all to my life.\"  So if the place didn't annoy me or blow me away, I often settle at 3 stars.  So did Street deserve me coming out of my deliciously comfortable ambivalence?  Hmmm ... (ambivalently attempting to ponder ...)\n\nHad hummus for appetizer which was really yummy.  Literally - those were the words the waiter used to describe it.  He was like \"Oh yes, that's really yummy.\"  And we were like - did you just say really yummy?  But that's just the feel of street.  It had a nice casualness.  No reservations, small place.  Lots of windows opening onto the street.  So yes - it's 4 stars worth when it comes to feel ... however when it comes to food ...\n\nFor an entree, I thought I was going to get their famed hamburger.  I hadn't even really heard of it yet, but I saw the waiters bring out like 6 of them in the 20 minutes that we were waiting for a table.  Figured it was the thing to order.  But no, I decided on the duck - just to see how creative street could be.  It was kinda chewy, seasoned ok - basically typical californian cuisine.  So yeah, not very creative.  This is what drug me back to ambivalence, I guess.\n\nSigh ... I love california, but I always want my food to have a little more attitude.  What essentially equates in my mind to healthy-ish comfort-ish food just doesn't blow my mind.  But maybe that's just me a now in my life.", "author": "Audrey T."}

Luckily my girlfriends said they also wanted to try it, and so began our awesome dining experience. \n\nThere was a bit of a delay when we arrived for our reservation, so we ordered some drinks and hung out for a bit near the bar area. One of the (I'm guessing) managers or owners sent us a bowl of their amazing kennebec fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled all over. Delicious, and I might even dare to say some of the best fries I've ever had. Plus it was so nice of the staff to realize that we were going to be waiting for a little bit longer than expected! \n\nFor my main entree, I of course had the fried chicken. It was great, and I loved that the sides were corn, mashed potatoes and cole slaw - simple and unpretentious. I just don't get it when places try to make fried chicken all fancy and something that it's really not. \n\nThe desserts were equally fantastic. We tried the bread pudding, homemade peanut butter ice cream and warm chocolate cake. All of them were to-die-for, and only $5.25 each. Since I am a sucker for sweet and salty combinations, I think I may have to come back here for a huge bowl of fries and all of their desserts. \n\nOh and it's also worth noting that this seems like the perfect date restaurant. It's slightly upscale, definitely down to earth and very romantic.", "author": "lindsay w."}

The main reason though is the menu. \n+ Weak house cocktail list that almost entirely consists of flavored liquors with a splash of something. You really can't get away with that in SF. The wine list is okay and the beer list is semi-respectable, but could be found anywhere. \n+ The food is just unimpressive. I've heard raves about the fried chicken... it was terrible. The seasoning in the batter was way off (too spicy and there was a funky aftertaste that had nothing to do with the buttermilk) and it was overcooked. The side dish pairings with the fried chicken were also way too carb heavy... mashed potatoes w/gravy, corn, coleslaw and for an extra $1.50, a piece of cornbread. They should lose the corn and coleslaw and add some greens. (No one in the South where buttermilk fried chicken was invented would ever serve cole slaw with it). We've had other dishes here in the past that were equally unimpressive, but since the fried chicken is somewhat of a specialty, I thought it was worth a full description.\n\nThere are some other problems with Street as well...\n+ Seems to be understaffed for dinner service so it takes forever to place your order and once you do, your food comes out 3 minutes after your drinks. \n+ The service attitude is cold bordering on pretentious by both the waitstaff and the bartenders, which is odd considering the name and general theme of the restaurant. \n+ Not a good value.

But Range is slightly better.\n\nHowever, Street did not necessarily disappoint.\n\nStrong drink: Good wine selection and a solid cocktail.  Street obviously uses Alexia Moore as one of their wine distributors, which I appreciate (Bonny Doon, Husch, etc.).  I use \"cocktail\" in the singular because I only ever order one:  a Knob Creek manhattan.  Our server patiently listened to my specifications and returned with a perfectly mixed manhattan--down to the brandied cherries.  \n\nGood but not stellar food: I had seared ahi, served with mashed and blue lake string beans.   Flavor was good, but the fish was cut too thin for searing and/or the heat was too low.  Consequence: the ahi wasn't really seared.  It was cooked medium rare.  Ahi should be lightly seared on the outside, rare on the inside.  \n\nMy brother is a veg, so he had to get some lame dish that wasn't on the menu.  Note: not a single entree was veg-friendly.  \n\nMy dad ordered the NY strip--excellent, cooked just right.  My grandfather ordered the crab cakes, which were great with a pleasant amount of heat.\n\nTry the bread pudding for dessert.

(Which is a definite plus) Although the place is a little on the darker side and that there's a strange neon light over the door way...the rest of the place was pretty cute.\n\nI really wanted to try the fried chicken, but instead opted for the risotto which was delicious! Yumm!  It was just the right amount of food..plenty of shrimp, chard and cheese with a drizzling of Truffle Oil...drool!  Friend ordered the gnocchi and calabrese sausage, the gnocchi wasn't as firm as I normally like it, but the dish was a great combination!\n\nIf you happen to be in the area you should really try Street, the food and staff were great!", "author": "Christine C."}

Also, after a nice dinner you can hit up any of the numerous wine bars that happen to be nearby.\n\nI've been here three times now and each time has not disappointed.  The fried chicken on Sundays is good.  Their NY strip steak is savory (especially with the generous helping of butter on top).  AND, their dessert is off the hook (I have only tried their sticky toffee bread with vanilla ice cream and the panna cotta).  \n\nI didn't give 5 stars only because their wine selection isn't as good as it could be.

The first bad experience took place on a Friday night. Myself and some friends went to try Street. We were told that there would be a 45 minute wait. We went over to a bar, drank, and returned 45 minutes later. When we asked on the status of our table the hostess, without an apology or any acknowledgment that we had already waited 45 minutes, said that it would be another 45 minutes - one hour. WHAT?!?\n\nNeedless to say we left, but because of its high rating on yelp and its proximity to my apartment, I tried again a few weeks later. I took my parents there for a treat (I know, stupid given my first experience). We went during the week at 7 so there was no wait. When we ordered, my dad asked for the fried chicken as did my boyfriend. All out. THEY ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR FRIED CHICKEN. My mom ordered the fish. All out. At 7 o'clock, before the majority of the people eating there had ordered, they were out of two of the eight items on their entree menu. In tough times, you should be able to count on being satisfied when you choose to go out to a nice meal. We weren't. Twice.", "author": "Jodi S."}

My only complaint: they often run out of chicken and burgers if you don't get there by 9:00 or so. The owner says it's because he wants to make sure everything is fresh, no leftover food. OK, I'll buy that to an extent. But something tells me the day-old \"anything\" here would be an above average culinary experience.\n\nAny appetizer works as a meal intself. The Calamari is crispy but not greasy, rather flavorfully light. Soups are savory and not delieverd scalding hot. You MUST have the burger, with the grilled onions that simply squish themselves between the burger, ketchup and bun. The fries are astounding, not greasy-tasting. The bread pudding is like biting into a buttered pancake with maple syrup, but all the work of buttering and syruping and slicing has already been done for you!\n\nThe bar service is some of the friendliest in the City, usually by a female... young and cute, just like most of the customers.

Plenty of tables and a great bar. Reminds me a bit of a new york restaurant - tables close together and a lively hum.\n\nI love the rustic decor with lots of candlelight reflecting. There's a lovely counter height table in the front window but they absolutely wouldn't let us sit there because we weren't a group of four. As it happens, the table remained empty until we left. \n\nOn the walls they've displayed the mixed-media artwork of Shirley Mariani. It doesn't seem to have changed since I was there several months ago and they don't post prices with her paintings. If a cafe/restaurant/pub is going to go to the trouble of hanging an artist's work, I always like to see the prices and artist's name so I don't have to ask. In this case I did ask which is why I know.\n\nFor starters we had a lovely spring greens salad with granny smith apples and gorganzola. I'm such a fan of blue cheese in a salad and it was tasty. The greens were a bit dry and though I strongly dislike a salad that's swimming in vinagrette, this could have used a tablespoon more.\n\nBoth my friend and I ordered the prime rib. It was medium rare  and served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a few crisp green beans. The prime rib was perfectly done and tender. The mashed potatoes were gluey and contained too much chicken stock. I didn't care for them at all and barely touched them. Usually nothing keeps me from devouring mashed potatoes so that took some doing. They served this with a nice sour cream/horseradish sauce. The entire plate was too cool in temperature. \n\nThe service was fine. Wine selection was decent. I wish they'd brought out my main while it was still hot. There were relatively few people in the restaurant when we ordered and my friend and I ordered the exact same thing so there's really no excuse for it to be sitting around to get cold.\n\nI've had the risotto before and quite liked it.

We searched Yelp and ended up choosing to try the Street. \n\nBe warned, they are serious about their tagline at this joint - strong food, real drinks.  Except they really mean strong sauces.  Not strong like spicy and delicious, but strong like each sauce overpowers the flavor of whatever it is smothering .  \n\nWe started with pork won-tons.  They were okay, but the flavor of the ginger sauce was just entirely too strong - you couldn't taste the pork...  The same was true of S.O.'s steak - the meat was horribly tough.  It was cooked to perfection -- medium rare and pink inside, but the cut of meat itself was all sinewy and tough. And once again the sauce (gorgonzola) completely hid the actual meat flavor.  \n\nMy meal was a disaster.  Being an East Coast transplant I should have known better than to order the crabcakes.  I learned that lesson the hard way many years ago when I first moved here -- or at least that's what one would think.  Unfortunately after reading all of the raving reviews, I really thought they would be a tasty option -- so many rave reviews.  Boy was I wrong.  The actual cake part of the crabcakes were serviceable, but once again the sauce was completely overpowering and completely wrong for the flavor of the crabmeat. Blech! Crab has a delicate, buttery flavor and isn't meant to be paired with a spicy roasted pepper and corn sauce.  I was able to scrape the sauce off and survive, but needless to say I have learned my lesson once again. No one in California knows how to make crabcakes. Period.\n\nThe service was marginal. The place wasn't packed, and we saw our waitress try to deliver our food to another table.  Even though we were trying to get her attention to let her know the food was ours, she ended up going all the way back to the kitchen before she figured it out.\n\nI won't be going back. It's just too saucy.", "author": "Meredith M."}

You can see that the couple who own it have put their hearts and souls into the place but it is just so incredibly uncomfortable that from the moment I sat down, I couldn't wait to leave.   The tables are thisclose together; small two tops with the most uncomfortably hard chairs imaginable.  We went really early on a Thursday evening and so it was still slow but I cannot imagine it being packed. .. I am misanthropic to begin with but can't stand to feel like people are sitting on my lap and that's what it'd be like if the table next to ours was occupied.  The restaurant is tiny with all hard edges - and at 6:00pm they were already playing pseudo house music that just bounced off all the hard edges - it was still bright and sunny outside and the room/ambiance screamed for some good, slow jazz.  \r\n\r\nBut the real reason I went to Street was for the burger.  I REALLY wanted a great burger and I surely was not disappointed.  Truly a great one -one of the best in the city actually.  Perfectly cooked, on good bread with great bacon and superior cheese.   We shared a bowl of fries that were also very good . . . they use the same kind of potatoes that In-n-Out uses - kennebecs - and the only drawback to kennebecs is that while they are perfect when they are hot, as they cool, they get stiff and chewy - I wish more restaurants would use winnemuccas - they stay delicious down to the last morsel.  \r\n\r\nWe also had cocktails and while the mojito is certainly large, quantity does not make up for quality. . .it was awfully weak and the mint was not muddled well enough to release the true depth of flavor.  My companion had a lemon drop that was also weak and not nearly lemony enough.  We started with the fried calamari and won tons.  The calamari themselves were delicious but were served with a Thai dipping sauce that didn't have any discernible flavor and it was watery so it did not cling to the calamari at all.  The won ton were similar in preparation to what they serve at Chow but these won tons were far better.  Toothsome with a firm but delicious filling.  The soy based sauce was so good that we ended up dipping the calamari in the won ton sauce and it was really good that way.  We didn't have dessert - I was so aching to get out of there (okay, so my ass was aching from those hard as rocks chairs)  we left and I NEVER skip dessert.  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, I will be back. That burger was just so good.  I will arrive early and perhaps sit at the empty bar where I'll have plenty of elbow room and can check out all the interesting infused vodkas they have.\r\n\r\nStreet leans toward comfort food on their menu and I just wish the decor reflected that.", "author": "Lainie L."}

The new york steak is always perfectly cooked and served in generous portions, giving steak specialty places like Izzy's a run for their money.  And the wasabe-flavored pork chops, when they used to serve them, were some of the very best I've ever had.\n\nI was hesitant to write a review, because this is a place that is thankfully devoid of tourists.  It beats all the Union Square tourist traps-- with the possible exception of Cortez-- hands down.  \n\nThe bar also serves a variety of wines and topshelf and house drinks.  A big, fat martini and a Street burger or steak is the perfect antidote to whatever ails ya.  We are pretty close to being regulars at this point, having been there probably over a dozen times, and it's always good.  That's why we keep going back.\n\nJust beware that there is no valet parking, and street parking in this area is notoriously tough, especially on a Friday night or the weekends.  Also, they are open for dinner only and not lunch, and I believe that they are closed on Mondays.

Finally a lady said it would be about 15mins and she ushered us to a standing area in the back  to where we could order a couple of beers.  After wishing they had a TV for the past 15mins we finally got seated, and as i mentioned before this place was super packed.  I got crammed into a little seat where peeps were basically standing on top of me at the bar.  Luckily for me they left shortly after i sat.  On to the food, we both got the new york steak and all i can say is it was fantastic.  I just wish it would of been hotter, it tasted almost as it sat for a bit before we got it, but i just ate it super fast to make sure it was warm.  As i said before the food was fantastic, and the waitress was great.  This place could use a TV and some more space...but its definitely crowded for a reason, and you know its good if its crowded so thats always a good sign for your first time to a place, but if i had to deal with that everytime i would probably be frustrated.  4 Stars for Great food, but could definitely benefit from an entry and maybe a TV at the bar, for while your waiting.", "author": "Mike M."}

We paid our bill and sat at the table for a while longer finishing our drinks, and since we were paying customers, we felt this wasn't pushing it.

However, the waitress did assist us in moving the table and getting us seated so that wasn't bad.\n\nWe started with the zucchini fritters and they were really good, I can't complain. My boyfriend got wine and he didn't like it.\n\nFor our entree, I got the gnocchi with calabrese sausage and my boyfriend got the grilled ahi. Mine was nothing spectacular by any means; I mean come on, if you're charging 20 bucks for a plate, it better be damn good but it wasn't. My boyfriend's ahi was overcooked (or so he said) and his mash potatoes were flavorless.\n\nFor dessert, I got the chocolate cake and my boyfriend got the peanut butter ice cream. My chocolate cake was like something that was pulled out of the refrigerator, tossed in the microwave, and a scoop of ice cream was thrown on top. I was shocked to see something like this costing 6 bucks. My boyfriend did like his ice cream though.\n\nOverall, I would have given this place one star if the service was mediocre and if the fritters were bad, but they weren't and they were the only two highlights for me at this place.

Got here and realized right away how cramped everything seemed. The waitress seated the 3 of us (more like squeezed us) directly in between a guy alone and the back side of people at the bar while plenty of other more roomy tables were available. The tables literally have a hands length of space between neighboring tables. We finally asked to be moved, and then ordered. I got the burger which was one of the best burgers I've had and my sister in law said the same. My wife ordered the clams as an appetizer and a salad...of course they brought out the appetizer with all of our meals. After we all had our plates in front of us, the waitress said \"oh I forgot your salad\" not realizing we literally had no space on the small table for a 4 th plate.. so she brought it back and squeezed the salad on the corner of the table giving us zero space to even eat. Nice. Throughout our meal we were continuously interrupted, pestered, and rushed by the waiters and waitresses as they aimlessly loomed around our table to see if they could take anything...and then just stood there by the table looking out the window when they had nothing to do (really anoying). The waitress went to grab my wifes plate to take it away before she was done (yet again) and got an unpleasant \"I'm not done\" response from the wifey.

Definitely add the cornbread - it's the best cornbread I've ever had (sorry, Grandma).  The mixed greens with goat cheese custard is to die for.  I really loved the pork chop and mashed potatoes with cabbage.  As someone said, the bread pudding here is unlike any other.  It's in a league of its own.  The food is delicious, not necessarily for the health nut.  This isn't a sally salad chick restaurant - as they say, \"strong food, real drinks.\"  \n\nBest of all, great staff (our server last time was really awesome), family-owned, and inexpensive.  A long-time favorite of mine.\n\nUPDATE - 9/2/2007:   I had to dock Street a star, as much as it smarts to do so.  My last 3 experiences (I've probably been about 20 times overall) have not lived up to the 5 stars I previously bestowed.  First, my husband's Bloody Mary a few visits ago was made with grapefruit juice!  When he complained, they brought another with grapefruit juice!  I know it's dark in there, but come on.  He ended up getting a beer, and Bloody Marys at Street are his raison d'etre - so he was sad.  The next time, my Wild Thing, my favorite drink in town, containing cherry infused vodka and a \"secret ingredient\" I know to be their amazing Anaheim Habanero infused vokda, was served without the Habanero vodka.  When I asked the young cheeky bartender chick, I was informed I was wrong about the Habenero.  Huh?  And our food on the same trip was not very good - it pains me to say that after nearly 4 faithful years of attendance, but so it was.  On my most recent trip, my Wild Thing did include the Habanero Vodka, and I got confirmation I was right that it's supposed to be in the Wild Thing.  Still, it took 15 minutes for our cocktails to arrive, then the waitress forgot to order our appetizer, so we ended up foregoing it.  (Meanwhile, the couple next to us ordered after us, but got all drinks AND their calamari appetizer, and ate and drank much of those things, before anyone bothered to put a drink in front of us.)  The forsaken app had been the goat cheese custard, about which I fantasized over an entire year of bike touring, so I was pretty disappointed about that..  While a brief apology was offered for these TWO significant screwups, nothing else was.  I've gone there for nearly 4 years, and having everything screwed up without any offer of compensation (hello, one free drink would have convinced me you cared???  after 2 screwups, shouldn't you offer something to show you actually care?) was disheartening.  Street, what's going on?  I know you still have it in you, 'cause the food is improving again.  I'm really hoping you step things back up, because you seem like nice folks and I've truly enjoyed your place over the years.  I still plan to go back - too many delicious and fun times have preceded, and I believe things are on the upswing at Street.", "author": "Jes H."}

I can totally understand why people are into this place as a date spot - the waitresses, and there were 3 plus a bartender on a not-so-packed Tuesday night, were very busy chatting with each other while I was hoping just to get some water. First - she asked us for something from the bar and we said no. She walked off BEFORE we could even ask for water. Took awhile to come back. It was highly annoying (sorry I didn't want a drink!). Our appetizer came out AFTER our main course. HOW?? WHY?? I had ordered a steak salad. The salad was very obviously not the ingredients on the menu - i.e. the salad had cheap substitutions. I hate when this happens. Don't charge $20 for a salad that should have heirloom tomatoes and potatoes on it and then obviously substitute. I might have said something too, except the waitresses were not being freindly or in any way attentive. At one point a waitress, not ours (ours was no where in sight) came over and opened the window right behind me without saying anything. There was a super cold SF fog draft! So I shut it. She comes running out \"I'm sorry but the kitchen is really hot right now!!!\" and I was like ummm sorry? What am I supposed to do - pay an arm an a leg for a dumb salad and freeze?

My most recent visit was typical. The food was great. We went for Dine About Town, a promotion for which their menu prices aren't really suited. Basically, if you put their most expensive appetizer, entree and dessert together you save a few bucks--and that appeared to be about what they were offering. So, we ordered off the main menu, which was fine as their food is so good. The appetizers were good. We all had their famous Fried Chicken for entree, which was superb! For dessert, we shared the bread pudding, which also totally rocked. Really tasty! \n\nUnfortunately, the wine we ordered with dinner was awful. It wasn't corked, but just so lame I left wondering if the person putting their list together cares about this important part of the dining experience. \n\nAnyway, the service that night was terrible. Our waiter did all the stuff that sucks like ignoring our table when having long chats with other guests, failing to fill water glasses, etc. etc. They were busy, so at the end of the meal we finally got her attention--and were clearly being rushed to get out so she could turn the table. What really bugged me though is that one of our party members asked if she could get a side of lentils that weren't on the menu--but were being served as a side with another dish. The waiter grumpily went back to ask if that was possible and returned to brusquely tell us \"No.\" I guess it saved them some hassle, but in this city with so many options, I certainly won't rush back to Street if they're so inflexible and rude with customers.", "author": "Dave B."}

They try to turn their tables as fast as possible since it's a smaller place, meaning that the wait staff can be somewhat in your face and a little pushy (in a nice way though).  ah, the economics of running a restaurant in a high-rent district of SF. No reservations, which means you may need to wait at the bar for a while.  Which is fine, because they make good cocktails (my Manhattan got me sufficiently loosened up for dinner).  We shared the calamari and the wontons as appetizers; both good but not exceptional.  Apparently Street has a reputation for making a great burger, so I felt compelled to order it... not the best burger I've ever had (the Martini House still retains that distinction), but very good nonetheless (it was, however, topped with some of the best bacon I've ever had.  just awesome).  I had a taste of their housemade Calabrese sausage over gnocci and it was great; I'll definitely try that the next time I eat here.

Needed a place to get an easy quick bite to eat with a friend in Russian Hill and I was sick of Rex's.  We walked in to discover that the place was actually kind of swanky looking, dimly lit., sort of like a place in NY.   I was afraid it wouldn't be quite so easy but actually it wasn't difficult to sit down nor was it overly expensive.  We were immediately seated and I was so pleased to discover (as always) that they had Prosecco by the glass.  Since I hadn't drank anything in 10 days (well almost) because of stupid antibiotics I was very excited to have the nectar of the gods only to discover they were out of Prosecco by the glass.  Since I wasn't at the point of drinking the bottle myself (have to ease back in ya know) the waitress suggested their Sparkling Pinot Grigio which ended up being quite tasty.  Ok, enough about the alcohol situation, they also had darn good food.  The hummus appetizer was really delicious as was the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  The caesar salad looked amazing (tons of parmesan sprinkled on top like snow) but it actually wasn't all that tasty.  Nonetheless, I will definitely be back to try the fried chicken and hamburgers which looked very good (since I am rude and stare at other people's food).", "author": "Lindsay P."}

Their infused vodka drinks are AWESOME. Wine list seemed good. Tried a $35 bottle of Pinot, which was so-so. Our table was ready on time and we were seated. The ambiance is nice, but it is kind of dark, dinner by candle light kind of thing. For dinner we had the Hook and Ladder Cabernet, which was awesome. Calamari and Won-tons for appetizers, both were fine. Not amazing, not bad. I had the steak, my wife had the Gnocchi, sister had the Ahi Tuna, and the in-laws had the Crab cakes. My steak was good. I ordered it medium rare and it was. Not too tough, good quality meat. I usually prefer baked or mashed potatoes, but their Kennebec fries were pretty damn good. Tried the wife's Gnocchi with Sausage and red sauce. The dumplings were good, not the best I've ever had, but close. Didn't love the red sauce or the sausage. Tried the tuna, seemed a bit dry to me, but I prefer it seared and the Sis got it medium rare. Tried the crab cakes, AWESOME!! Super tasty, maybe a bit salty, but great overall. Moved on to dessert. I had the bread pudding with pecans and caramel sauce. Really good, probably the best bread pudding I have ever had (I haven't had much.) Everyone else seemed to like their desserts. Coffee was good. The service overall was pretty good. They had a hard time figuring out who ordered what, but it wasn't a huge deal. They brought out dishes two at a time, so a few of us had to wait to begin. But we had a party of 9, so I guess it wasn't too bad. All in all it was a good experience. There isn't much seating so definitely call ahead for reservations. For parties of two I would recommend just showing up and sitting at the bar, which looked kind of fun. The menu is a bit limited, mostly meat dishes, not much pasta, and is priced fairly. Expect to spend between $18 - $25 for an entree. Salads were $8, appetizers were $10+. For wine, appetizers, salads, entrees, and desert, we spent $46 per person, which included the tip.

Calamari was sincerely not good at all, not special and felt like they took prepackaged ones and fried it up.  Cheese custard was decent.

They basically gave us the SAME dessert, except the apple cake had ONE piece of apple, and the bread pudding was a tad bit softer than the apple cake.  Other than that, there was no difference between the two desserts. It was quite ridiculous. In conclusion, I would never ever recommend this place to anyone!!!! Don't go there! Don't waste your money!!! There were four of us and we ended up spending $143.00 not including tip.  We were unsatisfied and short $143.00. Let's just say the person in our party that chose this restaurant owes us big time (he happens to be my husband).", "author": "esther Q."}
