All I've had are their tacos but they are some of the best tacos I've had in a long time.  \n\nThe food is made to order and is always served hot.  They use only the freshest ingredients and the taste is superb.  I am a picky eater but once I find something I like, I stick to it.  Once I know I will have a good experience with a restaurant, I get really comfortable.  Pepe's is like that.  You can't help but be comfortable. \n\nThey food is prepared quickly but with care.  The prices are GREAT and the portions are generous.  The first time I went, I ordered 2 tacos... I could only eat one.  So very generous portions... \n\nCarne Asada is my favorite although I have also tried their grilled chicken tacos.  I can't wait to try the burritos!\n\nThe owner is a really nice man.  He is friendly and he keeps me smiling every time I see him.  I have a good experience every single time I enter the cafe.  \n\nI can't wait to try everything on the menu!", "author": "Kirsten W."}

They also have an \"extra spicy\" salsa for those who have a strong constitution. I usually get a couple of soft tacos (they have many to choose from) and share my  wife's plate, since the portions are so huge! \n\nThe food is fresh and clean and the service is always friendly and efficient.

Every time I walk into Pepe's, I'm always greeted in the best way by the owner. He is very friendly and always makes me laugh. I highly recommend the Al Pastor Plato Especial. It includes rice, beans, al pastor pork and several side corn tortillas to make your own tacos. The servings are pretty big and worth the amount you pay ($13-$15). Other than Al Pastor, the second best meat here is Carnitas. Their burritos and bowls are pretty popular here too. The line goes pretty fast and you can pay with a card.

Also, you can call your order in, so you just pick up and go, the line can take a while as they custom make each breakfast burrito. \n\nLunch is a different beast all in its self, they have the gambit of the traditional offerings and the line moves pretty quickly. On Thursdays they have El Pastor, so, yeah get that if you're there on a Thursday! \n\nLastly, if you're gonna order for a large group I would recommend you order the day before or super early, they make everything fresh day-of so it can take some time for them to prep it.

Plus side: the burritos are quite large, and you won't be hungry after finishing one. The prices are ... well, it's the Financial District. Cheap food is not to be found in that area. Down side: the food is not as flavorful as Mexican should be. I've found that getting the burrito dry (i.e., no sauce) actually improves the flavor substantially. Yes, you read that right: leave out the sauce, and the flavor is better. I'm not sure how that's possible, and yet it happened.\n\nBut despite that, the food is adequate for the task.\n\nBecause most people go to lunch at exactly 12 noon in this area (no really - they do. It's freaky, as though they share a single common 'brain' or something). the lines can get really long at that time of the day. Solution: go here before 11:45, or after 1:00.

The menus I tried were steak burrito and chicken burrito. Overall they are decent:\nPros: Large quantity (mind you about 30% are meat), good quality of steak, flavourful\nCons: Pretty salty like any other burrito, too much rice filling as opposed to vegetable or meat.\n\nHowever I'm planning to discontinue coming here for one reason - rude, offensive cashier. I usually don't rate restaurant experience based on customer experience but for this place I have to take 1-1.5 stars off purely because of that. Every time I go there, whether it's busy or not, the cashier glares at me with pissed off face asking for my MealPal number, usually by demanding \"You're number!\" When he wants me to repeat my number he goes \"What?!\" with \"Don't make me repeat myself\" tone. Whats's funny is his demeanour changes to rainbows and sunshine when he's interacting with non-MealPal customers. For example, after he passes over my burrito (without looking at my face) he immediately attends the next customer with bright ass smile saying things like \"Sir, what did you order?\" or \"Thank you\" with sincerity. I had no idea he had manners until then. All in all, I never felt this guilt tripped or disrespected for getting MealPal anywhere but here so I'm gonna stop coming to this place.

I ordered a Carnitas Burrito with sour cream and cheese. It was a tremendously large burrito, and I probably could have only eaten two thirds of it if I had been trying to fill myself. Instead I ate half, and saved the rest so I could have two moderately sized meals. The staff was nice, but the glass wall is quite high so you really have to shout in order for them to hear you. Service was lightning fast and easy to follow, as you could clearly see and choose from all the ingredients added to your meal. My burrito came foil-wrapped in a little paper serving bowl with a napkin, which made it super easy to grab and go. \n\nThe burrito was excellent! I thought there was a good mix of everything, but the lettuce was a little lacking. Also, charging $0.50 for a dollop of sour cream and another $0.50 for some cheese pushed my price up to almost $10. I think I'm going to give the burrito food truck a try to see what I can get for the same amount of money.\n\nRegardless, this establishment makes excellent burritos and I wouldn't mind coming back!\n\nEdit: After getting to sample some other taco/burrito offerings, I have to say this is my favorite of the bunch. With the amount and proportions of ingredients on the burrito, the speed of the service, and the price, it's definitely one of the best of the lot. Yet again, the burrito was the size of a small child, and I wasn't even able to finish half this time.", "author": "John B."}

For someone like me, who could live on tacos daily, finding a good Mexican joint is a matter of survival. I guess beggars can't be choosers.  At least the staff could be a little more friendly. There was a special of the day happening; 3 tacos, hard or soft shell for $8.00. I love hard shell tacos, so I figured it wouldn't be a significant rule breaking event to get 1 hard shell taco with rice and beans. I place my order and the reply was a grumpy \"we don't have hard shell tacos\"! Me, with a smile replies, but your sign special says that you do. \"We don't anymore\"! I remain silent while the other Lady J in my head said, well maybe you should update your sign, so people like me are not let down. Maybe. \n\nAs backup I ordered a small chicken quesadilla with all the fixings: salsa, cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole. The overwhelming amount  of black pepper on the chicken was bewildering. Is this how your joint flavors the food? I couldn't taste the guacamole, the tomatoes were watery and carried no flavor. What they thought was spicy about the salsa was beyond me, really it was just tomatoe juice. To accompany my petite quesadilla, I'd also ordered a side of rice & beans. Initially I was given a full side of beans. Although an easy correction, it is another check on a list of reasons why I will not be returning to Pepe's", "author": "Jaylena P."}

It's hard to find a good burrito in that area so I was excited to try it out.\n\nFREQUENCY: This was my first time ordering at this establishment.\n\nFOOD: I got an El Pastor burrito that was absolutely gigantic. Definitely worth the $9 for the meal. The ingredients were spread out very well which is always important for me in a burrito. They offer different types of beans, sauces, and topping which you can customize your food with. I personally enjoy spicy food and got the hottest sauce they had which I enjoyed.\n\nDRINK: I didn't order any drinks while at this establishment so I can't give an honest assessment in this category. From memory, I believe they had standard drinks that you might expect at a place in a mall food court.\n\nATMOSPHERE: A pretty standard small taqueria atmosphere for the San Francisco area. It's small and a little loud but you'll be in and out relatively quickly so the atmosphere (whether you like or dislike it) won't stick around you much.\n\nSTAFF: The staff were very quick and effective at putting together a good burrito. Since this wasn't a sit down restaurant I didn't expect any conversation besides telling them what I wanted on my burrito.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nIf this burrito was served anywhere other than San Francisco or San Diego it probably would have been a 4 star review. But there are so many amazing taqueria's around the city that serve up a true 4 or 5 star burrito that I didn't want to skew my reviews for those other establishments.

Second, the chicken was very dry and otherwise the burrito was not very flavorful. Given the wealth of other options in Rincon center, and the other Mexican places nearby, it's safe to say I won't be going back for a while.\n\nIssue 1) A burrito is 7.75. I got cheese as well, which is 0.50 cents extra. The burrito was rung up at $9.52 before we were done adding ingredients and before I got the cash register. At first glance that seems within reason, but a quick mental math walking out of the center gives more than 15% above the menu price was charged. I know tax is high on food in the city, but it's not more than 15%. The owner (at the register) added some additional charge hoped I didn't notice.\n\nIssue 2) Dry chicken, overcooked chicken speaks for itself. The rest of the overall quality was just generally poor. The other ingredients weren't very tasty, and the tortilla was also dry and crumbly. Given that we are in San Francisco, you can really do much better. At lease the size was good.\n\nSorry Pepe's.

I ordered a chicken burrito on my much too short lunch break and was not impressed. TEN DOLLARS (!) later I was looking forward to my new burrito when I was sadly disappointed. The chicken was dry, the rice overcooked, and the lettuce limp. I couldn't even finish half of it and I was hungry!

This place is Rincon mediocrity at its best but they are fast, cheap and efficient.  Being a taco connoisseur, I've developed a standard in which I judge all tacos.  The meat and tortillas are fresh but the tacos are overstuffed with lettuce and tomatos.  It's like a little burrito!  The salsa has no kick and they serve sour cream as a standard.\n\nThe burritos are good but, again, overstuffed with too much filling and not enough meat.  The meat itself is ok - it tastes like boiled beef, but I'm not sure if it really is boiled.  No chorizo, lengua or cabeza but it is Rincon, I guess.  I actually go here quite often when I don't have time to walk over to the roach coach on Folsom but still need a taco.  Right in the middle of everything - not great, not horrible - three stars.", "author": "Tony M."}

Right?  Oh, so wrong. I've given them 2 chances now... and it's really not great. \n\nFirst experience:  Got a burrito - because I didn't see nachos on the menu. (i was blinded by hunger). It was, ok. Nothing special. Just a burrito. Nothing like the burritos out in the Mission. Now those, are a deal!\n\nToday's experience... I had a craving for nachos... and so I got them. 1. the cheese - gross. 2. the meat, tough. 3. the salsa, soupy. 4. the toppings, not so impressive. 5. just not great. \n\nAnd then - my stomach hurt!

The first time I had a carnitas burrito.  The person seemed confused when I asked for carnitas...como? This is a mexican food place right?  The carnitas was dry and hard, more like jerky...yuck!!\n\nI recently went back because I had a severe craving for nachos. Trust me if the nacho craving wasn't so severe I wouldn't have gone back. This is how the nachos started...a to go box with tortilla chips with melty nacho cheese on them, then carnitas (yes I'm a glutton for punishment and tried them again) some beans then some guacamole.  I was being rushed out of their so fast I couldn't decide what to put on the nachos...it wasn't even busy, there was only one person in line behind me and I was there before the noon time lunch rush so I'm not sure what the deal was.  The guy also seemed irritated that I wanted meat on my nachos, is this such a weird request?\n\nThe service was not good...not very friendly.  Back to the nachos; the carnitas was not dried out this time but it was super fatty (gross!) and had no flavor. Also lacking flavor was the guacamole...if that's even what it was. The chips were too salty and when I get nachos from a \"mexican food place\" I expect real cheese not nacho cheese.  Please don't get me wrong I am not a hater of nacho cheese; I am a lover of nacho cheese, specifically que bueno BUT that kind of cheese is reserved for nachos at baseball games and other sporting events or at parties with a nacho bar.  Nachos from a mexican food place should have real cheese that is piled on top of the nachos and then melted in the oven. Oh and yes I am a nacho connoisseur in case you were wondering.", "author": "Kel E."}

I ordered a pollo asado burrito and a steak taco.  \n\nI must say that I was extremely impressed with the food. The salsa verde was a perfect compliment for my burrito, but the only problem I have is that I didn't get to eat my steak taco. This was due to the fact that my burrito was huge (definitely something that I don't mind). \n\nI'm not in the city too often, but when I am I definitely will try and stop by Pepe's again.
