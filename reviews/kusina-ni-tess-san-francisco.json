I passed by this restaurant on my way to the Westfield mall and decided to give it a try. \n\nThe food and smells remind me of my childhood growing up in the Philippines.  They gave me a few samples and I decided to order their beef tapas with rice and egg.  It was a good plate of food - it really took me back to a lot of my meals in childhood that consisted of some meat with plenty of sauce to be soaked up by the white rice.  I also ordered a \"halo halo\", which is Filipino shaved ice dessert typically with some fruit, ice cream, ube and flan.  \n\nThis is a small family restaurant and the prices are very affordable. They also have Filipino soaps on the TV. I was smiling at the end of this meal - I guess nostalgia comes with age. I'll be coming back to order some of their other dishes.  I'd recommend this place for some quick, cheap Filipino bites.", "author": "Andrew S."}

That really helped in deciding what I wanted to order. \n\nMost of the things I tried were really good, but I stuck to ordering their most popular items, which were the tapsilog and cornsilog. Both were flavorful but not overly salty. Having a bite of the meat with the garlic rice, and egg was mouth-watering combination. Aside from those two dishes, I got an order of the lumpia. Since they were taken out of the freezer, I'm not sure if they were made in house or not, but they were still tasty. They could use a little more meat inside them though. \n\nWhen I was done ordering, the same lady that gave me samples helped me checkout.

I can't pretend I know what good Filipino food tastes like, so I can't vouch for its authenticity. It tastes very homey though, as if I were eating a home cooked meal with my parents. Filipino food seems to be all about heartiness so don't expect to find anything healthy here. Even any sort of vegetables are scarce, with food centering around meat.\n\nFood is ordered a la carte here, cafeteria style. If you're not familiar with Filipino food, you can just point at whatever looks appealing to you behind the glass. I had no idea what anything was, so I ended up pointing and asking what everything was. The lady helping me asked if it was my first time there, and when I said yes, she was kind enough to give me small samples of her favorite dishes to try.\n\nPrices vary depending on the type of protein/dish, averaging about $6 for small, $10 for medium and $13 for large sizes. Rice is $1.25. You can easily get a pretty filling lunch here for less than $10 with a small entree and rice.\n\nI went with 2 small entrees and no rice:\n\n* KARE KARE ($5.50, small)\nPork (knuckle I think?) in a peanut-based broth. The meat was a tad try, and the small size came with only 1 piece. I was expecting the broth to be thicker, but it was pretty thin and light in flavor. Served with fish paste on the side, which added a lot of saltiness, but I actually liked it without the fish paste\n\n* CHICKEN ADOBO ($5.50, small)\nKind of reminded me of a Chinese chicken dish, but much more acidic. A little heavy on the salt. Chicken was fatty with lots of skin and a little on the dry side", "author": "Jessie L."}

I wanted a quick meal, so I went through Eat24, placed an order for pick-up and waited a bit.  I guess I should have looked at the photos, to better understand that it's essentially a steam plate restaurant so it wasn't necessary to do that.   Anyway - when I got there, they didn't receive the Eat24 order, talked about how they don't get the order, but that it would be on Maria's cell phone, etc etc.  Also more importantly, of the 4 things I ordered and paid for, 2 of the items were not available that day - which, again - had I looked, is totally understandable when knowing it's a steam plate / to go type of place.\n\nRather than go through the process of calling Maria and deal with the order, I showed them my receipt, and then I was able to substitute items to make up the same totals.   The ladies in there were super accommodating and helpful (even though I was a bit disappointed that I cldn't have 2 items I had been craving on my walk over).  Luckily I'm a glutton, and love to eat - so there were plenty of other options.  \n\nWhile not filipina myself, I grew up in Asia, and had home cooking at home often.  I ended up with Chicken Adobo, the mung beans stew (mongo), a stewed pork (i think it was binagoongan) ... and taro leaves in coconut milk - all in small sizes - along in with a side of rice.  so so so yummy.  For ME, everything hit the spot and took me 'home' to my childhood.  I was pleasantly surprised at the flavours and quality.  Perhaps it was because I was hungry, perhaps because it was just that good.  Hard to tell.  \n\nNeighbourhood is a bit sketchy - some might not feel 'comfortable' eating in the restaurant, though there is seating.  I took mine to go and ate in my room - and would likely have preferred to do that, simply because my room was more comfortable.\n\nAnyway - worth a shot.

Apparently more than two -_- After failed attempts at searching Ni and Kess, we gave up and searched Filipino in order to navigate to this epitome-of-hole-in-the-walls.\n\nThe hole-in-the-wall-ness has pluses and minuses. The ambiance is simple, modest, and cafeteria-like (yes, think prepared food in metal trays over steamers. And plastic trays.), and it's more of a lunch place because they close at 8pm and run out of stuff at the end of the day: only the food on display + desserts are available. (I guess another minus is the difficult name to remember)\n\nThe trade-off is the authenticity. Well.... to be fair my knowledge of Filipino food doesn't extend far beyond the various Filipino items at my school cafeteria and fusion brunch places that include longaniza sausage. However, I trust from my extensive foodie (wannabe) adventures that I have reasonable judgment of legit good food.\n \nThe lady serving us was friendly and I really appreciate all her patience with our n00biness and indecisiveness. It was nice of her to offer us samples of all the entrees (reminded me of ice cream... why can't all restaurants do this).  We got the LAING (taro leaves and spinach in coconut milk) and PORK STEW with vermicelli and melon. Both were good, with a contrast between the creamy indulgent laing and the simple homemade stew. Also, you feel less guilty than my usual guilt-tripping Filipino feast of abodo and lumpia, seeing that laing consists of good honest vegetables--swimming in coconut milk, but veggies nonetheless. We got a sausage as well: pretty tasty but not mind-blowing (not super enthusiastic how they dipped it in oil before serving)\n\nWe also sampled the PANCIT and GROUND PORK--not bad but rather salty so it's one of those things that you taste good in a sample but may be too much if you got an entire entree of it.\n\nThe HALO HALO is a must-get. We've never had it before but it was a delicious mix of flavors and textures, including soft pudding-like flan, chunky ube, starchy beans, crunchy shaved ice, and chewy jelly--makes pearl milk tea seem a little too basic... Frappucinos like something from the Stone Ages. I liked how it wasn't too sweet so made a satisfying and refreshing dessert.\n\nTotal was ~$20 for 2 people, and that rivals food trucks where you most likely have to eat squatting in windy parking lots.

Nope. The hilton across the street has a sizable garage however, and there is a cheaper city owned garage about a block away. Can't really recommend street parking in the tenderloin. It seems safe enough, but the surrounding neighborhood is not for the unwary.\n\nThere is inside seating for a dozen or so people with the usual table/chair combos. The tables are covered with a plastic overlay over the table cloth for easy cleaning. There is a television which is dedicated to Filipino programming.\n\nThis is a smaller ma and pop place. There is a menu you can order off of, and past peak hours some items like lumpia are made when ordered, otherwise it's cafeteria style. That is to say the food is prepared and kept heated in a counter so those of you not familiar with Filipino cuisine (tip: you can never go wrong with Adobo.) can look at what you want prior to saying \"I want two plates of that! No the other one! What's that called? Yeah looks good. What does it come with?\" and so on. There is a soda fountain and a cooler for bottle/canned drinks (not necessarily soda). They have a filling and cheap breakfast-a rice, egg, and meat combo will be eight bucks or so. Ten if you get tea or coffee and/or a sweet. The lunch and dinner combos will be a bit more around ten of fifteen dollars for three items and a drink, a little more for non tilapia seafood. this is more of a bargain then just about any place close by.\n\nThere is no table service-you order, pay, and get your food at the counter, but the little old ladies running the place are very sweet.\n\nIt doesn't look like much from the outside, and that block is pretty much covered with urban grit, but don't be fooled. This is a wonderful family style Filipino restaurant.", "author": "Steven W."}

Even this Filipino food is ok,\n But the price and the portions may make you lose your appetite. It is set up where you just point to what you like, but they will price you for an A la carte. Which wasn't before. His excuse is because the rent in downtown is so high. Well you're in the wrong business if you can't strategize properly and charge your customers correctly.  Remember, almost 17.00 for a 2 item to go. Adobo, vegetables and rice. 17.00.for one person, to go. If you believe in paying this amount for this kind of set up, go ahead. Customers have been conditioned to think that this should be normal nowadays. I don't think so. SKIP THIS ONE. I will just go to the burger fastfood or pizza plaze or some Chinese fast food in downtown where portions are good and price is reasonable. Stay away from this one. Patronizing this would embolden them to continue with their pricey, small portion set up. WALK AWAY.", "author": "Daisy P."}

The TV was playing a Filipino soap opera, there is a crucifix on the wall, and all my peeps were there speaking Tagalog except when it was my turn to order.  I opted to get something not fried, as the pork Chicahronne (though it looked good).  I was looking for something quick to eat as I was on my way to a meeting.\n\nI looked at their items on the counter and ordered a scoop of rice with one BBQ pork kebab at $2.99-that's a deal.  Just when I thought the woman was going to hand me the meal, to my surprise, she walked over to the microwave to heat up my food... just like at a relatives house, literally.  I assumed the food on the counter was heated from underneath.  I assumed wrong. Because my meal was nuked, the rice wasn't as soft and the meat was a little tough. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't fresh, but for the price I paid I shouldn't expect much.\n\nI will agree with the other reviews that the food is authentic Filipino cuisine and they offer a decent menu selection.  I do is also believe when the food is served fresh without the microwave, it probably tastes really good, as my BBQ kebab had potential.", "author": "Nova P."}

(Breakfast being my favorite culinary experience when I visited Manila a few months ago!) Given that we are in San Francisco, where there's a thriving Filipino community, I figured it wouldn't be very difficult to find a good place. \n\nYelp was obviously quite helpful in my search progress and soon I stumbled upon Kusina Ni Tess, which coincidentally was not too far away from our office...in the Tenderloin. Being the person who needs to try out a place first before sharing it with others, I headed there during my lunch break. The person behind the counter was Maria and as it turns out she is the owner. We got to chat and soon I realized that I wanted to do business with her: we came up with a breakfast menu that would feed 20 people!\n\nOn the day of the Filipino launch I went over to Kusina Ni Tess shortly after they opened...it was only 7:10am. However, the kitchen was already busy with lots of eggs, sweet pork sausages and rice in need of being fried up! Maria greeted me with a warm smile and shortly after I was out the door, into my taxi and off to the breakfast party...\n\nThanks for catering our breakfast, Maria!", "author": "Uli B."}

It's this tiny hole-in-the-wall that I only noticed while looking out the window at the Hilton during a break between sessions. But, my god, did I love this place so much that I had lunch here 3 times over a 4-day period. This joint is what I desperately needed after traveling and eating meals of anything but Filipino food.\n\nFirst meal: Lechon kawali (with rice). They offered Mang Tomas to go with it, and which I regret not getting. I got very fatty pieces with very little meat. But they served it hot-hot which I liked. Wasn't totally impressed but I decided to return and give them another try.\n\nSecond meal: Deep fried tilapia (with rice). Now, if you don't know how to eat fish with bones, don't get this because you get the whole she-bang (eyes, tail, and all!). Setting that technicality aside, it was, again, served hot-hot and it hit the spot (especially with the soy sauce).\n\nThird meal: Adobo and mechado (with rice). Solid adobo.

A bit pricey frankly, but the food itself is very good. The adobo and dinuguan is tender and flavorful. The Lechon is deep fried a second time to warm it up, making it very crispy and flavorful. I took it all home and I really wish I stayed at the restaurant to eat it because like I said... portions.\n\nThe second time I came back, I got a medium size of pork adobo and small lechon plus a scoop of rice. $18.

But they had some leftover from breakfast and asked if we mind. We didn't. It was a bit mushy, but still so good! \n\nPork Picadillo: Ground pork with potatoes, carrots, and peas. Simple yet flavorful. It was almost stew-like with all the liquid. So good with rice! My favorite!\n\nPork Adobo: Big chunks of pork stewed together. I wasn't a big fan of this one since the pork had huge pieces of fat on it and wasn't very tender. \n\nTortang Tolang: Fried eggplant or eggplant omelet. Basically it's a cooked eggplant, flattened then dipped in egg and fried. Definitely taste the freshness of the eggplant. Yum! \n\nLaing: Taro leaves cooked in coconut milk. Very fragrant. Laing usually has pork and shrimp in it, but the one here was vegetarian. Rich and heavy, but still tasty! \n\nI can't really comment on the authenticity or quality since I have no comparison.

So, while walking to our hotel this weekend, we passed this little place, and I said to my hubby that we needed to remember it.\n\nToday I went back, and it did not disappoint.  I ordered exactly what I knew; Pancit and Lumpia.  As a previous reviewer stated, this is a small place and the food has already been cooked and is kept warm for you to point at what you'd like.   It has a rotating daily menu, and you can see that menu on this website by looking at the pictures they have posted.  Service is friendly, and the patrons are....what do ya know....Filipino.  Always a good sign.  Portions are HUGE and prices are low, my food was hot, not luke warm, and although I'm not Filipino, nor have I ever been to the Philippines to visit, I will easily say this is the best food from that country that I have had thus far.  \n\nLarge portion of Pancit + 6 pork lumpia = $9.77 after tax.\n\nSkip the chains and support the small guys.  Definitely worth a visit.", "author": "Britt B."}

I spy, \"Kusina Ni Tess, Hmmmm.\" a-yelping I will go. I've been wanting to find an authentic Filipino restaurant to try and this looks tailor-made.\n\nI navigate the sidewalk denizens without issue and enter at Noon on a Tuesday. One man eating, a few more bopping through for plates to go. Overall not busy at all. The owner/partner, I am guessing, greets me with a friendly smile and surmises from my Not-so-San-Fran look that I may need assistance. She proceeds to let me try several items, all of which were tasty flavor explosions. Try that at Chez PooPoos! Yeah, I didn't think so.\n\nI settled on a Pork w/shrimp sauce(?) stew which was awesomely awesome and Laing (Tarrow leaves stewed in coconut milk). Here is a variant that doesn't look as good as Kusina's did [ http://www.filipino-recipes-lutong-pinoy.com/laing-taro-leaves-stewed-in-coconut-milk.html ] The Liang was reminiscent of very mild turnip greens (I don't really care for turnip greens) with a Filipino coconut flair. It was really very good. I ate everything on my plate in no time.\n\nOthers have called this a Mom-n-Pop offering and I can agree with that. It definitely feels like you are sitting in a family kitchen while they cook around you. Overall, that ambiance sets the table perfectly for the food you are going to eat. I have little experience with authentic Filipino food, but I can tell you with a high degree of certainty that this is it! How? Because it tastes just like the Filipino sister of Southern comfort food cooked all day and overflowing with 5-gallon-buckets-of-love. \n\nI had a hard time getting over the $10 limit for Credit Card charges. Yet I am pleasantly full and the Rock concert of flavor lingers like your favorite Pink Floyd song. Awesome food that is easy on the pocketbook in downtown SF!? Whoa.\n\nOne line review: This is relaxed, honest food that you won't regret. \n\nIf I can be motivated to get dressed early I'll go try their breakfast offerings in the morning. Considering the alternative $18 bowl of fruit you can purchase from the Hotel - I may have to upgrade that \"may\" to an \"I will absolutely go...\"", "author": "Clark H."}

This was my first time trying Filipino cuisine, and despite some initial hesitation, I was very pleasantly surprised. \n\nLooking for an inexpensive lunch, we found this place near our hotel on Yelp and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. However, staring at the menu outside, we had no idea what to order. Just as we were ready to walk away, a passerby on the street stopped us and said we would love it, and recommended that we get the chicken adobo with a bowl of rice and the pork lumpia. \n\nWith guidance like that, we couldn't turn away and boy am I glad we didn't. The chicken adobo was delicious, the pork lumpia was also quite good. The whole meal cost $14 (with 2 cans of pop!) and was more than enough food for the two of us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-14", "description": "As I've stated in other reviews, when in SF, I run to Asian eateries because finding such in Miami can be an exercise in frustration. During a recent stay, I was excited to discover how close my hotel was to a Filipino restaurant. I used to eat Filipino food on a pretty regular basis when I lived in Chicago. Since moving south, I hadn't had any. Any. It had been much too long.\n\nWalking in to KNT, there's not a whole lot to look at. It's a small eatery with a cafeteria-style line on one side, cooler on another, TV playing Filipino soap operas (excellent), and a few tables. This is the sort of joint where you breeze in, breeze out and chow down elsewhere. Since I was by myself, it wasn't an issue getting a table. If you have more than you, yourself and... you (?), however, I'd suggest taking the food to go. You'll be cramped. But you'll also be very satisfied.\n\nBehind the line is your new favorite tito, Manny. He truly is the man. Fun, nice, welcoming, and mean on the grill, he'll gladly show you what's going on food-wise. Realizing that this wasn't my first time at the rodeo, we got down to the business of making me fatter. Having not had some of my favorite food in close to a year and a half, I attacked the menu: longanisa, tocino, garlic rice, pancit, and lumpia. I couldn't stop myself. Manny was pleased that not only did I know the cuisine, I came here to do some damage. It's all about respect. Since I, typically, ate my food with a cold San Miguel, I was at a bit of a loss when it came to choosing a non-alcoholic beverage to pair with my grub. Manny hooked me up. He pointed me in the direction of Sarsi. How had I not had Sarsi before? The coloring of the can reminded me of Pepsi but the taste was closer to a birch beer. It was delicious. I'm a new fan. I need more.\n\nWith this trip's meal sending me into a food coma, I knew good things were to come. If in the area for lunch, stop in, say 'what's up' to Manny and treat yourself to some affordable and delicious Filipino fare. Whether you're a n00b or a vet, I'm sure that you'll enjoy what you eat (here's a clue: make sure that pork is part of the meal).", "author": "Johnny T."}

It has two properties I value in an inexpensive restaurant, and which are necessary to make such a place a winner:  Each dish is just a little bit more interesting/exciting than the generic standard for that ethnic dish; and the owner/manager/employees really really care that you ENJOY your meal.  They take the time to explain dishes at the counter, and to give samples.  And they are genuinely nice people!\n\nA few years ago while attending a tech conference in the hotel across the street, my CEO asked for recommendation were to take a couple other high-tech executives.  I explained the nature of the place (styrofoam, linoleum, plastic, just a crowded hole in the wall) but that the food was exciting.  Later I saw them all there, and they were thrilled with the meal.  These were bigwigs with expense accounts who could have gone to a $$$ place rather than a $ place, but they were happy.\n\nThat the owner really CARES that you enjoy your meal is the most important quality of a fine restaurant.

The woman working the counter was very patient and explained to me what each of the dishes were and offered the opportunity to try the dishes before ordering - not many places that I have been to allow you to do that.  It was as if I was a guest at the family table.  I passed on that offer all the same and ordered small portions of the bistek, chicken adobo, and an eggplant omelette.

Though I'm not normally into steam tables/buffets, it was nice in this case to be able to see all the food.  The staff are super friendly and will describe and let you taste all the dishes before you have to make a decision.  Great vibe and experience for a novice to Filipino food.\n\nThe place is divey.  It's very small and cramped and a bit sweaty.  The prices are decent.  Not super cheap but what I would consider good value.  \n\nAnd the food is pretty good too.  It is a bit oily, like most fast food, but it's fine to eat every once in a while.  And it sure doesn't take away from how good it tastes.  Out of all the dishes I tasted I ended up going with the pork soup, and I wasn't disappointed.  I think one dish is enough for lunch.  You can get two dishes if you're hungry.", "author": "Jean K."}

Enormously huge portions, fat intensive mains and enough white rice to feed a bayan.  What a worthwhile indulgence!!!  I find that I can squeeze 3-4 work lunches from only 2 of the 2-item combination plates.\n\nPork Adobo: Tender pieces of well marinated pork belly with the melt in your mouth fat still attached.  You should encourage your server to pour extra of that not-too-vinegary adobo sauce on the rice since such a combination is amazing.  Would have been nice if a few pieces were fried for texture contrast, but still great as is.\n\nPancit: They used the rice vermicelli noodles as opposed to the canton egg noodles.  Packed with flavor.  Great job on making the vegetables (carrots, onions, string beans) a firm, yet not raw texture, and daintily sliced.\n\nCaldereta: Very tender despite being a stew quality cut of beef.  The carrots are just there.  The potatoes seem a bit undercooked.  I used the onion vinegar sauce to add a little personality to this humble dish.\n\nGiniling na Baboy: Reminds me of Indian/Pakistani keema with the peas and diced veggies (carrots, potatoes, green peppers).  Mixes perfectly with the rice as it can disburse evenly on top of the individual grains.\n\nBanana Spring Roll: We've pretty much had this at any Asian restaurant which strives to offer a dessert besides orange slices.  The spin here is a crunchy sugar coating layer on top of the already fried roll skin.  It works, it's tasty.  The banana inside could stand to be a tad fresher though.", "author": "Adam B."}

Small space, but owners were willing to ask people if they'd be willing to share tables with others, which was very nice of them! I ordered Kare-Kare, and I realized how much I missed it! They definitely cooked an authentic Kare-Kare. I also ordered Turon (fried Plaintain) and that was a great move! I only spent $7.20 including taxes, and with that amount of money, I already had a full meal and a dessert. Definitely worth it!\n\nI'm coming back for sure!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-10", "description": "Kusina Ni Tess, my first taste of Filipino food in nearly 20 years, damn near knocked me on my ass. Want the short review? Delicious, flavorful, welcoming, and affordable.\n\nWhen going somewhere new, I always ask an employee what they would recommend. I figure if I don't like something a restaurant is enthusiastic about, I'm probably not going to like the rest of their menu.\n\nWhen I asked this question at Kusina Ni Tess, the gentleman's eyes lit up. You could tell he loved making recommendations. He responded by asking if it was my first time with Filipino food, and after confirming so, said he wanted me to try a couple of things. With around a dozen or so items in their food display, I expected he would have me try one of two of his favorites.\n\n\"Do you like noodles? Try these rice noodles!\" He says while handing me a plastic forkful full of a stir-fried rice noodle, jammed with vegetable goodies.\n\nBefore I even have a chance to swallow, a new fork appears in front of me. \"Here, try this beef steak.\" He gives me a decent sized piece of crazy tender beef steak that was dripping with what I can only assume was liquefied happiness.\n\n\"You must try this pork. I think you will enjoy it.\" Another fork enters the arena, this time with a piece of pork cooked in soy sauce and I'm really not sure what else. \"Damn, should I get that instead of the beef steak?\" I ask myself.\n\n\"I want you to try this.\" Yet again, another fork, this time with a large piece of dark meat. Without asking what it is, I eat it up. He said it was a pork blood stew. At this point, I can't tell if he's really just this enthusiastic about his food or thinking it would be funny to fill me up.\n\n\"I don't want you to make your decision before trying this. Do you like corned-beef hash? This is the Filipino version. I enjoy corned-beef hash, and it was obvious this was a version of it. The biggest differences I noticed were the larger than normal potatoes and the higher than normal amount of... I'm not sure what it was. Grease? Oil? Juice? I really have no idea. It was superb.\n\n \"Have you ever had taro leaves?\" Until that time, my only experience with taro had been taro boba smoothies. I tell him this and that I enjoyed it, but essentially that was a no. At this point, he hands me a fork with a bite of a leafy, creamy, mess. Taro leaves cooked in coconut milk. As I learned from the taro smooth, it's a hard flavor to try to describe. With a texture best compared to creamed spinach, there was most definitely though two very distinct flavors to this dish, both the taro and the coconut, with neither overpowering the other too much.\n\n \"You didn't get to try this one yet\". One more fork, one more hunk of meat. This time, it was another piece of pork, pulled from some stew. It was both sweet and sour, and from what I could tell there were different pieces of fruit mixed into the stock.\n\nI began to order, and started off with the rice noodles. Before I could even choose my next item the wonderfully gracious man says something to another employee and then exclaims. \"The pork chops are done now. Please try this one more thing.\" He turns around, grabs a pork chop and cuts off a piece to hand to me with a pair of tons. Hey, look mom, no fork needed! It was one of, if not, these most tender and flavorful pork chop that I've ever had.\n\nAt this point, I imagine my mind was running wild with options. With a gun to my head, I chose the beef steak to go with my rice noodles. Yup, I ordered the very first two items I tried. Additionally, I ordered some white rice and a bbq chicken kabob. The kabob had been staring me down since I arrived, so that was a must. The beef steak was served in a decent sized plastic container with lots of meat, and a good bit of sauce. I seemed to eat the meat out of the container while pouring the outrageous sauce over my rice. Along with all of this they also gave me a cup of beef broth that I sipped throughout the meal. Meat as a drink? OK! All of this food? Just over $11. \"Git outta town, James!\" I will not, because that's what it cost. An absolute steal.\n\nHeads up, it's cash only. With only 4 or 5 tables (all full when I first entered) you should also be prepared to get your food to go. Still, absolutely worth those minor inconveniences. They obviously love what they are doing and are, with good reason, proud of their food. If you are anywhere in the vicinity of this place, it's a must try.", "author": "James D."}

And when I Yelped for Filipino cuisine places nearby, this place was like the only option.I don't know if it was my initial experience of Filipino food that was utterly too good or every place makes the food differently or what, but my experience here wasn't great at all.\n\nFirst of all, this place is IN THE CUTS. Walking by on this street, which is rarely, I would've never seen this place without any knowledge beforehand that it existed. The store is really small and offers about 3-4 tables to dine at, each with 4 chairs. The set-up seemed a lot similar to a taqueria; with the glass 1/2 window separating customers from the selections of food and the stoves. \n\nBefore even planning a day to come, I researched Kusina's menu and what foods I wanted to eat. I chose a Tuesday because they would have beef steak and pancit. No sisig whatsoever! :[ So i came on a Tuesday around 1:30-2 with a friend to get my craving satisfied. We walked in and perused the selection of foods that were left. No more beef steak. So sad! :[ It was my main reason for going on a Tuesday but the man did say they'd have it again the next day. Only problem was that I wouldn't be coming back. So we ordered ONE order of pancit to share, took the rest of the pork skewers (5), a small order of rice and 2 sodas. It also came with a cup of soup for each of us. Total? 22$. Woow. That blew me away.  But i guess oh wells. I wanted to try it out and now i know.\n\nThe pork skewers were really delicious, yes, but they were very small! Not worth it for what we paid for them. Our pancit was okay, it was so not what I had expected or wanted. It was not the same as the one i had when i first tried it. The first pancit i ever tried had a lemon-y/lime-y flavor to it... The one at Kusina was like just plain white noodles with some vegies and pieces of meat. The soup was alright and tasted a little like hamburgers. Hah, that's probably why I thought it was alright. It looked like miso soup without the tofu and seaweed.\n\nHonestly, I  would not be coming back unless someone convinces me and does a really good job at it. The quality of the food and dining experience in comparison to the price i paid was so not worth it. If you want to come and experience it for yourself, by all means. Don't let my review stop you from trying it out, this is just my personal experience and opinion of it.", "author": "Michael N."}

Leave it to my aunt to find a place that won't burn a hole in my pocket either.\n\nWalking in, I felt like I was going into somebody's home.  I was warmly greeted with smiles from the staff behind the counter, even the cook deep-frying the Tilapia turned his head to smile.   The TV is tuned into the ubiquitous (amongst Filipinos anyway) TFC which stands for The Filipino Channel.   There are a couple of tables and stools for those who want to eat in. \n\nThe entrees on the steamer trays look so enticing:  chicken adobo, ginisang upo, lumpia, Dinuguan, etc.  \n\nWe were all smiles as we put in our order:  Dinuguan (the famous chocolate meat you keep hearing about, ain't really chocolate!) , Paksiw na Bangus and rice.  For dessert, we each had the $1 Banana Que.  (banana rolled in brown sugar and fried)\n\nDinuguan is a stew usually cooked with pig's entrails simmered in pork's blood, garlic, chili and vinegar.  But here at Kusina ni Tess, it's made with pork's meat.  A little bit on the fatty side and it could be more spicier. \n\nThe Paksiw na Bangus is made with milkfish, garlic, lots of ginger, bittermelon, and thin slices of eggplant.  I don't recall this dish being traditionally made with bittermelon or eggplant, but I guess, it's a good way to get your veggie for the day. \n\nThe food here is definitely worth a try, and most of the entrees come with rice.

My favourite was the well-marinated and very tender BBQ CHICKEN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=K6hvMnOPgLoOxCHeDRkSYQ). Another great dish was the CHICKEN ADOBO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=V5i46q0uLZkzPKkl8sI13g), which was vinegary with lots of tender chicken. The DINUGUAN, a pork blood stew (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=qyvbG-mXwjzfVgtzbWGPhQ), had a ton of pork - in fact, it was ALL pork. I actually would've liked to see some snout, ears, and intestines. Flavour-wise it was tasty and vinegary but not the best I've had. The PICADILLO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=IpXhx2tf21QPFRQbmVOPGw) was an aromatic stew with ground pork, potatoes, onions, peas, and carrots. \n\nAs you can see, all we ordered was meat. (Vegetables don't exactly come to mind when I think of Filipino food...) While we were eating, the chef prepared a fresh batch of vegetables and offered us some on the house! Free food? SCORE! We got about half a serving of tasty eggplant, pumpkin, green beans, and bitter melon saut\u00e9ed with shrimp paste (I think, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=ZgebMZj4ih7ppohwK9mp6Q). Like everything else, this was so flavourful, but definitely not as heavy.\n\nAt the end of our meal I realized I forgot to get some LUMPIAS. Being as stuffed as we already were, I didn't want to get a whole order (of 6) so I got a half order for $1.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=3UJ0ZkOLaachSKOqamv5xA). These were made to order so they're guaranteed to be hot and crispy.\n\nThey must have seen my mom and me eyeing the BIBINGKA sitting on the counter, because they offered us a free sample of that as well! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s6x7VDb6qZ__HV1TjnWzKQ?select=USTl04_CDuaRz2rgGG0cRQ) It's a rice flour cake with sliced salted eggs wrapped in banana leaf, which imparted a nice aroma to the cake.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I'm craving Filipino food, especially since I don't have to go all the way to Daly City! Their menu rotates on a daily basis and some things are only available on certain days, so check before you go!

I asked the guy behind the counter for a recommendation and I was a little worried he would recommend me something super expensive (I worry about that EVERYWHERE, so I'm not trying to be racist or something), but he let me try this beef steak thing (I think that's what he said it was).  I thought it tasted great, asked him the price and was surprised it would only be $5.50.  Got that, along with an order of lumpia for $9.22.  Not too bad.\n\nSat down with the beef and rice first as I waited for the lumpia.  The sauce was pretty good, if a little oily.  The beef tasted great, but some of the pieces had large chunks of fat on them.  I just left those parts off, and enjoyed the rest.  So so good.  I devoured almost half my plate before my lumpia came in.  They weren't fresh (saw them take them out of a freezer), but they were still yummy.  Probably one of the best $10 I ever spent.....\n\nDon't let the neighborhood or the setting put you off.  It's really good, and it's GREAT bang for the buck.

It reminds me of small family-run restaurants in Hong Kong, where most customers are regulars and don't mind how run-down it is. They had a television on a Filipino channel, so we got to enjoy some kind of Asian telenovela while we ate. The staff was friendly and did their own thing while we poked and peeked around. \n\nI think we had just missed the lunch rush here, so they didn't have any noodles left. White rice it is! Carbs on carbs. We decided to do this family-style, and shared:\nPork Adobo: I've only ever had chicken adobo before, and this was a lot less vinegary and more gravy-y than what I remember. The meat was really tender and flavourful, and there wasn't too much fat attached. It was, however, kind of oily but it wasn't too bad.\nLaing: Probably my favourite part of my meal. This is taro leaves cooked in coconut milk. It tastes like sweet curry, and it melts in your mouth. Because it's veggies, it feels healthy and it's amazing with rice. CARBS ON CARBS.\nBBQ Pork Skewers: Well, I really like barbeque and skewers, so no complaints here. I would've preferred chicken or beef, because I've never really understood what pork tastes like... \nTinapa: The meat on their fried fish was a little on the dry side, and was hard to eat without really getting our hands dirty (damn flimsy plastic forks), but I really liked how they seasoned/marinated it. Not too salty and the skin was very crispy.\nBeef Stew: This was really bland, and I had maybe 30% of mine. I think they were trying to get rid of it, because there were no veggies and no beef, just broth and oil. Nope.\n\nWe each got a huge plate of rice, and the portions were huge for one person. Everything came to $23, which is really cheap for how much food we got!

The selection, which rotates from day to day, is quite diverse and can accommodate a vegetarian satisfactorily, of which I am not. Otherwise, and this is true generally of Filipino cuisine, the meat dishes are the focal points. For sheer variety this place would make me think twice about going home for a Filipino meal. The chicken adobo was flavorful without being overly salty or vinegary, and now that I've discovered that you can request it to be fried, I'll have to try that common variation as well! The laing we ordered didn't contain any shrimp or meat, just the taro leaves and coconut milk, and was delicious just the same, a very comforting food. The dinuguan was, hands down, my favorite part of my meal, and it surprised my companions with its quality, especially after they'd gotten a sample and brief explanation of what it is (pork butt in pork blood). Our meals came with rice and some \"soup\" which was actually just sinigang broth without the bok choy and beef. \n\nThe location is pretty small and its exterior hardly stands out (despite the bright yellow awning), a real hole-in-the-wall place, but none of this should matter given the delicious and authentic food. And the gentleman (who reigns from Bulacan!) who is frequently at the door is genuinely invested in providing a filling meal. My companions are relatively new to Filipino food and loved all of it. In fact, we bartered over who was going to be taking what after we'd stuffed our faces. \n\nI've been searching for quality Filipino spots in the city since moving here, and though this is actually my first stop, it'll probably be the primary one.

It is sour (as it should be) but it definitely is backed with a lot of flavor from the pork and vegetables in the soup. We also had the Filipino Beef Steak and that was good. I wasn't a big fan of it as it tasted a little sour but my husband loved it. It supposedly tasted like how it traditionally is prepared. The last item we had was giniling which is pork cooked with vegetables and left to steep in its juices. This was really tasty. And it definitely went really well on top of rice. It is a tad greasy but it definitely is quite good. We also had the halo-halo after the meal and it was a little difficult to stir as it was served in a plastic cup.

It was rich and flavorul.  I felt like I was eating at somebody's home back in the Philippines.\n\nI was so full that I had to take a fried banana dessert to go that I promised my sister to taste.

The bill wasn't even itemized at all which made it difficult to figure out what we were being charged for.

The place is a bit run down.. okay hole in the wall, but it has a nice homey feel (like I'm in Southeast Asia!) and it's served cafeteria style. It's nothing fancy, but the prices were decent ($7-9). I had the pork adobo (YUMMMM) with white rice, and when I asked them not to give me too many fatty pieces, they were OK about it! And it's true- they do give huge portions, but I am a glutton, and I devoured all of it. They have other options too, such as fried fish, chicken dishes, stews, and if you don't know, you can point or just ask (they will clarify). The cook/server (stocky guy) was so friendly.

Note to self.\n\nWe found Kusina Ni Tess after some quick Yelping and I would say that most of these reviews are pretty accurate. Very homestyle - Tess was very accomodating and even let me try a few of the dishes before I picked my lunch platter. Noticing my small frame and apprehension to the mongo-load of rice she wanted to dish me, she conceeded to providing a smaller portion. I have never really eaten much Filipino food and found it to be greasy and mysterious, but all around very tasty. I tried the purple string beans with chunks of pork fat paired with a type of creamed spinach in sweet coconut milk. I also had two small bowls of the peppered beef broth which was excellent, but a littly salty. Atmosphere was good, but I had wished it was slightly cleaner. My co-worker had two meat dishes, one chicken curry and the other was an asian style meatloaf. She didn't feel too great afterwards, but I think it was because she ate too much of the fried banana wrapped in lumpia skin for dessert.\n\nAll in all, I liked the experience but will probably not return unless they tidy up a bit. The recipes were good and definitely unique. The flavors reminded me of a blend between southern Chinese cuisine and Indian.", "author": "Nicole S."}

I was working late for a conference, and ran out to get some food here before it closed.  I had tried on two prior occasions (one a year ago) to try the food here, and this was my first successful time.  The only Filipino food I was familiar with was adobo and lumpia, so I ordered pork adobo and lumpia.  I asked her what else was good and she started giving me tastes.  Of everything. (there was no one else in the restaurant at the time).  So I can say that: the taro root in coconut milk is something you gotta try; the orange noodles cooked in cream of mushroom soup, mashed tofu and egg are delish; the chicken something and vegetables are good, the lumpia is so good, the stuff with shrimp paste is yummy.  They have BBQ pork on a stick.  Let me be clear:  BBQ. Pork. On a stick. And, she answered every single question (and I asked a lot) about what stuff was.  So:  very good, inexpensive food and service with more than a smile - Kusina Ni Tess is a winner.  Did I mention the BBQ pork on a stick?", "author": "Cookie C."}

I was feeling a good filipino meal and yelped near Union Square as I was getting into work. All I read were positive and thorough reviews! So, I thought they couldn't fail me! The moment I walked in a welcome greeting came from a friendly man named Manny who asked if this was my first time to visit Kusina Ni Tess. My reply was yes. He then welcome's me and starts off by sending samples my way! I got to try the food before I bought! So I went with the most talked about Laing: Taro leaves marinated in coconut milk. Delicious! As well as the Pork Adobo: A soy sauce and vinegar cooked mixture with pork. Manny then offered to prepare the adobo another way by deep frying the adobo and sampled it for me! He said if you like it prepared this way I will do it for you. But, I preferred the other way. I thought that was extra thoughtful!!! Talk about service. Manny then serves me with the following including a bowl of soup complimentary on the side and free rice refills that I didn't have to go back for with such a generous amount that was served! I had leftovers for my boyfriend to try and he absolutely loved it! Thank you Manny and Tess! I will be back for sure and will bring you business!

Having worked in the Union Square area and now downtown, this is the closest you're going to get to authentic Filipino food where you don't have to venture too deep into cracky territory.\n\nChicken and pork adobo, fried tilapia fish, dinaguan (\"chocolate meat\"), calderada (beef, ox-tail), chicken tinola (soup), sinigang na baboy (pork) or isda (fish) to name a few of the main dishes. The menu varies from day to day, but they often have 6-8 mains to choose from. Lumpia is sometimes on the menu, and WE ALL LOVE LUMPIA!! Just today they had freshly made turon (fried wrapped banana, glazed with sticky sugar)....Scrumptious!! You can get a huge plate of rice and a main dish for $6 even. Add turon or lumpia for another $1, or a tall cocounut or cantelope juice for $1-1.50, for a total of less than $9! That's a deal.\n\nAlthough Tes' Kitchen may not have the expansive selection as the more commercial restaurants like Goldilocks (closest one is in the Excelsior District) or your nearby Jolli Bee's (McDonald's of the Philippines), but this place is simple, more local, and in my opinion authentic.\n\nIt's a small hole in the wall, so it doesn't fit many. Customers are your usual nearby workers from adjacent hotels or local community members. Don't expect ambiance either, you can get that in a ritzy hotel restaurant by the Square. But they do speak ENGLISH for all you non-fluent Tagalog speakers like me.\n\nHours?? I don't know, I've only come here for lunch the past few years.

Every so often you'll find a mom and pop operation somewhere, with mixed results.  I'm glad to report that this place does it quite right.\n\nThe Pros:\nThe Food is great!  They specialize in traditional Filipino family food, they have a menu that rotates, with a set of 5-6 entrees to choose from everyday.  The things to look out for: The bulalo is excellent... and it comes with as much rice and sabaw you want, no extra charge (huge plus!).  The dinaguan is excellent as well (and dinaguan is usually done soooo bad).  And a breakfast of chicken tocino, two eggs over easy and garlic fried rice is why this place is getting a full five stars.  It is crazy delicious.\nThis is the friendliest place I ever been to.   The owner, Manny and his wife run the kitchen and their two young kids are often running around the restaurant somewhere.  Grandma also works in the kitchen.  The have TFC (The Filipino Channel) playing on TV all day.  Manny will make a genuine effort to learn your name the first time you come in, and if you're Filipino, ask you where in the Philippines you're from and generally talk your ear off.  \n\nThe Bad:\nThe food is unapologetically Filipino, and may turn off the random finicky tourist walking in from the Hilton.\nFood is not cooked to order, it's mall food court style.  You can't really do Filipino food any other way though, we're a culture that really likes stew-like things and that takes a while to cook.  They do however cook all day in small batches, it's always pretty much been fresh every time I go, even at closing time.\nAnd that leads to the main bad.  The place closes at 5pm and is completely closed on a Sunday.  That kind of makes it tough for us 9-to-5ers to get here BUT you can call in an order and Manny will have it ready for you to pick up till about 5:30pm.\nThe place is quite small.  It's very clean.  The place kind of smells like fish, but we Filipinos do in general.  Don't laugh.  You know what I mean.\n\nThe Gist:\nTo any Filipino yuppie here in the city, the best way I describe going to this place is like it's a great big hug from you lola, and then she'll feed you and disparage you for being too thin.
