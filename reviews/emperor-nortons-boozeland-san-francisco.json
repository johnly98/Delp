That is what led us to the bar in the first place. It was not the speak easy we had intended but I think we landed where we were supposed to. My sister, husband and I wanted to grab a few drinks to top off a visit to the City. \n\nWith the Warriors win on Friday, taking home a 3rd ring and officially becoming a dynasty, to the passing of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain all in the same week to suicide there was something in us that just wanted to etch some family time in just to check in. \n\nThis place is in walking distance of my mother's place and it definitely did what we needed it to. This place is right on Larkin before you get to Eddy if you are coming from City Hall. To get there you of course side step random homeless people that are either yelling at you or having a deep conversation with a graffiti ridden wall, possible street walkers and you know how on the Vegas strip the ground is littered with stripper advertisement well here in the Loin it's needles, so watch your step! Once you can shake all that off the Loin is what it is..has been for years and at least their consistent with it..ha!\n\nThere's a signage outside the bar that the words \"BoozeLand\" catches your eye before the actual name of the joint which I think may be a ploy and what they wanted you to see to coerce you for your patronage. \n\nYou walk into a dimly lit place, smell of cigarette in the air, music blaring, the bar to the left and a tall, bearded middle aged man comin in hot at you to the right flashlight in hand ready to look at your ID's. \n\nThe bar wasn't crowded, there was a birthday gathering in one corner and I offered my sister and husband to find seating while they ordered our drinks. I found seating for 3 around the corner on the back end of the bar. Which was funny because as I sat there the bartender's came over to me twice to take drink orders. So both my hubby and sister had beers and I wanted to try an Old Fashioned. That bartender was trying to lay a girl out with that drink...oooooooooowwwwwwiieeeee! I asked him to add some more maraschino cherries to cut some of the edge off and he diligently obliged.\n\nThe ambiance is what you would expect of a dive bar. There was a big screen on the wall playing Bettlejuice and the juke box playing an array of genre's to appease the masses regardless of preference, but wasn't so overpoweringly loud that you couldn't have a conversation. Prices are decent for being in SF. We didn't venture off into the back area wherein I was told there was a patio are as well as a pool table. Nor did I have a need to check out their restroom to be able to include in this review but this won't be our last visit I am sure.", "author": "AmErica A."}

A lot of locals in the area just getting a drink, playing pool, and chillin'. Booze was not expensive. $7 for a shot of tequila, a lime, and a can of Modelo.

I'm not sure if Boozeland is in a good or bad neighborhood of San Francisco, but Boozeland itself seems to be a classy sanctuary of an island safely away from the homeless.  Inside its clean casual yet upscale at the same time.  There's a pool table, in the back, and even an outside patio for you cancer loving smokers.  \n\nI love my whiskeys, and I know Red Breast 12 year Irish Whiskey runs about $60 a bottle. So I was shocked and happy that it was only $9 for a very heavy pour of this tasty whiskey.  The barman was extremely friendly   and generous.  \n\nNot sure when I'll ever come back here, but if this was in walking distance of my SF flat, I'd probably be a regular.", "author": "Chun P."}

The whole bar is so meticulously maintained.  Yes, this is in the heat of the 'loin, but hey - only a few blocks from my house so I don't mind walking over to grab a good affordable beer.  The bar is very spacious, seating all around, a couple high tops scattered around, pool tables in the back and even an outdoor patio! Oh also, these are by far some of the cleanest bathrooms at any bar in SF, bravo. \n\nThe bartenders here are always so friendly and attentive. Most draft beers are $5 with a good selection craft IPAs and lagers. I also had the bloody mary on a recent visit and it was fantastic, nice and spicy for a filling booze breakfast.

I came in here in the afternoon, and asked to use the bathroom. I do this all the time with bars while I'm out, and it's never a problem. \n\nThe bartender (older blonde) was immediately weird with me, saying if I took more than 3 minutes and I hadn't bought something they'd send the police to knock down the door.... what? I thought she just had a deadpan way of joking that I shouldn't take too long if I wasn't a customer, so I bought a drink. \n\nApparently the people who run this place have a problem with people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. If you take \"too long\" the owner will send the bartender into the bathroom pounding on the door yelling the police are coming if you don't leave NOW. she honestly gave me a panic attack and I didn't get to finish what I came in, paid for, and tipped her (more than double the price I paid for a drink). \n\nI have anxiety and while I'm trying to figure out wtf is going on, she informs me that I must be doing drugs since I took too long.... ummm, sorry, some of us have medical issues. \n\nHonestly, the owner of this place must be a cruel person. I'm sorry you bought a bar in the TL... don't take it out on people who have chronic illnesses, it's not my problem. \n\nI want to add it was HUMILIATING having not only apparently my time trying to use the bathroom TIMED (after buying a drink) but having an employee come in and start violently banging on the door (scary when your pants are down and you're trying to ), but when I was visibly upset and shaking after literally being scared sh**less, the bartender proceeded to not only berate me and encourage and let a male customer to harass me. \n\nI asked to speak to the owner, and apparently I couldn't. I felt too embarrassed to explain to the bartender in front of the customer why I take longer in the bathroom, I have a lot of anxiety and panic over talking about my illness anyways (it's mortifying as is), and it's something I already have a complex about.\n\nI only wanted to speak to him because I was afraid if I didn't find a bathroom something even more embarrassing would happen.... I needed a bathroom NOW, and so combining that very valid fear, with my anxiety about having to discuss my illness, and my anxiety surrounding people paying attention to how long I take in general actually coming true, AND being frightened while I was in the stall caused me to start crying. Which... of course the bartender and customer decided to insult me for even more. \n\nI ended up having to take a heavy dose of my anxiety attack medication.... ironic since this happened because the owner was so convinced if I took anything more than 3 minutes I must be doing drugs. \n\nI can't cant how mortifying it and awful it was. \n\nWhat kind of freaking pervert times how long women take to pee so they know how long it \"should\" take anyways?", "author": "Tana O."}

Next, the ambience and clientele are laid-back and welcoming, and what's more, there's so much room to spread out. Literally - as there are many different rooms, spaces, and nooks here.

I was in the tenderloin walking up Larkin when i see this awesome little bar. I go in. Simple bar! Nothing too fancy but a great selection. Bulleit on the rocks for me. Cash only?! No worries- i have the fondest memories of cash only bars. Head to the ATM, grab some cash and sit for a drink. The bartender was awesome! Kept the conversation going even though it was a quiet morning and i was running on no sleep. I kept ordering drink after drink. There may have been shots involved. Honestly, i dont remember. I had just kicked off my 3-day party weekend after a very long and hard week at work. Theyve got an awesome pool table in there somewhere. The bar looks dark and quiet, but it is by far one of the most welcoming bars i've been into in years. I started smoking cigarettes (hadnt had one in three years) in their beautiful patio and the cigarette hit me like a ton of bricks. I suddenly needed to crash. C'mon- we've all put ourselves in these situations. I knew i had to get out of there. \n\nI woke up at 11 pm in my hotel room alone with nothing but my wallet. I left my bags, phone, and earphones at the bar. I went back and they were once again very welcoming and had all my stuff!!! The staff were all aware of where all my stuff was and i got it all back. I embarrassingly explained what happened and rather than ridicule me as they should have- they laughed with me and said it happens. I went back to me room and crashed for the night. I fucking love this place!!!!!!", "author": "Elizabeth A."}

UYE's are always fun and I was up to try a new bar in the city.  \n\nUYE + Emperor Norton's Boozeland = good times\n\nI found parking fairly easy about one block away and walked up the block to the bar.  I passed the \"Sup Bro 50\" sign at the Civic Center and I knew I wanted to revisit that spot after a few drinks.  But for now, back to Boozeland.\n\nI walked up to the door and a couple guys were sitting outside, one was a bouncer for sure, and I am not sure who the other guy was, but both were friendly.  I showed my ID and went inside.  \n\nThe place is small, dark, loud--a typical bar.  I found the group in the corner and grabbed a seat.  There were tiny little round high top tables littered throughout the bar with stools and candles.  There is a small set of steps up to an area that houses a pool table and the bathrooms.  There are several TVs around the bar as well to watch the game.  It seemed as if there were three separate areas: 1) the dark and tiny place as you walk in; 2) the billiards area; 3) a larger area on the other side of the bar with bigger tables, more chairs and better lighting (at least it was somewhat better lighting).  The bar is in the middle of the room and facilitates drinks to every side of the tiny space.\n\nBoozeland is a cash only bar; however, none to worry, there is an ATM right there in the corner by the door for all of us people who never carry cash.  I cannot even remember the last time I had cash in my purse on purpose.  It is so cumbersome.\n\nI ordered a martini with a twist, it came out dirty, but that is okay.  I knew I would have another; therefore, the bartender would make my drink right on the next go-round.  I never send back drinks--that is a simple form of alcohol abuse in my book.  The drinks were delicious, strong and priced typical of the area.  \n\nThere is a jukebox replete with wonderful music.  We had fun talking, listening to tunes and greeting other friends as they showed up to the UYE at Boozeland.  At one point, someone suggested that we go to the Sup Bro sign and take pics.  YES--I knew that was how I wanted to end my night.\n\nI met a couple new friends, saw some old friends and had several laughs with everyone.  I really like Emperor Norton's and will be back in the future.\n\nStephani Smiles for Emperor Norton's Boozeland ;)\n#bringcash", "author": "Stephani M."}

The bar offers good drink specials (hard to find in SF), I had my pick of the IPA's for $3 and pitchers were $12, mixed with a ton of space, outdoor patio, and overall very chill vibe. Can't wait to come back!", "author": "Louis D."}

I can't really recommend this as a place to go out of your way to visit though.  Something about it creeped me out a little bit, probably the black wallpaper and suspiciously large stalls in the ladies' room.  Also, if you're not a smoker don't bother going out onto the back patio.  That's pretty much what it's for, I couldn't stay out there for long.  I'd go there for happy hour beers again.  I was pleasantly surprised at the \"not bud\" brews on tap for the price they were offering.", "author": "Diana W."}

The bartender Michelle was the best she not only gave us tips and advice on what to do but she gave us a crash course on the SF culture. I recommend this place to anybody looking for a chill bar during happy hours which is when I went. The place itself is very clean very nice and awesome vibe with cool local characters walking in and out. 5 stars thanks Michelle you are amazing and we loved Golden Gate park if I'm ever back in town I'll make it a point to stop by have some drinks and chat it up.", "author": "Robert R."}

It's so nice to have a cool place to go to in the tenderloin before and after shows or whenever I'm in the hood. It's so awesome that they have an out door area and truly the best bar staff ever. I always feel at home! And particularly the blond girl with the big smile. What a sweetheart! She is the sweetest most inviting girl!", "author": "Curly G."}

We commandeered some corner tables for cards night cause goodness knows my apartment is too small to host more than 2 guests. Noise level is fine, bathrooms are squeaky clean, drinks are good and cheap, staff is friendly and attentive. They even let us order pizza delivery when we realized we were all drunk and hangry. This is definitely going to be a new regular spot.", "author": "Brynn D."}

The front door has images of ballerinas dancing and a creepy mannequin that supposed to be Emperor Norton.  I wonder what this building used to be.

They've got a nice selection of tunes on the jukebox and an outdoor patio with picnic tables and a cool mural of the Emperor himself.    The art deco bar is really something to behold.
