It's not a club with like a secret password or anything. But perhaps I could go into a pretentious discourse about how the purveyors there found a rare vintage that I had been looking for since the Second World War when I was a member of the French resistance fighting the Nazis in the Alsace. Well, first of all, I'm not that old, you Taylor Swift sycophant, and thank you very much for believing that I knew Hitler personally in my youth.\n\nSecond, I couldn't tell a rare vintage from what comes out of a box through a spigot. Tip it, tip it real good. But I do know classier people than me who throw dinner parties that actually can tell the difference. This is where I go at the last minute to find something special and pretend I actually know about wine and how it complements the palate when digesting the meal the host prepared (photo: http://bit.ly/1hhvfUz). The Wine Club allows me to be a procrastinator because first, it's one of the few places in the city with a parking lot. Second, their staff is really helpful with a minimum of direction from me. Here's a sample instruction...\n\n\"I need something red that looks pricey but costs less than twenty bucks. I think he's making meat.\" From that, I've been recommended some truly great product. I also come here for my spirits since their selection is just as diverse on this front (photo: http://bit.ly/1PudYTp). For some reason, I have a stronger opinion on bourbons and vodkas than I do with wines. To develop my palate, I've been to their $5 Friday Evening Happy Hour wine tastings, and that's a great opportunity to sample some new stock in a convivial way, but for the life of me, I can never remember what to get. Thank goodness the staff can. Now about that rare vintage...", "author": "Ed U."}

Despite twice being told that someone would call be back that morning, The Wine Club ignored my calls.  I found this incredibly frustrating--I had tried to get a gift for a family member coming home from the hospital, and their delay meant that it wasn't there when he got home.\n\nOverall, I was severely disappointed in the service here.

They also do formal tastings, though I've never been to one.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and eager to answer any questions you might have. \n\nAs for one reviewer's comment that one should be wary of the \"mediocre wines\". . . well this isn't exclusive to The Wine Club-----just about every wine shop has mediocre wines. That's why you need to ask questions, not be afraid to purchase the occassional lemon and do a little research before you go there (that's just the smart way to purchase wine anywhere). \n\nThe prices at The Wine Club are fairly competitve. .. sometimes they are cheaper and sometimes they are not. . . so again, research (especially if you're buying something to lay down for a few years). As for the lack of windows, I actually like that. It means the sun isn't beating heat into the place through the windows on hot days and that means the wine is being stored at a fairly good temperature. There's nothing that irks me more about a wine shop than when I see good wine being displayed in a shop window as if it were a plant in a nursery. \n\nOne major drawback is their Web site. It can't compare to K&L's because it doesn't synch up to their in store inventory. They have a location in SoCal and for some reason they haven't figured out a way to provide real-time inventory from both locations on their Web site.

Go in and check it out.  \n\nI have found that the staff will leave you alone unless you make eye contact with them and act inquisitive.  I prefer it that way, frankly.  Once you have looked it over, if you have questions, they are very willing to share their advice and opinions.  \n\nSo far, I have not gone wrong with staff recommendations offered there.  (Some of the signs seem a little rah! rah!--typical wine stuff, but the recommendations from the staff have been solid).  This is the kind of place where you can tell them a price point and a general preference, and they will steer you to something good with no worries.\n\nI find the prices to be a buck or two under K&L for most of the stuff I buy.  They have a website if you want to get an idea what they carry.\n\nI have not done any tasting there yet, but they do have a tasting area.  Something to look forward to.", "author": "Rusty M."}

I went to meet up w/some friends and we left shortly after I got there, so I only had time for about a small glass of wine, but it tasted yummy.

Great selection of French and Italian wines and maybe the best Burgundy selection in SF (Premier Cru is in Berkeley). Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable especially David. Will now win an interior decorating award but that helps keep the wine prices low. From $10 Cotes du Rhone to $1000+ DRC wines, you have it all here. Tastings happen every Saturday and you can taste some very good, rare and expensive wines for very reasonable prices but they also pour local wines as well, pretty good mix. \n\nMy only complaint about this store is their online website sort of sucks especially when compared to K&L, but I am reviewing the store here, not the website so 5 stars it will be.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-17", "description": "Much more a sister store to Winehouse Unlimited than nearby K&L--warehouse setting, not yuppified at all (indeed, it has a very homegrown, DIY feel).  Why they would call it \"Wine Club\" and scare away potential customers is beyond me.  \"Wine Cave\" or \"Wine Shack\" or something would be a better bet.  Anyway, there are plenty of cheaper wines and good, creative descriptions, and although it's a little difficult to navigate, the staff are more than happy to help and not pushy or patronizing in the least.  Only downside is that the pinot and syrah I tried, while adequate, were pretty unmemorable, and didn't have the distinctive and delicious taste you can usually rely on from wine stores.", "author": "Wes M."}

David is the main sales contact we have and he is great but the whole staff is knowledgeable and works to find wines that meet your budget. We've had a really good experience with them and the wines they have recommended have been crowd pleasers every time. They have a wide selection from throughout the world so it makes it easy to find wines we like. A lot of folks in our office are wine connoisseurs and will want $60+ bottles but since we can't buy such expensive bottles in bulk, David and others have been helpful in finding a wine that tastes similar or pleases that sort of palette at a more reasonable price point and have been spot on.

I am not a fan of this wine shop.  I have never found the service friendly or engaging believe me I hav tried (which I know is the case in many a wine shop).  I do find some interesting selections and others have been there for years.  I was disappointed in their sherry selection.  K&L has a much sturdier sherry assortment.   Sherry a highly misunderstood wine that if served most everyone would be bracing themselves for a wine they fear; but there are many styles-- and cooking sherry is neither (this is what most think of when they ponder about sherry)--so if your idea of sherry is the cooking kind--that is not what sherry is about.  there are many styles from bone chilling dry to unbelieveable dessert style wines like Pedro Ximenez, Oloroso or Cream.  I digress; I think a wine shop cannot be always about having obvious labels but for a thoughtful assortment that includes things like sherry or gruner veltliner--which I did not see there.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

We had no idea what to expect.  Would it be like Napa/Sonoma tasting rooms?  Would it be seated?  Was it in a separate room?  Would it be a scene?  Anyways, it turned out to be low key in 2 areas on the edge of their wine inventory.  The hostess pouring was very attentive and friendly.  It was crowded but not uncomfortably so.  Although I was expecting the space to be a bit nicer, I kind of enjoyed the casual vibe to it.  They poured some good sparkling wine.  Although I enjoyed it, I'd be interested in going back for a tasting of some red.  Afterwards, I asked one of the people to suggest a bunch of Cabs/Pinot/Merlot.  Gave them the pricing range of $15-25.  We picked up about a case of wines on his suggestion.  I had never heard of any of them.  However, we've gone through 3 or 4 selections and all of them turned out to be GREAT.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
