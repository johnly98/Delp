I have tried one here and there. Meh! \n\nUNTIL------------------\n\nWanting some pretty dainties for a bridal shower, I went on a hunt in earnest for the best Macaron in San Francisco. I tried some at the mall. I tried some at various shops. I tried Miette's. (In the past I'd tried some from La Boulange when it still existed and sold pretty macaron and still I wasn't moved by them.)  I tried faithfully. I bought several colors and flavors everywhere I went. MEH....I probably sank 30-50 dollars in experimentation.\n\nAND THEN...like love when one is caught unawares...I bought some of these Macaron, at Whole foods on Haight. Again, several flavors. The young man there said they didn't handle special orders so I went in search of L'artisan's source and called/emailed Chef Alex. \n\nIt was a busy time of year, the week of Valentines was coming up, and I doubted I'd ever hear from him for such a small order of 35. \n\nA week later I had a message on my phone, I returned it, and spoke with chef Alex. He arranged for me to get mine at Whole foods on Ocean the day they arrived. There was nothing in it for him, other than his good name and reputation which are clearly SOLID! whole foods was making the sale, and yet, he took the time to be sure I got macaron as desired. 35 Raspberry (which I note is not currently available at WF, not sure if that is due to season, or what have you) \n\nThese macaron are like none other I've ever had. (I wish I'd tried Macaron in Paris but did not, I honestly expect they are not as good and can't be any better than Chef Alex's even if good there. ) \n\nThe shells are perfect, a combination of crisp and airy, meets a delicate hint of almost a marshmellow-y under feel, if that term isn't insulting to the culinary result. The flavor in the Raspberry and Strawberry have a  fresh fruit flavor coming through. (Raspberry are my no. 1 because of the hint of tartness there as well)  They are not overly sweet which I LOVE. The pistachio are also good, and I find a cheerful happy place in the Birthday Cake flavor. I have had the buttered popcorn as well, which felt just right as a flavor match but I like the more traditional flavors in general. I particularly like them right upon buying them from  or from the fridge as I like the coolness of the filling. \n\nThe color and appearance are spectacular. They look hand painted, airbrushed almost. Colorful but natural looking at the same time. The detailing on them is charming to behold. I note from the L'artisan website that they do not use artificial colors/flavors, which is no surprise as they taste so refreshingly pure. \n\nSomeone said WF's are not as fresh? Having not had them straight from L'artisan, I cannot compare. Whole foods get's them regularly, and keeps frozen until putting in the case. I've not had any I couldn't call fresh. I did get a plane white one, I assume vanilla, by accident when I was ordering a birthday cake one this past week, and did find it disappointing by comparison to the aforementioned.\n\nIf you hate macaron, try these, try fruit flavors to begin with! But leave some for me! If you love macaron, try these and fall in love again. It's a trip to France without the airfare!", "author": "Susan F."}

I think he's running a one man show. \n\n1. It took about 5 emails, 4 calls, and 2 weeks just to get a receipt.  \n\n2. They deliver! Which is awesome, but only after 2pm. \n\nThis wasn't going to work for my lunch meeting. and I wasn't going to keep them in the communal fridge overnight so they could magically sprout legs or be frozen by meeting time. \n\nI picked them up from the \"storefront' instead. Which sorta felt like a drug deal. \nYou drive out to the Bayview, call Alex up, 5 minutes later he opens the door and brings you in, asks if you'd like something else, say yes, he goes to the back and 15 minutes later he has the stuff, do the exchange, etc. All the while, he has the attitude that I was doing him the favor buying his stuff. \n\nThis whole process took about 20 minutes longer than it should have.

After talking about his creations and other things that float around that brilliant brain of his, I finally realized why he's so great at what he does. Macarons.\n\nHe went into full detail on why he chose the path he went when making his Macarons. It's not like any other. I fully agree and stand on his side with his reasonings. He is a busy man but is very patient with customers. He has a small team but they work hard for perfection. He runs his kitchen. He introduced me to 4 of his favors: orange, almond, raspberry, and pistachio. All were fully equipped with authentic flavors imported only from the freshness of the fresh. \n\nMy buddy ordered the blue box which contains 12 Macarons. The box is one of a kind. It's material is solid and even includes a small note with Alex's signature. He does the best he can to make sure everybody gets what they want and better yet...expectations.

Of all the macarons I've had in the US, none have been able to compare to the Parisian ones in terms of density and favor, but these were amazing.  They're not only beautifully shaped, they're meticulously decorated with special touches like orange zest on the orange one, cacao nibs in the chocolate one.  None of the cookies were cracked or hollow, and none of the flavors are overly strong.  Everything tastes subtle and genuine, likely because he uses no preservatives.  I also like that he offers nutritional information on the products.\n\nI had the chocolate, raspberry, pistachio, orange, and almond ones. Per macaron, prices are typical (~$2 each), but it's a much better value, in my opinion, since they're high quality macarons.

It seems ridiculous to have to order from their website and get macarons shipped to me when I can go pick them up myself and not have to pay the shipping fee...the city is not that big. \n\nSo I called their number and chef Alex picked up (with a french accent), he gave me the address and I proceeded to google map the place. Honestly, if you pull up the address and do a street view, it'll take you to the middle of nowhere and you'll never see a building that says \"L'artisan Gourmet Parisian Macarons\" on it...That is because it does not exists.\n\nI took the muni there anyways because I've heard such great things about these macarons. I called Chef Alex again to verify the address, he told me to not ring the bell but just call him when I arrive at the door...which was a bit sketchy. When I got there with a friend, the area looked deserted and so unfitting for a macarons shop. We finally found number 255 on Mendell Street, which had a sign out front that said Knight Catering Service. I was sure we were in the wrong place but called Chef Alex anyways and in 2 minutes he was at the door and we came in...it sure was a catering service place and I had to ask if he had macarons and he said yes.\n\nWe each got a box of 10 which cost us $20 per box, which contains:\n\n- 2 rose\n- 2 chocolates\n- 2 cranberries\n- 2 raspberries\n- 2 almond\n- and 1 extra pistachio (I believe that was out of kindness)\n\nHe doesn't take cards cause he doesn't have a machine to swipe so we had to pay in cash, hence the reason for buying only 10 each...You can buy 15 for $28 or 42 for $80-something\n\nSize:\n-about and inch and a half to 2 inches\n\nLook:\n\nbeautiful...some like the raspberry and cranberry were dusted pink and red...the chocolate had coco nibs on top, almond was white and had little almond chunks ...pistachio was green and also had little pistachio chunks... and the rose was pink and had rose petals on top.\n\n-smooth surface\n-visible foots\n-no breakage\n\nPresentation: \n\n- plain white cardboard box with bubble wrap on the bottom and tissue paper on top\n- they have a prettier \"blue box\" if you buy 12...I have no idea what the difference is.\n\nTexture:\n\n- the crust was definitely a little thicker than those of Chantal Guillon and Miette (which were very thin) but not as thick as those from La Boulange (which was extremely thick and hard)...L'artisan macaron's crust provide adequate protection but at the same time still soft when bitten into.\n- The inside of the cookie is soft and chewy as it should be\n- The fillings are flavorful, buttery, and creamy...no dripping and not too thick\n\nFlavor/Taste:\n\n- Delicious! well balanced flavor\n- each macarons actually taste like what they're named after...Pistachio is the best!...you can taste the pistachio bits from the top of the macaron, the cookie is not too sweet, and the pistachio butter cream is flavorful and aromatic and melts in your mouth with out being too strong...very fresh tasting.\n- you can definitely taste the subtle tangy flavor of the cranberry balancing with the sweetness and the bits of cranberry really add texture....same with the raspberry, whatever they were dusted with made them so much more than just a plain macaron.\n- the rose was a little too sweet and it was lacking rose aroma\n\nChef Alex was nice, he asked where we heard of his macarons, and seemed to be very confident in his product.\n\nDEFINITELY A MUST TRY!\n\nNote: call in first, sometimes he's not there the address is (255 Mendell St San Francisco, CA 94124) go with a friend....or order online :)", "author": "Tien H."}

It came to the point that I think no other store in America could beat 'Lette, apparently I was wrong! \n\nUntil I learned about L'artisan macarons...\nI am extremely satisfied with the freshly made macarons that were shipped all the way to Los Angeles on Valentine's Day! Placed my order on Saturday night and got the macarons in a well protected package with dry ice and layers of bubble wraps right on Monday. I bet Chef Alex would love his macarons so much - the box has a hand written note \"Please handle this carefully!\"\n\nThough I got the macarons for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day, I was extremely curious about the taste of the pretty macarons in that fancy blue box. So we share a bite on each of them. The macarons were soft and chewy but the shell is still crunchy enough; the fillings were rich but not too sweet. I can say I had orgasm in my mouth instantly. THEY ARE THAT GOOD! \n\nOne more score for Chef Alex: the macarons were well decorated - unlike the ones from 'Lette. I got a blue box with 12 flavors; 2-3 of them are valentine's special flavors (raspberry, chocolate mint?). \n\nOnly one suggestion: maybe next time when I buy a variety box, I would want to know what flavors are included - a note or something would be nice! Other than that, I can't wait to visit chef Alex's store in San Francisco and pick up some fresh macarons!", "author": "Minh N."}

The whole macaron craze has hit the US (from New York to Idaho) and anyone with a pastry bag thinks they can make Parisian macarons.  Many have tried but Chef Alex's macarons are the real deal.  He apprenticed with Pierre Herme - the man who perfected the art of pastry in Paris (and Michel Poliane who makes the most amazing bread in Paris but let's not brag).\n\nTaking a cue from the slim stylish Parisians, I choose to eat only the things that give me pleasure. That said,  I could have eaten a whole box of  two dozen myself. The raspberry flavor was bright, bold and balanced with sweet and tart. The texture was spot on - smooth shell protecting the delicately chew on the inside. It was love at first bite. On the top of my list for macarons in SF, if not the US!  \n\nYou may have beaten my Niners, but I dare New York to beat this macaron.", "author": "Monica L."}

The ones I bought from various places...(Miette, Cocola, Paulette now Chantal Guillion...etc) the taste and texture was just not there...not the same.  I was on a mission to search and now I've found! And she bought them for me!!! :-)\n\nI just finished savoring the expresso flavored macaron (and I'm not much of a fan for anything expresso...cuz it's too strong/bitter) but it is so...effing good! Not only do they look soooooo YUMMY and soooooo pretty to eat, they are actually REALLY good! As good as the ones I had in Paris (Pierre Herme and the famous Laduree). \n\nThe quality and the clean, flavorful taste is cest magnifique!!! Super!  It is so worth it to have it again and again, then a break, then again again.!!

They were great, it was served to us frozen so the first bite was like ehh, but after they thawed for about 10 minutes, the texture was on. It wasn't too sweet, but perfect. Pistacho, Almond, Citron, and Raspberry were the flavors I got. They were all great.\n\nNOTE: this place has no store front, it's in a business area and it located in the back of a catering place. So it's not really a 'store'. Went here after because Paulette was closed for renovation, but I'm glad I did.\n\nThe price IS a bit steep, 15 Macaron minimum - $28.50 for 15.

Believe me people, you will be hard pressed to find a place that makes macarons like Chef Alex.  \n\nI've had macarons in Paris.  In comparison, those macarons aren't even on the same playing field as Alex's.  The reason being, Alex takes an extreme amount of pride in his work.  He makes his macarons from all natural ingredients.  Nothing is pre packaged and there isn't anything that goes into those macarons that isn't touched by his hands.  I know this not because he told me, but because of the saffron I saw all over his sweater when he came out to give me my order.\n\nThese macarons are so carefully crafted and so thought out that when you take a bite, you KNOW that they were made with love.  The result is pure magic.  They are a little on the pricey side but when you try these things, you'll realize that its totally worth it.  Besides, if you love macarons as much as I do, you don't want to cheat yourself by paying less and getting a lower quality product.  Trust.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take the trip to go and visit the kitchen and have a chat with Chef Alex.  He loves talking about what he does.  Also, the kitchen is a commercial kitchen so don't go thinking that there's a sign or a storefront to look for.  The flavors I got (and I didn't have a choice, but they were all amazing) were orange saffron, green tea, creme brulee, rose, walnut, and lemon.\n\nTHANK YOU CHEF ALEX!!!\n\n-Jeremy", "author": "Jeremy I."}

You can really taste the difference in texture and flavor! I placed a question online and he was quick to respond to my inquiry. I ended up ordering 75 macarons for my little girl's 4th Birthday Party. Chef Alex delivered it himself to our home! Needless to say, the macarons were a hit and was adored by all. I'll definitely be ordering from him again.", "author": "Jel O."}

A friend pointed us to L'Artisan Gourmet Parisian Macarons so we headed that way today and purchased a box. We met Chef Alex and he was very enthusiastic and dedicated to producing the best all natural macarons. When we got home and tried the macarons, wow, we believe they are as good as the ones we had at Ladur\u00e9e in Paris!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

I'd been hearing about them for a while, and then finally discovered what all the fuss is about. But I had no idea what supreme heights a macaron could rise to until I tried L'Artisan macarons made by Chef Alex. \n\nHis macarons are beyond words, delicate perfectly delectable treats that explode with flavor. With the very first bite, I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven. Each one is a work of art with gorgeous decorations & details. Got some to surprise my foodie hubbie for our anniversary. It may have been the best anniversary gift I've ever given him.\n\nHis faves: Pistachio, raspberry,  rose\nMine: strawberry poppyseed, chocolate, orange\n\nIf you like macarons, you must try these. If you're curious, ditto. They're absolutely maginifique!", "author": "Lisa M."}

We got the 49-macaron variety pack for a Holiday Party - talk about a hit!  The presentation was so good, and every single variety was packed with flavor. \n\nThey are already becoming our signature hostess gift. If you 'd like something stylish, delicious and easy to share with a group, this is it. It would also be lovely as a corporate gift idea. I love a good cupcake, but they just don't compare for elegance, or ease of eating in a party/cocktail setting.\n\nChef Alex was lovely. The only suggestion I'd make it to ask him to stock them through the Bay Area - or at least be able to order and pick up locally. Congrats on an excellent product.", "author": "Alicia y."}

I told him my budget and he worked with me getting something that would look great, and be enough to satisfy the 30 people expected to attend the party. He managed to deliver the product timely and was professional the whole way through, however I was a bit dissapointed with what I received for the amount of money I spent. However when I showed up with the display, it was a hit. The girl who it was for loved it, and all the macaroons were gone in literarily minutes.

They are tender-crisp, so light and lovely and full of flavor -- you can easily eat several in one sitting without the cloying slap in the back of the mouth you get from other oversugared versions. His are the closest you can get to a trip to Paris without the long flight... and dare I say, rival anything you'll find in France -- in beauty, delicateness and taste. \n\nI'm head over heels for Paris, and have tried many macarons in the Bay area and New York, aching for something reminiscent of what you can get in France. Nothing has compared -- until we found Alex.\n \nIn addition to the incredible cookies, Alex is a kind, accommodating young businessman. He says he's focused on one thing and one thing only: making the perfect macaron. But when you meet him, you realize he's also focused on the customer, and appears driven by the joy he can bring to others through the creation of these delicious bites.", "author": "Laura S."}

I needed EXCELLENT macaroons as a gift for a special occasion today (very tight turnaround) -- called the number, Alex answered and said, 'Yes! Come right over.\" He was extremely accommodating and presented me with a beautiful box full of an assortment of macaroons (chocolate, pistachio, almond, vanilla, orange, raspberry). They are little works of art and taste absolutely divine. I love that he uses natural ingredients and makes his own food coloring. Alex is passionate about what he does and it shows in the quality of his work. \n\nForget Sprinkles cupcakes -- those are so 5 minutes ago...if you want an absolute treat for any special occasion call Alex and these macaroons will be the hit of the party. Apparently he delivers so you just can't go wrong here!", "author": "Valerie W."}

It's like the other review mentioned, how it was unlike the super chewy usual you'd get in the states or in SF.  We've had two flavors so far (almond and green tea) and both were infused incredible flavor.  We picked them up (since I didn't want to pay for the shipping costs, hehe) and Alex was gracious enough to stay late at his kitchen (no store front) to meet us so I could pick up my 3 boxes of 24 macarons each.  He mentioned to us that he uses all local ingredients and all of them are entirely made from scratch, no wonder the flavors are so amazing.  I cannot wait to give them as gifts (and I bought the last box for myself, so I can't wait to try all the flavors!).  They're all so beautiful, too (perfectly uniformed shape, just like the photos on the website).  He packages the 24 packs in cardboard boxes, it'll be easy to bring back home with me on the plane.  And I cannot wait to go back on a regular basis now that I've found a macaron place outside of Paris that I can trust :)  Who would've thought a \"countrywide\" online search for the best macaron would land with a product right in my backyard?  Heavenly yumminess!!", "author": "starrynight c."}

The macaroons have a lovely light texture, and came in an assortment of flavors. My mom would like to point out that Lemon, Chocolate, and Pistachio were particular favorites amongst the guests. I would definitely say these macaroons are comparable to La Duree and Pierre Hermes. In fact, Chef Alex was under the tutelage of those french artisans . These were great macaroons, and i would definitely recommend them. And on top of the fabulous taste, they were also just really beautiful, and I could not praise them enough.

He is an employee of Knight catering and sells macarons on the side. He freezes his macarons so I don't know how long they are stored before they are consumed. Buying from him can be a hit and miss. If the macarons are recently made, they are very very good and chewy but if they have been frozen too long, it can become crispy with large air pockets in the macarons. I have encountered some flavors that are not chewy but crispy instead. I would recommend Christopher David macarons because they are sold regularly and not stored frozen for days or weeks.", "author": "Robert S."}

We've been searching for decent ones here in the Bay Area and I think we have found them. Chef Alex is incredibly nice and clearly has a talent. The macarons were delicate, light, creamy and delicious. Usually the food on websites look much better than they do in real life, but these works of art look just as elegant and beautiful as they do on the website, Each one is decorated with such great care and attention to detail. Every time I had one it made me feel like it was a special occasion. The flavors we had were: chocolate, raspberry, orange, vanilla, pistachio, rose, and coffee (I think). Usually I don't like rose but surprisingly it was one of my favs, just a very light flavor of rose. My friend concurs. And it had little rose petals on top.

French baker Alexander Trouan has perfected the gourmet French macaron on this side of the Atlantic from France.  They are as good as the authentic ones I love from Laduree on Rue Royale in Paris.  I recently threw a large elegant French themed party with French food as the central theme.  I searched high and low for the \"French\" macarons I fell in love with from Paris from my frequent travels there.  I tried all the SF Bay Area local famous French bakers, but still found them all too sweet, too commercial and inauthentic.  I did lots of research until I found Monsieur Trouan.   I called him up to inquire about his gourmet macarons, he very kindly invited me to his gourmet kitchen to see how they were handmade. I saw first hand the passion and love he put into each flavor of the macarons with the high end specialty ingredients he used and  the great pride and joy he took in his master piece.  One taste was all it took for me to be convinced they were the real \"French\" deal I was searching for. It was a French dream come true for me.  One bite of the crisp shell followed by the luscious creamy filling will hit every gourmet dessert sensor in your brain.  I immediately ordered a master case ( 196 pieces) of his macarons in 7 different flavors for my dinner party. I am a coffee and dark chocolate fanatic so they were my two favorite flavors.  You can taste the dark chocolate ( real cocoa nibs) and the coffee in each bite without any sugary aftertaste,  but the lemon, orange and raspberry macarons were also divine with a refreshing burst of the fruit zest on your palate, not to mention the delicious chocolate mint and almond macarons.  The macarons were the buzz at my dinner party.  Everyone of my guests took home the macarons I had boxed up and tied with a French blue ribbon as the party favors.  No one left their box behind because they were so unique and so beautiful in their bright enticing colors and flavors. All of my guests called back the next day to report to me their \"favorite\" flavor and asked where they could get more !!  You have to try them to know the pure joy of these superbly delicious delicacies.  J'adore les macarons de L'Artisan !!!  Vive les macarons!!!  Discover them for yourself !!!
