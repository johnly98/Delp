Quite a few times, I got a wrong order or someone else's order and last week, 10/10, I paid for a full farmer's chicken sandwich but instead got a light (smaller cheaper size portion) sandwich and the chicken mix had 3 pieces of cartilage AND a chicken bone o_O  If I wasn't further away, I would of come back and ask for a refund.

I love getting the chicken & avocado sandwich on a baguette here (but you have a plethora of breads to choose from!), even though the size of the sandwich was pretty underwhelming during my first visit. Sure, the sandwiches here pale in comparison to Ike's hearty sandwiches, but Grain D'Or does not skimp on the avocado. The pesto mayo on the chicken & avocado is heavenly. And I don't even like basil, but I loved this flavor combination.\n\nI haven't tried any of the bread here, but I've seen plenty of people purchase freshly baked loaves. The cinnamon danish twists were a perfect post-lunch snack and not too sweet either. Service was incredibly friendly.", "author": "Amy C."}

I tried to find evidence of their merger, but strangely there's absolutely nothing about it if when you Google it. It's like a bad TV-movie from the 1970's when the first wife goes missing and the suspicious husband is suddenly married to the high school Lolita who has assumed the first wife's name. I think it starred Bill Bixby and Barbara Eden. OK, I made that up. But it is strange since they have almost identical menus. Oh, who cares? My focus was getting something to eat before venturing deeper into the Marina on a brisk Saturday morning.\n\nEven for a weekend, I tried to be good and ordered the $6.75 Vegetarian Feast, a crusty sandwich slathered with Dijon mustard and mayo with lettuce, sprouts, tomato, cucumber, fresh avocado, and provolone cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/2dli3Qq). It was pretty good, fresh and just like the one I usually get at Andersen's, so I wasn't disappointed. Alas, sitting in there was probably a mistake because I weakened and bought a $2.50 Almond Cheese Bun which I devoured in a nanosecond (photo: http://bit.ly/2cvoH4S). So even if it was an Andersen's Bakery in disguise, this quick stop certainly met my carb-infused needs.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a veggie sandwich that met my momentary detour into good dietary sense\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...gee, it sure feels like an Andersen's Bakery\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...merely serviceable\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a quick bite that works in a pinch on Clement", "author": "Ed U."}

Today my girlfriend and her mom had hair appointment plans in the morning so I thought it would be a good idea to find a cafe with Internet access while I wait. I had to do some online study for work anyway. \n\nUsing my trusty app I found two cafes nearby the hair salon. It was either Cumaica or Grain D'Or. Cumaica sounded like a nice small coffee shop, but too small if I wanted to linger for a couple hours. So I wandered a few steps over to Grain D'Or. What a pleasant surprise. \n\nThere was plenty of space, nice comfy bench seats and speedy and most importantly reliable Wi-Fi Internet access. The employees work hard, and I often see them running (literally) back and forth to clean up vacated tables and drop off caffeinated drinks. \n\nThey have fresh baked goods, including pasteries and breads. I got the blueberry muffin. It was nicely sweetened with fresh blueberries and crumbles on top. I needed a 'pick me up' so I ordered the iced coffee. It is not anything fancy, but you can tell it was freshly made and brewed without that burnt taste I get at many coffee shops. It was a very good compliment to my muffin when washed down together. Mmm. The simple things in life. \n\nAfter a couple hours of interrupted study thanks to me having Facebook running in the background, I got a good study session in, and my ladies look good with their new 'do'. Highly recommended for a nice stay in an unpretentious coffee shop in the middle of a busy Clement Street neighborhood.", "author": "David K."}

This was the kind of day where precision and focus reigned supreme, far outweighing those inner desires to both dilly and dally. On a street where distractions could reign supreme (what's with all the local gift shops and bookstores popping up, not that I'm complaining) it was a day for getting stuff done, and doing it quickly.\n\nWe thought this was the perfect lunch. Pop in for a quick bite, and get back out to the garden center, zip across town for more errands, and try to avoid the rain along the way.\n\nIt was promising to begin with. We had a short line. We made up our minds, and ordered from the new guy at the register. I cut him some slack, because he was clearly new, but it wasn't exactly the model of efficiency we'd hoped for. Still, a couple of sandwiches and a kouign amann were on their way.\n\nIt was another slightly longer wait, and our food was ready. We got the kouign amann at the counter, actually, and waited for sandwiches. I had high hopes for the blueberry pastry, but it lacked the depth, development, and both the butter softness or outer crunch that make this pastry so special. I'd skip it next time.\n\nThe sandwiches came, and I scarfed down the turkey avocado. It's not fresh turkey breast, it's sliced deli meat. So, it's fine. The BLT across the table looked like a better order, and I'm told it was. \n\nNot exactly the zippy service we'd hoped for, nor the deliciously satisfying lunch. But hardly a disappointment in the big picture. It's a solid stop. Fine. Satisfactory. No complaints here.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I would rate this place a 1 based on customer service. However I could never bring myself to hurt someone's business, it's just not right. \n\nFirst and foremost, I must tell you that this is my favorite place to get a sandwich in Mountain View. The food and pastries are always incredibly delicious. I look forward to coming here  specifically for the food. They have an amazing product! The only thing I dread is walking in and having to wait. There is usually just one person that is tending to clients and she usually is not in sight. It is usually a woman of Indian decent. Not to point out anyone's race as everyone is the same to me... just for the purposes of specificity. \n\nShe never smiles and always looks incredibly put out to take your order. I can't tell you how many countless times I have come in and waited 20 minutes just to be acknowledged and have my order taken. While I am waiting for my order people come in and wait and get frustrated and leave. Not just one person but several people. \n\nThough they close at five, this woman usually starts putting things away at 3:30. People will come in and see that there are no pastries and walk out. I wish this could be different as I don't want this business to leave. They could have such a booming business if they just spent more time training their employee/s  on customer service.\n\nA few or 2 years back, they had this young gentleman that was incredibly customer service oriented.

Ok???? So I have to do on line or come in...well.. cannot go on line since I am driving. Went in and proceeded to tell the Asian guy that I need a cake with a writing for Birthday.

I can pay for it first and come back after they are done writing on the cake. He shut my idea down by telling me that they don't have a tool to do that.

I ordered a twisty thing that supposedly included saffron, but in the end tasted liike the bland, mass produced danishes that are routinely provided in the exhibiting areas of conferences i attend during the course of the medical research I conduct. My wife was not ovely impressed with her ham and cheese croissant, but far be it from me to usurp her own opportunity to yelp this joint; she often overrates (at least in my opinion) places that I (in her opinion) underrate, to balance things overall in the overall cosmic allness of everything.\n\nConcerning the coffee, I thought she stated it tasted like someone had \"run a concubine through it\" -- at least that is what I heard, being somewhat hard of hearing. She corrected this later on, and stipulated that what she had actually said was that her father would have said the coffee tasted like someone had \"run a coffee bean through it.\" Concubine, coffee bean, what difference does it make? I will not be seen in Grain D'Or again, because food art is to be seen, not eaten.

I also love the classical music.\n\nUnlike nearly every other place in San Francisco, the workers here are thorough and POLITE. I mean, genuinely polite, and it's not because they are speaking in a language that I don't happen to speak; I've never even accidently caught them making tmi personal remarks at each other or acting grossly unprofessional and thinking they're \"cool\" for it. No, they are actually talking at a moderate volume about something other than getting trashed or making fun of the last person who came in. The men and women here have been well trained and happen to be attractive to boot -- not that they act full of themselves because of it. Seriously, that alone is a minor miracle. It's probably not fun to wear the cute uniforms, but you all do it well if that's any consolation.\n\nEnough about the people, on to the food. I regularly stop here for a fresh sandwich -- their chicken salad is a little sweet for me, but now you can custom order it on non-raisin bread. It's also nice to get a selection of veggies.\n\nTheir espresso is always well prepared. I've not been cheated or gotten something barely drinkable -- it's FRESH, the machine is CLEAN. Just make sure to ask for a small cup or you may get an difficult to drink overflowing shot cup! The juice selection is always cold and well stocked (Naked or Odwalla, plus non-smoothie varities). I tend to also like this with a sandwich. They have chips. They also have tasty BAGEL chips in big bags.\n\nIt's true, their pastries are not the best (though fresh). However, they are by far not the worst either. C'mon, most coffee shops are selling Costco goods. And I'd say their BREAD is excellent. As a child I could hardly get enough of the round ones with melted cheese inside (which one may ask to be sliced). Buy any loaf, take it home. Make up your own mind. Bread freezes and toasts, it's a simple luxury in a tired day.\n\nOften they have samples out, a terrific way to find a new flavor.\n\nOur family is particularly fond of things done with sesame seeds -- surprisingly tasty on a loaf. We like the whole grains too. We also like the red bean baked goods and bread. ORDER THEM! :D\n\nTheir pastries are not overly sweet -- true to EUROPEAN standards. My family prefers this as well. However, if you do like sweet, the raspberry cream is probably for you. Their blueberry or strawberry danish are excellent -- puff of crisp pastry, touch of real fruit, hidden layer of modest custard and a drizzle of icing. Strawberry shortcake is fun, and one day they were out of slices and the young woman thought nothing of offering to cut up the last cake to fill the order. So, I bought more than one slice and nicely tipped.\n\nMy only quibble -- I need to use a bathroom.", "author": "Ziggy J."}

The baked goods looked ok but nothing that screamed for attention.\n\nThe place looks white and artsy and perhaps their cakes are delicious but maybe we'll venture back....", "author": "Yan M."}

They offer the same delicious cheese breads I love, but with a more spacious and relaxing atmosphere than the downtown branch. As previous reviews have noted, the ladies that work there are super nice and accommodating. \n\nMy favorites are the international cheese bread, pesto cheese bread, and cheddar cheese roll. I always get the bread sliced because it is easier to eat and share. They will also heat up your cheese bread and it is quite tasty this way. \n\nThey offer specialty coffee drinks but they aren't very good. Go for the fresh juices or save some cash with drip coffee. \n\nThis has become my favorite hang over salvation stop on Saturday and Sunday morning/afternoons.
