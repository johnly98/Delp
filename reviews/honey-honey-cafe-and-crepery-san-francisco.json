We got the baklava crepe to split and our own savory crepe prior.  I got an off menu special in Philly cheesesteak crepe, it was good, I switched the cheese from Swiss to provolone.  It was heavy on the peppers which I picked a few out, but didn't have onions which I was glad about.\n\nMy wife got the eggplant crepe, it had sun dried tomatoes, garlic, & cheddar cheese, I tasted it and it was good.\n\nThis place has a line out of the door anytime you come for breakfast on the weekends.  A good sign obviously.

The staff is extremely friendly despite the constant rush. \n\n(This might be helpful if you have social anxiety) \nWhen you first enter, you are greeted with a vast and colorful menu. Each seemingly written in chalk with beautiful handwriting and descriptions. When you get closer to the front, the staff will assign you a number and that number will correspond with the table number. The table numbers are easy to see as they are standing straight up. (Although I think this only happens when it's busy. When it's not, they will give you the number and you will pick your own seat) When it's your turn to get order, it's really simple. Just state what you want and that's it. No biggie. The water will be on your right and if you ordered coffee, the stuff for that will be on your left along with straws and such. \n\nI ordered a (seasonal special) of peanut butter crepe with bananas.

From the time we walked in, it was a 15 minute wait to order food at the counter. Finding a table was a little worrisome as people were leisurely enjoying their brunch/lunch and not getting up in the normal fashion that these places normally work. We enjoyed the savory eggplant crepe as well as the strawberry Nutella crepe. Both were very good, if you are in the area it's a good quick spot!", "author": "Taylor S."}

Was it because there were no open tables? Nope - there were plenty.  There was one cashier/order taker that doubled as the barista and bartender for whatever drink you ordered.  She would touch money and touch your order and never washed her hands.  I am not saying the hair I had in my water cup was hers, but it was no surprise.  \n\nTo quote my son, \"If the food was good, it would be worth the wait, but it is not.\"  Another good quote from my son who ordered a $3.95 side order of fruit that came out with 2 sliced strawberries, 4 slices of banana and one slice of kiwi, \"did they want me to think i got a whole banana by including 2 ends?\"  \n\nNeedless to say, the service, food and cleanliness of this place were all poor.  The line out the door exists because Serivce is slow and there are so few breakfast places in the area, not because the food is good.  Ignore the concierge that sends you here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-05", "description": "When I first arrived at around 10 am on a Sunday morning, I noticed the line went out the door. I was reluctant to wait in line since there were about 10 -15 people waiting in line outside and the weather was a little chilly. There were also a lot of people waiting inside the restaurant. However, I really wanted to eat savory crepes especially since I had a great experience eating \ncrepes at Higher Grounds Coffee House in Glen Park. \n\nI decided to wait in line anyways. It took about 1 hour for me to get to the front counter. The employee assigned everyone a seat while we were waiting in line. When it was time to order, I selected the Mediterranean Crepe ($11.95) and chose salad as my side dish. \n\nThe food arrived pretty quickly despite how full the restaurant was. I want to say that I waited for about 10 minutes after being seated. \n\nIn general, the crepe was good and cheesy. It looked like the employees may have rushed while making the crepes though. Some of the toppings were not sliced very well. For example, I got huge onion and tomato pieces. The onions were very raw. Luckily, I love eating vegetables. In addition, I saw a weird bulge in one part of the crepe. When I cut it open with my knife, I noticed it was a huge chunk of feta cheese about 1.5\" to 2\" in diameter! I was also given only two  artichoke pieces. \n\nI was a little disappointed about the salad. The salad looked like the cheap, generic salad mix you can get at Safeway. It was a bit dry and I wished I got the potatoes or fruit side option instead. I tried my friend's potatoes and found it to be delicious! It was super crunchy and had a lot of seasoning on it. I also noticed the fruit side option to look very fresh. I saw tons of thin strawberry slices. \n\nIt was nice seeing that there was free Wifi in this restaurant. I would not come here to study though. It's a bit noisy. \n\nI may come back here, but I would prefer going to the crepe place in Glen Park instead!", "author": "Kristina M."}

I went on Thursday afternoon so the place wasn't busy at all but I couldn't see how it could get crazy during the weekends.\nMy only complain would be their tables. I am not the tallest person ever but I was very uncomfortable as the table was SUPER low. I literally had to fold over to be able to eat and my knees couldn't even fit under the table so I had to push it further away. \nOverall, an average breakfast place.

We ordered the crab cake Benedict and the salmon scramble. My fiance liked the crab cake benedict but I found it too \"fishy\" like the crab wasn't very cooked or something. The salmon scramble was pretty disappointing in both quantity and taste. There were just some pieces of partially cooked smoked salmon tossed with some scrambled eggs. The potatoes were well seasoned though.\n\nThe peanut butter Smores crepe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side was delicious. There was so much peanut butter and it went well with the melted marshmallow. The vanilla ice cream was so good (I think it had real vanilla bean). I'd probably come back just for crepes.", "author": "Christine L."}

She had ordered the Crab Cake Florentine, and I the Salmon Benedict. While both our meals were plated very nicely, and looked delicious, that was not the case. Both of our dishes poached eggs were over cooked, almost to the point being hard boiled eggs. The dishes were cold, and the hollandaise was bland. \n\nI asked the food runner if I could reorder the eggs on side, cooked properly, in which he actually re-fired  my entire meal. Sadly the re-fire was not much better. The eggs were undercooked, muffin was soggy, and again cold.

When the cashier announced the total, it was significantly lower than what I anticipated and I told her so -- MISTAKE. I said, \"I think you undercharged me. I was expecting it to be around this amount.\" She just looked at me and said, \"oh, okay.\" And then proceeded to charge me an extra $30. She didn't go over the receipt, didn't try to figure out what went wrong. Just straight-up added $30 to my already-incorrect bill. \n\nThere was a HUGE line behind me and she clearly did this just to speed things along. I said \"I don't think that's right.\" And she just looked at me and said nothing, as if somehow it was my fault I was holding up the line. I went ahead and paid and calculated everything later. This place straight-up stole $4 from me.\n\nI'm not going to make a big fuss over $4, but I certainly won't be back here. I paid EXTRA MONEY because I was honest!

I went with a waffle with fruit on it and it was delicious. It wasn't a cheap breakfast but I enjoyed it.

The chorizo scramble was pretty tasty and came with potatoes and toast. I would recommend getting the regular chai tea instead of the iced. This place is great for breakfast and brunch!", "author": "Ismael P."}

We waited about an hour to order... and total time until we actually ate from line to food was probably 1.5 hours. MAKE SURE YOU COME EARLY. You are assigned a table when you order so don't expect to have someone in line while you find a table to sit at. \n\nHonestly, I'm not too crazy about it. Their menu has a lot of options, and I saw one special that caught my eye... peanut butter crepe which included pb, marshmallows, Rice Krispies, and chocolate syrup. I added bananas to it just because I like bananas and pb. Fianc\u00e9e ordered the 2/2/2 deal, and paid an extra $3 to add a few pieces of sourdough toast.\n\nThe crepe that I had kinda annoyed me. It was folded which is expected, but literally one side was all peanut butter and the other was bare with just the marshmallows... there were a few bananas in there only on the peanut butter side. I probably would have enjoyed it more if everything was mixed together then folded. And it was basically only lightly drizzled with Rice Krispies and chocolate syrup, I was expecting the Rice Krispies to be inside the actual crepe. The latte I ordered wasn't too bad, and it's nice they have complimentary lemon mint or orange infused ice water available. \n\nThe Fianc\u00e9e's breakfast was two eggs medium, two bacon, and two pancakes. She liked it, but basically was similar to IHOP in terms of quality and taste.\n\nI think this place probably has really good food... maybe we just chose poorly. I would try this place again and maybe order one of the omelettes or specialty crepes that they have there.", "author": "Brian J."}

The bread for the veggie sandwich was too thick and not toasted and the sandwich as a whole lacked flavor. The potatoes which came as a side for everything savory I ordered were not good!! They lacked flavor, were mushy and not crunchy at all...and it's difficult for me to not like potatoes. The Mediterranean crepe was pretty good but nothing so special to come back here for.

We stayed three days and ended up coming back all three days. Lines usually go out the door at breakfast time. \nIt helps that the menu is right on the wall so you can make your selections while you wait. I had a hard time choosing my dishes because everything looked , or rather sounded so good. I had a chorizo omelette with home fried potatoes, and it was to die for! I also had waffles with strawberries and  cream cheese topping, and eggs Benedict. YUM!\n \nThe place is very rustic and simply decorated. It reminds me a little bit of Panera but more cluttered. it is on the messy side because of the sheer amount of people that come and go. It is very hard to get a table, so when you do you grab it and hold on to it for dear life. Great food at very affordable prices. It is a must!!", "author": "Tairyn A."}

After wandering to Coit Tower and building up an appetite, my friend and I looked on Yelp for places near Union Square to have brunch at. We found Honey Honey and looked at the Yelp photos and decided the crab cake florentine looked good (and we were starving and tired of walking). \n\nWhen we got there, the line was out the door. We'd wait in that line for another 30 minutes before having our order taken. When we finally got inside, there were four menu boards with many items. It was at that point when my friend and I realized we'd been here before and hadn't been impressed. However since we were hungry and because of other positive reviews, we decided to stay. \n\nWe both ordered the crab cake florentine which also included a side of country potatoes. The presentation of the dish was definitely photo worthy and the poached egg was nicely done. However, upon eating the crab cake I was turned off. It was pretty salty and fishy tasting. At one point, I even ate a shell and had to spit it out after hearing it crunch between my teeth. \n\nSo why 2.5-3 stars? The service was excellent. The place is small and so I was concerned about finding a table but they indicate where you can sit when you're about to order. Once we ordered, we only waited maybe 7 minutes for our food to come out. The poached eggs were done well though one was more runny than the other. I did like the seasoning on the country potatoes. \n\nMy friend felt a little sick after we left and we don't know if we can attribute it to her dish.

For whatever the reason something caught his attention. To our horror he pulled out an insect about half an inch long that resembled a cockroach/cricket. Long legs and definitely some sort of wings.\n\nHe pulled it out of his potatoes and we calmly got the attention of a man who seemed to be the manager or head chef (not sure). He came over, looked at the bug on the table which we explained was in the potatoes and without saying a word went and summoned the cashier. (Not even an apology or sign of some sort of shame or remorse that this is the food coming out of his kitchen.) The cashier came over to our table and when we showed her the bug she at-least apologized and offered us a refund. \n\nNeedless to say, we took our money and left. I have never had such an experience. I would truly reconsider coming and eating at this establishment. \n\nDisgusting to say the least. Clearly, there is an issue with kitchen cleanliness and that's a problem.\n\nI truly regret not taking a photo of the bug as initially I wasn't going to come on here and write this review. But it would b a disservice to anyone coming to eat here and not making them aware of the posible risk.", "author": "Desiree Z."}

Kinda weird set up overall as the massive line to order extends throughout the restaurant and winds by your table while you're eating. \n\nThe bench seat tables are also very awkward - high benches with low tables, so your thighs are kinda squashed while eating. \n\nSo, I got the breakfast crepe, which was pretty good - not long-wait good, but a hefty amount of eggs. I appreciated that they were able to make substitutions with no extra cost as well. Husband got the croissant sandwich - the side potatoes were the best part (seriously, they were some of the best O'Brien potatoes ever) unfortunately; the sandwich itself was very underwhelming, with runny eggs and a croissant that looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for a few days. \n\nOverall, wouldn't recommend.", "author": "Leanna W."}

No table saving. \n\nOrdered the Half Moon Bay crepe with crab cakes, tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms. For being a crepery, I wasn't impressed. The crepe was too thick and crispy. Also it was just OK tasting.\n\nWe also ordered Belgian waffles with strawberry, banana, topped with whipped cream. Nothing to write home about, but it was pretty good. \n\nSomething to note, there was this couple near us that didn't get their food until after three other tables received theirs. When they inquired about it the guy who was seating everyone said \"Has it been 15 minutes? You have to wait at least 15 minutes.\" He then proceeds to look at their ticket and it has been more than 20. No joke he leaves comes back with more food for other tables, then comes with theirs. No apologies, no explanation, nothing. The couple wasn't angry or made a scene either.  Seems they want you in and out as fast as possible. Also, he came by later and asked if we were done and then just took our plates. I was still drinking my water and would have liked to finish the last bite. Whatever though, that's just me. We were basically done. Also he shoved an entire party of 8 in a corner and the couple sitting next to them made room so they could be comfortable and not crammed.

She told us to get up from our seat for no reason. She said her boyfriend is coming and likes that seat. Who the hell cares? Why is any server has a right to reserve a seat for someone who is not even in the restaurant? Also, this place is not a restaurant where a server brings you to a seat. You just order and find your own seat kinda place. Okay it bugged me major time and kind of ruined my brunch mood.\n\n2. Hiccup two:\nWhen the old man who brought our dishes said \"hope you can down them all\", which was weird. Who says that? How about 'enjoy your food'? Service doesn't even deserve 1 star. So beware. \n\nBUT....\n\nWhen you put the meal in your mouth... Oohh aaahhh.

The menu is huge--savory crepes, dessert crepes, omelets, pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, as well as lunch items. The seating process is a little confusing. The line went out the door & moved slowly. What happens is you wait in line for a table to open up. The huge menu is up on the wall as you wait in line so you can mull over what to order. As you get close to the counter to order, a host will ask how many are in your party & assign you a table with a number. When you order & pay, you tell them your table number. Then you immediately sit down & just wait for your food. The food came relatively quickly & hit the spot. We each had a crepe--the half moon (which was the least favorite) & the breakfast crepe (which was yummy) & we shared the pecan pancakes which were amazing, by far the standout of the meal.", "author": "Andrea R."}

The potatoes are doused in parsley. I guess the cooks are a little heavy handed with the parsley. Understandably used as a garnish, but not as a main spice for potatoes. They were completely overpowered. The eggs were eggs and the toast looked like it was suffering from identity crisis. Two-thirds of it was still bread and one-third of it actually progressed to toast. The chicken sausage was a mistake.

My only qualm about doing so is I'm not certain I can be completely fair to this restaurant, but you only know what you know. I came in a few Sundays ago after reading great reviews. I live out of town and had just completed a 10K, so I was hangry! I expected to wait since I'd read the reviews. I was standing in line for an hour before I got to the counter to order. Yes, it was a Sunday, and yes, I expected the wait. What I didn't expect was the miserly portions. Ok, so maybe my hanger had something to do with that. I ordered 3 pancakes, scrambled eggs, and a pot of tea. My bill was $19! I know this is San Francisco, but please! I probably wouldn't have minded so much if the 'cakes were those large luscious ones that could be used as a Halloween mask if you poked holes in em. But no. These little airy wisps covered in a sprinkling of powdered sugar were made for a high tea or something along that line. Not for a hangry runner! The eggs were fine & the tea was great, but please. \n  Now I can see some saying I didn't taste enough of the menu to post. I agree the many different crepe options looked stellar. But sometimes a lady just wants a big ol mess of pancakes..and nothing less will do. Sorry Honey, Honey. You meant well.", "author": "Diane K."}

We stumbled upon this place since it was just down the street from our hotel. \n\nWe were looking for a breakfast place around 8 am and saw this and decided to get in a line we didn't realize that this was a top rated local favorite. After reading reviews we decided we had to give it a try and thank goodness we did!\n\nYes, there was a line and the wait was an 1 to 1.5 hr but it was well worth it!!!\n\nWe ordered the Crab Cake Florentine Benedict, Peanut Butter Crepe, side order of Apple Chicken Sausage, Iced  Chia Latte, Orange Juice. \n\nLiterally my mouth is drooling just typing out our breakfast. Everything was so good from my iced chai latte that I finished in .5 seconds. If they offered an IV of it I would highly consider it. The orange juice was fresh you see them make it when you order. \n\nThe BEST, outstanding, amazing, delicious Crab Cake Florentine Benedict I have ever had. The portion is huge I couldn't finish my plate but I appreciate the size of everything served. They nailed this dish...to be honest they nailed everything they serve here! \n\nWill be back and ready or a round two of brunch!

The menu is HUGE so there's something for everyone, and you won't get sick of it because there's so much to try! I am one of those people that tends to stick to what they like once they find it, but I wanted to try so many of their dishes, so I'd be down to keep exploring their menu. Major OVERLOAD. \n\nAMBIANCE: stand in line to order food, then find a table and they bring the food out to you by order number. The restaurant is adequately sized, but it could be larger based on the size of the crowd it draws. When it gets really crowded, it might be hard to find a table, but the turnover is quick. The server was really nice and took our tardy party member's order so that he could sit with us instead of making him stand in the long line since we had already ordered and were waiting for the food. \n\nFOOD: CRAB CAKE FLORENTINE EGGS BENEDICT (10.95). As all the other reviews have said, this dish is bomb. Gooey eggs, creamy hollandaise, crispy (real) crab cakes, spinach!! YUM. The New Orleans crepe (9.75) was good too- sundried tomatoes and chicken breast up in here! They have everything, from pancakes, to scrambles, crepes, to sandwiches and pasta! \n\nSERVICE: As I mentioned, you typically don't really interact with the servers that much except when they bring out your food, but we had a really good experience with the staff who went out of their way to help us.

The line was extended halfway through the restaurant, we were like the fifth table in line.  Restaurant is half empty. The line didn't move, the cashier probably took one order every 5-10 minutes. I'm so confused why I keep seeing people write that they have a good system. The Runner/Waitress spends more time asking people to not sit down in seats than she does doing the important part.  We spent 40 minutes in line and 10 minutes waiting for food. How can this place make money? Literally took 40 minutes to get drinks and orders for five parties?  The food isn't even that good...at all.  Also you tip before you receive service, and you don't actually get service.  Super weird focus is more on following this strange system than actually feeding people.  Then, they shut the doors and make people wait halfway down the street.

Yes, they're busy, so they're crowded, but when a customer complains, or asks for something different because they don't like what you served them,and there is MORE than half their entree on the plate, the answer is not \"I'm sorry.\" And brush it off, you work to correct it.  Instead the young gentleman (I do believe he is the owner's son) simply didn't want to be bothered with the woman's complaint.  In the end, the other gentleman (The guy who seats you) spoke to the matter and they got the situation fixed, but PLEASE, hear your customers out, or you won't have them, No matter HOW good your food is. \n\nSpeaking to the food: We ordered the Breakfast burrito, a Park Omlette & a Strawberry/Nutella omlette.  The Breakfast burrito was -humongus- It was Gigantic, and the flavours were nice. BUT... the black beans it was served on? They were cold.   The omletle was large as well, served with a side of fruit: the eggs on the outside were warm and fluffy, but the filling was barely hot. *Shrug* Still, very tasty and the fruit - especially the strawberry & bananna was SO GOOD.   \n\nAnd the Nutella/Strawberry Crepe ... This.. This was heaven.  Their crepe was fantastic and I would go back, I would brave the line and the rudeness I saw.   JUST... For... This!\n\nPs: Please, Please have your wait staff wear deoderant. Body odor when a server delivers food is unpleasant.", "author": "Dianna B."}

Okay, so which one's better??\n\n~ O r d e r ~\nCrepe I tried was just okay-ish. I ordered the Eggplant Crepe, veganized (no cheddar), and I completely understand that it would've tasted better without the omission. The crepes themselves weren't very different from Crepevine's; texture and taste were roughly the same, but I felt that Crepevine serves larger potions.\nLike Crepevine, each crepe entree comes with your choice of potatoes or fresh fruit (for an extra $1.50). I went for the potatoes, which were nothing special; they def could've used some more seasoning.\n     \nHoney Honey is pretty easy to spot bc it's painted bright yellow, and it's furnished with some... interesting(?) decor. Honestly wasn't sure at all what to make of the design, and the tables were a bit sticky (euch). But our server was friendly!\n\nMenu options are pretty similar to Crepevine's, and service was roughly the same. You stand in line to order, then take a number from the cashier and find a seat. Beverages are also self-serve. But I def prefer dining in a cleaner and more brightly lit restaurant, so I don't think I'll be coming back to Honey Honey!", "author": "Claire L."}

The menu's posted on the right side of the place, and it's HUGE. there's a wide array of food to choose from, ranging from breakfast foods, to lunch and dinner foods as well.\n\nI ordered the blintz dessert crepe, which is basically a strawberry jam, orange marmalade, ricotta cheese, and strawberry crepe. It can be served with ice cream but I decided not to add it cuz the day was cold. I also ordered a Crab Cake Florentine. You pay after you order, so basically you can just leave once youre done eating lol.\n\nThe food comes out pretty fast, depending on how busy the place is. We got our food quite quickly. If you're not a super big fan of sweet stuff, I suggest you not get the blintz crepe. Its a beautifully decorated crepe, and it was really sweet. The orange marmalade gave it a citrusy kick. But the ricotta cheese really complemented the sweetness and it came out alright. The crab cake Florentine was pretty good also! The crab cake was nice and fluffy, not burnt.

Once seated sit back and relax because your food will be out in about 8 minutes. (Unscientific hypothesis based solely on observation during my stay) \n\nI had the breakfast crepe and one pancake. Crepe filled with: eggs, cheese. Onion and bell pepper; it comes with ham but I substituted chorizo. (Must be my AZ roots) The pancake was a 10 out of 10, which those of you who know me says a lot for them. (#pancake snob) The breakfast crepe comes with your choice of potatoes or fruit.

On our last day in San Fran, my girlfriends and I were having a hard time finding a brunch place, but stumbled upon this place while taking a walk. I got the eggs Benedict with potatoes and it was a great portion + very delicious. The potatoes were a good type of spicy, and the eggs Benedict had a great hollandaise sauce. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice! \n\nI would recommend coming early since around 10AM the line was very long to order.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

He would have preferred the eggs to be a bit softer. I thought the crepe was dry on top & needed a sauce, so used the mild tabasco on the table but would have preferred something like fresh pico de gallo b/c I didn't want to add spice to my crepe.\n\nThey make their Bloody Mary drinks with sake; they were very nice. That's how they can get away with Bloody Mary's & only have a wine & beer license.\n\nMy iced chai had to be returned though (I had to get up & return it myself.) They didn't put enough chai concentrate and it was mostly iced milk. They remade it better & I added nutmeg & cinnamon from their shakers which helped. For that I would knock down this review to 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't have half stars, so I will give the benefit of the doubt this time.", "author": "N. F."}

While we were waiting on our food, a homeless person walked in and took a table next to us. They gently asked her a couple of times to leave, but she decided not to. They then threatened to call the cops as she got a little more rowdy, but they didn't. Ten to fifteen minutes went by as this lady stared at us and mumbled \"stupidos\" in our direction. Still nothing was done. Then, after waiting in line and for our food for like an hour, the food was delivered. The homeless lady's murmurings rose to a crescendo - \"STUPIDOS, STUPIDOS\" she was yelling now. The waiter that delivered our food fled - to where, who knows? The lady got up, her urine smell had now filled our corner of the restaurant, \"GIVE ME THAT!\" She exclaimed at us, while approaching our table. My wife got up and fled, and I sat there, hoping to reason with her, hoping someone from the staff of Honey Honey Cafe would help us, their paying customers. \"No, that's ours,\" I meekly replied, knowing my hourlong wait would now be in vain. The lady just grabbed our food off of our table, and with one final \"STUPIDO\" she went back to her table and ate our food. I was standing back from our table now, desperately looking for someone to help us. Instead, the waitstaff had fled behind the counter. One seemed vaguely sorry for us as he offered to get us more food. We just asked for our money back and left. The girl at the register even seemed kind of annoyed. We had to push past a line of about 25 people, some carrying Chanel purses, as they somehow decided that they still wanted to eat at a restaurant that allowed homeless people to hang out and steal customers' food. Maybe some were excited to grab our now vacant table? Really bummed by this experience and disturbing lack of customer service. Why didn't they call the cops immediately? Why weren't they more forceful in asking her to leave? Why weren't the apologies more sincere? Why weren't we offered some kind of voucher? Hope they can sort this kind of thing out in the future. Maybe a new manager who will actually maintain the safety of the restaurant?", "author": "Zack Q."}

There were about 3 people in line at 9am when I entered this cute joint.  By the time we left, the line almost reach the door.  It's well-sized, not too crowded.  I like this atmosphere.  It reminds me of college where we'd ordered at the cashier, take our ticket, sit down, and chit chat while we wait to be served our food.  They have a delightful water pitcher and petite decor.  They also sell some bakery/pastry goods (ie. macarons) and a variety of juices and wines.\n\nToday we shared a Salmon benedict and SBK crepe.  (SBK stands for strawberry banana kiwi, with a hint of cinnamon and brown sugar w/ a choice of whipped cream or ice cream).  The fruit inside was warm, so that took a little getting used to.  The smoked salmon reminded me of lox with the tomato beneath it.  I usually don't take notice of hollandaise, but today I did because it tasted good.

No one would seat us, and since everyone behind us in line took the tables we had to crowd 8 people around 2 small 2-person tables at either end of the restaurant.

That is, apparently, a rare find in the neighborhood. More importantly, thank you for offering a tofu scramble on the menu. As a vegan, I appreciate that.\n\nHowever, as a vegan, I would like to give you some information on what a tofu scramble is. Or, more importantly, what it is not. Notably, a tofu scramble:\n\n1. Does not include eggs. If a person interested in a tofu scramble wanted eggs, they would order scrambled eggs, of which you already have plenty on your menu. Tofu scramble is for people who don't eat eggs!\n\n2. Does not consist of cubes of tofu. Rather, tofu scramble is made by crumbling up tofu and scrambling it around in a frying pan with other spices and vegetables so that it resembles scrambled eggs without being made of, you know, eggs (see point 1).\n\nFurthermore, when I ordered the tofu scramble without eggs, I noticed that the amount of food on my dish was noticeably small without any reduction in the price. This was a bit disappointing as I left hungry and still paid a fair amount for my meal.\n\nHopefully you can take my suggestions into consideration and improve your menu for future vegan patrons!\n\nCheers!", "author": "Alyssa J P."}

Love the decor, a bit rustic, a bit European...and the circular seating arrangements makes for great eye candy watching, around a center pole but I digress.\n\nOrdered the popular crab cakes florenentine benedict, eggs done just right, and while this was good, I wasn't floored by it.  But for $10.50, and the amount of yummy hash browns which were really spiced well, what a steal.  Look at the pic, the spinach was just overflowing lol.\n\nBut the highlight was the freshly squeezed orange juice; whoever thought of putting that machine right behind the cashier is a marketing genius, suckered me for sure, wish I had ordered 2 glasses lol.\n\nall in all, for a dt place, it's not too bad distance-wise from the shopping but hotels all around, I'd be here in a jiffy next time.\n\nfree wifi too.\n\nfriendly service.\n\namex, yah!", "author": "Kenneth N."}

When I approached the food runner / bus boy about the fact that he was walking around with a plate in his hand that I knew was mine, he got combative with me and told me to sit down. Not 2 minutes later, a girl, maybe the manager, approached me asking what the problem was, after I told her, miraculously my food appeared and she offered us mimosas for the frustration. Way to diffuse! Food was good, but not worth all the time and frustration. They are understaffed and without an efficient system to keep up with the demand.

This tells me they are too slow taking the orders!! An additional person taking orders would have been a much more efficient system and would greatly increase table turnover and total sells. \nPerhaps even better:  Get Real waiters and waitresses taking orders like a real restaurant!  It seems the kitchen crew gets the job done.  \n\nOnce we finally placed the order, their machine spit out a receipt with tip options?  Really??? Why would you tip them when you have to stand in line 45 mins to place your order?   I hit other and typed in zero tip! I am sorry but a long line is not service!   Service is taking my order while I sit in a comfortable chair and sip amazing coffee!  \n\nThe Food was prepared fast, but it was not amazing. The breakfast potatoes were fresh and cooked perfectly. The blintz (my first) was a gooey mess.  The prices were fair considering SF prices.  But I will NEVER come back due to their long totally unnecessary line.

You are supposed to order and then find a seat, but many people would hold tables before they ordered.  This left customers, who had already paid, left to stand around and wait for people to leave.  We have a restaurant near us that posts signs warning against this practice, and will ask you to leave your table, to prevent exactly this situation.  If this restaurant did the same, it would make for a much more relaxed dining experience.  I created a yelp account just to say this.", "author": "Joaquin P."}

They also serve my breakfast staple, oatmeal, albeit instant and not steel cut,  but at least this way I got them made with soy milk instead of cow juice. That said, $6.00 for a bowl of instant oats is pretty hefty, the only thing they add is a little brown sugar on the side, no nuts, no fruit. \n\nThe dessert crepes are another rip off for almost $7.00. Part of what made me come here were the reviews stating the crepes are perfect here but I couldn't disagree more. The batter was too thin and watery, resulting in a dry crepe that was burnt on one side and crumbing apart at the edges. Crepes aren't supposed to be that crispy, so they clearly got the batter wrong. The strawberries were sliced carelessly, leaving the green tops on, they also didn't appear to have been washed.

It is a very small and cute cafe that you would find on Haight Street or the Marina area. Surprisingly it is close to downtown San Francisco. Under the recommendation of my brother, we trekked over to the cafe with our bellies grumbling and ready to get our carbs in. I got the rigatoni san luca (sun dried tomatoes, chicken breast, garlic, and basil) and my brother and cousin got crepes. I don't remember what crepes they got but I got to taste theirs and both were very yummy. I loved the rigatoni san luca, very filling and lots of flavor. Best part was that it cane with garlic bread which as crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. We shared the caramel crepe for dessert and it was very delicious. Warm, sweet, and made with much love. \n\nThe service is pretty good. The staff is friendly and attentive. It took awhile for our food to come out but that is because they make the food as you order. You seat yourself. We ate inside because it was cold outdoors. Loved the recommendation my brother gave.

It comes w. a salad, fruit cup or a side of potatoes. We chose the potatoes, very good and flavorful w. great seasonings on. The crepe was outstanding, one of the best we ever had.

It did not taste good.\n\nThe savory Florentine Crepe (spinach, cheddar, cottage cheese, onions) was a better, although not by much.

There was a long line and it took a half hour to place our order.    No problem, as it's a popular place.     Once we placed our order, we waited for 45 minutes and noticed everyone in line after us was already eating and almost done!   I noticed the owner walking by and asked him to look into our ticket as its been 45 mins.   He said sure, and walked away.   15 mins go by and we never hear back from him, so I walked up to the register and told the cashier that we've been waiting for an hour for our food.   She goes in the back and tells us it'll be any minute.  Another 15 minutes later I go back to her and at this point I'm not happy, she gives me a funny look as she's getting annoyed and says any minute now.   Long story short, we get our food 1:20 minutes after we ordered our food.  This couple next to our table was leaving and actually said to us, you don't even have your food yet!?   You were ahead of us, and we're already done and leaving!\n\nClearly they must have misplaced our order.   My main problem wasn't that they screwed up, but the way they handled it.    The owner never came back to apologize or explain what had happened.    Even when I asked the cashier to get the owner, he still didn't come out.   Bad management practice when you don't care if you've treated customers so poorly.    With Yelp this kind of behavior spreads fast so hopefully they learn how to handle situations like this.    Oh, right about when we were leaving, one of their servers dropped off a Crepe at our table and said this is on the house.   Really?   A $7 Crepe, no explanation or apology?    We didn't touch their Crepe, and left it there.    Watch out for this place, if the owner doesn't care about their customers, that attitude trickles down to the employees.", "author": "Nasser G."}

They have freshly squeezed orange juice which is yummy but then for three bucks and no refills? Eh. Their coffee is good and strong but not worth it being that I didn't feel like it was fresh. \n\nWe had the chirizo and eggs .. and I had the eggs benedict. Now let me just say that I asked for my potatoes to be crispy because I like them this way! And the lady made no notation. She just nodded which kind of irritated me. I mean, hello? I've been waiting for an hour and I can't even get the food that I want right? So when we sat down, our food came quickly. We were surprised. My boyfriend loved his food. He said he was worried because of the reviews on yelp of the plate being too eggy? Or not eggy enough but he thought it was perfect. He also commented on how much cilantro it had which was what he wanted. For me, my benedict was perfect. The eggs were easy so they exploded PERFECTLY! The only downer was my damn potatoes because they weren't crispy. \n\nI have to say that even though there was the long wait and the non crispy potatoes, this was my favorite spot to eat while in SF. \n\nPS.

Decided on this place just based on proximity to my apartment and Yelp review. We went on a Saturday around 11:30 and there was a small wait, but the service was quick and the food was great. Almost everything on the menu was under $10 with some items at $11.95 or less.

We were in line just before 9 and we were just outside the door and waited for 30 min. There is an eclectic group of people, array of menu items, and several options for drinks. The issue with this place for us wasn't the food, it was the line and lack of service. The only reason they have a long wait is because there is a single register and its counter service only. Then 1-2 people run out food and wipe down tables with the same dirty rag...eek! If they had 3-4 people taking orders then they would turn over much quicker.\n\nNow to the food...I was determined to get the crab hollandaise but seeing a few people picking shells out of their mouth I opted against it. I instead went with the Eden crepe. It was a wonderful combination of sweet,salty and filling. The potatoes had a nice crispy, crunchy crust and just lacked a little on the seasoning. You get your own brewing kettle of tea. My husband said his coffee was \"okay.\" He had the chorizo scramble and the chorizo was 60/40 to the eggs and had a nice spice to it. We also shared a side of the chicken apple sausage which was very flavorful. Overall with tip we spent $35. Very reasonable for SF. I think if this place nailed down the order process, they'd definitely be more efficient and would be worthy of 4.5+ rating. ***Go with a crepe, they do them quite well, everything else seemed inconsistent and not really special from any other breakfast place!", "author": "Tiffany P."}

I was satisfied, and it tasted like pizza which I love so I was happy with my choice. I did not try the crepes which I now regret but next time for sure. :)\n\nBe cautious of your surroundings if you have to wait outside. A random woman stood so close to me that our shoes were touching and when I would move, she would move closer. She had no intent in eating there since she was a transient and eventually left after walking around the back of the restaurant.

We were here for breakfast and although the line was long, it went by rather quickly.  I ordered the Pesto Crepe which was Cheddar, tomato, spinach, pine nuts, feta cheese, pesto, and avocado.  As a side, I ordered the salad.  This was my first time having a crepe that wasn't a \"sweet\" crepe so I was excited to dig in.  The flavor of the Pesto mixed in with everything else was so yummy!\n\nThere are times when you order food and your plate is so good that you don't even want to try anyone else's plate.  (Or at least that's what I thought.)  When I finished all of mine, I couldn't resist trying the potatoes which were leftover on my friend Alice's plate.  They were delicious by the way.  \n\nBecause you can't go to a Crepe place without having a dessert style crepe, we ordered a Strawbery Nutella to top off our meal.

Nonetheless, the tofu scramble was something surprisingly good.  It wasn't exactly scrambly, more like tiny seasoned cubes of tofu - but it was delicious.  I'm not to certain as to what the tofu had been stirfried with, but it was slightly salty and herby - not the usual nutritional yeast (which yes, I like as well).  The breakfast potatoes were also a nice touch from the usual hash browns - chopped up slightly pan-fried morsels of crunchy warm soft deliciousness.  The potato and tofu combo was lovely with a splash of Tabasco and ketchup topped off with fresh green onions and cilantro.  The accompany sourdough bread seemed to be the kind mass-produced.  It was airier than usual, but all right.  \n\nI also had a soy latte and it was pretty great, but again, I had stupidly chugged down day ole Starbucks beforehand (I'm rough in the morning, okay?!).

After you order you find a table and they bring your food out to you.  Not sure that system quite works.  I'm sure there are easier ways to do this as they only had one register open.  Actually I believe they only had one register which is kind of silly especially with a crowd like they had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-30", "description": "One thing that can be said about Honey Honey, is that people really seem to like this place.\nThe thing about San Fran restaurants is that I can never tell if a place is busy because all the locals are piling in, or if people are just lining up because \"they've heard [or read] that it was good.\"\nAs I started to write this review, I honestly couldn't remember the food.\nI remembered waiting in a long line to order - which gave me time to contemplate the menu, and have a mini panic attack about whether I'd really find a seat or not.  I probably looked like a loon to the diners around me, as I stared at them calculating whether or not they'd be done and out the door by the time I got to the counter, ordered, and received a stick with a number on it.\n\nMy group and I did successfully order, and semi-successfully found seating - squished together.  This is not the place for groups of more than 2. \n\nNow that I've given myself time to think of it, I do remember the food.  I got a mocha, which was served in a glass instead of a mug, which is a big pet peeve and no-no in my opinion.\nFor food, I ordered the sunrise burrito - chorizo has a special place in my heart.  This burrito was pretty good; too many beans; but overall really tasty, big, stuffed with good stuff, and didn't skimp on the chorizo.  It was spicy - appropriately.  \n\nYou know what they do REALLY well here?  Crepes.  My companions had crepes, savory and sweet, and I got to try all of them -- totally masterful, totally delightful.  So, go for the crepes when you come here!", "author": "Rebecca M."}

The potatoes that they served were incredibly delish! As a take on hash browns, these potatoes had caramelized to a crunchy crust and had a very nice herby seasoning. It reminded me of Thanksgiving. \n\nYou have to order at the counter and seat yourself, but although waitering was a little bit non-existent, the lady up front had come up to us when we were in line and before we had even ordered our food asking us what we would like to drink.

The coffee was very good, too, though getting a refill was impossible until they came with our food, 30 minutes after we ordered.

It's just a block and a half above the Curran and the Geary, it wasn't remotely crowded, even at 7 PM on a Saturday evening, and the food was satisfactory, of good ingredient quality, inexpensive, and above all fast.\n\nHoney Honey specializes in what they call crepes, which might better be described as tortilla sandwiches.  The crepe is a flour pancake which is folded over a couple of times with the fillings inside.  They're not really large.  They have more varieties than the website shows, including some on another menu board that's almost unnoticably behind you as you stand and look at the main one.\n\nA variety called the Philly cheesesteak had genuine crumbly steak strips, and one featuring crabcakes had two whole, and very high quality, crabcakes stuffed inside.

I was not disappointed! After looking over the menu for a few minutes I decided to get the Mediterranean crepe with a side of fruit, and the fresh squeezed orange juice. I wasn't a huge fan of the orange juice, and solely because it was too sweet for my tastes, but I love how they have cucumber water and lemon water you get yourself- very convenient not having to wait on a waiter to bring it. \n\nThe mediterranean crepe was even better than I was hoping. If you like olives, tomato, avocado, and feta (mmmmm... feta...) then you need to try this crepe. I know a lot of places try to skimp out on the feta, but there was so much in the crepe that I was not left wanting. The side of fruit wasn't the best... It had a faint taste of onion... But I'm not sure it wasn't the onion in my crepe overpowering the fruit flavor. \nI don't live in San Fran, but if I did this would be my regular saturday morning brunch location. \n\nI saw an order of eggs Benedict come to the table next to me, and they looked amazing.

Although I found the restaurant to be small, it certainly makes up with their menu literally and physically.  The menu is practically larger than life and covers nearly an entire wall of the restaurant almost floor to ceiling!  They have breakfast, brunch/lunch, and dessert crepes, and with all these choices I found it difficult to make up mind..lol!  I finally decide on the chicken pesto crepe and this comes with either potatoes or a fruit mix.  Trying to be \"healthy\" on my trip I chose the fruit mix.  And instead of coffee, I chose freshly squeezed orange juice.  \n\nFYI:   The system at this place is that you place your order with the cashier, pay for your food, a numbered placard is given to you and your food is brought to your table.\n\nWhen my food was dropped off, I admit I thought the serving would be too small for me.

Our day was filled with gallivanting all over San Francisco, chinatown, the shops around union square, macys, H&M, playing tourist and all that jazz.  On our trek back we were hungry and decided on Honey Honey.  My boyfriend's sister and I were new to the crepes and dishes of Honey Honey but we were with some Honey Honey veterans and they assured us it was yummy enough to take back to the hotel.  \n\nThe four of us stood in somewhat of a long line staring up at the chalk board menu on the right side wall and carefully chose our dinners.  I almost opted for the Pesto crepe...but that shrimp fettuccine with mushrooms caught my eye.  Each of us ended up ordering this dish, I added some spinach and also went for one of their dessert crepes.  The banana with nutella crepe with whipped cream.  We waited patiently as we rested our feet and finally got our meals.  When we finally reached our hotel all four of us busted out our meals and began eating.  It was so quiet you could hear a pin fall on the floor. \n\nI really enjoyed my fettuccine with shrimp, mushrooms, and spinach it was still warm when we got back to our hotel and there were actually a lot of shrimp in it too!  The portion size was great as I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  Next up was the dessert crepe, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every bite of this.  The whipped cream was a bit melted but that's to be expected, it was quite large and the banana to nuttella ratio was perfect.  \n\nAll in all, the long line was worth it to me.  They could probably do well with another cashier to help out, the guy seemed very busy but handled the crowd well.  Loved the waters they have on the side for you to serve yourself.

My hubby ended eating here twice this trip since his SF local friend said this place was classic, and I came here once.  Huge brunch selection... Eggs, egg benedicts, sandwiches, and crepes!  Usually don't find those on the menu.  Sweet and savory options too!\n\nYou order like a cafeteria, then grab a table where you can.  The food comes pretty quickly but they did mix up our order on hubby's second visit here.  French toast was pretty average according to hubby, and the crepes ranged from average to good.  We ended up trying 3 types due to the order mix up.  We had a salmon version, the Torino version with feta, mushrooms and tomato, and a special of the day that was a Philly cheesesteak.  The crepes are a bit thick but the fillings inside were tasty.   Good portion sizes and I like the choices of fruit and salad in addition to the usual hash browns.\n\nA-OK place for breakfast and brunch in the area.", "author": "Katie F."}

This seems like it could be a recipe for not finding a place to sit, but that doesn't seem to be an issue - food comes out super fast, and people don't seem to linger.\nThe menu is pretty large, with a big list of crepes (both sweet and savory), and some standard brunch type options - omelettes, eggs benedict, etc.\nI had the chorizo scramble which had a nice subtle kick and was quite tasty, and not as greasy as chorizo often is. The potatoes were nicely browned and crispy.\nWe also tried the lemon crepe off the specials board - it was interesting, covered in zested lemony stuff - but the lemon was a bit overpowering for me.

Portion size is plenty. Mushrooms, cheddar, and a crab cake is an odd pairing, but the flavors usually present individually. I would rather a different kind of cheese perhaps. The crepe itself had no sweet flavor, to which I am accustomed, but I occasionally detected a banana flavor. Potatoes were soft, not too salty, but not super flavorful either.

It came with whipped cream on the side; if you want ice cream on the side, you have to order it separately for $2.95. The fruit side was a bit on the small side as well, it has mainly strawberry slices, 4 banana slices, 4 paper-thin slices of apples that were already turning brown, and a single slice of kiwi on top. You have to get your own water out of 2 dispensers they have, but once I was almost done with my water, I noticed multiple odd black specks floating around the bottom of my cup.

The crepe was good too, not something I would write home about, but had good flavor/crunch. \n\nMy friend wanted the bagel with lox etc, but somehow that got lost in translation because he only got a bagel with cream cheese so...haha #sad \n\nOverall cute place, had interesting shaped cookies behind the counter, and...was SUPER toasty when we entered...and mirrors, can't forget the mirrors.", "author": "Connie N."}

When you walk in, you notice that it's a really cute little place inside, seats probably 40-50 or so.  One of the walls has the complete menu, in very large print.\n\nI wanted to order so many crepes, but I wanted some protein and substance, so I went with the Huevos Rancheros.  I would give it 3.5 stars.  The tortillas were nice and crispy and eggs and cheese were pretty good.  The black beans were good, but it did lack a bit of flavor.  Some may appreciate it, but I like when black beans have a little meaty, porky flavor, but it did not.\n\nThe extra .5 star goes for the cute atmosphere, but also something that you rarely see in a restaurant, but was fantastic, the bathroom door has a vacancy/occupied sign.  It's a single bathroom and you usually have to knock and wait, but they have a convenient vacancy/occupied sign attached to the lock, similar to porta-johns.  It makes perfect sense and I wish more places had it.\n\nHoney Honey also has a very nice little outdoor seating place where you can enjoy the outside, people watch, and eat on the streets of SF.", "author": "Randy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-02", "description": "One of my lifelong philosophies has always been to skip the meal and go straight for the desserts regardless of the time of day. Smacked in between Union Square and the Tenderloin District, this crepery does not have the glamorous outlook when compared to all other tourist attractions on the same block. Instead, their spacious venue is filled with vibrant colors to support a family-friendly atmosphere complemented by a large menu, free wifi, and a good numbers of dessert crepes. As a crepe connoisseur and someone who is heavily dependent on public wifi, I can't help but to swing by for a dessert dinner and to find out the quality of their crepes when measured against others. \n\nMy strawberry nutella crepe ($5.95) arrived with a soft exterior outlined by a crispy cone-like texture on the edges. A gush of steam came out as I flipped open the crepe to notice the cooked strawberries with a smear of nutella that was unevenly distributed. The crepe was drizzled with chocolate and powder sugar to match a scoop of vanilla ice cream that came on the side. With a defined vanilla flavor, the ice cream had a sticky texture and interestingly tasted like a thickened whipped cream. Although the strawberries were not the freshest, the high temperature which it came with was effective in preventing the extreme hot-cold contrast that I find common but less than ideal among the many creperies I've visited. \n\nOverall, I thought it was a decent crepe that didn't wow or disappoint me. Since I paid $11 for a banana crepe at Ti Couz not too long ago, I thought the price this time was rather reasonable for what I got in return. I wish the crepe could have a fluffier and thicker texture while the restaurant could provide ample wall plugs for those who need to utilize their free wifi. Since their large menu has a diverse selection of dishes, I highly recommend this place for families and teenagers looking to make a quick stop for food as opposed to the many expensive sit down places in the area. The noise level however, maybe too loud for studying, but their wifi is still useful for those who may need it for other purposes. Service was brief and friendly under a pay first, self-serve arrangement. With so many creperies around the City, I would only return when I'm in the area.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The second time we went there, it was almost impossible to find a table.\n\nAnyway, the food was so good. I am very picky about seafood and especially picky about crab dishes. In NYC, it's hard to find good crab, believe it or not, so I was skeptical about the crab cakes Florentine benedict at Honey Honey, especially since it's $10.50. I was stunned by the quality of the food and the size of the crab cakes on the benedict. The crab cakes are mostly crab meat and very little filler -- can't complain about that. The potatoes that come with it are also good. The next time I went there, I ordered a single pancake and it was good! I'm a pancake snob, but this pancake was really good. My coworker got a lemon crepe and was very excited about it, but she was disappointed. And the coffee there was great, too. \n\nThe last day we were there, the line was literally out the door.

The ambiance was loud and the line long which can be a good sign, but took 15 minutes to get through. After ordering we waited about 10 minutes for our food which is not too bad. When the food arrived is where I became divided. My Belgian waffle was perfect. Its light and rich waffle with fresh strawberries and bananas became a home run to my taste buds when I poured on the warm rich maple syrup. Now for the bad. My wife got the oatmeal and fruit. The oat meal itself was woefully soupy and combined with the rotten strawberries she got with it made her lose her appetite. So here the verdict be careful what you order and ask a local in line for a recommendation. And if you are gluten intolerant like my wife just find another place for breakfast all together.", "author": "Jason R."}

Sweet crepes, savory crepes, sandwiches, salads, soups, eggs, waffles and much more comprise a series of blackboards along a wall as you enter. There are somehow more choices on a whiteboard by the register as well, in case the thousands of blackboard options weren't enough for the indecisive patron. \n\nWe ordered the tofu scramble which came with toast and potatoes but I asked for fruit instead of potatoes and they obliged my request, and the crab cake florentine with coffee.

I really like the Salmon Benedict and hot chocolate but I really want to out the other items on the menu.

It's another one of those places with a ton of egg and cr\u00eape options beautifully chalked up on an immense chalkboard for you to peruse while you wait in line to order.

Your meal comes with a great deal of food and isn't cheap but doesn't cost a huge amount of money.\n\nThe food is fine but no big deal, and the same can basically be said for the restaurant itself.

Decided on a sweet lemon crepe, despite the fact that I was here for a brunch, not a sweet pitstop.\n\nI find out later from my friend's boyfriend that these crepe places are a massive chain all over NorCal, one being in Berkeley, another being in Palo Alto, and Crepevine, the weird deja-vu feeling I got. He explained that even though they all had different shopfront names and different names for the crepes, it's basically the same stuff, just a few tweaks here and there, to fit the surrounding of the store.\n\nThe lemon crepe wasn't a bad choice, a little on the sour side (but what to except from a lemon crepe) with a pol of extra lemon marmalade and a small ramekin of vanilla ice cream.

I woud definitely recommend the sundried in place of regular tomatoes--gave it even more flavor. The savory crepes come with the choice of  salad, fruit, or potatoes on the side. I opted for potatoes, and it was totally the right choice.

I ordered an omelette, two sunny side up eggs (which was given scrambled) and a caprice bagel. First off, our potatoes were actually cold. Not even a bit. Almost like it was last nights leftovers left outside all night. Our bagel was disgusting, I am being serious. I could not pass one bite. So then we decided to move onto the omelette because we were starving and just spent 35 dollars l. About two bites into my tasteless omelette, I noticed a price of hair. I moved it and then I noticed two more pieces of hair by the food. So then after I was utterly disgusted... I decided to inspecter gadget my food.. not only did I find more hair... but my friend eating the sunny side up (scrambled) eggs ALSO found 2-3 pieces of hair. Cold potatoes, hair, tasteless bagel. Utterly outraged. I never return food but this was just insane.... I took the food back and quietly told the lady about the hair given it was a packed house I didn't want to embarrass her. She then proceeds to give me attitude... which I didn't understand why when if you open the box you can clearly see the hair. She handed me 20 dollars from the 35 dollar meal as a refund didn't even say sorry or anything for that matter. I didn't want to argue or get into it so I did not complain about the 15 dollars. This experience was a horrible way to start my day. I suggest you think twice before eating here and if you do, check ur food for hair.", "author": "Tadeh P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-19", "description": "Thanks to Yelpers, I stumbled here one afternoon after checking out of my hotel in the hopes of finding a good crepe.  I walked in and it was not at all what I thought it would be.  Expecting a cute, quaint spot for brunch, the ambiance caught me by surprise.  First, I could barely tell where it was (granted, I was a tourist); it wasn't labeled all too well.  The interior was interesting.  The walls were handpainted, almost in a Mediterranean style, but from the early 90s.  Instead of wait service, you must find your way to the cash register (if you can make it past the expansive menu...I probably stared at it for 5 minutes) to order.  No problem, I'll take it.  I'm here for the food after all.\n\nI ordered the SBK crepe, a crepe filled with strawberries, bananas, kiwi, cinnamon, and brown sugar served with a side of whipped cream and a side of potatoes (I can never resist).  I also ordered a chai latte.  Bad news first.  The chai was not chai enough.  Too much milk, but not terrible.\n\nNow, the good news.  The SBK crepe was as delicious as the description sounds.  It was aromatic, incredibly fresh, and somehow, not too sweet.  The cinnamon and brown sugar were not at all overpowering; instead, it allowed the sugar and the flavors of the fruit to shine.  The crepe was light, but still fulfilling.  The potatoes were homefries, but very good homefries.  While I did have to add a little salt, the herbs accompanying the potatoes were delicious.  The parts of the potato skin that were a little burnt, were just burnt enough.  Mm.  I love me some good potatoes.\n\nAll in all, despite the confusion at the onset of my trip, this was a lowkey place for brunch that I would definitely visit again.  As opposed to the fancy brunch places, one wouldn't feel embarrassed to sit at a table by themselves with a book.  In fact, it was rather comforting.  \n\nAlso, did I mention they had free wi-fi?  Check the phone number on the receipt.  That's the key code.", "author": "Nikki Y."}

The place was packed and top 40 music was playing in the background. By the time we sat down the music got increasingly louder and it seemed that someone most have changed the playlist to house music, my worst nightmare. I think  that there is a time and a place for that type of music and early in the morning at a breakfast establishment isn't one of them. I felt as if I was in a nightclub. Had I been hungover the music would have made me feel ill. Unfortunately, since the music was so annoying I wasn't able to really enjoy my meal and it made me want to leave ASAP. \n\nThe food was decent. I ordered an omelette, which I felt was adequate but not memorable. I won't be returning there to eat, but I wouldn't strongly discourage people from going there -- as long as they plan to get their order to go. \n\nI wanted to mention that there was only one employee bringing  everyone their meals and cleaning up tables.

What better way then to spend a Saturday night with a sweet tooth. We walk in and immediately there's like 2 tables that are clean and not dirty with plates or trash. They were busy which, to me, made me want to try it even more. (I'd be worried if no one was there) we are greeted by the lady working the cash register telling us they are \"ONLY ACCEPTING TO GO ORDERS BECAUSE THERES ONLY 1 COOK\" wait why? It's 9:30 you guys close at 10. As we sit down to wait for our crepe we see three guys in the back (2 of them which are just kinda talking not working) when the lady brings us our crepe in a Togo bag she set it down on the table without saying a word to us. We are our crepe that ended up being super burnt and over done with cinnamon...... NO BROWN SUGAR. The only good part about the crepe was the ice cream it came with. We were out by 9:50.... yea we are our crepe there. I'm a manager at a restaurant and it's super unacceptable in my opinion (and completely unprofessional) to close your store before posted hours.. and turn away customers while your technically still open. I'm hoping someone just called off at the last minute and one person wasn't responsible for the whole front because let's be honest that wasn't fair to her. I give this two stars because aside from the lack of customer service from the girl, she was busting her ass to clean the lobby. The manager or owner should schedule at least three ppl since you're located in union square and I'm sure a ton of tourists like us.\n\n\nEDIT: I just received a message from \"Veronika K.\" The waitress that was there.

We decided that since there wasn't any better reasonably priced options around the neighborhood, we would give Honey Honey a try. \n\nThe line for this place was practically out the door. That line is super deceptive though. You think that you will never get a table when you place your order, but in actuality you most certainly will. I believe that they are slow to take orders so that they can allow time for people to finish their food and open up tables for those who may have just ordered. I'm sticking to my theory because it makes good sense. Also, the long line makes people interested to come in and check out the place, which is what we did.\n\nI have had both their buttermilk pancakes and their Belgian waffle with fruit. Both menu items were good. If I had to choose one over the other, I'd probably go with the pancakes, only because the waffles were a bit too soft and not crunchy enough. However, the strawberries and banana slices on the waffle were great. I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes the first time I came here, as I almost always do when eating out for breakfast. I must say those potatoes had a little kick to them that made them delicious. \n\nI wasn't really a fan of their water options. They add some fruits to their water to make it taste more unique, but it's not my thing. I prefer ice cold regular water.

Long line to order but lots to chose from off the board. \n\nFood was just ok. My kid got the two eggs. She's 17 and said it was \"just eggs and potatoes and toast\". Nothing special. I had the 2-2-2. Two eggs, two pancakes, and one sausage patty that maybe was supposed to be two sausages. It was very average. Tomorrow we will try for something better. \n\nIt looks like Crepeville locations in Sac. Wonder if the same folks own all these locations or of they copy off each other.", "author": "Steven H."}

I figured not a big deal, they are chatting because this is the first chance they got (assuming they were busy earlier). She takes my order hands me a number and a cup of coffee, I asked for cream and sugar and she just points over to a counter where you're supposed to help yourself. Why couldn't she have just told me?\n\nThe bus boy brings out my food, chorizo scramble and it's delicious!! The chorizo is spicy and the potatoes are fresh and homemade, not store bought. The only complaint I do have about the food is my English muffin was cold when they brought it out. I asked for water and he proceeds to tell me \"you grab it yourself\"\n\nI'm sorry, but what is the purpose of us tipping if they do nothing, but bring the food?

They have free wi-fi so grab some coffee and stay a while.\n\nTheir dishes are more than gourmet and offer huge portions.  I especially love their salads.  Really large portions, served with fresh bread.  Their club salad comes with a whole breast of seasoned chicken, avocado and at least 2 strips of bacon.  On a cheat day, I love to get their breakfast potatoes, extra crispy.  So delicious.  This is a great place to come for breakfast.  They offer waffles, pancakes, omelets.  Everything.  They have a wide selection of coffee, teas and baked goods.  I'm telling you, this place has EVERYTHING so it's a good place to bring a group so that everyone gets what they want.\n\nTheir crepes are even more delicious.

The crepes are more filling than they look. The fontina in my eden crepe melted nicely as did the gorgonzola in the pesto crepe. The apple cider was good too, with a nice big stick of cinnamon and remnants of powdered cinnamon spice at the bottom. It was just I needed on a rainy morning.\n\nFor a pretty big place and unlimited seating, this place feels crowded because of the tables are arranged closely.

The servers behind the counter were a bit slow, possibly due to a smaller staff, maybe they were nursing their own hangovers, maybe because the group of people in front of us placed each of their orders separately despite being there all together. Either way, we eventually got our order placed and grabbed a seat. \n\nThere's a really wide range of breakfast dishes, from crepes to eggs to fresh fruit. In a way, I was glad for the extra time it took for us to get to the counter since I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted (I'll attribute part of the indecision to my really slow thinking brain: 4 hours of sleep was really catching up to me). \n\nActual serving of the order didn't take long we both had more than enough food to satisfy our post-celebration appetites.\n\nOverall it's a decent breakfast place to stop by if you're looking for something quick and filling. There's a good range of choices, a few specials that seem to change regularly, and decent seating.

We went in around 11 or so to a handful of people in line and maybe a dozen at tables, but our food came out quickly.\n\nI ordered the Huevos Rancheros (which came with beans), topped with a salsa/sauce and drizzled with sour cream. The corn tortillas were simply heated before topped with eggs et al, but the meal met my expectations and was inoffensive. When my friend ordered the benedict she was acted if she would like her eggs soft or medium, which surprised me for such a casual joint. Her benedict was good, although the rosemary potatoes threw her a little bit and seemed out of place.\n\nAll in all we had a decent meal at a reasonable price within walking distance to our hotel. I won't be dreaming of this place, but I would definitely go back. A solid experience.", "author": "Erica P."}

Early in the morn (like, 10 am), my phone rang and it was my friend.  She woke up early and wanted coffee. She walked down to the Starbucks inside our hotel but the line was long. She decided to Yelp some places nearby and found Honey Honey.\n\nI really didn't have any idea what she said when she called but I heard the words \"crepe.\"  I hustled and threw a few layers one and bolted out the door. \n\nThe line at Honey Honey was out the door.  HOWEVER, it moved quickly.  Here is how to proceed:\n\n1. Get in line.\n2. While in line, check out the huge menu on the left wall.\n3. Order.\n4. They will give you a number.\n5. Sit and wait for deliciousness.\n\nI listed it in hope that you would not be one of the few annoying people who try to grab a table before ordering.  I hope that you would be one of the many polite ones who are there to enjoy good food along with good company.  \n\nThe food was absolutely worth the wait.  I ordered the banana crepe with nutella, Orangina, and tea.  My friend ordered banana crepe with nutella, chorizo with a side of potatoes, coffee, and apple cider. We were really hungry. But the food was soooo good.  We ate ev-e-ry-thing.  I wish I ordered my own chorizo and side of potatoes.  Seriously, the food was worth the wait.  And again, the line moves fairly quickly. At the very least, they are efficient.\n\nLastly, the staff was super nice-- from the person who took the order to the busser.  Given that they were located in a very touristy area and some people were not very patient (especially those who clearly should have had a shot of caffeine before they left their hotel room), the staff handled the situatin with grace.\n\nWe LOVED Honey Honey!  So glad that my friend decided not to get Starbucks.", "author": "Pilar D."}

I walked in and was a little overwhelmed by the menu but I got over that and ordered the eggs benedict, orange juice and pot of ginger twist tea. The benedict was scrumptious (the potatoes were ok) and the tea was heavenly. I love hot tea. I left full and satisfied and went off in search of something to do with the rest of my day. \n\nI went back again the next morning. I was heading to the airport for my long flight home and wanted to have a filling breakfast before the journey. I ordered the same tea and a Belgium waffle. OMG! Hands down one of the best waffles I have ever had. It was topped with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream.

This place was PACKED with a line for the ordering counter out the door.  The menu was huge and you can see it from virtually anywhere inside the restaurant (a huge help when you're waiting in that line trying to order).  Seating is first come, first serve, so we sent half our party to find a table and the rest of us decided to wait in line and order everything.  There is literally an option for every member of your picky food eating party member.  Husband and I decided to split savory and sweet for breakfast that morning ordering the Sunrise Burrito (with delicious chorizo inside) and the Strawberry and Nutella crepe.  He had the house coffee black while I had their Iced Chai.  The Chai was more milky than I prefer but still satisfying.  The food took a considerably long time (hence the 4 star review) and the tables are really crowded and most tables are small.  The burrito was huge and really flavorful.  The sauce that it's smothered in was delectable!!  Tons of chorizo and eggs inside with sides of rice and beans, it's definitely filling.

Loved the vibe - reminded me of a coffee house in Vienna - open space, small tables, classical music at night. They offer comfort food presented beautifully and at totally reasonable prices.  Winners - strawberry/Nutella crepe and the lemon crepe - the lemon crepe had fresh lemon - I could taste the pulp and the zest and with fresh whip creme it was a score!  Consider coming here just to get dessert.\nFor breakfast I really enjoyed the banana pecan pancakes with bacon (crispy) and a big glass of fresh oj.  The coffees here are so much cheaper than at Starbucks - I didn't get a latte but it looked amazing.\nThey have a huge selection of Mighty Leaf teas.  Another score!\nFor dinner, the capellini de Angelo was perfect - fresh tomato sauce with garlic, white wine, oregano and shrimp.  A glass of wine less than $5.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "Summary: Nice casual atmosphere. Great food. Reasonably priced.\n\nI came here on a Sunday morning during a trip to San Francisco because I, like many, am a fan of crepes. Naturally for Sunday breakfast/brunch you would expect the place to be packed, and it was - but not so much that it was annoying. The place has a great buzzing vibe, emphasizing its popularity that I assume it has among SF natives. If my experience is telling, there will most certainly be a long line, but it moves pretty quickly so don't be discouraged too quickly. I got the breakfast crepe: which had onions, ham, and cheddar. I really liked it. The orange juice was smooth and fresh, squeezed right there in front of you (I'm from New England so this is unusual). The side of potatoes was great too. Portions are medium sized. Not too small such that I wanted more, but definitely not Daddy bear sized either. And, being from Boston and unaccustomed to the high prices in San Fran, I was comforted by the reasonable prices for good food.\n\nLater that day my family wanted something sweet after dinner, and decided to give Honey  Honey's another test. The line was much shorter and the restaurant notably quieter. Still the same humble feel, just less of a busy-bee Sunday morning vibe and a more relaxed evening one. I had the strawberry and nutella crepe. I would eat my own shoes if they had nutella on them, so I may be a biased source for this, but that crepe was also delicious. Overall, great place to go. Not a five-star restaurant (it doesn't try to be), but I'm definitely recommending it as a casual family or date place. Or, if you're like me, just a traveler looking to spend less without getting less.", "author": "Pablo R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-04", "description": "Honey honey is fantastic- and I feel confident in giving it a 5 star review. Perhaps I lucked out on the food ordered and the service, but my 5 star sentiment stands.\n\n1-Fresh pressed carrot and orange juice! I'll admit, this place earned an extra star for me because I could actually get this combination of juice, which happens to be my favorite in the world, and extremely difficult to come by in the US. You can get fresh orange juice, fresh carrot juice, or take my advice and get it half and half. Delicious. And just $3.50, deal.\n\n2-This is a crepe place. I mean I'm sure the rest of the food is fine, but the specialty here is crepes, so I suggest, you know, ordering a crepe. In the same way that the chicken fingers probably aren't the best items on a menu at an Italian restaurant I feel like anything other than crepes is probably not the best this place can offer. (Though the other food I saw come out looked fantastic as well.) I was especially excited about the savory crepes, which are far more difficult to come by than dessert crepes. I started my morning off with the Florentine crepe, a delicious combination of cheddar, spinach, cottage cheese and onions. \n\n3-Fresh fruit. The savory crepes all come with a side of salad, potatoes, or fresh fruit. I opted for the fruit and it was absolutely fresh. Like, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if it was sliced up just seconds before going on my plate. The banana, strawberry and apples were fantastic. Also, as these are ingredients used in their dessert crepe recipes, I'm betting they cycle through fruit here quite quickly, so things are likely to be quite fresh.\n\nOverall, great experience, and a delicious breakfast. My food was delivered to my table within about 5 minutes of when I placed my order at the counter, and was warm and melty. The coffee was good, and I even got it refilled for free. Prices are totally reasonable, and the staff was all very friendly. If you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat, this is a great place to stop.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

But then again, if I did, I'd probably go everyday and gain 200 lbs.\n\n  My boyfriend and I went here twice during our weeklong stay in San Francisco. The first time was for brunch when I had the Crab Cake Florentine. I don't know how else to describe it aside from YUMMY! One of the cheaper brunches I've had and so filling too! I couldn't even finish the whole thing....\n\n  I love that you just go up to order and sit wherever you want. The line was pretty long when we went that first time, but that wasn't really a problem because we were taking forever in deciding what we wanted. And even though the line was enormous, there was plenty of space to sit since most people were getting things to go.\n\n  The second time was the night after when we were looking for places for dessert. This was around 8 or 9, so a lot of places were closed or about to -_- But Honey Honey was closed at 10, so we went back for crepes. I got the Strawberry Nutella and once again YUMMY! There were a lot less people this time so the wait was nothing.\n\n  Servers are very nice, the bathroom is HUGE and mostly clean, you can get freshly squeezed orange juice and you can choose between lemon infused or orange infused water (for free!!).

We went for a brunch time meal and was able to find a table. However, pretty soon after that it was packed. Good thing this place also had a to-go option! \n\nWe ordered the waffles, croissant sandwich, and the french toast. Everything was pretty tasty and decent-sized portions for the price range. Would definitely give this place thumbs up. \n\nYet, I wouldn't bother coming to SF just for this, if you are traveling from outside of the immediate neighborhood. Maybe coupled with a shopping trip to Union Square, the parking hassle and fees would be justified.", "author": "Linda L."}

My friend wasn't feeling good and so she sat down while we ordered, one party was in front of us and there were many, many tables open. She made my friend get up from the table because she didn't have a number....meanwhile, we are actually ordering at that same time. My friend kept telling the waitress/busser that we were almost there but she didn't care. She moved us to a table that was filthy!!! She proceeded to remove the dishes but left the table top dirty. When I politely asked her to come back and wipe again, I received a dirty look and a wipe that removed maybe 2 crumbs but was still sticky. I called out to her again but this time she completely ignored me!\n\nBreakfast = 1 out of 10\nOrange juice = 10 out of 10\nStrawberry Nutella Crepe = 5 out of 10 (the strawberries were not fresh, they were mushy.)", "author": "Cheryl T."}

I hadn't been here in a few years, but recently took a trip to SF from LA for my girlfriend's birthday and it was just as amazing as I had remembered. Maybe even better. We came around 10am for a birthday brunch and there was a line but it gave us time to look over the extensive menu. The large menu was conveniently placed along the waiting line, so you can decide what you want to eat while waiting in line to order!  We ordered, found a table and the food was quickly served! We got a chocolate chip waffle, chorizo burrito, and a Nutella and strawberry crepe with a side of ice cream. Even though it was three plates for two people, we demolished it all. It was all so delicious! The ambience was cool, with a mix of young and older people crowding the place and we cannot wait to go back.", "author": "Adam Z."}

The place was pretty much empty on a weekday evening which was good since I wanted my food fast... which it was so kudos there. \n\nI had a crabcake sandwich which was as good as a non-homemade crabcake could be. I'm sure they're store-bought frozen patties but I wasn't expecting real crabcakes for $10 anyway. The side of potatoes however was the real shocker. \n\nThey looked like they had been on the grill all day - dark and lethargic looking. Maybe they had gathered all the scraps from the day to make up my portion but boy did they taste that way too. Something about old oil really just breaks it. Some parts were burnt, other parts mushy. They really shouldn't have bothered. \n\nIt settled my hunger, but I definitely didn't leave satisfied.

Very, very pleasant smell of molasses soaked shisha tobacco coming from the place next door  a hookah lounge, unless the businesses are related.  \n\nOk so it is cheap and cheerful-ish but if the front of house needs a good clean, I dread to think what the kitchens are like. I just got the feeling that no-one gives a damn. Maybe I went in on an off-day, or maybe not. I would not return even if it is the closest place to my hotel.

She figured it would be some type of turkey salad with apple chunks.  She had fresh fruit on the side that was a good mix of fresh items and not your standard fare.  I HATE it when restaurants advertise 'Fresh Fruit' and you get a dish of honeydew... SERIOUSLY??? But that wasn't the case here.\n\nMy only issues with the place was the service wasn't phenomenal.

Even trekked 15 mins from the muni exit to get here. My philosophy on restaurants is the lengthier the menu, the worse it taste and sadly this place confirms it. I ordered what I thought is an easy to do \"breakfast savory crepe\" but like the usual American cooking, they stacked it with mounds of cheese and piled on your plate with a lot of food. Quantity doesn't mean quality. And sometimes less is definitely best, especially in this case where all I tasted was a whole lot of cheese. The potatoes were overcooked making it really dry and not properly seasoned.

This marks the second time I've been here, and while the first time was as Joanie S. said, a totally \"random place\", the food is not too, too shabby. \n\nWhy only 3 stars? Apart from the awesome decor, which has a slightly Neoclassicist feel ( that is - the place is slightly ancient looking harking to antiquity with a sour garden palette - but I love that), the food might look decent on a plate but leaves much to be desired: I got the Eggs Florentine (soft poached eggs on spinach and English muffin with Hollandaise sauce) with salad and side of bacon. The sauce was runny and not the best flavor, still, edible and if you had a hangover, like Joanie S., definitely a safe spot to consume for your seemingly disintegrating frontal lobe. The egg whites were runny, which if you order soft poached, the eggs should always be cooked solid while leaving the yolks soft - not all of it soft and gelatinous and looking like a chicken sneezed rather than hatched its egg. The side salad was your typical iceberg mix with a dressing that looking somewhat distinguishable as balsamic vinaigrette (although I'm suspicious). The bacon was the one saving grace and had an excellent crisp finish (thank you: yum). I finished the meal off with a cup of earl grey tea while I was serenaded by the \"Best of...80's Spanish Soap Opera Ballads\" - save me please. \n\nAt least the wifi is free, they have lemon-cucumber water, orange-peel water, and plenty of condiments for all those particulars people prefer for their meals.

We got the mimosa right away, which was not a mimosa but a white wine with a spash of OJ poorly presented. After finding a seat, we noticed a pipe had burst in the ceiling and was dripping. They had placed a towel at the floor to fix it (?). Food arrives - not a bad meal, but definitely not a good one, mediocre at best. The \"hot cider\" we ordered nerver showed up so we asked for it again. The waiter said \"oh okay I will fix it\" ... But it never showed up! Again, the place was practically empty! All in all - food, service, interior and overall experience was way belowe average. There are plenty of good places to eat in SF so I'd stay far away from this place.", "author": "Christine N."}

Her orange juice however, came out of a nifty looking machine that had a bin of orange at the top and would funnel them into line to have them split in half and then crush each half to extract the juice. Fun to watch and you have no doubt that it's \"fresh\". \n\nThe crab cake florentine is pretty much what you would expect. Tasty but light on the crab. Mostly egg and english muffin. I suspect the crab cake was in there somewhere. The potatoes on the side were pretty awful though. They were so dry that even after two swigs of coffee I was having trouble getting all the pieces down. I had one bite and called it quits.

I decided to checkout anyway since it came up when I Yelp'd 'vegan brunch.'\n\nAs far as I was considered, my options (vegan) were rather limited. While they do have a tofu scramble dish on their menu, it comes with eggs, smoked tofu, green pepper, onion, cilantro. While I'm not entirely opposed to the idea, typically a tofu scramble contains what the name implies, TOFU, not also egg. The counter girl seemed confused with I ordered the Tofu Scramble with just tofu and not egg. She thought I only wanted tofu in my scramble.\n\nAfter that awkward experience, the food itself wasn't much better. You think if you order an dish without one of the ingredients then they would augment the dish with the remaining ingredients to make up for said missing item. No, this was not the case. Overall, the dish was palatable but nothing remarkable. Thankfully, I had also ordered a fruit cup which aided in satiating my hunger. Not sure how you can do it but the fruit cup was equally awkward containing predominately apple slices.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to the idea of restaurants opening where others weren't as successful, I find it annoying when the new owners don't go the distance to differentiate the space and interior from the previous tenant. Other then maybe the menu boards and a bad coat of paint, the interior looks like it hasn't changed. Despite occupying a prime corner spot in the building, the space was dreary and drape, definitely not feeding my visual appetite.\n\nIf I lived in San Francisco, I don't think I would count myself as one of their regulars but I might pay them a visit out of a matter of convenience.", "author": "Hael F."}

The caesar salad was large, but nothing worth writing any more about.\n\nSo where does the four star rating come from? Breakfast the next day. Oh yes! Honey Honey can do breakfast quite well. Right down the the freshly squeezed orange juice. So fresh, the juice had been full, intact, unpeeled oranges only minutes before. The Acapulco Omelette was also very satisfactory, and the hashbrowns it came with, well, I know some more mediocre breakfast places that could take a lesson or two from those hashbrowns.\n\nService was quick and efficient, the server bringing me my food even asked if I wanted some butter and jam. When I said yes, he brought over a bowl full of butter packages and an entire tray of jam, not the processed kind in packages, but three kinds sitting in little pots with spoons to dish them out. There was also no butter on my toast to begin with, so I got to decide how much or how little went on there. During the busiest of brunch hours, Honey Honey prevailed. Fours stars, all the way.", "author": "Wendy P."}

There were plenty of different spots that had free wireless internet in the area, but I really connected with this particular place.\n\nSometimes, coffee shops are too much of a scene for me to handle. I don't want to compete for attention with a gaggle of weird emo kids who didn't get enough attention from their fathers growing up... I just want some caffeine. While I ran into plenty of those last week, Honey Honey was anything but a hangout for java snobs. Absolutely no pretentiousness from the staff or patrons, and it had a great vibe from folks reading the newspaper, reading various books... and of course, enjoying the free WiFi action.\n\nThey have a pretty wide array of food stuffs available as well. Everything from soup, sandwiches, pancakes, scrambles, bagel sandwiches and more. I went with the mozzarella, basil and tomato bagel the only time I actually ate there, and it was solid. Almost tasted like a miniature pizza. \n\nThe coffee is nothing to write home about, but it did the trick.\n\nOverall, a great place to grab a relatively quick breakfast without feeling like you should have your nose pierced or have a sleeve full of tattoos to feel comfortable.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

I was in the mood for pancakes or French toast and when I saw the special was granola pancakes with apples I was intrigued enough to go off the regular menu's pancake offering of pancakes with fresh fruit.  Bad move on my part!  The apple slices were cooked and then suspended in some overly corn starched almost glue like rubbery concoction, which was plopped on top of my pancakes.  I was honestly tempted to send it back because it was just so unappetizing, something I almost never do.  Still, I was famished and it certainly tasted OK.\n\nI've noticed from using Yelp out here in the Bay Area that folks seem quite pleased with places rated 3 stars.  Truly A-OK.

I get it- You're busy but being an asshole to your customers often leads to a review something like this. Second: my Bloody Mary was vodka and tomato juice. Thirdly: they didn't have enough pint glasses clean and it took 20 minutes to get our beer after we sat down. Lastly: there was a shard of glass the size of a dime in my meal. They remade it, incorrectly I might add, and didn't offer to refund us or at least buy us a drink or desert of any kind. It was dirty, the tables sat with plates of food on them for long after the customers left, they were too busy and understaffed.

The fruit is fresh and perfectly ripened, however I get the potatoes instead - they are perfection! The bloody mary's are excellent - ask for a little extra spice. The orange juice made by the machine is sooooo good.\nDon't be intimidated by the line. If it's at the door, you will wait about 15 minutes but it's worth it.

I was very excited when looking at the plentiful, colorful chalkboard menu.  Central location if you're looking for something near Union Square.\n\nHowever they only get 3 stars due to: 1) Both savory crepes we ordered were way too cheesy.  2) Tea pot tip was cracked so leakage happening with tea.  3) cappuccino was more like a latte and tepid temperature.\n\nPerhaps other menu choices would have been better.

However, the (constant) line forms amidst the tables, so I can imagine if had been seated among the butts that might have been annoying. \n\nMy Mediterranean Crepe with fruit was delicious. The barrista totally jacked up my latte (full of grounds) but they made it again without too much fuss. The food came out fast, even on a busy weekend. My 4 table-mates all enjoyed their food. The Eggs Benedict and Tofu Scramble that they got looked particularly good.\n\nI really liked the breakfast options on the menu and I had a hard time deciding - there were a lot of things I wanted to try. Also, for those who prefer a vegetarian breakfast there were more fun options than you might find at other places.\n\nWe were tourists staying in Union Square, and as far as a convenient, yummy, nearby breakfast, this was the best spot we found.

I ended up getting the crab cake Florentine and the banana crepe with an iced chai. The food was excellent. I was especially impressed with the crab cake Florentine. Eggs were cooked perfectly. For some reason they give you the choice between soft and not soft, but if you like eggs benedict, get the SOFT option for sure. It came with home fries that were well seasoned and great with hot sauce. The banana crepe was also very good. You can have it with whipped cream or ice cream, but I got it plain. The iced chai was so good I almost went back for another. Atmosphere: the place has plenty of seating though I hear it can get crowded. It IS lively (aka a bit loud for those of you looking for a quiet spot). Just call in advance like I did and ask what the wait is like. It is perfectly acceptable for a single person to get a table here. Order at the counter and they will give you your beverage and a number, then grab a seat.

The first was a quick stop to grab a latte one afternoon (pretty decent latte!).  While grabbing the coffee, we were impressed with their extensive menu and had noted that morning that there was a line out the door (obvy a popular spot) so we decided to return the next morning for brunch.\n\nThe menu at Honey squared is extensive - they have a full range of standard breakfast items (omelettes, eggs benny, pancakes, etc), of course crepes (both sweet and savoury) as well as a bunch of other non-breakfast fair (sandwiches, pastas). \n\nI was seriously craving some sweet breakfast, so I opted for the strawberry nutella crepe, while my dining partner had the croissant breakfast sandwich. \n\nI noticed they had both banana nutella crepes and strawberry nutella crepes on the menu for the same price, so I asked if I could get bananas and strawberries in my crepe. They could do it, but for an extra fee (I didn't pay attention to how much but no more than a dollar or two) - which I obliged to given I wanted that straw-nana goodness.  The fee was a little annoying, but I guess when you crank out as many breakfasts as they do and have such an extensive menu, you need some way to deter people for customizations.\n\nNOTE:  the way this place works is you line up, order and pay, they give you a number, you find a table and then they deliver your meal to you once it is ready. Therefore, if you are feeling real lazy or want to be waited on hand and foot, this is probably not your spot.  But, if you want a decent breakfast without all the fuss, this is your spot.\n\nThere was a bit of a line - but that is to be expected for any good breakfast spot on Sundays during brunch hour.\n\nMy crepe was pretty good - although they probably could have been heavier handed with the fruit. Overall, it was not huge but definitely filled me up for breaky.  My companion enjoyed his croissant, indicating the egg/ham/cheese filling was great but the croissant itself could have been flakier (he knows his croissants).\n\nI tried some of his hash brown potatoes and they were delish - love that they put rosemary in there.\n\nI would definitely return to Honey Honey when back in SF for both my sweet and savory breakfast needs.", "author": "Katherine K."}

To order food you wait in line, grab your number then a table.

We were actually trying to go to Dotties Cafe, but they were on an unexpected vacation conveniently during the days of our visit. A nice couple told us about Honey Honey, which is just around the corner.\n\nThe Cafe has a Carribean feel, and pretty good food. I ordered their special Pecan Banana pancakes and my husband got the Huevos Rancheros. The pancakes were tasty, with whole, cinnamon roasted pecans inside the cakes and on top. My only gripe is they seemed a little tough. The Huevos were also tasty, with a nice, smokey chipotle chili salsa. \n\nWhen I was ordering, I was having a hard time deciding between the pancakes and the blintz. The cashier suggested the pancakes, so I decided to go with her suggestion. Later she came over and offered us a FREE blintz so I could try it. How awesome is that?? The blintz was tasty. I had never tried one before and it was filled with ricotta and cottage cheese and some tasty orange marmalade. The presentation was beautiful. \n\nGreat service, I would definitely go back.", "author": "Kim R."}

But it's a diner that is pretending to be a fancy breakfast place without delivering. Let me get something straight: I love diners. I love the slightly grimy tabletops and the mediocre coffee and the scrambled eggs that came off the griddle that hasn't been cleaned in 25 years. I love that stuff. But this place serves diner level food at SF-level prices. The music is terribly loud (and in general, terrible), the eggs and Bloody Mary's are pretty bland. But the worst thing was the bacon. Bacon can only be ordered as a side. For $3. What we got back was, at best, cardboard on a plate. It was awful and inedible.\n\nMore offensive was the price. Two orders of mediocre eggs and potatoes with a side of (dry) bacon, a cafe au lait, a glass of orange juice, and a Bloody Mary was $35.

Not screaming, but \"a little\".  It was pretty spacious and couple probably seat close to 60-70 people.\n\nThey had a large chalkboard menu up on the near wall.

The people there were nice enough.\n\nI sat down with my orange juice and within a few minutes, my food came out.  It looked ok.  The side of home fries looked like were left sitting on the griddle for too long and were kind of charred.  Well, let's just say \"extra crispy\".  The hollandaise, canadian bacon, and muffin were fine, but the eggs were undercooked.  I mean, I love me some runny egg yolks.  Perfect for steak and eggs, but slightly underdone egg whites?  Not that I was worried about salmonella poisoning or whatever, it's just unappealing.\n\nThe potatoes were only as good as they looked.  Lacked flavor and underseasoned.

You are FAR too generous, Yelpers. \n\nFirst of all, for those who are not going to read this whole review: track down a Crepevine in SF and go there instead. Their menu is almost identical, but Crepevine's food is worth eating. \n\nWe ordered coffees, a scramble (tofu), and a savory crepe (New Orleans). \n\nThe coffee was total Folgers crap. I swear it had no flavor and a single drop of half & half turned it white as snow. \n\nNext, the tofu scramble could have been better assembled by 4th graders. It had eggs, smoked tofu, bell peppers, onions, and parsley. I can't imagine a more flavorless assemblance of ingredients, but something that seemed incredibly promising was nearly inedible in reality. The potatoes were OK, but rather bland. My english muffin wasn't toasted-- just plopped on the plate. \n\nFinally, my New Orleans crepe had rubbery, stinky chicken, raw mushrooms (not sauteed?!?), clumps of sundried tomatoes, and a ton of Swiss cheese. The cheese was a little overpowering, but thank goodness for the bounty of it because it was the only tasty thing in the crepe! The crepe itself was more of a pancake; it was thick and sweet. Imagine some thinned out Bisquick spread into a crepe. That was the crepe. It also came with the potatoes mentioned above. \n\nOverall, their menu looks promising. It looks like they took their time putting it together. However, it's their actual FOOD that they need to take some time in putting it together. So many of these problems could have been fixed by a somewhat talented cook.", "author": "Lindsey A."}

I visited for breakfast, after spending my first morning in San Francisco at Dottie's True Blue Cafe. Unlike Dottie's, I was the only person waiting outside the cafe when they opened at 7:30am! If you don't want to risk a wait, Honey Honey Cafe & Crepery is a much safer bet. \n\nWhile it was gray and raining when I visited, I think the cafe would be absolutely beautiful on a sunny day. I sat in the center of the cafe on a circular bench around a tile pillar that had tables arranged around it - a nice way to have a sense of a communal breakfast without actually having to talk to anyone before you've had your coffee!\n\nWhen I visited, there were only two employees - the cashier/waitress and the cook. It was not super-crowded, but service was slow and I got the impression that she was annoyed with me for being waiting when the cafe opened. You order your food at the register then bring a number to your table - it can be difficult to juggle coffee/silverware/juice/water/whatever and the setup of the front counter was somewhat awkward. \n\nI wish I had tried one of the crepes, because my neighbors' breakfasts looked delicious! I was feeling somewhat rushed as - like I said, the cashier did not seem so thrilled that I was waiting outside the door - and was a little confused upon entering (do I take a seat? are there menus? do I just go up and order?). The answers are: hang out and look at the giant menu on the wall, the giant menu is on the wall, and yes - once you've figured out what you want to eat.  There's a lot on offer so it might take you a while! I ended up having a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with potatoes, and while it was nothing special, it was a good breakfast for a reasonable price.", "author": "Laura S."}

There were savory and sweet crepes, sandwiches, pastas, salads, and breakfast foods. I settled on the North Beach crepe with chicken, mushrooms, onions, spinach, and swiss cheese. I recommend getting the Hollandaise sauce on the side, as the crepe by itself was rich and tasty enough with all the cheese. The chicken was tender and had some kind of cajun seasoning - it was a winner with the mushrooms. I liked how my crepe wasn't soggy, as it often is at other places I've been. My dining companion had the chicken pesto crepe, which was good, but nothing to write home about. Savory crepes come with a choice of salad, fruit, or potatoes, and are all around $7-10.\n\nThe restaurant itself was cute and laid back.

It wasn't a life-changing experience - in fact, the cheese wasn't quite melted enough, and the bell peppers could have been more finely diced. But I think I get the idea behind the dish now, and I like it.\n\nI came in the next week and got the french toast, and it was better than the crepe was. Some of the better french toast I've ever had, actually.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty crazy-busy, especially around breakfast time on the weekends. You get in and order at the counter, then try to find a table. Emphasis on the try; I had to wait a while before a table opened up. Unfortunately, there's not much designed for singles (no diner-style eating counter here), so I felt kind of bad taking up a two-person table in the crowded restaurant. Oh well, I'm a speedy eater.\n\nPrices are pretty steep (especially for beverages; why is there nowhere in this city where I can get a glass of orange juice with breakfast for under three dollars?), but everything looked at least passable, and most of the food I saw around me looked positively delicious.

There are some fantastic vegetarian crepes out there, but the ones from Honey Honey were subpar.\n\nThe bad:\n\nOur crepes were slightly burnt. Not brown burnt, but black around the edges burnt.\n\nThey both were loaded with too much cheddar cheese which just threw the balance off and after a few bites all you could taste was cheddar.\n\nThere was hardly any spinach in the Florentine, let alone few olives and artichokes in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Potato wedges we received with both dishes were overcooked and if they weren't stale, then they really came close to it. I had to douse them in hot sauce to wet them down a bit.\n\n\n\nThe good: \n\nThey do have some good green chili sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-22", "description": "Sometimes I have a strong and persistent craving for breakfast/brunch foods. I had one of those cravings about a week ago. Where did I want to go to satisfy this need? Squat and Gobble. I like squat because it's good and it's a nice place to hang out and just talk. Food there is good, but nothing to DIE for.\n\nI'm glad I wasn't able to go there that day after all. \n\nMy friend that I was meeting up for lunch was not anywhere near squat and gobble, and it was just more convenient to get lunch near the area she was around. I was disappointed at first, but that disappointment didn't last long. She suggested honey honey, and I said, \"fine\".\n\nDriving around that area was kind of a bitch. I've driven around that area many times, but it was still a bitch because drivers in and near downtown are just a bunch of impatient bitches. I finally parked around the restaurant. I was a bit frustrated from the terrible experience on the road, but I was more annoyed when I had to pay the parking meter. I live in the peninsula and I'm not accustomed to carrying tons of change intended for parking meters. I had enough for 15 minutes. That was annoying.\n\nI walk inside and meet up my friend. \"Wow\", I say in my head, \"it's pretty cute!\". We order quickly so that I can get change to fill that meter again. I order the pesto crepe because the guy at the cashier recommended it. My friend got the salsa crepe. I also ordered a chocolate belgian waffle and a cup of coffee. The guy also gave me tons of quarters to pay the parking meter. I was happy :)\n\nFirst sip of the coffee. \"Damn!!!!!!\", I'm thinking. Only in SF can you get some damned good coffee. Honey honey certainly has some serious good, bold but not too bold, slightly sweet, and aromatic coffee. \n\nMy first impression of the crepe. Hmm, kinda small, but looks pretty, at least. First bite into the crepe, \"FUCK\", I think. It was absolutely delicious. Every ingredient was flavorful and fresh. I'm not kidding you. Crepevine aint got nothing on honey honey. \n\nFirst bite into that chocolate waffle. *OoOoOooOoOOo*, chocolate GOODNESS. I can't explain it. It was great. The warm, melted chocolate had taken over my taste buds and I was damn near nirvana, I gotta say.\n\nAfter lunch, we chit chatted, drank some more coffee, and smoked a few cigarettes (outdoor seating available). I was no longer sore about the shitty experience driving around that area. I was also fine with needing to get quarters every 40 minutes to feed that meter. (even though my friend ran to the meter and inserted the quarters cuz i'm fuckin lazy) Honey Honey was well worth the minor annoyances of life :)\n\nlove honey honey!!!", "author": "Bonita C."}

My partner in crime and I decided to come here because it was right down the street from our hotel and we love a good breakfast place.  We ended up ordering the Florentine Crepe (spinach, cheddar, and cottage cheese), the Eggs Benedict, the Blintz (dessert crepe).\n\nThe interior was charming with an easy to read menu written on the wall.  The flavored water was refreshing (orange or cucumber, basil, and lemon). The portion sizes were generous, which also included a side for each order.  The system seemed pretty straight forward - order at the register, take a number to table, and the food is delivered 10-15 minutes later.    \n\nThe poached eggs were cooked as requested - yes, they ask for easy, medium, or hard! - but the potatoes were overly seasoned with rosemary (something I personally pair with a roast chicken dinner and not breakfast food).  The biggest dissapointment though was the crepe - it was good, just nothing special!  Perhaps I should have ordered something with sausage or ham in it in, because the spinach combination lacked umpf (maybe some mushrooms in to make it \"meaty\"?) The crepes themselves were much thicker than I expected - literally a thin IHOP pancake and not a more delicate crepe, although I suppose its thickness was deliberate in order to stand up to the filling, which was generous. Suggestion: Two traditionally thin crepes with filling instead of one thick crepe with lots of filling.  My partner and I also ordered the Blintz (strawberry and marmalade dessert crepe) and we were told it would come out 10 minutes after our \"entrees\".  Cool, but after a few bites of our entrees, we requested to cancel the Blintz because, truly, there was so much food! Our request was denied because \"they were already making the Blintz.\"  Really? You can't scrap a crepe? Can't prepare it for the next person's order? It's a spoonful of batter on a griddle! (I assume, anyways)  I'm not asking to cancel a 20 minute made-to-order souffl\u00e9 or a well done steak. Grudgingly, we accepted the to-go box with the crepe and took it with us to the airport.  Needless to say, when stomach space allowed me to dig in, it was a big soggy mess - once again, those thick crepes! In the trash it went. How disappointing.  \n\nIn summary - Cute, but for those who value quality over quantity, look elsewhere.", "author": "Angela N."}

We had no problem getting a table at 12:30 on Sunday.\n\nAfter studying the large hand-drawn menus hanging over the counter, my S.O. and I decided to split two dishes: the Athens omelet, which contained spinach and feta and came with crispy home fries, and a strawberry/Nutella crepe with whipped cream. Mmmmm. We're both glad we didn't each just order a sweet crepe, as it would have been too much sugar in one sitting, but half was just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. The omelet was yummy -- savory, which balanced out the crepe nicely. The potatoes were tasty, too -- it's not often that I get homefries with some crisp, and these were great. We also got coffee, which was only $1.25 for unlimited refills -- and our server was always on top of those refills.\n\n[Edited 6/5/2009 to add that I completely forgot that we also shared a side order of bacon. Unfortunately, the bacon was forgettable -- not crispy, a little on the fattier side.]\n\nHoney Honey was a great environment for catching up with friends: relaxed, unpretentious, bright, with good service and delicious food. Next time I'm in SF for brunch, I'll certainly consider returning.\n\nTip: If driving, save yourself some time to find parking. If you can't find street parking, there's a garage right around the corner with a flat rate of $10.", "author": "Wendy K."}

I have yet to find a good crepe in LA and this by far is the best one I've had in this state. I haven't been to France yet but I'm sure it is oh so heavenly, authentic and devine but the Honey Honey Cafe serves up a really good crepe and to me the food is what it's all about. \n\nI love savory crepes and since it was bordering on brunch time, I had to go with the breakfast crepe with a side order of potatoes.  Order at the counter and pay at the same time. Grab your seat and minutes later your food comes to you. SImple concept. Decent little spot, doesnt give me the vibe of a place you'd linger or want to lounge at, but it does the trick for a better than fast food, sit down establishment. \n\nReasonable prices, tasty crepes, what else more could you ask for?", "author": "ruth n."}

Honey Honey has a hi-tech fresh-squeezed OJ machine, circa 1985. It might have come from Doc Brown's house. Would not be surprised if it had a flux capacitor. Ergo, I ordered the orange juice, and hoped for a stammered invitation to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.\n\nBeing a visitor to SFO, I decided to go for crepes; ordered the Torino crepe with breakfast potatoes. How one makes a mediocre crepe is beyond me, but said mediocre crepe turned out to be a too-dry, pancake-like mess, with a mere teaspoonful of lukewarm tomatoes, feta and mushrooms inside. It would be appropriate to call the fillings a \"garnish.\"\n\nThe potatoes were very good overall - seasoned really well and not greasy at all, though one or two were a bit, shall we say, CRUNCHILY RAW for my taste.\n\nFYI: somehow my small OJ and coffee cost about as much as my mediocre crepe.", "author": "Tam G."}

I had just finished managing a One Brick group of volunteers at Glide that morning and I was looking for a local place that  was: 1)Open on a Sun. 2) In walking distance 3) Relatively inexpensive 4) Served beer (a key plus in post-volunteering outings). The Yelp app led me to a few local choices, but Honey Honey won out for fitting all of the above criteria.\n\nThe place is seated righted on the corner like a drop of honey in a not-so-sweet area of town. The inside is spacious and light. It's one of those places with a chalkboard menu and a ton of choices, spanning breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus beer & wine among other beverage selections. Lots of choices to please a crowd. I liked that they had printed menus as well, for the near-sighted among us, plus a pile of Sudoku puzzles for the hyperactive among us to fill out as we waited.  I also had the owner take an interest in One Brick and gave her more info. about volunteering. Nothing like a little networking with noshing.\n\nMy sandwich was delicious and included not only a side of potatoes, but also a sizeable side salad with choice of dressing on the side. Normally I'm never one to not finish a whole sandwich, but my tasty, big baguette sandwich had me happily stuffed and wrapping up the other half. Free refills too (though not on the beer). As much as I enjoyed my choice, I had a little entree envy eying the warm chicken salad another person in our group ordered. Next time, I told myself, for indeed, this visit was sweet enough to merit many return trips. Honey Honey proved every bit as sweet as its name.", "author": "Megan K."}

Plus, the staff was super friendly.  I appreciated the thoughtful, free water pitchers by the register, one lightly flavored with orange slices and the other with lemon and lime slices.\n\nI had the Pesto crepe (cheddar and feta, pesto, pine nuts, tomatoes, spinach and avocado).  Delicious, with flavors that balanced together perfectly.  Be sure to order the potatoes (rather than the fruit or salad) on the side.  They are quite amazing, and given in more then ample portion (can be split easily between 2 hungry people).  My friends ordered a crepe with salmon, avocado, capers and a few other ingredients...in my opinion, way too salty...but they seemed to love it.  The cheese blintzes are nothing to write home about, but are safely satisfactory.  \n\nIf I lived in San Francisco and near this part of town, I'd likely frequent this crepery once a month.

This is kind of picky, but the strawberries that came with it were not at all ripe, which would be acceptable if we were in New England and it were winter, but neither are true.  The internet is fine, a bit slow, but they have kind of loud music and small tables, so I don't think this will be my new internet place.  However, they have so many good sounding food choices.\n\nOne thing I wanted to mention that made this a place I will definitely come back to, the staff was just plain nice.  Small things really made this place for me.  Offering to refill my coffee, the little bit of chit chat at the counter waiting to pay.  The flavored waters is a nice touch, and they are free!", "author": "Lizzy G."}

When we went, it was packed, so we were lucky to be able to find a decent spot for 2. I think we took the last seats, so I felt bad for everyone behind us. It meant they had to scrounge around for a place to sit.\n\nI ordered a pesto omelet which was pretty frickin' delish. And honestly, I forgot what the boy ordered. Hah. We also ordered a strawberry and nutella crepe. Sadly, this crepe was a big fail. The biggest fail part was the fact that the crepe was still super hot when they slabbed on the nutella and strawberries, so by the time we ate it, it was one big mess of melted chocolate and soggy warm strawberries which in turn, made the crepe soggy as well.\n\nSigh.

My complaint would be that it was basically the same price as a crepe, but about 1/2 the size. They def could have put more smoked salmon on it for the $7.61 it cost me.\n\nBut back to the point, the ingredients were all really fresh and yummy and everything that I saw go by to other tables made me want to order a second meal. But since I'm a poor soon-to-be student, I held back.\n\nThe place has nice atmosphere and the staff were very nice.

Service is somewhat DIY: order at the register and they bring your food to you when it's done. \n\nThe Eden cr\u00eape I had was pretty great -- Fontina cheese, smoked salmon, capers, red onions. Their cr\u00eapes are a bit doughy, could maybe use a bit lighter batter. The potatoes that came with it were good, if a little heavy on the rosemary. For $8.95 it was perfectly acceptable but nothing special considering you can get more food of the same quality for less at a place like Cr\u00eapes A Go-go in Berkeley. \n\nI'd go back if I was in the area again, probably to try one of their other breakfast plates.", "author": "Sam K."}

There were at least 5 empty tables but they were all dirty with dishes.  I witnessed an employee emerge into the seating area only to BS with a customer while many tables needed tending to.

He wasn't the only employee looking for something to do and failing miserably.  \n\nThat said, once the order process was complete, I was surprised how soon it was that we received our food.

I love a little \"hair of the dog\" on a Sunday morning! My girlfriend & I ordered Eggs Benedict because we LOVE it. Hollandaise on the side. My hubby ordered the chicken pesto crepe. The potatoes were great. Very flavorful with fresh parsley. Our Benny's were perfectly cooked and the Hubby's crepe was delicious. Exactly what we needed.

The food is great and the portions of course large, but they're not some kind of super-chef invention. I need to go back a few more times to find my favorite dish. The prices are very favorable and it's a short wait.", "author": "Matt T."}

Now I love me a crab cake, anything seafood has my heart but crab cakes for breakfast? I ordered my Florentine w/ eggs medium, grabbed my number and got my self serve water (it's flavored water, yummy and free). A short wait later I was served two golden crab cakes each sitting on a bed of sauteed spinach and English muffin topped off w/ eggs and hollandaise sauce. A side of seasoned potatoes was the dam that kept the lake of hollandaise sauce from spilling over my plate. The combination of the flavors made my mouth so happy. I am now convinced that crab cakes are A-OK for breakfast. I went back a few days later and had the eggs benedict.  This time the potatoes tasted a bit off, cooked a few mins longer than needed.  The food overall left me satisfied once again. Good location, nice mix of tourist and locals, free WiFi and lots of choices. One day I'll be back to actually try the crepes.", "author": "Jamie A."}

For lunch I had a soup and salad combination which was also delicious. I like the fact that they have free wifi, however, I wasn't able to find any outlets around the tables so it's not a place you can stay at to \"work from home\" which is what I was wanting to do (yes, I usually stake out at Starbucks for at least 5 hours at a time).

The best part of my meal was the fresh fruit cup.

This thing was overstuffed, and barely resembled any true cr\u00eape I've seen. I probably wouldn't have minded its size had it tasted good. I shouldn't say that. My cr\u00eape tasted good, but not remotely like crab cake. Maybe falafel or fried breadcrumb ball. There was no crab flavor to this over-fried ball, which fell apart due to dryness. My BF had the eggplant cr\u00eape which I tried a bite of and it was delicious, so I'm sure I just chose poorly. His cr\u00eape was also enormous. He also had a bloody Mary, which was made from store bought mix and Tabasco sauce and black pepper. Meh. If we lived in SF and weren't just visiting, I might give them another chance with a sweet cr\u00eape or another savory cr\u00eape, but I can't recommend the half moon bay or their bloody Mary's.

(But yes, they are yummy!)They also serve beer and wine and have free wi-fi with a purchase (the password is their phone number).  It tends to get pretty busy during standard brunch times, but other than that, there tends to be plenty of space.", "author": "Cersei T."}

The setup is somewhat \"self service\" -- you wait in line, order your food, and find a table. On weekends, the place is pretty busy. Prices are very reasonable (under $10 for omelets or savory crepes) -- and even less for French toast or some desert-type crepes. They also make fresh orange juice \"on the spot\" with one of those orange crusher machines similar to what you'd see at Jamba Juice. Our food was good and abundant. It wasn't a good place to linger due to the lines -- you feel a little pressure to leave as soon as you're done so others can find a table. I rate it three stars because when it's busy, it can be a problem to find a table. Your food could be ready before there's any place to sit, especially if you're in a larger group (in our case, we needed a table for 5). Then again, it wouldn't be crowded if the food were bad or it was a poor value. For the area around Union Square, this is one of the better breakfast joints around. I would go back again and try some of the crepes next time. Overall a good find in the area and would go back again.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Good: \nPriced right\nGood quantity\nGood variety\nFresh juices and fruit salad options\n\nConsiderations:\nCan feel rushed\nLimited seated on busy mornings\nSelf-service\nMay need to stand in line to order and wait for a table", "author": "Greg L."}

Since the show was at 1:00 we decided to come up early for brunch.  We did a bit of yelp research and was also recommended this one cafe but the wait is normally an hour on the weekends.  Husband didn't want to deal with the wait so we kept researching and came across Honey Honey.  At first I was apprehensive because I'm very picky about the reviews.  First, the more reviews the better.  Second, the reviews need to be detailed.  Husband really pushed for HH and he pointed out that maybe it was new and that's why it didn't receive that many reviews yet.  So, I relented.\n\nI'm glad I did!  First of all it was a mere couple blocks from the Curran Theater, which was a huge plus.  Second, the atmosphere was so homey and what I like to think an urban cafe is like or if I was in Berkeley.  They had a wide range of sandwiches, crepes, other breakfast-type items, etc.  Husband got the chicken pesto crepe and I got a salmon version of Eggs Benedict.  We grabbed a table next to the window and although the view wasn't that great what with the beams crisscrossing across the windows it was still nice with the light coming in.  Our food came pretty quick and we immediately dove in.  The salmon was yummy and although one of the egg's yolk was fully cooked the other one was nice and runny!  Hollandaise sauce wasn't too overpowering, which I like.  Husband was digging his crepe until a couple minutes later the server returned telling us he gave us the wrong crepe.  It's interesting how Husband didn't notice there wasn't any chicken OR pesto in his crepe but maybe that's a true testament to the goodness of it.  The server was so kind and apologetic and immediately brought us the chicken pesto.  So we got 3 dishes for the price of 2.  The chicken pesto was very good as well as the supposed \"chicken pesto.\"  The rosemary potatoes were good and we enjoyed the different flavored water.\n\nAnd the best part?

Not being from the area, my friend allowed me and two other friends to stay at her place while she was gone for the week which is located two blocks from this charming little cafe. When we dragged ourselves to set out to search what was in near by walking distance, one of the locals told us to try this place out and now I am forever indebted to him. This homey little neighborhood cafe had such an inviting and cozy atmosphere with yellow tables and fixtures that gave it a cute character ,somehow made me feel as though this was my community too even though I was from out of state.\nThe menu was very extensive, especially in the crepes department which was fabulous except for the fact that I knew I wouldn't be able to order 3 out of the ten crapes that I wanted. Geesh, talk about decision making when hung over! Our server, Abdi, was very attentive and friendly and was concerned when one of my friends wasn't really eating her soup. He thought she didn't like it and quickly wanted to replace it with something else to satisfy her. We had to explain  that the soup was great, but she just was not feeling too well so she had to take it slow. My chicken pesto crepe was absolutely fantastic with large chunks of quality white meat and chunky veggies accompanied by a side cup of holindaze sauce and a glorious assorted fresh fruit cup. All for $9.73 when ordering water for a drink. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would frequently dine here, but I guess that it'll be in spirit when my friend chooses to do so.", "author": "Yolanda G."}

What I like though, aside from good crepes/breakfasts, is the burgers.  Granted, they don't have as big a selection as a place like Pearl's down the street, but in my opinion the quality is on par with it, and it's cheaper.  At Honey Honey you can get a good sized burger and fries (regular or curly) for about the same price as just a burger at Pearl's.  Now that's what I call value.", "author": "Matt N."}

My boyfriend had the chorizo scamble - it's not hard to mess up eggs but the scramble was a disaster. The homefries/potatoes were half mush and half burnt crust that looked like it was scraped off the grill. The only decent part of my breakfast was a tiny fruit cup and a glass of fresh squeezed OJ (although the OJ was totally warm). We'll never eat here again!

Once I saw that sign for crepes I was a fan, then I tried them....yum...crepes were very good, sandwiches etc all is good! And reasonably priced too, another perk! Give it a try for a late breakfast or lunch, you'll probably love it too!", "author": "Kristin L."}

My husband and I can each get a crepe and drink for under $25.00 which I think is a bargain.  I recommend the Miami Heat crepe or the pesto crepe.  They are both great.  I have never had breakfast here but I'm sure I eventually will.  I've been going to this place for 2 years and I will continue to.", "author": "GINA M."}
