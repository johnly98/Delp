Fortunately for me, this Starbucks made that experience smooth and easy. The icing on the cake was a friendly barista (your hair was looking great, girl!) who started my day off right. My only regret is not asking her name for this review! \n\nNot being a lover of strong coffee tasting drinks, I went with a chai tea latte. Paired with a croissant it was the perfect mild caffeine and food combination to get me started. The place was empty save for one other customer frantically typing on a laptop in a far corner. Yet another weird observation from the naked city...\n\nWho knows how this place may change once the rest of the world wakes up. I just know it was a smooth experience for me!", "author": "Alex L."}

The service at this location, overall is very very good! I especially love when \"Liz\" is working as she's a real sweetheart and has been working there I'd say, at least, eight years. It's always great catching up with her.\n\nThe only reason why I give this location four stars, instead of five, is due to the influx of homeless constantly streaming in and out, demanding patrons give them money. The real kicker is how the homeless steals tips from the tip jar which are monies the baristas (employees) need to pay their high rent in San Francisco. I was told (at another Starbucks location) that the employees are automatically taxed based on earning $1 per hour in tips no matter what. So if the tips are stolen, they are still taxed on their paycheck. I do not like how the homeless who steal are given more flexibility than the employees.\n\nBut all that aside, I still love getting drinks from this Starbucks location. The employees do a great job!", "author": "Peter C."}

The people at the cashier also take awhile taking orders and making drinks, so the line moves slowly and it takes awhile getting drinks.\n\nThat being said, I like that the Starbucks is conveniently located. It is pretty standard for a Starbucks, with standard drinks. Nothing that special. I've gotten mixed services: some of the baristas/cashiers are not very friendly, but a few of them are patient and nice, especially as I'm trying to find my starbucks gift card or coupon. \n\nRecently, I've had some trouble activating my Starbucks coupons. I went three times trying to figure out a \"buy one get one free\" coupon I had on my Starbucks app. The first time, they told me I had to buy a drink first and come back later with the receipt to get a drink (which it didn't say in the app). The second time I came with the receipt, the Starbucks code in my app for the BOGO drink didn't work. Finally, the third time I came in, it worked. Don't know what it was. BUT, that third time, the cashier not only gave us the free drink, but also gave us another drink! That made up for some of the less positive experiences that I had there, and makes me more likely to go back.", "author": "Julianna K."}

I come here occasionally when I shop downtown, but I feel like all the baristas/cashiers have some kind of attitude problem. I get it, it's the Union Square location and it's probably busy all day, but they seriously look like they hate their jobs. I was the next person in line, and after the cashier finished taking the order of the person in front of me, they called \"Next\" and then just blankly stared at me. No \"What can i get for you?\" or whatever other Starbucks workers (at all other locations I've been to) say. I don't expect you to be overly friendly or start a full on conversation with me but the vibe I was getting from the cashier was just rude. It's pretty basic customer service...this happens almost every time I'm here. \n\nI ordered an iced soy matcha latte and when I got it, it was barely mixed and I could both taste and see all the unblended matcha powder at the bottom. It made my drink bitter with all the matcha powder at the bottom and the top just tasted like straight soy milk. I asked the barista if they could blend my drink some more and the guy kind of just looked at me and then stared at my drink. After a couple seconds he offered to pour my drink into a different cup without all the powder at the bottom. Um, not what I asked for and it defeats the purpose of a 'matcha latte' if all the matcha at the bottom is thrown out. But I didn't want to be any more difficult so I just took the new cup.\n\nIf you can hold off on your Starbucks craving, I would skip this location and walk a few more blocks to the next closest one.", "author": "Cecille W."}

The barista realized there were no coffee beans in the machine, but thats another incident.\n\nI literally buy iced lattes every fucken day for the last 8 years. Anyways point being I know how my fucking latte should taste. I go back to the barista and ask him to remake it and told him its all milk and lacking expresso. So he remakes it and its the same fucking drink, milky. Either their machine is fucked up or they need to refill the coffee beans. I mentioned it was milky again and the barista then went on and tried to educate me that a tall iced latte is milk and 1 shot. Great thanks for letting me know you know how to complete your remedial task of pouring a cup of milk, pushing a button for the shot of expresso and adding ice. So he then said he can add another shot of expresso. So after he adds the shot he announces the drink double shot iced latte and adds for the third time. Then proceeds to ask if everything is ok with my drink.\n\nOk you fucking douche. Before I go ballistic and talk to your manager I look over and see my son waiting and decide to let it go.

Yes he saw me but, okay fine, whatever.\n\nSo finally I'm standing in from of an barista at the cash register, a paunchy white dude with dark brown hair. I'm thinking, \"Great, there's no way he doesn't see me. It's so obvious there's no way for him to ignore me.\"\n\nMe: Hi there!

At this point I don't know whether to say \"grande\" or medium since he might be a douche about the English thing if i say \"grande\" but is the sort of person you could totally see going \"we don't have a grande on the menu\" I say \"grande\" and we go through the same racist s**t all over again except this time faster.\n\nHe makes some comments about how \"tough\" it is that i'm sick and that he hopes i feel better. it's one thing to talk with a flat affect and/or not to care but it's a whole different thing to manage to say that sort of thing in a way that actually manages to sound mean and sarcastic.", "author": "A J."}

But now, the gloves are off.\n\nOur hotel had a Starbucks attached to it, and after having just woken up in the Pacific time zone, I needed a jolt. Mind you, I was totally lucid - just mainly stupid for breaking my rule.\n\nFirst off: why do I have this rule? Because Starbucks has gotten to big to succeed. With a few notable exceptions where baristas and other workers are well-trained, I leave these places feeling like an idiot-sucker dumb-ass, desperate for a quick jolt of java.\n\nSo I approach the counter, and I could already tell the vibe in the place was not good. (Other Yelpers like Kimberly S. have cited the service, so I concur with them - but I hadn't read those reviews before going in.)\n\nI asked for a Cafe Americano and a Latte. The barista snuck up behind the cashier and started to confirm my order while the cashier was still talking to me. They were literally talking over each other. I put up my hands and said, \"wait, one at a time please.\" I thought that was a reasonable and even a little bit funny thing to say.\n\nThat didn't go over well. After I reconfirmed my order, the cashier handed my change to me - and I'm quoting - \"Maybe your latte will wake you up a little.\"\n\nWhat I wanted to say was GFY lady, but I didn't. I just waited for my coffee and headed back to my hotel room.\n\nWhat these chains don't understand is that one bad apple spoils the bunch.

They have helped people get their stolen bags back, provided excellent service, and protected us from some very scary people. Frankly, I expected to see much better reviews when I looked them up. Of course they make mistakes. There is a margin for human error, but isn't \"human\" supposed to be the whole idea behind Starbucks?\n\nThe team here is amazing. I imagine you can't last long with the intensity of the environment, though. The store is often a non-stop flow of foreigners, students, FiDi guys, and locals until about 1 or 2 in the afternoon. But even when they're packed, they manage to make your drink swiftly, and get you through the line.

Its actually bigger than I would expect given locale but it is always packed and hard to find a seat. This is more of a get your item/s and go place, but to me coffee places should be set up so that you can sit back and relax so minus a star there. Also minus a star because hey, as far as taste goes I mean common' its the Bay Area, there are so many great coffee places out there.\n\n3 stars - great staff/service, and a little nudge for the iced green tea", "author": "Kari I."}

It took me about 11 minutes to get my drink. I had expressed to them that I had to get back to work. They were talking more than they were working \"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL\". And to make matters worse, my drink was TERRIBLE.    NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN! If I could give them a minus star I would :-(", "author": "Monee C."}

It ended with 55 points hung up on my alma mater. I then became a little cranky. Actually truth be told, I was a lot cranky. I decided to bail on my friends and catch a late night flight home back to SFO.\n\nI woke up this morning still feeling cranky and decided it would be best if I just went into the office. Who cares if it was 5:50 in the morning I wasn't going to sleep anyway. \n\nAfter just an hour of trying to work I thought about my true love in life---Hot Cocoa--- And I believe now is the time to fill you on my official 2009 hot chocolate ratings. So here you go, your guide to the best (and worst) of hot cocoa 2009.\n\nStarbucks 7 out of 13. A bit heavy and syrupy. The milk flavor is hidden but I have my way of ordering that can greatly improve your experience.\n\nPeets 8 out of 14. A little lighter than it's Starbucks counterpart with a little more froth as well. Careful ordering it \"extra hot\" because they will.\n\nSpecialties 11 out of 15. One of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. It's almost perfect and reminds of hot cocoa that you would find in Europe. Nice color as well, much like a fine wine.\n\nSwiss Miss 9 out of 16. Yes, these packets of dried up cocoa is underrated. Used best with warm milk, but do not be afraid to mix with hot water as the yummy flavor remains. \n\nTown Hall 18 out of 20. The best hot chocolate in the City, hands down. If you live within 50 miles of this p;lace, it's worth the drive. Trust me on this.\n\nThe vending machine at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation 3 out of 9. It's just piping hot water with a dash of something brown. \n\nStarbucks (any airport location) 6 out of 14. Yes, your Starbucks experience at the airport is different than what you are used to. This is true.\n\nThere you have it. My 2009 ratings of hot cocoa.

However, if you're looking for a place to settle down for a while, never ever choose this place. It's far too touristy, the volume of traffic means that their wi-fi is terrible, and the music plays very loudly. If you want a quick coffee and snack, this place is good. If you want to get some work done, it's just totally wretched.", "author": "Brighid M."}

Because I remember what this was before it was Starbucks. Because it was an awesome, \"I feel like I'm in Europe\", gorgeous little French cafe/pastisserie. I used to always look forward to coming here - especially on rainy and cold days - ahhhh - it always felt so luxurious, so wonderful....\n\n...unlike Starbucks. \n\nImpersonal, almost rude service from teenager employees and sitting at a table near gangs of Chinese boys trying to score with the barista....tragic. And don't even get me started on how they took all the gorgeous wood and marble counters out and replaced them with Starbucks issue formica countertops and chalkboards! Aaaaaa! \n\nI guess the closest I can come to describing it is like I was going to visit an old friend and finding that friend dead. With their head chopped off.

I mean, come on there is already one down the street.  So, if I had to pick between this location and the other on Stockton, this one is better and should stay.  The other one should be a nice little cafe with fresh salads for the workers of the area.  Heck, even a McDonald's would be better.\n\nI prefer this location because it is larger and the set up is cozy with more room for the long line.  They also have outdoor seating which is nice for those who enjoy a smoke with their coffee, or just want to relax outdoors.  2 stars just for scoring this corner, but heck they can afford it.\n\nThe new and/or transferred staff is superior - 3 more stars.  They move FAST, yet are still able to give each customer personal attention and can make almost any type of twist to your beverage that you request.\n\nThe food is fresh and displayed very nicely.  There is no overcooked, lingering food odor here; you will not leave this shop smelling like a french fry.\n\nSo, even though it is a Starbucks and they are all regarded the same, I have high hopes this one will be the gem of all other other 20 in the area.", "author": "Yasmin E."}

SCORE. \n\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nIn the heart of tourist central, and the bottom corner of Sir Francis Drake Hotel, this place has a warm mystical air about it, with foreigners speaking in their own languages, grabbing a late night coffee in their respective groups.. almost a warm nostalgic feel of summer camp nights far away from home, in a new foreign place bonding with friends with no care of what's to happen in the following week because you're on vacation with sole focus of exploring and relaxing.. or the feel reminds me of going on holiday to an interesting new place, but seeking refuge in a cafe before venturing back out to a new ravines of the city. Plus the actual physical inside paneling are that of a darker, charming wood, fitting theme of Sir Francis Drake's old ornate antique-like decor and charming ambiance. Not too many seats, a bar seating facing out the windows and maybe few small tables. There's one lonely unisex bathroom, which nicely enough doesn't have a code lock for it!

Then the some of the old staff left. One new staff was a rude teenage girl, long black hair in a pony tail, skinny face, skinny butt, about 18-19 years old.  I also notice every time she is the cashier the line is backed up. \n\nFirst she gives a customer the wrong change, $0.10 instead of $10.10 change. She says sorry to him. It's my turn, I walk up and order. She charges me for 2 drinks when I order one. I argue about the price being wrong since I order the same everyday and this was double the cost. She looks at me with a dumb stoned look on her face and says it's the correct charge. I show her the mistake on the receipt. \n\nBy now the line behind me is backed up around the room to the restroom. With the same dumb stoned look on her face(I swear I just wanted to slap her), still doesn't say sorry. Gets her manager to fix it and then still no apology. \n\nI'm paying with my hard earned cash and what do I get? I get a totally rude and unprofessional experience for my money that's what.

My friends and I ordered them last Sunday and our first clue should have been that the \"barista\" looked at us like we were on drugs. Anyway, we all ordered tall drinks, however, when they come out she's given us two talls and 1 grande. Fine, whatever. But as we were walking down Powell sipping on our drinks, we realized they tasted weird. They weren't blended properly so, we could totally taste the powder used to make the drink. On top of that, we could see through the transparent cups that all the powder was practically on the bottom of our cups!
