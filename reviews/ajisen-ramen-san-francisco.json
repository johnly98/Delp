I love ramen, and my fiancee thought I would enjoy this place. The broth was hot and quite flavorful...very tasty, as was the pork. The noodles, however, tasted as if they weren't fully cooked yet, almost too \"starchy,\" if you will. The biggest disappointment, however, was the egg. I love eggs in ramen, but this was served to me hard boiled. Eggs should not be cooked to the point of a Passover seder level of \"hardness\" when put into ramen.\n\nThe second was the deep fried mochi. She enjoyed it, and I don't know how. I suppose my tastebuds haven't attenuated to Japanese appetizer tastes, as this was literally unseasoned deep fried rice flour. What's the point?\n\nI feel bad to give this place a 2, but I think if anything, a 3-, and probably won't recommend", "author": "Dan W."}

You'll see that I've had place in SoCal, Las Vegas, and other place in the Bay Area. I have even learned how to make ramen myself. I am a ramen snob. This place is a place I would recommend if you're in the area. After doing some shopping, this would be a great place to stop by. I ordered the ramen combo and the Ajisen Ramen. Both were fantastic. The broth was cooked perfectly as well as the chashu. This is one of the first place that I've had that served piece of ribs in the ramen, this add some good flavors to the ramen. The negative thing about the dish is the Ajisen Ramen only came with the seasoned egg but it only came with half the egg. Where is my whole egg?!!!

I didn't stop in Ajisen then, but I told myself I'd have to try it on a return trip.\n\nIt's in the middle of the Westfield Mall, but you have to wait to be seated and there is waiter service. The service was great my entire experience - all of the employees are very kind and they serve you quick.\n\nI ended up going with the Spicy Miso Ramen, which is usually my go-to at any ramen joint. The menu has a TON of ramen options, but they also have other dishes as well as some sushi rolls. There's definitely a nice variety. They also have boba, Thai iced tea, Viet iced coffee, and more yummy drink options.\n\nI read the Spicy Miso Ramen was a pork based broth - it was my first time having ramen where the broth was pretty much WHITE (before I mixed everything up and got the spicy paste integrated) but it smelled yummy! It also comes with an egg, as well as three slices of pork belly.\n\nThe pork belly was delicious - tender, great cuts of meat, and lots of flavor. I also like that they are big slices, but not so big that it's hard to maintain eating. The egg was actually really good too - I've always avoided eating the egg in my ramen and now I'm not sure what I was thinking all those times. The noodles were thinner then what I've had at other ramen places, but they had a good flavor. I wish that I got more noodles with the amount of broth I got... I'm an extra broth girl for sure, but I wouldn't have minded more noodles this time around! \n\nThe broth is where the meal kind of fell short for me, and the broth is really what it comes down to. Aside from being nice and spicy (it'll make your nose run a little) it really wasn't all that flavorful. It definitely left me wanting to there to be more to it. \n\nIf you're craving ramen and this is the only option, it's a decent choice.

It took about 15-20 minutes to get seated for our group of six.\n\nThe three of us got the spicy pork ramen, which was ok.  The broth wasn't as flavorful as I remembered from my first experience.  The noodles actually felt more like thin spaghetti noodles instead of ramen noodles so they didn't absorb any of the broth.\n\nMy niece got the seafood ramen, but I didn't get a picture of it.\n\nI got an order of the fried chicken appetizer for my daughter and my little niece to share, but my niece doesn't really eat meat so she ended up eating just an order of edamame.  The fried chicken was actually pretty good.\n\nService was slow on both occasions so I'm not sure if it's because they're unstaffed or the waitstaffs are just slow.  \n\nThere were four girls working out front and the place isn't that big so I'm not sure why it still felt like everything was moving so slowly.", "author": "Sivilay T."}

Whether it'd be in LA, Hong Kong, ShangHai, or SF, you've never failed to impress me. \n\nVery fairly priced (ramen in SF is generally ~$15 a bowl), perfectly cooked noodles (not hard or too soft), flavorful broth, generous meat & other toppings - Ajisen is a hidden gem. Not to mention the convenient location. Ajisen is always poppin' (always a line out the door) and there is no reason for it not to be popular. \n\nIn my opinion, Ajisen is so much better than many \"we have the best ramen\" places in SF. The consistency and variety of selection (for meat and veggie lovers) at Ajisen is the reason you should go.  If you don't want ramen, you can also get a rice bowl (unagi is bomb.com).There is something for everyone. \n\nFor those of you who complained that the experience is \"too fast\"  - guys, have any of you been to Japan?

It just goes so well in ramen, dontcha think? I have been careful with the spicy pork ramen because it's like Russian roulette, 1 in 6 will kill you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-15", "description": "Unassuming but surprisingly good ramen from inside Westfield Center!! Ajisen seems to be an international chain but they offer more a more diverse ramen menu than what you typically see in the U.S. Yes, there is the tonkatsu, shoyu and miso you see at other places. But they also offer seafood+pork based broths made with shrimp, curry broths, and various spicy broths. Also the ramen is cheap! Unfortunately I've gotten used to paying $13-$15 for ramen at other places in the Bay... but Ajisen ranges from $9-$12.\n\nI came here with my cousins visiting out of town and really only got to try the Grilled Hokkaido Scallop Ramen - THIS IS REALLY GOOD. I've never had a ramen made with a shrimp+pork broth, but it was really flavorful and savory. The grilled scallops were tasty and the noodles had a good bite to them!  I'm not sure if they make their noodles fresh, but to be honest fresh made noodles are a little overrated. ;)\n\nIt was a really well balanced ramen that kept me going that I was able to finish the noodles + the broth. Usually ramen, particularly tonkatsu, can feel rich and heavy in such a way that you get tired of the flavor. I usually have a lot of leftover broth.  In this case, the Hokkaiso Scallop Ramen was addicting to eat! \n\nWe also tried their fried chicken (karaage) which is pretty good. Not too oily and the chicken is moist and flavorful. The breading is a little thick but crispy - it reminded me more of nanban chicken than chicken karaage. Still a good appetizer served with Japanese mayo for dipping.\n\nWhat a surprise to find a sit down ramen place inside the Westfield Mall! Totally reminds me of ramen places in Japan where they're in food courts or open entry way like a garage. It's next to Panda Express on the bottom floor and has its own designated seating area where you put your name down on the list to be seated. We went around 8 pm on a Saturday and the wait was only like 10 minutes for a table, but I imagine this place can get popular.\n\nSo if you're looking for a quick ramen fix near Union Square after shopping, I'd recommend Ajisen for the convenience. It's good ramen, definitely not the best in SF but it's good and cheap. Also you don't have to wait outside in the cold for a seat... unlike some places in the city.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

You have to either ask for the powder or get it yourself near the side of the restaurant.", "author": "Jamie N."}

I don't like malls but I was at the Westfield SFO because I wanted to go to Zara, currently PDX doesn't have one, but they are building one, and I had just flown in, and was hungry, and LOVE ramen.  So, I stumbled upon Ajisen and was really pleasantly surprised. First off, and please don't take this the wrong way, but when I see a lot of people of the same culture and ethnicity eating at a place that is serving that type of food, I always assume it's traditional and good.  And this place was - i had the tofu ramen which was lovely, although I could use a bit more broth but that's me and the pork gyoza.  Both were steaming hot and delicious.  Not to mention the tea - i don't know what type it was and wish I had asked - smelled like gardenia although didn't taste like gardenia.  It was so lovely and just made me feel so calm and centered.  All in all, i really enjoyed Ajisen.  And the staff was very attentive and sweet.  I felt sorry for my waiter because of group of unruly, ill behaved and I'll say privileged American teenagers came in as I was eating and were not being respectful to those dining around them or the the waiter.  He took it all in stride and never stopped smiling.  I even said something to him because their behavior was really atrocious, and he smiled and said \"they will learn\".  I was really impressed by that and all in all a nice mall lunch experience.", "author": "Lauren A P."}

Shopping gets pretty intense so I'm always excited to check out the many food options this food court has to offer. After spending some time looking at menus, I settled on this place. For some reason, ramen was what my taste buds were craving. \n\nWhen you approach the stand you write your name on the clipboard and then a server will call you when your table is ready. Fortunately, it seemed like either the staff was super efficient or it wasn't as busy because the minute I wrote my name, I was sat. Lots of tables in the place and at first, lots of people but as my time there continued, I ended being one of two tables. The staff was cool; nothing out of the ordinary. They were prompt, partly due to not having a ton of tables so that was appreciated. \n\nFor my meal, I got the Shoyu Ramen for $9.75. Soaked in shoyu broth, you have the ramen noodles, bamboo shoots, fish cake, nori, soy soaked egg, chashu and green onions. The shoyu broth fell a little flat for me and the noodles were borderline hard. My dish came extremely fast so that might have been the problem. The egg was a big let down; I appreciate more of a soft boiled egg as opposed to the overcooked half I received. I didn't know what to expect in a mall food court however Westfield is known for great dining options. Unfortunately this dish didn't live up in my opinion. \n\nIt's not that I wouldn't return to this place however with many other options in the mall, it's hard to say that I would prioritize my next visit here. Maybe next time, I'll get a few dishes to compare the experience.", "author": "Rockne H."}

I've been to Ajisen location in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Shanghai, and Singapore, and the experience has been universally positive.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered the Ajisen Best Combo Ramen, which is a solid standby composed of various kinds of pork. I strongly recommend that you try the Tontoro Ramen, which also features a big slab of pork, however, its pork belly has a sweet glaze that uniquely compliments the more salty and savory broth. I also ordered the seaweed salad, which was conventional but quite tasty, and I also got an iced Honey Citron, which is a Korean analogue of half-and-half or sweet tea, but with more of a sweet orange flavor.

Japanese ramen places usually give you like less than three bites of protein and charge you $15. I guess this is okay for women or petite feminine men but not for real men who need a normal amount of food. I can understand that this is normal in Japan since their live stock is limited over there. However in the US meat is plentiful yet Japanese places still give you as less protein as possible. \n\nAjisen gives you, I would guess, 8 times more protein than a typical Japanese ramen place. They are also really quick with getting your food out. I think the ramen taste pretty good too.", "author": "Scott T."}

Came here very hungry on a Tuesday afternoon after strolling around the centre and let's just say I was stupefied! I am a skeptic of the quality of mall food court ramen but this idea was debunked by Ajisen Ramen, hooray!\n\nFood: Ordered the Spicy Pork Ramen to share with my boyfriend along with the Fried Tofu. Super affordable, with most bowls ranging from $8-$12 a bowl. The quantities given were pretty big, and my boyfriend and I left with our tummies happily filled (he was not as hungry as me but if he was we probably would've ordered 2 bowls). The ramen had a good amount of heat in it, just enough to make it enjoyable but not to the point where your nose is dripping or anything. Broth is good, but I liked the pork in whole pieces instead of ground up (less appealing to eat). I was happy that there was an egg in the ramen, but it was boiled to the point where the yolk was dry and unappealing to eat (Orenchi's half boiled eggs are my favorite). The fried tofu was pretty average, I didn't really like the breading as it was pretty dry, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Decently sized (2) pieces were given to us.\n\nAmbience: Felt a little weird that it felt like a restaurant but also like a to-go place. The wait was nothing on a weekday afternoon, and the food came out in 5 minutes (I timed it!) Servers were nice, although I felt like they were a little frantic because it was somewhat busy. \n\nOverall I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area and hungry for a quick bite. I was originally gonna go towards Chipotle which is is next door but I thought I'd give this place a-go, try it yourself too!", "author": "Bonnie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-28", "description": "This seemed like one of the cooler food court offerings at the Westfield. Interestingly enough, there was a waitlist, and your server brings you the food, like at a typical sit-down restaurant. I can't think of any other Westfield eatery that has that sit-down service. \n\nFrom the outside, you can't really see the menu board, and they had no menus out in front for you to look at. You just have to take a chance, not knowing specifically what their menu items were. I put my name on the waitlist, and there were about 3 parties ahead of me. The wait didn't seem all that long, since a few people left while we were waiting. \n\nService was very mediocre, at least towards us. The servers seemed robotic and uninterested. It seemed the tall, pretty guy server and the tall, pretty girl at the counter were both shallow plastic-surgery types. I don't think they'd care for customers unless they fit their same aspirational vibe. I didn't dare ask any questions about the menu items because this seemed to be the type of place where they know even less about the food than you do. So I just took a leap and ordered what looked interesting, and what I felt like eating at that moment - pork and corn ramen. \n\nI've definitely had better Japanese ramen. The salty broth was fairly good, but still seemed a bit off. The portions looked very big, but I was able to finish it all, and it was a good portion for dinner. My bowl had pieces of pork and veggies. The pork was pretty good, though not spectacular, and the hard boiled egg and veggies were ok. I thought my drink was supposed to have boba, but there was no boba in there. I asked the waiter about it, and he just mumbled something in a rude, uncaring way. The waiters seem very confused and lacking in diligence and intelligence. It made sense, because the guy was very pretty, and so was the tall girl behind the counter. \n\nAfter we put cash in the black guest check holder, the pretty waiter didn't come for a long time. I think we were so off his radar, he just didn't care and totally forgot. I saw him just sitting at a seat nearby, playing with his iPhone X or whatever, probably texting a girlfriend. Finally, I flagged down another employee, who didn't seem very happy to interact with me. She brought the guest book to the counter. Then we waited a long time, and nothing happened. Weren't they supposed to bring the guest book back so we can take the receipt? We had put in cash, including tip, and we had written that on the receipt. Finally, we asked that same employee, and she took a look again and consulted with the pretty girl at the counter, who gave us a less-than-pleasant look. The employee came back and said something like we paid in cash, and left a tip already, so there was nothing more to do. She asked if we wanted the receipt, and we said yes. Geez. Talk about really clueless, inattentive service. \n\nAnd this is the part that made me give this 1 star, instead of the 2 stars I'd otherwise give it: Shortly after I ate the noodles, I had an upset stomach. It became really bad later in the night - I had pretty severe stomach pains. I had to take Pepto Bismol-type medication. There was something really bad, expired, or unclean in the noodles I had. I am definitely never going back there again, and I'm telling everyone I know about that, too. \n\nAmbiance: 2/5\nService: 1.5/5\nFood (taste): 3/5\nFood (quality/safety/cleaniness): negative stars - severe upset stomach, needed to take meds", "author": "S F."}

The main thing it has going for it is the location - what else sounds better than a hot bowl of noodle soup after a morning of winter shopping? Anyways, this place doesn't seem to slow down much even after the lunch hour, which means that although you might be seated quickly, you're in for a wait on all other fronts. \n\nThe tables are squished together for maximum people:space ratio. Don't feel bad about accidentally eavesdropping because others are probably doing the same to you! The huge menu is not nearly as daunting when you realize that at least 75% of the pages are dedicated to helpful pictures. \n\nWe started off with the Fried Tofu appetizer, which came out piping hot. Crisp on the outside, with a dishful of ginger shavings. Would order again... except that each cube cost over $1. I went with the Corn & BBQ Pork Ramen, while Jiwon M. got the Pork Rib Ramen. The first thing that stood out was how tender and fatty the meat was - a thumbs up for the protein! The broth was underwhelming, savory but not quite the pork or miso taste I was expecting (although the Pork Rib broth was better). I also wished they replaced the cabbage in the soup with seaweed or something with more umami flavor. On the plus side though, the soup wasn't too salty. The noodles were thicker and softer than I'm used to, but not bad, and I was grateful for the mini ladle (because a spoon is not adequate) provided. \n\nPortion sizes are good, but $10+ is still a lot to pay for average ramen. It took forever to finish paying for our meal, but the waitresses remained polite in spite of the busy-ness.

Maybe you can pay for more but if they're going to charge you for the amount they do, average $8-9, they better be giving you enough noodles.

I wanted the ramen, and asked to substitute soba noodles so there wouldn't be egg in it; the waiter told me no without even asking the chef. So, I settled on Soba and fried Mochi. It came with dashi (fish dipping sauce) despite being \"vegetarian,\" so I made my own using soy sauce, water, and wasabi. The soba was decent, but the mochi had a deep and distinct flavor of fish - as if they not only cook it all in the same oil, but they don't change the oil often enough. It was a cold day, and at the end I asked for sobayu (the hot soba cooking water you're supposed to mix with the dipping sauce and drink at the end) and the waiter said \"no, we don't have that,\" which is super weird because they cook soba there.

I've ate at plenty of other ramen places but I still reminisce about this place. I actually had to take my mom here, 1 1/2 hr drive but totally worth it! (she agrees) \n\nWe came in at 11am (before lunch time) and it wasn't packed at all! Loved it. We ordered an order of the calimari appetizer and OMG! It was a big hit! The fried calimari isn't like any other calimari. It was actual squid legs. They were huge and had a nice crunch to it! Love love love! My new favorite from this place. You MUST try it!\n\nFor ramen, I almost always order the spicy beef (because every other ramen has pork and I'm not a big fan of pork). It's not at all spicy and the beef is just...amazing! They're cut into perfect little cubes and the texture is super soft. You bite into it and it'll just break apart. The broth is suuuuper delish and not at all too creamy. \n\nOverall, I brag about this place to everyone saying it's the best ramen place ever because to my tastebuds, they think it is.

It wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.\n\nThe menu has pictures of the food next to the name, which calls for some bias, as I tend to eat with my eyes while hungry. Not surprisingly, I settled for the Ajisen Best Combo (ABC) ramen, which is the first item in the menu. With the variety of protein -- thin premium pork, chasu, and pork rib meat -- the ABC ramen is a good option if you want different cuts and flavor. To me, the premium pork was good, but the chasu and rib meat were just okay. The tonkotsu broth was creamy, but not rich enough. And although there were kikurage mushrooms, green onions, and green cabbage in that ramen, I still felt like some key ingredients were lacking, such as dried seaweed, bamboo shoots, and a soft-boiled egg.\n\nOverall, Ajisen Ramen would satisfy my ramen cravings if I'm at Union Square and not wanting to endure the wait at Katana-Ya.

Food knows it has done a good job if it can make the consumers sleepy afterwards.\n\nI've tried the following:\n\n- Spicy Pork Miso: not that spicy but it has a creamy broth and generous amounts of pork, noodles, and veggies. Corn is my addiction in ramen and they give a nice amount to me loves it long time.\n\n- Shoyu ramen: a more simpler ramen with a less creamy soup. Not my most favorite however because it was a bit too bland for me, and the noodles were kinda tough.\n\n- Ajisen ramen: one of the cheaper ramen noodles here (like $7.50) and probably one of my favorites. The creamy buttery soup really goes well with the pork slices. And corn corn corn corn. I laaaahve corn. And buttery soup. And soft noodles.

Love that all of these ramen places are popping up in the Bay Area!  The rich savory broth, tasty pork slices and ramen noodles make it such a delicious all in one meal.  I usually get the Ajisen Best Combo which is not particularly spicy, but you can add some hot sauce or shichimi.  I've also ordered the Spicy Ramen in the past, and that was quite spicy. A bowl of their ramen is big enough to satisfy a hearty appetite. I don't even have room for water after eating!  It's so filling! \n\nSometimes, if we're really famished, we'll order an appetizer before our ramen. We've had their Karaage and Gyoza.  Both come out piping hot. The Karaage is not too heavily breaded and it comes with aioli. The Gyoza is tasty. \n\nService is attentive. They're always ready to refill your water. If there is a wait, it's usually not bad. A table will soon be available, so don't go too far once you've put your name on the list. The price is good too. Where in SF can you eat under $12 a person in a full service sit down restaurant? This place may be in a mall, and may not be as good as Orenchi, but I am so happy to be able to eat ramen when I'm craving it and do some shopping as well.", "author": "Hazel C."}

In a city like San Francisco, I did the unthinkable. I ate a meal in a mall food court. Why? Well, location, hunger, time constraints and Yelp reviews. That's why. And surprisingly, my mall ramen experience here was not nearly as bad as most mall dining experiences. In fact, it was actually A-OK. For what it was, at least. \n\nMany ramen joints in The City don't open until dinner time. Why? I don't know. I like ramen for lunch sometimes. Because soup for breakfast, soup for lunch, soup for dinner. Soup all the time. That's why. Anyway, Ajisen is open for lunch, and it's convenient. And the soup? Really not all that bad. Definitely not vying for a top ramen spot, but operating at a much higher level than the vast majority of mall food. \n\nI tried the tantanmen, a current obsession of mine. The broth here is very heavy-handed - mostly just peanut with a bit of other depth to it. Nothing like the tantanmen I've had anywhere else. But the noodles here were decent, and the size for the price is generous. A sampling of my dining companion's pork ramen confirmed a similar heavy hand with the broth there too. \n\nOur gyoza and fried mochi appetizers were passable. The thai tea is overly sweet - but will appeal to a mall audience. \n\nWith all the amazing food offerings in this city, I can't see myself returning. But if I worked nearby, this could be a stop every couple of months, for convenience sake. Yes, it's in a mall, but it's way better than most mall food.", "author": "Don B."}

After work today I came here for a quick dinner after I was done shopping at Champs Sports. I thought chicken ramen soup would help, but I was distracted by the fried chicken ramen soup. Common sense would suggest that fried chicken wouldn't help my cough. I forego common sense - I decided to order the fried chicken ramen soup. I also ordered another dish the baked eel. \n\nSeveral minutes my ramen arrived but not my fried chicken. The waitress said the fried chicken will come later. When I go out to eat I don't care about service too much as long as the food is good. However since the name of the dish is fried chicken ramen soup I expected the fried chicken to arrive at the same time. Imagine if you ordered a bbq pork fried rice the fried rice came but not the bbq pork. Or if you ordered broccoli beef the broccoli came but not the beef. That's how I felt with the fried chicken ramen soup. I didn't want to eat the ramen until the fried chicken was served. About five minutes later the fried chicken arrived. Luckily the broth of the ramen remained hot.\n\nThe fried chicken is chicken karaage, which is a Japanese version of fried chicken. The chicken karaage was moist in the inside, but not crispy enough on the outside. The broth was tasty and the noodles were tender. The dish overall was ok. The baked eel however was much better than the fried chicken ramen soup. The eels I've had in the past were either too many boney or too oily. The baked eel was neither the case. The meat was tender yet not too oily. The skin had a slight crispiness. \n\nThis is a decent place to have a quick dinner. Overall did the fried chicken ramen soup help get rid of my cough? No. What can you say I'm a sucker for anything that is fried chicken.", "author": "Gerald R."}

My favorite was always its pork rib ramen.  I loved its tender meat, the crunchy cartilage, and most the robust and flavorful seasoning.  The rich and complex seasoning made the pork ribs really, really enjoyable.  I loved it in any Ajisen Ramen outlet in Hong Kong as they all shared the same wonderful flavor.  I would rate it 5* if there were Yelp in Hong Kong.\n\nWhen I found Ajisen Ramen in San Francisco six years ago, I was delighted and readily patronized it.  Even though the meat and cartilage were familiar, I was disappointed that I did not find the same rich flavor.  I would eat it with some misgiving, trying to replenish the missing flavor with my fond memories from Hong Kong.  I rated it 3*, fair and edible.\n\nToday, I ate pork rib ramen again.  I was really disappointed with the bland flavor and lackluster seasoning.  There were three pieces of big meat, and I ate them as they were tender and crunchy as they should be.  But I did not enjoy the flavorless meal.  Reluctantly, I have to rate it 2* as a poor meal.\n\nI heard the owners of this San Francisco Ajisen Ramen is the same owner of the Hong Kong Ajisen.  If so, I wonder how can they allow the same food in SF to be 2* while their restaurants in Hong Kong can cook it into 5* fare.  Something terrible happened in their QA.  The owners should come to SF and eat their pork rib ramen and see for themselves.  Then maybe they would dispatch their HK chef to SF to teach the proper way to cook pork rib ramen.", "author": "Robert W."}

The noodles were the best part of the meal. Not your typical ramen noodles, but these were firm yet chewy. The broth was really bland in my opinion. I love their garnishes especially the wood ear fungus; however, I thought it was a bit strange that they put cabbage in the ramen. I recommend getting the cabbage on the side so you can choose how much you want to add into the noodles.\n\nOverall, the prices are very reasonable here. I was pretty surprised that they had such an extensive drink menu with boba! This is a place that I'm glad I tried, but will never come back again.", "author": "Joy L."}

If anything, it's a reason to brave the mall crowds. For a mere $9.25, you get a giant bowl of ramen with pork dashi, veggies, and a huge tonkatsu (pork cutlet breaded in panko and fried). You can hear them pounding/tenderizing it in the back so you know it's fresh. If you must get the vegetarian broth, it's mediocre, so if you are open to opting for the pork-based broth, go for this. Just know it's a bit on a spicy side, but the best broth I've had so far in the Bay. Also, don't make a trip there without getting the tempura mochi with ginger dipping sauce. Staff are super friendly, and they try their very hardest to seat you quickly in the small and compact space. So worth the wait, so just suck it up and do it. To sum it up, super cheap yet high quality food with amazing and quick service.", "author": "Alison A."}

I got the Ajisen best combo (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lWY2VcLq9QU_zeeBSVJ4XQ&userid=qEdxnnadZ2tcU9JOXjnGdw) which is actually a good deal because it includes three different kinds of pork (if I'm not mistaken).  However, mine was really salty, so I'm not sure if there was MSG in it or just too much flavoring.  When you've ran 13.1 miles though, you really don't care for the world and the idea of eating cardboard sounds totally acceptable.

Serving up consistent bowls of flavorful, albeit food court chain worthy ramen, it serves the greater noodle soup craving community and is a vastly superior option than its food court neighbors. Granted it is high on the Ajisen scale, it is still behind the best ramen available in the Bay. And as a result, it's deemed 3 star worthy at best.\n\nLike most Asian businesses in San Francisco, it appears to be Chino-run. Subtle attempts at Japanese may get puzzled looks from the staff, but Cantonese seems to be A-OK. They get slammed during lunch time and as a result, a nice line will often build up and the wait for tables is even more gruesome. That said, the place is clean and can surprisingly fit a decent amount of people.\n\nRamen lovers may find solace in the premium pork ramen, a nearly $10 bowl served with nice cuts of pork and a milky but flavorful broth. Topped with chives and a nice abundance of noodles, it might just be their best ramen dish. I've found the shoyu ramen ($9) to be a tad too salty at times, but still surprisingly decent enough to be a slurp worthy time. And of course, the classic Ajisen ramen ($9) is presented quite well here, best enjoyed with an extra side of corn ($1), a hard boiled egg, and perhaps some extra cuts of charsiu pork ($3).\n\nNot feeling noodles in broth? Shoot for some appetizers and their small but tasty selections of rice dishes. They seem faster out of the kitchen anyway and the perfect solution for folks in a hurry. Agadeshi tofu ($1.50)? Solid. Chicken karagae aka Japanese fried chicken ($6)? A-OK. Premium pork rice platter? A bit pricey at $9 for a clump of rice and a few cuts of pork. Potato croquettes ($4) aren't exactly filling, they're just perfect as an appetizer.\n\nBeware of the gyoza ($6), teriyaki enoki beef rolls ($5) and any of their sushi rolls ($7-14).

Definitely not the big huge bowls you would probably expect at a Pho restaurant.\n\nTo start, you have to write your name down on the clipboard hanging on their sign out front. We were here on a Friday around 1:30. They were pretty busy, but this place is inside the Westfield Shopping Center and it's just busy here all the time! So our wait time was about 10-15 min. 3 tables were pushed together to accommodate the 6 of us. The server immediately brought us waters & gave us a chance to look at the menus.\n\nI didn't have any ramen, but I did try their Tofu Salad. According to the picture there was corn in their salad, so I requested my salad without corn. The portion size was very generous. Probably enough for two. They use silk tofu on the salad and give you 2 portions cut from the tofu block. I think this is about 6-8oz. of tofu. A really good serving. The salad was good! The dressing was light, flavorful & the salad wasn't drenched in it so the greens were nice & crunchy! At the end $7.50 was very reasonable for this salad & the amount you get, plus the nice flavor of their dressing.\n\nTofu Salad: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajisen-ramen-san-francisco#RjwBk4TkfNZMiZbp0GvkUg", "author": "Joel R."}

I came anyway because I was on my way to another ramen spot but the rain made me change directions. \n\nI came here around 11:45 for lunch, there were some empty tables. Right after I was seated though, there was a crowded on the waitlist to be seated. \n\nI ordered the volcano despite the reviews. It's the only thing on the menu with 3 red peppers next to it... it SHOULD be spicy right? \n\nTook awhile to get my food. I ordered the volcano and \"fried chicken\". \"Fried chicken\" made me laugh, what ramen place calls their chicken \"fried chicken\"? Thinking about it, I guess it makes sense, it's in a food court and not every who rolls through knows what chicken karaage is.\n\nMy ramen came with a ladle, which made me giggle. I don't think I've ever seen a place serving ramen with ladles. It's peculiar... no? You know what, the volcano was spicy. I was surprised. For someone who eats pretty spicy foods, this tasted spicy. It's not a crazy spice but it's not bland. The pork slices were pretty good, not too fatty either. The egg... sigh. It's a seasoned hard boiled egg, but it looked like a miniature egg size, either someone chomped on my egg or it just was mildly deformed. I do love soft boiled eggs in my ramen... \n\nOh, and the noodles. Like all the other descriptions of spaghetti noodles. Totally on point. It was a little weird, but I've gone to other ramen places that use that kind of noodle too. Odd but not a deal breaker. It's a food court! What do you really expect? \n\nThe \"fried chicken\" was pretty good. For the $5, it was a good portion for the price. \n\nOverall, I'd come back if I'm in a pinch and want some ramen (while at work).

If you want to order to-go, simply go up to the front cash register and they have a huge menu on the wall that you can order from. If you're dining in, you wait to be seated. \n\nI was debating between the tan tan and the spicy beef ramen. Ended up going with the spicy beef ramen because the waitress said the tan tan was a bit on the heavy peanuty side. Ramen bowls were about $8.  The ramen came out fairly quickly! However our drinks took forever... We see it ready on the counter and it took forever for a waitress to bring it over to our table. Finally it came, after my ramen came out. \n\nThe broth was def very flavorful, a bit on the salty end though. I was so hungry that I didn't care and devoured everything. The beef was tender and they gave you plenty at least 7-8 pieces. The noodles though I noticed were different from regular ramen noodles I tried elsewhere. They almost reminded me of thin spaghetti. I didn't really like that texture of the noodles. \n\nTry the honey aloe green tea! It had chunks of aloe Vera in there. Extremely refreshing!!!

I'm a fan of ramen but not an aficionado so my standards aren't super high but I still know good ramen when I taste it.\nI was promptly seated, the place was full (good sign) and presented with a menu. I really liked the menu; lots of ramen options and clearly this is a place of Japanese descent as most of the menu is written in Japanese. I've since read from other reviews it's a chain in Japan. Good to know. \nI ordered the spicy pork ramen. At only one chili rating on the menu I am really glad I didn't order the volcano broth that had 3 chilies because there is no way I would have been able to handle that heat. The regular spicy was quite spicy but not overly so. \nI thought the broth was very good. Slightly creamy, it had a good texture and flavor profile. The noodles were a little boring but it seems that's what ramen noodles usually are, no? \nNon regular noodle slurpers, beware; slurping noodles from a large spoon can be tricky. To say nothing of getting soup on your shirt, you can swallow incorrectly and nearly choke. Since the broth and the noodles can be a little hard for the back of your mouth to negotiate as you are shoveling a large spoonful in your mouth, a little broth and in my case small bit of meat can go straight down the wrong pipe. The result for me with the spicy pork going down the wrong way was a very unpleasant coughing fit that lasted a good 10 minutes, had fellow slurpers give me some WTF looks (although amusingly the 2 young Asian girls next to me chatting endlessly about things teen girls do couldn't seem to care less that I was nearly choking to death) and had me streaming in tears.

The broth was flavorful but not too salty (like the feeling you get after eating pho, ya know what I mean). There was obvi pork and the noods were extra bouncy in my mouth. \n\nOrder the premium pork bowl because you most likely won't go to a mall to get ramen again and there are other places to get ramen in SF ( according to Yelp LOL) so don't limit yourself to this. They also got small dishes like fried chicken and spicy tuna. But in general, this place ain't so bad.", "author": "Eileen W."}

Although I remember it tasting better in Shanghai, this place does an above decent job for a restaurant chain in the mall. \n\nLocated at the basement of the SF Westfield Mall in downtown SF, it's in a good location for all the Bay Area tourists that Barts into Powell. It's in a clean, rich mall, right off the Powell Bart station. \n\nI ordered the spicy pork ramen which turned out pretty darn tasty. It hit the spot the morning after NYE in the city. The noodles weren't that spicy, it had that spicy flavor and the meat portions were generous, which is something that I don't normally get from the overrated ramen spots in the Silicon Valley. The noodles itself were good, not too soft nor hard. The soup base tasted pretty generic, tasty and flavorful, but it wasn't outstandingly great.  \n\nMy friend had the volcano spicy ramen (the spiciest one) and he is the type that can tolerate ghost peppers. He said it was good spicy, so I'm assuming that it would actually burn for the medium spice eaters. \n\nOne downside are the drinks. I ordered the strawberry iced tea which tasted more like water and flavored strawberry syrup.

Oh yes, there was the unmistakable air of assembly line production about the place the moment you see it. And of course, it was abuzz with customers downing ramen and other predictable dishes, mostly clutches of young, squawky Asians looking for something quick and an excuse to sit down and text. Nothing looked terribly exciting to me, so I went with the $7.50 bowl of Chicken Ramen (see photo). The noodles were decently al dente, but the uniformly separated chicken pieces tasted packaged in the worst way.\n\nJamie had marginally better luck with the same-priced Beef Miso Ramen probably because the meat at least tasted like it was marinated in soy to give it flavor (see photo). I probably should have gone with the pork but the photos make it look like they process the pork into a roll and slice it like Pillsbury cookie dough. I may end up going there again for the convenience, but it would be nice to see a little more effort in the execution.

The menu variety is awesome, more than a dozen types of ramen and a ton of snacks (appetizers) plus a few rice plates. I'd definitely come back to try more items.\n\nAs expected, the place was filled with customers and servers were having difficulty adjusting to the fast pace. The system is not well organized yet, so once seated u could easily be forgotten about. Apparently different staff are assigned separate tasks and since they don't seem to talk to each other... u get the picture. Just be proactive and flag someone when u need something. On the other hand the kitchen was doing a superb job and all orders (after they've received them) I saw were completed in under 10-12 minutes. Takeout orders get a green device that buzzes when the order is ready for pickup.\n\nThe picture menu is a very nice feature, although it only has a general description of the dish and doesn't tell u every ingredient in the bowl. Only a few ramen versions include an egg (hard boiled, I prefer soft boiled eggs). Ajisen specializes in Kumamoto Ramen, similar to Hakata Ramen (same region, Kyushu island), which uses straight noodles.\n\nI'm familiar with Ajisen, so for my first order I knew I wanted to try the premium pork ramen ($8.75) http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/70kpSXbqNSrxe0zVFF2kBA/l and I was not disappointed. If u like Santouka u will like this tonkotsu broth very much. It's topped with thinly sliced pork. All the meats I saw were sliced thin, so if left unattended the meat could dry quickly. In short, the soup was delicious!\n\nSo far the appetizers (\"snacks\") are just okay. The gyoza are tiny. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j6npB1pcSHCPVZAf5-P22w/l\nFor anyone with sesame seed allergies, know that the rice in the California roll is premixed with it.\n\nUPDATE: service has improved a lot after the first week. And found another winner in the tender pork ribs ramen. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0UyA-_QlcdJ6zCI9rL3E0w/l\nSolid 4 stars!\n\nUnlike most other ramen shops they accept take out orders.

If you're looking for delicious and complex Japanese ramen, I wouldn't look at chains, which segues into the next fact...\n\n2) Yes, this place IS a chain. Meaning the focus is more on an easy to follow simple recipe.\n\n3) This place is not Japanese run, obviously.\n\nHowever, this doesn't detract from the fact that Ajisen Ramen produces decent and delicious ramen. The first time I tried this chain was believe it or not, actually in Melbourne. One things that you need to know first is that Melbourne is a LOT more expensive than San Francisco - you'd be hard pressed to find any meal for less than 10 dollars in a restaurant is what I mean. What's considered cheap in Melbourne is considered overpriced in the bay area.\n\nNow... after that's settled, onto the review.\n\nAtmosphere:\nConsidering how it has its own little section in Westfield, it is pretty cramped. I don't particularly mind, but it is something to consider if you're coming with a large group or just don't like sitting super close near others.\n\nCustomer Service:\nI see some reviews complaining about the fact that the service is not Japanese, but I don't think this really matters. The customer service is really friendly, welcoming, and attentive - THAT'S what matters.\n\nFood:\nI ordered the tender pork spare ribs ramen, also known as paiku ramen. I was a bit disappointed to see that the prices were.... exactly the same prices as Melbourne. And remember what I said? That means that it's pretty overpriced. However, the pork was still very tasty, tender, and the soup yummy. I added a bit of red pepper for an extra kick and loved it. The downside is that the additions to the ramen were a bit disappointing - basic cabbage, not even an egg! Ajisen Ramen in Melbourne was more complex than this - I expect more out of a branch in San Francisco (the food capital itself!)\n\n---\n\nOverall, I can't fault Ajisen Ramen. Don't come here expecting much, but they do deliver consistently delicious ramen. If you're willing to spend 10 dollars for excellent service and 3-stars ramen, have a visit. If you're looking for something more authentic, skip the trip.", "author": "Clarissa Y."}

From Hong Kong to Singapore to Bangkok to NYC and now SF, each has had varying standards and slightly differing menu items but sadly none have offered the cold beef brisket with mustard dipping sauce from the Hong Kong stores. \n\nThat dish would have been a wonderful treat because I was unfortunately really underwhelmed by my ramen here. Despite ordering the premium pork ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=5Krro9IQUfl1HLjTnTMvag), I found the broth to be lacking in rich fatty pork flavor. The ramen noodles were flat and didn't have a good consistency or spring in your mouth. We also had the seaweed salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=scqMp02rI56nFZzR1nsASA) but it was pretty pedestrian too. Not bad, but it's probably what you can buy from the supermarket too.\n\nA special shout-out here to the manager though who took his time to explain the difference between the premium pork and pork rib ramen. I was torn between the two but went with his recommendation. He nicely sent out a piece of pork rib as a side for me to try when my ramen arrived. That's pretty sweet customer service. \n\nFor a quick ramen fix, Ajisen will do in a bind. But to truly savor ramen, you might need to explore a lil further beyond the mall.", "author": "Jon L."}

It's a famous chain internationally, so there's a minimum level of satisfaction there. \n\nAverages out to be $9 per ramen. You have your basics: shoyu, miso, house. Then you have the spicy options with spicy beef, spicy pork, curry beef. On top of that, you have the premium meat. Their soup base is very thick, lots of MSG/sodium/salt/name-it-however-you'd-like. But ramen without soup is like... walking the dirty streets of downtown without shoes. No matter how much you don't want that sodium intake, do drink the soup while you eat your noodles. My favorite is the spicy pork, 1) I love spicy food, 2) you get your serving of veggies, 3) you get the sliced pork and the minced pork, 4) hi half an egg. It's guaranteed to be filling. Generally Japanese places, especially around Union Square, don't serve ramen on their a la carte menu. So if you're craving for some non-instant ramen, there's an okay spot right inside Westfield.\n\nTheir noodles aren't too consistent though, nor their service. I feel like their noodles are a bit too undercooked, creating this overly chewy texture. Their service can be bad especially near dinner hours. It took a while to get our check. But there were times where there was barely any wait time other than for the food to cook. \n\nDo try their appetizers. Fried calamari is great to share, don't wait til it's cold, the calamari gets very chewy that way. It's not overly floured, so you get a bit of the batter taste but it's not like a tempura where the calamari may be drenched in the batter. Their beef enoki is pretty good, but not worth the price for two pieces. Make it yourself at home. Agedashi tofu is not bad either, but it's more worthwhile at a regular Japanese restaurant.", "author": "Connie C."}

I literally have to go on a 4 hour roundtrip to New York City every time I want to try ramen, so I lost it when I saw people slurping ramen in the food court.\n\nI sat down and ordered the Classic Ajisen ramen and the honey green aloe tea. On my second visit I was also able to try the Dan Dan Mien and their version of Poki (forgot what it was called on the menu). I wasn't sure what I was going to expect, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. The bowls are in the $8-$11 range, and they do not skimp on quantity. The Classic Ajisen broth was rich and salty, and although the noodles weren't as chewy and firm as they are at other places, their soft texture made them super easy to slurp. I didn't like the Dan Dan Mien as much, but man, at $7.95, I think I'm kind of in love with the Classic Ajisen. The sides were also surprisingly delicious.\n\nService was good, and the food comes out fast. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. My biggest complaint are the toppings on the ramen. The pseudo-cha siu was floppy and flavorless, and the half egg in the ramen was hardboiled (it should be soft-boiled for maximum ramen happiness!).

The noodles here always have the right amount of bounce and chewiness to them and the broth is flavorful.\n\nTheir other dishes that I've tried are just mediocre (nothing special about them). The Pork Cutlet Curry is standard fare and the Premium Pork Plate is decent enough. However, both make for pretty boring meals (just pork and rice). The milk tea at Ajisen is fairly strong, I could definitely feel the caffeine after drinking it.

We waited around 10 minutes before being seated. The menu has a lot of variety. I ended up choosing the Volcano Ramen because I saw that they rated it \"3\" chilies. I like spicy food so I thought I would try that out. My friend got an order of gyoza and he ordered their pork ramen. I don't usually eat ramen unless it is in factory packaging with flavored powder, but overall, eating ramen in a bowl was good. The volcano wasn't very volcano, but more saltier than I imagined. The noodles weren't as cooked as I would have liked either, just a few more minutes and they would have been cooked perfectly. My ramen came with a clump of chilies in oil and if that is how they constitute \"volcano,' then I am so confused. The chilies didn't really do much for me but make the soup oilier. I would probably choose the pork ramen, as my friend recommended to me, the next time I come eat ramen here again. The food came out in a good fashion and the servers were very good with customer service. ~$10 per bowl of ramen is okay, but I still would like to see more.

There are limited Japanese condiments available, which is kind of crucial when you're eating ramen.  The noodles were very pasta-like as opposed to noodles, but were good.  Not the best ramen I've had, but it was still very good.\n\nMy husband got the spicy pork ramen, which was also pretty good, but again, was missing that little pow that it needed to avoid being just heavy/spicy.

I always wanted to try Ajisen and since I am definitely not that comfortable (yet) eating out alone, I didn't want to skip this chance.\nWe got seated pretty quickly next to a man--who was eating alone and it was totally fine--until he started making some inconsiderate remarks. And we'll get to that in a bit.\nAfter reviewing the entire menu, I noticed they have quite a few different ramens and rice plates and even drinks. I ordered a spicy pork ramen and bf ordered the combo.\nAfter our server leaves, our lone neighbor turns and asks us if he was holding his chopsticks right. Clearly he knew how to hold them, but we politely told him yes. Then he proceeds to ask us if this was exactly how they made it in China. First of all, Ajisen is Japanese ramen. Second, I've only been to Hong Kong about three years ago and I didn't eat any ramen there. How assumptious and ignorant of him, that because I look Asian = I must be from China. Anyway, I'll refrain from posting his picture on the internet.. today.\nBack to the important stuff; the soup was pretty salty, but the taste was okay. They added a small scoop of \"spicy pork\" which is only spicy minced pork which was one of the weirdest things I've tasted. I didn't want to eat the meat, but I wanted the spice it came with so I just mixed it all into the soup and forgot about it. The ramen was different from what most other places serve. Ajisen's were basically Angel Hair. I did not like it at all.. I like the texture of real ramen and angel hair was smooth and round. It wasn't doing it for me.\n\nSo all in all, this place is A-ok if I haaad to eat at the mall.. But definitely not something to go out of the way for.

I thought that was cute. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=RQfjQzHAI0VUZ239ZmOTwg\n\nSERVICE:\nContrary to complaints of slow and lackadaisical service posted by others, the service was efficient, quick and friendly. There's a lit up menu board but you get seated first and your server will take your order. No need to go up to the counter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=NVGwBgXGxpZIc_tsg-Pdpg\n\nSF SHOPPING CENTER LOCATION:\nWhat I really love about Ajisen is the convenience factor. For someone like me who uses BART as the major public transportation, it delivers me right at Ajisen. It is located at SF Shopping Center's Food Court.  I get off BART, slurp my noodles at Ajisen, walk around the mall for a little bit to burn the calories, then jump back on BART without having to step on the streets. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=s_qGZSnaEo-1GKDlNYFgLg\n\nSIGNATURE AJISEN RAMEN:\nI've have been to Ajisen twice--first time was on a cold storming day in SF. I had the Ajisen Ramen with pork based broth, meat and veggies.  The broth was very \"creamy,\" pork-y, flavorful and nice. I did not eat the thin pork slices but I heard a young person right next to me saying to her gf in between slurps, \"I like the meat. It's good!\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=A7OLCpZJpeiTJh1apouI5Q\n\nVEGGIE RAMEN:\nLast Friday, on a super gorgeous day in SF, I came here again  after shopping in SF. Since my guy is working a little later I decided to not go home yet. Although the weather was warm and sunny,  I had the Veggie Ramen. This was a pretty and colorful bowl. The shoyu broth was lighter than the pork-based one but very nice and flavorful. It was loaded with veggies including shitake mushroom that added a nice earthy flavor to the ramen experience. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2WImgWUXjKq0OKhu9hWhOA?select=kV5G0FijV-PqnPZV4cFF3A\n\nLOWDOWN:\nContrary to some of the reviews that the ramen at Ajisen is bland and lacking in flavor, I found the soup to be flavorful,  comforting and filling --just like how a bowl of soup should be.  The noodles are okay; neither soggy or chewy.\n\nPORTIONS: The portions are generous and enough to satisfy your hunger. \n\nSNACKS: Ajisen also sells apps like gyoza, fried tofu, etc. and rice plates like eel, pork katsu,  etc They also sell flavored iced teas and bobbas. I had the Mango Iced Tea ($3.50) with my veggie ramen and it was refreshing. \n\nPRICES:  About $8.99 to $9.99 per bowl. A little bit more expensive than pho, but very reasonable for the portions, IMO.", "author": "Leah E."}

The prices are also reasonable and the wait for a table isn't very long. \n\nI tried a ramen dish and a California roll. Both of them were good and satisfying. I also had a boba milk tea and it was good. How convenient! I love having the option to order boba without having to trek it all the way to Chinatown. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an affordable sit down lunch option downtown. \n\nThe only thing that turned me off was the rude waitress. She spent several minutes loudly reprimanding a foreign couple for leaving a bad tip and lecturing them on American tipping customs. I'm sure it's upsetting to get a bad tip but tipping isn't even customary in other countries. I felt pretty bad for the couple. They actually sat back down to redo their check after that public verbal beatdown. How embarrassing. There really isn't even much service here anyways. They take your order, bring your food, and you're done. I actually had to ask several girls for the check before I finally got it and they didn't check in to refill water.", "author": "Nancy C."}

Of course, as most would wander to Westfield, this side of only a few food places make it less busy and each eatery has its own seating.\n\nThe premium pork ramen was with very very delicious rich and flavorful broth, something I rarely experienced. I wish there was more pork but it's plenty of great taste noodles. I could easily have 2 bowls of those next time. This is possibly because I was used to the pricier Katana-Ya version. The beef noodle soup had a lot more meat than the first time I visited.\n\nBeef with enoki mushroom and deep fried squids were okay.\n\nAlso got the mango slush, a perfect hot and cold experience.\n\nThey have a good number of tables and actually have a server taking orders and serving food which is very nice. Did notice they had a waiting list filled with names and figured it must be busy during certain times.\n\nThey actually stop taking customers around 8:30pm as they have to close up the shop as part of the mall rules. They did make a few exceptions but a few folks were turned away when they were already closing down the kitchen and were cleaning it. They did apologize very nicely to everyone who was turned away as well as when they had to give the check while people were still eating.\n\nWhile this place has a Japanese style name and very possibly originated from a Japanese concept/owner, this branch is definitely a Chinese own place as the receipts were in Chinese.

I also did a side of gyoza. Ramen appearance was decent. Nothing interesting here: cabbage, 3 slices chashu pork belly (round format), hard boiled egg, some scallions. Pork broth was smooth and enjoyable (I really liked it!), but the base sauce (tare) was far too mild and contributed little to the bowl. The tare should support a great pork broth and add dimension to the flavor of the soup, but this did neither. Oil amounts and flavor were nothing special. Noodles were cooked to a satisfying firmness with nothing that particularly stood out. Chashu pork was far too dry but had decent softness. Flavor of chashu was just fine. Gyoza was not bad. Both ramen and gyoza served at a great temperature.\n\nI was tempted to do 2 stars, but I guess 3 would be more appropriate, considering how overwhelmingly average and boring this ramen was.", "author": "W.

I really just go here for the ramen.  \n\nThe ramen is quite expensive for a fast-food establishment, so it is safe to say that this place is not for people who are on a \"ramen budget\".  I really like the sesame sprinkles they provide with their noodles so I douse my ramen with sesame whenever I can. I like the texture and taste of the noodles and it is not too soggy or soft when compared to noodles you get from other establishments.  The ramen really sucks up the flavor of the soup. The meat is always tender and flavorful. The broth has that savory umami flavor that I really enjoy and it is not too salty. The serving size is pretty big so it's really hard to finish one bowl.

This ramen house is on the lower level of the San Francisco Shopping Center, between Chipotle and Panda Express. There is line infront, but don't be tricked. There is actually sign-in sheet. Make sure you sign-in, before you start waiting in-line. \n\nThere were four 2 person tables infront and one 5 person group.

Probably got my noodle in 6-8 minutes or ordering.\n\nWe ordered:\n* Spicy Beef Ramen ~$9 (3 of 5) - Tasty, but the spiciness tasted very powdery. The spiciness reminded me of an instant noodle packet's hot spicy powder. It wasn't that great. It wasn't that hot and tasted a bit chalky. The beef chunks were tasty and very tender. But I would put a pass on this next time.\n* Ajisen Best Combo Ramen ~$10 (4 of 5) - Really liked their Hokkaido white ramen soup base. I was so surprised I liked it that much. It was flavorful. I could taste the white broth and minced garlic infused in the soup. It actually complimented the noodle and meats very well. I don't have complaint about the texture of the noodle, it was neither a wow or a nay. I do wish it was a little curlier, it is rather straight looking like a spaghetti. I figure there was a lot of MSG, but it was pretty delicious. At the end of the night, I didn't overdrink water, so maybe, this place doesn't overuse MSG. One can hope.\n\nFor the cafe version of ramen, this place was pretty yummy, especially the Ajisen Best Combo Ramen.

He's super kind and would come by to ask if everything is alright. Always smiling and super nice. The waiter/waitresses are great too depending on who they are. Always greeting you with a smile and ask you if you are finished before taking the bowl/plates away. \n\nWhat I DON'T suggest is the sushi. The sushi there is disgusting. I got the dragon roll and will never get it again. It was basically a california roll with whatever it was on top and the sushi was not your typical small little bite sized sushis.. The rice was about half an inch thick and there is no way for you to shove that shit in your mouth in a bite or even 2 bites. Overall the sushi was terrible. Mind as well splatter rice and crab meat on a plate and serve it as a rice bowl or something. \n\nBut the drinks are really good! I tried their flavored sodas?

The kimchee ramen is pictured but unavailable.\n\n* Premium pork ramen ($8.75): The best part was the extra thin, tender, fatty Kumamoto pork but it felt like there was too much of it (guess I'm used to getting one or two slices in my ramen) and/or it would have been a better bowl of ramen with other types of toppings.  The noodles were straight and thin; they weren't mushy but they weren't firm/chewy enough either. The tonkotsu broth was milky, creamy, with pork flavor not overly salty with an average depth of flavor. A small amount of bland shredded cabbage and some scallions were also included.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-05", "description": "Update:  After I wrote this review the waitress sent me a private message apologizing and saying that she went to her manager and explained what happened.  She was far adamant that she did not get in trouble with management about the incident, and that they didn't ask her to respond to me.  She sent me the message LITERALLY that day.  In my opinion, it seems like someone in management reads the reviews and makes the staff respond.  This poor girl sounded terrified and coerced.  I feel bad that she may be punished for my review, but the experience solidified for me the feeling that these business owners are not good people.  Another \"Yelper\" privately commented to me a couple of days later that \"this must have been a mistake and an isolated incident\".  Ummmmm nope.  I doubt it.  \n\nOriginal review:  \n\nRARELY, if EVER, do I not leave a tip.  But this was ridiculous.  \n\nLet me start by saying that given the time and effort people put into writing reviews, I'm offended when a company hasn't claimed their listing and joined the conversation - show your customers that you care what they are saying.  Ajisen hasn't claimed this listing, which indicates to me that they don't give a shit what people are saying.  Shame on them.  Quite honestly, I used to sell advertising at Yelp, and Ajisen was a prospect of mine.  They never answered calls and I couldn't even get in touch with anyone at their corporate office.  That is, until they wanted to complain about bad reviews, and then they were lighting up my phone.  Yet they don't care enough to claim the listing and actually respond to reviews.  \n\nSo my experience today.  I went with a friend for lunch.  She ordered a Ramen soup dish, and I ordered the cold soba noodle salad, which comes with tofu.  I asked the server if I could have the tofu fried (Who really likes a slab of raw tofu?  Not me), and she said yes and walked away.  When the dish came, it was a slab of raw tofu.  No biggie - I mentioned it, and the guy serving it (waitress was right behind him) says it comes like this.  I stated that the waitress said I could substitute it, and she responded that she thought I was ordering the fried tofu appetizer.  Um....really?  Because you're delivering my dish, and I don't see fried tofu appetizer on my table.  She asked if I still wanted it though, and I said yes.  Okay.  No big deal.  It's $1.95 extra - I can afford that.  10 minutes later she comes back over to the table and asks again if I still want the fried tofu.  Yes Please (I'm getting confused here, but still calm).  Then, as she is turning around and walking away she mumbles \"Okay, I'll go place that order\".  WHAT?!?!  Seriously?  But now she's walked away and doesn't look at me again until another 10 minutes later when she puts it on the table.  \n\nAt this point I had two choices.  1. Ask for the manager and explain what happened, and maybe not pay for the extra tofu.  2. Just don't tip her.  By this time so much time as elapsed that I had to get back to my office - I had a meeting.  So I made sure my friend was comfortable not leaving a tip, and we paid the bill and left.  No tip.  \n\nIt's unfortunate.  If management is reading reviews, I am always happy to give a business a second chance (1 star reviews are not something I like to give - I realize it can affect business).  I am always appreciative of  a response to my reviews, and usually update my reviews accordingly.  So claim your listing and start listening to your customers.  For now, I won't be going back to Ajisen, which is unfortunate because they are so close to my office.", "author": "Cori D."}

I can't get myself to pay $8+ for below-average ramen when I can get $0.50 packaged ramen at home that tastes alot better.\n\nMaybe I'm just really picky with my noodles/ramen.

The mall food court needed an injection of new blood badly and Ajisen Ramen might just do the trick.\n\nToday was grand opening day and the first day jitters showed--no chili flakes for the ramen, things were a little slow to come out, waitresses were a little inefficient--but all these were minor points.\n\nAll in all the service was good--with all the staff being polite and offering service with a smile.\n\nNow, on to the food! My co-worker and I split an order of chicken karagge and agedashi tofu--both were really good considering they were from a \"fast food\" ramen place. I opted for the spicy pork ramen while my colleague got the BBQ pork with corn ramen. Both were great choices! Big portions, lots of meat, and my spicy pork was just spicy enough to tickle my taste buds without having to constantly reach for my milk tea (which was the best boba I've had at this food court!).\n\nAll in all, Ajisen has quickly joined the ranks of Out The Door and Coriander as my food court favorites. I know my co-workers and I will be making many trips back to this place--I just hope we won't get tired of it. That would be a shame.", "author": "Tayson H."}

I had the spicy pork ramen, which came with half a soft boiled egg, cabbage, spicy ground pork, and a few slices of BBQ pork. The broth was extremely flavorful, but definitely on the more oily side. I loved the spice that the ground pork added, but the slices of BBQ pork were probably more than 50% fat.

The portions are big, though not really big enough to share comfortably.  If I'm feeling like a light lunch then I'll make two meals out of it but that probably wouldn't work for most people.\n\nAjisen is also convenient because they take credit card and there aren't many good places to get a quick lunch around Union Square where you can get away with no cash.", "author": "Jean K."}

For mall food, this is probably your best option.  For ramen, it pales in comparison to Tokyo or NYC but represents well for the underrepresented tonkotsu broth by San Francisco standards.  Pretty filling too.\n\nPremium Pork Ramen: The broth was actually impressive.  It was a cloudy white like tonkotsu should be.  Very rich and fatty like I like.  The noodles were chewy, way better than any dried package stuff though not as good as those places that hand pull in house.  The pork itself was both disappointing and enjoyable.  It was disappointing because there was no thick, fall apart pork chunks.  It was enjoyable because those wafer thin deli-like pork slices kind of grew on me.\n\nBeef Enoki Roll: I know this is pretty inauthentic, but that doesn't stop me from loving it.

The two are not affiliated....the SM branch is owned by the same folks who operate Ajisen Fremont. Ajisen SF is part of the chain from SoCal (with locations in SGV, Temple City, Irvine, Santa Monica Westfield...with the first 3 locations aiming for the Taiwanese American and Asian American ramen luvin' demographic). No wonder Daikokuya Monterey Park and Shin Sen Gumi in SGV are not so happening anymore.\n\nYou can tell this place has Chinese staff...the waitresses are all Asian and say \"welcome\" in Japanese with an accent. It is supposed to be \"Irasshaimase!\" (eee-rrrrrashei maaa seeei!) and spoken with true gusto and lung power, especially important by shokunin (professional sushi chefs for life) who are proud and want you to eat at their establishment. \n \nBut somehow when the waitstaff say it, it came out sounding like \"ma-say, ma-say\".\nPerhaps they got too used to saying \"moshi moshi\", which is not too far off from mochi mochi.\n\nStuck with the fail safe order of #2, pork spare rib ramen. The best part was the pork ribs (no bones) with a few giant pieces with a lot of jelly like tendons on them. Everything else was mediocre. The noodles were too thin for my liking, and was more like Cappelini. WTF I am not eating fusion yoshoku and ramen! The broth...super white (like super white tuna) with unrecognizeable brown bits inside (supposed to be darkened shallots or bonito flakes maybe?) shredded cabbage, and that was it. The broth had no depth, and was fairly one. Ajisen San Mateo at least made their broth tastier (maybe MSG?) Well at least I didn't walk out thirsty.\n\nThe beverage menu was a clear giveaway this was a Chinese or Taiwanese operation....iced milk teas, iced tapioca teas, slushees, iced coffees. Was I at Lavender Kow, Boba Boyz, Quick Lee, Express Tapioca, or Bobaville? Ahhh why not....tried the lemon honey green tea....and sadly a $2.75 WATTE (wah-tay....water with several shots of tea, tasted more lemon juice and honey flavored sweetener). I wasn't expecting TPumps, but man Chinatown Ten Ren could do a little better than this.\n\nIt is fascinating that one of the Sogo department stores in Taipei recently and finally got their first ever Santouka Ramen (with lots of anticipation and anxiety) where I'm sure it tastes better than the one in San Jose, and yet the best we have in a mall is a craptacular Ajisen.\n\nAjisen = Taste of Thousands, a Thousand Tastes in kanji....more like a tastedud.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-01-04", "description": "When I think of this place, I literally feel rage. Rage which I recently relived in a conversation with my friend about how spectacularly bad the ramen is. \n\nIn some ways, I am to blame for this horrific ramen experience. I could have walked to Katana-Ya. Correction: I SHOULD have walked the extra few blocks to Katana-Ya. Mall ramen?! What was I thinking?! Granted, this is the Westfield Mall and the food court at the Bloomingdales side of the mall is fantastic. Ajisen Ramen is in the crappy chain food side of the mall (under Nordstrom, near Panda Express). The proximity to Panda Express should have been another indicator. Basically, I was on my lunch break, I wanted ramen, I didn't want to walk to Katana-Ya, and I wanted to give this place a try. \n\nI can't remember what exactly I ordered. It doesn't matter. The noodles themselves are the problem. So basically all the ramen dishes are problematic. I can only describe the noodles as having the consistency of angel hair pasta. It took me a little while to pin this down, but basically from the first bite I knew something was wrong. If you order \"ramen\" at this place, you are basically getting angel hair pasta in soup. Yes, it is as disgusting as it sounds. Yes, thinking about angel hair pasta in soup makes me want to flip over tables in rage. \n\nThe service was mediocre at best-- I can't really remember. I think I was literally blinded by rage in this experience. And I most definitely did not finish those disgusting noodles. I could have gone to the grocery store and bought either Maruchan or Cup of Noodles and it would have been better and considerably cheaper. In fact, if you have a hankering for ramen, do yourself a favor, bypass this place, walk straight to Walgreens, and buy a Cup of Noodles. Seriously. \n\nAfter my father eventually bought from \"fresh\" ramen from the Asian store, I realized that those noodles too also had the same angel hair pasta-texture. So Ajisen's secret is they probably buy their ramen from the Asian store as well. This makes me calm down a little more, as part of my rage was due to thinking that Ajisen clearly thinks that we are all idiots who don't know better and will serve us angel hair pasta in soup and call it ramen. It is now more clear that Ajisen is intent on serving an extremely sub-par product. Blech!\n\nBottom line: I actually hope they go out of business. I'm not a picky food person in the least. I'm really not. I've not had many bad meals, and this is definitely in the top 5 of my worst meals (excluding my mother's cooking. Sorry Mom!). I'm luckily not in that side of the mall often, because I get mad every time I see it there, still in business...", "author": "Jia min C."}

Expect a wait of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the time.

Otherwise, as with most Ajisens around the world, it's a suitably fast, cheap and reasonably satisfying lunch/dinner option.", "author": "Edwin C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-05", "description": "A place like this is all about expectations. Up until now there hasn't been a chain ramen place in SF. It's all been one-off Japanese restaurants serving ramen using their unique, family recipe, etc., very SF. Ajisen is a very un-SF restaurant, given that it is supposed to taste reasonably the same all over the world. So I think people are judging it a little harshly.\n\nFirst of all, the price. The prices roughly match (within $1) those at Katana-ya, which arguably has better ramen overall. But it's expensive to rent property at Westfield, so I am not counting that against them. The price is par for the course for a bowl of ramen in the city, and you can either choose to live with it or move away! Second, most eateries in the mall - except for Panda Express, which is most certainly taking a loss at their Westfield location - have higher than average prices. \n\nSecond, the service. It's blisteringly fast. Within less than 5 minutes, I had my bowl of ramen and was slurping away. This is the heart of ramen: It's fast food by nature, guys.\n\nSo today, I tried the beef curry ramen. Here's the breakdown:\n- BROTH: tastes mildly like curry, mildly like shoyu broth, but overall tastes like not too much in particular. This broth is just not deeply flavored enough to keep up with the rest of the stuff in the bowl.\n- MEAT: the beef is straight out of the yoshinoya beef bowl cookbook. Floppy thin slices, marinated and simmered forever. They tasted OK, and as a testament to how weak the broth is, it was actually stronger-tasting than the broth itself.\n- NOODLES: Not bad, though maybe a little overdone.  Very consistent texture. Would like a bit more bite to it.\n- EXTRAS: cabbage was unusual but a good change of pace. Again, the cabbage's natural flavor was stronger than that of the broth's. Spring onions gave a good kick.\n\nSo it seems I'm giving this place a bad rap. But in all honesty, I wasn't displeased with my meal at all. It's fast food: I expected it to be fast and I expected it to be food, and surprisingly, it didn't entirely disappoint like what I'm used to from other chains. It got the job done. I'm confident that Ajisen can produce a consistently decent product while offering a good selection. The ramen menu is actually more interesting than Katana-ya's -- I definitely crave the pork rib / premium pork ramen and will be coming back for that.\n\nIf the prices were lower, it would be a 4 star. But unfortunately it doesn't seem like they can do much about that, unless they can really find some way to get more customers in their place and widen their margins.", "author": "Josh K."}

It came to about $12 which is pretty pricey for the portion I received, thanks to the mall markup.

The noodles were very well cooked (I judge by how elastic-y they are) and the beef was the perfect tenderness. I just wish they gave me more!

I've tried at least 5 different kinds by now and none of them disappoint. Spicy Beef barely qualifies as spicy but Spicy Pork will give you a good kick in the back of the throat, so choose accordingly.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this place serves bubble tea AND a huge assortment of other beverages, like Peach Passion Fruit Soda. Like their ramen selection, you really can't go wrong with any of these drinks. I usually get a Caramel Milk Tea or Brown Sugar Milk Tea, which costs $4 after I add in the $0.50 tapioca pearls. These two milk tea drinks always come out on the VERY sweet side but I don't mind because I can keep drinking and adding water to it throughout my meal and still have a full cup of overly-sweet milk tea at the end! How nice is that? It's like 2 drinks for the price of 1.\n\nI'm taking off a star because, as most others have said, the food and drinks here are a bit on the pricy side. I guess that's the price of convenience (the other good ramen places I know are at least a 20 minute drive south of SF) and helps keep the lines short-ish. The tapioca pearls are also always a gamble - sometimes they're too soft, sometimes they're in a giant clump, but never are they perfect.

Food court food narrows down to something on the lines of fast food and unhealthy with a sprinkle of low quality.  \n\nTo my knowledge, Ajisen Ramen is a chain restaurant.  It's basically the McDonald's of ramen.  Actually the comparison of TK noodle to a pho establishment would be more suitable.  There was a line there and a signup sheet wait list in front.  After 15 minutes, we were seated.  We sat across from a pair a Japanese speaking folk and watching them try to order in English to the waiter who was Chinese was an interesting sight.  God bless America.  \n\nI got their \"special\" Ajisen ramen and Bun got her usual miso.  Both of our bowls looked very similar from the ingredients with the distinct difference being the color of our broths.  I gave her broth a try and likewise hers to mine.  The word \"canned\" came to mind when I sipped it.  Anything beyond a couple scoops swallowed of the salty liquid was way too much for my taste.  Ingredients in the bowl which included the normal staple of assorted vegetables and cha su also included an overcooked half slice of egg.  All of the listed all tasted like it was packed with preservatives.\n\nOverall taste is the same exact sensation of eating a fast food version of ramen.  It's good for food court level food.

Broth was not that great either. I guess for being in the center of the mall food court, it should deserve a relative amount of business but enough to have people waiting in line for 20 minutes? Given that the place is small and has limited seats i suppose it has limited seating, but i would never wait for it. Watching the line makes me feel like i need to rush and eat so others have the opportunity to eat. Although there was no line when i went here with my brother, it got full fast and the wait began not too long after. \n\nMy opinion of the food is that it is not much better than any other japanese place around the block. Nothing special. Small portion of meat and noodles and extra vegetables that comes with the meal for the price. I was not full, rather It barely managed to keep my stomach from growling further. Meal for my brother and I was $22 + tip for 2 bowls of ramen and 2 waters. \n\nHonestly, the noodles I got were pretty much ramen. Toss in a few pieces of meat and you are set. Not to crazy about the place and probably would never come back I rather take $8 and go next door and get some chipotle to fill myself up.", "author": "Kevin W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-12", "description": "You know, for a place that's located in the food court of SF Center, you'd think Ajisen would be easy to find.  Well, for most people it probably would be.  But for Jenny K. and I, as embarrassing as it is to admit, we had to do a little bit of wandering.  Meeting up for our latest food excursion, I'm pretty sure we probably looked more like tourists trying to find our way than locals.  Whoops.  But hey, we found the place and got in before they closed, so I guess that's all that matters, right?\n\nHaving peaked at what was the most popular item among the Yelp reviews, I already knew I was going to order the Premium Pork ramen before we even found Ajisen.  When it was brought out to the table, it looked pretty darn good - a mound of sliced pork topped with scallions, noodles, and cabbage (yeah, cabbage...I know) with a tonkotsu broth.  Sadly though, I didn't think the ramen backed up its tasty appearance.\n\nAs far as the positives went, I thought that the pork was the highlight of the meal.  Thinly sliced, I was really impressed with the flavor and how moist it was.  Any thinner, and it would have been like paper, but any thicker, and it probably would have felt dried out.  As for the tokotsu broth, it tasted okay, but it wasn't any different than what you could find at other ramen joints (Izakaya Sozai and Saiwaii come to mind, and theirs are better). \n\nOn the flip side, I thought that the ramen noodles were really disappointing.  I don't know if it's supposed to be a different style, but it's nothing like what I'm used to nor what I like.  My biggest issue was the texture/consistency - I like when there's some bite to it, and these were really soft and gummy.  It might be from overcooking (though I doubt it since they weren't coming apart), but my guess would be that it's just the type of noodles (how it's made or what ingredient).  Whatever the reason, I didn't like the taste much either, and so the noodles really killed the whole thing for me.  Well, that and the cabbage.  I understand wanting to include some sort of vegetable so that it's not just noodles and pork, but it felt misplaced.  I don't know of any other place that includes it in their ramen, and they would have been better off leaving it out or using something like bean sprouts or spinach.\n\nFor someone who works nearby or that's doing a day of shopping downtown, Ajisen would be good for a convenient lunch or as a food court option.  However, as a destination (and compared to other ramen joints), it's not worth the trouble of finding/paying for parking on its own.  For ramen in that area, you're better off making the walk over to Katana-ya (even with the wait).", "author": "Mike L."}

My friend and I eyes rubbed our eyes in disbelief, then I rubbed them some more because they itched.  I initially came here to eat Great Steak, however, either Ajisen or Panda Express replaced that place.  What a travesty.  Expecting to walk up to the counter, I was in for another surprise.  This was a sit in restaurant and there was a clipboard outside to sign your name.  Because we came at the tail end of lunch hour, we were immediately seated.  Our waitress was extremely gracious and attentive.  I ordered the bbq pork ramen while my cronie ordered the spicy pork ramen.  The wait was not long at all and in short time, two piping hot bowls of ramen were before us.  Sipping the tonkatsu broth, it was pretty good, exceeding expectations.  It was hearty and rich, in flavor and MSG.  The bbq pork was very tender, however, while savory, the portions were scant.  Each piece was cut razor thin.  The corn was plentiful and buttery.  The egg was a little tough and the yolk solid.  Usually, I like the yolk watery and the egg whites to be softer.  This felt like a hard boiled half egg.  There were bits of cabbage in my ramen also which added a nice crunch.  The only complaint I had were the noodles.  The texture was not too my liking.  They tasted like packaged ramen noodles.  For food court food, Ajisen is pretty good.  The bowls are a little small for the $10 price tag, however, for a lunch that won't induce food coma, I definitely recommend it.  I nearly finished drinking the broth because it was that good knowing I shouldn't because the MSG content would make me so thirsty.  Half an hour later, eternal thirst set in and 4 bottles of water were downed.    \n\nI found out that Ajisen Ramen is the McDonalds of ramen.  It is a chain restaurant.  The sad thing is that this mall ramen spot is better than some of the more specialized ramen joints I've had, some that are rather heralded.  \n\nA rad thing they have is that you can order to go and they hand you one of those tokens that light up when your food is ready like BJs.  Oh yah, they give you mini ladels to eat your food.  I am not a person who eats in small nibbles.  I like to load my spoon up with shit and the ladel is wadDUUUP.

What became an issue is when the host/waitress started berating me and my friends for walking in to sit down as I had never been here before and didn't realize they actually prefer to walk you to your table. For this I apologize but, to be fair, nothing there makes it clear that this is how things are run as this is in the middle of a mall food court versus an actual restaurant-style sit-down. She was passive aggressive and made negative comments to other patrons about not understanding why we were walking inside. Why not simply tell us directly as we clearly aren't doing it to anger anyone? That was extremely rude and embarrassing. I'm not sure the owners would expect this kind of service coming from someone they hired. The kicker was that 15 seconds after she made fun of us for walking in to sit down, she grabbed the list of customers and read off the first name... which was from our group of friends.

And we had decided to take a bit of extra time to look over the drinks, so we just asked for water. About 5 minutes later more people arrived and tables were filled up. We decided to order 2 drinks. My sister had some sort of ice tea drink and I ordered a Peach Mango Soda.\n\nWe finished our food 20 minutes later and asked one of the waitress where our drinks were. She said she would check on it. 5 minutes later we told same girl our meal was finished and asked where our drinks were and she replied 'your checks?' No OUR DRINKS! At that point I was so mad already that I decided I didn't want the drink anymore. When she finally brought our drinks, my sister took her drink and I asked for the waitress to take mine back and take it off our bill.\n\nThen I'm guessing who was the manager came. He asked if there was anything wrong with the drink and I told him 'No, but we're finished with our meals and you just brought it out, we don't want it anymore.' Then he tried to make excuses like 'Oh, it was busy.' And I told him if it was busy then why did all these other people got their drinks already?

It does NOT take 20 minutes to make I don't care when I ordered it. It takes less than a minute.\n\nThis Asian guy with glasses was insulting my intelligence and testing my patience. How hard is it to take the drink back and take it off of the tab. It was only $3.50 for christ sakes.

Not your usual gyoza since they seemed to be filled with veggies instead of meat. They were just OK.  The milk green tea with boba was good.  I love being able to chew my tea. It was very sweet & tasted just like green tea ice cream so I got my drink & dessert all at the same time. \n\nI'm not sure if there are any other ramen places in this area, but this one will do in a pinch.", "author": "Erin S."}

For my first \"real\" ramen experience, I have to say, it was pretty damn great!  I ordered the vegetable bowl and received a huge bowl of noodles and broth, topped with corn, two types of mushrooms, carrots and some nori pieces.  Along with a peach tea, I had so much food, I could barely finish it all.  My coworkers tried the Spicy Pork and Shoyu, and they ordered a side of Gyoza as well.  \n\nWhile it's in the mall and technically \"food court\", this is a restaurant of sorts where you can sit down and get your food freshly made.  The line up outside dictates how long it will take you to get served, as the service itself was pretty quick.  There appeared to be takeout as well, if you want to grab and go.\n\nWe'll probably be adding this onto our list of lunch spots to go to regularly, as it was good food and a decent price.  Only drawback for me, there's one vegetarian option available in the ramen. It's definitely worth getting more than once, but I fear I'll get tired of only one choice each time we go.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Or at least that's what yelp said. :)\n\nI was aware this is a chain restaurant especially my very first experience of Ajisen was in China! Though China's Ajisen had a more extensive menu with so many different ramen and rice dishes, noodle soups and appetizers, I did my very best NOT to compare it with SF's Ajisen.\n\nBecause of meeting up with a friend and deciding where to eat for brunch, she chooses Ajisen since we're already inside the mall. It was not crowded when we were seated with menus placed in front of us. With only one side of the menu offering different ramen dishes, it was a very limiting choice for me since they had only one chicken, one vegetables, and one seafood ramen noodle soups. I decided to order the Chicken ramen while my friend ordered some shoyu pork ramen. Apparently, if you want your ramen soups to be spicy, they charge you $1-2 for it which I thought it was lame. Of course the waitress did say she was going to get some hot chili sauce (the rooster kind) for me to add in my ramen. \n\nRamen comes out. My friend seems to enjoy her bowl very much. I, in the other hand, not very much. Either I was not in any mood of eating ramen, or did not order the ramen dishes they're known for. Anyway...\n\nFriend: \"How was your chicken ramen?\" \nMe: \"Tastes like something died. I mean, the chicken's not fresh at all\"\nFriend: \"Uh....\"\nMe: \"The soup base smells too gamey.

It made the ramen taste gross!  The noodle was a strange texture.  Not very enjoyable.  I ordered my ramen with extra spiciness and it was far from it.  There goes $2 I'll never see again.  It's definitely not horrible...but I guess I should have known better than to have high expectations.

The servers were attentive, but this a shopping mall and it's a mall restaurant.  It should be like all the other restaurants here where you order at the counter, especially considering that this is just ramen.  I'm sure counter service would also increase efficiency and profits due to better table turnover.

Like I said, I didn't get far. She was really rude and asked if she should make another one. WTF again! a significant portion of the soup spilled on my Burberry jacket (which i now have to get dry cleaned, thanks b*tch) so those stupid noodles end up costing me $20. I was really angry at the fact that she blamed me for a loose lid on the soup!!! Of course I want another one, most of the soup spilled!!!

The soup is tonkatsu ramen -- the broth is simmered with pork for many hours, so long that it takes on a buttery, creamy texture and turns white.  The pork is tender and delicate, salty and sweet.

My kids love ramen...and usually don't discriminate but this place was a first for us where both my boy and girl didn't finish their shared bowl.  I don't blame them...\n\nFirst off we ordered the two Ajisen Ramen for my wife and kids and the spicy pork ramen for myself.  We also ordered the fried chicken and baby octopus.  Every thing went down hill from there:\n\nFirst off the fried chicken... guess i was expecting Kaarge...this tasted like Chicken McNuggets.  The baby octopus seemed way over cooked and over marinated... we didn't finish either plates.\n\nNow the Ramen:\n\n1. Looks like Tongotsu broth, kinda has the texture of tongotsu...but didn't have that nice deep taste of broth brewed for long periods.  Just didn't have the richness of a long simmered broth.\n2. I needed lots of water after wards... probably loaded with msg.\n3. the noodles... reminds me of thinner spaghetti and not egg noodle that i like about in other ramen places.  \n4. Cabbage...they put fresh cabbage in... the taste and texture combo of cabbage did not suit me at all.. no bamboo shoots, no corn for the texture\n5. Egg way over done... \n6. I think they meant to give me char shui, but the pork looked like thin pork belly.\n\nMaybe I'm too use to the the way ramen is typically made here and this is supposed to be the style from a specific region ... but it just didn't do it for me... heck I'd rather stick to top ramen than this crap.

The F ordered the spicy pork ramen and I got the premium pork ribs ramen.  I suspect the broth being the same for both dishes but the F's one was really spicy after he mixed in the ground spicy pork.  The broth was really tasty and creamy.  The premium pork ribs were super soft and tender with bits of tendon within the meat.  It was so soft that even the tendon wasn't chewy.  \n\nThe negatives?  The noodles used wasn't exactly ramen noodles.  It was almost like white soba noodles.  If they had used the actual chewy, egg colored ramen, it would have been really good.  The prices were a bit steep for ramen, especially when there wasn't much toppings to the bowl and the portions were quite small.  So small in fact that I wanted to go to the food court afterwards to eat something else.  \n\nAjisen is definitely better in LA...maybe its the extensive menu they have there or maybe it's because I remember them using the right noodles...but as for this location, eh.

I know they just opened so maybe they need to figure out flow better. The cash registers are near the only opening for the wait staff to get to the kitchen so the people in line had to constantly move.  After you've placed your order they have you go all the way to the front of the restaurant to wait. Definite flow problem. My suggestion, have a register for to go orders at the front.\n\nGot my order and was walking with it and noticed that the broth was spilling into the bag. When I got home I noticed that there's a big hole in the lid that would normally be used to let out condensation... but don't use that same lid for soup broth!!! The whole was about the size of a nickel. No wonder my bag had soup in it.\n\nI eat my noodles and it's ok. And then 15 minutes later I got a case of the gurggles.

They also make the most DELICIOUS popcorn chicken. When I first ordered it, I was literally expecting heavily fried and breaded popcorn chicken. I was DELIGHTED to find that it was more like the fried chicken you'd find with rice in a typical Chinese restaurant - very juicy, lots of flavor, actually tastes like CHICKEN. I've also had their boba - it's alright.\n\nI think the way seating works at this restaurant is a little confusing - you have to line up and wait to be seated, instead of ordering in the front and picking a place to sit like most mall restaurants.

In any case, the first time I was here I had the pork-based ramen and it was \"Eh\".  Certainly doesn't hold a candle to some of the perennial places on my list, but I didn't think it was all that good.  Anyway, I went here last night right before doing some serious damage at Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale, and got the Shoyu Ramen.  Understanding that I was hungry but not in the mood to deal with mediocrity again, I went with something different.  The result? I was actually surprised that it resembled something that I'm familiar with.  My friend and I split an order of gyoza and those tasted like they were reheated in a microwave, but I wasn't expecting anything great.  So to recap all of it, I would say that the whole experience overall was OK.  I certainly didn't think it was bad, and would say that it's better than the ramen experience I had at Kamakura here in the Financial District.  At ~$9.00, it's a little steep considering it's just a bowl of noodles, but I suppose you could do worse at Westfield.

And not the \"Top\" kind that got you through college.\n\nAjisen Ramen is actually a chain restaurant.  If you travel to places like Japan, Hong Kong, China, the Philippines you just may see an Ajisen Ramen in the airport or some other area where tourists go.  I guess you could call them the \"Panda Express\" of ramen.\n\nIf you want a top notch bowl of ramen, go to Santa Ramen or Genki Ramen.  If you want an easy, quick and acceptable quality bowl of ramen then Ajisen is a safe bet for you.  Easy access from the Powell St BART station.", "author": "Patrick V."}

It's aight, but as many reviewers have pointed out, the broth looks flavorful, but don't be fooled; it's very watery and at the end, I can see the fat settling at the top. \n\nTo speak about the service, I've always had a fairly positive service experience here. I'm in and out anywhere from 20-30 minutes (if I eat quickly) so I go here when I need a fast meal.

The location inside the mall is just off the exit of Powell BART so I can go in, get my grub on, and then hop on the train and make it back home in time for the latest episode of 30 Rock! Good deal sir!\n\nThe space itself is small but nice and bright and clean! They seat you right away and they're there to take your order quickly and efficiently. I always order the spicy beef ramen, I like my soup hot and spicy (in fact, I think they could take the spice factor up a notch or two but I eat fire on a normal basis so that's being a little biased). Now, I gave this place 4 stars not because it's really good ramen, in reality it's about a 3.5 but I have to give the place some credit -- for being a semi-fast food joint, the quality of the ramen is pretty spectacular (meaning to say, it's not Top Ramen!). They pack a good amount of noodles, broth, vegetables in that bowl (the ladle spoons are so fun to eat with) and the beef is nice and tender. \n\nAll in all, it's great for when you're cold, hungry, and your feet are aching from all the countless miles you've walked window shopping (or shopping-shopping) and you're in need of some TLC in a bowl. \n\nQuick tip: The mango-lychee-cranberry juice may sound weird but it's so good!

As expected, it was delicious!  The noodles were perfect and there were lots of thin slices of fatty pork and about 5 pieces of spareribs, tendons attached.  If you like tendon, it's great!  If not, well you can just set it aside like my sister did.   Also in the ramen was slices of cabbage.  Both ramens had the same broth, which was nice and rich and not too salty!

However, after one visit, I have to say that it's kind of disappointed.  For any of you who have been to the Ajisen Ramen in LA, don't expect the same here.  Both the noodle and soup aren't that flavorful here, and the Ramen places in J town are actually better.  But given this is kind of the only Ramen place in SF downtown, I may still come by when shopping around, but just don't expect too much here.", "author": "Bryan W."}

The Miso Ramen was okay...not the best, but decent.  The broth was seasoned just right and the portion size was typical say the portion sizes overseas.  The Calfornia roll???  Well, let's just say that it could have been store bought...haha.\n\nSince this is a ramen place, the atmosphere was very causual, and prices very reasonable.   Service was brisk.\n\nI would love to have a ramen house by my work place as I work in the Mission and need an occasional break from wolfing down burritoes...but alas, at least now I can settle for some okay Japanese Ramen downtown before barting home to Contra Costa.", "author": "Jason C."}

But for mall food, I think it's a great option, especially if you've exhausted your options on the other side of the mall in the new food court.\n\nIt's sit down with waiter/waitress service. My service was very fast and efficient. But it seemed like they forgot the dude next to me's order. He was there before I arrived, I ordered and got my food while he was still sitting there.

Located in the food court at the San Francisco Center mall already gave me low expectations of this place, but I was surprised at how authentic the ramen was. I have to say that this place does not have the best ramen that I have ever tasted in my life, but it is the best ramen that you can get without having to wait in a 30 minute line. (This is a direct slam against Katana-ya). I have been here 3 times and have ordered the corn with BBQ pork ramen twice and can I tell you, I was literally smiling as I picked up my chopsticks and spoon and dug in. I have also ordered the spicy pork ramen which the waiter said was his favorite, but I didn't think this one was as good as the corn BBQ. It has a good spicy kick and the broth was light and flavorful, but I think I just love the sweetness of corn mixed with miso.

This is an awesome addition to the Union Square area. \n\nThere was quite a crowd, so we had a to wait a few minutes for a table. We ordered one bowl of the BBQ pork and corn ramen, and one bowl premium pork ramen with added corn ($1 extra).\n\nThe corn was a good choice: it added some needed variety to the texture and flavor. The broth itself (tonkotsu) was rich, milky and meaty, but it lacked that extra dimension of flavor that you might find at a place like Santa Ramen. Toward the bottom of the bowl I found myself losing interest in the broth.\n\nStill, this was a very satisfying bowl of ramen. The portions of noodles and pork were extremely generous. Noodles were firm and had the right flavor. Both the BBQ pork and the premium pork were tasty, but I think I preferred the thicker, fattier (and more affordable) BBQ pork.\n\nAs I said, the extra order of corn was important. Otherwise there weren't many interesting goodies: no bamboo shoots, a tiny amount of seaweed, no ginger, no garlic. The premium pork bowl didn't come with egg. I found myself craving kimchi to add some crunch and extra flavor, but they didn't have it.\n\nService was friendly and energetic, with staff shouting \"irashaimase!\" as customers arrived and \"arigatou gozaimashta!\" as they left.\n\nIn addition to ramen, the menu has lots of cold drinks like bubble tea, and they serve gyoza, agedashi tofu and curry rice.", "author": "Matt B."}

My first time here I had the tender pork ribs ramen and I devoured it. It was absolutely delish! The pork rib was super juicy and tender. The ramen was not too hard or chewy and not soggy, and the broth was perfectly seasoned not too salty... it was such a heavenly experience :). I've also had the Ajisen Ramen, that's a standard one. The spicy pork ramen is really good too. It's pretty spicy for when you want some kick to your ramen. I've also had the premium pork that one is so-so. I wasn't so crazy for the cut of the pork meat so thinly sliced. I've also had the miso ramen with bbq pork, that's also a winner. The pork slices are so tender and the miso broth is delightful. It's a little bit creamy and a good salty, not I need to down a gallon of water salty. I could drink every drop (and sometimes I do), but I know that's not the best thing to do gulping all that sodium. I've also had some of the rice dishes. Their fried chicken is tasty. I've had it as a curry dish and by itself as a snack. Their curry is ok. I've definitely had better japanese curry, but it's decent. Their curry tonkatsu is the only thing that I've tried on the menu that wasn't a thumbs up. The pork was really dry and tough and soaking it in the curry sauce did not help. But besides that everything else is great! The staff is super friendly. It get's really busy and this place is a mall spot so it's small and limited seating. The wait is killer so I usually take it to go. The only time I sit there to eat is if it's early enough. The mall opens at 10am, but they technically don't start serving their food until 10:30am, which sucks sometimes when I have to take an early lunch.
