I was pleasantly surprised to have such a good experience here being it was my first time eating here and having lived in SF all my life. My coworkers recommended this place and it was a great place for our big group. \n\nYou order at the register, pay, and get seated. Then a server comes to serve drinks to you and your food as well. \n\nMy friend and I shared the spicy shrimp pasta dish and it was good, not very spicy. I mentioned that I was going to share the dish with my friend at the register and they brought out two separate bowls for us so that was nice! The serving size is definitely on the smaller side but I felt full after. My coworkers ordered the margarita pizza and it looked amazing too. Everything looked fresh and delicious. \n\nService is super friendly and attentive. I appreciate how kind they were even though we were staying a little close towards their closing time. \n\nI am leaning towards coming back to try other dishes!", "author": "Debby N."}

This restaurant is probably one of the healthier options inside Stonestown. \n\nMy favorite dish is the skirt steak. I don't generally enjoy skirt steaks, but they cook it perfectly. The chimichurri and potatoes complete the meal. This dish is $18+ pre-tax. You may not be getting the most bang for your buck here as portion size is on the smaller end, but I never feel grossly full afterwards either. Instead, I feel I've consumed delicious food that is good for my body, and makes me pleasantly full. \n\nLocated on the bottom floor of Nordstrom, you can't miss it as there will most likely be a line during lunch/dinner hours. You line up, place your order and pay, then take your receipt to a table of your choosing. A server will come by and put your order in. I've always enjoyed the service as they are usually sweet, elderly folks! The only part that turns me away from dining here is the crowd!

Everything on the menu has a calorie count next to it.\n\nAt $12.25 I tried the Santa Fe' Chicken Sandwich with a simple side salad. Although it bears no resemblance to anything I've had in Santa Fe', it wasn't bad. I think it was sliced processed chicken breast.  It arrived on what looked and tasted like toasted white bread with aioli, avocado, bell pepper, caramelized onion and cheese.  The accompanying side salad was just a bite with a few croutons, a cherry tomato then dusted with Parmesan. \n\nAt $17.50 the Salmon with roasted Vegetables and Farro was a bit overpriced and dry. I've never had anything like the Veggies Farro before so it's difficult to describe. It's more like a salad, red and yellow bell pepper mixed up and then sprinkled with a little Parmesan, not my favorite. I honestly don't know if I eat here again.", "author": "Caesar A."}

If you're looking for one with more options, the one in Westfield Mall downtown is the place to go since it is an actual restaurant. I like to go to this one because you don't have to wait. You just order at the register and they bring your food to you.\n\nIt's located at the bottom floor near kid's clothes and lingerie. They close around 7pm. My favorites here are the chinese chicken salad, chicken caesar salad, and the angel hair pasta with salmon and asparagus (which has unfortunately been discontinued since last year... *cries*). I never crave pasta and don't really like it, but that angel hair pasta was one of the few exceptions. It was SO good. They occasionally have it as their weekly special nowadays but I wish they still had it on the menu! The chinese chicken salad has the perfect balance of dressing, vegetables, and lettuce - it's my favorite here. You can also order a half order of their salads, just in case you just want it as a side for your main meal. \n\nThey always offer you bread while you wait. You either get the typical sourdough or you might be lucky and get these crispy cheesy breads that are delish!\n\nComplimentary mint chocolates at the end of your meal! I like how you pay ahead of time so once you finish eating, you don't have to worry about flagging down a waiter for the check and you can just leave.", "author": "Sydney C."}

The line was really long as it was right around 12pm.  They only had one cashier and she seemed new so she was quite slow.  Definitely needed to get another cashier to move things along.  I finally ordered and took a seat at a nice corner table.  I ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza with pesto sauce.  And a snickerdoodle cookie.  The pizza came pretty quickly.  It was tasty but a bit greasy. Loved the pesto sauce.  It was very garlicky.  Also, I took the cookie to go and ate it later.  It definitely was not a snickerdoodle cookie.  It was tasteless sugar cookie.  Normally I like Nordstrom Cafes a bit better.  Maybe it was just a busy day. I definitely prefer their other locations.", "author": "Karen C."}

I've been \"semi-frequenting\" the Nordstrom Cafe or now to my revelation, is now called \"Marketplace Cafe\" since I was in my teens; The Menu and everything else still says \"Cafe Nordstrom\" .. Anyway The food isn't very good, the waiters, waitresses and busboys are mostly friendly and give decent to good service but as far as the food goes, it reminds me of a greasy spoon that is a little overpriced. \n\nYou order at the front before you are seated, pay and then go and find a vacant table for yourself. A waitress shows up to serve you and you leave 15-20% tip. My dad leaves 10% but it is widely known throughout the midwest; .. or the Bay Area that the old man is a super cheap guy! just embarrassing because sometimes it actually works out to less than 10%\n\nAs I said the food is not very good, you're mainly getting cheep greasy food with the added benefit of dining in a nice restaurant atmosphere. I've tried a lot of things on the menu despite only patronizing this place a couple to a few times a year and I have concluded that it is at least slightly overpriced with nothing particularly good on the menu. It's just one of a couple of places at Stonestown where you feel that you're eating at a restaurant and not at the food court or McDonald's. The other place being The Olive Garden. Chevy's closed a few years back and is now occupied by Chipotle and Peet's Coffee. \n\nI never had an opinion strong enough to leave a positive or negative review on this place in the past, but today I went there with my niece right around the busy lunchtime hours at around 1-1:30 PM and it was so crowded when we first got there with a huge line and no available tables that I thought for sure we would go somewhere else but after my niece played with Christmas toys just outside for a half hour to 45 minutes, the line actually died down and I saw some tables so we had lunch there after all. \n\nI was kind of nervous about ordering and getting a table, trying to read the menu and the kids menu all while keeping an eye on my niece, so I looked at the menu and I tried all the other sandwiches, except for the Chipotle Grilled Cheese so with having ten seconds to decide opted for the \"Chipotle White Cheddar Grilled Cheese sandwich with aged cheddar and jack, roasted tomato, chipotle spread on crisp country bread\" .. Sounds fancy and for 10.50 it should be some kind of souped up grilled cheese, but when it arrived at my table, I thought wow! this is almost like a kids menu item or a homemade grilled cheese. It was basically two slices of bread with some cheese in-between. No lettuce, tomato or any other condiment that would justify the price. I did not care for the chipotle flavor either. I could feel the weight of it just picking it up; \"this is a kids menu item at best\" served with some kettle chips.\n\nI can't remember everything I've had here over the years or decades but from recent memory, the other sandwiches are not very good either! The chicken club, the French dip, the Panini's all disappointing; Boudin's makes better sandwiches! but the grilled cheese is an absolute joke for what they charge! that's like a buck fifty in ingredients. I have also recently had the Salmon which is also not very good, overcooked dry and greasy. It is very rare for me not to enjoy a salmon dish but this place pulled that off as well. Pasta dishes are also not very good, I have never tried any of their personal pizzas here but I wish I ordered one today as they are only a few dollars more than the pathetic grilled cheese that I ordered. The (non refill) $3 glass of coke was extremely watered-down. My niece ordered the \"Pasta in tomato cheese sauce\" which is basically Mac and Cheese with tomato based pasta sauce. She said she liked what she ordered but she's sevn years old and just like Mikey from the old Life cereal commercials, she likes everything.", "author": "David A."}

I usually get the angel hair pasta with salmon and asparagus or braise pot roast beef with egg noodle. Of course whenever you order pasta, its usually over $10.

Their cilantro lime chicken salad is one of my favorite salads, maybe ever. I just wish it was a little bigger! When I want something more filling, I get the chicken tomato alfredo.

Compared to the fastfood at the food court, Nordstrom Cafe serves simple and healthier options.\n\n*French Dip ($10.75): warm roast beef, tender and pink inside, with melted white cheddar and garlic aioli. Beef is of good quality, not dry or stringy. The baguette could be more toasty but it was warm.

I prefer the previous brand verses what they serve now. It just tastes and looks different even. I know it isn't much of a difference, but it's there. Such a bummer they switched companies. I used to have a stash of these saved in my backpack because my wonderful boyfriend always, always saved them for me. \n\nAlso, if you noticed that they started bottling their salad dressing, the house balsamic vinaigrette is not  up for sale. They told me they haven't been able to get the recipe down for a bottle version, but if you like, you CAN call in the day before and tell them you would like to pick some up the next day and they will make extra for you.

I come here all the time because I love their tomato soup and their grilled Santa fe chicken sandwich. But the minute I walked in there I had one terrible experience after another. So I come in the restaurant with my cousin after a morning at the gym and I'm standing in line looking at my phone cause the cashiers were still busy with other guests. I'm not blaming this experience on the restaurant but the lady behind me screams \"NEXT!!!\" in my ear to the moment where I get scared and start walking but there was no cashier to help me. I look back at her with a mean look cause she basically yelled in my ear and laughed about it and didn't even apologize. I understand that you're older than me but that gives you no right to be rude and scream in people's ears. Anyway, finally me and my cousin are next and the cashier is anything but helpful. We order the same thing with salad and they're usually supposed to ask what kind of dressing we want and the cashier assumed we wanted the same dressing. So we tried to explain it to the cashier and she said \"your server will get that for you\" and my cousin was thirsty so she was trying to ask for a cup of water and the cashier kept saying \"your server will get that for you\". So we sit at our table and I'm already in a bad mood because I just got yelled at for no reason and we waited for our server to the point where my cousin got up to get some water. Our server apologized and said \"oh I'm sorry I could have gotten that for you in seconds\". So we ate our food which was good up until the end where I'm just a few sips from finishing my water and I notice a FLY in the lemon. So at this point Im disgusted and I let my server know. Usually when there's a bug in anyone's food or drink the meal should be compensated. But he talked to the manager and just said I was going to get a free dessert. I just burst out crying because I was already having a terrible day and I had just came from the gym and dessert is not going to help my situation of having a healthier lifestyle. I just took the dessert so I could give it to my daughter. I used to love going here up until this experience. I guess you could come here if you like flies in your drink.", "author": "Gladys R."}

As I said, it's a great place to stop off if you're shopping.  It's also a good choice if you're on the SF State campus and don't mind walking a block or two for your lunch.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

The tomato soup with herb and cheese covered crustinis  on the side is extremely satisfying for creamy tomato soup lovers.

Great sandwiches, soups, salads, and a kids menu including mac n cheese,grilled cheese, tomato soup, and fruit.  Today I had the California Grill and enjoyed the warm buttery toasted sourdough bread, crispy bacon, slices of avocado, turkey, all held together by the oozing melting cheese. The mixed green salad includes cuts of cherry tomatoes and a tangy sweet dressing. \n\nBut i'm giving it 3 stars because we always have LOUSY SERVICE.  Today we asked for 2 cups of water and 1 coffee. The waitress came back with the coffee, cream, but no spoon!  How are we supposed to stir the cream and sugar in? We had to opt for the knife. But now we have a coffee covered knife :( And she only gave us 1 cup of water. Then we waited around forever for her to come by again to refill the coffee. And we got tired of waiting for the check so we just left the minimum tip and went on our way. I'm sad about having to leave before  we got our check.. My favorite part of the nordstrom cafe has always been the chocolate mint sticks they give you with your receipt!\n\nSandwich + coffee = $11.99 (not including tip)", "author": "Samantha L."}

The bug crawled around for awhile all over her sand which and Kettle chips. We could barely get the attention from any of the waiters so I hunted someone down and told him. He came over to the table and said \"Well what do you want me to do? Do you want more chips or something\" LOL\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Is he serious right now?! How about you give her a new plate or something. The waiter was an idiot and I expect more from a place like that.

It's really nice to find a nice, sit-down place with gourmet cuisine, that's fast, convenient, and at an affordable price.  Nordstrom's Cafe offers all the those conveniences, complete with full and fast service.  The one in Stonestown is generally the eatery I prefer when I'm meeting at that mall with friends or shopping.\n\nLast time I was there with my boyfriend, we both started off with the soup of the day (for Saturday) - Baked Potato.  It came with a parmesan crostini that tasted just right when dipped in the creamy and savory soup.  He ordered the French Dip Sandwich with a salad with balsamic vinigarette.  The dipping sauce was just right.  I, of course, ordered my favorite - Chicken and Wild Mushroom Gnocchi.  If you've never tried gnocchi before, or even if you have, trust me - you'll fall in love with this one.  The sauce, the dumplings, and the veggies just go together so well.  \n\nThe cafe has lots of different desserts to choose from - from mixed fruit bowls, to a decadent chocolate turtle cake...but we chose a slice of red velvet that day.  Although it was just a tad bit dry...still I can say:  YUM!  The cream cheese frosting frosting wasn't too overpowering or too rich, and of course, red velvet cake is all together delicious in itself.\n\nThe food is great, and the service is always wonderful.  Everyone is always in a pleasurable disposition, and never lets your water glass go empty.  Our server that day was Natasha, and she was so nice...she was very friendly.  \n\nSo, if you're at Stonestown, stop by and you'll see what I mean when I say this place is great...", "author": "Maria-Zenaida M."}

I haded the cashier the money and my aunt lunged at her and threw her money at the poor girl servicing us. To spare her, I backed off and let my aunt pay for us.\n\nMy mother, great-aunt and I sat down at a table for 4 and we were served our drinks very promptly. Our sandwiches came at the same time and they were much larger than expected (that's what she said.) The three of us shared a California Grilled Sandwich and fresh fruit salad and a Veggie Sandwich and salad with thousand island dressing on the side. I didn't have the California (it had bacon and chicken, and I don't like meat) but I very much enjoyed the Veggie sandwich. There we sprouts, spinach, sundried tomatoes, cucumbers, the usual, but what impressed me was their use of aoili. Most restaurants cover the taste of vegetables with their spreads and sauces in their \"veggie\" sandwiches. But in this sandwich, the aoili was incredibly light. They weren't just being stingy either, it was just enough to enhance the taste of everything, but not so much that it was the only thing you could taste. \n\nOnce we looked done, our waitress handed us the \"tip bill\". Little did she know, my aunt is a chatterbox that takes half an hour to finish a sandwich and another half hour to finish her coffee.

I was initally drawn in by the restaurant like feel within the Nordstrom's.  The first thing I notice as I pick up the menu is that there is hardly a selection of food.  There were two choices of pastas, I believe two choices in sandwiches, and four salads to choose from.  Since when does a restaurant have more salads than entrees? When I go into a restaurant I want to eat food, not trees...I ordered a soup and sandwich combo for $8.95.  Described as  turkey sandwich with avocado, tomato, and lettuce, a side of tomato basil soup, and garlic cheese crostini on the side.  It sounds fabulous, and I'm not too concerned about the price because I'm getting a lot of stuff, right?? The food comes out ten minutes later, and on my plate, I see the smallest half sandwich I've ever seen, with a tiny little bowl of pink paint colored soup, no bigger than the size of a post it, and a pathetic sliver of bread they call a crostini.  The sandwich was below average, the soup tasted like an overly pureed dipping sauce, and the sliver of crostini was the best tasting part of the meal.  I finished the sandwich and the crostini, and left the paint soup atop my nine dollar plate.  I'd say the best part of my experience here was when they brought out these dark chocolate mint sticks along with the check.

You can find it in the lower floor of the Norstrom store in the Stonestown Mall area.  The ambience is the same muted colors, with warm furnishings and  waiters/waitresses service.  You still place your orders through the cafeteria-like lines, but the (in our case) waitress  name \"Glem\" brough us our lunch.  I asked for my order in a take out container and to eat at the cafe.  The casher informed me that their policy is you can eat in but cannot have a take out container - only when you are leaving.  My guests ordered (shared)  Cheesy Steak Mushroom Sandwich on ciabatta roll  ($9.95)and their own bowl of tomatoe Basil Soup ($4.50).  Their soup of the day was Apple Lentil. ($4.50 for bowl, and $3.50 for cup)  My other guests both ordered the Salmon Angel Hair Pasta ($9.95).   I, of course, went for their cheesy steak sandwich as well since you have a choice of salad(salad dressings are ranch, thousand island, or vinegarette) or chips included.  My sandwich was more than \"yummy\" --- with the cheesy over the fresh mushrooms and beef were tender and hot.  The ciabatta was crunchy , well-lightly toasted.  My companions all enjoyed their meals as well.  However, one wished her Salmon Angel Hair Pasta had more grated cheese on it.  I would suggest that the wait person should have come with a bowl of grated cheese and asked if anyone wanted more on their plate.  It was a full house with families, senior citizens, etc.  - shoppers.  I've learned that during the peak hours (lunch time) it would have a long queue out the door.  The special dessert was Strawberry Shortcake (but I've noticed that it is on their regular dessert menu).  Tea Time Service!  Now, that surprised me.  The Cafe carry an assortment of teas and  tarts, fresh fruits (mixed or berries with whipped cream and a cookie), assorted cookies, pies and cakes (carrot).

It also goes to show the complete disconnect between the people who run the cafe with the growing population who want a healthy option.  We've been coming here for many years.  We've enjoyed their portobello sandwich which went away and was replaced by a vegetarian panini (tomatoes, sprouts, sundried tomatoes, avocado, cucumber).  Now they even took that away.  Faced with no other option on the menu other than a \"green salad\" we asked if they could put together a sandwich.  They said the only thing they could add only what was available in their kitchen -  lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber.  I had to ask about the avocado and they said yes.  Ordered it anyway because we were with a group of friends and didn't want to have to find an alternative dining spot (try Cocola near the entrance across from Williams Sonoma).  Sandwich turned out to be BORING - plus they charged me the price of the most expensive sandwich.  I've written to Nordstroms who promised to send me a response - that was 2 weeks ago.  Won't be returning until they add more vegetarian options.  How difficult can this be?  I can't imagine we're the only ones out there....", "author": "Will L."}
