I asked for a specific piece and he acted like he couldn't hear me. He barely warmed it up for me. I am such a pizza lover and was starving yet this was absolutely disappointing. And why is it 4 dollars for a tiny piece of cheese pizza?\nAn ALARMING note. Server came by with whatever dirty water, owner touch it and did NoT wash his hands before taking my box and placing my pizza in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-24", "description": "Came here via the Yelp Elite event and was quite happy to find a decent pizza place since I've moved out here!  Came back afterwards to see how they did without the special Yelp event treatment and still was happy!\n\nPizza slices range from $3.25 to $4.50.  Before you jump the gun and be all \"I can get a $1 slice pizza\", this isn't your typical super thin triangle pizza.  When I say these slices are big, I mean they are HUGE for the price you are paying.  I could have easily been full with just one slice of cheese pizza, but I got two as part of the Yelp event.\n\nI base my pizza reviews mainly off of the simplest pizza - the cheese pizza - b/c there's no point in eating something with tons of condiments if you can't even get the most basic pizza down.  I must say that I was pretty satisfied with it- crust was thick enough that you can pick it up without it flopping over (if it's not too hot out of the oven), and not too much cheese that you would enter a food coma.  Thankfully not too much grease either- sometimes I find myself dabbing my slices with a napkin but this time I didn't really need to do it.  I also had a slice of their Hawaiian pizza- I liked how the pineapple chunks were small/ plentiful enough that you didn't have to tear through a piece/ awkwardly drag it off the slice when you bit into it but there was enough to give it a sweetness to cut the saltiness from the bacon and ham.  \n\nOne thing to note- the pizza slices are thick so if you are a fork and knife person (like me), it might be a bit thick to cut.  Luckily, the waitress offered to cut my slice into smaller parts, but otherwise I recommend just waiting for it to cool before using your hands (since as I said before, the slices don't get too soggy / become limp).\n\nIf you are out on Polk, craving pizza, and want a bang-for-your-buck, I'd recommend Mustafio's!  Added bonus- if you check in on Yelp, free garlic bread when you order a pie of pizza (need to check this out eventually).", "author": "Audrey H."}

Such a great guys and you can see that they really do care about their customer, by always updating their menu every week to months. They told me that they will have a siracha and white sauce with seafood flavor in the next month. So I will look forward to trying those next time. \n\nBut this time I got the combo (I know I'm basic) and their pesto chicken (I believe) and they were really good, love the pesto chicken flavor more. He recommended that flavor to me and I'm glad he did. I really want to try the pineapple aka Hawaiian one next time. Oh and let me just say that I love pizza spots that make their pizza in a rectangle shape with less crust. Truly get then whole pizza with the flavor and not the crust, so you get your money's worth. Also they have a check in offer with free garlic bread which is pretty darn cool.\n\nOverall a great pizza spot that deserves to have more support because if you just talk to the manager there you will see how great of a person he is and how much he really cares about each of his customer. And he really appreciate any and all the feedback that are given to help improve his restaurant.", "author": "Christopher G."}

Open till 2am. This place gets a lot of attention from an intoxicated reviewer. \n\nFast pizza usually means greasy and gross. Whenever I get pizza this fast I'm typically wary of taste and worried of loss in flavor. They used an oven to reheat my two large pre-made slices. Instantly I had high school flashbacks of large sheet style pizza rolling through a toaster oven to produce a pitiful portion of saucy cheesy bread with toppings.  \n\nThank goodness this wasn't the case. This pizza is prepared diligently prior to its reheat.  In the ingredients compilation is where you will taste the difference in this place and other chain pizza joints.    My chicken pizza slice was raft with spinach , cheese and white sauce buried one below another and did not at any bite feel lacking in ingredients. I did prefer the chicken pizza to the pineapple pepperoni. The red sauce has a lot more twang, very Italiany and well balanced with salty meats.

The slices are the size of a 4\u00d76 picture. Let me give you a snapshot of my quick dining experience at Mustafio. As I approached the restaurant, I looked through the glass window and gazed at the selection of hot and ready slices. They offered the basic slices such as cheese, pepperoni, and  Hawaiian. Why be basic, when you could be gourmet? Of course i opted for the Veggie Pesto. The pesto was fresh, packed with flavor and generously slathered under the layer of gooey cheese. Then topped with slices of tomato. What really stood out in this masterpiece was the crunchy crust. I really enjoyed the contrast of the crunch and the soft texture of the cheese with all its fixings. \n\nWould i come back?! Yes, If I'm in the area you bet I am.", "author": "Briana H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-18", "description": "Overview:\nVery greasy - yet flavorful - pepperoni pizza by the slice. A box will cost an extra .35 and well worth it to absorb all the grease. When I first opened my pizza box and saw all the grease absorbed into the cardboard I had a knee jerk reaction -- and the reaction wasn't a positive one.\n\nAmbiance:\nCool vibe inside. Great seating. Friendly workers create a warm and welcoming space.\n\nMy advice to you:\nOrder plain cheese. I have suspicion the grease was mostly from pepperoni.... Right as you get it place a few napkins on top and bottom - a  real pizza eating sin according to my Italian friend... something I've never done before because of growing up with my Italian friend.\n\nAbout me:\nI was perfectly sober like a Mormon when eating this pizza. Also, I've had the best pizza in the city - Tonys, Mozzeria, Firetrail, & Golden Boy. I've easly become a pizza snob as a result. Also if anything is really good I become price insensitive.\n\nConclusion:\nPerhaps if i was really drunk - lets face it... this place caters to the late night bar crowds.... I would have loved it. Will do my best to come back and re order and try a more plain pizza slice... and update this review... If I had ordered a  plain cheese I would guess I would have rated this much higher - keep that in mind in consideration of my review.", "author": "Stefan T."}

After my initial review, he contacted me via Yelp and offered to deliver for FREE the same order with an additional strawberry cheesecake! And not only did he follow through, he delivered the pizza himself personally! So rare that an owner takes such matters into their own hands and customer reviews seriously. He was so apologetic and friendly! \n\nThe pizza delivered was the correct pizza this time, however maybe because I am in favor of  thin pizzas (and granted margarita and pesto pizzas are normally on flat breads) it just seemed to lack something. All the other reviews were of meaty, cheesy pizzas, so perhaps those are the more signature dishes. Will be back to give them a chance!", "author": "Michelle C."}

We were on our way to the Tamia concert at the Regency and were thrilled to see we could grab a slice of pizza before heading to the venue.\n\nWhat caught my attention was the delicious looking pizza that was displayed at the front window. Going in, it looked like there were a few customers enjoying their pizza whilst sitting on bar stools. It's a small place with a few chairs, so they can't really accommodate too many people.\n\nAnyhoo, the pizza I chose was the vegetarian pesto slice. It had pesto, tomatoes, and feta cheese as well as the obvi cheese and sauce and it set me back $4.75. For $5 I would think they'd include a drink with the purchase, but because the pizza is so good, I'll let it slide and still give them 5 stars. The crust was probably my favorite part. With each bite, it had the perfect combination of crunch and chewiness from the pizza. The tomatoes were very flavorful and the feta cheese wasn't overpowering. I also appreciated the fact that it was a square slice = basic geometry = triangle slice (less pizza) = rectangular slice (more pizza)\n\nHighly recommend, I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

I guess cos I moved down to the SOMA. And then lately I was looking for a new pizza delivery option and found this place again. Glad I did! \n\nOrdered last night on 9/15/15 on GrubHub.Here's my review.... First the delivery person was cool. Quick and painless transaction. Second the food is really really awesome. IMO there aren't very many good pizza options in SF,and places in the TL are usually terrible imo.And just SF in general is notorious for having really bad pizza. Don't get me wrong though,I'm a native,and I even admit that alot of SF pizza really isn't that good. But then there's this place.... Not the most epic pizza I've ever tasted but pretty good for SF. \n\nLove the square pizza slices!!!!!! Highly recommend them. I had pepperoni and a Hawaiian slice and they both rocked. The cheese and the sauce tasted pretty good. The cheese didn't have a funky smell and that's a huge plus.\n\nAlso ordered the Pepper Chicken Sub sandwich. It was really really good. Still got leftovers in the fridge. Plus they carry those rare Fanta sodas!!!!!!\n\nNow for the best part,their desserts. OMG please try the red velvet cake! It got me so stuffed I ended up sleeping pretty good last night. I will revisit them again for sure.", "author": "Isabella A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "description": "I've been sort of paying half-attention lately as I passed this stretch of Polk Street on my daily commute down to Civic Center.  After noticing the sign a few times over the past couple of weeks, I walked by last Monday to find that Mustafio's has finally opened.  The store-front is very bright and inviting, revealing pizza in the window and a nice counter and table area to stop and grab a slice.\n\nWhy You Want to Stop In and Give it a Try:  Nice Ownership.  The service here could not be friendlier or more welcoming.  It's a nice spot to grab a slice.  There's no gimmick or particularly upscale element to the place - it's finished with a nice wood counter, wood high-tops and stools, and pizza in the window (a la Golden Boy - although the windows don't open.  And, I'm not comparing the quality to Golden Boy).  It's a nice addition to the block, and gives a less \"grimey\" option to pick up a slice after an evening of Polk Street reveling.  \n\nThe pizza itself is solid, if nothing revolutionary - although, pizza is not necessarily something that needs to be reinvented.  This is standard by-the-slice pizzeria fare - maybe the one deviation is that the slices are rectangle cut, rather than traditional.  The crust is relatively soft and chewy - not doughy.  I'm a fan of the sauce - which is sweeter than some.  I think it's really good with the cheese blend they use.  I also tried a slice of pepperoni and sausage, and I liked the fact that they make it so the pepperoni gets pretty crisp.  I believe they are still finalizing the menu, but they have a veggie combo that I have not tried and the owner tells me it's pretty good - he uses roasted red peppers.  (Picture below)\n\nOverall - a big chunk of the four stars goes to the service and the environment.  If you're in the neighborhood, come in and say hi.  They do offer free delivery, which is a nice bonus.\n\nWelcome to the Neighborhood, Mustafio's!", "author": "Adam S."}

I cant stand the taste of Coke, so I didnt take the cans and went without soda. Friday night pizza with no Soda??  I made due...\n\nLet's forget the fact that I was charged $1.00 for each topping on HALF of a medium pizza...including $1 each for onions and green peppers. \nI ordered half a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onions, green peppers and olives...that's right folks.  $6 for 6 toppings on HALF a pizza....But I knew it going in. \n\nWhat I got was two mistakes. ONE is pure blasphemous and was the straw that broke the camels back on whether I would write a review or not.  \nFIRST mistake was there was no sausage on it. None.  They just forgot.

This was that preformed turkey crap that uses coloring to make the bacon strip marks.  What kind of masochist does this to someone who orders BACON?????  \n\nBased on the fake bacon, I wont be ordering from them again.

The slice prices all varied depending on the type of pizza. It ranged from $3-$5. I bought a sausage/pepperoni for me and a chicken pesto for my BF. The total came out to about $9. which wasn't too pricey for me and I wasn't complaining b/c I just wanted to it. The slices come in rectangles instead of triangles and it's bigger than my hand. The crust and pizza was really yummy and it totally satisfied me. This place is open late for all the bar hoppers and it's a totally smart idea. Great place to go when you have the drunchies!", "author": "Sofia A."}

Fine. The staff was not even remotely polite or gracious, nor did they make any menu suggestions to meet the minimum from my order.

The staff didn't offer plates or utensils, nor did they express any gratitude that we literally doubled our order. \n\nThe pizza itself was borderline un-eatable: greasy, lacking seasoning, and questionably cooked meat.

As a New Jersey native I was somewhat wary about trying anything when it came to California pizza. I scoured yelp and postmates for something open at 1am when I came in and was lucky enough to come upon Mustafios. We ordered a combo pie. Within 40 minutes our pie was at the front door, warm, smelling like afternoon delight on a sunny beach. Me and my significant other devoured the pie, and it was glorious. Yes, its not traditional and the slices are in these awkward long cube pieces, yes the crust has something to be desired, but honestly the pizza is completely worth it at the price point.  The combo is loaded with toppings, and these toppings are like starter, mvp, hall of fame quality toppings; the mushrooms actually taste like they spent some time ordering them. Since that first encounter I have ordered from Mustafio's \"delivery\" 3 times. Each time I have been completely satisfied with the timeliness of the delivery and the quality of the food received; it should also be noted that during two of these instances I had no whiskey to drink at all. Ultimately my main take away is this: A decent pie ad a good price at any level of inebriation. Cheers.", "author": "Justin S."}
