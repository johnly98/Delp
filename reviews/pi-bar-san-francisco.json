I just moved to the neighborhood and wanted to try out Pi, since it's the sort of \"pizza by the slice\" bar you see commonly in Chicago and New York. I was pretty disappointed in what I received. The pizza slice had been reheated but the crust was too hard and dry, and the hard crunchiness of it overpowered the rest of the pizza. Sauce was pretty light on the slice too, so in my opinion a lot of flavor was lacking.\n\nAfter four years of searching, I guess there really isn't a great pizza place in San Francisco at all.", "author": "Sean H."}

The beer list was impressive, but the food was immensely disappointing. \n\nWe ordered a death by mushroom, which we found really light on flavor. Think low-sodium cream of mushroom soup on a pizza crust. The crust itself was just ok: thin but dense. Disappointing given the lengthy description of their crust on the menu.  Reminded of a DiGiorno or something else from the freezer aisle. \n\nThe reason I felt driven to write this review, though, was the Caeser salad. I know this sounds hyperbolic, but it's not: I have never regretted ordering something more. For $15 you get lettuce that clearly comes from a bag, apparently mass-produced croutons, mediocre cheese, and a dressing that I never would have identified as Caeser. It was gross. We could barely eat any of it, and although the waitress/bartender noticed that we hardly touched it when she took away our plates, she didn't ask us about it. I know this is a lot of words dedicated to a terrible salad at a pizza place, but I want to impart how offensively bad and overpriced this thing was. I really hope they put some more effort in or cut the price in half.", "author": "Andrew B."}

We ordered a round of beers and two giant pizzas to share (large white pie, large mushroom pie). The beers were pretty good! Some nice IPAs, Ambers, etc. A bunch of my friends got the Petit Diablontin which is a sour and wasn't too bad either. \n\nThe pizza took some time to come out despite not being super busy but it was tasty! The pizza was huge and the crust is SUPER thin--I think the mushroom one could've used a little more flavor in the mushroom sauce or something but otherwise it wasn't bad. Two pizzas was enough for the 8 of us but we also weren't super hungry so we barely finished.\n\nOverall, a nice little place to check out but the pizza wasn't extraordinary.

I headed to Pi Bar for the first night of Hannukah as they were pouring He'brew's Jewbelation 14 (which is absolutely delicious by the way). They're dedication to bringing in quality draft beers is really apparent as Jewbelation was just one of many fantastic brews on tap that night. \n\nSo impressed by the beer selection we decided we had to try the pizza and ordered up the Death by Mushrooms. This pizza has so much potential has it mixes portebellos with Moonlight Brewing Co's Death & Taxes Beer. I'll give it to them, the toppings (mushrooms) were pretty good, unfortunately the crust on this pizza was awful, thin and bland, it's crust like this that gives California pizza a bad name, I really wished they had made a better crust because it could've been so much more.\n\nOverall, 4 stars for the beer selection,  2 star for the pizza leaves us at a 3 star review.

Decor is strictly dive: ceramic tile floor, oak bar, and too-bright track lighting.\n\nThe menu is simple--a few salads, a few pre-configured pizzas, and a list of ingredients with which to create your own pi ... er, pie.  Slightly over-dressed, the spinach salad with toy box tomatoes ($10) delicately balanced the saltiness of a sprinkling of feta with the rich smokiness of copious amounts of housemade Italian sausage.  Delicious, the polenta \"fries\" ($5) disappeared all too quickly.\n\nSomewhere between wood fired thin crust and Chicago deep dish, the pizza at Pi Bar is undistinguished. While made with quality Guisto's unbleached organic flour, Pi's crust is medium thick--neither crispy, nor soggy, neither delicious, nor cardboard-like. Better than Domino's and Extreme, Pi's pie pales in comparison to Pizzeria Delfina or Tony's.\n\nFriendly and attentive, service was better than one would expect in a neighborhood bar-come-pizza-joint. With more than 12 craft beers on tap and a reasonable selection of wines by the glass, patrons have sufficient selections to wash down their pie.\n \nAny place that bases its existence on a geeky double entendre (pi the irrational number and pie for the pizza) deserves kudos for wittiness.

Along with comedy, bad accents, and bagels, pizza is one of the things that NY unequivocally produces better than California does. (On the plus side, California lacks Staten Island, JFK, and service people who could all be taught a lesson in courtesy by the DMV). \n\nThe pizza came very close to real NY pizza. I was impressed by what I could see of the process as the chef shoveled thin crust pizzas into the pizza oven. My only disappointment was that the crust had gotten a tiny bit soggy in the middle--it came so close to real NY pizza with its thin but chewy crust that remains crisp on the very bottom. But I would definitely be willing to come to Pi Bar to try again.  A healthier salad selection would also be nice.\n\nPi Bar's weakest point is the atmosphere. I'm not sure that it quite knows what it wants to be. It looks like a bar and feels like a bar; the pizza seems almost like a not-totally integrated side business. Pizza joints are usually slightly loud, warm, fun places that invite large groups and families. We went on a Monday night, so it might have just been slow, but with the dark (if attractive) bar decor, Pi Bar lacked that inviting quality.

Pi Bar is close to getting boycotted. \n\nA brief background: \nPapalote gives you 4 ounce water cups. They have larger cups available, but they won't give them to you. The problem I have here is Papalote's intention. They don't want you to fill up on free water -- they want to make you thirsty. They intentionally make it hard to satisfy your thirst without buying a drink. I think this is ridiculous, and a bad business philosophy, so.. boycott. \n\nPizza Di Mano gave away a coupon that advertised a pizza and a soda for a certain price. When you went to use it, they charged you a higher price, without telling you why. When we asked why, they told us that they can charge whatever they want, regardless of what the coupon says. I think this is lying. So .. boycott. \n\nNow to Pi Bar. I think they are liars. Last night we went with a group of 5 to have pizza and beers. We orders 5 pretzels, 1 large pie (pi?), and a white slice with bacon. (We had debated getting a white pie, but white pizza gets boring after a bite or two.) Plus, white pie was there Wednesday night special -- \"White pie slice, $3.14. Toppings 25 cents.\" Fast forward to the bill. We get the bill for $138, which included a 20% tip, and find three lines of charges for the white slice: Slice Cheese Pizza: $3.14, White Pie: $0.25, Bacon: $0.25. So, they overcharged use 25 cents, right? Well, when we went to pay for our bill, we asked them about the 25 cents. \n\nA quick side note: I know it's only 25 cents. We can afford 25 cents. Each persons portion of the bill was $28, so the 25 cents would have made it a nickel cheaper. It's the principal -- they added something to the bill that shouldn't have been there. \n\nSo, their response: \"That's just how we write it.\" Huh? No, I'm sorry, we'll take that off. No, I'm sorry, that's the only way we can punch it into our computer systems. Instead we get them essentially saying, \"Oh, we just lie to you about the price of a white slice.

It's in the center of the room, fun and there's plenty of space for a large pie and drinks without feeling at all crowded.  Great view of the kitchen and the chef tossing the dough for the pizzas. We started with a drink, I had the Lost Coast Great White lager and my partner the Ace Pear Cider.  Both excellent.\n\nWhen I go to a new pizza place I like to start by ordering a basic cheese pizza. Sort of my baseline measure.  As above, a perfectly blistered, thin, NYstyle pizza.  The herbs and crushed red pepper that come with it are fresh herbs, a nice touch!  Small was more than enough for two.\n\nAnd there 's still room for dessert. I ordered the \"rainbow cookies'. . .sort of domino sized slices of cake in three colors (think Italian flag) with raspberry filling between the layers, glazed with chocolate.  The bartender, Jennifer, was a total star, and \"gifted\" us with a glass of dessert wine to go with the cookies.

And while I do purchase whole grain stuff in my home, I am no elitist when it comes to the white flour typically used in pizza dough.  The reason is simple: I love pizza!  I really, really love it.  My boyfriend does too, and for a while it seemed like we were headed into dangerous body balance territory with how often we were making pizza a part of our diet.\n\nSo we joined a gym and agreed we'd only have pizza once a week: hello, Pizza Sundays!  Our rating system, varying from Yelp's 5 star practice, is the 6 slice matrix--6 slices being amazing, never been better, trickling down to 1 slice, as in \"why did I buy this when I could have ordered Domino's.\"  I think we can generally agree that that is a bad decision, in case I'm not being clear.\n\nTonight, we went to Pi for the first time and on our rating system, this place deserves a 4.75: excellent overall, with a few very minor complaints.  Pi has great service--warm, friendly staff who know their products and can make recommendations without being pushy.  The house-made pretzel with Sierra Nevada mustard was delicious, though slightly over-baked, and the mixed green salad was very nice and not drowned in dressing, which I appreciate.  Their beer selection is unique and varied, plus the tasting glasses are adorable little beer steins, just enough for two swallows, which is perfect.\n\nAnd the pizza itself--well, it was very good.  While I'm a fan of a more sauce-driven pie (a la Little Star), I recognize that Pi is doing something different and they're doing it well.  The spicy peppers and olives was a great combo, and the small was a perfect size for two people (6 slices).  We watched another couple receive their large and balk at the giant pie in front of them.\n\nAll in all, Pi deserves a round of applause for the ambiance of the place, the great service, the soundtrack, and the food.  I highly recommend it as a Pizza Destination.  Coming from us, that's saying something.", "author": "Ciara W."}

Bartenders are friendly and the beer selection is pretty damn good (check out the unique Belgiums in the cooler). They always have a great selection of entirely local beers including unique brews i.e. you won't get bored with only Lagunitas IPA and Anchor Steam as craft options (as great as they are they are too common). They also make some amazing pizza exactly the way I like it with thin crust and the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce NY style. For the light snacker I would recommend the homemade soft pretzel with Sierra Nevada mustard, only $1.50. Only issue with Pi Bar is that a lot of people dine here like a restaurant with big parties and kids. Thats OK but for me its more so a bar than restaurant.", "author": "Cori W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-28", "description": "In short, Pi bar has the following things to truly recommend it:\n\nGreat beer selection, with tons of stuff in bottle, and a nice selection on tap.\nPolenta fries (served with marinara sauce) - totally unusual, but fun and certainly tasty.\nWarm spinach salad with house-made sausage, toybox tomatoes, and feta.  Really, really f'ing good.  The sausage (ground into little bits, not large chunks or slices) has a fascinating smokiness to it which really enhances the salad.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is even better than bacon bits on salad.\n\nThose were the best.\nThe meatball sandwich was also good - the fresh basil leaves were a nice touch, and the meatballs were tender and flavorful.  It would have been nice if it had a bit more sauce, but was a tasty sandwich that I'd be happy to get again; it just wasn't quite as spectacular as the 2 items above.\n\nThe meh:\nPizza slice - the source slice (which they add toppings to and toss back in the oven to reheat) had clearly been sitting out for a while.  This was probably because we were there before they switch over to slices only (11pm) on an off-night, so there weren't many people eating slices.  This means your slices are going to be sitting around for a while.\nSo if you're into slices, I'd recommend going when it's a more crowded & popular time for slice-consuming to get fresher.\n\nI have yet to try the fresh pizza, so can't comment on that.\n\nThey do have coat hooks under the bar, which is nice.  Also, I was enjoying the 70s rock soundtrack.", "author": "Don H."}

I felt I couldn't give four, but it is better than three.\n\n   First of all, fantastic beer selection, as everyone else has noticed.  I was there around the time of the 30th anniversary of Sierra Nevada Brewing, and they had some fantastic specialty beers.  I had the \"Brewer's Reserve\", which is a delightful blend of their Bigfoot Barley Wine and the Celebration Ale.  Yum!\n\n   I ordered a simple salad, the anchovy side, and a slice.  What  amazed me was how fast they turned to order around... within about 5 minutes I had everything.  \n\n  Thus the -.5 stars.  No one wants everything at once.  I expected a lesiurely snack on some anchovies (quite good), a bite of salad or two (a bit heavily dressed and too acidic, but fresh and still pretty good), and then finish up with my slice (basalmic onion, sausage, kalamata olive, good crust) over a second beer.  \n\n  But, instead, everything was piled up in front of me at the same time.

It must be all the dark wood and dark beers and mirrors and melting cheese smell.  I had a great date here with my BF when we came in for the 3:14-6:28 HH special: $6 for thin crust pizza and a strong beer on tap which was just our style.  I liked this place too because I don't think it necessarily has a Mission feel- it's like a Nor Cal/So Cal/ Mission/North Beach/PB/OB type of joint.\n\nWe sat at the bar and chopped it up with the nice bartender who gave us our space but came back when we needed more pizza or a refill. Pizza comes standard cheese slice and you order toppings for more $.  My BF got the pepperoni and it was overflowing.  I got olives and it came with about 4 halves of green olives.  Interesting, no?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-16", "description": "First, the non-pizza parts. There are a fair number of draft beers offered, and our waitress was very friendly and patient. The appetizers are oddly expensive and not bad, but not worth it. The fried mozzarella was $10 for maybe 8 pretty small cheese nuggets fried, sitting in red sauce. They were fine but nothing special. Similarly, the garlic pinwheels just seemed to be bread twirled and garlicked up. At 3 for $5 (and maybe slightly larger than a silver dollar), they weren't worth it either. The rainbow cookie was surprisingly better and quite decadent.  Our waitress cut the $4 dessert (more cake- than cookie-like) into 6 pieces, which worked pretty well for everyone.\n\nNow, the pizza. I will say up front that, while I like all types of pizza, New York style is definitely my least favorite, so I'm not a connoisseur. Having said that, the cheese was not good quality, there was really almost no sauce, and the crust was not bad, but not too distinctive, and it was a bit burned. Upon request we were given parmesan cheese, and a little dish of oregano was brought with the pizza. Both helped, but I'd like the pizza to be able to stand by itself. The place had a nice overall vibe, but I wouldn't have the pizza (or appetizers) again.", "author": "Lisa K."}

It took a pretty long time to order drinks at the bar, despite the place being pretty empty, and though the waitress didn't rush us (we sat at our table for four hours), she assured my friend that her order did not contain the ingredient that she is allergic too, and then told her that on second thought, it actually might, after she had already brought it to the table.\n\nVerdict: come for great beer.

Above average craft brew selection including Russian River Supplication and Blind Pig, Marin Brewing Tripel Dipsea and Porter and a few other selections.  \n\nPersonally I thought the pizza was great.  Pizza is kind of like BBQ in that if you're from some area that specializes in it, everything else will be crap.  This is better than your run of the mill pizza spot, nothing fancy like Delfina or Little Star, but easy, simple, fresh and not even close to being the bathtub of grease some places can be.  My friend and I got a large with a few meats and peppers and we enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nThat said, the unfortunate part comes in that yes, this place seems to cater to the family and Marina types which I think kind of ruins how awesome this place could be.  If you're lucky enough to come early and snag a spot at the bar, the kid factor is easily less annoying but I do agree that this can be a deterrent for future visits.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed coming here and will look to pick my times to come back and avoid the family/Marina scene... or at least get trashed before having to deal with it.", "author": "Steven R."}

Here's the breakdown:\n\nService:  lovely, attentive (to both drinks and food)\n\nFood:  not too shabby-- I'd agree that the crust is a tad thick for my liking, but it happens to taste very good so they can get away with it.

The size of the large is HUGE (we're big eaters, had 2 slices each and will have the other half tonight for dinner).\n\nPrice:  eh, I don't think this is Pi Bar's fault but I still have issue paying like, $30+ dollars for a pizza.

Basically there is always one of every major kind of beer on tap, and they are usually excellent choices from microbreweries both near and far. Any place that bothers to get Allagash White on tap will have repeat visits from me. Their selection changes regularly, though, so if they have something you like, drink up!\n\nOf the food, I have had the pizza and the warm spinach salad, and both were excellent.

And the beer list is their one redeeming quality.\n\nLet's talk about the sorry excuse of a wait staff...We were there on a Tuesday rainy night.  There were 20 people there tops including our party of 6, ethnically diverse, and smoking hot women (we were a walking United Colors of Benetton ad, only hotter).  \n\nThe waitress (there were two of them)  both really interchangeable because there wasn't anything memorable about their personality nor face...could not be bothered to take our order of drinks and food...Hello Genius!  We were a large party and pretty sure looked like we were gonna spend the most money in that dump for that night so when we order a bottle and beers and food...You don't need to leave every 5 seconds after one of us orders something.  You don't piecemeal orders.  I mean what can the other dull face waitress say that would be so interesting that you had to rush by her side to hear?  \n\nThe crown of AWESOME service at Pi Bar has got to be that after they gave us our checks and we have tipped well...Dull waitress #1 came to our table to shut us up with this gem...\"I am glad you are having fun, but can you keep it down?\"  Now granted, we were pretty opinionated and we were having a good 'ol time...laughing up a storm...AND laughing loudly.  OOOHHH sorry, apparently at Pi Bar you are NOT allowed to guffaw a hearty, shrieking laugh.  God forbid these hipsters, sad wanna be waitresses learn to laugh and act silly in the middle of wearing their \"way-too-tight\" for their figure jeans.  Did it make her feel bigger to try to shut us up in front of her bearded regular crush?  Puhleaseee.  If you didn't want to listen...move away from our table...but generally speaking, sometimes when you are in a bar...People laugh loudly.  Is that news to you guys?  Mission people laugh too, you know?\n\nDo yourself a favor, Pi Bar, get rid of these wait staff that take themselves waaaayyy too seriously.  You perhaps can benefit from someone who listens to Britney once a awhile with tack and know how to smile.  Better yet, I am just learning how to box, and I would love to spend 3 rounds in the ring with your wait staff :)  You really can benefit from better staff--1.)  that knows your beer 2.)  that knows the wine you carry 3.)  that have common courtesy.\n\nUntil then, you've lost our business.", "author": "Katrina N."}

I don't personally like places where you have to yell to be heard from 6 inches away.  I also don't like restaurants that don't have any culinary vision.  All the pizzas are \"build your own\" - which is a nice option, but I prefer to have suggestions on the menu - at the very least to indicate that they know what they think pizza should taste like.  \n\nThe pizza tasted fine, and does and adequate job mimicking \"New York Style\" thin crust.  It's on par with Arinelle's but the crust is far inferior to Delfina (it's all crispy and no chewy).  We got half of our pizza plain to see how they master the basic, and interestingly, the side that was plain was covered in pools of grease that dripped everywhere when you picked up a slice.  I have never been, and hope never to be a pizza blotter, but I was pretty tempted here.  I'm no prospector, but forget offshore, set up your drill on a slice of Pi.  Usually, I bemoan impotent pizza (when the tip can't stand up to the weight of the pizza and droops) because it's overladen with toppings - in this case, it seemed just to be grease causing the soggy tip.\n\nI also take issue with the identity crisis of sorts that this place experiences.  The beers are fancy and expensive, complete with matching glasses, the music is so loud that you expect a dance floor, and yet uniformed wait staff is serving up what are essentially street slices at candle lit tables.  The mismatched plates are reminiscent of a mom and pop Italian restaurant, but the rest of the decor is minimal and bar like.  \n\nI'd probably eat the pizza there again (provided there is no wait), but wouldn't go out of my way.  As an establishment, I find Pi to be confused and unfocused, but maybe that's intentional and I just don't get it.

Fortunately, the situation has dramatically improved in the past 14 years, and now the Mission, formerly a desert of pizza sadness and abandonment, has become perhaps the best part of town to forage for a good pie.\n\nSo of course I'd been thoroughly looking forward to visiting this place Pi Bar: oh boy! Allegedly good pizza, closer to where I live than the other influx of recent (and generally awesome) pizza arrivals in the Mission. And with good beer, too? Sign me up!\n\nMy first disappointment was with the atmosphere of the place. It's a large space, painted a putrid ochre colour that's hard on the eyes. With the carpets and wall hangings that the predecessor tenant Suriya used to damp echoes all replaced by hard surfaces, the place is noisy and jangly to the nerves.\n\nAlso, that indefinable something in a place's atmosphere? In this case, that special numinous quality is completely absent, and the place feels like it would fit well into a mall in a small town outside Boston (having been to such places).\n\nThe service, on the other hand, was good: thoroughly friendly, attentive, quick, and professional. I was definitely happy on that front.\n\nThe selection and quality of beers was decent, but not in any way spectacular: it's not at all out of line for the Mission, and wouldn't hold a candle to any self-respecting bar in Portland. So while I was pleased with the drinks, don't buy the hype that Pi's beer selection is above average.\n\nAnd now on to the pizza, which was a solid disappointment. They have two sizes, huge (15\") and ridiculous (20\"), which means you really need a party of two starving people to make much progress on even the 15\". And the actual quality of the pizza was absolutely mediocre: not in any way a step up from some hole-in-the-wall by-the-slice joint (actually worse than some), and no threat to the new pizza hotness represented by Beretta or Pizzetta 211. The crust was chewy and soggy, the cheese was too heavy, and there wasn't enough sauce.

For about 1/30 the price, I'd have to say that even Katz's or Arinell's pizza is about 10 times better - and frankly, for this price, the pizza better be creative and artisanal.

For less than $25, we had three delicious slices and three beers per the happy hour special. The slices were not mythical, but totally delicious. The beer selection is excellent and has a number of seldom-seen items and great variety. The service was friendly, fast and attentive. The crowd was diverse - a neighborhood guy in his 60s reading the Financial Times, hipsters, families with young children. Everyone seemed welcome.\n\nI had a great time and fully expect to put Pi in the regular rotation. Two quick suggestions - perhaps add some sound dampeners as it did get really loud, and maybe adjust the tables across from the bar to fit in a bit more seating. Otherwise, a great addition to the neighborhood!\n\nP.S.  It's across the street from Anthony's Cookies, so save room.", "author": "Valerie W."}

I put our names down on the list and was pleased to see that there weren't TOO many people in front of us.  We hung out at the bar and waited for our table, declining the bartender's offer to eat at the bar, since it appeared that we would be able to get a table without too long of a wait.  After about 10 minutes, I noticed that 3 tables had opened up.  Since we were the third party on the list, I assumed that meant that we were up.\n\nWe gave up our place at the bar and made our way to the front of the restaurant.  The bartender/host (the same one who had earlier asked us if we wanted to eat at the bar) seated the two parties of two in front of us at two-person tables.  He then proceeded to completely ignore us and go back to the bar.  No explanation.  No eye contact.  We thought that maybe he just really needed to do something at the bar, but no.  Completely ignored us.  Mind you, there was a table sitting unoccupied and clean and there was NOBODY behind us in line.  Sure it was a table for 4, but there was NOBODY else who was waiting for a table.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, a group of 3 came in.  The bartender/host came to the front of the restaurant, still completely ignoring us and refusing to make eye contact, and asked them if they had another person in their group, ready to give them that table for 4.  They stated that they did not, so he asked them if they would like to sit at the bar and eat there.  They then went to where we had been sitting at the bar and took those seats.  It would have been GREAT if the rude bartender/host had actually told us that their policy was to not seat parties of 2 at a table for 4 so we could have taken those seats and started our meal.  But no, still no eye contact.\n\nAnother 10 minutes passed.  We had now just been standing for 20 minutes at the front of the restaurant and noticed to our dismay that all of the tables for two had JUST been seated.  At this rate, it was going to be awhile.  I was fuming.  The bartender/host walked past us again (yep, STILL no eye contact or acknowledgment of our existence), and finally my brother tapped him and asked if we could just be seated there since there was NOBODY behind us in line.  He explained that their policy was to not seat parties of two at 4-person tables.  Ok, I understand if they're busy, but I cannot reiterate enough how ridiculous it was considering we were the ONLY ones waiting!  Also, parties of two are MUCH more likely to cruise in to a restaurant looking for a table on a Friday night than parties of 4!  \n\nFINALLY, a little over 1/2 an hour after we got there, we were seated at the table for 4.  Please note that at no point during our meal did a party of 4 come in looking for a table.\n\nThe food itself was quite good, though the kitchen dropped our pizza at some point and had to remake it.  They compensated us with free refills on our wine.  But what was supposed to be a short dinner ended up being QUITE long and frustrating.  \n\nThough I really enjoyed the food (we got a cheese pizza with roasted peppers, balsamic onions, and portabello mushrooms - QUITE tasty), I don't think I will be coming back for awhile.  I cannot believe a place can stay open for business when the host is so rude that he won't even make eye contact with the customers or give any kind of explanation about why they can't have an OPEN table when nobody else is around.", "author": "Julie S."}

They had nothing bad to say about it, but I think this place doesn't hold a candle to what was easy to get many places when I lived in NY.  If you're pizza-hungry in san francisco, search hard and expect disappointment.  \n\nLet me start with the good:\n\n-Sauce had more flavor and spice than the usual around here.  (That's always my #1 complaint... a lot of places do it like spaghetti sauce - uggh, ew, sweet.)  Decent but not great.\n\n-Crust wasn't over-doughy or soggy, and earned points from my friends compared to other local places I haven't been.\n\n-Cheese was a reasonable amount.\n\n-Portabella mushroom topping was well prepared.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-Cheese was dry and plastic-y.  That sheen of grease you get on a good, cheesy (even cheap and generic) pizza might be too much for you, but go ahead and blot it if so.  I love it... and it should bubble together with the sauce.  Of course, we did have takeout and waited to eat, so it wasn't super warm when we did.  It would be better straight from the oven, but I love a good pizza even when it's cold, and this failed to impress.   \n\n-Crust was tasteless, dry and cracker-y.  Nice try for thin NY style, but I NEVER leave the end of crusts, and I couldn't choke this down even with copious beer.\n\n-Sauce did not complement the crust and cheese due to those drawbacks.  You could load in more spice and amount to compensate, but it would be the wrong balance.  \n\nI would like Pi Bar to get a pie from Pavones in Syracuse NY to see how it's done... just to name one random place barely anybody here would know, that doesn't need hype or cost to be great.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/pavones-pizza-syracuse\n\nLocal pizza I liked ok- Uncle Vitos, Little Star, Arinell.", "author": "Pat L."}

We arrived at 9:45pm and there was plenty of room we grabbed seats at the bar and first thing I noticed was the large variety of non-brand name beers and lots of local micro brews. \n\nIt took about 5 minutes for the bartender to take our order and present us with the menu. We scanned the drinks available and made our orders, I got a dark lager called Death & Taxes from Moonlight Brewing. Before ordering I asked about the beverage whether it was heavy or not and the bartender told me it was dark but still a lager and not heavy. Personally I can't remember a dark beer that wasn't heavy but I took her advice and ordered a pint. Voldemort's friend ordered a high alcohol content beverage named \"Monk's Blood\", however it came served in what appeared to be a wine glass and about a third the size of my pint glass. They should put a warning next to the brew stating it comes in a third pint, but they don't list that anywhere and still charge you the normal $5/drink. Overall $5 per drink at a place like this isn't terrible especially because of the selection of micro brews. \n\nVoldemort and I each then ordered a slice of pizza, which based on my quick read through the menu is made using sustainable ingredients or some other sort of green method of agriculture and cooking. The pizza took about 10 mins or so and the slices look large, size is similar to a slice at Escape from New York. I got a Mushroom and Olive and Voldemort got a Pepperoni and Mushroom. Overall I thought the pizza was lacking real taste, texture was similar to Tomatina (Walnut Creek) but really the flavor seemed lost. Voldemort did enjoy her piece however but was unable to finish so I did it for her as that is apparently my role in the home . . . Garbage Disposal cause I'll basically eat anything even if I don't like it. \n\nAfter we completed our meal it took a long time for the bartender to bring us our bill, which displeased Voldemort cause she was anxious to get home to kill Harry Potter! \n\nOnce arriving home I felt terrible, not because of the pizza, but rather the beer that was actually very heavy despite the bartender's comment it was not. I really did feel like Death & Taxes so I can't fault the brewer but the bartender should know the product she's selling. \n\nOverall given the opportunity I would pass on going back to Pi unless I had a reason or a friend guilt trips me into it.", "author": "Mark K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-01", "description": "Maybe my expectations were too high but this was not great pizza - so-so at best. I should mention that I did not eat the pizza at Pi Bar but did take out instead. I will give it one more try, eat-in, in a few weeks to make a fair comparison to other Mission pizzerias. For the details of my take-out experience, read on.\n\nFirst off, their website sucks. It was difficult to find a phone number to call ahead. It should be on every page at the bottom. Their menu doesn't have prices except for a couple of items. Hopefully, both issues will be fixed soon.\n\nWhen I did find the number to order, they asked whether I wanted small or large. It only took 15 minutes to make and pickup from when I ordered so nothing bad there. Pleasantly, once I got to the restaurant, I found the small is actually a 15\" pie. The large is apparently about 25\". The small with two ingredients was $21 so priced just a bit more than most local Mission pizzerias, but not overly so.\n\nThe restaurant itself looked nice though I didn't spend much time there. Spacious and the tables were not packed together. There's a bar area with stools and the beer selection looked good enough to come back for later. Need to try their 2*Pi*R special with a slice and a beer.\n\nThe pizza itself was disappointing. It wasn't terribly warm by the time I got home so I was off to a bad, and maybe unfair, start. The cheese had congealed to the point that I needed a knife to cut a slice off. The crust, though perfectly crunchy on the outer edges, was too thin and soggy in the middle to the point where l had trouble peeling it off the paper. The ingredients were definitely fresh but I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of the cheese.\n\nOverall, I'd say this pizza is a bit better than your random neighborhood pizzeria but definitely not as good as the premier pie places in the Mission (eg, Delfina, Pauline's, etc.). It certainly doesn't compare to good true NY pizzas and is arguably not even as good as Arinell's up the street at 16th and Valencia. It does however get points for having the beer and a great name for a special. I'll try it again and maybe even include it in my regular pizzeria rotation (with lowered expectations), but Pi Bar is nothing special.", "author": "Anand M."}

The crust was complete (no holes) the sauce had flavor and there was ample salt and grease (grease is important to a pizza, particularly NY-style) oozing from the cheese.\n\nSo thats it for the pizza review. I actually went on a \"Strong Beer Night\" during SF's Beer Week.\n\nMy BF and I split the flight of Anchor Steam brews and the meat and cheese pairings. The beer was strong... like the hulk or king kong... some tasty. I wasn't a fan of the Humming (too bitter) or the Bock (too sour and very smoky) but I found the Liberty Ale and the get you drunk without knowing it Barleywine delish.\n\nThe meatballs were aight but not too impressive whereas the sausages were very tasty.  Salty, fatty, full of flavor.\n\nAll in all a good night........ until I went to sleep. I think the bizzar meat and beer flavors combined with my malaria drugs (I just got back from Costa Rica) had a weird chemical reaction. I had the most vivid, intense, nonsensical nightmares ever. 100% not fun. \n\nDreams included: 1. My sister ( I am actually an only child) leaving my Dad to die of AIDS (he HIV negative and the healthiest old guy I know) in Vietnam (he has explicitly told me he has no desire to ever travel in Southeast Asia) because they don't take his Health Insurance. [Can we pass healthcare reform yet? Its effecting my dream.} As a result of my dream-induced sister leaving my Dad in Vietnam I kill her. 2.

Or alternatively, you can order by the slice to go if you're in a hurry.\n\nSince we weren't in a rush, we chose the former route.  Right off the bat, two things impressed me: first, the local selection of beers on tap (as it was one of those rare, warm SF days, we preferred the light, clean Alaskan summer to the somewhat hoppy and fruity Mt. Shasta lager) and second, there was NO WAIT at all for a 6:30 dinner! (it did start getting crowded by the time we left, however).\n\nNot being particularly hungry, we split a small tomato pie w/ italian sausage and roasted peppers (which is plenty for two people, with leftovers).  The pizza was pretty good - really thin and not too crispy.  The toppings were excellent.  I don't know if the pie ranks as high as some of the other pizzas in the city (A16, Beretta, Gialina, Flour & Water) but if you're not in the mood to wait for hours to get seated, this is a great alternative.\n\nFinally, the service was excellent.

Pi Bar is almost unrecognizable from its previous days as Suriya, nice pressed tin ceiling. \n\nThe small pizzas are quite large but they have a thin crust so you can still put away a few slices. Pi Bar is also open to half and half topping combos to maximize tasting opportunities. Our first pie had portabellos and balsalmic onions for the veggies and our second had bacon and parm. It takes a rather bold vegetarian pizza to tear my attention away from a bacon pie, but the mushroom and onion pie was quite tasty. We followed up with a roasted peppers and parm all around, anchovies on half. The crust was thin enough to not feel doughy but with a good chew.

The roasted peppers decent as well.  Maybe I would have been happier if we had gotten a half-and-half pizza-- perfect for all those indecisive people like me!  So overall, the pizza was good, but not as good as I was hoping it to be.  \n\nBesides the okay pizza, let me say that the beer is great.  I had a great belgian beer that I was pretty obsessed with.

What I found was that I loved the thin crispy crust, but being a West-coaster I wasnt impressed with the canned, frozen, rarely fresh toppings, not to mention having to use a pile of napkins to mop up the greasy oil slick floating on the top of my pie - if you dont think that got me dirty looks from the natives ;)\nbut, I digress...\nI have now visited Pi 3 times and am craving a housemade sausage portobello mushroom slice just thinking about it!   Pi is a bi-coastal marriage made in pizza heaven!  My favorite thing is that you get that wonderful \"New York Style\" crust made with a variety of fresh, local, ingredients (organic and sustainable when available) - they also feature local wines, craft beers and soft drinks.  \n\nThey have a great selection of toppings which you can pick and choose to build your custom combo. The meats are top notch as are the veggies... the roasted peppers are so yummy and I dont know what they do to the onions, but they are carmelized to perfection. The sausage and mushroom is my fave... For you special needs types - My housemate has allergies, dairy, vinegar, sulfites... He has to be really picky about ingredients, and no big surprise he went to Pi and they were happy to build him a pizza to meet his dietary needs.  \n\nI really cant say enough about the staff, they are so incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, they are happy to answer questions and are never too busy to chat and make you feel like they really care and are glad you came. Shout out to James and Jen, bartenders extraordinaire! \n\nI am not much of a beer drinker, but I know enough to know what I like and dont like. They are more than patient, they seem genuinely happy to let me try 2, 3, even 4 beers before making my selection. I want to try some just for the funny names, like HeBrew JEWbilation and Speakeasy's prohibition beer. Last night, after 3 tastes I opted for the Blind Pig IPA - YUM! \n\nI try to stay away from the big chains and support the small local businesses whenever possible. I love that Pi supports the local community in their food and beveraging sourcing, so not only do I get to support a local business but I also get to support many of their local suppliers. \n\nAs for the d\u00e9cor, its dark woodsy feel is very relaxing and casual. The music can be a bit loud, but not so loud that you cant carry on a conversation, plus I like the bluesy tracks so turn it up!  Oh, but the best part is that it is walking distance! I have found my \"Cheers!\"\n\nLastly, I just have to respond to some of the criticisms from my fellow yelpers, like the fact that they don't carry imports on draft... can you see how that doesn't fit with the local sourcing concept? You can get an imported beer anywhere, and while I have much love and respect for my fellow reviewers, I have to respectfully dissent on that point.  I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing and certainly don't feel the lack of imports on draft merits a star deduction. Again, local business means local jobs and that local money stays in the community.\n\nThe same goes for the pricing issue... true, the pizza is not cheap, but neither are organic, local and fresh ingredients.  So while it may be slightly more than your average pizza, I am willing to pay a few bucks more for local ingredients and to support my community. Plus, if you are on a budget you can check out the daily Pi \"R\" Square Special - A Single Slice and Beer of the Day is only $6.28!\n\nOk, I'll get off my pizza box now, and perhaps walk down for that slice I'm a cravin'...", "author": "Yolanda I."}

I came to Pi Bar twice this past week because they were sampling two of my favorite breweries, Anderson Valley and Russian River, for SF beer week. I really enjoyed this place's style, before we arrived I was expecting an alright pizza place serving great beer. The place is a little small and doesn't have to much seating but we were able to find a spot at the bar. It took a while to grab the bartender's attention because they were really busy, but once we did they seemed to be really friendly and got us our beers quick. The beers were excellent, poured perfectly and not too overpriced. We decided to check out a menu and ended up ordering slices of sausage and bacon pizza. I was shock when it arrived, I love thin crust New York style pizza and these guys know what's up.

While Little Star is deep dish, and Gialina is more Italian in nature, Pi Bar is New York styled pizza and it is delicious.\n\nWe ordered a large to go pizza a little over a week ago with meatballs and onions and it was terrific.  The perfect combination of crispy crust and gooey cheesiness.  My only complaint was their ridiculously over sized pizza box.  I thought I was going to have to strap it on the hood of my car to get it home.\n\nYesterday on our visit, we ordered a small sausage pizza and pinwheels to start.  Their sauce is very good and it was really highlighted with the Pinwheels.  ext to arrive was our small pizza  -- plenty big enough for the 2 of us to get our fill and still have left overs for today.  Again delicious.\n\nNow for the price, I have no complaints about the pricing here.  2 sodas, a small pizza and a starter and we got out of there for $35.  Not exactly cheap, but this is San Francisco and you will pay that much or more at many other pizza joints so I think the pricing is more than fair.\n\nAll in all, I have decided that this will be my new go to pizza place.

We had been meaning to stop in months before, but their 3:14pm opening time doesn't usually agree with our kidlet's normal naptime.  \n\nWe opted for the Pi \"R\" Square special of a slice of cheese pizza and the beer of the day, a Black Diamond Brewing Company Belgian-styled white ale...all for $6.28.  How can you go wrong?\n\nPi Bar uses local ingredients to put together their rendition of a classic NY-style pizza.  While my only NY-style pizza comparison is Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, I don't think I can make a fair comparison at this time.  The main difference is that we didn't get a whole pie and didn't have it piping hot and fresh from the oven.  Slices tend to be re-heated upon order.  I can say that I did enjoy the crust.  We were told by Richie, one of the owners, that they had tried different types of flour until they felt that they had perfected it.  I gotta say it was perfect.  Who says you have to use 00 or 0 imported flour?  It was light and thin, no doughy texture, and crispy, but not burnt.  The sauce was not overpowering and complemented the crust with just the right amount spread over it.  The cheese balanced it all out, so that not one flavor stood out over the other.  It wasn't a super NY size slice, but it was satisfying for the 2 of us for a snack.   Actually, we thought it was sooooo good that we ended up ordering a 2nd slice with their homemade sausage on top...which was equally good.  \n\nRichie offered us a taste of Concentrated Evil (or was it Certified Evil), a dark brew collaboration from Lucky Bucket in Truckee, which they have on tap as a special.  Not being the dark brew fan, I wasn't sure that I'd like it.  It actually turned out to be quite nice and didn't have any bitter aftertaste that I was expecting from a dark.  \n\nTypical of many SF pizza aficionados, everyone has their favorite style and their favorite place to go for a pie.  So true to Yelp form,  you're going to hear why this place is good or isn't, because it's not like this place or that place.  Being the melting pot that the City is, I think there's plenty of room for another place that serves NY-style pizza.  I like them all, so I don't play favorites...just depends on what I want at that time.  If your idea of pizza is Delfina or A16, then this isn't your type of pizza...it's NY, not Neapolitan.  If you like Little Star or Patxi's, then you've stepped into the wrong joint...fork and knife not required.  It's not a Victor's or Nizario's type of place either.   You could compare Pi Bar to Arinell's, but the difference would be you get the following at Pi Bar: 1. alcohol, 2. fresh local ingredients, 3. a nice pleasant and warm atmosphere to hang out with friends, family, kids, and 4. no attitude served up with each slice.  Pi Bar just happens to be a bar that serves great NY-style pizza the way it's meant to only be topped...with 1-2 toppings.  And where else are you going to get a great selection of micro-brews to go along with your pie?  No where but Pi Bar.", "author": "JeFF T."}

More than a pizza-by-the-slice or another bar. Solid 4 stars, the 5th is based on personal taste and a bit speculative.  I love having this place in my neighborhood. \n\nI've eaten here several times now as it is delicious and very close to my home. I've heard people compare the pizza to Arnell's which I can understand but Pi is of much higher quality. I like Arnells but the pizza is so greasy and lopsided it's a bit of an insult to the dish. Pi uses better ingredients and I think it really comes through. Also the crust is crisper. I realize that pizza tastes vary and I won't waste the time or ASCII characters telling you why I think the pizza is solid and there's more to this place. I will say that like every other pizza blowhard, I've lived in a pizza capital and eaten it more than any other food by far but maybe you're one of those people that likes gooey thick doughy crust and you'd hate this pizza. \n\nMy favorite dish, besides the pizza, is the spinach salad. I hate spinach but you know what, it's good for me. The thing that makes the spinach salad the furthest thing from a pile of bitter leaves is a touch of feta and a few crumbs of Italian sausage heated in the dressing.  Yum!!\n\nDuring my last visit, I found out that the reason I love the sausage so much may be because it is handmade, on-site, every day! Think Arnells does that? \n\nOkay, the beer. I like beer. I made my own beer for a few years and I love a place that has a wide variety of beers on tap without being over-the-top beer snobs (I'm looking at you, Toranado). Perennial favorites are on tap as well as a revolving selection of special treats that you won't see in many places.\n\nHonestly I would normally give this place 4 stars because some items on the menu are a buck or two above a great deal.  The thing that pushes it to 5 for me is the math and motorcycle theme of the place. The happy hour special, called the pi*R^2 is a specific beer (different one every day) and a slice of cheese pizza for 6.28. Obviously they are assuming R to be equal to the square root of two and I would call it the 2*pi*R as the common assumption would be that we're talking about the unit circle, but I digress. Also, as is typical for a new restaurant, the menu is going through some changes. I wasn't a big fan of the pinwheels (I learned I just don't like pinwheels) but I hear a meatball sandwich is coming and I really cannot wait. \n\nOne of the owners is a motorcycle buff and has a couple cool pieces of motorcycle artwork on the wall.

I would give this place a 3.5 star until I got the check.  Not because it was expensive, but because of the overcharge that the owner/manger was unwilling to take off for the server's mistake.  It's not the money ($8), it's the principal of it.  At the end of the day, I paid the bill and told them that they lost a customer.

My five star rating is based on the amazing Italian Rainbow Cookies, flag cookies, venetian cookies, Italian tri colore cookies, Italian wedding cookies, whatever you wanna call them and the fabulously friendly bartender!  \n\nAfter failing miserably in my endeavor to find rainbow cookies between San Diego and Los Angeles (FYI if you're ever in Las Vegas, they have amazing rainbow cookies at Tintoretto's in the Venetian.  Make sure you call first to see if they're in stock because they sell out early in the day!), I knew I was destined to find something in San Francisco.  After much google searching, I found an article that mentioned rainbow cookies at Pi.  After braving the rain on my drive to San Francisco, I dragged my best friend out of her cozy condo on Geary in search of these cookies.  When I walked in, I asked for the cookies and felt part of some secret club where you have to say a password to be let in.  After telling the bartender (God forgive me for not being able to remember her name...Julie??) that I drove all the way from San Diego for these delectable delights, she gave me the whole back story about the cookies, the bar and herself!  She made me glad I made the trek, rainboots and all, to try them for myself.  I paired the very moist cookies (they were the cake like version) with the pomegranate cider, and was in heaven.  \n\nI've tried both versions of the cookie, the cake like version and the cookie version (The cake like is the traditional, the cookie version of the \"cookie\" is more Americanized, or so I've been told).  Almost all places fail in making the cake like version of the cookie because it seems like they use boxed cake mix, however, Pi really set the bar (no pun intended, okay, maybe a little :) for rainbow cookies.  The cake was moist, there was a generous amount of preserves and it was covered in chocolate ganache (No nestle chocolate chips here!)!! I didnt try the food as it was pretty late however my friend has promised to try them out and post a review.  If you're dying for rainbow cookies, go here! You'll be glad you did!", "author": "Dominique M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-09", "description": "Went to Pi Bar with some trepidation on weds after reading Yelp reviews. As any fan of beer will tell you, we are living in amazing times in terms of the number and breadth of quality brews available so I make it a point to check out new places with a strong beer menu. On that front, Pi does not disappoint. A perusal of their list and chats with Jen, one of the owners, confirms that they are serious about their beer and interested in customer feedback. Jen really knows her stuff. \n\nWe got in just in the nick of time for the $6.28 daily 3-6 slice and beer of day option. Beer was Great White or something. Not bad, but I'm not a white beer guy. The Elysian ESB I had next and my friends Green Flash IPA were both superb and there were many other great choices. As someone else pointed out, not an overwhelming number which is good.\n\nThe pizza? First slice took awhile to appear and came out burnt on the bottom. We pointed this out to our friendly bartenders who promptly replaced with fresh slices from a new pie. Pizza was as close to New York style as I've had here, save maybe for Arnels. Pretty damn tasty. We ate every bite, crust and all. No issue with that as others have pointed out here. Crust was nice and crispy, not  too hard.  So tasty in fact that we order another slice, but this time with the homemade (on premises) sausage. Wow, even better! Not your typical pizza sausage but really tasty with lots of subtle flavors like fennel. I like the fact that they sell by the slice and it's $3.14 for cheese, .50/topping. $3.65 seems like a pretty good deal for a very good slice of pizza. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? Hardly but very tasty and far better than most of doughy, over cheesed stuff that passes for pizza in this town. \n\nHerein lies the problem with Pi IMHO. Is it a beer bar that serves pizza or a destination pizza place? From what I've read about the full pie prices, they are priced like a destination pizza place (aka Beretta, Gialino, Defina, Little Star, etc). Yet the description on the website and the results are more like they are aiming to be an everyday place.\n\nThere's a lot of expectations in this town around really good pizza so the bar is set pretty high. They should be cut some slack for being new (I mean, they've only been open a week) and be given a chance to work out the kinks in the food. My advice if you're unhappy is to let them know. They were very attentive and focused on getting things right. I'll definitely be going back cause I love what they're doing with the beer and the ability to get a decent slice or 2 on short notice but if I'm looking for a pizza night out I think there are some better choices.", "author": "John B."}

We topped our pizza with portabella mushrooms, the Italian sausage, and onions. Oh my god it was so good my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My friend said that it was like gourmet pizza! I inquired about the ingredients and was happy to find out that they order the majority of their food from organic local sources! \nAlso I am a big fan of ciders so I was thrilled when they had a great organic pomegranate cider, and I ordered a Belgian beer called Kasteel Rouge that was suggested to me, man was it good! It's sweet which I like and tasted like chocolate covered cherries. I would go back just for that beer! \nAs for the service I have to say that they were on top of their game. It was packed when we walked in and despite the fact that we couldn't get a seat right away we were totally taken care of. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food came promptly. There is a really great vibe over all, it feels like the Pi Bar has been there for ages it's hard to believe they just opened.

It doesn't take 45 minutes to make a pizza, but if it does,  at least have the decency to tell your customer so I don't have to stand there waiting for 25 minutes with nothing to do.\n\nI also asked if I could do a half and half, with two different ingredients, the answer was no. I don't think I've ever been to a pizza place that said no to that request before. Given that there large is so big it's got to feed multiple people, I would hope they will work out a way to solve this problem.\n\nLastly the toppings list could be improved a little, maybe some specials, some seasonal options.

Party of 5 adults, one baby on a Thursday night. We got there just after 6 and waited a good 30-45 minutes before we got a (small) table. Downed a few beers while we waited, which made the wait go a lot faster. Definitely lots of energy in this place---a communal table that had patrons rotating through it on a regular basis, a lively bar, and loads of people eating, waiting, drinking. Mixed crowd, though less hipster-ish than Beretta just down the street. \n\nWe ordered a pasta dish and the cesar salad to start. Meh. I'd stick with the pizzas. Both dishes were pretty small, and definitely too small to serve as share plates (we literally each had one bite of the pasta dish before it was gone). They were fine, but nothing special. We ordered a large pizza ($22) with three additional toppings: sausage (homemade---yum!), meatballs, and roasted peppers. One of our friends tried to add a fourth topping (holy toppings!), but was advised against it because the crust is too thin to withstand all the topping pressure. Or something like that. \nAnyway, the pizza came out piping hot. The sausage was good, but the meatballs were more flavorful. I chased it all down with a Coney Island Pilsner. Excellent. The large pizza meant we could all have one giant slice and half of another slice, with one half slice left. That was plenty for us, but if you're hungry, you might want to get a large and a small for a group of 5. Besides, who doesn't like leftover pizza?! \nIn all, I'd say the pizza was pretty good, the vibe good, but really the best part is that it's within walking distance of our house.

Restaurant had a great laid-back bar feel which luckily wasn't too crowded that night. Tables are pretty small and limited, so not sure how easy it would be to snag a table on a busier night. Was a little disappointed in the menu selection. Not too many appetizers to choose from and all the pizzas are DIY where you pick your own toppings. Started with polenta fries, which came in a smaller portion than I imagined it to be. Ordered a large pizza, which ended up being huge! Overall, prices are not too bad for the size of the pizza, but I've had better. However, I see all the Yelp reviews here raving about the beer, so I might have to come back here one day to grab a drink.", "author": "Vivian D."}

Well, fine.  You sad suckers can just enjoy your dry, stale and bland \"style\" of pizza.  I don't even want to know what other garbage you think is delicious.

(i only saw three people at most in there who looked over 45!)\n\nabout the pizza: organic, local ingredients make me quite happy. that's in line with my values and taste buds. at first bite, the pizza (with toppings!) was good, but what became apparent was that it's simply too dry. pizza for me is about the ratio of ingredients, and the sauce was merely a visual accessory, hardly noticeable to the palate. it wasn't until i was halfway through my second slice that i decided to ask for extra sauce to give it the body it needed. whoa! super tasty sauce. beautiful, but too bad they don't emphasize it.\n\ni had hopeful expectations, and was sadly very very disappointed.", "author": "d b."}

Nice atmosphere, good service, delicious beers, decent pizza--the pizza gets the job done but it's no Little Star or Delfina Pizzeria, that is for sure. I would go back for a beer (their selection was unique--up there with Monk's Kettle in my book) and/or maybe I'd go for an appetizer (the fried mozzarella sounded good?), but I would not specifically go there for a meal again unless they ramp it up. I do like their commitment to local, organic, sustainably farmed foods....maybe one of the problems is that you choose your own toppings? Seems like a great idea in essence, but I actually find that the combinations are always better when the chef picks them. I prefer to leave it to the experts and just order a combo that's on the menu. So maybe it's best if you ask the server to suggest a combo of toppings that tends to work well? To say the least, i am glad I tried it. I also appreciate that the business owner opened his restaurant on this up-and-coming block. Valencia is undoubtedly gentrifying block by block. They are just getting this biz started, so I am sure they will improve as they receive feedback from customers.", "author": "Sara W."}

I have not checked their pizza, but it looks good. Their special for $6.40 is not with every beer, it is only with one of the taps. I will definitely go back.", "author": "S C."}

The slice was quite good, NY style, but the presence of a large group with small children (in a bar?) was a bit annoying.  Otherwise it seemed like a nice place, quite adequate in a pinch.  Then over to Berkeley to try the new Emilia's.  The slice option there was much more  appealing because it included onions and sausage instead of just plain cheese, yet was cheaper than the cheese slice at Pi ($3 versus $3.14).  However, I did have to wait 15 minutes while he made a new slice pie, and it seemed inevitable that the waits are going to be a bit long since as far as I could see there was only one person staffing the entire operation.  That aside, the slice was delicious.   All ingredients were first rate and the crust was perfect..", "author": "David T."}

Sadly, I stopped in here a few weekends ago with my bf and we were sorely disappointed.  We both go the slice + beer for $6.28 special, since we were on our way to a movie and didn't want to stay long.  First complaint:  \"Can I get mushrooms on my slice?\"  The answer was no, even though I offered to pay extra for it.  Really? REALLY???  Really, you don't want to take my money AND please a customer by taking an extra 20 seconds to put some mushrooms on my slice???  Mind you, the place had just opened for the day and we were literally the only people there, so it's not like they could be \"too busy\" (imo).  The reasoning was that they \"just like to keep it simple, and not adjust the price\".  Give. me. a. break.   Complaint #2: Bad beer advice.  Bf asked what they had in terms of lighter beer, and our server recommended something that ended up being kind of a dark amber.  I ended up trading him my pilsner.  Complaint #3 (and most importantly):  The food was terrible.  Given that they had just opened for the day, when our food arrived it was clear they had just heated up a few slices from the night before.  Which might have been OK (hey, it's pizza), if the crust wasn't mostly burned and the sauce non-existant.  I couldn't even fold the slice, it was so crisply burned.  I was surprised they would even serve us this food.  Not worth the money, and definitely not worth my time.", "author": "Vicki M."}
