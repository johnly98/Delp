I have even tried their coffee at the Rose Establishment in SLC, Delfina, B Patisserie and several restaurants/cafes in SF and it's been consistently good.\n\nDuring a break in my schedule I decided to pick up a cappuccino and a slab of the $4 toast.  The cappuccino, made with whole milk, was creamy and frothy and hot, but at just the right temperature to drink immediately.  Perfection.\n\nYep, I was one of those that made fun of the $4 toast.  $4 for a slice of bread and some spreads? $4 for for something I could make myself at home?  Well, that slice of toast is as thick as two regular slices of bread.  It's hearty, flavorful and very fresh.  This is not something pumped out of an assembly line or sitting on a store shelf for days.  That bread is really good.  The bread was toasted and topped with generous portions of creamy butter, cinnamon and sugar.  Yum.  \n\nSo $4 for a small cappuccino and $4 for toast.  Was it worth it?

It's all about quality at Four Barrel, not quantity.\n\nThe menu is limited and that's a good thing.  This is not a Starbucks so there is no made up names for cup sizes, no blended iced drinks and syrups, chocolate drizzles, whipped cream or other such nonsense that  turn a cup of coffee into dessert.   Options for milk are whole milk or almond milk.  There's sugar and syrup for sweeteners.  This is what cafes used to be like before the introduction of the mega-chain coffee outlets, where the primary focus is on the coffee itself.\n\nParking can bet hit or miss in this area.  On some afternoons parking is nonexistent.  On this morning, parking was plentiful.  As others have mentioned there is seating but not many options for tables.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I was excited to try it. Instead this review is really about adorable toast. \n\nMy order for a cappuccino was taken by an enthusiastic young woman working the register. I needed a pastry to go with my coffee, and was pretty much down to a chocolate bear claw. But wait! \"Have you considered our toast\", she asked. Hmmm afternoon toast with my coffee. She can tell I'm not excited. With great care and detail, she fills me in on the toast. Apparently they source bread from someone whose name I was supposed to recognize. (Sorry bread person. I'm sure you're well known and super nice. I don't recall your name.) I was suddenly self conscious regarding my obvious ignorance of fine toast. Tartine bread I've heard of, but this was, well, toast. The grain was sourced in CA, totally organic, and milled by said bread person. \"We top it with almond butter and a sprinkle of sea salt.\" Never have I seen someone so genuinely into toast. She was quite simply adorable.\n\nSo needless to say, I got the toast. It was a thick slab, with little sparkles of sea salt glistening in the afternoon sun. I took a photo of the toast. I texted co-workers about this toast. Later that evening, I told my girlfriend the story of what was now The Toast. I am now up way too early, writing Yelp! reviews for a coffee shop, but primarily focused on The Toast.\n\nThe Toast was pretty good. But all said and done, I should have taken a photo of the adorable woman that worked there. It was refreshing to meet someone obviously enjoying life,  particularly while at work. Thank you adorable toast woman.\n\nP.S. Back to the coffee. My cappuccino was very good. Though I think as far as San Francisco choices go, I still prefer Blue Bottle for a cap.

This location is a cute and artsy hole in the wall with indoor and outdoor seating. Hipster/vintage vibes and all that good stuff. \n\nI don't typically drink a Cup of Joe, so I can't say that I am a coffee enthusiast, but I am a latte enthusiast. I've tried lattes at multiple coffee shops in the bay area(Blue Bottle, Ritual, Philz, Trouble, and Reveille to name a few) but I haven't found anything that beats Four Barrel lattes thus far. The lattes are creamy and rich, but not overly bitter or milky- it is a perfect chemistry of both ingredients. The quality of the latte is always consistent and never has a burnt or sour taste that I occasionally taste at some coffee shops I have been to.\n\nI have been a loyal customer of Four Barrel, first in the Valencia location and now this one here that is closer to my house, and I have noticed that the prices of the drinks have racked up drastically, maybe even more than I am willing to pay for. It is $5 for a latte + $0.50/$0.75 to substitute for almond milk, making a cup of latte almost $6, which is the price I usually paid for a pastry and latte.\n\nAlthough Four Barrel is my favorite go-to coffee shop, I am not convinced that the tradeoff between smooth and rich coffee vs. $6 is worth dropping the money to buy on a daily basis, especially for a broke college student.

We had one sweet and one savory. \n\nMy main complaint would be that they need some small tables or one big, long communal one. Not having a place to set our pastries was a bummer. I meet with clients at coffee shops all the time, and would love to bring them here, but need a table and would probably like the option to sit inside. It does feel like they are not \"done\" with the inside with the lack of seats/tables. \n\nI wish them all the luck and hope to see tables soon, so I can come by with clients and show off my neighborhood!", "author": "Keri V."}

I ran out of my preferred coffee that I make at home everyday and so went for four barrel that morning (Thursday 07/14/16) - I arrived around 7:45 to a deserted parking lot when it is usually full. I assumed it was a fluke and as I walked toward Four Barrel it was closed. I thought, hm do they open at 8AM? (Odd since I have been there before 8AM) NOPE. I checked Google and sure enough their hours are listed as 7AM - 4PM. I took a screen cap of the google business listing, the business front closed, and a picture of my watch and sent them a tweet with said pictures asking what was up. My friend chimed in that was NO BUENO on their part. I inquired if the management was above covering for their staff? I received a tweet back several hours later (I assume after management dragged themselves out of bed), and they responded with a nasty sarcastic response inferring it was not the end of the world. Clearly, their ethos is the opposite of \"the customer is always right\". Yeah I'll take Fat Beli deli coffee any day over their overpriced coffee, and long waits, and HORRENDOUS attitude.

You may be able to park perpendicularly in front of the shop?  Not sure if that's allowed, but it might be cool if it's for a quick stop.  I tried the decaf almond milk latte.  Like I said before I'm not normally a coffee drinker, but it was smooth and didn't cause the runs and no jitters.  (Decaf still has some caffeine in it).  I'm a big fan of businesses adapting old industrial buildings for new uses which it looks like what Four Barrel did here.
