It's spicy with jalepineo and sweet mayo.  Bread is crunchy in the outside but not so tough you can't take a nice big bite, toasted right.\n\nThe sandwich may appear small at first, but it's heavy in your hand, because they have THICC slides of toast pork.  They keep on bits of fat at the slides that make it juicy af.  Definitely flavorful and not dry that some banh mi places (ya know that old red meat)\n\nWhat makes this sandwich 5/5 is that they even marinate the carrots so that it's a bit sweet and still crunchy.   It's the little details on the sandwich that rounds it out.\n\nIt's a tiny hidden little place but definitely one of those corner joints you keep coming back again and again.  Also it's ran by a nice  Vietnamese family.  20% tip for sure.", "author": "Allen S."}

With lunch being less than $10 a person, I'd say this place is great to get food that isn't overpriced in the city. My sister and I came here on a Wednesday right before noon, and there were a few seats open and 2 tables for 2 also free. Several people stop here for a quick bite to eat or order to go and eat elsewhere (everything is packaged in to-go containers anyway). Service is straightforward and friendly.\n\nWe got:\n1) 5 spice chicken banh mi: it was pretty good! We both like the flavor of the chicken, but which the bread was a little softer like the typical french torpedo baguettes usually used (if you're not careful biting into your sandwich, you'll definitely have a cut up mouth/gums)\n2) Roasted pork bowl: we actually enjoyed that this bowl had less noodles than the typical Vietnamese place that would have majority of the dish be noodles. Instead, there was a lot of shredded carrots, pickled celery, and other greens. Inside the bowl is a small container of sweetened fish sauce to pour over your bowl. Although it wasn't truly authentic (imo) to what a vermicelli noodle bowl is, it definitely had some of the same flavors and was reminiscent to it. I'd come back. \n3) Viet iced coffee: you can't go wrong with this--although I think $4 is a little steep in price.\n\nOverall, it's a fast, affordable lunch spot that people should check out if they want some Vietnamese food!", "author": "Shannon N."}

It was of traditional size, however it was pretty expensive for it being $6.75.

Anyway, I've walked by this spot numerous times but didn't know it was such a small and popular space.

Thank goodness as I'm off bread for now.\n\nNow my conscience was telling me to order a green salad, but some rice noodles wouldn't kill me, would it? WOULD IT? Anyway, I ordered the $7.25 Five-Spice Chicken Fresh Bowl, which had shredded carrots, cilantro, pickled daikon, roasted peanuts, and crispy shallots mixed with rice noodles and iceberg lettuce in a deep cardboard container (photo: http://bit.ly/2KZrum1). It was pretty tasty, and despite the awkward vessel it was all put in, the quantity was satisfying for a meal. If they stayed open for a couple more hours, I'd come back here more often.

We tried the pork, garlic butter chicken, and the duck, and the worst one, by far, was the duck banh mi. There was very little meat, and mostly fat, and they don't include the pickled carrots and daikon with the duck. \n\nOn the other hand, the pork banh mi and the garlic butter chicken banh mi were both excellent. The ratios of meat to vegetables were very well balanced, and the bread wasn't too crunchy or too soft, but just right. Who am I, Goldilocks? Anyways, the garlic butter chicken was definitely the star of the show in my opinion, which is strange, because I traditionally prefer pork. But the chicken breast was very moist, and and just went really well with the peppers and sliced pickled vegetables. \n\nAt around $7 each, they can be considered expensive, given that Saigon Sandwich is just a few blocks away with their $4 banh mi, but I'd say you get a little more attention to detail at DragonEats. I've had my order messed up 9 times out of 10 at Saigon Sandwich, whereas DragonEats definitely pays more attention.

The atmosphere is much laid back and elegant as I welcomed there.

Friendly and approachable. No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the food! Since it was on the middle of lunch and snack in between, I ordered their signature banh mi called, 5 Spices Chicken. As I ate it, it tasted very good and delicious! It has well balanced flavors for the chicken and natural ingredients together although the cooked chicken breasts pieces are closely bland to me despite it lacked the half of the spices of the chicken. Hopefully, the spices for the chicken will improve it's natural flavors in the future. Otherwise, what a good snackie lunch meal!\n\nParking at DragonEats can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking or parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, DragonEats is the finest and most remarkable local Vietnamese Fusion banh mi shop that I've ever visited for the first time.

We decided on chicken and split it. We got our sandwiches and unwrapped them and they looked and smelled beautiful!! I know beautiful is a funny description, but they looked so fresh yet, they were a hot sandwich. Next I took a bite and fell in love!! Omg, this sandwich was so flavorful and different and fresh and I was like ...where has this been all of my life!!! It was so good that we ordered another one but the pork one and it was so delicious too. The second time around I asked for extra sauce because that sauce was out of this world!!! I was stuffed afterwards, but it was worth it! The owners (I think) /people working there were so kind and generous. This place was a little far from where I was staying, but I will pay $12.00 for Uber to get this sandwich next time I'm in SFO!!!! Thanks guys!!!", "author": "Christa R."}

Their spring rolls, while also pricely, are similarly fulfilling.\n\nService is also fast and friendly here.

I love the combo of Tofu, fresh veggies and that smooth peanut sauce mmm.  So, recently I had a craving and was in the Hayes Valley area.  Typically, I go to some spots near me in \"Little Saigon\" aka the Tenderloin, but I was starving and found Dragon Eats after a quick yelp search.\n\nThis spot is located right in the Hayes Valley and is actually pretty nondescript.  There is no sign outside, only the menu posted on the window.  Walking in, the spot is fairly small, about three tables and then stools lining the windows to sit up on the ledge.  I ordered the Tofu spring rolls ($6.50. 2 per order).  I assume these were pre-made because by the time I helped myself to some of the complementary cucumber water they were already up and ready.  \n\nThe spring rolls were fairly disappointing.  As mentioned, I think they were pre-made and were a bit warm/room temperature which ruined the texture.  The peanut sauce was quite delicious, however because the rolls came pre-cut also (into thirds) they all just fell apart when I was eating them.  The flavors were good, but just a bit hard to eat with the warmish temperature and stuff falling out everywhere.  Also, inside the place was a damn sauna.  Seriously, it is small but the windows were even fogging up it was so warm in here (thank goodness for that refreshing complementary cucumber water). Possibly I would try the Banh Mi next time as I do appreciate that they offer veg options but wouldn't go for the spring rolls again.", "author": "Kelsey B."}

So the sandwich got really soggy, and was kind of a mayo-y mess by the end. \n\nI also got the papaya salad, which had a lot of fresh ingredients, but weirdly not that much papaya.", "author": "Adam W."}

The fish sauce was also not as flavorful (huh?! how is that even possible?) Banh mi is $6 a pop, which seems a little exorbitant.

The duck sandwich is the best item on the menu I think. The pork meatball runs a close second. There are two types of chicken -- butter chicken and 5 spice chicken. I recommend the 5 spice and pass on the butter. With the sandwiches, you can choose from the entire protein line-up. But with the bowls, you only get pork, chicken, or tofu.

I've been here twice and tried the duck banh mi, pork fresh (noodle) bowl, and the spring rolls. All were definitely to my liking. However, I do have one dislike, the fresh bowl's portion is wayyyy too little for its price!! It's pretty refreshing and delicious! But the portion is too little, such a tease! Other than that, the duck banh mi was yummy! They have the actual chinese style roasted duck meat in the sandwich, never seen that anywhere! Definitely unique! And the spring rolls were good, the sauce is pretty legit. \n\nWould I go again? Probably, but I'm most likely not gonna get the fresh noodle bowl. Too little to satisfy my hunger needs ;P lol it's good tho, don't get me wrong.", "author": "Cindy C."}

THE END. \n\nAs much as I would love to leave it at that, I hate one-liner reviews. I wouldn't be much of a helpful Yelper if I left it at that now, would I?\n\nAfter seeing Genevieve Y.'s review yesterday (congrats on the FTR!), I was excited to learn that DragonEats opened in Hayes Valley near my office. I'm \"attempting\" to eat healthier these days and saw that they had brown rice on the menu which is the ONLY reason why I decided to not pack my lunch today and go to DragonEats.  \n\nDragonEats' concept is Vietnamese street food with 2 Spring Roll, 5 Banh Mi (they call it Banh My) and 4 Noodle/Brown Rice Bowl options on the menu. They claim all their ingredients are organic (not sure about that as I felt MSG aftereffects). Everything is $6. \n\nAgain, the only reason why I came here was because they have brown rice on the menu. When ordering, I was told the brown rice wasn't ready. When I inquired how long it would take, they later said, they wouldn't have brown rice at all today. Umm, please take it off the chalkboard menu for today then because the 2 customers after me were also asking for brown rice (one ended up leaving).\n\nI didn't just walk 10 minutes for nothing so I ordered the Tofu Banh My ($6) and the Five-Spice Chicken Noodle Bowl ($6); half of each for lunch and the rest for dinner later. \n\nThe Tofu Banh My was TERRIBLE! You would think a Tofu Banh Mi would be a healthy option but it was NOT. The baguette roll was oily and left grease stains on the white wrapper while the scant tofu filling was incredibly bland. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ziWibyZYvqtrbc7f9v2iPg?select=JyP_z2W_pJzYLu0AB6ITjg#Ub8DXwH1hb41BmhSOqjWnA There was no Maggi sauce and no pickled veggies or jalapenos, things an authentic banh mi should have. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ziWibyZYvqtrbc7f9v2iPg?select=JyP_z2W_pJzYLu0AB6ITjg#sjg9vYlwBkrpt7TObzTS1Q And for $6 (a Banh Mi is normally $3-$4)? RIPOFF. Several bites left me feeling gross so I proceeded to eating the Five-Spiced Chicken and Veggies. The chicken was cold and had no char/grill marks as it should. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ziWibyZYvqtrbc7f9v2iPg?select=JyP_z2W_pJzYLu0AB6ITjg#yy4LrKz2jfixXt9bWo3Qiw Trying to abstain from as much refined carbs as I can, I didn't touch the rice noodles but I couldn't help but noticed how small the portion was compared to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ziWibyZYvqtrbc7f9v2iPg?select=JyP_z2W_pJzYLu0AB6ITjg#zG3krzTF4K6KEl_OvB1HFw\n \nNext time, I'll take the extra 5 minutes to walk to the TL and step over crackheads to get authentic Vietnamese food at a fraction of the cost. \n\nBest of luck, DragonEats...seriously.\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Open Monday - Friday 11 AM - 3 PM\n*Very cute d\u00e9cor with vibrant blues and greens\n*Communal table seating for 5 and counter seating for 6\n*Everything served in to-go containers\n*CASH ONLY", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I'm coming back.\n\nI worked from home last week Friday and finally got the change to pop in for lunch (at the time they were only open over lunch, M-F but now I think they've started weekends too).  I've noticed the space and saw this place coming up and have been waiting to try it out.\n\nThe space is cute and small.  It looks geared mostly for take-out, but they have bar seating that lets you people watch in Hayes Valley and a nice communal table.  The mixed woods on the table and bars is really cool.  I need to post some pics of it next time I try them out.\n\nThe food is really fresh and oh so tasty.  My main focus was the pork banh mi.  This was really delicious.  The pork was tender, juicy and had a lot of flavor.  I'm kinda salivating as I write this.  The pickled veg was fresh and crunchy.  Overall it was a well balanced sandwich with a hint of warming heat/spice.  \n\nI also ordered the fresh spring rolls with veggies/shrimp.  It came with a great, standard peanut sauce.  Again, everything was super fresh.  They are made to order.  \n\nService was super polite.  The team is still getting used to their surroundings and ironing out the kinks.  And chatting with someone else there, it sounds like the owner is new to the restaurant world and just is just taking his love of food and his Vietnam roots and building a new business.\n\nI'm anxious to return and try out the chicken and noodle dishes.

The sandwich was the most expensive thing and only around 6 bucks ... probably one of the most affordable meals available in Hayes Valley.\n\nSecondly, the store was impeccably clean.  While very tiny, the staff keeps the store extremely tidy.  I actually wanted to stay in the store to eat lunch.  Nice hardwood tables, clean design, and cucumber water!\n\nFinally, the staff is lovely.  When we realized this was a cash only place, my husband went outside to find an ATM.

I have tried MANY Vietnamese sandwiches from MANY different locations and none compare to the quality and delicious taste of Dragon Eats sandwiches. They are just SO GOOD and not only that, they are consistently good. There's never been a day where I've had an off sandwich. It's always perfect. Their spring rolls are also super yummy. The wraps are always fresh, never hard like at some other locations. They also offer complimentary cucumber water. How cool is that?! Yes, I agree $6 is high but you can't get the same level of awesome food at any of the other places that offer sandwiches for $3. It's CASH ONLY so come prepared but otherwise, you will definitely fall in love with this place. I wish I lived in the city so I could have lunch here all the time!", "author": "Amanda C."}
