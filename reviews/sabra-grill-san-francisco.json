{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-20", "description": "I've been meaning to come here for years but have never had the chance as I'm only ever downtown when I'm working... and the truth is I never leave the office for lunch.  But that may all change now that I've been to Sabra.  Eating here is such a great experience.  Some people may be put off by how basic the interior and atmosphere is but in fact, in addition to the food being fantastic, the added bonus of the atmosphere makes this place a 5-out-of-5.\n\nI believe this place is family run, and if it isn't, you certainly get the feeling that it is.  This looks like the kind of place where family and friends have been gathering for years.  The 2 strapping lads that served us were very friendly & personable and the service was the perfect balance of \"attentive, non-intrusive\" if that is even a thing.  They were very friendly but left us to our own devices, as they should.  I personally don't feel waiters should constantly be coming up and talking to you.\n\nAgain, the decor is very basic... but spot-on.  Stark white walls accented by \"Mediterranean-Blue\" trim and table cloths, the occasional framed photo or painting depicting Jewish themes, holidays, imagery etc...all ill-sized to fit the aforementioned disproportionately large white walls.  Black plastic chairs with vinyl black seats and only about 1 tables, 2-3 of which were set up for large groups.  Again, I can imagine a lot of families gather here in large groups.  Let's put it this way, this place looks like one of those restaurants that Ottolenghi puts a photo of in his cookbooks to show what real \"Mom & Pop\" restaurants look like in Jerusalem.  This place feels authentic and despite how \"under-decorated\" it is, is one of the most enjoyable dining atmospheres I've experienced in SF.\n\nBetween the 2 of us, we ordered the Combo Salad & the Lamb Shishlick platter.  This was more than enough for both of us, so do not let the dollar signs dissuade you (as some people have suggested they are $$$)- they give you a lot of food here! The combo salad consisted of a mound of heavily cucumbered cabbage and carrot salad, huge wells of Hummus & Baba Ghanoush, fried aubergine, 4 dolma and 6 falafel. Many people on YELP credit Sabra with the best falafel in SF and I have to agree. And of course this came with 2 large, fluffy pitas.  My friend I was dining with exclaimed how she had never had pitas so fluffy and pockety (haha)!  The Lamb Shishlick came with 2 skewers of lamb, more hummus, salad and a side of rice and/or fries (we did both).  Unfortunately, we were talking so much that we accidentally let the lamb get cold, but it was still nice, even if on the slightly chewier side...again, that was probably our fault.  We ate almost everything but ended up having to take half the hummus home and half the shishlick home...which was fine by me.  We were stuffed and we can both put down A LOT of food.  Our bill, including 2 turkish coffees and a sparkling water, came to $54 which, I believe, is outstanding considering the amount and tastiness of the food we got.\n\nI can't believe it has taken me this long to try this place.  It certainly surpassed my expectations.  I will DEFINITELY be back!", "author": "Adrian C."}

It was a good appetizer to split between the 3 of us.  Then, we ordered variations of the Shislik.  I ordered the Lamb, the others ordered Chicken and Beef.  The meats could have used some more seasoning, in my opinion.  We added a coke and a Pastrami Sandwich to go.  The bill was north of $120.00 for all of that.  Not worth it, in my opinion.

I ended up calling them after talking to the driver and Door Dash customer service, to see if they would make an order still as there aren't many options for Kosher meals nearby.

I hear the meat is bomb too!!! Maybe the side portions can be bigger but I am fully happy here! The rest I'm writing to you with a big heart and love for small businesses (:\n\nTruly felt like home to me...\n\nWow... I need to come here more often just to bring someone inside with me too, how did I not come here when I lived in the TL! I'm not Jewish...I'm a Jew!! AUTHENTIC Middle Eastern OG KOSHER food is hard to come by not just in SF but the Bay TOTAL. There was once this one place, but now THIS is that one place. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. I came here cuz my dad & I were hungry and needed Kosher food!\n\nI'll drive from South San Jose where I live, to Chinatown and back again, and probably everytime. I'll catch an uber too, I'll walk if I'm downtown! \n\nYou see my dad is an observant Jew who keeps a Kosher diet! most the time we cook at home, because, well there's nowhere to eat in the South Bay. Now he also works weekdays in The Bay staying with me, and then LA on the weekend! Who needs to go eat out!! Well for those who do, and for those times when you're so fortunate like we were to be in downtown Frisco, you wanna eat something nice, don't you!! \n\nNot to mention we were working that day all day....it was a late lunch if you will, and then I looked down at the menu prices, checked at the time, bingo I had 40 minutes left for the lunch special....fire. $15 AT MOST for a STUFFED pita of whatever you like, shawarma kebob chicken schnitzel. But I wanted to keep it light with no meat, I went for the $10 ( yea $10 in SF KOSHER ) and it was LIT FAM it was STUFFED. We got 2 orders of each, fries, 2 Malt Star Beers (A non alcoholic Israeli Malt Beer) and I was excuse me, FREAKING HAPPY. Was it like my dad's? Nope. But for a moment in my head it felt like it, I really got happy eating here. I would eat dinner here and sit down next time.\n\nI'm gonna go there, you know that Adam Sandler movie, \"Eight Nights of Hanukkah\" ? Well Jews really do link with the Chinese, this shop is a GEM in what some may call an historical part of town in San Francisco. Heard of Chinatown? Idk me either. Just got these cool looking Oriental buildings in the heart of SF, Bush and Grant, says it on your Yelp! I just learned it now too, right by the Dragon Gates. \n\nIt's enough just to be here, in SF, but the aesthetic in & around the restaurant very proper & fitting. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give this place a shot despite the walk up the stairs, have you seen the hills in SF!?? Or is Uber taking over your life!!!  Yeah I know SF is all San Tech now but...\n\nThere is an Old World sense & taste in and around Sabra Grill. Consider getting there by foot, going down the Silk Road from East to West.\n\nWalk through Union Square due East, & after you pass under the towering skyscrapers of Downtown down Bush or Grant, go under the Dragon Gates and step no further than 13 steps. There you'll find the Middle Eastern Sabra Grill, right there at the head of Chinatown. You go from West to East in seconds, but Sabra Grill is that blend of both.\n\nMake a (slight) Ascent up the stairs to the Middle East , into a tight space of what looks like MOST Middle Eastern food stops I've seen myself. Nothing cute and that's the style I'm used to in the OG places, it felt like I was tucked in a corner of Jerusalem or my dad's town of Akko. The Walls have pictures of Israel, Scripture on the walls in Hebrew, maps of Israel, & if seeing the guy in a Kippah/Yamukkah wasn't enough to know I was gonna eat Kosher food, I was at peace with the man's clear appreciation for his culture and history. The place had no shame in who it was.\n\nI felt at home inside, I didn't expect anything more or less than what I saw. Do you know how hard it is JUST TO RUN A RESTAURANT!! Kosher Certification is a a big merit and meticulous task of maintaining food standards for the Jewish community! Anybody who takes that task is faced with daily scrutiny of his practices, because for the people who need it, it matters that much. It's just as important as gluten free and Halal and vegetarian! BIG props to the big guy behind the counter who works very hard & looks like my dad!!! I never seen a huger smile on my face when I asked to take a picture of them together. In fact it's the only picture I took and not even the food because we scarfed it down!! \n\nI wish I got his name because I would tell you tell him, Matan sent you, the kid who took his picture with the big Jew bear looking guy! Just show him my picture I post!! SF you gotta go give this guy more reviews and I promise you won't be let down!!!\n\nThank you for letting me feel at home sir! Great spot!", "author": "Matan A."}

The narrow stairs up are easy to miss.\nI kind of like the decor, blue and white paint with art work on the walls, some more interesting then others. There is exactly one window seat with an indifferent view of the second story across the street.\nThe food here is nothing short of spectacular. If you are a vegetarian the hummus/baba ganoush platters with pita and falafel are superb. comes with pickels, eggplant, and a spicy relish/chutney.\nThe meat dishes are likewise superb, with the kabobs being a standout but be warned that this is a slow food place. Food is cooked to order and if you are planning to hit this place on a an hour lunch there is real risk of you not making it back to work in time.\nAlso know that all menu items may be more expensive then what you may be used to. Part of this is due to pure kosher typically costing more and partly due to the sheer quality of the food....hmm, well both of those reasons are kinda the same thing.\nThey are in the process of revamping the menu a bit-there is a new cook/chef with some desire to spice things up a bit. What this means to you practical terms is that some menu items may not always have exactly what is described, such as the veg combo platter substituting potato salad for a greek style leafy salad, or not depending on who is cooking.\nI recommend verifying what may (or may not be) on the plate upon ordering.\nIf kosher food is important to you this is a must do in SF. \nAlso one of the best Mediterranean food places in the city and is a good example of the eclectic restaurant scene with it's wonky location.", "author": "Steven W."}

And, after trying several places nearby, without a doubt the best Falafel in a several block radius.\n\nWhat I really like about them, is that the Falafel are always fried fresh, and are nice and hot and crispy when you bite into them.  Another unique thing they have is their pita bread.  It's thicker than any other pita bread I have ever been served (probably at least twice as thick, and it has air bubbles inside like you'd find in an English Muffin, only it's much thinner than that).  As a result, the pita is always very pliable, tasty, and chewy.  Best yet, it's always served warm.  The Falafel Pita is $9.95, and totally worth it; especially when compared to the Falafel served at the other restaurants nearby.\n\nMost places in San Francisco use a much thinner pita, almost all serve it cold, and when it's served dry it just crumbles into a mess, and the ingredients fall out on to your plate.\n\nA real treat here is the Lamb Shishlik.  Again, each skewer is grilled to order.  Without a doubt some of the very best tasting Lamb Shishlik I have ever had.  It's delicious.\n\nThe only major miss so far that I have eaten here is the Chicken & Onion Shawarma.  To me, it just tasted awful.  I think it might have something to do with being cooked on the same grill as the Lamb.\n\nOther than that, everything I have tried has been real good, and worth eating again.  The humus and the rice are also good.\n\nA lot of people complain about the prices here.  Yes, it's more expensive because everything has to be certified as being Kosher.  However, if you stick to the lunch specials that they have posted next to the entrance on the street (which run from 12pm to 4pm), the prices are pretty fair for the flavor of the food they serve (around $10-$16 for lunch without drinks).\n\nSince they are Jewish, it's closed on Saturday; but, open on Sundays. If you weren't specifically looking for it, you would easily miss the entrance on the street level.  If you start at the Chinatown Gate at Grant and Bush, it's about 50 feet up Grant Street on the left hand side (West Side of Grant St).

I settled on the beef kabob, and they brought me some pickles to start, which I found odd, but they were very tasty. Then out came the pita, I couldn't tell if it was home made, or store bought, but it was warm and soft, and fairly good. \n\nThen came the meal. I asked to hold the cabbage salad, because I don't care for cabbage, so it came with 2 large kabobs, about a third of a dinner plate of white rice, and a salad of mostly cucumbers and tomatoes, with a little bit of iceberg lettuce mixed in. The salad was a bit bland, but after a long warm day, it was refreshing and welcome. The rice was not overdone, and plain, I prefer it that way. The kabobs themselves had a fair amount of spice, and saltier than I prefer, but all in all, it was very good. If you don't care for salty foods, I'd probably stick to the vegetarian selections.\n\nThe meal itself was easily enough to feed two hungry people, and the owner gave me some odd looks as I ate all of it.

Do you then sit proudly in front of good food and tell your guests that they too will be worthy of becoming an 'Elite' some day?\n\nIf so, Sabra is the place to go.\n\nWHY GO HERE?  \nThis is the only place in the city (that I know of) that serves Israeli cuisine.  There are other restaurants serving Persian, Lebanese, Turkish, Iraqi, and Egyptian food, but not Israeli.  Note that most Jewish cuisine/deli differs from Israeli food.      \n\nHOW TO FIND:  This is part of the fun.  No hints.\n\nHOURS:  They have unique hours, so check their website (http://www.sabragrill.com/) or call first.  Closed Saturday.  On Friday, they close two hours before Shabbat.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  Pretty much what you would expect from a restaurant on the second floor of a building in Chinatown.  Probably not a good first date place - unless your tactic is to earn point via tasty falafels.\n\nFOOD:  Excellent falafels and all the great size dishes, including hummus, egg plants, and mushrooms.  While the skewered meat items where good, I could get equally good kabobs at other restaurants.  I was not a big fan of their lamb, which had a very distinct flavor that I've never had before.      \n\nDRINKS: Kosher Beer was good.\n\nSERVICE:  On all my visits here, service was casual but good.  I've learned that at a family owned businesses like this, I need be polite and respectful, where as in the bigger restaurants, I could act like a king.  \n\nSEATS:  Further to good service, they were very accommodating when I increased the reservation number.  He quickly added tables and seated 9 of us.  Very flexible when they are not too busy.  12-15 tables total.  \n   \nPRICE:  For dinner, prices were reasonable, but it may seem expensive for lunch since they don't have lunch prices.  For the next visit, my plan is to keep the price down by ordering bunch of their side dishes and staying away from their skewers, which is what brings the price up.   \n\nPlans for the next visit:\n$7.25 - Hummus and falafel\n$6.50 - Spicy mushroom and onion salad\n$7.00 - Fried spicy eggplant\n$5.00 - White cabbage salad\n$3.00 - Maccabee Beer\n$3.00 - Goldstar Beer\n$8.00 - Tip and taxes\n----------------------------\n$40 - Dinner for two\n(Prices as of June 2007; Dine-in prices)", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

It's not shawarma, but rather raw chunks of chicken pan fried with onions and spices.  Where's the slow roasted meat on a long spit?   The meat ends up being firmer and less crispy than a real shawarma.  That being said, toasting the pita on an open flame was a nice touch and the it had a good spicy kick.  The pickles were a little boring, they can do better than just pickled cucumbers.  The raw carrot slice didn't go well, would have been better if pickled.\n\nFalafel: A bit on the small side, but I liked the extremely crispy and jagged exterior paired against the creamy inside.

He was only covering 4 very low maintenance tables of the 16 tables in the joint. After he looked me up and down he took me to the only table that wasn't set (with napkins and cutlery like the others).\n\nI had a better look at the menu and thought he'd given me the \"you're not welcome here menu\" -- almost everything was over $20 and most dishes would be $30+ after tax, steak coming in around $40, the images looked like something out of a 1970's dive cafe.\n\nI found pita wraps on the back of the menu that said lunch only or take-away. These were priced $9-$15 - I asked for a glass of water and ordered a wrap and when it arrived, he shoved the dish on the table causing the wrap to unwrap. I assumed the \"to go\" didn't apply here as he was probably expecting a tip. I was still waiting for a glass of water and was halfway through eating the wrap before I was able to get his attention. He finally brought it. I quickly finished and awaited my bill - he seemed punctual in bringing the other tables their bills as they were wrapping up their meals. I waited about 15 minutes with an empty plate, trying to flag him for the bill - which I then decided to take it up to him at the counter and pay for the meal anyway.

In my summer in the Bay Area, I never once visited the \"only kosher restaurant in San Francisco.\"  Nope, it was kosher meat from Trader Joe's for me.  And yes, I passed this many a time, but just never had the urge to step foot in the restaurant.  \n\nHowever, when I had to go up to San Fran for work this week, I was meeting a friend with food allergies who suggested this place (since it would be guaranteed to not have any dairy products).  Okay, Israeli kosher food, I can deal.\n\nSabra is located at the edge of Chinatown and you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get there.  The ambiance is non-existent.  I've been to my fair share of zero-ambiance kosher restaurants, a result of having family in many Orthodox neighborhoods where \"kidproofing\" a restaurant is a much better investment than decor, but this seemed even worse.  It felt like I was in seminary at one of those Beit Midrashes (i.e. study hall at Yeshiva).  The tablecloths seemed jaded, and were covered in outdated Israel postcards with a layer of glass on top.  The artwork on the walls was a mish-mosh of Judaica.  And there were laminated numbers denoting the tables, which had metal-backed chairs that I only regularly see when I go to a shtiebel for High Holidays.  (Finally, a Yelp review where I can put my yiddish lingo to good use.)\n\nOkay, so we go up the stairs and sit down at one of the tables.  We get our menus.  Sandwiches are only for lunch or to-go, which was a bummer since this would have been a great option.  Oh well.  But a kebab?  Over $20!  Are you friggin' kidding me?  I go to my kosher meat market in West LA all the time, and a grilled-to-order kebab is $6 or less.  And even that has more ambiance than this place, so I can't say that I'm paying for atmosphere, as I may at an upscale locale.  \n\nSo we go through the menu.  Our third dining companion has a strong allergy to wheat, and couldn't have anything touching flour.  I know what you're thinking - one kosher gal, another allergic to dairy, and another flour.  It's like a joke waiting to happen, but given the menu, this place should have been quite accommodating - especially since they weren't serving sandwiches.\n\nThe waiter (dressed in a dirty tee and jeans) came to take our order.  I opted for the Shakshukah, which is an Israeli egg dish.  Oh wait, they're out of that.  Darnit.  Okay, I have to look back at the menu, since I refuse to spend $20 on a dish here.  The girl with the flour allergy orders an omelet, but asked not to be served the accompanying fries because she's hella allergic.  And stated and restated this at least five times to the dude.  No pita, no fries - kapiche?  The third one got schnitzel.\n\nSo then it's back on me to order.  I opt for the Shawarma, even though I think it's a ripoff.  But wait - waiter says - they don't actually cook this the way you do shawarma - on a rotating grill like a gyro.  No, this is just sauteed chicken.  WTF?!?!  Then don't call it shawarma.  Heck no, I ain't getting sauteed chicken - what is that even?  So I cave and order Melawach, which is a flaky Yemenite pastry I usually cook at home for under 50 cents a pop.  \n\nAs we order he asks if we'd like to start with an order of hummus and although it's also overpriced ($8) we say okay.  \n\nThe hummus never came.  The omelet came covered in the fries, despite that the diner belabored the point.  When she pointed this out to the waiter (who was the only guy covering the dining area), he just looked at her and was like \"is this really such a big deal?\" and returned with a plate to put the fries on... even though she explained that now she'd have to cut away all of the parts touching the fries.  The melawach was okay - it came with unseasoned minced tomatoes, though it traditionally also includes an egg of sorts which was missing.  So not worth the money.\n\nAnd then we get the check, a good 20 minutes after we asked.  Oh wait, they charged us for our nonexistent hummus.  Of course, we wouldn't known that had I not been able to read Hebrew, since that's what our order was written in with no English line-items.  I pointed this out and the waiter reluctantly removed the item.\n\nSo $45 for an omelet, a pastry topped in tomato, and a chicken cutlet.  In a place less comfortable than eating at a cubicle and with a rude waiter.  I've dealt with expensive restaurants (that are usually worth it), rude waitstaff, and unwelcoming restaurants.  But with that trifecta and mediocre (at best) food, the only reason I can see why this place is in business is because it's the. only. kosher. restaurant. in. San. Francisco.", "author": "Tamar F."}

The shawarma was just chicken with onions, since when is that Shawarma? The pita fell apart on me. \n\nEvery time I have walked into Sabra I felt as if they didn't want me their, the owner is extremely mean looking and the only redeeming quality is the guy working as a waiter is a nice dude, but the place is a shithole. You walk up creaky stairs and enter this restaurant that looks like a crack house and has the nerve to charge $27 for a steak and some rice. \n\nDon't give me that crap about SF not having kosher meat, save your money and go to the Kitchen Table in Mountain View if you want world class kosher food that is inexpensive. \n\nOh and you can only get a sandwich during lunch hours, get there too late and be forced to make all sandwiches into an overpriced platter.", "author": "Heshy F."}

We're kinda stuck.\n\nAnyway, an old friend of mine and I went last night. I had braced myself for the \"mean\" owner and \"bad food\", but it wasn't all that bad. First off, the owner is the one seating people, taking their orders and cooking the food. I can imagine there are times he isn't so happy. We weren't looking for any kind of special treatment, though. He didn't smile, didn't have much personality, but he answered questions, took our orders, and brought them out pretty quickly. I had the whole tilapia fish and it was just right. The fries were good, the hummus and tehini was excellent, and I was happy. \n\nI have to remind people that complain about the place: it's a kosher restaurant. The food is always exorbitant, the service is always horrible. I don't know where these folks have had kosher before, but I can't imagine why they all get so bent out of shape after coming here specifically.\n\nI will echo one post I saw here though: Don't come here if you don't keep kosher.

Had I read the reviews before coming here, I might not have tried, but my friend from LA eats only kosher, and thus I gave it a shot.\n\nThe place's decor is nothing to write home about. The place was completely empty save for maybe 1 table with people eating. \n\nWe each ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich, with a plate of fries to share. It was very very bland and untasty. The french fries were hot and fresh, but it didn't compensate for the utterly uninspired main course.\n\nFor this experience we were charged $24.00. The same food at a non-kosher restaurant would be about $15.00 and at least be tasty.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with Kosher restaurants, the prices are ALWAYS above market for ANYTHING, because of the additional expense of keeping a kosher kitchen.

It was served with French Fries that were equally as delicious. The tahini sauce that was served with the fried potato cigars was delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-14", "description": "Look, I always say that Israelis shouldn't be in the service industry outside of Israel. The mentality is different, simply put. Simply put, Yuval, the owner, comes off as a rude egotistical bastard to most Americans - because they are not used to the no-nonsense, straight-forward personality (but he is great - aka flirty - with women).\n\nFood-wise, it is so great to have Kosher food in the area. The Kosher certification (hasgacha kashrut) is provided by the Vaad haKashrut of California, and there is a mashgiach (religious overseer) on site at all times. Hummus, soup, shwarma (Israelis - this is really pargiot, not shawerma), al-ha-esh (grilled meat), Israeli salad ... all is good and decent to eat, especially when you consider what else we have in the area. Even the Arab restaurants don't come close on the food. The cost is a bit higher than I would like to see, but Kosher meat (even wholesale) and the certification is not cheap whatsoever - so the owner is just trying to cover his overhead.\n\nThe location would theoretically be alright, considering it is close to downtown and at the entrance of Chinatown. However, there are quite a few older Jewish patrons that find walking up a steep set of stairs not an easy feat. The interior is a good size, and I suggest sitting near the windows if you want to feel the vibrancy of the City while eating.\n\nOverall: Decent Kosher Israeli food in an area lacking other options.

I just went again yesterday to see if it was still wonderful, and yep, the matzo ball soup was just as I remember, the falafel was great, and I forgot about the plate of pickles - nice touch.

I had serious doubts as I entered the doors looking at the grimy walls and food spattered carpet....I was wanting some authentic middle Eastern cuisine....I'm certain the grease that my food was fried in could have been saved from the time of Moses it was SO old. The smells inside of this stuffy grungy eatery rival a machine shop think essence of crank case oil.  The pastrami was slimy yet dry...how does that happen? The waitstaff was really unfriendly....I felt like the plates were plunked down in front of us with grunting and grimacing....I miss the joy of having food around my Grandmother's table...the fresh cucumbers,tomatoes,home made yogurt....hospitality felt lost at Sabra Grill.  My husband worried about food poisoning....The food was grey looking...grey.", "author": "Sylvia B."}

In a city that's getting so far from real, with so many places sporting fake \"ambience,\" I appreciate Sabra's no frills authenticity. I totally love that it's kosher. And I am completely charmed that I have to go to Chinatown to get to an Israeli place.  I'm not a member of the tribe, but I've always been courteously and respectfully treated. The place is clean. I don't get attitude about avoiding meat. The falafel is awesome and so is the hummus. And the pickles. The pickles. The only time I eat all the pickles is when I go to Sabra.", "author": "Bibi R.

My wife is Jewish and we are always trying to top the falafel we had at a London flea market. The place looked creepy enough on the outside to be really good so we gamely mounted the stairs dragging my two 22ish sons along. We all piled into the plain little room and were glumly surveyed by the Yarmulke clad customers. The owner gave us dirty looks as the young waiter scurried about. The shy son returned to the stairs to avoid the stares. The three of us held our ground until the owner came over to get rid of us. We ordered a falafel to go to everyone's relief. I guess this is a private club. My wife understood the ranting of the owner to the waiter and felt sorry for the waiter. We made it back out to the street with our falafel and rated it about a 6 out of 10- kinda mushy, not a crispy enough shell on the balls. \nFunny though, this is one of the things we will remember and laugh about the most when we recall this trip to SF.", "author": "Rose C."}

What the hell is wrong with the citizens in this orb of numerous sustenance undertakings? This hidden Jerusalem den of delectable delights sits stoic and outside the usual fare right at the tail end of china town. So, anyone would figure, \" you order hummus when you're at the corner of pine and grant.....sounds like you were harnessing a surly temperament.\" Well, there you are: muerte incorrect. I could have been eating chancre sore laced hunan fried rice, or this lovely, impeccable falafel. It was the best falafel ive eaten in quite sometime. the pita was scorching, a marvelous additive along with dense, luscious, feathery, decadent hummus and, you guessed it, pickles without prompting. BAAAAAMM! that corpulent co-opted ass flounder Emeril would have been tres enthusiastic. A gorgeous, notable experience. Its kosher baby, so watch your trousers.", "author": "Christopher J."}

Probably the most unique dining experience I have had in San Francisco, with all the pious Jewish families with very young children in the small dining room (man, do my people know how to breed). And the pita bread. OMG the pita bread. If only they had pita like this where I grew up.", "author": "Brett L."}

The owner is a strange combination of New York Tough Guy and devout Orthodox Jew, but he knows how to stuff a pita.  I typically get the falafel and have also been blown away by the schwarma and the beef kebab..  ditto the baba ganoush (sp?) and hummus.\n\nExtra points for the sleepy rabbi in the corner.", "author": "Brad R."}

We had a chicken shwarma and okay, yes it's a little pricey but cmon it's downtown. And yes, they have a $10 minimum if you want to use a credit card but most items are around that much anyway. But the shwarma was excellent and let me tell you, I'm a very picky shwarma eater. They used fresh veggies, humus was excellent inside, the hot sauce was good and the chicken was cooked well. I'd def want to go back and try some of their other items.....not sure why everyone on here is hating on them so much. And the service, wasn't the greatest but wasn't bad either. The dude was just a little soft spoken and the service was top notch considering its a small tiny spot upstairs in Chinatown.", "author": "pankaj l."}
