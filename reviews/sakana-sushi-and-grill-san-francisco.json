I was able to make a reservation fairly easily through Yelp but it doesn't seem like it'd be too hard to get a spot even on a Friday night (there were people but still a quite a few spots open at the tables and bar).\n\nMy main issue with Sakana was the service. They were friendly but out of the 3 items I ordered, I had issues with 2 of them.\n\nI got the following items:\n1) Sashimi Omakase: My main entree. I actually ordered the Nigiri Omakase but they put in the wrong order. I didn't want to make a fuss and I didn't actually mind the mistake but it bothered me that I heard the waitresses talking about the mistake but they didn't ask me if it's alright. The omakase wasn't bad though. It was a daily special so I don't know the actual cost but I paid the $29 that the nigiri omakase cost (I asked the waitress about the price difference and she just said \"it's fine\"). My order came with 2 slices of each of the following: Toro, Tuna, Shiso & cucumber wrapped in ika, hamachi, hotate, and possibly suzuki or some other white fish. Texture-wise none of them had a fresh bite but they all had decent flavors still so the quality was pretty good overall. (3.75/5)\n\n2) Uni shot w/ jellied fish (golden eye snapper): Another daily special. A bit pricy at $7.50 but they do give a sizeable amount of uni. The uni had an initially bitter taste but it fades quickly into sweetness. The jellied fish was more like a cold fish broth that has slightly thickened. I wish they would have left some chunks of the snapper in there for more flavor and texture but overall it's a pretty decent shot besides the price (3.5/5)\n\n3) Yamaimo w/ Mentaiko: My 3rd item that they forgot until I reminded them. I enjoyed it quite a bit though. If you haven't had yamaimo there's a sticky almost mucus-y layer of film around the yam which I personally enjoy but it takes getting used to. It was cooked perfectly and still had a light crunch. The mentaiko packed the perfect salty spicy punch and it went well with the mellow yam. (4/5)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here and I would consider coming back if I'm in the area. It was a bit pricy but it is SF. I'm just a bit disappointed in the service since it wasn't too busy.", "author": "Vivian C."}

This place has 10ish tables with the sushi bar. We ordered sushi combination, chirashi, some nigiri and a couple of yakitori. After the first round, we ordered a few more rolls. Food is great, especially the quality of fish seems good. But, I wish roll shapes should be much firmer as good as the fish quality. Some rolls were stuck together and eventually rice and inside stuff became separated. And, an order paper was placed right above rolls when rolls came; I know the order paper was not filthy but I just don't want to \"see\" a paper sticking on my food.

Even though the sashimi was the favorite thing I ate, the fish didn't melt in my mouth, sadly. The kani su salad....well, it's exactly as it sounds. No good or bad surprises there. And lastly, the skewer. Do yourself a favor and don't order the skewer. The skewer itself doesn't have much meat (although it is only $3 I suppose), and I thought the sauce on top didn't compliment it well. That and the chicken was simply, very basically bland.\n\nI guess it's unfair to rate their business since I didn't get to try other (\"better\") foods, but still, the sashimi was just okay to me and the skewer was just....oy.\n\n+1 for their service - servers were great!

The 2nd night I went there, I had amberjack, amaebi, CA roll, ankimo, and a sushi combination. Everything was tasty but again, I just can't get enough of that CA roll!!! Service was excellent and the dishes came out fast. It's a little pricey but I think that's pretty standard in the area. When I come back to SF, I'll definitely visit.", "author": "Regina W."}

Turns out, the service was terrible and my rolls were a little sloppy. My server was inattentive and impossible to get a hold of. He wouldn't let me finish my sentence whenever I had the chance to talk to him. He didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink and I ended up asking for water after receiving my food. Also, I didn't find out that my menu had the wrong prices until I received my check. The waiter didn't apologize and simply said \"you didn't have an updated menu.\"\n\nOther than that, I think this place is reasonably priced for average sushi.

We were hesitant to check it out, but we thought we should give it a shot since it had decent reviews.  \nWe picked the tuna tataki for an appetizer.  Instead of being seared, it was almost cooked entirely through.  Edible, but definitely far from great.  There were very few special rolls to choose from.  We also ordered the dragon roll.  The avocado was not fresh - started browning.  The eel was not great either.  We also ordered salmon and toro nigiri.  The fish was subpar.

We let the chef choose our sashimi plate which seems to always work out well for us in most sushi joints.

Each one tasted as fresh and buttery as it looked too!  We enjoyed some of our favorites such as ankimo (monkfish liver), mackerel and uni.  The Tako Su salad (octopus, seaweed and cucumber) was made with real seaweed.  They serve sake in carafes here which was different, but it didn't matter.  The fill level seemed to rise with each new carafe.  -much appreciated Sakana!  \n\nAll this for extremely reasonable prices.  I don't think we went past $150.

I had their dinner combination with sashimi, tempura and hamachi kama. It was a simple and well prepared meal. The hamachi kama was particularity interesting. It was perfectly moist and tender inside. Definitely one of the better ones I had that came with a economic combo dinner. Tempura could be crisper but I like the light batter and light radish sauce. Sashimi is a standard fare. I don't find the fish quality particularly excellent. Some pieces even appeared a bit stringy. \n\nIf you are ever in the area for a late meal, can't go wrong with Sakana.", "author": "Mona W."}

We tried to raise our hand to ask the other waiter to come, he saw it, but he didnt give us any reaction.  We alomst wanted to leave. He had no smile at all. When we tried to point on the sushi that we wanted to order because we don't know how to pronounce, he said \"you just have to read it out, I won't see it\". Very mean. He also had a really bad breath, so it's really ruin our meal. I think he is Japanese with the tattoo on the arm. The other American guy seems more friendly, but he just left the menu and never come back. \n\nThe scallop carpaccio is a joke. 2 and a half scallop cut into 5 thin piece and charged over $10-$12 i believe. Only sea salt and olive oil with no plating as an appetizer.  Stay away from it. The rest of the sushi are ok, not really fresh or surprised. \n\nWe were so regret that we just spent about $100 here with this quality of food and the awful service. I think he really had a bad day. If you don't like to be serving customer,  you should just work inside the kitchen.  We don't deserve your bad attitude.\n\nWould never go back to this restaurant.  Hope you won't serve by this terrible Asian or Japanese tattoo waiter. \n\nAlso other customers mentioned that the chef touched his phone while he was making sushi, there was a picture to proof too.

Even though there was room at the bar we could've sat and then there were tables he could've sat us at... \n\n  About 10mins after we ordered they were out of something my friend order and instead of asking if he'd like to order something else, the waiter just said it and hastily walked away. There was an intense \"we don't want to be serving you right now\" vibe here. Kinda weird. Definitely would not come back or refer a friend here.", "author": "Crista R."}

There was only really one server, so things seemed to drag on. It took quite awhile for anyone to take our order and for our food to actually come out. Appetizers took much less time, but I guess because they want to serve all the rolls on one platter, so it takes longer. Anyway, none of us were in a real rush, so it was okay. The rolls were so pretty! Small. And pretty. But...small. \n\nThe jalapeno and tuna one has a nice kick to it, but my favorite was the caterpillar roll for the night. The bacon wrapped scallops weren't too salty, so that was a big plus. One gripe that I would have to bring up is that the tea is oversteeped, or too strong. And i drink a lot of tea. \n\nOverall, a nice spot, but I want to believe that there are more quality and bang for your buck places around the area.", "author": "Annie S."}

The sushi chefs are nice and chatted with us in Japanese. But I'm not gonna lie, their dirty t-shirts and tattoos made me slightly wary of what I was eating. The fish tastes old and the rice was cold. Tempura was okay but not quite crisp enough. Seaweed salad was nothing special.\n\nI wouldn't be back.

Since there's nowhere to wait, the server/host didn't mind us heading next door to Owl Tree for a drink while we waited. When we returned at the appointed time, our table was waiting.\n\nMy colleague went with a sampling of nigiri, a few selections at the recommendation of our server. One, I forget the name, was something we never heard of. I went with the hamachi nigiri, tuna bomb maki, saba gari maki, and spicy salmon maki. Everything was well made and fresh, not laden with rice nor skimpy on the fish. My favorite roll was the tuna bomb, I loved the slow heat from the chunks of deep fried jalapeno in the roll.\n\nAs others have said, Sakana is not trendy or sleek looking and the lighting is kind of unflattering; true to their words on the website - it is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall.

So my standards may be a little off when I say this is as good as any sushi I've ever had.\n\nIt was a good sign when the restaurant was full when we arrived.  No worries, they put us down for a 30-40 minute wait, which gave us some time to walk around the Union Square area and find a remedy for my friend's magnanimous chafing problem.\n\nWhat I was really excited about was the seasonal menu.  They had fish I haven't seen at any of the other sushi places I've visited, and even fish I hadn't even *heard* of!  I mean, what the hell is a \"bream?\"  I ordered one, though, and it was delicious.\n\nThe fish I was most concerned about?  Gizzard shad.  Isn't shad a baitfish?  I actually liked it, though.  Maybe I would enjoy life as a striped bass.\n\nAlso, the uni was tasty.  Another thing: apparently \"California Roll\" means something different here...

I went for dinner with a couple little ladies from my building, and we were able to grab a nice table by the window.  I was super hungry so I got the saba, tempura and sashimi dinner combination, which comes with miso soup and rice.  My miso soup was gone in seconds!  The sashimi was really fresh - totally enjoyed that.  The batter on the tempura was just slightly heavier than I like, but there was a nice variety of shrimp, squash, carrots, broccoli.  My saba was just slightly overcooked - I like it soft and fall-off-the-fork cooked, but the flavor was wonderful.  One of the ladies ordered the saba shioyaki, and there were quite a few bones that she had to pick out - not sure, if they meant it to be like that, but she was a little irritated.

Our other Japanese/ sushi Resturant  wasn't available so we decided to give this one a try. Our female server was pretty nice and friendly.  Got seated right away on a Saturday night. Compared to other type of Japanese food , you would expect sushi to be more pricey.  So we expected to be paying more. \n\nDecided to get a dragon roll and spider roll for myself while my boyfriend got a spicy tuna roll and some other roll I forgot.\n\nWhen we got sushi , the portion were kind of small, at least for my boyfriend. Mine was as expected for a normal dragon/spider roll.\n\nThe dragon roll was decent , but it wasn't anything super special about it. It was just avocado and bbq eel on top, not much special topping unlike some of other sushi Resturant .  Spider roll was kind of bland. Tasted like a shrimp tempura sushi but no sauce or anything in it. Kind of disappointed since other places made it more unique and tasty with their other sauce and topping.\n\nBoyfriend was really unsatisfied. No offense, it looked more like something you can easily make at home given the same seafood. Plus the portion were small.\n\nNot a bad place since server we got was friendly but considering price for the sushi , kinda expected something more with it compared to other sushi Resturant  with similar prices.  Food wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.  Maybe the other items were better ?\n\nI can see why people didn't like the male server. As we walked out the door , the female one said thank you and good bye. The male one just opened the door so he can let other customer in without saying a single word and gave a long stern face at us. Guess people might considered it mean and rude to some of other people.", "author": "Alice L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "Here's a TIP for this place: \n\nOverpriced; I've had better quality sushi for less in San Francisco. I don't have food poisoning, but I felt worse after I left. \n\nWhen I got my rolls, I could tell right away just by looking at the food that it wasn't going to be good. Seeing that this place has a 4.2 rating, I was really disappointed. The rolls were served on this DIRTY red platter; there were marks that didn't come from the sushi. Seriously? Make sure your platters are clean before you serve them, that's disgusting. I couldn't trust that my plate was clean the whole time I ate.\n\nThe presentation alone deserves a 1/5--it was clumped together and very basic. I have never seen sushi rolls made so sloppy and messy, it was appalling to me. I payed double as much to have half as much rice and fish as I usually do at other places, which is one of the reasons I will not be returning.\n\nThe rice wasn't the ordinary round, fluffy sushi rice, which is the core of great sushi; this is what they lacked when they served regular Chinese food quality rice. I am picky about my rice because that is 50% of the sushi. The fish was average, again I've still had fresher, chewier, raw fish for less in SF--also, they give very little portions that is was embarrassing. Although I ordered two rolls, which would usually leave me full, I was not at all satisfied when I left.\n\nThis place sucks. Sakana definitely does not deserve my return. Lastly, the customer service was awkward. The waiter, this tall white guy, who seems to be the owner, never said \"Hi\" and \"Thank you\". Shouldn't you know better if you're the owner? He would be monotone, not at all energetic and answered either 'yes' or 'no'. He never came back to check on me. \n\nThe waiter only cares about getting your money and making sure you paid your meal. \n\nTake your money somewhere else. I recommend Sushi Zen in the Sunset district; Kabuto in the Richmond district; Sushi Zone in the Hayes Valley neighborhood; Ebisu on Irving Street,", "author": "Natalie Charlotte W."}

So I was very pleasantly surprised that Sakana, in the heart of the Tenderloin, had not only a great izakaya menu but also fantastic fresh sushi! \n\n- Salmon skin salad - usually the salmon skin has to be crispy to be edible, but they did a great job grilling the skin with some flesh left, with picked carrot and greens. Loved it\n- Ankimo - you can tell when monkfish liver is not super fresh. Sakana's was great quality and more volume than expected, so delicious\n- Gindara glazed w miso - so tender and delicate and delicious. Two smaller fillets but sooo good\n- Yamaimo mentaiko ae - spicy cod roe with the mountain yam (kind of slimy like okura but has texture of jicama and lighter delicate taste), really yummy.\n\n- Sushi - we asked what was good today and they suggested the chikame-kintoki (which I cannot figure out English name... it sounded like an italian name if that helps). Very fresh. We also had the kanpachi (amber jack) and ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) which also comes out with the delicious fried head. Blanking on another sushi that was equally good.\n- Roll - my friend ordered the 49ers roll which is California roll with salmon and lemon on top, surprisingly delicious\n\nAs others have mentioned, it is a small place, and we took the last two seats at the bar as walk ins at 6:45. They seem to take reservations, and many people who tried to walk in were turned away on a Tues night.\n\nService is great, both in and outside the bar.

Salmon is really fresh and it's just super good. It was my sister's favorite. \n- Rock n' roll (($5.50 - $6 for 6 pieces, bbq eel + avocado): This is also amazing if you love eel. I love eel and I wasn't disappointed. Definitely very good. \n- Spider Roll ($9 for 5 pieces, soft shell crab roll). This one is definitely very pricey. But it has that amazing fried taste.

We could have just eaten the tuna appetizer all night; it was delicious, and the tuna melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The rolls were compact but flavorful and fresh; the hamachi with scallions and seared eel with avocado were particular favorites.  Although we're not vegetarians, I thought they featured an impressive selection of vegetarian rolls; we ordered an asparagus roll, and enjoyed it very much.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be one of those places that serves showy, large, mayo-covered novelty \"sushi\" rolls.

Said it again louder, and finally got a response from the sushi chef.  I used to come here once a week, but enough is enough.

We walked in and were seated immediately which was great but after that the whole experience went downhill. We waited for like 15/20 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order which was pretty frustrating. The restaurant was very loud and it really felt like the couple sitting next to us were actually sitting with us. I mean I heard everything that they talked about on their first date. Finally we placed our order and waited for our sushi to arrive with extreme anticipation. The food prep took a bit longer than expected but once it arrived we began to grub. Unfortunately the sushi quality was lacking there is nothing I hate more than eating warm sushi and that is what was served.

We were seated promptly as we had reservations; however, had to wait forever before we were waited on.  Ordered the wakame salad, spicy tuna, and a few nigiris to start off (toro, ebi, yellow tail, grouper...) - the wakame salad was eh, spicy tuna was decent but i've had much better, the nigiris were the biggest disappointment (lacked that fresh taste and the rice was soggy and fell apart). I actually spat out the toro as it tasted weird - felt worse after looking at the check - did i really spit out $5????\nWe were still hungry but decided not to risk any further let down.  Sakana will not be a repeat visit -  service is lacking and there is nothing spectacular about their food either. I'd recommend walking over to Ryoko's (a bit of a wait for obvious reasons), Sanraku, or Sushi Rika.", "author": "Bhavnak K."}

Good selection of appetizers.\n6. Their sushi rice is good (good acidity level)\n7. Their Katsudon has soft cooked eggs with light broth.

Tenpura include American sweet potato not Japanese sweet potato.  Big difference...\n2. Daikon on Chirashizushi.  To take up the space?  I never saw that in Japan...\n3. Sashimi and Chirashizushi's fish is sliced not nicely.  Look like leftover pieces... I guess I cannot complain at this price... but the way you cut/slice fish is VERY VERY VERY important.  Fish taste different depend on how they are sliced (cutting into the muscle fiber? Etc). Also bigger piece you chew longer, vs smaller pieces you chew less... and fish tastes different depends on how long you chew it.  I can write another essay on this subject as well.\n4. Their Donburi dishes do not come with Oshinko/Tsukemono (pickled vegetable) on the side.\n\nOverall I'll give Sakana 3.64 stars\n\nOh, unrelated to Sakana but I have a question....

Between the two of us we always spend about $80-100 on a dinner here for a few rolls and some sashimi. \n\nAnyways, tonight we walk in looking for a couple of quick rolls and they won't seat us because they say that we don't tip them enough! They made us leave! I've never been treated this way and will never go back (even if I could). Stay away from this place, the staff is beyond rude and judgmental.", "author": "Cody W."}

I hate it when the fish can't be cut in half with a simple bite or with your chopstick because there is some stringy tendon muscle action in the fish. This is what happened with my piece of maguro. \n\nAlso, I tried the fried squid since other Yelp reviewers raved about it. Sorry but I was really disappointed. The squid was way too crunchy for me and there were way too many tentacles. I think if they cut the squid into smaller pieces and if the texture was more chewy then I might like it.", "author": "Helen Y."}

These guys shouldn't do business like that. I came with my friend. We were the only patrons so far in the restaurant; yet, we still waited 10 minute before: enter the server, a Japanese guy, who came to our table to take our order. This would have been a pleasant surprise if not for his completely unprofessional manners. While most servers will wait pen and pad on hand for the order, he actually sat his ass down on the table next to us, peering down without a sound waiting for us to accommodate him  with our order. So, my friend began to order. Stop. Done with their order. Now, on to me! Stop. Where is he going? At this point, the server completely forgot (good God I assume forgot) to take my order. Maybe the server this day was new and untrained and completely not ready for the floor. Or, maybe he was being spiteful and wanted to simply piss us off. Either way, no establishment should affect any of such reactions out of their patrons. We ended up walking out before we were even served. I suggest avoiding this mess altogether and by not ever even walking in.", "author": "Iris C."}

The sashimi was fresh and the presentation was nice.  I came here with a party of  7 and we over ordered (as usual) so we got to try a huge chunk of the menu, which was a plus.  The rolls were just pretty average and simple to me, but still good I guess, as was the sake.  Still, nothing special though.\n\nMy only big complaint was the service.  Our waiter was rude and wasn't very helpful either and frankly seemed very impatient with us.  We also had to ask for refills of water and tea almost each time it ran low or completely out.  \n\nMaybe cause there's an automatic 20% service fee to the bill for parties of 5 or more so he figured he can just slack off?  Perhaps, but who knows.  All I know was that the service was not up to par and for that experience, I don't really care to come back.", "author": "Carmen Y."}

The stained walls, the gritty interior, the relaxed waiters and the despondent cook.\n\nStill, it opens until 1 AM on weekends, so it seemed like our last opportunity for food in the area.\n\nI made a wise call and chose a Dragon roll for my self and a Scorpion roll for my guest that night. (On a place were hygiene is lacking, raw fish may not be the wisest choice).\n\nYes... The dragon roll was grayish in color. All of it. The avocado was not green, was gray. The eel was not golden brown, it was gray,. Heck, even the side ginger was yellowish gray instead of pink. It was all a colorless mess. The slices were three times the usual thickness, no doubt not maintain the soggy rice from suspiciously falling apart, but alas, making it not suitable for any mouth (Not a gentle one anyways). On the side, a careless squirt of mysterious sauces was laid the way a hot dog would have mustard and ketchup. No elegant patterns,, no discrete amount. Lots of it, so to make the flavor at least defined in one direction.\n\nMy companion's Scorpion roll did not fare much better. The slices again huge... The tempura deep-fried crab was soggy  instead of crunchy.\n\nI really should have stand up up and left when facing such unforgivable fare (will not do the favor of calling it \"sushi\")... But in a masochistic way, I wanted to confirm it tasted as bad as it looked.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nYes, I can not have a framework of reference on how sushi is not mean to be... A barometer for the lowest of the low.\n\nNow that i experimented such depths in your behalf, save yourself the trouble. Have a boiled burger instead. Tastes the same and it will be much cheaper.", "author": "David G."}

When I walked in the restaurant was only about a quarter full. The server was nowhere to be seen and the sushi chef looked up at me but then continued working. After standing by the door for about a minute waiting to be seated, I gave up and just sat down at the nearest table and grabbed a menu. Then, finally, the server finally came out to greet me. He returned to the back and came back out with two glasses of water. \n\nWait. \n\nWATER? I was surprised to not get tea automatically at a Japanese restaurant run by Japanese people. When I asked for tea instead he took back the water. Another bummer... I wanted both :(\n\nWe ordered 11 items but he didn't write any of it down. I'm not a big fan of that practice because I always worry they'll forget something. And sure enough, he did. But it was ok because I got a free roll out of it!\n\nThe highlights were definitely all the cooked items from their Appetizer section. The rolls were decent but nothing you can't find elsewhere, same goes for the sushi (except for the uni - it tasted fishy. Blech!)\n\n- ANKIMO (steamed monkfish liver with ponzu) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ): DELICIOUS! I love, love, love liver! Very good flavour and creamy texture. The ponzu paired really well with it too and helped cut the richness. Loved the shiso leaf garnish too.\n- TSUKUNE (skewer of ground chicken balls with shiso leaves) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=XHMZ9lDQMJSpMykaA1AD9g): more shiso, yay!\n- YAMAIMO MENTAIKO (sliced mountain potato with spicy cod roe) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=svxHezlVzIoq3YB2o6wZ6A): this was unexpected, but good. The potatoes are raw so they gave a nice crunch. Not much flavour to them but that's what the cod roe was for. Very generous portion of roe too, which was awesome!\n- GINDARA MISOYAKI (grilled silver cod marinated in miso) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=ucB7oXB666lySmNXHWgnnQ): also very good and a generous portion. Can't go wrong with miso cod :)\n- GESO FRY (fried squid legs) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=4QO_kHhubVrk1GlgzqdSXA): good.\n- NIGIRI (salmon, uni, kanpachi, ikura) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=HCmjSofKflsyeRqBo4lvLw, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=kLDJTAGJ5dCeqYqNvvZzQw): salmon and kanpachi tasted fresh. Uni did not. Blech! Which sucked even more at $7 an order. Ikura wasn't that great either.\n- ROLLS (California, spicy tuna, Rock N Roll) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=8FOCxXKaC194jhNWGARESA, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shGrK3zfITUUY4SsqKk_Bg?select=wOYVz_MIaJojZQZWJtkRoQ): decent.

And when I say \"enough times\" I mean that I work in the neighborhood and eat here 2-4 times a month. So much so that they know my voice on the phone. \n\nAnd it's ALWAYS good, no matter whether I'm eating in or taking out. I've tried a handful of things on the menu and it's delicious across the board. I have my favorites when it comes to sushi and tend to stick them. What can I say, it's a comfort food kind of thing. But I do tend to judge places on their hamachi. And the hamachi negi roll is at Sakana is my absolute favorite. It has a fresh and beautifully balanced flavor. I also love the spicy tuna roll - a wonderful bite without being too spicy to layer some wasabi flavor in there. \n\nTonight in particular, was such a wonderful experience that I thought to myself \"the world needs to know...\" Now it's one thing to have delicious food and fantastically reasonable prices (the main reason that I am always recommending Sakana to anyone I know in the area) but it's the service that really pushed it to the top. The staff is always friendly, calm and attentive even during busy times. Tonight I walked in and decided to sit down during my 30 minute break instead of calling ahead for take out. Already knowing what I wanted (and would love), I ordered as I sat down at the counter, thinking that it would take 5-10 minutes to make, giving me enough time to eat, pay and walk back to work. I settled into watching the sushi chef in his zone, rolling, slicing, plating. And then, to my surprise he handed me the plate. He must have heard me order as I sat down. The food was delicious, as always, and I had time to savor it instead of rushing through. Then, as I finished and started to gather my things together to get going, the server was there with my bill. The best part? Everyone said good-bye as I headed out the door. I'll admit, I was a little jealous of the people who had just sat down around me because I was leaving and their meal was just beginning. \n\nBut that's okay, because I know it's only a matter of time until I'm back.", "author": "Maggie F."}

I commend the server for really taking care of us. I wish I got his name (note to self) especially since I plan to do these reviews more often. He was very attentive, but non-invasive and seemed to really care about our dining experience. I wanted a variety of fish so I ordered the Chirashi (or as a friend calls it \"the dog bowl of sashimi\") - I mentioned that I loved unagi and maguro, so the server noted to the chef that I was \"eel-and-tuna-friendly.\" I had never heard that before, so when I received my dish, I was pleasantly surprised with the extra eel and excellent quality tuna! The same deal for my hubby too - he wanted albacore instead of maguro, so the server checked with the chef and said \"no problem.\" Jotted down \"shiro-maguro-friendly\" and sure enough, he got albacore instead of maguro. It was wonderful! Another nice surprise was the complimentary green tea at the end of our meal. I often have tea after I eat at home, so that was a nice bonus. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 (really it's a 4.5) is the sushi rice was not the best I've had.

This is hands down the best sushi I've ever had, and it's some of the least expensive sushi I can imagine.  I've eaten to the point of getting full for $20.  I've also taken BF and sat at the bar and asked Vance (the super cool sushi dude) to keep it coming with all the good stuff till we said stop--that cost about $45/head with beers and sake.\n\nWhen you read my rating of 5 stars, let me clarify that it is all about the food.  The ambiance isn't memorable by any means, and it's one of those places you could probably wear sweatpants to and get away with it.  The music is played at a pretty low volume, so it's really just enough to dull out the sound of passing cars.\n\nThat being said, though, the food is to die for.  Every single piece of fish is rich, delicious, melt in your mouth yumminess.  The fish is cut perfectly, so you can take a bite of your sashimi and it doesn't get all stringy on you.\n\nThis place doesn't have a big selection of rolls aside from basic staples like the rainbow roll or caterpillar roll, but when you have fish as amazing as Sakana does, it seems criminal to adulterate it with mayonnaise-y sauces, gunky additions, tempura this or that, just too much STUFF.  If you do like rolls, the crispy roll is quite delicious.  For me, sushi is all about the quality of fish (I've grown to be a big fan of straight up sashimi and nigiri), so the lack of a roll selection doesn't bother me a bit.\n\nThe service is great, regardless of whether you sit at the sushi bar or at a table (I prefer the bar, honestly, but that goes for any sushi place).\n\nIf you have a special occasion but want to celebrate it casually, this is your spot.  I've only been living in the city about 4 months now, and I've already gone 4 times.  I can't wait for my next visit...", "author": "Ashley S."}

Would be nice if they were on OpenTable.\n\nWe started with bacon wrapped scallops (two skewers, with two on each skewer) and hamachi kama. Delicious! You really can't go wrong if you wrap *anything* with bacon and grill it. Seriously so good. The hamachi kama was also grilled to perfection.\n\nFor dinner, I had the tuna bomb (spicy tuna with jalapenos), an eel roll w/ cucumber, cuttlefish nigiri, and opal eye nigiri. The rolls were both really good. Don't worry about the japapenos, they weren't that spicy, but did add nice flavor, texture, and color. I was really bummed they didn't have any toro, so I decided to try some new things that aren't usually on the menu at other sushi places. The cuttlefish was interesting, but kinda rubbery. A bit like calimari, but a sheet of it. I asked the waiter about the opal eye and he said it was similar to yellowtail.

A Japanese meal suffices. I head to Ryoko, but the sushi restaurant had another 45-minutes to welcome their first customer of the evening. Fine. I spot Sakana opened for business. The menu prices looked decent, and my sushi hooker was the ume offering.\n\nThe nigiri or sashimi specials are flown in from Japan, and the ootoro is from Europe. I ordered the saury/sanma in the nigiri form, but the chef mistakenly gave me several slices of sashimi. No problem because the light fish was moist and delicious. I then ordered the fresh scallop carpaccio. And instead of succumbing to the deal-breaking ume maki, I found an appetizer made of 2 of my most favorite Japanese veggie options: slimy mountain root potato and ume. I nabbed the shiso leaf that came with the sanma sashimi and wrapped several chopped sticks of the mountain root potato, dowsed in ume, and savored every bite. To top off the stomach like you used to top off your tank at the gas pump, I ordered a roll of the spicy tuna. No mayo required because they roll slices of jalapeno for that spicy kick. Yum.\n\nAnd what is this I spy in the fish bar? Half open face baby abalone from Santa Barbara. Wholly moley! I immediately text my friend about this wonderful find because he still has to make up for that time for being so oblivious to the available fresh abalone at Domo. \n\n(This one time at Domo, my friend was wallowing in his overly dramatic girlfriend sorrows, and I was watching the chef cut open this huge Farallon Island abalone, caught hours prior by his adventurous diver friend. The chef had no intentions of selling it. I was thinking, \"OMG, we may just get a bite of that abalone expensive sucker for free.\" At the time, my friend was in no mood and wanted to go home ASAP. I begrudgingly obliged. When we left, I mumbled how we missed an opportunity of a lifetime. And all this time, he was oblivious to the abalone in front of him.) Well, I stumbled upon the holy abalone shrine. My friend better make it up to me at Sakana by shoving abalone down my throat. Just typing this story out on Yelp makes me so excited! I think the springs on my desk chair are about to bounce off too!\n\nThe restaurant appears rather new, as it moved a few buildings down from its original location, not too long ago. The ambient and hip music selection is pleasing to the ear. The wine list, though...is pretty dismal. A single glass of Chardonnay from Beringer for $6. The Chardonnay obviously did no justice to the fresh fish. I will not ding them for the lack of wine options. Next time, I will try the heavily promoted Koshihikari Echigo beer, a fine rice microbrew direct from Japan, so says the cardboard promoter.

According to him, this is where Ichiro eats when he's in town. \n\nAs others have stated, there's never a wait here, which is perfect when you're looking for a bite to eat before a show at the Post Street Theatre. We were seated at 7:00, out the door at 7:50 and in our theatre seats before 8:00. Our favorites.\n\nShiro Maguro\nToro\nAji no Tataki (not on the menu, but ask for it)\nScallops wrapped in Bacon\n\nThey will ask you if you'd like the fish body (part of the Aji no Tataki presentation) fried. Say yes! It's crispy goodness.\n\nPerhaps this is a model of Japanese efficiency and presentation in action: all our food arrived quickly with a pretty and simple presentation.", "author": "Theda E."}

Neutral colors and high ceilings give this space a clean and spacious feeling.  \n\nAt first glance, the menu carried a lot of small plates, your standard Teriyaki/Tonkatsu combos, and nigiri and rolls at end.  The small plates were good; the bacon wrapped scallops were by far the tastiest item we tried.  The yakitori however was dry and cold.  We also tried the yamaimo (mountain potato) salad with ume dressing (good), shiromaguro tataki with a garlic ponzu sauce served over baby lettuce (eh, mediocre), ohitashi (standard), and the dragon roll (temp shrimp on the inside topped with eel and avocado).  \n\nIn all reality, the experience would have been fine but the server butchered our order (we didn't order the shiromaguro tataki; and the katuo tataki we had ordered never came) and the dragon roll took 1 hour (seriously) to arrive at our table.  The server nanchalantly pointed out (but never apologized) for the tataki mistake and brought the dragon roll out AFTER I had asked for the bill (no apology or acknoledgement that we had been sitting there for half an hour with NOTHING in front of us).  \n\nI suppose for the price, it would be hard to find a place that offers good Japanese 'izakaya' style items but I highly suggest avoiding this place during peak hours.  Perfect place if you're low on dough and need a Japanese fix.", "author": "William R."}

The food here is absolutely nothing more than grocery store sushi.  \n\nAn Omikase plate brought imitation crab meat california roll with 6 pieces of either Wasabi overwhelmed Nigiri, or a rather bland eel.  I didn't try the raw shrinp because it looked a little slimy, and therefore sketchy....not to mention a recent raw shellfish experience that caused a wicked day after.  All that I can say about the fish, therefore is that it was so bland, it needed to be drowned in wasabi to hide the apparent lack of flavor.  \n\nThe Miso soup was bland and poorly made, with a lot of filtrate and no flavor, heavy on the supersoft tofu.  And the seaweed salad was a pasable but nothing extraordinary dyed green out of a bag variety.\n\nThe only plus was a beer allegedly from a Japanese microbrewery that wasn't terrible (but it also came in a bottle) and a decent unfiltered Sake.

I suggest we grab something quick from Bristol farms before we pass out and are subject to the hands of the unforgiving mall kiosk workers and all their low price scams, when it hits us like a ton of bricks - let's get sushi! As we all know, or you should know, Tuesday is the best day for sushi. Why? Fresh delivery. Please, people, do not eat sushi on a Sunday and then proceed to write a bad review for the restaurant, it's not their fault! No fresh deliveries!\nSo here we are in the dungeon of the Westfield shopping center, and I bust out the phone and Yelp sushi places around us. Sakana pops up, and highlights reviews for their lunch specials. Let's go! We walk up past Union Square and find our lovely little hole in the wall restaurant completely devoid of any customers. Bad sign? Nah, it's 2:30pm on a Tuesday, we just missed the lunch crowd and no one's eating dinner yet. We seat ourselves at the sushi bar, take a quick glance at the menu, I order a beer and we each order the $9 roll combo (your choice of two rolls plus miso soup). Simple and quick, salmon and spicy tuna for me, spicy tuna and rock n roll for my friend. \nBEST tasting raw fish I have ever eaten. \nLike butta. \nThe tuna was marinated nicely, the salmon was so smooth, and I was so jealous I didn't order the eel roll for myself, because hot damn it was delicious.\nThe chef was nice and holding conversation with us while we ate, waiter checked up on us, but really we didn't need anything outside of what was put in front of us already.

The next time I was in the area, I decided to give it a try instead of going to Ryoko. We walked in and were seated by the window. Everything I ordered was a treat for my tastebuds.  I had the tsukune (ground chicken with shiso leaf) which did not disappoint this shiso leaf-fiend! I also got the bacon wrapped scallops recommended by the server which was a great choice (hard to go wrong with bacon and scallops!). Ok, I'm more of a tofu fiend so I also had the agedashi tofu which was tasty until I mixed in the horseradish. From their specials, I tried the amberjack fish from japan which was fresh and only $4.80 for two nigiri pieces. My boyfriend ordered the tonkatsu dinner which was perfectly fried and came with yummy ponzu sauce. I can't wait to come back to try the yamaimo sengiri (sliced mountain potato) and the carpaccio.

I came is one other person and there was already a couple in line before us who had been waiting a while. So four people - two groups. Easy math. We waited 30 minutes and the other couple had been there longer. There were two tables - each with two seats - right next two each other. A while later 4 people came in together and he sat them immediately at the two tables (pushed together) . I asked what was going on - the two tables could have just been split to separately seat the two parties already waiting for a LONG time. No explanation. He simply said \"I can do what I want please leave the restaurant\"! Completely psycho off the wall attack for no reason other than me politely questioning his logic or lack thereof.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-18", "description": "the best thing about this place, was that it was open late. so awesome. my friends and i had finished watching watchmen in imax and was roaming around the city just wondering what to do next. my sister said she could go for sushi and the two friends who lived in the city guided us to this area. it was about 11PM i think. i think they're open until like 2AM. i hate it when you go do something in the city and the only thing open are bars and clubs. egh. so we ordered a few rolls and nigiri. the spider roll was just OK. i think my sister liked her maguro nigiri. we also had some other tuna dishes - which were a bit TOO flavourful - masking the taste of the yummy raw tuna. haha. like i said, the best thing about this place is that it's open late. i'd go back again if i was in the city and was looking for a place to eat at midnight.", "author": "Karen K."}

That impression was proved correct. It's a little hole-in-the-wall space with a sushi bar and a few tables, and a menu that's half sushi, half basics (some noodles, tempura, that sort of thing). My first suggestion is that whatever the day's specials are, try them. Toro was listed as a special, and it ranked up there on par with the best I've ever had - the fish just melted in the mouth, and had a magnificently rich flavor halfway between tuna and butter. Prices are reasonable for sushi (most nigiri runs $4.25). My only complaint was that the tempura had too much batter. It was light and crisp, but there was a bit more on my veggie tempura appetizer, and on the spider roll crab, than there should have been. But it was neither greasy, nor thick and heavy.", "author": "Don H."}

It took a short 5 minutes with a swift turn here, a quick dash there to beat the approaching yellow checkered Visigoths, and i was knocking on Sakana's door. The place was sparsely populated and I was quickly ushered to a window side table where I brushed aside the menu and honed in on  the rolls.. After a moment's pause to survey the options, my stomach urged me to consider a rainbow roll and a spider roll (though I would have loved to sample the species\" imported from Japan\" as listed on the board) I eventually gave in to my regular cravings and ordered a rainbow and spider roll. Both were quite gratifying  to a sushi starved tongue, but I'm afraid my moment of passion might have been colored by the sushi drought of the last couple of months. All said though, it was a pleasant fishing experience.. hai!", "author": "Getafix O."}
