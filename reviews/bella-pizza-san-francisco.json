But with this pizza, the tip of the triangle seemed to sink and I needed to hold up the end of the pizza to eat it. \n\nMaybe it was because the pizza was a big slice or maybe because there were too many toppings on it. I ate this one pizza with mushrooms and some other topping that I don't remember. But there wasn't an even balance of mushrooms and... that other topping. It was just a lot of mushrooms which is probably why I don't remember what else was on that particular pizza. I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms but if you put it in front of me, I'll eat it.

However, i would only recommend that you get 2... maybe 3 toppings on the pizza as it may overwhelm your taste buds with such great flavor that u dont kno wtf u are putting into your mouth anymore. one thing i do that ive learned from master yoda ray lew, is that u can replace the regular tomato paste sauce with PESTO. pizza is damn near 2x better made this way; it is also less messy and melty, actually looks like pizza har har har. overall, i would recommend this place for anyone having a night in, game night, or simply a quick dinner. pizza is huge, toppings are pumped full of flavor, a 2 topping extra large pizza runs about 13 bucks with \"invisible\" coupon + tip, which is like 15-16dollars for a very big pizza pie, capable of serving 4-5 very hungry people.", "author": "simon k."}

I think maybe it's because either service is soo darn friendly. maybe it's the attractive lady that rings me up at the counter. Cant really identify the real reasons why. \n\nThe pizza selection is average. A typical range of topping selections adorn the menu and then you read a bit farther. They have Pasta and Calzones, oooh! I have had their pizza many times so I went out on a limb and tried their Fettuccine Alfredo. Wow! Way to much garlic. I felt bad for the people on the Muni Bus on my ride home, as I am sure that I was seeping pungent garlic stench through every pore on my skin. The garlic was soo overpowering that I had to give away my lunch to the local moocher. You know, every office has one. the person who asks if you are \"going to finish that?\". Thankfully this guy didn't care about the essence of garlic that was emanating from my floor as soon as you stepped from the elevator. \n\nWith all that said, I still get a slice or two for lunch every once in awhile. Their slices are really big, so value is definitely a plus. I just wish they wouldn't pre-sauce their dough so I could get no red sauce and substitute for pesto. The tomato sauce they have is a bit acidic. Knowing this I still order. \n\nI guess the theme to this review is I am still not sure why I frequent this place. is it the convenience or the cute lady? Could be both? Either way, the pizza is average and this is the reason for a three star review. Your results may vary as I have always had lunch here, never dinner.", "author": "Anderson C."}

I don't know what it was, but I was quite pleased.  \nTHEY HAVE THE BEST GROUND BEEF.  Order spaghetti and meatballs, meatball pizza or the hamburger sub.  So so good.  I really like just the plain dinner salad.  The lettuce is always crisp and cold, they put some tomatoes and some olives and pepperoncinis on it, get blue cheese dressing on the side, it's delicious.  The pasta dishes are pretty good, and the appetizers are all fine, pretty typical greasy snacks.  \n\nAlso, they have really really cheap pitchers of Bud.  On weeknights Steve would order one with two glasses, pour some into each glass, and then switch back and forth between them, so it wouldn't look like he was drinking two pitchers of beer all by himself with his pizza.  \n\nAnd they have orange soda in cans.  Which is what I like.\n***The cops from the 6th Ave station eat here.  My dad always told me that you wanna eat where the cops eat.", "author": "melissa r."}

Whenever I receive ads, I always figure that the place needs help with their business, but I checked the reviews on Yelp, and their food sounded like it was pretty good.\n\nTheir pizza was good.  I ordered a small, and it was your typical pizza, although their crust was a little thin on the bottom, so it got a bit soggy after sitting in the box five minutes.  The actual taste was pretty good, though.  Inside the box, I also found two little containers of parmesan cheese and crushed pepper. :)\n\nI also ordered the buffalo wings.  They were a bit disappointing.  Their wings aren't the bbq kind, in case you're into the kind with bbq sauce.  They're slightly spicy, so that was good for me.  (I don't like it when the spiciness kills your tastebuds.)  The major problem I had was the SIZE!  I ordered six, and they looked like they were from a cornish game hen or something.  Definitely not meat-filled, if that's what you're looking for.  On the plus side, they also came with some buttermilk ranch dressing.  Good taste.\n\nI ordered their caesar salad, and that was a bit disappointing.  It tasted kind of like it just had plain Italian dressing on it with some parmesan cheese mixed in and croutons on top.  They didn't give much salad either. :[\n\nLastly, I also had their fries.  Yes, fries from a pizza place.  What can I say?  I was really in the mood for some fries.  Their fries were kind of typical diner fries..  Greasy....  Didn't have much salt on them, but at the time I was really craving fries, so they did hit the spot.  They weren't dry or anything, which was good.  They gave me four packets of ketchup to go with my fries, which was way more than enough for me.\n\nIf you're looking mainly for pizza, then yes, the pizza is good.  Anything beyond that was only so-so, although the flavor was good, the portions seemed a bit skimpy..  Luckily, I got filled up on the fries, one buffalo wing, a few bites of salad, and a slice of the pizza, but if you only order a salad or just an order of buffalo wings, you're going to be left hungry.\n\nFor someone who's not picky, though, and was craving certain tastes, I did get the tastes I wanted. :)", "author": "Keiko N."}

Excellent customer service over the phone as well.", "author": "n m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-05", "description": "This is one of my favourite pizza places.  It's cheap and it's mmm mmm good.  We always get the extra large with half meatballs and pepperoni (for the boy) and half green olives and broccoli (for me) and it lasts us 3 meals.  I've never eaten there but the delivery is fast, the crust is nice and soft and it tastes great reheated the next day.  Actually I think it's even better the next day when the crust gets a bit crispier.  Also, they aren't stingy with the cheese and toppings and the sauce tastes fresh and tomatoey.  I also enjoy their mozzarella cheese sticks and like the fact that if I crave lasagna with fries (which I sometimes do) I can get it there.  Their lasagna is huge, their pizza is huge, they are so cheap and have coupons.  They have never let me down.  I love you Geary Street Pizza/Bella Pizza.", "author": "Dee K."}

I called Geary Street Pizza and ordered a pie for delivery.  The woman on the phone said that it would take 45 minutes to an hour to get here, and because of these very positive reviews, I said sure, it's worth waiting for.\n\nOne hour and 15 minutes later, no pizza. So I called the place to check in, and the nice woman said that it would be here in another 15 minutes.  She did not apologize... OK, I was a bit irked, but these things happen.\n\n20 minutes after THAT, she called me to say that the driver had delivered my pizza to someone else, and did I want that other person's pizza.   I asked where the driver was, and she said it would be another 5 minutes.  By this time I was ravenous, but didn't trust her time promises a whole lot.  btw AGAIN she did not apologize! I said forget it, hung up and whipped myself up a nice omelet, which I just finished.\n\nSorry to leave such a bad review for this obviously beloved place, but this was really too much.  Maybe their pizza is wonderful, and I will try it sometime, but not via delivery...", "author": "dan l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-14", "description": "This is perhaps my favorite pizza place..EVER. The first time I tried it was probably back in 2006 and my boyfriend and I have been frequent customers ever since.The service is friendly and if you go there often the waitresses will pretty much have your order memorized.\n\nAppetizers: Pretty cheap. I recommend the garlic bread and mozzarella sticks as basic starters.\n\nMain Course: Most people go here for the pizza so of course  it's the best thing on their menu. Their dough is very tasty on it's own complimented very well with their yummy red sauce. I usually get a slice of West Coast which is basically just BBQ chicken, prosciutto, mushrooms and their red sauce. Their Greco Special is quite delicious as well if you like Pesto sauce and Feta cheese. They also have other specialties for those who are a little more daring, including pizza topped with clams and scallops. \n\nBasically: Good service and delicious (and cheap) pizza!", "author": "Rachel D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-17", "description": "This is my favorite non-deep dish pizza in the city.  The crust is perfect, soft on top, but crispy on the bottom.  The sauce is slightly sweet and well apportioned.  Probably most notably, the cheese is fairly substantial and is pure mozzarella, not some kind of blend.  I almost always get two slices of cheese pizza to go, which is really four slices since they cut each giant slice in half.  This meal costs me $5.50 and is among my favorite regular meals.", "author": "Cassidy K."}

There are some things I would personally like better; however how can anyone or any business please everyone??!!   But anyway, I had a sense for what I was in for from reading the reviews (again, we are reading from the \"'public too, so who knows??!!\" --  I would actually like to rate you 3-1/2 stars, but that option wasn't available.  But anyway . . actually, I think I will change it to 4 stars just to be on the positive side of things.  I have to agree with a lot of the reviews.  The pizza is quite straightforward with LOTS of generous toppings including cheese.  The sauce is so mild it is barely there (i.e., not overbearing).  This is NOT a gourmet pizza, but is a standard very doughy pizza.  If you LIKE lots of thick dough/crust, generous toppings, this is your pizza! There's nothing wrong with that either.  It's just what it is.  I think the phone order person was \"okay\" but warmed up a bit when I asked a few very friendly mannered questions.  I forgot to ask for \"thin crust if possible\" (my preferred pizza crust), but c'est la vie.  I think all-in-all, if these things described are what you want, you should go for it . ..  AND. . . in the Valu-Pak envelopes delivered weekly there is a great buy one pizza - get one 1/2 off. Not bad!  In the end, I usually opt for something a bit more on the gourmet side but those places don't deliver so Bella is just what I needed tonight.  Thank you.", "author": "Mikey S."}

I havent received my order yet, so I cant comment on the food, but I just have to comment on the service of the lady on the other end of the phone. I understand pizza places get busy, but come on! I was put on hold 3 times, the first time I had to hang up and call again. Then I asked questions regarding the menu and she couldnt be more bothered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-03", "description": "Haven't tried the pizza yet but I've had a calzone here and it was really good--I can vouch for the other story here about quantity, as it provided a plentiful dinner one night and a satisfying lunch the next afternoon at work...really, you can't ask for better than that.  I also appreciate the fact that they're open late--not 24 hours, but pretty late all the same.  I can't even say I'm out late much anymore, but if you've followed my reviews then you know that this is an issue that's close to my heart simply as a matter of principle, and for a city of its size, SF has terribly little in the way of edible late-night eats.  Well, a few months back Deb and I were on the hunt for vittles past 11 in our neighborhood and weren't having a lot of luck, but we stumbled across this place and gave it a try.  She got some sort of fried fish platter that was good but not outstanding, so you may well be better off sticking to their core dishes.  I'll also vouch for the sorta scary bathroom--it's got one of those plastic sinks that usually show up next to the washing machine in the cellar--but that's not what I rate a restaurant on, either.  I go for tasty food and I appreciate a place that gives generous portions for reasonable prices, and Bella scores in a  big way on those counts--just be sure to pay cash...", "author": "Michael T."}
