The name of this place is about as unremarkable as it gets when it comes to names of restaurants/caf\u00e9s/eateries, but, at the same time, the name is self-explanatory and to-the-point.  Here, they serve Thai food to-go.  That's it.\n\nRincon Center, sadly, isn't the same Rincon Center of old, in which there were a number of places from which to choose for food.  Thai-To-Go has been around for a while, however, and I like to come here from time to time for the following reasons:\n\n+ Big portions\n\n+ Very reasonable prices\n\n+ Fast service\n\nYou go in, you place your order, they put your order in a to-go container, and you pay at the end.  Credit/debit cards are accepted.  Most items are seemingly prepared in-advance and sitting atop a food warmer.  They will give you napkins with your order, and there's a small table where you can get cutlery and chopsticks, among other things.  Even though it's to-go, there's plenty of seating both within and without Rincon Center for your convenience.\n\nEach time, I've ordered the vegetarian pad thai noodles with peanuts.  For the amount I got and the price I paid, it was a great deal.  The food itself was just okay -- somewhere between flavorful and flavorless, if that makes sense.\n\n3 stars", "author": "Michael F."}

You have stumbled upon a hidden gem that embodies everything there is to love about fantastic Thai comfort food. All across the board you can find traditional, authentic Thai food that is comprised of fresh ingredients and made with the most love possible. I had the green curry and it was absolutely fantastic! Chicken breast that melts in your mouth and eggplant cooked perfectly go great with a side of their pad thai which has a pretty unique savory flavor. On other occasions I have also tried the panang curry which is great as well. One thing that separates this place from the others is that every day you walk in there is a special. You never know what you're gonna get but it always ends up being worth the try. \n\nThe owner is also always behind the register with a smile! She has been for as long as I have been going and always has the nicest things to say.  Overall, from the service, to the food, to ownership, this place is a must try if you're in the Financial District!", "author": "Serouge P."}

Thai won because I was craving pad thai. Not a lot of choices for protein, the only option with beef was ginger beef and even then it was questionable. It was ground beef and the ginger flavor was overpowering. The pad thai was very acidic and lacked flavor. Wasn't too happy about paying $13+. \n\nPerhaps one day I will be brave and try the curry, but I highly doubt it. Sorry but this is a no-go for me.", "author": "Erica C."}

I have been here a few times due to the convenient location and quick service. You can order your food and be out of there in just a few minutes! I've found that even when the line is long, the service is quite fast. \n\nThey have a lot of the food out in display cases so you can see what looks good. I usually get the vegetarian Panang curry, but I tried the spicy tofu today as well. There are a lot of vegetarian options. \n\nThe major downside is that the food is just...ok. It's spicy and it will fill you up, but it's not quite as flavorful as I would expect. For the spicy tofu, it feels like the spice is there to provide flavor and beyond that, there isn't much. The things I have tried are a little bit on the oilier side, but it's not too greasy. It also costs around $11 for just one entree over rice, which is average for the area, but feels expensive for mediocre Thai food. \n\nIf you're craving Thai food and want a quick and convenient lunch, I would definitely recommend Thai-To-Go, but just keep in mind that the food is just ok.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

Perhaps, there was too much water added to the rice? The potatoes and carrot pieces were very soft and I was easily able to poke my plastic fork into them. \n\nThe cabbage salad was placed on one side of the container.

You can order from their ready to go buffet or order their daily specials or from the menu. I tried the curried chicken and minced chicken on rice and it was very tasty. They're fairly pricey for lunch, two items on rice, cost me $11 with nothing on the side and no drink. I really miss Cha'am on Kearny street.", "author": "Marc N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-30", "description": "I like how you can get thai food for lunch only after a few minutes of wait here . The enjoyment stops there. As a vegetarian, you only have 2 choices - pad thai (without chicken) or the vegetable curry over rice. They gave you way too much rice and not enough veggie curry in the latter case. The pad thai is just ok. The vegetarian noodle soup with tofu is tolerable on a cold day.The price isn't all that cheap but inline with the hood - almost $8.00 after taxes.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I always get the one item with brown rice it comes to around $9.00, not bad for downtown SF. They don't hold back on the servings either, I usually finish the rice first and have curry and meat & veggies left over. I like the tupperware take-out dish they give you I always give it to a coworker who reuses it so it doesn't go to waste :-)", "author": "Christian C."}

I got the red curry with chicken over rice. I ate most of it for lunch and then the rest for a afternoon snack. Good thing I love bamboo shoots because there was a lot of them in my container. The sauce is thick and with just a little bit of spice. The only drawback to such a thick sauce is that you go into food coma.

It is overcooked to the point of being mush.  On my most recent trip there, I got the food back to my desk and could barely distinguish individual grains of rice it was so mushy. In their defense, some of this may be the result of the hot curry being on top of the rice for 5 minutes on the walk back to my office.", "author": "C A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-07-21", "description": "Another of the Rincon take-out places--thankfully much better than  Wazwan.  When you're downtown and need to get your Thai fix on for lunch, this is a solid choice.  The set-up is pretty basic--point to what you want and they'll scoop up a healthy portion for you, and at a very reasonable price.  Their pad thai is quite yummy--a little bit dry compared to some others I've had, but with an enticing undercurrent of lime that easily makes up for it.  Their curries are creamy, rich, and flavorful and they don't overcook the veggies so some crunchiness is retained.  Keep an eye out for the salmon dish that they occasionally have out--I don't remember what it's called, but it's well worth ordering on the days when they have it.  For those who like the heat, be sure to pick up a complimentary container of sambal at the register and you'll have all the punch you want.  Then take your food out to the courtyard and grab a seat--you're well-positioned for reading, people-watching, or just soaking up the accompaniment of the pianist du jour while you scarf down your lunch.", "author": "Michael T."}
