Your best chances of getting something from Yamo is if you get take out or if you come off peak eating hours.\n\nThe reason I love this place is because the value is really good for what you can get. I usually get the Yamo House Noodles which comes with a choice of chicken, beef, pork and something else. The house noodles are prepared in a simple manner. It is noodles, fried garlic, green onions with your choice of meat and is fried together really quickly. When you sit down, they have a variety of sauces to spice up your dish.\n\nThey serve various other noodle and rice dishes. Their tea salad is also pretty good too! I'd say this place is a mix of Burmese and Chinese food.\n\nYeah the prices are really good too, with most dishes costing less than $7 and they have appetizers for $3 - 5! So cheap! I come here when I want something quick, cheap and good to eat.\n\nI've been here a few times and it used to be better before!

I came by with my friends twice but there was a wait so we decided to come back the next day at 2pm... there was still a wait. After ten or so mins, the ladies working asked us what we wanted (in English) and were pretty friendly. So we put in our orders while we were still waiting which is pretty efficient of them. We asked for the tea salad, fish chowder noodle soup, and yamo house noodles. Each dish was $6.50. \n\nThe only dish that stood out to me was the tea leaf salad. It was very fragrant. It's hard to describe but had two types of crunchiness one from some fried beans and some from the cabbage. The salad was slightly sweet, incredibly spicy but not too bad. There was a slight herbaciousness and had smokey Jasmine flavors. I really enjoyed this dish so extra stars for that. The others... not so much. I thought the house noodles were a bit bland but my friend really liked them. I remember it being a little light on the protein. The fish chowder soup had a weird flavor that I didn't quite enjoy nor could I place what was off about it. It was topped with some kind of crispy crackers? There was no actual fish in this dish. I wouldn't order this again\n\nIn all a pretty enjoyable experience but I wouldn't want to wait more than 10 mins for it... It really depends on how fast the people eat because this place is TINY.

Intrigued by this epitome of a hole-in-wall local eatery with limited seating, and more importantly delicious-looking menu items, we diverted our plans of eating ramen to eating noodles without soup and tea leaf salad.\n\nThe most memorable thing about this joint is the 2 Asian aunties cooking and interacting (or lack of interacting) with guests intentionally (and unintentionally). My girlfriend was just looking through her phone but one of the cooks thought she was taking a picture of her and she said, \"no pictures please.\" Then, while somewhat smack-talking with some other random customers, the meaner-appearing Asian lady was like, \"I can hear you!\" We weren't sure if they just like to make witty remarks or they're mad. Their blank but fickle body language was difficult to interpret. Lastly, after we ordered 3 dishes for the 2 of us, the meaner lady said, \"that's it?\" Is this a rude or funny auntie? Maybe both. Who cares though--made for a good experience. Anyway, I share this story more for humor than annoyance.\n\nAnyway, if you're going to get anything here, holler at the House Noodles with Beef--flavorful/tasty/filling. The menu items are cheap (about $6.25 each) and for a moderately hungry person, 2 dishes would suffice.\n\nIf you can easily grab a seat and you're in the area, this is a cool spot for its charm of Asian cuisine served by some characters in the middle of the Mission district.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-26", "description": "A lot of the poor reviews of this restaurant do not contend with the food (which is excellent) but rather comment on the service. To address this, I think one should consider what David Chang refers to in the 'fried rice' episode of his show, Ugly Delicious, as a problem of perception between Asian and American service cultures. In America, a diner's perception of a hospitable waiter is often constructed around things like pleasantries, chit-chat, and a happy demeanor. In Asian dining culture, a good waiter is thought about in terms of efficiency under which conversational qualities such as directness and terse exchange are deemed perfectly normal, if not positive traits.\n\nThis is all to say that when get to the front of the line at Yamo and the lady who is about to prepare your food asks, \"What do you want?\", she is not trying to be rude or abrasive. This is simply the most direct way to receive the necessary information to place delicious food into your hands. Similarly, when you ask this lady if you and your friend(s) can eat inside and she says,\"no,\" she is not trying to be rude. This is simply the shortest way of saying she can't grant your request because there are no more seats available inside. \n\nSo relax with the 'service sucks' rating bashes because they are the product of a cultural misunderstanding in food service culture. Concentrate instead on the food which, I would argue, is one of the tastiest and most affordable meals in the city.", "author": "Gunther P."}

Despite it only being 3.5 stars on Yelp, the place has a lot of reviews and looked like a really authentic place, so it appeared potentially promising. Key word: APPEARED. Because let me tell you, it really does deserve its not-so-spectacular rating.\n\nThe instance I walked in, I was not greeted, but rather, I felt a really tense and extremely unwelcoming vibe throughout the restaurant. The place is extremely small and probably only has about 7-8 high chair seats directly facing the kitchen where 2 Asian women are cooking. \n\nNOTE: Do NOT attempt to take a picture in the restaurant, especially a shot directly facing the women or else you will feel the wrath and rage from them. It was so awkward when the head lady yelled on the top of her lungs, \"NO PICTURE\"! You know that one gif where Homer Simpson backs up into the bush and hides from the entire world? THAT WAS ME! Trust me, I went through war and anxiety to take the picture of my curry chicken. \n\nAnywho, the food is very affordable and cheap, so the 1 $ on Yelp is very accurate. I asked the head lady what a good recommendation is and she was pissed at me. At that point, I felt like me breathing honestly pissed her off. I eventually decided on the Curry Chicken and it wasn't bad or anything, but it also wasn't amazing either. It tasted really buttery to me and there were barely any chicken pieces within the plate. Also, bottled water is $1 here if you ask them for some water too. \n\nOverall, I felt really weird at this restaurant and felt like I was being judged left and right.

So, I guess I had high standards coming in to Yamo and expecting that beautiful tanginess from the fermented tea leaves and overall explosion of flavors from the crispy garlic to the jalape\u00f1os. \n\nI got home super excited and sat down on my couch, wide-eyed and ready to try this dish. I took a bite and my first feeling was of disappointment. This tasted nothing like tea leaf salad and really just had a strong onion taste from the large quantity of onion immersed in the dish. The flavors were just okay, but when you're expecting a tea leaf salad, this paled in comparison. If you guys have ever had Indian bhel (common street food snack), this salad kind of tasted like that. If I had ordered bhel, it would have been fine, but I hadn't. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed with Yamo. I don't think the cheap prices make up for the quality of food that you get. I may return to try the noodles or other entrees, but I don't have high hopes at this point.

I assure you, it's hilarious. \n\nThe Yamo experience is a mix of PTSD of every confusing childhood memory of being scolded combined with the pleasant memory of home cooked meals prepared by your Chinese mom. \n\nThe food ranged from good to great (review below), but the experience of eating at Yamo was absolutely terrifying with a squeeze of comical. Upon entering the restaurant you'll be greeted by a very angry mama cook who seemly appears to yell at everyone: her daughter, the other mama cook and all patrons. Service is quick - you enter, you order your food while you wait to be seated - you get seated, and immediately the dishes you previously ordered are flung at you.  Yes, dishes are airborne for a few seconds before clattering loudly in front of you - maybe safe to have a napkin ready for the splash zone. \n\nOh did you want to take a photo of your food? You better take it ninja style or ask permission to take \"food photos only\" because mama cook will scream at you from across the restaurant \" NO PHOTOS\". \n\nDid you want to enjoy your food over good conversation? Hopefully you've mastered the art of talking and inhaling food at the same time, otherwise, you'll get the stare down from mama cook if your chopsticks aren't forking food into your mouth while you're swallowing forcefully. Take a tip and skip the chewing because your bill will arrive in front of you shortly. After you pay - and remember cash only - you're thanked very loudly, but if you listen between the lines, mama cook's real thoughts are GTFO because you're holding up her business. \n\nWe ate (each dish ~$6.25 pre tax): \n\n1. Tea Salad (2/5) - Burmese style salad mixed with fermented tea leaves. Salad comes premixed.The salad was more spicy and lemony than a typical Burmese tea salad, and peanuts were roasted/fried, but no longer crunchy. It was clear the salad was pre made and sitting in the fridge ready to be served. \n\n2. Mango Chicken (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with mango and chicken, served with a bed of white rice. The \"wok hei\" or in english, \"the breath of the wok\"  was real- this dish had a complex smoky flavor that is only achieved by cooking fresh ingredients over extreme heat. The flavors of the chicken coated in sauce were deep, and the bell peppers and mango retained the textural crunch. Would have liked more than 3 pieces of chicken. \n\n3. Black Bean Fish (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with black bean white fish, served with a bed of white rice. As above, the wok hei flavor was legit. Flavors were on deep and smokey. Texture was crunchy and crispy. Fish portion was could be larger. \n\n4. Yamo House Noodles (3/5) noodles mixed with garlic and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - ours was beef. Noodles were cooked almost al dante and heavily coated in oil, mixed with garlic and topped with a pinch of extremely salty beef crumbles. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood - 3.5/5 - Food here definitely has potential. On one hand the wok hei flavor is on point, on the other, portion sizes of protein is minimal and often too salty. Prices are cheap, which makes the value for food was a good bang for the buck in SF. \n\nService 1/5- From my notes above, the experience at Yamo was conflicting. I was terrified from the moment I walked in, but also couldn't help uncontrollably laugh at the situation. There were some frequenters who came for take out and you can tell they've experienced the PTSD themselves and have learned better to just get take out. One after one, they'll come in and skip the banter, and just say the numbers of the dishes they wanted to order. Put down the money and with a slight bow retreat backwards out the door where they waited patiently until their meal was prepared. Pro tip: if you want to experience yamo without the PTSD, just come for take out. \n\nEnvironment 1/5- This rating is likely skewed from the notes above - but hard to enjoy a meal when you're feeling afraid. Minimal seating ~ 10, expect to wait 30+ mins if you come during regular meal hours. Definitely come on a pre laundry day because you'll walk out smelling like Yamo. \n\nEat take out from here.", "author": "Janice K."}

The same applies here, so please don't be worried about waiting a long time as it always seems to clear out just as quickly as it fills up. The ladies who work there are tough, can appear short tempered, and are usually in a rush. This is not to be mistaken as rude, for they greatly care about the product they're delivering. They will usually smile and chat should you ask them how they're doing. It took close to a year for the lovely ladies there to remember me, and to be honest I'm proud I earned their trust. So keep smiling and remember your manners. \n\nI have only ever ordered the House Special Noodles with Beef/Chicken/Pork. Each one of the meat choices are different, and taste simply amazing.

As in most Asian restaurants, service is not going to be super friendly, but the food is good and inexpensive. \n\nAnd you really have to see this place to believe it. It is TINY! One counter, 10 stools and that's about it. You can see all the kitchen action from your seat! There is a refrigerator at the end of the counter with water and sodas, so help yourself with the water/soda and that will be added to your bill. \n\nWe both ordered the House Noodle dish, with pork as my protein of choice and beef for the hubby. We also ordered the egg roll which was just okay. I wouldn't order that next time. It's a little greasy and could be tastier. We both liked the house noodle dish though. The noodles were nicely cooked and garnished with scallions, fried garlic and cilantro. The bits of pork were tasty but it wasn't very much. The hubby liked the bits of beef on top of his noodles too. If you have a big appetite, definitely order something else other than the noodles. A bowl of it may not be enough to alleviate your hunger, and with most dishes priced at $6, one can certainly afford another dish. Just make sure you have enough cash. They only accept CASH! \n\nWhen we left the restaurant, there were lots of  people outside waiting for seats and waiting for their to go orders. Popular place!

This place couldn't deliver on almost any of its promises.\n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes on a Tuesday at 8:30pm for two seats at the bar, we had pretty high hopes.  The restaurant doesn't look or smell clean, and you'll definitely walk out reeking of cooking oil....but that can all be forgiven for an amazing meal.  This was not an amazing meal.  \n\nWe started with the tea leaf salad, which was quite good.  It's certainly very different than the Westernized versions you'll get at Burma Superstar and others, but not in a bad way.  I'd eat either style for different reasons and be happy.  HOWEVER, our main course is where it fell apart.\n\nI ordered the house noodles with pork.  My boyfriend ordered the same, but with beef.  I was served a bowl with chicken.  Then, this real conversation happened:\n\nMe: \"Oh, excuse me, I think maybe I got someone else's order?  This is a chicken bowl; I ordered the pork.\"\nGrumpy Waitress/Cook: \"Oh ok.\"\n*PAUSE*\nGrumpy Waitress/Cook: \"No pork.  Eat.\"\nMe: \"Um, no I think this is chicken.\"\n*WAITRESS WALKS AWAY*\n\nSo, I proceed to try it.  My boyfriend proceeded to try it.  It's chicken.  Like, no question.  She refused to come back over and speak to us, so I decided to just eat it - I mean, it's wrong ok, but how bad could the dish be?  Bad.  It was just so, so bad.  \n\nThe couple next to me ordered this dish and there was sauce and good stuff coating the noodles and pooling at the bottom of their bowls when they were done.  Mine had literally none of that.  My boyfriend's had some, but not nearly so much.  My bowl was literally just gummy, very starchy-tasting noodles, a few green onions, and a handful of WAY over-salted pieces of chicken (maybe a chicken thigh-worth).

It's small, cramped, family-owned, not very sanitary, has an open kitchen, offers simple comfort food, and everything on the menu is under $10. Yamo fits all the criteria of a \"hole in the wall\". \n\nIf you're lucky to find an empty spot on the 8 seat counter, go hang up your backpack on the wall, take a seat on the bar stool, read the sticky menu, and better order within a minute or else you will get on the bad side of Yamo's impatient waitstaff. Between three people, we shared the samusa, tea leaf salad, and a Yamo chicken house noodle. That's not enough food for a real meal here, so we got scolded by the waitress. If only she knew we chose to eat light because we had a dinner reservation 3 hours later...\n\nThe samusas were generic, they reminded me of deep fried hot pockets stuffed with a mild meat filling. Based on its texture, the samuas was definitely a frozen food product and not homemade. The supplied dipping sauce was the sweet and sour type that accompanies egg rolls. \n\nTea leaf salad (lahpet thoke) was not very memorable. Actually, it tasted even worse than the ones I've eaten at Burmese restaurants in LA. Yamo's salad was overall crunchy which I found satisfying but the flavors were very very mellow. It sorely lacked the pungent and bittersweet flavors that I expected from mixing fermented tea leaves with other ingredients in the salad, which is what makes this Burmese salad so unique. Instead, the salad tasted sweet and garlicky more than anything else.\n\nFinally, Yamo's house noodle was simplistic and ordinary, yet almost everyone else in this hole in the wall had a bowl in front of them. Egg noodles were boiled in some oily broth, then batched drained, served with some pan fried boneless chicken, peanuts, and green onions. What's so special about it? What's Burmese about it? Even after the chef drained the oil, the bowl of noodles was still a grease bomb. Not worth the $6.\n\nAs others have already mentioned, you won't find service here. The three ladies who prepare your meal are not very friendly, so it's best to eat fast and get out ASAP. The chefs appear to speak Taishanese, a Cantonese dialect, to each other and joke around. Well, the damage was $19 for this disappointing meal. Not worth it for the snack-size portions and uninspiring flavors, not worth a detour to come here.

We got the yamo beef house noodles, the chicken noodle soup, the catfish chowder with noodles, and tofu and mushroom. The house noodles and chicken noodle soup were both really good. The catfish noodles I would say I still prefer mohinga as the broth wasn't as flavorful as when I got it last time. The tofu and mushroom is alright, you can probably get those at any other Chinese restaurant.\nFood is extremely affordable as dishes are average $6 each. Perfect for broke college students like me though it was a little hard finding parking.", "author": "Cynthia L."}

Yamo's is a bit polarizing with 1 star and 5 star reviews and I agree with both sides. But I think expectations should be set before coming here. \n\n1. If you're easily offended by rude service, this is not the place for you. The ladies are plain rude. I see some people refer to them as \"sassy\" and I think that's the absolute nicest way to put it. It's somewhat endearing in a way you uncomfortably laugh at racist jokes at a comedy show but to be frank, they are just rude. I don't even understand Cantonese and I know they were trash talking the customers. Don't expect small talk or really any conversation, if you get your food without them throwing it in your face, you're good. \n\n2. So cheap. My go to is mango chicken and it's $6.50 cash only (includes tax). \n\n3. Cuisine is mostly chinese. I see some Burmese items on the menu.. like the tea salad is tasty and a great value, but to me the rest of the menu seems like a mix of Chinese style dishes. \n\n4. It's a hole in the wall with 8 or so bar stools. First come, first serve. Can get smoky inside, space is small and woks usage is abundant. \n\nThere really is no other restaurant like this in this neighborhood, especially in this price range. They are small business owners putting out good food at a good price and I respect that. The rudeness is not an issue for me whatsoever. Take out is also extremely popular and what we typically do now. Food comes out in under 10 minutes.", "author": "Leslie W."}

We were unpleasantly surprised by the small and smelly restaurant. The food was okay. We didn't think it was 4 star quality at all because the food was greasy and small in portion. \n\nAs a well-traveled and well-educated foodie, I can only give it a maximum 2 star if you ask me. \nI think yelpers rate it higher than it should, probably because the food is cheap and they are surprised by the food made by two old burmese ladies working in a shitty-looking dump hole. \n\nToday in the afternoon, I was running errands in the mission district. I walked by Yamo and ordered takeout before I drove back to my studio. \n\nI was completely pissed off and upset about the customer service there. \n\nOriginally I wanted to order curry chicken with noodles, but after 10 seconds, I changed my mind and ordered black bean fish with rice, before they started cooking anything.\n\nThe burmese lady with short gray hair was talking shit about me in burmese.  \"Do you think he is chinese or taiwanese?\" \" He must be taiwanese because he was so annoying and troublesome.\" Shit talk went on.\n\nI was completely shocked by how rude she was. Did I do something wrong? Did I do something unforgivable that she had to insult my ethnical background in Burmese? It was funny. They kept talking shit about customers because they thought I didn't understand their dialogue. \n\nI patiently waited outside Yamo for my food. When she was handing my takeout, I told her quietly,  \"I actually understood what you said earlier. It was very rude.\" She rolled her eyes and gave me an offensive hand gesture. \nA middle-aged white customer asked me what happened. I told him briefly about what I heard and experienced from the burmese ladies.\n\nThe customer service was highly unprofessional, disrespectful and unbelievable.

As other people have said, it's super small inside and is a literal hole in the wall. I got takeout, so I walked inside to order and then was asked to wait outside while they made it. It took maybe 15 minutes and I was a little chilly so I was kind of standing half inside and looking at everyone else's food, getting excited.\n\nI got the house noodles with beef and a mango salad. Mango salad was AWESOME! Crunchy and sweet and salty and a little sour. Hit all of the right notes and had a great balance of flavors. I don't normally get excited for salads, but this one was very tasty. The noodles were also good. Very simple, just handmade noodles with garlic and a few pieces of beef. I LOVE me a solid bowl of noodles and can really eat them plain, which was good because the beef was a bit sparse. In my head I was envisioning the big beef chunks found in beef noodle soup, but these were smaller pieces of salty beef. I liked them, but I recognized that they could be too salty for the less salt-tolerant. Definitely give the noodles a good mix to make sure everything gets all over the noodles though!\n\nNot for people who don't like cilantro and can't handle moderate levels of salt, but I loved it and you can't beat the prices.

Small, definitely your \"HOLE IN THE WALL\", about 10 seats at the counter. As I was dining, I notice they mostly do take outs. FYI, if you expect good services, don't come here. Don't complain, they really don't care. I didn't think services is awful, well at least not to me. She smile once at me. They do charge you for everything when it's to go. Don't expect anything free here and it's CASH ONLY.  I wish I lived close by, it would be my go to restaurant. \n\nFood is YUMMY and you can't beat the price. Smaller portions but who needs super big ones anyways. Better for the waist. haha And you can try more things. I prefer more varieties anyways. \"ASIA\" style and I love it. \n\n**Potstickers are filled with pork, cabbage, and carrots. My friend was so amaze by them. Very soft and juicy on the inside. Not crispy, just a little to add in some texture. \n** Tea Salad are made with tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, onion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds. - Super small dish but love the flavors. It was really good but I think way too much onions. If you want more for the money, the other two salads are bigger in portion. \n** Yamo House Noodles made with noodles mixed with fried garlic, and a choice of meat. I got the BEEF. My favorite dish. It's like garlic noodles topped with beef for a good price. So YUMMY! I can eat that everyday. \n**Yamo Cold Noodles made with cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken. - FYI its not really cold noodle. Because they stir fry the chicken and veggies and place it on top of the noodles. Therefore making the noodles warm. I know but its so good. The sauce they use is amazing. And I notice lots of people do order that for take out.\n\nI'm coming back for sure and try everything else. Everything I had was DELICIOUS! Drinks are like self serve, bottles and cans. $1.50 each.

Immediately I get snapped at by one of the employees, yelling \"NO PICTURES!\". I looked at my girlfriend and she just laughed (she used to be a regular here). From the minute I tried taking the picture, to the minute I left, that same employee just stared daggers at me. To be honest, I thought it was kind of entertaining, especially knowing how old, foregin asian women can be sometimes. Also, it's a hole in the wall... you should expect weird, quirky behavior, right? (This is me justifying why they are so angry).\n\nThen we order and the food comes out - delicious! Noodles, curry, apps... you can't go wrong here. Love me some cheap asian food. \n\nBut then, as I was eating, I kept thinking to myself, \"eat faster, people are waiting\". So I then start shoving the food in my mouth and swallowing without even chewing. Again, girlfriend just laughs.\n\nSo you see why I was so confused. Food - great. Atmosphere - confusing.

I would walk right out if it wasn't for the great Yelp review, because the place is oh so tiny and cramped. Don't get me wrong I would never refuse to eat at a small place as long as food is good. Well, this place offers nothing good including the food. \n\nI mean what place serves NO WATER first of all. You would have to purchase a bottle of water if you are thirsty. \n\nFood: I'll keep it simple. The house noodle dish that everyone seems to be raving about for some odd unknown reason, there is absolutely nothing special about it. It's just thick starchy noodle over-flavored with sugary soy sauce or fish sauce. They put very minimal amount of meat, probably about 7 tiny pieces at top.\n\nI was starving when I came in, but left still hungry because I didn't even finish the dish. \n\nI guess if you are looking for a very cheap meal and love unhealthy carb saturated with oil and sauce, don't care about super rude services and dirty atmosphere, then this place would be perfect.

Stepping in takes you instantly to the bar with a handful of bar stools opposite the kitchen where two cooks take orders and cook away. As many reviews note, this isn't really the place to go if you want fine dining or exceptional service. Odds are that your order will be taken by an expressionless cook who'll give you snappy, terse replies. \n\nThat said, I came to Yamo for the food, and just the food. My expectations for the food were a teensy bit high based on most Yelp reviewers loving it, and the line that forms through the door within 15 minutes of opening. The menu isn't huge, but it has a fair selection of appetizers and entrees. Everything is affordable, averaging around $6-7. I opted for the simple veggie stir fry with rice and split an order or spring rolls with a friend. Our food didn't take too long to come out, but it wasn't exceptionally fast either. Both my entree and spring rolls were absolutely average. Maybe the meat options are better? My friend seemed to enjoy her mango dish. \n\nAnyway, Yamo isn't really a place I'd go out of my way for, or wait in line for. But it isn't terrible, and it is by no means expensive.

But I'm glad it's not too late.\n\nYamo is one of those unique food shops in the Mission district that give you that wonderful street food vibe. Right when you walk in you will feel like you've been transported out of California and into Asia. The claustrophobic environment where you only have 10 seats on a counter, the humidity in the air along with the high temperatures, and the \"friendly\" ladies who make your food all make up this wonderful experience in the middle of San Francisco.\n\nI understand that some people might not like Yamo. You may have crossed the cooks at the wrong time or you aren't into the whole idea of waiting to sit at the counter. But if you're willing to open your senses to a different eating experience, Yamo is for you.\n\nFood \nContrary to what a lot of people say, the food at Yamo is amazing in every right. \n\nHouse Special Noodle: 5/5\nFor 6$, you will NOT be able to find a noodle dish so simple yet so tasty. I actually dare you to bring me an equivalent. Though the portion size is small, every bite is filled with garlicky goodness. I can eat this every day of my life.\n\nTea Leaf Salad: 3.5/5\nTea leaf salad here is a lot different than what you would expect. Please don't come here thinking you're gonna get some Burma Superstar dish; if you haven't noticed, Yamo isn't that type of \"restaurant.\" The tea leaf salad is much simpler here. In fact it reminds me of Vietnamese Goi. It's not bad, but don't get your hopes up; it won't \"blow your mind\" because it isn't supposed to be something that does. It's a nice compliment to any meal. It's not something you get as a standalone.\n\nMango Leaf Salad: 4/5\nThis one actually resembles more of the Viet salad I eat at home. It's a lot spicier so beware. I do prefer it over the tea leaf salad because of the extra ingredients and the extra kick. Like the tea leaf salad, this is supposed to go hand in hand with another dish.\n\nCold Noodle: 5/5\nAnother steal! Who knew that eating cold noodles would actually taste great? Well Yamo knows how to do it right. Be aware that it is kinda spicy for those who don't have a tolerance. Id get the house noodle over this, but this still deserves great praise. \n\n\nAtmosphere \nThe environment at Yamo is unforgettable. I get why people may think that the cooks are cranky all the time, but really? When you're working all day and night in a small room, it's very hard to stay positive. Trust me, I've gone on days where the ladies are sweethearts and have come on days where they seemed pissed off. But that's the type of service you'll get at any food location. \n\nI'm the type of person who doesn't mind sitting closely with strangers in a tight location. Yamo is that one place where you get in. Talk to some people while you wait, and get out. It's like a transaction with random surprises here and there. \n\nOh yah, the ladies will try to get you in and out as soon as possible too. This is very helpful to customers since it can get cramped and people are always busy. \n\nLocation\nPlace is on 18th and Mission right across from the Asian supermarket.

Hipster, luxurious, casual, romantic, etc. Yamo has fully embraced the theme of Rage. \n\nThis thematic rage centers around the owner, who is an angry asian lady with a perma-furrow between her eyebrows and a sharp berating voice. You can quickly separate the crowd dining in: those who did not grow up in an asian household with looks of terrified confusion on their faces and those who don't bat an eye because they were raised by a doppleganger in the form of an angry tiger mother. \n\nDespite the dinginess of the cramped space and the uninterrupted din of an angry asian lady taking orders over the phone (\"WHAT DO YOU WANT?!\"), the food is a bang for the buck. Delicious noodles at ridiculously cheap prices. My go to order is the house noodles with pork (chewy bouncy noodles, crispy roasted garlic, fresh generous cilantro), a tea salad (watch that spice), and a grass jelly drink to wash down the dryness of the food. \n\nMake sure you stop at an ATM on the way - cash only. \n\nAnd 10 points if you can catch a rare chuckle or smile from Lady Rage herself before she remembers she's fury incarnate and puts her mask of anger back on.", "author": "Jenni H."}

I don't need frills. I don't need you to remember my soda order, especially when you bring me endless free water. I don't need a \"smile\" or any kindnesses or creature comforts. I need food that makes me weep inside at its perfection, and I need it to be unpretentious in price and execution, and I need it to exist long before I got there, long after I leave, and to give exactly zero forks as to whether I was ever there at all. This is Yamo. Little joints like this are my life, and if I could give them a basket of stars every day, I would. \n\nPlease don't let the three stars of my review mislead or misguide you. Please. It wouldn't be fair for me to write an inaccurately-starred review, and after all, Yamo has its shortcomings in a traditional sort of scale. Think of my three stars as a way of letting you know that you need to go into Yamo prepared, fully aware of the kind of experience you're about to have, and that if you anchor your expectations appropriately, you'll have an unbelievable taste adventure. Like me, you'll probably be glad that it's the kind of place where you can drink noodle sauce right from the bowl (or you'll be glad that you don't care about manners when the payoff is so tasty). Or just get take-out and bring Yamo somewhere more highfalutin. \n\nI got #15 (Yamo house special hot-as-in-temperature noodles with pork) and #17 (chicken chow mein). The pork was ridiculous, so perfectly cooked with its slightly-crispy edges and its heady marinade aroma and its prolific appearance throughout my soba-thick noodles. #15 was garnished with crushed peanuts and chopped cilantro, and the slender slices of cooked green onion were beautiful as well as tasty against the thick sauce. #17 was appropriately-oiled, resplendent with half-mushrooms, carrots, and bok choy. The chicken was soft, in contrast to the pork, which had some appropriate tooth, and the chow mein noodles were spaghetti-thick. These were goodly-sized portions and yet not a speck of food remained behind on my dishware. Nothing about the food here feels superfluous; not one element traveled over the barrier of necessity. As in, let's reiterate that I cleaned my PLATES.\n\nOne thing that was atmospherically intriguing about Yamo was that the ceiling was high and the pendant lights were low to the counter, making the steamy, griddle-smoky space between them seem infinite. An observation born from being drunk on noodles? Possibly. Possibly. Or, more likely, a brief and touching communion with the noodly infinite.", "author": "Austin J. A."}

I came on a weekday during lunchtime and there were a couple open seats so I sat myself. Theres only 9 seats in this restaurant and it wreaks like oil so i suggest you do not stop in before any major plans or with a nice outfit because you will walk out of feeling/smelling like you just took an oil bath.\n\nFOOD: I got the house noodles because it seemed like the hottest item on the menu. The noodles took about 15 min to make and you can see everything that goes on in this kitchen since you're sitting and staring right at it.  The noodles came out with a couple of pieces of marinated meat, green onions,cilantro, and fried onion toppings. When i ordered these noodles i assumed that the noodles would be in some kind of sauce + meat ontop but i was completely wrong. These noodles were SOOO bland and soggy and it was just basically the tiny pieces of marinated meat that reminded me that i wasnt just eating bare noodles out of a strainer. I couldn't help but to grab the nearest siracha and cover my noodles in them. I instantly thought to myself..\" WHY IS THIS PLACE RATED SO HIGH??!\" \n\nnow..\n\nTHE SHITSHOW: You can automatically tell that the boss lady or the master of the other workers is the old asian lady with curly hair that has a loud, rude, high pitched voice. She doesn't have any manners whatsoever or any sense of customer service for that matter. She speaks to everyone as if you're being scolded or something. The establishment is so dirty with ingredients, bowls, plates, sauces, napkins, spices, stains, oilspots, you name it- just laying around the the shelves and areas where it should be kept sanitized and I was so shocked and my friend happened to text me asking where i was while i was dining and of course i took this opportunity to try to show her where I'm at. As i lifted my phone to take a picture of the dirty kitchen, the asian lady yelled \" NO PICTURES!!!\" while shaking her finger in my face and giving me the dirtiest look ever. The couple next to me also sensed this awkward once in a lifetime dirty and extremely rude tension and he just looked at me with that face of \" this lady is crazy..\" so i knew i wasn't alone here. After the phone incident she became extra extra rude to me. after i put my chopsticks down she said \" YOURE DONE!\" and took away my bowl. After taking away my bowl she threw my receipt at me. THREW!!! i was in such disbelief and felt so insulted by this stupid asian lady that i slapped my money down for the meal and walked out of there. \n\nAs I'm writing this review Im still in disbelief and pissed off about what happened. This establishment needs to get shut down. The lady handles money and then handles food right after with her bare hands (i observed her behavior carefully) without washing them, this restaurant looks like its run by a hoarder, the noodles taste like NOTHING, they don't have cups of water, it smells like shit in there, no customer service, CASH ONLY, apparently NO PICTURES, i just have nothing positive to say about this restaurant. I also question anyone who gave this place such high ratings... like... why... i wish Yelp had an option to give business's negative stars.

Their house noodles are super good and the catfish stew is pretty good, if you like catfish.\n\nYou basically wait in line outside (if you come with a party of more than 3-4, you're stupid and crazy) and wait for seats to open up on the counter.

Luckily there were only 4 people ahead of us and two wanted take out. We asked how long the wait was, got a cold stare and no response. Okay then!! We waited for about 25 minutes for a seat.\n\nLet me put this into perspective. There's 8 bar stools in a cramped little location almost the size of a long hallway. There's more kitchen space than there is seating (which is understandable). So as we are waiting, we are literally standing behind other people that are eating, hovering, really.\n\nAs we waited for a table, we placed our order so once seated they could start cooking right away. \n\nSo let's chat about something else while we wait to be seated. Service. I could not stop laughing at the way these ladies bark and yell at people. SERIOUSLY! Someone walks in and asks to place a to go order, \"WHATYOUWANT?????\" Lady taking the order writes down whatever sloppily then YELLS the dollar amount. No smile, no thank you, nothing. You don't come here for customer service. They are just outright rude, totally curt, and I find it hilarious. Forget special treatment, no one here gets any treatment! \n\nIn the meantime, there's one stool available and this guy dining on his own asks if he could take it. Sure, we are waiting for 2 stools anyways. As soon as he sits down, another barking lady yells at him to get out and wait in line because there are others in front of him (even though everyone in front of him is ordering takeout). He's finally seated when he gets to the front of the line.\n\nAlso, there's some kind of sticky dripping substance that falls from the ceiling periodically. If it falls into your hair, pretty much plan on cutting it. I'm not joking. After repeated hair washing, it's still stuck (and this is many hours later). I'll have to cut it for him once he gets back from work.\n\nWe finally sit down, and samosas follow within ten or so minutes. So freaking delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the chunky samosas filled with globs of potato and peas. The thin, crispy, perfectly folded triangles are my favorite. They were served HOT HOT HOT with some sweet and spicy chili sauce. I could have eaten double the order!\n\nNext up, the tea leaf salad. While not as good as Burma Superstar (a bit sweeter) it was still delicious and had an awesome crunch. \n\nBlack bean tofu didn't really do much for me, meh. I prefer the Burmese food here more than the Chinese.\n\nThe house noodles were my favorite. Such a simple dish, yet insanely flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it (and yes, we were sharing). Fresh noodles, garlicky, light, saucy, what more can you ask for? \n\nDidn't try any meat dishes this time around but if the vegetarian options are THIS good, I can't wait to come back and stuff my face with some fish, beef, and chicken.\n\nSince you're practically sitting IN a kitchen, you will smell like grease when you leave, and for hours later. We ended up getting gelato and drinks after and apologized for being smelly to the people we hung out with. Your eyes will also burn for the duration of your stay since there's no ventilation but...it's all worth it, especially watching the barking staff yell at you and everyone who wants to eat their food.  \"WHAT YOU WANT?? RAAAAA\"\n\nThere's no shrimp, clearly indicated by the cartoon shrimp pictures hanging in three locations. If you ask for it, you will be yelled at, \"NOSHRIMP!!!!!!! BAAH!!

Coming from a southeast Asian background, I think they could've used some work in that department. \n\nI had their coconut curry chicken soup (which is great btw) but would have liked it to be stronger in the coconut and curry aspect.

I'm not comparing it to any other Burmese place, because I realize the take is a little different; more like a street vendor kind of food. However, the tea salad was $6.5, tiny, and did not have enough cabbage. Everything was good, not amazing, and on the salty side. The cold noodles were good, $6.5, spicy, oily. The house noodles were good, oily, also $6.5. Not really a lot to be said about their flavors except \"it's not bad.\" The samusas were delicious though, at $4.25, potatoes had a great texture and flavor.\n\nAnyway, I probably won't be back here unless it's a cold day and I want to try their chicken noodle soup, which looked really good.

This place was an utter disappointment if what you're looking for is authentic Burmese cuisine. \n\nFood--The fish chowder soup here barely had fish--or onion, ginger, lemongrass etc that are key Burmese ingredients. Instead it's thickened with corn starch which I have never noticed in all the other times I've had this dish elsewhere. Also the noodle salad is a JOKE. Authentic Burmese noodle salad has dried shrimp and Chana bean and tamarind at the very least. You get diluted chili sauce on your noodles here instead. You get what you pay for here. I would've gladly paid 2x for something closer to Burmese food. \n\nService--I don't ask a lot in terms of service. I'm used to Chinese restaurants, where service is run ok different standards than American ones. But here? The woman really is rude. I understand Burmese and can hear her curse customers in Burmese. She literally cursed about a customer who called to change his order. Maybe it's an insecurity because her English is limited, but the day I was here, she seemed pretty upset and was taking it out on customers. Someone asked for more cabbage in her tea lead salad because it was too spicy for her and the woman behind the counter literally said \"no.\"", "author": "Alias A."}

All the food was pretty solid and a decent portion (but it's only $6!). I thought the garlic noodles were good but not amazing. Definitely glad I had other food to balance out the noodles since they got a little salty. Hot sauce also helped temper the flavor. I was a good level of full, but I can see how a lot of bigger guys might not be happy with just one dish.\n\nSome call the ladies rude, but I think they were fine.

A cacophony of ingredients, cooking utensils, grease and darkness. Tight counters, and very disinterested and basic service. \n\nWe were ignored for a while, though they had nobody else to serve and were just clearing plates. Finally asked our order and nothing in response. Watched the old lady a while and she appeared to be making our food, yeah! Got a tea salad and their house noodles, each $6.25.\n\nTea salad turned out to be VERY small serving, probably a cup total, if that. Would take two servings to have a meal, and for about $8-9 I'd have twice this amount at a place with much higher overhead, very surprising they serve so little. As for taste, I'd say it was alright though much heavier on the sauce than it needs, and was gone in about 10 chopstick loads. Much better places in town for this dish which is delicious when done well. They make other salads which are apparently 2-1/2 times the size for the same price which made no sense...\n\nAlso we had their house noodles. Good taste, a little more generous with the serving size, and my coworker said he'd return for it. At $6.25 this was probably a good deal. \n\nAll-in-all it's not really a gem in the rough as I had been led to believe on Yelp. It's okay, probably worth at least one visit for nostalgia sake if you've done some down and dirty traveling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-11-11", "description": "For the record, I really thought I would like Yamo. I've been asked \"Have you ever been to Yamo?\" by fellow foodies countless times over the past several years. A few months ago, my friend Alex and I were hanging out at her place and we had to figure out what to do for dinner. She suggested Yamo so we decided to call in an order for pick-up. Alex rattled off a couple items and then asked a question about the third. The lady on the other end yelled \"Yeah!\" and hung up. Baffled, we called a Chinese takeout place instead. I wrote off this incident as a combination of the language barrier/how busy they are and vowed to step foot into Yamo one day and give them a try. \n\nThat day was today. My buddy and I were hungry after an adventure at Heath Ceramics. Without pulling out my phone to Yelp something I've tried and loved, Yamo popped up from the vault deep in my memory of things to try, so off we went. 4 stars on Yelp and 1200 reviews...what could go wrong, right? It's a suuuper small place with a bar that seats less than ten. Your food is prepared literally right in front of you. It looked like a mother-daughter duo behind the scenes, and one of them told me very quickly that there is no photography allowed. Oh well, at least she apologized. \n\nMo Hinga was alright. The house noodles with beef were also just okay as well, but rather salty. The coconut chicken noodle soup was better than the other two but it was super oily. Each dish was bathing in MSG, for which I have a genuine disdain. I am still thirsty after eating here in the early evening. We walked out the door paying about $20 for three items, so it is on the inexpensive end of the spectrum as far as eats go in the gentrified Mission area. As the old adage goes, however, \"You get what you pay for\", and in this case, it is small portions. You may pay $10 a dish at popular, albeit overhyped, Burma Superstar on Clement Street, but you get $4 more worth of food. You also don't get the urge to swallow the entire Pacific Ocean after a meal at Burma, so there's that.", "author": "Olivia V."}

It has all of the things I want that I regularly complain about other places not having.

This cool little kid was sitting with his dad eating and when my friend went to the bathroom, this kid started chatting with me about what I should order. He was a helpful little lad and advised that his mom likes the Chicken Noodle Soup which he and his dad had ordered for her, to go. He also said the Tea Leaf Salad was another regular choice for them, so we got that too. The House Noodles with Pork were his last suggestion and they rounded out our meal nicely. The pork was crispy, the noodles were garlicky, lots of green onions and cilantro. \n\nDefinitely a cool place to go for a casual and inexpensive meal, in the thick of the Mission if you're trying to go out after. Everything was $18 total. Don't know if I've ever mentioned this in a review, but the other customers were just the best - or at least the ones we were seated next to on either side.

We did get our orders in and the food came out pretty quick after the ladies finished their prep.

There were several groups of 2 behind them that could easily have sat down, but no, those empty seats went to waste.\n\nAs a result, we got impatient and just decided to order take-out - for that you can basically skip the line and go up to the counter to order.

I checked the Yelp reviews prior to going and thought, it says 4 stars, 1500+ reviews? Can't be bad. Well, boy was I miserably wrong. I ordered a beef and noodles plate and it was soaked in saturated oils. I could lift the plate and drain oil off the food. The taste was beyond greasy and unflavorful. I didn't want to complain to the rude chefs so I just decided to order a 2nd dish, which once again, was disgusting. I left hungry and with a pain in my stomach from the grease.

There's only counter seating which only its about 8 people. \n\nWe ordered the House Noodles with beef, Fish Noodle Soup, and Chicken Noodle Soup. The counters aren't very clean and they were sticky. We waited a good 20 mins before our food was ready. We had to grab change for meter while waiting. Our food came out in an odd order as well. My fish noodle soup was ready first then the house noodles then the chicken noodle soup and finally the tea leaf salad. I felt the tea leaf salad should have been done first as it's more of an appetizer and have the entrees come out together or at least one after the other. We had two entrees out then about a 5 min gap until our last entree came out. The best dish was the HOUSE NOODLES and the tea leaf salad wasn't bad, but I wished the portion was bigger. The fish and chicken noodles soups were different, I haven't had noodle soups like it before, but not as flavorful as I had hoped or as amazing as I expected from the reviews.\n\nService is not only lacking, but slow and rude. I agree with other reviewers that the cookes/cashiers act as if they hate being there. But I didn't expect much from the service.

I ordered the standard Yamo noodle dish with chicken and I was astonished at how flavorful and plentiful the meal was -- and the best part, it cost less than $7!

I got lucky that one Wednesday afternoon/evening (still not sure which it was) because I typically don't carry cash on me (bad habit -- millennials....). \n\nAnyhow, I had an excellent time by myself at Yamo.

I was told to wait outside as soon as I told them we were a party of 2.  Luckily he came back from and we grabbed some seats.  We  ordered the tea leaf salad, Yamo house noodles, and mango chicken.  All tasted really good even though the mango chicken seemed off. \n\nThen we noticed that we were actually eating the girl next to us cold noodles, which were actually not cold. Since the girl next to us complained she received the wrong dish they slam the mango chicken on the counter next to us. Since we already started eating we ended up with both dishes. Then it got really awkward as the girl glares at us while we eat and they take forever to replace her food. \n\nNext up a odd couple comes in one singing and the other just kinda being loud with her request.  Some how her pot sticker sauce wasn't right for her.  Think she was expecting some type of sweet and sour sauce.  So she asked for another sauce, but basically told no.  Then she asked for the chili sauce calling it the sweet and spicy sauce and told no that's not sweet!  Then this is when It gets good. Then all the sudden she tells the lady at the counter there was a hair on the pot stickers.  Oh the look on the ladies face behind the counter.  She grabs the dish throws it out and says \"No more!\"  Tried so hard to keep it together.\n\nWe hurry get the check and notice we were charged for the dish we did not order, but we just decided let it go. So end of story really tasty food, angry service, very tight space, and I wouldn't recommend making any complaints.", "author": "Nick J."}

I usually don't expect much of the service and ambience from places like this but I never seen bad treatment from the owner like this before (the owner was rude to everyone, not just me).   I happened to be near the area, decided to come in here because of 4 star review and decent pictures.    I sat down the counter and started to order, the owner face was frown and looks angry.  She took my order fine, then when I order the drink, she just told me to go get it myself.  At this point, I was still ok.  My tea salad was good, but very small portion of just cabbage ($6.50), but the house noodle came with very little meat and the portion was also small ($6.50), but the problem is the sauce was so greasy and SALTY!!! I asked if I could have some shredded cabbage to balance out the saltiness, she said \"NO!\" - then I offered to pay for the cabbage, she just shook her head..  I was just laughing away..    Next to my seat there was couple and after they paid, the owner was pushing their tea cups away to tell to pick it up!  That was just nut!  Looks like she just had a bad day, but please don't take it out on the customers!  I'm all supportive of small businesses but this lady should treat people nicer.  About the price, it seems like cheap, but you need to order a couple dishes - so it's better to go to a Vietnamese, Chinese or Mexican restaurant to get a decent size of food for about the same price.\n\nCheck out other 1 star reviews and you will see...

Definitely recommend. \nMe: Out of all their items, you recommend a salad? \nFriend: It's really good. \n\nSo we wait about 30 minutes to get into this place because it's basically a hole in the wall that seats 8 people at any one time at a bar like setting We order a few things to try since their pricing is quite reasonable. $4-6 per item if I remember correctly. \n\nOrdered their Tea salad (of course), yamo house noodles with pork, fish chowder noodle soup, and black bean fish for our group of 3. Tea salad was really delicious. It's comprised of a lot of deep fried onions, which gives the salad a nice crunch to it. You really have to just try it out. The dish is rather small so I'd get one for myself next time. Yamo House noodles with pork was really simple. Just noodles with stir fried pork. There wasn't too much seasoning that I could see, but it was still rather tasty. Fish chowder noodle soup was probably my favorite. I don't know what was the crispy bit of the soup was, but it created a great texture contrast to the soup, which I loved. The black bean fish dish was probably my least favorite of the 4. It was good, but I think I'm used to the black beans not being so strong. I prefer a more subtle taste. \n\nOur four dishes totaled up to $24 and for $8 per person, that's a pretty sweet deal.", "author": "Mai K."}

The intimate space only allows for 8 diners at a time who are sitting elbow to elbow as we greedily wait for our food to arrive.

This is no loving mother who feels the need to heal all your emotional wounds with her food. She's just trying to get through the long day herself, so please don't expect a coddling mother, this is the mother who has literally been slaving in the kitchen all day, and doesn't have time for your shenanigans. \n\nThe order of house noodles with pork came out in a sheen of heavy oil that can only mean heavy food coma later.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "description": "I am huge huge fan of Burma Superstar and Burma Love, and even enjoy the food at Rangoon Ruby in Palo Alto, so I was excited to see what Yamo had in store when I visited for the first time last week.  My BF and I were lucky to snag a seat after only about a 5-minute wait at 6pm Friday evening.  I had heard that Yamo is a hole-in-the wall, so I tempered my expectations on cleanliness, courtesy and comfort accordingly and we squished in on the bar stool.\n\nAs we placed our orders - tea leaf salad, mango chicken, and house noodles with beef, we glanced around anxiously to see what everyone else had ordered, and were glad that we had chosen correctly.  However when the food came back, I was a little disappointed in the portions.  Don't get me wrong, $6.25 for a dish in SF is a steal, but the portions are probably half of what you would get at a standard Chinese take-out place, and none of the dishes were particularly savory.  Especially the tea leaf salad which was like cabbage and onions doused in sweet sticky sauce; I couldn't even taste a hint of the tea leaves.  Because it is all pre-mixed before it comes to you (I'm used to this dish being separated when presented tableside), you have no idea what is in it. \n\nThe mango chicken was fine, but is more like sweet and sour chicken.  The best dish was the house noodles with beef, and the beef portions were minuscule (as with all the other meat portions) and the noodles slippery and greasy. Since we were still hungry after the 3 dishes, we also got the curry chicken soup - there were maybe 5 tiny slivers of chicken and the broth was very bland.\n\nI have trouble categorizing this as Burmese food.  It seemed like an oily, not-as-flavorful variation of Chinese food from your typical Chinese takeout restaurant on the corner, and I didn't think it warranted any comparisons to the other more well-known Burmese establishments in SF.  Props to the older ladies behind the counter who cranked out the dishes; one of them was even wearing a wool beanie as she stir fried everything as if she could do it blindfolded.\n\n$30 for dinner for two isn't bad, but I would definitely prefer to spend 2x more on quality REAL Burmese food any other day, and eat at home the rest of the time.  I left smelling like oil and grease and still a bit hungry, but thankfully Bi-Rite Creamery is just up the street!", "author": "Mengo Z."}

I've seen places serve a salad that small and charge $10. The house noodles with beef was life changing, as in what do I need to do to eat here everyday for the rest of my life?

They were also reluctant to give us the amount of forks that we needed. \n\nAside from the service and ambience, the food was okay, but nothing amazing. We ordered the tea salad, house noodles with chicken, black bean fish, and fried rice. For me, everything was on the salty and oily side, and left me feeling a little greasy afterwards.

Some people believe that the quality/taste of food should mostly dictate the rating - I'm one of those people who rate based on the entire experience of waiting, ordering, dining, and paying.

There was a constant line of people either ordering takeout or waiting for a seat the entire time I was there. \n\nThe food was really good actually, and it is very cheap - we all know that it's pretty much impossible to get lunch for $7 these days. My friend ordered the mango chicken and I got the house noodles with beef. I thought the mango chicken was excellent, and the noodles were a bit oily/heavy but in a delicious way. We didn't get any appetizers or salad, but it was a good lunch portion even with just the entree. \n\nThe reason why I would probably never come here again to dine in is because of how rude these ladies are to their customers. As I sat and waited and ate, I saw them yelling at so many customers (someone was taking a long time to decide, and she yelled \"WHAT DO YOU WANT??\" to him... there was another instance where she yelled \"NO PICTURE!\" with dagger eyes at a customer and the entire place just fell silent for a moment because we were all so shocked) and making customers feel uncomfortable by very obviously giving them long hard stares after they were done eating and shoving the bill in their face before the plate was half empty. I mean, I get it, you are a business and want to get customers in and out efficiently... but at what cost?!?! \n\nMaybe I will revisit Yamo if I'm in the area and I have a craving for greasy, cheap Burmese food on the go.

When I peeked into the kitchen a little, which is basically looking straight ahead given the size of the place, they'd shout at me as if I were stealing their secret recipes. 2nd the food, which is way over rated. The house noodle was too soft, not even a little bite, way too much oil in it than necessary. The paste is fried rice wasn't even stirred evenly. 3rd is cleanness, which is nonexistent. Kitchen and the bar was filthy. They never washed their hands no matter after what they touched including money and the trash bin.

I like that it's family run (mom and daughter).  I think it adds to the authenticity of Asian food? Given how \"hole in the wall\" it is, I was a little surprised I was the only Asian person eating here.  It's basically an open kitchen, so it's nice to watch them in action, but you do kind of get a greasy feel from sitting there unless you're by the door.  Lots of people were in line for takeout at lunch.\n\n- Tea leaf salad: sweet and tart, not the fermented tea flavor as I'm used to, and I would have preferred a stronger tea flavor.  It has the right crunchiness but haad too much shredded cabbage and not enough tea leaves. The portion is on the smaller side\n- House noodles with chicken: great texture on the noodles, and they have that slightly doughy fresh noodle taste.  The chicken has a lot of flavor and is not dry, and the green onions and cilantro add freshness to it.  The fried garlic adds crunchiness, and the noodles are even better with their chili sauce (better than sriracha). It is a little on the oily side (ok the oil coated my lips..)\n\nGetting a seat for lunch on a weekday wasn't hard, but I wouldn't try to come with more than 1 other person since the only have 8 seats along the counter facing the kitchen.  All the dishes are $6.25 or under, which is really reasonable compared to how much some other Burmese places charge.

You should plan to take your food to go or have a nice place to picnic in mind because seating is limited to a narrow counter with 6 or 7 stools crammed up to it. There is almost always a line, for both seating and take out.  We got there, coincidentally, as they opened.  Apparently if a good portion of the menu isn't available at the moment it's no big deal.  Eavesdropping is inevitable and tolerated because your so close knit with the other patrons.  This turned out to be a positive thing because foodie talk emerges and word of mouth is always the best know all.   The woman behind the counter is also stereo-typically charming (NOT), and location of the \"establishment\" is also in, I'll say, a more colorful part of The Mission.  \nNow,  if you can put all that behind you....

I had the Chicken Salad (Chicken with a combination of cabbage, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and cilantro) ,  smoky quarter sized medallions of white meat that were grilled and somehow giving a real smoky flavor.  The salad had some kick to it too, with a spicy front-end heat that somewhat dissipated before the next. My partner started with the Tea Salad ( Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, onion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds) He said it was different than other Tea Salads he's had before, but we (I mean He) really enjoyed it.  It also had a spicy-vinegar sinus clearing quality to it.  \nIt some conversation with a regular there, the talk of the place is supposedly the Chicken Noodle Soup (Coconut noodle soup with chicken, onions, and cilantro), so we promptly ordered some to go.  It's supposed to rain this afternoon so I plan on cracking that baby open then.  I can say it was packed nicely though with the broth separated from the fixings in a separate container as to keep there freshness until use.  From what I can smell it's going to be awesome.

There's seating for about 8 at the bar and that's it, so you may have to wait a while to get in.  I can recommend the chicken curry soup, house special noodles, and tea leaf salad.  It rivals Burma Superstar at a fraction of the price (I think everything on the menu is $6.25). I'm writing this review while waiting for an order of shrimp fried rice.   When I ordered, the funny ladies (who all the other reviewers describe as \"mean\" -- you have to come here to see what I mean) went to the very old fridge and scooped out a few frozen shrimp which she threw into a bowl and gave it to the other funny lady on stove duty.

Since then I have now been there 3 times and enjoyed the food each time, so I thought it was appropriate that I update my review.\n\nNow that I have a better read on the place, this is a no frills type of place with people trying to run a business with high turnover in seating.  So, don't go if you are in a not-so-good mood yourself and don't try to take a seat for a party of two if you are the first to arrive or you will be asked to wait outside.\n\nFood is tasty, but should mention that portion for tea leaf salad seemed smaller when I went to eat by myself.

There's only approximately 10 seats at the counter, so you might have to wait at times. In spite of the cramped space though, Yamo seriously knows how to produce some delicious food. The women who work here know how to run this place efficiently, cost-effectively, and most importantly, deliciously. \n\nThe food here is nice and incredibly flavorful (and oily). The tea leaf salad is a great starter. Although it's a little on the small side, it has great flavor and it's different from your typical tea leaf salad. My two favorite entrees are the Yamo House Noodles and the Mango Chicken. The noodles are very greasy and filled with tons of flavor and a light sauce. The meat is also always tender and cooked very well. The mango chicken also has tons of flavor, as there is nothing better than mixing the rice with the sauce and chicken. The chunks of fresh mango within the dish are generous and add a nice sweetness to the dish.\n\nYes, you may not be getting the best service nor the cleanest services, but it all adds to the unique hole-in-the-wall-type vibe. It always amazes me to see how fast they are able to cook despite the lack of space and dim lighting. Even more, all the dishes here are no more than $6! (I think they actually recently bumped it up to $6.25....but still, it's a bargain!) What more could you ask for?!

My friend got shooed off of the unused counter when she was trying to get her money out. We weren't allowed to stand inside even when there was space, which is fine actually, but the lady was very rude about telling us to get out. Maybe the rudeness is part of their shtick.

Granted, this isn't a place you want to take someone on a date.. it gets stuffy and squishy. This place defines \"hole-in-the-wall.\" There about 8 seats at the bar, no table seating, and you watch them cook your food. I ordered the Yamo House Special Noodles with Chicken, and it was great! The chicken was super tasty and the noodles were garlicky. Only downside is that there were 0 vegetables in it, but that's fine if you're a meatatarian. I would say that servings are smaller than average here, but it's still great for $6. And that $6 includes taxes!! Would definitely come here again for a cheap/good meal. \n\nSide note: My friend got the mango chicken with rice and he said they were spicier than expected.

It's may also get really hot from all the cookin' and the fact that you're in a tiny, tiny space.

I was taking a phone picture and got yelled at for it (I made sure no faces were in the picture), so eep! Watch out with your camera phones!\n\nI ordered the Mango Chicken and a tea salad (both dishes were $6). The menu said the tea salad comes with dried shrimp and tomatoes so I was pretty excited -- I do love some shrimp and the concept of a salad from tea leaves is incredible, right? Well, the salad comes out and it's a few tea leaves with some dried beans.. no shrimp or tomatoes. I mentioned something and got yelled at that people didn't like the shrimp in the salad, so it no longer comes with it. Okay, that's cool, but it would be nice to be told this before I place the order..? I was disappointed.\n\nThe mango chicken on the other hand was incredible. Large portion, good amount of chicken, pieces of mango (I didn't even know mango could be cooked like that) and just typing about it makes me want to eat some RIGHT NOW. I tried to ask for a few bucks off the Tea Salad at the end, because come on -- the menu said shrimp and tomatoes and the salad had none of those things. They just yelled at me some more and whatever, I would have been happy to tip them if they simply listened to my concern and did something, but I guess this isn't the type of place for that. So, yeah -- I paid the bill and left all frustrated, but stumbled into a Buddhist temple down the street and did some meditation which brought perspective that my first world problems of a tea salad not having shrimp are not all that bad. :)\n\nAnyway, come here for cheap food -- get take out if at all possible.

And I have only ever ordered to go, and even the wait is terrible because the smoke burned my eyes during the waiting process. Also, the lady making the food was pretty rude too, but considering the environment of the restaurant, I wasn't expecting great customer service. This is really is a \"What you pay for is what you get\" kind of ordeal.\n\nThe food is pretty good. I actually prefer this place over the ever-so popular Burma Superstar. Only because the tea-leaf salad is much more tastier and actually has me craving for more. The house noodles with beef is really meh, a little tasteless, just add soysauce+hotsauce & you'll be good.

It's not the best I've had but when you don't have the time to prep the broth 24 hours in advance, this is a good alternative.  They cook to order and the broth is creamy and full, the noodles are cooked to order and they have nice full flavors of coconut, garlic, onions and cilantro.   \n\nTea Salad tea leaves, cabbage, fresh tomato, onion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds - $6 - I'm not sure why there was no tea leaves??  It was GOOD but not GREAT.  Yes all very fresh ingredients but wish there was more tea leaves to bring out that strong bitter tea leaf taste.  ah well...  maybe they should RENAME this item because if i didn't expect tea leaves i would say this is quite an excellent salad!\n\nYamo House Noodles mixed with fried garlic, and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - $6 - Greasy but so delightful!  Every bite is full of that garlic taste.  We got chicken and i absolutely LOVE the way that they prepare the chicken.  Crispy and crunchy on the outside and still juicy on the inside.  The noodles are the perfect amount of chewy and i really enjoy the sauce that they mix all together in this unique stir fry.

All those years of greasy build up from the walls to the ceiling and electrical cords all adds to the experience. \n\nThere's a kitchen then a counter that seats less than a dozen people at any time run by an all-female crew that takes no nonsense and lacks a little bit of customer service....in a charming way. They either have none or limited English, but you can easily communicate with them with basic English...and maybe some pointing and nodding here and there.

Y'all want some conversation and a smile? Go talk to your neighbor next to you because these ladies are too busy making quality food and don't give a shit, which I kind of admire.\n\nAs for me, I usually drop in after the lunch hour and go up to the counter and order my house noodles with chicken or pork to go then pay my 6 bucks and wait outside (unless you like hot smoke blowing in your face), people watch, and get asked if I'm waiting for the bus to which I kindly reply \"no\" to about 5 different strangers for about 5-10 minutes, depending on how busy it gets.

But this place last week and tonight was full. Everyone sits at a counter on some funky, red vinyl covered stools. What caught my eye this time was a guy seated close to a door drinking from a straw that fed into a real coconut. I had to exam the menu in the window.\n\nAppetizers: $4.95 - only 3 choices: samusas, egg rolls and potstickers. \nSalads:       $6      - tea leaf or chicken salad\n\nAhh, the samusa and tea leaf salad on the menu immediately screamed \"Burmese\" to me. \n\nEntrees: All $6 - choice of curry beef, chicken, curry prawns, curry tofu or curry fish. Everything goes over egg noodles or rice. Don't like curry? they make a house fried rice or a house pan fried noodle. You kind of get the drift that their repetoire is strictly enforced.\n\nWhen I popped my head in, the main lady and the cook looked over the full row and then peeked over the counter and nodded me to the 1st stool right inside the door opposite the stoves. Umm, is this the best seat in the house? Or is this the worst seat?\n\nI've got to say I like the fresh air coming into the door. Didn't like the closeness of the flames from the wok shooting up in the air from the stove.\n\nWithout being in a party, I chose only one dish: curry prawns with rice. I was fascinated watching the ladies' system. The head lady takes the orders, gathers ingredients and places items in a silver dish which she lines up by the cook and the cook stir-frys each dish up and gives it back to the head lady to deliver to the customer.\n\nBack to the food: now dairy-based curry generally has a good sauce that goes good with rice. But when I was served up my dish, I found I had a reddish, oil based curry with the prawns. Foiled - not much sauce. The food was okay and definitely hot from the oven.\n\nOther male diners (with bigger appetites!) went all out ordering potstickers, curry fish noodles and fried rice and curry tofu just for two people. Some couples took out an order of the tea leaf salad on their way out. Seems like a very popular dish.\n\nIt was really interesting to watch the interplay between the ladies busting themselves to get the food out.

As I'm writing this review I'm reminded I gotta start experimenting with adding tea leaves to salad...\n\nOnly reason that fifth star is missing is cause it seemed like we kinda got stiffed part of our salads (photos looked was plumper) and the mango chicken dish was pretty unmemorable. \n\nAlso, I don't know how it happened but despite there only being 8 seats at the counter (and pretty much all were full the entire time) magically no one had to wait. We approached right as two people were leaving. We left and two others happened to show up right then and there. If your experience isn't as lucky, it'd be worth waiting outside the front door (which is welcomingly left open) for someone to leave.", "author": "Megan F."}

The food was pretty good, although the noodles were a bit disappointing because they were too soft in texture- could have more of a chew. The beef noodle was good and the price of the dishes are cheap, but they don't make you full. I was disappointed because the place didn't offer any water nor was any to be seen and the host lady taking the order and phone calls was extremely rude. A customer was about to take a photo and she screamed, \"NO PHOTOS! DON'T SAY SORRY!\" while facing in front of us. A moment of silent awkwardness followed.

I ordered take out, and waited ~10 minutes for my food (6pm on a Thurs), lucky me! When I placed my order, the waitress seemed angry at me, but no points docked here. I'll attribute that to the authentic Burmese vibe :)\n\nHouse Noodles with Chicken Curry:  Not as chewy as I expected. Curry was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. I felt it was actually a little too heavy. Tiny portion. Perhaps you are better off with the beef or chicken.\n\nThe Mushroom Tofu with Broccoli: I expected silken white tofu, but instead it was deep fried. The sauce was a thick brown sauce that reminded me of Chinese food. I guess all their entrees come with rice, and like the previous dish the portion was small.\n\nThe spring rolls were pretty typical, I would probably get them again.\n\nI was really hoping it was better than Burma Superstar, but Yamo is a good Burmese option for the Mission.

A place that does not consider the delicate \"feelings\" and \"sensibility\" a middle class upbringing cultivated. A place that is so uninviting to dine in, I was amazed that all the 10 seats were filled and there were maybe 8 people in outside on the sidewalk.  A place that doesn't care if you are dining there, and doesn't care if you ever return. A place that didn't give 1 second of thought to the comfort of anyone eating there. \n\nYamo - getting the food\n\nSeeing the line, and not wanting to cut in, I asked one of the diligent and hungry diners if they were waiting to pick up food or sit down. All sitters. Went to the front of the line and squeezed into Yamo. Got the attention of the woman who seemed in charge.\n\nSaying I was picking up a phoned in order, she thought I was placing an order and she grabbed a small tablet of paper. I said it again and motioned like I was talking on a phone. She got it. The Yamo phone rings, she grabs it and starts speaking, loudly, and scribbling on the small pad.  She looks back at me and says something resembling \"what did you order\", I knew this was the key to getting the goods, since my friend said that they didn't ask or give time for a name when the order was called in. I read from my own scribbled list of 7 dishes. Half way through she determined it was the recipient of the stack of 'to go' containers in front of her. And starts adding it up. I had a brief thought of what if it isn't what was ordered. Quickly concluded, that what ever was in those sturdy looking containers was going with me. \n\nYamo - The Food\n\nFish curry, House noodles w/ beef, mango fish, samosa (like) appetizer etc. was all good. \n\nYamo - The Diners\n\nStanding in front of the cash register which is just behind a women who is in front of 3 large woks sizzling on high heat, and 3 other pans also on high heat. The heat was almost unbearable. Like being in Las Vegas in mid August with a down jacket on. The alternate reality took over. The 10 or so folks at the counter were seemingly enjoying themselves. One person scooping out the innards of  a coconut that had a hole hacked in the top, clearly enjoying the fruits of their labor. Another couple trying to figure out their new smart phone, which they acknowledged was smarter than them. The noise, the heat, the cramped quarters, the shouting woman, no sensible person would be comfortable and unaffected by the environs. Yet, they went on eating and cavorting as if everything was as it should be, as they expected and as they have accepted. Thats it.

There are 3 chefs (2 of them in the late 50s-60s age) cooking on woks with grease on the walls and very minimum ventilation. I have never tried Burmese cuisine before but I'm hooked! I loved the tea leaf salad and the house noodles with beef. The flavoring and texture was both dishes were just spot on. We also ordered the fish noodle soup, cold noodles, and samosas, but none was as impressive as the first two dishes. We ended ordering another house noodles because it was just so good. Prices were very reasonable, but the whole dining ambiance environment was a bit rough- sticky table top and sriracha bottles , no place to put your purse, tiny water cups, and questionable cleanliness of dishware.

This place is run by a bunch of small cranky asian women who have very thick accents and often-times sassy attitudes. My favorite past time when eating here is watching newbies try to order food from them and seeing the reactions of the customers. They will ignore you initially and can be fairly rude if you catch them at a bad time. \n\nJust remember that they're all business - they just care about your order and that you pay. One time I remember I had to yell my order because she asked what I wanted when she was on the other side of the restaurant. Tip: if you want to pay, just put your money down on the counter and wait for your change. Sometimes they like to ignore you if they're busy, but they won't ignore money on the counter so they usually get to it right away.\n\nWatch out: Cash Only.

The first time we were there, about a week ago, she wasn't in and other staffs were nice but tonight she messed up my order. I ordered chicken noodle soup without cilantro, she realised she forgot and started picking out stuffs from the bowl and ended up removing onion instead of cilantro. I didn't want to bother her so I picked out the cilantro myself and asked for some onion, that's when she got mad and started cursing in Chinese or Burmese, I could tell because of her facial expressions and hand gestures, and if it had not been anything rude she would have just said it in English. Anyway, I'm not saying I would never go back because the food was nice and cheap, but I would always check if she was in before walking in next time (chubby with short curly hair, very small curls). Oh, and one more thing, the area isn't safe, tonight there was a homeless person walking in asking for food and ended up having a fight with some guy in the shop, that same counter lady had to call the police.

I found the tea leaf salad particularly delectable, but both of my entrees were flavorful and intriguing choices. Sometimes I feel like I've tried everything there is to eat, but you helped my senses jolt with excitement!\n\nIn addition to the delicious food, I loved the free sauna treatment I received by choosing to dine at your cute little bar.

Because this \"salad\" was WAY SALTY. I know I tend to eat on the blander side, but man, this dish needs to be toned down dramatically. The ingredient was nicely paired though, as there are lettuce with nuts, giving it a mixture of soft and crunchy, creating an interesting combination. Only if it was 50% less salty, this would have been a great item.\n\nHouse Beef Noodle: This tasted like a better version of beef chow mien, but still pretty similar. A bit on the oily side, but I am sure that's how Burmese food is supposed to be. The flavor was great though, and you definitely get a generous amount of beef. Was it amazing though?

These three older women sure know how to run this hole-in-the-wall efficiently and successfully. Just off of Mission on 18th Street, you'll notice a line of hipstered out peeps standing outside of a random store. That, is, in fact, Yamo. The place is literally like eight bar table seats where you pretty much are eating your meal and watching the three women cooking and shouting to each other (in what I think is Cantonese!) as the orders come in. The food comes out real fast and your meal is so tasty, you'll probably down in less than 20 minutes.\n\nHouse noodles (noodles with fried garlic) and beef, tea salad, and samosas were all so good! The beef on top of the noodles was so tender and flavorful - I think if you add just a bit of the chili sauce on top of your house noodles and mix it all around, it'll make this dish even more fantastic. If you aren't down for greasy foods though, either don't bother to come here or just avoid these noodles. But you should seriously try them... The portion size of the tea salad is actually pretty small, but it's definitely worth trying! The samosas were also pretty good, the potatoes that they put in them is somehow mixed with some sort of spice or other vegetable that makes them surprisingly sweet and tasty. The pot stickers were also pretty good - they did a good job of preventing the pot stickers to be full of juices (like what happens at some other places).\n\nOverall, great food and a great experience.

For the love of God, don't block the entryway staring at the menu for too long if you don't know what you want and don't try to ask the ladies questions about the orders.

This is bad, cheap, oily, and totally flavorless, run-of-the-mill chain Chinese food (cooked by two Chinese people). Then they throw a mediocre tea salad on the menu and call it Burmese.\n\nI got \"curry\" fish -- fish fried in way too much oil (and I love me some oil) with a slight pinch of curry powder, a heap of undercooked green bell peppers and onion wedges and a huge mound of overcooked rice -- and the \"tea\" salad, which was slightly better but over-sweet in what tasted pretty much like Italian dressing and, frankly, not all that cheap for a small plate of dry-friend vegetables.\n\nI get it. The service sucks, so it's got to be authentic. (I asked for a suggestion and was glared at in silence before I was handed a peeling menu sticky with other people's food). The wait is long, so it's got to be worth it. (I snuck in before 12, so I only had to wait 10 minutes for my waste of a meal.

No biggie, it was still flavorful and I mixed my mango salad in with it. There should have been cilantro or something on my noodles but maybe they were just playing it safe and left my dish plain. I enjoyed the dishes but there was barely any mango in my salad and my noodles were pretty plain. I was slightly disappointed. \n\nWhat really left a bad taste in my mouth was how horrible my stomach felt a few hours after. I saw the way they stacked the bowls of noodles, they shuffled the to-go bowls around and then stacked them on top of each other, so the bottom of one bowl that was God-knows-where was now directly touching the noodles below it... And don't get me started with the FILTHY menus! They are so sticky you could press them against the wall and they would stick. Also, she took my money and started cooking without washing her hands. Lastly, I saw her pour the oil that she used to cook her chicken in a container on the ground. Is she re-using it? Is that for disposal?

It's big enough for 6-7 people tops, unless you're a midget don't bring your whole squad there and make a scene. Its fucking inconsiderate to wait on that many all at once, go there 1-3  at a time, you and the other human beings will be rewarded by the universe.\n\nThe food was good, if you don't like it for being too oily, just tell them to add less oil! If they yell at you, enjoy it! Welcome to the real world you bunch of spoiled, sugar coated brats! \n\nI loved it. Had the house noodle with beef, was delicious. I covered mine up with real home made chilly sauce, none of that sriracha tomato paste. Don't get me wrong, there isn't anything wrong with sriracha, but it DOES NOT go with EVERYTHING, and it aint hot, so don't call it a hot sauce. When you have the choice of a superior chill sauce in front of your ignorant face, dip that shit in, if u don't add the chill, you'are missing the point! \n\nOrdered the tea salad. Theres no tea in it. But was delicious though. Full of onion and vinegar, seems would go well with rice porridge too, it's got that Chinese pickle vibe to it, Chinese pickle is better than Kimchi Da Truth!", "author": "Alvin D."}

YUM-O!\n\nWith so many restaurants in SF, it's hard for me to justify going to one repeatedly when there are so many I've yet to try. But with Yamo, I make an exception. I almost can't pass by 18th and Mission without coming here - it's gotten so bad that I once ordered takeout and brought it to ChaChaCha's where I was meeting friends for dinner!\n\nWhen you walk in it's almost like walking into a different country. It's one of the diviest restaurants I've ever been to but that's part of its charm. Seating's very limited (about 8 along the counter) and ladies behind the counter can often be heard bickering with each other in Chinese. Personally, I think it's a pretty cool place to take a date. \n\nThere are 4 things I always order when I come: tea leaf salad, catfish chowder, chicken noodle soup, and fresh young coconut. I've tried some of their stir-frys but didn't think they were as good as the soups\n\nI love the flavour of the TEA LEAF SALAD (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ) and the nuts/beans/lentils in it really add a nice crunch. The CATFISH CHOWDER (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=fMdV017JTpolF_W1tHH-eQ) is my favourite dish. The soup is cooked so long that all the fish is broken down. The fried lentils adds to the texture too. The CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=QJ72eeYAXqqdpE1c2Tr2Vg) is also amazing - great coconut curry broth that I can't resist drinking every last drop of.\n\nI start every Yamo meal off with a FRESH YOUNG COCONUT (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=QPJzK4OXzdu5JK1WoRai-w). It's served with the top cut off, a straw, and a spoon to scrape out the meat.

Bad Chinese at best, and these poor ladies know how to AIM LOW. In between arguing with each other and confusing the customers with their angry, shouted instructions, they managed to screw up our order of three dishes twice.\n\nThe hood over the burners stopped working decades ago so the place has a seriously impressive coating of grease, the kind that makes everything sticky including you and your clothes. If you do choose to sit at the counter, don't wear anything that you're too fond of, it'll reek of rancid oil by the time you're done. Don't look around too much, definitely not up past the black, greasy lights toward the black, greasy ceiling. You'll start to wonder exactly what's ending up in the food.\n\nI have no idea what people see in this place; I guess they think they're getting some kind of authentic experience, but it's a total waste of time and money and a complete joke.", "author": "Josh H."}

We ordered their popular dishes: samusas, cold beef and chicken noodles, and tea leaf salad. From my standpoint, I loved it all! Reminds me of the type of dishes my boyfriend's mom cooks at home. She's Chinese/Burmese. Gotta say, this is by far, one of my go-to cheap spots to eat at now. Worst of all, that same day, I went back here after 3 hours because my drunk-a** had a fat craving for their cold noodles. How's that for being a foodie?!\nFYI...the women who run this business, don't be shocked or turned away by their speaking tones. They're not trying to be rude. I think that's how they speak to each other.\nFor those who admire Burma Superstar, maybe your palates got spoiled by fine dining, but you can't go wrong with hole-in-the-wall spots like this....especially when it's greasy food.

I get take out from Chinatown often and am well acquainted with bad service, but even I was shocked. I asked for prawns on my salad and the lady said OK.

Yamo reminds me of that moment. Three old Burmese ladies dash here and there in the open kitchen, shouting and chatting excitedly while patrons wait at the bar, amidst the sound of sizzling oil and blasts of stir-fry heat.\n\nThere's almost always a line of varying length here all day. Maybe it's because this place can only seat seven or eight, or maybe the food is so good. Well, scratch that \"or\", it's more like \"and\". I went here once and it has become one of my favorites. My date and I had fish curry and tea salad, both highlights of the night. The curry had plenty of fish and rice, and the mild spiciness topped off the appeal of this dish. The tea salad was interesting. Little tea leaves with peanuts, cabbage, and something crispy which I couldn't distinguish, all in light fish sauce. Mmmm, a good complement to the hearty curry.

When I could barely afford to go out, Yamo was there for me, a cramped, steamy little treasure of a restaurant where I could get an amazing hot meal and still have quarters left over for my laundry. \n\nBut yesterday I had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life, and it was at Yamo. I placed an order to go for myself and one other person (a friend laid up with a messed up leg, since you asked). For my two orders of noodles and one order of potstickers I waited an entire hour, while people who ordered after me got their food and left. Then, when I got the food home, I found that they hadn't even seasoned our food! So I waited an hour for plain white rice with a bland assortment of chicken and vegetables on top. I would have been better off going to the supermarket and buying a frozen dinner, and that makes me sad. \n\nI still love this place, but I won't be coming back during dinner rush again, because I don't think they know how to handle their ever-increasing volume of admirers. Mango chicken, tea leaf salad, samosas, you will be missed.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

It was like stepping into a third world dive - it's small, a counter top with 8 stool chairs. It' hot, smoky and greasy with three not very friendly woman behind the counter - one taking orders and serving the food, another doing the cooking just a few feet away, and the third woman prepping veggies nearly in your face. I have to admit it was fun to watch and a lot cheaper than going to Burma. \n\nWe ordered tea salad cause so many yelp reviewers mention it, also mango chicken, the house noodles, and potstickers. The tea salad was very tasty with a nice peanut crunch, the mango chicken was very flavorful with the contrast between sweet and salty, the noodles with pork were very good and filling, lastly the potstickers arrived last and were flavorful with a fried edge on the bottom side. The hot sauce that came with the potstickers was perfect.\n\nThe dishes are small so don't come here if you want a huge portion serving; on the other hand, the price for each of our plates was $6.25 and the potstickers were $4.50. Not bad especially since we left very satisfied. For the very hungry, I would simply suggest that you order more food if after your initial order you are still hungry.\n\nYamo's is not for everyone. As I said it is like stepping into the third world, but for my palate the food was good, the price was right, and I loved the experience. I would definitely go back to Yamo's.

So we went across the street to buy some groceries from the market, only to return less than 10 minutes later...to a line!\n\nShould've taken that as a sign that it wasn't the day for us to 'Yamo eat there,' but we already had our hearts set on it, so we waited it out.. for about a minute. Then we decided to order take out so we didn't have to wait in the cold City night.\n\nWe ordered the samusas, beef curry over noodles, and the tea leaf salad. The samusas were great. Not too big and oily, and very flavorful. The tea leaf salad was good, but doesn't compare to the version at Burma Superstar. Lastly, the beef curry over noodles was disappointing. It might've been the fact that we didn't eat it until we got home 20-30 minutes, but it the noodles were dry, and the sauce was lacking. Like I said, it most likely dried up on the drive home, but for now, I'm calling it like I see it, and for now, I'm not a fan.\n\nI would like to try it again (and eat-in this time), as I feel this place has potential, and the prices are quite cheap, but only if I happen to pass by on an empty stomach and there's no line.

It was very good but I couldn't help but think it tasted like any other decent Chinese restaurant. Same goes for the Mango Chicken with rice ($5.25).

This is the exhibition: and no this isn't Benihana's. These lady's give a performance that is a bit more eclectically appreciated. You'll have to submit to a fiery attitude to pick up a menu, and don't even think about showing up twenty minutes before they close. They've been slaving in front of a hot grill for hours, and they'll let you know about it.  Just watch one of them yield an enormous machete and hack up a coconut and you won't press the issue.  \n\n\n2. You won't feel cheated: everything is about $6 and it's good. Of course if you're looking for Burmese cuisine, as in the best ever:  Don't pay $6.", "author": "Brandon C."}

You had me at Granny !\n\nI had been here on two separate occasions and the teeny little joint with barely enough room for 7 bar-stools didn't disappoint. \n\nBoth times I started with the tender coconut water to quench my thirst and cleanse my palate. \n\nThe potstickers initially looked store bought as it was frozen solid when they plonked it down on the pan to steam them but boy, was I wrong once I took a bite and felt the texture of the dough as well as the meat inside. It was definitely way better than any frozen brand and convinced me that it has to be house-made. The only caveat ? The ginger was pretty strong so that took away a bit from the delightful experience. \n\nThe shrimp spring rolls were pretty good but were neither noteworthy nor disappointing. The one dish that disappointed were the obviously 3P (processed packaged products) samosas and I will leave it at that.\n\nThe main dishes (or entrees) are, in my opinion, what makes Yamo.\n\nThe first visit, I had the shrimp curry with steamed rice. The sauce was creamy and the vegetables served to enhance the whole dish very well. The shrimps were well done and 'bouncy' (as in not overcooked).\n\nOn the second visit, I had the Chicken curry with steamed rice. I enjoyed it thoroughly but alas I possess neither the elquence nor the artistry to describe it in a mellifluous poetic form. So just take my word for it ! Alright ??? (so that settles it)\n\nI was told that their house-noodles are fabulous and no prizes (no, not even a discount coupon) for guessing what I'm going to order next time.\n\nGo eat at Yamo !

The old women that run the place don't mess around making your order and getting right to it. You feel like you're in a family's kitchen, rather than a restaurant's. \n\nFor only 6 bucks (a rarity in this city) you can get just about any heaping bowl of noodles.

At YAMO the grub is so fantastic that I find it impossible to stray away.\n\nAt 6ft 3in and 210lbs, when Im hungry I can wipe out little convenient stores; but my portion was good enough to leave me satiated.

Pretty decent friendly service and showing any interesting in really exploring Burmese food, gets you some smiles and at time dishes which are modified to make them more \"authentic\".  Personal favorites is the khaosay essentially chicken sauteed in ginger-garlic-shallots and turmeric finished off with coconut milk and topped with noodles.  Chopped peanuts on top and fresh green chilies and life is good...especially on a cold day.  Other dishes are serviceable but among the best dishes is also the tea salad  (when they have it) which is a wonderful mixture of tea leaves and other ingredients that will remind you of the Thai papaya salad.

You'll probably have to ask for water and it'll come after your meal does, but suck it up because it's worth it.  The tea leaf salad is a must -- tea leaves, dried shrimp, peanuts, cabbage, beans, tomatoes -- and I also had the mango chicken.  The mango chicken isn't overly sweet, which is good.  The mangos are firm, so maybe their secret is to use under-ripe mangos...kudos to you Burmese ladies, kudos to you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-06", "description": "TIP: The seating is basically one bar with 8-10 seats. If it's full, wait right outside. As people finish up, one of the 4 ladies behind the counter will ask you what your order is. Once people leave, you can scoot in and take your spot. Your food will be ready in minutes!\n\nTIP #2: If you need water, just ask for it. The ladies hear you and will give you a cup of water shortly. Don't expect any other service, really! The ladies are probably too busy cooking to notice that you've finished eating, so wave your money at them, they'll check it with your order slip, take your money, and you can free up some space for the next customers. \n\nDelicious and just the right amount of food. My sister and I, starving at around 8:30pm, waited for 15-20 minutes for spots to open up. The wait can be worse, she said. We ordered the tea salad, mango salad, and house noodles with chicken. They were $6 each. Portions were just right. \n\nThe tea salad was the star of the meal, at least for me! Such interesting flavors, satisfying crunch from fried peas and fried peanuts, spice from chilis and fried garlic. Near the end of the salad, the pieces were too small for me to grab with my chopsticks, so I (shamelessly) picked the plate up and shoveled every last bit into my mouth. \n\nThe mango salad was tangy and refreshing. Again, the melding of flavors and textures--slightly sweet and spicy, smooth mango and crunchy toppings--worked together beautifully. \n\nThe house noodles were a bit bland. The chicken was nicely cooked, but the noodles themselves lacked flavor (and had a pretty good layer of grease). I had to use some chili hot sauce to put some life into it, but it came out steaming and fresh. \n\nWe watched the ladies work their magic, efficiently and elegantly managing 3-4 pots and pans at once. Mesmerizing. It is what it is--bare bones service, delicious satisfying food that comes out fast, an unforgettable and unique experience.", "author": "A.L. H."}

It's like a dream come true...AND the awesome ladies who run the place speak Cantonese which is perfect for me so I can chit-chat with them!\n\nI've heard nothing but great things about Yamo so figured it was time to give it a try for dinner one night. It's diner-style with an tiny open kitchen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=CWKicY2EvYWZccR0tNePjA) and a narrow counter space as the eating area that seats maybe a max of 10 people so expect to get cozy with your neighbor! Luckily, my friend Audrey L. got there a little earlier and was able to nab 2 seats towards the back. I was starving (and the portions are decent) so here's what we ordered:\n\nspring rolls ($3.50) - 2 gigantic rolls loaded with basil, shrimp, vermicelli, and lettuce with a side of peanut dipping sauce. This wasn't the greatest and kinda bland...I would stick to getting spring rolls at Vietnamese places.\n\ntea leaf salad ($5.25) - This was by far my favorite dish...don't be fooled by its mild appearance because it's spiiiicy! It contains a mixture of tea leaves, cabbage, onion, cilantro, and various fried beans and seeds to provide crunchiness. The combined tangy and spicy flavors ignite on your palate and are oh-so-delicious! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=fbZj28B92VTTWV1jwGrSNA) \n\nYamo house noodles with chicken ($5.25) - If you like garlic, you will love this dish. It's pretty much just egg noodles (similar to thick ramen noodles in texture) covered with fried garlic pieces, chicken, and topped with green onions. It's a greasy and simple bowl of food but has that bite from the abundance of garlic. Yum! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=oIhBcY34GoprtwED1BuaNQ)\n\ncurry prawns with noodles ($5.25) - We saw the girls next to us order this and it looked so good, we couldn't resist getting it! They ran out of the flat rice noodles (choice of also rice or the egg noodles) so we chose the latter. It is stir-fried with mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers, spices/curry...a well-rounded dish with layers of flavor/heat and textures. The jumbo prawns were cooked and seasoned perfectly too. I give it a big thumbs up! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/D1-_5ff4aic1-7rLqzUd4g?select=aAuG0KHwIMTJFTegFcSjXg)\n\nI want to come back very soon!!", "author": "Karen Y."}

I first tried Yamo a few years ago on a whim and it has become one of my favorite spots in the city. Don't be put off by Yamo's aesthetics, it looks very dingy and is  pretty much the size of a walk-in closet with very limited seating, and yes it is loud. There is usually a wait, but their coconut chicken noodle soup is SO worth waiting for, it tastes like a wonderful oniony yellow curry soup with hints of chilli and of course, creamy coconut. For the price, you really can't beat it. If you aren't in a soupy mood, try the spring rolls or mango chicken. To wash it down, enjoy a glass bottle of Coca-Cola or (my personal favorite) order coconut milk and one of the cooks will chop off the top of a fresh coconut and serve it to you with a straw and spoon. \nOne last tip, Yamo is cash only so don't forget to hit the ATM before you go.

Then, she proceeded to take other orders of ppl who came after us and sat them down and served them food before even starting to make our food. We waited 30 minutes until finally i asked if we were going to get our food and she yelled at me some more before finally starting to make our food which we got like 45mins maybe even an hr after first entering. Also when she made our food with her bare hands in between handling money (for example making the tea salad with her hands after just handling money) she was also coughing, sneezing and yelling/spitting over our food. The actual food was good, but given the entire experience it's just not worth it.

There was a ton of peanuts in there but a little oily for my taste.\n\nHouse Noodles with beef was good but again portion seemed kinda small.  It had a nice presentation in my to go box, but still seemed smaller than what I'm used to.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the normal Chinese take out places I go to.

Don't trust the masses. \n\nAfter reading \"great\" reviews on yelp I figured that Yamo would be be a super safe choice. It was completely the opposite! Like most of the reviewers, Yamo is literally a hole in the wall. We almost drove right past it and either way we had to park far because sf never has parking anywhere anytime. As we waited in line, there were tons of kind people raving about how good Yamo is and how the wait is SOO WORTH IT, they recommended tons of different dishes (which we ordered.) After about 30 min we came in and ordered a variety of noodles, and some type of meat (I don't remember exactly what we ordered.) The women at the counter were quick, unhygienic, and rude. They obviously knew that we were at their disposal so they don't give a sh*t about their customers. The food came out and looked already SUPER GREASY. This is definitely NOT A HEALTH FOOD so dieters, beware. As I first tasted the food it tasted OK, but then the propane flavor started to kick in and I was ready to leave! All the dishes reeked of propane and oil!! \n\nI agree that Yamo is a budget friendly place at $8-15 a dish, but at least give some REAL FOOD! Overall our bill was $40 for CRAP FOOD. Has Yamo's prices brainwashed the people?! If they were located in San Jose or some other non-overpriced city, they would be out of bushiness. I would personally rather take a trip to costco for a $1.50 hot dog and heck why don't I add an Ice Cream Bar for $1.50! Seriously people there are much better things you can spend your money on!

Their dishes at no more than $6 a plate are super cheap so there is the allusion of getting a bigger bang for your buck. However, as soon as you get your food you realize the portion is adjusted to the price. Still a cheap eats joint and I'd still drop in once in a blue moon. But by no means should you go out of your way to check it out, especially considering the line it always has. But if you're on a budget, add this to your list.\n\nThe place is super small and may seat as many as ten along a bar in a narrow 3.5' hallway (that's seating and circulation space my friend). The kitchen is just on the other side of the bar, completely open to the diners and filled with three or four ladies shuffling tightly around each other. You see everything you don't want to see... scratching of scalp, nibbling of food, etc.  It reminds me of restaurants you'd find while traveling in some small Asian cities, but you're actually in an the international city of San Francisco. It's like going for an adventure. You will definitely smell like the food you eat if you opt to dine in. yucko!\n\nI kindaaaa like Yamo's food. To be exact, I like one of their foods. The tea leaf salad is more flavorful than when I had it at Burma Superstar and I love it. The crunchy fried beans over chopped up cabbage tossed with tea leaves in that slightly sweet & tangy dressing, and a touch of chili paste is divine. It comes in a much smaller portion than the other dishes. Unfortunately I wasn't crazy about the house noodle with chicken as it was simply a greased up yellow noodle with dry lackluster chicken pieces. There was nothing else on it to give it more interest, texture, err flavor? My friend's vegetarian house noodle looked better with all the colors. Another time I tried the curry prawn and got more greasy noodles. Yah, I've cooked better noodle dishes even when I screwed up.\n\nGive it a try if you must. Worse comes to worse, it's only a few bucks of disappointment.", "author": "Rina W."}

Peered inside and saw no more than about 10 people perched on barstools, savoring the asian fare along the counter.\n\nMy friend suggested we try it, and I'm glad I left that decision up to her. She loves trying out new and random places, as there is so much to experience within the city. (I walked back to Luna Park and cancelled my reservation, but told them I'll be back.) After another 15 minutes of waiting in line, it was our turn to take a seat. Given the open kitchen in proximity to the countertop, I sat about four feet from the stove and could feel the radiating heat. I caught a glimpse of quite a bit of what was being dished out to the other patrons from my vantage point. Looking at the menu, practically every entree was under ten bucks. There are so few places that I've been that are under that price point.\n\nOnto the food... quite delicious indeed. We ordered the mango chicken and the house noodles (with beef) along with a samusa appetizer. Besides trying to get a handle of the semi-round shape of the samusa via disposable bamboo chopsticks (by which my friend and I experienced a degree of difficulty of doing such) the curry and potatoes were balanced out by the neither sweet or spicy dipping sauce provided. The mango chicken had kind of a kick to it, balanced out by the other vegetables from within. The house noodles were good, albeit ordinary as it was stir fried with thin, tender slices of beef. All of the food was quite delicious nonetheless... and served with no MSG added, which is awesome for me.\n\nAndrew Jackson would have approved... as the two entrees plus appetizer cost less than one of those bills.\n\nWhile savoring the delicious life, some dude walked in and asked if he could drink his bottled beer along with his meal. I guess he didn't look up to see that there are several signs above the food preparation area... stating that no alcohol is allowed.\n\nPlease take note:\n1. This really is a hole in the wall. I'm quite surprised this restaurant can operate in such a small space.\n2. You'll smell like asian food afterwards, given less than adequate ventilation, but a lot of love and joy that goes into the food.\n3. Sitting next to the door would ordinarily give you some more breathing room, but the stove is right there too, so it really doesn't make much of a difference.\n4. CASH ONLY.

The SO and I were delighted to hear them talking to each other in Cantonese, so we bust out our Canto and made friendly conversation with everybody in our native tongue.  While we waited for our food, I just sat and watched in awe at how the three of them dealt with taking orders, cleaning up the counter, wrapping spring rolls, collecting customers' tabs, yelling out dishes to the chef lady, preparing ingredients for the chef lady to cook, packing up to-go orders, and answering the phone.  Even more amazing was that they did it with finesse.\n\nAppetizers are $3.50 each, and all salads, soups, noodle soups, and entrees are $5.25.

Their fermented tea leaf salad is nearly indistinguishable from the ones you'll find at BS or Mandalay and appears to be more authentic (compared to some home tea leaf salad mixes I've tried). The taste is entirely another animal - very strong flavors, garlic, spicy, and a more briny fermented taste. It's good, though I have to say I like BS's version the best. In the catfish chowder category, Yamo's version has more oomph than Mandaly's version. Their curry chicken w/ noodles was greasy and pretty unmemorable flavor-wise, save for the chicken being tender. \n\nCheck it out during lunch hour and make sure they're open that day (I think they're closed Mondays). When it comes down to it, Yamo's a good, cheap alternative to its two more illustrious siblings. No, I'm not saying Jan Brady was easy.", "author": "Steph P."}

The food was pretty tasty, although on a little on the greasy side...but hey, that's restaurant food.  My friends and I shared samusas, the tea salad, and we each got our own entree dish (I got the curry fish with noodles)  Samusas were great, well seasoned with enough kick to give your tongue a tickle.  Tea salad was great too--a lot like the \"tea leaf salads\" you get at other Burmese restaurants, but this place is a bit more authentic.  Tea leaf salads traditionally are made with cabbage (which this one was)... but at most establishments like Burma Superstar or Pagan, they use romaine lettuce since we Americans eat more romaine than cabbage.  Curry fish was OK, but my friends who got the curry chicken and mango chicken loved theirs.  The curry fish, which had batter around it, wasn't deep-fried, but instead was panfriend, a lot like how my mom cooks it.  I would have preferred it to be deep-fried, that way the fish is a lot crispier. . .so instead, everytime I ate each bite of fish, it was like chewing into something kinda soggy...so that didn't sit too well on my palate, despite the good flavor.\n\nPricing of this food is really cheap--the appetizers are like $3.25 and entrees are like $5.25.  So you definitely get full way fast at such a low price.\n\nThe place is opened by 3 Chinese ladies.  Me being Chinese I couldn't help but listen in on their conversations.  I found their conversations to be quite entertaining!\n\nSince this place only seats about 8-10 people, there is usually a line out ther door.  Last night, when my friends and I went...it was raining, but fortunately when we had gotten in, there were 4 seats for all of us.  There really isn't a \"prime time\" for eating dinner, since it's pretty crowded during all hours of dinner time.", "author": "Matthew L."}

Every dish had its unique flavors and none of dishes tasted what I expected. Even the pot stickers surprised me. Their use of fried broad beans to give the crunchy element is smart and inexpensive which is probably how they keep their cost down. The use of ginger is ingenious to give that spiciness you need, but not the norm of spicy you expect. If you crave for spicier, sriracha and other hot sauce condiments are available, but I would not suggest putting them on until you try a few bites and let the original flavors kick in.

We went in at 5:30 tonight and ordered the food as take out. I ordered tofu curry with noodles, husband ordered chicken curry with noodles, and we shared samosas. The samosas were over fried, but still had good flavor. My noodles were over cooked and soggy, no texture. The tofu was fine as were the fresh mushroom, onions and green peppers. The sauce was unacceptable. No flavor, just oil, literally no flavor- I'm thinking that some ingredients for the sauce were forgotten- there honestly was no flavor- just a lot of oil. Since I was at home, I drained out the oil, added ponzu sauce and chili paste to attempt to add flavor. I was disappointed because we've walked past a few times and there was always a wait and the cooking aromas lofted in the air. I should add that my husband felt the same about his Chicken curry noodles, but rather than try to add flavor, he just put it in the compost and made a veggie burger instead.

You walk in, sit down and are given a menu and half of a greeting.  Whatever sounds good to you, you order.  That sounds wrong but I've been trying to find something here that I don't wolf down in minutes and have failed miserably.  The mango chicken is awesome as are any of the curries.  The black bean fish is totally not in my usual area but I was almost licking the plate after the last succulent morsel went down my throat.  On cold days, the chicken noodle soup here does the job.\n\nIf the great food wasn't enough, probably the prices are the best draw.  With no entree over $6, yet nearly each enough for one, this place is an incredible bargain for quality food.  Even if you're a hungry kid like me and must have two entrees (or just want to try more things on the menu), $12 for a guaranteed stomach fill is still a deal.\n\nThe only concern here is the line since this place holds 9-10 diners max but worst case scenario they do takeout which I can't see disappointing anybody.\n\nIn fact I'm already planning on having lunch here on Monday, maybe even Tuesday too.

It might be because the hole in the wall that Yamo calls home is comparable in size to a muni car.  And let's be honest, riding muni during rush hour sucks.  You can never get a seat at the bar and you're constantly rubbing shoulders with people to order.  Once you do get your opportunity to order, you better do it correctly or else the intimidating Burmese women might let you have it.  \n\nFor starters, I'd recommend hitting up Yamo during non-peak hours.  If you do manage to get a seat at the bar, I'd recommend sitting as far away from the door as possible.  I'd also recommend getting a fresh coconut to sip on while you wait.  \n\nAs far as food goes, I'm a huge fan of the Tea Salad, House Fried Chow Mein, and Yamo House Noodles.  Don't expect much from these dishes in terms of size as everything on the menu is only $6.  \n\nI highly recommend Yamo because it is a unique experience.  You probably won't be able to absorb another experience like this one anywhere else in San Francisco. \n\n*If you're looking to eat and beat the line, call your order in and pick it up 15 minutes later.

I didn't get what all the hype was about because my co-worker, who loves this place, journeyed all the the way here by Muni to pick up lunch. I thought the curry was disappointing. Maybe because I had not developed a taste for Burmese food yet.\n\nSo, I decided to give Yamo a second try. This time, I ordered the Fish chowder soup and the Mango chicken to go.\n\nAgain, after the first few bites... not impressed. The flavor and spices seemed odd. But then it started to click. I found myself cramming down all the food. I really enjoyed the spiciness of the mango chicken. Though, the dish was kinda greasy, I liked the flavors and the perfect amount of heat, which gave this dish a nice kick.\n\nThe Fish chowder soup was just as good. Unfortunately, I ran out of noodles to go with the soup... But, the soup did go well with a package of ramen the next morning. That was a tasty breakfast.\n\nSo, I'd be back for take-out the next time I'm around the Mission. Space is really small... kinda dirty... prices are good.\n\nAs Paul Rudd would probably say...

Granted, their entire restaurant is tiny, so they make do with what they have. They do have food to go, and will take your order ahead of people waiting for tables if you're on the move.\n\nAs for food, I'll start with appetizers. Tried the pot stickers, lots of flavor, perfectly cooked. not too crispy, not soggy. The spring rolls are large. you get two large ones with a nice peanut sauce. They're quite refreshing! The Samusas were awesome. Tons of flavor, they're taking taters to the max here. Try popping them with your chopstick to vent. mine were hot, and you won't want to burn your tongue and miss the flavor bonanza coming later. \n\nChef selections: I tried the mango chicken and the beef curry with noodles. Quite different dishes, both were fantastic. The beef in my dish almost tasted as though it were marinated in marsala, I'm not sure if they did or not, but it was subtle and a really great flavor to compliment the rest of the dish. The curry was fairly light in quantity compared to other curries I've had, but this was a good thing. No one flavor dominated, it just tasted like a recipe that has been perfected over a long time. One of the other guys eating there said it best: you're about to have the sort of meal your grandmother would cook for you. The mango chicken was very refreshing. The mango pieces actually made me laugh out loud - they were that good. I'm not sure if they marinate those too, but wow. Something about the combo of mango and the lightly seasoned chicken, it was a great dish. \n\nNow for the best parts: PRICE. four of us ate appetizers and main dishes for $26. whaaaaat? yeah 26 bucks. granted two girls shared one dish, but seriously. It's almost not even fair. They got a big tip. And now for you more adventurous types - there is a powerful dishwasher under the far end of the bar seating.

Curry does not automatically make it Burmese...HMPF I've still not had convincing Burmese food...outside of Burma/Myanmar (STILL craving Shan Noodle Soup).\n\nWhat really gets this place a good ol' OK is the price, at $5.25 for nearly every dish, with large satisfying amounts, its definitely a place to consider if you're short on change and want to greasify your stomach (maybe after damaging ur body with alcohol...or other stuff...)!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-24", "description": "*Note: This review is coming from somebody who grew up in a Burmese family and has mucho experience in the world of Burmese cuisine.\n\nI'll give it 4 stars for a few reasons:\n\n1) This place truly defines the whole \"hole in the wall\" home-style comfort food image. \n\n2) Price to portion ratio is great. It's uncommon in SF to find good tasting food at a friendly price, but this little hole in the wall definitely delivers. \n\n3) The food actually tastes good! When I went the restaurant was packed with people ordering the house noodles and cold noodles, so we went with the crowd favorite. They do not dissapoint, the flavoring on the noodles is just right (a little greasy, but that's how it's supposed to be) and you can have them with your choice of beef, chicken, fish or vegetarian (tofu/mushroom I believe).\n\nNow, a couple of things to look out for, the main thing being that this restaurant is extremely small and compact. It seats about 10 people (bar style) at most so most likely if you drop by you're going to have to wait. The cook and waitresses also do not speak English very well, but they are VERY friendly, so I'm sure you'll get by just fine! They seem rude (at least I thought so when I was waiting and observing) but once I sat down I was pretty much family to them.\n\nIn terms of authenticity it's not too far off from actual Burmese cuisine. Sure it's tweaked a little bit for the American taste (I mean, come on... Burma (Myanmar) is a third world country, so they don't have the luxury of putting so many ingredients into their dishes). However, the seasonings for the noodles are pretty spot on.\n\nIf you just want to come here for delicious noodles, over-rice dishes, pot stickers, samosas (pronounced samUsa in the restaurant because that's how you say it in Burmese) or egg rolls then this is a place that will not let you down!\n\nHowever, if you want to try authentic Burmese food, definitely grab an order of Tea leaf salad, or either of the two soups. I'm not a fan of fish chowder (not Yamo's fish chowder, just fish chowder in general) but the Chicken Noodle Soup (uses coconut based broth) is definitely a favorite of mine! And the house & cold noodles are also authentic to Burmese cooking, so give any of those a try to experience Burmese food (especially the Tea leaf salad). I only actually tried the house noodles because my parents can make everything else at home (and they do! very often...), but I'm just telling you what to try if you want authentic Burmese food.", "author": "Ron T."}

A classmate of mine took me here after a trek of the Mission and we were hungry. So we came here. \n\nThe food's tasty here, I had the curry chicken with noodles and I have to say, Burmese curry is a little more saltier than Vietnamese or Cambodian curries and it has the consistency of Thai curries. It was still enjoyable, the lady at the counter asked me if I wanted the regular chow mein noodles or the chow fun noodles. I had the thinner chow mein noodles which worked nicely with the curry. \n\nAll in all, I would have given this place 4 stars - but 2 things first. Portions and service. I would have liked to see a little more sizewise, and my glass of water could have been topped off a little more frequently but I understand the 2 ladies who are the cooks and waiter/servers here are busy.

Everything is about $5 and very tasty (and a little heavy, might I add). The tea leaf salad is a must try. On the first date, I had the Mango Chicken which was pretty delicious. On the second and third time, I had the Curry Prawns with noodles, which are really good too. This is definitely no Burma Superstar, but for the price, it's worth it.\n\nI've read some of the other reviews here and noticed that some have complained about the cramped space and lack of cleanliness of the locale. Dude, it's a hole in a wall, you have to expect something to give for the low prices.\n\nBTW, if you're Chinese, don't get too confused by the Cantonese-Mandarin-Taiwanese speaking owners.

Hard to tell if they are really mad or if they are just concentrating really hard on cooking the food.  Eyebrows are permanently fixed in the upset position.             \n\nThe small menu pairs together time tested traditional ingredients with simple dish concepts to create food that is surprisingly complex in flavor.  In a few words... this place may not look like much, but everything taste delicious.  \n   \nThe Tea Leaf salad is as good as or better than any other in the city (including Burma SuperStar and Mandalay) and at half the price.  Ultimately, in a battle of tea leaf salads, I'd put my money on this horse to win, because at the end of the day good restaurants are defined by their VALUE.  (Quality to price ratio) \n\nThe catfish chowder has a savory aroma that will make you want to lift the bowl up directly to your mouth like you were drinking the remaining milk from a cereal bowl and with its great flavor it is absolutely worth a try.  Good for casual soup cravings and fantastic if you have a cold (or the h1n1 virus.)  \n\nThe house noodles with beef was off the charts tasty delicious and is definitely a must.  The beef is very tender and explodes with flavor... I'm talking fireworks in the mouth good.  The noodles are cooked to a perfect texture and absorb the components of the sauce very well.   \n \nParking situation is horrendous, that is if you plan on driving to this place.  You are definitely better off taking the bus, biking, or walking if you do not live in the surrounding area.  \n\nSimple counter-style dining that can only accommodate 10-12 people at any given time.  Meaning long lines and long waits.  Go before or after peak dining hours and you will not have any problems snagging one of the few counter stools.  Take-out is also easy and convenient with temporary illegal parking available in the back alley.    \n\nA meal for two will set you back no more than $15-$20.  In the value department it is always a great option and does not leave you with that heavy/greasy feeling often associated with this type of cuisine. \n  \nYAMO eat at this restaurant whenever I'm in town. \n\nRecommended", "author": "Raphael C."}

And you know what that means? Delicious and cheap food!  The place is really small, they only seat around 9 people if you want to dine in. You will also smell of grease and smoke after dining in because the tight space and because they cook right in front of you. We opted to just order take out and eat at Dolores Park, a walking distance that is just a couple of blocks away. The wait was long but it was worth it. \n\nI ordered the tea leaf salad and samusas! Both of the dishes are the bomb. I love the nutinness and crunchiness of the tea leaf salad. I was expecting greens; I was somewhat hesitant to order the salad because I was super hungry and because I didn't feel like eating leaves at that time. Although the salad is small in portion, it is very rich and savory. It was also a bit spicy but the spiciness added more kick. The samusas were tasty but I cant say they are the best tasting ones. My friends and I also shared our meals. The cold noodle was pretty standard yet it was still delicious. The mango chicken was tasty as well but it wasn't one of our favorites. \n\nWould I go back again? Heck yeah. It's pretty cheap and I feel that the portions are about right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-26", "description": "Arrived in SF from Vancouver by way of LA. Famished. Having stashed and stowed my luggage and what-not I headed out to find a meal. It was near 8pm and I had to cross town to the Mission in this vast new city in order to get dinner at Yamo which closes at 9:30. Authentic Burmese food. Colour me intrigued. I walk through the Tenderloin District toward the Civic Centre BART station. This area of town is akin to Vancouver's Downtown East Side and the poverty is apparent everywhere. I come to an elevator and stupidly get in to take it down to the station.\n\nI am standing in a urinal. It's like I am actually immersed in a giant toilet. I press the button to go down and the slowest elevator in the universe begins it's descent. I touch nothing and can't decide whether to breathe through my nose and smell it, or mouth and OH FUCK... I can taste it. Urine and human filth. Puddles of piss and other unidentifiable stains keep me locked in one spot and I swear I will never ever take the lazy way out again.\n\nI arrive on the platform, efficient and easy the BART - essentially a subway - takes my 30 blocks or so in about 5 minutes. Nice. I get out and play the fun traveller game of re-orienting myself, of course this involves walking a block the wrong way as I don't like to ask people for directions. I circle around and go a block past where I need to be. I chuckle at my stupidity.\n\nI track down Yamo and the line is out the door. I'm about the fifth person back from the door. Inside 3 Asian woman work the line bellowing at each other in what I assume is Burmese but given that there are over 100 languages spoken in Burma I'm not sure. It's Cantonese-y sounding... The place is narrow and small. The hood vents don't seem to work and there is a layer of grey grease and dust on the walls and some surfaces. The open line is chaotic but seems clean enough. I guess. The place only seats 10 people and right now they are all young hip white people in their twenties and thirties. I fit right in. Usually at a place like this it's nice if everyone is of the ethnicity of the food but while I trust that I also trust faux-poor hipsters in their ability to find good cheap eats. 15 minutes and I'm in and seated at the end. It's cramped and I have to move my leg when one of the cooks needs to access the dishwasher. I really do love eating like this. The service is harsh and abrupt. Usually a good sign. Her English is limited but I just point to what I want. A traditional catfish noodle chowder and some dumplings. She get's to work. Everyone eating is friendly and chatting and I engage the couple to my left in conversation while on my right I avoid being hit by the door of the dishwasher which is causing my stool to vibrate in a delightful manner. My and my dinner companions chuckle about this. My food arrives. The dumplings aren't made in house which is a let-down. I saw her pull them from a bag in the freezer. Expectations low I take a bite. They are pretty good, boiled and then pan fried making one side delightfully crisp. A nice cabbage to pork ratio and heavy on the ginget which I like. They are served with a dipping sauce much like Vietnamese Nuoc Cham, sweet vinegary fishy. Yum..\n\nMy chowder arrives. It's thick and hot. The fish is in small chunks interspersed amongst thick egg noodles. It is pleasantly fishy and deliciously thick. A wafer like fried to crunchy type thing with bits of fried corn in it are broken up over the surface. It tastes a bit like a wheat cracker and I ask one of the women what this is.\n\"I don't know!\" She spits out, \"I'm just the cook!\" She grins a massive grin laughing wildly and returns to hacking the tops off young coconut with a massive cleaver. Her speed and precision are astonishing. I return to me meal. I'm getting quite full so I offer my dumplings to the couple beside me. The thank me and finish the plate. I feel the onset of a food coma and I know I have to get to my feet and move soon. I had noticed a little bar called the Elbo Room around the corner and a pint was exactly waht I needed. My food and a bottle of water was $12 with tax n' tip. Nothing on the menu was over $6 and it was totally worth the wait.", "author": "Christopher N. W."}

It's not worth my time when there is good food aplenty in the neighborhood. The crowded times are very centralized, so you can easily get a coveted seat inside right before or after noon. Never plan to sit inside though and it certainly would not happen if your group is more than 3 people. Even though you'd think there'd be a commotion in the kitchen, those ladies actually cook at a pace not close to a flurry. And the service isn't even friendly. As for the food, the house noodles is the favorite here. I love that it had a buttload of garlic and a little bit of spicy, but nothing spectacular otherwise. I like the tea leaf salad a lot, which has a ton of crispy parts like deep fried fava beans. But that is one tiny dish. The fish curry noodle soup was good. The fish was nicely fried and the broth was milky. Though the prices are cheap, they are only cheap relative to everything else around.

This place is one long counter and the food is cooked right in front of you. \n\nOn the massive recommendations, I tried the Mango Chicken with a Mexican coke while my friend had the tea salad. She mentioned that the salad \"had a kick\", and I would say the same for the Mango Chicken. My chicken came on a plate with white rice and crispy fresh stir fried veggies. Nothing was too oily, salty, or spicy. This dish was exactly what I hoped it would be. The big chunks of mango made this dish even better, as I love the taste of mango with chilies. \n\nThe staff was so polite to us given the pace that they have to keep to make sure the line outside does not get too long.

Based on Yelp recommendations, we got the tea salad which was a lot smaller than I expected (1/2 the size they give you at Burma Superstar), the house noodle with beef, and the curry prawns.  \n\nThe Tea Salad was pretty good.  While it was small, it was indeed very flavorful.  I'm not sure what they put in this, but it's pretty addicting. \n\nThe Curry Prawns are pretty spicy.  The shrimp is just your normal frozen shrimp with a light curry sauce with some onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers.  I wasn't a huge fan but it also wasn't horrible. \n\nI had high hopes for the House Noodles but while the texture of the noodles were good, the taste is just like any other place that stir fry's in egg noodles in a ton of oil.  The noodles are extremely oil with pretty mild flavor.  I think the chow mein noodles at a decent chinese restaurant are equivalent to what they serve here. \n\nWhen people say \"hole in the wall\" they're not kidding.  The place looks very run down and the counter seating is very squishy.  Apparently there are lines out the door during lunch time, well that's because there is absolutely no space inside the door if you don't want to be rubbing shoulders with someone.  I also noticed that this place had no ventilation so I felt like I was suffocating just waiting for my food.  \n\nWould probably not come back unless I was drunk but I guess it wasn't a bad experience, but not something crave-worthy.", "author": "Kristie G."}

Good Burmese food, but also a fun/bizarre TINY hole in the wall that is an experience in and of itself.  I have actually had a frustrating experience of waiting 45 minutes for a delivery order that I had placed on the phone BEFORE driving to Yamo, so that was infuriating, but given that the whole place consists of three women and a space the size of a walk-in closet, I decided to let it go.  \n\nAfter only experiencing Yamo via take-out, I ate inside Yamo this evening.  I loved it!  First of all, it feels like an accomplishment just to get a seat because there are so few.  Once I was hunkered down along the counter, I set my sights on the young coconut, the tea salad, and the chicken noodle soup -- based on a fellow Yelper's recommendations.  YUM!  The tea salad is a party in your mouth.  So many flavors, and so much crunch.  I loved it.  The chicken noodle soup is not to be confused at ALL with good ol' Campbells in a can.  This soup is more like a spicy curry - and it's very, very good.  I ordered a spring roll as a starter, and it was fine, but not thrilling.  Pretty standard spring roll.  The young coconut was delicious - and it's fun to drink directly from a straw in a coconut!\n\nAll of this for $16.50!\n\nThis place gives a new meaning to \"hole in the wall.\"  If you haven't gone, you must!\n\nAlso - don't forget to have cash on hand.

He suggested this place because there aren't many Burmese food places in the city, its cheap, and its good (high flavor/cost ratio).\n\nThis place is insanely small.. and there was a line out the door. Lucky for us, somehow everyone in the restaurant finished at the same time and we got in before the next rush.\n\nHouse Special Fried Rice - this was very good. The rie had great texture and the satay flavors were good. There wasn't much heat, so sauce it up accordingly. There also was a good amount of small shirmps in the dish, which added some fill to it, but if anything the satay makes the dish.\n\nHouse Noodles with Beef - garlicky and tender beef is all I could think of. This is the Asian equivalence of Peruvian Beef and Noodles, but without the tomatoes... at least to me it was. The noodles were a nice al dente, so obvious plus points for that. The steak was ultra tender, and the deglazings from the pan were used for the sauce of the dish, which was amazingly flavorful. I don't know if cilantro is growing on me, but it again worked on this dish, as the freshness cut through the oiliness and saltiness of the sauce (this saltiness and oiliness is far from a bad thing when it comes to sauce/delgazing/gravy, at least to me). And the garlic. A good amount of fried garlic and the garlic oil added to the dish. That put me over the top. This garlic was crisp and had a good amount of spice to probably also counteract the additional freshness of the cilantro that overwhelms me. Additionally, its not so overpowering to mute the rest of the dish. This dish was very home style and so good. I honestly should have split this into 2 meals.\n\nI probably would order something over the house special fried rice the next time around. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but there were other things on the menu that looked great, but Edgar and I were looking to carb up. Definitely am coming back here for the samosas, salad, and mango dishes! Everything was like 6 buck", "author": "Marc T."}

The two of us ordered Beef Curry and Mango Chicken with a spring roll appetizer (which is actually a summer roll - cold salad wrapped in rice paper). \n\nThe beef curry was very basic with potatoes and VERY succulent beef pieces. The flavor was perfect, tasty and spicy. My friend's Mango Chicken was white meat chicken stir-fried with fresh mango chunks, bell pepper, sugar snap peas, carrots and onions. He's Venezuelan, so he loved his mango dish, but I really preferred my curry. The spring rolls were actually summer rolls, so we were kinda thrown off when they were served. If you want the real spring rolls, then you should order the egg rolls from the menu. The guy next to us ordered the potsticker appetizer and there were 6 savory, meat filled dumpings on his plate. Next time, I will def try those bad boys!!!\n\nSince there are only 10 or so counter seats, there is always a line to get in. We went late, close to 10pm so there were only 2 people ahead of us in the line to get seated. My friend had gone before, so he knew to order our food while we were standing in line to get seated. So, when we did sit down, our appetizer came right out and our entrees were about 4 minutes behind. \n\nNow, if you go to restaurants because they are clean and sanitary with exceptional service, then Yamo is not the place for you. This place is one of the grimiest dive restaurants that I've seen outside of Southeast Asia. The 3 older ladies that were working (one cooking, one taking orders / chopping the veggies, one doing the dishes) were working so hard with their tasks that it's hard to get any extra service besides ordering your food and getting your check. If you want water or a soda, you might have to ask each of the ladies twice before you get your drink. In fact, it might be smart to bring your own water or soda so you don't have to worry about asking (bothering) the super hard workin ladies. There is an no alcohol policy so don't try taking in any booze. \n\nAlso, if you're done eating, get your ass up and get out the door because some other hongry fools are waiting to get their grub on!!!

I could not imagine having a sit down meal here, but I am definitely alright with take-out from here.  So, I suspect that when I called in my order that they never actually placed the order.  It seems like the women that run this operation are a bit disjunct from normal protocol.  However, it was interesting to watch them hustle while having such fluid communication that was a mixture of shouting, quickly teetering back and forth and an occasional hand gestures here and there.  There were some other items that sounded delectable, but just seeing the cascade of dishes ordered by the people that managed to get ahold of seats there seemed like it would spike my cholesterol levels ten fold.  I think these ladies should conceptualize a new branding strategy, where they prepare, mince, chop, and serve your meal directly into your mouth from across the kitchen with a flick of the wrist.  I would pay to see that unfold.", "author": "Ty T."}

They did have some healthier options on the menu that looked interesting though, like the tea salad and the mango salad. The place is often crowded with a line out the door, but that's partly because it's literally a hallway with a cramped row of bar stools-no tables here.  Once I got in though, the service was speedy. I'd eat here again, as an alternative to fast food, greasy Chinese or a taco, but not a place for a romantic date, unless your date is impressed by your ability to spot descent hole in the walls.

It is a small Burmese establishment with bar seating, instantly I was intrigued. I had never tried Burmese food, and quickly became excited. There are about 10 seats, so finding a stool next to my buddy took about 5 minutes.  The three women running the show? They mean business.  When seating becomes available, you are quickly handed a menu and \"encouraged\" to order.  The kitchen is on the other side of the bar, so you can watch as everything is being prepared from scratch.  Between the sizzles of the skillets, pots and pans clanging, and the cooks yelling back and forth, it really becomes quite a show.  I ordered a fish curry for about 6 bucks, and it was very tasty. The fish was cooked excellently, had a good kick to it, and the curry sauce rounded out the dish nicely.  The food comes directly from the stove, and temperature wise,  nice and hot.  The assortment of chili peppers available enable you to add a little more heat to your dish, which I personally am a fan of. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience, and definitely will make it back soon.", "author": "Billy O."}

It's made with some kind of yam and spices but I honestly couldn't taste much because my tongue was in pain! \n\nTea Salad - $5.25, It's cheaper but smaller than the ones you'd find in the Richmond District. It's also spicier. The ingredients weren't as colorful and fresh looking as I'm used to. I prefer more of the nutty taste so I was hoping for more sunflower seeds and peanuts. I'd probably skip this one next time.\n\nFresh Coconut Juice - $2.50, Pretty sure everyone has had one of these but that doesn't make it any less tasty! It's a real, young coconut with the top cut off served with a straw and a spoon so you can dig into the coconut meat after you finish the juice. I say it's way worth it since you could pay that much just for a coconut at the market. I'm also too afraid of trying this at home again. Coconut shells are like rocks!\n\nMango Chicken - $5.25, with your choice of house noodles or white rice. I got the noodles and they were quite tasty! They were eggy and chewy in the good way. My friend was surprised they had real mango chunks and they were big too! This dish also came with green peppers, bits of chili peppers (so more spice!) and big flavorful chicken chunks.

Most people call in to order, then walk over in 10-15 mins to pick it up. It's just not comfortable to eat there. I bet it gets miserably hot during warm weather too.\n\nSERVICE: So-so. It's slightly confusing to order, because you have to flag down a lady. Feels like placing an order at a bar, getting the bartender's attention over people seated at the bar.\n\nVISIT DETAILS: Take-out dinner with a friend most recent time, seat-down the previous time (probably took 20-30 mins wait to get two seats during dinner time)", "author": "C L."}

The door opens up into a narrow \"hall\" that is only wide enough to let one person (I'm talking about a size10 max person... well below the US weight/size average of 163lbs/size14) to squeeze past, bounded by a wall on the right, and a narrow counter top/seats lining the left. Three Burmese ladies man the kitchen space, which is immediately behind the counter: One is in charge of all wok related cooking, one takes orders and prepares ingredients for the wok lady, and the last one takes orders and cleans up after patrons.\n\nYamo is very simple and straight forward. You wait for a spot to open up, order your food from a limited (but extremely cheap) menu, watch your food being cooked, chow down, pay the bill, and leave. I highly doubt that it is authentic Burmese food... it tastes very Chinese to me. However, it IS very much homestyle cooking, which is nice, especially since nothing costs over $6. Pictured below is the \"Yamo noodles\"... regarded quite highly on yelp, but turned out to be a bit of a bland disappointment.

We happened to go on a weekday around 12:15. I guess everyone waited to avoid the lunch crowd. Sucks for them b/c they all showed up at 1pm! \n\nAs for the food, it's all about the house noodles. I tried the pork (good, but the beef looked like it had that glazed, salty, saucy appearance I always crave) and my friend asked for the noodles and tofu (not on menu). The noodles are perfectly cooked and textured from wherever they bought them (I assume - they were uniformly piled in stacked bowls). The resulting broth/gravy/sauce that hits the bottom is heaven's nectar.  Watch the cook seamlessly mix the dozen or so ingredients (topped by some fried garlic flakes! Yow!).

When we arrived, there were 3 female cooks working their butts off for a small line. The place itself can hold maybe 10 sitting customers and the rest order to go. There's no order when serving their customers and it seemed like it's easy for them to forget your order, especially when there's a long line of customers. \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I hadn't eaten all day and we ordered the tea salad, mango chicken, and yamo house noodles with chicken. (You can also order fresh coconut drink, which they will cut up open for you on the spot!) The mango chicken with rice was very good. It didn't feel heavy in your stomach and the vegetables were pretty fresh. My favorite was the tea salad. I didn't see them make it but I think they have this mixture of nuts or something that goes really well with the salad.

A MISTAKE! Everyone knows that one of the basic rules in cooking is to season the food. What I got was a plate of uber blandness. At least the chicken was tender. I was tempted to pour soy sauce all over my dish and mind you, I rarely do such a foolish thing. \nWhere was the spice in our spicy curry tofu?! Where was that rich, the extra kick in flavor that usually accompanies curry? It wasn't there. It was all forgettable.

I was concerned about the fish quality, but hey, I lived to write this review with no stomach upsets! Also, loved that the veg curry had okra. \n\nThe place is small - it's like a little food bar - you seat yourself based on available space, and sit facing the chefs.

It's a very basic eating experience that is perfect for a quick eat; however, not for the wheelchair bound, children, dog owners, or people who can't sit up on bar stools.\n\nI was the only customer here yet it was a quite loud.  The refrigerator or something made a long thumping sound and stopped after awhile.  The two ladies talk to each other in yelling pitch cantonese.  It's kinda funny how loud this place is after you get used to it.\n\nI asked for a recommendation and the lady advise me to have the \"Cold Noodles\".  The dish is like a spicy noodle salad served with temperature hot chicken.  It also has spring onion, cilantro, cucumber, carrots, and bean sprouts.  The dish isn't as fire hot as I expected yet it was just spicy enough that I could still taste my food while getting a kick.  Even so, if you don't like spicy food don't get this dish as my nose started to run profusely and I needed to resort to my can of 7-Up constantly.  Portions are just right.  I wasn't too stuffed but rather on the verge of being so.\n\nTalking to the staff was fun.  They're really friendly and open for chit chat.  They said that a sign was supposed to be put up during winter break but the \"guy\" didn't come around.  Regular customers don't want the sign to go up so they can have the place all to themselves.  Selfish pigs! lol\n\nMy dish was really good but not out of the ballpark great.  It tastes like good ol' home cooking, nothing wrong with that.  I think I've only had Burmese food a couple other times so it was good finding another place.  The staff recommends the soup and curries as some of their most popular dishes.  I asked myself, \"Then why am I eating 'cold noodles'?\"\n\n___\n\nI'd definitely come back to try out more of the fairly priced menu.", "author": "Michael H."}

It is super small--either expect to wait or come early or late or as I do pick up and take home (prefer eating my order at home to enjoy with beer or wine).  No beer or wine license and strict warning about bringing your own.  It could be a perfectly sunny day and yet inside it is dark and reddish.\n\nI am fascinated by the three cooks working what seems to be nearly effortless work but upon closer inspection is a careful and learned way of cooking.  This must be brutal work--cooking and waiting all at the same time.  It looks like it must be super hot with the gas burner cooking all day.  \n\nI enjoy the curry chicken--Burmese style--hence no coconut milk or tomatoe or cream.  Very spice and the potatoes pick up the flavor of the spicing quite well and together don't become a filler but a great accompaniment.\n\nSo when you think this might be a Burma Superstar Jr. it isn't but presents a much simpler fare.  I do like coming here for  inexpensive takeout but for several reasons it is not my destination restaurant to bring family and friends.  A great place to watch an amazingly orchestrated cooking experience.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

You might order the popular tea leaf salad, samusas, some curry, or whatever else you fancy. What you get is appropriately greasy, appropriately delicious, and the perfect quantity for cheap.

While I read a few reviews raving about the tea salad and how it is so much better than Burma Superstar's version, I must WHOLEHEARTEDLY disagree.  There really is very little tea leaf in the Yamo tea salad.  While tasty, it is almost comparable to campbell's \"chicken\" noodle soup, where the chicken flavor is there, but the chicken is MIA from the whole equation.  \n\nThe samusas were average, but nothing to go out of the way for.  The beef curry that I ordered was dripping with oil, lacked any flavor (no spice at all) and I just couldn't make myself finish it.\n\nYes, it is cheap (2 curry meals, 1 tea leaf salad, 1 order of samusas = $19.20 w/o tip) and it may be convenient for some, but I just can't imagine eating there again.

You SMELL like grease even if you just poke your head inside for 2 seconds. \n\nUndaunted and confident that my Yelpers wouldn't lead me wrong I orderd two standards- tea leaf salad and the cold noodles with chicken. 15 minutes the little lady behind the counter said. \n\nI stood just inside the door secretly wishing I could prop it open, and watched as the two ladies ran a bumbling and inefficient orchestra of food preparation. One would do something- i'm not quite sure what, but it wasn't very purposeful- causing the other to fall behind on whatever she was doing. One was fishing out some fried egg rolls from the fryer and the other mumbled to her that she should get my order finished and out the door since I had been there for more than 15 minutes and my food had been sitting in it's containers for at least 5, waiting for lids. \n\nI managed to escape the grease pit and drove back to work with my windows all the way down the entire way, trying to shake off the lingering tell-tale scent of a greasy spoon joint; much like a hooker's cheap perfume marking a travelling business man's shirt.\n\nSo how was it? The tea salad was a heap of disappointment. Highly salty and spicy hot, it contained a TON of little fried crunchy things. Fried onions, fried garlic, fried pumpkin seeds, fried lentils, fried batter bits; you get the picture? Oh, it had a small amount of shredded cabbage too, thinly sliced red onion, peanuts, sesame seeds and trace amounts of green onion, but by far the prevailing theme here was oil and drenching things in them. The crowning glory was that it was toped with cilantro. Shoot me now.\n\nDeciding I had enough disappointment/torture, I moved on to the cold noodles with chicken, and this was an odd dish because given the name, one might be led to believe that the dish is actually cold. Oh, no my friend. This it is not. The chicken was cooked in a mildly spicy chili/onion oil/sauce. Have I mentioned the oily mess yet? If I didn't twirl the noodles perfectly, it would flick oil. Onto my face, my clothes, my desk. It was like noodle oil bukkake. Not only was I smothered in it from the inside out, but now I'm being bathed in it too. \n\nAfter a few more bites of coating my arterial walls, I claimed surrender and put a lid on the offending meal. I felt as if I had cooking oil poured over me, and have had an uncontrollable desire to take a long, hot showers with industrial strength Dawn since then. Just because a place is inexpensive, doesn't mean it needs to be greasy.\n\nUp-side: at least I won't have to moisturize or use conditioner for the next week.

I fear you will continue to be an amazing deal on super awesome food until you are slowly overtaken by the masses as they crowd me out of your precious ten square feet of seating!\n\nIf you've ever been to Art's Cafe in the Inner Sunset, the setup is similar: twenty-odd feet of bar stool seating where you are served piping hot meals while you watch them being made, all for less than the price of a cocktail at one of the many hip new joints down the street.\n\nThe ladies who run Yamo are entertaining to watch as they hustle hungry diners in and out of the joint, coconuts and cold noodles flying all the while.  Speaking of coconuts, nothing soothes a throat full of Burmese spiced noodles like a fresh coconut, hacked open right in front of you by a sexagenarian who could definitely kick your ass.\n\nThe cold noodles are worth trying, but my vote would have to be for the mango chicken.  The spring rolls we ordered last night were on the bad side of average, but the entrees are delicious, generously portioned, and crazy cheap.  A meal for two will run you under $20 for both entrees, an appetizer, and two coconuts, with leftovers to spare, or you can grab a single entree for only $5.25.\n\nThe wait is never too long (for now...) but ordering to go is always a good idea, unless you're staying in the area for other reasons.  They're also open for lunch -- smaller crowd, no wait, and fresh coconuts on a hot summer afternoon -- What's not to love?", "author": "Melissa T."}

A line forms on the right of the entrance for seating.  A line forms on the left of the entrance for take out.  I was a little skeptical, at first, waiting without my name on a list, but it turned out alright.\n\nI got there at exactly 7:34, on a Tuesday.  There were 6 people ahead of us, but considering the place seats maybe 10 total, that turned into an hour long wait.  I thought the wait at Burma Superstar was kind of absurd, so when 8:29 stuck and we weren't seated yet, I proclaimed: \"Fuck.\" (We said we wouldn't do this.)\n\nWe decided to keep waiting and didn't have to wait much longer than that, thankfully.   Based on friends' reviews, we started with the tea leaf salad.  I thought it was very good:  a stab of spice mixed with the crunch of nuts and refreshing crisp of lettuce leaf.\n\nNext came the Curry Beef with Noodles and I found them to be light on the oil, but full of flavor.  At this point I was starting to wonder why we hadn't gotten our other appetizer, the samusas, yet.  \n\nThey showed up to the party a little late and when I bit into one, I nearly spit it out, exclaiming, \"Holy shit that's good!\"  Luckily, for those around me, I managed to keep that sucker in my mouth, although I was surprised by how good it was.\n\nWe also tried those grass jelly drinks out of curiosity and they were okay.  They have bits of grass-flavored jelly(?) in the bottom to add texture to the drink, ie. you need a straw.\n\nThe shape and size of the place really reminded me of a small diner where I would get breakfast in my hometown.  Even though it was my first time there, it felt very familiar, and everything had the appearance of a home cooked dish.\n\nAt the end we were full, and it was 8 dollars each with a 20% tip.", "author": "Adam C."}

First of all, the food is good, like I said, not lick my plate or bowl clean great, but solid.  I've had the Yamo house noodles with beef, and though i was looking for a bit more flavour, the beef was nice and tender and I like the texture of the noodles.  I also had their curry with shrimp and noodles.  Likewise it was pretty good, needed to add some pepper oil for spiciness, but I had no problem finishing this dish.  I have also eaten the potstickers and samosas, both OK.\n\nWhat I love about this place is it's third world charm and simplicity.  I love restaurants that you walk into and feel like you've left the the country.  OK so you could say you feel like you've left the country just walking down Mission to 18th St.  This place feels like a grundgy, slapped together noodle shop you could find down some back alley in SE asia with enough grease built up on the front window to make a meal of if you were brave enough to lick it off (and I mean this in a good way).  I love the simplicity of the menu, all noodle dishes, the same price.  So what if you want chicken, beef, shrimp or veggies, same same same same.   And finally, that price is cheap!  \n\nSummary: CHEAP, GOOD, and I'm sure there's one other thing I could annoyingly capitalize.", "author": "Adrian L."}

The Tea Leaf salad was certainly better than ones which I've made.  The Fish Chowder and Curry Prawn noodle weren't though.  The Fish Chowder was almost inedible due to the overcooked, sludgy rice noodle and the Curry Prawn wasn't a curry in any of the Indian/Thai-sense of the word so I'm not sure why they call it curry.  I was disappointed after waiting for 15 minutes outside for a spot at the bar to eat very mediocre food.  On the upside their menu is very simple and most items are $6 which is reasonable.  Unfortunately that $6 could be put to better use at many other Mexican restaurants in the area.  I can't recommend other Asian restaurants in the Mission but if you can make it to the Chinatown, the Richmond, or Sunset you'll be sure to find better Asian food for $6.  \n\nWhether you like this restaurants depends mostly on yours tastes.  I'm not Burmese but all the places I've had Burmese food in San Francisco have been better.  For some background, I grew up eating Asian food, I shop at Asian markets in San Francisco, own about a dozen Asian cookbooks (Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai) and cook Asian foods most days of the week.

After that your taste buds get kind of overloaded and the dish stops being tasty. Then came the samusas which my friend claimed tasted like pizza rolls! I think he meant the dough, which I do have to agree with. The curry filling was slightly spicy and well-seasoned.\n\nThe entree was the curry chicken over egg noodles. Is it me, or does it taste like a watered down version of Thai yellow curry? I guess I'm used to curries being more in-your-face, so Yamo's was a little boring for me.\n\n I would go back to try out the other menu items that people have recommended, just because I still have faith that I can like Burmese cuisine.

Since I work at a non-profit and our food budget is limited, I'm not too flexible with how much we can spend, but I still have to find a way to feed everyone.  I wanted to order a couple entrees on the party platter menu but the total was something that I knew my organization did not have room to cover.  So then what?  Well first of all the staff rocks and went above and beyond to try to accomodate our hiccup.  Judy was awesome and did everything she could to get her boss Joseph (the owner) on the phone since he wasn't in at the time.  When we were able to get a hold of him, he was incredibly kind and really tried to work with me on the price.  In the end I was able to stay within budget and placed the food order.\n\nFast forward to two days later and all I can say is if you haven't been to Yamo, don't walk, run!  The food was such a hit at the meeting that a couple of us, including myself, couldn't restrain ourselves and got second and third servings.  If there weren't others around I probably would've kept going!  Since I'm vegetarian, I only tried the samusas and curry tofu, both rocked!  Others who had the pork chow mein, mango chicken, and beef curry only had raves to share.\n\nThis place is a little hole in the wall that is easy to overlook, but if you do happen to stop and go in, I guarantee, you will NOT be disappointed!", "author": "Swetha G."}

Seriously, it was like another dimension. It was really special and really different.\n\nYamo used to be a really weird all vegan thai restaurant run by a guy named Ta Wei. Ta Wei had a masters in german expressionism and wanted the place to look like an oversized Joseph Cornell sculpture. He wasn't really a chef. He also wasn't vegan (if you asked he would say he did it for the chicks). Anyone who ate there in the old days would remember how just crazy and weird it was.\n\nHe used to play Bobby Brown on vinyl and would let you come behind the counter and help cook if he liked you. You could BYOB or just settle for the cheap (sometimes free) mexican beer he would lug in everynight. I once traded him guitar lessons for cooking lessons. He made \"sangria\" with some fruit, carlo rossi, a 2 liter of coke and a chunk of tamarind in it. Ta Wei was also a crazy Republican, but you wouldn't know it by his panama hat, hawaiian shirt and giant zero gauge bone ear plugs.\n\nOne day I went to go eat there and it was just closed. Apparently he had had enough of the restaurant biz and sold it so he could travel. Crazy. It was bought by a pair of chinese women and was just a divey noodle joint before they went 'burmese'\n\nThe name by the way was short for \"Yamo Be There\" (Ta Wei always wished he was more gangster).\n\nDoes anyone else remember these days?

It is small.  I ventured in at 130 on a Saturday (actually, 138 because i was late...) and there were plenty of seats available for us.  \n\nThe first thing I did notice when I walked in was the heavy smell of oil.  I knew I was going to stink after I left which bummed me out because I was heading back to a party after...  Grr.\n\nAnyhow, the menu had several options.  All of the dishes were under $6?!?  That's my kind of place!!!!\n\nMy friend who I came with was the professional...  She promptly ordered up the Tea Tree Salad and the Chicken Noodle soup.\n\nI ended up ordering the Tofu Curry, they ask if you want it over noodles or rice.  I chose the noodles, and I'm glad I did!!!\n\nI tried some of my friends Tea Tree salad and it was DELICIOUS.  I wish I just ordered three of them and had that as my meal.....\n\nHer soup looked delicious, and my curry tofu was just okay....  It didn't have a whole lot of taste to it, but the noodles underneath it were DELICIOUS....\n\nThis place was definitely a good find.  The women working their are nice, and efficient!!!  She realized they had put my tofu over rice instead of the noodles before she even handed it to me and within only 2 minutes, problem remedied!!!\n\nI look forward to trying a few more things they have to offer, and hopefully they can throw some tofu in their chicken noodle soup instead of chicken.

This place has questioned some of my beliefs. i remember walking in to this literally \"hole in the wall restaurant\" and thinking to myself it looks like cheap Chinese food in a barely able to fit 8 people capacity room and it'll be alright. Oh man was I incredibly wrong. It can actually fit about 14 people .  is cash only so make sure just like in all of the Mission to bring cash. This place wins 5 stars because not only is it cheap but the quality of food and the experience you get outweigh the other negatives such as waiting in a small line, barely fitting yourself into a seat, and the women yelling at each other in Cantonese (which I believe is not a negative).

The place is run by a handful of kitchen-aunties who seem to work with amazing precision in the tightest most cramped kitchen I have seen in this country.\n\nOne visit I had the pleasure to sit at the end of the bar next to a 300+ pound black transvestite wearing zebra skin patterns, and a fake namedropping artist / producer who uncomfortably avoided direct questions. On a more recent visit, I sat next to a quiet baby momma type woman who after finishing most of her chicken noodles, pulled what seemed like a premeditated  dine and dash.\n\nAs for the food, Its delicious but greasy. I figured this out after eating at Yamo for five days in a row. \nThe food is Chinese - Burmese. Note that many Asian restaurants including Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, just to name a few., are commonly run by ethnic Chinese. These countries have historically had ethnic Chinese populations. These cuisines were hybridized a long time ago, and are authentic traditions in their own right.\n\nSometimes the best bet is calling ahead for take out so you don't have to play Russian roulette in terms of getting one of the 10 seats. The only downside to this is their use of wasteful plastic food containers.\n\nI have tried and can honestly recommend every dish on their menu. The samosas are little deep fried curry-filled turnovers. They are delicious but a little redundant if you order another curry based dish. The pot-stickers are fried just right and have a delightfully aromatic ginger finish. For the grease-shy, I  would recommend using restraint in ordering  either of the above fried appetizers along side an already greasy entree such as any of the noodle dishes. The Spring rolls are very light and refreshing and then there is the tea leaf salad which I would suggest ordering  as an appetizer to be split between more than one person (as opposed to a main dish) as it is quite high in sodium.", "author": "Joshua D."}

You are my favorite bargain eatery.\n\nIf you're into discovering a hole-in-the-wall place with a bit of grit then Yamo is the place to be. The real action is behind the counter, where three middle aged Burmese women scurry about--taking phone orders, chopping up salads, spooning heaps of spices onto colorful plates, working the 6-burner stove, and every once in a while, pausing from their frenetic activity to fulfill a customer's request. \n\nAfter taking our appetizer order on a small deli style-notepad, our \"waitress\" abruptly crooned \"number 1\"; and, waddling away from us, grabbed some cabbage out of the fridge, delivered said cabbage to the stove chef, and then calmly returned to finish taking our entr\u00e9e order. \n\nAfter the spring rolls (which I felt could've used a bit more edginess) came my friend Eirene's House Noodles, which were fantastic. The pork was tenderized and well spiced, while the soupy noodles were flavorful and perfectly cooked. When my shrimp curry entr\u00e9e arrived, a few minutes later, Eirene took the opportunity to remind the ladies that we were still waiting on our other appetizer, the tea leaf salad. \"Oh right!\" was the response followed by a falsetto three-part harmony chorus of \"Tea Leaf Salad\"! Seconds later, it seemed, the salad was in front of us. Served cold, it bombards you with an array of flavors, textures and spices. It is truly a hearty salad, with nuts, beans, shrimp, cabbage, tomato, and sesame seeds. Simply put, it is deliciousness--not to be missed. \n\nOh, but did I neglect to describe the shrimp curry? Its got a mountain of red and green pepper jewels, whole shrimps and mushrooms, all smothered in a savory curried sauce. Served with your choice of noodles or rice, this dish is excellent.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!  The price is so good, that adds a half star right there, pushing the average up and making this place an easy 4 stars.\n\nSo with that said, Yay!  I'm a fan!", "author": "Tetsu N."}

You have to check your order though, since this place gets busy and sometimes they don't remember everything you ordered.

Even though we came at 6:30pm, the place was empty and we got counter seats.  Good timing too, because all the seats were taken 10 minutes after we sat down.\n\nWe split the tea leaf salad and the mango chicken.  The tea leaf salad was really good- I'm especially glad that the dried shrimp wasn't too obvious, as the sight of them creeps me out.  Tea flavor was balanced and not overpowering.  Unlike Burma Superstar, this wasn't mixed tableside, but I wasn't paying for that level of service.  Also, the mango chicken was really good.  I had been skeptical by the preponderance of green pepper (which usually kills the dish for me) but this blended in surprisingly nicely with the mango.  It would have been awesome if they had brown rice, but white rice did the trick.\n\nService was really quick.  We were in a rush but we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering\n\nPlus the meal was dirt-cheap.

The curry chicken noodles were pretty good.  It's true that they don't give you much curry sauce if you order this to go, but if you put what sauce they do give you into a bowl/container with the noodles and give them a thorough tossing, I found that it was just enough curry sauce to give the noodles a light coating.  The mushroom tofu had lots of veggies in it, but was only decent.  All in all, Yamo is not bad and I'd definately come back.  \n\nI love tea salad!", "author": "Olivia C."}

I love noodles and they had a good variety of dishes. \n\nWe had spring rolls, the chicken noodle soup, and the Yamo house noodle with pork. The spring rolls were nice and fresh, I saw the lady make them in front of me! And the chicken noodle soup was good, curry-ish. The Yamo house noodles were bomb. The noodles themselves are just so yummy. They are chewy and fresh and not heavy. The dish was a dry noodle with garlic, green onions, and pork- simple but definitely tasty. \n\nThe place is TINY. We went on a Wednesday night so there was virtually no wait, even though every seat was filled when we got there.

Yamo is literally a hole-in-the-wall--I love it!  It's small place that can fit about 12 people at their countertop and bar stools. The wait is long when crowded..and when it's not so crowded.  It takes forever to get a dish! There's 1 cook and 1 to 2 women preparing and taking orders.  I suggest ordering take out...they'll say it takes 10-20 minutes, but it's more like 30 or 40 minutes...depending on how much stuff you order and how many people are waiting for their food.\n\nI usually order the house special noodles with pork, chicken curry, and the tea salad (with lots of garlic)..those are my favs.  I've ordered the fish dishes before and didn't like the cheap tilapia.

I liked the tea leaf salad quite a bit, but it wasn't the best I'd ever had.  (Good spice and crunch to it.)  The chicken noodle \"soup\" was also very good, but I'd hesitate to call it soup.  It was more like chicken and noodles in a thick sauce.\n\nEveryone here is raving about the garlic noodles, but I honestly had to take away stars for it. Greasy and bland sums it up.  There are better things on the menu.  (like the coconut drink which I loved).\n\nThe restaurant just feels dirty - result of being so small and so much grease floating around.

It might be because of the nice young gentleman hanging out at the corner telling me how to identify my ethnic background in Spanish, but who knows.  He was a such a charming fellow-- so charming that I didn't want to correct him.  \"Chino!\" he yelled.  I wanted to tell him, \"yo soy coreano\" but he'd probably give me gift of sputum.  Too generous.\n\nI digress once more.\n\nI went with my wife and a coworker from work.  We ordered the samosas which were pretty good, but needed more texture.  The pot stickers were really good, and we'd definitely give it a go the next time around.  The skin was thick an chewy and the ingrediants inside tasted fresh.  The tea salad was a bit too salty for my palate, but maybe it's because I am a whiny hypocondriac trying to avoid symptoms of a class 1 NYHA heart failure patient.  Nevertheless, it's pretty well prepared.\n\nAs the wonderful ladies prepared our meals, my mind started to drift into a euphoria as I saw the care they gave the food.  Or, maybe it was the trace amounts of recycled oil marinating my brain.  Regardless, it was pretty cool.\n\nThe house noodles were great!  Chewy, full of flavor, but again, too salty for my taste.  My wife and friend both ordered the fish chowder. My wife let me have some of her's and it was pretty tasty.  I am not too familiar with the cuisine of Burma, (recuerda?  yo soy coreano! --but more like a banana)  I'd describe it as vermicelli/pho noodles in a  corn starch thickened soup with hints of curry and bits of fish.  Not one of my favorites at the time, but it'd be much better if I was super cold and hungry.  \nAnyhoo--we'll definitely order out the next time.  The oil still lingers in my limbic system.

One of the chefs counted carefully to make sure there were 6 perfect isosceles triangles on our plate before delivering.  There was some discussion about going easy, maybe saving a few for lunch tomorrow.  The idea of a \"to go\" box was tossed around.  They'd probably re-heat well, we surmised.  It became apparent, however, that 0 of the 6 sumosas were going to make it past round two.  Yeah, they probably wouldn't have reheated well.  \n\nDish two, the Yamo house noodles with pork, was EXACTLY as tasty as it looked (it looked very tasty).  Greasy egg noodles, tender well-seasoned pork, and a bit of cilantro.\n\nYamo is one of those places that I can already feel myself starting to crave as I walk out the door.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

Nothing fancy or hip about it, it's simply a dive restaurant with good food, not amazing, but good.  For me, the experience of watching the group of women go about their business of cooking was great and the tab made it even better. They don't really interact with you, they just get the job done and work their asses off.  Yamo is very tiny, around 7-8 seats and has complementary hooks to hang your coat on the wall, behind your barstool -I like unique touches like that! \n\nThis place has lots of character.  If you want super cheap and OK-good Burmese, but not the best, this is the place.  \n\nWait time for a seat was aprox 20-30min.  I will probably do take out next time.\n \nWhat we ordered:\n\n1-The tea salad was tangy, sweet, and crunchy with a kick of amazing mix of flavors. It was yummy!\n\n2-The mango chicken was just OK, nothing amazing but not horrible. It was a bit bland for me and lacked flavor.\n\n3-The house noodles were the best of what was ordered. Perfectly cooked, nice balanced flavor and the chicken added was also yummy!  Note: when you order house noodles with meat and want veggies make sure you specifically request with veggies because they don't add unless requested- I need to remember that for next time.\n\n4- Total tab= $19.85  \n\n*CASH ONLY*", "author": "Angelica F."}

Had some good convos with them\n\nThe second owners (Yamo Be There) were, I think, inexperienced because they spent too much effort on the look of the place and not on the food.  It was pretty bad.  Cold and bland.\n\nThis current Yamo is good, but I've had better.  I'm a little suspicious of the clear seasoning liquid they use, as I'm really sensitive to MSG (headaches) and beef broth (can't digest).  I've had some of their saucy dishes that left me with stomach cramps and headaches.  I've asked if they used either in my dishes, but they said no.  So, I don't know what it could be.  So now I stick to the fresh spring rolls w/tofu as a pre-dance-class snack - altho they're big enough to be a light lunch.  The ladies are nice and the food does taste good.

The deduction in star is a reflection of a more general view of Yamo's menu; having been a devotee of their tea leaf salad, noodle soups and Yamo House Noodles, I've discovered I'm not entirely enamored with anything else. I came by with my parents to introduce them to a more pure Mission dining experience and experimented with the beef curry, the mango chicken and... it was okay.\nWhat? Only okay? I know, I have to be fair though and yes, I felt that past my exclaimed favorites mentioned in my first review, the rest of the menu is a bit lacking. I would generously approve of their fish chowder noodle soup and possibly their pot stickers but... beyond this, I'm not entirely sure.\nStill, it hardly warrants a large deduction; but, with Yamo's increasing popularity seating at their infamous tiny food bar has become near impossible and as such, weighs further on the negative scale with a full star deduction.\nI still really enjoy Yamo, and I still laud it's accomplishments to any who will listen, but have to be fair and numb a bit of the excitement and state the simple fact: if you have a Burmese-Chinese craving, order out.

Don't go to this place if you have OCD or freak out about uncleanliness. This is your typical real chinese food joint which is just a step above a street vendor. Try the tea leaf salad and any of the noodle dishes.", "author": "Ron T."}

I had no clue where the exact location of the place was until last night. The place is tiny, and i am serious, tiny. It fits about 8 people or less. The menu was small but cheap, i was shocked that they had spring/summer rolls(whatever you wanna call it). At first i wanted fried rice but ended up ordering the Yamo house noodles. The noodles were actually good, it looked like it was a tiny serving but it actually filled me up. I ordered the spring roll and saved it for a late night snack. The lil old lady was pretty nice and quick when she took my order. I took my fpod home cause the place was already full, i would def come back and try something else on the menu.", "author": "Lucky M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-23", "description": "The Place:\nI had a bit of trouble finding the place. When I first saw it, I thought the restaurant was condemned and closed for business. The entire place consisted of a room about half the size of a classroom with a bar in the middle. On one side there's eight seats (good luck number for Chinese people), and on the other side there are the elderly chefs. They don't spend any money on making the place fancy. I went on a Monday at around 5:00, and all the seats were filled (but like I said, there aren't many seats).\n\nThe Service:\nI went for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded. One lady took my order, and she conversed with us in Burmese. Unfortunately speaking in Mandarin (no, it's NOT Cantonese) or Burmese does not get bigger portions or special treatment. Darn. The food was quick, though not much attention was paid towards the customers.\n\nThe Food:\nI don't consider Yamo's food real Burmese food, but then again I don't think Burma Superstar's food is real Burmese food. Yamo's food is cheap and is geared towards an American audience. It's very cheap ($3.50 for appetizers and $5.25 for entrees), but the food is nothing special. Portions could be bigger. Their samusas were very small, the type you can find frozen at Ranch 99 or Pacific Super. The Yamo House Noodles (or garlic noodles, as I know them to be called) could have used more flavor. The presentation was lovely, but the taste was lacking. The mango chicken wasn't anything special either. It's on about the same level as Panda Express. I was a bit disappointed with the food and the limited selection, but I figure the chefs are friends from temple who decided to go into a little business together.\n\nAll in All:\nI didn't have very high expectations, but Yamo was decent. It was cheap and pretty good for the price. I don't think it's anything special, but I'm rather biased since I've grown up eating Burmese food. I feel like the only reason the restaurant is popular is because it's cheap and it's different. If you don't know what real Burmese food is supposed to taste like, I think you'd like Yamo. It's not bad, but not authentic or flavorful enough for my taste.", "author": "Jessica M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-12", "description": "Well, the three hundred and eleven Yelp reviews turn out to not be wrong.\n\nAfter the first attempt was curbed by what seems to have been a random unscheduled closing we decided to give it another go but this time with a call ahead. A women promptly picked up the phone and yelled \"yamo\" at me, I said, \"how late are you open?\". She replied, \"9:30\" and hung up. We got on some bikes and road down to the mission with a 5 dollar bottle of sparkling Spanish wine from TJs, a corkscrew, and a couple yellow laminated paper cups: this blog might be recent (and sporadic) but I have been BYOBing all over this state for many years and I think self-service is always a good call. We got there in 7 minutes and secured the bikes to a locked gate of the adjacent storefront. I think this is the way to go in this hood, on this rather dark un-traficked stretch of 18th. There appears to be a pretty constant cluster of people waiting outside to sit down or pick up food, having the bike as close as possible to the entrance makes sense.\n\nFrom the street Yamo is basically invisible, perhaps 8 feet of storefront with no signage. (There is a blank white panel where there should be a sign which makes a very effective signifier (in this case, Yamo is the \"signified\"); absolutely appropriate for a place that will probably be full via word-of-mouth no matter what they put out front.) We waited for about 15 minutes and popped the Lambrusco Dell'Emilia Bianco (see picture) it was pretty sweet but nice and bubbly, just fine for a paper cup and a concrete ledge.\n\nOnce inside we sat down mid bar and enjoyed the atmosphere. Yamo reminds me of Taipei in a major way, grimy and tiny with grumpy people yelling behind the counter. There was a giant sign on the wall saying \"no outside alcohol\", but that is where the opaque cups and the oversized shoulder bag come in handy. We had no problem with the under-counter fill ups. There was no pressure to order, which I thought was impressive for a tiny place with a line out front.\n\nWe ordered :\nFermented Tea Leaf Salad : It was phenomenally bright and tart. The cabbage was crispy and the nuts provided a fatty crunch that balanced the generous use of acids (lemon juice & rice vinegar?). I know that I will order this every time no matter what.\nFish Chowder: Had a definite curry undertone and a lovely, sort of powdery broth. There were little crispy bits in there too. I wouldn't miss this one either.\nHouse Noodle, Chicken: So awesomely greasy with what I consider to to be the perfect asian noodle texture, sort of al-dente but totally slippery. I was a bigger fan of this than my partner in crime was. She preferred the soup.\n\nThe wine was actually a great, light compliment to the spicy/greasy-ness, we finished the bottle and felt great. The entire affair cost less than 30 bucks!\n\nRead yelp for more on the food, or just go with your paper cups in the bag.\n\nATH\n\n\nAnd, as a final thought: what is the deal with people complaining about staff at restaurants not smiling? I don't go into a place, especially a place like Yamo, looking for a new friend. The service here is efficient and aware. Our waters were refilled and when we left without drinking our jelly juice the lady behind the counter insisted we not forget a straw. When people are working they don't generally smile. To withhold an additional Yelp star because a two person restaurant staff, that is accomplishing all tasks involved in serving, prepping, and cleaning, doesn't \"Denny's\" it up for you shows a lack of sophistication and empathy.", "author": "Aaron Taylor H."}

I highly recommend doing it once in your life if you can since watching the ladies behind the counter cook is dinner theatre in itself. I love the swinging overhead lamp and rustic walls sweaty with spice, ah if grease and plaster could talk. Anyways, if you are in a hurry just get carry out. The tea leaf salad is good along with the spring rolls and peanut sauce. I LOVE their chicken curry soup, soo good. Some people might question the cleanliness but I have NEVER seen someone handle food and then money (or vice versa). The lady who handles money only serves water and soda and may ladle some soup into a bowl. She NEVER directly touches the food! LOVE this place and it is really cheap too!", "author": "julie q."}

It's the one reason I get excited to find a Burmese restaurant.  You won't find a taste sensation like it anywhere... if they make it right.\n\nSo how is the Let Phet?  Pretty dang good.  Like many Burmese restaurants, they skimp on the tea leaves which really bums me out... probably because the bitter, sour, tang turns off a lot of people and maybe restaurants get tired of seeing it go to waste.  Short of the shorting of tea leaves it just might be perfect.  Yamo's version is a little spicier than most I've had but I really loved that.  \n\nEverything else:\n. Environment: small, just counter space.  Sometimes a little smoky from the cooking.\n. Prices: great.\n. Food: I've only tried 3 dishes so far.  All were simple, tasty, and, best of all, cooked right in front of you.\n. Negatives:  I'd like to see more drink variety.\n\nSummary: Great, cheap, honest eats.", "author": "Mark S."}

I figured I'd asked the young helper what was up since she probably spoke better english, and she said (in broken english)... \"Wait on vegetable's\".  We didn't mind the wait since it was a nice night out and we'd had a beer.  We ordered the mango salad, tea salad, and vegetable curry.  We were handed our food and left without checking that it was the right dishes.  We got home and discovered that we got both salads, but we got the vegetable stir fry instead, and she threw in and charged us for spring roles, which we didn't order. the salads were tasty, but they kind of made my stomach hurt, and the vegetable stirfry was nasty, fried, watery, oily, yuck.

The beauty of Yelp is that we can all have our own opinions. I read about Yamo on yelp and since I love me some Burmese food I had to check it out, along with two of my foodie friends who have the utmost appreciation for divey-food. We didn't have high expectations but we were hopeful that we'd enjoy it. To be honest I was disappointed. The food was just not that great. The atmosphere, while cozy and quaint in that belly-up to the counter kind of way, was overrun by the heavy scent of deep fried oil air. Yes, I\"m talking stuff-ee.  The price was nice and low but for what we got I'd have been disappointed paying anything more. I really would never go back there. The greasy air spoiled it for me. So for those of you who are bummed about the \"hot on yelp\" ruining your favorite spot, maybe you'll forgive me for not sharing in your Yamo joy. All I can say is, you can have this favorite spot back, all to yourself, because I will not be returning.", "author": "Kelly S."}

We almost walked right by the place - it's a hole in the wall place, meant in the best way possible.  The awning of the place was barely legible but we could roughly make out Yamo on there.  We stepped inside and take a seat at the counter.  Almost everything on the menu (aside from drinks) is priced at $5.25 and $3.50 for appetizers.  One of the ladies behind the counter suggested the Yamo Cold Noodles, so I got that and the GF got the Yamo House Noodles.  We also got an order of the freshly made spring rolls.  I personally love places where you get to see what's going on in the kitchen and in this joint, you definitely have a front row seat.  The spring rolls were tasty, big & fresh!  The noodle dishes were very good too.  The taste of the Yamo House Noodles reminded me of noodles I would make at a Mongolian BBQ place.  My Yamo Cold Noodles had just enough spicy kick to keep you wanting more.  I thought we were done, but ended up ordering some Samusas to go.  The sauce provided definitely had a kick to it!  We thought a yogurt based sauce might go nicer, but they were still quite good.  I'm definitely coming back here though!", "author": "Allan H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-27", "description": "Ok, there's really no good reason why I haven't written a review of this place months ago, as it is currently my favorite restaurant and has held the honor of that distinction longer than most. There is a \"bad reason\", however-a selfish one that I'm a little ashamed of: I'm not sure I want any more people going there! It's so small already, with literally no tables, just a counter with 7 or 8 seats. These seats are often full if you go at prime time; lunch hour or any time after 5 pm, although turn over is usually fast. I've since realized, though that the limited seating of this place is one of the aspects, along with a slight language/culture barrier, and a \"smudginess\" due to the exhaust from the cooking surfaces right behind the counter, that has allowed the prices at this place to remain low, and for it to keep off the mainstream restaurant radar, which is just fine with me. I'll gladly accept backless stools, huff a bit of grease-fire smoke, and sometimes wonder at momentarily non existent service (the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars), for truly wonderful and authentic Southeast Asian food and an almost transporting genuine asian street food style experience at dirt cheap prices. You go ahead and go to your fancy restaurants where they have actual tables and where you don't sit in the kitchen because I'll be just fine here where the fermented tea leaf salad kicks the frickin pants off the one at Burma Super Star, with it's array of way more exotic and tasty additions, like nuts I've never seen before and do not know the names of. Yes, if you phone in an order for take out, they don't even ask your name but just say, \"thank you, bye\" and hang up, and your order is rarely ever ready when you come to pick it up at the time they tell you, but so what? What are you in such a big hurry for anyways? Take some time to stop and smell the Yamo house noodles, man.

Anyways, naturally, I was still hungry by the time dinner rolled around. Yamo is teeny tiny and has about ten seats. After waiting for a bit, we had the Yamo House Noodles (which were not garlicy enough), vegetarian Spring Rolls (which completely lacked flavor, but that's probably because my best friend thinks she's allergic to shrimp which is what is supposed to be in the Spring Rolls), and the Tea Leaf Salad (which was also a bit bland). The food was filling and reasonably priced, but just not that flavorful. Maybe we didn't order the right things.

Pull up to the bar, that is, if you get there early enough or you don't mind waiting in line so you'll eventually have your chance to experience the environment at its best. Simple menu with excellent prices, tight quarters so you better not mind sitting right next to others, only visuals are watching the 3 women proprietors knowing exactly where to find the particular food or drink item is that they need. We order the House noodles with Chicken but needed to spice it up just a little with some hot sauce. We also had the curry prawns with veggies. It was not very \"currish\" which was ok because sometimes restaurants can use too much curry. We ordered pot stickers that came out steaming hot and needed some cooling time so we could eat it but we were a little impatient.  The people next to us got the Coconut chicken noodle soup and it looked/smelt wonderful! We'll be back....but very early to make sure we get seated right away!", "author": "P G."}
