Definitely not worth the money. The home fries were so soggy that they may as well have been mashed potatoes.  The crepe itself was a joke. There's really no other way to put it. The crepe had the texture of a tortilla. It felt like I was handed a tortilla that was folded with some mushrooms scattered inside. Crepes are usually filled with different ingredients on the inside. This crepe was nearly empty. The baby pieces of soggy potatoes were thicker than the crepe. And the marinara sauce on top of the crepe was like a runny, bland tomato soup. \n\nService was great. That is their only saving grace, in my opinion. \n\nNot worth the money and sadly, I don't plan to come back.", "author": "Florence S."}

I've been to several SMALL restaurants. but this one is super small if my stroller can BARELY get thru the tables. Isn't that some kind of hazard? If my stroller was barely making it how can a wheelchair????? My stroller has the ability to sit up 90 degrees. Usually if a chair is removed at the table, we just slide our stroller in and my son can sit in his stroller . Here, the tables are soooo close together that the back of my stroller is already at the next table. Therefore, the waitress asked me to \"leave my stroller OUTSIDE\" when they needed that table. Are you fuckin kidding me. My stroller isn't a cheap stroller so absolutely NOT am I leaving it outside. Of course, I was offended she asked me to do\nthis. So, we got up and left before ordering. I was clearly upset, weaving through the fuckin tables, again barely making it, and didn't even get an apology.

I love the simplicity of the menu, non of that hipster menu stuff that ruins a simple bacon, toast with eggs breakfast like other locations (Manor Caf\u00e9) has at West Portal. Their Denver omelet isn't too bad either however when I want something more light I just stick to their Rain Tree Special #2.\n\nIt can get crowded if you arrive after 10:30 on weekends and sometimes you may even have to wait. It can get pretty hectic since the place isn't very big. The two waitresses that have been there the last few months are always on their toes while dealing with large parties or screaming kids who makes a big mess. The service can be a bit slow because of that, however once they get your order the food comes out pretty quickly and then there's the wait for your check again. \n\nThere's a little bench you can sit inside of the caf\u00e9 however you're sitting RIGHT NEXT to customers who are dining. So for either you're waiting for an empty table or whether you're trying to enjoy your meal, it is not very comfortable to be in that close of a vicinity of you while you're eating.

The menu offers a little something for everyone, service is fast and friendly, the portions are large with fresh ingredients, and everything is relatively affordable. Interactions between staff like Regina and customers reflect the neighborhood feel of the cafe with many of the conversations sounding like old friends catching up. I'm also impressed by how accommodating the staff are to special requests, changes, omissions, and additions to the basic menu. The environment is simple, clean, and comfortably worn. The food can be somewhat under seasoned which allows the diner to adjust accordingly so not really a complaint. I do have one very small complaint which is, for some odd reason, the ketchup bottles I have touched have been sticky but that most certainly will not keep me from coming back for a meal or two every week which is always very tasty!", "author": "Thatwasme T."}

This place is strikingly average for a breakfast place...\n\nMy Greek omelette featured tomatoes, feta cheese, and artichoke hearts. It was served with home fries and a side of toast. The plate was huge! The omelette was really good, perfect balance of creamy from the cheese and tang from the marinated artichoke hearts. However, my home fries were mushy/soggy...a real downer. I ended up taking this home as leftovers and refried them the next day...it was much better then.\n\nMy mom opted for the Monte Carlo. The French toast was soggy...possibly from the juice released from the ham? The cheese was also congealed by the time it came to the table. The jam that was brought over? It was in a container that definitely looked like it had it shared multiple times over, the spoon inside looked so gross - it was littered with toast crumbs. Mom opted to not use it, but said that having no jam on the Monte Carlo really ruined the experience. Her order came with a side of salad which came with wilted pieces of lettuce drowning in dressing.

We figured mistakes happen and we finished our meal and left. \n\nLast weekend we returned for, what we were hoping, to be a quick, easy, redemption breakfast... After sitting without even being acknowledged for over ten minutes we were finally greeted. We quickly ordered our very simple breakfasts... And then we waited... And waited... After over 20 minutes the waitress (the same one who had blatantly forgotten my waffle the previous time) returns and says \"sorry I just put your order in\". We got up and left.

We're spoiled here.  District 7's got a whole lotta good brunch spots.  Until recently, we had 5 solid breakfast/brunch places (add Fresca's brunch during the weekends).  But since the unfortunate fire of Squat and Gobble a few weeks ago and Cafe for All Season's loss of their lease, us poor West Portalians are faced with the challenge to choose between Manor Coffee, Village Grill, and Cafe Rain Tree.  (Oh, gosh, whatvever shall we do?!?!) I had gone to Manor twice in one week, and Village Grill the day prior so Cafe Rain Tree was a nice refreshing change.  \n\nIt was a Sunday morning, and Rain Tree was also the least packed amongst the remaining West Portal breakfast spots.  We had come in literally right before the rush occurred.  And what from what I saw, there were two waitresses hustlin'.  As mentioned in prior reviews, I've had a handful of years devoted within the hospitality industry.  Within the ins and outs... from back of the house prep to front of the house bartending, I've done it all- So I respect a good tag-team of waitresses running the floor like a sweet dance.  These girls both did it with an understandably forced smile but not with any impatience nor irritation at the heavy flow of customers entering the restaurant.  Hands down, I respect it.\n\nThe coffee took awhile, but I kept note of how busy they were.  I only had to ask them once after ordering food for our coffee-  I ordered the Raintree special and opted for the french toast with bacon, while my guy ordered banana pancakes  with sausage.  My order came in perfect, however came out as blueberry pancakes.  No biggie for us, I just gave him one of my french toasts while he waited for the right pancakes, which came out in no less than 10 minutes\n\nPerhaps this review is biased, but again, I favor those establishments that are run like a well oiled machine.  In my book, these girls earn that 20% tip hustle and while the food is mediocre in comparison to the other brunch head honchos out in West Portal, I will still find myself here on occasion should Manor be closed, Village Grill be packed or if Squat and Gobble is still burned down.  \n\nxoxo ladies! \n\nP.S.- Perhaps if they had a cashier to do the reciepts, it would be smoother?  I saw an older gentlemen, which I believe to be the owner around the floor helping around (He dropped off the correct pancakes to us)", "author": "Cat A."}

We sat down, and it would be nice if a server came up to our table in less than 2 minutes to at least get us drinks (we like to drink coffee while we figure out what to eat) but I know that doesn't happen sometimes. But another couple walked in and sat down next to us and one server walked right past our table to this couple and took their order(really?)..we were patient and just waited. That same server walked past us with the other couple's drinks and as she was walking by, we tell her that we have been waiting and were there before this couple she is now serving and she says in broken english, \"they will come take your order\"...umm ok. So we wait a little more and ANOTHER female server is walking toward this same couple to ask if they're ready to order and the man tells her they have already ordered and she just says OK and walks back WITHOUT even acknowledging my table to at least say \"I will be right with you\"..I was so irritated with the lack of customer service that I lost my appetite and did not want to order. If it were just me, I would have gotten up and went back to TOAST but when a man is hungry, he doesn't care about whats going on and just wants his food smh. He was paying anyway so whatever lol..I decided to go to Starbucks and grab my coffee before I say something not so nice to those servers.

Tonight I went for an easy, cheap dinner, and ended up having the best burger I can remember. I was floored! I ordered with bacon, avocado, and jack cheese, and every part of it was perfect- the burger had that delicious charbroiled taste and was done just right, that smoky savory flavor on the outside, but still tender and wonderful on the inside- the cheese was perfectly gooey, the avocados light, fresh and delicious. The french fries were crispy golden and perfect. The chocolate milkshake I had with it (because why not!) was thick, and clearly made with real ice cream and milk, none of that chocolate syrup BS, served in a old-timey malt-shop glass, lovingly topped with whipped cream and a little chocolate powder.\n\nI am a girl that really likes her burgers.

Unfortunately, an old-school diner I'd been to about a year ago on this block, has changed hands and is now part of a chain.  I wound up going here because it looked the part, and there was no wait to get in at 11am on a rather brisk Sunday when I wasn't keen on waiting outdoors.  \n\nFirst, the coffee.  I was't expecting much, but the coffee was definitely burned.  It's a good thing I also asked for water, because I barely managed to make it through one cup of coffee, despite the temptation of free refills.  \n\nFor food, I ordered two eggs over medium, with sausage, home fries, and whole wheat toast.  It came out reasonably quickly.  First, I tried the home fries.  They were nothing but completely unseasoned small red potatoes.  No salt, no pepper, no onions, no bell peppers, no garlic, or anything else that typically makes home fries great.  Just unseasoned potatoes straight off the flat grill.  The eggs were cooked just as ordered, but were also pretty flavorless.  The sausage was the only part of the meal that lived up to expectations.  The whole wheat toast tasted more closely resembled a mild sourdough that just happened to be brown.   If I had one word to characterize the meal, it would be \"bland.\"  My only saving grace was that the table setting included salt, pepper, and Tapatio.

We should have also known when walking upon here how empty it was on a night where people should be enjoying a hot meal in the city. However, we were a bit pressed for time and had to get a quick bite for our daughter before she had to get ready for bed at a nearby inn we were staying at. The restaurant gods sure did punish us by allowing us to experience this excuse for a restaurant.\n\nIf you're coming to West Portal primarily for this establishment, that's pretty sad knowing that you'll have to pay for metered parking as well ($2/hr). The food here is halfway decent if you're hungry, which is a combination of Mexican and American dishes. If you have leftovers, don't bother asking for a container or bag. We didn't end up eating ours since it was utterly gross the day after, which speaks volumes about the ingredients. Breakfast is served all day. I ordered a basic cheeseburger. It was good, but nothing spectacular. I mean, you can't really mess up a hamburger, can you? The fries could have been crispier too. My wife ordered a soup and sandwich combo. However, she wanted a steak sandwich for her combo. The waitress didn't allow her sandwich selection even though it flatly states on the menu that ANY sandwich can be selected for the combo! She only ended up eating half her soup. My daughter had a quesadilla and it was pretty disgusting. The cheese was just mozzarella. I felt they took a mozzarella stick and used a microwave to melt it. The good ones I've tasted and enjoyed use a combination of different cheeses. On top of this travesty of a dish, the tortilla chips that were served were stale and tasted like something that came out of a bag produced in the 90's. Needless to say, my daughter went to bed hungry that night.\n\nIn regards to the ambiance and amenities, I was aghast at how poorly the place is maintained. I give this place a month or two before the city shuts it down for nastiness. The tables were sticky and the place smelled like deep fried oil. The bathroom (unisex) was even nastier. The floor was saturated with urine and there was no toilet paper. I understand the place is going to close within the hour, but there are still customers inside the establishment.

Lot of rushing around, maybe because they were a bit understaffed?  I wanted a coffee refill and had some trouble getting the waitresses attention and when I did, they hurriedly filled my cup with the decaf pot that was in their hand, rather than asking what kind of coffee I was drinking (it wasn't decaf)\n 4. Finally, the guy next to me ordered hash browns and when the order came they gave him home fries.  When he pointed out that he ordered hash browns the waitress said, \"this is the only kind of potatoes we have\".

I was sure it was the burrito, which I had ordered again, because it was the only thing I had to eat all day. \n\nI also noticed that the employees will handle the bill/cash and go make the food without washing their hands. If it was up to me, I'd close the place down for good!  I should have realized that both times I went, there were only a few customers. It makes sense now. \n\nThis isn't the first time I've had Mexican food, so it's not like I am unable to tolerate it.  \n\nI can only confirm all the negative reviews posted for this place. If you really feel like vomiting and suffering, I suggest you go to this place.\n\nIf I was dying of starvation, with no money, and this was the only place open offering free food, I still would NOT go here. STAY AWAY!!! This place should be closed down!", "author": "mah o."}

We thought about heading to Village Grill. Instead, we had brunch at Cafe Rain Tree. \n\nFairly clean and simple place with oil paintings on the walls. The service was pretty warm and friendly and the menu looks more like it fits a breakfast place more than a lunch and dinner. For lunch and dinner, looks like you won't go far beyond sandwiches and burgers, so don't expect steak or rotisserie chicken.\n\nI ordered the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend got the Popeye Omelet. I might not be fair to compare the Corned Beef Hash with Boulevard Cafe's, but it's necessary to contrast the portions. The Corned Beef is a third of what Boulevard would give. It's that small and if you haven't tried Boulevard's Corned Beef, I'll just say that they are generous with the meat! Well, moving on...my plate came with two eggs, two slices of bread and potatoes. The eggs were ordered over-easy and it looked fine, bread is bread...and the  potatoes were chunky. Potatoes were bland, but a little ketchup would fix it up some. The Corned Beef was fine. Not too salty, not too tasteless.\n\nOverall, Cafe Rain Tree is passable, but it's nothing compared to other hard-hitter breakfast joints like the Squat and Gobble just down the street.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

Regardless, she's really cool.\n\nProbably the best thing about this place is that you will NEVER have problems getting a table. For some reason, I like that in a place. If they had better food, maybe, it'll be a place where I go to more frequently and not an option only when Squat and Gobble is crowded.\n\nI would suggest this place only if everywhere else you like to go in West Portal is crowded... or if you or some friends just want to eat,talk, and  hang out without worrying about a loud restaurant.
