It's Cantonese...and is typical MSG soup.  Yeah, I'm struggling to write more about them.  They were pretty quick and cheap.  Yes, I've experienced better.

This place has two big Chinese characters meaning \"porridge\" and \"noodle\" on the windows - which really assimilates to some authentic Hong Kong local restaurants decorations.\n\nThe menu looks pretty extensive but basically they are just combinations of repeated items over rice, noodle, porridges etc. \n\n#Beef Brisket Wonton Noodle: B++.\nPretty nice. Beef brisket was tender. Noodle was spongy. Soup was classic wonton noodle soup with lots of MSG (which is pretty authentic I guess..) Wonton skin was pretty thin however the only thing I would have wanted for improvement was the size of wonton ingredients - it's definitely on the (very) small side.\n\nOverall, a low cost and quite authentic wonton noodle house.

Me?  I'm a bit in between.  While MSG can provide an irritating tingle in my mouth or on my tongue I've never become sick from consuming it.  Sometimes I enjoy living on the edge, and it's those times when I visit the Won Ton House on Noriega Street.\n\nDon't expect impeccable service here.  It's basically a sit where you want type of place and the waitress will wait until you are properly seated before bringing you a boiling cup of hot tea.  She'll take your order, bring you your food, occasionally glance at you to make sure you're not doing anything mischievous (taking photos of food is the exception) then she'll bring you your check.\n\nLiving on the edge isn't the reason I eat here though.  I eat here because the food is cheap and as much as I hate to admit it I do have some of those cheap-Chinesey genes in me.\n\nLet's take a look at what I've ordered on recent visits:\n\nWon Ton Noodle Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#_o08CiG6XmYhflC8fhnn-w) - The won tons are nice and plump and pretty decent.  The noodles stay firm for the duration of your visit, and they don't get mushy.  The broth is where the MSG is really noticeable.  Don't finish the broth and I'm usually okay.\n\nPotstickers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#0QLakvWbQuiqJmkBpM7jtg) - Sometimes five to an order and sometimes six!  Mixed with the coarsely ground pork is a bit of cabbage and sometimes a bit of ginger.  It's not bad and the MSG is minimal.\n\nStewed Beef Brisket Noodle Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#kGkSDCM8wN7sEWGeDcTf3g) - The beef is usually tender and the tendons are properly chewy.  Like the won ton noodle soup the MSG is in its broth.  You'll know what to do.\n\nRoast Duck & BBQ Pork over Noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/won-ton-house-san-francisco?select=xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug#xa6sEzBFnVtxqz5a0NHwug) - You can have this over rice too, but I'm always going to be a noodles kind of guy.  As with mostly all Chinese BBQ the MSG is in the marinade.  They use the same sturdy noodles on this as they use in their noodle soups.  They pour some of the fatty liquid from the BBQ meats into the noodle to give it some extra oomph and extra MSG.\n\nMake sure you drink a lot of liquids after eating here just to wash away the MSG.  \n\nSo if MSG and low health scores don't bother you so much, and you want hot, cheap food relatively fast this place is A-OK!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Found this gem while looking for restaurants that's still open after ten and this was the place. This place doesn't have enough love for how good it is. Super friendly restaurant and it's very quiet inside since it was late at night. I thought this place wasn't going to be busy considering this a quiet neighborhood. This restaurant is huge which can actually seat up to maybe around 30+ people. The menu is simple but have diff varieties from noodle soups to egg noodles to rice plates. The lady that took our order or everyone's order(guessing she's the owner) super friendly and patient. My friend who doesn't eat pork since she's allergic to it, she had a hard time choosing because the lady said almost everything was made with pork. She nicely recommended what to get without getting all angry because usual Asian ladies have no patience and rush everything(from experience). We ended up getting the Szechuan beef rice plate and the noodles which both came with pork broth which isn't bad but tastes too much like msg so I passed up on that. The portions are huge for the price you pay like where else can you find prices like these now in San Francisco. Two huge plates which we couldn't finish so got it to go for UNDER $20.

The bbq pork was underwhelming, and wasn't very good at all. The wontons were okay, and they were very generous with the amount wontons in my soup. The noodles were super filling, and I wasn't even able to finish half of them! The soup was pretty good. I kept mentioning to my friend how full I was, but somehow still ended up slurping on the soup as we talked.\n\nMy friend ordered the roast duck with wontons, without the noodles (smart choice!). And by the time he finished his meal, he was pretty full, even without the noodles.\n\nWe also shared an order of turnip cakes. They were surprisingly delicious! They were perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. They weren't too oily either, unlike most places that serve turnip cake.\n\nDecent food and generous portions at cheap prices.

At this point, the waitstaff has become familiar to me and is on friendly terms with my family. \n\nFirst impression is that the restaurant is clean and the food is pretty affordable. We definitely have a tendency to come here when it's later at night, as the hours are good and the restaurant is often open during holidays. \n\nWe typically order the won-ton noodle soup with roast duck, the pork and thousand year egg congee and stewed beef brisket over rice. The noodles come in a pretty big portion and they allow you to customize what type of noodles you want (egg noodles, shanghai noodles, fun). The broth is pretty simple and straightforward; pretty much fulfills what you would be looking for from Cantonese style noodle soup. The noodles always come with a good portion of duck with some meaty pieces, but the skin isn't very crisp. The won-tons themselves can be hit or miss. When they are fresh, they taste great, but sometimes you can't be sure. The congee tastes great and doesn't disappoint. My favorite is actually the beef brisket over rice; the flavor of the beef is great. My only qualm with it is that the pieces are often a little fatty, and there isn't a ton of meat. Might have to go with a double order if you want enough beef. \n\nUltimately, the food tastes good and is cheap, but the quality isn't always perfect or predictable, especially when it comes to the won-tons. \n\nFavorites: Beef brisket over rice\nTips: Great late night spot!", "author": "Amanda C."}

I am quite disturbed that you blame the establishment when you don't do your own research. What did you tell your friends that they have before impressing him/her? You tell them they have vegetarian wontons? Hello? Maybe read the menu before walking in? Plenty of places to eat across the street. It's your own damn fault to starve to that stage when poor you had to eat whatever that is in front of you. Also, maybe consider ordering your friend some Chinese broccoli on a bed of noodles? Drop the victim mentality here please. If you friend was pissed, it was not their fault. You don't go to a Chinese restaurant and expect they have Italian food. Make sense? They have rolled ho-fun with plum sauce. I go on vegetarian diet for days sometimes too. I still come for those. \n\nAlso, I don't know where you are from. I grew up in China and this is the closest you can get in SF. Stay home and eat your mom's food next time. You should never compare the two. Or next time, when your mom cannot compete with a restaurant dish, you should bring it to her attention. She will listen I am sure. \n\nI have been coming here for almost a decade.

Living in LA, I forgot how chilly it can get at night. So after arriving in the fog, we decided to go to Wonton House to warm up. \n\nThis is a place I often ate at in the 80's while cutting school. So it was nice to see they still had my favorite dish on the menu: Spicy Beef over (rice or noodles) I chose the latter this time. The price hasn't changed much, if at all since the last time I went there over 10 years ago.  The flavor was just as I remembered it, and it was a huge portion. We also ordered wonton noodle soup, a necessity in Chinese late night comfort food, along with an order of turnip cake.\n\nSo I rate the price a 5 star, because it's so affordable. Rate the food a 3 star as it's good, but not great, the same for the service, not great and not bad... just as it was when I went there decades ago. I'm leaning towards an overall 4 star because it brings me back to my childhood, but that's just my personal feeling. So to be fair here on Yelp, an overall 3 star.\n\nIf you're looking for a great meal experience, maybe not here. The decor has not changed for the past 20+ years, but then again,neither has the price.  But if it's a cold night (or day) and you crave some hot wonton noodles or the like, than hop in and order up. \n\nWorth a visit or a return if you've been already.", "author": "James L."}

My meal was only 6.50$ and it was so filling I had a hard time finishing!\n\nThe place is CASHONLY just like most of the Asian restaurants in the area are, but it is conveniently a block away from a BoA and a Chase.

We yelped places near the area but unfortunately nothing was open. We then gazed across the street and saw this little place open. This is perhaps the restaurant's greatest asset, that it is open really late until midnight.\nThe food was average at best. My friend had noodle soup and I ordered dumplings. I don't know if it was that my friend was stressed from packing for college, or that her friend was dealing with personal issues, but after eating the extra oily and greasy dumplings, we felt very unhealthy and experienced hypertension. \nOverall, the restaurant had a friendly environment, swift service, and average Chinese food. Good place to eat on a whim, but not if you're looking for the best Chinese food experience on this side of the city.", "author": "Angelo C."}

I mean, cheap in their prices, but other than that, their won-ton is ok. However, when I was eating it, I was chewing and I can't chewing something crunchy 2 times. I thought it was the noodles being hard, but when I was almost done eating, I looked closer into my won-ton soup. Guess what I found..3 tiny dead bugs. There might of been more, but I didn't finish the rest of my noodles and won-ton. That's probably the last time I'm going here. Having dead bugs in my food is really disgusting. There shouldn't be bugs inside the food in the first place and having more than 3, that's gross. So if you want food with bugs, come here.

As usual, you'll get a dirty bathroom and sticky tables, but that's par for the course with Chinese places. What wasn't up to snuff was the food. Portions are tiny for $8 plates/bowls, and you're only going to get so much meat and/or wontons in your order. The noodles are fine, but each dish tastes like it's just been doused in a little oyster sauce and that's it. In my plate of char siu and roast duck noodles, I got about 3 pieces of duck, and two of them were either just fat and skin or a giant bone. The broth that came with it tasted like reheated chicken broth from Costco, which is great on your own when you're cooking, but I expect actual soup from a place like this.

No frills in the decor or the presentation of the food, but really good flavors and extremely well-priced.\n\nWhen you sit down, the auntie lady acting as both server and cook will bring over two mugs of tea. The tea, while brewed in one of those diner-style coffee carafes, is actually quite good - warming on a chilly night and not over-steeped. \n\nSince this is \"Won Ton House,\" I've only ordered won ton noodle soup, which happens to be my #1 comfort food. It's a really simple dish, so the $4.75 price is fitting. You get a heap of egg noodles, about five wontons with shrimp and pork inside, and broth. No veggies, no meat - though maybe the other options on the menu include them... I'll have to check next time.\n\nThe won tons are very good and are full of meat. Every won ton seemed to have at least one shrimp in it. The broth (chicken-based) is light, but flavorful and I didn't really detect any MSG. That is, I didn't feel super thirsty after finishing my bowl, but I'm not really a stickler for MSG to begin with. Most Chinese restaurants use it, so it's not a big deal to me.\n\nDuring our first visit, the bf's sister got a noodle dish topped with char siu bbq pork. There was an incredible amount of pork; I was actually thinking about getting this to-go. :p Our second visit, the bf got the spicy Szechuan noodle soup. The noodles looked good and the chunks of beef were lean. I wish they were a *little* more tender than they were, but I'm thinking that this dish might not be a specialty of theirs so personally, I wouldn't pick it. Bf said that the broth was good though.\n\nThe best part of our meals here has been the turnip cake or \"law back gow\". SO GOOD. It's pan-fried so each piece is crispy on the outside, but once you bite into it, it's incredibly soft and pillowy and so smooth. You must order this no matter what.\n\nDinner for two was about $8 before tip and we left (for dessert at Golden Island) full and happy.", "author": "Steph S."}

I ordered wonton noodles and my sister got the bbq pork noodles. Fast friendly service so it was nice to get in and get out. The soups contained too much MSG. My sister said her pork was super salty. My wontons were ok. This place is ok though if you're out late and in the area but special.", "author": "Julie C."}

I usually get the rice porridge with wontons, and it's DA BOMB. Authentic food and low prices, what's there not to love? If I could change one thing about this place, I guess it would be to increase the amount of wontons you get (not that they're frugal on it or anything, but just as with boba, I believe there is no such thing as 'too much' in one serving). The lady that works there is also really nice, and after you come here a number of times, she knows what you're gonna order. I've never had to wait long for my food here. The absolutely only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that they don't accept credit cards. \n\nAnother thing that I really, really love about this place is that it closes pretty late, so craving wontons at 11pm when everything else is closed? No problem, Won-Ton House is still open!", "author": "Vilde E."}

Not for exotic or interesting food, because frankly, the store's food is pretty normal. The appeal of this place lies not in powerful flavors or diverse palette, but  in their plain wonton noodle soup, their large steamy zongzi, their pig feet rice, and again, their perfect turnip cakes. \n\nWhat I truly come here for is their clean, pure, simple food. Its for when you don't feel the need to get something out-there or extravagantly spiced. You get literally what you get when you order something. No super special sauces, no secret ingredients. Just plain simple food.\n\nWhat I love about this place the most is the atmosphere. Usually the place is never full, with plenty of room to stretch and feel at ease. The high ceilings, the bright lights, the incredibly clean and simplistic style of the restaurant just puts me at ease every time I walk in. The service is a periodic refilling of your tea, just when you need it.\n\nCheap, simple, clean, and relaxing.

They've been here for years, I remember coming here when I was in high school. I usually get the plain wonton with noodles and a red bean drink to go with it.   Their wontons are huge, and i love their soup base.  I have a habit of adding their chili sauce because it gives it the perfect kick.  My friend always orders their potstickers here.  It takes a while for the potstickers to come out, sometimes we finish our wontons and noodles and it comes out.  I think it's pretty good, because it taste fresh and the pan fry it to perfection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-11", "description": "More often than not, a cheap Chinese restaurant is cheap because their dishes are heavy on the carbs and light on the protein. Not at Wonton House! Don't be fooled by their dirt-cheap prices (all their dishes are under $6) - they're very generous with their meat portions!\n\nI came here for dinner to catch up with an ex (AKA former eating partner). We're both food addicts and have a tendency to enable each other's eat-like-there's-no-tomorrow habit. (He even told me that breaking up probably added 10 years back to his life since he will no longer die from obesity!) When it came time to order, we had a hard time narrowing our choices down to 4 dishes because we wanted to try everything (old habits die hard!) Even then our server asked if we could eat all that food. (Well, *we* thought 4 dishes were reasonable for 2 people...) We got:\n\nSZECHUAN SPICY BEEF NOODLE SOUP, #13 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=H7bBbjdubPDOKeD2k5jyng) - we added dumplings to this and were so glad we did! They were little pillows of perfection. The beef was also very tender, not to mention plentiful. The soup wasn't as spicy or flavourful as I would've liked though and the egg noodles got a little soggy later on after soaking in the soup.\n\nBBQ PORK & ROAST DUCK OVER BRAISED NOODLES, #23 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=f52GIBtilK6UoarfF3qlQw) - The noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and lightly dressed with soy sauce. The B.B.Q. pork was passable but I've had way better. The roast duck was really flavourful and tender though.\n\nFISH & LIVER CONGEE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=bBYReYxQuDNTFPakvYlZhg) - so much fish and so much liver! The liver was a little overcooked but still tasted good. The congee base was OK - a little watery though.\n\nCURRY POTSTICKERS, #57 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=tqAc_KHRIHtU9tNwW9IKeg) - LOVED these! They were filled with an ample amount of perfectly seasoned meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/syIHvIqM4ON4FkK_lHcvGA?select=gSCwB1Y0Yg-5SPDFxcfHTg). The curry flavour made dipping sauces unnecessary but it wasn't overpowering. The skin had just the right texture and wasn't too thick. Though they could've been crispier, I liked that they weren't greasy like at a lot of other restaurants.\n\nI was also very impressed with the service - super fast and friendly! My ex went to the bathroom right after we ordered and our food came out before he did! We stayed for a while just chatting after we finished eating but they never rushed us - didn't give us our bill till we asked for it and even kept refilling our teacups :)", "author": "Steph L."}

Noodle texture and quality was 6 out of a perfect Hong Kong 10, however, the real let down which also affected the noodle's taste was the soup which lacked the authentic taste of even an average bowl of wonton noodle in Hong Kong would offer. The soup was borderline tasteless, which also affected the taste of the wontons. The wontons were also on the tasteless side with very little shrimp in it. I didn't finish my order, as a few bites were all I need to rate this restaurant based on their wonton noodles alone, and it certainly didn't sing to me. If ABC Bakery Cafe in CT sets an average standard, Won-Ton-House is way below such standard (1.5 Star).", "author": "Mango M."}

I ordered it to go and when I opened the bag, I was taken aback by the chunks of meat swimming in some tomato looking sauce. I had to chew one piece of *meat* in what seemed like eternity just to ensure I wouldn't choke...if not for the size, but also for the taste of whatever I was eating.. This is the first time I just bagged my food and went out to a corner where I know some homeless frequent and left it for them. Unfortunately, I expect to see it strewn across the street in the morning.\n\nI think most people who rate this place high must factor in the cost. The food is just bleh.

And they are pretty generous with the amount of won ton dumplings you get in an order as well.\n\nThe other night I got the Preserved Egg Porridge (no pork), at $3.95.  It's a steal because it looks like they dump two eggs in there as opposed to one egg like most places.

I loved the beef brisket over rice because it was tasty and the portion was large enough for two meals.  Tonight I had a craving for it, so I hopped in my car and drove up to the restaurant, looking forward to eating large, tasty pieces of beef brisket.  I put in my order To Go and paid the bill.  It usually took a few minutes for my order to be ready, but this time, I barely sat my butt down when the waitress handed me my order (which I thought was a little odd).\n\nWhen I got home, I opened up the plastic takeout container and to much disappointment, there was very little beef brisket.  Instead, rice filled up most of the box.  To make matters worse, the beef brisket was very bland and it wasn't even hot!  The rice was hotter than the meat!  I was so disappointed that I ate up the beef brisket and threw away the rice in the trash.  I was still hungry, but I wasn't about to fill up my stomach with white rice.  I can do that with my own brown rice!  \n\nSorry, Won Ton House.  You used to be my favorite go-to place, but after tonight's experience, I will no longer eat your food.", "author": "C M."}

I've passed by a bunch of times and it's one of the few places that I haven't tried on Noriega.  My first impression...this place is dirt cheap!  Everything is under $7 and the wonton noodle soup is only $3.95. It's also kinda hard to find if you don't know where it is already, because it doesn't really have a sign.  It's located next to the restaurant with the Sun logo on it (I can't read the chinese characters).  I ordered the Wonton noodle soup and the Ngow Jaap (beef organ) a la carte. My friend ordered the Fish Ball Noodle Soup.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't impressed with their wontons.  I've had much better wontons in NY and if you're gonna name your restaurant after wontons, I expect the best.  Their wontons are just ok, although it's not bad for the price.  One thing I didn't like was that I thought there was grains of sand or something in my wonton, but no one on yelp has mentioned it before, so it could have just been a one time thing.  \n\nI did like the beef organ dish.  It's the standard dish you'd get at dim sum, but it's missing the intestines and the daikon.  I don't care for intestines, so I don't mind being without that, but I would have loved some daikon in the dish.  I also don't like spleen, so I put all of that to the side.  Haha, the only organs I like in that dish are the different types of beef tripe....Mmm...Yummy.\n\nMy friend said that his fish ball soup was decent, so I'll take his word for it.  The reason why this place gets 4 stars rather than 3 is because the prices are so cheap.  I didn't order any congee, but I saw that they were all around $4.  That's a pretty good deal, so I know where I'll be going if I need congee.  I'm guessing that it's hard to mess up congee, but I'll update this review if it turns out to be bad.  Another plus is that they're open until midnight every day of the week.", "author": "Tyler C."}

The won tons were really good, pretty plump and full of filling. The pot stickers are my favorite..the pork filling was really tasty, and the skin is good- you can tell the skin is homemade and not the pre-made wrappers. The jook is alright, tho more soupy and not too much rice in it. The ginger chicken was good and the portions were huge! \n\nOverall - this restaurant seems to be a hole-in-the-wall, only not.

Old People, Old Reviews?\n\nWell I'm far from old =). But I'm not as hip to the hop, or \"fresh\" as some of you. But in reality it has been freakin ages since I last ate here. \n\nYou see, 10+ years ago we were all different individuals. Likely some of you were still in elementary school, or just barely pubescent teens, like boys who then just discovered girls and cars and wondered why you were into ninjas, robots, and frogs in the first place. For girls, maybe you were thinking about what to get next at Forever 21 while trying to call into KMEL's hot jam line to dedicate that favorite Toni Braxton, Taylor Dane, Paula Abdul, Shanice (\"Saving Forever For You\" or \"Loving You\" from 9021HO)  or Mariah Carey song to your man boo to show how happy and in the moment you were at the time (but in retrospect should have chosen Lil Kim's \"Eat My P**sy\" instead because your man only wanted to please himself or his car and not you. EDIT: That song is called Not Tonight. Full lyrics here, enjoy: http://www.lyricsdepot.com/lil-kim/not-tonight.html) \n\nMe? I was ashamed that I still clung onto my first ever girlfriend then for 5 years from college.\n\nBack then we didn't have yelp, or people like you to tell us what the latest and the greatest were for entertainment, hot date rendezvous,  where to go for a great dinner, movie, dessert, and then get some uninterrupted romp in the back seat action to steam up the windows of the car (and not make a mess). You see back then it was very simple. For us, maybe start off the day at lunch, SF Japantown, a little walk around the area. Perhaps a movie in the city somewhere, in the afternoon or after dinner. Next would be to grab some dessert, perhaps Golden Island Cafe or if the stomachs were growling, Won Ton House which conveniently closed by midnight on weekends (or was it 1 am) and the only game in town for a quick cheap bite. Yes, how boring, but hey if it ain't broke don't fix it! Repeat the same routine for upwards of 5 years. It gets boring sometimes. Yes this is a cheap Chinese/Cantonese date or routine. There were only so few cool, hip, and accessible spots back in the day for a nice date and evening.\n\nOh yeah going out on dates were not cheap, even if the date is a somewhat significant other. Spend quite a bit here, a little there, and next thing you know it is next weekend. Going out to different places can be tiring indeed. But sometimes the best meal could be the one at the end of the day, where you don't need a lot when you're hungry, but want something hot and satisfying, cheap, and quick. As much as I loved that romp in the backseat at some hidden public location which essentially was the same thing (hot, satisfying, cheap quick), it only made me hungrier afterwards. Won Ton House saved my life frequently during those afterhours, by offering this cheap Cantonese snack won ton noodle in soup. They also have the steam rice crepes (plain cheung fun) which is the same kind they get from the supermarkets (sometimes labeled as banh cuon in Vietnamese), which is a nice light night snack as well. Rice plates are ok, just hit the spot, and ditto with stir fried noodles.\n\nThere aren't many places like this in the South Bay or Peninsula, where a place like this serves a small but sufficient variety of Cantonese comfort foods, simple, cheap, quick, and open late.\nWhile quality is not high by any means, this place gets 3 solid stars for being around so long and just dishing out the goods where they are needed.\n\nP.S.

Open conveniently late for night diners/snackers!\n\nTonight, on my first visit here, I ordered #2 - the Won Ton soup.  Somebody in my party ordered the #1 - the Won Ton Noodle soup.  Both of the prices were the same: $3.95.  The difference ewas that hers came with noodles, cabbage, and about 4 wontons, while mine came with cabbage and about 8 wontons made of shrimp/pork.  I don't know if she had shrimp in hers as well.  Anyways, it was a darn good deal!  \n\nI'm usually not too big on chinese food either, mind you.  Honestly,  tonight I wanted to go for the Roast Duck over Rice but I was skeptical as to whether they would give me slabs of fatty duck; it being on the cheap end of prices, usually resulting in poor quality.  However, upon reviewing my fellow diner's Roast Duck Noodle Soup, the duck pieces were not half bad!  They were decent slabs of meat!  I'll be sure to give that one a try next time. \n\nService is acceptable.  There seemed to be only one waitress or so working the floor - but that was enough.

We always get the same things:  won ton noodle soup for me, roasted duck noodle soup for husband, noodle soup (2) for girls, rolled ho fun with plum sauce (housemade white soft noodles in the sauce with a light amount of white sesame seeds) for all, turnip cake (2 orders - we're all obsessed) and gai lan (Chinese brocolli in light soy/garlic sauce).  If it's the weekend, we sometimes skip the ho fun and go with the fried dough, which is greasy hot deliciousness especially when dipped in the hot soups.  You can dip the turnip cake in the soup, too, or it might accidentally fall into the soup if your chopstick skills are similar to mine-- then you can fish it out.  Red bean drink is delicious.  Hot tea is dangerously hot; I have an s-shaped burn scar on my arm from when I knocked the hot tea onto my arm in the late 90s, so I am much more cautious with those cups.  \n\nService is hilariously indifferent but at the same time they always take our orders immediately, bring the food out promptly, and provide our bill with no comment.  Our meals, paid for with cash, usually cost around $25 and we get so much food it is always impressive.  We're all quite sensitive to MSG and have never noticed its effects post-meal, so we aren't sure it's used in the foods we eat, but the food provides a high that may mask minor sins.  Did I mention the turnip cake?  It is consistently the best one I've ever had, even from high end dim sum restaurants in SF like Yank Sing and lower end dim sum joints in Oakland's Chinatown.

I've recommended to friends and they all love it. A lot of ppl seem to complain about the noodle soup here; they haven't tried spicy beef over rice. I know it's a wonton house, but.. Fact is, their spicy beef is the bomb. The beef is tender and comes in a reasonable portion, and most of all, you can taste that it's not some generic beef stew; you can tell it's homemade from scratch and they sure know what they're making. Mix in their spicy pickled dish they always have on the tables which really goes well with the rice (careful not to have too much! It's a bit spicy so having too much, you might regret the next morning ;) you've been warned). \n\nLast but not least, starting off the meal with the fried turnip cake is a must :) Just like someone else mentioned, it's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

I do admit that the place is fast and inexpensive to eat and for $10-12 you can get a lot of food.  But as someone who has eaten a lot of wontons this place really disappoints.  The soup and wontons were salty.  Too salty in fact to actually enjoy it.  That is if there was anything to enjoy in the wonton.  The filling was bland.  There was really no taste.  Soup?  Was that really soup or just water and soy sauce?  \nComparing the wontons to some restaurants in Oakland's Chinatown or even San Francisco's Chinatown, this place would be last on the list for wontons.  I find it ironic that the Won-Ton-House does not serve killer wontons.  \nThe beef porridge I give it 3 stars.  Yes, I've had better somewhere else.\nMaybe people should be grouped such as those that are 1) cheap and will eat anything, 2) people who are cheap but are willing to pay a little extra for better tasting food, and 3) people that go all out.  It seems that a lot of the people who give this place 5 and 4 stars fall under category 1.  Don't care what it taste like as long as it's cheap.  I guess I'm not that type of person and have grown to actually like good tasting food and am willing to pay a little extra for it.  So there goes my review for this place and will I go back there again?

The curry beef tendon over rice was fair, if you just like to chew on tendon and not really eat anything.  There are ample tables around.  Not the best Chinese food to be had but not the worse either.\nOn a 2nd day, I stopped for take-out. The stewed beef brisket noodle soup was too salty and the beef pieces were dry and tough.  The Szechuan spicy beef over rice was flavorful and not too spicy with cooked pieces of lettuce, a lot of rice but \"where's the beef?\"   The won ton soup was fair.  You get about 5 pieces of chunky won ton.  I do like their won ton noodles which are thin and chewy.  The roast duck won ton was same as above, just a rare few pieces of duck.

The soup portions are pretty small, but they're also under $4, so you could just order two. The rice plates are also consistently good. The pot stickers are a MUST, and I don't know why other reviews haven't mentioned them. Slightly crispy and soft dough surrounds a moist and perfectly seasoned meat filling. You get six delicious dumplings for less than $5. They do run out, which has happened to me twice before =( Still,  I love this place for their no frills affordable menu, cleanliness, and consistence.

It smelled like a fish army had ransacked the restaurant!! Also, tables are meant to be shared with complete strangers when the place gets busy. Ok, so this place is supposedly known for their huge, delicious won tons. Not so. Won tons are of average size, and have shrimp in them too. I don't know of any other traditional Chinese restaurant that puts shrimp in their won tons.  I think they confused their won ton dumplings for Sui Mai. And just when I thought the fish sauce aroma in the air couldn't get any worse, my bowl of won ton broth emanated its suffocating scent into my already suffering nostrils.  My taste buds wholeheartedly agreed with my nostrils, and begged me to stop drinking the fish potion. But I drank up my soup, just as any other self-respecting Chinese person would do.  $4 for a big bowl of won ton soup, but even though a poor college student, I would not go back into this war zone of fish.", "author": "Chow Mein Ninj A."}

When we arrived, I asked for won ton fun and she said that she didn't have anymore fun. I was like huh? You're a won ton house, but no fun? Then she was like I can put ho fun in it instead. Then I was really confused, i was like isn't that what asked for? So by then I just wanted to eat and agreed. So to my surprise when my food came the won ton was in there,but the ho fun noodle wasn't what I expected. It wasn't the plain ho fun, but the thicker one with the dried shrimp and scallions in the it. I like that type of ho fun, but I always eat it with lightly fried with hoi sin sauce.I actually didn't like it too much with that type of noodle. It was still edible, but I prefer the plain ho fun better. The broth was really good. Light ,not greasy at all.  Th won ton was a pretty good sized portion, took at least 2 to 3 bites to finish 1 won ton off  and plenty in the bowl. I didn't finish the ho fun, but I sure finished the won ton. Also had the spicy beef tribe, I thought the beef tribe was cut a little too thick. It came out cold, which was what I did not expect, but I realize now that anytime I order spicy beef tribe anywhere other than during dim sum that it will be cold.

The shrimp in the won ton is not as fresh as it once was (think they use frozen now) and they left the intestines in the shrimp, which I unfortunately had a few crunches of its sandy debris.  However, their preserved egg and pork jook was very good - quite smooth and tasty with lots of eggs and pork and it goes great with Chinese fried donut  (yau jap gwei.) Chinese tamale (joan) was mediocre - Joy Luck in Cupertino has better joan with better flavor ingredients such as the chinese sausage and duck egg.
