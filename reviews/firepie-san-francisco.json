I've never had a pepp pizza topped with arugula, and while it didn't add a ton of flavor it brought a nice fresh complement to the usually heavier pepperoni. \n\nThe veggie pizza had a real nice amount of veggies on it and it's the first time I've had asparagus on a pizza, which was great. They substituted basil instead of arugula for me no problem and everything was fresh and crisp. \n\nBoth pizzas had a nice sharp garlic punch mixed in with the cheese and robust sauce that really brought the whole experience home.

There are certain promises from Firepie: 1) 90-second delicious wood-fired artisan pizza and 2) 15 minute delivery (Average delivery times 12-21 minutes depending on address). All of this verbiage comes on a postcard that comes with the delivery.\n\nFirst of all, I paid $38 for two 10-Inch pizzas, willing to pay for both convenience and quality. I placed the order at 10:35pm and received an email saying my delivery was to arrive at 11:05pm. No biggie--30 minutes is still great considering how long it takes for other pizza places to deliver. Pizza didn't arrive until 11:20pm. I was willing to excuse all of this if the pizza was worth it.\n\nNot even close. The pizzas were undercooked. And not even to a point of preference. The dough just wasn't cooked through (despite being so thin!). The bottom of the pizzas were pale white because it didn't cook long enough. After taking a bite, the pizza was chewy and the cheese was barely melted, making the texture very unsettling. If you take a look at my pictures, you can't even tell the difference between the cheese and the dough. It was that bad. I scraped the cheese off the tip of one slice and the dough was almost translucent because it was so undercooked. It was worse than frozen pizza, same level as gas station pizza. I wish I was exaggerating. \n\nLook, if I paid 5 dollars for each of these pizzas at a 7/11 or something, I wouldn't complain, but damn near $40 for this and I just get upset. I find myself getting upset. I was played for a fool. \n\nFirepie offered me a discount code to get 10 percent off my next order. Really? \n\nI really wanted to like this place. I wanted to love it.

I've read reviews that say the contrary, & all I can surmise is that there are good days & off days like w everything else.\n\nThe 3 cheese was uber flavorful, as simple as it is.  But the pie that topped the trio was the veggie.  Red onion, mushrooms, asparagus, mozzarella & arugula.  A great combination.  The kicker was the asparagus.  It's cut crosswise into very thin coins.  So the flavor accentuates rather than dominates.  It was different & delicious.\n\nThis is good pizza.\n\n4 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

After living in SF for 18 years I have my pizza staples that I go to  when I come back to visit. Through some friends,  I learned of a new pizza spot called firepie.  I took an Uber all the way from downtown to try the new pie and was not disappointed.\n\n1.  Simple-  After a busy day which didn't include lunch, I was starving by the time I got there  so I was relieved to find a very simple menu with 3 choices of pies, I choose the pepperoni.\n\n2.  Speedy-  I had my pizza in less than  5 minutes. Need I say more.\n\n3. Savory-  My favorite part of the firepie was the sauce. A consistent blend of spice and a good  thick texture.  The crust was fantastic. I'm a big fan of imperfection in my  crusts. The crust was a perfect balance of a crispy outer crust with a soft interior.

So I ordered a veggie and a pepperoni. Honestly, they've turned things around.

Just finished our first FP pizzas after driving by for months and saying to each other we should give it a try. Tried each of the pizza offerings on the menu. Walked up and was quoted 2-3 minutes and waited over 10 minutes. Far more than the 90 seconds advertised, but that wouldn't be worth a single star deduction if the pizza was at last average. I should have went to Trader Joe's for frozen pizza and saved $8 per pie. I added pepperoni to the vegetarian increasing the personal sized to $15 (the only size sold) and literally got four small rounds of pepperoni on the entire thing. Crust was undercooked to the point of being so doughy it became unappetizing. Topped veggies were scarce and the requested arugula on the side was placed inside the box next to the pizza so by the time we got home it was somewhere between wilted and cooked. \n\nWe love to support new restaurants (and food trucks) in the city and will always root for success. I'm hoping based on the other solid reviews that we just hit a bad day, but if I had to choose again today for something fast the Pizza Hut self serve at Target would win. \n\nUpdate. Always impressed when the management owner contacts us to try and resolve. The response always says a great deal about a business. Our money was refunded and invited to try again with a discount.

The exchange was made, he left. 4 minutes later, my doorbell rang. I was mildly freaked out, it was late, but I figured it had to be the delivery guy. Yep, there he was at my door again. I had inadvertantly given him the 15% tip plus a 20 spot. It seems the twenty and  one dollar bills are sticky. And when one isn't looking closely, remarkable simliar in appearance! He figured I didn't mean to give him a 110% tip, and was back to return the twenty dollar bill. Wow, wow wow....What super nice kind, upstanding act of true integrity.

Overall experience has been meh until my last visit, but I'll start with the basics. IMO, the pizza is very overpriced for what you get. I can't justify spending $13-$14 on a very small street side pizza. The taste is also very average, and if anything, underwhelming. I keep returning because I was hoping the quality would get better, and because it was so conveniently located, however my last visit was awful. Ordered a pizza on site, and I was given a very burned pizza- not exaggerating here, as I've eaten pizza from here multiple times. I nicely asked the woman in the food truck if I could get a different one because this one was burned, and she essentially blamed me and told me next time I had to \"specify how I wanted it cooked, because lots of people like over cooked pizza.\" ??? Am I supposed to say I don't want burned pizza every time I order? I can handle pizza that's a little too pricey, but terrible customer service too?", "author": "Emily L."}

I love the just enough/not too much size of the crust. I love the location (right off Cesar Chavez on your way home).  I'm all in. I would go more often if my waistline allowed for it.  It is a generous size individual pizza - if you get the delicious arugula salad with the delightful house-made vinaigrette, it is a lighter meal for 2.  If you are starving, you may actually still have trouble finishing one pizza by yourself. \n\nI take issue with the guy who said he felt 'ripped off' for a $15 personal pizza.  You know the price going in.  If it is too high for you, you don't value the elements and effort that contribute to that pizza. And that's fine, but then don't complain about it.  Also, the pepperoni, that is the most expensive of their pizzas, is only $13.  Their veg or 3 cheese are $12 and $11 respectively. \n\nDO it. Try it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "Decent pizza - better than a food court or greasy no-name pizza joint. Unfortunately, the delivery experience is underwhelming. I paid $37 after tax, tip and the delivery charge for two 10\" pizzas, a veggie and a salami. Easy, right? A bit on the expensive side, but it was after 10, so the value proposition was still good enough to justify the premium. They send you a link to a browser app that lets you track the delivery driver for whatever third party startup they use for delivery reminiscent of a ride-sharing app - cool. Arrived under 30 minutes. Great. Then the driver comes up to my door and says, \"Here's your pizza\" and hands me a single, 10\", personal pizza.\n\nNow I feel like a schmuck. The value proposition has deflated - I just paid $37 for a 10\" pizza. The driver calls up the restaurant to sort it out, promising to get me my pizza no matter what. Great. I get another notification on my phone for an order... Ok, looks like they're trying to make it right. However, I never get a tracking notification this time. Wait an hour and a half until midnight - when they close I believe - and never get my salami pizza. No phone call, no refund notification in my email, no pizza, nothing. Zero percent effort at customer service. The only customer service I got was from the driver\u200b, who works for a different company, and that was a lie.\n\nI have a one-strike policy for this sort of nonsense. If they had made good, I probably would never order delivery from them again, but I might stop by the truck if I'm in the neighborhood some time. The way things stand, having been stiffed an entire, already overpriced, pizza, I have to put them on my blacklist. It's too bad, because very few places in the city deliver or even serve that late. If you're\u200b up late and near the truck, I'd say hit them up. Otherwise, take a pass.\n\nUpdate 05/20/17:\n\nI got a message from the dispatcher mere minutes after posting this review. Apparently he had thought they sent back my missing pizza plus a couple of comped ice creams. So I don't know if there was miscommunication or the driver snagged my food, or what. They also comped me this order back, which is great. The dispatcher also wants to comp my next meal, which is a great gesture. I probably won't take them up on it, not because the food isn't good, but just because I'd like to move on.\n\nI upgraded my rating from one star to two and they're off my personal blacklist, at least for food trucks if not for delivery. The service they use is ChowNow. I have to say I definitely have a preference for Eat24 after this. I probably won't order from anyone served by ChowNow in the future; I don't have experience with Caviar yet.\n\nHere's the thing about delivery, for me anyway: I'm a home chef and I've worked in the restaurant industry. I cook a lot. So I don't order delivery casually; when I order delivery it's because I don't have food in the house and it's too late to want to go to a sit-down restaurant or get takeout, not to mention most of those places are closed. We also don't live somewhere particularly dense where you can just walk down the street to the late night taco place set up in the front of a closed tacqueria to serve the bar crowd.\n\nSo if the order gets messed up, I go to bed hungry. Got to get it right.", "author": "Steve S."}

Essentially you will end up holding the pizza like a taco. LAME! The tomato sauce is bland and flavorless.There's a hint of garlic aroma but the flavor isn't present. The cheese and pepperoni are fair. It's hard for the toppings to compliment the pizza when the crust and sauce are lacking in flavor. Lastly the pizza is top with arugula. I found it slightly odd to put cold arugula on top of pizza. It defeat the purpose of having a hot pizza. \n\nThe Arugula and Tomato Salad is pretty great. I loved the cheese and honey vinegarette. The cherry tomatoes were nice and ripe. Every item in this dish added a pop of flavor. Where are the croutons??? I understand some restaurants don't provide croutons with gourmet salad. It should at least be an option. Without the croutons it's lacking a crunchy element. Worth the money! Get the large instead of the small. It's a $2 dollar difference. \n\nThis is a food truck.

We stopped by later in the evening at dusk for dinner to take home to our rental after having been on the road all day. The pizza tastes great and the wood-fired style is awesome; however, between two personal pizzas and a \"large\" salad (the size of a side salad composed of arugula and some Parmesan and tomato) was nothing to rave about. :( We spent around $40 for this which we realize is to be expected in the SF area cost-wise, but we expected to get a little bit more than we did for what we paid. It was a sad intro to our visit in the area. I understand the need for efficiency and simplicity so I think the simple pizza topping options are acceptable, but I would suggest that Firepie re-evaluate their salad sizing and contents (at least a variety of greens instead of solely arugula), and lower the pricing sightly, especially until Firepie strengthens its footing in the pizza industry.", "author": "Melanie O."}

Third I find the fake reviews from the owners friends (that's against the rules...bummer) to be shameful and pathetic. As far as the owner contacting people who post negative reviews and giving them free stuff to come back and write a better review (that's against the rules too...bummer), don't be impressed - if he was that great he would have executed on the first try. If you can screw up something that cooks in 90 seconds...come on. Lastly a few \"pies\" (such ridiculous and overly contrived branding nomenclature - feels plastic and stilted) tasted heavily of beer. If alcohol were an undisclosed ingredient perhaps a few people would be upset, particularly if they were allergic or recovering alcoholics...food for thought. All in all this little idea would be cool if it didn't miss the mark so blatantly. Does make me want to build my own pizza oven in my backyard though.

Unfortunately, the bus stop has recently moved--no more walking along Valencia and picking up a pupusa or cookie on the way. But what do I see a block from the bus stop? A food truck with a real pizza oven! The perfect solution to my dilemma! I order the cheese pizza. The ice cream is tempting, too, but I restrain myself. Two minutes later, I am holding an incredible-smelling personal pie. The taste lives up to the smell. The sauce is savory, not sugary. The cheese is gooey without being greasy. The crust is slightly singed for that smoky taste. The fresh tomatoes and basil seal the deal. Perfection!", "author": "Ilana W."}

Didn't feel like waiting an hour for delivery tho, or having leftovers for days for a single person. All of a sudden I caught the unmistakable delicious smell of...pizza! (At first I thought my mind was playing tricks on me!) Firepie had just what I wanted - a fresh and delicious vegetarian pizza (perfectly portioned and affordable) made quickly and still hot when I got home. Staff was also super friendly and helpful. All I can say is: pansa llena, corazon contento. Full belly, happy heart. Thanks, Firepie!", "author": "missy j."}

Great Neapolitan pizza. I live nearby, so I ordered with their app and just walked over to pick up my pizza, can't say anything about their delivery. I'll definitely order again, if their pizzas continue to be as good as tonight's, they'll be my goto pizza place.", "author": "John S."}
