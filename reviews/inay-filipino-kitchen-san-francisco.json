It's in the food court at the Metreon, so there are other options, but I wanted Filipino food.\n\nThey have a steam table with 10 or so dishes available.  I asked the Tita behind the steam table what was especially good.  I asked about the dinaguan and then asked what was the best today.  I ended up with the pork adobo and garlic rice.  Yes, I know that you are not supposed to have garlic rice with adobo (steamed rice is traditional and provides a plainer canvass upon which the adobo is then the star), but the garlic rice looked and smelled heavenly so I had that.  I took it to go and went back to my hotel room.  And inhaled the food!  They were both quite delicious.\n\nOver the next few days, I took several of my doctoral students there so that they could try Filipino food.  I also had the Bicol Express (yummy) and Lumpia Shanghai (tasty, but expensive).\n\nSo, like all things in life, you have to know what to order.  I liked this place a bunch and would go back.

I approach the counter and see there were three employees behind the counter, two guys filling a grill working and one lady leaning on the counter facing her back towards me on her phone, no other customers around, I stand there and she doesn't notice or hear me so I move around to catch them on their peripheral vision. The lady busy on her phone I wanted to ask, \"so what's happening on Facebook\" but decide no just give her a chance. One of the guys notices me and says \"hello\" to me and the lady then turns around annoyed and rolling eyes asks what I want. I order, pay then wait for my order to come. As she yelled my number I returned my plastic card containing my number they gave me and asked if she can throw away the receipt. She was about to reach for my receipt but then stopped and yelled \"no!\". There was a huge white garbage bin directly behind her for a tiny receipt. I have worked in customer service many years, I was thinking ok maybe I'm arriving and they are about to close. I check online when they close and they still had 1.5 hours. Even when I had bad days I know I'm representing a business and carry on a face and try and provide the best experience for customers so they return. Clearly this was not on her mind. So not sure if she was just annoyed I came to order and disrupted her phone time or perhaps maybe I reminded her of someone she didn't like? Or maybe the restaurant has a policy that they cannot throw away receipts? No idea --but 1 star for customer service, and 5 star for the halo halo here.", "author": "Nicole B."}

Many of the choices they have are not prepared fresh, however, the sisig is. Still, I was not too impressed with the food. It was okay, but seemed to lack any originality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-10", "description": "It's often hard to judge Filipino food because my mom and aunties are such amazing cooks! Pancit, adobo, menudo, sinigang and tinola - they have the Filipino food game down, pat.  And those are just the common dishes, we didn't even go to the dinuguan, kare kare, caldereta, bistek, sisig, bulalo, and those more \"special occasion dishes\"..they whip those up with ease, too. (OMG, I'm making myself hungry.) \n\nThat said, Inay Filipino Kitchen is A-OK.  Missed the marks on some dishes, but have to give them credit for bringing Filipino food to a super mainstream locale. Nice they have several dishes turo turo (point point/buffet counter) style of both the common and more labor intensive/special occasion dishes.  And I'll give them credit for some of their attempts to do Filipino fusion with their lechon nachos, sinigang wings and sisig fries.  If I was feeling adventurous, I would have at least tried the sinigang wings as they are coated with molasses and are said to be spicy and tamarind flavored. (Next time na lang.)\n\nHere's what I ordered: \n\n- Chicken adobo - kinda went basic here because if your chicken adobo isn't good then you're in trouble.  Well, it was good, but I've had better.  As in I can cook it better.  It lacked the vinegar and garlic flavor.  And don't get me started about no whole peppercorns and bay leaf in sight.  Missed the mark there, Inay.\n\n- Pork menudo was better!  Way more flavorful with the red pepper and extra saucy.  Pork and veggies were well seasoned and incorporated in the dish well, but where was the liver?  I guess that's too hardcore.  Still, I'd order it again.\n\n- Tofu adobo was something my dining companion ordered and I'd be remiss if I didn't relay her thoughts on the dish.  Not recognizable to me, I asked the friendly male server what it was.  He said \"adobong tofu\".  Okay, I thought great - she didn't have many other non-pork dishes to try and it looked quite good with the melange of inviting veggies (string beans and bok choy was it)...and the jalapeno that sat atop the mound suggested there could be a kick to it.  Boy, was she disappointed.  They should have mentioned it also contained pork, which means the sauce probably tasted of pork, too.  \n\nMy suggestion would be to label the dishes and maybe list some of the ingredients for the non-Filipino patrons. And even the Filipino patrons would likely welcome signs as not all Filipino dishes are created equally.  My family is from Pampanga - known to be the best cooks in all of the Philippines (and where all the most beautiful women in the PI reside..ahem) - so my palate for Filipino food was refined from the start.  Again, my mom and aunties are some of the best Filipino food cooks out there.  And I've been to Pampanga before and their cooking was on par with all food that I consumed in the(ir) motherland.\n\nBut I've digressed... I would go back to Inay for the menudo.  I'd love to try their arroz caldo on a cold day or when I'm battling a cold, and other mainstays such as their sinigang and sisig.  Prices are average for Filipino turo turo - 2 items with garlic fried rice or pancit for just over $10.00 and they give generous portions.  Service was quick and friendly, albeit they didn't mention the tofu dish had pork.  Three stars, A-OK in my (opinionated) book.", "author": "Marie B."}

But the combination of good food and the Metreon is just not a marriage that seems to be working judging from what I've had here and at Via Moto (review: http://bit.ly/1cqDRiC). There's just something doggedly mediocre about almost everything I get in this food court with the sole exception being the Spicy Tofu Stew with Seafood at Sorabol (review: http://bit.ly/1dsmvmC). I also have to admit that the lackluster service didn't make a great impression on me as I waited a while to order and then waited quite a while to get my order even though I ordered off their own regular menu.\n\nI tried the $7.49 Inay's Salad Bowl with BBQ Chicken which was blandly generic except for the refreshing chopped mango on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1a6ZENN). I was expecting something a bit more distinctive in flavor though, and I might as well have gotten a burrito bowl at Chipotle for the same price. As a side dish, I went for the $3.49 container of Mini-Arroz Caldo, which sounded promising since it looked like jook (photo: http://bit.ly/186PbkT). It was most definitely rice porridge with chunks of processed-tasting chicken from what I could tell. There was a sliced hard-boiled egg which I felt was texturally at odds with the porridge, and the spring onions was the only element that lent freshness to the concoction. I probably need to get myself to Daly City for the good stuff.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...stubbornly bland food doesn't seem to do justice to what may be an interesting cuisine\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...it's the Metreon, for Pinoy's sake\nSERVICE - 1.5 stars...disinterested\nTOTAL - 2 stars...another Metreon misfire", "author": "Ed U."}

That's fine, but it does seem like they are not up the same service and feel as some of the other places there.

It was probably the Filipino in me, but I didn't have to think twice about eating here based on the food/name itself.\n\nNow that I'm thinking about it, lately I've been eating a lot of fries (see other reviews) and I have my boyfriend to blame. So, of course, I ordered the Sisig Fries. \n\nLet me throw in some Wikipedia for those of you who don't know what \"Sisig\" is:\nSisig is a Kapampangan term which means \"to snack on something sour\". It usually refers to fruits, often unripe or half-ripe, sometimes dipped in salt and vinegar. It also refers to a method of preparing fish and meat, especially pork, which is marinated in a sour liquid such as lemon juice or vinegar, then seasoned with salt, pepper and other spices.\n\nSo in this case, it's the vinegar tasty pork with the fries. For $9.00, the portion for these fries are worth it (enough for 2 people share). On top of that, they are sooooo good!!! In addition to the Sisig, there's tomatoes, onions, jalapeno, mango bits, and a yummy sauce! \n\nLike any food court, they have a decent sized seating area to enjoy your food.\n\nFour stars for the fries!!", "author": "Sammie T."}

I would also suggest if you have any issues just speak to Manny the Manager who can fix it for you with an excellent attitude. Is it the Philapines?

I came here last Saturday and I was in line for 30 minutes! I understand they are new but there were like 15 people working there, 5 in the front and I kept seeing more and more coming out from the back (seemed like they were getting up from bed or a nap back there).\n\nThere was no system whatsoever. The older lady wrote the orders on the container but didn't even fulfill them correctly. Everyone looked like they were sleeping, meanwhile 30 people in line! However, the food is good.

Actually pretty cheap for the amount of food you get.  The fries were excellent, you get more meat than potatoes.  The Thai chili sauce was not spicy and was kind of on the bland side, but it was still good.  There are bell peppers and a mango salsa that really continues to surprise you with flavors.  The chicken wings were really good too.  It's not crisy, but more saucy.  The sauce is vinegary and has a hint of sweetness.  However, the garlic rice was OK, kind of dry.

Because, as many other patrons who like their food, I'm also rooting for them to be successful.\n\nThe service - like most Filipino restaurants (such as the Jollibee that used to be in the area), they always seem to be very confused.  The layout of the place looks like there's an assembly line, but people walk all over the place.  The cash register walks to the grill, the cook walks to the cash register.  They seem very disorganized and not efficient.  I hate seeing this in Filipino fast food.  It's like it's one big party in the back, and customers just wait until they get their shit together.\nEach person averages about 10-15 mns to get their order.  I almost didn't want to be repeat customer because of this.\n\nMy suggestion: sit your staff down and talk about coming up with a process.  Talk about roles, and talk about different scenarios and how to handle them.  You're probably all buddies in the back, but that doesn't mean you can't be professional.  Take a page out of Panda Express.  I'd much rather give my $$ to you guys if I don't have to wait 15 mns every time.\n\nI don't like there's a lot of asking each other questions.  The cash register (in all 3 of my visits) had to go ask someone to ask someone what the full order was).  There's always asking each other for status, or order updates, or price, etc.  VERY CONFUSED BUNCH OF PEOPLE.\n\nUnless you get your act together and be more efficient, you'll lose people just because of your line.\n\nUtensils - We're eating meat.  Owners and staff, please try eating one of your bangus with your own plastic utensils.  The only good thing is that their compostable.  But my fork and knife bent all over the place.\nI HATE this about Filipino restaurants too.  They don't think of the usability of their materials where their customer will eat.  This place is pricey enough that inconveniences like that are really less tolerated (especially by potentially returning patrons).\n\nMake sure your spoon can reach the bottom of your cups for halo halo.\n\nIt's simple things like this that sets your service apart.  You have a TON of competition in the food industry.  You have people who are trying Filipino food for the first time.  Give them a good experience.

Twice, I was not impressed with the food so the last time I went, I decided to try the Filipino breakfast. I figured, they couldn't go wrong with cooking marinated tocino and frying bangus belly. I waited for 15 minutes to get my food. The other server was trying to tell me that it's coming but I had been standing there for a while and I got really impatient. I tried to ask the person managing the cash register. Her name is CINDY. You can't miss her: She is a short Filipino woman (obese with midget-like features), unhappy, and looked very miserable. She said, \"You ordered a short-order dish so it will take a long time to cook.\" She said that in a loud tone and very angry face. Mind you that I saw the server as he was getting the tocino and fish (already cooked) and they were only going to warm it up.  I couldn't help myself but remind her that the least she could say was that she's sorry. She had the nerve and the audacity to reason out. I got so upset that I asked them to  refund my money. An older and pleasant lady, who apparently is the owner, came out to say sorry and spoke to me. She was apologetic and asked me to forgive the delay. She even came out to speak to me after to let me know how sorry she was. She definitely knew the meaning of customer service and knew how to treat customers. The question is  how can she have an employee like Cindy?\n\nCindy has ZERO customer service and as I was standing there, I felt so ashamed of myself witnessing this very sad person treat my other 'kababayans' with the same nasty, unprofessional, and VERY RUDE attitude. She was less rude to other non-Filipino customers. \n\nI am Filipino myself and I do support every Filipino establishment and organization. However, the owner of Inay's should do something to this unhappy woman. She is ruining the business with her attitude, demeanor, and poor customer service. She should be placed in the kitchen where no one can see her. She is such a disgrace to this Filipino establishment and I feel ashamed that she is Filipino.

I was craving some filipino food so it was perfect that we were here and everything looked good. I ordered the beef steak with garlic rice. While the portions are hefty, it lacked a little in flavor. The garlic rice was good but the beef steak needed more flavor, more pizzaz. The BF ordered Kare-Kare. He was a little disappointed with his as well....what lacked was the flavor. It may have just been an off day for them...but I would definitely go back and try other dishes....better luck next time :)", "author": "Mel P."}

Halo halo needs more ingredients-mostly ice. Take away the ice cream and the whole thing is a waste. Why cant they add banana, sweet potato or even sago and gulaman- they are all cheap. Ordered lechon kawali one time, the skin is so soft and not crunchy- wasted my money. Bbq is too salty and does not have the inviting aroma. Boneless bangus is too dry. One time my coworker ate the Bicol express- did not see for days due to lbm. Lastly, they should serve anything with sauce or juice in a bowl container not squeezing it with the rest of your plate. Not a fan here.", "author": "Art M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-21", "description": "Food is delicious; reminds me of home cooking. Their selections, reminds me of family potluck parties. However their service lacks organization; most especially the young lady at the register. Maybe she can take orders or restock instead; because multitasking is not for her. I also feel they should have a sign indicating where the line begins. I'd give 4 stars BUT having to wait over 15 minutes with only 1-person ahead of us for an order of halo halo. That's too long of a wait.", "author": "Phillip B."}

My fish was overcooked, though (gotta be careful with overcooking thin pieces of meat, guys...c'mon).  Beef stew was good.  Overall, it tastes like many of the homemade filipino foods you may have had at birthday parties and the like.  Service is ok.  Much better than Jollibee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-08", "description": "For \"mall food\", it sure is tasty. Good selection of food also. Reminds me of being in the Philippines actually. The lady behind the counter was super nice. We ordered the 2 dish platter and garlic rice of course. 2 huge balls of garlic rice! Nobody knows rice like Filipinos! Other Asians skimp on rice, that just ain't right. So anyway, I ordered the beef steak and dinuguan, my partner ordered pork adobo and caldereta. They give pretty good size servings. Price is $9.99 for each platter which is not bad. If you want just one dish it's $7.99. Everything tasted exactly the way they're supposed to, which is a good thing. Almost reminded me of my mom's cooking.. almost, since no one on Earth can ever beat my mom's cooking haha. Hey I'll be coming here often.. esp since it's in the Metreon close to soon to open CityTarget and of course AMC. Oh and we showed up at 11am so I didn't notice slow service, we were served right away and food was ready.", "author": "Vol T."}

The selection is pretty vast and they have an all-day breakfast menu.  Filipino food places aren't too common in the sea of Vietnamese, Thai  and Japanese restaurants in the city, or in general.  It's good to try something different once a while.  Tried the Beef Steak Togalog.  Meat was tender, mixed with some onions and juicy.  Great served over the garlic rice or one could request 1/2 fried and 1/2 garlic rice combo.  For the portions, the price was just right.  Who said you couldn't have a hearty meal in the heart of SF under $10?", "author": "A t."}

Great portion for a reasonable price!  I ask for the 1/2 noodle + 1/2 garlic fried rice combo with another dish otherwise they will give you three scoops of garlic fried rice.  Some dishes are acquired taste like the diniguan (pork blood stew) but don't be afraid to try other dishes which are delicious.

The worker took my order and basically got it confused with another order and gave my food to someone else.  It baffles me how the workers didn't think anything was wrong when I was just standing there by the cash register for the longest time, but it seemed that they just didn't care.  I waited for about 15 min and had to ask them before they realized what happened.  Then it was another 10 min of prepping the food.  The manager was really nice and gave me some samples to munch on while I waited, but the food was just okay.", "author": "Joy Z."}

Unfortunately, they still have to make a lot of improvements.  First, the people are VERY SLOOOW, and they also seem sooo bored and unhappy with what they are doing.  Second, the food list is great but the tastes are very bland.  If you are going to open an \"ethnic\" restaurant, why do you have to change the recipes so they taste so bland?  Even the turon had no taste and no sugar!  I hope that the owners make this a more authentic Filipino food place and hire people who know how to  deal with the customers.", "author": "Ben F."}

I called beforehand to figure out where in the Metreon this place and the person on the phone was absolutely rude. I ordered the all day breakfast with longanisa. The longanisa was the worst I have ever had. The garlic rice didn't taste like such at all. There was more scallions than garlic. The side of onions and tomatoes are tasteless and the eggs didn't taste well either. Overall horrible experience. They need to get it together.", "author": "Dinorah R."}

Those two young ladies serving just treated us like we were in a cafeteria handing out our food just like that. When it was my turn, I was horrified to see this girl about to place the meat with liquidy sauce on the porous brown plate where they serve your rice. I equested that they put it in a container. Girl gave me an annoyed look, the other girl nodded & told her \"ako na bahala\" meaning she'll deal with it. Deal with it she did! She charged me $0.25 for the container. I don't mind being charged, but be up front about the fact that there is a charge for the container. Don't just include it in my bill & expect me to be okay with it. Inform your costumer about the additional fee, instead of being sneaky about it. Be happy for the 1star. I am giving that for the okay food you serve. You don't really deserve even half a star", "author": "Rems S."}

I have been eating at Inay's everyday for two weeks.  They really have good food.  I tried a lot of dishes with garlic rice and all of them  were very tasty.  It's true that the serving crew were slow and disorganized.  So, normally, I either came here at around 11:30 am or after 1:30 pm to avoid the crowd.  Once, I came and talked to one of the girls behind the steam table.  Then she went back to the kitchen behind the wall.  10 minutes later, she brought probably a spring roll to another customer.  There was a cashier standing there but she didn't even bother to ask my need.  There were a couple of people behind me waiting in line and they left.  Finally, 15 min later, I got my plate from the steam table.  I wanted to take a lunch break and I didn't mind waiting.", "author": "Raymond C."}
