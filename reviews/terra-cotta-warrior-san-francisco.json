We've had vastly different experiences in the couple times we've been. Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for noodle lovers or fans of Northern Chinese food.\n\nBiang Biang cumin lamb noodles - we love cumin, lamb, and noodles, but this dish didn't come together. The amount of oily cumin on the noodles was overwhelming and the noodle-to-lamb ratio was too high. \n\nCold Mian Pi - this was really refreshing. I wished they were more generous with the cucumbers in the dish\n\nSpicy & sour pork noodle soup - this was just bad. Super overcooked noodles with a broth that was somehow bland and had too many things going on\n\nStir fried pork noodle - super oily, but was deliciously savory. Wouldn't get this dish for myself, but is great family style\n\nSpicy beef noodle soup - much better than the spicy & sour pork noodle soup but not amazing. The beef was too thinly sliced\n\nCold spicy beef - a nice spicy starter to share. Small pieces packed a flavorful punch", "author": "Yuchen L."}

Terra Cotta Warrior is located in outer sunset.  You can easily get there on the N-Judah.  They are known for their dishes from Shaanxi.\n\nSince there was a group of us we each ordered a dish to share family style.

It was quite spicy for someone that can't tolerate spicy food well, but I really liked it! It was bits of pork slices tossed in a tomato-based sauce - was very flavorful! Also fun because you get to mix your own food. Good textured noodles too! Also had the lamb burger, which was delicious too. Also recommend their cumin lamb noodles, very delicious! Sometimes I wonder how I survived in a restaurant with so much spicy food but I managed! They have these flavors that I would sometimes randomly crave.\n\nGood ambiance, dim lighting, great decor.

It is quite uncommon to find Chinese food outside of Szechuan, Cantonese, or Shanghai food so I was excited to find Northern Chinese food. I'm from Northern China so my infatuation with noodles is deeply rooted in this region's cuisine. The taste is pretty good and the portion sizes are decent. The service is aite, pretty average for a Chinese restaurant, they'll come when you call them but they won't really check up on you. The price is average not a fabulous deal but pretty filling for the money. \n\nIt was just a bit strange when we asked for ice water and they handed us regular water and when we asked for ice again they took the cup back and brought the exact same thing back. Also they did not have pickled garlic for their \"pita soaked in lamb soup\" even though the photo showed it.\n\nThe \"Mian Pi\", Big plate chicken, shaanxi stir fried hand pulled noodles were especially delicious and a must try if you come to this restaurant. \n\nOverall my cravings are satisfied but I am not overly amazed or super impressed.", "author": "Ellen G."}

I came with a group of 3 and our overall experience at this place was OKAY. It was not as amazing as we thought would be. There are definitely much better Xi'an restaurants in the south bay. \n\nItems we ordered:\nCeleries with dried bean curd sticks (1/5): Probably the worst dish out of all we ordered. The dried bean curd tasted like plastic/rubber and very hard to chew. The dish itself was more on the bland side.\n\nGarlic taste pig's ear (4/5): We really liked this dish. It was pretty flavorful and the pig's ear was cooked well. I liked that the dish has a significant portion of marinated cucumber to go with the pig's ear.\n\nPita bread soaked in lamb soup (3/5): The soup smelled super lamby but the items in the soup were actually not as lamby as we expected. The only thing really frustrated us was the large amount of pita bread. Soon after we got the soup, the pita bread had soaked up all the broth. We tried to ask for more soup, but the waitress told us it would be additional $3 for the soup. WTH...\n\nThree-In-One Pork Biangbiang noodles (4/5): This noodle dish was pretty good. I really liked the scrambled eggs and the braised pork belly. The noodles were hand-cut so super thick and chewy. If I ever come back to this place, I would order this dish again.\n\nSpicy beef noodle soup (3.5/5): The overall flavor was not bad but we did not expect the noodles to be this thick--they were close to Udon noodles. All the beef noodles I have had so far use thin noodles so I was not used to the thick noodles from Terra Cotta. I wouldn't order this dish again.", "author": "Clare L."}

This is a common trend among a lot of Chinese restaurants - when business picks up, they become greedy, and try to \"cheat\" with either quality or quantity for more profits. While I agree the food here is good, it's really not amazing or super representative of what you can get in Xi'an. And I get it, most of you will never go to Xi'an and have the real deal, which is why I'm even more bummed that you aren't getting the real deal here. \n\nThe last time I was here, the cold noodles (liang pi) was fine, but the big plate chicken dish was not great. The potatoes were undercooked, they used jalape\u00f1os, and I think they gave us the small dish even though we ordered the big one - I felt cheated. The pita in lamb soup was just completely off - we don't incorporate celery in the soup, we add way more lamb.... \n\nYou'll have a great meal here, no doubt.

I'm not... so this place was just okay for me, but my parents loved this place!\n\nMy parents really enjoyed the lamb noodle soups. My dad ordered the pita bread in lamb soup which came with glass noodles, and my mom ordered the regular lamb noodle soup with knife cut noodles. We were quite curious about 'pita bread' in lamb soup. In reality, it is just little dough balls cooked in the soup to a nice chewy bite, but before seeing/tasting it, I definitely thought it was strange that they would serve a soup with wet soggy pita bread in it.\n\nI ordered the noodles in sizzling oil. It was actually quite bland, I think because I asked for it to be less spicy. I ended up spooning some of the liquids from our sauteed veggies over the noodles which made them a little more palatable, but just barely. If you order the noodles, I'd definitely recommending getting them as is, not less spicy. \n\nWe also tried the chinese burger with pork, which my mom really liked but I thought was just okay. There meat to bun ratio was great, but I actually found the pork a tad dry.\n\nTerra Cotta Warrior was a hit with the parents. They have already requested a re-visit the next time they are in town.

My family and I had been craving some good noodles and I had heard about this place from my cousins.\n\nWe ordered 5 noodle dishes, the mapo tofu, and a pork burger to share. The pork burger was alright. I liked the bread better than the pork. The mapo tofu was really good and the tofu was very soft. The sauce did remind me of instant noodles spice, but I like that. \n\nOn to the noodles. We ordered the biang biang noodles 2, minced pork noodles, pickled soup noodles, regular wonton soup, and clear noodles with beef. The minched pork noodles was my favorite. I didn't eat more of it at dinner so I could have it as leftovers for lunch the next day. The biang biang noodles were good, but next time I want to try it with the lamb and beef. Wonton soup was like how wonton soup should be. The pickled soup noodles were my least favorite. My mother likes that so she ordered it. The soup just had too much vinegar for my taste. If you like vinegar, you might like this dish. My brother ate the clear noodles with beef. The beef can get stuck in your teeth, so have some floss handy. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to try some other hand pulled noodle dishes and get the minced pork noodles again.", "author": "Allyson L."}

So I'd pass on getting that again.\n\nBoth mian pi's are really good.

Cumin flavor with onions.\n\nThe biang biang noodles I thought was really good too. However, I wouldn't advise getting a triple (especially not to share with a bunch of people). I'd just stick to one (probably just the spicy one). The third with meat actually didn't have much flavor I thought, and the tomato one was good, but I can see me getting tired of eating a bowl of that.\n\nThe lamb soup was pretty wholesome and is great if you just want some warm soup.

The cuisine is west northern China so expect lots of spices as ingredients. On the menu you will recognize familiar Chinese dishes from anywhere but the taste is slightly different here, almost fusiony. Having said that many items are on the spicy side be it a hot or cold dish or something that does not appear spicy.\n\nI'm not crazy for lamb but their lamb cumin was terrific. The dumplings are good but are better with the side dipping sauce. Get the hot and sour pork dumpling soup though which is as good as it sounds. The scallion oil ginger chicken is good too. If like fried rice the Shanxi fried rice is good if a bit heavy on the black bean sauce.\n\nThe noodle soups uses thicker noodles so it's harder to eat. They will cut the noodles to shorter length at your table. If not, just request it or else it could get messy. Tea and water are provided but I do prefer Tsing Tao beer with the food, which I've tried half of the menu so still have a ways to go!\n\nNote reservations are not taken so plan ahead if have a group.

It's great to try a different type of Chinese food in SF! Think hand-pulled noodles in chili oil, lamb burgers, etc. \n\nFood:\nHonestly every dish we ordered here was terrific! I would recommend coming with at least 4 people so you can try multiple things. I ranked them from most favorite to least, but everything was a HIT. \n\n-Guangzhou Hot Spicy Noodles - I think this is their signature dish. Noodles were super chewy, and I loved the hot spicy soup it was soaking in! Yes it was spicy, but just medium spice. A MUST!!!\n\n-Mapo Tofu - Wow, this is another must. I had never tasted mapo tofu like this before. I think this is how it's supposed to taste - tofu was super soft (but not silken), and firm enough to make it to your plate. The SAUCE was INCREDIBLE! It had the perfect amount of chili oil and spice. There was so much flavor - now I want to find the recipe so I can make it for myself. This was a hit, and great for vegetarians too.\n\n-Cumin Lamb Burger - I usually hate lamb, but this was excellent. They put a LOT of cumin with the lamb, and it made this really great flavor once again! Our friend usually hates cumin, but also enjoyed this dish - the cumin was not too empowering. It was also big enough to share among 4 people, btw, and I'd recommend just getting the one since it can be sliced into 4, easily shared, and you get to try it without being full. \n\n-Stir-Fried Lamb with Pita Bread Soaked in Lamb Soup - I've never had anything like this before! I loved the lamb broth. I also really loved how the pita bread was soaked up in the soup - it tasted soft and chewy, just like their noodles in a way, but little bite size pieces. Great if you're craving soup.\n\n-Shaanxi Mian Pi with sesame sauce - this was a smaller dish, more of an appetizer. It comes cold, so refreshing on a hot day. Loved the noodles - so chewy once again, and also the sesame peanut sauce was unique to this Shaanxi cuisine.\n\n-Shaanxi Stir-Fried Wide Noodles - This was a tomato based noodle dish, with sweet flavors. This was a nice contrast to the spicy, thin noodles present in other dishes. The noodles were so wide - YUM! This was a very comforting dish, not very complex. Great as a leftover too.\n\n-Shaanxi Fried Rice Spicy - this was a great dish too! It did remind me most of regular Chinese cuisine though, so if you want to be more adventurous, I guess you can skip this one. However if you are a fried rice lover, just get it!\n\nService:\nNonexistent here, but I'm not surprised. Just laying the cards on the table. When they called our name to be seated, instead of showing us to our table, they literally said, \"You sit over there\" and pointed lol. When we were finished eating (only had been seated 1 hour for 4 people), they said, \"we've got a long line and we're only open for another hour\" implying that we needed to get the hell out of there. For the check, we gave 2 credit cards. They left our table with our bill, came back 5 mins later saying \"is this your credit card?\" and we were super confused. I guess they confused our check with another table, and charged the entire bill on 1 of our credit cards! I won't dock on their rating because all Chinese restaurants are similar in some way shape or form.\n\nVerdict:\nFood overall is excellent, and also very cheap. For 4 people, I think the total was around $100, with leftovers for 2 extra meals! Service is awful, but there's no way around it. Also, a tip - get there when it opens, because we had to wait at least 30 mins for our table on a Sunday night. THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE VISIT!

I was feeling some noodles, and the boy just wanted something warm.\n\nUpon being seated, we were served hot tea (YAS the barley kind) and given menus that are both in Chinese and English. The items aren't very descriptive, and I don't usually eat Xi'An type of Chinese food unless I'm with my parents since they know what to order...so we did our best. We started with the silky tofu and 1000-year-old-century-egg because he's never had \"black eggs\" before. He got the biang biang noodles which are one of their specialties...lamb and cumin. The noodles are my favorite type--thick, chewy, and perfectly cut. I had the vegetarian chili oil noodles, which were made with udon-style noodles but still delicious. Even though the noodles are drenched in a chili oil soupy form, it wasn't as spicy as the biang biang, the boo said. I enjoyed the flavor and ate THE WHOLE THING.\n\nWe both wished for more veggies in all of the dishes. There were a few veggie options, but this type of Chinese cuisine is known for being meat-heavy and spicy. We expected that going in, but I'm glad at least there were a few meatless options. The service is fast and no fuss, not very polite, but what do you expect. When you walk in, put your name down on their sign-in sheet, and patiently wait your turn. You can also buy take-out, which we saw some people do because the lines did seem to be crazy long even after we finished dinner after 8PM. \n\nA great local Chinese spot in the area, noodles are cooked to that QQ perfection.", "author": "Jodi H."}

Since Xi'an was historically an important trade center during the Silk Road days, its food has a lot of Islamic influences hence, the heavy use of beef and lamb in the dishes. \n\nSome of the Xi'an specialities featured here include roujiamuo or Chinese style pita bread stuffed with meat, biang biang noodles, and da pang ji (literally translated as big plate chicken) Most of the noodles come with the option of being served with lamb. \n\nWe tried all the specialties except da pang ji (big plate chicken) because they were already out by the time we ordered. Everything else we tried however was good. I'd recommend the ruojiamuo, thinly sliced pork and garlic side dish and the very refreshing spinach and garlic side dish. (It's super refreshing!)\n\nMany of the dishes skew heavily towards noodles and bread so beware if you were expecting the typical Chinese restaurant fare. Also they have many delicious vegetarian options. My friend got the vegetarian ruojiamuo substituted with tofu and bean sprouts and she found it delicious.\n\nDefinitely give this a try if you would like to explore a different and delicious side of Chinese cuisine!", "author": "Sherica L."}

We ordered the three in one biangbiang noodles (noodles with sizzling oil, egg with tomato gravy, and pork) as well as the cumin lamb burger, and shaanxi mian-pi (a cold noodle dish). For two people, that was tons of food and all were really tasty. The cumin lamb burger was almost exactly like the one at Xi'an famous foods.

I really enjoy pictures of food on the wall when it comes to ethnic restaurants. They are very well know for certain items so I always like to try the popular things first. We ordered the lamb cumin noodles, and it TO DIE FOR. Perfectly silky, slippery, chewy noodles and thinly sliced lamb are laced in this delectably oily, cumin-y sauce that makes your taste buds dance. There's also some onions and green onions to balance the dish out nicely and provides some crunch. I could write about this dish for days *dreams about being at Terra cotta warrior right now*.\n\nThe reason this place can't get five stars is because we ordered a second dish that didn't come forever. Table after table around us got more and more dishes and my order never came. When I finally asked about 30 or so minutes later, she apologized and brought out our second order which was a cold noodle dish with cucumber, minced pork and black bean sauce.

Shanxi mianpi - 5/5 delicious, and I'll get this probably every time I come back. The flavor of the chili oil is just amazing and the cucumbers make the dish taste very fresh. There is some bread on top perhaps to soak up the oil and I was skeptical, but it turned out being a decent addition to the dish though not necessary.\n2. Stir-fried lamb with cumin - 4/5 delicious, and I'd be happy to eat this dish again but also willing to replace it to try something new. I wasn't too much of a fan of the ginger pieces in it, but it still tasted great. The lamb was tender and the portion provided was reasonably substantial.\n3. Sweet fermented glutinous rice with dumpling ball - 3/5 reminds me of home cooking, but the soup was a bit gooier than I've had before.

They have many appetizers that feature only vegetables with delicious noodle dishes without meat. \n\nSome of my must-get/favorite dishes here:\n1. Mixed cold-shredded potatoes: an appetizer that sounds simple, but is actually quite hard to perfect at home. First, it requires a super skilled chef to slice the potatoes (mandolines are never used in Chinese cutlery), which is then slightly cooked before it tossed in a tangy, vinegary, spicy oil. \n2. Mian Pi- cold noodles that was a specialty at Xi'an Famous Foods. This is best place I have found in the Bay Area that serves great mian-pi. It is essentially a cold, widely cut noodle that is tossed in a vinegary spicy sauce with pieces of pita bread or served with sesame pate (both are good!). This can be ordered hot or cold. I like to order this as a cold appetizer and then have the other noodles hot. I like to think of it like a mung-bean noodle because it kind of clear and has a jello-ish texture. If you haven't had it is before, this is an iconic dish to order. \n3. Preserved egg and silken tofu: it's pretty standard, often eaten in Taiwanese cuisine. I really like the consistency and flavors of the thousand-year eggs here. It smells less foul but has a great texture. \n4. (Vegetarian) Sizzling Oil noodles: simple, QQ noodles that are tossed in a nicely balanced mix of spicy oil, sprouts and green onions. Simple, yet so satisfying flavorful and tasty. I guarantee your vegetarian friends will love this. \n5. Cumin lamb biang biang noodles: this is by far, MY FAVORITE dish to order here, followed by the Shanxi Mian Pi. The flavors of the cumin and lamb are on point, adding a beautiful brown gravy that is just absorbed by the wide flour noodles. The noodles are like Chinese paparadelle's...QQ-chewing consistency. It's great. \n6. Lamb with pita bread (stir fry): Chinese pita bread is flour noodles that shaped and cut into little cubes that you eat like macaroni pasta, but it's better at absorbing flavors and has a better consistency. It holds up the sauce very well and is quite a unique texture and shape if you've never had it before. It's not actually \"pita bread.\"\n\nSome of my other favorites, but not must-order if you don't have enough people to split family style:\n1. Chicken in scallion oil: it's like \"mouth watering chicken\" but without the spiciness. Very refreshing cold chicken appetizer that is a great palate opener. \n2. Lotus Root salad: another appetizer that I like which is crispy parboiled lotus root slices that are tossed in a vinegary sauce that really opens up your senses and taste buds. Very refreshing vegetable dish to add to your repertoire. \n3. Hot and Sour Dumpling Soup: great flavor! It's nothing like hot-and-sour soup, but has a similar flavor profile that is created with a different set of fresh ingredients. The dumplings were made well with a perfect texture of dumpling wrapping and juicy filling. \n4. ShaanXi spicy fish: this is kind of Xi'an version of \"water boiled fish.\" It's less numbing, but has a similar idea. Spicy fish fillet that is boiled in a hot spicy broth of napa cabbage, onions and tofu. It's great to eat with rice or just as a rich stew. \n\nNot recommended:\nChicken and potato gravy with noodle: this is another popular Xi'an dish, but it is not made that well here. The noodles are overboiled and stick together, making it hard to eat with the gravy. The noodles does not pick up the gravy well, making it overall pretty bland to eat. The chicken and potato pieces are good but are overburdened by a heap of noodles. I am usually a fan of this fish, but not with the way it is cooked, seasoned and served here. My favorite version of this dish so far has been from \"Chef Zhao Bistro\" in Mountain View (check it out if you have time). \n\nOverall, a wonderful addition to SF Bay Area. It's a flavor and texture profile of Chinese cuisine that is underrepresented here, and is much appreciated by Chinese folks in the area. Be wary there is always a wait here, usually with parties of 4 or larger. The food here is good, authentic, which attracts a large customer base!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-12", "description": "There must be a battalion of terra cotta warriors underneath the restaurant keeping this gem mostly under-the-radar among amateur foodies, who tend to flock to commonplace dim sum or not-even-Chinese fried chicken wings. \n\nTerra Cotta Warrior specializes in Xian cuisine, which incorporates an interesting melange of Muslim influence and Sichuan spiciness. With the staples of Northern (dumplings and sub-par XLB) and Southern Chinese food (dim sum and wontons) throughout SF, it's refreshing to explore the bold exotic flavor profiles and intriguing compositions at Terra Cotta.\n\nSpecial diet diners beware: while the menu is extensive, the noodles are not to be missed: low-carb sticklers and faux gluten-allergic hipsters may want to make an exception for this visit. Noodles are house-made and the texture is delightfully al dente, exemplifying the Chinese idiom \"bouncing off the teeth\". The MIAN PI WITH SESAME SAUCE goes all out with extra-thick ribbons of noodle, complemented by a nutty sesame paste and an intense bottom layer of neon orange chili oil. It may sound odd (especially with the imagery of bouncy noodles), but it was was memorable and strangely satisfying. It is no wonder they sometimes sell out of mian pi by early afternoon.\n\nThe BIANG BIANG NOODLES 3 WAYS boasts the same chewy noodles, now in a coarse knife-cut form for an even authentic and homemade feel. Mmm, deliciously carby. The 3 ways include the soy sauce pork belly, sizzling oil, and tomato egg sauces which are all ways that you can order the biang biang noodles. Not sure I'd recommend mixing it all together since it does become quite heterogeneous, though still delicious. This is a great way to sample three dishes in one, but if you strongly gravitate towards a particular one I would go for just ordering that because the combo does cost more. Note that the noodles, being housemade, are seemingly endless so it's a bit of a struggle to portion this out.\n\nInitially I thought the LAMB SOAKED IN PITA BREAD sounded disgusting, as I had the idea of soggy pita bread in soup. But seeing how Yelpers seemed to enjoy it (and that there seemed to be no pictures of soggy pita bread), we went for it. This was my favorite dish, tied with mian pi.The soup was simple and soothing, the lamb was tender and not gamy, and there was a fascinating mixture of thick mochi-like noodle chunks (the \"pita bread\") starkly contrasted by thin silver noodles. It appears hodgepodge-ish, but all the ingredients and textures come together flawlessy as expected for a time-tested regional specialty dish.\n\nWhile the GARLIC SLICED PORK is not one of their well-known items, it's a great appetizer that wakes up your taste buds with thin pork slices bathed in chili oil and liberally sprinkled with chopped garlic--nearly garlicky enough to inducted into the Stinking Rose.\n\nAlthough I try to sound knowledgeable about regional specialties of Chinese cuisine, I am by no means well-versed (I hardly know my geography in China!). However when I google the restaurant specials I tried here, the Wikipedia gods tell me they are indeed all trademark dishes of the Shaanxi province.\n\nLastly, note that Yelp has a pop-up warning about the poor score on food safety inspection, but to be honest I always take that with a grain of salt. There's not much info on the exact metrics of the ratings, and I've seen worse at places with non-problematic ratings. In any case, the restaurant looked just fine. Either the spices kill the bugs, or the food inspector was weak and couldn't stomach any spicy food. \n\nWhile the restaurant does tend to get busier during peak times, there is usually no wait if you come earlier. The terra cotta warriors appreciate your thoughtfulness and save seats to the well-prepared who arrive ahead of time. Okay that may be taking the superstition analogy too far... but in short, thank you Terra Cotta for bringing an adventurous taste of Xian to Sunset.", "author": "Edna C."}

I came here on a Saturday, shortly after 2:00pm. They close at 2:30pm, but just after 2pm, they stopped taking people on the wait list. We were still able to get a table, but were extremely rushed to order. We barely even had a chance to look at the menu and the waitress wanted us to order because the kitchen was closing down. The only thing I wanted to order (the mian pi), they were out of...so, we had to scramble to choose some other dishes. \n\nWe ordered the Biangbiang noodles with cumin lamb ($10.95) - this dish was pretty spicy! The noodles are loooong and wide, making it a little hard to break off. I thought this dish was not bad, but I wasn't crazy about it, possibly because it was a little too spicy for me. \n\nMixed cold shredded potatoes ($5.25) - it's exactly how it's described. Cold, shredded potatoes. It's an ok side dish, but wasn't extremely special or flavorful. \n\nChinese burger with pork ($5.25) - Too bland to eat as a burger. It's just basic meat and bread. The meat was marinated in soy sauce and tasted ok by itself, however, once you put the meat in between the bread, it becomes too bland. There is too much bread and too little meat, making the plain bread taste overpowering. I wouldn't order this again. It was disappointing.\n\nSaut\u00e9ed lamb slices with scallions ($12.95) - This was the only dish I really liked and would definitely order this again. Lamb was thinly sliced and very flavorful. This dish was very mildly spicy and tasted great with the onions. \n\nOverall, with 3 so-so dishes and one great dish, topped with extremely rushed service, I'd say my first try at Terra Cotta Warrior was just OK. (Not to mention they were out of the one dish I wanted to order and they have a poor food safety score.) I probably would come back here someday to try their mian pi and lamb with scallions...but I'm not in a rush. There are definitely some good dishes here.

We ordered the ginger spinach, couple's delight, and lamb cumin biang biang noodles. The flavoring for the ginger spinach & couple's delight was perfect and all 3 of us loved it. The biang biang noodles were a bit underwhelming given my expectations, but the noodles had a nice bouncy texture. I wanted to add a lamb burger near the end of our lunch, but our waiter brought out a pork burger (?) instead and that was so-so.\n\nWhile the food was great, the service was pretty iffy -- our main waiter seemed confused when we placed our order so my friend had to check with the counter, he was a bit aggressive when I asked to add the extra dish (plus, turns out he placed the wrong order), and it took us 3-4 tries to finally have him get us the check. \n\nI'll probably be back for the food, but I hope the next time the service won't be as uncomfortable.", "author": "Shela H."}

Yes, even better than San Tung, although it depends on what you like (I prefer hand pulled noodles over fried chicken any day, but most people I know would disagree).\n\nYou cannot go wrong with their Shaanxi specialties. I recommend the mian pi (chewy cold noodles mixed with sliced cucumbers, sesame oil, vinegar, and chili), noodles in sizzling oil (perfectly chewy noodles seasoned with chili flakes and black vinegar, and doused with boiling oil), and their soup noodles (I am partial to the pita bread soaked in lamb soup but again, you cannot go wrong with any of their specialty soup noodles). This is a noodle heavy restaurant and from what I can tell, the noodles are slapped, stretched, and torn by hand. You'll be able to tell immediately from the friendly resistance with each bite.\n\nI think this is only the second Xian restaurant in all of SF. The spices and sauces the Shaanxi owner has developed in-house has really made this place special. It's nice to see other types of Chinese food be recognized and appreciated in the Sunset besides Chinese/Vietnamese and Northern Chinese (which has seen a tremendous rise lately in the area).

We finally got another opportunity to swing by on Mother's Day. I must confess that we came here with high hopes but left rather disappointed.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nOK, we were super excited to come try their hand-pulled noodles so we ordered the Biang Biang noodles three ways and the Shanxi stir fried wide noodles. Everyone knows that texture is the most important part of a good noodle. These were overly cooked and almost soggy, as if the water used for boiling the noodles had been used a few times too many. A restaurant that can't get noodles right? That's a no-no in my book.\n\nWe also tried the wonton in chili oil and the cold noodles (mian-pi). The mian pi was not great -- it was on the bland side. The wontons in chili oil were probably the highlight of the meal however, which was confusing because I figured the sauce for the mian pi was pretty similar. I ended up mixing the mian pi noodles in the wonton chili oil for more flavor. \n\nThe lamb dishes were pretty on point here. The pita in lamb soup is definitely worth trying. The cumin lamb burger was great -- the diced peppers mixed in the cumin lamb gave it a kick that wasn't intolerable (And still good as reheated leftovers!). \n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nEach dish was around  $10 and came in generous portions. With side dishes, you will probably run about $15 per person. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nIt's a busy restaurant and everything is jammed into a pretty small place, but the waiters manage to keep things going at a decent pace. When I asked for a knife to cut up the lamb cumin burger, a waiter brought by a pair of cooking shears. Asians and using scissors for everything, bless!\n\nNo bonus star because I probably wouldn't come back although I could be persuaded to give this place another chance in the future if I'm really craving that cumin lamb...\n\nTL;DR: Cumin lamb burger!

However, its customer service is beyond HORRIBLE. I could've literally gone up to the counter and tell the cashier to input my food orders for me rather than having the \"waiter\" and \"waitress\" serve me. \n\nAfter a few minutes of first checked into the place, the waitress/hostess called out my name (or so I thought, another person with the same name) and I've answered. Out of nowhere, the waitress scolded me \"why didn't you answer when I called you?!\" In mandarin. After we got seated, the waitress fortunately got our order. Again, the food is good enough, however, still not close to actual food in Xi'An. The Xi'An cold noodle's portion was too small and I had to order another. Then, this is where the second red flag comes. After I finally waved down one of the waiters, I told him my orders clearly and he responded with ok got it. But, after we've finished all of our dishes, my second round of orders still didn't come right there and then, I knew the waiter forgot my orders, along with my glass of water and change out my overflowing dirty plate. \n\nAll in all, I feel for a restaurant as \"good\" as this, their staff should come with better standard; being more professional and experiences.

I think it's always a risk when ordering something like this, and I was quite disappointed as I think there would be no way for them to wash it and reheat without making it saltier because it cooks more of the flavor into the meat with reheating, which is what I experienced at another place with the same kind of dish when I asked them to wash the salt out.

You can probably only get it here, LA, or NY, so take advantage!\n\nSo being fully honest here, I came here around a year ago and had some of the worst diarrhea of my life.  Like sitting on the toilet in a daze, wondering how my life has come to this.  And then I came back two more times because the food was so good, just to see if that was just a fluke.  But it wasn't.  So then I learned how to make biang biang noodles at home because who comes to a restaurant for repeat diarrhea 4 times in a row, amirite?\n\nHowever, while my homemade noodles are pretty damn good, they still didn't compare, and so I would check the yelp page occasionally, just to dream, and about 6 months ago found out that it was under new management!  I had to try it again.  And I'm happy to report that I've eaten here 8+ times and have had ZERO issues.  And now I can positively recommend it to you!\n\nFood Fact Time - This place makes a special kind of noodle called Biang Biang noodles.  These are wheat noodles that are hand made, very thick, and very wide.  They have a stretchy texture with a very pleasant mouthfeel.  Biang is also one of the most complex Chinese characters with 57 strokes, it's unclear what the word means or where it originated from.  This is one of the only places you can get them in SF!\n\nThings to get:\n- Yopo noodles (Sizzling Oil noodles or something like that) - This dish is BOMB.  You might want to get two.  It started with Biang Biang noodles in a vinegar and soy sauce.  Then fresh garlic and fresh chili powder is placed on top, they heat a pan of oil until it's smoking hot, and then they pour it over, cooking the garlic and chili powder.\n- Anything else that sounds good to you with Biang Biang noodles in them (cumin lamb, egg and tomatoes, various stir fries)\n- Pork burger - I haven't had too many of these, so not sure how this one stacks up against other restaurants, but the idea of the dish is great.  It's a flatbread that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It's filled with juicy, fatty pork that's been cooked forever.  The fat has rendered down and it's coating the inside on the bread, making it moist and delicious.\n- Lamb soup with pita bread - Clean tasting lamb soup.  Has torn off pieces of the pork burger bread in there, along with some bean vermicelli.  Nice way to offset the heavy flavors.\n\ntl;dr - sizzling oil noodes", "author": "Sean Y."}

Could have done with just 1 because it's so large. the buns are extra crispy and soaked in lamb oil for more flavor. cumin taste is quite strong. this was the spiciest dish out of everything we ordered.\nshaanxi spicy fish - looks spicy at first, but actually not so bad. fish fillets are soft and easy to consume. \n\nMy friends that have had authentic northern china cuisine were very impressed with the noodles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-09", "description": "Over a year ago, our local paper published an article about the recent trend of Shanxi cuisine and foods from Xian.  Scattered mostly in the neighborhoods of the Richmond and Sunset Districts, there are several to choose from.  Of them, this seems to be the most popular.\nOn a late summer weeknight evening, my 808 Yelp friend Peter C. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=guwRwwQLPJ2ie_7YNfHMmA) from the 808 happened to contact me about putting together a dinner; Al L. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A) was another partner in crime as well as two other friends.  The aforementioned two were the first to arrive but they could not be seated until our full party of five arrived.  We were seated near the front on the right side on a decent sized table.  Being the first time for all of us, I suggested that everyone pick one dish and we order small appetizers and small plates to share.  This is how and why large party meals are a better gauge of a restaurant's cuisine and skills as we were able to try a number of dishes family style.  Given the number of dishes we ordered, here's my summary:\n\nThe highlights:\na) Braised chicken with potato and pepper, small (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=O5bZIuyl3CI4rFkF6z-YDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Hearty portions and very deceiving.  The flavors were strong, different, and mouth pleasing though not the most particularly photogenic dish.  Our waiter recommended this so compliments to him on this one. \n\nb) Three-in-one Biangbiang noodles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9-hpmTBgeMOUze1rt08SRA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was pleasing to the eye and I enjoyed this noodle dish the most among the three that we ordered.  Again, the variety of flavors was what struck me the most.  Menu states that all noodle dishes are made from hand pulled noodles which is nice to know if true for this dish.\n\nc) Celeries with dried bean curd sticks (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qRorzR4rQjM_wo8cfRSADg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very simple dish but good cold dish to open ones palate.  The sesame oil and light seasoning was a nice contrast to our other heavy sauced dishes.\n\n\nThe not-so-much:\nd) Fried bean paste noodles (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tTM8PWlTaHuOnVJ3efm6DA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Also known as Jia Jiang Mien, this was okay as I've had better elsewhere.  Nothing particularly wrong as it just didn't shine.  Perhaps the thick sauce and starchy (almost udon texture) noodles made this a bit one toned.  \n\ne) Burgers (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qYSbjDA-ZGf47-JT7I83SQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The pictured egg and hot pepper one was actually my favorite.  We also tried the cumin lamb burger and the Chinese burger with pork, cutting them each six ways so everyone could get a bite.   \n\nOverall, this was a fun and interesting dinner, given that many of us hadn't seen each other in quite a while.  I could not photograph all of our menu selections as the kitchen cranked out food before we could finish plates, giving us a bit of pressure to consolidate dishes and unfinished food to make room.  Unfortunately, like many Chinese restaurants, Terra Cotta is more worried about turning tables over than the diners' experiences.  As our meal continued, the dining room filled and, by the time we left, there was a small crowd waiting for their names to be read from a sign-up list.\nOn the plus side, our waiter was honest and accurate in steering us towards the braised chicken and limiting our dishes.  We finished most of the food with just small portions to spare.  The menu is helpful with the \"star\" system which indicates their more popular dishes, many of which we tried.  Water glasses and tea pots were filled as needed.  \nAs we made our way through the waiting diners around 8:30 pm, a car stopped in front dropping off four other potential customers.  \nWouldn't recommend this for my family's palate, but for a younger demographic who wants to experience pretty genuine regional Chinese cuisine, you'd find this more interesting.  \nMight come back to try some of their noodle soups during the winter months which are just around the corner now.", "author": "Mike C."}

Another fine installment in the Bay Area tour of restaurants that thrive entirely off giving a mostly Chinese clientele a pure, unmolested version of an unapologetically Chinese cuisine, and another place I can go to feel like I've flown back to China. A few palefaces mixed in here or there, but every one of them is down, and there's not a walnut prawn in sight. The one pro tip is get here early and mind the weekend hours, as they really do aim to close by 2:30 pm. Not that they ran us out, but they do run fairly close to their announced schedule. I'll have to be back to confirm the delectability of the widely praised hand-pulled noodles. Meanwhile what I did order was wonderful, and the calorie-per-dollar ratio embraces the straightforward efficient hedonism I love. I especially enjoyed the Shaanxi mian-pi with sesame sauce. Do that one, even if it means doubling up on noodles. These are destination noodles and there's no reason not to get your fill.

The prices are what I'm used to, and pretty great for a San Francisco-based restaurant. \n\nThe wait was incredibly frustrating and the reason I knocked off a star. We were a party of 5 but wrote 4+1 because we had a small child with us. Given the small space, most tables could only seat 2-4. There were about 5 groups after us, and they all got to go in before we did. Then when a table that looked big enough to seat us opened up, one of the servers called my name, asked who our +1 was, and then told us \"wait\" (like we hadn't been doing that already) and seated another 4-person group. It ended up being about an hour-long wait while we watched other tables beadily.\n\nOnce we got seated, the experience was a lot better. Our food arrived within minutes, and we would clear each plate in seconds. The mian pi is cool and slippery, and I think it was made with garlic oil. We also ordered the pita and lamb soup. I've had this at other places, and I always thought the pita was really gross, but I loved this dish. The soup was so flavorful, the lamb tender, and the pita was soaked with flavor. The lamb sandwich was really oily and got all over our fingers, but once again, so good! We were worried that we didn't have enough to eat because of the small size of the dishes, but the chicken plate was huge and loaded with tender chicken, soft potatoes, and saucy noodles. We ended up having to take leftover chicken home. \n\nService was good, excluding the seating issues in the beginning. Our waiter was good with responding quickly to our requests, which is more than I can say for most Chinese restaurants. \n\nAnd now my mouth is watering again.", "author": "Sophie W."}

But I am a sucker for their lamb burgers and those damn delicious noodles. It's like being in an abusive relationship that you can't get out, instead of being with a person, it's with an restaurant...\n\nThe service wasn't always this bad when I first stared going there 3 years ago. It's horrible now by any standard. I'm sure they know what they are doing, they do it because they can get away with it. Came here as a group of six last time, they refused to make certain dishes and didn't properly explain why. Very pushy about ordering as soon as you sit down. They didn't allow to order more food after the initial order. What? I'm trying to give you more money!", "author": "Hao L."}

You read my mind Yelp. \n\nYou know its authentic when:\n-the people who actually cook the food speak the language\n-the tables are stickier than glue\n-you can smell the food a block down \n\n::FOOD::\n**FYI, Im no expert in Xi'an food, in fact it's my first time so I prob dont know much**\nPita Bread soaked in lamb soup 9.25: i didnt quite grasp the concept of this dish. it was literally a big bowl of soup with mochi texture balls and small pieces of lamb scattered throughout the bowl with tiny thin strands of clear vermicelli noodles. I dont like lamb, and it was boiled so much it was soft and melt in your mouth texture. There was absolutely no grimey-ness to it at all which was good. But nothing too special. In fact the bowl was 75% the mochi balls. I didnt quite understand pita bread part? \nQishan minced pork noodle soup 8.95: I choked every 10 seconds I was eating this. Don't get me wrong. it was GOOD but it was so spicy it caught me by surprise. This was super flavorful with the thick noodles. I know it said MINCED pork, but I wish.... it was bigger haha. It was the size of a lady bug. I like my meat so it would have been nice to actually have a bite of it with my noodles. Other than that, pretty bold flavors with a lot of spice so BEWARE non-spicy eaters like me. \n\n::Service/Atmosphere/Parking::\nService was decent. One of the waiters noticed we were struggling with the never ending noodles and gave us a pair of scissors after we fought them noodles for 3 minutes. THANK YOU. All the other ones were quite emotionless. \nWe came on a Thursday around 7:30pm and we were seated within 10 minutes. \nAtmosphere was pretty loud like any other restaurant. Tables were definitely sticky. Did not want to touch it at all hahaha. \nParking sucks ofc, since its in the sunset area. But we managed to find residential parking 1 block away.\n\nYes, the price seems a bit high. But it's SF (so sad that this is the excuse for everything now). The portions were pretty big. My friend and I could not finish the food. But it was probably because both were soup based so we got full quick too.", "author": "Chena N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-11", "description": "I'm generally skeptical of Chinese food in the Bay Area as it's usually not very authentic, so when a restaurant has a touristy name, I'm even more wary. That being said, I thought the food at Terra Cotta Warrior was very good. I would give it 4 stars but it wasn't exactly all Shaanxi cuisine, so I downgraded by one to 3 stars.\n\nMust Haves:\n\n1. Mianpi: this in my opinion is the most authentic. It's spicy but on the refreshing side, so it's a great appetizer. I like that there are little bits of bread soaked in the sauce.\n\n2. Tofu skin and celery: this is a cold dish that is not spicy, but it'll save you from all the other spicy dishes. This is a very homey dish that only Chinese people know to order, so if you want an authentic experience, get this.\n\n3. Spicy pork or lamb cumin sandwich: these are the two best ones, don't get the regular pork. Very flavorful but very spicy as well, so beware!\n\nOther good dishes:\n\n4. Spicy lung and tendon: this is a Sichuan dish, but one of my favorites. Very numbing spicy, so beware. But it's really good. My friend described it as a spicy bacon, so I guess that's a good thing, huh?\n\n5. Spicy chicken in gravy: not sure what this is one the menu, but it's basically the most expensive dish there is (and even then it's only $21). It's humongous, so only order this if you're 4+ people. It's basically a slightly sweet and very spicy chicken dish in a gravy-ish sauce, served over hand pulled noodles. It's really good, very hearty and delicious.\n\nPrices are very reasonable here. If you're in a group, you'll average maybe $25 here  for each person, which is such a steal considering you'll pay more for less authentic Chinese food elsewhere.", "author": "Sherry L."}

This being early 2000s China, made it seemed even more scandalous. I did benefit from this, because I had a very nice tour guide, who was his Xi'an girlfriend: she took me everywhere and introduced me to Chinese muslim food. I hung out at Xi'An's muslim quarter and ate nothing but lamb soup with pita bread, or a variation of it. I had dumplings and buns, I had every kind of food that was made of flour and wheat. Then I ate more of that. That trip impressed me so much so that I've been on a hunt for that special brand of pita bread in lamb soup everywhere. That hunt was unsuccessful until I read about Terra Cotta Warrior's opening. One time we were riding the N Judah line to the beach and I saw the line out of the door at this place, this made me wanting to come here more. We drove over here one evening after dark for a pre Chinese New Year meal.\n\nThe cold dishes, especially jelly fish salad was quite delicious, so was the cucumber dish and mini burger style buns. Just as I had remembered but way better ingredients than what you'd find in China in general. The main thing to get is \u7f8a\u8089\u6ce1\u998d, aka Paomo, wiki it and you get the gist of this dish: levin bread crumbs soaked in lamb stew. It reminds me a bit of Irish lamb stew, actually, but the pita bread in small pieces reminded me nothing of Irish, only that it's also not stereotypical Chinese, it's Chinese muslim from Shaanxi region.\n\nLegend has it, once the Song emperor was down and out, and his people fetched him some soup and he soaked his hardened bread into it, and made do. When he was the emperor of China, he became reminiscent of his humble past and made this a national dish of a sort. \n\nFor me, the best part was to order in my flawless Pekingese mandarin, communicate to the staff without missing a beat, get the dishes I'd get in China, and watch my (white) companion say, \"This does not taste like Chinese food.\" It was a great opening for me to tell him the story I just told you.  \n\nMy cousin eventually got married. He did not marry his Xi'An girlfriend. I was saddened by that, because that girl was the best Xi'An tour guide I'd ever had.  I don't know if I'd return to Xi'an anytime soon. So for the time being, I shall take any person who's been to Xi'an, who's not good at speaking Chinese, to this restaurant, 1. to show off; 2. to eat what I like to eat; 3. to retell a story of a happier, simpler life back when I was traveling through China.", "author": "Victoria E."}

My girl friend is picky for food and likes selecting the dishes after closely looking through the menus, so we asked for more minutes. About two minutes later, the waitress came again. We asked could we order some first, adding some later. But the waitress refused claiming there were too many people waiting. So we said we still need some time, then she went away sulkly. After after that, there came another guy who seemed to be the waitress's superior, asking if we could place the order and told us to be quick. We said OK, we were ready. Then, that guy went away and we were left there for about ten minutes! We waved to the waitress and they just told us to wait. \nThe food is not good neither.

I remember a friend once telling me that he judges his Chinese restaurants by how badly they violate health regulations. Seems like this place gets a lot of flack for not meeting health regulations/having bad service--I was fortunate enough to not have to experience either of those things when I went.\n\nA friend and I came for an early dinner on a Sunday night. When we arrived, the place was pretty empty (around 5pm), but once we left around 6pm, a line was already going out the door. For a pretty isolated restaurant, it gets quite a bit of business for the right reasons.\n\nTerra Cotta Warrior has a few stand out dishes that other Yelpers have also mentioned. They have the Shanxi mian pi which is a typical Shanxi dish and a minced pork noodle soup that I absolutely loved. The noodles are made in-house and SO good. The soup is basically the best sweet and sour soup that I've ever had with some amazingly chewy and flavorful noodles. My friend and I also got the dried bean curd appetizer.\n\nShanxi mian pi--I liked this though I found it to be very spicy and on the drier side of spicy. I'm not an expert in Shanxi food, but I thought this was decently good\n\nMinced pork noodle soup--YES. This is really what hits the 5-star mark for me. This bowl of noodles is fantastic. Don't let all the red scare you--it's actually not that spicy, but the noodles are sooo good. It also comes in a gigantically large bowl, so you're better off ordering one and sharing with a friend rather than just getting one for yourself. Seriously, the portion is absurd.\n\nDried bean curd--good, but it felt like they put way too much pepper into the thing.\n\nService was pretty good for us even though I spoke in English. I always find that speaking in Chinese at Chinese restaurants gets you better service, but didn't quite feel like it that day. They were great at taking our order and addressing needs like grabbing more tea or water. The food also comes out just as quickly as food comes out in China--literally in minutes. It felt like we had just put in our order before food came right out.\n\nFinal bill was $23 for two. Credit card minimum is $25.

Plus overall, I enjoyed the food, and the service was prompt and courteous. \n\nWe tried the scallion oil chicken, the cumin lamb burger, the mian pi with sesame sauce, and the lamb noodle soup. \n\nScallion oil chicken: good flavor, but there was too much oil on the plate - it kind of drowned the chicken near the end. The portion was small, but at 4.95 to be expected.\n\nCumin lamb burger: probably my favorite! Great flavor in the filling, and the texture of the bread was a great complement. One qualm was that the filling was too oily (sensing a pattern?), and the oil soaked through the bottom bun, making things a bit messy. Reduce the oil and this is an absolute winner.\n\nMian pi with sesame sauce - didn't really enjoy. Ok, so I'm comparing this to the mian pi I once had at a Lanzhou themed restaurant in Beijing, but first and foremost, I think it would be vastly improved if the chili oil and sesame sauce were served in little dishes on the side so you can customize your flavors. The sesame sauce also seemed really clumpy, not smooth and easily mixed like I was expecting. Finally, the noodle was a bit softer and stickier than I was expecting - not a huge deal, but not really what I was looking for texturally.\n\nLamb noodle soup: highly recommend! There were tender slices of lamb, handmade noodles with great texture, and a really flavorful broth. Other components were a bit of bok choy, and leeks and cilantro for garnish. I would definitely get this again as well.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of the flavors, and I like their variety of noodles and breads - they definitely fill a niche in Chinese cuisine in the area that isn't really present.

They don't take reservations, so everyone has to write their name on a notepad when they come in, and the restaurant will call your name once they are ready. There isn't much else around the area, except a liquor store and an ice cream shop, so you'll most likely be standing in the restaurant waiting for your name to be called, and that could take a while. We had to wait about 45 min. \n\nThe interior is nothing fancy. It looks like your classic Chinese restaurant, with some Asian decor on the walls. Which is fine, because everyone comes here for the food! Not the decor. They serve complimentary tea when you sit down. And the food was pretty outstanding. However, they were out of ALL of the Shaanxi mian-pi dishes...which was the main reason we came to their restaurant. So that was a bummer, but there is always next time. We ordered: \n\n- Pork with hot pepper burger: The bread was like a fluffy naan with a perfect crunch on the outside. The pork was shredded and cooked in a delicious, rich spicy sauce. Great for 2 people to share.\n- Qishan minced pork noodles: This was my favorite dish of the night. The noodles were silky and you can tell they were handmade. The pork was a great addition to the dish. And the broth that the noodles were in had a red color. It tasted spicy and smoky and just had incredible flavor. The dish was very big, it could probably serve 2-3 people.\n- Noodles with sizzling oil: This was also a very large dish. My husband and I could only finish half of it. The noodles were very thick and dense, and tasted amazing. It didn't have much sizzling oil though, so that part was confusing. The noodles were mostly tossed with spices. We took some of our broth from the Qishan minced pork noodles dish and put it on top of these noodles which made it taste better.\n\nOverall the food was great. I definitely want to come back and try the Shaanxi mian-pi dishes since that's what everyone raves about. The service was the only disappointment. The entire staff was not friendly or welcoming. They all move very quick and are in a hurry. I feel that their mission is to turn tables as fast as possible. I think their mindset is \"get in, sit down, eat, get out.\" We only saw our server twice. Once to take our order, and once to give us our bill.

They asked us if we wanted to be seated immediately at the bar, and we agreed. However, it was extremely cramped, with other customers' chairs in our way. One of the servers saw our situation and offered us the small table reserved for the takeout orders! It was much more comfortable and roomy. \n\nWe ordered the garlic pigs' ears ($6.25), noodles with sliced beef ($9.95), and Shanghai stir-fry wide noodles, non-spicy ($9.95). The garlic pigs' ears came first as our cold appetizer. Even though it's labeled spicy on the menu, I didn't taste any spiciness, (coming from someone who cannot handle spiciness at all). Half the dish was thinly sliced cucumbers and the other half was the pigs' ears. It was my first time having it, and I found the pigs' ears' texture pretty interesting. It was slightly crunchy, but also chewy, definitely an acquired taste.\n\nThe noodles with sliced beef also delicious. It was a soup noodle with beef slices, cilantro, green onions, and bamboo shoots. The beef slices were cooked just right, not too rare and not too dry and overcooked. But the hand-pulled noodles were the highlight. They were chewy and thick and irregular. Fun to eat and complemented the soup.\n\nThe Shanghai stir-fry was also excellent. We asked for them to make it non-spicy. It had a unique taste: sour and tomato-y. In it was chicken, ginger, and onions. (Beware the little slices of ginger! It has quite the intense flavor.)

There's a clipboard with a list by the hostess table for you to put your name. We only waited ~10 mins. on a Saturday evening for our group of 4. Service was a little slow to begin but we got our food pretty quickly after placing our orders.\n\nThere are oodles of noodle choices here and they are all super delicious. I highly recommend getting any of the NOODLE SOUP dishes and you won't be disappointed, especially on a cool SF day! If you're like me and enjoy lamb hot pot, then I would go with any of the noodle soups that have a lamb soup base--they're very flavorful and don't skimp on the meat or noodles. Each bowl can easily be split between two people! \n\nI also liked the SHAANXI MIANPI for a mix of cool and spicy in your mouth. This makes a great appetizer to share or as a small entree for yourself. In addition, I ordered a LAMB BURGER because I missed getting these in Shanghai. It had a good amount of spice but the meat was a bit tough; I had better ones in Chinatown NY. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable (appetizers ~$4-8, entrees ~$8-10) and the portions are large.

I haven't had such good noodles since my last Japan trip! These noodles reminded me of the best udon noodles I've had. Sure the noodles are a bit oily, but that's much of the dishes from that area in China... Spicy with powerful flavors, you add salt and soy sauce to balance that out. So knowing that, I didn't think this was too salty because the salt really did help balance out the spiciness, and you can add some table vinegar to taste. \n\nI also tried their pita bread soaked in lamb soup. The lamb soup had good flavor. The 'pita bread' was more like a hand-cut noodle type texture but cut into small cubes. There were also mung bean noodles in that so overall it was an interesting dish with various textures. \n\nWould definitely come back for the noodles in sizzling oil and to try other dishes!

I thought all of the food was pretty good but I'd skip out on the lamb and the stir-fry noodles next time as the lamb had too much cumin and the stir-fry noodles were a bit generic. All of us came out quite full at close to 20 dollars each but we probably overate. \n\nSome of the and across the board the food definitely had more than just a modest amount of oil. Maybe you can ask for the amount of oil to be toned down a notch but I don't know how reliant the taste of the food is on the amount of oil they use.\n\nOne of my friends that I was with claimed that this was some of the closest food to authentic Shan Xi/Xi'An food he's had since he left New York and would take his parents here if.

Everything had the perfect balance of salt and spices.  Plus, the cook on everything was excellent - nothing was over- or under-cooked, nothing was oily (beyond expected chili oil \"topping\") or fatty, etc.  We actually didn't really love the Qishan minced pork noodles despite thehype - thought they were kind of bland and had too much potato (weirdly...) - and we definitely didn't love the noodles with lamb - that was the MOST flavorless thing.

There's three main categories: cold dishes, hot dishes, and specialties. Prices range from $5-$15 per dish, which I think is pretty good.\n\nWe ordered the cumin lamb, noodles with sizzling oil, and the hot and sour soup with pork dumplings. Portions are pretty big -- the three dishes we ordered could've easily fed 4 people instead of just us two. \n\nCumin lamb - Spicy, which I love, but was a bit too much for the bf. It comes with a ton of jalapeno slices and red chili slices. You can definitely taste the cumin, and for some reason, it also reminds me of the Taco Bell taco mix you can buy in grocery stores. Overall, very good.\nNoodles with sizzling oil - Not spicy, and a bit plain in flavor. Definitely very oily haha. It also smells sour like vinegar, but you can barely taste it. It comes with a few veggies and bean sprouts. I loved the wide, flat noodles (likely handmade), but wish the dish had a bit more flavor.\nHot and sour soup with pork dumplings - Our favorite dish! The soup is definitely very sour, but very good. It is not spicy so no worries on that for people who can't handle the heat.

Located near Outer Sunset, it's a small Chinese restaurant on Judah Street.\n\nI've never had Shan Xi food before, so I was pretty stoked to try it. Since the place is small, you may have to wait in line if you come on a weekend, but luckily my friend and I got in after 5 minutes. I have to comment on the ambiance first because the atmosphere was just right! There are beautiful paintings and pictures of Terra Cotta Warriors on the wall, interesting music playing, and lovely tables to dine on.\n\nWith a simple menu, we knew exactly what we wanted to order. We got the noodles with spicy oil, jellyfish, and twice cooked pork.\n\nFirst, the noodles were AMAZING. Who knew that such a simple dish would taste so good. I will definitely try to replicate this spicy dish at home- it seems like the key ingredient is the type of spicy oil they use (it kind of reminds me of Din Tai Fung's). Next, the jellyfish was pretty good and coated with an interesting sour, vinegar- like sauce. It was a bit too sour for me, but the jellyfish was bomb.\n\nThe last item we got was the twice cooked pork. The pork itself was very tender and the chili/black bean sauce was good, but there was a weird, salty aftertaste that lingered in my mouth. I kind of didn't like this aftertaste but at least the noodles made up for it.\n\nAll in all, I had a good time at Terra Cotta. When I come back Im going to splurge on the big plate chicken and the lamb buns. I will definitely come again someday because of the atmosphere and the noodles!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-12", "description": "First time here, and we were unfamiliar with this kind of food. \n\nThe food that I could eat was tasty. We tried:\n+ Chicken with scallion oil: a cold dish, mostly just finely chopped white meat, very moist, tender, and salty. Very little scallion oil. A very delicate dish tasting of salty chicken.\n+ Shaanxi mian pi: Very good. Fresh noodles, loved the chewy texture, in a nice chili oil sauce, served cold with julienne-cut cucumber. Didn't know this was a cold dish, since it was not listed under cold dishes but under the house specialties. \n+ Lamb with cumin: This smelled great - lamb + lots of cumin. Unfortunately, I could not eat it because it contains red bell peppers, an ingredient that was not listed on the menu and to which I have a life-threatening allergy. \n+ Shredded potatoes: Another cold dish, and another dish containing red bell peppers, so I couldn't eat this one, either. My dinner partner said it was excellent.\n\nPortions of the things we ordered were about right for 2 people, but since I couldn't eat 2 of the dishes, my dining partner has leftovers for tomorrow. And I came home and ate a cheese sandwich.\n\nDrinks: I ordered the canned herbal tea, but they didn't have any, so we drank beer. After the female server who wears glasses informed me that there was no canned herbal tea, she did not ask if I would like anything else, but left our table. It took a couple of tries to get her attention so I could order a beer. Meanwhile, we had eaten half of our (spicy) food. The free tea: well, you get what you pay for. Very weak tea.\n\nAmbiance: Nice decor, not too noisy, but not a place to linger. It's about the food. Eat, pay and get out, so they can turn the tables several times a night. \n\nService: We live in the neighborhood, so we called to ask about the wait. We were told there was no wait. When we arrived, maybe 10 min. later, there were several parties waiting for tables. We waited maybe 10 min., so not too bad. We might have had a shorter wait, but the female server who wears glasses skipped over us to seat another party of 2 - and I was standing right in front of her! There was a method to her madness though...read on. \n\nGlasses-wearing female: rude, abrupt, never smiles, seems very stressed out. In her defense, it seems that she is having to do 2 jobs in a very busy restaurant: the hostess function, plus waiting tables. I sure hope she's an owner; otherwise, she is being overworked. If she is an owner, she needs to hire another server, relax, and develop a more service-oriented persona. Or, maybe, if the food is good and reasonably priced, no one cares about the service. Except me.\n\nA word to people on the wait list: periodically she would yell out the names of several parties on the list. But actually, they had no empty tables for these patrons at that time; she was just \"taking attendance.\" If the patron did not speak up, she crossed their names off the list. She did not check outside, where some people had gone to wait because the front space was already full of people waiting. \n\nAnother odd thing happened wrt the service. We (2 white people) were next on the list. She went 4 parties down the wait list, past several other parties of 2, to the next white couple, and told them that they would have to share a table. She never said anything to us about sharing a table. But she sat us and this other white couple at the same table. The asian parties of 2 that she had skipped over were then seated at tables for 2 as those became available.\n\nSo, in summary: excellent food, half of which I could not eat; abrupt, unpleasant service with a soup\u00e7on of racism. Will I return? Not likely.", "author": "Deb L."}

We were seated at a large table near the back and had 4 dishes between 3 people. We started with a cucumber salad, which is never a bad choice because it was garlicky and refreshing with all the spicy hot dishes we ordered that came soon after. Shaanxi stir-fried wide noodles was next and is my favorite out of everything we ordered - loved the noodle size with the onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and pork! Enough flavor and not too oily like most asian dishes. We also had the braised spicy fish (spicy sauce) but the fish was good with a bit of crispy and spice to it. The Qishan pork noodle soup was my least favorite because it was too vinegar-y that lacked flavor all around. Also, the pork burger didn't wow me. Would return for the stir-fry noodles though!

After my friend was placing a pick up order, I decided to also try it for my first time. I ordered 2 dishes, twice cooked pork and their famous thick noodles with beef. \nThe noodles were pretty flavorful compared to other restaurant that serve hand made thick noodles, but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. The quality of meat they give was very sad. Mostly was just the noodles and a few slices of beef. I mean for a 10$ item at least have more than 5 slices. That was disappointing...\nMy twice cooked pork was 13$... I've never seen it to be that expensive, usually it's never more than 9-10$... yet again the quality was even less than the noodles. Very disappointing, mostly just cabbage, very few slices of pork and 1/3 of the to-go box was filled with oil... not very appetizing and definitely not worth 13$! \nI wouldn't go here again unless someone wants to try it, wouldn't be my first choice if I were to pick a restaurant let's just say.

Well, this is the closest thing you'll get here in SF, and lucky for you, it's really tasty!  \n\nIt was a cold and dreary day, and I wanted to eat something hot and spicy that would warm me up.  This place did the trick!  We walked in and were embraced with the fragrant smells of Chinese cooking.  This is a different kind of Chinese food than you'll normally get in SF.  Most places in SF serve up Cantonese food, but this little gem specializes in Shaanxi cuisine, which means lots of spices, chili, heavy use of lamb and mutton.  Strong, fragrant flavors.  Spicy flavors.  \n\nWe ordered the \"Chinese burger,\" which was basically pork in a bao, the noodles in sizzling oil, and the cumin lamb stir fry.  The \"burger\" was a bit on the salty side; I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way normally or if maybe they spilled extra salt into the dish.  I liked the texture of the pork, which seemed like it was braised, but the saltiness detracted from my enjoyment.  The other two dishes, however, were outstanding!  I'm not normally a lamb person, as I find it to be too pungent and gamey, but here they cooked it in such a way that it didn't have that strong gaminess.  Rather, it was tender, delicious, and perfect over a bowl of white rice (necessary! Do get white rice!).  It also wasn't super spicy, which for a weakling like me, was appreciated.  It had just enough spice to give it a good kick, but not so much that it interferes with the taste.  My favorite dish was the noodles in sizzling oil.  The noodles had such great texture!  Each bite was hearty and chewy, such great bite!  They must have been hand-pulled noodles, I don't know how else you can get that kinda bite.  I was also concerned it would be too spicy, but it was only moderately so, and the spice only worked to enhance the flavors.  I loved this dish!\n\nI would recommend this place and would be happy to come back again and try the other dishes!  It's always nice to try something different once in a while, and I'm glad Terra Cotta Warrior exists to fill that niche!", "author": "Vivian C."}

I was so excited my mouth was watering during the drive there thinking about what I was going to eat.\n\nGot there, it was in a pretty dead-ish neighborhood but it looked busy inside. The waitress asked my +1 and me if we would be willing to share a big table with another party of 2. We were fine with that so we got seated right away. The interior decor looked nice and very fitting with the name of the restaurant. We ordered the Qi Shan Minced Pork noodle, the lamb with cumin, and Shaanxi stir fried wide noodles. The prices are very reasonable, and it all sounded so good. \n\nThe lamb and stir fry noodle came out first. The lamb was actually pretty good, although I do with the lamb pieces weren't so broken up. It was hard to pick up the meat with chopsticks at times. The sauce of the stir fried noodles was sort of meh to me. It kind of tasted like BBQ sauce mixed with the szechuan style sauce. Maybe it's just a flavor I'm not used to? Either way my taste buds weren't the most satisfied. But, the quality of the noodles was really good! You can really tell it was handmade. Really liked the chewy noodles :) \nI think they forgot about my minced pork noodle soup because the waiter looked shocked when I said I was still waiting for it. So.. by the time that came I was already a bit full from eating the lamb and stir fry. Similar to the stir fry noodle sauce, the soup flavor just didn't vibe with me. It was too sour for me.

Yay!\n\nWe ordered the Shaanxi Mianpi, the pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup, the spicy pork burgers, and the minced pork soup. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the Shaanxi Mianpi which I highly recommend. The noodles are delicious and cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce was really what made it stand out, a bit tart and tangy, I think there's vinegar. It's also cold and refreshing. A great appetizer. The burger was also very good. The spicy pork itself wasn't that spicy but they place a lot of sliced peppers in it, a lot of it fell out when I bit into it. But the pork was very flavorful. I wasn't that big of a fan of the pita bread in the lamb soup. It wasn't like pita bread at all. It was more like dough and they give A LOT of it, which soaks up all the soup. It didn't have much flavor and it's soft mushy and chewy. But everything else in the soup was delicious, just wasn't a fan of the pita bread. The minced pork soup I liked way better. The soup was more flavorful and I loved the noodles it came with.\n\nPrices are cheap too. We paid about $28 for 4 dishes.\n\nThe decor was also very nice.

Not very crowded but the place was packed by the time we left. I liked the decor of the restaurant, not overstated and more contemporary feeling than most Chinese restaurants. We loved it and will be going back. Based on reports here I told the server we liked very spicy food. Except for the Ma Po Tofu, the food seemed free of the overload of MSG you get at many Chinese restaurants in the US. Husband mentioned the food had a Silk Road feel and I agree. The prices were very affordable especially considering the high quality of the food. Here is what we ate:\n\nPork with hot pepper burger. Burgers are meh to me. But this burger I LOVED. This was my favorite dish. The pork itself was sweet and contrasted nicely with the sharp spicy jalape\u00f1os. The toothsome bread was the perfect vehicle.\n\nThe cumin lamb burger. This was good but not as good as the pork one we had. My husband said he had a better version (more crispy lamb) at the restaurant he went to in NY.\n\nShaanxi Mian-Pi. I have never had a dish like this. We really enjoyed this. The noodles were toothsome and spicy with a satisfying sourness.\n\nPita Bread Soaked In Lamb Soup.  Really homey, comforting and tasty. This soup was permeated with an intense satisfying lamb flavor. The pieces of bread were almost like tiny dumplings and together with the mung bean noodles they added a satisfying texture to the dish. Very different, very good. Great food can make you feel like you are transported to a different location. This dish made us feel like we were transported to some exotic destination on the Silk Road.\n\nMa Po tofu. We got this because I love Ma Po Tofu and I am always curious to try different versions. This version was very good. The only element it lacked was that there was not enough Sichuan pepper. A bit more Ma La would have knocked it out of the park.", "author": "George T."}

Great place for larger parties, because each dish is relatively cheap so you can order a variety to share! Service, however, is kinda slow and inefficient, hah. \n\nWe split the following: \n(1) Jellyfish in mixed sauce-  sooo gooooood. Good portion for $4.95. The jellyfish is fresh and crunchy, and the sauce is a light spicy vinaigrette. Very similar to the jellyfish dishes you get at dim sum. Definitely recommend and would order again. \n\n(2) Lamb soup with \"pita\" on the side - the broth is yummy! Some other reviewers noted that it was \"bland\", but I thought it was a refreshing addition to the meal. It's not overly oily nor salty, and has a natural gamey taste from the lamb. However, there was very little lamb and the glass noodles were just okay. \n\nI'm also still intrigued by why they call the bread a 'pita'. It's shaped like a pita, but looks more like a thick, flattened out dough. Honestly, I was not that impressed by the grease-rubbed 'pita' and did not think it really enhanced the overall dish at all. \n\nProbably would not order again because of the sad portion of lamb... \n\n(3) Shaanxi Mian-pi- this was my bf's fave because the noodles were chewy with good flavor. It's slightly spicy.\n\n(4) Hamburger with beef - the meat reminded me of Chipotle's carne asada. The \"hamburger buns\" are actually \"pita\" breads. Kinda fun to try for the first time, but would not order this again.", "author": "Samantha C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-13", "description": "SUMMARY:  Sauces are decent, but the ingredients need to be higher quality to get the full fabulous flavor of Shaanxi cuisine. The steamed bread, tofu, and noodles just weren't as flavorful as they are in Shaanxi. Don't substitute American white vinegar, when you need special vinegars from China. I enjoyed my two spiciest snacks the most: the mianpi (cold noodle) and the cai jiamo (veg burger). \n\n- liangpi (cold noodle with spicy oil etc.):  not bad but not great. rather small.\n- tudousi (potato strips): too expensive! didn't order them\n- cai jiamou (vegetable burger): excellent - perfectly seasoned vegetable, savory sauce, in a traditional steamed bread mit. yum!\n- liancai (lotus): too sweet, strange (American?!) vinegar. failure. \n- spicy tofu: good sauce, meh tofu. so-so\n\nDETAIL:  It's wonderful to be able to order liangpi with numb/spicy - but as liangpi goes (for someone who has eaten authentic liangpi in Xi'an for years), the liangpi here is just so-so. Not quite flavorful or plentiful enough. And I didn't order the tudousi, because they're now $11 which is outrageous! The spicy tofu was pretty good, but needs to be made bite-sized. The lotus was a failure: too sweet, strange white vinegar (American white vinegar or what??), no seasoning. Again, I'm thrilled to find attempts at authentic Xi'an cuisine -- I think they need to ask customers: \"Do you want authentic, or less spicy / less garlic?\" I prefer the real northwest and western Chinese cuisine best! Don't water it down for me. Keep all the spice. I heard the people at the table beside mine asking whether dishes could be done without the spiciness. Not really! If you want bland food, you'll need to visit an authentic Shanghai restaurant, in my experience (of Shanghai and American Shanghainese cuisine). Keep trying -- I know you can earn 5 stars.

I'd just come back from NYC, where I almost ALWAYS pay a visit to Xi An Famous Foods, so I was pretty stoked to see we had a xi an place of our own now. They did the decor really nicely (especially given that it's a Chinese restaurant, in the sunset). Smaller dishes around $4-5, noodles and soups around $8-9, super reasonable. I heard it gets pretty packed so we got there 30 mins after opening and got seated right away; as we ordered, ppl started to line up.\n\nThe jellyfish, a very standard Chinese dish, was good but very salty. The lamb \"burger\" was pretty dry (the bread is their \"pita\" and is super dry to begin with) but it can be helped with a healthy dose of chili sauce. The mian pi cold noodles was great -- I strongly recommend it. Shanxi minced pork noodles was one of their specialties, and it was definitely a great bowl of noodles.. huge and flavorful, but seriously where's the meat?\n\nWe also ran into apparently a pretty common problem here: unavailable menu items. We had ordered the pita bread soaked in spicy lamb soup dish, and then as we started getting our apps, the waitress said they were out of the spicy lamb soup but we can get the lamb soup... which was weird so I asked how that could be, and she said they didn't make the spice mix for that day. Okay.. fine.. just the normal lamb soup then. Then she comes back and tells me that they're out of that version, we can't get the pita bread soaked in lamb soup, just pita bread on the side. What? Is there a special skill involved? At that point, we were just like fine, just bring whatever. So it was just those 2 very dry pita bread (kinda like mantou) on the side of lamb soup. PS the soup is delish, but the meat is kinda dry.\n\nSo the food is decent, the noodles are pretty great, and I wouldn't mind going back, but it does feel pretty inconsistent, and it's very frustrating not knowing what the kitchen's gonna feel like serving you that day...", "author": "Vivian H."}

You are not going to get chow mein and kung pao chicken. Terra Cotta Warrior serves food from the Shaanxi region of China. It is very spicy and uses a lot of of wide noodles. I've eaten there twice and loved it both times.\n\nI have tried the cucumber salad, jellyfish in mixed sauce, stir-fried lamb with cumin, braised chicken with potato and pepper, Shaanxi braised spicy fish, pita bread soaked in lamb soup, Chinese burger with pork, and the Shaanxi mian-pi.\n\nOf those, everything was spicy except the cucumber salad (which is small,) the jellyfish (also a small dish,) the Chinese burger with pork, and the pita bread soaked in lamb soup. \n\nThe first time I went we ordered carry-out, which was very easy. The second time we ate in. They brought the soup out last which I didn't entirely understand, but after eating the soup after eating everything else, I think it makes the most sense. The soup is not spicy. After eating some of everything, my mouth was on fire (in the best of ways.) The soup really helped mild that out, with the delicious comforting tastes of the lamb with the square chunks of pita in it (which hardly seem like bread and seem way more like a noodle.) The soup was an excellent way to end the meal.\n\nThey do not take dinner reservations. The restaurant is small. You must have time to wait to get seated.

Despite it being late, the restaurant was pretty full. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is really nice and classy, definitely not what you expect of a Chinese restaurant. The service was a little slow though.

It also came with a ton of vegetables which I appreciated.\n\nPITA BREAD IN LAMB SOUP:\nReally wanted to like this but really hated it. The pita bread tasted gross like croutons left sitting in a salad for far too long. The soup was also really bland, if you are a lamb lover, you might be disappointed by the lack of taste. The lamb was also overcooked and not well seasoned. Overall a very meh dish, unflavorful, with uninteresting textures. PASS.\n\nNOODLES WITH SIZZLING OIL:\nThis is why I came here to begin with! I love biang biang mian and this looked like the next best alternative. Overall, it wasn't a terrible dish, but it wasn't a stand out either, the noodles did taste a little soggy, and not as bouncy as I would have liked.

Disappointing, maybe I should have gone for the mianpi instead.\n\nAll in all, I can't complain as the dishes were cheap and generous in portions, unfortunately, I was unimpressed by the taste of food here.

WRONG!  Luckily, we got seated right away and when it came time to order, certain items were already \"sold out\" for the night.    Mind you, this was only 30 minutes after they opened for dinner service for a night that only had 3 other tables beside us!  However, the only thing we really wanted...their homemade wide noodles...our waitress assured us that it was available.  She even told us she prefers the wide noodles over the thin ones.  Overly excited, we finally thought we found a place close to home that serves comparable noodles to the ones we had in NYC so of course we ordered away.  Got a few different noodle dishes, some mixed with sesame sauce, another in sizzling oil, and the spicy pork one - thinking all the noodles will be different since we chose a mixture of both wide and thin.  We specifically asked our waitress for wide noodles in our soup dish and she assured us that it was not a problem.  Sadly, that was not the case.  Without even informing us that they had ran out of the wide noodles , they just brought out all of our dishes w/ the same type of thin noodles, just mixed in different sauces.  I'm all about noodles too and would choose that over rice any day, but when I have 3 dishes served with the same kind of noodles, it got boring fast.  Just wished someone had the courtesy to let us know, especially coming from 2 people who's eyes literally lit up when she told us they had the wide noodles.\n\nTaste wise, food was good, bold flavors packed with a lot of heat.  It's perfect for spicy food lovers but my mouth gave out after awhile.  Service was overall friendly, waitress took the time to explain the menu to us and offered some of her suggestions.

I waited for 40 minutes, so this translates to slower service. But that's understandable. I brought my parents with me and they just couldn't hang. I have never seen them chug so much water in one sitting. Just a big cup of NOPE for them. Their Southern Chinese palates couldn't handle the spice and sodium. But for me, I really enjoy strong flavors and can handle my spices. I'll be coming back to try the rest of the menu.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

Being LA transplants, we missed all the easily accessible and authentic Chinese food options we had before. We have been here twice, and both times loved everything that we ordered. In particular, we loved the spicy tangy-ness of the Qi Shan Minced Pork noodles and the cold dishes - especially the Fu Qi Fei Pian and tofu skin appetizers were great. We were also pleasantly surprised by the Cumin Lamb - the preparation was different than what we were used to, but the meat was very tender and the flavor profile was unbeatable.\n\nOther than the fact that getting a table is usually a 30 minute battle (even when we came after 9pm on a weekday night), nothing to complain about!", "author": "Angela D."}

For first two visits, I was pretty impressed by its big plate of chicken. It almost became the reason I want to visit SF again, and I always recommend this place to my friend who would visit SF. I would give it 5 stars if I didn't go there for a third time. However, it's a little disappointing this time, both food and service. \nThere was already a line when we got there by 6, but the wait wasn't too bad. We orders a small plate of chicken, spinach as cold dish, and pork burger to go. I didn't have pork burger this time, so not sure if it's as good as before. But the small plate of chicken was not as good as I remembered, with too much noodle and oil in it. Besides, one of the waitresses was pretty rude. We waited for twenty minutes with no dish came, even the cold dish as appetizer. So I asked her to take a look for us. She just told us to wait as there were three table's order before us. I can understand the main dish need to wait, but how about the appetizer!\nSo overall, 4 stars. I will try it again in future to see if it still worth 4 stars.", "author": "Zhe D."}

We came right on time to avoid the wait. The place is a little crowded although it is very clean. A female waitress came out to take out order and since we didn't have huge appetites we ordered three options and the waitress looked at me and asked \"that's it?\" I don't know why but this kind of caught me off guard. I'm not sure if she meant to be rude but at least for me it felt a little ride. So customer service wise - don't expect much. The waiters all seemed rushed which made me feel a little anxious the whole time. So our dishes came out one at a time and there were at least a 15 minute wait in between. Which made me feel full quicker - not sure if this is a good or a bad thing. Then the waitress came out and asked me if we received all of our food yet and we didn't we were still waiting on our noodle soup. She said we didn't tell her that order, which is a little weird because I saw what I wanted on the menu, I ordered it by speaking of it out loud I'm not sure what she means by \"we didn't tell her that order.\" Hmmm strange I think she meant she didn't hear our order? Very possibly because she was rushing the whole time. So that was that and she never said sorry. \n\nBut overall I give this place credit for their noodles. I had the minced beef noodles which was my favorite. The slickness was just right and I liked the slight sour taste of the broth. Also the noodles were very tender and tasted very well made. The cold noodles I thought was ok you would have to actually be into cold noodled. The pork burger was a little bland for me so it wasn't a favorite. \n\nConclusion: 2/5 stars if the service was better it would of been 3/5 for the food.", "author": "Teena N."}

The broth was out of this world. Kong pao chicken was okay normal, very tender chicken, big portion. Everything was oily and spicy and I have a weak stomach so I thought I might get heart burn after eating all that, but no nothing. That tells me it's a quality food. A must go if you are in the area!\nWent there again and had the pork burger, was delish as well. Another dish we had was the S chicken, but was disappointed bc it was bony chicken and pieces and bone was under my teeth so no fun. But the spices and the peanuts in the dish were amazing.", "author": "Nayiri H."}

Oh, and stop at the corner store to grab a six-pack to bring with.\n\nThe GOOD: everything else.\n\nAs others have said, the Hot & Sour Soup with Lamb Dumplings was outstanding, the Shaanxi noodles were solid, and we loved the Lotus appetizer.

This is not your typical Chinese restaurant; Terra Cotta Warrior serves up specialty Xi'an cuisine (aka Northern Chinese food, with an emphasis on hearty broths and noodles).\n\nThough this restaurant had only been open for a few weeks, it was packed at lunch hour. Food was tasty and reminiscent of flavors hard to find outside of China. My fam and I shared the following:\n- Cold pidan egg with tofu, cilantro and peppers: Great starter if you're a fan of spice.\n- Mian-pi: Cold noodles that, while good, were not amazing. Still refreshing on a warm day though.\n- Shanxi minced pork noodles: By far my favorite dish -- hot and sour and satisfying. The texture of the noodles indicated they were freshly pulled. Yummers.\n- Pita bread in lamb soup: This is the restaurant's specialty dish. SUPER filling, I highly recommend you share this. The \"pita bread\" is more like niangao (otherwise known as glutinous rice), I kinda wish it was on the side so I could dip it. Still good though.\n- Spicy lazi chicken: Another crowdpleaser.

It's become my favorite place to go order take out,especially since I now live so close to the restaurant. The restaurant decor is definitely a step higher than your standard chinese restaurant in the area. It's more modern and takes an homage to the Shaanxi province. \n\nIf there's one thing you should come here to try, it's their noodles. Their hand pulled noodles are simply the best i've had so far. Their fresh thick and chewy noodles make the difference from an 'ok' dish to an great tasting one.\n\nIn the multiple times I've come here, my favorite dish has got to be the Shaanxi Minced Pork noodles. For those who may not like hot and sour dishes, this may not be best to try but for a girl who CRAVES hot and sour soup noodles nearly every other day, it's perfect. The complex flavoring of the broth with the chewy thick freshly made noodles is divine. \n\nFor those who may not like the spicy dishes, I would highly recommend the tomato and egg noodle soup. The noodles in this dish are EXTREMELY wide and chewy, which works well with the tomato, egg and vegetable broth. \n\nKeep in mind that unless you're able to read the chinese characters on the menu carefully the food items you order here may be different from the types of food you would typically order at another Chinese restaurant. For instance, one might think the spicy beef noodle dish is the same type of dish you would find at Taiwanese restaurants, which is certainly not the case. \n\nThe reason why I would knock one star off this place is how the service can be a hit or miss (like many other chinese restaurants..). The female servers are at times, unaware of whats going on with their diners' requests. However, the owner/manager of the restaurant is extremely nice and you can tell that he genuinely cares in making sure his patrons are well taken care of. :)", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Because the service SUCKS that's why the 2 stars. My friend ordered an appetizer and the male waiter brought out the wrong one and instead of taking the food back and correcting the order, he proceeds to argue with her saying she ordered what he brought out. I ended up telling him to leave the item and asked him to get what she did order. After the correct appetizer finally came, we sat there for 1 hour and he never came back to the table. We had to flag down someone else 1 hr later to take our order.  The original waiter finally came to our table while we were waiting for our dinner and asked if he could take away any plates and when we said no he picked up one of the plates and proceeded to walk away. I want to note that he spoke perfect English. He was either deaf or just didn't care.  My friend had been there before and this was my first time. The menu looked better than the taste. I ordered a pork burger which was recommended by the waiter and it was plain tasting and not worth having again. The appetizers (shredded cold potato salad and cucumber salad) were okay - tastier with hot sauce though. My friend ordered some noodles and she liked her dish. For an Asian restaurant in an Asian neighborhood, the majority of the Asians there were the people that work there - that says a lot. \n\nIf you want slooooooow service, have rude waiters with okay food this is the perfect place for you.", "author": "Sandra V."}

The article praised the uniqueness of this northern Chinese cuisine and the food in Xian.  Additionally, it is close to walking distance.  After eating there, this place is not that unique and not that similar to Xian food and is rather ordinary.  While we were there, an SF police officer who handles permits had his clipboard out and was talking with restaurant management.  Maybe because they have a relatively low (81) health rating and it was follow-up\n\nOur party of 4 arrived about 1130 on a Friday morning, just after opening.  There were a few customers and the restaurant quickly filled up.  We sat on a \"picnic\" type table with long bench seats with out backs.  The interior was tastefully decorated and clean.\n\nOur waiter was receptive to questions, but did not go out of his way to explain the various cuisines that makes this restaurant different than the typical Chinese restaurants.  We finally ordered six (6) separate dishes to share.  They include the sauteed water spinach ($8.95), fried rice with five vegetables ($7.25), Chinese burger with pork ($3.95), cumin lamb burger, Qishan minced pork noodles ($7.25), and noodles with lamb ($8.95).  The last two items were soup dishes and the waiter remained mute and should have mentioned that to us.\n\nThe water spinach was drenched with chunks of garlic.  The fried rice was overly salty and way short of vegetables.  It only had tiny bits carrots and something else.  Better fried rice can be found at Cantonese hole-in-the-walls.  Both burger consisted of pieces of meat in a bun that reminds me of pita bread.  The cumin lamb burger was too spicy for some in our party.  Even though the price is modest, so is the quantity.  The Qishan soup had a sour and vinegar taste, short on pork.  The noodles were good.  The lamb soup had chunks of lamb and vegetables with thick noodles.  \n\nIn general, quality of the food does not equate to the rather high prices.  We have eaten food in Xian and the Terra Cotta Warrior is just an Americanized version of it.  Maybe the SF Chronicle article over-inflated the pluses of this place and it got to their heads.  They need to come down to earth, if they want long-term returning customers.", "author": "Robert J."}

Living in NY, we frequent XFF and we were really looking forward to trying something similar with a more restaurant-y vibe. We came on a Saturday night when it seemed busy. I signed our name in for 2 while my bf went to go find parking. They called our name and I told them to skip us as he had not found a spot yet. After 30-40 minutes of searching for a spot, we resorted to ordering takeout. I went to the counter and it took forever for them to take my order. I asked for a good, spicy, vegetarian noodle, and they suggested the hot oil noodle. So we ordered that, broccoli, and he ordered pita and lamb soup. 5 minutes after ordering, he found a spot, so I asked \"the lady in the glasses\" if we could have the food for here and she said \"No, it's too complicated to take out of the containers.\" This was a little annoying as there was no longer a wait for tables, but I accepted it as it seemed as if our food was already in the containers and ready to go. NOPE. We waited another 45+ minutes for our takeout to be ready... We watched people who sat while we waited get their food before us. The way the manager made it seem, was that our food was ready. I really don't understand why we couldn't have eaten it there if our order hasn't even gone through yet. Knowing that handpulled noodles don't taste as good after sitting, I decided to eat in the car. My noodles that we waited 45+ minutes for were COLD. They weren't spicy at all, which I asked for, and they were extremely salty and chewy. My boyfriend's lamb soup literally had 1 piece of lamb in it, which is a huge ripoff.

Not bad at all!\n\nWe had the:\n- Shaanxi mianpi\n-Hot and sour pork dumplings\n-Pita bread soaked in lamb soup\n-Jelly fish appetizer\n-Noodles with sizzling oil\n\nSHAANXI MIANPI:\nA must try! This was the first dish to come out and it was my favorite.  It was also only $3.95. The sauce was so good that my friends and I were drinking it (woops). We were super hungry so don't judge! Anyway, the sauce was basically chili oil mixed with vinegar. Tastes better than it sounds, trust me!\n\nHOT AND SOUR PORK DUMPLINGS:\nThis dish was alright, I liked the taste of the hot and sour soup but the dumplings tasted average to me. Nothing special, but still simple and good. \n\nPITA BREAD IN LAMB SOUP:\nVery special, never had tiny diced cubes of dough floating around in my soup before but it was pretty good. Definitely really filling because of the dough. They call it pita bread but it was more like doughy cubes. The taste of lamb is not overbearing. Overall, it felt like a very homey, comfort food-like dish. I can imagine drinking this on a cold, rainy day. My least favorite dish though because it didn't have as much flavor/spunk compared to the other dishes I had.\n\nJELLY FISH APPETIZER:\nSo refreshing! I personally love jellyfish, so this appetizer made my tastebuds very happy. It was more like a jellyfish salad because of all the veggies it came with, but I enjoyed it a lot. It helped balance out all the starchy noodles I was having from the other dishes.\n\nNOODLES WITH SIZZLING OIL:\nWe didn't mix these very well so it got pretty salty towards the end, but I would say that this was my 2nd favorite dish of the night. This was similar to the Shaanxi Mianpi, which is probably why I liked it so much. \n\nEverything here is just so good. Great ambiance and decor as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-19", "description": "Firstly, if you can't handle spicy foods, this place isn't for you.  But if you love the numbing heat from peppercorns and Chinese food, this place is definitely at least a must try.\n\nOverall, I rate the heat levels of all the spicy foods around a jalapeno level or less.  I did not encounter anything spicier.  This concept is key to this style of cooking.  They're not attempting to blow your head off with heat.  It's all about cooking the chili flavor into the meats and dishes served here, and on this, they executed it very well for the stir-fried dishes.  You should expect the numbing feeling from dishes served with peppercorns:\n\n\nI came here for lunch and my group order about 6 dishes from the menu.\n\n5-star dishes:\nThe spicy cold noodle dish, served in a bowl, seasoned with chili oil, and mixed with vegetables (usually cucumbers) was fantastic.  We tried two versions.  The spicier version definitely is the better one.  There is a picture uploaded by an user showing this dish.\n\nLamb soup with vermicelli was the best.  It's a light broth with a small helping of greens, vermicelli, and meat.  The broth was very flavorful and has the homemade taste.\n\nSpicy braised chicken with noodles - This is a large stir fry dish of soy sauce based chicken, peppercorns, red chilis, and noodles.   This dish really hits home if you're looking for spicy flavoring.  The heat level is bit less a jalapeno level, so it's not really intense.  But this dish is fantastic b/c the flavor of the chilis is cooked into the meat and noodles.  My only compliant would be the peppercorn balls in the dish.  They are essential to the flavor and the numbing effects, but it's a bit tedious to pick it out before you eat it. (though you don't have to pick them out at all).\n\n\n4-star dishes:\nLamb & Pork Burger - tried both versions.  The burger with the minced peppers, green onions are the best.  The burger that appeared to be just seasoned meat was more 3-stars in my book\n\n3-star dishes:\nThe cold spinach, and other cold vegetable dishes were average.  They were generally mildly-seasoned and mixed with oil.  I suppose cold dishes are a must have if you were dinning with a large group Chinese patrons at your table, but I would skip these fillers next time.\n\nService experience was average.  The waiters' attitudes were positive and friendly.  Service speed and responsiveness was average to below average due to the volume.", "author": "Mike D."}

My favorites so far are the Shaanxi mian-pi, pork with hot pepper burger, and jelly fish in mixed sauce.  I like spicy food and can handle it, but I don't like sour food.  That's why I didn't particularly like the hot and sour dumpling soup and the popular Qishan minced pork noodle since the broth for both seem too sour for me.  \n\nWhen you order, it seems like the servers take precautions to make sure you do not have any misconceptions about what you're ordering.  They tell you which dish you're ordering is spicy and ask you if you're OK with that.  When we ordered the mu-shu pork, they made sure to tell us that it's not the American style with the wrapper.  \n\nWith all the Asian restaurants in the area, it's nice to have a unique one that can introduce us to authentic Shaanxi cuisine.

I think some of this makes sense, but I hope they don't dilute the cuisine any more! \nSan Francisco diners are sophisticated and I like to think folks can appreciate the brighter contrasts of a more authentic interpretation of Xian cuisine. \nSo, if you the restaurant is reading he reviews: don't be afraid to be authentic with the flavors!", "author": "Kit T."}

Both noodle dishes don't really have a lot of meat, but the taste is excellent and you better be able to deal with the spice level.  \n\nHowever, it took an hour for 3 relatively simple dishes.  The kitchen appeared to be backed up at opening on a Sunday as the Qishan noodles made an appearance to 4 tables at once, all of which sat at various different times.  Apparently only one member on staff could take orders at the time, as we had to get the attention of the two other staff members for us to get our order in.  \n\nTaste of the food overwhelms the negatives of the timing and the service, so, take out for now, maybe try dine-in later and hope they get their timing together later.", "author": "Jonathan W."}

The spinach, noodles with beef, and pork dumpling soup were good, but nothing really special that you couldn't get at any other Chinese restaurant; these were the only dishes my group finished.  The rest of the food had a *ton* of red peppers floating around in a *lot* of oil and liquid.  \n\nThe braised chicken looked spectacular when it arrived but was by far the least favorite of our group; there were 3 different types of peppers in the dish and one of them, when crushed while chewing, became gritty...somewhat like eating sand! The chicken was chopped into small portions, but there were small fragments of bone to contend with as you ate. The only good part of the dish were the noodles at the bottom, but because the food was mounded up so high and the dish was so full, it was difficult to get to the noodles; and when you did, the noodles were so long that it was difficult to get them in your bowl without making a mess. \n\nThe spicy fish also came in a large amount of very oily liquid with lots of red peppers floating around; it was a strange dish that contained not only some fish but a piece of something that looked like Spam, some tofu, and something else that looked like well done liver... as I said, strange!  Both the chicken and fish came in huge portions, but because they weren't very popular with our party, there was a LOT left of both dishes. \n\n\nNo serving utensils are given with the dishes, so everyone eats family style, I guess. We're all adept at using chopsticks, but it was difficult getting the very long noodles into our bowls. It would help if you took a pair of kitchen scissors to the restaurant with you!\n\nThe service was not great either; I had to ask for boxes for the leftover food 3 times. Quite frankly, I don't think anyone in my household will eat the leftovers, but I thought I'd take the food to see if somebody else would like to try it.  There were 5 adults and a child in our party, but only 5 place settings were given to us; we had to ask for another one. Each time we asked for anything (i.e. water), only 5 were brought to the table... I guess the 3 year old wasn't supposed to eat or drink! \n\nAll in all, a very disappointing experience.

Everything was so new that the entire menu was handwritten in Chinese -- often a good sign for some authentic grub, so long as you bring along a friend who speaks the language to do the ordering for you. \n\nToo new that they were not even on Yelp. To be honest, if I wrote this review that night. I would have given it at least 4 starts. The service was alright, the food was great. I remember telling my friend that this place deserved a good review. \n\nI was hoping I quickly become a regular here. I've been to this restaurant at least a handful of times since. The service and food has slowly been declining since my first visit. The food isn't consistent --not just in how it's made but in quality. If they even have what you want. And most of of the time, they either don't have it, can't do it, won't do it, or they ask if you'll wait while they make more. Only if the kitchen actually made more and did not cancel your order without communicating with you.\n\nOnly a couple months in, and it's already very disappointing.", "author": "Jake M."}

They have a bizarre rule that they don't allow people to sit until all the people in the group have arrived. We were originally excited to try out this restaurant so we two (out of four) came all the way from South Bay Friday night caught in heavy traffic for 1.5 hours. When we get there our two other friends hadn't arrived. The waitress insisted that we can not sit at the table although there are at least 5 tables are wildly available. We ended up waiting at the door for 30 minutes until all our friends came. Off the chart stupidity. They don't care about customers at all.

For starter, we had cucumber salad, spinach with ginger sauce and pork with garlic sauce. I only like the thin slice pork with garlic sauce. For noodles, you must order with the sizzling oil. It was so good. Spicy and sort of numbing your tongue. We also tried qishan minced pork, scramble egg with tomato noodles, they are all different thickness of noodles.

We got there at around 7:30 pm and we were promptly seated. After a few minutes the waiter brought us some tea and took our orders. We waited and waited.... Then over 30 minutes passed by and our food still hasn't arrived yet and no one even came by to update us on the status of our order. Finally, the  family of 5 who was waiting by the door got seated. I was annoyed when I saw the family of 5 got their appetizer and food before us. Then I had flagged down the waitress to question her about our order. I told her that we had been seated and ordered our food WAY before the family of 5 arrived and they got their food before us. No apologies.... Instead the waitress got defensive and said the reason for the delay is because the kitchen was busy during the time we placed our orders. What BS!!! I would have left but my friend was determined to get his dumplings so we stayed. Finally, after 45 minutes at 8:15 pm our food was brought to our table. \n\nI do know not to expect much from a Chinese restaurant but I don't think I have EVER waited this long at any Chinese restaurant before. With the fancy restaurant name, well written menu, photos of historic terra cotta soldiers and elegant decor and well thought out specialty dishes,  you would naturally expect to get a little better service.
