One of the really good things it nurtured is my love for quality Japanese confections. Manju and Mochi.....Ohhhh Yeeeaaaahhhh! What's strange is that the offspring don't share that same enthusiasm and love of this sweet treat as I. O well, more for me. \n\nBenkyo-Do is one of the few remaining manju shops in Northern California. San Jose is the other. I am deathly afraid that the sands of time will not be kind to the future of this shop. I can only hope and dream that this institution can withstand the march of time. I try to patronize it whenever I am in the City. My patronizing is however very selfish.\n\nMy favorites are the traditional plain manju with the brown sweet bean filling. The unmistakable trademark of their pillowy soft mochi gives way to the soft slightly sweet filling inside. The powdery fine rice flour dust coats my lips, fingers, the front of my shirt, the tops of my shoes, and the floor which I stand. I can often order 6 of these sweet delights and not even make it to the corner stoplight before downing half of them. The pink manju/mochi with white bean filling are good, and so are the specialty flavors, Mango and Blueberry. I like the Blueberry, berry, berry much.\n\nThe service here is delightful. It's a small family run enterprise, and has been for since...forever. Smiling faces behind the counter as they quickly and very cutely place my ordered pieces into the light pink boxes and then tied up with thin pink ribbon tape-string. Such a nice gift wrap that won't stay wrapped for more than a few seconds after I hit the door out.\n\nMy ATF is and always will be the plain. It will until I can no longer stuff them into my pie hole. I dream of it when I haven't had a few in a while. \nPlease, please, PLEASE: Continue to support this ethnic and embattled iconic cultural food destination in the City's Japan Town! It is more than worthy of your patronage. \n\nExtinction is not kind to places like this.", "author": "william s."}

I usually tend to come on weekends because that's when they'll have their seasonal flavors like strawberry or mango. The strawberry, mango, and blueberry mochi will have a huge chunk of the fruit in the middle surrounded by bean paste. \n\nMy personal favorite is the mango and strawberry comes into a close second. I like these because the sweetness comes directly from the fruit \nand the fresh fruit adds a nice crunch! These fruit mochis do not last and must be eaten the same day... by the second day, the mochi will start absorbing the liquids and it becomes soft and will start disintegrating.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the peanut butter mochi because I think it's just chunky peanut butter in the filling and it's a bit too thick.\n\nIf you're in the area, definitely try this place out for tasty, inexpensive, and authentic mochi!", "author": "Andrea K."}

We finally made it over to J-Town on a recent visit back home from LA. Benkyodo was our immediate priority after flying out on the first flight headed to SFO. We arrived in Japantown a little before 1030am. We drove around the block a few times before finally finding metered parking up the hill. There was a decent line of about 6-8 people in front of us and not much mochi left. Nervous time... \n\nWhen we finally got to the front, we were able to get 2 mango (fresh mango and smooth white lima bean), 1 domyoji (steamed sweet rice with smooth red bean). 1 yomogi (green mochi with whole red beans) and 1 age (donut with smooth red beans). \n\nI had the fresh mango and it was really good. Loved the mochi and the juicy mango filling. That is as fresh as a mango mochi can get. Yumm. I also had the age and liked it a lot. The baked donut outer, drizzled with sugar and the smooth red bean paste inside was a great combination of textures and flavors. I really liked them both.\n\nI was hoping to try the strawberry mochi but they arent in season yet. The gentleman at the counter said they would probably have them in about 1-1.5 months. So next trip, I am for sure making it back for that.\n\nCash only. Great, simple and delicious mochi... If you've had 2 Ladies Kitchen from Hawaii then you will certainly appreciate what Benkyodo offers... Half the space is a coffee shop counter. They also sell a variety of Japanese snacks, candies and crackers... I love the old time, simplistic feel of the place. I hope they keep on keeping on for decades to come.", "author": "Chuck D."}

It looks like a diner lost in time from the late 60's that was converted to a Japanese confection store. There was a local man sitting at the counter having a conversation with the waitress on the coffee shop side. They were just chatting about the happenings. They sell donuts and advertise that they sell hamburgers and sandwiches, which I think is funny if not out of place. Maybe they just don't want to update the signs. Either way, I like the cozy feel of this store.\n\nBut we all know this review is for their mochi treats. There was not one mochi that my girlfriend and I didn't enjoy. They have peanut butter, red bean, strawberry, Lima bean, just all terrific stuff. I think we went when they first opened, so they brought out more flavors the longer we stayed there. Don't get too excited and jump in and blow your load on flavors you think you HAVE to get if other ones are coming out.\n\nWe bought a ton to share with our family and friends and there were no complaints. Only gripe is that it's cash only and if you're not fast enough then they might sell out of a flavor. Or you'll have to wait for them to make more.

Bobby, one of the owners, plays host & knows many of his customers by name. \n\nIt's a \"Cheers\" type of place where strangers as well as the regulars strike up friendly conversation drinkIng Japanese green tea or coffee, eating their counter ordered food, or eating Japanese pastries bought from the confection counter. \n\nThis reminds me of long gone Usui restaurant on First Street, Little Tokyo, DTLA where Mr. Usui presided over his large group of regulars of which I was privileged to be part of. \n\nBesides the luncheonette, the primary & original raison d'\u00eatre is for its Wagashi/Japanese confections. Mochigashi is made w/ a rice covering.  Manju is shaped like wheat flour based bun. Dora Yaki is closer to a wheat flour pancake. Most have some kind of fillng. \n\nTraditionally most of the sweet filling was either Kuroan (koo roh ahn)made from cooked Azuki beans which can be pur\u00e9ed smooth or have the rough skin, or smooth Shiroan (shee roh ahn)from Lima or other white colored beans. However, w/ cultural diffusion at the flick of the internet, chocolate, toffee, peanut butter, tropical fruit flavours, etc. are possible. \n\nThe holy grail at Benkyo-do- is their signature Strawberry Mochi which has an almost translucent pur\u00e9ed smooth, soft, velvety rice pastry. Inside is a sweet sour, lIghtly acidic fresh strawberry, coated w/\na sweetened, strawberry velout\u00e9 of Shiroan. Only available starting in April until the season runs out in fall. I couldn't get it in January. Such a Japanese concept where the cuisine is determined by the season. \n\nKuri Manju- is a cakey, flour based baked bun egg yolk washed for a dark golden brown hue. The filling is Shiroan w/ a texture & taste reminiscent of pur\u00e9ed  chestnut. It's another tasty winner. \n\nDaifuku Mochi is soft, velvety rice pastry filled w/ either Shiroan or Kuroan. The textures are ultra suave w/ subtle earthy sweetness. \n\nThat was all the Wagashi that was left by 3pm on a Saturday besides Anpan which is sweet bread bun filled w/ Kuroan. It's kInd of a Japanese European fusion food from over 100 years ago. \n\nBenkyo-do- also stocks Arare (ah rah reh) also known as Senbei (sehn beh ee) which are Japanese rice crackers either salt, Sho-yu/soy sauce, sugar flavoured. \n\n5 Yelp stars especially for serving as the community center for Japantown and continuing the tradition of making Japanese pastries for over a century.\n\nhttp://www.benkyodocompany.com/", "author": "Gary I."}

They were making some more but it won't be ready until noon. However! We were able to have them hold some for us! We can come back and pick them up. \n\nThey also give you the option to call it and have them hold some mochi for you :) That's pretty awesome of them. \n\nWe got a total of five different mochis to try.

If you are into mochi... Benkyo-Do is the place to be!\n\nI admit the first time I approached this place a little voice said: \"is this the legendary Benkyo-Do I heard so much about... hmm not much to look at.\" A nondescript building on the corner of Buchanan & Sutter Streets in the heart of Japantown. If you blink you might miss it. And just like Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies, it's what's in the inside that counts most. Ohh the beauty of mochi... \n\nIf you haven't had mochi you don't know what you're missing. Wait. Let me rephrase... if you had mochi, but not Benkyo-Do mochi you don't know what you're missing! It's that good, that soft, that fresh, and oh so Japanese. I advise to walk-out with at least half a dozen. \n\nMy favorites are: Habutai (white mochi filled w/ smooth red beans), Peanut Butter Mochi (pink mochi filled w/ peanut butter) & I die for the seasonal Strawberry Manj\u016b!

Note: Benkyo-do was one chosen as a recipient of the California Small Business of the Year Award.\n\nSo the next time if in Japantown look for the nondescript building at the corner. You'll see the Benkyo-Do sign and walk into the heavenly Japanese confections that go back many centuries. In 1906, Suyeichi Okamura first opened Benkyo-Do and who would have known his family business would still be around to celebrate the 100th anniversary in Japantown. Today, now 111-years old, it is still family operated by his grandsons, Ricky & Bobby, who have continued the family legacy.

There wasn't much of a selection left - only mango, pink and white habutai, and kuri. So naturally, I had to buy a bit of each. \n\nThe mango mochi was absolutely delectable; the softest and most tender mochi skin I've ever feasted upon envelopes a fresh and moist slice of mango in the center. It would be doing it injustice to only buy one piece and even more so to devour only one. But seeing that this was the most delicious mochi we ever had, we decided (sort of unwillingly) to share the rest with a nearby friend (I cried a little inside). \n\nI'll definitely be coming by this place again to experience the rest of these heavenly chewy squish balls.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

Small little shop north of Japantown across the street that opens up daily at 0800AM, selling out even before noon. They are normally closed on Sundays. We had arrived around 930AM and they were already sold out of the mango mochi, but stated they were going to make another batch later. Apparently you can call in and ask for some to be held for you for a short amount of time. \n\nFirst things first.... CASH ONLY ! \n\nMugwort (mugwort mochi with whole red bean) - didn't really taste the mugwort too much but the red bean was pretty sweet. \n\nKinako (green mochi with sweet red bean paste topped with toasted soybean powder) - im a fan of roasted/toasted soybean powder as i love getting the traditional korean shaved ice topped with this very same powder. The flavor is pretty similar to peanut. The powder was fairly light. Offset the sweet red bean paste a little bit. \n\nChofu - its like a thin pancake wrapped around a piece of mochi. The pancake itself is dry. Would be nice if it was just the mochi itself. \n\nBlueberry - one of the two fresh berry ones. Originally we wanted the mochi where it has a whole strawberry inside but apparently they dont make it when strawberries arent in season. This was a pretty interesting one. Never had anything other than strawberry before. Blueberries were sweet which added an additional berry sweetness to the mochi \n\nMango - the other fresh fruit. Just like the blueberry, it adds a nice fruit sweetness and the mango is very soft. \n\nDidn't try - Pink Habutai (pink mochi filled w/ peanut butter) and Habutai (white mochi filled w/ smooth red beans)\n\nMAN so i had 2 left over, pretty sure one was pink habutai and possibly the habutai that hand-carried to the airport and brought it on the plane. I put it in the front pocket AND I FORGOT TO TAKE IT WITH ME WHEN I GOT OFF ! SAD FACE ! IM TOTALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THE PINK HABUTAI NOW ! DANG IT ! \n\nThe Kinako and the two fruit ones were probably my two favorite. Im a huge fan on the soybean powder and the fresh fruit was nice! If i ever have the chance to come back again, maybe ill put the fruit ones in the fridge for like 15 minutes. Sounds like a great little cool treat ! Shouldn't mess with the mochi's texture too much. \n\nThe prices are very good. $1.25 to 1.50 each. Each one weights a fairly good amount. I had originally got 6 and they were placed in a nice black plastic container with a lid and tied with a bow tied. Friends who got 4 got a clear plastic clamshell type container. XD \n\nThe only thing i wished they had was fresh hot mochi. XD always wanted to try fresh ones", "author": "Andrew C."}

Mochi, or a chewy Japanese rice cake, is plain but has a smooth silky texture. Inside the mochi are red bean paste, whole red beans, lima bean paste, or fresh fruit. Personally I favor the red bean paste over the whole red beans for a more smooth and uniform consistency and texture. The fresh fruit mochi (mango, strawberry, or blueberry) are Benkyodo's best sellers and run out quickly.\n\nOther variations such as deep-fried dough with red bean filling, pancake-wrapped mochi, steamed buns filled with red beans, and plain mochi are also offered.\n\nThe mochi run slightly over $1 a piece, but the portions are quite generous and certainly shareable.

I got there yesterday after we finished lunch at Marufuku Ramen, maybe after 1:00 - 1:10.  There was a small line but we didn't have to wait more than several minutes.  I was a little disappointed in the limited selection of mochis.  I thought for all the hype they'd have more than like 5-6 types.  I ended up just buying us two strawberry mochis for $1.75 each.  Service was friendly enough and I appreciate the freshness of the mochis made onsite.  At first I thought I may have taken the last of the strawberry mochis, but they instantly brought another tray out.  \n\nI didn't eat them til several hours later, but for both of the mochis, one side was serverly sticking to the wrapper making it difficult to eat all of it.  They also had a lot of rice powder on them making a little bit of a mess on my black maxi dress.  A bit doughy but I'm alright with them as they were pillowy soft.  We also enjoyed the big strawberry chunk in the middle.  I've had my in laws bring me back home mochis from Hawaii which were probably several days old that still had a better consistency.  It makes sense that the strawberry mochi is made when in season, and I've seen the rotating fruit flavors here mentioned on Yelp (mango, blueberry, etc).

It looks like a diner from the outside, but when you go in the diner is on the right side and the mochi on the the left.  They have many types of mochi, they have whole red bean mochi, red bean paste mochi,  yellow bean mochi and my favorite fruit filling mochi.  \n\nDepending on the season, they have different flavors.  They have blueberry, strawberry and mango. However, i haven't seen the strawberry one in a long time. My favorite was the mango one! I love mango so this was perfect! There was mango puree inside and small chucks of mango all mixed in.  Their other mochis are all super fresh, you can tell the made it that day.  I like the mochi with red bean paste more than whole bean.\n\nIf you order a lot they will actually if you want it wrapped.  It makes a great gift because they box it up all nice and use very nice wrapping paper.  However, you need to order a 4 mochis for them to place it in a box for you.

When I finally stepped through the doors of this 100+ year-old establishment, I took in the sight of rows upon rows of handmade manju and mochi. I don't know the difference between mochi and manju. Both are made from a rice flour base. Perhaps someone can explain it in more detail to me one day.\nI picked out a few to try, but I might as well have closed my eyes and taken a stab in the dark. While I was clueless, other patrons who were obviously regulars, were loading up dozens of manju into gift boxes. The owners seemed somewhat impatient, which I guess goes along with running a no-nonsense, no-frills family business, so I quickly made my selections and went on my way.\n\nI got 2 blueberry mochi, a pink habutai - pink mochi with lima bean filling, and a chofu - mochi wrapped in thin pancake. They all tasted very fresh, soft, and not too chewy. I liked the blueberry filling the most, because the liquidy berry filling balanced out the glutinous rice. I wasn't a fan of the chofu. The thin pancake and glutinous rice combination dried out my mouth.\n\nIf I were in the area with a sweet tooth, I'd stop by Benkyodo to try out the other manju. Like a lot of the other shops in this neighborhood, they close pretty early and they are closed on Sundays, so that doesn't allow many opportunities to stop by. Unfortunately they do not accept cards, so that is an inconvenience. Good thing the little confectioneries are affordable.

Benkyodo is Japantown's longest running establishment, bringing handcrafted Japanese confections to San Francisco since 1905. Century-old recipes still continue to excite and bring generations together. Inside Benkyodo you will find a small cafe counter that is a popular meeting spot for older Japanese generations to linger over Japanese sweet treats and good conversation. \n\nThis was my first time to Benkyodo Co. as I usually get my bean buns from Shuei-Do Manju Shop in Japantown SJ. I really love the selections from both family-run shops and the warm cultural connections. \n\nBenkyodo has all your traditional manju flavors but has added a few enticing nouveau flavors to their line-up including peanut butter, strawberry, blueberry and age (deep fried donut), really pushing the red bean envelope. \n\nI loved the Age and the Strawberry manju. The Age is a donut-manju hybrid bringing together a soft jelly center with a crispy sugary exterior. The Strawberry manju features smooth white lima beans with fresh strawberries and strawberry flavorings. I was glad I brought more than a few of the strawberries home with me as they were one of the favorites. \n\nDiscover one of Japantown's most storied businesses and enjoy some delicious delicacies at Benkyodo.

Not only are these little guys affordable at under $2 a pop, but they're squishy and cute and absolutely delicious! The mochi is fresh and has the most delightful pillowy soft and chewy texture. My favorites are the strawberry and blueberry mochi, which are both stuffed with smooth lima bean paste and a fresh piece of fruit inside. The blueberry mochi are seasonal, but the strawberry mochi are full time. Other flavors include peanut butter and red bean, but they have a bunch of other manju (Japanese confections) that are more traditional. Some are baked and they even have one called Age, which is a small fried donut ball with red bean inside that's rolled in sugar. Yum! \n\nKeep in mind that they're cash only and close at 5pm, so some of the flavors sell out towards closing.

However, it's seasonal.\n\nWhat's so special about them: not only do they make it fresh, but the texture of the mochi is just perfect. It's soft and chewy. You can actually stretch the mochi out like cheese. It's honestly the BEST mochi I've ever had.\n\nI've also tried their red bean (Habutai), white lima bean (pink habutai), blueberry (also seasonal), and baked apple manju. All were delicious.\n\nYou can buy them individually for about $1.15 each a little bit more for the fresh fruit ones, I think they were around $1.35. Or you can buy them by the box (yes you can buy dozens!) They are cash only (or check).\n\nThis place is family owned and been in the business for multiple generations. Their quality of mochi is just incomparable to any other. I highly recommend everyone to try this place at least once. I recommend going earlier in the day, they do run out of mochi :O", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Benkyodo delivers better than any other I have had in SF so far.\n\nLocated in Japantown, this small shop has around 10 types of mochi. This includes a number of red bean types as well as peanut butter, baked lima bean, an interesting cinnamon flavor and their most popular item, strawberry mochi.\n\nIf you're only going to get one, get the strawberry. It is an actual strawberry inside, coated with strawberry cream filling and a layer of mochi on the outside to hold it all together with just a touch of powdered sugar. The flavor is delicate and sweet and the texture comes together nicely with the solid fruit, creamy filling and chewy mochi. \n\nI will definitely be coming back here for more in the future.", "author": "Mark O."}

I got 4 daifukus, one pancake wrap with mochi, and one mushi manju. \n\nThe 4 daifukus I got were:\n- Regular daifuku with koshi-an (smooth azuki bean paste)\n- Pink daifuku with shiro-an (smooth lima bean paste)\n- Green daifuku with koshi-an doused in kinako (roasted soybean flour that tastes similar to peanut butter)\n- Yomogi (Japanese mugwort) daifuku with tsubu-an (chunky azuki bean paste)\n\nOut of the 4 daifukus, I would say my favorites were the pink daifuku and the green daifuku. The lima bean paste in the pink daifuku was sweet and delicate. The green daifuku was doused just the right amount in kinako, which is always a win in my book. The regular daifuku was also delicious. What fell short for me was the yomogi daifuku. I wish the yomogi flavor shined through a little bit more! I'm wondering if the plant is hard to get here. However, all of them had a great soft and chewy texture that you can't get enough of.\n\nPersonally, I would not get the pancake wrap and mushi manju. The pancake wrap was delicious but I wish there was tsubu-an in it to add texture, and amp up the flavor a little bit more. The koshi-an inside the mushi manju was delicious but the manju itself was a little crumbly in texture. The perfect manju would have been steamed longer and therefore softer. So i'm taking off a star for both of those.\n\nService was amazing. The lady in the front told me that I should come back again and try the strawberry one and to call ahead and ask if they have any left before I come. I also loved they tie a little bow in your to-go container. Very Japanese of them :)\n\nCome here for the daifukus (that's what they are called, not mochi. Mochi is just the rice cake). I personally think that's what they do here best out of all the wagashi they sell. Also, CASH ONLY!", "author": "Hana K."}

I bought a Strawberry Mochi and an Imo - its a pancake wrapped with a mochi cube. I cannot wait to try the Strawberry mochi - so I bit it and it was oozing with a fresh strawberry and the mochi was freshly made, and still warm. Mmmm... great confections to start off the day. The Imo was also great too and who could resist warm, freshly cooked pancake wrapped with a warm mochi in it. It was sublime and a perfect breakfast item. I thought this shop was better compared to the one in San Jose. All of their manju, daifuku, wagashi and other treats are fresh and made to order. \nDon't be fooled when you enter the shop, on the left side is where all of the wagashi and japanese confections treats are located within lacquerware boxes filled with different selections of these tiny treats. On the right side of the shop is a small diner where they sell coffees, teas, sodas, sandwiches. Great way to chat the locals too. Only on Fridays and Saturdays, they serve the Strawberry Mochi- Mochi wrapped with a strawberry cream and fresh strawberry. Imo - a pancake wrapped with mochi and some lima paste. This was great breakfast starter.\nIf you are in Japantown in San Francisco, you have to try out 1 of each of their wagashi and daifuku - they are freshly made every day, and come out warm when they open at 8:00 am. You can call them, if you want to reserve a specific type of wagashi, and pick it up on a later date. They are located at the Japan Hall across Buchanan Hotel and Mira Japanese Grocery Store.", "author": "Jade M."}

Blueberry, strawberry, Mmm good!\n\nFYI the fruit mochi is dependent on the seasons. \n\nHighly recommend preordering for the holidays or for any major gathering just so that you can make sure you get the mochi you want. Luckily I preordered for Christmas Eve because by the time I arrived for pickup in the morning, there were only 2 flavors left!\n\nPS - Don't forget to bring cash!\nPPS - It's helpful to master the art of the getaway car so that one person runs in, picks up the mochi, and then runs out to the getaway outside.

The mochi is made fresh daily... Once it's sold out, it's sold out for the day. So always try to go there early. Some of the regular kinds consists of red bean, green bean, whole red bean, etc.. They also have seasonal flavors such as blueberry, strawberry, and mango which are ALL DEELIGHTFUL.. the mochi is chewy, soft, and not too sweet. My Grandma loves them and can probably eat half a dozen all by herself. If you want to please the elders, buy some and have them try it.. This treat is great because it's not too sweet, and not heavy at all. A great snack to have when you're visiting relatives or small get togethers..

I would come every weekend if I could, but I'm not the kind of gal to carry cash everywhere. I'm too lazy. If you're not lazy and it so happens to be Friday or Saturday, stop by! Get that strawberry mochi! It is divine I tell you! I would buy all of them if I ever carried that much cash. Make the stop to Japan Town! There are tons of other things to do, too. Get some ramen, takoyaki, or some cake from Yasukochi's. Do it all! You won't regret it.", "author": "Lyra C."}

The texture and flavor never really did it for me. (Asian desserts in general -- just not that into them)\n\nBut Benkyodo's strawberry mochi is a whole different story. The uber-soft mochi outside is filled with a delicious and creamy strawberry filling, and fresh strawberries. It actually tastes like a dessert without being too sweet.\n\nI'm currently devising reasons to get myself up to Japantown to get my hands on some more of the stuff.

No chewing that fat with this guy. Don't ask him if they take credit cards. They don't and it irks him to say so (although it might be funny to pop in and keep asking him; if you're bored or in need of amusement).

Goodness gracious, does place know how to do mochi RIIIGHT! \n\nCame here at around 1 pm to find a small store with half food shop and half mochi shop. There was a huge glass case lined with tons and tons of different kinds of mochis. We ended up paying a little over $7 for 6 mochis. They sell plates of 4 you can buy and we ended up going with their popular strawberry one, regular mochi filled with red bean, green mochi filled with red bean, and another one filled with their white bean. They also sell pre-packed box of 4 peanut butter mochi (that you can't buy individually), which we ended up grabbing a box of as welll. The lady at the cash register told us she LOVED peanut butter and those were definitely her FAVE.\n\nShe definitely was NOTTTT lying. The peanut butter mochi is BOMB. DOT. COM. It's like if Jiffy threw a party for their peanuts and decided to use a mochi ball as a venue. Too weird? Sorry. But honestly it's just THAT good. Their mochi is the perfect amount of chewiness, softness, and sweetness and stuffed with exactly the right amount of filling. \n\nTheir strawberry one was also really good too. I normally hate fake strawberry flavoring because it reminds me of Pepto Bismol, but if you're like me, don't be scared to try the strawberry mochi. It's more like a bean paste infused with subtle strawberry flavoring and it's SO good. They also have a small slice of strawberry in the middle of the mochi for a nice surprise! \n\nThis place is most definitely worth EVERY penny. If you have something bad to say about this place, there is PROBABLY something wrong with you. No I'm just kidding, but seriously go here. I'm so glad I don't live in SF because I'd be at this place probably every morning waiting at the door for their shop to open like a dog waiting for its bacon dinner. \n\nSeriously, amazing.", "author": "Vicki L."}

I've been to Japantown quite a few times over the years, but never explored the neighboring streets much since I just mostly looked around inside the mall area. It's pretty much across the street from the plaza hidden in the back of the line of shops. When you walk in, the mochi counter is on the left and I think they sell real food and snacks on the right. The owner was very nice and explained what the fillings were inside each of the mochi and manju.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Box with one each of all the mochi flavors ($5): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0100LAmvjZPFjEPswwrDBQ?select=zuljh1rg25lYd3Znd5UmjA#zuljh1rg25lYd3Znd5UmjA\n\nThe fillings were mostly a combination of red/green/white bean and then there was one with strawberry filling and a whole strawberry inside! The strawberry one was definitely both of our favorites. I realized I like fruit mochi a little bit better since the red bean, etc. type of filling kind of starts tasting the same after splitting four of those mochi haha. Don't get me wrong though, red bean is yummy too! What sets this place apart from the other mochi I've ever had was that the skin was so incredibly soft and chewy.

Their store is separated into halfs where the left sells a wide variety of fresh mochi and Japanese rice crackers and snacks, and to the right is a small diner with a similar but elaborated set up as Joe's Ice Cream. I've been coming here for many years and their mochi has been consistently the best, even better than the ones at Little Tokyo in LA. In the past they usually run out of mochi by 3pm regardless the day of the week. Yesterday, the place was packed with mochi enthusiasts and they needed all the help they could get. \n\nI think it's fantastic that they now have a wider recognition because this place is as good as it gets. My Yomogi (green tea mochi with brown soy powder and whole red beans) was heavy and sweet with outstanding red beans at the center. The Chofu (sugary plain sweet rice with pancake wrap) had a lighter taste and it was one of the best of its kind. I also tried their new thick red bean paste with awesome sticky rice in the middle and loved it. My all time favorite, strawberry manju (strawberry mochi filled with lima beans) was as soft and heavenly as ever. The common thread between all the manju and mochi here is the fact that they are ultra fresh and soft with a consistency that I have not observed anywhere else. If you want traditional handmade mochi and manju, I'd say this is the best place to get them on the West Coast. \n\nService was friendly and down to earth.

On the one hand, it was soft and floury like fresh bread or pastries, yet it was chewy and sweet like candy or gum.  I mean seriously, what the heck is a kid to think?\n\nWhen I finally made it out to Benkyodo to try some of their infamous fresh mochi, I had a feeling it was going to be good just from walking in.  From the aura of the place itself, you can tell that they've been in business for a long time - the decor and look is like a transplant of a coffee shop right out of the 50's.  I could just sense that those comments about them having the best mochi in SF just might be true.  \n\nThe glass case in the counter featured about six to eight different varieties of fresh mochi, alongside some pre-packaged types and other assorted treats.  Everything looked really good, but still being pretty full from lunch, I decided to go with just two for my family and I to try.  After a couple minutes of deliberation, ended up going with the Habutai (regular white mochi filled with red bean paste) and the Pink Habutai (pink mochi filled with lima bean paste).  Both were plumped up nicely from the filling, and the mochi was soft to the touch and bite.  The filling in both was pretty sweet, but really full in flavor.  And at just a $1.10 per pop, it's so worth it!\n\nUnfortunately, didn't get a chance to try any of the fruit mochi (namely the strawberry mochi people have written about, or the blueberry I saw either), but I'll definitely do so on my next trip there.

From the outside at a passing glance, it looks like one of those dives you would find in between a nut store and a pawnshop in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Except here you will not find old men talking about how great Shecky Greene was in the Catskills.\r\n\r\nInstead, you think you'll find elderly Japanese frozen in their stools....well, at least the kind you sit on. But it seems to attract all ages. There may be places like Benkyodo within the confines of downtown Tokyo, but I guess I never noticed. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a split-identity eatery --- half luncheon counter and half manju bakery. Manju, if you don't know, is the Japanese pastry that sort of looks like Chinese dim sum, though it's not baked --- it's just glutinous rice pounded to oblivion, molded into various geometric shapes and filled with different kinds of fillings.\r\n\r\nI finally tried both sides of the schizophrenic Benkyodo with a friend, and each was actually pretty good. I had an egg salad sandwich on white Wonder bread, and it tasted surprisingly fresh especially with a fresh piece of iceberg lettuce and a tomato slice. Very cheap. There are two women who serve at the counter, and there are a couple of small tables, too. You can tell they have a regular clientele because at least three guys just sat there staring out the window without eating or saying anything. I think it would have been nice if they talked to each other.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the space is actually the main attraction. It's a virtual manju-palooza --- rainbow manju, strawberry manju, peanut butter manju, toasted mochi, and of course the plain manju with the red bean paste inside. Even though I am addicted to starch, I am not that big a manju or mochi fan, as I find them chewy after a couple, but I have to give praise for the peanut butter ones that had to be individually wrapped.

I would definitely come back to try some of the other flavors.", "author": "Christine D."}

They have some of the traditional items (mochi with sweet bean paste), but also more modern one's like peanut butter and strawberry mochi.  And yes, there is real strawberry in it!\n\nThe mochi was fresh, delicious, and tasted GREAT.  I only wish they had chocolate peanut butter mochi and a few more selections.  However, what they did have was tasty and I'm glad to have found a place that actually makes it here in California.\n\nI'll have to try some of their other items in the future.", "author": "Mary B."}

From the looks of it only the locals eat here, most everyone else wants mochi.  Mochi are little pastry like desserts, some have a cake-like exterior some are covered with rice flour dough.  The inside filling is usually made of either red bean or lima bean paste.  \n\nWhile my description might sound unexciting they are all are delicious and wonderful to look at.  \n\nBenkyodo's specialties are the seasonal fruit mochi (strawberries in summer, blueberries most of the other time) and their peanut butter mochi.  These are exquisite. If you don't get there early (like before 1:00PM) you may not find any of the fruit or peanut butter mochi left.  What we do is call ahead and order in advance.  They hold the mochi for us.  Prices are $1.50 each I believe, might be a small variance depending on the type.", "author": "Ethan Z."}

Although I'd done a thorough read of things regarding this establishment, there were in fact signs (in bright green) underneath each item explaining what each mochi or manju (dessert) contained & their price. \n\nI had been in the mood for \"sakura mochi\", it being the season and all, but didn't realize this establishment made their own! Many time I've bought the 3 to a package (in Styrofoam) available in the supermarkets for $4. However, the last time I bought one it wasn't fresh and attempting to revive it with a little steam didn't work well either. This time I was GUARANTEED fresh and each mochi was $1.25 -- a tiny bit cheaper, plus I could just get TWO, which is perfect for me. Further, they were individually wrapped in saran wrap.\n\nQuickly I was being rung up, but the REAL reason I'd walked in was because of all the rave reviews about the strawberry mochi here (although, I was fine with blueberry too). Since I hadn't seen them inside the counter, I asked gently if they had any strawberry or blueberry. I almost never bother to ask if something exists that I don't see -- I'm the opposite of the believer in a magic storage room. But I'm glad I did so, because immediately the man said, \"Yes, blueberry!\" \n\nAnd from the back, after a little looking, they were produced. Then I was politely asked if the two different types of mochi could be packed together. Yes, that was fine. He took the sakura out of their little bag and placed them in a plastic container that protected them from being crushed. \n\nBlueberry pie happens to be my favorite pie, and it is a dying breed. In fact, if you know of a DECENT, PLAIN BLUEBERRY PIE in San Francisco -- please tell me. Anyway, this mochi was like biting into a perfect slice of blueberry pie! I moaned! It was that good. The fragrance wafting out of the box was heavenly. I've also eaten a lot of mochi and this was STILL shockingly good and soft in texture. I'm saving the other for a friend and it's going to be hard not to keep it for myself. \n\nSakura mochi (cherry blossom rice cake) is distinctively a blush pink with a leaf wrapped around half of it -- the entire thing is edible, although you can pick the leaf off if you prefer. Personally, I love eating leaves; grape leaves or Hawaiin ti-leaf are the stuff to me. The rice is not pounded into a dough, as in other mochi, but left whole creating a pleasant texture. Inside is smooooth red bean paste. The outside of the mochi will have a cherry fragrance, more subtle than a true flavor, more like an essence that is imparted when you eat. Additionally, there is a quick pat of salty water to the outside, so that a salty flavor also hits your tongue and emphasizes the sweetness by contrasting it. Not a complaint from me. It delivered.\n\nAnother yelper compared this mochi to a fancy chocolate shop and their certainly is a similarity in the combining of: flavors, textures, tradition, experimentation, and freshness!

My grandma lives in Japantown and I don't understand how for the past 20+ years of my life I didn't know this place existed! For the past 2 years whenever I get a chance I make sure I stop by here to satisfy my mochi craving! The store is pretty small and a little tricky to find.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of red bean so my favorite flavors here are strawberry and blueberry. They are seasonal so just be aware of that. I love that the the strawberry mochi has real strawberries in it. The outside is so chewy and soft. I've bought boxes of them and normally my whole family gobbles them up in a day, but we've had the red bean ones a few days later and they were still good.\n\nI definitely think it's worth trying if you're in the area.", "author": "Hana C."}

When the family was interned during World War II, Benkyodo Company was forced to close temporarily.  After the war ended, the shop reopened, and in 1951 Suyeichi's son, Hirofumi, took over. In 1959, the shop moved to its present-day location at Sutter and Buchanan Street.\n\nThis place is 106 years old this year!!\nAmazing history. Amazing place. With the recent closing of Uoki K.

I am a big fan of Wagashi.  When I was in a middle school, I joined a tea ceremony after school program to be able to eat Wagashi everyday.\n\nBut I have to say I was very disappointed with Benkyodo... Sorry my Yelp friends who gave Benkyodo 5 stars I have to disagree...\n\n1. They use a lot of food coloring for their sweets.  Wagashi in Japan have more delicate colors.  Yes Yomogi Mochi suppose to be green but not this bright. I can tell Benkyodo is not using much real Yomogi in the Mochi.  Yomogi is a leafy vegetable of the chrysanthemum family.  It adds beautiful aroma and little fiberly texture.  It also gives earthy moss color to the Mochi.  I could tell Benkyodo used a lot of artificial colors and flavors.\n\n2. The design and taste of their Wagashi is not polished.  Japanese consider Wagashi as an art and they are created by Shokunin (craftsman who was trained many years)  I believe Wagashi have to be beautiful and delicate in flavor. (example http://www.ioi.tv/special/04_06/misuzu.html ) To me Benkyodo's Wagashi is like Inaka (county side) style and not polished.\n\nI respect Benkyodo for it's 100 year history.  Yes they are better than packaged Japaneses Mochi / Daifuku you can buy at supermarkets.  That is why I am giving them 3 stars.  But I'm not sure if they can survive if thy were in Tokyo or Kyoto.\n\n\nJust FYI - Mochi means Japanese glutinous rice cake.  Japanese Girls/Woman call it Omochi.  It is not womanly to call it without O.  So I never called it Mochi.  There are so many other word start with O in Japanese language for woman.  If there are something inside of Mochi, they are called Daifuku, Manju, or Dango (there are different names from different region of Japan) and no longer called Mochi", "author": "Chie J."}

The texture, weight and lovely mix of flavors makes me smile.  The beauty is one or two usually are enough and they go beautifully with some tea.\n\nBenkyodo makes some of the best manju around.  I don't know what I was thinking when I only bought one strawberry today in my mix box of 10.  I will have to remedy that when I return.  The texture is fantastic, the filling is rich and sweet but not overwhelming.  I considered learning how to make my own adzuki bean paste and mochi, but decided with Benkyodo just a few miles away, why bother.  They are amazingly fresh, lovely, and affordable.\n\nThe only thing I wish for is a better sign in English describing them (as another yelper noted, the lady behind the counter wasn't overly helpful) and slightly longer hours.  Really you can't make a bad choice; you just want to make sure you get enough of the ones you really like, so that you don't have to arm wrestle your husband for the strawberry or doughnut ones.

I also like the slightly less sweet and delicate chestnut paste filling of the Kuri mochi in a baked bread layer.  For quick snacks on the go, I like the Dorayaki: two small pancakes sandwich a Azuki patty (think a hamburger).......use to eat those with gyu-nu (milk in Japan).  Wow, natsukashii (nostalgic!!)\n\nWhat I miss most, is the Oshiruko, where small round pieces of soft melting mochi are afloat in a warm sweet Azuki soup.

Didn't get to taste the peanut butter yet as they were sold out. Went there two times in one week as I was housesitting on Sutter for a friend. The 2nd time (yesterday), I discovered the woman gave me the wrong kind (4 pieces) so I went back an hour later and the man told her to give me 4 pieces for free...he raised his voice at me, saying, \"I can't take this mochi back!\" at least 3 times...I think he was upset with his staff? I didn't take it personally. \n\nI live with two people from Japan and so I have had the fortunate experience of eating mochi from Tokyo (fresh off the plane) and also home-cooked mochi.\n\nNow that I've tried this place...I can't wait to sample another mochi place in San Jose, where my housemate (from Tokyo), says is better than Benkyodo.

It only took me about three visits to finally visit the mochi shop on a day and time when they actually had mochi left in more than two flavors. The last time I went was on a weekday afternoon, which explains why I was able to get the full selection of flavors. I looked in the mochi glass case and counted the available flavors: 10. So I look up at the nice lady, and say \"Can I have the 10-piece box? One of each flavor, please.\" Perfect. When I got home with my goodies, I took a bite of each one before passing on the remaining half-eaten morsels of chewy deliciousness to the BF. I think the chocolate flavor was a new one for me...it was just ok. I prefer the redbean filled mochi. \n\nHonestly, I can't tell between the different flavors. I just know they're all different colors, most of them filled with red-bean, and all of them delicious. And the chewy, doughy mochi just tastes so fresh and homemade here. Like I know the lady who packed my mochi might have been the one also making mochi early that morning, packing each doughy piece with red bean and made with love.", "author": "Jessie C."}

I had no idea they closed so early, so I was disappointed to find it closed on a Friday evening.  And I was really disappointed when I went out of my way one Sunday afternoon to find that they are not open on Sundays (doh! I should have consulted Yelp before leaving the house).  \n\nSo, after two disappointing attempts, you can imagine my manju craving was at an all time high.  After nagging my SO's ear off about eating manju, the oh-so-sweet guy got off work early last Friday and drove his a** to J-town and bought me a whole assortment of manju!!!  I was so ecstatic!  I couldn't wait to devour everything, I tore right through the nicely wrapped box.  He got me one of everything and I have to say my favorite of the bunch were definitely the peanut butter and the chofu (sweet rice cake wrapped in a pancake).  The pb manju was so fresh, and I love that they used crunchy pb.  The pancake they use for the chofu is sooo yummy, it's reminiscent of breakfast pancakes, but there's something uniquely different about it but I just can't seem to pinpoint it.\n\nI would definitely go back to try their donut manju and any others I haven't tried yet, and to load up on the pb and chofu manju.  The minus .5 stars comes from my SO's complaint that the old man working the counter was not friendly at all and did not welcome any small chit-chat.  He was the only customer, but the man seemed to be in a very grumpy mood.", "author": "Diane L."}

So the first time I saw Benkyodo's treats, I was skeptical.  Then I bit into the Pink Habutai, and it was like that scene in Ratatouille. I flashbacked to nervously eyeing the mallet while flipping mochi at New Year's mochitsuki, and begging my parents for unceremoniously cling wrapped strawberry mochi nestled between spam musubi and crack seed jars.    \n\nIt's always pretty quiet when I stop by though, like J-town in general.

They make mochi--daifuku, to be exact, daily! fresh! local! authentic! I think they are one of two places that do in the entire Bay Area! This is no trivial feat, people. I grew up on my grandmother's daifuku which took her all day to make with love and care. This place makes it the  same way, just as someone's grandmother in Japan might make, and better than what one would find in upscale department stores in Japan. The mochi wrapping is soft and fresh, the fillings perfectly sweetened! Also good are the other 'deli' type items such as sekihan (red azuki bean rice), dorayaki (a sweet that looks like a pancake sandwich with red bean paste filling) and others. They also sell the cracker that is the basis of fortune cookies (osenbei) --yes, the fortune cookie was invented by Japanese in the US, not in China and not in Asia.  I like the mini osenbei, which are the size of silver dollars and flat.\n\nAnyway, the traditional Japanese sweets are fabulous. I am surprised the foodies haven't discovered this, but maybe just as well--more for me!! I have never eaten at the counter, but the menu looks like standard American greasy spoon fare which I could do without (and this one star off).\n\nThis place is the heart and soul of the Japanese community of San Francisco.

But the absolute best are the seasonal fruit  mochi: the strawberry and blueberry are amazing.\n\nThey also have a peanut butter mochi which is delicious and apple manju which are a great choice for someone who is not as adventurous.\n\nThe mochi itself has the perfect texture, soft but still toothsome.  The filings are fantastic: silky smooth and not too sweet.  They have both the really traditional flavors/styles, and more \"contemporary\" flavors.  \n\nThe folks here are always so friendly and helpful.  If there is something that is not in the case, they will often let me know when it will be coming out  so I can reserve a couple for later.

This was the first time I had ever been to a fresh mochi and manju shop so I had high expectations - maybe I didn't order the right stuff because I was a bit disappointed.\n\nI ordered a blueberry mochi, apple manju, and something else that I can only describe as a ball of anko (red bean paste) wrapped in what looked like steamed matcha (green tea) cake/bread. \n\nI wanted to try the strawberry mochi that many reviewers raved about, but since I didn't see it in the display case I went with the blueberry. I can't say I really liked it. It had a white lima bean paste filling with real fresh blueberries, but the combination didn't really mesh well for me. I thought the lima bean paste wasn't quite thick enough, and the mochi didn't really taste like blueberry. I actually think this would be made better if they made a concentrated blueberry jam and mixed it into the lima bean paste filling because there wasn't enough blueberry flavor. The mochi skin itself tasted fresh and chewy.\n\nThe apple manju was also a let down. Once again, the outside skin tasted fine but the filling was boring. It tasted like Mickey D's apple pie filling, but it fails to leave an impression - I actually think the filling needs more cinnamon.\n\nThe matcha bun type thing with anko wasn't too bad. The anko definitely isn't canned (the canned stuff tends to be super sweet). \n\nThese three pieces cost me $3.50 - which I think is an okay price for homemade mochi/manju since preparing all the pastes and is probably a lot of work. As someone who has tried the microwave method of making mochi, I appreciate that someone can make these by hand and have them come out so beautiful. \n\nThere's also a cafe, I think I saw a few hot dogs on a hot dog roller that didn't look that appetizing. While my purchases today didn't exactly thrill me, I'm willing to give it another try and maybe be a bit more adventurous in my selection next time.", "author": "Monica W."}

What you are looking for is a simple, coffee shop on Buchanan Street just down the way from the Denny's. Most people walked pass this store and not know they have the most delicious and authentic mochi. This is as authentic as the mochi you get in Japan. I love this place for many reasons:\n\n1. Delicious, fresh mochi. \nThe mochis are made fresh everyday onsite. The people who make them are Japanese (if you have read my other reviews, you'll know this is my pet peeve). When you go, you can see mochi displayed in their glass case shelves and mochis being made in the back room behind a curtain shielded doorway. It is as fresh as you can get. \n\n2. Authentic and wonderful flavors\nThe mochis are very authentically Japanese, soft, but slightly chewy. Their regular mochis flavors are the Green Tea with azuki (red bean paste); regular white mochi with azuki; yellow bean, baked mochi. In the summer, they made my favorite, the strawberry mochi with a whole strawberry covered with mochi outside. Oiishii! \n\n3. The store is independently own and has a simple, down to earth, non-pretentious flavor to it. I just love walking in there to find locals (mostly older folks) hanging out of the bar having coffee and a piece of mochi chatting about. It makes mochi shopping so much more interesting. \n\nThe store is kind of hidden in Japan Town and you kind of have to look for it. Trust me when I say this: Once you have Benkyoto's mochi, you'll never buy any pre-packed or frozen mochi you find in supermarkets ever again. Benkyoto's mochi is fresh, the dough is slightly chewy and the filling is sweet, but not over powering. It is just perfect with a nice cup of hot Japanese green tea.

I wanted strawberry but they were featuring blueberry today.  \n\nToday, in a epic whirlwind of trying tons of edibles around Japantown and Pac Heights, I came in here and ordered the blueberry mochi, the mochi with the pancake wrapped around it, and a white bean mochi with baked pastry around it.\n\nI barely got out of the store and slinked down the alleyway behind the store.  I could smell the fragrant blueberries.  The heft of the mochi in my right hand felt empowering.  After one bite, I was in Nantucket, picking blueberries in the bramble, cut-off denim shorts, blue and orange stripped t-shirt, pigtails, barefeet and freckles.  I was 7 years old again.  \n\nBUT THE CRAZY THING is that those were not my memories!  I've never been to Nantucket.  I never picked blueberries.  I never had a blue and orange stripped t-shirt.  That is some powerful mochi to conjure up someone else's fond childhood memories and make me think they were mine.  That is some Willy Wonka magic right there.\n\n\nThe white bean mochi was at the recommendation of the nice man behind the counter with very good English.  He spoke better than me.  And he did not think less of me when I confessed that I abhor red bean.  He said that it doesn't make me a bad Asian daughter.  Forgiveness and a sweet.  \n\nOn the other side of the store, this place looks like a non-ironic diner.  The formica counter with the hot dog cooker.  The loyal patrons.  The cop stuffing his face.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-14", "description": "We sure did find out about this place in a roundabout way: A couple months ago we went to the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park and I was intrigued by something on the menu called manju. Considering ourselves semi-experts on Japanese cuisine & culture (as much as Westerners can be, anyway) we were surprised because we'd never heard of manju before. Turns out that what they called manju was really just mochi dusted with soy powder (sounds weird but tastes delicious!)\n\nWhat was really unique was how soft and melt in your mouth they were. About a billion times better than the mochi one can buy in Asian grocery stores. And about ten times better than the mochi I've made at home (in a microwave!)\n\nThe Tea Garden charges a fortune, though: $2.50 per piece. I was so happy to find out, once we made our way to Benkyodo, that their prices were way cheaper so we could buy a lot more mochi! Anyway the connection, which I forgot to mention, was that the Tea Garden buys all their stuff from Benkyodo, which I found out from asking the server, so we went straight to the source and were delighted to find a lot more variety than what the Tea Garden offered.\n\nSome recommendations: \nThe green mochi with red bean paste dusted with soy powder.\nThe white mochi with a pink dot in the middle with white bean paste (again sounds weird but tastes so yummy! And it's a great change from red bean paste, which is in just about every Japanese dessert. It's also not as sweet as red bean paste).\nThe chocolate marshmallow mochi.\nThe square baked manju with white bean paste.\nThe round baked (or fried?) manju with red bean paste, I think it's coated with sugar, it tastes much like a donut (sinful!)\nThe apple manju-seasonal. Tastes like apple pie.\n\nThere were more but I can't remember them. We actually ordered one of each because I wanted to sample them all! And we weren't disappointed, either. A couple of them weren't that great: the white steamed manju with red bean paste. They were hard, perhaps because it was late in the afternoon when we bought them? Maybe they're soft in the morning when they're freshly made. In any case I'm happy that we tried them all, it was so worth it.", "author": "amii c."}

Their specials today were Blueberry and Apple, both of which I haven't tried yet, but am dying to!\n\nThe taste quality is definitely distinguishable to the air-sealed box versions that i thought only existed before the disvoery of BENKYODO CO.! The mochi is is soft, chewy and tastes suprisingly fresh. How you ask? Cannot even explain it in words. Just tasty! They are also reallllllllllllly realllllllly sweet! So don't go and order 20ish mochi to devour on your own; share, because it's caring. I had two or three and that was enough. but for those with a huge sweet tooth, maybe you could go for one or two more.\n\nThe mochi's are about $1 each if you buy them in 4,6,12's, etc. If you were to get Apple or Blueberry then add .10 cents please.

I came here on Tuesday and looked for the Strawberry Mochi that all the reviews were raving about but they had none!!

I had 2 red bean, 1 chocolate marshmallow and 1 other one that I do not remember the name. \n\nIt's true, the mochi here is definitely fresh. And just like others, when I thought of Mochi I think of the ice cream mochi that they sell in the ice cream isle. But this mochi is waaaay better. I guess I'm giving it three stars because the lady behind the counter did not really explain to me what the mochi was even when I asked about different flavors.

I use to bring it to school when I was a kid and everyone hated it.  Come to think of it, no one liked any of my Japanese food.

Fill it with red bean paste, peanut butter if you want to copy Benkyodo, ice cream, or don't fill it at all.\n4.  Dust with katakuriko (potato starch) or kinako (soy powder) to prevent mochi from sticking.\n\nMy favorite is slighly pink mochi and I stuff it with red bean and strawberry!  \n\nAnd, last but not least, eat slowly so you don't choke.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-27", "description": "Across China, Taiwan, and Japan there are lots of small mom & pop type businesses, particularly restaurants or shops specializing in a specific delicacy, and are known to do so for generations.Those that have surpased a century in age, are come to known as, in Chinese ,\"bai lien lao dien\" (Mandarin) or \"bak leen lo deem\" (Cantonese) which translates directly to \"100 year old shop\".\n\nBut there's a lot more behind that meaning. What do these businesses have in common?\n\n- In addition to age, a lot of history and contribution to their local community. Perhaps a landmark and or representation of the finest they have to offer.\n- Receipe(s) that produce magical works of art for public consumption.\n- Receipe(s) that at times may require the full use of one hands, creating things from scratch. After all machine made can only do so much. \n- Receipe(s) for products (food for example) handed down from generation to generation, strictly within the family (amongst men only was the general rule, women in the family were thought to be of liability and would marry outside, and not entrusted with the original family receipes or the business. Only boys or men next in line would qualify, like the kings in the old world)\n- A firm dedication and committment to preservation of tradition, culture, methods of preparation, execution, and thus consistently maintaining quality. The essential spirit of the business.\n\nThere is a sushi-ya right by Tsukiji Market called Sushi Bun that I did a yelp review on. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/hPsrvt8CMSkTudm5uMmLtQ?hrid=MyCauJ98P0A6aI1TByML8Q\n\n150 year old place, handed down at least 4 generations. A true \"100 year old shop\"!\n\nBenkyodo Co, I would say they are the only true \"100 year old shop\" in the whole of the Bay Area and they have my full vote on this, and probably the only place I can think of that does everything very well based on first impressions.\n\nI cannot believe after living in SF for so long, that it took yelp reviews for me to check this place out. I have passed by this place on Sundays, it was always closed, and from the outside certainly does not look very interesting.\n\nI have never really been a big fan of wagashi and mochi...until yesterday. During my last major visit to Japan in 1999 (joining a guided tour unfortunately), I had samples of numerous similar types, perhaps they were machine made, or the flavors just didn't sink in with me. Our tour guide told us these were called \"grass cakes\", literally mochi made with a type of grass leaf (hence the color), which interesting enough the Hakka Taiwanese took that concept and made a steamed salty variation of it (using preserved veg, pork slices, daikon etc) called Ngeh Ban.\n\nBut yesterday morning I found a rare opportunity to be in the area. I went into Benkyodo and this was a bit before10 am. On the right was a coffee shop counter service place, with lots of old/retired Japanese Americans. To the left was the actual store itself, with a very impressive display.\n\nI had the pleasure of having one of the owner's daughters serve me at the cashier. She was very patient and friendly and to top it off very helpful. I ended up buying four pieces, and ended up picking two of their most popular flavors, the Kinako mochi (smooth red bean with soybean flour) and the strawberry mochi.\n\nI made the mistake of eating the strawberry mochi first. Never have I had such a wonderful, smooth, and fresh piece! To top it off there was a small fresh piece of strawberry inside. The flavors and textures really played tricks with my tongue, as there were hints of sour and sweetness hitting from all sides. I'm definitely coming back for more if I can. Forget the \"chocolate roses\" from Murata's Cafe Hana in Kintetsu Mall, get strawberry mochi's for your female boo, dudes. That yelper joke about his female gal pal getting multiple orgasms from eating one was certainly not kidding. In case you were wondering I managed to keep my pants dry after eating one of each (then again I only ate one, maybe not if I had several...), but can't wait till the next time I head up there!\n\nThe Kinako was excellent in its own way. A lush green outer later, with a very refined and delicate red bean interior that was gushing with flavor and not overly or sickly sweet. I can see why San Francisco magazine in 2001 voted this as one of their \"must eats\" lists, which Benkyodo Co proudly mention on their website.\n\nI asked the daughter if she was interested in learning the mochi making process, and she said she isn't learning it at this time, but her older brother is. It sounds like owners Ricky and Bobby are still set on retiring once the kids hit college, but unless something changes, I can only hope this place can remain open for the many years to come so that my generation and the next, can continue to appreciate goodness like this.\n\nThank you, Benkyodo, for letting us know what authentic, real fresh and delicious mochi can be (and should be).", "author": "Ken K."}

I must've been about 3 or 4 and I don't remember much except for spending a lot of time with my grandfathers.  \n\nMy paternal grandfather had been a high school principal which is kind of a big deal there.  I was the first born to his first born so he liked me a lot.  He would ride me to the park on the handlebars of his bike.  I later found out he also told my mom about behaviors he noticed in me so that she could make sure they didn't become bigger issues.

My dad was going to be flying out the next day and they told me to get on the phone and tell him to hold on until my dad arrived.  I was scared of what he would sound like.  I thought his voice would be very weak or hoarse.  The reality was worse.  He sounded just like my father.  That night I dreamed of fire and lava.  The next day he was gone. \n\nI'm not sure what my maternal grandfather did as an occupation but he was very social and active.  My first memory of him is of a balding, small man that I used to follow around like a puppy.  He would introduce me as his granddaughter and I never felt so proud.  The last time I saw him, I was 12 and the language barrier was bad enough that I was often mute around him.  I was there in the winter and didn't have gloves so he took me to a corner store to get some and I had the strongest sense of deja vu.  The night he passed, I dreamed in white. \n\nI associate mochi with my grandfathers.  I can remember eating the red bean filled ones on new years with both of them and whenever I bite into one, for a moment, I'm sitting on the handlebars of an old bike or trailing behind a small old man who walked at a very fast pace. \n\nI hadn't had mochi in a long time but Darin brought a variety from Benkyodo to a picnic recently.

Unfortunately, I got there a little too late to get any of the strawberry mochi, although I managed to snag one of the last two packages of the peanut butter mochi.  We also got the classic red bean and white bean.\n\nThe mochi are in a word, exquisite.  Soft and pillowy, they almost feel like they could melt in your mouth.  They are unbelievably fresh and the fillings are delicious.  The peanut butter seemed a little odd since I'm used to a red bean filling.  But, being the peanut butter fan that I am, I still found it to be interesting and delicious.  The star of the bunch, though, was the red bean.  We got both the smooth and the whole bean, and both were awesome.  I prefer the whole bean to the smooth, since it had a nice texture and offered a good contrast to the chewy dough.  The fillings are sweet without being cloying and the dough has enough flavor to be eaten on its own .\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back to Benkyodo to get more mochi.  Hopefully, next time, I'll get there early enough to get the strawberry mochi...I can't wait to try it.  The lunch counter looked intriguing as well, so perhaps it'll be a full meal for me the next time I'm there.", "author": "Angela H."}

What I mean by that is that most of the manju are a little too sweet for my palate, which is something I normally deal with when I eat Western desserts, not when I eat wagashi; even paired with a strong/bitter tea some of the treats are quite overpowering.

They cost about a buck to a buck ten a pop, so you get good bang for your buck with their larger size. Size aside, a key reason why they taste so good is that they are made fresh! Depending on when you go, you may have to wait for them to make their manchus/mochis (i had to wait half an hour for them to bring out their specialty, strawberry manchu). \n\nif you get the chance to stop by, I highly recommend the strawberry manchu - it's filled with a slightly creamy lima bean paste along with a fresh strawberry.

They have a variety of red beans ones as well with whole beans and smooth beans (ground up beans).  I'm not too big of a red bean fan so I default to the lima bean.  The mochi is thin, soft and chewy and the inside contains the perfect mixture of filling.  Once you've tried fresh mochi, there's no going back to package mochi.  It's just not comparable.

I purchased four of each of the following for only $21!\n\nHabutai = white mochi with smooth red bean paste\nKinako = green mochi with smooth white bean paste, sprinkled with soybean flour\nPink Habutai = pink mochi with smooth white bean paste\nKuri Manju = baked bread manju with smooth white bean paste\nRoppo = baked bread manju with smooth red bean paste\nHoji Manju = steamed bread manju with chunky red beans\n\nThey're all vegan friendly and fucking diabetically delicious. The only way they could be more delicious is if they were shaped like dicks.\n\nNow, it's true that the consumption of copious amounts of mochi can kill you as the sticky rice could lodge in the throat. For example, in January 2005, 1 person died and 15 were hospitalized in critical condition as a result of consuming mochi on New Years, as reported by Asahi (http://www.asahi.com/offtime/04-05/news/TKY200501020019.html) And in 2007, 3 people in Tokyo died (http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/02/asia/AS_GEN_Japan_Rice_Cake_Deaths.php)\n\nIn fact, what I usually do for my white friends who, let's face it, OPPRESS ME WITH THEIR VERY FUCKING EXISTENCE, is don my kimono, feed them a ton of delicious mochi, and wait until they start choking. Then as they expire I scream \"WHAT DAT ROUND-EYE DEVIRR?!? HEIMRICH MANOOVERR?!? ME NO SPEAKY ENGRISH MUDDAFUKKAHHH!!\"\n\nNo, I keed. I speak English. I know the heimlich maneuver. Oh and some of my best friends are round-eyed devils. I say, DOWN WITH HATE! LET'S LOVE ONE ANOTHER! Suck it, bitch.", "author": "d s."}

The habutai with the lima bean filling had an amazing soft and chewy exterior bursting with a smooth, tasty interior with every bite. I remember paying $1 each for each mochi but last time I went, it was like $1.10 or so but each mochi is pretty big and surprisingly filling. I would totally eat one after every meal! I hope they make more flavors in the future! The lady behind the counter is absolutely friendly and I feel as if my aunt is giving me homemade food made with love to take home haha.

The mochi outside was soooo fresh and the blueberries burst into my mouth as i bit into it. The peanut butter one was pretty good but the actual mochi outside was a bit firmer tho.

Not the ones you buy at the super market that are pre-packed and are days old., but the ones that are made here at Benkyoda. The funny thing is I am not a really big fan of red bean- I mean it when I say that... like the smell of red bean makes me nauseous. Some traumatizing event when I was a kid. The reason why I like mochi is for the white sticky rice flour dough, not the filling. Don't get me wrong, I like the filling too, as long as it is not red bean. I finally found a place that makes different fillings for their mochi. LOVE IT! The mochi that I have tried here was the Kuri and Kuri Goma, which is a baked dough with the lima bean filling. Liked the filling but not a fan of the baked dough. Apparently the difference between the two is that the Kuri Goma has a sesame garnish( the difference between the two that I could tell was the shape and size of the mochi). The Pink Habutai is yummy, fresh lima bean paste wrapped in the rice dough. My favorite was the Suama. It is just the sticky rice dough without any filling. LOVED IT!!! I did buy the Komuchi in a package of about 14, which is the fresh rice dough, thinking that it would be just like the outer coating of the mochi, but was a little disappointed because it definitely does not have sugar mixed into it. When they say plain rice dough, they literally mean rice dough with NO sugar. After opening the Komuchi package and eating about two of the little rice dough balls, the rice balls became hard as a rock a few days later. That was a little disappointing , but that tells me that they use fresh ingredients or that I just didn't re-wrap the package tight enough.  I did want to try the Ohagi, which is a black with a sweet rice center, but the lady at the counter told me that they only make it on the weekend- too bad for me. I will definitely come back here to try the other mochis and manju.", "author": "carebear l."}

I walked up to the store and saw the closed sign...nooooooo :-(  alright...i'll try next time.\n\nThe second time I went, it was a monday afternoon around noon-ish. I was soooo excited to finally come here (again) and I was really craving some peanut butter manju. So I'm whistling to myself, and just thinking about how great it would be and I was already tasting the peanut butter and chewy rice and then....I walk up to the store once again and see the closed sign! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Right next to it there's a note that the store is going to be closed for the next few weeks because they were on vacation. I came all the way here during regular store hours to see that they were closed again! Ugh....I was going to cry! \n\nA month later, I came here again for the third time. It was a Monday late afternoon and wanted to make sure I got here before they closed at 5pm. So I got to JTown at 4:30 and as I was walking towards this place, I started getting all paranoid that they were already closed, there wasn't going to be anything available that I wanted (esp. the peanut butter and strawberry manju) and that I was going to be screwed again.

I was still a little paranoid that something was going to run out because there was this lady in front of me that bought a few boxes and the mochi supply was dwindling. luckily, there was still the ones I really wanted and just to make sure i really experienced this stuff, i decided to buy a box of 20 (for $18.70....not bad) and a package of the peanut butter stuff ($2.70 for three) so i think I got three of each of everything they had.  \n\nAs soon as I paid, I walked out and rushed to the nearest bench to open my package of peanut butter manju. *sniff sniff* i think i started tearing up at this point.....it was soooooooooooo good! the texture of the mochi was soft and sweet (not too sweet) and smooth. and with the peanut butter, it was perfect! \n\nand then as i was waiting to meet with one of my girls, i decided to open the box and proceed to the strawberry manju....yummmmmmm\nso worth it after the two failed attempts of coming here! my eyes are getting all misty just thinking about it!", "author": "Pippi L."}

Don't buy the packages mochi bites at the front counter.  They were covered with mold the second day we had them.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of that.  Interesting place where half the place is a mochi counter and half looks like an old small diner area where the local clientelle consists of older men and women eating chili dogs and tuna fish sandwiches.  Very interesting place to say the least.  I would stick to the mochi because it is incredible!", "author": "Darren I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-19", "description": "My previous exposure to mochi had been the store bought processed, packaged, enhanced by additives and preservatives, mochi and ice cream mochi. My first real mochi experience was this past year in Maui at Long's Drugs.  I picked up some fresh made Home Maid butter mochi and chichi dango and after the first bite, knew I had stumbled on the start of a personal culinary adventure and love affair with mochi.  During the same trip, I found a Home Maid bakery shop with their assortment of sweet, exotic mochi confections and had more of the butter mochi, in addition to trying coconut mochi, red bean mochi, and purple yam mochi. Many happy mochi memories and well enjoyed calories later,  back in SF my search had began of similar mochi I can either buy or make myself.  I tried buying the store bought, processed mochi just to see if it was any good, and it tasted stale, rubbery and overall bad in comparison to fresh mochi.  I tried several recipes, and found that my mochi skills need to be worked on and perfected.  I found Benkyodo off Yelp and it has become the best place to satiate my mochi cravings.   The fresh strawberry mochi is my favorite - soft and chewy with a sweet, juicy strawberry filling.  I highly recommend stopping in at Benkyodo for their freshly made, delectable sweets, where each mochi piece is handcrafted to perfection.  If you go on a weekday, there's convenient non-metered parking on Laguna or Sutter Streets.", "author": "michele g."}

This is no ordinary coffeeshop.  Ricky and Bobby are third generation manju makers, part of a dying breed of artisans who make these traditional confections by hand each day.    Benkyodo celebrated its 100th anniversary in June 2006.  If you stop by on a Saturday, be prepared to wait in line and go early because they can sell out fast.  It's kind of amusing to see how East meets West here, for my kids often look forward to ordering a hotdog with their kuri goma manju, baked manju with smooth white beans and sesame seed garnish.  When I'm there, it's hard to resist my childhood favorite, dorayaki, a pancake style manju filled with whole red beans.

This isn't the store bought red-bean mochi that you find in stores on Irving or Clement, and definitely not the ice-cream mochi that Trader Joe pimps.  This is the real deal mochi.  Freshly made and so soft to the touch that it almost feels obscene to be handling them.  No matter, they don't last in your hands very long before you wolf them down.  The insides include not-too-sweet sweet bean concoctions (and others), and the outsides are multicolored, but really the outsides are more for show than taste.  I'd skip the soy powder mochi if you're driving - you'll look like you just finished a coke fest if pulled over by a cop.  And don't let the store throw you off, it looks like a well loved 50's diner, with  newspaper reading senior citizenry as perminant decor.
