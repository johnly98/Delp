Most places have super thick pita bread or over fried/dry falafel. The falafel here is the opposite- thin pita that is sturdy enough to hold all the ingredients, crisp falafel balls that aren't dry, fresh veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and pickled cabbage. There's also hummus which adds a good creaminess. Ask for some hot sauce if you want a little kick. \n\nThe lentil soup is also pretty good. The small is a big portion if you are eating it there. I would recommend if you want a warm and comforting soup to compliment your wrap (and it's vegan!). This place doesn't get too busy during lunch so if you're in a hurry that's also a plus.

The pita gets super soggy from all the liquids in the gyro, and doesn't really hold up very well. And I'm not talking about eating it hours later soggy; I'm talking like less than ten minutes.

(Out of the three spots offered, this was the only one I never tried.) Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, June 1st a little before 12 noon.\n\nI got the Chicken Kabob Plate: Marinated chicken with lemon, garlic, and Hummus, Tabbouleh Salad, Served with pita bread ($17). The chicken was good. Nicely seasoned and a great smokiness from the char. For the price, I wanted more of my sides. On first look, it looked like a pretty good portion, but then I realized there was only a thin layer of hummus and tabbouleh. It was kind of disappointing as I was still hungry after I ate the whole dish. Even my coworker who thinks all portions are too huge wanted more hummus. And this girl never finishes anything. The sides were okay though. The hummus was creamy and the tabbouleh added a nice freshness.\n\nDecent food, but very skimpy on the portions.

I noticed there was no avocado in the wrap, so I went back to ask them to put it on, which I was then informed it was under the lettuce. After fishing my hand into the pita to move the lettuce around, I found literally one slice of avocado. I asked if I could have a bit more and the guy behind the counter gave me attitude like I was being unreasonable as he put another slice on.\n\nOn top of that, when I went to finish the second half of my pita when I got back to work, I noticed that although this half DID have avocado, it was rotten (see pic below). There was a also red cabbage as well that was also dark, dark brown. The avocado and cabbage was so rotten that I don't think you could've made the sandwich without knowing. Obviously this is just speculatuon, but I feel like they were trying to avoid throwing away old food (hence the avocado hiding under a blanket of lettuce).\n\nThe falafel and hummus itself was good, but certainly not good enough for me to give this place another try.

Yeah, it's about $1-2 dollars more than what I think is reasonable, but their falafels are really the best in the area. That extra dollar or two makes it worth it for me. Perfectly crisp on the outside, savory, soft and slightly crumbly on the inside. Not pasty, dry, or bland like some of the other places. Can't beat a food falafel! \n\nThe service is kinda slow sometimes. They don't go above and beyond but they get the job done. It's not really a place I would sit down and eat.. but the falafels are too damn good to pass up.\n\nSUPER FALAFEL, ALWAYS. The combo of the fried eggplant, falafel and potatoes makes it super hearty and delicious. A comfort food I'll daydream about once every couple of months.\n\nThere's also the regular falafel or avocado falafel in the pita pocket but it's too messy. The pickled cabbage makes it a big soggy and it kinda sucks the fresh components of the wrap (lettuce, tomatoes, and cabbage) comes out cold vs cooked components.

They are delicious just by themselves, and you can order 6 ($5) or 12 ($8) in a paper bag to go.  They are freshly cooked.  While the inside tastes pretty typical of a good falafel, it's the outside that is unique.  They have a great crunch, and I think they pick up a nice flavor from the oil they are cooked in.\n\nI ordered the Avocado Falafel in a Pita for $9.  It's served in a thin, cold pita, that can easily break open.  Other than the Falafel, the flavors of the other ingredients are just OK.  If I remember right, you get a total of 4 falafel as the pita is rather small.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would order some Falafel from Sunrise Deli, run a few blocks and ask Sabra Grill https://www.yelp.com/biz/sabra-grill-san-francisco to use those Falafel in their warm thick pita with all the trimmings.  That would taste great.\n\nI also tried a half pint of their Mujaddara (Rice and Lentils) for $5.  Though I really like most Mujaddaras, this was one of the worst.  The rice was overcooked and soft, and had a yellow color.  The lentils were OK, and there was little to no onion.  It basically tasted like something that had been made a few days before and reheated.  Other than bulk, the Mujaddara added nothing to my meal, and I wish I had not ordered it.\n\nSo, on the strength of the Falafels, I'll give an overall rating of 3 stars.\n\n_______________\nOn another visit, I tried a small Lentil Soup for $5, and a Lamb Shawarma for $9.\n\nI really liked the lentil soup.  While a bit too salty for me, it had nice flavor.\n\nThe flavor of the Lamb in the Shawarma was OK; but, overall the Lamb was dry and the shawarma needed more flavor.  I tried adding hot sauce.  Believe it or not, spooning the lentil soup into the Shawarma made it more moist and really added a nice flavor.", "author": "Roy C."}

I only ordered the super falafel sandwich (With Hummus, Eggplant, Potatoes, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Tahini Sauce, served in lavish bread) which was admittedly very good. A lot of falafel are too hard, dry and crumbly but these are exactly how they should be - basically the complete opposite, tender balls, moist and delish.\n\nBut to really test the falafel I'll have to get some by themselves. I know, I know, the sacrifices I'll have to make to come back to eat their really good falafel and compare to another really good falafel. \n\nI think the falafels can be ordered by themselves for 50\u00a2 each (approx) which is slightly more expensive than Truly Mediterranean (I can usually get a bakers dozen for handful of dollars).", "author": "Jean K."}

Ever.\n\nI didn't believe my friend when she told me Sunrise Deli has the best falafels she's ever eaten. Sure I like falafels. But what could really make falafels so awesome? Well that was my own ignorance - these falafels had an incredibly thick and rich breading on the outside. Amazing crunch, countering the dense, smooth, and flavorful filling. Wow.\n\nThe rest of the food was good. Not quite as amazing as the falafel, but solid. I think if I'd ONLY gotten the falafel, it would've been 5 stars =).\n\n* Shawarma Plate (Lamb Shawarma served in a Ring of Hummus with Onions, Tomatoes, and Tahini Sauce, served with pita bread) - Pita bread was medium thick and a good side. The lamb quality was pretty good, fairly tender, and overall dish was fairly enjoyable. I would just say the tahini sauce could have used a little more flavor/ seasoning.\n\n* Kabob Plate (Chicken Kabob served with two side orders (babaganoush & falafels), served with pita bread) - Gotta reiterate - the falafels were the highlight. Babaganoush was a little too homogeneous (over-pureed). I like having more texture from the eggplant. But the chicken was pretty amazing, really nice & moist & tender.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

Perusing the menus I can see this is the same deal and I know it must be run by the same people, so here goes.\nFortunately I found the food truck towards the end of lunch. The crowd had disappeared. For some reason though, even though there was only one guy waiting for his food, we both waited for at least 20 minutes for our food. A true WTF moment.\nAfter I got my food (standard chicken plate with hummus and cucumber salad) I walked off to sit down, only to discover they forgot to include my falafels. I walked back and fortunately one of the staffers was in a jovial mood and wanted to give me more than I ordered, possibly because they were done for the day and closing. So, he gave me 6 falafels, 3 more than I paid for, along with an extra side of hummus. Bonus.\nThe food was, I have to say, excellent. It was definitely of food truck calibre, I thought. The hummus was too watery but it had a good creaminess and was not overly garlicky. The falafel was, as others have stated, the best. Crunchy non oily goodness. Slathered with hummus it is divine.\nThe chicken was very tasty. Not necessarily best I've had but not bad at all.

I'm Italian, okay?  If I don't get a certain quota of olive oil, I shrivel up and blow away.  While I don't consider Sunrise my fave, it has its own lovable quirks and specialties that keep me coming back.\n\nSunrise is not such a good place for groups, but if you're after an intimate-but-casual lunch for a friend or a fan of small spaces (I personally find them cozy!), there should be nothing stopping you from enjoying this ultra-casual setting for a sit-down meal.  And really, if you're working in SOMA or the FiDi and wearing a suit all day, doesn't it feel good to hunker down to a laminated table and stuff your pretty face with falafel?  Go ahead, I won't tell.  Oh, fine.  You can get it to go if you must.\n\nSpeaking of falafel, it's really some of the best I've had.  It's not greasy, but it is delightfully crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Like, creamier than any other falafel I've had.  This, of course, takes care of one of the issues one can take with falafel: it's just a lot of chickpea.  Sunrise adds in a couple other flavors to the mix to keep things interesting.  My personal favorite is the avocado falafel, and my boyfriend goes for the super falafel.  Point being, adding more fat and starch to your fat and starch is clearly the best way to go.  Their pitas are artfully arranged with just enough avocado (if that's your thing), a generous amount of tahini (or possibly a hummus-tahini mixture thing that's equal parts hummus, tahini, and awesome), and crunchy fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and what have you (the latter being a plant from the \"StuffnThings\" genus).  They also have super good pickled turnips.  Sound weird?  Eat it anyway, you'll like it.\n\nOne of the qualms I have is that Sunrise is not the best place to go if you're trying to eat healthily.  Since I almost always turn to Mediterranean fare when I'm looking to ingest something biologically helpful, its very existence seems a little oxymoronic to me.  Sure falafel is vegetarian, but if you're looking to eat veg and avoid the fried (yes, even lightly fried), your best bet is either to get a bunch of dips and pita (which is tasty, but doesn't really feel like a meal) or a veggie wrap (which is good but not the best, kind of deflating when you want a bit more of a selection).\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't swear off my other Mediterranean haunts, but when I want some mind-numbingly delicious falafel, pleasant service, and a phenomenally hobbit-hole-like dining experience, I go to Sunrise straight away.", "author": "Becca S."}

They catered our office holiday party last December and everything was perfect.\n\nThey were incredibly accommodating all through the menu selection process, even letting us sample items. Calls were returned promptly, business was polite and professional, and never was I left wondering about anything. \n\nThe food was delivered promptly by gentlemen who helped us haul it upstairs... and it was absolutely delicious, still warm, cleanly and professionally packaged. Many glowing comments were made about the food through the evening. \n\nI recommend these folks without reservation. Thanks again, Sunrise Deli!!!", "author": "K L."}

There's seating downstairs and if you go up a steep bunch of steps, plenty of seating upstairs. As far as a downtown lunch place goes, it's fine. Definitely a good choice if you're hankering for falafel.", "author": "Grace Y."}

Picked up the Vegetarian Combo for lunch - about $10 for tabouli, babghanuj, hummus, rice & lentils, tomato & cucumber salad, falafel, dolma, and pita - a little pricey, but it comes with a ton of food.  The falafel is just as delicious as at the Irving St location. yummmmm.", "author": "marissa a."}

Falafel and eggplant in super falafel bland. A hot sauce option would be nice. \n\nPickled turnips are great and always welcome. Chicken kabob was cooked to order, which was nice.\n\nGiven the prices (not crazy, but not cheap), I'd like something with a little more flavor.\n\nAbsolutely does not hold a candle to Truly Mediterranean\n\nAlso, given that they have a relatively small menu, and a relatively long line at lunch, they should really call out numbers.

I originally became a fan of their location on Irvine St. and I was pumped when I found out a new location was opening in the financial district just a few blocks from my workplace. The falafel plate at Sunrise is delectable and comes with 3 to 4 huge falafels and pita bread which you makes a great sandwich when you add in the tahini sauce and salad. The lamb shwarma and baklava are also highlights. If your craving a reasonably priced hearty meal, Sunrise Deli is sure to leave you satisfied and wanting to come back for more.", "author": "Husain K."}

Wanted to give this place a try since it's new to the neighborhood.  I got a lamb schwarma and split some dolmas with my buddy.  Overall very tasty.  The only thing that would've made the schwarma better would have been more tender meat and thinner slices.  At times you had to gnaw it off which was tough.  Definitely seems like they are getting good business.  I'd be willing to go back and try something else out--perhaps falafel?", "author": "Christopher W."}

They have pretty much all of the typical middle eastern type dishes. I had the falafel and the dolmas, both of which were good though I thought the dolmas could have been a little less tart.

I got the avocado falafel sandwich on pita.  The falafel itself is fantastic: crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, nice and flavorful.\n\nConstruction was fine on my sandwich, no leakage here.  Pita was somewhat thin, but I wouldn't call it bland or stale in the least.  \n\nQuick service, no complaints.\n\nI think I might go for the deluxe on lavash next time.  I'll definitely be back.\n\nThanks guys!", "author": "John D."}

The pita I got was broken and all the chicken, lettuce, and sauce came running out.  The chicken was dry and definitely needed more of the yogurt sauce.  For 7.65 including tax, for a small portion, there's definitely more options in downtown for lunch.  Honestly I would prefer to go Oasis Grill for a chicken shawarma.  I'm pissed off of myself, I should of walked around the corner for D. Leary's corn beef sandwich instead.", "author": "Calvin H."}

(Hate it when that happens!)  Then I saw a sign that said Sunrise Deli.  Hhmmmm, I thought to myself, could this be the SAME Sunrise Deli on Irving that has the best falafel in the world???  Hurray - it is!  I grabbed a regular falafel sandwich and \"treated\" myself to a piece of pistachio baklava (what the hell, it's the holidays).   The pita bread is nothing special but I'm happy to report that the falafel in this location is just as awesome!", "author": "Michelle E."}

I ordered the lamb schwarma. The pita bread was bland and thin, not fluffy like a good pita. More like a store bought, slightly stale pita. The lettuce took up most of the sandwich, subsided by some small, bite size pieces of lamb, which to be frank, was not all that flavorful. The portions are pretty small, particularly for the price (mine came to $7.65 with tax for the sandwich, no drink). The one thing that saved this place is that they were giving away free falafal balls, which are clearly how this place got its reputation in the first place. The ball was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-05", "description": "For full disclosue, I'm not that big of a fan of Arabic food and so perhaps not the best judge but I've been going to the Sunrise Deli in the Sunset  for quite some time now because in my opinion they have some of the best takeout Arabic food in the Bay. Definitely their falafels are the freshest I've tasted and their chicken shawarma is outstanding. So when I saw that they were opening a new store less than 5 min from my work office I was estatic. Since they've opened I've been going there about twice a week and havent gotten tired of it yet. I'd recommend going from 1 to 2 pm because from 12 to 1 it's insanely busy. I've also taken my work collegues who seem to enjoy it as well (this location has a lot more seating than the other one). My colleagues like the lentil soup and some of the vegetarian stuff but I've never tried it so I cant really speak on it. For someone that usually spends almost $10-15 per lunch I find this place to be on the cheap side - which is another plus. A few times after eating I've purchased some pita bread, half-dozen falafels and a tub of hummus to take home and make sandwiches - a quick way to make dinner when I'm too lazy after work. Only down side so far is that they dont sell red bull.", "author": "Phil W."}
