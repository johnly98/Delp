Generous rich amounts smeared on slices of bread - a great starter!\n\nNext the pastas. I'll go out on a limb to extrapolate and say you can't really go wrong with any choices here. Both of our dishes were medium-portioned and tasted fresh and delicious. The level of ingredients and care of preparation evident made me confident that it extended to other dishes as well.\n\nBut the real winner of the night was the smoked burrata. It was absolutely out of this world! This special cheese is imported straight from Italy and as such is limited to a certain number of orders during the week (according to their menu). As of the time of writing this review, that number is 16 per week. We were a bit worried that since we came in on a Saturday we would be late to the game, but to our delight there was still some in stock. It's a bit pricey, but believe me it's well worth it. You have never had a cheese with such complex rich smokey flavors as this. I highly recommend adding this to your order if it's available.", "author": "Stephen C."}

The flavors of the pizza are really good. Texture was ok. The crust is crispy until about half way through the pizza and then the large majority of the center is soft. But again, great flavors.\n\nService: I had to give this place 2 stars because of the service. People were just straight up rude. I've honestly never been treated this way at a restaurant and it was incredibly surprising. From the moment we arrived the hostess was rude and dismissive. Had it just been my partner and I we probably would have left because of her, but we were hosting friends so we stayed, assuming it would get better. Unfortunately, the waiter was also rude. At one point my partner joked to me under his breath, \"why does it feel like everyone here hates us??\" It was such an uncomfortable night.\n\nThere's just no reason to go here. You can find way better food at 100 different places in SF and you can find better service at your local gas station.", "author": "Meagan M."}

Ok, i changed my mind and changed it to 2 stars. \n\n2 out our 3 visits made us felt like we were seated and treated based on how we were dressed and not because of table availability. My boyfriend live three blocks away from this place. I went here with him once and was really impressed with their food (amazing! ordered the rigatoni) and minimalist interior. We were dressed for a date night. \n\nThe second time we went, was told that there was a wait time, 40 minutes. We saw open tables, hostess indifferent, snobbish but ok, no biggy! Didn't overthink it. I was wearing black leggings and a simple black sweater. We end up going to the sushi restaurant one block away, we were starving. \n\nMy boyfriend went there tonight wearing t-shirt, jeans and sandals, was told that there was a long wait time. Open tables again and hostess indifferent. He came back after dressing up for a wedding and voila! Smile, warmth, open table and zero wait time. He was disappointed how different he was treated by the same person before and after he dressed up. \n\nIt really saddens me that being in San Francisco, where were pioneering in addressing social injustices and inequality, this restaurant would treat customers based on how one is dressed. We understand dress codes but this place is trying too hard.  Ok, mediocre setting (like an upscale version of subway). Its confusing to expect so much for dress codes. I mean, this place screams minimalist, home kitchen with a bar. Which is homey.\n\n Anyhow, despite loving the food i wouldn't come to this place again. They promote an atmosphere of exclusivity and so much pretentiousness. \n\nIm actually disappointed writing this review coz i really like your food. Its just that how you pick and choose to treat your costumers that sucks!", "author": "Roux S."}

The bar seating looks comfortable but the tables in the back don't look great unless you have a larger group and are forced to sit back there. \n\nI don't think they offer house bread, we ordered it specifically. That was weird. \n\nGet the meatballs, they were solid. But ask for bread with it because the sauce might overwhelm you. \n\nWe also got the pomodoro pasta because everyone else said to. While delicious, the steep price tag doesn't seem justified for a dish that has no meat and not a particularly large serving.

Thankfully, the hostess said it was fine as long as we finished our meal by the time people who had reservations have arrived. Happy hour was still going on so we decided to get a Margherita pizza ($10) and added burrata cheese with arugula on top. Pizza was gooey, cheesy and crunchy all in one. \n\n I forgot what pasta dish i got but it was light and creamy with fennel sausage and broccoli. My boyfriend got the lasagna. I liked both dishes but preferred the lasagna over my creamy pasta dish. \n\nAs a palate opener, I highly suggest getting the Venetian iced tea (alcoholic).

Chicken slipped off the bone the way I slip into a pair of pajamas after a long day at work. With a fork and bread knife, I was able to transport the juicy decadence directly to my heart where it soothed me and brought a tear to my eye. The olives, tomatoes, and basil worked in tandem creating an ode to joy. I looked around as I inhaled my meal to the open kitchen, brick wall, and shelves of wine, instantly teleporting me to rustic Italy. The service was that which was fit for royalty, and even though the busy crowd summoned white noise, my focus was concentrated solely on the beautiful work of art before me. As with a musical symphony that touches your soul, I was sad, yet satisfied, when this experience came to an end. \n\nBtw the polenta was bland but I ain't even trippin tho cause the rest of the plate was lit af and you could dip that shit into the chicken sauce and whatnot and make that shit hella good.", "author": "Rav G."}

The tomato sauce was perfect, pasta was al dente, and topped with lots of fresh basil. I'd definitely come back for this. \n\nThe appetizers fell a little flat. We had the burrata persimmon crustini and I felt it was lacking flavor. It wasn't seasoned and the fruit flavor wasn't strong enough with the cheese. We also had the kale salad which was just kind of boring. The kale wasn't massaged so it was hard to get through, and overall I just got kind of bored eating it. \n\nService started out good--we got our orders in quickly and food came out at a good pace. But the wait staff seemed to congregate towards the back of the restaurant so when we needed things like a fork which wasn't at our table, it took way too long to flag someone down, and when we finished our food, our plates were cleared quickly but then we didn't see anyone again for ten minutes to get the bill. \n\nSo overall, I would come back--I liked the vibe and the pasta was good.

The pizza was good, but the middle of it wasn't fully cooked or something. You really couldn't pick it up and eat it.

The initial impression was nice enough as the ambiance was modern and slightly hip.  Impressive Italian wine list to choose from, but was taken aback by the $25/bottle corkage fee for a casual atmosphere and modest menu.  To start, we recommend the burrata with figs and crostini which was very nice.  Also liked the cauliflower with capers; refreshing on a hot day in the city, and the olives were nice too.   The chopped salad, however, was disappointing.  Very little meat and cheese, but overloaded with red onion and red arugula rendering it unappetizing.  Presentation was also a mess.  For entrees, I enjoyed the fusilli pasta with pesto. While the mint is a very interesting and welcome compliment, some of my guests found it overpowering.   Additionally, the highly rated salami pizza was an unfortunate combination of being bland and very spicy at the same time.  Interesting hint of honey made it edible, but would not order again.

Generous portions with a charcuterie board, fun salads, cold appetizers, and your pick of main entrees among pizzas and pastas.

The food is delicious, but there were a few things that subtracted from the overall experience. \nBecause it was a busy weekend and we had a large group, they couldn't fit us in until 2:00. This wasn't a problem, because they said we could still get bottomless bellinis until 3:30, and we'd still get the brunch experience. That being said, though, it ended up feeling like they were annoyed we were there and it made us feel a bit rushed and uncomfortable. \nWe ordered off of the group dining menu, where we got to pick two appetizers & two entrees and you split those along with a salad with the whole table. We had to go over it a few times with our waitress to make sure that the portions were going to be enough for eight people, and we were assured that the portions were large and that it'd definitely be enough food. However, the portions were so small that each person could only take one bite (literally) from each dish in order for everybody to be able to share. \nWe ended up feeling unsatisfied with the amount and had to order another entree, which our waitress seemed reluctant to add because the kitchen was closing at 3:00. I guess they close the kitchen between brunch and dinner hours, which is perfectly fine, unless you're already having a late brunch and then when it arrives you get about 8 bites of food. \nI think for the group brunch, they need to make clear how many people it will actually serve. It doesn't list group sizes or portion sizes anywhere on the menu, and it really should be adjusted to have more when there is a larger group. We were under the impression that it would be a family style dining experience, rather than being a few regular sized entrees that we would all be expected to split. \nThat being said, I would like to go again with 2-4 people to see if that makes for a better experience. I know large groups can sometimes be tricky at restaurants, and the food was actually really good. (And I'll definitely get my own that I won't have to share next time!!)", "author": "Traci A."}

I wanted to try a new place, but I didn't want to pay Postmates' surge pricing, so I decided to try Uva Enoteca since they were on Caviar. We placed our delivery order on Monday, October 12th around 8:20pm. It arrived around 9:40pm. Prices below are what I paid ordering through Caviar. Looking at their online menu, Caviar is priced a little more than 7% higher.\n\n*Little gem salad (dinner): little gem lettuces with anchovy lemon dressing, radishes and grana padano ($13.95)\n*Pork and beef meatballs: served with ricotta salata, san marzano tomatoes and salsa verde ($16.05)\n*Salame pizza: spicy salami, mozzarella, pecorino, calabrian chili, san marzano tomatoes, red onions, no clover honey ($18.75)\n*Meatball pizza: mozzarella, san marzano tomatoes ($18.20), add Arugula (+$2.15), Calabrian chilis (+$2.15)\n\nI enjoyed the salad. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing had a nice lemony anchovy flavor. It was overdressed for me, but I love my greens, so it still complemented the pizzas well. The meatballs were a little one note in taste and kind of dry. And the sauce was really acidic. It was a little too sharp and sour for my taste. The pizzas were pretty good overall. The crust was thin, but soft with a nice chew. I liked the meatball pizza more, especially with the arugula. But they forgot to add the chilis which was a bummer (and a waste of about $3). The roommate liked the salami pizza more, but I could see why they normally have honey on that pizza. The salami was rather salty.\n\nNot the best pizza I've had, but for me, it was a better option than a place the roommate would have picked. At least the crust is on the thinner side. Everyone seems to rave about the charcuterie board. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I may give them another shot just for that.", "author": "Elena N."}

I've come here twice for dinner now and had two slightly different service experiences but food is always amazing. First time, I dined with a girl friend on Friday night, immediately seated at the bar area, great attentive service from the wine selection to the food pairing. We ordered the eggplant crostini, meatballs, argula salad and mozzarella pizza and delicious bottle from Montepulciano. Entirely too much food for two ladies (even 3 maybe), but so glad we got everything as it was sooo tasty. Fast forward to last weekend, dined here on a Saturday night 4 girls without reservation. I figured we'd have to wait an hour but we kept getting called back and told a table was ready when it actually wasn't which was annoying. Then once we sat at the bar, the guy working that night wasn't very knowledgeable on the wines and kind of had a \"whatever\" approach to recommendations. It also took forever for our wine to come out and then we felt really rushed to order. Again, with that said, the 4 of us ordered the a 3 meat and 3 cheese plate, the arugula salad and eggplant crostinis. As we were ordering meals as well, we should have only gone 2 meat and 2 cheese probably but everything is just soooo good! My friend and I split the squash pasta and the lasagna bolognese. Both were very tasty, noodles on the squash pasta were cooked perfectly; the lasagna was not my favorite as the meat sauce was really more of a bolognese so it was creamier rather than hearty meat. Just a personal preference I think. My other friend ordered the lasagna bolognese as well and loved it and another friend ordered the chopped salad which was huge and looked so tasty. I really do still love this place and think the prices are so great, will come back again, just make a reservation for more than 3, fit in a pizza and try to keep from over ordering!", "author": "Aryn C."}

I must admit, we were 8 people from out of town looking to feast on some good Italian food.  We were staying at Chateau Tivoli Bed and Breakfast nearby and I used Yelp to find a nearby Italian restaurant and I started walking to the first place because they didn't take reservations.  They told me that it would take over 90 minutes to get 8 of us in after 7:30pm.  I put our name on the list and searched Yelp again and I found this place and I started walking toward it. When I got to Uva Enoteca, it looked a bit small and I thought they wouldn't be able to get us in.  I decided to ask anyway and he said Yes. . I followed it up with how long would it be?  He said 15 minutes.  I looked around, the tables seemed full but I started contacting the others to let them know that I found a place to get us in. After 15 minutes, my party was there, we went in and they brought us into the back behind the bar where they had 2 tables set for 8. I was quite surprised.  \n\nThe staff here was very polite and took the time to explain the drink and food selection.  They only serve beer and wine.  I can make due without a margarita.  He told us that for parties of 6 or more, they offer a family style Italian dining experience for $30/person. That includes appetizers like fresh bread, cheese trays,  meat trays and olive trays to begin. They said we could order 2 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes along with dessert.  We decided to go for it. He also mentioned $25 each for all-you-can-drink beer, wine, soda (mix and match) which they wanted all or none to participate.  I was just drinking water with a couple others, so they decided to let some do the deal even though 100% of us weren't doing that. It was nice of them to flex for us. \n\nWe got the appetizers which we all enjoyed then it was time for the pizzas. We ordered the meatball pizza and the salami pizza. Since we had 8, they offered up another pizza, I chose a margarita pizza. All of the pizzas were delicious, the crust was perfect.  After that, we had the stuffed shells and the boar bolognaise lasagna.  We liked the shells a lot,  some of us thought the lasagna was just okay. The dessert was shared but we also had a birthday boy that got his own dessert. We all left the restaurant satisfied and full of good food.

Otherwise I would have given them \"5\" Stars.\n\n1) Happy Hour not posted on the web site.\n2) Happy Hour munchies are pretty darn limited. We had hoped to make a bit of a meal of HH food and drinks. Thankfully we stayed long enough to peruse the 5:00 Dinner menu.\n\nBrian, back up Bartender (Holly was on break when we arrived) was really sweet and very well informed of the HH wine's and let us try \"several\" before we made our final choices. Sadly I can't remember the wines we chose, I presume HH wines change, so I have an \"out\" to my fading memory.\n\nWe did try duck liver pate on toast points, which was absolutely lovely and very, very plentiful. So much so, we asked for \"extra toast points\" to spread the pate around.\n\nNext up a HH featured pasta dish with a slight tomato cream sauce.  Quite nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nMore wine please and Holly is back.  What a gem she is and Holly also knows her wines and again, let us try mini samples before we dove in.  I can say I had some lovely dry Whites and my friend had some yummy reds.  Again, names escape me. But don't think you can go wrong with anything you choose.\n\nFor our \"main meal\", like we needed more :-)....  We had one of the Pizzas, Kale, house-made fennel sausage, garlic, basil, pecorino, mozzarella.  It was De-lish and we finished every last little bite. I will say, the crust is quite thin and get's a tad \"soggy\" on the bottom, but the flavors were so good, you could look past the fact you needed a fork to eat the pizza.  Maybe it needs to be cooked just a tad more, not sure.\n\nA couple sitting next to us let us try their salad of Mixed kale, almonds, ricotta salata.  It was absolutely the bomb and so refreshing and light. The Kale was chopped perfectly so one did not struggle with the cutting / chewing part, which can often be the case with Kale.  I wish we had ordered that, but as you can see, we had \"plenty to keep us full and happy\".\n\nYummy and interesting food choices, pretty reasonably priced, neighborhood gem, wonderful service, a great place to just \"hang out at the bar\".", "author": "Marla B."}

Yes please!\n\nWe sipped our reds and chomped on some kale salad and roasted beets for starters. The kale was probably my favorite course of the meal. The kale was crunchy, the nuts on top added an extra layer of flavor, and it was perfectly dressed. The beets were tasty in combination with the ricotta, but I felt they could've been browned a little longer.\n\nFor entrees, we split an order of the pomedoro and the boat lasagna. The pomedoro was cooked al dente, and the sauce had a small bite to it, which was a welcome addition. I sprinkled a little more cheese on top which made the simple dish shine. The lasagna was presented beautifully, although I felt the actual flavors were a little flat. It was more meaty than starchy, so if you're looking for that entree that'll fill you up, this is the way to go.\n\nService was aight. Despite it being Super Bowl weekend and being the only table in the restaurant for the first 20 minutes, our server forgot our waters and table bread. When it came time to ordered, I tried to flag him down several times but he was out of sight usually.

What a cool name, even though the UVA is a little bit tainted if you've learned dermatology and this restaurant name kindles thoughts of broad-spectrum sunblock such as avobenzone.  Anyways, I'll begin my review because I'm sure few people reading this have questions about UV radiation on their mind right now, especially for anyone living in SF.\n\nUva Enoteca was a Yelp find, and there are a number of notable locations in the area.  It's N-Judah friendly, has non-impossible street parking, and is in an area of SF that's not too busy or sketchy.\n\nThe menu features a number of fancy-sounding Italian fare which seems quite authentic in cooking style, but adventurous in choice of ingredients.  (In Yelp categorization, I would call it Italian (New) and not fusion.)  \n\nFor 4 not-so-hungry girls on a grad school budget, we got:\n\nBoar Bolognese lasagna w / bechamel, grana padano $17: Tasty, but we're not really sure what made it distinctively boar.  (I wish I could make a pun about boarishness, but it was too refined-looking and not boarish :/)  To us, it tasted essentially the same as ground pork.  \n\nBaked Japanese eggplant w / san marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, ricotta salata, grana padano $17: This was our favorite!  Because Japanese eggplant is awesome and makes even authentic Italian dishes like eggplant parmesan way better.\n\nA pizza, ~$16: Apologies for the poor description, but after looking back-and-forth at my picture and the menu multiple times, I still couldn't figure out what we ordered.  It was a good pizza though, with the fluffy but thin crust, a mostly tomato based sauce, and toppings that gave it character.\n\nService was a bit frustrating because we got attention when unwanted and no attention when neede.  One of us got there much earlier so waited for the rest us at a table, but noticed that the staff seemed to be giving passive-aggressive glares even though the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  On the other hand, during our actual meal we had some problem flagging down servers when we needed them.  Meh... bumped down my 3.5 stars food-ambiance to 3 stars overall: so 4 stars if you look at restaurants Michelin style, 3 stars if you are influenced by service.", "author": "Edna C."}

I finished everything on my plate, I almost cleaned up the pan with some bread... \"Delicious\" is not enough to describe my feeling after having it, \"happy and satisfied\" would be more accurate:) \n\nI paired the food with a mid-body red wine recommended by my waiter, and I also sipped the wine from my friend, both are very good. \n\nI've seen my neighbors also ordered the same thing, and they devoured it very quickly!

However, the food turned out to be compelling enough on its own, and I'd definitely recommend it even to locals outside of the immediate neighborhood.\n\nThe four of us shared the boar bolognese lasagna, butternut squash rigatoni, and the kale/fennel sausage/mozzarella/pecorino/basil/garlic pizza. Of these, for me the butternut squash rigatoni (having breadcrumbs in this dish is genius--so good!) was most memorable, but I still thought everything was delicious.\n\nMy one gripe is that the portions are kind of small, but I guess it's NBD because if you still have some stomach space, Bi-Rite's not too far away. :)", "author": "Kelly R."}

The menu offers many vegetarian options in salad, pasta and pizza. \n\nLittle gems salad was light, refreshing although a bit bitter. \n\nThe stuffed shells came with four large pasta shells, filled with ricotta and spinach. It was very soft and easy to eat. We had a pizza to share as well, but I question whether four shells as a standalone entree is sufficient for the average person. \n\nThe roasted mushrooms pizza has a nice flavor - although it tasted almost exactly like the shells with all the cheese and tomato. Also, it was soggy in the center and when you hold a slice up, the tip drooped.. \n\nThe strawberry and mascarpone tart was not very sweet, which is good, since the mascarpone is heavier. They do make the tart in-house. As for the vanilla gelato - we only ordered it to go with the tart; it is not worth $8 as it is purchase from elsewhere and was not very special.. they added too much sea salt to it as well. \n\nOverall, a nice local spot for comfort Italian food, attentive service.", "author": "K.

When we had decided on coming here though, I actually laughed to myself (I'm not crazy...just a funny guy) - I had JUST bookmarked them to try! \n\nWhile it's unclear to me if Uva Enoteca is a wine bar that serves food, or a restaurant with a great wine program, either could be right since they blend the food and wine together so well.  Although I can't recall his name, our server gave us some great recommendations on the food and on an awesome bottle of wine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ).\n\n- MEAT BOARD (Six Choices) - Hot Coppa, Speck, Bresaola...Three for $15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#qPlVNB8CiOjOcsoPuZVelw)\nMmm...meaty goodness.  My favorite was the Bresaola - very flavorful with legit heat to it.  The Hot Coppa had a nice smoky, spiciness (though not as spicy as the Bresaola), but the Speck was just okay (reminded me of smoked honey baked ham).\n\n- CHEESE BOARD (Seven Choices) - Brinata (sheep), Bermuda Triangle (goat), Grana Padano (cow)...Three for $14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#HarY79jBAdzyQvVMAEnhsw)\nMmm...cheesey goodness.  While Jenny K. loved the Bermuda Triangle (kinda gamey/bleu cheese-ish), I liked the Brinata better - super creamy texture and a taste that fell between goat cheese and cow cheese.  However, we both agreed that the Grana Padano wasn't worth it.  Not bad, but I'd try something else.\n\n- PORK AND BEEF MEATBALLS with Ricotta Salata, Tomato, and Salsa Verde...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#wlH3JR8IGHfhSsyvao9FXQ)\nQuite simply, it didn't stand out.  It looked great on the dish, but the flavor left me wanting more, whether it be more of a savory flavor or herbs/seasoning.  Good enough to satisfy, but didn't make an impression either.\n\n- SPICY SALAME, MOZZARELLA, CHILIS, AND SAN MARZANO TOMATOES PIZZA...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#gT3sYxPMMvW2GvZ2zK-zPg)\nWhere the Meatballs fell short, the Pizza excelled.  The crust doesn't quite approach my favorites, but everything on top of it packed a punch.  The salame and sauce (surprising for me) were great, but I wish it had more cheese!\n\n- LAVENDER & THYME PANNA COTTA with Blood Orange Compote...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uva-enoteca-san-francisco?select=jEUJtJOCns9y76i3oKWhuQ#rLiPD_bcx2W0blB4zOqsvg)\nMy least favorite dish.  The panna cotta had a great consistency/texture, and I liked how subtle the lavender was, but the thyme was too strong.  The blood orange helped to freshened up the dish, but it was too bitter to strike a good sweet/sour balance.\n\nSince the place is somewhat modest in size, reservations would be best (especially on Fri/Sat nights), or at least to come early/late the heavy dinner crowds.  In either case, make sure you allot enough time for parking as well since parking in the area can be scarce.  Maybe we'll even see each other!  I definitely plan on coming back for the charcuterie and cheese boards.  Plus, it makes for a great date spot as well!  ;)", "author": "Mike L."}

This place isn't very big. \n\nWe ordered family style from one of their prix fixe menu things for groups, and ended up paying per person.\n\nCheese and Meats - The cheese plate was definitely very delicious, and this is where most of the stars come from. Delicious cheeses, and the cured meats were pretty good too. The assortment was not really enough for everybody, but I guess it's only an app, so they want us to save room for the rest of the food coming out. This was the best part of the whole meal though.\n\nSalad - Par.\n\nPizzas - The pizzas were not spectacular. One came out slightly burnt actually. They were not memorable, nor that flavourful. Meh, wouldn't recommend this at all.\n\nPastas - Two pasta dishes came out, I honestly don't remember which ones they were. I enjoyed them though. They were very mediocre though. They weren't good nor great, but they weren't bad. Came out perfectly al dente. Some people thought it was undercooked, but I promise you it wasn't. \n\nDessert - Everybody loved the desserts. Lemon & olive oil cake, apple chutney, vanilla gelato and Chocolate budino w/ caramel sauce, whipped cream & marcona almonds. The budino is very very rich, so keep that in mind when ordering. Despite not enjoying desserts that much, these desserts were pleasant. \n\nWines - Severely over priced. I wouldn't recommend it. We ordered a few bottles of different wines. There was maybe one wine that was worth the 50 dollar price tag, but the other bottles, honestly lacked depth and complexity. That \"2009\" on it doesn't necessarily mean much, nor does the $45 price tag on it. Beer pricing seems better, but we didn't order beer.\n\nService... there wasn't really any service. Very lackluster. \n\nI think it was okay to try once. The cheese and cured meats are worth a potential return, but honestly the rest of it killed the experience. I'm sure you can find other places with decent to good cheeses and cured meats with more affordable wine and better service. Not recommended and probably won't return.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

The antipasti was so good that we were full from that and the salami and cheese (the corn, chickpea crostini, prosciutto, humboldt's fog were faves). The pizza was as good as I remembered but the boar bolognese tasted like it changed from last year. And unfortunately, my favorite dish, the caccio e pepe is no longer on the menu.\n\nThe dessert was heavenly - ice cream with some sort of chocolate caramel cream concoction.

Everything was great, simple, clean ingredients that taste great, you know exactly what's in the dish, no surprises or sophistication but just great Italian food.\n\nThe portions were nice, great for sharing, the beets were sweet, the lamb sausage spicy, the pizza just out of the oven.  Yummy!\n\nMy husband ordered the chocolate mouse, even though we were full, he was craving something sweet.  It was perfect, not too sweet, great flavor, and yes I'm a chocolate lover, specifically bitter sweet. \n\nA few things to maybe smooth out, the food came out really fast, it could have been spaced out better, especially since the table was small and it was hard to maneuver. \n\nThe place was also a bit stuffy, and it was a cold night out.  That I didn't like at all, I luckily wore layers, but sitting in tank top and being warm is not a great atmosphere, they need ventilation.  \n\nI definitely recommend to give this place a try, whether you're on a date or out with friends, or just want to sit at the bar.

Fortunately, I had thought to make reservations before arriving, so we didn't have to wait in line. However, we waited at the door for someone to seat us for about 15 minutes.

The server forgot milk for my coffee and was not very attentive (water glasses were empty for long stretches of time). Again, I figured they were short-staffed, so I understand that things get busy, but we still didn't have that great of an experience.\n\nLastly, when the food came out, it was very poorly cooked. I got the frittata, which was small, dry and flavorless. My friend got the baked eggs with tomatoes, and the eggs were WAY overcooked. The yolks were completely hard on the inside and there was a plasticky film on the bottom of the eggs where they had been fried for too long. I looked over at another table and it looked like their eggs were a little better cooked, so I guess it's hit-or-miss, but I was just surprised that they would be okay serving such inconsistent dishes. The sauce tasted can-like as well.

Walking to our table, I immediately appreciated how Uva Enoteca makes great use of its space. The restaurant is small and charming, but we didn't feel like we were sitting on top of anyone.\n\nThe wine selection was a bit limited, and the price floor for bottles was on the higher side (~$50). That said, the two bottles we ordered were fantastic. We ordered a few appetizers for the table (bresaola, persimmons with burrata, chickpea crostina: all delicious), and each couple split a pasta and a secondi. In my and my girlfriend's case, we shared the puttanesca, which I'd give a solid B, and the meatballs, which I'd give an A-. We couldn't resist dessert, which ended up being a budino and an affogato. Both desserts were nothing short of excellent. All of the food, maybe minus the puttanesca, I would absolutely recommend. \n\nThe meal was perfect, made even better by great company, great service, and a great atmosphere.

After all, we DID plan to spend a lot of time here since we were looking forward to ordering a whole bottle of wine. \n\nMade reservations and had no problems getting seated within a couple minutes. Our server/hostess was super friendly and she definitely made our experience here much less intimidating (must I remind you that I'm NOOOO wine connoisseur!). She was very attentive when asking what sorts of wine we usually enjoy - whether we prefer light/heavy, acidic/mellow, etc + even gave us samples of the anglionico and cannonau to tend to our EXTREME indecisiveness (so sorry!). Totally give her props for being so patient and accommodating! \n\nWe were all a bit full from dinner, so we decided to just pair our wine with some cured meats. Tried 3 per recommendations -- Speck (my favorite), Salame Rosetta, and Coppa Dolce - umbria. All were fantastic; the meats were moist, well-spiced, and delicate enough to practically melt in your mouth!\n\nYou might run into trouble when finding parking on Fri/Sat butttttt I'd still come back for ya, UVA.

It was probably because they weren't very busy but still nice of them to do so. \n\nWe ordered family style and got to try several different plates. The biscuit and gravy was good, it was one of my friend's faves. Other plates included meatball sandwich, ham pizza, bacon, French toast, some potato in red tomato sauce and some others. I really liked how some plates came with a side of arugula salad. The French toast was pretty big and looked more like a big plate of dessert to us so we saved that for last. \n\nAll in all everything was pretty good but I wouldn't say anything really was a favorite. One of their big attractions is probably the endless Bellini's for 2.5 hours. They're really awesome at keeping you topped off too. \n\nParking can be a doozie here.

A++ on the appetizer! The sweet figs with balsamic and herbs were so amazing alone, and the burrata it just set it completely over. I would highly recommend this. The ginger soda tasted pretty watered down. Maybe they're going for a subtle ginger taste but I would have preferred it to be stronger. \n\nMy friend ordered the boar lasagna and I got the pizza with proscuitto, mozzarella and ricotta. I had a bit of the lasagna - tasted delicious! She ate the whole thing too which is impressive because she's little :)\n\nPizza was a different story. It was okay but as I ate the middle started to get soggy so the point of each piece was droopy with toppings falling off. I don't think anyone enjoys a flaccid piece of pizza. And also the proscuitto - it tasted like store-bought deli ham. I'm not uppity about food but I was expecting something a bit more impressive from this place.\n\nLastly we go the chocolate bundino for dessert. OMG. This was so good. I had no idea what we were ordering, but it's like a super thick custard/pudding with whipped cream, caramel and crunchy goodness.

They give you 4 different price points so you can try one, three, five or all seven of the cured meats. We ordered the $29 board for 7 choices: Prosciutto di Parma, speck (spicy prosciutto), two different kinds of salumi, mortadella, hot coppa and Bresaola. I may not know Italian very well, but when it comes to salted meats, I am fluent in it.  My favorite of the bunch was the hot coppa -- rich on the palette with hint of spiciness. The Bresaola had a gorgeous deep purple color and loved the cinnamon-y spice it had. They provided us with lots of sliced bread (wish it was a plain baguette instead of the weird bread with dried cherries baked in them which did not go well with the charcuterie) Also, more condiments should be offered such as pickled onions or even cornichons, instead of just the whole grain mustard.  Nevertheless, generous servings filled up all six of us even before our entrees came.\n\nNow, I like all things pasta, but their pasta here --- not the best I've had. I ordered the wild boar ragu with orecchiette pasta but the burnt top made the dainty pasta shells unappetizing. I think they meant to just toast the cheese until it's bubbly, but my friend got the exact same dish and his was too burnt as well. I still dug in and maybe took 4 bites and took the rest of it home. (no, it didn't taste better the next day either) My friends had better luck with their pizzas and other pasta dishes.\n\nDesserts were a vanilla gelato topped with olive oil-sea salt and a pear and anise sorbet. The sorbet wasn't icy enough to be a sorbet, but it had a good anise flavor topped with candied nuts. Also, one dessert should be enough for two people, since they actually give you 3 huge scoops of gelato, the most generous I've seen thus far at an Italian resto.\n\nOur server was good, she made helpful recommendations on navigating their wine list which is filled with Italian varietals. The winery name escapes me but we had a bottle of Sangiovese for only $33 so the mark-up wasn't that bad. She was funny as well and kept on with the corny jokes: \"what do gay horses eat?!\"  Haaayyyy!!

There actually aren't too many restaurants in the Lower Haight neighborhood I'd suggest, but I just tried this place out on Saturday and I'd definitely recommend! So if you're looking for a cozy dinner with friends or a good date night, head on over to Uva Enoteca.\n\nA friend and I decided to go here Saturday afternoon, and I was able to go online and make an OpenTable reservation for just a few hours later - impressed! When we arrived at 6:30, the place was nearly empty, but as the night wore on it filled right up. We sat at a 2 person table in the back of the restaurant, and the atmosphere was perfect. It felt lively, but wasn't so loud we couldn't hold a decent conversation across the table. The service was also excellent - our waitress checked in regularly, didn't judge us for bringing a cheapish bottle of wine to a wine bar (or at least, I don't think she did), and also made some great cheese plate recommendations. By the way, if you bring your own wine, corkage fee is $18.\n\nBetween the two of us we ordered one pasta dish and the 3-cheese selection cheese plate - Humboldt Fog, La Tur, and a Provolone. Our server actually suggested the provolone and I asked her if it was too mild (I was imagining the kind of provolone you get on a deli sandwich - flavorless). Although I preferred the other two cheeses, it was still delicious and nice to have a variety of flavors. The cheese plate also comes with fig jam, honey, and roasted almonds. Overall really nice! For the pasta, we ordered the puttanesca bianca, and it was okay - I didn't love it. It was nicely spicy, but other than that there just wasn't enough going on. I would have proffered more vegetables in there or something! The pizzas also looked good, so if I come back, I might go for that instead. \n\nI imagine this spot is also nice for a wine and cheese happy hour, which I'd love to come back to try someday.", "author": "Lindsey B."}

One for Brunch and one for Dinner, so I can review both services. :)\n\nFirst, the brunch mimosa deal was good! I forgot what we paid, but it was botomless. I think it was $12 pp but don't quote me. My boyfriend's meal was great, but I ordered the Margarita pizza and it was not so good. It came out completely doughy. The sauce and cheese looked good, but they also cooked the fresh basil on the pizza. The basil is supposed to go on either after it comes out or only for the last couple minutes. That I could have lived with if the pizza dough wasn't mushy.\n\nThe server asked how our meal was and I told her. She very kindly said she would have another one made. Unfortunately, the second pizza was burnt on the bottom and still doughy. At this point I was starving and ate it anyway. I felt like I had to considering i was there on a LS deal anyway. She asked again, and I politely told her that I think they may need to cook the pizza longer at a lower temp (just a suggestion, I knew something needed to be changed). She handled it so well and without any frustration. She also took the pizza off the bill without any request from me. We tipped her over 20% on the original amount. \n\nNow, for dinner service I went with a friend. We got the happy hour wine and a few of the happy hour specials (food and drinks about $2-$3 cheaper than normal). The food was good, the pizza was cooked better (friend insisted despite my guidance against), and the server was friendly. He said we couldn't combine the LS deal with HH prices. I was a little let down, but didn't make any fuss. We asked if he could just charge us the regular price and use the LS. he did that.

I never get to try the cheese and meat apps, but i do love the Olives.  I think their menu is always changing also.  This time i had the pasta pomodoro, it was pretty plain.  But i do remember have a very delicious pasta the last time i was here.  I think this place is a really hit or miss with their menu.  \n\nI really want to try their meat and cheese appetizers, definitely a place for a foodie or someone that loves Italian wines.  I love having the lambrusco here, its a red chilled sparkling wine, it is to die for.  Unfortunately this time they were out of their Lambrusco, so i settled with a lovely glass of prosecco. \n\nTheir tarts are also delicious, my favorite tart that they had so far is the strawberry tart.  \nDefinitely worth a try, maybe more in the summer.  \n\nThey're also very quick and efficient.

This is not your standard spaghetti and meatballs type of place and neither is it innovative for difference's sake.  They make highly focused dishes with quality ingredients and simple, unpretentious presentation.  For me Uva stands out as one of the best italian restaurants in the city not because of creativity or originality (like Cotogna in North Beach), but rather because of fantastic execution and attention to detail.  Perfect sauces, pizzas that give nearby Ragazza a run for its money, refreshingly delicious vegetable dishes and perfectly sized portions.  A gem.\n\nThe only downside I can muster up has to do with the way the menu is structured.  Be wary of going here with a group if some members of your party are super picky or don't like sharing.  The menu really works best if you're sharing and otherwise can be a bit confusing and intimidating.

The stand out dishes for me was one of the cheeses they served during the appetizer (I believe it was a Gouda cheese with truffle) seriously the best cheese I've ever had, the spicy salami pizza and the pesto pasta that was served.

I feel that maybe it would've been in my best interest to lower my standards before I went here because I have never been so disrespected by a waiter in my entire life.  Having been in the food service industry for years prior and being someone who loves to dine out religiously nationally and internationally, I understand there are good and bad days, however I was not expecting this.  \n\nOur waiter was aggressive, disrespectful, and egotistical.  He challenged questions I and my friends had about the food and the wine menu.  The sequence in which the food and wine were brought to the table as well as when the to go boxes were presented was super sloppy and unprofessional.  Our water rarely every refilled our water, let alone our wine.  We asked the front desk person if they could bring out a slice of cake and candle for my friend because it was her birthday, offering to pay for it of course, and that never came.  All in all an utter disappointment! \n\nHonestly, if our server said \"I'm sorry, I am new/totally slammed, forgive me if things come out as they are ready or for me being short with you\" my friends and I would've totally understood and would've appreciated the honesty but instead we left disappointed, underwhelmed and quite frankly pissed. \n\nWho knows maybe it was this servers first day and felt overwhelmed and didn't know how to handle things.  I am not sure.  But what I am sure about is that I think this restaurant should be a lot more selective at who they decide to represent their establishment and maybe set the bar a lot higher when hiring.

The Haight has an abundance of dining hot spots but Uva Enoteca has a little something that makes it special.  While the dinner entrees are limited, what you really come here for are the endless variations of cured meats and cheese platters.  If you're not ordering that, then you've missed the point of the whole place.\n\nWe chose a platter of three cured meats (carne, prosciutto cotto, and soppressata) and three cheeses (formaggio miele, pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The meats are cut ever so thin.  It's almost sheer. It simply melts in your mouth.  It is sublime to say the least.  The soppressata was my personal favorite as it was so flavorful.  The cheeses were all spectacular.  You are offered condiments such as honey, jam, etc. to enjoy them with.  Ask your server for advice on which cheese suits which condiment best.  When they are paired perfectly, your mouth will burst with an explosion of perfect, harmonious flavors.  I would have to say that Uva's cheese platters outmatch the cheese course at one of my favorite San Francisco fine dining restaurants.  It is that good!\n\nI could describe the entrees we had but honestly, the entrees pale in comparison to the cured meats and cheeses so I won't even bother.  One of the best parts of Uva Enoteca is that they also let you order wines in two ounce pours.  Now why didn't people think of that before?  You can try different wines with different meats or cheeses.  More importantly, you aren't stuck with having to drink something that didn't quite suit your palate.", "author": "Chrys S."}

Asked for a wine recommendation since everything seemed really Italian and not to my understanding (also the wine list was extremely long) and he got us a really great glass of wine. We also ordered the burrata with eggplant starter which was DELICIOUS. It had green olives and some herbs on top and it was so good.\n\nWe got 2 entrees: the spicy salame pizza and the meatballs. I LOVED the pizza, no complaints about it at all. The crust was even delectable. The meatballs were sweeter than I imagined and weren't my favorite thing but I liked them and I liked how soft they were. My boyfriend LOVED them though.\n\nIt was really full on a Wednesday night so to avoid waiting we sat at the bar which we are okay with. The wait for the food was a bit long but the waiter/bartender was very apologetic which was nice because we werent even really that bothered - the wait wasn't that long. He said the wait was a bit long because they just started doing some waiter-to-go service that day so things were a bit hectic. But I thought it was cool that they were starting that service and will keep that in mind next time we dont feel like braving the cold weather but want some bomb ass Italian food.", "author": "Alexandra W."}

Paired with some mushrooms, cauliflower and cubes of meat, the taste wasn't bad, but it just wasn't to my liking I guess...\n2) Mushroom, pink sauce pasta: The pasta was like swollen spaghetti noodles. Kinda weird because it's so thick...almost like it's an udon noodle. The sauce was good, but again, not my cup of tea. \n3) Cheese and Meat appetizer: The cube of cheese was SO SMALL, it was literally like the size of a quarter! The meat was pretty good though! Had really nice flavoring. Not sure what meat or cheese we ordered but the cheese was a rip off because you got so little of it! \n\nAmbiance: \nCute place. The restaurant is longer than it is wide...so the front of the restaurant looks super small because of it's narrow width, but since it's really deep, it can actually sit a lot of customers. There's a bar with bar seating and just regular table seating. The place looks very new and edgy. Great for groups or dates. \n\nService: \nThe waiters don't have regular uniforms so they are seriously wearing normal, casual clothing so it was difficult to tell at times if the person was a waiter or just a normal customer/person walking towards your table. That kinda made things a little awkward. \n\nPrice: \nA bit pricey and you don't get a lot of food...\n\nOverall: \nNot too impressed with this place.

It's pretty close to my house, and they have a unique twist to their food, which I like.  However, I don't frequent much, because dishes like pasta and salad I usually do myself.  (I'm not the biggest pizza fan - for some reason I can eat cheesy pasta, but not cheese on pizza).  \n\nFor brunch, they have bottomless bellini's, which is pretty cool. French toast yummy. Fried eggs yummy (and cool that it comes with a salad for breakfast) and they used to have a pork fussilli pasta breakfast dish (I don't see it on the menu now) but that was different and tasty. All of them are different than your usual weekend brunch spot, and I like that.\n\nFor dinner, we've had salads which were yummy and pasta ragu and pasta cacio e pepe. We tried the ragu because everyone was talking about. It was okay, but nothing great. My bf and I both liked the cacio e pepe a lot more, and it was on their HH for like $8.  I think a lot of people come here for small dishes/cheeses, but I'm a little lactose, so I can't comment on that. They have a lot of small dishes, though.  What I did try (bc they had it on HH) was the lentils, and they were cold. I wish I would've known that. My bf and I didn't like them.\n\nDesserts - I'd steer away from, unless your really having the urge. I think they save things for a pretty long time, and the dessert I got was pretty stale. I still ate it, it wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't do it again.\n\nServers/bartenders are super friendly, and from what I saw knowledgeable about the wines.  The one server did give us 'too much time' alone (which stinks when your trying to ask for something) but the boy bartender brings back some points.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back, probably for breakfast than for dinner.

Didn't come back for over 2 years, and can't remember what the boyfriend and I ate or drank.\n\nSecond time - boyfriend and I wandered in when everything was packed with drunk idiots for Bay to Breakers, and needed to take cover from the stumbling and bumbling masses. Coppa pizza for myself, and spicy salami pizza for the boyfriend. Mouth Orgasm. Body Orgasm. Why had we ignored this place for 2 years?\n\nThird time, one week later - Wanted to recreate Mouth/Body Orgasm experience. Ordered the same pizzas as a week earlier because we are old and like routine. This time I got a fancy drink off the happy hour menu because I was feeling crazy. Pizzas seemed half-cooked, and cheese covered only the center third of the pizza. Where the heck was the meat this time? And why was I charged full price for a happy hour drink? And why is Open Table scolding me as a no-show? Confusion sets in.\n\nFourth time, last night - Utter despair. Ordered the same 2 pizzas again, goddamn, are we old and boring. Boyfriend openly weeps at table, draft beers seem to have been removed from menu. Coppa pizza is burnt on top, and completely uncooked throughout. Why the hell is it so spicy? Spicy salami pizza is completely uncooked, burnt on top. And why isn't it spicy? It wasn't until today that we realized f-ing Uva mixed up the toppings (boyfriend ate the leftovers). The coppa pizza came with apples (normal) and spicy salami (not normal). The spicy salami came with coppa (not normal).\n\nThis place is a nightmare.

In fact, I wanted to love it because of the atmosphere and the incredible service. So let's start there. \n\nCute place you walk into that takes you away from the lower Haight and changes the vibe immediately. Greeted by a nice hostess and then waited on by a server that seemed to be picking up a lot of slack from being under-staffed. She still made sure we had excellent service and spent plenty of time with us to answer questions.\n\nI'm not going to critique the wine because I honestly am not the kind of person that should. I wanted their reasonably priced Chianti ($30-40 something or other), but they were out of it and the server made a few other suggestions. I'll just say that I wasn't a fan of whatever it was we got, but my girlfriend was pleased and as a guy that's all that matters at the end of the day.\n\nBurrata on farro, honey, persimmons, and pomegranate was very good.  I think it was the best thing we had the entire night.\n\nLamb & Sausage on skewers - This was a fine dish that had a lot of flavor with the polenta and the glaze/suce they put on the meat. I would recommend this if you decide on going here.\n\nAuttuno - Their Autumn pasta with butternut squash sauce is probably one of the most bland things we've ever tasted. It literally was devoid of any flavor beyond the shreds of speck they added in. We politely asked if we could order anything else as a replacement and without hesitation the server said \"Of Course\" and brought us back a menu.\n\nSpicy salame pizza -  We ordered this as a replacement to my gfs Autunno pasta thinking this would be a safe bet as it had simple classic flavors on the menu. The pizza crust was like a cracker and the cheese tasted as if it came from a Little Caesars $5 pizza. We wanted to stop complaining so we ate a couple slices, told the waiter it was delicious, and boxed the rest to go so not to waste more food and gave it away after we left. \n\nWe wanted to like this place, but the pasta and pizza were so bad we just can't see ourselves trying to spend another $110-120 just to give it another shot. Maybe it was just an off night and you will have better luck next time around. It truly does have a lot of potential, but I'm also not one of those people that believes in \"You just ordered the wrong thing\".

Burrata--nice and gooey with the crunch of the seeds and toasted nuts.\n\nFor mains, this is where we got a little disapointed.  For some reason a majority of us were interested in the spicy salame pizza, which was OK but not great.  The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste and lacked the zest I enjoy.  My friend had the pasta with garlic, basil and tomato, which was done well. Overall, I'd say it was a decent experience (good service etc) so I would come here for wine and apps but dinner...not so much.", "author": "Namita A."}

Apparently the 'mirror' on the right side of the restaurant is not a mirror but another side of the restaurant. \n\nSo i don't know shit about wine and I immediately began to bombard our server with random facts about myself, \"I like flavor. but i dont want it to be too strong. I dont like Cabs. I dont know anything about wine. help. You pick.\" I'm sure I was just throwing out a bunch of contradictions and if i were him i would be annoyed.  Anyways, he ended up recommending a red wine that of course I don't even know what it was called, but I was happy with it. \n\n3 meats for $15, 3 cheeses for $15. The prosciutto was my favorite, we also got speck and this pepperoni looking thing. The speck (pork belly) kinda just tasted like ham, it wasn't really special in my opinion.  I'm sure the cured meat gods are frowning upon me now, but whatever. \n\nService was great, i wish i remembered what his name was. Checked on us several times, i'm also allergic to dairy so he made sure the 'pepperonis' didn't have milk in it. \n\nI want to add that we were seated at a table that was ment for two, and it was quite cramped. Especially with all the fancy wine paraphernalia filling our table, i kinda felt like a bull in a china shop. I guess his spidey-senses noticed that somehow, and he gave me the wine on the house! I was honestly thinking of saying something about it not being on the bill, but quite frankly i'm hella broke and could use a break.  But anyways, much appreciated! If it wasn't for his nice gesture I probably wouldn't have gone out of my way to write this review on the place.", "author": "Randy N."}

The atmosphere is nice, very cozy feel and it's a good place to have a conversation since you can actually hear each other. We had the following: \n\nVenetian cauliflower - we got this based on recommendation from our waiter (it was this or the Brussels sprouts from the vegetable section). First bite was great and had a burst of flavor, the cauliflower is almost pickled in a vinaigrette with shallots, raisins, and capers. However, as I took additional bites it became increasingly sour and despite loving sour food, I had to stop because it was a bit too much. \n\nSpicy salame pizza - this was good, a bit like a pepperoni pizza. It wasn't the best thing in the world but definitely a safe and tasty choice.\n\nRoasted pork loin - the brussels sprouts and bacon wrapped dates in this tasted great, but the pork loin itself was underwhelming. Wasn't particularly flavorful, and was just pink and \"porky\" tasting. \n\nI also wish the staff would have sold us a little more on the food. I feel like the food may be prepared in unique ways or using less common ingredients (I saw a bag of malted flour on my way to the restroom) and that is not conveyed through the menu so it would have been helpful if someone would have talked us a little bit through things, especially after we told our waiter it was our first time there. \n\nOverall, perhaps we just picked the wrong items, but it wasn't a compelling enough experience and we probably will not be back.", "author": "Linda L."}

This was when the appalling conversation with the impetuous ginger waiter ensued.\n\nWaiter: I said it was last call.\nMe: I understand, but we ordered bottomless.\nWaiter: Well, we are closing early today because of the baseball game.  We don't want people coming in and ordering bottomless at the last moment.\nMe: Yes, but your website said you have bottomless on Sundays until 2:30 pm and it's barely 2:00pm.\nWaiter: Well, we say it's bottomless, but it's really bottomless to a point. You guys already had 2 carafes, which is a great deal.\nMe: Fine, we are alcoholics, okay? Don't market \"bottomless\" when you mean \"bottomless to a point.\"  If you were closing early, you should've told us when we walked in.  It doesn't matter anyway.  You're not the owner; there's no use complaining to you.\nWaiter: Well, I'm the bar manager.\nMe:  Good for you. We'll just stop in a bar on the way home.\n\nIn the end, the waiter/bar manager charged us for a single mimosa instead of bottomless.  He probably would've made more money by simply refilling our glasses.\n\nBottom line: Awesome food, but if you see a ginger waiter with specs, perhaps it's best to come back another time, because he will refuse to refill you with a hefty side of attitude. The food was spectacular, but I can't give it any more than 2 stars due to the ridiculous server.", "author": "Sherry C."}

Having enjoyed a Kerner just the week before we went that way, and while it was a little sweeter than the previous bottle we had it was definitely enjoyed.\n\nI loved the top of the menu rife with meat, cheese, and veggie options. We selected some cheeses, green beans and lentils. The veggies were fresh and lightly seasoned/dressed.

The food is good, and interesting... but not to-die-for.  \n\nThe menu is really confusing, and when we asked the server the first time I was there (for dinner) how much food we should order, she told us to get wayyyy too much food.  We were stuffed to capacity and had tons of leftovers.  With a bit of a high price tag, it seems uncool to recommend that your customers order way more food than they need.  But hey, at least the food was pretty good.\n\nThe second time I came it was for happy hour, after checking out yelp and seeing tons of great reviews.  My mom and my Aunt were in town, and I thought they'd like it because of the extensive wine list and good happy hour prices.  The happy hour menu just says \"Vino - $4\" for wine, so my mom asked the server if the house wine was just red, or if they had white too.  \n\nHe responded that it was NOT the house wine (rude!), but he would check and see \"what he had open.\"  Now, I know happy hour is often the time to get customers to drink wines that aren't top shelf, or before they go bad, but you could at least act like it was not the dregs at the bottom of the bottle.  \n\nWhen he returned, he said they had a dry muscat.  Being personally concerned that muscats often tend on the very sweet side, and having made the mistake of ordering a wine that was described as a \"dry\" muscat, only to find it very sweet, I asked if the wine was sweet.  Rudely, he responded. \"It's DRY.\"  Okay, I know what dry means; I'm not an idiot.  But even if I did not know what dry meant, it's no reason to be rude to me, a paying customer.\n\nThe bottom line is this: a generally enjoyable place, but weird, semi-rude servers.

Although full of flavor from carmelized onions and artichoke hearts, the wild boar ragu with orecchiette (small ear-shaped pasta) was not served as hot as one would expect for such a hearty dish.  \n\nWhile friendly, service was a bit confused:  the hostess was unsure how to seat our reservation and had to find someone else to show her how to use the Open Table application; all the dishes arrived en masse, rather than being served in courses as one would expect; and it was hard to get the waiter's attention to order additional wine.\n\nAs one might expect, the standout at Uva Enoteca is the well-priced, exclusively Italian wine list.  Prices range from under $30 to only slightly more than $100, with the vast majority concentrated in the $40-$50 range -- almost unheard of in pricey SF.  Also rare were the knowledgeable recommendations from the server:  he was able to suggest multiple wine selections to complement each dish and could describe wines and their production methods in detail.\n\nAll in all, Uva Enoteca provided a nice, casual dining experience and a chance to try some little known Italian wines.  With a little polishing of basic service, the establishment could turn in to a stella brillando (shining star) of wine bars in The City.", "author": "CJ G."}

Some of my favorites are the verdure.  I have no idea what \"verdure\" means and I refuse to Google it, but I imagine it means something like \"delicious vegetables that make you happy.\"  In particular, the roasted carrots, marinated mushrooms, and Brussels sprouts are fantastic.  On the leafy greens front, they have a zucchini and arugula salad that is mind blowing.  Then there are the pizzas which are among the best in the city.  The pizzas have always been good, but recently they somehow improved upon them with a few tweaks to the recipe.  Finally their wine list is great, and the staff are knowledgeable enough to help a shlub like me get a tasty glass every time.\n\nSpeaking of the staff, I am consistently amazed by how friendly and helpful they are.  They're superhumanly attentive, and always ready to offer a useful suggestion.  Aside from being awesome people who are good at what they do, everyone who works at Uva is also beautiful.

Maybe it's because I can recall going there about ten years ago and seeing the same menu (wild boar ragout, anyone?) and the same decor, but the place feels dated and in need of a facelift. It has that tried and true somewhat tired feel that EOS in Cole Valley had in its last days before closing. Nothing wrong with tradition -- I love the House of Prime Rib. But a menu that was edgy last decade inherently does not age as well as standard fare. I realized I was over this place at the end of my last experience there when the server copped an attitude at check out time. First he ignored us and the end of the meal when we needed the check. Then he neglected to bring us our change. After ten minutes or more of waiting, I tracked him down. His unforgivable, unprofessional response? I didn't think you wanted your change.

I was meeting some friends here during my last trip to San Francisco, and it is definitely a good choice for smaller groups. They were very accommodating, the plates are the perfect size for sharing, and there is pretty easy parking in the Haight, at least at the time we arrived.\n\nThis is a wine bar as well as a restaurant, so those who know me, know how much I love my wine fix. They had lots to choose from and our waitress was very knowledgeable on recommending wines. The prices were completely reasonable considering the pours were larger than normal, I think they were about 8 oz, and the price was around $8-$10 per glass. \n\nWe started with a lentil appetizer which was just OK, and also some pepperoni pizza. It wasn't exactly pepperoni, because this restaurant is more sophisticated than that, but it had that kind of taste and was really good. We also ordered the pasta with a sort of pecorino cheese white sauce and pepper. This may have been my favorite dish. I absolutely loved it and the pepper was not overkill, it just added the perfect amount of pizzaz to the dish. Highly recommend.\n\nWe also ordered a side of brussel sprouts as well an eggplant dish. Both were great sides. The eggplant had an unusual flavor but was excellent all the same. \n\nThe Boscaiola is a great pasta dish, and it has goat cheese in it. Anything with goat cheese, in my opinion, is a winner. We also ordered the Fregula, which I am blanking on a bit but I do remember it had an unusual taste to it as well. It has an interesting array of ingredients, including pomegranate, pecorino, and pistachios.\n\nNo matter what you order, I don't think you can miss at this restaurant.

I got there early so I decided to go in and enjoy a glass of wine for happy hour.  They had a sign outside advertising wine for happy hour for $5, which sounded great.  When I got in to the bar, I learned that they only have prosecco for happy hour.  Although I do like sparking wines on occasion, I felt the sign was a misleading.  And, who in the City offers a happy hour special on wine and does not even have a red, even if it is some generic house red?\n\nI was really hard to get waited on at the bar.  The surely bartender, who seemed to the owner or manager, was doing other things in the back and did not seem interested in the bar patrons at all.  When my friend showed up and we were ready to go to the table, I asked the host if he could transfer my bar tab to the table since there was no one there to settle up with.  The host said no and so I had to stand at the bar for 5 minutes talking to my friend until the bartender/manager finally came back.\n\nThe table that we had was in the back.  Cozy is definitely the word for the layout.  The whole place is not huge. It does feel intimate and comfortable.   The really big problem is that the restroom is right in the middle of the back dining room.  We were seated in the middle of the room but the restroom door opened next to us.  It was a bit off putting.  Given the size of the place, where ever you sat in the back would be within a few feet of the restroom door so it is not like another table would have done much.  That is an unfortunate layout for a restaurant.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  We started out with a few of the veggie sides the roasted brussels sprouts and the cauliflower.  They were good. I appreciated the selection of veggies as starters.  My only criticism is that the flavors were very similar.  They both tasted like veggies curried in vinegar.  Tasty but you don't really need two of essentially the same dish.\n\nFor an entree, I had the primavera.  When the description says that it is going to be pasta with pesto and sweat cream, you think it will be a bit decadent.   However, it really wasn't,  The sauce was very light- just a light coating of the pasta and nothing extra.  The taste was fine and I do understand that pasta is not meant to be drowned in sauce like some Oliver Garden commercial, but the dish was just lacking.

My vegetarian roommates got the eggplant sandwich, which they both thought was too bland, and the potato pizza, which they both loved.\n\nWe also got the cheese plate, which comes with honey, almonds, and currants.

The selection of Italian wines was a bit exhilirating and our wine bartender/espresso barrista (they have an espresso machine here as well!) performed informed tastings to those nearby us. The place was a nice change from the busier bar/restaurant scene on Saturday night, great for hosting large groups and eating some delicious cheese and meat platters. \n\nThe one thing that really sold this place for me was the music - one of the female waitresses was big into underground hip-hop and I was surprised to find myself vibin' to Drivin' Down the Block by Kidz in the Hall while halfway through my wine glass. \n\nI didn't have any of the food though, so I can't give it five stars yet.

The cheese was so solid it slid off in one bite from the entire slice. The pizza reminded us of a fast food chain pizza and the seasonings were rather dull - spice was not found anywhere near this.\n\nBoar pasta. First plate was sent back because the pasta was crunchy and the plate was stone cold. Second plate was still a bit crunchy, so I gave up. It was clear they had simply tried to heat the first dish in a pan until the pasta was cooked. This resulted in this greasy fat pool at the bottom of my dish and a flavorless ensemble of overcooked meat and slippery pasta.\n\nMeatballs. The first dish was also stone cold and the meatballs were still chilly in the center. The second dish seemed rancid... Overall, there was this strange mealy texture in the meatballs. Perhaps an old batch of meat had been mixed into this one. The manager reported that the meatballs had been made that morning... The use of parsley and basil would imply they were trying to cover something up.\n\nIt was at this point that my dining partner had to vomit in the bathroom. I followed shortly. The meal ended abruptly here. \n\nThe only good point would be the service; after seeing we basically didn't eat, they didn't charge us for the meal. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the neighborhood has many great dining options; I'd stay away from this one.

They have three categories of small-serving plates: meat, cheese, and vegetables. You can mix and match items from each category. We went with cheese and vegetables. The cheeses were excellent. We were not a fan of the veggies, which were generally cold vinegar based salads. They needed more flavor, variation, or creativity. \n\nThe menu then follows with pizzas and entree dishes. We ordered a pasta dish. The flavor was good, but I found that the presentation was lacking. The pasta, a butternut squash sauce over orecchiette, looked like kraft macaroni and cheese, and the temperature was luke-warm. The flavor was very good, however.\n\nThe service was mediocre. I was a little surprised by how informal the server was. I don't expect a lot, but I get tired of servers who insist on cutting off your sentence with a \"you got it\" every time you speak. \n\nFinally, my big let down was that the \"cocktails\" on the menu were not liquor-based. I do not think this place has a full liquor license. \n\nTwo caveats: First, parking in this neighborhood is nearly impossible. Plan for that. Second, we didn't order the pizza.

She offers us a place at the bar to eat (there were two spots), but I'm annoyed, I mean I made reservations for a reason, not so I could sit at the bar.  It is coming up on 8:15 PM and we are still waitng for a table, or a reservation to not show up, the hostess is doing that thing shere she tries not to make eye contact as I stand in front of the hostess stand, impatiently.\n\n8:20 PM, there is still an open table that I can see, I guess it is being held for an 8:00 PM reservation (in the meantime, the two spots at the bar were filled).  Finally, I ask to talk to the manager, it is 8:20 PM and there is an open table and I am hungry and I had a reservation afterall.  He comes out, asks if he can see the email confirmation, it is for Saturday, MARCH 26, I made the reservation for the wrong damn month (I'm an idiot and a jack-ass, maybe I should join the Republican party too).\n\nIn any case, he actually seats us at the open table after all the hassle (and I apologize twice to the hostess, I probably owe her more than that).\n\nAfter all that, I really wanted to love the food.\n\nWe ordered the charcuterie plate, which was great - all three selections of meat were superb, plenty of bread and grainy mustard (a few cornichons would be nice, or a pickled onion, but that's a quibble).

The food is really solid - we had a cheese plate, some out of sight culatello (a cured meat), a few of the pane.  All were very tasty, and very attractively presented. (I did think that some of the food was a bit under-salted,  including the cured olives they brought out right away.)  And...and this is big to me, the food is really very original for little-old San Francisco.  It's more Italian than American, in my opinion, and gives us dishes that are unfamiliar in American restaurants. Which makes it that much more fun to  sample the menu in a leisurely way.  \n\nWe tried three wines and those were very nice.  We're not so familiar with Italian wines.  Luckily Boris had some nice suggestions.  The wine list is exciting,  with an emphasis on wines from regions that are not so well represented in most SF restaurants.  \n\nWe finished our meal with some very lovely gelato and sorbetto.  The pistachio gelato with basil cream was our favorite, although the pear sorbetto was really just like eating a poached peach with cream.  Yum.\n\nBeyond the food, the restaurant is very attractive (although a teeny bit dark - it can be hard to read the menu), the staff is very pleasant, helpful, and down-to-earth, and as mentioned before, Boris the owner was great at suggesting wines to try.  By the way, they sell wines by the bottle and glass, but also by the quartino, which is fun since you and a companion can then try a wine together.  That is definitely the most fun way to enjoy their wine.   \n\nWe arrived at 6 on a Wednesday and by 7 pm, it was getting pretty crowded.  And yet the staff remained calm and pleasant.  (RNM might want to take a few pointers on blending in with the neighborhood...) \n\nThe restaurant is really brand new, and you can see that sometimes, for example, as the wait staff are learning about the menu and getting used to working with each other.  I'm looking forward to Uva becoming one of my favorite places,  and also seeing how the menu evolves with the seasons, and as the restaurant gets into full swing.  I plan to go back regularly.", "author": "Carol M."}

I know because I've walked past it many times (usually when they're closed) looking for it. Blame me for not remembering addresses well.\n\nAdmittedly when I walked in I thought the place was very tiny, but there is space around the other side of the bar that really makes the restaurant feel more open. I liked how the walls weren't overly decorated. There was just enough wall art of bistro scenes that they were lovely accents as to gaudy reiterations (see TGI Friday's for an example). I loved the display case for the cheeses and charcuterie, it felt like a more european practice and made me feel a little closer to the food.\n\nSpeaking of food: I don't think I'd be able to visit often enough to taste and appreciate everything. In part because I don't have money. The rest is because they have so many different offerings. We had the eggplant caponata, a fig and quinoa salad, and a third that I have just forgotten. The caponata was sweet and nutty while the fig salad was earthy. \n\nWe ordered three pizzas for our table. The lamb with bell pepper and the corn with pancetta were good. But I was really in love with the roast garlic and kale. So much more robust and meaty (surprisingly) than the other two pizzas. Great bold and rustic flavor in that veggie pizza. For dessert we tried the peanut butter gelato sandwich. The chocolate cookies were the star of that dish. My only criticism was gelato was icy. Perhaps the gelato is being held too cold. You aren't supposed to keep gelato at the same temperature as you would ice cream, but who really has the space for a dedicated gelato freezer?\n\nOur party of four received lovely service and some great recommendations on the wine. Their wine list looks lovely, though I'm ill-equipped to comment on wines. Thankfully the service was able to suggest wines from the profiles that we like. AND you don't just get a glass, you get a small carafe. It feels like a deal to me.\n\nWhat I found most interesting about Uva was the apparent size of the kitchen. It looks like there's one cook. Granted, it's a small place, but really? When that place gets slammed, I'm excited at the thought to watch the one chef work.", "author": "Jay V."}

My girl friend Stephanie Y., who I've known since I was 17 and who I lost touch with since I was 18, was in SF and we came here for good, honest wine and cheese. (As if I would eat and drink something bad and deceitful anyway.)\n\nWe had three bottles of wine, two reds and one white, that were recommended by our waiter. I'm no sommelier, so I'm not delving into the aroma, accents, and textures, but they were all SMOOTH and SEXY. \n\nWe also had a 5-cheese plate with 4 soft cheeses and 1 hard cheese. The complimentary truffle honey, figs, and fruit on the side were JUST HEAVENLY. I almost died of lactose intolerance, but it was worth it to reach cheese nirvana and tell my story on Yelp later.\n\nSomewhere between wine, cheese, and lamb sausage pizza (very good and very good at absorbing excess wine in my stomach), Stephanie and I found out we missed each other in D.C. AND in London by days (where we both lived for a few months)! We even resided in the same apartment building in D.C.! It was then and there--drunk and dairy-ed up--that I knew we'd be friends forever.\n\nWe spent way too much at Uva Enoteca for our poor, debt-soaked, law school butts, but I only remember how much fun it was.

One of my friends is getting married. We came here with a group of girls for a little casual bridal shower type deal. \n\nLet me first say, that overall, I really do like this place. The ambiance is very nice - pretty wooden tables, romantic lighting, etc.The noise level is kind of ridiculous, as other reviewers have noted. The menu items are very affordable and the wine list is ample with plenty of choices in the $30/bottle range. Unfortunately, everything kind of fell short of expectations (except for the bottle of wine).\n\nWe all started the evening with one of their aperitifs and I am sorry to say that none were very good. I don't usually like schmancy cocktails so I should have known better. I think we all ordered something different so we got to sample each drink - meh. The best one was definitely the chili/basil concoction. I got some sort of a lemon deal that frankly tasted like a throat lozenge. The honey mead based cocktail was compared to robitussin by more than one girl at our table. The ginger/beer one just tasted like lime/ginger soda, which is fine, but at $7 I could just buy a 6 pack of Reed's Ginger Beer. \n\nWe also ordered all seven of the cheeses (very reasonable at $28) and five of the verdure ($25). The cheese was delicious, because let's face it, that's pretty damn hard to mess up. However, the baguette should have been freshly sliced because it was already a little hard/stale (which I know, happens very quickly with baguette, but still). The vegetables were just nothing special - they all were in dire need of s&p and extremely difficult to eat with the ginormous cutlery they provide. Additionally, they bring out the cheese and verdure on these long wooden planks, which while they are attractive, they are not very practical. There was really no way to fit them on the table. \n\nAll in all, the prices are extremely reasonable, and I may be back just for wine and cheese or maybe to sample a pizza. I was pretty underwhelmed with what we got and our server seemed pretty annoyed by us.\n\nI think with a little more thought this place could be greatly improved. For now, Heart is still my wine bar of choice. It's too bad it's so damn far away.", "author": "Rachael S."}

It did not disappoint.  UVA is probably the best looking resto on Lower Haight, sporting a long bar up front and exposed brick walls in the back.  It was fairly empty when we got there. We decided to sit at the bar.  They only have wine and beer here, no liquor, but our waiter still concocted some delicious and unique cocktails--especially the \"In Bocca al Lupo\", essentially a procecco-based Mojito.\n\nThe menu is laid out with small plates / starters on top, and some heavier dishes / entrees below.  All dishes it seems are intended to be shared, which is how we love to eat.  For starters we got the Procsciutto  Cotto w/ Truffle and the Arugula and Grape salad.  Both were very tasty, and even better when we combined them, putting the salad and prosciutto on top of a slice of bread.  The prosciutto was a bit too heavy, however, and we weren't as hungry when our main courses arrived - the Pork & Basil Meatballs, and the Wild Boar Ragu.  Both were great, hearty dishes, but tough to eat after the bread-filled appetizer.\n\nWe were disappointed to learn that the dessert we'd been eyeing the whole meal - Caramel Gelato sandwich with chocolate and strawberry sauce - had run out for the night, so we got a the trio of gelatos instead, which was a nice, light way to finish off the meal.  While this meal didn't blow us away with flavor or originality, it was still a very satisfying dinner experience and a go-to spot in Lower Haight.  4 stars.", "author": "AdamLowell C."}

When we first arrived, the bar was full but most of the tables were open.\n\nThe service started out great, but as the night progressed, they made it clear that other people had \"reserved out table.\" Sure, being a former-waitress myself. I totally understand, so I guess the lesson is if you're walking in, go early, and LEAVE EARLY. The waiter knew his wines (which they SHOULD) and let us taste one or two to make sure that we enjoyed them before getting the full 10oz. Again, this is standard in any wine bar. The wines were good, but nothing that blew my mind. \n\nWe weren't too hungry, but were curious about their meat platter which comes with a selection of various meats. We opted for the cooked prosciutto with truffle, pheasant, and pate. The pickles and mustard that came with it  on the side were delicious. I might try the getting the raw prosciutto next time because the taste and texture of the cooked one reminded me more of ham than cured goodness. The pheasant and pate looked like slices of meatloaf filled with random greens. That said, I actually quite liked the pheasant (a bit different) and the pate. \n\nThe wines were good but nothing to write home about.

But the food! Boo.\nI ordered a cheese plate and took the servers recommendations on my 3 kinds.  The first just tasted like a tangy cream cheese, the second was fine but nothing special, but the third- the pecorino-style with truffles- it was awful.  I love cheese. I love truffles. Somehow putting the two together like this was just an disgusting mess.  It was served sweaty, so it was obviously sitting out, so maybe cold it's better? But really, just so awful. I forced my dining companion to try it just to experience the awfulness. It didn't help that the bread served with the cheese plate was clearly not fresh.  I also had the Venetian cauliflower with shallots, raisins and capers.  It was fine, but the menu didn't say it was pickled cauliflower, and that was what came out.  It was really vinegary and there were no capers.\nMy dining companion had a pasta dish with mushrooms that was perfectly fine, but the pasta was undercooked and there was nothing notable about the dish.  \nOverall, I was pretty bummed about the food, because it's such a cool little place.", "author": "Mallori M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-31", "description": "I'm a little torn on Uva Enoteca. I think the one factor that sticks with me after dining there last night is that I was confused. Starting with the name, to the menu itself, I kept thinking, what do I do with this? We eventually figured out the deal with the menu, but the problem was I just wasn't sure what to do with it, and it took a long time for the wait staff to show up to explain things. \n\nOnce we ordered our food, we waited a while and never got anything to munch on. Being Italian fare, I expected bread or something to chew on while awaiting my meal, but when food finally did arrive, they brought everything at once: Appetizer, salads and entree. We were all just looking at this pile of food thinking, REALLY?? What started out as a confusing dining experience just got more confusing. Why would you do that?\n\nThe food itself was delicious! I had a lovely pasta and brussels sprouts dish and the pate was delightful. But even with that, there was a little bit of bread served with the pate, and we wanted some bread to sop up the sauce of the pasta, so when we got the waiter's attention, we asked for bread, and he indicated that we already had some. We thought that was for the pate, and there was just enough to eat with the pate, so it took cajoling to get a few more slices to use for our pasta, which they metered out a piece at a time. \n\nNoise level: This place is LOUD. We did note that our noise experience was primarily due to the two loud girls at the adjacent table, but in general, hard wood floors and no sound-dampening elements around made this place very loud. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my food, but I left not really wanting to go back, which is a shame, as the place COULD be great if they'd work on their pacing and setup a bit. One thing I think of with Italian food is COMFORT, and I never felt that warm, yummy COMFORT feel here. I really don't want to slam the place, as I did have a nice meal, but the reasons above are why I can only give it 3 stars. I'll likely go back and try it again sometime, as the food is quite good.", "author": "Ken W."}

It is deceivingly spacious inside (there's a back room behind the bar), not obnoxiously crowded or sceney, but  maintains a comfortable ambiance.  \n\nA great place to gather with a group of your best friends, enjoy a good meal, and drink enough red wine to make it seem like you're the only people around.  Always a big plus when you can just breeze into the restaurant without reservations and get seated in 2 seconds.  I love instant gratification.\n\nOur orders were taken pretty promptly and came out perfectly timed.  \nWe started with the cheese plate and ordered 3 cheeses - a perfect size for 3 people.  The honey, figs, and peaches they had on the side were a perfect complement to the cheeses we picked.  They serve a nice hefty dose of vino - enough to get 3 glasses out of a regular order.    They also serve half orders for those of you who might have to be designated driver for the night.  \n\nWe ordered pastas which were a decent size portion - not too big or too small.  I had the lamb sausage pasta.  The pasta itself could have used a little more seasoning but the highlight of the dish was really the lamb sausage meatballs.  I took a bite of my friend's Bucatini pasta and that was a lot more flavorful - simple but still packed some punch.  Good for those who like to keep it spicy.  At $14, it was pretty on par with other similarly tasty pasta places in the city.  For dessert, we finished up the meal with their gelato.  The cardamom whipped cream was delicious though I could have done without the strawberry syrup.  \n\nOverall, a good meal with great friends is always a good time.

So, we headed to Uva. \n\nRight when we walked in, I could tell my buddy and his girlfriend were regulars. Everyone knew their name and after greeting them, introduced themselves to me. The decor was simple but perfect. We just sat at the bar and ordered some food and a glass of wine each. We started off with a meat and cheese platter. It came with some prosciutto, fennel flavored salami, and then some other meat that I wasn't too familiar with (looked similar to the prosciutto but a darker red color). The cheeses were a blue cheese, a brie cheese, and an aged sharp cheddar (don't remember their exact names). Served with this platter were 3 dishes consisting of almonds, honey, and dried apricots. This was the perfect start to the meal. \n\nFor our main meal, my buddy ordered Pancetta, chicken, and gorgonzola panini. His girlfriend ordered the prosciutto, raisins, and fresh mozzarella panini. I ordered the mixed lettuces, gorgonzola, pears and almond salad. I was still a little full from the burger, but this hit the spot wonderfully. After our meal, Chris the bartender, gave us some vanilla gelato. It was prepared in a way that I had never had nor had heard of. It was served with sea salt and olive oil mixed in. It was very strange, but very good. Although, there were bites that had too much salt in it, but that was a rarity. \n\nThe price for this place is way cheaper than what I was expecting it to be. I would recommend Uva for friends (not a large group) wanting to catch up or for a date place.

Why did I like it?\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxing and smart with indie tunes in the background and our server was sweet and attentive. The $1.5 peronis at happy hour were definitely a plus and we also tried their $4 beer cocktail - it was GOOD (it had ginger beer and lemongrass). The rose wine that we tried was not bad either - and big pours! Now, although the salame and mozzarella pizza was disappointing with rather bland tomato sauce and very small size, the two paninis we tried were excellent (chicken-gorgonzola and, the star of the evening, speck-fennel-apples!). We also had their heirloom tomato salad which was delicious and fresh, but... $12?? \n\nSo, we will be back to try their other wines as well as meat and cheese platters (they looked great at the table next to us)", "author": "Chris D."}

I'm not really confident enough in people to pick things out for me in general, let alone something as important as my food and drink of choice but there's something about this place and it's employee's that makes me trust them. It probably has a lot to do with the fact that my favorite music is always playing in the background. Or because the beautiful cheese and bread they slice and serve is sitting out in big hunks like delicious, culinary art.\n\nEvery time I go here, I belly up to the bar, tell the same guy who's always behind it to pick me out some cheese and a glass of red and I leave 2.5 hours later with black teeth, a full stomach, and a song I love but haven't heard in forever happily stuck in my head. \n\nThey serve fantastic cheese plates. I love the ever-changing accompaniments to the selection, always a perfectly palatable combo of nuts, some type of sweet paste like quince or fig and honey, and something savory. I've also sampled a few of the salads - all on target - and a few meat dishes, the real standout being a wild boar ragu which inspired me to make my own meaty concoction a few days later. Gotta love that. \n\nFor me, a perfect week food/drink wise would include a stop in here, which reminds me I haven't been in a little.

We had gone once before, so we were excited to go back again at a discount!  We started with three veggie antipasti -- brussels sprouts, parsnips, and asparagus.  The brussels sprouts were our favorites, followed by the parsnips. There was not must asparagus in the third dish, and it was mostly Israeli couscous.  I'm a fan of Israeli couscous, but this one was just ok -- a little low on seasoning, and a lot of them were clumped together. We followed that up with the boar ragu bucatini -- recommended by the waiter -- and the asparagus and potato pizza.  The bucatini was cooked perfectly, and I really enjoyed the hearty ragu. The pizza was good, but not great.  The crust was average, but the toppings, especially the burrata, were very good.  Overall, I would give it a solid 3 1/2 stars, but they get an extra half star for the service and the freshly crushed red pepper they brought us for the pizza and pasta, which had a really nice kick to it.  You usually don't get stuff with that sort of kick at most restaurants, and we really enjoyed it.  \n\nWe'll be back again sometime, even without a coupon.", "author": "Pilan C."}

Seriously, just as an example, I am tired of trying to walk into NOPA (at 11pm no less) and being told it's an hour wait for a table or being jostled at the 3-person-deep bar.  Uva is a great antidote to that experience.\n\nI don't know terribly much about Italian wines, but every time the servers have been very knowledgeable and helpful.

Uva does them right.\n*Persimmons, burrata, chervil, saba: words cannot begin to describe the fantasticness of this dish, so just go in and try it. Now.\n*Tuna crudo, olive oil, vanilla salt: fresh and tasty. The vanilla adds an interesting kick.\n*Pizzas: very tasty. Not quite as authentic as La Pazzia's, IMO, but still damn good.\n*Shrimp, avocado, pancetta tramezzini: wow...incredibly good, but also extremely rich, so consider yourself warned. \n\nI highly recommend going with a group of like-minded eaters and sampling a bunch of dishes from the menu--there are still many I'd like to try (and will!).

The place was packed (but not as packed as the next night, I hear...Boris told me that there was an HOUR wait!). \n\nWe stood at the comfortable bar and Chris, the bar manager, hooked us up with wine that was \"chewy\" and \"full-bodied\" as I'd requested. I'm not sure what it was, but it was exactly what I'd asked for, and I like that it came in a large pour.\n\nWe sat down five minutes later at a gorgeous 2-top table in the back. We had been perusing the menu for about ten minutes but were still a bit confused (it's all in Italian!). The meats sounded good, as did the cheeses, so we told our sweet waitress that we wanted to have an assortment of delicious and random meats and cheeses. I wish that they'd come with tags on them so that I could remember which ones we ate, but I tell you, they're all pretty darn good, and they satisfy anybody's taste. \n\nUpon ordering our bottle of wine, we had a lot of assistance from the sommelier. He was very knowledgeable and listened to our requests. He told us that the Dolcetto would be right up our alley, so off he went to get a bottle. Upon returning, he opened the bottle, took a whiff of it himself, told us that the wine wasn't quite at its peak, and rushed off to get us another bottle. Now that's customer service. \n\nThe plates may be small, but they're deceptively filling. We didn't try the pizza, but it looked delicious, and the asparagus was cold and freak-out good.

I'm a sucker for a man with short dreads - Well, he looked straight from the front, but totally gay from the back (skinny jeans, what can I say.)  My pardner arrived.  We ordered the little morselly foods first - gnocchi with speck, perfectly dressed salads, Kampache with a salt lick.  We told clever and hilarious stories, complained about work.  We tried carafe after carafe of medium bold Italian reds.  Then came mediocre fig dish.  Mid meal, we had to send back the eggplant capanata  because it tasted like raisins and sugar, and things went south for the second act.  \n\nThe gorgeous skinny jeans guy was reading Vanity Fair which means there was no way to tell whether he was gay or straight.  (I must put people into boxes!  But hate it when they try to box me...)

Not that I frequent or particularly love the Lower Haight, but the neighborhood needed something like UVA that was just high enough on the \"gentrification\" meter as to be a draw without detracting too much from the grungy, gruff 'hood that gives the LH it's (deserved) reputation.  If RNM was the beachhead, then UVA is the reinforcement.\n\nThe ambiance is perfect for the type of place that UVA strives to be (a neighborhood wine bar). The decor clean and simple - not ostentatious.  Air conditioning was sorely lacking, which in 90+ degree heat was somewhat of a bummer.\n\nThe food?  Infused honey that goes well with everything; portions that are suitable, but not skimpy; cheese and charcuterie selections that have varieties of good options (we went five for five with the cheese tasting); even the pizza was cooked perfectly.  Hat's off to the chef.\n\nThe wines are complementary to the cheese/meat selections and not your standard fare.  Great Italian varietals and glasses of wine are first poured into small carafes - a very nice touch, enabling two or more people to share a single \"pouring\" with ease.\n\nThe wait staff are, appreciatively, not afraid to express their opinions - none of the \"they're all good\" b.s. that is as offensive a response as you can come by when you ask for an honest recommendation.  Add to this the fact that our waitress (Sarah), the owner (Boris), and the host (nice guy name unknown) were all refilling our water/wine glasses and constantly asking us if we needed anything else.\n\nThis place deserves to stick around.", "author": "Nils E."}

Thanks to Living Social, I got to experience this place TWICE in one weekend. Uva Enoteca is a great little place when you want to escape and enjoy a lovely Italian meal in a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. My friend ordered the boar pasta (\"memories of Florence\" he said) while I had the roasted pork loin with bacon-wrapped dates. Incredible! On our second visit we decided to try the pizzas. For myself, the lamb, tomato, and mascarpone pizza. My friend got the spicy salame, herb, pecorino, and tomato pizza for his entree. Both were insanely good. We split the snickerdoodle pie and chocolate budino, with smoked salt, granola, and berries (mind-blowing!) for dessert. Overall, a fantastic experience. Affordable, nice atmosphere, quality food, and good service. Our server Beth was very sweet and the food was delicious. We couldn't recommend this place more highly. A great find in the lower Haight. We are definitely looking forward to returning.", "author": "Denny G."}

I've spent somewhere in the four figures. I have never done this with a restaurant before much less anything I've mentioned on Yelp. I hope that is saying something. \n\nJust some highlights:\n\n1. They do amazing things with greens I've never heard of. It's all about the pea tendrils. Zucchini blossoms (not deep fried) -- crazy. Barley-corn-fava-squid! Some other shit I've never heard of nor could remember if you asked me apart from it being delicioso. And this is \"supposed\" to be a meat/cheese kind of place first and foremost.. Even the veggies are interesting.\n\n2. The staff is universally adorable. And professional. I have to imagine that any dings in service are completely attributable to their being slammed at times.\n\n3. The carne, cheese and most of all *wine* are all geared towards sampling and experimentation. It has kept me interested all this time and they keep it fresh.\n\n4. Do not be afraid to go girly with the rosato, pignoletto, in bocca al lupo prosecco cocktail, salads, crudos.. Not every meal has to be heavy with tannins and fat.\n\n5. You probably know about the crudos and the cheeses but their *condiments* are standouts in and of themselves.. vanilla salt, son!\n\n6. I mentioned this before but it's worth mentioning again. The wine list is broad, interesting and pretty reasonably priced.\n\n7. Do not miss the sorbet. It's really creamy and fruity. Not at all sugary/icy.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that this is a perfect place to meet with friends and have a casual meal with wine. Each dish is around $4-8 and the wines are all $10-14 or so for 8 oz. carafes. 2 oz. pours are exactly a quarter of that price. Within that framework it is a fantastic experience. The atmosphere is airy and conducive to conversation. Their pricing structure and menu is very much geared towards sampling and experimentation, so I suggest you take advantage of that and explore stuff. And drinking. It's very good for drinking.", "author": "Tom L."}

Actually, it's not that little as there is more seating in the back.\nThe waitress was very knowledgeable about wine and food and not shy to give great recommendations. \nWe were 3 ladies, had 3 veggies and 3 cheeses and a pasta and a pizza. It was a little too much but all really delicious. The truffle honey goes with everything. The prosciutto pizza was really good, with molten mozzarella and a nice thin crust. The pasta was shells with boar ragout, it was so good, it was hard not to over eat. We had no space for dessert as we had too much savory.\nAccidentally we ordered 3x 8oz of red wine which was a little too much for us and which made the thing a little more pricey.

He brought out bread with olive oil which was delicious- very fresh tasting and the olive oil was outstanding.  I ordered the Wild Boar Ragu which was a baked pasta dish with shell-like noodles, ground boar meat (tastes like a cross between beef and venison) with tomatoes, onions, parmesan cheese, garlic and other delicious herbs. It was fantastic! A great combination of crispy, cheesy and meaty with a delicious tomato sauce.\n\nDessert was ginger snap ice cream in a cookie sandwich with chocolate. SO GOOD!!!!

The Cheesemongers tried three new wines and two new varietals, and loved them all.   \n\nThe wines were well-priced and laid out on the menu in a logical geographic array.  Wine service was thoughtful and not overbearing, and new glasses were brought for every taste we had. \n\nThe food was very good - with the best part being the salume plate - well curated and presented.  We also had two vegetable apps (an amazing sliced Pluot with lardo and a very good bean and pancetta dish).   The mains were good (a small casserole of Orrichette that was slightly overcooked but had some very nice melded flavors of Parm, wild boar, tomato and pasta, and a corn basil Pizza on a slightly soggy crust).\n\nService was understated and friendly,and we felt very well taken care of by our waitress and one of the owners.  \n\nThe ambiance is muted, dark and not overdesigned, although the constantly opened and closed curtain 'masking' the kitchen was a wee bit of a distraction, as was the Pink Floyd being played slightly too loud (the Cheesemonger loves the Floyd, but would rather hear softer music, or Italian pop, or non-vocal stuff when he's dining in a nice restaurant).\n\nPricing was a wee high for the location - the lower Haight across from the Noc Noc -- we spent over $50 per person on wine, apps, mains and dessert.\n\nWe wish the owners well, and will return if we're nearby.", "author": "Cheesemonger Jeff D."}

With a warm, soft, cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and moderate prices, this restaurant aims to please its patrons with its slightly rustic and inspired fare.\n\nI came here with a girl friend and she said that this was one of the best meals she's ever had in her life. In terms of experience, I have to agree. We arrived, were seated quickly, were calmly waited upon (although the service was on the slow side), had the entire menu explained to us, and were given drink suggestions. We got some delicious libations (I had this particular cocktail made with lillet blanc, garnished with red pepper - tasted like a pizza, in a good way), and some appetizers and some entrees to share had a great conversation, relished in the simple, understated elegance of our surroundings enjoyed every morsel of our food. The most memorable item were the polenta cakes - I have never had such buttery, creamy, sweet polenta cakes seared in sweet butter in my life and have attempted to find something similar and to replicate it in my kitchen to multiple failures. The house pinot noir was lovely, and went well with my wild boar ragu served with fresh orrechiette pasta.

Perhaps not five stars, but at least four. The menu is expansive, with quite a few meat, cheese and vegetable/fruit small plates (in a variety of sizes) to choose from. One really nice touch are the \"complements\" that come with the cheese and bread - honey, a mustard concoction and almonds. Each were terrific, especially the honey.\n\nWe also got two larger plates - the veggie panini featuring speck, fennel and apples (really, really good) and the asparagus pizza (oily, but good, and rather sizeable at six pieces).  Everything was accented by some nice wine selections, all chosen by the table's resident wine guru (fellow yelper and all around good guy Louis M.) and a very friendly and knowledgable sommelier.\n\nSo far so good. Unfortunately everything else detracted from the experience.\n\nService was the big miss. I wanted to like our waitress more than I did, cute, friendly, trying hard....but trying too hard. Everything felt scripted, lacked authenticity, and I think we were being upsold from the minute we sat down. The vibe was off. It didn't help matters that they were out of my original panini choice - chicken. It would have been totally fine had she let me know then it was not an option. But I learned an hour later, right before they were due to bring our next round of food (which I though took way too long). Unacceptable. If I place my order, set aside my chicken. If it's not available, tell me right away. Instead I was forced to make an alternative selection on the spot if I planned on eating anything of more substance than a breadstick.\n\nIt didn't get any better when the bill came. Things would be have been greatly remedied had the panini been comped, but it wasn't, and was listed on the bill as the chicken panini. We pointed out that we actually didn't get that, we got the veggie one, and her reply was \"well it's the same price\". Um, yeah, not the point. We then asked for it to be taken off the bill, and she left, assumingly to get permission, and when she came back, agreed to do so, even though \"we ate it\". OK, whatever. Also didn't help that we were charged for both a large and a small meat platter. We ordered the small, a large was brought to our table, which they swapped for a small, and then charged us for both. At this point, their gesture of comping two coffees was too little too late.\n\nBeside service, the music was atrocious. Such a nice wine bar setting ruined by a way too loud mix of Pat Benetar and rap. Everything has its place, these two music genres do not go with a wine bar scene.\n\nBefore leaving we gave all this feedback to the hostess, so things might improve. They've got a good thing going with location and food, fixing everything else would likely turn these two stars into four.", "author": "Jason B."}

Took a while for anyone to acknowledge our presence, which is always offputting.  \n\nOther than that though I was really blown away.

Boar meat, a little cheese, shell pasta, in a red sauce that was done with a bit of class (not too thick, not too salty, not too garlicy).  They put this all in a ceramic bowl and bake it, as some (but not all) ragu dishes are prepared.  Absolutely nailed it.  couldn't recommend this entree any higher.

I was glad to return to my old stomping grounds, if only to sample some of the wines and fare here.\n\nFor the most part I enjoyed the food - there were some hits as well as misses.\n\nThe apperitivi I ordered -- an Ultras: Birra bionda, ginger beer, lime, lemongrass & tarragon -- was very sour -- even though I hadn't conveyed to the server that t I enjoyed my drinks on the sour side.  It was a bit *too* sour even for me -- such that the rest of the subtle favours of lemongrass, gingerbeer and tarragon were obscured.\n\nWe shared a couple of salads: heirloom tomatoes with ricotta salata and simple balsamic/ oil dressing - flavourful enough, hard to screw up. I definitely enjoyed the raw pea leaf-salad with peas, prawns and lemon aioli. Pea leaves are one of my favourite vegetables, and I usually have them stir-fried rather than raw.  The salad, very lightly dressed, was innovative and refreshing.\n\nI opted for the Paccheri with goat cheese, arugula and lamb sausage -- the pasta was tasty enough, and toothsomely well-cooked (al dente).  The flavours of the sauce were coherent and complimentary to the lamb sausage meatballs which had a nice funky gaminess to them (the way I like lamb).  However, presentation left much to be desired.  It was served gloppily on a too-small plate and threatened to ooze over the side.  The wine that was recommended - a Montepulciano - was also unfortunately too earthy for the rich dish.  I could have used a bit more acid or brightness to cut through the fatty lamb and creamy sauce.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely return, though.  The space is absolutely charming and larger than it looks from the outside.  I hope it was an unusually slow Saturday night.", "author": "Claudine C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-25", "description": "The much anticipated wait is over, and Uva was brimming with people. So much so that they were moving people around from the front to the back room to accommodate smaller parties. The space is very simple; off white walls, crown moulding, with a central bar that spans the rooms. The otherside has exposed brick, the semi open kitchen and the restrooms smack dab in the middle. \n\nAfter perusing the small but focused food and beverage menu we opted with the following:\n\n- Chef's choice charcuterie: prosciutto, bresaola, sopresseta, umbrian salumi \n- Panini: Pancetta, chicken, blu del moncenisio\n-Pizza: Funghi misti, robiola cheese\n-Tramezzini: Shrimp, avocado, pancetta\n\nEverything was pretty tasty with the chef's choice meat plate being the winner. Too bad we didn't get the Culatello with it because it comes from Salumeria Biellese in Manhattan, a great family owned deli, where stuff is done the old fashioned way. So now I know how to get a Biellese fix without actually having to go across the country. The pizza was good a bit on the bland side because the mushrooms overpowered the robiola cheese which has a quick melt factor, giving a different mouth feel than pizza with a higher gooey index (yes that is the scientific term). The panini was also on the blander side as the chicken and blu overpowered the pancetta a bit. A little more pancetta and this panini is perfect. Finally the Tramezzini, which is a cold rolled sandwich was the most intriguing as the shrimp, avocado and pancetta was quite harmonious. I think if the roll were grilled it would be over the top and I make motion for them to offer this as a panini also!\n\nThe service was the real winner. As I said the place was wall to wall and our server Sara, who seemed to be the only one in the front, hammered away at all the tables getting things the best she could even  though we could see it was overwhelming. 5 stars to her for making it through the night. \n\nThe craziest thing about Uva (at least the opening night) was the people watching. The lower Haight is always full of characters and they were out in droves. Some of the more entertaining watches:\n\n- Eye patched man and his friend, who tried to mack on two women sitting adjacent to the bar\n- Swinger couple at the bar openly switching partners every few minutes\n- Getting checked out by both girls and guys while waiting for my table. \n\nThere was definitely also a large neighborhood vibe as many people seemed to know each other.  Kudos to their team for adding another late night destination to the dining scene (open till 12am) and I wish them the best on their success.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew Wine Bar opening in the lower Haight scheduled for 3/31. Will feature antipasti, pannini, and cheeses to compliment the extensive Italian wines.", "author": "Kim N."}

This is of note as my hairdresser is in Lower Haight and there are only a few restaurants open on Mondays in that neighborhood (we usually go to RNM). The atmosphere in Uva is dark and subtle, warm and inviting. There is a bit of an oddity with the Zeppelin music in the background, but I kinda liked it. As it was my hairdresser's birthday, I brought a homemade cake and the waitstaff were more than gracious in holding the cake for us as well as cutting and serving it after our meal. When we sat, we were given a small bowl of green olives. They were gone so quickly and thankfully, the waitstaff offered more. What *are* those giant, bright green olives?\n\nThe three of us started with three cocktails;\n~ [i]Prosecco Cocktail[/i] with peach bitters and a bit of sugar.\n~ [i]Miele Frizzante[/i] - Carpano antique, orange, peach bitters, and Heidrun buckwheat blossom mead. VERY odd cocktail; the mead made it seem like a light, fruity hefeweizen. Interesting, but not something I think I'd order again.\n~ [i]In Bocca Al Lupo[/i] - Lillet blanc, chilies, basil, prosecco and coconut salt. Too much chilies for me; spicy.\n\nThey have a very extensive wine list and we let the owner(?) offer a suggestion. He came up with a Barbera d'Alba, \"Gisep,\" Massolino from Piemont. \n\nLoving the nosh, we again put ourselves in the hands of the capable staff; bring on a bunch of meat, a bunch of cheese, and some appropriate side dishes. \n\nWe started with the crudo of the day; on that day, Tuna with olive oil and salt. As my hairdresser's BF is a professional fish-monger, he confirmed my compliment that it was a great quality fish. \n\nNext the meats and cheeses arrived. They offer various assorted sized plates and offerings and so five of each seemed a good compromise; Prosciutto di Parma, Bresaola from Bernina Montevideo, Coppa di Testa from Boccalone, orange and fennel from Boccalone, and a hot Soppressata from the Bronx. Sorry I can't remember the five cheeses, but I can remember the accompaniments with the cheeses; truffled honey, a lemon/pepper condiment, and Marcona almonds. \n\nAlso served was chunks of fresh bread, eggplant caponata (a bit on the spicy side for me but still enjoyable), roasted asparagus with lemon aioli and Parmigiano (very fresh and nicely crunchy with person aioli), and fresh beans with pancetta and onions (I ate most of these, but I am obviously the veggie eater in the group). We should have stopped, but we were intrigued with the Semolina gnocchi with speck. Of all the dishes we ordered, the gnocchi was the least successful. Perhaps I'm spoiled with Sean O'Brien's gnocchi but these were on the gummy side and with the speck and no sauce, way too dry. It needs SOMETHING moist on the plate and there was nothing.\n\nI have to admit that there were a number of desserts which looked intriguing and I wished I could have tried the pumpkin cake with vanilla gelato, apples, saba, and pinenut brittle, but we had this cake I made instead. Again, the waitstaff was amazing and I would go back in a heartbeat.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

Mixed feelings. \n\nPros: \nProsecca(?) sparkling wine is great ($7/glass)\nNice atmosphere--cool without being too cool.\nNice servers. \nWine by the bottle a good value. \n\nCons: \nFood is not a good value, especially considering nearby Cafe du Soleil has cheese and wine plates that are at about 80 percent of the quality for 50 percent of the price. In other words, if you're an appreciator but not hard-core connoisseur, I think the meat and cheese plates are over-priced, especially considering the portions. \n\nI don't like it that you can't just order a cheese plate or meat plate sampler. One has to pick, but if you're going there to be enlightened, it's almost too much. It's like, you tell me, Uva, I'm the newbie, you're the expert, so show me the best Italy has to offer. \n\nProbably my most fundamental criticism is the whole enlightenment (or lack of) thing. I don't what's going on with Italian wine/cheese, and the menu is all in Italian and there are no tasting notes on the wines. Our server was very nice, and she seemed to know her stuff, but I felt like I had to go out of my way to get educated, not just order. \n\nBottom line: \nI might go back, especially if I knew someone who was really into Italian gastronomy. Otherwise, for wine I'd go to Hidden Vine or London Wine Bar, for cheese/meats probably Market Bar or just the nearby Cheese Store and stock up myself. I hope they do well though, as it is a welcome addition to the 'hood--nice without being totally snobby.", "author": "Josh K."}

The food is different, dishes you will not find in North Beach, though all delicious.\n\nMy favorite was a crustless sandwich that had fresh avocado and shrimp on the inside. The pizza was also delicious, as well as my vegetarian, tomato pasta (don't get any ideas, I am not a vegetarian). \n\nThe one downside was that even though it was not packed, it was still really loud.

($16, $21, etc in multiple amounts). Almost same type of setup for cheese. The vegetables does not have an assortment option. Anyway, if you are like us, you did not know what to choose, the house can choose the assortment for you. Anyway, we had a lot of prosciutto and pork belly and pepperoni. It was all good. For cheeses, there was a wide range of flavours presented from hard to soft. I don't recall all the names, but They were all good. My favourites were the blue cheese and the stinky cheese. The blue cheese paired with the honey was amazing and the stinky cheese on bread was awesome. \n\nFor the hot dishes, we had the pizza (toppings: salami). It was really good, thin crust. The other item we had was the Tramezzini. It was a sandwich made up of bread (crust cut off)  and shrimp. It was pretty good. \n\nThe wine we had was really good and went well with all the food items we had. They have a large selection of wines.

Uva Enoteca defines what I consider to be an exceptional dining experience. My girlfriend lives in San Francisco and I visit her once every two months or so and my only rule for visiting the city was that I require at least one panini whilst visiting. My rule has changed--I require at least one visit to Uva Enoteca within a two visit period because I love this restaurant!\n\nFirst off, I have never had an entree here that was not a panini (I will change that upon my next visit); however, when I think San Francisco I think four things: hippies, Sundays in the park, hills and paninis! And Uva Enoteca has the best of the latter category. I have had the prosciutto, caponata, bitter greens; the tre fromaggi; and the salame, arugula pesto, pecorino paninis and each one has been as delectable as the one preceding it. The prosciutto was my favorite (considering my inclination toward prosciutto above all other meats, this is not surprising).\n\nThe beer list is one of the exceptional qualities of this place, which is incredible considering that there're only two on the menu. Uva Bionda and Uva Scura. I'm not sure where either are brewed and I've never seen either one at any other location anywhere, so I'm assuming they may be brewed by Uva themselves; but both are exceptional in taste and I'd say I do like the Bionda for its richer flavor better. Crucify me for saying, I've not had any of the wine at this ultra-hip Italian Wine Bar on Lower Haight (again, something I'll rectify upon my next visit).\n\nI do very much enjoy the infused-olives that come as an appetizer and the uniquely awesome breadsticks that come as well. I have had an assortment of their appetizer menu, having loved the orange and fennel carne, as well as every cheese assortment we've ever gotten (again, all of this is memory-based thanks to Yelp's awesome deletion of my account)\n\nIn all... this is a diamond in the rough on Lower Haight and each time we've gone the service has been top-notch and an easy 5 stars. Combined with a mellow clientele (it has been busy each time we've gone, though never enough to where we've ever had to wait for a table) and a menu, which might as well be in Chinese to me, yet still hasn't failed me once: this is indeed Haight's gem and a place to be experienced for anybody who spends even five hours in the city and wants a true taste of the Emerald Bay's gluttonous glory!", "author": "Michael Patrick R."}

The mushrooms in particular were of an exotic variety that I can't name, but recognized and have made at home. This type of mushroom really needs to be cooked, otherwise there is a bitter taste and I think it's not edible. I was quite sick this morning, which I'm hoping its a reaction to the mushrooms and not the flu.\n\nWe also had pizza - the thin-crusted, artisan kind - and the ricotta pound cake, both of which were lovely. The small, round cake was dwarfed by enormous curls of pistachio gelato and served with slices of candied lemon, which IMO were the best part. \n\nMostly though, the food here is so ridiculously fancy you can barely eat it. If you're looking for a culinary adventure come here. I mean, it is nice if that's what you're looking for. But I wasn't in an adventurous mood, I just wanted dinner.\n\nThe service was great. The wine was great, the place is pretty. If I came back just for wine and cheese, I would be happy here.\n\nIt was pretty busy - about 3/4 full when we left - which surprised me since it was Wednesday and we're in a recession.", "author": "Amy T."}

If you don't pay attention you might miss it since there were no huge signs in the front. Once you step into the restaurant, you initially will think \"wow this place is small\" but there were more table towards the back. The bar area is located in the front. The decor has a very chic Manhattan feel with exposed brick walls, high ceiling, and low lit environment. We came on a Wednesday night so got a table immediately and parking, although is usually difficult around that area, we didn't have a problem.\n\nThe food menu was very short and mostly in Italian which we had to ask the waitress for clarification. Appetizers, you can choose an assortment of salami, hams, cheese, and veggies. Since this place was labeled as a wine bar, I think it made sense to have those small bites. For the so-called entree, the selection of pasta, pizza, and panini, were quite short. We ordered a trio of salami, a panini, and a pizza. The portions were small and the food tasted average. Once you flip the menu, there was a huge list of import wines (mainly Italian wines). You can order by the bottle, 2 oz, or 8 oz. I just had a 2oz from the waitress' recommendation (don't remember the name of the wine) but it was excellent. Service was good but the food took a bit of time to get to us.\n\nOverall, if you're a wine enthusiast and a small eater then maybe you'll love this place. However, I thought the portions and selections of the food were quite small for the prices they are charging. Although I do love the one wine that I tried.

We started with the antipasti platter, which included delicious high-quality italian cheeses and cured meats, an eggplant caponata that was to die for and roasted asparagus with a delicious creme accompaniment. \n\nWe customized our own wine flights with a few 2 oz. pours and not a single wine I tried was a dissapointment; to the contrary, I was pleased to find some new experiences, including an Italian chardonnay fermented in clay barrels, as wine had been for much of its history. My favorite tasting of the night was a barolo, but I greatly enjoyed the sangiovese and abruzzo as well. I was especially impressed by our server, who was able to converse intelligently about each and every wine we chose and made great pairing suggestions.\n\nFor our entrees, we tried the corn, mozzarella and tomato pizza, prepared in an authentic Italian style. I'd never had corn on pizza before, but it was quite good- the corn stayed nice and crisp and added a great little sweetness to each bite. We also tried the orecchiette with wild boar ragu, which I loved. I couldn't quite finish it all, but had to take the rest home and had it for breakfast today. :)\n\nFor dessert, we shared an order of the tre gelati- hazelnut, pistachio and vanilla- and it was a fittingly delicious end to a great meal.

It had to be the most flavorless ragu I have ever tasted. Totally unexpected. It was like they mixed plain, unseasoned  minced meat and a tasteless, watered down, tomato sauce together and tossed it with some rigatoni. Not impressed. We also tried the margarita pizza and the lamb and sausage skewers. Both were OK, but nothing I would go back for. The highlight of this restaurant was the service.

The veggies were quite good - really nice seasoning with the beets (though I'm not sure cauliflower is the best pairing).  The eggplant was spiced with cinnamon which was a surprise at an italian place.  The Brussel sprouts had awesome potential, but were very un-roasted.  Raw really. \nThe ragu was very good, though it would have benefitted from a fresh pasta instead of a boxed 'small shell'.  The meatballs were very good, though I was glad I had a big app because there were only 3 on the plate.  That should be an app, and there should be an entree with pasta or bread or a side salad...  \nDessert was a major bummer.  The caramel ice cream sandwich was just too sweet - it was dipped in chocolate, which was overkill (this coming from someone who eats marshmallows by the bag).

This place is amazingly great especially since they've only been open a week or so.  \n\nThe food menu is extensive and while everything looked great we settled on a pizza with asparagus and prosciutto, trezzameni sandwich with shrimp, avocado and pancetta, 3 cheese plate (comes with kick-ass black truffle honey, white pear with black pepper and cherries), tuna crudo (best sushi-quality tuna with unusual vanilla salt) and assorted salumi plate (came with prosciutto, coppa, bresaola and some other ones I can't remember but we're all good).  All of that plus two desserts (best pear sorbet ever!), two bottles of wine (dolcetto) and two dessert wine glasses (moscato) plus a generous tip and it was only $57/person(there were 3 of us).  Great deal for a satisfying amount of food and plenty to drink.\n\nService was impeccable.  Every question was answered knowledgeably.  No one rushed us along.  We got there early (6:15) so we had no problem getting a table but by 7 every seat was filled and by 8 there was a wait.  As the word gets out this place will be packed.\n\nHighly recommend this place!!", "author": "Jennifer A."}

From the outside, you'd think it's a small place with a good sized bar, only to find that it extends further in the back...and there you have it: A nice, lofty restaurant that looks like it belongs in the Napa Valley, minus the snooty service. The wine selection is nothing short of amazing! The bartender's so good, he could recommend a bottle that proves to be spot on to your liking. We had several bottles of Campo di Mezzo, a Sangiovese. At $35 per bottle, it not only knocked our socks off, but our pants off too! It paired so well with the prix fixe menu...Bravo, Bartender...Bravo.\nOnce seated, we were immediately greeted with a variety antipasti:\n-Assortito Carne: I don't necessarily know what was offered...I just know that there were some that were not to the Birthday Girl's liking. One of them being Pate...I think I was better off not knowing what everything was. I do know that the salami and prosciutto good: freshly sliced and perfectly cured.\n-Verdure: An assortment of various veggies: Brussels Sprouts (What is it about kids not loving them, but as we get older, it's a favorite...well, for me anyway!), Eggplant Caponata (I liked it until I found out it was eggplant), Lentils, and some others. Overall, they were good starters. For some people, they were probably better off not knowing what the dishes were, because everything was quite tasty...\n-Insalate: I believe we had two kinds. An arugula salad with potatoes, gorgonzola and almonds. I don't know about you, but a salad with gorgonzola is always a winner to me. We also had a mixed salad with sweet potatoes, raisons and parmesan cheese...With all the other flavors going on, I wasn't paying much attention.\nAfter we were done with the antipasti, we were bombarded with a slew of main dishes to share. I won't bore you with the specifics, but I'll share my favorites:\n-Pizza: Potato, Goat Cheese, Tarragon and Tomato--Another ingredient you can't go wrong with: Goat Cheese...It was such a great combination of a solid potato and soft cheese. A yin and yang of pizza, if I may...\n-Pasta: Lamb sausage and goat cheese--I believe this was the one that came out baked, with burnt cheese on top. Oh man...there's something about burnt cheese on top of pasta...like a match made in heaven.\n-Dessert: They served several and I had a difficult time deciding which was my favorite.\nVanilla gelato with olive oil and sea salt...such an interesting blend of tastes...but so good. Scoop a dollop into your Ritual Americano (Yes, Ritual Coffee!) and you are GOLDEN!!!!\nLemon Sorbetto...The kind that gives you a scrunchy face once dissolved in your mouth...Loved it!\nFinally, pomegranate ice cream...sweet, different, but still good. Again, one dish that takes a back seat to its counterparts.\nOverall, a wonderful dinner. Be prepared to come close to losing your voice, because it's loud in there...A sign of a great Italian dinner!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

We were the 2nd table with only 3 other people in the place. We did get our drink order right away, but our egg and pizza order took  \"FOREVER \" or so it seemed. Some people who came in after us by 15 minutes or more got their order before we did, maybe because they  just ordered pasta. \nAnyway as far as the food- The bottomless Bellini was originally served with orange juice (a mimosa) but later we were offered a Bellini with which seemed like peach juice (it was clear like apple juice.) The mimosa-Bellini was the best part of the meal and a good deal for $10.\nMy egg with biscuit was just OK-the eggs were sort of hard scrambled with some sauce topped with homemade biscuits that were shaped by hand. The pancetta was actually just 2 strips of bacon (maybe they ran out, but they did not explain it or thought we were too inexperienced as diners or cooks to notice?) My friend ordered a pizza with caramelized onions and as another reviewer said there is something \"wrong\" with their dough. It was very thin but had a weird consistency like maybe it is a frozen pizza dough and not a good one. The caramelized onions on top looked like it was put under the broiler to brown the onions which might have contributed to the strange texture. Also I took a couple pieces home and cold or reheated-it was no better. How can you ruin pizza? \nI would not go back  unless I was in the area for a glass of wine. It does have nice ambiance and the server was friendly enough, but did not explain the long wait with so few people in the place. He was the only wait staff and maybe the cook just came in late-our reservation was for 12 noon and it opens at 11 am. He did review my coupon very closely to let me know I could not use more than one and I could not use it for alcohol (which I already knew.)", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

We walked in a few minutes before 6:30 and sat down at the bar. Spent a couple of minutes trying to get the bartender's attention so we could get our order in before HH ended. He (the guy with the red beard) stood at the other end of the bar wiping off glasses (not even helping anyone; it wasn't crowded). Finally he came over and and when I asked, he informed us happy hour was over. I checked my phone - it was 6:30 on the dot. It honestly felt like he was trying to set us up to be late, although I can't imagine what incentive he would have had to do that. His overall attitude came off like a cop who had caught us breaking the law rather than like a neighborhood bartender. If he'd been even a bit nicer about the situation, we would have stayed and ordered at the regular price, but he was such a jerk about it that we just left.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-14", "description": "This is the kinda place I've been seeking for quite some time.  Streamlined--just a focus on meat, cheese, and wine.  Of course, there are other selections, but this is what makes Uva special.\nWe checked this place out the other night.  Upon arrival, it was pretty packed.  We were told only a few minutes for a table, but it ended up being quite a while.  However, they have a little spot where you can order drinks, so we congregated there and, aside from my growling belly, it wasn't too bad.  \nWhen we finally sat down, we weren't messing around.  We ordered the Molto platter of meats, which has 10 options and was incredible.  The lardo, soppresata, and prosciutto were my favorites.  We also ordered 5 cheeses.  Now, if you know me or have read my reviews, you know my world revolves around cheese--literally.  They have some great options here, but I was soooooooo disappointed when the cheese plate arrived only because the pieces were so small and thinly cut that they were just about enough for one person to get a good, full bite.  Too bad there were 4 of us.  I was really sad that, after sharing each piece among us, I felt like I barely got a fair sense of the cheese's flavor.  And, for $19, I expected more.  If the portions were adequate, they would have earned 5 stars from me.  Actually, if I could have given 3.5 stars, that would be more accurate...that's right, this cheese offense earned a 1.5 star loss--but I can't do that, so I'll round up.\nBut, that was the only complaint.  The bathroom was clean and smelled good, the service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  I will be back, but I'd better get more cheese.", "author": "Jessica L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-12", "description": "If you want to run with the big boys, you better deliver on all levels.\n\nSo this place comes with a fine pedigree- the co-owner worked at Mario Batali's Otto in NYC, a fact that our server was oh-so-happy to drop on me and my girlfriend Mary.  She also said that the chef had worked with Mr. Iron Chef, though I'm not sure she had her facts straight.  Either way, she set our expectations very high- we expected a culinary mind-melter.\n\nThe sommelier came around table by table, which was a nice touch.  We were pleased with the Italian wines and he helped us pick a truly lovely Marzemino.  We felt that it was a good value and that it really did compliment the cutting-board fare with which we stared our meal.  We ordered two salumis- a wild boar salami and a very fatty coppa- as well as a trifecta of cheeses (parmigiano, moliterino, and robiola tre latte).  We also ordered the tuna crudo for good measure because Mary loves raw tuna- and she was not disappointed with the extremely fresh fish swimming in very high quality olive oil.  However, I have to say, right off the bat, it took an excruciatingly long time for them to bring these simple items.  As I eventually asked, \"How long does it take to slice meat a cut cheese.\"  We waited for a good 20 minutes- perhaps a ploy to encourage faster wine consumption?  Regardless, the food DID arrive eventually, and was for the most part underwhelming.  The wild boar was excellent, rich with red wine flavors and very fatty, but the coppa was disappointing, missing the salty/fatty explosion that I love so much.  The cheeses were nice, and the 3 'dressings' that are lovingly brought to each table do bring a nice complexity- particularly the pear and black pepper compote, yum.  However, the parmigiano was merely pedestrian and the ribiola tre latte was foul.  It tasted like goat (good) and shellfish (bad), and did not pair well with our wine at all, emphasizing a metallic bitterness that had not been present before.  I would take the blame for this poor pairing, but for the fact that our server specifically recommended this cheese after the one we ordered was unavailable for the evening.\n\nObviously, I started the meal extremely underwhelmed.  Luckily, we pressed on and ordered some more substantive fare- with greater success.  We got a Tramezzini, made with semolina, playfully rolled into a mock sushi-roll and filled with shrimp, avocado, pancetta.  The dish, while disappointingly small, was very tasty and well-balanced- although they were a little heavy-handed with the mayo (which was not house-made).  We also ordered an extremely delicious green garlic pizza with a perfectly crispy crust and a nice balance between cheese and delicious tomato flavor.  Although we're not big pizza eaters, Mary and I agreed that this simple, well-balanced pizza was the best plate of food in the entire evening.\n\nDessert is wisely out-sourced to Berkeley's artisan Almare Gelato.  We got a hazelnut gelato dish spotted with crumbled biscotti and peeled, pan-fried almonds.  Dessert was very, very satisfying and we regretted that we chose to share one because it was so delicious.\n\nOverall I was extremely disappointed.  I think there is great potential here, but that they fail to deliver on many, many levels.  If they want to be just a \"Wine Bar,\" as they imply, they should scale back on the food and focus on quality.  The wine was excellent, and I would go back but only to sit at the bar and drink wine.  I think it can succeed as a wine bar, but has already failed as an Italian restaurant.  I think they're sitting back on their Batali pedigree and failing to deliver what I think is reasonable to expect- consistent quality in every dish.", "author": "Jeff M."}

I was a little dissapointed to see the dude behind the bar that had been so rude to us before but, I assume he got a talking to and hopefully got his shit together and will start treating the customers with a little more courtesy.  I definitely think we will come back as it's right in the neighborhood we like to hang out in and the food is really good. Thanks, Boris, for your devotion to your business and the lovely meal.

As far as the food for dinner, it was far less than stellar. As an enoteca, they have a ton of pork & beef on the menu. Great for meat eaters, not great for me ( I don't eat red meat or pork :).  Our waitress showed me a few vegetarian sandwiches and salads on the menu, but I was really hoping for the summer squash pizza. Unfortch she told me they were out of the squash, so I got an asparagus +  prosciutto pizza minus the prosciutto. I probably shouldn't be admitting to that...but thems the brakes when you're a picky eater!\nStill even without meat, this pizza could be vibrant and delicious. Instead the sauce fell flat and the only spice I tasted was huge chunks of black pepper.  No basil, no oregano, nothing. just pepper.\nA real bummer was when the host (who I believe may be the owner) filled up our glasses (of purchased Italian still water) with tap water. awww man.", "author": "Nicole L."}

All of the ingredients were fresh and they had interesting food combinations. A lot of the pasta and pizza dishes had wild game or choice Italian cold cuts. My friend and I started off with a bottle of Terre Di Orazio 2007 and it was a mild red, with good acidic notes. It paired with our entrees and since it was raining cats and dogs outside, we decided to go with comfort food. I got the lamb, mozzarella, peppers pizza. The lamb was in little chunks and the cheese was creamy. The crust was crisp and thin. I also tried the ragu pasta with wild boar, tomato, parmigiano, and onions. The pasta was by far one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The pasta was little gonococci and was fresh and cooked perfectly. If I go back, the ragu is the only way to go. We both finished out meal with Affogato, which is fresh espresso poured over vanilla gelato. Its a small dish, so not good for sharing, but a perfect way to end an amazing meal.", "author": "Brigid T."}

We also ordered the potato pizza but by the time it arrived, we were already happily satiated, so we only tried it, with mixed opinions.  We also had 3 glasses of wine, one of which was for 2 oz. only, all were consumed without complaints :-)  But for a wine bar, they might be more convincing if they have more than the 7 or 8 wines by the glass for white or red to choose from.  In any case, the place definitely warrants another visit!", "author": "Yvette F."}

The wine was decent enough that I would have paid full price for it but I was very excited to get it half off.\nWe ordered a pizza, panini and a salad.  When the bill came the pizza and panini were both listed as full price.  When I asked our server he informed me that the happy hour only pertained to the items on the special list.  I said that I had not seen the special list (I think they gave it to boyfriend who never passed it over.)  and that it was my birthday and the happy hour pricing was why I had come + it did not say anything about a specials list on the yelp announcement.  The server was extremely gracious and apologized for my confusion and changed the bill without me having to ask.  \nHonestly I was not very impressed by the food (the salad and panini were a little bland and the pancetta on the asparagus & pancetta pizza was a little fatty and the chunks were too large) but I was very impressed with the fact that they were so nice and actually changed my bill that I am giving it 4 stars and would give this place another shot.   \nI would like to mention that although I did not try the cheese or charcuterie I was very impressed with the offered selection.

Really.  If you are looking for a spot to try out some Italian varietals and have a light, informal meal, this is a place you should definitely try.  If you are looking for a more traditional, 'stick to your ribs' kind of Italian dinner, you may be disappointed.  The menu is heavy on cured meat and cheese appetizers, panini, salads and small pizzas.  But everything I had was excellent, including the Pino Blanc.  The several glasses of Pinot Blanc, I might add.\n\nSo why only three stars?  Well, I was there on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend with my husband and 5-year old son.  The place was full, but no wait -- no wait to sit, that is.  First, we eat out a lot, often with the kid but not always.  The boy is definitely 5, but give him something to color and a plate of pasta and he is good to go almost anywhere.  We don't take him to Postrio type special-occasion places, but often to places every bit as nice as Uva.  He has been to numerous restaurants in the Castro and downtown, and we felt perfectly welcome and accomodated.  Uva is the first place I have taken him anywhere where I felt like the host looked at us like we were trying to bring a big wet dog into the restaurant.  And instead of sitting us at the available table for four near the door, he sat the THREE of us at a table for TWO in the back near the kitchen.  Remember the coloring comment above?  Try that at a tiny, crowded table with servers bustling by every 30 seconds.  Not that they were serving us, mind you.  We waited 15 minutes and then I asked the bartender to have a waiter take our order.  And then the food came slowly, we never got the bread that was supposed to come with our appetizer and the entres took forever.  My impression was that there was no owner or manager on site, just a number of hipsters waiting tables who needed to spend a week in a Denny's learning the trade.  One high point was the tall Latino guy busing the tables.  The ONLY person busing tables and he did it with alacrity and professionalism.  I would give him a raise and put him in charge of Uva's staff training program.\n\nIn short, nice place, good food, definitely mediocre service.  And save yourself a headache and don't bring children here.  Take them ANYWHERE else in the city.", "author": "Valerie W."}

Anyway, the servers were sooo nice and didn't mind at all that we only ordered 2 rounds of 1.50 draft beers and no food or wine, and that really matters when you stop into a place like this.  The rest of the clientele (about 1/3 full on a Sunday at 6pm) was chicly dressed-- out for an early Sunday dinner or wine and apps. Hip but certainly not hipster: kind of a Hayes Valley vibe but less pretentious I guess.  It was, to use a juxtaposition of words, a modern quaint.\n\nFor the 1.50 HH draft selection they were only serving Peroni.

Service is attentive and helpful, and they can help you try new wines you may not have any knowledge about. Oddly, the best thing I had here was their Viognier. Their cheese selection is also quite good and as others have noted, the truffle honey is great.\n\nThe bleah: they say they have a plate of serrano ham which tastes and looks likes something they bought up the street at corner store. Prepackaged deli cuts are just as good. Which is unfortunate, as false anticipation for serrano ham can be devastating.", "author": "EZ R."}

The owner himself took care of our table, and chose two wonderful wines for us, and made sure everything was perfect, without hovering.  If you go, do yourself a favor, make sure you order one of the pizzas, and save room for dessert.  Have something from each section of the menu, but be sure to hit those, without fail.  We ordered the radish and pear and romaine salad, which was perfect to share, and impeccably done; the carmelized onion pizza with prociutto -- oh my god, so good; the meatballs, which were heavy but delicious; and the chocolate budino, which was so delectable and sinful that we almost licked the cup clean; and the lavender and thyme panna cotta, which I thought might be too perfumey and herby, but it was subtle and light and utter perfection.  Decor is hip and understated, the energy is relaxed but efficient.  Really...loved every last aspect of it.  Will put it on my list of places to return to often.", "author": "Bumble B."}

It was for a 3-course Prix Fixe Dinner and Wine Pairings for Two for $70. \nSo I went there with my husband. The ambiance was nice, dimmed lighting works well for a romantic feel. But the music got way too loud towards 9.30-10PM. I couldn't hear my husband from across the table. \nThe menue for the Prix Fixe dinner on that BloomSpot deal was very limited, just 2 choices for each course and the portions were kinda small too. Which actually wasn't a bad thing, we were full by the end of the dinner, and not stuffed. \nA couple dishes definitely stood out. The burrata and strawberries salad is delicious! I strongly recommend it!The meat and cheese plate was good, although I didn't care for the apple, it was a bit strange, mixed with some kind of herb... but my husband liked it. The carbonara I had was WAY too salty. And I like salty. But this is the kind of salty that sends your veins into shock... I tried to pick out the pasta and wipe off all the excess of the sauce. Which wasn't exactly my idea of how you eat your pasta. \nI really liked the wine pairings, the wines were spot on. I even asked for the names of 2 of them, and our waitress brought me a piece of paper with types of the wines written on it. I wanted to know the names of the wineries and the year as well, but couldn't get this info out of her... No clue why. She kept saying that I can just get any Moscato at Bevmo, and it'll be the same.

After quickly seating us our server was very knowledgeable and recommended a couple wines-the joint carries only Italian wines so the common SF wino might have a little trouble. She recommended a $15 glass of white which seems a little high especially for a place with no actual kitchen but the waitress came over and filled a small carafe for us. Same deal with the red plus they have 2 beers on tap. We ordered a spicy cotto from petaluma and 3 cheeses all locally made. Cheese portions were smaller than I would have preferred but the richness of the food made up for the portions. The cotto was piled high when the platter arrived and combined really well with the cheeses that were rec commended.

Started off by ordering a bottle of wine. I was there with a friend who lived in Italy for a few years, and she selected a wine from the northern region where she used to live. Unfortunately, they were sold out of that bottle, but our server asked a few questions to determine why we'd picked that one, and then recommended that we try a wine that they'd just gotten into stock that wasn't even on the menu yet, but that he felt was really solid. He said there was another selection on their menu from the same winery as this new wine but that it was about twice the price point, so we should try the new one. I appreciated that he wasn't trying to \"up-sell\" us, and the wine he suggested was nothing short of PHENOMENAL. Extra points for him. \nFor dinner, we started with the brussel sprouts. They were prepared perfectly (not too bitter, perfect amount of oil, just fabulous). Then we decided to share a pasta dish and a pizza for the main course. We tried the Wild Boar Ragu and it was excellent. The four cheese pizza was also very good, a good size for two to split when one other main dish was ordered. Prices were all reasonable. \nThe vibe is very young and hip and it seemed totally random in lower haight but that actually made me like it more. It was a little loud, but in a way that just made it feel like a fun Friday night out on the town (it's probably not an ideal spot for a quiet dinner date on a Friday night, though). \nHonestly, we both left vowing to add this place to our \"rotation\" of favorite dinner spots in the city.

If you know your Italians wine- save yourself the trouble and buy a well priced one and enjoy it. If this were in some small town it would get higher marks b/c there would be no competition. But in SF, just head a short jaunt over to CAV on Market and see what a wine bar should be. Last night two of us dined at UVA. The place was 1/2-3/4 full but the service was like it was over capacity. When we did get our waitress, she didn't know the first thing about wine (this is a wine bar, right?). She went to get \"Bruno\". That took another 20 mins. When he did show up- it was like he couldn't care. i know a bit about wine but when i go to a place like UVA, it's to have people who really know and care about wine share their excitement and finds. In that aspect- it felt like we showed up just after the bong had been tapped. As to the food- stick with the prepared items (cheeses, olives, etc), they were well selected.

The service is great, knowledgable waiters and bartenders fill you in on the wine and food, but not in a pretentious way like some other places can be.  They offer tasting pours of all of their wines by the glass, so it's fun to get to try 2 or 3 different wines for what you'd spend on a full glass of just one.  I love the lambrusco - cold, red and sparkling (trust me!!) and they also happen to have fantastic cocktails if you aren't in the mood for wine.  But my favorite part is the little nibbles that you get for free!  The olives are AMAZING, they literally melt in your mouth.  If you order food you also get a little sampling of marcona almonds, a housemade jam (i've had the quince paste - yum!) and truffled honey (which is pretty much heaven in a tiny dish).

Once a few kinks are ironed out, this place MAY live up to the hype (all those Mario Batali graduates - as if this were a GOOD thing!).  At present, the service is spotty - very nervous and edgy servers who seem to have NO idea how to pour a glass of wine (in most wine-bars, they allow at least a brief GLANCE at the label).  Cheeses are excellent, in miniscule (perhaps 1/2 oz.) portions - no bread was offered, only pre-packaged airline-style breadsticks; but lovely condiments - honey (!), dried cherries and pear conserve - a nice complement to the salty cheeses. Small tables make it hard to have a selection of wines (the menu offers 2 oz \"tastes\") - three glasses plus the cheese board basically fills the table, making it hard to think about ordering more food.  Of course the bus-people are trained to whisk away half-empty glasses of wine and plates left unattended for more than a few seconds - this place is about rapid turnover, not fine dining.  A real disappointment.  Noise level rates a double-bomb (using the Chron's rating system).  Better food, better wine and actual service are readily available in the neighborhood (try Cafe du Soleil, just a block away).

First of all, make sure to make it to happy hour... you miss the dinner rush later in the evening and they have several $4 food items.

The wild boar pasta was good, but when I return I will probably stick to other items as it just was outclassed by them.  More importantly, this is a great place for wine tasting.  There are roughly 16-18 wines that you can get 2oz pours of [almost all for under $4] so it is possible to try a wide range of wines.  One could also try one of  the many bottles they have but that seems to miss the point of a wine bar... trying lots of wines.  I liked all of the 7 wines I tried... so either I got really lucky or they have done an excellent job of selecting wines so that most/all of the tasting/glass options are quite good.
