We had looked at the happy hours offerings and nothing seemed that appealing or heavily discounted so we had skipped happy hours and opted to go elsewhere priory to dinner.\n\nWe were there during last calls and ordered a Karl the Fog and a Bourbon Smash. The drinks took awhile to come and when it did, we realized why. The Karl the Fog is quite a spectacle, it came with a large round block of ice (not the cool clear kind you'd find at a hip bar) and a lid. When the waitress sat it down, she asked if we were ready and lifted the lid and a wisp of smokey cloud starting dissipating out of glass. For $1 more than than Bourbon smash, it was definitely worth it. It was a strong and super smokey drink, but tasty. Bourbon Smash was forgettable. I'd return just to get the Karl the Fog again though.", "author": "Linh H."}

Came for Sunday breakfast/brunch. My friend ordered off the menu while I tried their buffet. She ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and coffee. A couple minutes later the waitress came to say they don't have fresh pressed juice today. We said OK but we didn't order pressed juice. So then she asked us again what we ordered. Buffet was decent but nothing special. It didn't have an omelette station or a waffle station. The scrambled eggs were under done for my taste. The blueberry pancakes were good and so was the granola yogurt cups. The scones were the worst I ever had and I couldn't eat it. It was so dry you would think they were a month-old. When The corn beef hash and poached eggs came one poached egg was fine and the other was hard boiled so had to be sent back. Why the kitchen served it that way and why the waitress served it that way when it was obviously hard boiled is frustrating.

We're talking total eclipse, baby!\n\nEclipse Breakfast Buffet/ $28.95\n\nDuring my business trip to San Francisco,  my stay at the Hyatt Regency included breakfast buffets at Eclipse Kitchen & Bar.  Located in the world's largest hotel lobby, Eclipse Kitchen & Bar boast seasonal, locally-sourced food on their menu.  This includes cage-free eggs, hormone free milk & naturally cured bacon.  Being in a hotel lobby, a high price tag is du rigueur, but at Las Vegas buffet level price of admission, let's see how Eclipse' breakfast buffet measures up.\n\nDeli meat-\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eclipse-kitchen-and-bar-san-francisco-4?select=e2xO_Sqmmz0p3zs8ZnYbVQ\nBeing a highly enthusiastic carnivore, the deli meat were what I gravitated to the most.  The prosciutto was mouth-pleasingly tender & the Genoa salami unctuously salty.  But, the one I really piled on my plates every morning was the smoked salmon.  Sweet, oily & melt in your mouth, I was correct in not bringing fish oil on my trip, as I managed to pack away a pound of salmon to start my days every morning.  \n\nSmoked salmon-\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eclipse-kitchen-and-bar-san-francisco-4?select=M3DdrAFLnRTv2S7xVD0TFw\n\nAnother great dish on the buffet line was the baked corned beef hash.  I don't partake of corned beef that much, so this was quite a treat.  The crumbs on top provided a wonderful crunch with each bite of oily corned beef.\nBaked corned beef hash-\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eclipse-kitchen-and-bar-san-francisco-4?select=7T0Lk9fmgbzv7MYIE5psLg\n\nEggs benedict-\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eclipse-kitchen-and-bar-san-francisco-4?select=c16uwjhhtxqDLgBmq_oMjQ\nCan't be considered a fancy breakfast place w/o eggs benedict!  These more than held their own, as the eggs were cooked correctly.  \n\nThe usual breakfast buffet suspects were well represented.  Steel cut oatmeal, an endless mound of naturally cured bacon, scrambled eggs, huevos rancheros & pastries of various ilk.  Dessert options had fresh, seasonal fruit & parfaits.  Coffee and//or orange juice are included with the buffet.  I simply chose seltzer water w/ lime, as OJ gives me GI problems.\n\nService was good.  The buffet was constantly stocked with food, and our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  Plenty of seating, which I usually chose by the food.  Hey, easy access!\n\nThe Eclipse Kitchen & Bar is located in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the food & service at Eclipse Kitchen & Bar's breakfast buffet, at almost $30 before tax & tip, I wanted more.  Granted, it's in a swanky hotel, but I'd have expectations for  more swanky eats for the pricepoint.  I'm glad it was included with my stay, as I didn't go hungry.  In fact, I probably ate enough calories for 3 people after each meal.", "author": "Rodney S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-11", "description": "A solid 3.5 stars for happy hour at Eclipse Kitchen & Bar.  Located inside the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero, Eclipse certainly has the potential to be a popular spot for happy hours for local Fidi workers as well as hotel guests and tourists.  The lobby level has been renovated with modern, posh decor and an inviting ambiance.  Eclipse is located on this level and you cannot miss it.  The bar stands out as the main visual attraction, surrounded by different unique seating arrangements for any sized party.  They have community tables in the back, intimate booth seating on the sides with private overhangs, open lounge seating as well as tables for two with comfy sofa seats fit for a queen.  If any of those do not suit you, there is ample space at the bar.      \n\nFriend and I met up for happy hour shortly after 5pm on a weekday.  We choose to sit at one of the intimate booths with plenty of table space for us to order several dishes.  Our servers were friendly and quickly came to greet us and take drink orders. The menu has a good selection of appetizers, salads, burger/sandwiches, entrees, bar snacks and desserts - enough variety but not overwhelming.  Their cocktail menu is unique and there is also a good wine list.  Although the happy hour menu isn't extensive, their appetizers which are not listed on special pricing are still reasonably priced, especially comparing to other downtown SF happy hour menus.  They also have charcuterie and cheese plates, which are always a hit for happy hour especially with wine pairings. \n\nWe ordered several dishes, among those were definitely more hits than misses.  Every dish had nice presentation and portions were sufficient for sharing.\n- Shoestring Truffle Fries ($8): I love shoestring fries and these did not disappoint.  The portion was a huge heaping serving. They were perfectly fried without being greasy or soggy.  There was enough truffle flavor but we could have used a little more. \n- Potstickers ($12):  5 chicken and veggie potstickers came abed a sweet/savory soy sauce.  They were cooked just right with a crispy exterior.  Flavor and texture were on point. \n- Classic Ensenda Fish Tacos ($18): The portion came with two decently sized tacos and sides of sour cream and chili.  The battered fish pieces were ample and had a mild spicy kick.  I thought the slaw wasn't as fresh as it could have been as the cabbage was a bit wilted, making it a little stringy and difficult to eat.  Nice touch with the slice of avo on top. \n- Giant Baked Meatball ($14): I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it was made with lamb meat, so had to try.  The meatball was indeed giant, accompanied with two grilled pieces of garlicy sourdough.  A spicy tomato sauce accompanied the meatball for added flavor.  Conceptually a wonderful dish, but the meatball itself was just way to salty for our palettes.  \n- Cocktails ($15 each): I tried the Castro (virgin) and friend had the Mission.  Cute concept of having cocktails named after different neighborhoods in SF.  I thought the drink was well balanced even though I had a nonalcoholic one.  However, lacking was the presentation.  They were served in regular glasses (the same we had for our waters) without any type of garnishes.  I'd expect a little more pizazz for a $15 drink.  \n\nI also noticed that the happy hour times at Eclipse were 3:00-5:30pm.  I'd suggest having a later window for happy hour to draw in more foot traffic.  With so many bars/restaurants in FiDi, there has to be something enticing to get the patrons to come by.  It would be nice to have more happy hour drink specials as well.  Overall, a pleasant experience at Eclipse.  I wouldn't mind going back to try a few other dishes and dessert.  The ambiance is welcoming and comfortable.  Compared to a bar, you don't have to yell over other conversations and loud music.  By the time we left around 7pm, there was a good amount of people who came for an after work drink and bite to eat.  Most of the seating was occupied as was the bar area.  Not the rowdy, young crowd but more catering to a sophisticated and mature clientele.  The location is right above the Embarcadero Bart/Muni station so it is very convenient for those taking public transportation.", "author": "Liv A."}

I like what they've done with the place, having frequented the Hyatt for its food and drink for the past ten years. \n\nI am hesitant to praise any further because of how much they've hiked the prices since revamping the bar and lounge areas. One might argue, reasonably I might add, that it serves the sleeker environment to charge more for what they've got. However, I have never once paid $6 for a cup of black coffee -- not anywhere, not ever. Not New York, LA, country clubs, outer space -- you get my point. \n\n$17+ cocktails are pricey but not unforeseen in San Francisco. $19 breakfast items are not unheard of at exceptional hotels. But a $6 cup of coffee? Come on. That's absurd, and we're knowingly suckers paying for it. \n\nMy patronage here has obviously receded over the years, and nowadays it's close to nothing. Over time I had gotten well acquainted with the staff, and they're why I would continue coming back. The people make the place.

We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken in about five minutes of seating. Our water glasses were removed and we had to ask for water to be returned. After our drinks came we then sat for another ten minutes watching about 5 waiters wander around clearing tables, offering juice, and generally ignoring us. We had our menus turned upside down to indicate (shouldn't have had to this) that we were ready to order and still were ignored. Our waitress finally appeared from the back and took our order. I was already ticked off from the wait.\n\nI think part of the confusion can be associated with the breakfast buffet as many of the people in the restaurant seemed to take advantage of that (looked super tasty but too pricy for my taste since I wanted a cocktail), yet you would think even in that case when servers have less to do they would be more attentive.\n\nI got the corned beef hash with a 'spicy Bloody Mary sauce' and poached eggs (I asked for medium on the eggs). My husband got the two eggs (over easy) with bacon and toast. When our food came out my eggs were decidedly not medium and his were almost cooked through.

If that's not farm-to-table, don't know what is! Old menus were examined and re-created on tin trays to commemorate the occasion...

When the menu says strawberry pur\u00e9e without the word FRESH it means they're using that craptastic daiquiri mix. Don't order it!

I opted for the breakfast buffet - which was pretty good as breakfast buffets go - although very expensive. I had their corned beef hash, which appeared to made from scratch and with real shredded corned beef. I also tried a link of sausage, some bacon, breakfast potatoes, and scrambled eggs, plus a bit of smoked salmon and a glass of pink grapefruit juice. Everything was reasonably hot and tasty.\n\nThe other times in here were in the evening - a couple of times for a bite to eat and/or drinks. I tried their Burger - I forget what came on it, it was served with some crisp, tasty sweet potato fries and a side of crisp slices of dill pickle. Overall, a good burger . Another evening I got an order of their garlic fries - topped with fresh garlic sauce with herbs in it - very fragrant and pungent - yet the fries still retained that wonderful crispness and texture.\n\nThey serve a local craft beer here - \"Big Daddy IPA\" (Speakeasy Ales & Lagers), which is served in bottles. A nice IPA - somewhat on the light side from a hops perspective, but other than that, nicely balanced in terms of citrus and pine notes.\n\nThey also make a good dirty vodka martini here, although I was disappointed there was no option for blue cheese or gorgonzola stuffed olives (all they offer are standard pimento stuffed olives).\n\nService was good.

This lounge/restaurant is located in the Hyatt Regency hotel lobby and, since it was the holidays, the millions of twinkly string lights had the place glowing softly. It was absolutely beautiful (this is one of my favorite places to see during the holiday season because of those lights).\n\nI had ordered their alcoholic apple cider (also a holiday staple and I believe only part of their holiday menu). It's a warm drink in a cute, fluted mug with a cinnamon stick floating around inside and liberally splashed with whiskey.\n\nIt was amazing. The warm drink was just what I needed to keep me toasty from the winter chill outside. My coworkers (Boyfriend, too!) thought that the drink was sweet, but not overly so because the whiskey cut the cider just right. And with the floating cinnamon stick adding just that right touch of holiday spice kick, I was enjoying myself immensely. My only complaint would be the price -- it was pretty much $10 to get this cocktail (though compared to most San Francisco touristy prices, I guess it really isn't THAT bad).\n\nWe seated ourselves at one of those weird booth-table things with the raised bar chair/stools for seating. Sadly, every single one of our chairs were too high for the table height (since we were at the part that dipped shorter in the middle), but we just sat back a bit and enjoyed ourselves.\n\nStaff never insisted that we take a menu or seemed to want to hurry us along after we had finished our round of drinks and were just relaxing and chatting. They simply left us be after we turned down food and we were able to sit down, relax and just chitchat at our leisure without any disapproving servers staring at us in order to silently hurry us along.

First course was a chicken tortilla soup, which had pretty good depth of flavor to it. A slight hint of a kick from the spices and a nice crunch from the tortilla strips. Second course---the fish tacos---was where disappointment hit. While I appreciate the choice of corn tortillas and slaw-like lettuce, the fish was not seasoned at all. AT ALL! So the entire dish was bland and flavorless. The beans on the side reminded me of something they dished up back in elementary school.

Then we asked if they can just do plain grilled chicken just salt & pepper no spices.

The lobby of the Hyatt Regency San Francisco is worth checking out.  We came in to see the magnificent lobby, but stayed to enjoy a beverage in the Eclipse lounge and ride in the retro glass elevators.\n\nOur jaws dropped as we stepped into the 7 million cubic foot atrium lobby, considered by the Guinness Book as the world's largest.  On the lobby floor, Charles Perry's 40-foot tall anodized aluminum sculpture entitled \"Eclipse\" hovers over a square-sided fountain, where thin sheets of water flow over its vanishing edges.  Overhead, a cascade of over 300,000 white lights rain down from above.\n\nFortunately, our visit coincided with the 4:30 to 6:30 daily happy hour in the Eclipse lounge, where my domestic lager only set me back $4.  After a long day of sight-seeing, we appreciated the posh couches and soft sleek chairs, spaced far enough apart so that our conversations could remain low-volume and private.\n\nFor a little high anxiety after happy hour, we rode the iconic glass elevators to the top of the atrium.  We rose smoothly at 500 feet per minute in the illuminated capsules trimmed in polished brass.  Although the ride was free, it is not recommended for the acrophobic.\n\nThe Hyatt Regency deserves three stars for its record-setting and awe-inspiring atrium lobby, comfortable lounge and daily happy hour specials, and exciting elevator rides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-15", "description": "I must preface this review by saying that I know it's long.  Please bear with me as I have provided detail, especially in the end section about why this place was bad, in order to help provide clarity and to demonstrate with specificity the bases for my review and justification for being able to rely on it.  \n\nWe just went here yesterday evening, 14 Dec. 2013, after a day in the city and were exceedingly disappointed to say the least, making it a rather poor end to the day.  We have been visiting the Hyatt, and periodically getting food and drink here since I was a kid when the hotel was new but this is the first time in about 3-4 years that we had gotten any drinks or food here.\n\nThe lobby of the Hyatt is magnificent, unless you hate modern architecture.  It is huge, open, with wonderful angles, sloping sides, balconies, wonderful fountain, etc., making it, in terms of decor, feel and ambience, always a delight to visit.  It is thus a great place to have a lounge/bar or eatery.Thus, for ambience, the place is a sure-fire 5 stars all the way.\n\nFirst, I must get out of the way the issue of prices: prices are high - $13 for a manhattan is high no matter the quality.  That, however, goes without saying given that it's in this hotel and in San Francisco.  With the ambience, the price could be, and has been, at least bearable and sometimes definitely worth it.\n\nBut not this time.\n\nThe food, meat loaf sliders and garlic fries were very good and enjoyable, but not outstanding.  They were hardly subtle or very memorable, but they were enjoyed by all and we would get them again.  They would be an easy 3 stars of of yelp's 5, possibly as high as 3.5, and worth the try in order to have something to eat whilst relaxing in this lovely space.\n\nHowever, and this is a huge however, the drinks (at the aforementioned high prices), were beyond dreadful.  They were the worst cocktails, and for the kids, virgin cocktails we have EVER had ANYWHERE.  They were easily on par with, if not worse, than the \"cocktail\" I had some years ago at Rainforest Cafe, a horrid place which I hope never to enter again (see my review on that).  \n\nI want to make clear that this evaluation can be trusted as my wife and I are serious cocktail drinkers and cocktail makers, and have been for years. We drink everything from serious old-fashioned drinks like Old Fashioneds, Martinis (by which I mean the only drink that I would ever call a Martini - gin and vermouth and, if you like, some form of bitters) or Manhattans to a wide range of \"Tiki\" drinks.  We know good quality and we know what goes into proper drinks.  We also appreciate good-quality cocktails.  That said, we are fairly forgiving and usually at least enjoy even less-than-stellar cocktails.  \n\nHere, we had an Old Fashioned, a Manhattan, and for a daughter a virgin strawberry cooler-type drink.  All were absolutely horrid.  First, the Old Fashioned is bourbon/ rye, bitters, a little sugar/simple syrup (and if you like an orange slice and cherry), nothing more.  The Manhattan is bourbon/rye, vermouth, and bitters.  The menus described them properly, listing the above-mentioned ingredients and stating that they were with Maker's Mark bourbon.  The kid's drink was to be Sierra Mist with strawberry puree and maybe something else.  No way did the drinks we were actually served even remotely fit the descriptions.  The whisky drinks were pale, the colour of diluted Irish whiskey, which is much more pale than bourbon.  They were basically just sweet and tasted very slightly of a hint of bourbon, both the colour and the flavour making it obvious that they were both VERY, VERY HEAVILY watered down.  I asked to have mine remade and when it came back, it looked and tasted like the same drink with a bunch of Everclear (high-proof, raw, unaged grain alcohol) added.  It was simply more full than before, at least as pale if not more pale and now tasted only of raw, rough, harsh alcohol, with no sweetness, orange, or even bourbon flavour noticeable at all.  As bad as the first drink was, this was worse.  \n\nOur daughter's drink was simply plain club soda with a little bit of strawberry something (syrup?  It did not seem like an actual puree), just enough to make it red and give the faintest hint of strawberry.  \n\nNot one of us could finish the drinks.", "author": "Wulfstan C."}

We were seated promptly, and our servers were nice, although we did have to flag them down a few times toward the end of our meal (plus, I'm pretty sure my wine had initially been forgotten about, and that took awhile...). \n\nNonetheless, we enjoyed the food brought to us and they featured Drakes hefeweizen for a decent price, which our out-of-towners seemed to enjoy very much!

My salad came out without any dressing so I had to wait 5 or 10 minutes after I pointed it out to get some dressing.  My wife's tea didn't come until after we had finished our apps.  My fish dish--supposedly black cod-- tasted like it had been frozen, thawed, refrozen and then left out--basically mush.   My wife's pot stickers were quite tasty but her steak was mediocre and I'm not convinced it was really from Niman Ranch. \nMy recommendation:  If you are staying in the hotel and really don't feel like walking across the street to have much better food and you don't mind having boring tasteless food in a nice setting, this place is for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-09", "description": "After wandering on the Embarcadero to soak in the gorgeous views of the bay (and the frigidly cold weather), my friends and I found ourselves in search of alcohol to warm our bodies.  Unfortunately, casual bar options are apparently slim by the Ferry Building at 10:00 on a Friday night, so we opted for the Hyatt's hotel bar out of convenience.  Maybe next time, we'll search a little harder.\n\nAfter grabbing a table, I ordered a Diamond Gin and Tonic for my first round.  Now, if you know what makes it \"diamond\", please feel free to let me know.  Other than running for $12, I'm not too sure what sets it apart from a regular sort of gin and tonic - it was pretty average.  After that, we just switched to beer for our second/last round to keep it light (didn't pay for that one, so not sure how much those cost).\n\nFeeling a little hungry, we also decided to order a snack to split for the table.  I'm not sure if this was the exact name, but we ended up ordering the Olde English Club Sandwich (turkey, bacon, fried egg, lettuce, and tomato) that came with a side of seasoned fries.  The sandwich was actually pretty decent compared to most I've had (I credit the fried egg), but I think the fries were the winner.  It's hard not to like crispy french fries (especially with a drink in hand), but it's harder to say that it was worth it when it was $15.\n\nService is pretty mediocre - they got the job done, but could certainly be better...and faster.  Once we were ready to go, it took quite some time for our check to be brought to us, and just as long for them to bring back the tab for the slip to be signed.  Despite about a half dozen staff members just kind of hanging out at the bar together, it seems like no one was able to help our table table except for our specific waitress, who would disappear from time to time.  Talk about inefficient.\n\nSituated in the lobby of the Hyatt, the relaxed ambiance and attractive decor are the only redeeming qualities.  Considering options are a little light in the financial district area at night, it's not terrible if you're a tourist or in the area, but certainly not a place to go out of the way for.

The spread is sizeable; the \"cold\" section has oatmeal, yogurt, parfaits, lox, cold cut platter, cheese (brie and feta on that day), an assortment of croissants and muffins, toast, bagels, and fresh fruit. The \"hot\" section has your standard bacon, sausage, eggs, hash, breakfast potatoes, and an omelet station. I found myself satisfied with at almost every item, and impressed especially with the parfaits (put fresh berries with mascarpone cheese together and you've won my heart over instantly), bacon (it's hard to cook bacon well, especially in bulk; this was thick and cirspy), and eggs (again - it's hard to make good scrambled eggs, and these were perfectly creamy). The quality of the sausage is lower than the other items, in my opinion (chunky and a weird, almost artificial taste), and I think I can make a better omelet since these were overcooked. Still, the majority of the items were fresh and well executed.  I like my breakfasts. This one pleased me.\n\n(A word about price - the whole breakfast spread is $23.95 but you can just get the cold items (the continental breakfast) for $15 - they don't advertise this.)", "author": "Clarice W."}

The squash soup was delicious, one of the better we've had. Salad was all right but the combination of flavors and textures did not come together in my mouth. The turkey was very good - tender and not dry - but it was the stuffing that stole the show.\n\nThe only complaint I had was that they'd run out of our dessert choices, but as I'm a health-conscious eater that didn't matter quite as much. Also the server (a different one from our waiter) should not have brought each dish out immediately while we were still eating.

I'd had a big lunch so I just wanted something simple and small.  I ended up going to the Eclipse Restaurant in the Hyatt Regency in the Embarcadero area of SF.  I decided on eating here because they had soups, salads, and \"small plates.\"  \n\nThe restaurant's menu had lots of good options, and I appreciated how the restaurant used local, organic, and sustainable ingredients.  I got the \"small plate\" of crab cakes, which were some of the best crab cakes I've ever had.  They had a nice, crispy crust and great texture between the outside and inside.  The 2 sauces, a creamy one and balsamic one, served with the dish were very tasty - I ate both of them right up with the crab cakes since the flavors went well together.  I also really liked the side dish of sweet corn and jicama - it was very refreshing and I found the whole meal to be simply delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Ferry Building Farmer's Market Seasonal Fruit Cobbler with Streusal Topping.  The seasonal fruit filling was made of apples and cherries and the dish was topped with ice cream.  The plate was HUGE AND was quite tasty.  I only ate about 1/2 of it because it was so big.  \n\nThe restaurant was pretty quite as I went in pretty late around 9pm.  There were a few random business people scattered about but the place was pretty quiet and I liked the relaxing low-lit space.  The atrium is pretty neat looking with lots of plants along the interior balconies and funky-looking elevators.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and took good care of me.  She was very friendly and could see that I wanted to have a slow, relaxing meal and gave me plenty of space.  She also got all my food to me promptly so I was comfortable but not waiting on her.  A man in a suit, presumably the manager, even stopped by to check in on how I was doing.\n\nMy meal was slow, steady, and relaxing and made the perfect end to a long, busy day.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and look forward to returning.", "author": "Diana B."}

We chose from the dine about town menu.  There was not much to choose from, it was either a salad, salmon burger or the steak sandwich.  The waiter recommended the steak sandwich.  Most of us ordered the steak sandwich and the rest, the salmon burger.\n\nThe salmon burger was...gross. It tasted like fish bait.  I couldn't even finish 1/4 of my burger.  The steak sandwich was just as bad.  It was flavorless and really chewy.\n\nThe service was bad.  The waiter kept on taking our fries when we asked them not to...and they hardly refilled our waters.\n\nIn short, I will never come back to this place.", "author": "nancy b."}

Nice array of menu choices for lunch--salads, sandwiches and hot entrees. Very gracious and attentive service. It's a nice space to the side of the dramatic lobby. What I especially appreciated was the quiet. We could actually have a nice conversation without the need to shout. This is a rarity in the neighborhood! A little pricey, but good food in a lovely atmosphere and great service.", "author": "Joanna S."}

For DAT it was a good deal, but I don't think the food is worth the prices they charge. The reason this places gets four stars is because of the amazing service. Eddie and Tony were both friendly and attentive, and they really made the experience great. I'm not dying to go back for the food, but I do want to go back because of the service.

This employee rate let us eat at the restaurant for half off. I was pretty sad that the menu was so limited as opposed to the in dining menu. 3 of us came to eat and start drinking before another night out. One of us got clam chowder, another got the quesadilla and I got the garlic and chicken pizza along with a bloody mary, a mojito and I got a dirty martini. The quesadilla came out and looked like taquitos. Plating wasn't really anything special, probably the same way they would plate at an Applebee's. The seating was nice, it had a lounge feel to it. We were really confused when we walked up because no one greeted us or told us where we could sit so after a few minutes of standing we sat down at the end of the bar. I'm not sure about everyone else food and drink but my pizza was yummy, the bartender (Bobbi, I think) looked at me as if she knew I wouldn't finish it and brought extra plates for me to share but I eat a lot and even though I only ate half my pizza, I definitely looked forward to eat the rest of it when we came back from the club. My dirty vodka martini was also pretty good, not too olive-y and not too vodka-y. I think our bill came out to around $60, but like I said, half off the food and happy hour drinks. Happy hour is from 4:30-7:30 EVERYDAY. Not the best service but some of the servers were really helpful when we were planning our bar-hopping before clubbing.\n\nThey have normal bar food, burgers, salads, soups, pizzas. Not much else.", "author": "Mariko B."}

Sort of.  \n\nExcept the patio was the 3rd-floor lobby of the Hyatt Regency, and the stars were track lights hung high overhead in the 18-story atrium.  About 8 stories up, the hallways and rooms hung directly overhead.  The spaciousness was accented by a skylight way up over the 18th floor. Flowers and trees in the cafe helped create the outdoor illusion.  The flowers were real, the trees were fake.  For a moment I was transported to the Blue Bayou in Disneyland.  \n\nA HOT Russian girl had invited me to meet her here.  Quiet groups of businesspeople gathered around the tables.  Suits and ties were all that we saw in this half-filled, little-known haven.  It was clearly an expense-account rendezvous.  \n\nShe had tea and a Caesar salad with crab cakes.  I discovered the new menu section of \"signature trios,\" and ordered the Caesar, two crab cake sliders, and french fries, with a diet Coke.  The HOT Russian girl paid the bill, $51 plus tip.  \n\nTwo paid-for lunches in two weeks!  I'm on a roll here!", "author": "David D."}

Consequently, I've never had to pay, and that I'm glad of.  The service is usually okay, but if you catch someone at the end of their shift they will definitely let you know it.  I think they are used to tourists who they will never see again.  There's usually a vegetarian option or two, but nothing is all that memorable or remarkable.  My boss's chicken Caesars he always gets look really dry and unappetizing.  Its kind of a standby though because you know they will have something for everyone and will very likely have a table.  Because its in an enormous atrium the acoustics are kind of strange and if you're with more than one person it can be hard to hear.  Its also kind of drafty.

The food here at breakfast time is pretty damn good.  The pancakes are great and the eggs cooked perfectly.  I'm not sure what syrup they use for the pancakes, but its really good stuff.  The plates actually come out hot and pretty damn quick; so quick I wonder how they do it.  The coffee drinks were good too.  I must say, I had my doubts and had low expectations, but it isn't that bad.\n\nI've also had lunch here twice recently, and I must say its pretty good.  I had the bbq pork sandwich and crab cakes as well as the fish and chips.  I checked with the chefs and the pork is slow roasted for about 4 hours. The crab cakes and crab sandwiches are freshly made with a home made remoulade.  The breads they use for the pork sandwich and crab cakes are really soft and good.  The fish for the fish and chips are made with fresh pacific snapper.  The clam chowder and french onion soup are really really good, also homemade in-house.  It surprises me that most of the items are freshly prepared as most hotels tend to stick with frozen products.  The salads are tasty and the  club sandwiches are pretty good too.   \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice.  The service was good and the staff were pretty friendly.  Nice open overhead with the atrium.  A very nice place to relax.  The prices are steep, as with most hotel restaurants, but the food I had definitely isn't lacking.\n\nI seem to have a really good time every time I come into this hotel, although I've never tried dinner here before.", "author": "Phat Hippo L."}

It was supposed to be a special day. At 11:30 a.m. THANKSGIVING DAY I got a call from the restaurant saying they weren't serving their Thanksgiving meal until 4 pm. That was too late because we had other plans.  The restaurant did try to find us a reservation elsewhere.  The only thing they came up with was The Waterfront and it was a lot more expensive plus I didn't know what was on the menu.  The restaurant blames Open Table and I haven't heard back from them.  Ended up eating at Mel's Diner because it was the only place we could get in and out of in a reasonable time.  Not exactly what I had in mind for a special Thanksgiving dinner.

It's a mixed bag depending on where you sit and who's serving you. I like the burgers once in a while.  Today, they had to do a redo as they burned the burger and the inside was too pink. Don't understand how they can make a delicious nonburned burger 2 weeks ago and today both burgers were inedible.  The women servers are more attentive then most of their men waiters.  Concepcion is excellent and is always the first to bring me some bread. Roni is another waitress that is totally aware of what her customers like and is on top of everything.  For the most part, the men waiters leave a lot to be desired.  There are a few who are attentive, and I guess it depends on what day of the week it is.  Really makes me mad when one of their managers comes out and apologizes for the lousy burger and tells me that's the way they cook them...Nope, I've had better there. I'm going to stop going there for a while.  Maybe they'll fire their Chinese chef and get someone who knows how to make a good burger.", "author": "Nina P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-28", "description": "I was staying at the Hyatt last weekend, visiting some family in the Bay Area, and had dinner at the Eclipse on a Saturday night. We were able to get seated quickly and the food was actually quite tasty and thoughtfully prepared. The service, however, was among the worst I have ever received. I had to ask for drinks (no wine list was provided, nor any wines by the glass explained), and the waiter offered no explanation of any of the selections. He served the wrong plates to several members of my party. The worst, however, is that I ordered a small salad to start and then a more substantial entree, as did everyone else at the table. However, when everyone else's entrees were served, the waiter did not bring mine. I waited a few moments. Nothing. I tried to wave him over. Nothing. Did not even look at me. Finally I was able to call his attention to our table. \"Yes?\" he asked. \"Ummm,\" I said, \"I don't have my food.\" \"You didn't order anything,\" he said. \"Yes, I did, \" I replied. \"I ordered the salmon.\" \"No you didn't,\" he said. Another member of my party said, \"yes, she did. I heard her,\" and he reluctantly placed the order. By the time I received my food, everyone was nearly done with theirs. Was an apology offered? No. Were dessert or drinks comped? No. Did the waiter ever come by to ask how the meal was, or if we needed another drink? Nope. Later, I read that the Hyatt is experiencing some labor problems (read: they are anti-union). They should work within the union to try to retain professional, experienced employees. As it stands now, I would never recommend the restaurant to anyone.", "author": "Kaye O."}
