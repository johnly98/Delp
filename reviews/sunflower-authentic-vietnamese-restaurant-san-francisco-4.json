I mean it is certainly not a fancy restaurant with beautiful decor or excellent services with co\u00fbteux beverages and menu. Let's be real. This location is a to go restaurant thus, everything about it is Fast and Furious (*^o^*)\n\nI knew through the review so I didn't come with any high expectation. My aim was 'Canh Chua' coz apparently many reviewers said it was their signature dish. Man, it tastes best with rice. The pineapple (sweet and sour) will drive your tastebud nut! A big disappointment...they stopped carrying the dish. The waitress told me it was too sweet to the majority of customers (perhaps non-Vietnamese duh!). Unfortunately, it is also their main paycheck *sigh*\n\nNo way to get out now. I went on ahead and ordered Imperial rolls with lemon grass marinated beef noodle-my go to dish. It was salty. The mixed fish sauce was even saltier. Mediocre tasting.\n\nI gave five stars for the fast, friendly service. The authentic kitchen-plus the staff. Felt like coming back to the HK street food style. My VN coffee was prep once order. I've always found pleasure in watching the black filter coffee drop...slowly into the white condensed milk. Relaxing.", "author": "Bao V."}

I imagine that most diners go to the larger eponymous Sunflower Vietnamese around the corner, but I kinda like the casual environment here of watching the takeout customers come and go.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup: A no frills pho bo that gets the job done.  No choice of beef parts, just thin slices that are transforming from rare-to-well-done as the bowl travels to your table.  I'm glad there wasn't any chewy tripe or slimy tendon.  But I kinda missed having meatballs.  In addition to the traditional accouterments on the side plate, there was a pleasant amount of herbs and thin onion slices floating on top of the broth.  I love me some cilantro, so that was perfect.  What I really appreciated was the generous amount of broth.  I'll gladly trade some rice noodles if extra soup fills the space.  Their broth wasn't as amazing as Bodega Bistro's, but was pretty tasty.", "author": "Adam B."}

Everything I have tried so far is delicious.\n\nInitially I went in to try a soup. I was not a fan of the hot and sour soup. I then discovered their noodle soups and always go there when I am in the mood for some chicken noodle soup with extra vegetables for about $10 total.\n\nI then heard about their garlic noodles. There is no way I can go there without ordering this. It is a huge portion starting at $8 without chicken or extra vegetables. It is maybe enough for one extremely hungry person, plenty for two, and three can still share this with a  side of something else. Either way, this is my absolutely favorite thing here, and a must try.\n\nIf you are looking for some starters, you can't go wrong with their imperial rolls or spring rolls.\n\nSo happy I found this gem! Just a heads up, they have a small location on 16th street, between Valencia St. and Albion St., and another bigger location right around the corner on Valencia St. between 16th and 17th. They are literally a 30 second walk from each other. Enjoy!", "author": "Kassie E."}

It also helped that it was after the usual lunch hour when people normally sat down for their noon meal. Our waitress was pleasant but had to ask the chef every time we had a question or request. We could not tell whether she was doing that because she did not know the menu well. We could see her approaching the chef over and over with our questions (it was easy to see that because the kitchen area was bigger than the eating area). Anyway, we started with the Tofu Spring Rolls (I think they were bland and boring) and for main course I got the Lemongrass Chicken Noodle Bowl. My entree was amazing!

We stumbled in today after I finished my haircut near by looking for some spicy, warm food and this really fit the bill. While we initially came in looking for noodle soup or Pho, we saw these amazing lunch specials for $10.95 that included an entree, an imperial roll, a salad and a cup of hot and sour soup. Needless to say, we were sold immediately. \n\nI ordered the Lemongrass Chicken (#3) lunch special and my boyfriend got the BBQ Pork (#2) lunch special. We were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived 10 minutes later on these huge platters. Both entrees were phenomenal (tasty, well cooked and fresh) and the portions were substantial. I was a huge fan of the hot and sour soup with its distinct taste of pineapple. My boyfriend found the taste a bit overwhelming but was really into the Imperial Roll. The side salad was a refreshing, light slaw. We both were extremely happy with our meals and neither of us finished our plate which for us, is really remarkable.\n\nThe only thing I didn't love was how cramped the seating was. We were at a communal table and really felt like we were on top of the group next to us. I believe this is a temporary situation for Sunflower, however, so hopefully their other space is a bit more forgiving.\n\nOverall, I cannot wait to come back and try more on the menu.

The vegetarian pho is also the best I've had so far - simple soup base but full of flavor - probably from the french fried onion toppings. They don't skimp on the fresh veggies either. \n\nThe veg imperial rolls are excellent - the filling is delicious and it's perfectly crisped on the outside. Also not as greasy as you would expect. Prices are great ($10-12 a dish) for the huge portions you get. \n\nThe place is tiny with an open kitchen - fits at most ~20 ppl so I would not bring a large party here.

Apparently, Mau closes at 3 pm on Sundays, a realization which brought me to Sunflower to satisfy my noodle soup craving on a windy SF afternoon. My boyfriend and I were seated on the inside of a few tables pushed together to form one communal table. During our meal, two couples were seated next to us but asked to sit elsewhere (one at a separate table for two, and the other at the bar). Kind of odd that the staff would offer the seats next to us first. \n\nThe service we received was not rude but it was very impersonal. Our order was taken and food was brought out very quickly - Thai iced teas witching 5 minutes, my soup within 8 minutes and my boyfriend's BBQ chicken noodle dish within the next 5 minutes after mine came out. Weird order, but at least it gave me time to season my pho before my boyfriend got his food. \n\nHaving had Mau two days before eating here and being super pleased with that meal, I'll compare this to that. Sunflower's broth was much less flavorful and the cut of meet was thin and did not melt in my mouth the way Mau's does. \n\nMy boyfriend was not too impressed with the BBQ chicken noodle dish as a whole, but he said the spring rolls that came with his dish were excellent. \n\nAuthenticity note - Sunflower bills itself as pan Asia cuisine but I suspect it is best known for its Vietnamese offerings.

So if your picking up to take home and put in a big bowl- it's great. However, when your eating at the park it's a no go hassle lol. You have to build your soup and pretty much dump some of the broth out in order for all the other ingredients to fit and not overflow the container, I didn't even try bothering to add the extra veggies and just at them on the side. But I guess that's the thing about pho it's really meant to be eaten at a table out of a big bowl, so I can't complaint too much on that note. \n\nThe broth itself was very plain, but that's good health wise didn't taste any salt at all. When you add all the other ingredients in and perhaps a bit of boysenberry sauce or siracha and let it marinate for a good 5 minutes then you haves yourself decent tasting pho. \n\nThe atmosphere inside is very basic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "I find that Vietnamese restaurants often have a trade-off:\n- Authentic restaurants lack presentation and ambiance (unless you are optimistic and embrace shabbiness by passing it off as hole-in-the-wall), plus the menu is sometimes difficult to read unless you know the dishes by their Vietnamese names.  \n- Non-authentic restaurants often have far nicer presentation and ambiance plus understandable menus, but they're well, not authentic.  \n\nFinally I come across Sunflower, which has Instagrammable presentation, a clean and modern ambiance, a clear menu with descriptions, and as far as my (disclaimer: non-Vietnamese) self knows, is authentic.  \n\nI got the FIVE SPICE CHICKEN VERMICELLI ($9).  No matter how hard I tried, I failed to detect five spices and it turned out more like a tasty grilled chicken--maybe it was one spice or five spice in minute quantities, but tasty nonetheless.  It went well with the vermicelli, carrots, and lettuce over fish sauce, though I was surprised to find a piece of broccoli stem in the mix.  I also liked the imperial rolls, which usually cost extra at other restaurants.  The style was interestingly similar to Lao fried spring rolls: savory, filling, and with a mild crisp carefully tuned not to be too crunchy but avoiding sogginess.  As a whole, the portions of my vermicelli bowl were huge!  I am not one of those girls who eats half the food and complains about being full, but I actually was full after eating just half of it.  \n\nMy friends really liked the CRAB FRIED RICE ($9), which looked good but I was too preoccupied at tackling my giant bowl of vermicelli to try it.  The VIETNAMESE CREPE (banh xeo for those who have been to enough authentic Vietnamese restaurants to understand Vietnamese menus) is listed under appetizers but it's big enough to be an entree.  I liked the slightly burnt crepe and the filling of assorted meats and vinegary bean sprouts.\n\nMost entrees are under $10 except for fancy ones like the flaming beef and prawns.

The atmosphere is fine - it's deep in the heart of the Mission, so there are many more upscale options, and many less refined options as well. This was fine. The waiter did not seem to be very attentive, nor concerned with service. It seemed as though he was \"just doing his job,\" and had very little training in customer service. There were no serious problems, but he never ingratiated us to their venue - he added no value to the experience. But we enjoyed our food and it was a nice time with old friends. My vegetarian friends have been eating here for years, so that's something on the positive side. The papaya salad was the best. The garlic noodles were very ordinary.

I've been pretty disappointed in the Vietnamese food in San Francisco so far but I'm slowly making my way through all of them. Authenticity usually equals quality but not always, so I'm willing to give these joints a shot.\n\nFirst impressions were so so. I came in with the husband and his dad for lunch on Labor Day and we were the only Asians in there. One look at the menu with zero Vietnamese on it and we were definitely raising our eyebrows at each other. We asked the waitress if she spoke Vietnamese so we could ask some questions, answer was no.\n\nI ordered the #1 lunch special which was five spice chicken, soup, salad and imperial roll. \"What soup is it?\" \"Hot and sour.\" Um, hot and sour soup is Chinese but okay. The husband ordered the vermicelli (bun) bowl with pork (thit nuong) and the dad ordered crab fried rice. \n\nI'm very curious about this five spice chicken dish I've seen on almost every Vietnamese restaurant menu here. I've never heard of it before, dad says it's a Chinese thing. My plate comes out and it is humongous. The soup is actually canh chua and not bad tasting. The salad is cabbage and carrots and flavored like traditional goi. The eggroll is very traditional, wrapped in rice paper instead of the usual flour paper. The chicken is very tasty and tender. Over all, a great value for the amount of food. The husband enjoyed his bun thit nuong and his portion was also huge. Dad said the fried rice was okay.\n\nService was good and quick. I don't ever expect stellar service at Vietnamese or Chinese restaurants, efficient is fine. C'mon people, when you're paying less than $10 for your entree, adjust your expectations. I want to give this place three and a half stars because the food was good but I'm rounding down because there was nothing here worth coming back for.

The wait staff knows us well and always asked how we were when we come in.\n\nI was here with my wife and sister in law yesterday.  My sister-in-law ordered a tofu salad; while she was eating it she reported that the tofu tasted rotten; this about half way through the cabbage part of the meal.  She asked to send it back.\n\nI did not taste the tofu.  I don't know what it was like but my sister-in-law has lived in Asia and knows tofu well enough to know what it should not taste like.  And if food is not right the proper thing for a restaurant to do is to take it back and apologize/replace it, that's what good service is about.\n\nSo we didn't want to pay for it. We were more than happy to pay for what my wife and I ate.  I figured that as loyal long term customers they could write off an $8 bowl of questionable tofu salad for us.\n\nHow wrong we were.  The waiter (a large, flamboyant Vietnamese  man) held a screaming drama queen fit, alleging that we were trying to not pay for food we had eaten. He was shouting in the restaurant; he went so far as to show the bowl of half eaten food to other customers in the restaurant who were understandably confused and I would think discomfitted by this vulgar display of histrionics.  Why other patrons had to be involved in what was a private dispute between us and the restaurant I don't know but it's a testatment to the instability of this wait-person's personality.\n\nCan you trust someone like that to handle your food?  Is berating long term customers over an $8 bowl of tofu salad appropriate?  The food is (usually) good but going to Def Con 4 over such a trivial matter makes me very concerned that there is something deeply and intrinsically wrong with this particular waiter who is ALWAYS working there.  Maybe he needs a day off.  \n\nRegardless, there is NO WAY we will ever go back to this dump.  I could forgive a bowl of bad tofu if they had handled it with grace but to throw a temper tantrum makes me think that there is more going on than meets the eye.

In fact they had several vegetarian (probably vegan, pardon my ignorance as I'm pretty new to this realm) offerings. \n\nIf you're a meat eater not to worry, they have meat-based dishes too.\n\nThe service was nice, our glasses were filled throughout our meal and the food came out quickly.\n\nMy dish wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped, the imperial rolls were bland, a tad greasy and lacked the light crunch that I would've preferred. The noodles a bit dry and the sauce too salty for me.\n\nGlancing at the other diners, their lunch specials and entrees looked appealing. I'm eager to return to try some other dishes ~", "author": "Cathy K."}

This waiter frequently came to our table within the first 10 minutes of us sitting down. I was catching up with an old friend, and each time he came, we politely told him we're not ready yet. About 10-15 minutes later, we were, and tried to get his attention. By the 3rd time, we realized he was intentionally ignoring us. He kept his head held high, nose in the air, and walked from one side of the room to the other, refusing to acknowledge us. The restaurant was busy, but you shouldn't have service like that anywhere you go.\n\nLong story short, we left and ended up eating at a Vietnamese restaurant across the street. They had damn good pho. \n\nMy feedback is to higher better waiters. I hear their food is very good, but it's not worth it if the service is plain horrible.", "author": "Ashley M."}

My craving was for vegan Vietnamese spring rolls which at that time I the only restaurant I knew of that had them was the slanted door.  I had vowed not to go back there as they were $15 each, but it was late and I wanted some quick take out so I called them.  Too bad, they don't do take out for their overpriced food!  A frantic yelp search brought me to sunflower!  \n\nI got two orders of the Vegetable spring rolls and was very happy to see the price was only 7.25.  Nice!   Then when I picked up my take out, the bag was super heavy, when I looked inside each order was actually two rolls!  Super nice!!!  \n\nThe quality was great, just as good as slanted door.  When you consider that these rolls we're about $3.60 each versus slanted door $15, it was a steal.  Ok ok, I know sd has an ambiance that sunflower is certainly lacking, but hey, the quality was there, and this review is for takeout only.  I'll have to go back and dine in and try some other menu options.\n\nEDIT:  I went back on 8.3.2012 and ate in the restaurant.  The restaurant is run down and old, and you'll leave smelling like deep fryer.  Not a place to take a date.  But the food is darn good, and so cheap!

We first asked the host to be seated somewhere else since there were empty places. He barely responsed and waved a \"no\" with his face. We then asked the server who had the same bad attitude and response. We eventually decided to enjoy our diner although we were really cold. The service itself wasn't that great. When it came to pay, we decided not to tips a lot because of the service we had. \n\nAs we got out of the restaurant, the serveur also came out and started to be mean because we didn't let any tips.

I usually recommend this place to other people, the food is always great. but this review is based on my experience yesterday. \n\nCame in yesterday for a quick bite w a friend. We already knew what we wanted, no need to see a menu. Walked in, ordered our food, sat down, they brought our food (which was great), then brought the check. That's it. We had an iota of interaction w our server, who mostly ignored us anyway. Totally not a big deal, cuz like I said \"quick bite\". \n\nWhile we were eating a couple came in, and sat next to each other, next to us. We were the only ones in the restaurant. All of a sudden the server comes over and starts yelling at them, that they were dirty and needed to find a hotel room. I have no idea what they were doing over there, but it couldn't have been much because they didn't disturb us at all and we didn't even notice them. But the server is yelling, the couple looked confused like WTF. The other servers started yelling at them from across the restaurant. The couple didn't bother us, but the servers definitely soured our meal. \n\nSo based on the zero interaction w the server, and then the whole hoopla w the couple, I decided I wasn't leaving a tip so we paid the bill and left. The server came running outside after us. To ask us why we didn't leave a tip and then to start yelling at us about not leaving a tip. In his words \"we have to leave a tip\" and that our meal wasn't free (pretty sure I just paid a bill so not sure what he was talking about there). and then he started yelling at us that if we weren't going to tip we \"should never come back and only order to go\".

Picture this: you and a friend are on 17th, decide you both want soup, and are too cold to get anywhere stellar. That's the scenario we were in last night -- the rare 34 degree night in SF (and your friend is obviously from the East Coast, but has been here too long to gain any fortitude points). You are equipped with 2 scarves (you NEVER wear scarves out of Tahoe... You are an SF native, but global warming and gentrification are sadly warping your fair city). What do you do?\n\nBam! You're at Sunflower near 16th. You go to the one on Valencia, because you know they have another entrance around the corner, but you've never trusted that one.\n\nYou are greeted by a sassy young man who only has a seat by the door. You take the seat, graciously, even though you notice there's no sriracha on it, and you are aware that the new wave of thoughtless people who have sadly joined your city are too self centered to consider closing the door when they leave. You order.\n\nThe Vietnamese Hot and Sour soup you get is a sour and sweet soup, at best. The rice you order doesn't come, but you are able to flag someone down eventually. The vegetarian imperial rolls (your east coast friend is a vegetarian after all) are surprisingly delicious and well made.\n\nThe bill comes, and you realize it's perfectly reasonable, and they even hand wrote the before tax cost on your split check, even though you were going to tip on the after tax number anyways.\n\nYou leave full, and not dissatisfied -- albeit never WOWed.

It feels like a suburban strip mall restaurant; it's murky and drab.  But the worst part is the service.  Firstly, it's kind of indifferent to mildly rude.  Secondly, the host will not accommodate requests (\"...but Michael from the other side lets us...\" \"No - not on the menu.\").

Some of my other favorites:\n\n- five-spiced BBQ chicken... the meat slides off the bone\n- Vietnamese lemongrass chicken... wasn't sure how to eat this but turns out you use the lettuce as a wrapper and stuff it with the given ingredients\n- eggplant curry... their curries are awesome\n- shrimp spring rolls... very fresh\n\nTheir portions are generous. When I ate here with a friend, ordering the garlic noodles (hmmm) and another dish was more than we could finish. Having a third person would be perfect. So when I came here recently with two German friends visiting, we ordered the shrimp spring rolls and two entrees and shared it family style. We ate and finished everything.\n\nWhen sitting down to eat, I prefer the cozy, dim atmosphere of Sunflower on Valencia St. But for to-go phone orders, the pick-up spot is the Sunflower on 16th St. As a tip for those driving (since parking is close to impossible on most nights), park in the white zone in front of Roxy's theater. There's sometimes a Roxy guy there telling you that you can't park there. Just mention you have a quick pick-up order at Sunflower and he's usually cool about it.\n\nI've never had any bad experiences with the wait staff, but I could sympathize with other yelpers who felt mistreated and insulted.", "author": "Regs W."}

I  have, so my ability to discern authenticity on the extent and how Vietnamese dishes should or are traditionally prepared has the advantage. Most others patronizing most Vietnamese restaurants, outside of military veterans stationed in So. Vietnam at the time or Vietnamese community, graduated from meatloaf and hotdogs or 1970's diet of bean sprouts and Mary Jane brownies  or took bicycle touring low budget hostel tours now pretend to be culturally sophisticated because they actually walked around Chinatown or went to some suburban hosted cultural food street fair.\n\nMost Vietnamese restaurants, to survive at a profit, simplify their menus and downsized otherwise uncommon complexity of ingredients to accommodate the fast food, all you can eat buffet nonVietnamese dining patrons.  Many foreign cultural menus in this town serve what is comparable to fast food list of dishes.  Sunflower Vietnamese Restaurant has survived this long because it compromises to appease the average American palate who have no personal experience interfacing with specific cultural communities.  Those of us with years of specific and varies inter-cultural interaction do know better.  Sunflower's menu is convenient to please an average palate.  No self-respecting authentic Vietnamese cook and proprietor would use canned pineapples in any savory dish and Sunflower does in both their locations including the one on Potrero Hill where I live and dined at that location.  \n\nThere may be only 3-5 in this entire city representing true Vietnamese dishes without compromising ingredients and cooking process. The best are in San Jose area. There used to be a very good one called Cali-Pho-nia on Clement St. but one of the owners told me that nonVietnamese patrons were used to the fast food shortcut tastes which contributed to abandoning the menu and go more mainstream gringo.", "author": "Lizabeth G."}

The food at this location was mediocre, take-out quality Vietnamese food. The fresh spring rolls with shrimp were pretty standard, but the peanut dipping sauce was overly sweet and and watered down that  I used hoison sauce instead. There was nothing special about the garlic noodles, except that it was a big serving and only came with vegetables if you requested it and paid extra.

Bf had wanted to come here our entire trip, as he had fond memories of the pho here two years ago. Fond enough that he came three times on that trip.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers (chicken rolls with vermicelli noodles and fried vegetable dumplings) and three phos (chicken +$1 for vegetable, beef, and seafood). The apps were my favorite part of the meal. I especially loved the sauce with the chicken. I pretty much ate the seafood pho myself as everyone else was a little sketched out by it. I enjoyed it, especially the pieces of calamari. However, without shiracha, it would have just tasted like fish.\n\nWell, bf left a little disappointed that we all thought the pho was bland, but it was still good enough. Our server was mediocre. He did practically throw our five bowls for the pho on one of my tablemates. They literally fell on her. He said and did nothing while we nervously laughed. Thank goodness they were small and empty. We also had two ladles dropped on the table after asking for more.\n\nThe Thai iced tea was delicious! I'd come back, but I'd also be open to other pho options in the area.", "author": "Meredith D."}

The food was good. Not great, but by no means a bad first impression. And the shaken beef was off the hook! I highly recommend it... to-go.\n\nThen one of my friends said his girlfriend would actually be able to join us in a minute if it's okay. The place wasn't crowded, and there were empty tables so I figured it'd be okay to take a chair and add it to our table or move to a bigger table. When we told the waiter that someone else would be joining us in a minute (we weren't sitting down for more than 8 or so), he shouted at us, \"your friend can't come.\" I've never been heard about rejecting someone at a low-key restaurant, so I asked, \"Why not? We can pull up a chair if it's okay.\" And he raised his voice and said that we could get out of the restaurant and come back in 1 minute with our friend, and reorder. And then she came to the table no less than 10 seconds later. This was why there were plenty of empty tables next to us. So I was utterly confused why he was in such a rush to kick us out and bring us back in. As we got up to get out and come back in, the wait just commanded \"Fine! Sit down.\"\n\nThey never came to our table the entire time except to put down the food (mind you, if there was no space, he put the next dish on the plate we were already eating from even if we were still clearly actively eating from it, not bothering to let us move anything to adjust for space).\n\nAt the end, I was not happy about the +1 situation, having him put plates down while we were still actively eating from our plate, and also having to go into the kitchen to order. When I'm stingy, I leave about 10% tip. On the bill, there was a total, and then in writing, he wrote tip under the bill and \"required\" us to tip him 20%. I think not sir. So at the end of the meal, we all contributed 10% tip. While we were waiting for my friend's to-go food, they came back for the bill and I told him that I would prefer we get all of our food first. So as my friend is double checking the to-go food, he yelled \"I've waited long enough, give me the check!\" And the whole restaurant fell silent. My boyfriend quietly asked, \"Sir, was that really necessary?\" He said yelled even louder only 6 inches from my boyfriend's face, \"Shut up!!\" catching people's attention from outside the windows of the restaurant. And he stormed off.\n\nLong story short, if you would still like to financially support people with this type of behavior (as I've read this definitely hasn't been the first time the waiter have quick temper and yelled), I highly recommend to-go orders.", "author": "Ailinh D."}

I should have known not to try to get anything as complicated as Pho.\n\nThe Mission doesn't have a lot of good Vietnamese food to chose from. And although passable, compared to what's on offer in San Jose, the food here is pretty unremarkable.", "author": "JayBee L."}

The Spring Rolls are made with a thick, crispy and chewy rice paper, and the filling stays fire hot for at least 10 minutes after being set on the table. I always grab the Pho, or a hearty noodle bowl for an entre. Best part, most of the menu is Gluten free! All of the portions are GIGANTIC. \n\nFor the most part the restaurant is fairly clean, but if you are looking for an immaculate space move along. The tables are always tidy, the place settings, plates and silverware is always sparkling, the bathroom is always clean, and the carpet is spotless - it's just that the whole place has a dingy look (but I love that kinda stuff).\n\nMost of all, I LOVE THE STAFF. They are sassy and won't take any BS from anyone. But if you are a regular, they will get to know you, they will chat with you, and you will get better, fresher food FAST. If you act like an jerk, they will treat you like a jerk, and will feed you at their leisure.\n\nSo - it's great food, mostly gluten free, and the staff are sassy.

I used to live in the Mission and go here when I wanted Vietnamese. The food is usually satisfactory, never amazing, but it was convenient. However, the whole thing today was pretty appalling. \n\nI understand if they're short staffed, but that is no reason for the waiter to be short and rude to us. \n\nWe walked in, no one greeted us, we sat down and two other tables were filled after us, yet both of them had their order taken before we did and one table even had their food BEFORE we even ordered. That was really irritating.\n\nFor the record, we were really hungry and had made our decisions and put our menus away within minutes of walking in the door. Yet the waiter had to be flagged down to take our order. He seemed to be really angry at us and avoiding our table for some inexplicable reason. \n\nThen my friend spilled his water (probably in a delirium of hunger, lol) and they saw it and... no one came to help us wipe the table up. The table was dripping in water which we wiped up ourselves with napkins. Said waiter then had to be asked to take the wet napkins away, and was snotty when asked for new napkins. Kind of incredible.\n\nI asked him a question and he cut me off and snapped at me! LOL!\n\nMy soup was also lukewarm.\n\nHe got a really crappy tip. I think we pointedly left $1 on a $35 bill. That is not something I normally would ever do. Crappy service will usually get a 10 - 15% tip. I just honestly felt he deserved nothing at all. He was just such a rude asshole. Probably won't be back ever. That was too much. I mean, I live in the fucking Sunset now, I can get better Vietnamese with good service any day, so why would I ever come here again?

The service was never that great but I enjoy the food here so I decided to bring some friends visiting from out of town. We had planned to meet another friend who was en route and to arrive about 15 minutes later. At the door we mentioned that we had a friend coming to meet us but that we would like to order before she arrives. The waiter said, \"ok,\" pointed to a table and walked away. Soon after he brought menus and water. We prepared to order and waited...and waited. At a certain point it was clear that the server was ignoring us so we kindly asked if we could order. This is when the wheels seem to come off the wagon. Our server immediately raised his voice and asked if our friend had arrived. We said not yet but that we would like to go ahead and order. This seemed to infuriate him, and replied, \"no, we do not hold tables.\" I thought there was a misunderstanding and tried to clarify that we intended to order and pay for our time there. He simply cut me off by shaking his head and repeating no. We then asked if we could order anyway, without our friend. This angered him even more, he completely lost the plot and went off on a tangent about how the restaurant does not hold tables. Everyone around us turned to see what was going on as he continued to berate us. We were stunned. The experience was so awkward and bizarre we didn't know what to do. I've never been yelled at by a waiter. At some point he stormed off and started taking orders from our neighbors. We were left speechless. I apologized to my friends; I felt awful as I was the one who recommended this place. Fortunately, there are plenty of restaurants in the area so we found another (much more inviting) option quite easily. \n\nIn retrospect, I still don't know what happened. I mean, I understand if a restaurant has a policy where they don't hold tables for guest but why seat us in the first place, just to ignore us? If the server would have mentioned the restaurant policy before we were seated and ready to order, we would have had the opportunity to make a decision without all the drama. Instead we were made to feel as though we were doing something so horrible by asking to pay to eat at a restaurant that serves food. It's a shame because I used to love this place.

I look to see if there is a line at the door; there is not, nobody is waiting in fact, so we continue to eat at what was a reasonable pace. Within a couple minutes more he is back at our table, looking to see if we had left a credit card- subtle hint. He repeats this several more times, then starts taking our not yet finished plates of food. When he asks if we are going to pay we respond 'not yet' and he starts telling the table next to us that we are not going to pay for dinner. He then starts wiping down the table while we are sitting there, one of us still legitimately finishing her meal. Although there continues to be nobody waiting for a table, he tells us that somebody is waiting for a table. When we ask who he points to a guy who just entered who appears to be waiting for take-out. When we point to the free (and set) table of two next to us, he tells us that the guy is waiting for a table of three. Uncertain as to the truth of his request, we decide to pay and leave. I suggested to my friends that we leave less than a regular tip, as our waiter had become a truly belligerent man, but they are more kind hearted  than me and said 'we shouldn't punish a man for a bad day' (if only we had a smart phone and could read fellow reviews in real time- this dude seems to only have 'bad days'). So we give him 20%. When he returns to the table he tells us that we are cheap and to get out in a voice loud enough for the adjacent table to hear. \n\nIn true Seinfeld episode fashion, the waiter then sits the guy supposedly waiting for a three person table at the table we just vacated. The guy looks a little confused but obliges. Within ~ 5 minutes his 1 person take-out package is available, at which point it is delivered to him, and he leaves. So our table becomes available again, along with the now 4-5 other tables that have been pushed out during this time period. \n\nDo they not realize that this is a neighborhood place, as the food is not good enough to be a destination restaurant, and that the loss of repeat customers will mean a loss of business in the future?", "author": "Anne D."}

I've never experienced anything like this in a restaurant in my entire life.  My aunt and I came here to for dinner as well as to catch up - haven't seen her in a year or so.  \n\nEverything was normal for a Vietnamese restaurant except for the fact that the place is run by Chinese people - a little unusual but no problem.  We ordered our food and enjoyed it - the food was fine.  The first problems came when they kept trying to grab my food and drink before I was done with it.  Then, I didn't have a chance to look at the bill and he kept trying to grab it, saying Thaaaaank yooooou, thaaaaaank yooooou - really annoying.  It was apparent that they were trying to usher us out as fast as possible.\n\nI decided to take my time finishing my drink.  They kept asking me if I wanted anything else, suggesting if I was done I should get out.  I said no and that I would appreciate if they would back off.  Pretty soon our server lost his patience with me and started yelling at me at the top of his lungs, making the entire restaurant go silent.  THIS ISN'T A FIVE STAR HOTEL!  YOU BEEN HERE FOR 2 HOUR!  (I wasn't there for even 45 minutes) Among other things - he was seriously yelling at me for what felt like 5 minutes.   \n\nImagine that - a restaurant full of people went completely silent while I was getting chewed out by my server.\n\nI told him that he's got some serious problems and that I wanted to talk to his manager.  He calls someone and hands me the phone after yelling into it for a few minutes and I talk to this man named \"Danny.\"  While I am trying to talk to the manager, Danny - they are trying to get me to stretch the phone cord into the dining room and talk to the manager in there.  I refused.  An old guy starts tapping me on the shoulder really hard and I turned around and told him to \"go ahead and touch me one more time.\"  I decided at that time it was time to leave.\n\nI managed to get \"Danny's\" phone number before I left and I spoke with him afterward when I was walking on the sidewalk.  He tried his best to be accommodating, saying that he was going to talk to the server that treated me like that and he offered to treat me at one of his other restaurants.  But I have the feeling from talking to him it's all just lip service.  I don't think it's all that bad in Chinese culture to treat a customer like that - maybe I'm wrong.\n\nI should have simply left early on when I recognized that he was trying to expedite me out of the restaurant before the problems started happening.  I am just left with the shock and embarrassment of that situation and the fact that my aunt, whom I haven't seen in a while had to go through that as well.  \n\nI guess their business does so well in that location that they can afford to treat people like that.", "author": "Nathan V."}

(Yes...we had dessert first but that's another story.) As we headed up 16th, we stumbled upon this restaurant that seemed to just blend in with its surroundings.\n\nWalking in, I thought to myself, \"Wow, this place is dark.\" Not dark as in the Dark Knight nor dark as in pure evil, but rather the low light feeling that one may find in a lounge. Not that it was a bad thing. People were all talking at a normal volume, chatting freely among themselves. \n\nAfter browsing, the menu, my eye's attention was caught by \"Garlic Noodles.\" After consulting with my friend's Yelp app which highlighted the dish as a popular review item, I was committed. After the first bite, I was quite pleased. I love garlic so obviously combining it with noodles was a no brainer. Yet, as I kept taking bite after bite, I found the dish to become a bit bland. After all, it was just noodles and chicken. No vegetables or anything. Not even something simple like bean sprouts. If I come back, I would recommend going with mixed vegetables for some variety.\n\nThe Imperial Rolls starter dish was okay. The deep fried wrap was a bit too chewy for me on the ends (too much wrap?). The innards were so so. Overall, not a standout dish for this place.\n\nDuring our meal, a couple at an adjacent table were bickering and one ended up throwing a napkin at the other. It missed and hit an innocent bystander. Long story short, the waiter (apparently infamous according to Yelp reviews) got upset and threw them out, calling them \"stupid\" among other things. While not very classy, he seemed pretty apologetic to the \"victims\" of the napkin throwing.\n\nUpon further observation, I really noticed how rude the waiter was. I'm accustomed to rude service, growing up in an Asian culture. Nevertheless, I can understand from an American standpoint how rude he was being. Personally, I do not like it either but I tend to just brush it off.\n\nOverall, the food is pretty good.

There seem to be quite a few posts already demonstrating the unfathomably rude behavior of their server, so I'm just going to give the bullet points of what we endured last night:\n\n-Completely rude and dismissive service from the moment we walked in.  Felt totally ignored and unwelcome from the start.\n\n-My boyfriend threw up his garlic noodles within ten minutes of eating.  I'll admit he wasn't feeling well to begin with, but that's still not a great sign.\n\n-When my friend asked to split the check in two, the waiter refused without any indication of apology, blaming us, and yelling at us to do it his way.  \n\n-My friend ending up paying for the whole bill on her card.  We were trying to work out how much cash we were going to pay her and what to leave for tip, when the waiter comes back to yell at us about there not being enough tip out on the table.  We had only had a minute with the receipt and were by no means ready to return the leather folder with the cash tip we were planning to leave,  when he rudely interrupted demanding a better tip.  We were fully planning on tipping him, despite his previous rude behavior, but once that happened I decided to leave the crappy tip as is instead of adding more to the pile.  Why would I reward such behavior with gratuity?  Had he not come to interrupt what we were doing to demand more money, he would have received a decent (and probably undeserved tip), but coming over before we were even settled to make a scene is just bizarre. \n\n-At this point we stood up to leave, hoping to leave this strange dining experience behind us, when the waiter begins screaming at us, causing the whole restaurant to take notice, and trying to make it sound as if we didn't pay our bill.  In reality, our bill had been paid, and he was simply infuriated at receiving a tip commensurate to his horrible service.   As we got up, he pulled out his cellphone and put it right up in my friend's face, telling her he's going to take her picture!  She had to push herself past him to even get out of the restaurant.  I'm just glad he didn't try to do that to me, because I would have knocked it right out of his hand.  Who in their right mind would do such a thing and cause such a scene in their place of business?  This waiter was at the verge of violence over a crappy tip---which would have been a standard tip, had he not rudely interrupted us while we were working out our payment.\n\n-At this point, I regret leaving any tip behind.  This person clearly doesn't understand what it means to treat customers with respect or to give good service.  Gratuity is based on service, and is not mandatory.  His actions were inexcusable.  I work in the service industry and was fully planning on tipping him until he began to make a scene.  There have been plenty of times where I've given excellent customer service and not been rewarded with even a standard tip, but I would never accost and publicly humiliate guests, thrusting my phone in their faces, and threaten to photograph them.

Taking a bite from another piece, I had to spit it out. It was rotten, and made me want to vomit the same way a rotten piece of cheese would. I felt sick and realized I should say something.\n\nWe called the waiter over and said the tofu was rotten. They said that no one else has complained and I just insisted they take the food away. To their credit, they asked if we wanted to exchange but I was too sick to want anything else. They charged us for the salad and we weren't comfortable paying for rotten food. I had eaten about half of the cabbage in the bowl when we sent it back. My sister went back and calmly asked about the charge, hoping that they might consider not charging us for food that was clearly rotten. Instead of calmly saying that they can't cancel or whatever their reason was, the waiter (whom my sister adored for being a very flamboyant character) started yelling at her. I listened for about thirty seconds to him yelling. She came back and said that they are charging us and I handed her the money for the salad, sad that they would do that. I wish it stopped there.\n\nThe same waiter then walked around the restaurant pointing us out to customers saying that we ate it all and then didn't want to pay. Then they brought out the bowl to show us that I had eaten the whole thing. They had clearly taken out the rest of the vegetables to make it look like I had eaten more, continued to rant that we had eaten the whole thing and didn't want to pay. The other customers looked confused. We calmly talked to another waiter explaining that we would never scam them and could not believe that they were treating loyal customers that way. As we calmly talked to one waiter, the other carried on to the other customer. The one we were talking to tried to calm him. The calm one also continued to say that no one else complained, we just said how sorry we were that they would dare treat customers, and loyal customers, this way, trying to humiliate us in front of the restaurant for mentioning that there was rotten tofu. We paid for the salad anyways (to make a point, but that was probably pointless), so disgusted and sad that we will never go back and do not want anyone else to patronize the place.", "author": "Jamie R."}

I had the vermicelli with beef and asked to add shrimp to that dish... waiter said..\"why not?\" YES! he gets cool points for that...  lol he was very flexible and very nice. I was fairly happy with our service, and I believe we came at a time when the dinner rush starts because when we finally sat down there was no longer a wait to sit. And don't order the appetizer platter thing if you're going to get a vermicelli meal thing because it's the exact same thing only one is on a plate and the other one is in a bowl... \n\nTo be honest, I think I am just way too used to San Jose Vietnamese pho restaurants because this place had 4 options for pho...chicken, beef, vegetarian or seafood... and they didn't have any 3 bean/ jelly drink or any hard core Vietnamese drinks..it was like intro to Vietnamese food.....if I'm in the area I'll stop by again.", "author": "Clara H."}

I went to see the waiter saying he could not decide for us which tip to add... He answered it was for big parties and I answered it was for parties of 6 or more not 4. He became agressive and crossed out the written tip amount... I'm pretty sure he did that thinking we were tourists and wouldn't dare say a thing... Bad luck for him, I've been here for a while and hate when waiters try to abuse me because i'm not a native english speaker.\n\nWe gave the baddest tip I've ever given, about 5%...

I did not care EXCEPT my friend  wanted  to give me cash and have me put it on my card.  My friend would have chastised me for leaving a lower tip than he thought I should and would put more money on my tip pile-which always creates problems between us.  When we get one check my friend would add up his part to the penny and then tell me my part...to the penny which I think detracts from the dinning experience....you get the picture... separate checks are best for some.\n\nI did not care about one check until the waiter said he could not separate the check \"because the 92 year old owner would be confused\".  WTF? I told him my friend had cash and I had a cc and the problem was his to fix.  The waiter looked at me like it was not an option.  ...He even said we had to pay both with cash or both with cc.-that cash and cc was not an option.  My friend decides at that moment to pull out his cc that he made me believe he did not have.  I waited for the waiter and friend find a solution  when I should have been out the door.\n\nThe waiter worked in China town on his last job.  ( he is actually Chinese not Vietnamese).  I do believe he is part of the problem.  He acts nice but  seems to make his own rules.", "author": "John D."}

The Garlic Noodles:  Many yelpers say they could \"live off these noodles\".  It makes me wonder if you can cook.  They were a step up above ramen: Kinda bland, nothing special.  I feel like my garlic noodles that take me 3 minutes to make taste better.  It took them less than a dollar to make it and then charged me about $10.  Naw.  Fool me once...\n\n2.  The Shaken Beef:  Strangely tender and chewy...reminded me of cube-steak.  The sauce it was prepared in was amazing though!  So, that left me torn and a little nauseous.  Chewy beef cubes. $10.  [There was an entire salad under the beef, it made for a complete side salad so that added to the value]\n\n3.  The Imperial  Rolls:  Probably the best i've ever had even without the sauce.  The dipping sauce was tart and tasty.  I recommend.  About $10. [came with even more lettuce and plain rice noodles]\n\nCost was $30.  I have leftovers so that makes it about $15 per meal.  I'd say this place's \"$\" reputation should be more like \"$$\".  Not what i'd call dirt cheap.

I like to call ahead so that by the time I walk over, my food is ready to go.\n\nThis place is tiny and much less done up than the Potrero Hill Sunflower. It's a tiny hole in the wall and since I've never sat down to eat here, I don't know if it really just seats about 10 people or if there's an extension further into the restaurant, beyond the narrow kitchen. There's another door to Sunflower on Valencia but I've never entered through there. Sorry for not being more helpful, Yelpers.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy getting the garlic noodles here as well as the crab fried rice. One thing I like about Sunflower is the portion sizes! It's always enough for about three meals! \n\nAnother plus is the waitstaff. They are quite friendly. Once, I came by to pick up an order and (silly me) did not check my box. I walked all the way back to work (about a 10 minute walk), opened the box and found brown rice and eggplant. NOT what I had in mind. So I had to walk all the way back and they apologized profusely and offered me a free drink (which is actually what I was envisioning/hoping would happen on my walk over because it was a hot day!). \n\nThere are always people eating lunch here which I take to be a good sign.

We will never go back if he is there. \n\nWe went there the other night, needing a satisfying meal, quickly, as we had theater tickets, and it is easy to get downtown from the restaurant. It was very cold out, and at an off time, so the restaurant was pretty empty. However, the waiter sat us down next to another person, who was eating alone. He asked the waiter, very politely, if he could move, so we could have our privacy. The waiter pushes his table out about an inch. He asks again, still politely, and the crazy waiter, literally grabs his food away from him, and tells him to get the hell out. We could not believe it. The customer is still being very polite, and the waiter is screaming at him. The customer finally leaves. We felt awful, but didn't have much time, and it was too cold to go elsewhere, so we ordered but really could not enjoy the meal. We needed another plate, but were afraid to ask, for fear of also being thrown out. To make matters worse, the waiter is now bragging to other customers how he threw this guy out. \n\nYelp is full of reviews from customers complaining about this angry, crazy waiter. There are other waiters there, but this one seems to run the show. I don't know if he is one of the owners. We have gone there before, and one time he kept on ignoring us when we wanted to order another dish.

Crispy rice noodle crepes with tofu and veggies inside, always served super hot, wrapped up in cold lettuce leaves with a little cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrots and a sweet/spicy dressing.  Their fresh springs rolls are nice, too, though not mind blowing. If you're into veggies and such, I'd highly recommend the green bean and shiitake dish. It's nicely spiced and always well cooked and just a nice little situation.\n\nThe last few sunny days I've spent in Dolores Park were followed by  trips to Sunflower.

As a matter of fact I really liked it and everything we ate there. \n\nMy friend ordered the steak salad, which was phenomenal. Other friends ordered egg rolls, which I was happy to hear were made with rice, not wheat, flour and this chicken dish that I wish I could remember better because it was so super tasty. I had the green beans and something else as well. It was 2 months ago and my memory is hazy but I did want to update my review because yes it's good and yes I'd go back and yes I will now try the Sunflower in Portrero Hill as well. I'm happy to report back on this because I am a big fan of Vietnamese food.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

Their noodle soup is delicious, especially the broth, and of course all of the delicious toppings they include w/ it. Their Imperial Rolls are especially tasty! This is because of the large portion, the perfectly fried roll itself, the yummy dipping sauce, and the pickled carrots, noodles, and lettuce on the side. They are some of the best Imperial Rolls I've tried in SF thus far. I've also had their Pan Fried Noodles w/ Chicken, which was huge, but lacked a tad on flavor. It really helped to add Sriracha and soy sauce, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Their Garlic Noodles w/ Mixed Vegetables was really really good. The Noodles were definitely the best part, but it was also awesome that there was so much of it on the plate! I've also had their Shrimp Fried Rice and Crab and Sweet Corn Soup, which were both good too. All of their dishes are definitely kind of greasy, but as long as you don't shove your face with noodles, you'll probably be fine. (It can cause a bit of a stomach ache after) I can definitely admit that it's hard not to...especially those garlic ones....mmmmmhm. \n\nNote: Probably better not to sit right by the door with your back to the window. The last time I was there a homeless woman came in and leaned over our table in my face, letting her smelly sweater rest in my fried rice and soup. GROSS! You never know what kind of situation you'll come across in the Mission, so it's better to be safe than sorry! Or take out is always a great option as well!", "author": "Sonya D."}

It's also a restaurant that has dishes I CRAVE on a regular basis and if I didn't live nearby I'd still probably have to come for these dishes: \n\nSunflower Prawns with Garlic Noodles: Their regular garlic noodles are fantastic but this dish is flavor country! Don't order the garlic noodles \"with prawns\" because that's just going to be some shrimp thrown into the regular garlic noodles--good but not mind blowing. \"Sunflower Prawns with Garlic Noodles\" are four giant jumbo prawns (with shells on) covered in some magic sauce (that makes me go insane) nesting on a big bed of garlic noodles. I think maybe I could eat anything covered with this sauce. I wish I could ask to take the prawn shells home because I swear I'd just suck the empty shells all night long to get every bit of that sauce off. (I probably could ask, but I'm too embarrassed.)\n\nI also get the Crepe which looks like a big crispy omlette filled with mostly mung beans and some bits of meat. You cut off a chunk of crepe and wrap it in some lettuce along with the fish sauce and mint leave and other stuff they bring with it. It's a little messy but I love it. \n\nThings like the shaken beef are good and I have a sorority girl type of friend who likes the lemongrass chicken because it comes with green beans and they use all white meat chicken. \n\nI always seem to get one of two waiters. The thin and exhausted looking man (I feel for him having to deal with privelaged hipsters all day long) or the bigger dude with the effeminate accent. Love them both. The bigger dude also loves the sunflower prawns with garlic noodles and never fails to tell me that's his favorite too. \n\nThis is a great place to come with a big group so you can try lots of dishes and it's affordable (but NOT on a Friday or Saturday night--you'll wait forever.)", "author": "meehee o."}

A minute later, the waiter asks us if we want to order. I know what I want, and my cousin who was with me appeared to be. We looked at each other and paused for like 2 seconds, and the waiter said \"If you're not ready just say so and I'll come back.\" A bit rude, but they were busy so all is good. \"Yeah, we'll need another minute or two.\"\n\nMy cousin decided what he wanted, and I waved to the waiter as he passed by. Ignored. A couple of minutes later, he walks by again, and I hold the closed menu up suggesting we're ready. Ignored again. Some new patrons two tables over came in and the waiter ignored me a third time to take their order before ours. Was this passive aggressive behavior a result of us not ordering right away? In his defense, he was the only waiter taking orders, with one other person serving and clearing. Definitely need another front of house person.\n\nAfter a good 10 minutes, Mr PAWD (passive-aggressive-waiter-dude) takes our order. We get the chicken salad to share, my cousin orders the beef pho, and I order the lemon grass pork and imperial rolls on vermicelli.\n\nThe salad was okay. We were both feeling like eating some raw greenery and that hit the spot.\n\nMy cousin's pho was warm. Warmer than lukewarm, but  not after he added his bean sprouts, basil, and peppers. Lukewarm pho... yuck. Nowhere near as hot as it should have been. And it was bland. And in my opinion, pho should have tripe, tendon, rare steak, and brisket.  I shouldn't complain about this, because it's not listed on the menu, but that should have been the sign to stay away.\n\nThe lemon grass pork and imperial rolls on vermicelli was so-so. The imperial rolls were okay. The same as I'd expect from a run-of-the-mill Vietnamese restaurant in the 'loin or the avenues. The lemon grass pork, however, was way too lean and tough. And the fact that they overcooked the crap out of it didn't help.\n\nI don't understand why this place gets so crowded. Oh wait, I know... Perhaps because reasonably-priced Asian food is lacking in the Mission. Looks like there's some good opportunities a waitin'... Maybe I'll moonlight with a pho cart.", "author": "J K."}

The bad: a parsimonious serving of rice noodles and four slim slices of medium and well-done beef clumped together. Nevertheless, the broth had a hearty beefy flavor that helped to satisfy my craving. Bottom line: decent pho is sometimes better than no pho. \n\nNext, the garlic noodles. They served a generous helping of somewhat soggy, but garlicky noodles (refined wheat flour?) with five or six medium sized prawns. The noodles were tasty but too greasy for me. \n\nLastly, the sauteed vegetables. The large plate arrived with a good variety of vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and onions - soaking in all-purpose brown sauce and \"garnished\" with several pieces of tofu.

The decor is what you would expect from a cheap Vietnamese place, which isto say not outwardly dirty (although the lighting is super dim...hiding something, or saving on electricity bills, Sunflower?), but nothing that you would call your decorator about to demand replication.  We arrived at 6ish on a Thursday night, and the place was almost completely full, and service was quick and efficient--din took an hour, max--which was excellent b/c we were starving, but our waiter was completely MIA after we placed our orders.  Water was refilled ever so often; however, he would scurry away before I could articulate my desire for tea.  Perhaps he could detect that I'm a little HM...\n\nRegardless, for mains we had the garlic vegetables and the vegetarian hot and sour soup.  Both were decent--the veggies were nice and crisp in the garlic dish, but the sauce was a bit heavy on the thickener and without the piquancy I would have expected from a garlic dish.  My soup was interesting/weird/probably wouldn't order it again but the more I ate it the more I kind of enjoyed it.  My spoon smelled aggressively of plastic, which I thought was the initial reason for my reaction to it, but upon pondering for a moment, it became clear that the flavor of canned pineapple (which was part of the soup) dominated all the other flavors.  Yes, I did read that this was an ingredient, but no, I did not expect my soup to be quite the tropical adventure that it was.  On the plus side it was a light choice.  They have a decent selection of vegetarian options (although all of the veggie dishes list a \"secret house sauce\" which I'm fairly sure must be fish sauce b/c no Asian restaurant worth its salt in authenticity can cook w/o it)--but I didn't want to ask, I just wanted to eat.\n\nAre there better Vietnamese places out there?  Yes.  But dinner for 2 was cheap--$32 w/o tip--and the portions were generous.

I was a bit twitchy,  wondering things like what my jacket choice said about me (khaki?  too mililtant?).  Well, I thought, at least I'd get some good Mediterranean food even if my date, I mean meeting, sucks.  \n\nWhen I arrived outside Truly Med, the friendly enough-seeming dude & dudette gestured instead towards a grungy looking hole in the wall, saying \"We thought we'd do Vietnamese instead.\"  Sure, guys.  No problem.  I've just been having sordid baba ghanoush fantasies all day, but yeah, bring on the fish sauce.  Not.  Happy.  Did I mention I'd never had Vietnamese food, and did not want to stress about poor menu choice on this awkward first non-date date?\n\nSigh.  We walk in to the tiny space and claim a table in the corner. awkward first date-like menu perusal ensues; \"What did you major in?\"  \"Hm?  American Studies?  What's larb?\"  \"Larb?\"  \"Yeah, it was a multidisciplanary major.  I have no direction in life.  Larb, yeah.  What is it?\"\n\nAnd so it went, chit-chat stumbling on until my chicken salad arrived first in a vessel the size of a toilet bowl.  It looked suspiciously like an Asian rendition of a Taco Bell chicken salad, with ground meat, weird chips soaring out of the sides of the bowl, and no greens visible.  I peered over its height until my companions' dishes arrived, and the pho one of them had ordered had what looked suspiciously like a cocktail frank atop.  I eyed my chicken salad warily; this could be a huge zero.\n\nFirst bite:  DELICIOUS!  (Oh, like you didn't know how this story would end).  I lavishly poured on sriracha, my new favorite condiment, and muched away at the zesty fresh melding of flavors (was that cilantro?  thai basil?) and knowing how much cheaper my meal would be than the mini-weener pho across the table.  Munch, munch, munch. Lots of greens at the bottom of the bowl.   \"Sure, I believe in a home, not a house.\"  Munch, munch.  Would it be too awkward to ask to have the rest wrapped, I wondered halfway in and filled to capacity?  Would that illustrate my stinginess, my near destitute status?  Would I look like the type not to lend an egg? \"Sure, I'm flexible about sharing groceries.\"\n\nNo worries.  The quiet yet attentive waiter brought over a to go carton and bag without nary an eye catch.  Four stars, sold to the girl in the khaki jacket!

Now, I am not going vegetarian, but have decided to lighten up my meals a bit, and cut down on meat.  And I think I might have to make it one more day, as of this writing, it's Friday, and Lent, so we are not supposed to have meat on Friday, right?  Just one more day ... that's what I keep telling myself.  Steak tomorrow!\n\nThis is a place that you might think twice about stopping by.  16th and Valencia, is not, shall we say, a corner that you would think of when it comes to Vietnamese food.  You'd be thinking burritos, tacos, and pizza, right?  Well think twice, and head into the pastel colored neon signs of Sunflower.  Just do it.\n\nI've been wanting Garlic Noodles since I started a thread a few days ago.  This place was suggested, so I got off BART a few stops early to get some.  There are many choices for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.  I ordered the Garlic Noodles, Imperial Rolls, (meat and vegetarian), and the Chicken Salad.  I got everything to go, and went on my way\n\nThe Garlic Noodles make me want to go back just for that.  They come with egg, and some \"special ingredient\", according to the menu.  I don't know what that \"special ingredient\" is, but it must be crack, as it's that addicting.  I could have eaten a whole order on my own.  The vegetarian Imperial rolls are some of the best I've had.  I could not even tell they were meatless.  (but I did dip in the fish sauce based dip .... did I cheat on the \"no meat?\")  At least I didn't have pork or chicken!  \n\nI did try the salad, making sure to not get any chicken.  It was good, and comes with dressing, and the same fish sauce based dip the spring rolls come with.  I was looking for more peanuts in my salad.\n\nI will go back for the Garlic Noodles, and the grill entrees again.

I've read that some people think it looks really run-down & sketchy -- I disagree.  I think it's about par for the course in terms of little locally-run mission eateries.  I mean, not fancy or anything; it's florescent lighting, plastic discount diner furniture and a radio playing out of the box it came in (seriously), but it certainly didn't look as if they were breaking any health codes.\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the spring rolls, which were ENORMOUS (ie, you could make a meal out of them if you weren't absolutely starving) and pretty tasty, though they were a bit heavy on the noodles and light on the shrimp.  For my entree, I had the combination noodles, which had chicken, shrimp, celery, cabage, bok choi, carrots, broccoli, squash, bean sprouts, and a TON of onions.  It was very tasty!  Admittedly not the bed I've ever had, but not bad at all for $7.  And there was a royal fuck ton of it.  I think I took home half the dish as leftovers.  My boyfriend had the beef pho, which was, much like my dish, quite tasty, though not the best we'd ever had.  \n\nReasonably tasty?  Check.  Reasonably priced?  Check.  Enormous portions, making it that much more of a good value?  Check.  But 'Authentic' is, perhaps, going a bit far.

My boyfriend and I liked the fact that it was far enough away from work but close enough for us to make it back to the office for our meetings.\n\nTheir vermicelli bowls (bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, chopped mint and peanuts on the bottom, a layer of dry (not in soup), plain cooked vermicelli and then your choice of meat/non-meat) is my standard fare here, with my preference is the grilled prawn/impreial roll combo. I like that they don't go crazy with the cilantro unlike most Asian restaurants, causing me to want to make a \"Calvin & Hobbes\" face (you know the one I'm talking about, the *ACK* face). I can't detect any real noticeable lemongrass, but the prawns are topped with some cooked green onions which makes for a nice flavor break. \n\nI used to get their lunch special, before I began noticing how sleepy I got when I was back at work. This comes on a gigantic platter and has a fried imperial roll, a decent sized red leaf lettuce salad, rice and your choice of meat or veggie entree-and a small bowl of soup. At the nice price of $7.95 you will be sure to get your money's worth. I think I switched to the prawns because I found the beef retained a bit too much cooking oil for my tastes.\n\n If we're feeling a need to throw in some veggies that day, the veggie spring rolls are a nice addition since my boyfriend almost always gets the pho bo, occasionally broken in routine by the pho ga and I always get on his case about the lack of veggies in his diet.

One downfall was the fresh spring rolls had too many rice noodles and were lacking in flavor. Also tried spicy lemongrass chicken/green beans which was tasty.", "author": "Kristen R."}

I was expecting a family run Vietnamese cafeteria, but instead I considered them more of a gourmet Vietnamese for the foodies.\n\nEverybody was raving about the Garlic noodle, which I tasted from a leftovers 2 weeks prior.  And of course we ordered this garlic noodle ( 3 orders) and some other dish.\n\nAt this point other dish we ordered that day - did not register in my brain. The only things that's imprinted in my mind was - guess - was the GARLIC NOODLE.\n\nIts served in a big plate - good for 4-5 people. It has big thick noodles with reddish brown sauce that a bit sweet and a tinge of garlic - perfect for my taste buds.

If you want to spread out, enter on Valencia. The decor is nothing special but that's definitely not why you'd eat here, the food is the draw!\n\nThe food: This was my first time eating Vietnamese and it was delicious. We ordered the Vermacelli, Lemon Grass Chicken, and Garlic Noodles. The flavors were interesting, the chicken was good, and the vegetables were fresh. Every dish that I saw being served looked awesome. I look forward to try new dishes (through take-out, I don't see myself returning to eat at the restaurant because of the service).\n\nService: I wish I could give a fully positive review of this restaurant but the service was really disappointing. When I arrived at 5:30pm on a Tuesday the restaurant had numerous empty spots and the server asked me to wait for my party (I was waiting for two friends). I understand the policy but  when the restaurant is almost empty, it feels a little rude. The same server pressed to take our order. As we verbalized that we weren't ready, he was turning away before we could get the words out. Clearly his priority was pushing people in and out. The table next to us was a two-top and the customers had apparently been there for two hours. Let's not forget, the restaurant was barely full and it was 5:30pm on a Tuesday. The server was SO rude to the customers and kicked them out. These were two quiet ladies sipping Diet Cokes after their meal. I have never seen anything like that at all. As they left quietly he continued to berate them, pointing out the video camera and yelling as they left. I swear, these were two quiet ladies in their 40s just hanging out after their meal. They didn't argue with the server, even as he was yelling behind them. I've never seen anything like that before. For this reason I will consider take-out here well before I consider returning to table service.", "author": "Eliz M."}

I didn't remember much, except it was totally forgettable -- bland and unexciting.\n\nOf course time heals all wounds (and sins), and on a totally desperate night to get some beef pho in my Mission neighborhood, I decided to give Sunflower another go, especially since I couldn't remember what I didn't like about their soup anyways. Well... NOW I remember.\n\nLet me preface this to admitting that I am totally spoiled by great pho joints back home, my ex-boyfriend's Vietnamese mother (a great cook), and those years of pho in the Avenues and now the Tenderloin aka Little Saigon. \n\nI was disappointed by a number of things:\n1. You can only order one cut of meat -- namely \"tender beef.\" No tendon, no tripe, no brisket, no beef ball. Just small strips of beef, not larger, paper thin slices, barely swimming in the bowl.\n2. Soggy noodles. Perhaps I got a rogue bowl, but damn those noodles were too, too soft for my liking.\n3. The soup did not arrive piping hot. If you serve soup, please serve it hot! This may explain my soggy noodles, which I imagined were waiting around for service, while slowly sponging up the broth.\n4. The broth again. It was meh. A whatever broth. Just -getting-by type of broth. I couldn't pick up much essence of seasonings, or soul of beef or pork or whatever. I'm convinced part of the lost taste was due to the broth temperature. And here I circle back again to meh broth and soggy noodles.\n\nSo thumbs down on the pho for me. Mind you this is based on the beef pho, and I can't say I'll be back to try the chicken, but... I did have something very tasty here which I would come back for: a crispy fried rice ball filled with pork and glass noodle. It was absolutely delicious!

While trucking around the city on foot we must have passed a thousand restaurants from each corner of the world. We ended up passing Sunflower by a couple blocks and ran all the way back. \n\nThere was one open table that JUST got cleared, and we swooped on it. The place was packed so we knew it had to be a great place to get some food. Excited, we got our menus and made out choices and were then greeted by the coolest waiter ever. \n\nFriends and I ordered: Vermicelli with Imperial Rolls, Lemon Grass Beef with rice, and Sunflower Prawns with Garlic Noodles. The Imperial rolls were delicious with a great garlic flavor. The beef was wonderfully marinated and tender, but the Sunflower prawns were freakin amazing! A special spicy chili sauce is spilled over the shelled jumbo prawns that lay atop garlic noodles. The most amazing flavors came out of that special sauce.. OMG! \n\nAnyway.. in conclusion. The place had fabulous food, excellent staff, huge portions, and for extremely reasonable prices.

We (just my husband and I here) ordered an appetizer (fried spring rolls), a soup (something vegetarian with cellophane noodles) and two entrees, and the waiter had to relocate us to a table for 4 to accommodate all of the food--that's how large the plates are, and the servings fill the plates! The fried rolls were wonderful: packed with vegan goodness, and easily twice  the expected size (they looked like small burritos). The soup was good, but my husband felt that they'd skimped on noodles proportionate to the veggies and broth.

As we left Michael handed me a bag of my favorite rolls as a good night gift.

Hoping for a warm welcome and a hot bowl of soup. \n\n Instead we were left standing at the door for a good five minutes wondering if anyone was ever going to even acknowledge us as having entered the establishment.  When we were finally acknowledged and seated, we were promptly asked what we wanted by our perpetually in a hurry to be somewhere else host,and then half way paid attention to when the order was given. I remember thinking \"was he even listening?\" as he hurriedly ran to the other end of the restaurant.  \nThe food came out separately, my friends arriving first. She had ordered a \"noodle soup\" but apparently this one came without noodles. She asked nicely if she could have noodles added to her order, and this is where things got really interesting. \nOur host/server became extremely agitated with our table. Including stomping away, and  pointing at our table while yell talking at the cook.  I know its annoying to have to take an order back in to the kitchen, but come on..... you run a restaurant this cant be the first time this has happened? Your supposed to be prepared for this kind of thing. That's what you do.\nMy soup was still not out, and we sat waiting....and waiting ...and waiting for our soups. My friends soup arrived once again before mine. \n\n Finally we both had food placed before us and were ready to eat. The soup was an entirely new experience. Large chunks of vegetables to big to eat comfortably. Thrown in a bowl with some noodles and a crap veggie broth.  If this is safe Vietnamese Ill take my chances elsewhere. \nWhen we weren't picking out the huge chunks of broccoli and whole hearts of cabbage from our soups, we were wondering where the condiments were. No chili paste, no pepper, nothing.  To boot when we tried to flag down Mr. speed racer our server he ignored us completely and flew right on by. \n\n As the meal came to an end, we needed to pay. As you can imagine this took quite some time considering our server was ignoring us. \n\n My friend got food poisoning and that pretty much sums up what I think of this place. \n Wont go back. .... cant believe people actually hoard in here for food when there are so many other great restaurants in the city.", "author": "Charlie B."}

The brown rice is amazing and for some seafood try the seafood sizzling dish (my memory is very fresh since I just left the restaurant! ;)\n\nI just didn't give Sun Flower a 5 star in this review cause I really think they are understaffed.

Blah food, and horrendous service. \nThis is how it happened: \n- We arrived early for dinner and told the waiter that we had a party of 4 but only 2 of us were there now and we're willing to wait. He told us to sit straightaway. \n- 10 mins later, realizing that our 2 friends were not there yet (did he listen when we told him?) the waiter told us to leave our table. Which of course was silly so we just went ahead and order. \n- 15 mins later: friend no. 1 arrived. Our food came out, but our drinks did not. Friend no. 1 waved and asked and was short of dancing Zumba for attention. She didn't get a menu for another 15 minutes. \n- Another 15 mins: friend no. 2 arrived while friend no. 1 was struggling to eat pho without a spoon or the herbs that were supposed to come with it. We still could not get hold of a waiter so friend no. 2 gave up trying to order. \n- While we were still working on our food, some waiter left the check on our table, effectively rushing us out of a meal. \n\nWe paid and decided to not tip, because they were terrible to us throughout. The waiters (suddenly there were 3 of them, all VERY attentive it seemed), confronted us about why we did not tip. We explained our disappointment in the service. They started screaming at us so we left. The last of our group was in the rest room, as she came out, she was seized by the same 3 men, screaming at her. \n\nWe're not cheap. We understand that waiters don't get paid well and depend on tips. But that doesn't mean they are entitled to it. Tips, like goodwill, are earned.\n\nThe whole encounter left a bad taste in my mouth.

I have a meditation hour which includes the vegetarian pho. There vegetarian pho is much better than other vegetarian pho soups, they put in lots of different veggies and tofu. All the waiters are adorable especially the formal older gentleman who has real old fashion waiter manners. I also really enjoy the younger waiter who tends to be there at night. l actually love eating here by myself on a quiet sunday afternoon when it isn't busy inside.

This was the only vietnamese restaurant w/in walking distance from where I needed to be, so I had my lunch here.\n\nJust 2 types of pho. Sad face. Beef, and....something else. I just remember beef because that's whta I ordrered. \n\nThe pho is average. Nothing spectacular, with all the requisite fixins.\n\nI did come back for the pork and garlic stirfry with brown rice. This isn't your run of the mill tan colored brown rice, but some hardcore purplish wild rice variety. The portion was a bit small for my taste but it was pretty yummy. \n\nThe lunch specials look like one hell of a deal, with  a salad, a springrool, rice, and meat.

That said, I was so drunk at the time that I think I would have enjoyed it if they had served me oatmeal with ketchup.  So, I decided to give the place another go-around, and I must say I was impressed.\n\nLemon grass chicken was quite good.  Chicken spring rolls are the size of a burrito, so that's a pretty good deal too.  The shaken beef is also quite good, although it is beef and nothing else.  Even the most basic burger comes with a bun, some fries, and a pickle.  Couldn't they mix it up a bit?\n\nThe help was very, well..helpful!  Of course, when I got the bill, I understood why.  They charge you for each bowl of rice.  That's like an extra $1.20 right there that I hadn't budgeted for.  Okay, Mr. Sunflower, I'm onto you.  Of course, I see this as a business opportunity.  I'm going to open my own stand and sell bowls of rice for $1 to all people going into Sunflower.

The garlic noodles were good, but they were... just noodles cooked with garlic. I was expecting a bit more, maybe, given the tremendous reviews on Yelp. Nothing out of this world. The vermicelli was a more varied collection of food. \n\nMore notably, though, they were both huge portions for the price (both around $8.)

Beef also a tad dry.  This place also lacks condiments, which is typical of most pho places. People are friendly enough, and this place seems to pack in the locals.

The place is deceptive--from the outside it looks like just a nondescript hole in the wall, but on the inside it's actually quite cozy, quiet, and pleasant. The place is busy, but not so much that it feels crowded or noisy. The multi-page menu has tons of options, both vegetarian and not and includes lots of noodle dishes, soups, salads, stir-frys and appetizers. It was hard to decide what to order--the spring rolls sounded really good, as did the shrimp salad and the spicy green beans with portabello mushrooms. I was in a noodle mood so I ended up getting the vegetarian noodle soup which was a ginormous bowl heaping with a variety of tasty veggies, tofu, and thin rice noodles. My friend got the curry vegetable and had nothing but good things to say about it. A nice touch is they also offer brown rice--in fact, we had a laugh over my friend's brown rice bowl that was so brown it looked like a bowl of coffee grounds but tasted quite yummy.\n\nThe prices are really reasonable and it's close to BART & public transportation.

I'll be back to try more dishes but hopefully without having to park in the area.", "author": "Megan K."}

I went here this afternoon to place a large order for a meeting we were having and Victor, the owner, blew me away with his kindness.  He spent a good 20 minutes talking with me and took the time to go over all the items we wanted to order and make sure nothing was missed and the right amount was noted.  He also cut us a break since we are 501 C(3) and poor, so we did not have to spend too much on our dinner.  I also was given a free appetizer for no apparent reason, I'd already been discounted on the food, it was not necessary but really sweet.  Not only that, I specified that I would pick up the order at 5:00 and they promised the food would be ready by then.  Well, they kept their word and were ready for me when I showed up right on the dot.  And one of the staff insisted on double bagging one of my bags so it didn't break on me even though I was just walking across the street!  Oh, and did I mention the food was a hit??!!

The dish was not very good - it was basic pho but the vegetables were huge! For a soup, I need to be able to chew some of the vegetables, not take several bites of half a brocoli. The flavor was minimal, and I needed extra seasoning, but had to flag down a waiter to ask for sauce. No one came to check on anything, but I was reading and just figured it was a mediocre restaurant experience. It wasn't until the waiter lost it at a customer (see the review written before me by Nathan V.!) that I realized I needed to leave quickly. I honestly don't know what the conflict was, but I've been a server for 6 years, and there is absolutely never a reason that could justify raising your voice at a costumer, even if they were holding a table for five hours.  There are hundreds of different ways of approaching a costumer- including politely explaining that you need to reseat them if it really comes to that- if you need to turn tables over. I felt very uncomfortable, especially as the waiter tried to explain to different tables his version of the story.

Ok, that was a lovely soup.  Now I would like to have my meal.  So I avoided the Pho this time and went with spring rolls and a Vermicelli dish with Imperial Rolls.  First, the spring rolls were pretty tasteless.  Fat and plump, but tasted like green leaves.  Maybe if I was Little Foot from Land Before Time I would have been a fan.  Not sure what the sauce was that came with for dipping, but all it did was make the roll too slippery to pick up with my chop stix.  Now for my vermicelli and Imperial Rolls.  Once again, tasteless sauce and bland vegetables.  The rolls were a nice touch, but even the fried outer coating couldn't save them from the middling interaction they had with my tongue.  The BBQ pork did not help matters.  It was fatty and bland.  The most surprising part of all of this was the line out the door.

I searched for \"soup\" on yelp and this highly rated restaurant caught my eye because of the one $ mark.  \nI had a nice table on the window overlooking a very happening corner in Mission and enjoyed a very hot jasmine tea (on the house) while I waited for my vegetarian hot & sour soup.  I asked the waiter if the soup was spicy, he said \"mild\" but it was definitely spicy!! It was a perfect spicy though, the heat in the cafe combined with the heat of the soup (temperature and spice) helped me sweat out whatever ailment I suffered.  I then asked the waiter how much a side of brown rice would cost and instead of telling me he just ran and got one - $1.75, whatever, not bad (considering the tea was free?) and combined I had a very enjoyable meal.\nThe only truly unenjoyable aspect of my dining experience was the AWFUL music - some FM station playing all of the cheesiest love songs you could imagine.  No seriously, imagine the most cheesy love songs ever and that's what I had to listen to.  Maybe I'm just bitter because instead of being spoon fed homemade soup in bed (where I probably should have been anyway) by a hot man, I was dining alone.  But whatever.  Can I at least get a top 40 pop station?? After being cheesed to death by sappy love songs, I enjoyed my complimentary chocolate mint, marveled at my reasonably low check and walked away with leftovers.  It was nice.", "author": "Rachel G."}

I had a few questions on the menu before ordering.  I've never been given such terrible treatment for asking about the food at a restaurant before.  In the poor waiter's defense he was the only one for a packed restaurant and didn't seem to speak English very well, nor know what the ingredients of the various dishes were, nor was he even able to describe their approximate size.  All this I could handle - I pretty much know all the ingredients already and English troubles I could work with - but when the waiter stomps away in the middle of the conversation and doesn't come back, only to return ten minutes later seeming to have forgotten the previous interaction, and this happens multiple times - I start to get a bit unhappy.  Then he tells me (actually yells at me) that I can't order a single thing on the menu based on??.  I won't stay in a restaurant where they won't even let me order.

It also had to have food for me (VEGAN) to eat.\n\nSo we happened upon Sunflower, and while it's itsybitsyteensyweensy, it feels warm and inviting, with fun tropical-esque colors and fish painted on the walls and just enough grime to make it feel authentic without actually needing a bath immediately afterward eating.  We sat at the counter, right up against the open kitchen and there's something authentic, Anthony Bourdain Cook's Tour-y about it.  I was pleased to see that there are plenty of veggie/vegan things on the menu.  I got the tofu vermicelli noodles and it was delectable - yummy, tangy vinaigrette, good bits of tofu.  A LITTLE too much celery (I feel like celery is filler and not particularly delicious filler at that) but no biggie, and if you're aware of it, you can probably say \"no celery\" or something.  ALSO it's fantastic value - I'm generally founding member, president and chairwoman of the Clean Plate Club, but this ended up being two meals worth for less than 8 dollars.  And they have beer and wine.\n\nBut the best part was the boombox on the counter, right next to where we were sitting.  Seriously, our experience at Sunflower was basically perfect and here's the main reason why:\n\n\"True\" - Spandaue Ballet\n\"Wicked Game\" - Chris Isaak\n\"I Want to Know What Love Is\" - Foreigner\n\"Kiss From a Rose\" - Seal\n\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\" - Rod Stewart\n\"Boys of Summer\" - Don Henley\n\"I'll Make Love to You\" - Boyz II Men\n\"Dreams\" - Fleetwood Mac\n\n\nIN THAT ORDER AND ALL IN A ROW. \n\nOkay, so maybe these four stars should go to 96.5 KOIT's Thursday night DJ, but I also gotta give props to the counter and the loud boombox blasting said songs into my ear right next to my delicious, huge bowl of noodles and my frosty glass of beer.

We looked over the menu and started with the Imperial Rolls which i thought were absolutely delicious, wonderfully crispy on the outside and not typically greasy on the inside like most egg rolls and hot as hell .  I had never had Vietnamese BBQ so decided on the BBQ Pork Vermicelli Noodle which was super tasty although I love spicy so I had to douse it in the chili garlic sauce that they have on the table.  Then we also ordered the Beef Pho which I actually exactly how I imagined it would be so I think that was something that I will skip next time and get something else.  Although I will definitely be craving some Pho on a cold winter day for sure.  All in all food was tasty and service was not terrible (though I never expect really good service in places like this cause I am not going for the service just the food, that is why I still go to YAMO, cause that is awful service)  I liked and will go there.  I will say that I do not recommend this place before a night out on the town cause the kitchen is in the dinning room and you will leave smelling like grease, but its worth it.

As I don't drive into the City, I forgot about the difficulty of finding parking in the Mission.  We were lucky to get a table rather quickly, as I remember that we waited for quite some time the last time we were there as a party of 3.  They sat us rather quickly at the front of the restaurant, but they groaned as we wanted to move the table a bit away from the door, as one of us would have to move every time someone came in or out of the restaurant.  The maitre d' was surly and I kept having to ask for water, which is a pet peeve of mine.  The restaurant was also on the loud side, as I had difficulty hearing some of my friends on the other side of the table.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes, all of which were wonderful.  My favorite is the crepe, which was what I was craving.  The seabass was good, but I didn't need it:\n\n* Vietnamese Crepe - (Banh Xeo) rice flour crepe with bean sprouts, chicken & shrimp. served with lettuce & fish sauce.\n\n* BBQ Chicken and Imperial Rolls with vermicelli - (bun cha gio bo nuong)\n\n* Shaken Beef - exceptionally tender cubes of beef with green onion, black pepper, & garlic.\n\n* Steamed Seabass - filet boneless white meat steamed with ginger, green onion, & sauce", "author": "Albert C."}

Dont get me wrong..love the food, but I was so badly treated by the waiters that I am still in shock and just grateful that I practice non-violence and left after being yelled at and horribly treated by a waiter that I have seen working there for years!! I got there at 6:10 with a friend ordered our dinner and 10 minutes after they brought the food to our table they brought the check. We were not even halfway through our food. they came back several times and tried to take the check but I said we were not done ( I also wanted to order dessert at some point). we were still eating and he came back again to try and pack up our food and take the check again. I asked if there was a problem and could we finish our food...he said we needed to pay we were taking up the table!! First of all the place had many empty tables and nobody waiting, we sat down at 6:10 and at this point it wasn't even 7:00!! Meaning we wer not even allowed an hour for dinner!! he yelled at us and said we had to leave..OMG I was like WTF is going on?? it is the worst experience ever in a restaurant I have ever had!! I said very loudly can I at least get a to go cup for the rest of my ice coffee that I have paid for!! I wanted to make a scene so bad but it is not my style and I didn't want to lower myself to what had just happened.

I was a bit skeptical when I first I saw the menu on the door and nothing was in Vietnamese. I honestly didn't know what kind of food they served (What the hell is beef noodle soup?! or seafood noodle soup?!).  But my friend wanted Vietnamese food and we were getting tired of walking around so we went in. They give us the menu and it is in English as well as in non-accented Vietnamese. Woohoo I could at least recognize somethings. Then I heard the waiters and cooks speaking in Chinese. Hmm  maybe they were ethnic Chinese Vietnamese? But then our food came and I was a bit sad. The crepe itself is good-its crispy and not too oily.  But the vegetarian dipping sauce is mediocre-it taste like soy sauce with vinegar and sugar. Its okay though because I usually eat my crepes with peanut sauce (mien trung style) but their peanut sauce was too watery and bland.  Next was the Hu Tieu aka seafood noodle soup-okay but not good. The broth should be much more flavorful but this was just lacked the zing and the seafood was just pitiful. My friend though ordered the bun with beef and egg rolls and that was delicious! Beef was so flavorful and tender and they give you huge, HUGE portions. \n\nbottom line, if you order stick to the basics-vermicelli, pho, beef. Don't get anything too  fancy. And next time I will get my hu tieu fix in Tenderloin.", "author": "Christie D."}

Another friend and I were standing outside the entrance of the restaurant on the 16th Street side... our friends were on the Valencia side of the restaurant (think L-shaped);  I heard they share a kitchen...\n\nOnce we found our group, we got started with some vegetarian spring rolls.  For dinner, we had the BBQ pork, yellow curry tofu, steamed sea bass, vegetarian pho, the imperial roll with rice 'vermicelli' noodles, and some chicken dish that was supposed to come with rice wrappers, but came with lettuce instead.  All served with steamed rice...  I am not vegetarian, maybe part-time, if any, so I won't comment on the vegetarian-ness of the food but there was a significant selection to choose from.  Being from the South Bay, I felt this place was a little pricey for an 'authentic' Vietnamese restaurant.  \n\nI swam laps earlier in the afternoon, so I didn't really care what I ate when I arrived - I needed a lot  of food and fast!!  So, as long as the food wasn't burnt or totally obscure tasting, I ate it... I had a bit of everything.\n\nThe spring roll appetizer was out in 5 minutes or so, and they served up the food within 20 minutes of our main order (though the restaurant wasn't too busy yet).  Definitely, the broth of the pho was not too thrilling - after I added some basil, 'red rooster' sauce, and bean sprouts, it had a better taste.  Also, there were more noodles than broth, so it almost looked like a saucy noodle dish.  I am a broth fan, so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nWe arrived at 7:20 PMish and by 8 PM patrons were lining up outside for a table, on a mid-week evening.\n\nI am Asian, but not Vietnamese.  So, I can't really comment on the authenticity of the food. But, one guideline that I always use for any cultural restaurant is that if the place has a good cultural representation of the food, then the people of that culture would be eating there.  I did not notice anyone of distinct Vietnamese decent.\n\nThe service was on top of topping off our water glasses.  And, fairly customer service orientated.  I saw several patrons come in and ordered take-out; they were in and out within 5-7 minutes.\n\nThough I am not terribly familiar with the Mission district, I would head back there for a basic meal.

Sunflower is a fav because everything is delicious and it's reasonably priced and the staff are friendly as hell and the ambience is just right, plus you're surrounded by 25 dive bars so what more can you want. Have the larb salad, fresh spring rolls, any of the soups and the steamed fish with ginger, if you walk out the door and get hit by a bus it wouldn't be a bad way to go, though it would be a bit unlucky as no buses go down Valencia. Oh it has two doors and I prefer to eat on the Valencia Street side, it's less brightly lit and a bit more relaxed.", "author": "mefloquine x."}

But I also want to make sure that the restaurants I review with four or five-star ratings aren't clumped anywhere near the same category as restaurants who provide substandard food.  This is San Francisco - the best city in the world for food.  I have had so many wonderful culinary experiences in this city since I moved here.  But not at Sunflower.  My boyfriend remembers this place as one of his favorites and so we went to try it.  The salad rolls were really bland.  The spring rolls were okay - but again kind of bland and just too oily and doughy.  And the soup we got was sparse and uneventful.  And the prices are not that cheap - there are many restaurants with the same prices who provide simply amazing food.  Maybe they can get away with this in a different city and maybe if I lived in another place I'd be thrilled that there is a restaurant like this in town - but I live in San Francisco and my standards are high.

We never saw reservations signs on the table, but we were fine with not being seated at that particular table.  We told him we would still wait at the table that was \"reserved\" until the people across from us were done with paying the check.  The host still demanded that we sit near the cold door.

And since we were feeling especially poor, we were in search of a place disregarding the typical San Francisco standard of charging 2.5X what the food is actually worth. Luckily for us, we found Sunflower, a very unassuming \"authentic\" Vietnamese restaurant in the Mission. Now just how authentic this place actually is, I will not comment, however, the food was delicious, the service relatively friendly and quick. We ordered the fresh vegetarian spring rolls, two enormous rice paper wrapped parcels stuffed with sauted cabbage, mushrooms, tofu, carrots, lettuce, mint, and basil served with a delicately sweet, yet slightly spicy sauce. Two humongous rolls for $4.50. Not bad at all, in fact, I probably would have been full on that dish alone, but since we split it, we also ordered entrees. I went for the steamed chicken salad- lean strips of chicken breast atop a mound of shredded cabbage, carrots, and onions and topped with diced peanuts and mint. Lila ordered the fried beef noodles, a rather heavy dish with chow mien style noodles, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and beef. The chicken salad was light and crunchy. However, I was not even able to finish it, as the portions are huge. Lila's beef noodle dish was also quite good, although I am not sure how authentically Vietnamese it actually was. My salad was only $5.50, and it may well have been enough for two people. So, all in all come to Sunflower if you want some flavorful Vietnamese style food without emptying your bank account.", "author": "Kate A."}

I was impressed by the low price, and the inside of the restaurant looked cozy, if a bit loud.  However, I was a little disappointed by my food.  The Imperial Rolls were just big fried blah, not crispy or particularly flavorful, and with no sauce.  I guess I should have paid the $1 extra to get the fresh spring rolls instead.  The rice vermicelli and pork were okay, but not very warm (even though I ate less than 10 mins after picking up my food) and just not too flavorful.  I frequently order this dish at Vietnamese restaurants and this was definitely one of the lamer versions I've had. I felt like they were missing some of those amazing Vietnamese herbs/mint.  I can't really complain since the price was so low, but I don't think I'll go back, at least not for that dish...", "author": "Leah K."}

The food was ok, but the service was TERRIBLE!!!. I asked the waiter for some water and he gave me a whole pitcher of water and placed it near my plate and it almost spilled. I guess I had to serve my own water. Finally we got the check and we had a discrepancy on the check and we asked him for a brief explanation. The total came out to about $35.00, but for some reason we didnt get the right change. He rudely said, \" I had to add tax, WHAT YOU DON'T PAY FOR TAX?\" Instaed of politely telling me that he said it like we didnt know better. So I said F##K it and started to leave without giving him any tip, because of his poor service. He then opened the check book and realized their was no tip and angrily said,\"What happened?\" I told him, the service was terrible and he got upset. So overall the food was mediocre and the service was TERRIBLE!! I do not reccommend this restaurant to anyone. There are other restaurants out there with better service.", "author": "Mikey B."}

Molly and I stopped in for a quick lunch on Monday around 1:30pm. They have the best lunch special in town, in my opinion. For $7.95 you get a cup of hot & sour soup, asian cabbage slaw, fresh spring rolls (usually comes with an imperial roll, but I substitute the fress roll for 50 cents), rice and entree. I got the lemongrass prawns, a heaping portion of sauteed green beans, onions, prawns, garlic, lemongrass and chilies. I absolutely love the soup, a tangy and slightly spicy broth with chunks of pineapple, tomatoes, tofu, mushrooms and bean sprouts. The fresh spring rolls, filled with vermicelli noodles, lettuce, mint, basil and shrimps, are one of my favorite food items ever. They serve it with a clear sauce, today a little heavy on the fish sauce, so I also asked for a side of peanut sauce for dipping. I can never eat the entire plate of 5 different items, so it usually makes a great second meal or afternoon snack. Molly ordered the vegetarian noodle soup, a giant bowl filled to the brim, overflowing with rice noodles, cabbage, mushrooms, tofu and a meriad of other vegetables. The portion is definitely enough for 2-3 people, so for $6, this is definitely a great bargain. I never get sick of Sunflower and especially reccommend the lunch special (though any meal there is usually great). I also like the full portion of the hot & sour soup and could probably eat that everyday.", "author": "Ariel D."}

It is important to note that I douse it in that tasty sweet plum sauce.  Some people may believe if you have to put condiments of any sort on a dish that it can't be THAT good.  In this instance, I'd disagree.  Only because the moment I see that plum sauce I throw it in heaping piles on top of anything in front of me because I usually like it more than anything in front of me.  I guess I should make a Yelp review on the plum sauce.  I don't even know what it's officially called.

It is one of the more satisfying Vietnamese places in the City, and for the price, an absolute bargain. That's why it'sbeen there for 3 decades, and is routinely SRO on weekends. I agree with Gregory C that there is better Pho to be found, especially in places that specialize. Happily, there are other options than usual to choose from, and while they're not all outstanding, many are standouts.  Their steamed sea bass melts in your mouth and can be addicting;  their clay pot special feeds two, with caramelized onions, chicken, sweet pork sausages and veggies heaped in a clay pot with a slightly sweet ginger sauce on stove toasted rice. Their Vietnamese crepe is the best I've sampled, with a large crispy crepe, filled with, jerk style chicken, shrimps, bean sprouts (or total veggie with tofu) that you wrap in fresh mint, green lettuce and  coriander - a light, refreshing meal in itself.  Imperial rolls, meat and vegetarian, are unfailingly crunchy and ready to be rolled in leaves with pickled daikon. My partner is a fan of their crispy noodles with veggie topping - not the most exotic dish, but refreshingly light as a side dish. Everyone works hard at this restaurant; it's frequently packed at lunch and dinner, and by the end, the cook and wait staff have been running around for hours, serving dishes that average less than $10.  Still, I find them to be warm and efficient at all times. It's amazing what comes out of the miniscule kitchen, which is on display on the 16th street side of the restaurant (the other entrance is on Valencia).", "author": "Mark T."}

You can eat plates and plates of food, have some Hue beers and still end up paying well under $20 each for dinner. It's cheap, tasty - a good casual place to meet up without reservations.   Now, about the food. Here are some of my favorite dishes:  Vietnamese crepe - No, this isn't their way of competing with Ti Couz across the street. This is a really tasty appetizer chock full of crispy fresh mung sprouts and shrimp, chicken, and other goodies. It's kind of like an omelet but filled with tasty goodies. It's pretty big, so something good to split with a few people.   Shaken beef - I think this is one of the best beef dishes anywhere. It's simple, but really flavorful. The meat is extremely tender, not fatty, and under $10 (I think). This is definitely a crowd favorite.   Chicken soup with egg noodles (not rice noodles) - Whenever I'm sick, I hobble down to Sunflower for this soup. Simple flavors that are the best thing for clearing up a cold.   One last thing to know about Sunflower is that there are 2 locations. So if you're ever meeting a friend there, specify the Valencia or 16th street entrances. The Valencia side has a touch more atmosphere, forgiving lighting, more seating, and a bathroom. But, the 16th St side is where you'd pick up takeout, get a quick lunch by yourself, or if you enjoy flourescent lighting.", "author": "J K."}
