This location is at the Metreon, so there's an added benefit of being able to see a movie before or after you eat. \n\nThey had their usual variety of dishes: vegetables, meat and fish, curries, and noodles. My go-to is the sweet lime fish and either green beans or eggplant with fried rice. The servers were generous with the portions, which was a change from Westfield, so that made me happy. \n\nThere's also plenty of seating that is shared between the neighboring restaurants and it isn't too loud, so that's a plus.

I had to throw mine away because we didn't want to carry it all day.\n2) Ask for no sugar added to the Lychee Iced Tea. It was way too sweet.\n\nTaste wise the food was ok.

Aside from the wait, my only other complaint is that my egg was overly burnt... but I had so much chicken that it was easy to overlook that flaw. My noodles were soft and flavorful.

The server replied \"no\" and left it at that, indicating for me to choose something else from the (limited) options. I then asked her what was coming out next to which she turned around to look, grab the food that was out, and then re-fill the display. I ended up getting that (some sort of chicken dish) since it was freshly cooked. The chicken was still bland and dry. The bf had gotten some other chicken dish before the refill happened and that was definitely no bueno. On the plus side, the curry was pretty decent and tasty. They do give you a good size portion of it too. If I ever come back here again, that is probably what I'll order. My only complaint was that it too had been out for awhile.

However, after 3 visits I can now safely say that I am not impressed by this place.\nLet's start with the name: Coriander Gourmet Thai.  If I could get them for false advertising, I would.  There is nothing distinctly gourmet about this place.  When I think of gourmet, I think of fancy, well prepared, high quality, good looking dishes.  This place falls way short of that.\nFor $14, you can get a 1-item dish with Pad Thai substituted and a large Thai Iced Tea.  Keep in mind that the Pad Thai will run you an extra 75 cents and it has an off-putting odor about it.  You can tell it's rubbery and dry when they pile it into container. Even the sweet spicy sauce does it no justice. Its not really that good for Pad Thai, but what can you expect for fast food?\nThe Spicy Catfish was good, but the outside coating was mushy and just sort of fell apart as I picked it up.  Nice level of heat though.\nThe Thai Iced Tea was what you would expect: cold, sweet and a light hint of spice to it.  A little too much milk in it though for my tastes.\nThe place wasn't super busy for a weekend, but then again, the lunch rush was just beginning.\nThe cashier was friendly I suppose.  Nothing to rant and rave about.  He did have to remake my drink twice because of leaking cups.\nThey use compostable cups and containers, but the straws and forks looked like they were made of plastic.  Well, at least they are trying.\nOverall, a mediocre experience.  I read somewhere else on here that their food is packed with MSG.  Not a good thing for my diet, so I may not return on that alone.\nCoriander Thai; a long way from good Thai food, but if you don't mind the price and the fast food concept, it's edible and will fill you up.", "author": "Richard L."}

I work near Metreon and this is always my 'go-to' place and is WAY better than the more expensive sit-down Cha-Am on Folsom & 3rd, for example.  Coriander's various chicken dishes are always consistently good and, to add, the chicken itself is very high quality and is cut into nice chunky pieces -- and, they give you hefty portions every time.  I've also enjoyed the beef choices.  I would say the one protein source they offer that I'm not as hot on is the fish -- catfish or whatever whitefish they use -- but I just don't order that.  It's nice that you can get white or brown rice (latter is $0.50 extra though) or pad thai as part of the meal.  Yes, this is not the ultimate in pad thai but it's definitely ok in my book and, yes, it's a tad 'al dente' although that's actually how I like it -- I hate when it's overcooked.

The tofu was hard and rubbery, the noodles were drenched in a thick sauce. It was one of the few times in my life I wish I could have thrown it up and ate somewhere else and to top it off, it was $11. It was hard to walk by chipotle on my way out =(", "author": "Ryan M."}

Thai tea was very good. My very picky friend even ordered two cups! They don't have many selections but we were very happy with the foods we ordered and we ordered about half of the menu they offer. The food and drink tasted like genuine Thai American cuisine.", "author": "Moria W."}

Pad Thai noodles were cardboardy and tasteless. Crispy roll was satisfyingly crunchy yet also tasteless. Sweet basil chicken was better, if a bit too sweet.", "author": "Marina C."}

But luckily pad thai is one of the free sides you get. \n\nNo line when I was there this Friday afternoon at 1PM.\n\nDon't forget to ask for iced water. No need to pay extra $$ for bottled water.", "author": "Keiko C."}

The rice was dry and crumbly. The tofu dish was good albeit overly salty. The best thing about my experience here was the really friendly service, which was great but unfortunately does not warrant a return.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

The yellow curry was very fresh and creamy, and the pad thai was decent! I would DEFINITELY come back.", "author": "Teresa S."}
