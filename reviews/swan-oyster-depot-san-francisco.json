I guess Friday afternoon is starting to get into the weekend territory and the turnover was very slow for some reason.  We almost gave up, but are glad we waited it out!\n\nIt's hard to describe the Swan Oyster Depot experience.  The menu and service is simple. They serve great seafood!  They're an institution!  \n\nHubs and I had: clam chowder (slightly briny, but not too fishy), smoked salmon (on French bread, with some shrimp salad on the side), combo salad (comes with small shrimp, prawns, and crab).  Oh, and don't forget the Anchor Steam cause this is the kind of food that goes great with a beer.  We were stuffed so the food was generously portioned. \n\nThe food is just GOOD and such a joy and delight. There's no pretension here.  On the surface, it's hard to say why this place is so great, but it is such a joy to here. And I say that having been to other great SF places like Tadich Grill, Hog Island, Waterbar.  \n\nWorth the wait. Though, we'll def try to come back in a weekday!", "author": "Kathryn C."}

Finally found a weekday to come try out SOD for my wife's bday -- a true seafood lover.\n\nPlace has a classic SF seafood feel to it.  The service matches the look, giving you a truly memorable experience. Great attention to detail, with generous portions of fresh lemon wedges, bowls of crisp oyster crackers, some excellent, crusty sourdough bread.\n\nSeafood was good, not amazing but enjoyable.  However on this day, there were more negatives than I'd like to have encountered.\n\nFist off as we stood in line, we watched them make the crab salads through the window.  Instead of using tongs or gloves, they just use their bare hands to scoop handfuls onto your salad.  My wife noticed one guy had dirty fingernails.  I didn't see it, but I know she was instantly turned off.  Mind you... I'm trying to take her somewhere special for her birthday, and she's sensitive to cleanliness.\n\nUpon sitting, I order fresh uni, crab back, chowder, crab salad, and a dozen oysters / clams on the half shell.  \n\nFirst thing he tells me is he recommends we save the uni for last, since it's best that way.  Hey... you're the expert, whatever you recommend,\nI'm down!  My wife loves seafood, but never had uni, so this was a huge part of our trip.\n\nNext he said there's no more crab back, can only get it if we order a half crab, so once again I said... No Prob!  He brought us the crab shell and my wife ate it up.\n\nThe chowder was so so sadly.  Next be brought the crab salad and oysters / clams.  I asked if he had any cocktail sauce, he said that he did, but that he didn't recommend it on the salad, but I told him it was for the oysters.  Got a little puzzled after that advice... then things got more weird. (Btw the crab leg meat on our salad was so skimpy, not at all like these photos we saw on Yelp)\n\nI told him we were ready for the uni.  He went to go get it, came back and told us someone had just ordered the last one!  We came here specifically for that for my wife's birthday, but due to your recommendation, now we can't get it??\n\nOK... so from there I asked if he was still bringing the half crab.  He said \"you ordered that?\"  I said \"yeah, you told me I had to.\"  Surprised, he goes and gets it, and the claws and legs are SO small, but I just figured that's how they are.  But then the guys next to me get theirs and it's SO much bigger!  Mind you we are not paying by the pound, so we are just getting hosed.  Not to mention, it would have been a nice gesture to hook us up after screwing us over on the uni.\n\nBy now I'm just in SMH mode and just can't believe this place.  It went from so cool and amazing, to this really sucks in about 5 minutes.  I was still really hungry, but there really wasn't anything left on the menu that was going to fill me up -- not a place to come and get your stomachs filled.\n\nSo as my tip says, if you're going to come here, try to get one of the older, more seasoned servers.  We had one of the young guys, who was really trying, but just couldn't deliver us the type of experience we deserved sadly.\n\nI had to go eat a real lunch elsewhere after we left.  So this was like $150 in appetizers for 3.  And then they take cash only!!!\n\nTo be honest, their rating is hovering just above 2 stars for the experience, but I'm giving them benefit of the doubt and believing it's at least 3 stars on most other days.

Every seat at their bar was taken, and there was another group waiting for the next round of seating. 10 minutes later, the line behind us had grown longer. Apparently people don't need to work around here.\n\nThis place gives off a great neighborhood feel, and it is no frills seafood that is fresh and delicious. You see the seafood heaped in the window and the servers scooping it into cups and bowls. We ordered the crab back, prawn cocktail, crab cocktail, and clam chowder. The clam chowder looks grainy and tastes like it was actually made of clam. The crab back was chilled and had unidentifiable pieces of crab that tasted almost like tofu. My favorite was the prawn cocktail, which comprised of jumbo prawns that were fat and juicy in a sweet ketchupy sauce. \n\nThe servers are friendly but efficient. The total was around $50.

I specifically planned this to be my very first stop to San Francisco straight from the airport. We were arriving on a Friday, and I knew that it opens at 10:30 and that people start lining up way before that, so I was concerned that we would have to wait. \n\nOur flight landed at SFO around 8:15, but by the time we got our rental car and came into the city, it was 10:15. After parking in the garage around the corner we made our way to the door in line. We were very fortunate to be part of the first group that was seated, otherwise we would have been hungry grumpy customers after an early flight. \n\nOnto the food: the oysters were fresh and everything we expected. We pretty much let the guy behind the counter decide for us, seeing that they're very old school without an online presence or menu to choose in advance. We also got the crab cocktail, sashimi, sea urchin, and two cups of clam chowder. The total cost came out to $104. Very pricey and they only accept cash, so come prepared to pay! \n\nSide tip: do not come here wearing anything LA on it. We're from San Diego, and my husband was wearing a Padres cap.

So briny and rich and really just the essence of the crab.

I could've eaten 3 plates of these.\n\nSicilian Sashimi - Assorted sashimi (today there was ahi, salmon, hamachi, scallop and mackerel) drizzled in olive oil and topped with red onions and capers.  This one was actually not my favorite.  The oil dressing was a bit bland; eating together with capers added some much needed pop but overall not something I'd order again\n\nDozen Eggs - Thin sliced scallops sitting in a pool of ponzu and topped with drops of sriracha.

Gulping it all down while holding the crab shell was quite satisfying.\n\nThe clam chowder carried quite a lot of clam flavor, unlike other, more disappointing chowder. It did not have too much cream.\n\nIn summary, this place represent my seafood paradise.\n\nNote that I arrived at 11AM on Monday and waited 35 minutes for a seat.

It did not disappoint as it was my favorite meal in the city.\n\nI will say - the line IS long. It just is what it is. When we arrived around 1pm, I asked one of the women at the front how long she had been waiting so far and she said almost 2 hours. I remembered seeing on a Yelp review that they allow to-go orders so that's what we did. I called and placed an order for pickup and it was ready in 20 minutes. I went to the front of the line, squeezed my way in and happily departed with my bag of treasures. We walked one block to a nearby coffee shop and ate it there. I know we missed out on the ambiance and environment of the shop but the food was still good and that's my main concern.\n\nThe combination salad with louie dressing is to die for. Very generous portion of super fresh seafood piled on top and the dressing is amazingly creamy. We also had a small order of the Sicilian Sashimi which was excellent. The scallops were my favorite of the plate. Next time I'd want an order of just those! The crab back with bread was just okay. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it - probably wouldn't order it again. I wish the butter/fat was warm.\n\nLooooved the meal overall. I will come here again and again as long as ordering to-go is still an option. However, I will say that I would never wait in a 2+ hour line to eat this food.

Our fault, not theirs of course.)\n\nMy mom's favorite food in the world is crab. Everyone jokes if crab is on the menu, she will be there. We have been meaning to check out Swan Depot for ages.

Well, I'm here to say drop everything and high tail it to Swan Oyster Depot.\n\nThe seafood was out of this world. We just got back from two weeks in Alaska and Seattle and let me tell you, they have nothing on Swan Oyster. My son got the clam chowder. With oyster crackers and bread and butter, heavenly. I must note that the bread was the old school sf sourdough bread. Crunchy on the outside with the perfect amount of sour on the soft inside. Perfect combination. My mom ordered the crab cocktail, and when I say she is a crab expert, I'm not kidding. She said it was the best crab she has ever had. I had the prawn cocktail with their cocktail sauce and a touch of horseradish. It was hands down the best prawn cocktail I've ever had. \n\nAs I said we got there just before closing time, so didn't have time to order more. But saw the couple beside us devour trays of oysters and scallops that looked divine. We cannot wait to go back to try the crab back, as well as the crab and lobster in butter. Rumor has it they also have an amazing Cobb salad. Hmmmm, I'm already hungry for more seafood. I cannot wait to add Swan Oyster Depot to my regular restaurant rotation.", "author": "Victoria O."}

For seafood lovers out there, this is the place to go for the most fresh and unique experience you'll ever find in the city. I had been wanting to go to SOD for years, but never had the time or opportunity to do so knowing the wait line was also going to be long. I am so glad that I finally visited it today. On a Tuesday morning, I arrived around 10:30 and the first 19 people (there are only 19 seats) were already being served. I was 3rd in line for the second batch. Not bad. The wait was around 30 mins before I was finally seated. I thought I was lucky. \n\nI immediately ordered the items that I have been dreaming to eat for years. Crab back (with bread and butter), fresh oysters on half shell, and crab salad. The Crab back was delicious. I slurped up that golden fatty soup like it was my last meal. Come to think of it, this trio would probably be my last meal if I had to choose. The crab meat was generous. Enough for two hungry people. The oyster selection was impressive. They were the freshest and tastiest oysters I've had in the Bay Area. I've had great oysters up in Tomales Bay and Humboldt too.  But if you wanna eat their famous oysters in one place (and for less $), you should have them here at SOD. \n\nThe service was great as well. The guys there love what they're doing and proud of their offerings. People seem to really enjoy their time here. It's a bit expensive. But I think if you're gonna splurge on seafood, this is where you should spend it. It's worth it. Seafood should be enjoyed as is anyway. There's no fancy fluffy preparation here.

The seats are aligned in a row at a counter. It looks really cramped for people in the center, so my boyfriend and I were lucky to be at the edge close to the door. We had already checked recommendations for food and were ready to order. We decided on the crab back, the half cracked crab, half dozen of cherry stone clams, half dozen of kumamoto oysters, and a large sashimi platter (consists of 20ish pieces of their fresh sashimi of the day for $32 and was not on the menu). All orders came out in a timely manner. First was the crab back, for $8. For those who are familiar with the crab back when they cook crab at home, it tastes the same. Not sure if they add anything to the contents. Nonetheless, it was tasty dipping with the bread that is provided. Next cane the oysters and clams. Being a fan of Kumamoto oysters, it did not disappoint. Their red hot sauce was delicious! I don't think I've ever had raw clams, but these clams were also very good. I wanted more of them as we scarfed them down. Next was the half cracked crab. Super meaty and super good. I just ate it plain and enjoyed it. My boyfriend ate most of it though since crab is his favorite. Lastly, we got the sashimi platter. It was smaller than I thought! I'm used to sashimi at Japanese restaurants. This one is drizzled with olive oil, chopped red onions, and capers. It's definitely got a unique taste in comparison to Japanese sashimi. I'll be honest though, I don't think I'd order it again. Maybe I didn't realize how much I don't like capers. My boyfriend and I eat pretty quick, so we sat and paid in about 30ish minutes time. I'd wait in line again for this seafood heaven, and I hate lines! Probably try the combination seafood salad since it looked like a lot of people were ordering that.\n\nThis place is cash only by the way.

Arrived at 3.40pm and waited about 30 minutes before I set foot into this magical seafood heaven.\n\nI had the Boston chowder, a dozen oysters, the Sicilian sashimi platter and the combination salad. The chowder was super flavorful and light, yet creamy. I have no complaints, especially at $2.75 a bowl! The oysters were an assortment of Miyagi, Kumamoto, and Blue Point. They were easily the freshest oysters I've ever had - not briny, not gritty, and very meaty. I could probably down two dozen on my own. Next up was the sashimi platter. I opted for the small size given the amount of food I ordered but in hindsight, I should've gone with medium. I don't know why I underestimate my own eating abilities sometimes. Anyway, it came with 2 pieces of tuna, scallop, salmon, and hamachi each, topped with olive oil, shallots, capers, and peppers. While I enjoyed every piece, to me the scallop was exceptional. I mean wow. It was sweet and literally melted in your mouth and I usually hate raw scallops. Last was the combination salad - it came with bay shrimp, prawns, a ton of crab meat atop a bed of iceberg lettuce with a side of Louie sauce. Again, it was super fresh and da bomb.\n\nAll in all, it was a superb experience, worth every penny. Will be back!\n\nP.S. The guys behind the counter were super nice!

After taking a look at the menu, we ordered 2 bowls of clam chowder, 3 combination seafood cocktails, 2 crab salads, a dozen little neck clams, smoked salmon, and 4 crab backs. This was the perfect amount for us and we cleaned our plates. The clam chowder is more on the runny side, but had a lot of clammy goodness! I was especially impressed by the smoked salmon. Smoked salmon tends to be salty and... salty. Not here! It had a subtle saltiness and it was extremely buttery. I've never had smoked salmon like that and I wished I didn't because it'll be hard to top going forward. \n\nThe restaurant was extremely clean and I loved the atmosphere. The entire staff was friendly and accommodating. The owner made us crab back sauce to go with our crab salad. He really made sure we had everything we needed. I absolutely loved our dining experience here and will come again.", "author": "Kenitha Y."}

It was salmon, tuna, hamachi and scallop...I could've eaten about two more plates by myself.\n\nThe crab back was something different that id never seen anywhere, the cold stock of crab with some of the yellow fat that comes from the guts of the crab, the only people that don't regularly mess with this stuff is Americans, if you know about the yellow fat chances are you aren't American or you come from a third world country. They served it with a little bread and butter and it was great on the buttered bread.\n\nside note; The yellow fat is amazing when saut\u00e9ed with onions, garlic and shelled crab.\n\nThis place is really special, definitely worth checking out at least once in your life.", "author": "Megan K."}

Since it is small, the wait is definitely long with such a popular and small locale, but I found it worth the wait. We waited 2 hours on a Saturday, arriving a little before opening. At the window of the restaurant are trays of seafood and they look delectable and fresh! \n\nThe seafood here is fantastic! It's not an upscale restaurant but it seems fresh and reminiscent of a fish market. The menu is on the wall and seems pretty basic, though it helped that we looked on Yelp for tips and pictures. (They're also rather flexible on sizes that you can order. We were full and wanted to try the smoked salmon so they were able to give us a half order.)\n\n+CRAB BACK: This is delicious and I haven't had this anywhere else. They give you bread with it, which goes nicely with the seafoody and pleasant bitter flavor of the crab.\n+SICILIAN SASHIMI: Various types of seafood that are topped with capers and onions, and with what seems to be olive oil. This is delicious and goes so well with each of the five types of sashimi. \n+SCALLOP SASHIMI: We loved the scallop sashimi so much that we ordered an extra small order, and it was delicious! It's soft and similar to butter. \n+OYSTERS & CHERRY CLAMS: We were able to split getting half a dozen of each, and they were amazing. There's a little tray of mignonette and sauces, as well as lemons, and they were great. First time having raw clams and these were large and great!\n+CLAM CHOWDER: There are a good amount of clams and it's quite delicious! Great compliment to all the other cold seafood.\n\nAll in all, the seafood here is quite delicious. After the meal, they asked us what we got and added it up on a napkin. Kind of seems like they take it by honor system since they just ask you what you got. Be aware that they're cash only so bring enough! We were a little sad that they ran out of uni, and there's still so much to try there (like the crab salad) so I hope to return to have their delicious seafood!", "author": "Mimi T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-19", "description": "Swan Oyster Depot is THE oyster bar in San Francisco. It's been at this location for over 100 years, so you know that they've got it down. Everything here is sooooo good, just remember to bring enough cash because you'll be tempted to try everything!! It's probably best to arrive here before they open to make sure you're one of the first ones to sit down. If you show up later, it's guaranteed that they will run out of Uni, Blue Point Oysters or the Crab Back. \n\nWAIT/LINE - Arrived here at 11am on a Saturday and the line was already pretty long. I assumed it would be around an hour or so, but we waited 2.5 hours for a group of 4. We ended up sitting separately because it was easier to seat groups of 2 than 4. \n\nOYSTERS - The first thing that I highly recommend trying is their Miyagi, Shigoku oysters. We didn't get to sample the Blue Points because they ran out. However, the Miyagi and Shigoku were both sweet and meaty. The Kumamotos were honestly not worth it. At $18 for half a dozen, they were the size of quarters. The guy gave us an extra one because of the size, but I'd rather have the larger ones instead. \n\nSASHIMI - Something that isn't on their menu is their sashimi platter. You can order a small, medium or large portion with two, three or four slices of fish respectively. The sashimi was super fresh and had yellowtail, salmon, tuna, scallops and halibut. It arrived drizzled with olive oil, topped with capers and red onions. This by far was one of my favorite things to order here.\n\nSALAD - SOD has an assortment of salads you can order from shrimp, prawns, crab and lobster. You can even opt for the combination, but I preferred sampling their crab salad. At a hefty price of $30, this salad was not cheap, but it was very delicious. The crab on the salad was not only abundant, but it was buttery and flaky at the same time. And their signature Louie Sauce was just perfection.\n\nCLAMS - Cherry stone clams on the half shell are a must-try too, half a dozen for $14. Add a little horseradish and their mignonette, and it's got quite the kick. Or eat them as is with a splash of lemon, it's very meaty and delectable. \n\nCLAM CHOWDER - Boston Clam Chowder here does not come with potatoes or clams, but it's packed with a ton of flavor. It's the perfect consistency to dip your bread in, not too heavy, it's just right. I personally prefer it this way more than anything else. \n\nIf I had one bad thing to say about SOD is that the workers handled money and seafood, hand in hand. without washing their hands in between. I wish they would just wear gloves or use utensils to serve, but that's just not the case here. \n\nWhen I come here again in the future, I do plan on arriving earlier than I did so that I wouldn't have to wait as long. Also, I would be able to try other items before they run out. Love this place, can't wait to visit again!", "author": "Nancy L."}

The line stretched down the block and the restaurant only has one long counter for seating. It took about two hours before I got seated. It is possible to order online and one woman did eventually do that instead of waiting for the line though it looks like online order still take a good 20 to 30 minutes to prepare. If you do online and order it looks like you're able to just cut the line and pick up the food tho you will definitely get a few angry stares.\n\nThe restaurant is cash only and the prices aren't as cheap as I expected so definitely make sure to withdraw enough money (I wasn't very hungry but still managed to spend about $50). The biggest positive about this place was definitely the service. Everyone was so sweet though also busy enough where it was a bit hard to get their attention if I need anything.\n\nFor my meal I got the following:\n-Cup of Clam Chowder w/ bread: Definitely full of clams but the soup itself was very average. It's very light (which I don't mind) but a bit watery. I really wish the bread was toasted or a bit more acidic. It was pretty dense and a bit tough. It wasn't quite good enough to eat alone and the chowder wasn't flavorful enough to work with the bread (2/5)\n\n-Oysters: I asked for 2 of each of the oysters they had (the menu was a bit confusing, they had 3 more clearly listed varieties so I thought I was getting 6 but in reality they had like 5-6 varieties but I got 4? I was fine with this but definitely confused). I got the blue points from Tomales, blue points from the east coast, miyagis from british columbia, and kumamoto oysters. Definitely the best item of the meal. Every type was so unique and fresh. If I came back this would definitely be my go to. Still pricy but worth it. (4.5/5)\n\n-Half Cracked Crab: A delicious and sweet crab that was very skillfully cracked. Never had such an easier time eating crab. But tastewise it's just a fresh crab. Not worth $22 for just half. It comes with bread but honestly the bread just takes away from the delicate flavors and texture. (3/5)\n\nOverall, I have to admit I'm more than a bit disappointed. Between the popularity and the wonderful service I really had high hopes. The items are all very fresh but it's not better than places where I don't have to wait 2 hours and it's not cheaper either.

When asking a couple of people in front of us how long the wait would be, we received shrugs and laughs as they didn't seem to care. As a hangry New Yorker, I unfortunately don't have the patience to stand in line for an hour+, especially not knowing how long I'd be waiting for. Luckily, I read that you can order take out, so I skipped the line and went to order my food to go. \n\nOrdering take out is confusing here as there's no clear place to stand to order take out. I went all the way to the back only to be told to go back to the front. Fortunately for me, someone else was placing an order to go, so he directed me to just stand behind him. FYI - it doesn't seem like people really order take out here, so just awkwardly stand next to the first stool and someone will eventually come assist you. Also, just because you're ordering take out doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be helped quicker - I waited around 20 minutes before I was acknowledged and helped (I think they felt bad for me standing there alone, as the guy before me said he waited a good 45 minutes before being helped). \n\nFor two people, I ordered a medium sashimi (not listed on the board above, but it's available), a dozen mixed oysters, a cup of clam chowder, and bread and butter. All this will run you $59. I also tried to order the crab back, but they're not in season / available in August. \n\nA medium sashimi comes with 15 pieces soaked in olive oil and capers. I had no idea that sashimi can be prepared this way as I'm used to Japanese sashimi. Mind blown as this preparation was delicious. Our favorite fish was the scallop, but all the pieces were oh so tender. The oysters were probably one of the best oysters I've had as they were all sweet and large. I loved how the guy labeled each oyster for me on the plates! The clam chowder isn't your typical clam chowder as it's super watery, but definitely does not lack in flavor. I wish I had ordered a bowl instead of a cup because the guy gave us SO much bread (which was delicious btw because it's Boudin's sourdough bread - definitely worth the $1). \n\nLong story short, the food is absolutely amazing here. Yes it's pricy, but if you're coming here, you're 99% a tourist, so hey you'll be dropping $$$$ when on vacation. Go early (10:30 I read was the magical time to get first round of seating) or just order take out! There's a park nearby where you can feast with no shame.", "author": "Wendy L."}

We knew coming here that this seafood spot only sits 19 people at a time.  We thought the wait would be an hour but it ended up to be three hours long!  Good thing I was with good company who also made donut runs for us so it wasn't too bad.  While our wait, we were given samples of smoked salmon deviled eggs and other goods on crackers.  About after one hour in of our wait at 2pm, they told us that they had run out of crab.  What a bummer...    \n\nMy party was five people.  When we got to the front of the line there were three open seats so they had three of us eat first.  About 10 minutes later the two seats next to us was available so it wasn't such a big deal.  If you go in a big group, just expect that you might have to split up since it is only booth sitting and they have to be courtesy to those still in line.  \n\nThe owner served us personally.  He was extra friendly and very sweet.  We were instantly given complementary bread and butter.  We all shared four different types of oysters that were all amazing.  I also tried their calm chowder which I liked but the others didn't.  I like that it wasn't too creamy and didn't contain too much potatoes.  Those who came with me thought it tasted too oceany.  The oyster crackers though were awfully stale.  Probably because they just leave it out for whoever to use.  We also shared a large size of sashimi.  You get a choice of four different types for a large.  We got tuna, scallops, salmon, and yellowtail.  All were amazing and super fresh.  They were topped with capers and some oil.  My only complaint was how small a large size it and how thin they were.  I also tried some of their cocktail prawns.  An order was about 4-5 prawns.  They were pretty good.  For drinks, I stuck with their delicious michelada that was made perfectly.\n\nOur total was about $120.  I thought pricing was alright.  The service was fast and excellent.  Everything is made right in front of you and it was quite an experience.

I went their at 9am and had to stay in line for 2 hours to go inside the restaurant. And if you're planning on coming after that, bring enough snacks to hold you for 3+ hours. There's a really good hummus and baked pita place next to it. I would def recommend to have that while waiting in line. \n\nI tried their Sea Urchin (Uni), crab, crab butter with bread, oysters and clam chowder. \nStart with Clam Chowder: super creamy and delicious but it makes you feel full so I wouldn't recommend it if you're planning on ordering a lot of fishes. \nThen they served Crab butter with bread and some sauces in it and crab meat. Ohhh sooooo good. Super fresh and super easy to eat. They crack it open very well. Highly recommended \nThen they served 3 different types of oysters. I was not a big oyster fan, but after trying this I fell in love with it to the point where I drove 2 hours to the place where they get those oysters from and had dozen oysters ALL BY MYSELF. yes they are gooood have it and don't think about it. \nLet's talk about uni. They crack open the sea urchin and serve it super fresh.  You can even see the moving legs of sea urchin. My conversation with sea urchin. Hey Sea Urchin!

We had 6 hours in San Francisco to hit all the places so we went to Swan Oyster Depot for our first stop. The line was already long 15 minutes before opening. When the door opened, we just happened to miss the first group to get seats. While we waited, we got to look at the menu and checked out what everyone was ordering. After waiting for 30 minutes, we sat down and ordered the following items from the menu:\n1. Combination salad\n2. Half dozen oysters and half dozen clams\n3. Clam chowder \n4. Crab back- only my friend ate it. \n\nSo I was hoping to give this place for 4 stars because the service was good but... it really didn't live up its hype. The seafood looks fresh but lacks the fresh taste. Oysters were quite disappointing. Clams were probably my favorite. Clam chowder was watery and salty. I didn't try crab back.  \n\nOverall, I was glad to finally check out this place and I didn't have to wait for a long time.

I waited over an hour because it was my first time and I had to try it and I admit that all the seafood was extremely fresh. The crab salad had chunks of lump crab but it was over a bed of iceberg lettuce and costs $29. The dozen oysters were $32 and the Sicilian Sashimi had a combination of 5 types of fish for around $30 as well. All dishes were made by the servers behind the counter and take time to assemble the dishes. The least appealing was the Clam Chowder. It was extremely fishy and the cream didn't combine well that it felt like the cream broke. The clam flavor wasn't also great. Regardless of the freshness, it was not worth the wait and the price. I enjoy the family feeling but for that price, I think there are better options.", "author": "Kevin L."}

They cost $14, and I got 6 of them- I thought it was a pretty good deal considering how good they were. You can have them with either their rice vinegar or the thai chili sauce, both are very good, simple choices that compliment the clams excellently.\n\nThe other dishes however were a little meh. The clam chowder was a lot more watery than most of the clam chowders I'm used to having when I'm in boston, and I'm actually a fan of the heavier kind. \n\nThe cocktail shrimp was the most... interesting by far. Typically, my understanding of cocktail shrimp is that you have 3 or 4 large shrimps hanging over a cocktail glass, with cocktail sauce on the inside for dipping. However, at Swan Oyster, they actually serve you mini shrimp which has been mixed into the cocktail sauce. It's an interesting take that i've never seen before, but I wasn't crazy about it because each shrimp was completely doused in way too much sauce, almost like a cocktail soup with shrimp mixed into it. In addition, I felt like the shrimp was too small, and struggled to taste them through the overwhelming flavor of the sauce.\n\nSo, some good, some bad. The hours here are not actually correct, but I'm not going to bother to post them because tourists will continue to be confused that way. I will have to come back to try again, but this first experience was mostly a miss.\n\nCASH ONLY", "author": "Matt L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-18", "description": "Ever since I attended school here back in 2014, I've always enjoyed SF in part due to it being one of the foodiest cities in the US. Subsequent visits post-graduation I'm always on the lookout for great food. Unfortunately as with many of the \"best\" places the Bay Area has to offer, restaurants have to be reserved at least a week in advance or longer and/or have at least 30+ minutes wait time for non-peak times. Swan Oyster Depot is of the latter but for good reason - it's considered one of the best places in the City for seafood by tourists AND locals alike.\n\nCONCEPT: Swan Oyster Depot is a SF institution. It has been in its present location since 1912 (over 100 years) and its reputation for seafood is as good as the House of Prime Rib for meat. Part of its charm is that it's family owned-operated as the staff span 3 generations. When I went in Tom and Steve as well as three of his sons were working the counter.\n\nA sign near the entrance denotes the lack of official website for the restaurant, but due to its solid reputation it hardly needs it as the people will gladly sing praises about this place.\n\nVENUE: Quite a small space with a bar seating ONLY 19 people. See the line out back? That's the reason for the line. I came here on a Monday morning at 11. Took me almost an hour wait, though a local said to me compared to some days and times, this is the closest to the ideal wait. There's hooks on the other side to hang coats and large bags.\n\nSERVICE: Maybe I sat myself a little too early as it took me a little while to be served, but the staff more than made up for it when I was finally asked what I wanted. Sorry if I broke some unwritten rule, I'll be a better person! \n\nEating here solo and not being super hungry limited my options, hence no seafood salad with their famous Louie sauce or their oysters, seafood cocktails or Dungeness crab even though it's in season as of this writing. Taking into consideration what's offered in the window, I ordered the following.\n- Cup of chowder, $3. This is actually my least favorite item because of the soup/clam ratio, which is a little on the runny side. However this can be easily overlooked because of how wonderful everything else is. Oyster crackers are offered in a communal bowl.\n- Crab back, $8. I'm a HUGE fan of crabs and when I'm served whole crab I try to eat almost anything edible. Usually the head of the crab contains the crab innards and \"fat\". They offer this here though instead the crab fat is soaked in butter. In lieu of rice I soaked that crab fat in some bread, though I can easily spoon this by itself. The only other time I can have crab fat is when my parents bring home crab to steam!\n- Small order of Sicilian sashimi. They actually have this served small, medium or large with the the difference being the amount and type of fish served. A small plate got me 12 servings of 4 fish: hamachi, salmon, ahi tuna and scallops soaked in olive oil and topped with onions and capers. This is the best sashimi I've ever consumed outside Japan. You can taste the freshness of the fish and the capers and onions add a little bite to the fish. \n- Uni, about $20. This is not usually offered, though when it is you'll see it in the window. The uni is cracked for you and served in its shell. Uni wasn't too big so I was able to squeeze this in. Before this I though I would never liked uni, but only because I never had it just cracked. The uni served here is actually quite \"meaty\" and does not have that super fishy or slimy texture I find with uni sushi/sashimi. To this date this is the ONLY place that served uni I actually liked! Maybe I'm just super particular about this shellfish.\n- Anchor Steam beer. Beer was ok though it helped wash out the fishiness aftertaste when you eat a lot of seafood in one sitting.\n\nWhen you ask for your check at the end you'll tell them what you ordered. Remember this is a CASH ONLY establishment, though there is a Chase across the street and a Wells Fargo nearby. My total came to about a little over $50.\n\nAfter eating here I can definitely justify the many accolades it gets from James Beard, Anthony Bourdain, the Eater 38 and Bauer's SF 100 list. Even the No1DP was jealous of me eating here and this is considering he lives in Japan, where good seafood can easily be found. I will consider this one of my fond moments of eating seafood, and I look forward to eating here again, either solo or with friends who are willing to wait in line for a good meal!", "author": "Isabella B."}

The rating of this place will be highly subjective based on your own preferences. Its not the kind of place I think everyone can go and have the same amazing experience, so I caution you to read the below and see if it hits your preference set.\n\n1 - the line can be an enormous chore. I came in when it wasn't super super busy and it still turned into a 1.5 hour wait in the sun. For some - that's no big deal. For me(Who was super hungry) it was. But I was determined to visit this iconic place so I stayed the course. Knowing what I know now, I would have grabbed a slice of pizza.\n\n2 - its pricier than you think. Remember, its seafood and not nearly as filling as a steak. Yes, you can gorge yourself on the bread if you like to make up the difference, but at least be upfront in knowing that its quite expensive to fill yourself on actual seafood. I ended up spending 60 bucks to get moderately full(and I am not a massive eater - I did avoid most of the bread). \n\n3- It only accepts cash. Meh, this one I came prepared for.\n\n4 - I did not order the one thing everyone comes for - Oysters. I had just come from Washington and gorged myself on oysters before so I decided to skip it. Probably a dumb idea given I was going to review the restaurant, but whatever - if you are in the mood for oysters, ignore the rest of the review. \n\n\n5 - they are pretty stripped down in what they offer. Fresh seafood, particularly shellfish, with no frills. I find this charming in a way. You want fresh crab? Its there. You want fresh scallops or clams? Yep, there too. Absolutely peak seafood ingredients with really nothing much else besides a few garnishes, some delicious louis sauce, and little else. If you order the crab, its a bit messy but that comes with the territory. I ordered a scallop carpaccio dish. It was really good. The scallops were very fresh, but I wish they had paired it with a nice vinaigrette to bring out some more interesting flavors. The crab back was just ok. When I've made crab back, its usually with hot cooked crab. This was just lukewarm. Ok I suppose. Not terrible. \n\n6 - Servers and staff were charming and it has a very lively feel. Definitely brings out the iconic history of SF and the restaurant.\n\nOverall, a good place. I think in a vacuum, I would come here again but the prospect of the wait, cash requirements and general cost puts it right on the edge.", "author": "Ajit K."}

We arrived at the place at 11:04, which was 30 mins after they open, yet we saw a long line of people queuing in front of the store. This place is an extremely small oyster bar with only 19 seats at the bar, with no table. We waited in line for 1.5 hours to finally get seated, at this point I truly hoped the food worth the wait otherwise I would be so pissed. \nThey brought us some sour dough with butter before taking order, which is great as we were super hungry after 1.5 hours waiting in line.  We ordered a clam chowder, an octopus salad ($14, came in a small glass), half a dozen mixed oyster ($16), a combination seafood cocktail ($15, shrimp, prawn, crab meat), and a large combination sashimi tray (tuna, hamachi, scallop, sardine, and salmon, 6 slices each, forgot the price). Octopus salad was mediocre, mostly because they came with chopped celery, which I can't eat, but squeezed in a couple of lemon slices and it tasted much better. The sashimi was amazing, I love sardine, tuna, and Hamachi. Scallops weren't that good tho, coz its texture was kinda like butter, while i expected it to be chewy. The seafood cocktail tasted good too. The best part is the oyster, very fresh and tasty. I squeezed lemon, hot sauce (their hot sauce is bomb, trust me), and a bit of cocktail sauce, and sucked the whole thing. Seriously, this place served the best oysters I've ever had. The only negative point is the clam chowder. It had a really strong taste of clam, which left you a bitter after taste, yet they cut up the clam extremely tiny, I couldn't find any pieces of clam big enough to enjoy its chewy texture.

Not sarcastically, but sincerely trying to help. She said its not the same and walked out. Really? So set your expectations accordingly and you will not be disappointed. \n\nOysters were super fresh and tasty. The Thai hot sauce on the bar added a great kick.

My boyfriend and I arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday, and we still waited nearly 2 hours. I was pretty hangry by the time I got to the front, but as you can probably tell from my 4 stars, the food made it difficult to stay unhappy (though by no means would I ever go back again on a weekend).\n\nWith the amount of time we waited, we knew exactly what we wanted to order and were ready to feast by the time we sat down:\n\n- Half dozen oysters: We had 3 different varieties. I know one type was from Tomales Bay, but I don't remember the others. Doesn't matter though because they were all AMAZING. Some of the best oysters I've had in SF, by far.\n\n- Large Sicilian sashimi: This was the most expensive dish ($32), but I thought it was well worth it. The red onions, capers, and olive oil was unique but complimented the fish really nicely. And all the fish (ahi tuna, salmon, scallops, & yellowtail) was very fresh.\n\n- Combination cocktail: Came with crab, shrimp, prawn, and oysters. I recommend putting some of the crab into the crab back and eating it with the bread!\n\n- Crab back: For $6, you get all the delicious soupy guts and fat from the crab, served up with bread to soak it all up. Important to note that it's cold, but it still tastes great.\n\n- Combination seafood salad: This was kind of an attempt to get some fiber in our meal, but we were impressed with the large amount of seafood that came with it. Included shrimp, prawns, crab, and crawfish. Highly recommend getting it with the louie dressing.\n\n- Uni: I know they don't always have this, so we were lucky! Not the best uni I've had (Hokkaido uni lovers, you know what I'm talking about), but super fresh and rich.\n\nHard to pick one favorite because all of them were so good, but the oysters and sashimi were probably the most memorable for me, if I had to pick.

We ordered crab back, a dozen assorted raw oysters, combo salad, shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail, and a full order of smoked salmon. All the food items were really good, even the crab back. This was my first time trying it and it didn't taste as strong as I thought it would. It was buttery.

We are definitely coming back to this spot next time we go to San Francisco! \n\nWe waited around 2 hours in line to get in as it is such a tiny place but to be honest the wait was so worth it! The food was amazing! We ordered the sampler oysters as we wanted to try different kinds and our favorite ones were the ones from Baja, so we ordered some more of those! They also have champagne if you wanna go the extra mile!\n\nWe also got clam chowder and sea urchin. It's so interesting to see how they open the sea urchin since hey cut it in front of you!

That turned out to be about an hour on a Monday afternoon I happened to have off from work. \n\nI wanted the crab back but they wouldn't serve it this day unless I ordered the whole crab. They didn't say this until after I'd ordered it and six cherry stone clams. I ended up getting an order of the sliced scallops in olive oil instead. The scallops were incredible so I had a second order. Probably too much.\n\nWhen it was time to settle they just scribbled some numbers on a napkin which added up to $61.  I was surprised by that amount. They had to consult two different guys at that point, and then decided that it was really $48.  \n\nIt was exceptional in terms of quality but still a bit pricey.  It was a big splurge by my standards. \n\nI got the impression that most of the people eating here were tourists or business travelers.\n\nIt may be many years before I return.

When looking at reviews, it's quite difficult to build certain expectations in your mind.  Swan Oyster meets them all.  We tried the Sicilian sashimi plate with scallop, tuna, and salmon. They provided wasabi and soy sauce on the side in case you need a little kick.  We also had smoked salmon on sour dough bread (I think).  It was the most perfect way to have lox.  I have never and will never have lox this good again.  I squeezed a bit of lemon on the salmon but it totally did not need it.  Every bit just melts in your mouth.  If it weren't for a local that persuaded us to try it, it would have been a lost opportunity.

Sadly, service is worth just as much as the quality and flavor of the food.\n\nWe arrived 40 mins before they closed and there were 3 stools available (enough for our party) but 3 of their employees repeatedly kept informing us with a rude tone that the bar was closed for seating and they were only available for taking orders.\n\nOk, so we were fine with taking our food to-go but no need for the attitude! Additionally, we noticed how the employees were practicing UNSANITARY methods of handling food. From touching money and the grabbing seafood from their ice tray in the front of the store with their BARE HANDS! Gross. \n\nThank you but I will take my money and appetite somewhere else. The chowder wasn't very good either (was curdling) & the uni had a very off-putting bitter flavor. As for the seafood combo cocktail, it had a fishy flavor that I wasn't fond of. Good waste of $50.

Clam chowder- very different then your typical chowder. I wouldn't say it bad or good. Just ok. Very watery and strong clam broth taste.\n3. 1/2 dozen cherry stone clams & 1/2 dozen oysters. Both were very fresh but nothing too special than any other fresh oyster spot.\n 4. Fresh live sea urchin - actually had a fishy taste at the end. I've had much better quality elsewhere \n5.

Finally, a staycation, and I manage to beat the line on a Friday morning! I recommend visiting on a non-Friday weekday to avoid any wait. We still had to wait around an hour to get seated, and we got there before opening. There was already a line, so we missed the first seating batch. The hack for locals though: order ahead and make a to-go order. You can skip the line!\n\nIn terms of the food and service, it was a 5 star experience. The reason I am knocking one star off was the wait. What to order?? The question is what NOT to order. Here is what we ordered:\n\n- House Wine: Cuz WINE not, recommend it if you like your white wine with your seafood. $9 a glass.\n- Crab back: Yes. Just yes. It was my husband's favorite! I grew up in Maryland with blue crabs, and was not a fan of it. But this was delicioussss. Something about the creamy deliciousness that dungeness crab backs offer. Definitely use the bread to sop up it all up.\n- Combo salad: Both crab and shrimp on a bed of shredded lettuce. Option to dress with either a Crab Louie (cream based) sauce or lemon/olive oil.\n- Sicilian sashimi: My favorite! So light, so delicate, yet filling! The main star of this dish was the fish, not a lot of distracting sauces and toppings to take away from it.\n- Uni (sea urchin): My second favorite! Not for the faint of heart. If you don't like uni, don't bother. This is the purest form of it. We saw a group order one and ate two bites before giving up on its weirdness. If you love it, definitely order it. Lots of sea urchin come in that bad boy.\n\nOverall, would recommend the Sicilian sashimi, uni, and crab back. Everything was delicious, but those were the standout dishes.

He kept saying amazing things about it and said it was a must if you're in San Fran - you know, the typical spiel. But he usually easily convinces me and whenever I watch his show about destinations I'll be going to, I always make a note to check out those places.\n\nSo my friend and I (more so me), decided to get some oysters here during our weekend trip to the City by the Bay. We first went on a Sunday afternoon, not knowing that it was closed on Sundays. But that's on me. I knew they closed at 5 pm in general, I just didn't know they weren't open everyday. Maybe that was a warning sign of what a bad experience it would be. But alas, this premonition was no match for our persistence, for we trekked all the way back there again on Monday.\n\nThe place is just one long bar, that fits probably 20 people. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. Once we were, it did take a bit of time for them to clean up our area. We ordered the crab back, half a dozen oysters, and half a dozen clams. The crab back (which was GREAT) and the oysters came out quickly, but our clams were nowhere to be found. It must have gotten lost with our server because he too was nowhere to be found. After we got our crab back and oysters, he never came back to check on us. It seems he was too busy on the other end, shucking clams for everybody but us. When we were finally able to flag down a different server, we just asked for the check because we were already in a rush, after waiting 20 minutes for our non-existent clams.\n\nI guess that saying rings true - \"Fool me once, shame on you.

I mean that in so many ways, because it's not just the fresh seafood, but also the ambiance and the service. I've been here for weekend brunch numerous times and it's been universally excellent.\n\nThe food of course is the big draw, as it should be. They serve fresh seafood here and it rivals any sushi spot in the city as far as quality goes. I'm a raw fish fan, and I've literally never had a single piece of fish here that wasn't high quality.\n\nOysters and clams on the half-shell are always a solid bet, but more than that I would also recommend trying the various fish and crab dishes too. When I've gotten fish, they slice it sort of like sashimi, but with more European-American toppings like olive oil and capers. It's cool to me to see something that I typically look at as Japanese being done through the lens of a different culture.\n\nThe ambiance here is also a big draw, as the decor is pleasantly kitschy but not overdone. There's a nautical/seafood theme which matches the food perfectly. I also like that despite the restaurant being pretty tiny, it's fun to be in and the noise level is lively but not cacophonous. I will say, the chairs are not super comfortable, but maybe that's their subtle way of saying \"hey there's like 50 people who want your seat, don't just sit around after you eat\".\n\nFinally, the service. The people who run Swan Oyster Depot clearly care about their customers, and it shows in a number of ways. First, they take pride in keeping the line managed and pleasant, which is nice considering Polk street in the morning is a little nasty. From giving Anchor Steam to people waiting for a table to cleaning the sidewalk to shooing off panhandlers, the guys running this establishment don't just treat the customers inside well, they take care of the ones waiting too.\n\nInside the great service continues. The guys behind the counter are energetic, happy to talk, and full of great recommendations. If you aren't sure what to order they are happy to explain your options and they've never led me astray.\n\nTo reiterate, this place is amazing. Yes it's too small to meet the demand, and yes I often spend $60/person here. But it's still amazing and a real San Francisco culinary landmark, and everyone should go at least once if not every week.

The next day (Saturday) we arrived at 9:45 AM to find 20 people already in line!!! When they opened the first wave settled in and we then stood and waited while they ate before a spot would open up. Overall we waited nearly 2 hours before sitting down. Luckily they were serving beers to the people in the front of the line, total lifesaver.\n\nOnce you get inside you realize how tight it is in there. You're literally rubbing elbows with the people sitting next to you. Our server was a younger guy that was truly awesome. We order 1.5 dozen of mixed oysters, 2 cups of clam chowder, 1 octopus salad, and 1 prawn cocktail plus we had 2 beers and 2 bloody beers (like micheladas). The service again was fantastic, they were friendly and they took the time to explain what you were eating. The food itself was very fresh but I'd have to say a little underwhelming and it failed to live up to the (possibly unfairly high) expectations.

We spent our 20-minute wait doing what passersby do -- ogling the window display of their daily offerings. \n\nThis Polk Street eatery has 20 coveted counter seats, putting you in the thick of all the action: smoked salmon being sliced off the skin in front of you; sea urchin expertly cleaned & prepped; five workers constantly hustling to deliver orders & checking to make sure \"you're all set.\" \n\nWe ordered crab and prawn cocktails, both fresh & plump but also both lacking a sweetness I've come to expect of San Francisco seafood. Disappointed that their clam chowder had a watery consistency; creamy butteriness was non existent. Smoked salmon was no better, no worse than any other place. Absolutely middle of the road (though their sourdough, which comes from Boudin, is phenomenal.) $58 (not including tip) for the meal & two sodas. Cash only. \n\nSwan Oyster Depot has that old school charm that SF restaurants over a certain age possess; plus they've got Anthony Bourdain's endorsement which is no small feat.

In order to not wait 1-2 hours, you literally have to eat raw seafood at 10:30am....not the worst thing ever, but still a little too early for my taste. I just really hate waiting and in SF, you wait for everything.\n\nThey open at 10:30am and my bf and I got there at 10am. There was no one lined up outside yet, so we were the first ones there, but literally ~2 minutes later....BAM.....the line begins and does not end. I feel bad for the folks that just miss the first seating (18 stools in the restaurant only) because if you miss the first seating, you'll wait at least 45 minutes until people finish up / pay / leave. I liked being the first ones in because you sit near the end where all the shucking and sashimi cutting action is!\n\nI love the family feel you get from everyone working. They joke with each other and you see them constantly laughing. They really treat the folks eating like family as well. Although there is a long line, they never rush you and actually told me to take my time finishing up my beer before leaving. One thing to note, if you're a germaphobe then you might get a little grossed out that they handle things there with their bare hands.\n\nFood:\n- Oysters: get the combo so you can try them all....the blue points are creamy deliciousness and kumamoto oysters are always a fan fave. They had 2 different kumamoto's in the combo platter and one was so small and cute.\n- Uni: oh man.....this was like heaven.....\n- Crab Cocktail: they give you large chunks of crab!\n- Scallops in Ponzu: this was one of my fave things we ordered....it was light and fresh and oh so delish :)\n- Smoke Salmon (cold): GET THIS!!! We really weren't going to get this because 1. we were stuffed and 2. smoked salmon is whatevers to me, but a local stopping in to say hi to everyone working told us that if we went to Swan Oyster and didn't get the smoked salmon, then we didn't get the whole Swan Oyster experience. I am SO GLAD we listened because it was REALLY good. We got a small plate and contemplated getting a half order on top of that because it was THAT good, but we were so stuffed.\n\nTIP(S): Call at 10am and place a take-out order!

Came on a random Tuesday, about 30 minutes before opening, and there was already a line. Thankfully, I was able to make it inside for the first wave. There's only a row of seats at the counter, which made it a little cramped, but it's all worth it for the product, and that product is delicious seafood.\n\nOrdered a bunch of stuff including the crab back, a small sashimi, and the crab salad. The crab back was really interesting, because I initially assumed that it would be served hot, but was actually served cold. However, if you dip a bunch of bread into that stuff, there's not much better than that salty, rich, and slightly fishy taste. Not to mention, it's pretty cheap at $6. The crab salad was really great, despite consisting mostly of a pile of iceberg lettuce. However, the dressing it came with was delicious, and they really do load up the crab in the salad. The sashimi included hamachi, salmon, and tuna, which all were great with the olive oil and capers. \n\nI really enjoyed the old-school vibe here. No website, no frills, just good, clean flavors. The people behind the counter are very knowledgeable and patient. The value is pretty solid for fresh seafood, so while you may spend a lot (our bill was about $80 for lunch), you know you're getting some of the best stuff around.\n\nWill be back for sure for their other dishes, just gotta find a time when I have enough free time to get there early enough. The quality speaks for itself, and while you might be a bit miffed at the wait, it'll all melt away once you get your hands on that seafood.", "author": "Eric J."}

We weren't sure if they pool tips but ended up asking him a few things and he was terrific and we had a great conversation when we were checking out with him. \nThere was no one working the door yesterday like in prior visits so we saw individual stools remain empty since no one was at the door shouting out available seats.

The gentlemen behind the counter had us pick the trio of fish, and he did the rest. There were many offerings of oysters, all with unique flavor profiles. The crab salad was also a star; the workers crack the crab right in front of you to assemble. I admittedly shied away from the crab back, only because its served cold (as is everything else), but for me, I like my fat hot. \n\nOh, they also have uni by the boatload.

We ordered a bottle of chardonnay for $36 (retail $11 according to google), which was probably my favorite part of the meal. We then each got a cup of clam chowder with bread that was very average. Following the soup, we got a dozen oysters ($36), which were beyond sub-par compared to paying the same amount at Hog Island. We then went on to get a combination cocktail, which was pretty much your neighborhood grocery store's cocktail sauce smothered over a tiny serving of mini shrimp, 1 large shrimp, 2 raw oysters, and a sprinkle of crab. Following this dish we got the sashimi platter (unknown price), which was fish smothered in oil and capers --- effectively ruining the taste of the fish (unless it was already bad, at which case maybe helping its case). Finally, I saw everyone getting the sea urchin, and was feeling rather adventurous, so we got the sea urchin. I have tried uni 3 times in my life, so I am far from an expert. The first time I found it ok, the second time I absolutely loved it, and this time I barley was able to swallow it.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were ringed up $140.

This last trip, it was off, and not as flavorful. I'm giving them a pass because it was only this one time, and maybe someone was just light on the salt when preparing it or something. But definitely get it. It's so tasty. \n\nCrab salad: Basically just lumps and lumps of glorious crab on a bed of fresh lettuce. Like I said, this isn't where you come for gimmicks or fancy sauces. They aren't trying to hide the seafood. The crab is the star of the show, and they let it shine. \n\nSeafood cocktail: If you love all seafood, and this is your first visit, I highly suggest getting this, because you get a little taste of everything. Crab, oyster, prawns, shrimp, and I think a mussel. Like a sampler platter of almost everything they have\n\nCrab back/fat: I finally decided to try this the last time I went, and I honestly couldn't decide whether I really liked it or just kind of liked it. First, I thought it was served warm, but it's cold. I'm not a fan of cold soups, and this reminded me of soup. However, dipping the fabulous bread into it takes it to an interesting level that I really liked. But without bread, I wouldn't want to spoon that into my mouth like a soup. Maybe you aren't even supposed to. I don't know. But I would say this definitely is not a dish for the squeamish. I will say that I dipped the lumps of crab meat from my seafood cocktail into the crab fat, and THAT was genius, if I do say so myself!\n\nMussels: Fresh, perfect.\n\nThe service is cool there, the guys behind the counter are all really nice and upbeat. They remind me of east coast people, I don't know why... maybe it's their no non-sense ways. Watching them joke around with each other and hustle back there is fun to watch.\n\nI don't need to encourage you to go to Swan Oyster Depot, the place speaks for itself!", "author": "Liz M."}

Other than that the service is amazing, the food is great, and the options are numerous! The clam chowder followed by a crab back order is the way to go, to get the best they have and at a good price. Worth the visit if you're in San Francisco.", "author": "Lidia D."}

Good brunch/lunch spot?\n\nSwan Oyster Depot was everything the reviews said it would be and more! When I went I was hungover, so unfortunately didn't eat that much.\n\nBetween two people:\nsplit a dozen mixed oysters: an oyster flight, basically, it  cool that you got 6 different kinds of oysters (2 of each) and you could compare and contrast; so fresh & delicious\nbowl of clam chowder: seemingly grainy (would not describe as creamy or thick) consistency, but so so delicious; the clam flavor is strong and i really enjoyed the soup!\ncombination cocktail: we wanted to try everything, but my bf and i kinda didn't like some of the things included (mussels/clams), so next time we'll probably opt for just a shrimp (SO FRESH & DELICIOUS) or crab cocktail\nbread + butter: just okay\n\nYa, I described the food as 'delicious' too many times in this review, but this place is legit. Really want to come back and try other items on the menu!\n\nSide note: got there around 10AM on a Saturday, they opened 15 minutes early, and we waited about an hour to be seated. imho worth the wait and worth coming before opening time to be in the first batch of the seated", "author": "Mimi T."}

That said - one experience waiting 1.5 hours in line (and this is after arriving 30 min prior to opening on a weekday!) was enough for me.\n\nHighlights: \n--Crab salad - SO much fresh Dungeness crab meat topped on a pile of shredded iceberg lettuce and special Louie dressing.  \n-- Oysters - so fresh! Especially loved the Kumamoto - SO good. \n-- Sicilian Sashimi - delicious slices of fresh scallops, tuna and salmon topped with olive oil and capers.\n\nSo impressed with the service once we were finally seated - our guy remembered our order without taking any notes.

The entire experience should be considered a \"bucket list\" item on all levels - check this one off and now anyplace I go for seafood will never measure up to this gem.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-29", "description": "Swan Oyster Depot is a seafood bar that has been featured on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown. It's located in Nob Hill in San Francisco and is a tiny little restaurant marked unobtrusively by a blue awning outside and more conspicuously, by the long line of people waiting outside. \n\n   Once seated, you'll quickly realize that Swan Oyster Depot is a very special and unique Bay Area establishment.. Everyone working there is a complete character and  all incredibly warm and inviting. The best way we can describe what it feels like in Swan Oyster Depot is feeling like you're in your uncle's garage that got transformed into an oyster bar with all your uncles and cousins just hanging out, jammin' out to 50s surf rock and preparing you a feast.  It's organized chaos behind the bar--all you see are orange t-shirts weaving in and around each other, never missing a beat of refilling drinks or asking customers what else they need. \n\n   We started off with a cup of clam chowder. When in the bay, you must indulge yourself in some clam chowder, always.  The chowder at Swan Oyster Depot is very special. It isn't very thick and is more on the soupy-side. The cream wasn't overpowering at all, which allows the fresh clam flavor to come through with each spoonful. Of course, we had to throw in some oyster crackers from the giant communal bowl placed in front of us. No clam chowder is complete without a spoon full of those bad boys! The cup of clam chowder was the perfect start to the decadence we were about to experience.\n\n   Next, we had a combo platter of two-dozen oysters. Every single oyster was so delicious and the flavors were so distinctly different. Some sweet, some more buttery and some more ocean-y. Each one was so delightfully fresh and didn't have that overpowering salty and sandy, gritty taste and texture. These oysters were so delicate in their flavor and with each slurp of the oyster, we were greeted by the slightest hint of that yummy ocean flavor. We mostly stuck with lemon and Tabasco  for our condiments, but mignonette sauce and their house-made hot sauce are also available to top your oysters with. \n\n   Next up was the Sea Urchin. It's no surprise that Boss and Boss are huge fans of Uni, so naturally, when we saw a few Sea Urchins just chillin on top of ice in the storefront, we knew what we had to do. Everytime we've had Uni, it's always been at a sushi restaurant. This time was our first time having Uni prepared in a non-Japanese style. When they brought the Sea Urchin out, it came in it's own shell. It was a very impressive way of plating the uni, but on top of that, it was so fascinating to look at because each of the spines on the Sea Urchin shell were still moving and doing a little dance. The taste of the uni was very interesting because we're used to that oceany taste which we love in Uni. However, this Sea Urchin didn't have that oceany flavor but it still retained that buttery texture that we all love so much. We still loved it, but it had us scratching our heads.\n\n   The shrimp cocktail was next. It was no surprise that this was just as amazing as the rest of our meal. The prawns were very fresh and very meaty. The shrimp cocktail sauce was also very tasty and with some added freshly grated horseradish, it was heavenly.   when you add some of their horseradish in there, it adds that extra kick. \n\n   As if we hadn't eaten enough, we ordered their Sicilian Sashimi. It was an assortment of Yellowtail, Salmon, Tuna, Mackerel, and Scallop splashed with olive oil and topped with capers and finely diced red onion. The dish was tasty, but being two sushi lovers, we felt that perhaps the olive oil, capers and onion distracted from the taste of the fish. Tasty, but would probably explore the other items on their menu before ordering this again. If you are, however, interested in trying out this menu item, be sure to ask for it because it doesn't make an appearance on their menu board.\n\n   We ended our lunch with their infamous Crab Back. It's the shell of the crab, cracked away from the body while retaining that \"crab butter\" and fat that is so often neglected. The taste of the crab butter is... well, buttery, and oh-so-delicious. It's a little jarring at first when you dip your bread into it, because you'd expect the juices to be warm but they are in fact cold. Once you get past that, it's a super tasty end of the meal treat and a perfect use of the sourdough loaf you're served at the beginning of your meal. \n\n   This lunch was one of the most decadent lunches that we've ever had. Everything we ordered was so amazing and the oysters blew us away. The lunch itself was not for the faint of heart, as it put us back three bones. So if you're down to ball out, this is the place to do it. Anthony Bourdain once said about eating at Swan Oyster Depot, \"If I read about myself dying at this counter, I'd say to myself, 'that was one lucky guy.'\" We finally understand what he meant and agree wholeheartedly.", "author": "Boss And Boss E."}

The second one I ate was bad and I had to immediately spit it out. The clam chowder was super watery and separated, I had one bite and threw it away ( tasted sour).

It's fresh, and really, really expensive. I'm not an oyster person, so I opted out of the oysters, but my group thought they were delicious. The combination salad was alright, but honestly, it was alot of filler, unremarkable lettuce. The best thing I tried here was the scallop sashimi. I never had it before, but boy was it good. It was so soft, tender, and melted in your mouth. Definitely a must get. I also tried a bit of the smoked salmon, and it was really, really good as well.", "author": "Ke C."}

Waited about an hour and 15 mins and had it not been freezing, it wasn't that bad.

No shame, I had walked into a small Mexican joint earlier to warm up thinking I would get a small snack and walked out with a forearm sized burrito. The owner said she hasn't been open 30 years because the food sucked and I figured, she had a point.\n\nBy the time we made our way into our seats, I was ready for some seafood.

No website, no menus online, no credit cards, no reservations.\n\nI was excited to try this place ever since I moved to Russian hill. I've been keeping an eye out for sea urchin for a while. I called about it and it turns out they're caught fresh at half moon bay. Some days they have it, some days they don't. \n\nTo be honest, I enjoyed some of the food here. \n\nHowever, I'm extremely displeased with their service and shady way of doing business. \n\nI arrived around 10:20 after calling in about the sea urchin, the employee on the phone said as long as I get there before 10:30 there shouldn't be a wait. LIES. I waited about 40 minutes. \n\nThe place is pretty cramped and the service is painfully slow. It'll be fast if you're a charismatic single girl or if you somehow know the people who work there.\n\nThe place is certainly a hole in a wall, but the prices are definitely not hole in a wall prices. \n\nWe shared two live sea urchins, a crab cocktail, prawn cocktail and the Italian sashimi platter.\n\nThe cocktails were pretty tiny and the prawns only came with 6 pieces for $14. \n\nThe Italian sashimi platter was interesting but I prefer Japanese sashimi. The hamachi and yellowtail was too briny for me and the fish wasn't the best quality, it tasted cheap. This was also an off menu item so the price wasn't listed. \n\nThe live sea urchin was the best dish out of all, I've never had live fresh sea urchin before so this was quite an experience to say the least. The shell was still moving. The shucking wasn't consistent though. The first one was shucked quite well without any guts or gunk on the sea urchin but the second one had all this black gunk which I had to clean out myself in order to eat it. \n\nNow on to the shady and shitty service. \n\nOur waters were never filled. We had to ask for more water a few times.\n\nHe forgot our second order of sea urchin. We had to remind him for another order of sea urchin. \n\nHe did a poor job cleaning the second sea urchin. \nEach order apparently comes with bread but we only got one order of bread.\n\nIt took forever to get the bill and he got someone else's bill first even though we asked before them. \n\nSo what was the last straw? Our bill was miscalculated by $17 - $24. \n\nThere was a party next to us where he kept flirting with the girl. They just met and she was eating lunch with her mom. She apparently went to the same highschool as our server in Oakland. They chatted up and got pretty cozy talking about underground clubs. Our server was WAY more friendly with her than he was with us. He gave her two free pieces of sashimi. He offered her more bread, kept their waters filled and asked her if she wanted more beer. On top of that, he brought out their bill first even though we asked for ours first and she was seated after we were midway through our meal yet she left before our bill even came. The billing system here is a complete scam. There's no transparency and sometimes verbally expressed with or without paperwork. I thought it was really strange when her bill was $66 yet she had a combination salad, two soups, a beer, a crab back and a dozen oysters. Just judging from the menu alone her bill was basically granted a 30% - 40% discount. \n\nBut when we got our bill it was $134.. I had a feeling it was off but I gave them benefit of the doubt as I had already spent over 2 hours there including the wait and I had to leave. After I left I thought about it and realized it was definitely way off. I called back to clarify the prices and I was right - they padded our bill. Probably to cover the girl's discounted bill. \n\nIt all made sense now. They exchanged numbers before she left and he gave her a bunch of postcards. What a scummy way of doing business huh? \n\nIt's unfortunate not everyone is treated the same. Unless you know the employees here, forget about eating here without being robbed. \n\nOn the bright side I hope I saved another poor soul from getting ripped off the way I did.\n\nTLDR- avoid unless you like getting scammed for mostly overpriced seafood", "author": "Virginia Y."}

We got here shortly after and the line was already eight people deep. We finally got in and immediately ordered shrimp cocktail, clams and oysters on the half-shell, and a combination seafood salad. \n\nThe shrimp cocktail served here looks basic and not fancy at all, but it was delicious. This small bowl was overflowing with insanely fresh tasting shrimp and showered in tangy cocktail sauce that will get your palate ready for the seafood assault that's coming your way. The oysters and clams come freshly opened and with a brief description of their points of origin. Some of these came from Mexico and others from the surrounding area; I honestly can't remember because I was hypnotized by the creaminess and sweetness of these ocean floor delicacies.The only thing that was off-putting was the shucker's fingernails, while he pointed and described the tray of food, we could both see that they were brown and black, pretty gross. \n\nThe combination salad is a mountain of crab, lobster, shrimp, and prawns. This is a gluttonous amount of fresh seafood, and I wouldn't have it any other way. All this is covered in a mystery dressing, thousand island?,  that I could have done without. I mean the seafood alone is super fresh, and a little hot sauce and lemon juice would have been much better that the thick mayonnaise based topping. \n\nThis place is a little pricey, and they are a cash only business so make sure to hit up the ATM before coming in.", "author": "Nate M."}

My husband and I came here at noon on a Thursday and only waited about 10 minutes. Once seated, one of the friendly owners or younger guys greet you and are happy to answer any questions about the menu. Here's what we got:\n\nDozen mixed oysters (Kumamoto, Miyagi, Blue Point,):\nThese were all big, meaty and sweet oysters that are shucked well. I didn't find a single piece of broken shell in any of the oysters, and the classic mignonette sauce paired perfectly with each one. \n\nCrab salad:\nLiterally a pile of crab meat on top of a pile of lettuce. Squeeze some lemon juice on top and spread some Louie sauce over the plate and you'll find yourself delighted with this light, yet largely portioned plate.\n\nClam chowder:\nProbably one of the best bowls of clam chowder I've had! While I didn't think there was enough clam meat in the bowl, it was rich, creamy and tasted so good with some Boudin bread. \n\nSea urchin:\nThese were from Half Moon Bay, which weren't as buttery and sweet tasting as those from Santa Barbara. However, the meat is large and plentiful in each one. \n\nSmoked salmon:\nWe sat right in front of a large piece of smoked salmon but didn't order any. However, one of the owners sliced off small pieces and handed them to us to try. OMFG. I regretted not ordering it. It is insanely delicious, buttery, smokey, and melt-in-your-mouth goodness that blew my mind. We both couldn't stop dreaming about it the rest of the day and decided that we should return to order some, which is thinly sliced and served on slices of Boudin bread. \n\nAll of the employees and two owners are so incredibly friendly, upbeat, and happy to serve you. Customer service here is outstanding, which I find so rare in older establishments that refuse to expand, add more seats or upgrade in anyway. Aside from that, the seafood they select is sublime, and the way they prepare every plate is wonderful.", "author": "Nina V."}

We waited about half an hour to get in (not bad) and when we sat down, we ordered as many oysters as we could afford. It's cash only, and we only had $50 to spend between the two of us, so we were budgeting. The staff weren't particularly helpful or friendly in helping us decide what to order, which is fine - it's a blue collar counter joint. I thought it was kind of weird that our server told us a long story about Oklahoma in a fake southern accent (we're from Texas but he didn't know that) and that he stuck his finger in our oyster to pick out a piece of shell, but so it goes. The oysters were pretty tasty, but they definitely weren't the best I've had or the most reasonably priced.", "author": "Lauren A."}

We got there at 10:30 when they opened on a Monday and waited about an hour and half (the line got longer when we left).  The Restaurant is small, all the seating is along the counter/bar.  The customer service is amazing; all the guys were attentive and helpful.  Despite the long line outside, they don't rush you at all.  Very causal atmosphere.\n\nThe food...  everything was very fresh!  We got clam chowder, combination seafood salad, combo seafood cocktail, smoked salmon, and sashimi plate.  The seafood salad was amazing!!  So much fresh crab meat, bay shrimp and a few good size shrimp; as far as I am concerned, this is the best deal and a must!  For the seafood cocktail, you get a little bowl of crab, shrimp w an oyster on top and you get a little bowl of cocktail sauce which you season to your liking and dip the seafood in.  The smoked salmon plate was very good, just seemed a little over-priced for four slices of bread w single layer of smoked salmon on top.  I am glad we tried their mixed sashimi plate; loved the olive oil and the capers.  But if you have a good sushi place....  I wasn't too impressed w the clam chowder.  It was flavorful and wasn't full of big chunks of vegetables which I can't stand, clam pieces were small and hard to find, but it was a bit running and oily on top (I don't know if the soup was cooked too hot where the oil and milk solid separated or they splashed oil on top?). Good cheap filler food for kids.\n\nIt was a wonderful meal!!  We will definitely come back!!  Get there early, be prepared to wait at least an hour, but it's totally worth it !!!  Oh, they do take-out!!  The line for takeout is on the left side of the door and very short!\n\nThey do not have a website!!!  The one listed on Yelp is not theirs!!!", "author": "Kathy H."}

The food is fresh and nothing was bad, I just expected something a little more considering the hype. \n\nWe shared the small Sicilian sashimi, cup of clam chowder, 6 raw oysters, and crab salad. The star of the meal was definitely the oysters. They were meaty and tasted very fresh. The crab salad had a generous amount of crab in the plate, however, the dish got a little old very fast. It's a lot of crab with a little bit of sauce to give it some flavor. Would recommend sharing the salad for sure! The Sicilian sashimi was thinly sliced and smaller than anticipated but it's fresh and topped with oil and capers. It's a different style of raw fish than what I'm used to but I think I prefer Japanese sashimi instead. The clam chowder was strangely liquidy and tasted more like clam broth.

Even though the seating arrangement is very cramped, the food and the service here were unbelievable, and the experience was totally worth the wait!\n\nLet's start with the service--all of the servers here were so genuinely kind and helpful when we made our selections. They were extremely attentive and made sure we always had everything we needed--starting, of course, with plenty of bread and butter. And then there's the food. Our group started with a dozen oysters (coming from Washington, British Columbia, and California)--on the side were the typical lemon and horseradish, but also a delicious spicy Thai chili sauce that was so hot and unique. These were literally the best oysters I've had in my life--they were so fresh and complex in flavor (not just salty brine).\n\nAnd then came my favorite dish of all: the smoked salmon, which was served over slices of bread and topped with capers and onions. The smoked salmon was savory, smokey, and, by far, the creamiest smoked salmon I've had in my life--this dish was literally to die for! We also had the combination Louie salad, which included plenty of cooked seafood like crab and shrimp over a bed of simple lettuce and a creamy dressing. While the seafood was good, I didn't find this dish wasn't all that flavorful or special. We also had the calamari salad, which was a small dish of cooked calamari along with simple onions and garnish, but this also wasn't all that memorable.\n\nWe ended with an order of the large Sicilian sashimi platter, which came with raw slices of salmon, scallops, ahi tuna, yellowtail, among some other fish I can't remember--everything was dressed in plenty of olive oil and topped with capers and onions. This dish had plenty of great flavorful (and again, the seafood was so fresh!), and the remaining olive oil on the plate was perfect for dipping with the bread!", "author": "David K."}

The line was long but it was expected, we knew ahead of time it would be. It took them a long time to take our order but we figured how busy it was it was to be expected. People who were seated after us got their food first even though it was the same thing we ordered, clam chowder, so it couldn't have taken longer to prepare ours. The clam chowder had a watery consistency and the taste was pretty bland. We ordered oysters and we saw them open them and then saw them flicking the juices off their hands right on top of the oysters. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good. When we were ready to leave we asked for the check. We waited 20 min and no one brought us a check. We had to ask for a check 3 times and waited a total of 40 minutes before they brought us one.

As expected on a Saturday, there was a short line that we reached the front of after about a 30 minute wait.\n\nIt was well worth it. As soon as two patrons got up from the counter, one of the guys motioned for us to come sit. I had a Coke in my hand that I bought from Walgreen's across the street (because they only offered Pepsi which I'm firmly against), and he immediately asked if I wanted a cup of ice and offered my boyfriend a beer... From that moment forward, the service just continued to blow me away!\n\nWe started by sampling the day's oysters - 3 types of Miyagi (BC, Washington, and a local one) - as well as little necks and Cherrystone's. I ate them all with a little extra salt, lemon juice, and their homemade Thai chili hot sauce. The hot sauce was surprisingly spicy, but I wasn't too fond of their mignette.\n\nNext, we had the crab back and half-cracked crab. I wish the crab back was served warm because I didn't really like it cold... I also wish we had opted to get some warm butter for the half-cracked crab, but the flavor was great nonetheless.\n\nWe finished off with a small order of the Sicilian sashimi. I was skeptical of the capers at first, but it was pleasantly interesting, and the fish was fresh. We had hamachi, maguro, sake, scallop, and local halibut. \n\nEvery minute we were at the counter, we felt special and very welcome by two guys especially, who seemed to genuinely want us to enjoy ourselves.\n\nIf you like good seafood and good people, you have to come here.

All the fixings were on the counter including the dressing, cocktail sauce, lemons, and chili. \n- the clam chowder is rich, and full of clam flavor. My dad says it's the best he's ever had, but we have different tastes. I saw that the cream sauce was broken, and it wasn't the best clam chowder experience I've ever had. I wish there was more cream, but it was good. \n- the Italian sashimi plate was interesting. Delicious and fresh, but my personal preference is getting in the way here. There was olive oil, some chopped up red onion, capers, and fresh crushed pepper strewn over the raw fish. The assortment included salmon, hamachi, ahi tuna, atlantic salmon, and then the scallop. The Italian seasoning took away from the fish. The scallop was the best, buttery thing on the plate. LOVED it. In fact, ordered a whole plate of that: \n- the scallop was melt in your mouth delicious, sweet, buttery. Ugh!!!!! 'nough said. \n- In addition to the salad, we got a crab cocktail. Clean and delicious. \n- Finally we got two dozen raw oysters. Delicious flavor. Best in a while. \n\nBill was $206 including the above, a beer and a half, and the crab tamale. Not cheap.

The chowder, was good, but there are better chowders in the city. It was the thicker kind of chowder, which I like. We got the sashimi after reading so many Yelp reviews. You should definitely order it if you come. The bf really enjoyed his Crab Back.  \n\nWe were very full after meal. It is on the tad expensive, but we would come back for the experience. Swan Oyster Depot is one of those SF institutions that you must visit at some point, especially if you live in the Bay Area. The line are definitely shorter on the weekdays. So if possible, come then. If not, come as early as you can. The line, when we left, was way longer than when we arrived.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

It was around 3:30 in the afternoon 3 people ahead of me in line total wait time 20 minutes. Once I got seated,  I ordered a half dozen assorted clams, a cup of chowder and the crab salad along with an anchor steam. It was basically  average chowder, a bit watery, french bread and butter was a bit hard for my taste.The crab salad was excellent full of crab meat over a bed of lettuce but I found a strand of hair in it. I thought food preparers had to wear hair nets. Got my beer and oyster in five minutes. The reason why I giving this place a low rating is because of the service. While the person sitting next to me arrived at the same time, she received her chowder in no time. I had a different server waited an additional ten minutes before catching his attention to inquired about the chowder. Finished everything and patiently waited another ten minutes for the crab salad that never came. I felt like he was ignoring me even while he walked pass me without so much looking at my direction a dozen times.   So finally asked him about the crab salad, he said sorry I forgot it. After finishing the salad and everything else he never came back to check whether I need it more bread or another beer, it seem like he would go on ignoring  me. I finally wanted to pay my bill another five minute passes by and I finally had to flag him down once more and to add insult to injury he told the other server to tally up the bill for me.  I've worked in restaurants before and believe tipping the help at least 20% \n which I did but when I got home I thought to myself he didn't deserve a tip at all for the shitty service.   Total bill with tip $73.  There is no excuse for forgetting two of my orders and not so much as looking my way to check whether I needed more bread or beer!   I'm guessing he prefers not to serve middle age Asian males.", "author": "Ray H."}

The only thing that blew me away was the Sicilian sashimi platter. But, I've definitely had comparable sashimi at my local sushi place that doesn't have bones in it. I know how to eat around bones, but that doesn't mean I want it in my sashimi, and sushi chefs know how to prep sashimi sans bones.\n\nI was told the crab back was amazing but I did not partake.\n\nThe clam chowder was flavorful, but less creamy than your standard chowder.\n\nThey're very accommodating to mixing and matching for cocktails. I got the crab and prawn. The prawn was plump and fresh, might've been the best I've ever had. Just a smidge better than Mastro's. The crab was ok, not amazing. To be fair, once you've had crab at a Chinese restaurant that was alive just minutes ago in a tank before being boiled and cooked with garlic, everything else pales in comparison.\n\nIf you're not going at 10-10:30, I wouldn't recommend going.

They have amusing signs on the wall such as, \"$5 for whining, and for melted butter -- seriously.\" The menu is displayed on the wall, but there are some things (scallops sashimi) that aren't listed so I'd ask or just run through some Yelp pics/reviews. \n\nLet's get to the food:\nCup of chowder - tasty and flavorful, but more watery than what you'd expect of a chowder. \nKumamoto oysters - yum, so fresh! And not too briney either, which is great. \nScallop sashimi, Sicilian style - YUMYUMYUM. Definitely highlight of the meal. Please do yourself a favor and order this! \nPrawn cocktail - can't ever go wrong with a cocktail! The prawns were perfectly cooked. \nHalf-cracked crab - delicious. Mix some horse radish into cocktail sauce and dip your crab meat in it. Do it. The Louie sauce was good, but it's more mild in flavor so if you like your sauces with more punch, pass on it. \n\nService was great. The man helping us out was super sweet and kept winking haha \n\nExpect to drop at least $80 for a meal for two. Of course this will depend on if you're getting a full meal vs. just a snack. \n\nIf you like seafood of all types, give this a try. The wait is forgotten as soon as you take your first bite of food.", "author": "Doris K."}

Huge thanks to Adam S. for the recommendation!!  Swan Oyster Depot is a tiny restaurant with bar only seating, so the line can get long real fast. It's well worth the wait & you can't go wrong with anything that you order, so don't be shy.  I had the clam chowder, crab back and half cracked crab. I'm told most people dip bread into the crab back, but I'm from New Orleans so I dumped all the crab meat from the half cracked crab into the crab back. They should make a new menu item and just fill the crab backs with the meat and call it crab back cocktail. I think the regulars might look at them crazy, but trust me they are missing out!  \nI noticed most people ordered the Sicilian sashimi, and oysters. I'm definitely going to have to go back and try those items. My bar tender also let me sample the smoked salmon. It was the best bite of smoked salmon I have ever eaten! I'm most definitely ordering that item on my next visit. I'm already trying to figure out how to get back to San Francisco as soon as possible to eat here again. I love that this is a family owned and run restaurant that it has been around for over 100 years. These are the types of places I love to frequent when I travel. It's such a huge treat. I'll be back until I've tried everything they have to offer, and then I'll keep coming back because it's just that awesome!!", "author": "Kate D."}

I have never waited so long to eat at any food establishment, but that is the only downside to Swan. I went on a Saturday morning, about 30 minutes after they opened. Got seated 2.5 hours later. On a rainy Friday afternoon, the wait was still an hour. This is really due to the fact that the restaurant is tiny, with one long bar. \n\nOn the bright side, Swan makes up for the wait with the food and the service. Once you get inside and get seated, one of the many servers takes your order and you can watch your food being prepared on the other side of the bar. \n\nThey've got the best clam chowder I've ever had. We alternate between dipping loaves of bread in the chowder and the crab back (it's only $6!!). The combination Louie salad is also amazing. It's really more like more like mounds of crab and shrimp with some lettuce and dressing. The combination seafood cocktail is pretty much the same variety of seafood with some sauce and an added raw oyster. The sashimi plate with capers and onions is also quite tasty. \n\nPrices are pretty reasonable considering the quality you get. The environment is also very welcoming. I believe the restaurant is family run, and everyone provides equally amazing service. The first time I went, one of the employees saw me watching him slice smoked salmon and cut me off a chunk to try. \n\nIt is cash only, but for anyone that uses Chase, there's a branch right across the street.

A Bay Area native I'd met prior to our trip said this joint made his favorite clam chowder in the city, so of course, I had to try it! \n\nThere was a line out the door, which I anticipated, but the line moved quickly as people left. The restaurant is just one long bar, so this may not be the best place for large groups that want to sit together. As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by some of the friendliest guys ever, and despite how hectic it was, we were treated well and served quickly! \n\nWe ordered two bowls of their Boston Clam Chowder and some bread on the side. The chowder was fantastic, and better than any bowl of Boston Clam Chowder I've had anywhere else! It had a strong clam flavor which I love love love. It isn't the thick chowder you expect, but it was delicious nonetheless. The bread was cold and a little dry, but obviously people don't come here for the bread, haha. We didn't try any of the seafood this time around, but we could hear people raving about it all around us! Hopefully I'll be able to update this review the next time in the city.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-13", "description": "I finally bit the bullet and came to Swan Oyster Depot on a Friday.  With this joint opening at 10:30 AM, my wife & I showed up at 9:50 and found a line about 20 deep long already.  We did not get in during the first wave, but were near the front of the line after the initial seating.  A spot at the counter opened up around 11:10, so the wait was about 80 minutes.  But it was totally worth the wait!\n\nWe started out with 2 large bowls of clam chowder.  The chowder was \"New England\" style, but not as creamy as you'd normally get from other seafood places.  The chowder was a little thinner than usual, but full of clams and potatoes.  Plus, there were bowls of oyster crackers on the counter for your dipping or soaking pleasure.  And the sourdough bread served was fresh and delicious; the offered butter was not needed.\n\nOur next course was a half dozen clams and half dozen mixed oysters (from different regions).  Again, super fresh, with only a spritz of lemon juice and some tabasco were needed (also, both already on the counter).  You can also get some cocktail sauce, horseradish or any of the other dozen brands of hot sauce to spice up your shellfish.\n\nFinally, we put in an order of the smoked trout and another order of the cold smoked salmon.  The smoked trout was served as is, with a small shrimp salad.  The trout was sweet and flaky, not too fishy or smoky.  This was, by far, our favorite dish of the meal.  The salad had their louie dressing and provided a nice counter-balance to all the seafood (Mom always said to eat my greens).  The cold smoked salmon (as opposed to their hot-smoked salmon) was served on thin slices of french bread, with a smattering of olive oil, cracked pepper, chopped onion and capers covering the thinly-sliced salmon.  While this restaurant is owned and operated by Italian Catholics, the smoked salmon would make any Jew proud.\n\nBy the time we walked out a little after 12 noon, the line was at least 50 people deep (at least a 2 hour wait).  But you can bide the time and order a draft beer while you dream of shrimp cocktails and oysters on the half-shell.  Just walk to the front and order beers at the counter.\n\nUnfortunately, we came here just short of the opening of crab season, so we'll need to brave the long lines to try the cracked crab and crab back.  But I know that will be worth it, too.  (Also, make sure you bring cash, since they don't take credit cards.  You can always go to the Chase ATM across the street).\n\nIf you are an OG seafood purist, you must make the pilgrimage to Swan Oyster Depot.  Use the wait time to contemplate how much you love the fruits of the water (and maybe down a beer or two).  Your stomach and your soul will thank you.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

We ended up waiting over an hour to get in. Now it's not that this place is super busy, it's just super small inside. There are approximately 12-14 bar seats inside. That's it. It was so small in there, we had to leave our stroller outside. As for a child seat, don't even ask. Where the hell would they store it?? \n\nThe wait isn't too bad...funny story... we were waiting behind these two men in their mid-sixties who were talking about world traveling and big game hunting. All of a sudden one of the older dudes begins talking about wanting to \"bang\" some lady... Dude really? You're that loud and obnoxious? His words verbatim were: \"well I want to straighten her out, but the opportunity hasn't presented itself yet.\" I'm getting irritated at this point telling myself: \"there's no restaurant in the world that's good enough to wait in line next to these two shepherds for the devil...\"  At that point the vomit started to come back down my throat back into my stomach and we were seated, so I couldn't back out. I hope those old farts read my review and I hope some pimp with hepatitis spits in their foul mouths. \n\nThe food was definitely worth the wait. Very fresh seafood; we ordered the combination salad, crab back (to dip our bread into), bowl of clam chowder and a plate of sashimi (I think that's what they called it). Everything was super fresh and tasty. Very minimal seasoning as, they want the seafood to shine here. I understand that. Only feedback I can give is that the crab back needed to be heated up instead of being served cold. The combination salad is like any seafood salad but with baby shrimp, lump crab, and prawns. The chowder was hot and had great flavor. The crab back was good with the bread and the sashimi was delicious. Next time I would probably get a large sashimi. BTW, that was the first time I ever had raw scallops and boy were they excellent!! \n\nThis place only accepts cash, so I was very conservative on ordering because I didn't know how much the bill was going to be and I only had $120 cash. If they accepted credit cards, I would have just told the guy to put food in front of me until I said stop. I totally mis-judged my total bill as it was only $58 for what I mentioned above. I was so conservative that I didn't even order beer or oysters... Quite disappointed about that, but I didn't want to be short when the bill arrived. Next time I come here it's ON! Hopefully those two old humps aren't in line again.\n\nLastly, I must mention that the staff and owner were so welcoming and friendly. They made my daughter a little plate of bread and made us feel at home. I really appreciated that. \n\nKudos Swan Oyster Depot! We will be back!", "author": "Alan Y."}

Lighthearted, cozy, and all around fun atmosphere to enjoy some seafood and beer in a San Francisco institution. \n\nAlso, contrary to what you see on Bourdain's travels, you can hardly ever just walk-in to Swan Oyster Depot so prepare for a line.", "author": "Jon L."}

I enjoyed their fresh variety of seafood. We got 12 mixed variety oysters which included (blue point, miagya, Kumamoto, and another one I can't remember). All the oysters were fresh and the brine was perfect. They give you a red rice whine vinegrette, or a Thai chili sauce to go with your oysters. If you're like me, Tabasco and horseradish will do! We had a combination salad which consisted of lettuce, a heaping amount of crab, small shrimp, and 3 jumbo shrimp! We asked for their famous Louise sauce on the side. The dressing taste like a fancier thousand island. Then we had a sashimi plate with just tuna and salmon. They top it off with pepper, olive oil, and some type of green pea.

It is by far the best smoked salmon I've ever had.\n\nI came here with a group of six on a Saturday morning and had to wait for a good while before getting some seats at the far end of the counter. It was a bliss to be seated in front of all the fish and cutting boards where I get to watch the multitude of workers here slicing away at all kinds of fish and shellfish. The service is exceptionally friendly here as they happily assist in choosing what to order and are glad to engage in conversation as they work behind the counter. They also consistently fill up the water cups and provide bread whenever desired.\n\nWe started off with the dozen oysters which came with three different varieties being from British Columbia, Marin County, and Washington. They're fresh and delicious but not outstandingly superb compared to raw oysters you might get elsewhere. However, they have some great add ons such as their homemade spicy sauce and horseradish that compliment the shellfish very well. We also tried the combination Louie salad which came with two types of shrimp and crab over lettuce which was pretty decent. The best part of it has to be the crab which comes in shredded pieces and a couple of fat pieces presumably from the claws. We ordered a cup of calamari as well which wasn't anything special, but definitely not bad.\n\nOther than the amazing smoked salmon dish that comes on bread with some chopped onions and capers, the other dish that I found very enjoyable was the Sicilian sashimi platter. It comes with a variety of raw seafood including scallops, tuna, salmon, and others. The raw fish is dressed in olive oil and comes with capers as well.

From the reviews, I was expecting around an hour wait, which would've worked out fine since my lunch break is around 12:15. It actually took her maybe half an hour before she was next in line. Unfortunately, I couldn't take my lunch take when she was in front of the line so I made her wait an extra twenty minutes. She's a trooper.\n\nWhen I finally arrived, we got seated quickly. The workers all seem very friendly. But the worker just standing there in front of us made us feel rushed. I tried to order as quickly as possible. Based off the reviews, we ordered the small Sicilian sashimi plate, half a dozen of oysters, and the crab salad. \n\nThe oysters were the first thing we ate. They were so delicious and fresh! I also loved their unique hot sauce. To be frank, it was my favorite thing I ate the whole meal. Then our crab salad came. So much crab on it! I read the reviews and everyone says to skip the combo salad and just order the crab salad, which is the reason why I ordered it. What a mistake! Maybe I'm crazy to be complaining about too much crab, but man was it too much. A bit overwhelming. Regret not ordering the combo salad. Actually, I could've gone without any salad. Didn't have much flavor. Barely tasted the dressing. In the end, we just tried to finish the crab since that was mostly what we were paying for and ignored the lettuce. Now on to the sashimi plate.. it was so small! Didn't realize how tiny it would be. It was good, but definitely not worth its price. We also decided to order a cup of clam chowder in the end. It was so funky.. very liquidy. Nothing of the clam chowder reminded me of clam chowder lol. \n\nAll I can say is that I'm glad I got to try this place and remove it from my bookmarks.

These little guys were succulent and sweet, shucked right in front of me by my own personal seafood attendant, the oysters fresher than I've ever had. Speaking of their staff, the guys of Swan Oyster Depot were great! I had one gentleman who took care of everything for me. Waiter, chef, and local guide all rolled onto one - he took the order, shucked, cracked, sliced and served the entire delicious meal. But back to the meal! \n\nThe best oysters were closely followed with a rich crab back and some of their hearty bread. I could have easily shared that with someone, but my partner in crime couldn't wait in line, so I enjoyed solo. Next was a half cracked crab and they recommended a Dijon, Mayo, lemon, and horseradish house sauce that was amazing. Mixed right in front of me and just for me, it really brought out the flavor of the crab without being overpowering. Last, but not least, was an order of the smoked salmon with rye. It was rich, beautiful color, and sliced to order. \n\nAll of this with a glass of mediocre Chardonnay was about $80 pre tip. They are cash only so come prepared. I wish my friend had been able to stay and dine with me, but I brought the large amount of left over to her at work. \n\nFrom the folks I talked to in line and at the counter, the wait is usually not as bad outside of the holidays. There was also a to-go line that I saw once inside that seemed much shorter. However, I had already waited for a seat and wasn't sure if the to go option offered the full menu, so I stayed put in the regular line. Overall I had a great experience and would do it again, but probably not right after Christmas when the city is packed with tourists (including myself) or try the to-go option the next time I'm back in the city. If you love seafood and can appreciate the overall experience of a place, Swan Oyster Depot is a must.", "author": "Helen R."}

It is unsanitary how they run the place.  \n\nThe employees multi-task, between being your cashier, your waiter and the bus boy!\nI watched them collect money, handle the food with their bare hands, clear the tables of dirty dishes and then use a dirty rag to clean the tables.

Our stop at Swan Oyster Depot was what we talked about over and over this week, not the other place.\n\nWe're regulars at Hog Island (even buying oysters to shuck at home) and love seafood. That said, This Place is SPECIAL. Got here at about 10:15 Saturday morning and waited about 50 min. Missed first seating by a bit so get here on the weekends around 10. Went to Bob's doughnuts while my wife waited for a snack.\n\nOnce inside its warm, inviting and you instantly feel it's history. Everyone is smiling and having a good time, staff are warm and friendly. We were greeted by Tom the owner and he took his time to welcome us, explain everything and made us feel at home. We look like little 20 year old Asian kids (we're actually 34) so even at Michelin Star restaurants service can be hit or miss.   This place was spot on, felt like I was in grandma's kitchen... except better food.\n\nDozen oysters are sweet and fresh, even the larger oysters to our great surpise. Make sure to try the house made Thai chilli mignonette, awesome. Sicilian sashimi plate was amazing, the olive oil brings out so much flavor. Shrimp cocktail filling. Didn't try smoked salmon but I wish we did after sitting in front it. No crab back or uni today so we'll have to come back.

I didn't expect that to happen since I've always heard that they have long lines and the wait can be up to a few hours.  (Side note: if you don't want to dine in or just don't want to wait in line you could just order Togo and get your meal quicker.)  \nMy mom and I were seated and we quickly ordered the must haves: Clam chowder, combination seafood salad, cherrystone clams, oysters, and the infamous Italian sashimi. All of that was enough to feed the both of us. \nThe clam chowder was more soupy than thick and creamy which was ok. It did have a lot of clams which I liked and they had a bowl of oyster crackers and fresh bread for your leisure . The combo salad was humungous and they put a generous portion of various seafood. The house made 1000 island dressing doesn't disappoint either. Now if you are a sashimi lover than I suggest you order the Italian version. Fresh tuna, scallops, yellowtail, and salmon topped with shallots and capers then drizzled with EV olive oil and freshly cracked black pepper. Squeeze some lemon on that and maybe a splash of Tabasco and your taste buds are in heaven. \nOverall my mom and I enjoyed this place and want to come back again. You can't beat fresh seafood and this place takes pride in that.

The line is long, and it moves SLOW. The seating is limited with maybe ~20 seats along a counter. \n\nMy bf and I shared a small sashimi plate, kumamoto oysters, and a crab cocktail. The quality of the seafood here is undeniable --- fresh and delicious. \n\nKumamoto oysters - sweet, plump, fresh. Coupled with just a splash of lemon, or their vinaigrette if you'd like. I think it was like $16? $18? for half a dozen. \n\nCrab cocktail - we had the cocktail sauce on the size, so basically, we got a glass full of chunks of crab meat. DELICIOUS. A huge chunk of claw meat, just lots of fresh, pure, sweet, crab meat. \n\nSashimi plate (smaller one) - had some tuna, salmon, and.....one other I'm not sure. It's served on a layer of delicious olive oil. Now this is preference, BUT, my bf and I both didn't like this dish. The fish was fresh, but nothing extraordinary or unique from your average slices of sashimi at a sushi restaurant. We found the olive oil to be overpowering and didn't like the fish flavored with it. This small plate of sashimi was ~$24. I'd rather have sashimi at a sushi restaurant, personally. \n\nThe service was okay, we didn't receive that superb service others mentioned. We had this young guy who kinda skipped over us mostly, but when 2 girls sat down next to us, he actually gave them attention and made conversation with them. Go figure. CASH ONLY, which was annoying. When a $5 bowl of something is cash only, I understand.

The people of San Francisco seem to love standing queues, and this place is no exception. Due to its unparalleled history, Swan Oyster Depot is a seafood mecca for both outsiders and residents. Being featured by the self righteous Anthony Bourdain himself also inflates this establishment's allure and ego.\n\nSituated in a very small space on Polk Street, there's always a noticeable line forming outside the door. To avoid this, my partner and I called ahead and ordered take out. We were directed that it would be a \"few minutes\", so we leisurely made our way to Swan Oyster. In order to ensure proper sampling of the menu, we ordered a sashimi platter, crab backs, clam chowder, and crab cocktail. After arriving at Swan Oyster, a \"few minutes\" turned into quite the ordeal, as they seemed to openly and unapologetically neglect our order. The staff here work at a fairly leisurely pace, as they are an established restaurant who seem to be above the concept of hospitality. We observed the zombielike queue-ers with pity, as the line outside moved at a snail's pace. The people within the restaurant, ate at an intentionally slow speed - to validate their time spent waiting, and to reassure themselves that the meal had been worth it. \n\nAfter quite the wait, we finally received our take out and anxiously headed home to check out the spread. After unwrapping all the food, the sashimi platter was noticeably a small size rather than the medium that was ordered (nobody wants to pay $24 for a tiny portion of fish). All in all, the food was unimpressive and underwhelming. While the crab was rather fresh, it lacked that succulent sweetness that I expect when I bite into a crab leg. The cocktail sauce, which typically defines crab cocktails, was lackluster and tasted more like ketchup than anything else. The crab backs and bread were one of the highlights of the meal, as the clam chowder wasn't a singular soup experience. This isn't a place that I would return to, as the queue is already very deterring, and the food didn't inspire.

They all taste fresh, juicy, meaty, sweet, just like eating hugs and clouds. Then of course fresh sea urchin. Super fresh, they just got them when I walked in. Yummies! So good! \nBtw, their spicy Thai sauce is bomb! So garlicky, slightly spicy, sweet and savory! Must try! \nThen I got small plate of Sicilian sashimi, yes yes, I ate all of that, and I REGRET NOTHING! Sashimi was good, fresh, just like everything they have. \nThe only thing I didn't like, when I asked for the check, guy asked me what I ordered and then said 60+. I mean ok, I get it, it's all fresh and seafood is usually expensive. But why I'm laying same as guy who had almost twice as much?! Hmmm idk maybe I'll go next time and ask for actual check to see why am I paying so much. Cause I didn't see any paper at all\nAnyways, food is great, so you decide, if it worth strange checks with prices from the skies or not", "author": "Asiyat T."}

For many years, I lived just a few blocks from Swan Oyster Depot but never tried it because of the daunting line. \n\nI went by on a Tuesday afternoon around 12:45 and found a relatively short line - only about 3 people in front of us (our party of two). We waited about 15 minutes to get a stool at the bar (there are only seats at the bar). The menu is limited - seafood cocktail (shrimp, prawn or crab), salad (same seafood options), clam chowder soup and various other items.  \n\nWe shared the crab cocktail and the prawn cocktail, and I had the clam chowder soup. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly like any of the dishes - the clam chowder was thin and oily while the seafood cocktails were okay but nothing to write home about. $60 for those three dishes seemed pricey, and I think you're better off getting seafood at a variety of other spots in SF.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Then I'll order a half dozen mixed oyster which are some of the freshest and most tasty you will find.

Also don't forget your next Anchor if you haven't ordered it yet. I usually stop there but I could go on. If I'm feeling dangerous I'll order one of the other great things like the calamari salad, crab/prawn cocktail, or a crab salad with the special Louie/crab fat/heaven dressing (only on request).

Bright, sweet and briny.

It was a little too much raw shellfish for the morning. But I enjoyed the shrimp and prawns.\n\nUni - I love live uni and this didn't disappoint. Fresh and huge!

The staff literally uses their bare hands to scoop the seafood salad into bowls. I am a health inspector as an occupation, so when I saw this I kept watching. They continually used their bare hands to scoop up seafood, wiped their hands on their soiled aprons and then handled the cash register, plates, glasses etc never once washing their hands in the hour we were sitting there. S\n\nFood such as bread was left lying on the same counter that moments before had raw seafood, not in a plate or anything just right on the counter. I won't go on and on, suffice it to say this place was very dirty and unsanitary, blatant health code violations and obvious ones. Seriously handling raw and or ready to eat seafood with bare hands and not washing hands once.\n\nAs for the food, the only thing I felt comfortable ordering after seeing how the food was being served, was oysters. The guy shucked them holding them sideways so all the liquor dropped out, the best part. It may have been intentional tho because I ordered 4 different types and all 4 were pretty bad. Maybe I'm spoiled from living in the northeast, but they were less than fresh and I've had better west coast oysters on the east coast. Finally the cocktail sauce they serve with the oysters was, literally, watered down ketchup.

The sashimi, olive oil, and capers went SO well together. The best thing was the scallop sashimi. So delicate, creamy, and just perfection.\n3. Crab fat - by this time I was just getting greedy. I was absolutely stuffed, but was eyeing the crab fat (the dangers of sitting by the window)\n\nYou can also pick up food to go. I'll probably do that the next time I want my seafood fix but don't want to wait in line!", "author": "Michelle L."}

The atmosphere of the front is no bullshit. You sit at the counter, the waiters tell you stories about their lives, and u converse with your fellow diners by your side.

Bourdain and just word of mouth from fellow food friends, this has been one of the places I've always wanted to dine at.\n\nPlan of attack was get in line prior to them opening up (as this place gets insanely PACKED) and the place being as tiny as it is doesn't help, but hey, I would say this place is an institution. If it's not broke, why \"fix it\", right? It's basically a long, thin bar with bar stools to enjoy your fresh, delicious seafood.\n\nParking, just like anywhere in the city, is a challenge, but isn't non-existent. With that being said, I shall share on my experience on when I had to feed the meter as the wait was close to about 2 hours (worth every minute to be honest with you), as the food, was mind blowing. It makes me wish this place was in L.A., but then again, it's in S.F. In \"enemy\" Giants territory. The place not only has a display of a Giants flag in their window, but I would say the entire staff back their team. Hey, I can respect that. I can also respect the friendly \"banter\" from said staff. \n\nAs my GF, my cousin (both S.F. locals), got closer to the door, one of the fine gentlemen who's serving the patrons glared at me, then said, \"You have some nerve wearing that stuff around here\" - (my Dodger cap and Dodger greats shirt that have Garvey, Lopes, Russell, Cey, and Yeager on it).  Which got a chuckle from my cousin and giggle from the Mrs. Ha!\n\nI already knew it was going to be an interesting experience here. The thing is, I know it's friendly banter and not once did it ever get out of hand with him. The guy actually did talk to me (as HE served us) about baseball and was actually cordial. So, obviously, even though he's a fan of that team, I had a great conversation with him about our respective teams as well as him serving us greatly that I tipped the man above the usual 18%. Of course the staff exchanged friendly banter with me as well as I sat there, but I was amused and so were my cohorts, so, I took no offense to it at all.\n\nThis place is CASH ONLY, so be prepared (there's a Chase ATM across the street and a Wells Fargo just down the block as well), so if you're a BofA person and didn't come prepared, bend over and pay the \"fee\" for using either ATM.\n\nI do like the fact that the stuff that's on full view in the window (which looks too good to be real) is actually the stuff they use to make your salads and other seafood dishes and being VERY generous with the seafood. That gained brownie points from me automatically.\n\nThe only hot things served here is the clam chowder, with everything else being cooked already and chilled or raw.\n\nThe Mrs. and I started things off sharing a bowl of their clam chowder, my cousin ordered a cup as well. All I have to say about it, WOW. It has ruined clam chowder from any place going forward. The first thing you taste, is the clams! It's a thin soup which was perfectly fine for all of us as you can tell it's not masked by too much flour or filling like must places and the abundance of clams.\n\nThen I realized, oh, time to feed the meter. So I walk out towards the car which is just about a block or so from the restaurant. As I walk, I noticed a car stopped at the light honk at me with the man inside yell, \"Hey!\". To which I obviously look, he then proceeds to point at his head (basically my cap) and does the Dikembe Mutombo finger wag at me. Of course, I laugh, because, really? You'll honk, yell, then finger wag. I was just waiting to actually hear him like Dikembe and say, no, no, no. I digress.\n\nWe then ordered the Oysters sample which consisted of Bluepoint, Kumomoto, Drake's (local) and Miyagi oysters. I do remember that our favorite was Drake's and on our next visit (yes, already planning it), we're going to get a dozen of just that. Nice, light taste of the ocean, with a touch of sweet, nice flesh/texture. Superb.\n\nWe finished things off with \"sashimi\"  which consisted of Tuna, Salmon, and scallops topped with a squeeze of lemon juice, onions, pepper, and extra virgin olive oil. The dang dish was so amazing I could have easily eaten two more by itself, but I couldn't be a brute with the Mrs. and my cousin in tow. Will easily order this again on my next visit.\n\nSo after all was said and done, lunch (decently full) for 3, less than $65. Which was well worth it.\n\nAs we walk out of the restaurant, towards the car, a man (with his wife and young kids) comes up to me and says, \"Excuse me, let me take care of you\". I was shocked of course because I didn't expect him to say anything to me as he's with his family..and proceeds to say, \"Let me buy you some Giants gear\" which only made the Mrs. and my cousin just erupt in laughter. Goodness. So I tell them about the situation earlier as well and again, nothing but laughter. S.F., gotta love it. I'll be back and GO DODGERS!", "author": "Wes S."}

I was SO excited to go there.  My partner was SO not excited.  So this is a tale of two people who experienced completely different lunches.\n\nI woke up at 915 am because I wanted to get there by 10 am.  That's just how I'd do it.  Since my internal clock was three hours ahead, as I'm from Toronto, it didn't seem odd to be to want to chow down on shrimp and crab at 1030 - since I'd be lunch time in my soul.  My day didn't play out like that.  I waited while the man got ready, because I'd rather eat said shrimp with him than without him.  And so I actually arrived at Swan (tired) at 11 am.\n\nThere were people in line.  For some reason, Mother Nature thought it'd be funny to actually make San Fran hot that day.  There's no shade in line, so if you are on that rare, almost nonexistent hot San Fran day, wear sunscreen or a hat.  There's a Walgreens across the street for water if you need.  Line moves fairly fast.  We had about 20-something people ahead of us, and it took an hour. \n\nThe interesting thing for me was that they don't shove you in there, or rush you.  You still get a good experience.  My man doesn't sit on backless seats, so he stood.  No one cared.  The people next to us had a baby in stroller taking up some space that could have been seated.  No one cared.  Each few stools gets a different server, so you get personalized attention - this meant we saw other people with a different server getting free samples, which was a bit annoying, since we got nada.  No one cared....\n\nBathroom is far back.  Far, far, keep going, not there, there you go.  \n\nFood is fresh as hell, they don't cook anything, it's literally just seafood on a plate.

My diet consists of 80% seafood. I love shellfish! And this place has almost all my favorite kinds of shellfish. Talk about a happy eating!!\n\nThe journey/process- Dining here is no chopped liver. There will always be lines ( unless you come at 4 pm). You will always have to wait to sit on those bar stools ( been there since 1900!) for a good hour plus. You will be sharing your space with strangers who are also going for the same things you are getting. But you will love every minute of it.\n\nThe place- it is a simple fish market style place with all the seafood out front in the glass case. They have beer on tap. A lady in the back taking all the crab meat out so she can bring them out in bulk every half hour or so. Owner and his sons + your very fun waiters running around behind that counter working effortlessly all the while getting you a great service. It's casual, comfortable, fun and all about food.\n\nFood-\nIt's all about seafood. Shellfish on ice mostly. The only thing that serves hot in this place is their chowder. Everything else comes on ice or on a bed of lettuce.\n\nThings to get:\n1. Crab Salad!!!!!! They have mixed seafood salad too but the Crab salad is an absolute must. So much of that fresh cooked crab on a bed of lettuce. Serve with your choice of dressing. If you get the balsamic /oil dressing- hold on to your seat!!\nOlive oil mixed with crab fat! It's like magic with fireworks in your mouth. Uh-mazing!!!!\n\n2. Little neck clams- a must get!! If you are not keen on clam, try half a dozen first. But make sure you use their special homemade hot sauce. It is made just for these little clams and boy do they go together. \n\n3. Smoked Salmon - just wow. You can get a half order of this thing and watch your server beautifully slice that smoke salmon. Serve on a bruschetta with a jar of capers!\n\n4. Oysters- you can't come here and not get oysters! Kumamoto and Miyagi are what I usually get. You can get them on half shells or in a cocktail form. I was seated right in front of a massive bowl of oysters!! All swimming and pretty...Had to control myself so I don't put my face in it!\n\n5. Chowder - pipping hot and oh so good. I always get this!\n\n6. Crab cocktail - yea I love crab and every time I'm here, I can't help but have more crab. Lettuce fills me up too fast at time so I get my fill of crab with this. All the tasty lump piled high in a cocktail glass. Tasttyyyyyy!\n\n7. Last but not least- Uni!!!!!!!!!!! Their sea urchin is simply mind blowing. I was disappointed that I didn't get to eat any Uni on my last visit last week. They said they haven't had it in a month due of bad weather and waves. (It's impossible to dive down and grab them). But if you can, try this!\n\n\nService- no matter who you get at this place, it is sure to be fun and entertaining. One of the brothers that owned this was our server and we got to learn a lot about the place while we chowed down on everything seafood. Hmmm so good. I've been having seafood cravings since I came back from this last week. When the ingredient is good, you don't need to add anything on it. That's exactly what they do here. A ton of fresh seafood with minimal fixings. They also send you home with a post card and a sponge business card. What else can you ask for? Well except to go back and get more food.\n\nOh and if you are short on time, do a take out. Go straight to the front of the line and they will help you quicker than you can say crab salad with crab fat dressing!  7 stars all the way!!\n\nAnd it's CASH ONLY!!!!!!!

Certain items were very fresh, but the food is very overpriced for the quality, and you could get better seafood elsewhere.\n\n* ITALIAN CRUDO ($29) - 2 STARS:\nItalian version of a sashimi omakase, topped generously with olive oil and capers.

So my boyfriend has set out to eat at SOD at opening: 10:30AM when Yelp said they would open. We get to their store front at 10:10am, and the place was already open with first seating full!!!! We ended up waiting in line for about 25 minutes before getting seats at the bar.\n\nA family of four leaves the bar and we're set next to be seated. My boyfriend and I had started off with cups of chowder. I think the perks of getting the chowder is that the oyster crackers are on the counter for you in this big fat bowl for you to scoop at your leisure. **thumbs up** Following the chowder was got a mixed platter of raw oysters. The oysters were fresh to death! A varietal east coast and west coast mix.\n\nWe weren't going to get full on oysters so we also bought a Combination Salad for $22.00. It seemed pretty steep for a salad, but having actually ordered it, the seafood ratio out beat the lettuce! Big shrimp, tiny pink shrimp everywhere a shrimp shrimp!! And the crab meat? Sweet, just like I like it. The fact we were in San Francisco and sourdough bread and butter were free with the salad, just wrapped it up for me! \n\nTouristy? Yes.\nWorth the hype? Yes.\nGood value?

It was not drenched in oil, but had a good amount.  Capers added the pop and saltiness.  Fresh and yum.\nSalad comes with bread and butter, and the bread was rustic and delicious!

There were 7 people ahead of us, we sat down around 3:10,  a 40 minutes wait was very acceptable after hearing 2 hours average wait time on weekends. Part of the reason for the lengthy wait time is due to their casual / relaxed serving style, at no time you feel rushed and everyone behind the counter assembled the dishes at a leisurely pace between friendly chats with customers. \n\nWe came hungry ready for some good raw seafood, between the 2 of us we had \na bowl of clam chowder - (3) probably the weakest of all dishes imho\nhalf order of smoke salmon- (4.5) creamy, slightly smoke not too salty, wish we ordered a full order\none doz assorted oysters - (4) very fresh, excellent\nhalf doz raw clams - (4.5) slightly salty savory crunchy goodness, loved it\nCrab cocktail - (4) very fresh Dungeness crab meat, yummy\nSashime (4) we actually liked the olive oil / capers / red onion Sicilian style dressing  so the freshness of the fish really stood out\n3 glasses of wine, bread and butter\n\nThe total bill came to $145 before tips somewhat  in line with what we expected.

After 10 months, we finally made it with high hopes and expectations. Yay, short wait and the counter seats about 15-20 people so we got lucky because the line started getting longer after us. Also, it's 130 pm on a random Tuesday. \n\nWe waited patiently because we were at the end of the counter and the guys behind the counter looked super busy. After 10 mins of drooling over other people's food and trying to catch anyone behind the counters eye so we can get some service, we were finally served our water. I know service isn't a testament to the food and everyone was generally friendly but I was uncontrollably turned off but it's ok.\n\nWe ordered a bowl of clam chowder (do not get, it was watery and had no... Clams... In it), famous crab salad (ours was smaller than the rest and what was shown on the pics on yelp, don't be tricked!), and a sashimi (tuna, salmon, sardines, scallops.) the couple next to us had this colorful 4 types of sashimi and we asked if that was the standard, the guy said 'I dunno we will see' he didn't even try to look for the sardines that was missing from the original plate we got. Being the yelp brat that I was, I asked someone who looked nice. He proceeded to find the last fish for me and added it on (our sashimi at the time looked so small compared to the couple next to us). Then I asked about the size of the crab salad and showed him the yelp pic, he said it was inaccurate... Okay fine whatever.\n\nOverall, the whole meal was 45 dollars, cash only. I was not only underwhelmed but disappointed. The guys behind the counter are pleasant and cheery but I still wouldn't recommend this place to my friends, sorry. \n\nAlso, no one had gloves on and moving stuff everywhere and cutting fish and handling raw food and serving it as is.

We came in the afternoon for a late lunch and there was a very short wait for us to be seated. It's a very old school, classic sit at the counter type of restaurant. I didn't mind the seating at all. However, my mom and I came here and we literally sat at the counter as we watched the employees eye is down as walk away not even taking our order or getting drinks started for us. They seemed to be very focused on their regulars that came in and were already eating or buying some seafood to go.\n\nAfter about 5-10 minutes of sitting there I finally called over an employee and they took our order and what not. My mom and I ended up getting bread and butter ($1), 3 bowls of clam chowder ($5each, one was to go), the combination seafood cocktail ($14.50), and a combination of oysters (about $30?). Our total came out to $64. \n\nThe clam chowder was much thinner in consistency than expected, but it had a delicious clam flavor. However, the amount of clams in the chowder seems to be inconsistent as my mom only had 4 pieces and I had far more than 4. Not a huge issue, but consistency in a restaurant is key. The seafood cocktail had one oyster, 2 large shrimps, and several small shrimps. It was definitely fresh, but not worth the price. Rather pay for the combination salad as it's almost the same price with more seafood! The oysters came with four different types and the pieces were average to small sized, but they were all very sweet, fresh, and fantastic. \n\nThroughout our dining experience we had two servers helping us. The second one who ended up taking over explained the different types of oysters to us and really made sure we were taken care of and had everything that we wanted. Although the seafood was really fresh and delicious, the price for some of the items are quite pricey for what we received. The service differs for each customer as I could see them paying much more attention to their regulars, but a bit disappointed that we weren't acknowledged to be served for the beginning. \n\nOverall 4 stars almost 5 for the food quality, but 3 for the experience and service.", "author": "Germain L."}

I would suggest coming on a weekday if you can get a day off from work, and getting there exactly when it opens (10:30am). This is what my bf and I did - I didn't start work until 2, and he was in between jobs. Perfect timing for a meal at Swan Oyster Depot. Otherwise, you'll have to wait crazy lines (or so I've heard!)\n\nWe were seated right away. It just so happened that they had Sea Urchin that day (not sure if that was a special, or on the regular menu?) but they served it right out of the tough, pointy, purple skin. Pretty awesome. Think of a fancy ice cream bowl...but instead of the bowl, the outside of the sea urchin, with the orange inside....YUM!\n\nCombo Louie salad (crab, jumbo shrimps and small shrimps over lettuce) was SO GOOD. It really hit the spot...basically your favorite seafood, yummy mayonnaise sauce, over salad. Can't get any better than that since it was so fresh! You can also get Crab Louie (only, versus the combo) salad, or shrimp only too. But Combo is awesome if you want to try a little bit of everything if you know what I mean!\n\nOysters were awesome too. For 2 people, we shared 12.  I can't remember where they were from, but just that the smaller ones were sweeter, and more tasty. I think one was from somewhere in Washington.\n\nSmoked salmon over french bread was awesome too. The slabs of salmon they give you is very plentiful, just very simple and good. I would also recommend the clam chowder bowl to start of with. Super yummy and a great appetizer while you're waiting for them to prepare the rest of your meal!\n\nThe only thing, the meal was all protein. Even though we were full, the lack of carbs still left us hungry in a different way. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nStaff here is hilarious. They are super friendly, native San Franciscans who have been here since the restaurant opened. It's family owned. They all get along great with each other, and are great entertainment. They talk about sports and joke around all the time. Hope nothing changes over time! Probably won't since they've been around over 100 years.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

This place felt like a true oyster/seafood bar with only about 20 seats at the counter and a knowledgeable staff. My bestie and I started off with a beer, which our server was kind enough to split for us because we didn't really feel like drinking a whole pint. We got a cup of Boston chowder each and then a dozen oysters to share. Our server brought us 3 varieties of oysters all of which were probably the freshest I have ever had. They have ample sauces and lemon on the counter up for grabs. At the end of the meal, they even provided a hot water and lemon bowl so I could clean off my hands. As I sat there finishing my beer, I watch the servers really cater to the customers and strive to find something that would satisfy the customers palette while also encouraging them to try other seafoods that they may not have before.

Darren and the rest of the guys (I forgot their names forgive me) but they are all awesome and made us feel like family. \n\nNow to the food. Get whatever you want but this is what we always get and what I suggest you try:\n\nSicilian sashimi- raw tuna, scallops and salmon with lemon, olive oil, onions and capers. Served with sourdough bread. Get it or you will be sorry. \n\nDrakes bay oysters (or whatever oysters they have but drakes bay were our favorite)\n\nLive sea urchin- I love uni so when I can get it live it's a real treat. IF, they have it, it sells out fast. \n\nCrab fat back- not sure if it's on the menu but they made it for us and it's a true delicacy. \n\nShrimp cocktail- those shrimp are so flavorful. I dream about them! Their cocktail sauce is on point too. \n\nThey open at 10:30. Get there well before then if you don't want to wait in a long line. The counter only sits like 12+ people if I remember correctly and that's the only seating in the place. We are going back there next month and can't wait to see the guys, eat amazing food and claim my steak at the counter!!", "author": "Mary S."}

Just like almost everyone who left the place explained though, it was well worth the wait!\n\nDespite what one may think due to the prices; This is not your fancy seafood restaurant at all..defiantly more of a dive with barely any elbow room. \n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted to try everything so we thought it'd be safe to order the smaller portions - HUGE mistake. \n\nWe got the Sicilian Styled Sashimi..he asked what size and we asked the difference. He named the prices instead and we just decided to get the small. WHYYYYYYYY?!?!  The serving size for the small comes on the same plate as the bread they give you, this is most definitely not enough. It's honestly more worth it to get at least a medium since it's not that much more....but just get the large because it is fucking delicious.\n\nFor that day their sashimi consisted of salmon, hamachi, scallops and tuna. All of it just simply melted in your mouth. Despite the fact that I dislike scallops I surprisingly loved them raw! Good job! :D\n\nBoyfriend also ordered a half dozen of the mixed raw oysters. I've only had oysters fried and didn't like it then so we weren't sure if I was going to like it raw...but I think almost every type of meat is delicious when it's not cooked. I loved the raw oysters! Very good and super fresh. Boyfriend said they were the best oysters he's had. \n\nTip: They have a variety of hot sauces behind the counter, so if you want something that's not in front of you just ask.\n\nWe did get lucky and got the last of the crab fat. Perfect with the bread and butter .. and yes, we ate both butter and crab fat on our bread and as terrible as it is for you it's delicious and for a special occasion! Just wish it was warm but it was still worth it.\n\nThe last thing we got was a combo salad with louie which was also very good. All the seafood is extremely fresh tasting but that crab meat though...... I think that was my favorite on my salad. Extremely plump, will have to order the cocktail next time.\n\nIf you're not in the mood to wait in line or knock elbows with your neighbor every so often you can always order to go! This place is well worth the visit for any seafood lover...or someone who is just wanting to try it out.\n\nAlso...yes they deal with the food bare handed (like every chef does if you go into any kitchen)...and they sanitize by rubbing lemon on their hands. It's subtle but it works. \n\nPS... CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY ... three people had to leave the line to go to an atm", "author": "Melissa C."}

It wasn't long, but people take awhile and the bar seating is so limited that it's hard to seat more than 2 people together, so we had to split up. And then they wouldn't let us sit together when seats immediately opened up, because someone was already serving them? Because water is so hard to bring over? Whatever.\n\nWe got a combo seafood salad, which was pretty big and it really is just different seafood on a pile of shredded lettuce. It was yummy though. The clam chowder was very clammy and not too creamy and very nice. The uni was the reason I wanted to come, and it was a little off-color, I felt. And the bread took effing forever bc our server didn't really know what was going on.\n\n\"No frills\" is more frills than Swan Oyster Depot. There is hardly any room for our plates in front of us. Our waitress never checked on us and took forever to flag down and still wouldn't bring us bread. And she quoted us the wrong price on the uni. And the check (done by hand on a napkin and calculated in someone's head) was still wrong. REALLY? But at that point we were just like ok whatever we're not gonna teach you math right now and paid the check and left.\n\nAll in all, a nice lunch food-wise but I could have gone to a lot of other places and been more satisfied.

I focused on the Sicilian Sashimi --imagine Sashimi tuna and salmon drenched in olive oil and capers. Excellent spin on the old sushi habit.\n\nWhat goes best with a meal like this?

All those years I spent eating overpriced, so/so seafood at Fisherman's Wharf when I could've been chowing down on the real deal here! D'oh! Better late than never, I say. \n\nSwan Oyster Depot must be experienced! Get there early and be prepared to wait no matter what time of day. You'll be in a long line with mostly locals and a few \"in the know\" tourists, so strike up a conversation to pass the time. We were sandwiched between a crotchety old lady and a hipster couple who both lived in the area. Great conversations, let me tell you! Parking is super difficult here. You have to park on a busy street (good luck finding a meter). \n\nThe restaurant is nothing fancy with a very small counter and stools with extremely limited seating. The seafood is fresh and delicious. This is an unpretentious, true divey experience. I love dives but even the cleanliness standards here concerned me a bit. \n\nThere was no soap in the bathroom (it's not really even a real bathroom, sort of like a closet with a toilet in it), and I noticed on several occasions the guy behind the counter take cash money out of the register and lick his fingers to separate the bills, then go RIGHT BACK to serving up seafood with his bare hands -- he didn't wash them. Touching dirty money and licking his fingers, then taking his bare hands and scooping out handfuls of shrimp to serve in people's shrimp cocktails. No tongs, no gloves, using his bare hands as \"spoons.\" Ewwww. This happened about 4 times and it sort of made me feel sick to my stomach (minus one star for that). I'd deduct even more stars but this place has such a great atmosphere and such good and fresh seafood that it outweighs the gross factor. \n\nPrices are high but I can't complain because it's the freshest seafood ever.

The Aussie insisted I try the Santa Barbara uni, which I did, and the couple on my right shrieked when they saw the sea urchin's spines were still moving on my plate. This didn't deter my experience with the freshest uni I have ever had. The texture was way less dense than the Hokkaido counterpart, and was almost light as air, strangely enough. Another beautiful dish I got was the off-menu Sicilian sashimi, lightly sprinkled with olive oil, capers and a tad of red onion. Thanks Ben for the great suggestion. My last dish was the superb bottle neck clams. These were so fresh and I could probably live on these. I was comped several sauvignon blanc wines-- the only wine to have with these dishes-- and boy, it was one happy birthday. Ironically, I never tried an oyster.

You sit along the bar and they should really think about expanding to next door since next door is up for lease!  The restaurants' hours are limited as well - closed on Sundays and stays open till 5:30pm!\n\nOne of the more important things while dining is smiling when serving your customers.  It is THE etiquette.  Period.  Our waiter was unhappy that day and his face showed it, clearly.  I felt like whenever I put an order here and there, he took the order as if he couldn't wait for us to finish and get out.  Other than that unpleasant vibe, the seafood was freshly above par.\n\nThe raw oysters tasted the best!  You can really taste the freshness and flavor of the sea oysters!  Yum!\n\nTheir sashimi scallops and salmon was okay.  The sashimi was drenched in olive oil and decorated with capers and chopped onions.  The fresh, sea flavor from the sashimi was taken away from, when the additional ingredients were used.  As for their shrimp cocktail, I have had better.  It was simple.\n\nI know this place is trying to keep it old school by having the menu only on the board, cash solely for tab, keeping this a hole-in-the-wall seafood bar and setting the ambiance as if it was back in the days, but they should really reconsider on expanding and making the hours more convenient!

The seafood here is indeed very fresh, and quite a deal compared to other places in the area.\n\nI highly recommend getting their blue point oysters, kumamotos (these are smaller but quite meaty and flavorful), littleneck clams (these are huge!) and cherry stone clams.

Sea urchin gonads- uni is a delicious delicacy of the sea. It's even better when it is fresh. Lastly, I like the Sicilian style sashimi with capers, lemon juice and olive oil.

This turned out to a miss since all we know about sashimi is the japanese style without much of garnish and sauce, which is everything but for this dish. \n\nVerdit:\nSF locals: please never waste your time here as there are so many places that offer Happy Hour oysters for $1-$2 each. Go there! Or please rent a car and drive up to Tamales Bay to bring home a bag of 50 oysters for $50 from Tomales Bay Oyster Company (unfortunately they had to remove the picnic tables starting Dec 2015 due to some Marin County codes so no more BBQ). \n\nTourists: please plan your trip wisely. It's totally fine to take a picture in front of the restaurant made famous by your beloved Anthony Bourdain but it's not okay to waste 3 hours of your precious time in the beautiful San Francisco (don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE his style and personality.

And remember that it's cash only (bring a lot because it's expensive).\n\nI waited in line for about 1.5 hrs and it wasn't too bad since I was expecting it.

Once you're seated, one of the servers greets you.\n\nI started with the clam chowder, which was okay, but not great. I would avoid this. The broth was watery and had a strong tap water taste to it. The clams, however, were nice and chewy.\n\nI also had the crab salad (Dungeness), which was delicious. Get this! They pile the crab meat very high and have about 4-5 legs included (all unshelled). Be careful though as mine had bits of shell in it. The \"salad\" part is that they place the crab on top of iceburg lettuce, which is no more than garnish in my mind. The bread they serve with this is awesome- crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nCondiments are really nice here- pickled scallions, housemade horseradish, and lots of sauces.\n\nI sat for very long periods of time waiting for my server (he kept ignoring me and tending to other people) but a really nice server ended up helping me out. \n\nThe meal (I thought it was worth the price) with tip came out to ~$40.

We chose to embrace the atmosphere and were handsomely rewarded. We waited for 45 minutes for a spot at the bar and then squeezed on to our two bar stools. From the outset Jimmy, our server (all staff is behind one long bar that seats about 18), entertained us with conversation ranging from our shared Sicilian heritage and politics to instructing my daughter on how to make chicken soup for her college roommates! We felt like family. For the younger generation like my daughter who rarely engage with strangers in public environments, this was a truly memorable experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-28", "description": "Man, how I wanted to love this place...  Let me take you back.  Back to a time before I lived in San Francisco.  I was living in NYC.  It was winter, and it was cold.  I used to spend hours sitting on yelp and google maps, exploring San Francisco from 3000 miles away.  I would look up all the best restaurants.  And visit them on the street.  I browsed through all the yelp photos.  Swan Oyster Depot was one of the first places I spent a lot of time looking up.  Such great reviews.  Fresh seafood at a reasonable price.  Who could ask for anything more, right?  \n\nUnfortunately (due to the fact that there is always a line), it took me a year and a half after moving to SF to finally check out Swan Oyster Depot.  And as you can probably tell from my star rating above, I was wholly underwhelmed.  I went on a Saturday around 1PM.  Not surprisingly there was a long line.  But I decided to wait it out!  It only took an hour, but I finally made it through the doorway.  (Where  I proceeded to wait another 20 minutes).  You see, there were several people who had finished eating, but did not realize this was a \"cash only\" operation.  So people proceeded to find an ATM.  \n\nWhile waiting for these people I noticed that the staff used their bare hands for everything.  Like scooping up the fresh seafood onto people plates or cutting the bread.  I understand people in restaurants use their hands to pick up food.  However they are working with raw seafood, and then with cooked seafood, or people's bread, and then touch money, and then sneeze, or touch their face.  Sure they wash their hands (sometimes) but still.  There is no reason why they couldn't use tongs to pick up the seafood.  Also, they spend a lot of time opening oysters and other things with ice and water, so their hands get wet and slimy.  \n\nI digress, let's talk about the food.  I ordered the crab salad (despite the fact I knew they were going to grab the crab with their hands).  It was actually quite delicious.  Tons of fresh crab over a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce.  The louie sauce was also a perfect accompaniment.  I also tried the cherrystone clams.  The first one I slurped in my mouth had several chunks of shell that I immediately bit into and then had trouble getting them out of my mouth without spitting the whole damn clam out.  Not super appetizing.  The smoked trout was nice.  The raw scallops were delicious and fresh.  \n\nTotal price with tax and tip was $110.  Not totally sure how a crab salad, 6 clams, a small piece of trout, two scallops, a glass of wine, and a pepsi added up to $110, but it is what it is.  I left a little hungry and a little poorer.  \n\nSo why 3 stars (and not 2 or 1) you ask? Well this place is clearly an institution.  The seafood was fresh and delicious.  If you can get over the sanitary conditions of this place, you will probably enjoy your meal.", "author": "Paul W."}

It's a good thing that review #2,400 provides the perfect opportunity for me to describe my maiden voyage to Swan Oyster Depot just this past Friday, a good Good Friday. Now it's not that I'm not familiar with the routine. I've seen that line stretch up Polk Street enough times to realize this is no drop-by place unless you make a serious time commitment. And of course, on TV, I've seen a sauntering Anthony Bourdain sop up the crab fat with chunks of sourdough and follically-challenged Lidia Bastianich get a crab meat removal lesson from one of the brother-owners.\n\nI got up on Good Friday regaling in the fact that I didn't have to go to work but thinking maybe parked on my sofa watching episodes of Pioneer Woman and Barefoot Contessa was not the best use of my time. I happened to browse Yelp and came upon the knowledge that Swan Oyster Depot opens at 10:30AM during the week. I confirmed that by calling them and finding out that market orders start at 8AM but that the diner part itself opens at 10:30. Hmmm, maybe today is the day I try it since I can just hop on the 19 and be there by around 10:15. Smart move as it turned out since there were already a dozen people waiting.\n\nOK, I'll wait since I assume I could get a seat during the first wave of seating. I was right again, and as I was a solitary diner, I gladly accommodated the availability of the weird, higher-than-norm stool in the middle since no one else was willing to take it. Hey, the increased elevation doesn't alter my dining experience. Funny thing was that all the to-go orders were laid out in front of me, so they had to move the white butcher paper and cartons around the counter to serve me. As I was staring intently at the menu on the wall, I was asked by one of the veteran servers whether I wanted a cup of Clam Chowder ($5) and some (Sourdough) Bread and Butter for an extra buck (see photo).\n\nThe soup was not the calorific creaminess one would expect at a Fisherman's Wharf eatery but a far more briney broth with the freshness of the clams most prominent. I went next with the alluring $21 Combination Seafood Salad. Just look at my photo. I've never seen such a luxuriant pile of crab, prawns, shrimp, lobster and calamari in my life. I couldn't even see the shredded iceberg lettuce at the bottom of the plate, but the Louie dressing was drizzled quite gently on top making all the seafood glisten under the florescent lights. Delicious, fresh and clearly more seafood than one human should eat at a single sitting. But I wasn't about to leave. No, I was determined to try the $18 Sea Urchin.\n\nIt came in small fillets in a huge spiny shell (see photo). I remember seeing the look of rapture on the face of La Folie's Roland Passot when he ate this with Bourdain on his show (see photo). So fresh that Jiro would approve, I'm sure, and the delicious flavor was subtle which I dared to kick up a notch with some hot sauce. Enough already? I don't think so. How can you visit an oyster depot and not have oysters. For $14, I ordered a half-dozen of the Blue Point Oysters with a sundae goblet of cocktail sauce (see photo). By now, it was quite clear this was one of the freshest seafood meals I've ever had in this city or frankly anywhere outside the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...fresh seafood they've prepared for over a century...I think they have it right now\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...like eating in a shack on an East Coast pier...part of its charm\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...hectic, friendly and never hurried...another part of its charm...oh and bring cash, lots of it :-)\nTOTAL - 5 stars...so I can finally check it off the bucket list...it was getting embarrassing", "author": "Ed U."}

I know everyone raves about goin to Boudin SF, but it's a chain. I could just get it back home at downtown disney so I opted to find the best clam chowder there is in SF. Yelp led me to Swan Oyster Depot and it didn't steer me wrong\n\nThis sounds weird but I was happy to see a long line out the door when we got there around noon. Long line = food is good 'cause it's worth waiting for! It's a small store w/ just one counter that people sit at to eat. Luckily the to-go line was a lot shorter so we got a cup and a bowl of clam chowder to go as well as the combo seafood salad.\n\nClam chowder - Light yet hearty. This is a little different than most clam chowders 'cause it's not thick, but the flavor is definitely there. The sourdough bread that came w/ the chowders were separated w/ these paper lookin things but it's actually butter! The bread was definitely SOURdough since it was sour. It paired well w/ the butter and clam chowder. I wish there were more clams though.\n\nCombo Seafood salad - MUST GET THIS. It was bout $20 and wasn't much of a \"salad\" It was lettuce and lots and lots of seafood. The combo has shrimp (small ones), prawns, and crab. The prawns were big and super fresh and sweet!! Felt like they were just caught! Crab was sweet as well.\n\nHint: If you order to-go, the sizes are a cup, bowl, and pint. I would say go for the bowl size. Service is very friendly, but I was a bit concerned when they were preparing the salad with their bare hands, grabbing the seafood from the bins in front of the display window. I didn't get any food poisoning so it means they're pretty good at sanitizing their hands :)", "author": "Tracie L."}

Oysters were highlight - very clean and fresh tasting with lots of mignonette and other accompaniments. Prawn cocktail was very good as well, featuring large and plump shrimp doused in good cocktail sauce (pre-doused, don't expect to dip yourself). Clam chowder really did not stick out to me; I'm not a connoisseur of chowder, it usually either merits a good or bad... this was meh. Friend's crab back was so fishy and cold that I'm not sure how Bourdain called it the \"nectar of gods\", but maybe just preference in levels of fishiness.\n\nService is ad-hoc, you just kind of yell at the guys working behind the counter.

To avoid the long line up, we decided to head there bight and early at 10:30am their opening time. The place was filled up right away and a line start forming outside, who would have guess there would be so many people who want oysters for breakfast.\n\nIt was a very narrow space with the bar running through the whole space with memorabilia and old pictures of the place\n\nLove the setup in front of us with the crackers, mignonette, fresh horseradish and lemons\n\n\nWe were quickly offered some Sourdough Bread with tons of butter... Sourdough is basically synonym with San Francisco, I wonder if every restaurant there serve just that?! Don't get me wrong I like sourdough but I tend to prefer it on it's own with butter since the flavor is pretty strong, I find it a bit overpowering paired with other food.\n\nClam Chowder Bowl\n~ Full of clams and potatoes, it wasn't very thick and heavy as I expected but still felt very hearty.\n\nClam Cocktail\n~ All freshly shuck with all the juices served with a huge bowl of their cocktail sauce on the side.\n~ Love how they kept all the salty sweet juices since it's pure goodness.\n~ I thought the cocktail sauce was a bit too sweet, I prefer it a lot better on it's own since it was so fresh and sweet.\n\nDozen Oyster\n~ Our server did carefully explain each of the oysters but we obviously didn't have time it mark it down before digging in. \n\nCrab Back\n~ This wasn't on the menu but eyed it by their window and I just had to ask if we can order it.\n~ We usually call it Crab Shell but we were told that it should be Crab back and yes we can order it on it's own.\n~ I was in heaven, after sharing one it was just not enough so we decided to order a 2nd one. \n~ SO GOOD!!! Wish we could have gone back for another round before leaving.\n~ Love my Crab fat! \n\nNote: Cash Only\n\nVerdict:\n~ The seafood is as fresh as you can get but love the atmosphere above all with regulars chatting away while waiting for their takeouts and deliveries all happening in the small space/counter.", "author": "Vickie C."}

It's been in my bookmark list for quite some time, but this past saturday, the bf and I finally checked it out. We arrived around 2:30, and got seated after half hour or so. Wasn't too bad of a wait (I think the morning rain helped disperse the crowd). Adding to the hoards of rave reviews, I would also regard this establishment as a must-try. It is essentially a fish market rather than a restaurant, and seating involves rusty stools and a narrow counter. There were tons of jacket/purse hooks all around. All of this adds to the charm of the place.\n\nWe started with a small plate of sashimi. Delicious! I've never had sashimi with these flavors (olive oil, salt, pepper, capers, shallots) but it was so refreshing. My first bite was the scallop and I seriously could've eaten an entire plate of just those. Then came a half dozen of a mixed plate of oysters. So good eaten simply with the mignonette. Then the crab back was something new and very adventurous for me, but OMG, dipped in the bread, it was creamy and luscious. I never thought it would taste as good as it did, and I would come back just for bread and a crab back. Super indulgent and only about $6! We also got a crab cocktail, and I made basically mini open-faced sandwiches lol. Bread, a layer of horseradish, crab meat, and then topped with some cocktail sauce. $15 for a generous bowl of crab meat and no need to get my hands dirty, soo worth it. We finished the meal with a cup of their clam chowder, and it was very homestyle. A thinner chowder with some potatoes and a few clam pieces here and there, but big clam flavor. I was stuffed. The bill came out to around $55 before tip.\n\nService was good. Each group kinda gets their own guy/gal to help them (they may have 2-3 groups) so it's pretty personable. Our first guy was friendly enough but he kinda made a face when I asked for sashimi (it's not on their official menu). After our 2nd course, we heard him say bye to his coworkers, but he didn't say anything to us, so then another guy took us on as customers. Kinda awkward. Other than that, it was a great experience. We ate a lot of really good seafood, and it didn't break the bank! Just make sure you bring plenty of cash.", "author": "Rita L."}

Luckily, there was a coffee shop down the street that kept us warm!\n\nThe interior at Swan Oyster Depot resembles that of a fish market. Don't come here expecting a pristine table and restroom.. you won't get either.\n\nWe started our meal with a bowl of clam chowder and some bread. Now, when one thinks of clam chowder, you'd think of this homogeneous white bowl of substance with yummy clams and potatoes. Visually? it looked gross. If you've ever been to Orenchi and ate their ramen full of broth with lard pieces swimming in it, you'll know what I'm talking about. It literally looked like lard pieces were swimming around in my soup! Nevertheless, it tasted amazing! Not too creamy or filling. However, I would have liked more clams in my bowl. I think I ate like 2 or 3.. the rest were potatoes! booo I'm not trying to carbo-load before I feast!\n\nNext we were blessed with a combo of a dozen oysters on the half shell. All were cleaned beautifully, with my favorite from Great Britain. Then we had an order of the smoked salmon, which I actually did not particularly enjoy. While the salmon was deliciously salty, the bread underneath it was soft and chewy. I would rather have had it toasted, and I think that would have improved the dish significantly. They were out of the cherry stone clams, so we opted for the (last!) uni and half a dozen eggs (sliced scallops topped with a dot of sriracha). First, the scallops- they were deliciously rich with just the right amount of spice. I loved it.. but not as much as I loved the uni. I've had fresh uni before, but only at the farmer's market and they don't clean anything for you. However, here at Swan Oyster was probably one of the best preparations of uni I've ever had. It was so beautifully cleaned, with the uni flesh all sitting together nicely on a portion of its shell. Drool.

Well, wasn't disappointed at all! Great place to have a fresh sea food in san Francisco, nice & fast service though cash only, which might be the blocker for someone.\n\nLast our visit this December it was raining cats and dogs, so there weren't many people in a line and we got by the counter in less than a few minutes. In sunny days however, there could a line to wait for about 20-30 minutes. But it still worth of it.

The most wonderful parts of this place are in the fresh fish, its history, and they hospitality of the staff. The only item I would not recommend is the clam chowder. I had my husband taste it too just to make sure, but something is off about it...at least it was when we visited or it was just not to our taste. This tradition of this place is one of the draws - but they might want to change this one dish. On the other hand the rest of the food was wonderful. I highly recommend the dozen eggs off the secret menu (thinly sliced raw scallop with dots of hot sauce on a ponzu sauce) My other favorites were where the very fresh beautifully cooked seafood was the star in the crab and shrimp cocktails. We also really enjoyed the Sicilian Sushi (scallop, salmon, halibut, Ahi and white tuna with olive oil, capers, and onion) We added a little lemon and it was beautiful! Oysters were super fresh and the sauces were nice. This place brings out the best in both tourists and locals - lots of conversations in line and at the bar -  all sharing their favorites and excitement about this special place.

I liken it to visiting Alcatraz. Tourists from all over line up to try it, but locals tend to stay away. The major hurdle for me has been the line. It took nearly an hour to get three stools at the very end of the long bar. \n\nThe thing I love about this place is its iconic look. It seems as if nothing has changed for the past hundred years from the friendly service to the way they handle the check (written on the back of a napkin and cash only). It's something everyone must try once. We started our late lunch with the clam chowder. This is classic clam chowder at its finest. You get plenty of flavor without the thick, creamy texture. Add on the sliced sourdough bread and you have the perfect starter. Next, we had the crab cocktail. Simple, fresh crabmeat served in a glass cup with a side of tartar sauce. Lastly, we had an order of a dozen mixed oysters sans the smaller kumamotos. The oysters were some of the best I've ever had. Since our server was late on our order of oysters, our Anchor Steam beer was on the house. That's the kind of service that will keep this local to go back. \n\nThe price for seafood isn't cheap so come prepared to spend.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Luckily fate intervened and I randomly saw this joint with a huge line on my way to a tuxedo rental shop with my bf. Since he had to return the tux a few days later, I figured we'd drop by then. Best seafood EVER. Best of all, it was a Monday, and we were 2nd in line after opening and people were seated. Unfortunately it was our last full day in SF so we opted to take everything to go so we didn't get the full experience.\n\nWe ordered the seafood salad and clam chowder. Seafood salad was amazing and such a huge portion! I also saw the guy making it and he was actually careful to pick out some huge chunks of meat to go into the salad. You know how there are some places that purposely go and pick the small crap to go into our food? Not this one. What made the salad was the Louie dressing. It's unbelievably tasty. On the other hand, the clam chowder wasn't what I'm used to. It had the clam flavor and the clams, but it was a bit watery.\n\nFrom what I've heard, they might not have something you want on certain days. The day we were there, they didn't have uni and something else, which the photographer behind us was telling us about, so just be sure it's not a deal breaker (otherwise you're going to be very disappointed when you wait for an hour+ in line and not get what you want). I'll be back to Swan Oyster Depot for sure the next time I'm in SF, and hopefully they have everything on my list.\n\nAlso cash only, which sucks because ordering a lot can get tricky.

There is very limited seating here and it fills up quickly so I learned to show up as they opened at 10:30 on weekdays to avoid a wait.\n\nCrab Louie - 2/5 - Disappointing. The salad itself was just a pile of what felt like low quality greens. The dressing was a less than impressive thousand island and the amount of crab they give on top is just not large enough to make this deserving of the $23 they charge. It's not worthy of the top 100 list and definitely not worth the price. Skip.\nHalf cracked crab - 3/5 - I have had better crab. I'm not saying it wasn't decent, because it was, but I think there are better places to get straight crab dishes. The total amount of crab attained is shown in the picture below. Also not worthy of a top 100 spot.\nChowder - 1/5 - Pretty sure this came out of a can. If it didn't, that's even more disheartening because it certainly tasted like something you'd buy at the grocery store.\nSmoked salmon - 5/5 - I loved this dish. The quality of the salmon was so good and seeing it sliced right in front of you off of a massive fish made it that much better. A generous portion of slices on top of french bread with oil and capers resulted in an extremely smooth and delicious taste. This is what should have made the 7x7 list and not the various crab items.\nOysters - I'm not going to rate the oysters because oysters are almost always good and these were no different. There's just not enough to differentiate oysters from one place to another aside from cost.\n\nOverall, Swan Oyster Depot disappointed me numerous times but did end up coming through on my last visit with an amazing salmon dish. If I do ever end up coming back here, the smoked salmon will be my reason for returning. \"I'm a fan.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

The Crab here is to die for and the clam chowder was made right before I ordered a bowl. I watched him shuck the clams while making it. Every bite I bit into had clams. Can you say, \"True Love?\". Next I ordered a plate of lox. They cut front a large salmon  right in front of me then added capers and sliced tomatoes.  Damn! I'm totally craving it right now.

When placed in front of me, I was astonished (!) that it was broken, meaning the milk was curdled by being tossed in too hot a liquid. It was very, very unappetizing to look at, and as anyone who cooks knows, is texturally displeasing. At $5 a bowl, it was manageable, and I finished it somehow (because one must not waste!). The $1 butter + bread helped. But never again. Also...this in no way reminded me of the clam chowder I had while in Boston, which was muy muy better.\n\nThe crab salad was yummy, but not worth $15 for the small size.

Certainly amongst the best breakfasts. \n\nYeah, you read that right. Swan Oyster Depot officially opens at 8am but really opens whenever they're ready to serve. For us, we got there at 10am, were told 20 minutes, and came back around that time later ready to eat. Fresh seafood and Anchor Steam for breakfast? That garners an \"America, F Yeah\" fist pump.\n\nFor those living under a rock or that don't read anyone else's Yelp reviews but mine, service is old-school counter, with about 20 seats available as first-come, first-serve. With a large party, we tried to get there early but already found four people there when we entered. As we left, the line was four deep and no doubt about to get longer.\n\nThe servers are a bit churlish with the diners, but they share an unspoken snarkiness with each other. It's an attitude that shouts, \"man, I'm dang lucky to be working at a timeless place like this.\" It's a great ambiance if you embrace it. Like poetry in motion. The \"dirtiness\" in the reviews is overrated: Swan Oyster Depot looks, feels, and smells like a damn good seafood diner.\n\nOur menu read thusly: Clam Chowder. Oyster Sampler. Cracked Crab. Smoked Salmon. Quick review: Everything phenomenal. Words can't do justice.\n\nThe clam chowder is brothy, not overly thick, and a wonderful, eye-opening starter. The hot and cold contrast of clam to Anchor, chowder to Steam is ridiculously tasty. Crackers provided but not needed.\n\nThe oysters are fresh beyond belief and taste like they've come right out of the ocean. Squeeze of lemon, scoop of horseradish, dash of Tabasco. Winner winner, oyster breakfast.\n\nThe crab, piled high on the back counter, comes perfectly cracked for easy consumption. Just steamed, it's all-natural, delectable crab taste. If your lips aren't smacking by now, I can't help you. Try with the Louis sauce and you will be, guaranteed.\n\nThe smokiness of the salmon on perfectly textured French bread is like a perfect dessert.

All the praise proved to be true, while I believe any criticism to likely stem from isolated incidents of grumpy a-holes having bad days. I mean, how can you not love this place?!\n\nWith only 19 seats at the bar and a line stacking up outside, be prepared to wait. Once inside you'll find yourself plopped at the counter, elbow to elbow with the strangers next to you. The menu rests on the wall in front of you and just like everything else in the restaurant it appears to be close to if not original. Sure, I took a look at the menu ahead of me, but thankfully I also browsed Yelp for some menu selection inspiration. I'd look at my phone, then the wall, my phone again, the wall again... decisions, decisions. This is where things take a turn for the absolute best.\n\nI stumble upon a picture of the \"Sicilian Sashimi,\" check the menu, check the picture, check the menu, check the picture. Dammit! It's not on the menu. I casually ask our server, (who is also our busboy, stand up comedian, chef and one of the owners) if they have it and he replies, \"yeah, it's just not on the menu.\" I quickly replied, \"I'll take it!\" What arrived a few minutes later was a beautiful plate of assorted fresh fish. Thinly sliced, roughly arranged, topped with onions, capers and drizzled with olive oil - it was a thing of beauty. So beautiful in fact that it almost stopped the restaurant in its tracks and I spent the next minute or two fielding questions from other diners, \"what is THAT?!\" The answer is: heaven on earth. With every bite I'd set down my fork, stare at the plate and savor what was happening in my mouth. After serving up my plate I almost felt bad as about four other plates of the Sicilian Sashimi were ordered while our chef/server stated, \"it happens every time.\"\n\nSure, the wait is long but the food and service is absolutely excellent. It's more than just a meal... an experience, a trip back in time, a San Francisco right of passage. Sit down, take it all in and of course, order the Sicilian Sashimi.", "author": "Brad B."}

They have the usual hot + cocktail sauce but they have these housemade relish like sauces on the bar--reach for the jalapeno one! SO GOOD.\n\nWe also ordered a mixed salad. Although everyone on Yelp suggested the crab, why limit yourself to 1 meat when you can have 4--or was it 5? From what I could remember, the mixed salad had 2 types of crab and 2 types of shrimp (sml + lrg) piled atop a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. Again, all at the peak of freshness.

My cousin's hubby was intrigued enough to try his first raw oyster... and fell in love, naturellement! :)\n\nI also tried the smoked salmon on rye, but my favorite by far was the raw scallops.  Sliced thinly and served in a mixture of olive oil, salt, pepper, and sprinkled with capers and red onion, this was truly heaven on a plate!

We'd thought there won't be much of a crowd since it's a weekday at a some-what off hour. We couldn't be more wrong! The line for a seat was out the door and spanned two store fronts. It took us 1.5 hours to get in the door and at that point, we didn't want to wait any longer so we didn't even sit together! \n\nWe split up into two's and two of us ordered a bowl of clam chowder ($5), dozen of mixed oysters ($26), sashimi plate ($18), and an Anchorsteam ($4). I didn't have the chowder, but I heard it was really good. It's not super creamy and filling, and it had a big chunks of clams. The mixed oysters had three varieties: Mi Yagi, Blue Point and Kumamoto. They were really fresh and excellent! It tasted great just by itself with a  splash of lemon. The sashimi was SUPERB! There was salmon, tuna and scallops. Everything was extremely fresh, succulent, and sweet (the natural kind of sweetness). It was drizzled with olive oil, lemon juice, capers, and raw red onions. I pushed the onions to the side because it overpowered the fresh fish. This was one of the best sashimi plates I've had!\n\nThe other two of our party ordered at least twice as much: clams, oysters, chowder, crab, wine, bread, etc etc.... and their total was less than ours! It was because they had some sort of connection with UC Berkeley. He asked what they ordered and after, basically said, \"Uhh, just give me $40.\" Haha!\n\nAnyways, Swan Oyster Depot offers really fresh seafood, but I would not wait 1.5 hours next time. It might have been that it was a holiday that there was more people than normal.", "author": "Leslie P."}

(Pray you aren't served by the 1 or two 20something Cali hipsters & their 'young' smartypants attitudes)....I digress....\nAfter a long wait (got in line @ 3pm on a Wed, seated @ 430pm) we ordered.\nAgain, *our* service was great.\n\nCrab/Lobster salad: was 80% lettuce. The few bits of crab and lobster seemed like they'd be good had there been enough to taste...they do have all kinds of hot sauces available & plenty of lemons out for the grabbing (awesome cuz I hate having to beg for lemon everywhere else!!!)\nClam chowder: you should know for $2.75 a cup that it's gonna be crap. We did, ordered it anyway to warm up after the long cold/windy 2 hour wait outside. Yeah its weak, but again, it's just a warm up (like tea).\nSupposedly no Uni/urchin available...lanky hipster moustache young guy behind counter claims not til September (i think he's full of sh\u00a1t, since you can get it at ANY Japanese spot year round..this is SF, wtf??) I feel like he just didnt want to get stuck w serving it as they were nearing closing time. Maybe im being judgemental. Maybe I just didn't like his face. Or his corny tatoos.\nClam cocktail-small and meh. Again you can dress it how you like but its still too small to really matter.\nBest tasting items were the too-tough-to-comfortably-chew complimentary bread, & the side of Louie our server gave us to eat w it.\nWe ordered a crab back (to dunk the bread in, since the bread was the best thing going for this spot), it too was 'just okay' after doctoring w lemon & hot sauce & pepper & more lemon & salt- you get it, bland.\nActually, everything we had was, well bland. Mostly small portions of actual seafood, which is a bummer. \nThis food is waaay overpriced. The experience is waaaaay overated. You will be hungry an hour later. Being lucky enough to score the attendant w the best service attitude of the bunch is why im bumping up from 2 to three stars. Even if I was ridiculously rich, like gentrification, tech-nerd rich, I STILL wouldn't come back.\nDo it *once*, write the $100+ expenditure off as a 1 time thing, & join me in realizing that anyplace Bourdain visits on his TV show is an overpriced, no-flavor tourist trap. At this point its pretty obvious he's just helping out his restaurant-owner homies worldwide.\nF- you Anthony.

The concept here is nothing but San Francisco's freshest seafood cooked to perfection, or not cooked in the case of sashimi.   The only seating is along a bar on stools which are well worn and not the most comfortable.  The food is wonderful if you are in the mood for seafood.\n\nThe sour dough bread we were served was the best sour dough I have ever eaten.  With the pure butter, I could have easily made a meal on that alone.  We tried several dishes.  The crab meat cocktail was very good, very visually appealing presentation as was everything.  The West coast crab we don't find quite as flavorful as Eastern blue crab but nonetheless was very good.  My son tried the Sicilian style Sashimi and found it outstanding.  The scallops were his personal favorite.  The clam chowder was very good, rich and with a nice clam flavor.    I had a crab Louie salad which I would describe as a \"naked\" crab Louie because it was stripped to the essentials- lettuce, generous serving of crab and a rich, creamy Louie dressing.  Everything went together perfectly.   We tried a crab back with the awesome bread and found it very good.  We think we would have enjoyed it more if served warm, rather than cold.  Service was very fast, the staff extremely friendly and accommodating, and no sense of rush or hurry once you were seated.\n\nWe got here around 11 on a Tuesday morning and only had about a 45 minute wait.  Be prepared for a very rough time watching all the seafood being served before your eyes as you stand with your salivary glands getting overstimulated.  We noticed several people avoiding the line and ordering seafood for carryout.

Still though - good food.\n\nThe seafood is fresh and everything we got was very pure and tasty. Nothing was overly sauced or prepared. Quite the opposite in fact. Given the raw ingredients, you could have prepared everything at home. But that's the point... you don't have access to this quality of ingredients and they do. \n\nWe had the combination platter (shrimp/prawn/crab + louie dressing), mixed dozen of oysters,  sashimi plate, and clam chowder. The chowder was very unique and tasty with a broth that had an ocean water taste ... in a good way. The sashimi plate also had a phenomenal sample of scallops, though the rest was pretty mediocre in terms of sushi quality. The rest? Exactly as it sounds. Don't expect to be overly impressed and you won't be disappointed. Just good, quality seafood. \n\nPrice? Very very fair, especially with the hype. $75 for 2 people, 2 beers (and 2 free while waiting outside) ... and we were very full.\n\nCustomer service? Also very good, though I am at odds here. They do in fact treat you like locals and don't rush anyone... though if they did, they could theoretically reduced the wait, right?\n\nThe wait... this is the reason for not getting that 5th star. The simple question I asked myself and my wife is, \"would I wait 1.75 hours again?\" Clear no. Too many good options in SF, and this food actually lends itself really good to takeout anyway.\n\nOverall, not mad that I waited, but wouldn't do it again.", "author": "Jake D."}

When I ordered, I made sure to confirm that I wanted the crab butter twice.  He confirmed, I confirmed.  No crab butter.  \nHot smoked salmon platter:  Very well smoked, delicious and fresh.  Apparently, we could have went without the shrimp salad on the side and gotten more salmon.  \nMixed dozen oysters:  All very fresh, came with 5 or 6 varieties.  Their toppings were excellent.  I loved their thai chili sauce with their mignonette.  \nClam chowder:  I'm not sure this was very good.  It wasn't super salty so that's a plus but the soup was curdled.  Meh.\nSicilian sashimi:  Not revolutionary but the fish was very fresh and tasty.  He put scallops, hamachi, salmon and tuna on there, drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with capers and red onions.  I embellished with some salt and lemon juice.  Delicious.\n\nIf you get the cold smoked salmon, be aware that some of the guys there are more generous than others.

I love the memorabilia and the family atmosphere.  The guys are not overly friendly but they are lovely and consistently awesome in service provided.  I always look forward to seeing them in action when I come.\n\nI just love it here and if I ever move away from SF and come back to visit, this would be the first restaurant on my list.\n\nBut please don't come, and definitely don't come and be an overly sensitive brat, I will give you the stink eye if I am in line behind you and hear you complaining about the wait.  Cash only and bring plenty because after two hours in line you are going to want to sample everything.  I usually spend about $55 - 80 / pp on lunch.  Worth every penny and food is very reasonably prices (even under priced for the exceptional quality).", "author": "Kate R."}

Fresh fish and crustaceans, a brightly lite interior, bar seating, and lines out the door.\n\nOne of the places on my must go list upon my last visit to San Francisco.  Little did I know that Anthony Bourdain was there, it just looked like a not so small hole in the wall that serves up delicious food.\n\nOrdered a dozen miyagis to start (half were local, half from washington state), crab cocktail, and got convinced into trying a clam chowder.  No complaints, I've never had such thick claim chowder and I don't mean thickened by corn starch kind of thick.  The flavor was also very rich.\n\nMiyagis were local to the area.  I'm from the east coast, so I really wanted to try stuff that is harder to get when I'm at home.  If I'm not mistake the Washington state miyagis were more plump.  Both were delicious once I added some mignonette and cocktail sauce.\n\nCrab cocktail was a win.  \n\nTried the famed \"Italian Style Sashimi\"  it was good, but I didn't appreciate the way that pieces came almost diced in the small order.  Our neighbor ordered a medium or a large and it was cut nicer.  The Scallop was the only one that stood out for me here.  The Tuna and Yellowtail were fresh but nothing spectacular.  They also claimed to have sadine, but someone it got squeezed out of the small order, since our neighbor got it.\n\nFinished off with half a dozen Blue Point Clams.  Generally, I love oysters so much more than clams that I don't pay attention to the clams, but these guys looked so plump and orange that I really wanted to try them.  A bit fishy as expected, but I concocted a perfect combination with lemon juice, mignonette and tartar sauce.\n\nOh, how I wish there was a place like this in New York.

We were driving to Napa Valley from San Diego and went through San Francisco specifically to visit Swan's. Unfortunately this was a completely different experience. After waiting outside for the customary 30 minutes or so, we crammed onto the customarily uncomfortable bar stool with the eager expectation of what was to come...unfortunately instead of the owner waiting on us, we got his son. He left us waiting 15 minutes while he dealt with carry out orders while the people seated at the same time next to us were working through their chowder, seafood salad and beer. Once we got the owners sons attention, we wanted to order everything at once. This included full orders of Sicilian sashimi and a \"dozen eggs\" (sushi style scallops with ponzu). The last time at Swans the father steered us to these items and gave us beautiful and generous portions of both. The son told us we didn't need this much and we should get half portions. We went with his recommendations and were very surprised to see that the \"eggs\" amounted to one scallop sliced into six portions and the Sicilian sashimi was a tiny saucer plate of about nine uber thin slices of mini sashimi. Meanwhile the ponzu on the scallops dish had a fizzy taste and had clearly been left out and was fermenting. The condiments for the oysters are also left sitting out on the counter without lids and seemed sketchy and not sanitary. Additionally we noticed them plating seafood with their bare hands, then handling people's cash (the dirtiest thing you can touch), then go back to plating seafood without washing their hands. Overall it just seemed dirty and unsanitary. Then when it comes to paying the bill, it seemed like the owners son just made up the prices, they don't show you a bill, (which is supposed to be charming), and we ended up paying $143 for an extremely overpriced lunch (from which we left hungry), in a dirty seafood shop sitting on cramped stools with a tiny area to eat the food.

For me I got the following:\n\nClam Chowder- The clam chowder was delicious and there were alot of clams.  The only thing that i didnt like was the fact that it was a little too watery for me.  I like my clam chowder thick.\n\nCrab fat:  The crab fat was delicious.  My only gripe was that i wish they had prepared it hot like most places.  Instead the crab fat was actually served cold which was a little weird but still good.\n\nScallop and salmon sashimi platter- The scallops, salmon and sashimi was almost like a little sampler since it essentially had a little of each of their favorite items.  It was fresh and they thinly slice them and plate them right in front of you.\n\n1/2 dozen Oysters- Due to the fact that i could not decide which oysters to get, i decided to get their sampler which consisted of 6 oysters (Blue Points, Miyagis, and Kumamotos).  Blue points were my favorite as it had more of a stronger and cleaner oyster taste.\n\nSea urchin- Last but not least i got the Sea Urchin also known as Uni.  It was served as fresh as you can get them.  It was not prepared ahead of time...instead  they literally cut it open right in front of you, clean it and serve it to you in its shell right then and there.", "author": "Derrick C."}

I get that but look at it from my point of view.  Every time we pass by this place there is a line out the door.  Yet, when we think oysters we have a favorite spot ( not going to say where, I don't want it ruined).  Finally the big day, we stood in line, finally got a seat and the first thing I noticed, only one type of oyster.  Further, they were not even on display.  We started with a bowel of clam chowder.  It was oily and if that was cream it was separated.  I think they used Coffee Mate.  There were a few lumps of potato and for sure, no visible clams.  The shrimp salad looked like chopped lettuce and a mound of bay shrimp.  That was it.  I can get that at Costco and it has more ingredients.  We started looking at the other dishes being served and said enough was enough.  This place is playing on the fact that it has been there forever and not on how great the food is now.  The oyster bar that all others should be compared against is Felix's in the French Quarter.  Swan has a long way to go.", "author": "craig u."}

Having said that, that seafood is delicious and fresh! While not exactly cheap, the price is still quite reasonable AND you can buy the seafood wholesale by the pound for a very good deal. I had an amazing sicilian sashimi platter with olive oil, capers, and onions, based on a Yelp picture that I saw and asked one of the guys to reconstruct. He was very friendly and really happy to oblige and recreated a version with really amazing seafood, including seasonal scallops which were some of the best I had in the Bay Area. When I asked him how much it would cost (since it was off-menu) he said for a small plate it would cost me $10-$12. \n\nAt the end of the meal, when a different person came to get the check, he was rude and said that my food would cost me $22. When I informed him that the guy who made the food said it would cost me $10-$12, he didn't even blink and randomly changed the price to $15. I'm not sure where these pricing points are coming from, and I didn't want to argue over $3/5 so I just counted that as tip and paid him.

I was SO wrong. Their seafood is amazingly fresh and tasty. Their clam chowder, with the thin soupy broth that I prefer, is probably one of the best chowders I've ever had. Their smoked salmon was definitely the best I've had in my life -- perfectly smoky and perfectly salty, with a very fresh, meaty texture. Their crab salad was piled with tons of fresh crab. Okay, I'm a big fan of uni but I didn't like that one as much --- as Tiffany C. mentioned, it has a slight floral taste to it, which turned me off. The texture of it felt a little strangely dry, too.. but maybe that's how uber-fresh uni is supposed to taste?\n\nAnyway, when I have some time to kill in the middle of the day and don't mind a wait, I'll definitely come back here to satisfy my seafood cravings!", "author": "Kazu O."}

Fresh oysters straight out of the bay and was it yummy.\n\nThe price is a little meh, but what do you expect getting food this fresh? I ordered a cocktail as well as some oysters, in addition to some clam chowder. I really enjoyed my experience here, however it did seem a bit cramped. I'm not going to complain about that though, I would recommend you to come on a weekday instead of a weekend as I have heard the restaurant cutting the line when it comes close to closing time. \n\nOverall, this place is a have to go to kind of spot.

From what I understand, this place is not just a restaurant, but sells fresh fish for take home, as well so the morning catch is fresh as can be. A fellow foodie in San Fran implored me to NOT go to Fisherman's Wharf, but to check this place out. I arrived around 4:30 and people were still waiting to get into this tiny little diner-esque spot. Decor is no frills wood paneled walls and a long bar with just a few tables all decorated with one bud in a tasteful vase.\n\nRight before closing a seat opened up at the bar and I was beckoned over by a nice waiter in a white shucking smock who asked me if I wanted a drink. I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc and he whipped a bottle from an ice filled bus bin and took my order for the Clam Chowder, Shrimp Cocktail and 6 beautiful Oysters.\n\nThe Chowder arrived piping hot with tender clams and potatoes swimming in a creamy broth. There was a lot of flavour to be had here. My shrimp were plump and juicy, firm and fresh with a cocktail sauce that the waiter eagerly adjusted with some killer hot sauce for my palate from hell.\n\nThe oysters were fresh, sweet and tasted of the salt sea water. A little lemon and some fresh horseradish and I am a happy gal indeed. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, the waiter wiggled the wine bottle in the air and raised his eye brows at me. I frowned, because I had to drive. He said \"It's just a bit. On the house, and you take a nice walk before you drive!\" I liked this guy and I loved Swan.

All the employees I've seen at Swan Oyster Depot seemed to live up to this mantra very well: they were all extremely professional and proficient at their job; they would tell you straight up what's good and what's bad (in terms of the catch); and they accommodate based on your needs (need food to take out? no problem! a party of three but only two chairs? your friend can stand if he's cool with it). Even the customers (the regulars, as I have come to understand) here on my particular visit were very understanding: they would scoot down further in the narrow counter place so other can sit--one lady offered me her spot because she believed that soup should not be consumed standing up. Only in San Francisco.\n\nAtmosphere\nSwan Oyster Depot is smack-dab in the middle of Nob Hill, which due to the nature of the residents that inhabit the area, are one of the more pleasant and \"cultured\" parts of town, and by way of semantic inference, the least offensive part of town. I won't bore you by going into details about how Nob Hill was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake, and its resurgence to the heights of affluence that it has currently attained is a testament to the will and fighting spirit of the San Franciscan people, since I assume you probably know that already.\n\nClam Chowder\nEvery now and then, I like to blaspheme and proclaim that x has the best y that I've ever tasted  in z. I would like to invite anyone to try Swan Oyster Depot's clam chowder and tell me you've had a clammier, richer chowder. I will gladly pay top dollar to anyone who can indeed point me to the right direction.\n\nFlorid and pseudo-intellectual discussions aside, the Combination Salad is a culinary dream come true and a must-have. From what I've been told by others who have frequented this place before me, the ingredients that go on the salad changes every now and then, but I got a soiree of shrimp, prawn, smoked salmon, and another smoked fish that I cannot remember for the life of me. \n\nFor those of you (like I've done myself) that are planning on ordering the Sea Urchin (or Uni, to you foodies) because you've seen millions of pictures of it floating around on your friends' instagram feeds, the type of Sea Urchin that they serve here is different from those typically plated in Japanese sushi restaurants, and has kind of a paint/chemical-like after taste.

Not fancy.  Most of the time there is a line to get in but the day I came my friend and I were able to walk in and grab 2 free seats (the only 2 seats in the place available).  You order from the menu that is up on the wall.  Ask about what was just brought in off the boats.  There is a window in the front packed with ice that has the fresh seafood on it.\n\nI had the raw oysters and crab salad.  Of course I had an Anchor Steam beer on tap with that.  No excuse not to drink some with your seafood (unless you are not a drinker).  \n\nSoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo great.

I waited close to two hours before being seated.  What makes this probably one of the worst waits ever is the fact that you have to stay in line as opposed to putting your name down and coming back in 30 or so minutes.\n\nIt's bar seating only and it can get pretty cramped in there.  But the staff is super friendly and when one of the guys noticed I didn't have a place to hang my coat or purse he found some space for my stuff on the side.\n\nWhen you sit down you'll notice a variety of sauces on top that's more or less a free for all.  I saw Tobasco, horseradish, etc.\n\nWe had the infamous clam chowder.  I see how some people really like it and others don't.  I personally didn't.  I wouldn't even really consider it a chowder since chowders are usually a stew or thickened soup often made with cream or milk.  This is more of a clam broth.  It definitely has a strong clam taste to it but none of the heartiness that is usually associated with a chowder.  \n\nOrdered a half dozen raw oysters.  They didn't have my favorite kumamoto but they did have some kind of mix kumamoto and something else and I still really liked it.  The oysters were super fresh and briny.  They give you the standard cocktail sauce.  They also give you this dual sauce tray where one bottle holds their own mignonette sauce while the other side has some kind of green thai chili and habanero sauce.  That sauce is freaking awesome and I ended up putting it on my salad.  I wish I could bottle that sauce and bring it home with me.\n\nWe also ordered the combination seafood salad.  I was worried at first because I don't like heavy mayo based dressing, and it seemed from everyone's review the dressing for the salad was some kind of remoulade.  But you can have the dressing on the side and a little bit of the dressing with the divine green chile sauce and it was just deliciousness for my tastebuds.  The salad is a pretty hefty portion and if I was a moderate eater I probably could have been satisfied with just the salad.\n\nNext we got the combination sashimi sicilian style.  It was basically some tuna, salmon, and scallop sashimi drizzled with olive oil (it's actually more than a drizzle it's a generous hand with the olive oil) and topped with fresh cracked black pepper, diced red onions, and some capers.  This was something interesting to the tastebuds but I probably won't order it again the next time (and yes there will be a next time) I come to Swan Oyster Depot.\n\nAnd for dessert we ordered another half dozen oysters.

I had called the place in fear that this might happen but they didn't even have the decency to have a message to let patrons know about the closure.  So I finally found time another day to try this place out.  After an hour wait (1-2pm) standing in line, we were finally seated.  It's true, the person does touch money and that same hand grabs fresh seafood that goes right on your plate.   They don't use gloves.  Ok fine.  I guess these are characteristics of \"hole in the wall\" places.\n\nAbout the food.  You pay a steep price for what you get.  Portions are small.  For 2 people to be comfortably full, you have to spend at least $150.  That sashimi platter was a joke.  They take ONE scallop and slice it into slivers.  It is drizzled with olive oil.  You lose so much of the natural fresh flavors.  This is a bad way to enjoy fresh seafood.  I was so disappointed to learn that the fresh uni that I was so looking forward to was unavailable.  After spending almost $100 bucks (no tip included yet and still not full), we decided that this was pretty ridiculous.  We ended up going next door to Nara sushi to fulfill our appetite. \n\nDon't waste your time (or money).  Sadly there is no hype.  So many other fantastic places to eat in this beautiful City.", "author": "Sandra L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-30", "description": "We finally tried this place after hearing so much hype. One time, we tried walking over once on an early evening, to find out the line had already been cut off. \n\nThis time, we got there at 1:40 pm on Tuesday and there was not really a line thankfully. The 3 of us ordered a cup of the Clam Chowder, the Crab Cocktail, the Prawn Salad and I got a Half Dozen of Mixed Oysters. Our bill was $62! Crazy high. This is ludicrously expensive.  Yeah..it's seafood, but the same dishes are definitely cheaper at other joints.\n\nA few nice remarks: This place is nice because its a family-run business with lots of old-timer regulars that have been going there for 30+ years. ((They must be very wealthy to afford coming here so often))\n\nThis place isn't so nice because it's just a cramped long counter, and it's difficult to go with more than 1 other patron and expect to sit together or even comfortably. We saw a group of 3, and 1 guy had to stand behind his friends. The stools are also all different heights which is ridiculous.\n\nWe were a group of 3 (I was with my boyfriend and his mom), and one of the employees asked us if we wanted to take a seat and have one of us stand. Really? I don't want to stand and eat seafood that costs a small fortune. For that price, I want to sit, thank you very much.\n\nAlso, the menu is extremely limited. I didn't want seafood slathered in cocktail sauce, nor did I want it on a plate of iceberg lettuce. Those seem to be the only 2 options. They also serve clam chowder; it was ok, but it didn't blow me away. \n\nI am remiss that I did not look at the pictures on Yelp or I would have asked about the seafood or scallop sashimi -- which actually looks really good. I didn't see much fish in the window that day. And I didn't like that there wasn't a specials board, or a sign that mentions to ask about what the specials are for the day. I did ask about what was recommended to order, but the guy just pointed to the menu on the wall -- that wasn't helpful at all since I clearly wasn't impressed with the very limited menu I had been looking at for quite awhile. \n\nAlso, they charge you for bread and butter. Really? It was cold unsliced bread with rock hard pads of butter, and they didn't even ask us if we wanted it. I don't like to be charged for something that I didn't even ask for.  We didn't end up being charged because we ended up ordering the salad and it was included in that, but we were served the bread before we even ordered. \n\nThis place is CASH Only, so definitely hit up the ATM before you go, and take out loads because you'll need it. \n\nIn summary --- I just don't get the hype and I won't be returning anytime soon. It's definitely not worth a long wait, and the prices are too high. The portions aren't that big for items that cost nearly $20 either. Yeah..I know it's seafood, but still...", "author": "Rebecca G."}

We arrived shortly before their opening hours of 10:30 am, only to see several people clustered by the front entrance. It turns out they were not going to do counter service and only takeout orders. \n\nA bit weird and confusing at the same, as a sign would've been helpful. The guys inside all seem flustered, running around with their heads cut off. They would pop their head out and abruptly ask \"how can I help you?\" in a I-don't-want-to-be-bothered-attitude. When I asked them why no counter service, they said they had several hundred orders for the holidays.\n\nAnyhow, I figured since we were there, might as well order something to-go and eat it back at the hotel. I ordered the crab salad, which came with sourdough bread and a side of their louie dressing. The guy helping us simply used his bare hands to grab fistfuls of the crab by the front display window. Then, he took our cash.\n\n*Thumbs up*\nIt's all about the crab. It was fresh, tender, sweet, juicy, succulent, and any other positive adjective you can throw out there. It doesn't compare to stuff that's in a can or previously frozen -- there are dudes that just crack the crab all day just to extract the meat. I love dungeness crab, and I always have to get my fix whenever in SF. The heaping whole chunks of the crab leg meat is the best part.\n\n*Thumbs down*\nThe thinly shredded lettuce for the salad is your standard iceburg lettuce. It reminded me of grade school cafeteria lettuce. But it did give a contrasting crunch in texture versus the crab meat. The workers handle the food with their bare hands and take your grubby cash, so that made me cringe a little.", "author": "Dru C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-12", "description": "I've been looking forward to trying Swan Oyster Depot for a long time. In all fairness, the food here is probably a 3-star deal, but for the prices, service, and hygiene, I will definitely not be back to SOD or recommend it to anyone.\n\n- Oysters ($15/half dozen): We actually got 13 oysters even though we ordered a dozen. The oysters are fresh and come on the half shell, and the Thai spice and picked onion sauce are a nice touch, but the oysters have a strange metallic/bitter flavor. Questionable.\n\n- Clam Chowder ($5/bowl): This is probably one of the worst bowls of chowder I've had. It tastes like a combination of spoiled fish and milk, and has a very strange, flakey consistency.\n\n- Sashimi Plate ($16): This is not on the (very, very haphazard and confusing) menu. We saw the couple next to us order it (they said they saw it on TV). The assortment of hamachi, tuna, salmon, squid, and one other type of fish came topped with capers and olive oil. This was very fresh and good, probably the best part of the food.\n\n- Seafood Combination Cocktail ($13.50): This is supposed to come with shrimp, prawns, oysters, clams, and crab. We decided to order this over the combination salad, because the salad is basically charging you $12 for lettuce. The waiter brought us our cocktail glass and told us he left out the clams (because they were out) and the oysters (because we already had oysters) - NOT COOL. That is literally 2/5 of the cup; I would have appreciated some kind of advance notice or apologetic attitude.\n\nYou have to stand in a line to get in; we only ended up waiting about 30 minutes at 4PM on a Saturday (they stopped letting people line up 2 parties after us). The place is set up as one long bar where you can watch them prep most of the cold food. I'm not sure how this place passes the health inspection. The employees were handling money and one was cleaning his teeth with a napkin, and then serving RAW seafood to customers. Even if my food weren't raw, that sounds like a recipe for food poisoning (which we thankfully didn't get) or at least queasy feelings at the thought of germs swimming around in a bowl of chowder. There were a lot of other hygiene issues here; once you notice them, you cannot unsee.\n\nPeople kept coming in the door and talking to the servers, who would then give them bags of seafood that they told dine-in customers they were out of; the kicker is that the servers never asked these people for payment either. This happened so frequently (4-5 times while we were eating), that other dine-in customers started to complain/ask what was up; one server simply said \"They're my friends.\" So do your dine-in customers absorb the cost of this free food? We ended up paying $70+ for a meal that didn't leave us half full. The servers were also obnoxious and contributed to 70% of the noise level. They chatted up white customers, and literally ignored requests from the three groups of Asian customers (our party included).\n\nIf you want good seafood and oysters, go to Hog Island.

Drake's Bay, kumamoto and Sweetwater oysters are served with mignonette sauce. Delicious and definitely deserving to be on that list.\n\nTheir clam chowder is reminiscent of Hog Island's version: think thin soup with clams and potato.

I hoped to God he wasn't going to be the one shucking my oysters.\n\nNonetheless, we ordered 6 blue point oysters and 6 miyagis, and a combination salad (comes with bread and butter that otherwise costs $1).  The blue point oysters were the best part of the meal and all the oysters were cleanly shucked.  I loved, loved, loved the habanero migonette.  The crab in the combination salad wasn't very fresh and didn't have much flavor.  It was not worth $19.  The clam chowder seems to be popular, but it was way too hot for that.\n\nService was nice.. our server was not the one with the bloody finger.  Thank goodness.  On our way out, he handed us a postcard and a \"swan sponge\".  \n\nDefinitely overhyped.  I can get those blue points elsewhere.", "author": "Vivian H."}

Ridiculous! You wait for 45 minutes to an hour to get seafood that is not exceptional at outrageous prices served in worn and chipped plates, sitting on uncomfortable chairs, to pay cash only, and feel crowded and hurried. Wines are ordinary served in tiny cheap glasses. Easily spend over $75 per person. Are you kidding me? I use to always trust Anthony Bourdain on his recommendations. Especially casual places where food is excellent even when served on paper plates. But this one, well, let's say that Bourdain really got it wrong. For less than that you could eat at Waterbar near Embarcadero and get amazing seafood, awesome service and excellent wines in a beautiful setting with views to the Bay Bridge. Still, the thing that bothers me the most is the filth and the lack of food handling safety.

They charge 5$ if you want melted butter with something. We both thought that there prices were a bit ridiculous but chalked it up to the fact that its in sf and its fresh seafood. The place was packed and cramped. There are no tables its just a counter with stools and almost no room to walk behind the people sitting down.

You can show up any time after then and order any of their delicious food to go! I know it's not the same experience as eating at the counter top, but they will pack you oyster crackers, lemons, and whatever sauces your heart desires at no extra cost!

On a cold, Thursday afternoon around 3 p.m., we waited about an hour and forty-five minutes to eat at the counter.\n\nBut, once you get there, the service is warm and friendly, and the seafood is very fresh.  We had four different types of oysters on the half shell.  All of them were sweet and fresh.  Typically, Kumamoto oysters are my favorite, but we found some of them to be smaller than Kumamotos we've had elsewhere.  So, we instead ordered more Fanny Bays, which were nice and plump.  We also tried the clams on the half shell - again, very fresh.  They serve the oysters and clams on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish, but also pickled red onions and a habanero/cilantro/lime topping.  The habanero topping is fantastic.\n\nThe clam chowder is tasty.  Thinner and less chunky than your typical clam chowder, with strong clam flavor.  The smoked salmon is outstanding.  Not too salty, not too fatty, excellent flavor.  With the capers and onions, it pairs nicely with bread.  We also tried the crab cocktail.  It is a cup full of fresh, cold, cooked crab, served with cocktail sauce (cooked well, but less special if you regularly have crab at home).\n\nI just saw in another review that they have live uni, and sashimi it off the half shell.

Tip:  Remember to bring CASH and expect a long wait or you can do it like us and take it to go.\n\nWe didn't make it here on our first day of arrival because they close at 5:30pm but because they are always so packed and they do plan on leaving on time, they start kicking people out with a complimentary tall glass of beer at around 5pm.

It's a small spot with spaces for about 20 seats.  In a nice sunny afternoon, best be prepared for a half hour to 45 min wait (hat and water).  They are nice enough to make sure if your online by the doorway, you can start refreshing yourself with beer.\n\nOnce inside, you see the history of the family running this seafood market and eatery and on the board the menu.  Specials incl a bud light beer with a shrimp cocktail.  Soup by the cup, bowl or bread bowl.  Then the rest of the specialties, various seafood items including various types of oysters by the dozen.  Pricing is standard for seafood (not cheap but not the most expensive).\n\nWe ordered a cup of clam chowder each and aforementioned Special of shrimp cocktail and beer.  And finally we ordered a dozen oysters (3 each of various types).    The chowder was amazing and fresh.  Very nice on a warm or cold day.  If I only ate the clam chowder, I would recommend this place.  The shrimp cocktail was too much for one person, it could have fed three because its basically shrimp and cocktail sauce.\n\nThe best of everything was the oysters, having four types makes you see which is best for you if you want to order here or elsewhere in the future.  I of course don't take notes or pics when I eat with someone so I leave Maria to name the various types.  We enjoyed two types but all four went smoothly.  Best of all, the freshness of these oysters can be judged by how you feel later...(jk).\n\nOverall recommended if you have the time and patience, its not far from Union Sq if you are staying there.

Sure there might be flies flying around here and there but deal with it. If you want to have a fine dining experience go to a fine dining establishment and complain there. As far as the limited seating goes, I think the layout is f**king fantastic. It makes you interact with people. I think Americans have forgotten how to have human interaction because we're afraid to reach out to people. I sat down with my Dad and walked out with San Francisco friends.\n\nCustomer Service-My Dad and I arrived 10 minutes before opening and there was already a line but luckily the line was just the size of the seats available. We walked right in when it opened and like an assembly line. The staff came down the line and started pouring drinks and taking food orders. I told our guy that I had no clue what I was ordering and if he could help. He started giving me options and I was just like \"I leave it to you, man\" 80 dollars later I was in complete bliss. The staff is down to earth and is just real. Oh and many mention it's a tourist trap, well I'm from Los Angeles, and we have tourist traps. Some you don't go to because they suck but some you go to because it's home and they maintain their charm I.E Roscoes Chicken and Waffles.\n\nLong wait-If you don't want to wait then don't come, it's simple as that. People waiting in line behind us were drinking beer and just waiting out their time for some awesome seafood.\n\nTips:\nGet there early and avoid the line.\nIf you're caught in the line drink a beer and chill out.\nMake friends with your neighbors you might just end up sharing food.

My cousins and I decided to try out Swan's because we had heard a lot of good things about them. While there are plenty of things I found quaintly fantastic about Swan's, only one thing determined that I will not come back: customer service. \n\nMy cousins and I - total of 4 people - arrived around 11 am and ended up waiting about 45 minutes to be seated. They have counter seating, so as space opens up, you go ahead and pop a squat. I found that generally it was easier to seat groups of 2, so as we had 4, we settled for 3 stool opening and 1 person stood. On top of that, we had to wait an additional 25 minutes to even get water; we heard \"we'll get to you in a minute ladies\" about five times, and coming from a jolly, happy man can get really frustrating. Don't try to jolly me when I'm grumpy from waiting, sore from standing, and really hungry. \n\nWe ordered 2 dozen mixed variety oysters, 2 scallops sashimi-ed, 1 small bowl of clam chowder, and raw clams. The food was pretty good and fresh, but I feel you can get the same thing in many places in the same area. The clam chowder was mediocre... it looked like the cream was curdled. I was expecting the variety (3 types available at the time) of oysters to be explained to us but they just dropped them off and walked away. \n\nThis is probably the worst customer service that I have ever received. It's like they are so comfortable with their reputation and the fact that a large crowd will come anyway that they can walk really slow, be rude, and ignore customers. My cousin kept asking for cocktail sauce and at one point one of the men looked at her like she was asking for the throne from Game of Thrones and just walked away. RUDE. Service is really slow - our server was one of the daughters so she was quite pleasant, but their system was so bad, she had to shuck all our stuff. You'd figure that they'd have one person shucking constantly or something to speed things up, but nope, each server shucks his guests orders. \n\nOverall we were there for about 2 hours. \n\nI would give 4 stars for food and environment, but I gave 2 stars for service. \n\nTry going somewhere else if you can.

Think about it people!! The reason Swan Oyster Depot is amazing is because they do something no one else does. They do the freshest, most amazing seafood right in front of you on a counter that is less than a foot deep. Not only are you in the kitchen but you're actually at the counter where the magic happens. Who does that?!? No one. No one does it! That's why you need to try this awesome place. \n\nI really feel bad for the people who wrote the bad reviews! Maybe instead of being sourpusses, they should've opened their eyes and appreciated what was going on in front of them. No love lost. I'll be back and will be the first in line again. \n\nI'm an oyster-phile, so is my gorgeous wife and my brother who I'll call LowBro. We ate at Swan on Saturday, Nov 1st. The oysters were from Tomales Bay and Washington. They were fabulous, succulent and down right delicious! I can say that because the three of us have eaten oysters everywhere including Tomales Bay and Washington and these were the best. We had 2 dozen as a warm up. Then LowBro suggested we do the clams. Yeah they're raw, meaty, fleshy and juicy but they were AMAZING! Have you ever had raw clams? I hadn't. Personally I liked the Littlenecks but the Cherry Stones had great flavor as well. \n\nGorgeous Wife took it one step further and ordered the sea urchin (Uni) as the next course. BEST THING EVER!!!! Where have you ever had the freshest Uni and when was it prepared right in front of you??!?? If you can answer that question then I applaud you however if you cannot then git off you butt and go to Swan, wait in line, belly up to the bar and order it. Heavenly, mouthwatering and luscious only scratch the surface. I was about to order another one when they ran out. Did I mention we were the first in line? Gorgeous Wife and LowBro were bummed so we ordered more food. \n\nMarinated calamari was ridiculously good as well. \n\nWe were still hungry so LowBro ordered the sashimi which was salmon, tuna and raw scallops.

But this place has a reputation, and I knew the line would be long, so I showed up at 10AM in order to get seated at its 10:30 opening.\n\nOnce inside, I took my place all the way down by the end of the bar, where there was some sort of stray food material on the counter in need of cleaning, despite the fact that I was the first to eat there.  It was never cleaned up.  A simple 30 second wipedown of the counter before opening would be nice, no?\n\nI decide to get, of course, oysters.  At $28/dozen, these were not actually cheap oysters.  They're cheaper at home in Arizona, believe it or not.  They had six varieties, and I got two of each for my first dozen.  They have mignonette on the counter and a habanero lime sauce for the oysters - I stuck with the mignonette because I like how oysters taste, and didn't want to overpower them.\n\nThey did have live sea urchin, which is really nice.  It was actually priced much more reasonably than the oysters.\n\nReally, this isn't a bad place, but it's really not worth the wait when you can get seafood just as good in the city at a lower cost without having to wait.", "author": "Jeremy P."}

We made sure to get there around 10AM.. We circled around the block a few times and found parking. Sure enough, there was already a party waiting in line and then shortly after we arrived another party joined the line. They opened the doors for us at about 10:20.. woop woop! I love how the lemons and sauces are all laid out for you on the bar but I would imagine the lemon bowl gets a bit germy after multiple people pick their lemons from it.. The service was prompt and so friendly. The guys are all really funny too and even played a prank when we were using the restroom in the back. \nEverything that we tried was so FRESH and delicious. I love how they serve my favorite, crab backs/fat for only $5 each. UGH I wish I could go back right now!!!! The only reason why they don't get 5 stars is that they are bit on the pricey side and seating is limited ;/\n\nAt the end of the meal your server tallies up your bill on the back of a napkin.. awesome!

I'm not sure what the big deal is; to me it's not worth waiting outside like I'm in a Weimar Republic-era bread line. If the food was up to it, and was more comfortable inside, I wouldn't mind as much, but this was waiting for some pretty dull food. This place has exploded in popularity because Anthony Bourdain likes it? Well, I've seen some of the places he likes, and rarely have I been impressed.\n\nMy dining companions disliked the clam chowder, which was odd, because that was the only thing I liked about the place. It wasn't all that creamy, had almost a raspy mouthfeel that I appreciated, and really showcased the clam. It was good, and well-priced. Can't say the same for the rest of the menu in terms of the latter, as everything else seemed to be several dollars above what would be a proper price point, especially considering that this is really just a dive-y lunch counter. \n\nGranted and point conceded - the seafood is fresh. I'm not doubting that. It just tends to come unseasoned and dull..or if it comes with a sauce, it's some uninspired creamy sauce. Not my thing. Also, salad consisted of a bed of iceberg lettuce strips. Truth be told, I expect much more than this from San Francisco dining, even if the joint in question is just a little lunch counter. \n\nI probably would have stopped at three stars, but this place is also so brutally uncomfortable, I have to dock it an additional point. Even if you weren't crammed in there like a sardine in a can, the stools are simply awful. They don't offer any means of resting your legs, which means your legs are going to dangle, almost coaxing you off the stool itself. Horrible. And then, I was attempting to perch on the stool closest to the door, which added to the sense of discomfort with way too much bustle from all the takeout orders. It was so crowded, I didn't have a choice. \n\nService was fine, but on the balance, I can't overlook the uninspired preparations, and pervasive discomfort of sitting in there.", "author": "Patrick L."}

Oh noo, the season just ended. My friends from San Diego recommended the seafood salad, but I didn't want to order it without the crab, especially after seeing that it's some misc seafood (small shrimp/big shrimp, etc.) over iceberg lettuce.

As I would do anywhere I started exploring, since I'm staying in Nob Hill naturally Nob Hill it would be. I'm here for two weeks so I need some good places to eat great local food. I walked past Swan and noticed every seat in the house was taken. Usually a good sign, and there was a line out the door. I took it as a sign and took my place in line.\n\nWhile I waited I checked out Yelp. I mean why not, i had some time to kill. Reviews seemed good but also some bad ones saying the place was all hype. I started to get the feeling that this place might be a local haunt or renowned. A view recent reviews said the place was dirty, servers didn't wash their hands, it was disgusting. This bothered me but I dared to stay in line. Figured how bad could it be but cringing for the worst. My hungry eyes and belly wouldn't let me budge anyway. I was lost in Swan's gravitational pull. Turns out those posts were full of hogwash, yes they use their hands which I saw the guys wash frequently. No need to fear the hypochondriac's reviews. \n\n\nThe food is outstanding and the crew does wash their hands. Been here three times already and it's not scary at all. In fact the servers are awesome and the food is a fish lovers dream come true. I've had the clam chowder, of course, by the bowl. Really well done chowder, coupled with that sour dough bread I mean it's unstoppable. Then came the cracked crab with the Louie sauce, (really good sauce, ask for it if they don't serve it) which put me into fish ecstasy. I went back today had some more chowder (it's delicious) and the crab cocktail with the combination salad. I also had the oysters from around the world, wow, just wow.\n\nTry this place at least once!

Some guy in front of us started talking to us about his fishing stories from Hawaii that we did not care about because all we were focused on was the wonderful display of fresh seafood behind the glass window. He was rambling on and on about fresh seafood when all my friend and I could do was stare at the crabs while trying to wipe the drool that was running down the side of our mouths.\n\nFinally got seated at about 3:45, hungry and fickle about what to order, we decided to try everything (good thing I ran to the ATM and withdrew enough cash to cover my appetite since this place is cash only).\n\nFirst up, clam chowder. I guess this is more of the San Francisco style? Watery but with really fresh clams and though it was really juicy, I do want more thickness in my chowduhhhh. However, I was kind of glad after because it didn't fill me up so I had more room to try other things on the menu!\n\nSecond, the combination oyster platter of kumamoto, miyagi, blue point, and a fourth kind I can't remember. Holy smokes, the smaller oysters were out of this world sweet and honestly, I egged on my friend to order another round but she said to wait for the other courses first. So I listened and moved on to the next item on my list.\n\nThird, combination seafood cocktail consisting of clams, oysters, shrimp, prawns, & crab. This little glass consisting of the some of the sweetest seafood made my taste buds light up with glee and did the Fresh Prince \"Jump On It Dance\".\n\nFourth, scallop sashimi, good but nothing I care to cover in great detail since it was just meh compared to the other dishes.\n\nFifth, Crab Louie Sandwich, OH MAH GAWD~!!! Word of advice, smother it in that sauce (pronounced SAWWWSSEE) and PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH. By far the best thing I had at Swan's and I wish I had crabs...like that. Alas, we were satisfied and although we planned on sitting there the whole time 'til closing so to make the others waiting outside having to wait even longer (yes we're evil like that) we decided on leaving. I tried my best to egg my friend on to order another round of the oysters but she threw in the flag, a sad panda I was. Oh well, 'til next time.\n\nAnthony Bourdain, you did not let me down sir. The hype was met and I am a Belieber in the splendid seafood emporium that is known as Swan Oyster Depot. Also, the staff is very laid back here, I believe most of the staff are all within the family. At times they were funny, at times they were not. Our server kept cautioning me when I was trying to order all the items, even though we ordered everything one by one after finishing each dish. It's like dude, did you just not see me scarf that dish down with a single breath? I can handle my seafood damn it! I'm a fat man! But besides that, good overall experience.", "author": "Edison T."}

Clearly those days are long gone. The service is friendly and chatty, almost to a fault. They riff off each other and customers at the bar, so be prepared for a talkative bunch. \n\nThe seafood is fresh, and some of the best items can look a little intimidating to the uninitiated. First off is the Crab Fat. For some, the name can be a turn-off, and serving it in the crab's carapace may scare off the rest. Maybe re-brand it Crab Butter, or Avocado of the Sea. But with a squeeze of lemon and a hunk of bread, this is the best. The only thing better was the Sea Urchin. Don't let the still-quivering spines scare you, this is a must-try. Served incredibly fresh, it was easily the sweetest I have ever had, and I would return solely for this. \n\nWe also tried a mix of oysters: Kumamoto, Miyagi, and Blue Point; as well as Cherry Stone clams. The Miyagis were the stand-out, and if you are into clams, the Cherry Stones won't disappoint. The cracked crab was good, but a little underwhelming compared to the rest. Maybe it needed a sauce, but no good seafood should need anything extra added. \n\nThe usual issues are of course the limited seating, long waits, and cash-only policy. But if you come during off-peak hours with cash in hand, this is a great place to try out.", "author": "Christopher M."}

And this place was highly recommended by others as being one of the best in the Bay Area.  And I'm even cool with a cash only policy.\n\nBut I'm still surprised that someone has not gotten sick yet with their hygiene practices.  Not only do they not wear gloves, the same hands are the ones that handle the cash and wipe off the counters.  But that was simply what I saw, let me tell you what I firsthand experienced from a server named I think Derek.\n\nI ordered a half dozen bluepoint oysters and a combination seafood cocktail.  On the cocktail comes an oyster on top.  When my server was setting it down on the counter, the oyster fell off.  I don't blame the mistake, but see for yourself what the next steps were.  The server then places the oyster in front of me and says eat it, which I thought was a joke.  But it wasn't, and only after many times of simply refusing to touch it and other patrons talking in sympathy about what happened, they finally did what any normal restaurant especially one dealing with seafood should have in the first place: set a clean oyster down.\n\nSo sadly, one star for this place for their sanitation practices.

Unlike the smell of SFO that we just left, we walked somet hing comforting being wharfy and clean.  We stared at the board: oysters, crabs, shrimp, smoked salmon, etc.  Wowed by the history of it all and how small and simple the joint was from the counter tops to the cash register (cash only) to  the long row of seats at the bar and the guys schucking oysters.  A few bad jokes.  Smiles.  The traffic past the strorefront.  We were in SF. \n\nThis joint has been around since the turn of the other century, not 2000, to be specific.  It's got over a gazillion reviews, so we'd been warned that there are at times a line down the street.  Lady luck's oyster opened up and would have us walk right in on that Tuesday afternoon.    \n\nThe crew that works there is friendly and hilarious.  Among the noise, some strong voices yelled about how the 49ers could've done this or that or how they're gonna rebuild for 2012.  I can relate; we Boltheads.  They noticed that weren't local, by the way we stared at the board. HA\n\nLater, a dozen mixed oysters later of kumamotos and miyagis and another that I don't remember.  A bowl of clam chowder to share, which wasn't as creamy as one always see it, but still tasty. I think this is how its supposed to be made? I'm not arguing.   Some smoked salmon sliced, on french bread, with capers and olive oil to close.  Mind you, beers and wine to boot.\n\nWe had two crabbacks since they were lined up on the counter.  We were told Bourdain's recent visit had catalyzed patrons to ask for them?? How so?? We explained we grew up with crab backs.  Apparently, ordering crab meant being served just the legs and claws.  The body was used elsewhere.  Crabs were not just limited to their claws and legs; you ate the whole thing.  Nothing goes to waste.  My biggest childhood memory was eating crab fat mixed with fried rice or dropping rice into the shell and using the shell as a bowl.   How funny..\n\nSeafood isn't cheap.  You get what you pay for.

I ended up going with my co-worker friend on a saturday afternoon (in our effort to do a bunch of touristy things while it was 80 degrees in the City).  After a promise of a cable car ride after lunch, I dutifully waited in line for Swan Oyster Depot for half an hour (which actually wasn't as long as i thought).\n\nOnce inside, we had a dozen oysters, a half dozen clams, a crab cocktail, a prawn cocktail, and 2 cups of chowder.\n\nThe chowder isn't the usual chowder.  It's more of a clam soup and is really thin.  However, I didn't mind it because it was super thick clam chowder I think i would have suffocated in the unreasonably warm 80 degree whether of the City.\n\nThe cocktail sauce was awesome.  It almost is a cross between ketchup, clam juice, and...something else.  It goes with almost everything - it went really well on the crab cocktail, on the prawn cocktail, on the hunk of bread that is given when you first sit down...it was AWESOME.\n\nService was spotty at best, however I think it depended on who you got as your initial server.

Classic American, super fresh seafood. I see a lot of complaints on here about the wait, so here's a few tips to make your trip successful:\n1. Expect a wait. If its raining or cold, consider if you want to be waiting outside, maybe you should come back another day. If the line is gigantic, again, realize what you're getting into - maybe you should come another day.\n2. Don't come with a large group. Seating is very limited and you're sitting at a bar. You'll be sat WAY faster if you just bring 1 friend. Its also easier to talk to just 1 or 2 people when you're sitting at a bar as opposed to sitting across from each other at table. \n3. Check out the menu and come for the seafood. Places that are hyped up often get a lot of flack for not blowing the pants off everyone that walks in the door often because patrons are expecting something different. Enjoy what they are great at making. If you're not excited by the menu, I'm sure you can find another place in San Francisco you will love instead. \n4. Be friendly! The staff here has a great dynamic and are very hospitable. You'll be eating at the bar while they are preparing dishes right across from you. You'll also be sitting at the bar, close to other customers. \n5. Its pricy. Fresh seafood usually is.\n6. If you like Crab/Seafood Louie Salad, look no further.", "author": "Asia H."}

I also promised myself I wouldn't join the club of people that can't stand the hour wait and take it out on the food. \nSo, armed with a random novel bought off the Russian bookstore on Polk, I placed myself in queue at around 12:30. \n\nService\nAround 2:00, I was greeted by the really friendly staff at the bar. That is actually a really nice thing about this place, is their staff. Being a small joint, every customer gets equal and regular attention. \n\nCrab back (fat)\nAnchor Steam in hand, bread and butter as accompaniment, I dove into the crab fat as my starter. This was actually amazing. The flavor was buttery and the texture like melted butter. Very good. This would be heaven if it were slightly warmer.\n\nOysters\nGot the mixed dozen, which included Shigoku, Kumamoto and Tomales Bay. These were OK, and I have definitely had better. \n\nCracked Crab:\nReally meh. The meat was served cold, which accompanied with the blandness made this really lackluster. So much so, that I had to dip every single crab piece I harvested in their cocktail sauce. Get the crab cocktail at $15 instead. Better value for money, since you have to dip the crab in it anyway.\n\nClam chowder: \nThis was way, way better than New England clam chowder. Its much thinner and creamier,and you can really taste the seafood goodness. \n\nAll in all, I would give this place a 3.5, which yelp does not allow, so I will give them the benefit of doubt and swing to 4, since its definitely not a 3.", "author": "Dhruv L."}

We were hoping that most people would be back at work and not on vacation like we were, but we couldn't have been more wrong. The line was already at least 50 people long and because the place is so small (seats about 20 bar style) and the gentlemen that work there are pretty laid back, it took us a painful three hours to finally sit.\n\nThe line started at the Nail Salon, and trust me I was seriously considering having my boyfriend hold our place in line while I got a mani-pedi. Instead I grabbed him a cinnamon roll and me some coffee at the doughnut shop just up the street (sadly they don't offer gluten free doughnuts..wahhh!) . If you get there and the line is that long, I HIGHLY recommend having a little snack while you wait or you will be famished by the time you get seated.\n\nDoing my best not to faint from lack of nourishment and only a mom & daughter duo away from sitting, I was pleasantly surprised when one of the waiters offered to pour me a glass of wine while we waited just a tad longer. I chose the Sauvignon Blanc. Expecting something cheap from a screw top bottle, I was psyched to receive a delicious glass Honig from good 'ol home-sweet-home, Napa Valley! I was a happy lady.\n\nWe finally sat and the place was, well...messy. Like a joint run by a bunch of dudes, which is exactly what it is. It was a little cluttered, stuff just seemed all over the place, far from glamorous. Coming from Napa, we don't have a ton of \"hole in the wall\" type places so it took at least one more glass of Honig to ease into it. \n\nAlthough the surroundings were a little out of order, the service was IMPECCABLE, the gentleman we got as our server was super easy going, kept my wine glass full and even offered me Udi's gluten free bread to nosh on when I let him know I had a gluten allergy/celiac disease. I was literally floored. Especially because I was fricken starving!!!\n\nWe ordered:\nHalf Dozen Oysters (sorry cannot remember the names) - They were.. good. Not great. We enjoyed some of the best oysters of our lives at Barrell House Tavern the night before in Sausalito. I wouldn't go here for the oysters, but if you're in the mood, go for it.\n\nPrawn Cocktail - Deee-fricken-lish! So fresh and perfectly pink! Their homemade cocktail sauce was what really made the dish. Hands down, once of the best I've ever tried and gluten free.\n\nClam Chowder (cup) - The bf got this one, as our server said there are \"traces\" of wheat in the soup. It was legitimately a cup, small. And had a more brothy texture than most are used to. He said it was delicious and lapped it up with his crusty (and gluteny) bread.\n\nCrab Salad - I had originally asked for the Half Crab, but our server suggested the salad so that we didn't have to deal with the shells, I opted in and was VERY pleased with the decision. The salad was a plate full of very fresh and crunchy lettuce and loadssss of seriously fresh crab. Their homemade Louie dressing was ridiculously yummy, so creamy and also gluten free!! I asked for some drawn butter on the side (which he candidly heated up on the coffee warmer) and it really hit the spot. I seriously think I could eat this salad EVERY day, with extra butter of course ;)\n\nSan Francisco Sashimi (aka Italian Sashimi) - NOT LISTED ON MENU. I saw this creation on yelp and had to try it. Though it was not on the menu, the waiter knew exactly what I meant and made it picture perfect to what I had seen in photos. It is raw tuna, raw salmon and raw scallops drizzled with olive oil, salt, pep & capers. Seriously fresh and delicious! \n\nI had a total of three glasses of wine (and I deserved every ounce after that line!) and the bf had a Stella, our bill came to $110. Pricey, but that's what you pay to get seriously fresh seafood in a renowned location in San Francisco!\n\nThe question of the day: \"Was the crazy wait and price worth it?\" \nHELL YES, it was worth it!

Crab was amazing- we ordered a cocktail without the cocktail sauce, highly recommended.\n\nTip/secret: if you know what you want (which is the crab salad) skip the line and stand at the entrance, tell them your order to go and you'll be out of there in under 10 minutes.", "author": "Shayne S."}

We ordered the clam chowder. It was some of the best I've ever had. We also had the seafood sashimi which was the freshest, tastiest fish I've ever had. The venue is a little small and cramped and the only seating is at the counter. You have to wait in line until people leave before you can sit down. The whole experience is worth it if you are looking for great seafood.", "author": "Mike S."}

A half dozen to full dozen different oysters flown in daily. Yes they are that fresh, but they have to order them that way, they have been known to sell out certain kinds. Shrimp and crab cocktails are very popular, but if your going to Swan for their clam chowder your out of your mind. Simply put SF has some of th best chowder around and honestly Swan doesn't make the best, it's good, but not great. It's not called Swan chowder company so stick with what they've been known for the past 100 years \"Oysters\" \n\nThe chefs are great, Eager and honestly they are more fish mongers than the usual chef's you actually get a chance to meet at most restaurants. Not the prep cooks, sous chefs or line cooks. I'm talking about the executives, the head chef, the one's who make the menu is who I'm comparing them to. My usual fish monger gets food just as fresh, but not so much on the variety of oysters and slightly bigger fresh uni. \n\nCome early and come hungry. I promise you'll leave satisfied. Don't linger, the city has so much more to offer than Swan, the other reason I say that is because there are 100 other people waiting outside by the time you finished reading this.

My husband saw the line and started with \"we can come back some other time....\" So impatient, but I tell him \"we are here lets just wait\". \n\nSo was it worth the wait? Absolutely! The guys behind the counter are cheery when you sit down (not like they've been doing this all day) they get your drinks going and some nice crunchy crusted bread to start. They are chatty and seem to love carving up the fish and designing beautiful plates of food. I went for a crab salad which to some may seem a bit plain, but the chunks of crab are so fresh. I was a happy camper. My husband had first a bowl of chowder (should have tried it, looked creamy but light not super heavy) Then he ordered the Italian Sashimi, a mixture of thinly sliced scallop, salmon, and hamachi drizzled with olive oil, chopped red onions, capers and some cracked pepper. A work of art. My husband actually works with two of the guys working cousin. So of course this got them telling us stories, and as you sit at the long bar you end up chatting with customers next to you. It's old school and only accepts cash (remember that stuff? So bring a good amount so you can have a lot)\nIt's definitely an institution and I can't wait to go back.

Anyway, as I was saying, the server was a real champ for allowing my boo-ski and I to dabble in what the Swan Oyster Depot had to offer.  After reveling at the fresh, clean taste and excellent texture of the taster, we ordered a half-dozen of Miyagi, a bowl of clam chowder, and a shrimp cocktail.  \n\nIn terms of taste, the Miyagi oyster was so fresh that its slight saltiness made anything beyond a squeeze of lemon sudden sacrilege.  The chowder was good, and the shrimp cocktail was everything you would expect from perfectly cooked shrimp.  The prices, though, are hefty, with an average price of $2/oyster sold by the .5 & single dozen.  But, from my Yelp navigation, the costs aren't too bad compared to others, everything just adds up quick.\n\nAs it's just a counter-lined restaurant with everyone waiting to catch a seat, SOD can be easily packed.  But the atmosphere is relaxed, and the service is genuine--though we were kind of ignored, maybe we look too young?  The Depot is also CASH ONLY, with the servers tallying up your order via collective memory.  \n\nThis spot is a real gem.. no wonder Anthony Bourdain (yeah, I think he's a badass) frequented this restaurant daily but chose not to feature it on his show... some secrets are best kept unsaid!", "author": "Diane N."}

I had picked up their delicious shrimp for a few parties before but never sat at the bar. Decided to bite the bullet today (Tuesday) and finally go - in between jobs so that gave me more flexibility than normal. Arrived at 10am bc I wanted to make sure to get a seat at their 10:30am opening. I was probably number 6 in line and took a seat towards the end of the bar. Just to the left of the higher seats close to the kitchen. I have had the luck of enjoying such great seafood in SF and have to say the Sicilian sashimi still totally blew me away. I started with a \"lady\" portion but soon ordered another. I had to shut my eyes the fish was so fresh (halibut, salmon, maguro, yellowtail,) and the scallops tasted so sweet and divine.  Also enjoyed the clam chowder. Since I was alone I could enjoy the banter of the manly men working behind the counter. Definitely the type of guys you wish you were hanging with outside of work. One was a very cute marine who gave all his shirts away to charity and  now sees all the homeless wearing them around (overheard.) He was kind enough to notice me juggling my purse and stored it behind the counter. I have to say Tom was the highlight. He made me feel like I was in his home and prepared the stunning sashimi dishes himself. He was lovely. The only sad part was having to leave.

Due to San Francisco as a whole having shitty parking and the Swan being no exception, we were lucky enough to find meter parking across the street in front of the Walgreens. \n\nOn a side note, I'd like to take the time here to thank the employees at Walgreens because all the parking meters along Polk Street are coin-only and the employees at Walgreens were really cool about me getting change without having to buy any obligatory merchandise. Seriously thanks, for making change for me on two separate runs. That's right, you heard me I had to make change twice. I think a quarter only bought me 6 fucking minutes. So yea, when you get change, ask for $5 worth of quarters. \n\nWhat seemed like an hour line (there were only 12 people ahead of us) ended up being nearly 1 hour and 40 minutes because this place is fucking tiny. Whether it was battling the frigid outdoor wind gusts, the glare of the angry Metro PCS worker at the adjoining store next door because the line cuts across their business, or the fucking homeless people smoking and begging for money, we persevered with the hopes of having the best oyster experience in our lives. I mean Yelp said this place was 4.5 stars after all. \n\nWell when we finally got in and were seated, we instantly realized why the line took so long. The turnaround here is insanely slow and their system of taking orders is ridiculous. Some Yelpers commented on this place being old-fashioned and rustic. Okay, I'll give it that since the restaurant and the workers are old. But for fucks sake, I don't want to grow old here waiting for my food. Let's just say, repeating our order to the same worker three times was really frustrating. Moreover, having to tell the worker what we ordered when we were getting the bill was equally annoying. The only positive about the bad service was the complementary pint of Anchor Steam for their constant fuck ups. \n\nAnyways, due to the recommendations of other Yelpers, we ordered the combination salad, an extra order of crab cocktail, a cup of watery clam chowder, and of course Kumamoto and Miyagi oysters. The crab here is really good and you don't need to get your hands dirty because the crabs are cracked and shelled for you by the little Chinese ladies in the back and all you get is the meat. The clam chowder is really clammy and should be called clam soup because it's not as thick as traditional chowder. The oysters were awesome, but then again, how can you fuck up an oyster when all you have to do is shuck them. \n\nAfter eating our meal, which took 20 minutes, actually 30 minutes since it took us another 10 minutes to flag the worker for the bill, I really felt underwhelmed. 2 hours and 10 minutes for an experience that was sub-par is just not 4.5 star worthy. Sigh... The following day when I went to the Ferry Building I saw a rival oyster restaurant where you don't need to wait over an hour just to eat oysters that are probably caught by the same fucking fishermen. \n\nTo sum it up, I really don't know what the hype about this place is about.

I generally don't really like clam chowder and here's why: places usually put too much corn starch to thicken the soup or too much cream to make it creamy, or skimp on the seafood. This place did everything BUT that. It was homemade, you can taste the clams, it wasn't too heavy so eating a whole bowl was no problem. The clam chowder is the only thing they serve hot/cook there, everything else is raw. \n\nOyster assortment: half dozen, comes out to about 13 dollars. It was great tasting all the different kinds and my favorite is the Alaskan oyster. They are smaller in size but very fat and fresh. \n\nOnly drawback is the wait and limited seating. It fits about 15-20ish people at the bar at one time, so if you come during a busy time, expect a long wait.", "author": "Amy L."}

We grabbed a to-go order of the crab salad and bowl of clam chowder. While everything was fresh, it failed to impress. The crab was sweet and plentiful but you get what you pay for. The clam chowder on the other hand was watery and I felt like there were instances where there was sand in my mouth. Perhaps there was too much hype around this place. We had several friends that would spend their weekend afternoons waiting in line to eat here. I'm not sure I would do that.

In fact, this unassuming nonpareil of seafood delicacies ranging from Kumamoto oysters to Salmon caught in British Columbia was the pinnacle of our San Francisco getaway.  Having been here for a century, still family owned and operated, it is a \"must try\" on anyone's list of foodie destinations.\n\nWe waited in line for 30 min on a Tuesday afternoon (approx. 12:30).  From reading the other reviews, it was evident that we were extremely lucky with our short wait time.  But I want to stress again and again that it is worth the wait!!!\n\nWe found our seats at the end of the long seafood bar, and began our seafood adventure with a bottle of Honig winery's Sauvignon blanc, a sweet honeyed Napa Valley vintage which pairs beautifully with seafood.\n\nWe relished a mixed dozen of oysters for only $28 - Miyagis from the Pacific NW, small and sweet Kumamotos, and Blue Points from Massachusetts.  The oysters were incredibly clean, meat separated easily from the shell and was phenomenal with their homemade horseradish and cocktail sauce.\n\nThe Ahi tuna and Salmon that we savored had been caught yesterday in BC and the Scallops came from the Bay of Fundi in Nova Scotia.  This sashimi platter was served with olive oil, capers, onions, and lemon and was the freshest sashimi we had ever tasted.\n\nAlong with our numerous meals, fresh baked San Fran style bread was served with that lovely sourdough taste.\n\nThe smoked salmon from BC was outstanding and came recommended by Jimmy and Eric - outstanding resources, fun conversation, and extremely knowledgable gentleman working here at SOD.\n\nAnd the cracked crab....there is a reason why more than a thousand Yelpers as well as the employees here recommend it: buttery, fresh, succulently juicy. Having had crab up and down California coasts and locally and seasonally this is by far the most exquisite!  A divine grand finale for our seafood sojourn.\n\n$140 for the lot, and worth every dollar spent.", "author": "Jacqueline M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-06-11", "description": "Preface: This is going to be a negative review but it is honest and justified, in my opinion. I am not the 'sue-Mcdonalds-over-spilled-coffee' type person. I am reasonable and will say bad things only when necessary--please keep this in mind.\n\nI had a horrid experience at this unclean hellhole. Please, do yourself a favor, and realize that the wait is not worth it, and it's mostly just tourists here that are perpetuating their business and unjustified inflated prices.\n\nI came on a Tuesday, at 10:20AM, 10 minutes before this joint was set to open. There was already a line of about 12 people (4 of them being some annoying kids who you know will be noisy). Alright, whatever. They actually started to let people in at 10:35AM--way to be punctual (you'd think they can get it right after so many years). Everyone sat down on wobbly bar stools and was served--that is, except us. While everyone around us were being served by cheerful smiles and greetings, we sat with blank stares wondering when someone would acknowledge our presence. Was it a racial issue? Maybe. Was it poor management? Perhaps. Is it because our server is senile and only makes like $20 an hour after working so many years? I mean, wrist dysfunction and customer service can take a toll on you. Maybe I'm being selfish and not considering what hardships our server went through. Then again, that's the nature of customer service though--customer first, and we definitely felt last. We literally were being ignored by about every service worker for about 15 minutes as we did nothing. Some would give us slight glances but quickly remove eye contact because they didn't want to feel any responsibility--talk about the bystander effect. We felt extremely marginalized and I already pictured myself writing this review and giving no tip. When you feel this way, where everyone around you is already eating and being merry while you're sitting looking stupid, then that's a red flag for a zero tip and a 1-star Yelp review. When you feel you have to beg for service like a second class citizen in the Civil Rights era, you're in the wrong place and should do something about it, be it a passive-aggressive Yelp review or leaving a penny (because who wants to make a scene?). I wish I had half a penny. How could we enjoy our food when the service is extremely poor?\n\nThe clam chowder? Too thin and tasteless.\nOh, when this came out, he gave us no spoons. We waited about 3 minutes to see if he would notice--nope, we had to ask. Furthermore, when our rude server put utensils in front of us, he threw it down on the bacteria cultured counters instead of setting it nicely on a napkin. Again, feeling marginalized.\n\nThe oysters? Pretty good, honestly--get the mixed dozen. But you don't need to come here in a 1-hour line for good oysters.\n\nThe smoked salmon open faced sandwich? Nothing special. It looked good, but when we compared it to how he prepared it for some other customers, ours looked nasty. How appalling.\n\nWhen the Asian lady from the back came to put more ice in some bins up front, she definitely used her dirty hands on the ice. This is the same ice that your glass cups sit in and where you put your mouth. Who knows how many rats are singing in the back.\n\nLastly, the big slab of smoked salmon where the servers were cutting from was just sitting out in the open in a room at STP (standard temperature and pressure). In other words, it wasn't on ice so I wonder how many bacteria colonies were forming. It should be some sort of chilled surface.\n\nIn summary, this place is a POS and no native from SF who has any sense should come here when there's so many other better places that won't charge you ridiculous prices for sub-fresh seafood. It's all tourists in the line and it should stay that way so they don't come to the places that are actually worthwhile.\n\nPlease, save your money and your soul, don't let them play you for a belittled sucker.", "author": "Marlon T."}

We showed up on an early Friday afternoon, and there was a huge line (people who had been there before said it was 2 hours long) - and I didn't have anywhere near the change (nor the patience) to keep feeding the meter for that long. That said, you can order takeout, which is a lot quicker and will quench your appetite sooner.\n\nWe grabbed an order of smoked salmon and some clam chowder and chowed down in the car before heading out. I know there's a bunch of clam chowder out here, but I prefer the creamier, thicker versions that come out of Boston and the Northeast to the Left Coast version. That said, despite the thinner soupiness, the flavor was still good, and the broth had a lot more of the clam flavor coming through. The smoked salmon was heaven - not sure there's really much more to add to it, but wow is it awesome. They just load you up with some slices of some of the juiciest strips of salmon, loaded with that smokiness, along with a good amount of bread and some butter. Put a little butter on the bread, grab a piece of salmon, and partake. The fresh stuff is so much better than buying it in a packet at the store...enough said.\n\nI'd love to come back sometime and maybe sit down, but I don't know if I can endure that kind of wait. There's always takeout, though, and for that, I will definitely visit again when I'm back in town.", "author": "Asuka N."}

I had 3 hours before I leave for my flight and needed spend those 3 hours smartly... meaning, what must I eat and how best can I do it? \n\nSwan Oyster has been on my list for the longest. Reading the reviews, I knew there was going to be a line. Since I didn't have any time to waste, it was my first spot to hit. Oysters for breakfast? No lie, I had my reservations, but YOLO right?\n\nAccording to Yelp, Swan opens at 10:30am. I got there at 10am and there was already a line. No fret, it gave me time to plan my next stop. Plus, in front of me the \"residents of SF\" (aka the original hipsters), were chatting about some movie production and sang some songs. Also helped that they were equipped with beer, paper bags, and had enough to share with little o' me. Beer at 10am on the streets on SF? Yep, YOLO. #brownbaggingitdontcare\n\nWhen they finally opened (11am), we filed in, taking in the seats along the bar. Very quickly, the men behind the counter took orders and fulfilled. Though they didn't have sea urchin that day, I was very happy with my selection - 3 miyagi oysters, 3 kumamoto oysters, and 1 cup of their famous chowder. The oysters were sweet, briny, and fresh. The chowder had little cream, which is what I prefer, and each scoop was filled with clams. So yummy! Didn't have the room to order their cracked crab or the seafood salad, but maybe next time when I return with more people. \n\nGuys with the beer: if you happen to read this... thanks again and hope you enjoyed your first round on me. :)", "author": "Lily C."}

I could estimate not including the crew you can fit maybe 15 people max (20 if nobody's claustrophobic). Bathroom is way in the back, make sure you don't make a wrong turn otherwise you'll become apart of their walk-in freezer.\n\nWe sat at the very end and got the following items:\n\nClam Chowder Bowl (serving for 1, we shared: http://instagram.com/p/Yi9UcEnhwf/)\nMixed Dozen + 1 Bluepoint courtesy of Brian : http://instagram.com/p/Yi-ErxHhxf/)\n\"Best Smoked Salmon in The World\"- phrased coined by folks of this place: (http://instagram.com/p/Yi__nnHh0w/)\n\nThe Chowder is straight forward. If the oysters are good then the clams have to be bomb. I prefer the stuff next to the Wharf but if you're in the neighborhood this will hit the spot and its the same price point just not as carb heavy.\n\nMixed Dozen of Oysters (I'll review outline each one individually):\nMy preferred palate from first to last is: Bluepoint, Kumomoto, Drake's (local) and Miyagi.\n\nThe size and ease of consumption of the bluepoint is music to my ears. Makes me want to get a diving certificate and acquire several pounds of that myself. The Miyagi and Kumomoto were also decent but tasting the Kumomoto's brine was a bit unpleasant for me (perhaps I was usually under the influence or had an overdose of mignonette sauce at sushi restaurants that masked the damn thing). Miyagi and Drake's weren't too bad however the Drake's may be to small of a portion to appreciate the tasting for some folks who want to get more bang for their buck.\n\nSmoke Salmon, without the capers and red onion excess. Excellent, think of your highest standard of Spanish Iberico Jamon and turn it into a thinly smoke slices of seafood bliss. If you're into capers and red onions and the whole Jewish thing then bring some cream cheese and go H.A.M. on it.\n\nOverall, I believe I spent almost $60.00 with tax and tip. Definitely worth the trip and the parking hassles of SF. Besides elbow room the fact they only accept cash is a bit of a damper.

Like Swan Oyster needs even MORE publicity or good reviews.  Frankly, it's gotten SO HARD to get in here, and the line out the door so long, I don't go as frequently as I used to.\n\nThe seafood salad is always copious, fresh, and delicious.  Same with the oysters.  Along with the SF sourdough bread, downing a fresh, draught Anchor Steam beer while shoulder-to-shoulder with locals and overseas tourists is a quintessential San Francisco experience.  I think that the only time to go without a wait is 9am or earlier on  a weekday.  You are a SUCKER if you wait in those long Saturday lunch lines.", "author": "Dave N."}

Then, I order to take out, usually salmon. \n\nYes, I wish I didn't have to wait in line so long, but the nice thing about it is that you usually meet cool people, and you end up having these cool conversations.

My friend and I had been looking forward to Swan for weeks prior to us going there the day before Christmas.  I know.  \"Day before Christmas.\"  Maybe we should have had a plan B prepared, but we did not see anything on their website warning us that there would be *no counter service* on that particular day.  This was only noted by a sign outside the shop.  \n\nOf course, we were looking forward to eating at the counter; after all, that is a major part of the Swan experience.  We would have settled for take-out.  Unfortunately, they didn't even offer that, or any real niceties.  When I asked if there was anything available to purchase, I was shocked to be responded to so curtly by one of the men, stating only that they were not selling anything and to try back after 2 p.m.  What a kind invitation, to come begging for scraps.  Sign me up!  \n\nPerhaps on a normal day, we would have had the amazing experience everyone raves about: the friendly counter workers who love their job, the fresh seafood, a pint of Anchor Steam and elbow-rubbing with fellow seafood-lovers.  It was not to be the day before Christmas, and I'm pretty much turned off to the idea of ever going back there now after the way my friend and I were pretty much dismissed by the staff.

It took too long to acknowledge us, but once acknowledged, the server seemed like a nice enough guy although there were subsequent lapses in service. I got a hint that they have maybe let success allow them to forget the fundamentals.  I also noticed some other guests not getting adequate service, then getting a lot of service. There are some major inconsistencies going on in the service.\n\nWe ordered the chowder, the mixed oyster & clams, and a whole crab.\n\nThe chowder was the most watered down chowder I've had in years. There are some excellent chowders out there. This isn't one of them. It's ok, but it's not worthy of a hot spot like this is supposed to be and certainly not worth the prices they charge.\n\nThe server brought us the wrong oyster order. He brought us the mixed oysters not the 6 oysters & 6 clams we had ordered. He didn't even really apologize. I got the feeling - even though he seemed nice - that he was doing us a favor. Anyway, he brought the clams on a separate plate after we pointed out the mistake. Hey, the oysters and the clams were wonderful!  They were wonderful!\n\nHe never brought the crab and we cancelled that order. We observed that the other guests were enjoying their food. I watched them prepare sea urchin & that was a great experience. The people sitting next to me tried one & they were unwilling to comment on the taste, but I pressed the 3 of them for an opinion and finally they seemed to agree that it was *meh.* It was a culinary experience, but not a tasteful one, just an experience and that's cool - one should try things, but not all things are awesome.  The other people sitting next to us had the salmon & said they really enjoyed it.\n\nThen we sat there for another 15 minutes waiting for the check. I finally had to get up hoping he'd get the message we were ready to leave. That didn't work, so I went to where he was and asked for the check. It was closing time, so they were cleaning up and doing other chores. I get that. I'm not trying to be too harsh.\n\nOverall, the food was very good (except for the water-downed chowder).\n\nThey're way overpriced. I assume because they've received some notoriety.  They definitely have the tourist prices due to their 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThe service seemed to be hit & miss. Our experience on service was, overall, negative.\n\nI felt ripped off like the tourist I was. I won't eat here again. The food's good, don't get me wrong (except the watered down chowder), but why would I pay twice the price?", "author": "Scott N."}

So this past Saturday, we stood in line for an hour to get into this joint for my seafood fix. \"Was it worth it?\" you ask...I say ehhhhhh, I've had better.\n\nBesides the long wait and the rocky bar stools, I would have to say their \"right off the dock\" and family style service was very endearing. A bit dirty for my taste but hey, it's like this if you were at a fresh fish market or a pier. Just don't wear white pants! \n\nWe ordered a dozen combination oysters, which included my favorite Kumamoto oysters for $27, crab cocktail $20, bowl of clam chowder $5 and scallop Sicilian style $8 each. The oysters had tons of sand in it and for that price, I've had better at Water Grill and everywhere else for that matter. I mean it's fine when it's just a few of the dozen that's filled with sand but when it's 10 out of 12, come on. I have oysters at least once a week, so I know what I'm talking about here. As for the crab cocktail, they redeemed themselves with their special Louise dipping sauce. Clam chowder was super watery and you could see the separation of oil and cream. The best thing about this trip was the Sicilian style scallop. They took 1 large fresh scallop, thinly sliced into 4-6 pieces, drizzle with EVOO, capers and red onion bits (not on the menu btw).\n\nOverall, I think I will come back on a weekday, by myself so I don't have to wait and order everything else on the menu.

Just a guy who serves you at the bar and a giant menu up on the wall. \n\nWe start a cup of the clam chowder which is not as soupy as I've had elsewhere. But it's very rich and full of flavor. Possibly one of the best clam chowders I've ever had.\n\nNext came the crab fat and requisite sourdough for dipping while we waited for our oysters and combination seafood salad. As a Korean, I've had \"crab fat\" mixed with rice and other spicy goodies plenty of times growing up. But at Swan Oyster, it was cold, and didn't have much flavor. Still tasty but could've been even better. The super spicy hot sauces they had on hand packed too much intensity and didn't really work with the flavors.\n\nThe oysters were extremely fresh (like everything else I had that day), and the salad was this huge, shareable mountain of crab and shrimp. By the time the uni arrived, I wanted to die of happiness from being full of delicious seafood.\n\nSwan Oyster is the place locals go. And tourists.

I'm from Maryland -- where even babies eat steamed crabs -- and then lived in New England for 5 years -- where even babies eat clam chowder. Seafood is a part of me.\n\nBut the food's just not very good here. Take the clam chowder for example. It's a unique recipe, yes -- thin and oily, with hardly any clams. I've never had anything like it before... and I hope I never do again. It's no accident that they put giant bowls of oyster crackers in front of you: once you add the crackers, they become the best part of the soup.\n\nThen there's the crab \"salad,\" which I couldn't have been more excited about before I ordered it. For $24.50, I expected a lot of crab, and that's what I got. Unfortunately, it was maybe 60% leg/claw meat and only 40% \"thigh\" meat, which means it was 60% tough and rubbery. As for the vegetables that make it a \"salad,\" it's only shredded iceberg lettuce. Shredded lettuce! The same lettuce you find in a Taco Bell soft taco.\n\nSo, to recap: for $30 total, I got a pile of unseasoned crab, some shredded lettuce, a drizzle of Louie sauce (aka light Russian dressing), and a bowl of watered-down clam chowder. All this would still probably be worth 3 stars but for the fact that there was a wait at 10:30 in the morning on a Wednesday to sit down for blunch.\n\n2 stars, and utterly not worth the trouble.

Right around the corner from our hotel is the famous Swan Oyster Depot.  My niece says \"It's been on my to-do list for the longest time\", so off we go and get into line.  This line - it literally took us 2 hours of patient standing to get into this place.  Our mouths were watering, our stomachs were empty.  Oh, how we were anticipating having some rich, buttery crab. \n\nAnd oh, were we disappointed!  My niece ordered the Octopus Salad.  \"Sorry, we're out of octopus.\"  I ordered a cup of clam chowder and the half crab.  \"Sorry, we're out of crab.\"  Now if I stand in line for 2 hours, I DO NOT want to settle for my 2nd or 3rd choice.  My husband - was in the same boat.  Crab was the name of the game for him as well.  Fortunately for him, he's equally capable of eating oysters, so he (and my niece) ordered the dozen oysters, with 3 or 4 different varieties.  I just can't do the cold, slimy food, so I ordered prawn salad.  \n\nFirst, the waiter brought 2 cups of clam chowder, but I guess in the confusion over the lack of crab he didn't hear me order any soup.  No problem; it came out very promptly.  Then the 2 plates of oysters arrived, but no prawn salad.  He said:  \"Did you order anything?\"  and then he proceeded to make my prawn salad.  This consisted of a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce, and about 8 very large, delicious shrimp, with a side of Louie dressing.  Now, this was very good, but I was expecting - a salad.  You know, with tomatoes, and onions, and all kinds of good things.  I mean, this was $21, and while those shrimp were delicious - this was robbery.\n\nWould we have waited if they had put out a sign in front that said \"Sorry, no crab available today\"?   No, we wouldn't. (The waiter said they hadn't had it for 2 days.) There were plenty of other very famous (and infamous) places in that neighborhood to eat, and we wouldn't have waited 2 hours in the cold.  So I understand why there was no sign outside.  But at the end of the meal, we laid out over $100 for a less than satisfying lunch.  We did enjoy the ambiance.  It's fun sitting at a counter, reading the old signs, watching the bustling activity and since we were near the door, we watched all the take-out happening, the directions given, etc.  It was great entertainment.  But still....I hate to be crabby, but man, we REALLY wanted crab.  Maybe the next time, San Francisco?  \n\nAnd a little P.S. is due here:  Sunday, we did the seriously touristy San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf, and let me tell you - there was NO shortage of crab there!", "author": "Joan L."}

Yes, with their crazy hours, it's hard to swing on by there on a weekday, and weekends are just out for me.\n\nI was back in the city by the bay and had a free weekday afternoon all to myself.  Why not hit up Swan's Oyster Depot finally.  I had heard about the ridiculous lines going out the door, but I was up for the challenge.  \n\nAs I approached this small store right before 1 pm, there was no line in sight.  All the seats were taken at the counter and when they asked if I was dining in by myself, they said there was a seat opening up in just a second.  I realized I came just in time as the line starting forming right behind me.\n\nAs I waited for my seat to clear, I noticed the fresh seafood in the window display and the constant movement of all the workers behind the counter.  It was busy.  People were eating and talking.  Some were loitering, as I would call it.  I asked one of the workers what their most popular dish was and he said the Combo Seafood Salad, Clam Chowder, Combo Seafood Cocktail, etc.  \n\nFinally squeezing into my counter seat, the worker saw me struggle with my purse and offered to put it behind the counter on the top shelf.    (How perfect!  I don't have to put it on the floor, have it occupy my lap while I'm enjoying my meal, or attempt to find room on the actual counter itself.)  He asked if he could get me something to drink and I stuck with water.  He also offered me bread too, which I so gladly accepted.  Since it was just me eating on my own, I opted for the Combo Seafood Salad for $15.75.  It's a chunk of change for lunch on your own though.  \n\nI watched as lettuce was piled onto my plate, then crab meat, prawns, more crab meat and bay shrimp were added.  I choice Louie dressing for my salad, as you can have it with oil and vinegar if you choose.  When my salad was placed in front of me (check out the picture!), I could easily understand why this was a popular dish.  This was indeed a seafood salad, with the lettuce only being an accessory and more like a bed for the seafood to sit on.  The crab meat was fresh, and the prawns were cooked perfectly.  Plump and just yummy!\n\nWhen it comes down to it, my salad was great!  It was filling, tasty, and just oh so fresh.  I saw them put together quite a few Combo Seafood Cocktails with prawns, crab meat, an oyster, and a bit of oyster water  to top it off.  It sure looked good and I wish I could have ordered one.\n\nThe staff are friendly and easy-going.  You can easily be a regular here or a newbie, and you'll be treated all the same.  And don't worry about dining here alone, you have a better chance to get seated quickly if you do.  And plus, you can observe all the other patrons dining here.    \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I had a great time here and can agree that it's worth the five stars.  It might even be worth the wait too.  The seafood is fresh and tasty and I wish I could have ordered more.  (The cocktails, the clam chowder, oysters and clams on the half shell, etc.)  It's not a cheap eat for one thing though, and I wish I had more weekday afternoons to enjoy this place.", "author": "Teri C."}

What better time to try Swan Oyster Depot?\n\nParking was surprisingly easy near Polk, although only for a 1 hour meter maximum.  Given the stories of the long wait, I was a bit worried about having to make multiple trips to the meter god, but the siren call of \"the best seafood in SF\" beckoned louder than those worries.\n\nAlready a line had formed and the small, cozy place was bustling with activity inside.  Multiple people arrived as we waited (~20 minutes) to pick up to-go orders and I have to admit I was a bit surprised about some of the tabs (over $100).  Still, with the sun glowing warmly, waiting in line was definitely a nice experience and one I'm surprised I had never experienced while I lived in the city (though I probably couldn't afford it then).  People drank beer as they waited and most chatted pleasantly with each other.  The couple in front of us had driven all the way from Santa Barbara and had been going to Swan most weekends since they were children.  All in all, good signs.\n\nAfter the quicker than expected wait, we made it to the counter and proceeded to order the dishes most in line had recommended:\n\nClam chowder soup - brothy and strong, with no hint of milk that most are probably used to with other chowders.  The chowder was an excellent start before all the cold food and was notable for the minimal amount of potatoes.\n\nOyster - A variety of 4 types, all of the oysters were extremely fresh.  I was a bit surprised at how small one variety was, but I know next time to just order by saying \"Give me one dozen of the biggest fellas.\"  Definitely as good as Hog Island; points for the abundant selection of sauces: red onion-vinegar, cocktail sauce and horseradish.  \n\nPrawn Cocktail - For $8.50, it was essentially four cold prawns in a glass.  Reasonably fresh, but I was a bit disappointed given the high price and lack of preparation.  Unless I live in the boonies and don't have access to fresh seafood during the winter months, I can't imagine what's so special about this.  In fact, I can go to Safeway, pick up a 1 LB bag of prawns for $21 and make 10 of these cocktails.  \n\nCombination salad - For $17.50, the salad consisted of lettuce sprinkled with a generous helping of crab, shrimp and prawns.  Dressing choices are oil & vinaigrette or the famous Louie sauce.  Pardon my ignorance, but isn't Louie sauce just Thousand Island Dressing?  It sure looks like it.  I'll admit the taste is slightly different, but I wasn't impressed.  Again, while the serving of seafood was generous, to me, it was just cold, cooked crab, shrimp, and prawns.  I'm positive I can get as fresh a selection at any local seafood shop or even Whole Foods and recreate my own \"combination salad;\" with higher quality lettuce to boot.\n\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed.  Given the stellar reviews, I definitely expected more.  Perhaps I'm spoiled.  When I say fresh seafood, I mean rock cod that I just caught that morning or cooked prawns that I just bought live from the Marina Food Market.  Heck, I've even ate lobster sashimi where the lobster tentacles were still moving!  That's fresh!  Maybe in a location where people just eat microwaved dinners and canned goods, the food here would be amazing, but we live in the Bay Area!  Seafood is everywhere and live seafood is too.  I enjoyed the ambiance, loved chatting with the other customers, but thought the food (other than the oysters) was average fare.  Sorry.  \n\nBy the way, be sure to bring your wallet.  All that fresh seafood ain't cheap.  Our bill came to ~$65 and it's cash only, all the time...", "author": "Randy F."}

While on a mini-vacation to San Francisco with my sister, we agreed that while there we had to dedicate a day to eating just seafood. We were researching different places on Yelp and the nearest to our hotel was Swan Oyster Depot. The reviews seem to be a hit or miss, so we continued to research, but seem to come back to Swan Oyster Depot. Yes, we read that the wait can be really long, but we wanted to know what the fuss was about. I mean, they have a long wait for a reason, right? Why would you wait in line for so long if the food isn`t good?\n\nWe woke up kind of early because we wanted to try to beat the rush. Luckily, there were some stools available by the time we got there. It was about 10 o`clock in the morning, and there were already people inside. The place is really small. Only enough room behind the counter for the guys to walk back and forth from one end of the bar to the other and only enough room at the bar for you to find a seat. There are only 18 stools in the place, no tables. If you happen to find a seat open, snag it as fast as you can because people are always coming in and out of the place. Not recommended for large parties.\n\nWe sat down, got some waters, and looked over their small menu, which is up on the wall. My sister also got a beer (yup, at 10 o`clock in the morning). The two things we really wanted to get were the dozen Mixed Oysters and the Combination Salad, which were highly talked about on Yelp. I can`t remember where all the oysters came from, but there was one from Washington that was really good. Briny, tons of oceanic flavor, with just a squeeze of lemon, and it`s the best bite you could ever put in your mouth. So fresh! The Combination Salad alone, is something that I would come back again and again. Shredded lettuce, fresh crab, prawns, baby shrimp, and a side of Louis Dressing. Sounds pretty plain, right? Trust me, simple done right is the best. The seafood is sweet, flavorful, and generous.\n\nWhen you come here, be prepared to make a dent in your wallet. It may be expensive, but it`s fresh, high-quality seafood. Worth every penny. Make sure you bring cash. These guys do it old school.\n\nWhile eating, it started to get a little busy.

If you have a few days in the city and are on a tight budget, brave the lines and come for what will be a memorable dining experience. \n\nFor a pseudo-native Bostonian like myself, the Boston Clam Chowder was up to par. It preluded the rest of the food very well: tasty, but not too salty, clean-tasting, not rich, like what good seafood should be. Apart from the chowder, we ordered the oysters, scallops, and a sea urchin. \n\nThe oysters really stood out, probably some of the best oysters I've ever had. \n\nThe scallops were generously-sized and had great texture, though I wish they had a sweeter taste. \n\nMy friend and I shared an entire sea urchin for $16, which yielded six melt-in-your-mouth pieces of ocean goodness. At a Japanese restaurant, you'd typically pay the same amount for two pieces of uni nigiri, which is how I think it ultimately measures up. I've had tasted better-quality seafood at premium Japanese restaurants elsewhere, but for what you end up paying, the value was incomparable.", "author": "Alastair S."}

The hour passed surprisingly quickly, and luckily for my boyfriend and I, once we were in the doorway we were ushered to our seats within five minutes. As we were waiting we were able to gawk at the fresh seafood that was on display (on ice) in the window, all of which looked fantastic. \n\nI was eager to sit down at the counter seating (one of about 12-15 seats) and to put in our order for a late lunch. We started off with a bowl of the clam chowder and two Anchor Steam beers. The clam chowder was generously served with loads of clam throughout the soup. The chowder wasn't incredibly rich or thick, in fact I'd even venture to describe the liquid as somewhat thin. At first I was a little put off by this, but the liquid was flavorful and it made the focus of the soup on the claims. The bread and butter that they served as a side to the soup was fantastic. My only complaint is that the sourdough bread wasn't served warm, as the sourdough flavor was incredible and greatly complimented the soup. We generously sopped up the broth with the bread, which was a great combination.\n\nAfter we polished off our soup, we decided to split the crab salad with the louie sauce. My oh my, this was absolutely incredible. The base of the salad was a simple iceburg/romaine mix that was topped with a heaping portion of fresh chilled crab with a side of louie sauce. The crab was sweet and succulent and stood out wonderfully on its own. The louie sauce kicked up the flavor of the salad immensely, and I found myself alternating bites of the salad with and without the sauce. I'd highly recommend this salad, but definitely to share so that you can try more of the menu (and also due to its large portion size).\n\nThe service was overall attentive and friendly, but it took us awhile to get the check which I found odd as there was still a large line outside. As many others have mentioned, this restaurant definitely isn't the most sanitary as they're constantly handling raw fish/vegetables/etc without washing their hands. I also ventured back to the restroom which was next to the filthy kitchen. I'm glad I witnessed this after eating, as it was pretty disgusting. Although, all that being said, I didn't get sick from these conditions, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.\n\nIf you're in San Francisco and looking for a unique seafood diner experience, definitely hit up Swan Oyster Depot.", "author": "Megan K."}

My friend was hosting an AirBB guest and wanted to give her a tour on her last day so I joined and we did Coit Towers, the Pink Ladies, Lombard St. (the crooked street), Haight Ashbury, and happened upon Swan Oyster with hardly any line!  So we got in line and prepared ot have lunch at this almost 100 year old Oyster/seafood old school counter spot. The proprieter an adorable one of two brothers and his son helped us, greeted almost everyone by name with their takeout orders and as we sat at the end of the bar, I definitely felt that sense of community. \n\nA young woman peeked in around the line to ask one of the owners if there are other locations and if they have a card, he looked at her deadpan like she was crazy and said no. I had to laugh, quietly. In my opinion nothing about Swan Oyster says chain, franchise or even business card. It's straight up old school, and Gangster good. All the seafood is fresh and seasonal, so what's available is about what's available, our international friend had 10 Oysters, sampling two of each of the days featured goods, I opted for some clam chowder, so delish! and M had Mixed Seafood Cocktail, which looked amaze. Not to mention the fresh sourdough w/ butter which I could live off. \n\nThe guys working the counters are in pictures for decades, and it's crazy endearing. A true family business where the current brothers/owners inherited from their father and work with their sons. LOVE. We even got a story and some Swan Oyster sponges. Adorbs....Felt absolutely special. Tons of folks were also picking up fresh fist to take home too. The coolest fish market/seafood restaurant I've been to!\n\nI love an old school joint with good food, real folk and great atmosphere. \n\nWill definitely be back. \n\nNo credit cards, no websites, no other locales.

I went for a bowl of clam chowder and a half dozen blue point oysters which I shared with her, I could have ate the whole plate of oysters alone, they were so fresh and with the horseradish and cocktail sauce mixed together, they were awesome! Here crab Louie salad was delicious and turthfully it had more crab then greens and we are not talking about slivers of crab, but large chunks of fresh dungeness crab, it was to die for, their thousand island dressing is full of flavor and this salad is a must try for anyone craving a good salad.\n\nPlace is a bit pricey for being a dive, but so worth it.

The nonuse of serving utensils. Everything is served with the employees bare hands, and I'm talking hands with no gloves on.\n\n2.

Servers going to throw out the trash only to come back behind the bar and continue serving food with their BARE hands without even washing them. \n\n4. Locals coming in to get to-go orders that take forever and ever to fulfill and making the area where you stand closest to the entrance uncomfortably crowded and impersonal. \n\n5. How bland and watery the clam chowder is. \n\n6. How the crab fat (one of the most celebrated dishes) is nothing more than cold water with pieces of useless crab particles. I can't even say it tastes bad because it honestly doesn't taste like anything. \n\n7. This one is something I may have only had the privilege of witnessing, but I think it deserves credit on this list nonetheless.  A woman sitting next to me asked for a shrimp cocktail. She ate a few shrimp with her BARE hands (that have been God knows where) and then asked the server if she could change it for the bigger shrimp cocktail.

Always a good east/west coast mix and so perfectly tasty with mignonette or cocktail sauce loaded with as much horseradish as you care to heap in (hint... go for a blow the top of your head off quantity). The combo Louie salad is nice as well with jumbo and bay shrimp and plenty of fresh, briny crab atop a bunch of shredded lettuce. Basic story is I've always been happy no matter what I've ordered. \n\nFinally... Price. It's not cheap by any stretch but paying for quality is always an ok thing in my book.", "author": "Tom C."}

I'm not a stranger to waiting for food, but I got a little impatient... then I got in, and I ordered their seafood salad and clam chowder. After some time chit-chatting with the friendly guys behind the counter (and many tummy growls later), I received my food I was blown away by the quality and freshness of the food.  Their salad, although slightly pricey, is the perfect presentation of seafood salad! It had a light dressing that complemented the crab and shrimp VERY well, and it was so, so filling.  Although the clam chowder is a lot thinner than what I'm normally used to, it's probably the most flavorful and fresh chowder I will ever find. The clams were SO good--no fluff or fillers in this chowder, you can count on that.  Swan Oyster Depot sets the bar really high for clam chowda :)\n\nThe guys behind the counter were personable and warm. I loved my experience here and thought the awfully long wait was... definitely worth it.

It wasn't at all, and it was really pricey. Huge disappointment.\n\nWe had: 6 oysters, 2 cups clam chowder, 1 combo seafood salad, 1 sashimi plate, 1 ice tea.  Total = $75 before tip.\nI think we were actually overcharged $5-10 in retrospect though I don't think it was intentional - just that they are busy and there are a lot of folks behind the counter running around, so it's chaotic. Plus some of the prices are not listed like the sashimi plate - or maybe that thing was $30+ dollars, which would be a joke. Or possibly, we were charged for bowls, not cups, of the soup.\n\nAnyway, the quality is fresh - sure. But they were out of crab and uni. I understand as it's somewhat seasonal or varies by day, but those were the 2 main things my friend wanted to try. Anyway, clam chowder was fine but not the best I've ever had by any means. Oysters were good. Seafood salad and sashimi plate were okay - slightly disappointing. \n\nIt is far from the best seafood I've ever had. I've been to the Tsukiji markets in Japan and I guess that is my criteria for the ultimate. I wasn't expecting the ultimate at Swan Oyster, but I though it'd be pretty darn good. It fell short, waaaaaaaay short. And it was pricey. \n\nOther notes: the wait wasn't bad because we came on a weekday after lunch, so there were about 10 people ahead of us.

Obviously, this place got STELLAR reviews, so we were SUPER excited to come. Even waited outside in line for about 45 minutes as people very, very slowly ate their food (it's a bar setup, so there's very, very limited seating for the amount of traffic they actually get).\n\nAs we got closer to getting inside the place though, we started to feel less and less comfortable.\n\n1) One of the reviewers on here took photos of the menu. Let's just say the prices have gone up since then. The 'seafood salad' (a small plate of lettuce topped with a meager scoop of seafood) now averages around 20 bucks. 20. Really?! Even if it tastes like heaven, that is pretty damn steep for some shrimpies that aren't even properly cleaned! (Keep reading.) A couple sitting nearest the entrance got their bill: \"That'll be $130, please!\"\n\n2) So this place is cash only, right? How would you feel if your food were scooped by the bare hands of the same people handling all of that cash from customers' transactions? Ya know, think E. Coli and other fun germs on currency? All that seafood displayed in the window? Not a single tong or utensil--these guys use their hands, wipe 'em down on their aprons afterward, and then top your salad. With the occasional grabbing of a pearing knife to clean out a prawn further for your seafood cocktail because its line of poopies / guts are still in there.\n\n\nSo we were like okay, screw that, let's just get some clam chowder and bread and go food hunting elsewhere. \n\nClam chowder was runny as hell. All that fresh flavor you other reviewers raving about? Dude, they've got bottles of clam juice lined up right behind the soup canteen right there. Come on!!! It's not from the clams themselves. There were barely any clams in the soup, the potato chunks were tiny and uh... gosh, I prefer Chunky at this rate. \n\nBread was wonderful. Big heal of one for just a buck. ;)\n\n\nMoral of the story: STOP PERPETUATING THE MYTH and falling for the typical big city trap of \"I'm a tourist, therefore ill-informed\" or \"I've made it in life, see me eat in this joint like it's nothing at all.\" Impress people elsewhere if you wanna throw cash down. Again, I'm sure the seafood is great, but there is no way that it can be justified by the horrendous prices given the hygiene of the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "Undoubtedly one of the smallest establishments in Nob Hill, Swan Oyster Depot is larger than life and arguably, the best seafood restaurant in San Francisco. For locals, this is an institution that epitomizes the best of San Francisco. For tourists, it's a required visit as part of one's itinerary. \n\n\n\n\"THE UGLY DUCKLING\"\n\nOriginally called Cable Oyster Depot, Swan was founded by the Lausten brothers, Danish immigrants whose business came to a halt following the 1906 earthquake that crippled San Francisco. Despite enduring personal devastation, they rode a horse drawn wagon to Golden Gate Park replete with provisions and a sign that read, \"Free flour and water from Swan Oyster Depot. Remember us.\" The Lausten's rebuilt the store across the street and re-opened it as Swan Oyster Depot in 1912. The name and icon of a swan is a symbol of good fortune and transformation in Denmark. No story better illustrates this than Danish author Hans Christian Anderson's \"The Ugly Duckling.\" In 1946, the Lausten brothers sold their business to Sal Sancimino and today, his family continues the tradition of serving the best seafood.  Although Swan Oyster Depot has seen transformation, both within and outside of its walls, the good fortune has never run dry.\n\n\n\n\"HEY GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?\" - My order included.\n\nSMOKED SALMON PLATE- thin slices of smoked salmon with fresh cracked black pepper, finely chopped red onion, and capers on 1/4 inch thick rye. The salmon pops with smoky flavor, hitting your nose before you take a bite in a very good way. Utterly amazing and nothing quite like it: 5/5.\nCOMBINATION SALAD- shrimp, succulent prawns, crab on a bed of thin sliced Iceberg lettuce. Add a couple teaspoons of their in-house Louie dressing and you have a fantastic dish: 4/5.\nBOSTON-STYLE CLAM CHOWDER- slightly creamy with small bits of crab and potato. A cup is sufficient if one is looking to enjoy several menu items: 4/5.\n\n\n\n\"GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!\" -The charm of the Sancimino family.\n\nThe Sancimino family's passion for top notch seafood is rivaled only by their captivating charm, traits accentuated by the intimacy of the establishment itself. Brandon, our server, moved about and joshed with the proprietors and patrons alike. Unconventional is the norm here: everything but the clam chowder is handled by a bare hand and dine-in orders are never written down. Getting in and out of the premises is a tight squeeze. The chatter and archaic wall phone ringing periodically requires one to raise their voice a little. However, once you sit down and grab your first order and pint, the noise transforms into a melodic soundtrack and nothing but the present company and food matter. \n\n\n\"HOW LONG YOU BEEN WAITING?\" -Lessons learned from my visit.\n\n-Finding parking in Nob Hill is challenging. Take the MUNI, grab a cab, or walk. Keep in mind that it's an uphill climb if walking from Chinatown or Union Square.\n\n-To avoid a long wait, come before noon. In my most recent visit, arriving at 2 pm on a Saturday, we waited 2.5 hours.\n\n-Do not come with a party of 5 or more. The place only seats 18 people. \n\n-Take-out/pick up orders have a separate line, left side of the entrance when facing the store. If there is no line, that means you're first in line. For orders called in advance, remember whom you spoke to because they may have placed your order in the fridge pending your arrival. You don't want to have them making double orders, do you?\n\n-Their homemade Louie sauce goes well with the seafood salads. The red cocktail sauce is best with oysters. Tabasco hot sauce is also available.\n\n-As the day progresses, the store will slowly run out of seafood. Do not come too late in the day.\n\n-Anchor Steam and Stella Artois are on tap. White wine is also served.", "author": "Tom R."}

Most of the stuff just gets shucked/cracked/sliced and served right up.  All is done in front of the small counter which seats like 10 people.  \n\nI prefer the seafood cocktails over the seafood salads.  I don't know how much of the total price those lettuce account for, but I found that I wasn't interested in even a bite of it.  Also, not exactly a fan of the tiny bland shrimps that come in the combination salad/cocktails.  That's all the bad things I could say though.  The oysters, crabs, prawns, fresh scallops, and clam chowder are all delicious.  The best I have to say are the fresh shucked clams--super juicy, super plump--and the crab backs, which are rich and savory and one of my absolute favorite things to eat.

I think there are about 14 seats available.  \nWe had the dozen mixed oysters on half shell, Sicilian sashimi (tuna, salmon, halibut, yellowtail, and scallop), and the clam chowder.  Oysters were very fresh, and tasted great with the various condiment sauces the store made.  The sashimi was good.  The fish was fresh, but it was similar (but not better) than Japanese style sashimi, just with olive oil, capers and chopped onions.  The clam chowder was a pass for us... It was fishy and wasn't as creamy --- definitely more homemade, but not as tasty as other clam chowders we've had.\nI think the biggest gripe I had was the value for the food.

JUST WOW. HOLY EFF. WOW. OMG. MMMMM. ---- some combination of those words were spoken in between every bite of food. \n\nI started off with a cup of clam chowder ($2.75). It did not have the thick, creamy consistency I'm used to with other clam chowders and the proportion of clam meat-to-broth was a bit sparse for my taste, but the broth was really, really good. Intensely infused with briny, seafood goodness and laced with butter, SOD's clam chowder was the perfect start to the meal. \n\nNext, we tried a dozen mixed oysters ($26). I was excited that SOD had some of my favorites available: Miyagi, Kumamoto, and Blue Point. The Kumamato is a GIANT among oyster-lovers, which is ironic because it is quite small. SOD's Kumamotos were perfection: petite and bursting with sweetness. The Miyagis had a bit more meat on them and were crisp with only a mild brininess. The Blue Points were fresh, crisp, and firm, with a sweet aftertaste that was 2nd to the Kumamotos. With a dab of home made horseradish, cocktail sauce, and a squeeze of lemon, the oysters were OUTSTANDING. \n\nThen, we had the Combination salad ($20), which was basically a large plateful of shredded lettuce topped with a generous portion of bay shrimps, 4-5 large prawns, and 6-8 sweet crab morsels. Definitely a filling entree to split between 2 people. A delicious side of home made thousand island dressing accompanied the salad. A bit of sweet seafood + crisp lettuce + sharp horseradish + sweet thousand island dressing all atop a piece of bread = scrumptious makeshift open faced sandwich. \n\nThe ambiance of SOD only adds to the experience: sitting at the counter, watching all the servers bustle by, friendly banter with the servers, faded pictures on the wall, and a wait for it... a gold crucifix shining bright in the middle of the wall. Nothing says \"old school SF\" like fresh seafood + Jesus. \n\nA ~$60 lunch for 2 people, but WELL WORTH IT. \n\nThere's seafood. There's seafood in San Francisco. And then there's Swan Oyster Depot. Try it for yourself if you can stand the wait. (Damn you, Anthony Bourdain!)\n\nNote: If you're jonesing for the SF seafood experience, but can't make SOD's line or hours, make a reservation at Hyde Street Seafood House.

Sure, we had to wait but on a week day early afternoon we were only 30-45 minutes from the bar. My boyfriend was amused by my salivation and lip smacking as I gawked at seafood salads, cocktails and the like prepared for other lucky patrons inside.\n\nOnce we saddled up to the bar, I had no idea what to order and asked our super helpful server Darren what to do when you want it all?\n\nHis sage advice? Take it slow, how about you start with some oysters.\n\nWhich was our plan exactly. We started with six oysters (kumamoto, miyagi, blue points) and clams. So fresh, I wanted more. But no - there were other crustaceans to be had. \n\nFrom there it was on to a mammoth prawn cocktail. Good lord these prawns are behemoths. \n\nDo yourself a favor and dive in to the sauces provided counter-side. The house made horseradish packs a wallop that keeps you coming back, onion vinegar is great but the real gem was in a tiny dish swimming with amazing spiciness and favor - a habanero, other pepper, garlic, cilantro and vinegar number.\n\nThe half cracked Dungeness Crab rocked it. Sweet, succulent, buttery goodness within every shell. Only surprise was the cool temperature the crab was served. Good, but I thought it'd be warm. In fact, nothing is served warm wave the clam chowder. I was *thisclose* to ordering a second when I again took Darren's advice and slowed down to take it all in. All of these tidbits of heaven fill you up, even if you don't think so at first check. \n\nI wavered between a sashimi plate of super fresh catch, but we were having sushi later that night so I decided this would be overkill. We settled on a bowl of the clam chowder. As most have mentioned, the soup is a thinner consistency that I'm used to but it was perfect. The milky flavorful broth found all of the crevasses needed filling in my tummy. Remember that habanero/pepper/cilantro sauce I mentioned before? Toss some of that in to your chowder. It'll change the entire flavor profile.\n\nI should also mention the crab head. Also served cold which is a bit, well different, but just as good. Sopping up the fat and eggs with the crusty sourdough is all of it. \n\nAt the end of what must have been an hour, I had to kindly ask that they remove what remained of the wreckage else I wouldn't have been able to rise from my stool.\n\nBut I'll be back...\n\nAmazing service, great personalities and fantastic food.

We went when they opened at 10:30, but the line got kind of intense after, and since it's a small place with just one row of seats at the bar, the line probably moves pretty slowly.\n\nLove the combination seafood salad, although next time I'll probably get just the crab, because that was to die for. The shrimp was also very tasty, but I thought the prawns were just okay. The chowder was also perfect for a cold day. It's not as ridiculously creamy as the clam chowder you think of when you think New England, but I kind of like that better.\n\nI will definitely come back for some oysters in the near, near future!", "author": "jon y."}

I know this place has been here for a while and how many people can be ignorant about some peoples dietary decisions and restrictions such as vegan, and this place was all seafood and we both knew it did not have vegan friendly options for food. When one of the older gents came to take our orders I got half cracked crab, two oysters, and clam chowder which I recommend greatly its like 5 bucks or less for a cup of it so its definitely worth a try! Now this gent is asking my friend what she'd like, and at this time theres a line out the door, seating is filled and she's getting nervous because she ain't here for the seafood, so she asks in a whisper if they have anything vegan, at this point I'm pretty nervous as well, I was scared they might tell her to leave or be rude about her question. He didn't quit understand what vegan was, but was nice as hell about it, so she explained and accommodated her the best he could, they had fresh berries in the fridge that he offered her and some of their sourdough toast without butter  and black coffee.

We came at about 4:30 on a Friday, so we had just enough time to eat before they closed and didn't have to wait too long considering how popular this place is. I love that this place is not on the wharf where the seafood tends to be pretty mediocre. Yes, this place was kind of expensive, but hello people, it's seafood! I'm willing to pay more for quality seafood. \n\nI ordered the clam chowder and the seafood combo salad. The chowder was more brothy than creamy which I enjoyed--not that goopy junk you get on the wharf! The combo salad was a little pricey, but they gave me so much seafood that I had to take some of it home with me, so that's a pretty good value in my book. Yea, the lettuce is junk, but the louie dressing was delicious. I always avoided it since I had a really bad louie dressing once, but I'm glad I gave this one a chance! The crab and lobster were really tasty, shrimp was pretty standard. My friends enjoyed their oysters, but I can't speak for those because I'm not a fan.\n\nIs this the best seafood in the world? I'm gonna say probably not, but I enjoyed the food and the experience. I wanted good seafood in SF and that's what I got. I liked the dingy vibe, the cramped quarters, and the staff was friendly & efficient--no frills, no gimmicks. \n\nWould recommend to seafood lovers visiting SF!

As a teaser, the one solitary window you see is filled with the freshest looking crabs, shrimp, clams, oysters in the window. When you walk in, it's one long narrow hall, pretty much, of barstools and the most satisfied and happy looking people chowin' down. All of the guys behind the counter were very patient and informative about all the seafood they had to offer and mixing up special sauce concoctions to go along with your treasures.\n\nArmed with my Anchor Steam beer (go San Francisco!), here's what I ordered on this day. And in this particular order:\n\n+ Clam chowder - there was no skimping on the bits of clam in my chowder cup. It wasn't overly watery and not too creamy, and extremely flavorful and warm. This went along lovely with my fresh sourdough bread and butter!\n+ Half dozen oysters - these are NOT your oysters from the Gulf of Mexico people, thank goodness! These went far and beyond expectations! I can't remember where they were all from, but included Blue Bay Oysters, some from Japan, Washington...very fresh, creamy, and flavorful with some lemon squeezed on. Deeeeeelicious!\n+ Crab cocktail - for $12, I got a very good portion of the meatiest, tastiest crab meat. Eating it alone or with some lemon, cocktail sauce, or mayo, you'll be golden.\n\nSome pointers:\n*Cash only\n*get there EARLY like when they open. Otherwise, count on an hour or longer wait\n*the wait is substantially shorter if even a wait at all if you order to go. But I can imagine if you want the whole experience, you'll have to wait in line.\n\nI would have been equipped to anhiliate this place if I had my significant other and foodie partner in crime to help me out!

I came on a Saturday afternoon (around 1pm) and thankfully, I stood in line with a cup of Philz because there is no way I would have been a happy camper without something to temporarily satiate my hunger for that hour long wait. I live about a block away from this place and I have never not seen a line out the door. But as the reviews say, it's worth it (at least once, for the experience).\n\nGood things\n- Combination salad: Baby shrimp, large shrimp, crab meat; a plethora of deliciously fresh, fresh seafood. The guy that served us recommended we get the Louie dressing, which pretty much tasted like thousand island. I'd ask for less of the sauce next time, as it took away from the taste of the seafood, but overall this dish is a must-order. It's filling too, which is nice when it costs like $20. WORTH IT.\n- Half cracked crab: I don't know how great of a critic I am, since the only time I've had crab meat even remotely close to this style is in Chinese food (so really, not fresh at all and mostly just oily and fried). It was easy to peel here (because it comes cracked) and it's really good with the cocktail sauce, but even better with just a tiny squirt of the provided lemon wedges. \n- Sourdough bread: San Francisco knows good bread. Swan Oyster Depot has good bread. Keep asking for this; they staff will cut more and more for you.\n- Awesome experience: This is mainly why you have to wait in that long line at least once. You get in and grab a seat on the marble countertop and wait until one of the super awesome staff comes to ask what you want. They are attentive, provide meaningful recommendations, and demonstrate excellent service (i.e. the guy saw me eyeing their smoked salmon as he was slicing it, and gave us a sample.

The place was almost empty, with a few folks at the back of the restaurant (not sure if they were eating or not).  One of the servers tells us that they only serve take outs from 8 to 11am, and we should return at 11 to get seated.  We figured those people in there were just friends or special patrons.  My husband and I had an hour to kill, so we hung out  a local coffee shop for 30 minutes and returned to Swan thinking we'll just wait outside for another 30.  When we came back at exactly 10:30 am, the restaurant was fully packed with customers and we were behind 20+ people standing in line!  Since the restaurant can only seat ~16-18 people at a time, I knew it was going to be a long wait.  I was pretty pissed off at this point and wanted to leave, but my husband talked me into staying.\n\nAs it happens, people waiting in front of us were told the same thing, \"come back at 11 am.\" I also heard another couple passing by, cursing.  I can only guess they were also told the same.  The line was quite long by 10:45...maybe around 50 folks at one point, but some of them ended up just leaving or ordering take-out.  \n\n1 hour and 45 minute later, we get seated.  Here is my verdict.\n\nOyster mix dozen - very fresh, but you can find comparables elsewhere.\nCherry stone clams - very fresh and sweet. good. \nSashimi plate, Italian style - again, very fresh, but nothing special..just olive oil and capers.\nClam Chowder - clam flavor was more intense, and unlike for other reviewers, I didn't get much clams in my bowl.  I personally didn't care for it too much.  My husband liked it.\n\nI would have given it 4 stars for the food alone.  I am taking away 1 star for wasting our precious vacation time, and another star for the insanely insanitary conditions in which the guys handle/serve food.  I kept watch, and I didn't see anyone wash or clean their hands after scratching their faces, shaking hands with customers, handling cash, shucking oysters, grabbing crab meats, greens, dunking bare hands into a large caper jar (that probably won't be used up for a week or so).  They just grab everything with their bare hands and never wash them digits.  Remember, these are the same hands that touch each oyster and sashimi pieces you'll consume.\n\nI am not a squeamish type, but in this case, I will not come back regardless of how fresh their seafood is.

Also, if you like fresh raw oysters, these are hard to beat within the city limits.  The only thing I'd skip is the clam chowder, which I found a bit watery compared to truly authentic New England Clam Chowder.   Also, realize that this is, basically, a raw bar- so very few fancily-prepared or heavily sauced hot items on the menu- which is fine by me.  If you're going and paying for high-quality, fresh-off-the-boat seafood, it should be as simply prepared as possible to let the natural flavor shine through IMHO.\n\nThe waitstaff is gruff but lovable.

I think we could have ordered to go and been plenty happy. \n\nService was super friendly, very fun listening to the crew banter back and forth to each other while they prepare your food. We also had the clam chowder which was just amazingly fresh. When you get a clam chowder that is super fresh and all you can taste is the light freshness and it is not just buried in cream then you are at Swan Oyster Depot. \n\nI had just 3 oysters and I am not a super big fan of oysters in general so I can't give my opinion on them without bias. \n\nHighlights for me the chowder and crab salad (I bet the crab cocktail would be great too). \n\nSkip the line if it is more than 10 people deep, try a weekday or off hour if you can.", "author": "Kevin C."}

However, after two visits to Swan Oyster within the last three weeks, I find myself warming up to those slippery little suckers. \n\nThe mixed dozen for $25.00 is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the oysters you get. Anything with crab is dee-frickin'-licious - crab cocktail, crab in the shell, crab salad, combination salad. In fact, my favorite thing to do is slather a piece of bread with butter, crab louie dressing, and cocktail sauce and put a big chunk of crab (with lettuce so that I don't feel like a total scumbag) to make an impromptu crostini.

Ok, maybe because back in the day, I used to go get my own crab at the pier.  But I'm too lazy to do that now.  \n\nThis is the best time of year to go - early crab season.  Not just any crab.  The lovely pacific dungeness crabs.  And Swan's is the place to get it.  I can't begin to explain my excitement of getting my first crab cocktail here.  A glass cup overflowing with lump meat and a few nicely shaped leg meat.  Then you see a tray of freshly cracked crab walk by and are amazed at the wholeness of the crab leg meat all lined up.  I could have an eating frenzy of crab here, if I was rich that is.\n\nI'm not an oyster person, but you can see the different varieties they have in the back.  This is not a place for large crowds.  One straight counter and you are eating seafood shoulder to shoulder with about 20 other people.  Hate crowds?  Then get your grub to go.  \n\nI love people watching here, from the local and tourist patrons to the lively interaction of the staff (must be family - the way they talk to each other and call each other out).  \n\nMy M.O.:  Start with the clam chowder, though a little thin in consistency but good flavor, and go right for the crab cocktail.  I prefer mine with louie dressing instead of cocktail sauce.  They even have ponzu and soy sauce, along with vinegars, hot sauce, horseradish, lemons, etc.  If you want your veggies - get the crab louie.  \n\nI'm sure the shrimp, fish and oysters are good.

However, with a line with stretch ability that makes Nadia Comaneci seem incorrigibly rigid by comparison, I would strongly suggest going with someone who lives in Russian Hill so that you can just order your meal to go.  You are missing exactly nothing by dining inside the restaurant from an atmosphere perspective although the guys that work here legitimately seem to enjoy their craft.  I think they might be the friendliest seafood people I have ever met.  \n\nIn any event, regardless of how pleasant the people are that work here, the real reason that you are coming here should be for the oysters.  Having said that, Swan actually does a fine job with the rest of their seafood as well.  We enjoyed fresh prawns with a flavorful cocktail sauce, the crab Louie salad, and Littleneck clams before we attacked the various oysters at our disposal.  All of the items we ordered had the clean, fresh finish that I desire in seafood.  \n\nWhile you can order a number of oysters from Swan, if they happen to be heavily stocked in Kumamoto oysters, you should probably go for them.  Blue Point oysters are generally available as well, but the Kumamoto oysters are magnificent.  While you might initially be turned off by their smallish size, please remember that those small shells are actually quite deep and the oyster you find inside has a firm crisp texture with the slightest hint of brine.  There is a reason that many people consider them them the finest of all oysters.  The Mignonette pairs perfectly with these bivalves and would be my suggested course of action for a dipping sauce.  \n\nWhile you have many options for seafood in San Francisco, there is a reason this place has been reviewed 900+ times and still averages 4.5 stars on Yelp even when you factor in the idiots that damn a place for stupid reasons like 1) the wait is soooo long or 2) everyone else likes it, so I'm going to hate it.

One of us came @ 11:40am on a Thursday and got seated around 12:20pm, but by that time, the line was very long for those behind us...\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n* Clam Chowder - pretty good stuff.  Of course, all I ever knew was progresso soup and the occasional wharf chowder in a bread bowl.  This may be the best I've had so far because it wasn't super rich and heavy, but lightly creamy with fresh tasting clams.  5 stars.\n\n* Half a dozen oysters - these were good but not amazing.  The waiter gave us three types of oysters which were very fresh and what I liked was that there were so many different condiments available ~ mignonette, Tabasco, lemon, etc.  I give them only 4 stars since they didn't have my fave kumamotos.\n\n*Seafood Combo Salad - very nice light salad.  We opted to have dressing on the side.  The waiter gave us this creamy thousand dressing but then he made to order a Dijon vinaigrette which won us over.  Once again, very fresh and delish.  The salad comprised a bed of iceberg and romaine topped by varied seafood such as baby shrimp, tiger shrimp and crab.  4 stars.  Deducted a point since I'm not a super big fan of iceberg.\n\n* 1/2 Crab - super super fresh crab!  5 stars, nuff said.\n\n* Smoked Salmon on french bread - this was hands down my favorite dish.  The salmon had the perfect smokiness and the waiter gave us diced red onions and capers.  Super simple but just amazing.  5 stars.\n\nOverall, the service was quick and everyone was so friendly.  Really liked the laid back ambiance.  This place is a throwback to SF of the 60's//70's with vintage pieces and classic photos in a no frills setting.

So we waited about 30 minutes on a weekday afternoon (around 2pm). It was a small place where you can only sit at bar tables. The waiters were friendly and up to service. We ordered the seafood combo salad, half a dozen oysters, and a cup of clam chowder. \n\nI didn't try the oysters, but my hubby said it was freaking delicious and fresh. It was good with there sauce. The seafood combo salad was awesome too, it has fresh crab meat, shrimp and baby shrimp with lettuce. They give you two sauce: Louie sauce and the cocktail sauce. Both sauces were fantastic. Though I prefer the cocktail sauce, I think it was homemade.\n\nOverall, it was well worth the wait to try this place. I would definitely come again (maybe in the mornings to avoid long lines).

I knew this place gets packed close to lunch time and I didn't want to be caught in a long line waiting to get in. So my friend and I decided to get there around 10:30am and share some oysters. It was already pretty packed in the place, but we found 2 seats right near the door at the bar so we snatched 'em up. \n\nWe ordered a dozen oysters and told them to just mix it up a bit and give us a bunch of different types. I was pretty disappointed when 2 of the oysters he gave us were super tiny (they are supposed to be like that, but we were hoping for 12 good sized oysters). It was totally fine though, we could have always ordered more if we wanted, and I understand he was just allowing us to try something we may have never had before. The guy gave us a bunch of different sauce options to try with our oysters. My favorite was the cocktail sauce. Just enough spiciness and super delicious with the oysters. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder after finishing our oysters and that was also really good. VERY buttery and creamy, and full of clams and potatoes. It was excellent. The total meal cost $40 plus tip. \n\nThe guys behind the counter were lively, enthusiastic, and you could tell they very much enjoyed what they did.

Well I have heard many times that this is the place to go for seafood.  Thats what we wanted so this is where we wanted to go. Checked Yelp and they said they were open until 5:30 pm...yea not the case apparently. So we arrived 1 1/4 hrs before closing and waited for some time but as we got closer to the front they informed us that we could only order to go....yea eating seafood outside while exhaust streams past our face seems appetizing to some but that was not what we wanted. We had plenty of time to make it in and dine I thought. I informed the manager that on Yelp it said they were open until 5:30pm. His response \"WE DONT SUPPORT YELP\" He must have been kidding...but no he wasnt. You dont support Yelp???? WOW ok??? Yelp in San Francisco is like the bible for restaurants. The end result...we left with no food and the simple idea that this guy (worker who probably makes minimum wage) decided that instead of going above and beyond for their customers put his own ego ahead. I will not be going here moving forward. Heard many great things about the restaurant but the simple fact that they don't support Yelp means that they dont really care about what their customers think. More importantly it makes no sense when they have the rating they have and the amount of reviews as well. Dont support Yelp?

Their chowder was a boston style chowder and on the watery side. I'm use to the thicker stuff so I can't say I was a fan. The oysters were fresh and super tasty, but the combination seafood salad had to to be hands down my favorite here.

I made my way here because of seafood withdrawals [I don't get much in the Desert] and because of the rating here on yelp. -- THIS.PLACE.IS.FANTASTIC.-- I had a seafood overdose for about a day where I couldn't think about the idea of consuming crab or shrimp. **just don't eat as much as I did and you should be fine. \n\n\n- Food - \n\nThis place has extremely fresh seafood. The main negative for most people is the expense. Who cares about the expense when the fish you are eating clearly just came from the water. I got the clam chowder which is a thin broth. It isn't the thick new england most of our society knows about ,however, I like this even more because it was lighter and the clam flavor was amazing. I then got a combination seafood salad with shrimp and crab. It was so simple but at the same time flavory complex. The intricate flavor combination of their louie sauce,crab, and shrimp as well as the crunchy texture of lettuce was tremendous. \n\n*****for new timers*****\n\nNext to us several people ordered some sort of sashimi platter,however, we didn't see it on the menu. We got ahi tuna,albacore, and halibut. When the halibut entered my mouth  i just japdnpfnapidhfpiuagdhfkjadbnpfiuhaidnfdnfipahdpiofnpidhf the white delicate meat melted before it even hit your taste buds. Some of the best sashimi I've ever had.\n\n- Service-\n\nThese guys are really nice and know what they have. They don't want to steer you wrong and generally feel you must have a good time at their restaurant. This place has been their for decades so it has developed a certain character present in both the service and atmosphere. I ordered the crab salad - which was great- when i received it the guy said he only had about 90% enough crab so he gave me extra prawns on top - 5 min went by and he found an extra container of freshly cracked crab and rushed over to give it to me -  apologizing for not having it before.\n\n- Atmosphere-\n\nIt has that small historic atmosphere that you can feel the moment you walk in. It's a kind of place where you know generations have grown up in and it's amazing to feel that. With that said, watch out for a wait. It's small which is great for accompanying someone that you want to talk to endlessly.\n\n**Note for people waiting** - I have been in these small places before where you have to wait on people to give up their seats. DON'T STARE you make feel uncomfortable and many will ignore your persistence and troll you on purpose. If you are waiting you can do a number of things \n\na. Stare at their fresh fish in the front - act like a kid at disneyland - OH CRAP THATS A WHOLE FISH ! \n\nb. Stare at their menu - even if decide what you want quickly - you can always pretend to not know english and develop a sense of in depth analysis on their menu - most of their menu has pictures so you can stare at the drawings to keep you occupied.\n\nc. pull out your phone - even if you don't have some stupid capitalistic app to play with - flip through your home pages - that ability might help the people with the attention span of a mouse.\n\nd. just stare at the floor - count the amount of little square tiles around your feet\n\nOtherwise the counter is really close together so you might strike up a conversation with a person you've never met before. DONT BE SCARED - as much as nancy grace tries to scare you about evil people - meet new people because I know Facebook and other social networking systems have deprived you from human interaction.", "author": "Harry G."}

Perfectly timed at 10:45am and properly dosed with Chandon splits, the Swan impressed me with its service, selection and history.\n\nA beautiful spread of fresh catch in the window greets passersby. Out of a selection of tasty oysters, my favorite was the Fanny Bay. Tart, buttery and salt-infused. Cracked crab legs yielded surprising meat finds. The Louie Sauce was delectable and tart; we found it irresistable with the sourdough. Fresh smoked salmon with capers scooped out of a massive, Costco sized jar with a fork, means good eats with a focus on quality food. The sea urchin finale was almost too much but I found out that the buttery, tangy meat inside of its spikey exterior is its gonads. Disturbing? Yes, but tasty with a little fresh lemon. \n\nThe Swan Oyster Depot is a lovely find in a world of great places to eat in San Francisco. When you notice antique photos on the walls and see those same stools supporting your backside, you wonder who else has enjoyed a similar meal in Swan.

I also ordered a cup of the clam chowder seeing as many people liked it from here. What a letdown! The clam chowder here is not good at all, unless of course you like your clam chowder extremely watery, with a ring of oil at the top and with hardly any clams.

Whoops...\nThis was the only place I cared or thought about before and during my trip to San Francisco and unfortunately the anticipation, hype, and sense of giddy was damaged by my experience here.\nRecalling on the things I got:\n\nOysters: I enjoy oysters but damn did I get some off-putting tasting ones. Every oyster I had, had an overbearing fishy taste that is delicious and fine in most oysters if it's extremely mild, but I wanted to eat something else to get rid of that awful taste. I prefer Hog Island's as of now, but I definitely want to come back here for another shot. \n\nSmoked salmon: I'm probably being picky, but this stuff needs to go on a bagel with cream cheese for me...as opposed to chewy, cold, limp sourdough bread. It was a slightly smoky, not to soft, and overall tasty smoked salmon though.\n \nCrab: Wow, I'm not sure whether I'm an idiot for thinking \"Half Cracked Crab\" meant it was a half cracked crab, meaning cracked enough to get to the meat. Nope. It actually meant HALF OF A CRAB....cracked. For 21+ dollars, that's a premium for what was some chilled precooked crab and nothing more. I also asked for the guts or crab butter which they were happy to serve me. They gave me a very generous portion that filled an entire dungeness crab, too bad it was super cold :(. \n\nClam chowder: Good, but not wow or memorable. I do remember there were not that many clams in ours and even more sad not that many potatoes. The broth was thin but it didn't matter if it was thick or thin, it tasted good.\n\nBah, sucks when you want to love a place and it doesn't deliver.

Yes, it is a wait, maybe an hour or so on a busy day.  But the staff is just amazing!  Warm and funny, personal and professional, you'd be hard pressed to find a better all around staff anywhere.  Don't sleep on the smoked salmon or the raw scallops!  I'd never tried raw scallops before--what a treat! Chowder, oysters and my all time favorite there, the crab!  Not always in season, I've been at Swan and not had the crab.  Not to worry though, it's all good there!  And there's just something inherently comforting in knowing that they'll only stock the crab when they can get it local and get it fresh!", "author": "Jayme C."}

Expect to be nudging elbows when you come here.  Also, this is not a place to bring little kids.  There's no room for your stroller and they don't have high chairs.  \n\nWe got the following: 1) clam chowder - tasted good and the broth tasted very clammy; 2) combination salad - iceberg lettuce, shrimp, prawns, dungeness crab, and your choice of either oil/vinegar or their louie sauce, the seafood tasted really fresh and the plate I would say is good enough for yourself or to share; 3) half cracked dungeness crab - tasted very fresh.\n\nMy bf and I are not oyster lovers, but we'll be back to try out more of their other foods.\n\nService is friendly and nice.

In previous years, we've waited in the line (sometimes well over an hour) to grab counter seats. This time around, we got our food to go. It still took some time to get our food, but it was much faster, and we actually had room to maneuver! We did call ahead with our order, but the gentleman who helped us made it straight in front of our eyes, so we could tell him exactly how we wanted everything.\n\nBy far, our favorites are the salads. The combination salad has generous portions of crab, shrimp and prawns. Next time around, we may go for the straight-up crab.\n\nThe oyster selection is always fresh, and you can mix and match some of your favorites. I saw some people taking oysters to go, though that seems like a slippery proposition to me! Rounding things out, you can't go wrong with the clam chowder, or the crab cocktail. \n\nSwan Oyster Depot isn't a quick or cheap lunch, but it's worthwhile, especially if you're willing to skip the dine-in line and go straight to the counter. Despite the mobs, the staff is always friendly and attentive, which we always appreciate.", "author": "Safford B."}

Each year that passes I hear more and more people talk about Swan's and my expectations steadily increases every month that passed. Those people were dead on!!. Swan oyster Depot is THE place in San Francisco to knock back a oyster or clams. The seafood is so fresh, you can taste a bit of the ocean water. \n\nAfter coming from Ike's Sandwiches and Bob's Donuts, we were ready to eat some oysters and clams on the half shell, but the only thing stopping us was a 50min line out the door. I heard this line could be as long as 2 hours, so we considered ourselves very lucky. After being seated, we ordered 6 blue point oysters, 6 clams (forgot the name), 3 Miyagi oysters and a bowl of clam chowder.\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious. The clams were much bigger than expected, so that was a high plus. The servers recommended this homemade Asian style spicy pepper sauce to go with our clams. There was some kick to the sauce to give the clam extra flavor. The clam chowder was very creamy and had a lot of clams and clam flavor. \n\nI will definitely be back to Swan Oyster Depot to try the other different oysters and seafood. This place competes with my #1 seafood place in Boston - Neptune's Oyster (review coming soon).", "author": "Marcus L."}

Got on line at 10:15AM on a Friday and was lucky enough to be part of the first seating.\n\nYou sit at a narrow bar on stools, very close to the other parties. There is a large number working behind the bar so you're helped quickly. Everyone working there is so friendly and attentive, cracking jokes and clearly having a good time--it's infectious.\n\nI had a dozen mixed oysters, a cup of chowder and a smoked fish plate with hot smoked salmon, cold smoked salmon and a shrimp salad. Everything was delicious, unpretentious, simple, just wonderful. The chowder was creamy and flavorful with plenty of clams and chunks of tender potatoes. The oysters were beautiful, the smoked fish was perfect. Great sourdough: soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Unfortunately they were out of crab, but that just means I'll have to go back sometime. I'd also like to try the raw scallops, raw sardines and smoked trout.\n\nThe place is cash only--there's a Chase ATM across the street, but it charges $3 to use it if you're not a Chase account holder. They have beer and wine, all of which is relatively inexpensive. I totally recommend it and think it's definitely worth waiting for if there is a line.", "author": "Colin S."}

I've ordered take-away a few times, but have never actually eaten there cuz it's such a zoo.  \n\nAll that changed today.  It was an odd time (3pm), I was in the area finishing an errand, and somehow got shot in the head with this crazy idea:  swans!  Go to swans it said.  Go.  it won't be a zoo.  You know you want it.  \n\nI knew it was fate when they had a half-dozen fresh whole Sea Urchins in the window.  Ever since my addiction to Uni, I have desperately longed to have them fresh, like hella fresh right from the animal, but where?  Where indeed, my friend:  Swans, that's where.  Sure enough, no line.  Seated in 5 minutes.  \n\nWe got a couple chowders (lots of butter in there I think), a dozen oysters (3 different types), and the Uni.  \n\nThe chowder was good.  Not the best I've ever had, but solid and tasty.  \n\nThe oysters were excellent, no surprises there.  Highly, highly recommend with the house-made hot sauce.  \n\nAnd then... the pointy prickly star of the show...  cracked right there for me Uni (delivered that day from Monterey)!  First surprise was how much Uni is in there! There were about 6-7 Nigiri sized pieces.  Second related surprise was that Sea Urchin is big, the inside alone is the size of a medium sized bowl.  Taste?  Not quite what I was expecting, but delicious.  Def. Uni, but with something different, something a bit smokey or musky that I hadn't tasted in sushi uni before.  But still that same fresh burst of the sea and indescribable texture  that I associate with the very best uni.   I had a bit of soy sauce and horseradish on the side which made a tasty quick dip.  And at $16, not a bad deal at all for that much Uni (one order of 2 nigiri runs what, 6-8$?)\n\nI was chatting with Jimmy afterward (everyone that works there is so nice and knowledgeable), and he informed me that much of the Uni from Japan comes from...  California!  That is so wrong on so many levels.  But he also said that the way they prepare them in Japan is to rinse them in detergent (?!?!).  Of course they don't do that at Swans, and he said their fresh Uni is popular with some of SF's sushi chefs for that reason.  I mean, they come to Swans to chow down.  \n\nFull bill for a glass of wine, uni, 2 cups chowder, dozen oysters, and 1/3lb of smoked salmon was about $70.  Not cheap but for the quality of the food, atmosphere, history, and quality of service I think it's well worth it.\n\nSwans is def. a San Francisco institution.", "author": "Goolie G."}

Seemingly every time I've walked past this place there's been a line. That's got to be well over a hundred times by this point. Part of that I think is that there isn't a lot of seating--just a counter--but the other part is that the place is good.\n\nThey've been around for about 100 years with much of the furnishings being from around that time as well. Not many places can say they've been around that long, especially in this city. Once upon a time, they used to own their own boats and fish themselves. They're a knowledgeable and nice crew with many of them doing this for a very long time. They have regulars with whom they've got a great rapport. Family business? I don't recall, but I wouldn't be surprised. \n\nThat's fine and all, but what about the food? I wasn't sure what to get the first time I went. The guy helping me insisted on a mixed half-dozen oysters, bowl of clam chowder, and seafood cocktail. All good suggestions. I love that they've got olive oil out on the counter--I like putting it on oysters rather than hot sauce. I've also gotten the crab Louis on another occasion. It's a healthy portion of crab and filling when paired with their bread and butter and a beer.\n\nNB: bring a gangster wad of cash! They don't take cards. I sat next to a group of tourists that kept ordering rounds of oysters. They were eating before I got there and still there after I left. They must have spent several hundred dollars and most people don't carry around that kind of cash. There are three major banks within two blocks you can hit up on your way there, but I just wish they would take cards and make things easier for their guests. I also wish their menu was posted on their website.\n\nDon't feel like waiting? Skip the line and get your food to go.", "author": "Diana O."}

Being from NYC I gave him the stink eye and asked what he meant, and he said well you dont want to drip on your pretty bag...I pondered this for a moment and then asked where would it go and he said well on top of that stack of paper plates behind me...I gave one more attempt at not giving up my purse by saying what if I forget? And he just smirked and said I doubt you will, so I reluctantly gave the bag up with the consolation that I saw it in plain view. \n\nTwo ladies came and sat down next to me and had the same experience so I didnt feel as bad....anyways on to the food. \n\nAfter my 6 hour flight with only some pretzels in me I was starving and ordered way more than I needed but everything looked so fresh! I got a half dozen blue point oysters and half dozen west coast little neck clams. They were both great but I liked the clams better since they were smaller and there is only so much raw gelatinous mollusk I can handle. \n\nAfter that the ladies next to me were eating the clam chowder so I had to try a cup of that, it was quite watery for a chowder but it was very flavorful and went great with the oyster crackers they leave in front of you. \n\nAnother lady came and sat next to me and got the crab cocktail, I had food envy so I had to order the mixed seafood cocktail...it was pretty good. You got a nice variety including crab meat, small shrimps, prawns and an oyster if I remember correctly. At that point I was pretty stuffed but that probably was in part due to the 2 pints of Anchorsteam I had, I am a fan! \n\nAfter all of that my bill only came up to about $43 which wasnt bad considering how fresh everything was and how great and attentive the service was as well (and it wasn't just the ladies they were as great with the guys). \n\nYou can't leave without getting their souvenir magic sponge, I also got a free shot of tequila for the road and some great tips from a chatty cabby that came and sat next to me who ordered a little great looking shrimp salad (at that point I was way to full to even attempt to order anything else but it looked really really good) and CASH only as one of the guys said behind the counter it keeps things simpler.", "author": "Angela M."}

The three of us waited in line as it's a pretty small place (just one long bar). There was one lone guy behind us so when two seats opened up, instead of finding a 3rd bar stool (which is what they use), they gave it to the guy behind us so we waited even longer. \n\nThree of our other friends were meeting us there right after we eat but got there before we were seated. One of the guys working behind the bar saw us talking to them and yelled, \"we're not serving them!\" to his coworker, in front of EVERYONE. First of all, we told them it was only for three, secondly, they could have politely told us they were closing soon and re-confirmed our seat number, or thirdly, they could have just asked if our friends were planning to eat or not. But nope, the hot-headed young man (who I later learned wasn't even part of the family who owns the place, but just a friend of the nephew) felt like being an ass. I seriously didn't even care whether we ate there or not. It's not like they grow their own seafood that it's so special you can't get anything like it at another nice seafood bar.\n\nAnyway, I was put off by the young man's attitude so I wanted to leave, but my two friends wanted to stay, so when we were finally seated, I asked the young man what's the hurry, and he self-importantly told me that they were closing up soon because they were going to the Beer fest right after. Well, isn't he special? We were feeling a little hurried so we got a plate of oysters and it was pretty good, not that it was any better than some of the other oyster bars I've been too.

Bar seating can get a little cramped and messy, so don't come to this oyster joint thinking fine dining.  The workers there are really nice and extremely knowledgeable about seafood.\n\nThe environment will conflict with the food you taste.  These are high-end oysters you're putting in your mouth.  I got the twelve-oyster sampler, which featured portions of Kumamoto, Blue Point, and Miyagi oysters.  My favorite of the three was the clean taste of the Blue Point oyster.  The types of oysters they carry rotate, but I imagine that all the oysters they have are awesome quality.\n\nThe oysters also come with an optional mignonette sauce.  I recommend putting very little, or none at all.  It's a little invasively strong in the vinegar department.  Some people also like to put some lemon on their oysters.

Everytime I drove past it, there would be a very long line outside. The look of the place intrigued me. It's basically a long narrow room with a bar and 12-15 stools and the food they served was sitting on ice near the front window. The atmosphere of this place made me feel like I was at the fish counter at a supermarket. \n\nWe waited in line for 35 minutes. When we made it inside, we sat down at the next available stool. It was cramped and I was rubbing elbows with a strange man sitting to my right. So I thought...maybe the food is that good that the atmosphere wouldn't matter. I was disappointed. \n\nWe had a bowl of Boston Clam Chowder and a dozen oysters. 4 different kinds: Blue Point, Miyagi, Kumamoto, Olympia. Btw...Kumamoto oysters are the best. They're really small, but they pack lots of flavor. The clam chowder was really fresh. The oysters were good, but I feel that I can get them anywhere else without having to wait in a line outside and without having to sit in a cramped, cold room.  In the end, The bill came out to $29. Their seafood cocktails come out in small cup and were $13-$19 each, so I didn't feel like it was worth the price. \n\nThis place is good for freshness.

Mind you, this came along with a 1.5-hour wait (relatively quick, I was told) --Swan's is a narrow alley of 20 seats by the counter, though you can just skip the line and do take-out. But then you'll be missing half the fun: the interesting patrons, the frequent cheers of \"Go Giants\" from staff to customers and vice versa, the live shucking and deshelling of all the fresh, fresh seafood. \n\nI came by myself but never felt alone. Throughout my wait I had the companionship of a lovely, chatty couple from New Jersey, and during my lunch I spoke to Fred, who's a regular of the restaurant (he even let me try a bit of his crab cocktail which spurred me to order my own). I even saw the staffers bantering with the other customers, so I doubt you'll ever feel lonely there.\n\nNow onto the food, which is mindblowingly good. I actually came for the clam chowder, which while decent, pales in comparison to its raw bar. In a way, I'm glad I came alone, so no one could judge this 5\"1 girl for eating half her body weight in seafood. I started off with a bowl of clam chowder for $5(skippable), and an octopus calamari cocktail ($9 - not bad). But then I ordered the half-dozen mixed oysters ($14) and my oh my. It was like I was transported to heaven: the Blue Points were GREAT, as was another East Coast oyster... The salty, briny taste of the Washington ones wasn't my favorite but even then, I loved the texture. I was so tempted to order more oysters until Fred let me try some of his crab cocktail... And then I was sold. \n\nThe cocktails are small (I think it's just enough for one person) but you'll have the most value for money getting the crab cocktail ($14.95). It comes with a dipping sauce (I added Tobasco and lemon to mine to make it more zesty) but the crab meat is succulent and juicy on its own, not in the least bit dry. The flesh is thick and generous and by the time I was done, I was STUFFED.\n\nOf course the boyfriend couldn't miss out on this solo adventure completely, so I bought him a combination cocktail ($12) which comes with some crab, oysters, octopus, a bit of everything really... The staff who helped me was super knowledgeable and friendly which makes this place accessible for seafood newbies and aficionados alike. Well worth the wait! :)", "author": "Rachel A."}

I understand that it might not always get 5 stars because of the wait but the experience makes up for it. We went on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. We waited about 15 mins. which was fine with me because we were aware that there would probably be a wait.\n\n Anyway, as soon as we sat down (and there are only about 15-20 stools along the bar to sit in which I think makes for a more intimate lunch!) we were approached by an older gentleman who obviously wanted us to have the best possible lunch we could! He brought us water, beer, and bread immediately. We both started with the double combo of the seafood salads, etc. The crab salad was highly recommended and thankfully we ordered that first because unfortunately they ran out for the rest of the week! We then got a mixed plate of oysters (which were bomb!) and then finished with a sashimi plate that was to die for! Best seafood I've had in a long time.\n\nAside from the lunch itself, the service was phenomenal. The guys know there's a line around the building (in some cases, mostly weekends we've heard) but their focus is on the people seated right in front of them. They don't rush you to finish your meal and each guy serves you-there's no \"well, I'm not your server so I can't help you!\" There's obviously local San Franciscan's that visit on the regular and there's definitely a sense of family and long-time friendship evident here.

We waited about 45 minutes on a Thursday afternoon, but it was worth every second. We sat down and ordered 2 cups of chowder right off the bat. It was a little thinner than I like, but at $2.75 for a cup, you can't beat it. Add the $1 bread basket for mopping up the extra chowder, and the crab back that you should order next. I've never had crab back, and I enjoyed it, and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. It was a delicious little addition to our meal. After finishing our Anchor Steams, my boyfriend ordered the Swan Special which is a Bud Light and a shrimp cocktail for $13. Great deal and delicous cocktail. The true star of the show was the Italian Sashimi plate. We got the medium and it included scallops, halibut, hamachi, salmon and tuna covered in a lemon-olive oil drizzle with capers.

For just about 7 dollars, I sopped up and spread all that medula obla crabba on some nice crusty sourdough. I highly recommend, if you want to try something different. \n\nGiven I was by myself, I only finished my day off with a Anchor Stream draft and a tray of 6 Blue Bay Oysters on the half shell.

I have lived in the area since 1998 and always put off going because of the wait.  However, hour long wait on Saturday at lunchtime was worth it!  The place smells amazing when you walk in.  The old school vibe is so great.  We shared some clam chowder, a mixed dozen oysters and some bread.  The clam chowder is outstanding.  Heavy on clam flavor, not thick with flour.  The oysters (six kinds) were absolutely top notch.  The bread was perfect local sourdough: thick crust on the outside and soft crumb on the inside.  Pints of beer on tap are $4 all the time.  That is like happy hour pricing everywhere else.  The staff is outstanding.  I cannot think of anything that would have improved our visit.  We loved it.", "author": "Amber B."}

After our first stop to Hooker's Sweet Treats (ok, I guess second stop, if you count coffee at farm:table), we decided it made more sense time-wise and location-wise to go to Swan Oyster Depot.  This was purely for my enjoyment because hubs doesn't eat oysters.  At first, I hesitated because it was only 10:15am and honestly, I would be embarrassed if I was their first customer... the pig that eats oysters in the morning.  I decided to own up to it and just go.  We got there at 10:30am and the place was packed!  We took the last two seats at the bar and soon thereafter, a line started forming outside of the place.  They gave us bread which was super soft and chewy- the best kind of them all!  I ordered a dozen of the mixed oysters, crab cocktail, 6 mixed clams on a half shell and hubs ordered a cup of clam chowder.  The oysters were so cold, fresh and delicious.  Some sweet, some briny.  HEAVEN!  The clams were a little weird for me because they were so meaty and raw.  The only other time I had clams on a half shell, they were tiny.  The crab cocktail was also very fresh and soooo good!  I love that they do all the cracking for you and you can just enjoy the meat.  YUM.  The clam chowder was also very good.  Not as thick and creamy as your typical clam chowder but it was oh so flavorful!  Right before we were finished, I noticed that someone had ordered sea urchin (my FAVE).  I ordered it and they said it was the last one!  Boo.\n\nThe place is very casual with a bunch of manly men working behind the counter.  They didn't hesitate to refer to us as \"that Asian couple\" to each other out loud.  They're very straight forward but also very friendly and informative about their menu at the same time.  \n\nWish we had one of these in Orange County.

Because I'm a very judgmental person I have a habit of immediately loving or being disappointed by restaurants, this was true love and remained so to the finish.  I have another habit of wanting to pre or post date experiences I'm having, like when I take the BART from the airport I think to myself, \"This is what living the future must be like\", or when I pay with exact change, I imagine it's the 1930's and I had to scrounge it out of my coffee can from under the creaky floorboard in the pantry.  Judgmental people are usually highly dramatic as well.\n\nAs you can imagine Swan makes this all too easy for me, because it really is from another era.  From the old marble counters, to the old refrigeration system, to the \"watcha like dollface\" service style from the guys behind the counter and the array of classic seafood condiments, it truly is a blast from the past.  Part of this historical accuracy knocks them down one star; the half hazard and dubious sanitation of shared bowls of oyster crackers, and some of the fish flopping out onto the counter from behind its glass partition was a little worrisome, but no matter, people were heartier back then, no?  I'll just assume that imaginative time travel protects you from communicable disease.\n\nI was here on a Monday, when it was still crowded, but nothing like some of the Saturday lines I've seen waiting.  It's hard to know if anything is worth the lines I've seen coming out of this place, but if your life depends on a fresh, varied menu of seafood items prepared in the super classic manner, then that line is but a drop in the bucket of time.  Since my love of seafood is not life threatening, I'll stick to the off hours.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

Then the people in line started yelling at us, like we did something wrong, and told us to leave!!!!! \nIt was the worst experience I have ever had in a food service place where customer service should be important. I guess the place is so hyped up, they don't need more ppl to come.\nFourth, the place is so small, and there is no tables, it's a bar kind of setting prolly fits around 15 ppl, and the floor is wet.

They get some things with the season so you may be able to get something special every now and then.  Its great to see that the fame hasn't affected the atmosphere or the quality of their offerings.

Everywhere I can find it, I try it.  I am a San Francisco resident and so that is one of my treats for myself: finding great chowders in San Francisco and everywhere I travel.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 (on San Francisco standards), I would rank the clam chowder a 3.  I've had a few worse chowders in San Francisco: maybe two that I can think of.  The chowder reminded me of when I was a kid and I use to make Campbell's New England Clam Chowder where you add milk to the stuff that comes out of the can: it was watery.  For San Francisco standards, I can think of so many places in San Francisco with much better chowder that I'm not even going to start listing the massive list here.  Boudin's is even better and that in opinion is the lowest standard for chowder that I will eat.\n\nAs for the shrimp salad, it didn't look that impressive for the price.   I'm not an oyster person. \n\nFor seating, everyone sits at a packed counter that was completely uncomfortable: there are no tables.  Think of commuting on a packed subway train (BART) at rush hour where everyone is so packed together that you just can't wait to get off the train; that is what it felt like to sit at the counter and eat my bowl of chowder.\n\nI would not visit this place again for any reason, there are just way too many better places to eat in San Francisco, and way too many better chowders.\n\nAs for the Yelp review about eating the dungeness crab brains (the visitor from Texas).  That yellowish stuff is the crab's liver and it can be potentially harmful for you.  I would not recommend eating the crab butter (which is the polite name for that stuff).

Come here! \n\nThere's a couple of places you want to establish a good relationship with the purveyor of whatever it is. Your barber shop is one place, a butcher shop, your sushi chef and a Swan Oyster depot guy.

It's worth the wait and once inside you'll see that it's a pretty tight space between you, the counter and the person getting your crab ready.. and you have to get the crab here. Their sourced fairly locally and there's nothing better than food that was breathing just a short time before it hit your plate. \n\nAnd while there's many places to get good oysters in S.F., I don't think you could beat the setting that this place provides. It's just your average joe on the other side readying your food.

Oh my, the Dungeness crab is the staple here and they do it right. Giving you that shell with the juices just flowing in it. That is amazing to eat. \n\nShrimp cocktails were pretty good, I guess I could go either way with them. I did really enjoy the clam chowder here. That was a treat. Who said you have to be from New England to make a really good clam chowder? Well, from the accents I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of these folks working were East coast transplants.

They pile on so much shrimp and crab! Can I get a side of salad with that shrimp and crab? Haha\n\nThe Oyster Sampler was deeeeelicious! They were so fresh and not fishy at all. We even asked for a different mixture of sauces and the server was very accommodating. He even made our sauce in front of us.\n\nThe Clam Chowder was pretty good too. I had wish it was a little thicker, but it was still delicious!\n\nThe place is small and all the seatings are at the long table so it feels personal. If you love seafood, its definitely worth the wait. :)", "author": "Jean T."}

It has always been a little edgy in the cleanliness department but we have previously been able to \"live\" with it.\n\nThe last time was, I'm afraid, beyond our tolerances. This is a real shame because the food, as always, was excellent and the staff their usual friendly selves and quite entertaining. \n\nThe glass refrigerated cabinets on the counter in front of us have actual black mold growing in the corners now! I won't mention the floos in the kitchen which one has to pass through to get to the facilities, both of which need attention.\n\nWe're not prudish about hole in the wall eateries but come on guys! Get some bleach in there on a more regular basis. We know you work hard and that the work must be a joy to get away from at the end of the day but Swans pulls in a sizable revenue.

The salad was just heaven- super fresh, sweet crab meat, lots of bay shrimp, and a handful of prawns, over a heaping bed of finely sliced iceberg lettuce.  That Louie sauce was simple, creamy goodness.  The oysters we had included a couple of my favorite, Kumamoto, some yummy Miyagi's, and sveral others.  I loved that the counter is covered with all the condiments and accoutrements you could want for your various seafoods: rice wine mignonette, jalapeno-serrano sauce, horseradish, lemon wedges, Tabasco, oyster crackers, and a big hunk of sourdough bread (yes!).  They serve the cocktail sauce to you individually, in pretty little bowls.  Get the oysters and experiment with different combinations of toppings like I did, then slurp away!  Service was excellent, as the main guy taking care of us checked in frequently, and they all moved with amazing efficiency in such a tiny space.  We were quite full by the end, but I felt I had to try some of the clam chowder so I got a cup to go (the guy was nice enough to throw in another huge chunk of bread plus a couple bags of oyster crackers).

How'd you sucker my wife and I into this dump not to mention standing in a line for about 46 minutes? We had oysters and chowder and beer and paid dearly, cash only, for what we both agree was nothing special whatsoever. I'd like to note that the bowls of oyster crackers were quite stale from sitting out I guess and the dishes of sliced lemon looked like they needed some serious refrigeration to recover from wilting. We could have had equal if not better seafood most places in San Francisco, no question, but due to our following Tony Bourdain and his interesting CNN shows we trusted him on this place. I don't enjoy being critical of restaurants and workers because of how hard they work, but this place is pretty bad on food quality ( it is fresh ) and being clean. Hands on the seafood some of which is displayed in the front window, and then hands on the cash and on and on. Not a reassuring feeling for the health conscious. We sampled some of the other dishes from our adjacent diners. Very mediocre, indeed. Also, no credit cards here. All cash in those hands of the waiters behind the counter, that then dip into the salad shrimp and scallops and mix greens without washing those hands in between. Geez Louise, how many of us Americans are this nuts to keep a line outside to get in? As for the cocktail sauce? What? You mean ketchup with a dash of lemon added? Yeap. Pretty bad stuff but at least its red. Won't be doing the Swan Oyster Depot ever again and won't trust Tony nearly as much anymore. He's sold out somewhere along the line, and from looking back on the hundreds of places he's been in on his TV Show I now see what's going on .... third world conditions that in his mind are perfectly fine. Except this is the United States, I hope. I have no interest in third world cleanliness standards although the food might be just fine. Lastly, the staff was very knowledgeable and polite and patient and did a good job, but the beat up marble counter and the beaten up bar stools without backs (they look like CocaCola chairs without backs) to lean back against and all the walls covered with menu signs and pictures need a restructure of the highest order. Fisherman's Wharf offers any number of places that top Swan in each category as does the rest of this great city in my humble opinion. Of the entire week of vacation this place was our one disappointment and we wish it hadn't been as we looked so forward to going there. But as usual, lessons get learned the hard way. Long lines, expensive prices, food quality less than anticipated, but a good staff  with big hearts and energy who like to please.", "author": "Frank S."}

Probably not worth ALL the hype...but worth at least a good amount. \n\nWe ordered the combination salad, clam chowder, and a dozen mixed oysters. \n\nA great experience and a nice place to learn about oysters. I still have a long way to go, but they helped me understand that I have a preference for more delicate oysters. The more you know!\n\nAwesome clam chowder. Really pure and clean...not thick with artificial white goop. You won't regret getting a bowl of it. \n\nBecause of its price...it would be more of a \"special occasion\" lunch for me. (100 bucks for 2...and I cant really think of a way to have a filling lunch without spending at least 25 bucks a head). But you can't expect to be charged much less than that for quality seafood right? I would go back...but not TOO often.", "author": "Rondeep C."}

I loved the ambience: a small, cramped counter with an almost 1:1 ratio of servers to customers. My friend and I shared a half-shell of oysters (two kumamotos, two miyagis, and 2 blue points), a couple cups of clam chowder, and a crab louie salad. The clam chowder was a little thinner than I'd like it, but it was packed with flavor nonetheless. It was served at just the right temperature for consumption.\n\nThe oysters were excellent, though if you don't like oysters, this won't change your mind. They are fresh and you can tell they were recently caught. My friend, whose tongue isn't quite so discerning with seafood, couldn't tell the difference between the three varieties of oyster. The kumamotos were definitely the smallest and they had the creamiest (but weakest) taste, while the miyagi and blue point oysters were a bit stronger and definitely larger.\n\nThe crab louie, however, was definitely the highlight of meal. The crab is fresh and there's a lot of it. The louie dressing is absolutely to die for, like thousand island but better. Enough said. Just get it.", "author": "Brian L."}

Finally made it to San Fran for a business trip and had some time before my flight.  \n?  Ok been here and done it.  Waited for about an hour to get in - what is the hype about this place???  I have no idea.  Maybe coming from NYC I've had the same and better than Swan?   I have to say that I didn't try too many things on the menu as I was alone and just had In n Out Burger for lunch., but I thought I just had to try Swan since I was in the area.  I didn't want to order anything raw or any salads and I'll tell you why in a minute.  So I had the clam chowder which was too watery for me with not much substance and the overpriced cold half crab which was no big deal.  I could have had a whole crab at the wharf for the same price.  I went into the restaurant with the intention of trying the sashimi platters as the photos from fellow yelpers posted looked so good.  However, the place does not look clean at all.  I know the place has been around for a long time but I still feel that you should maintain the cleanliness of where the raw seafood is sitting.  I saw the already cut up pieces of fish and didn't think I wanted to eat raw fish or shellfish from here before my 5 1/2 hr flight.  You can get the same type of seafood from a reputable restaurant or sushi bar.  But If you have to dine like a tv show chef, wait 45 mins to an hour on line, sit on an old  metal bar stool and pay for overpriced seafood then this is a must visit when you are in San Fran.  Oh the worse part of it was that the servers DO NOT where gloves when they are getting the food.  If you order say a shrimp, crab or mixed seafood salad,  they just grab your salad, the crabmeat, the shrimp, etc. with there bare hands and put it on the plate.  I saw this one server that blew his nose with a tissue, looked into and wash his hands WITHOUT any soap!  That totally disgusted me\nI know am going against the grain on this.

Low-top sneakers.  Standard-to-loose fitting jeans.  Standing arcade games.  Sitting at a counter to eat.  That sort of thing.  Swan Oyster Depot (\"SOD\") rocks it old school.

That's says plenty about the integrity of the place and the quality of its offerings.  \n\nSOD is a fairly small - a narrow counter that can accomodate about a dozen or so people.  It's a no-nonsense type of place.  No fancy-pants, foo-foo (sp?) drinks.  Cold beers (wine, too, if memory serves) and fresh seafood.  If you like seafood - real, fresh seafood (including raw bar) - this is THE place to be.  The only other place I've been in recent years that holds a candle to this place is Santa Monica Seafood (see previous review).  Menu is simple and straight-forward.  Ask for a recommendation, you get it.  Food comes shortly thereafter.  Done.\n\nTo borrow from Lu T.'s review, this place offers up \"a cornucopia of the sea\" - soups/chowders, salads (like Louies), raw bar, sashimi...the list goes on and on.

This ain't eggs and hash.\n\nThere are 3 places in the city I know of that serve an excellent New England clam chowder.  Swan's, Anchor in the Castro, and Woodhouse Fish Co. on Market.  Good chowder tastes of cream and clams, not flour.  It is not important or desirable to be able to stand up your spoon in it.  It's silky texture derives from more slow cooking and less flour.  As a native east-coaster, I feel these 3 places get that and serve a great chowder.  Swan's seems the very freshest and creamiest.\n\nThere's also something to be said for the seafood cocktails and salads.  If you are inexperienced with fresh, perfectly prepared seafood, you might be conditioned to expect less when you order a shrimp cocktail or a seafood salad.  The seafood is generally prepared in advance , shredded, or whatever, and held in a walk-in.  Not here.  The seafood in your cocktail or salad is every bit as fresh your just shucked oyster.  \n\nCheck this place out, if you haven't already, and stand in line if you have to.  \n\nIt's family owned, and they believe in a tradition that understands quality and service might lead to profit.

If you want good oysters at $1 a pop, go to the happy hour at Hyde Street Seafood House and Raw Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyde-street-seafood-house-and-raw-bar-san-francisco), but if you can afford to shell out more for unforgettable oysters, go to Swan.\n\nThe combination salad is also worth mentioning. At $17.25, it's a bit pricey but panty-dropping good. Plus, the guys give so much crabmeat, shrimp, and prawns, you can't even see the lettuce or understand why it's called a salad. I love the crab louie dressing and smother my salad with it. Oh yeeaaahhhh. \n\nI can't say that I'm a big fan of the clam chowder or the smoked salmon. The chowder is watery and not as flavorful as the chowdah I was spoiled with each week in Boston for many years. The salmon is just too fatty that it overshadows the fish taste. Thanks to the guy that gave me free sample of the salmon, though, because I was staring it to death. Haha.\n\nI've been here five times in the last nine months, and I would come here even more often if my bank account could withstand the beating. I'm hooked!", "author": "Liz T."}

He thought I would love the atmosphere and the style of the place and he was right. We arrived just before noon on a Friday and waited about 45 minutes to sit down. By the time you get to your seat you've had plenty of time to watch the guys assemble several items on the menu from the front window and the whole menu is up on a huge wall, so there is really no reason you shouldn't know what you want by the time you get seated, except everything looks great. So we took a couple of suggestions by the fella waiting on us with regards to which oysters to order and lunch. \n\nWe had the clam chowder, a mixed array of oysters, a mixed salad (crab and two types of shrimp) and a half a cracked crab, which I washed down with two cold Stellas. If I could have eaten one more bite I would have gone for the octopus salad, maybe I will have that next time (there will be a next time). Our tab after all of this was about $80 before the tip. The guys next to me had a bill of $200 for two, but from the looks of their (handwritten on a napkin) check, they each had one of everything on the menu. The couple on the other side of me had a couple chowders, six oysters, one beer and a salad and they were out for around $40 before tip. \n\nThe guys do handle everything with their bare hands, but there was also a sink right behind the counter I saw most of them use at least once during my hour long visit. This place has been around for nearly 100 years, and I'm guessing if people had died from eating there it wouldn't have made it through the sue-happy 80's and 90's. If you want to feel like you've had a relaxing lunch at these prices, you'd best find somewhere else to eat. It was expensive, there was a long wait, and it was the most uncomfortable seating I've experienced, but it was all worth it.", "author": "Heather D."}

I'm sure a lot of the diners are out-of-towners, like myself, but Swan felt like a joint for locals.\n\nWe walked straight in at about 3:00 in the afternoon (perhaps the unpopular dining hour we chose affected our experience) and there were two seats at the counter waiting for us.  There are no tables at swan, just a long lunch counter with stools and communal bowls of oyster crackers, lemons, horseradish, etc.  I think I counted around 6 staff members behind the counter.  Several were using the afternoon lull to prep, but most helping/chatting with customers.\n\nWe came for oysters.  It was our last day in San Francisco, and I had yet to have a single oyster...despite beginning to dream about them on the flight in five days earlier.  We thought we might try something else, but we were there almost exclusively for oysters and perhaps another small item, as we had a dinner at 6:00.\n\nThe young man behind the counter was fantastic.  He saw our eyes goggle at the menu board on the wall (no menus), and correctly guessed that this was our first time.  He was prepared to walk us through our experience, and modified his plans when he learned that we were only snacking.  He started up with a combination oyster tray (2 each of 6 different oysters), named and indicated the area of origin for each, and let us find out what we liked.  It was amazing.  Very fresh, and each oyster was unexpectedly unique, often in appearance as well as flavor.\n\nI requested some crab gut and bread to dip, which he gathered and brought gladly, only infomring me as we were settling up that he wasn't charging us for it as they were going to throw it away anyhow.  I wish it had been heated, but I won't complain about free crab butter.\n\nI'm not from San Francisco, and I didn't eat seafood anywhere else in the city.  As a result, I can't really compare Swan's prices to anyone else.  From a tourist's point of view, it seemed expensive, though worth it.  Get some cash out (I didn't see a credit card terminal -- however there is an ATM just across the street), and give it a shot.  I doubt it will disappoint.", "author": "Matt M."}

The people who work here are all super friendly and attentive. The seafood  is extraordinarily fresh, that's for sure! I'm not the biggest seafood fan which is probably why I didn't like the food as much. Maybe I had expected too much because to me it wasn't really worth the price. I had the clam chowder, which was okay, and the seafood salad, not so great. It was just a soggy bed of iceberg lettuce with puny shrimp and a bit of crab meat on it with Louie dressing. The portion was pretty small for $20. My boyfriend had the clam chowder as well as some blue point oysters.

Everything about it said to me, \"You want to be a regular!\" Lesla (my g-friend) had been there many times, going way back, and she filled me in on the family history associated with Swan's.\n\nThe place has that unique feel to it, of a family-run spot: that usually engenders two basic realities: pride in the fare, and rapport with the clientele. They came up aces on both counts, and the seafood was divinely fresh.\n\nI haven't read the other reviews here, but I imagine that everyone who has tasted the clam chowder almost certainly agrees that it is the absolute best available anywhere. The funny thing is: almost all places use the same basic ingredients, so how do these people manage to transcend the quality level of all the others?\n\nWell, that beats me. Lesla suggested they probably add some fresh clam juice to the mix, but could that be the sole cause? I don't know. But then, I also don't care, because the result is almost unimaginatively perfect.\n\nI had a cup of the chowder, followed by a Combination Louie salad. The salad, consisting of fresh iceberg lettuce as a bed for \"caught-today\"-fresh seafood was delightful. A little spray of lemon, and it was good-to-go.\n\nLesla had the chowder, also, ( a bowl, though ... smart) and a crab cocktail. I tried her cocktail and it was on par with everything else, including the fresh bread and butter we had on the side.\n\nThe servers delivered a few beers and wines to others waiting in line, and although I mentioned \"don't know\" or \"No\" in the \"Wheelchair Accessible\" area, I'd bet anything that if you were in line in a wheelchair that they would bring you any, and every, thing you desired, without hesitation.

The broth and the cream separated so it didn't seem very appetizing, but it tasted fine.  It had a good seafood flavor but it didn't have a lot of actual seafood in the soup.  If you don't want to spend $60+ just to feel full, the bread and chowder would be a good filler.\n\nSashimi plate: This was pretty good.  You get a nice sample of various kinds of fish (unfortunately my mackerel had bones in it).  Second best thing I ate here.\n\nUni: I was pretty disappointed.  I've had uni before and it's usually sweet, buttery and salty like the sea.  The uni here was served fresh but mine was incredibly bitter.  I tried my friend's uni and hers was slightly less bitter but neither of us really enjoyed it. \nQuick tip: I learned afterwards that adding lemon can help with the bitterness.\n\nOysters: my favorite part of the meal.  The kumamoto oysters were my favorite out of the 6 varieties they had.   \n\nI know this place is renown for their freshness, but I honestly couldn't tell based on the food that I ate.

For e.g., $10 for half dozen clams is usually the price in upscale restaurant at Boston.  As for the oysters, on average is $2+ each, almost typical restaurant price.  We tried the platter, got a lot of miyagi, new Zealand etc....

No special flavoring and I can get the same crab elsewhere for cheaper than 17.95 WITH the crab shell and not just the legs only.\n\nminus 1 star was not taking cash and not giving us a total of how much everything cost but that's ok because asian people can calculate in their heads I guess (i kid)\n\nOverall, I would go back just for the fresh oysters IF I was in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kelly C."}

Looked over our backs 3 minutes later, a line was already forming...\n\nMy mom (visiting from Tokyo) got the combination salad, me and my friend (also visiting from Tokyo) each got a cup of chowder, the combination cocktail, and a beer.  I got mine with only crab and prawns because I don't really like clams, oysters, or the little shrimp.  I'm a pretty picky eater, especially with seafood.\n\nWhen my friends combination cocktail came, the oyster that was on top fell off onto the table.  We both looked at each other, and I flagged the guy helping us over.  I pointed at the oyster, and he said, \"Oh!!!\" and proceeded to pick up the oyster from the table with his bare hands and plopped it right back on top as if it was the most natural thing to do in the world...\n\nONLY at Swan's do germophobes forget that germs actually exist.\n\nAs for us, we couldn't stop laughing.  Then continued eating our food as if nothing strange had just happened.\n\nI live a couple blocks from this place, so I'll hop in when I'm walking by and there's no line and I'm lucky enough to have nowhere else to go.  My perfect meal here is the cup of chowder, crab and prawn cocktail, and beer.  I've had the combination salad a couple of times, but it's usually too much for me, and I'm not the biggest fan of the dressing.  The bread they serve there is really yummy and goes so well with the clam chowder.  The prawns are plump and juicy, and the crab, which they are very generous with, is really sweet and tasty.  I can understand why people would say the clam chowder is too watery, but I personally like it like that; more broth to dip my yummy bread in.  \n\nThis is the kind of place, especially after reading all the rave reviews about the oysters, that makes me wish I was a little more adventurous with my seafood...", "author": "Jennifer H."}

It's a bit different here, not as thick as other places, more on the watery side, but the delicate flavors of the sea are crammed into each spoonful.\n\nI highly recommend the Combination Salad, which is a cold bed of lettuce topped with chunks of crab meat, heavy amounts of shrimp, and finished with gigantic prawns. I ask for the dressing on the side, so I can truly enjoy the pieces on the salad.\n\nThe dressing is phenomenal though. Curb that diet, because this delightful thousand island dressing will make you earn it on the treadmill.\n\nObviously, if you're here, you must try the Oysters. We ordered a dozen blue point, and they will disappear faster than the line outside. You have your choice of horseradish, cocktail sauce and their home made dressing. All of which will only add to your love of your dozen.\n\nSwans is a tiny venue, with only 12 stools, but what truly makes this place unique are the servers. We had the pleasure of having Michael work with us, and he was top notch. Warm, funny, and allowed us to maneuver through our meal with ease.\n\nMichael embodies why Swan's has been around so long. Fantastic service, that has SF values at it's core.

And Swan's is one of those places--whoever said it was a \"tourist trap\" or \"over-hyped\" obviously got stuck in line too long (we had no problem at 11:00 on a weekday).  So come in, hang your coat on the wall, grab a stool at the counter, and prepare to receive the sea's bounty.\n\nNow normally I don't find oysters to be worth the sticker shock, but fortunately I was going on the company's dime so I was able to just focus on deciding what deliciousness I wanted to sample.  Even then, as a relative novice I found the disjointed menu on the wall a bit overwhelming.  Fortunately, the guys who work the bar are consummate masters of dishing out sage (and friendly) advice.  In the end I got to try 2 kinds of oyster (dipped in horseradish, vinegar, and cocktail sauce), a cup of clam chowder, and a plate of smoked trout and salmon with bread and butter.

The oysters were fresh but poorly shucked - we both found ourselves biting on shards of shell more than once. That was most disappointing, considering that's something they do a lot and what people come for.

Tormenting passer by-ers with a tantalizing display of mouthwatering buckets of fresh, vibrantly-colored seafood - I was left defenseless to this seafood lover's utopia. Yes, even after having brunch, a tall cup of coffee, and indulging in a mid-day dessert from a few blocks down the street - I still stopped in my tracks. I should have kept treading up the hill, walking off my satiation -  but there's always a bit of room left for fresh oysters and clam chowder for any seafood lover, right? It was nearing lunch time, so I made my excuse and sneaked in line for a quick bite. Don't judge! I mean, you really can't call yourself a real seafood lover, and not enjoy the freshest of seafood, sent straight from the Wharf by the San Francisco Bay.  And with fresh scallops, maine lobster, smoked salmon, clams on a half shell, and three different kinds of oysters on display - it was more of an automatic attraction, than an actual decision I had to make. I had to stop by.\n\nAfter hanging your coat on the wall behind you, sit down and rest your arms on a gorgeous slab of solid white marble that's been at Swan's for over 100 years. Serving fresh seafood that's as simple, and wonderfully timeless as that white marble top is only one of the many reasons to love this place. Here, you'll always have a front row view of how each dish is prepared - another comforting example of the confidence they have in the freshness of their food.\n\nThe only menu they have is the one on the wall, and even that changes from day to day - depending on what is in season. Whether it's crab, oysters, and (sometimes) even sea urchin - there's always something wonderful to enjoy at Swan's. Their baked sourdough bread was perfect for dipping in their creamy clam chowder soup, and as I waited for the rest of my food - I got to enjoy watching servers shuck fresh oysters, throw together colorful seafood salads, and carve delicate slices of smoked salmon while enjoying a glass of chilled chardonnay. Sure, it's still a bar without a TV - but with the front row entertainment, I couldn't have cared less.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail, and oysters were so fresh and delicious by themselves, that tartar and cocktail sauce became unnecessary. This was easily my favorite part of the entire meal, and I ate each little piece of shrimp, one by one like it was buttered popcorn at a movie theatre. It's like tasting a slice of margherita pizza in Napoli - you'll find it remade in several other corners of the world, but you'll never find it as fresh and as perfect as you would at it's original home. And providing the freshest of seafood, and serving it clean, and absolutely untouched to let its' original flavors shine through is why Swan's Oyster Depot is such a popular favorite among seafood lovers. Polk street is full of delicious little eateries, and foodie favorites - but be sure to make a quick visit to this little seafood bar. This is the way fresh seafood should be enjoyed, and a great experience for vacationers who may not have the opportunity to taste such fresh seafood back in their hometown.\n\nClick Here for the Full Review: http://thehungrymuse.com/2011/03/20/the-hungry-muse/a-fresh-off-the-boat-feast/", "author": "Jennie T."}

Served with shrimp salad and sourdough bread on the side, along with a little plate of chopped onions and capers, its a real classic.  I also like the clam chowder here, the dungeness crab, and of course, the oysters! \n\nIf you come in the middle of the day you will be fighting with tourists and locals for a seat--the space inside is actually the opposite of \"a storehouse or warehouse\" (Webster's definition of a \"depot\").  Instead of a Home Depot-like cavernous space, you get a counter with about 15 seats in a row.  The perpetual fight for a seat keeps this place from 5 stars.  The service is good though, as long as you remember to flag down one of the guys behind the counter if you aren't approached first.\n\nI like this place for a smoked salmon breakfast, when you get here early enough, crowds are not an issue.", "author": "Aaron S."}

Old time San Francisco Bay Area seafood bar. The food was as fresh as if it just came from the boat, and watching them with the fish carts outside it likely did!  Worth the wait for your first time. Sometimes you can get lucky and catch them when they're not so busy. I've never had luck ordering takeout but it's not deterred me from coming back!  Great little gem!!", "author": "Jamil S."}

The freshest oysters are from all over, with a dribble of lemon juice and horseradish, or minionette, yum yum. A dozen of those delicious sliders make my entire day more pleasurable. \n\nWhen our local crab is in season, be prepared for the best you've ever had! The crabs from up north on the Pacific Coast are scrumptious too. A glass of Anchor Steam beer or muscadet is a perfect pairing for anything you might like to eat.\n\nA line for counter-only seating forms Monday through Saturday by around 10:30 a.m. so get there early, or prepare to chat with people from all over while you wait for a seat at the counter. I usually go to Swan alone and rarely have to wait, no matter what time of day.\n\nLots of folks drop by to pick up seafood to prepare at home, and Swan delivers in most parts of the City.\n\nSwan is undoubtedly one of the best, authentic San Francisco eateries.", "author": "Steep R."}

I understand that I'm paying for fresh seafood (yes, it was fresh) and partly for the decor/charm/history (yes, it was charming). The seafood salad was tasty, but c'mon - some pieces of crab and shrimps on top of regular lettuce with some louie dressing for almost $25? Additionally, I had heard so many good things about the chowder - the flavor was fine, but it seemed watered down, and there were only 2 measly pieces of potato/clams floating around. Unacceptable, especially with a 2 hour wait in line. I'd rather spend my money at Sotto Mare in the North End for some great seafood.", "author": "Connie L."}

Everything at Swan's appeals to me, from the slightly sullen but funny service to the wonderfully fresh, heaped helpings of crab-salad to the very thin but oh, so delicious clam chowder.  Two things to keep in mind when you visit:  they only have a tiny counter and no tables so there is almost always a wait to get in and they only take cash.  Outstanding oysters,  crustaceous crab, luscious lobster and smokin' smoked salmon! The seats at the counter are rickety and a little uncomfortable but the seafood is so delectable that you'll forget that soon.  If you haven't been lucky enough to eat at Swan's, gather up your cash and hurry on over for a first class meal!", "author": "Warwick M."}

What's not to like?\n\nI live in the 'hood and made it in for the first time recently, after a month of ill-fated attempts at doing so. \n\nLet me preface my account of the food by stating that I typically prefer breakfast to be the first meal of the day. You know, eggs, pancakes, granola, cereal. Not seafood. That's ok though, Swan made me forget all that.\n\nMy girlfriend and I walk in at 8:15 on a Saturday morning. There are always lines out the door, so we figured this would be a perfect time to beat the crowd. This proved to be correct, as we were the first ones there.\n\nThe menu is super simple - chowder, seafood salads, cocktails, oysters and whatever else they catch and haul in that day. We went for the chowder, the crab salad, and oysters. Oysters to begin with, oysters again after we finished the rest of our food. The chowder was tasty - and actually had nicely sized chunks of clam in it. It wasn't too salty either. The crab salad was your ordinary salad with lump crab sitting atop. Delicious. I could taste the ocean on that one. The oysters - kumamoto, hama hama - were also very fresh and tasted great with a squeeze of lemon or horseradish sauce. \n\nAll in all, this place met and exceeded all of my expectations. If you're expecting sophisticated entr\u00e9es, fancy dec\u00f3r, or fast food prices, then I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere. If on the other hand, you love fresh fruit from the sea and don't mind paying for it, then this place has your name written all over it.", "author": "Zach F."}

Even still, the wait was over and when we entered the restaurant, the staff was courteous and outgoing.  I loved the vibe of that hole-in-the-wall restaurant where the staff is not afraid to interact with everyone in the restaurant.  We got the crab salad and the clam chowder.  Probably the best clam chowder I've ever had!  It's not overly creamy and it's filled with spoonfuls of clam meat.  It was delicious and satisfied my clam chowder craving for the day.  The crab salad was so fresh and tasty, yet such a simple concept.  Overall, the experience in the restaurant was fast and memorable.  I don't know if I would ever revisit with a line that long, but worth trying on some off hours of the day.", "author": "Debbie C."}

We had everything you can imagine. \n\nThe OYSTER SAMPLER PLATTER consist of Blue Point, Miyagi (my fav), & Kumamoto oysters. Which can be eaten alone or with their mignonette sauce. This is heaven. It goes great with beer...yes, beer at 11AM in the morning.\n\nThe SHRIMP COCKTAIL is oh so good. You can taste the ocean in your mouth and you just can't stop. You can ask for a side of freshly grated horseradish on the side if you want to add some heat on it. \n\nThe CRAB SALAD is great and fresh. The juicy morsel of chunky crab meat is succulent and the best part is you don't have to pick it off the shell which can get a little annoying when you are supper hungry. \n\nLeave some room for some of their homemade CLAM CHOWDER you wont regret it. \n\nTIPS: Get here early! Once they are out of the fresh seafood they will close the doors. The place is a narrow tiny little bar located in lower nob hill. You can find street parking easily or park at the Holiday Inn just a block away. It's hard to miss the place when you can see a stretch of hungry folks waiting to get in. \n\nAsk for their business card.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "I'm very torn about not giving this place 5 stars. But I can't just assign a rating willy-nilly, and I can't help but compare this place to my first love: Hog Island at the Ferry Building. It is a difficult comparison though, due to the fact that the only thing these places have in common is that they serve excellent seafood and they are both located in San Francisco. But where they are located is very different and the feel is very very different. \n\nThere is bar seating only and not much of it compared to the crowd it draws. Having passed by this place before, I've seen the line that goes out the door, so it was daunting to actually decide when to go. Multiple attempts to schedule visits to Swan with friends ultimately fell through. Finally, this morning (Saturday) when I woke up at the crack of noon, I decided to suck it up and brave the line alone as I'm temporarily living within a few blocks of Swan. I got there around 12:30 and was very pleasantly surprised when the line only barely stretched out the door. There was a trio and a couple ahead of me with beers in hand because they take drink orders for people waiting in line. Having never been there before and not knowing what to do, I asked the couple ahead of me what the deal with the line was, whether I needed to put my name down or anything like that. They said you just get in line, though people ordering to-go could bypass the line. They also told me that if it was just me, there were probably a few stray available seats. I walked in to take a look and indeed immediately found a seat. So basically, my wait was less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe seating was cozy but not too bad. There was no place to put my purse except my lap, but I just don't really like to put it on the floor. It took a little while to put in my drink order (Anchor Steam, of course! The other choices are Bud and Stella), but once I got a server, everything was good. It's a little chaotic behind the bar just because its not like each server is assigned to a certain spot; it's just a matter of whose eye you catch. The menu is on the wall, so thank goodness I brought my glasses. \n\nHaving skimmed the other yelp reviews, I determined to get a bowl of the clam chowder and a half dozen oysters. Man, oysters really are an expensive habit, but so worth it. $13 for a half dozen. Now, I'm not at all a person who ever orders off menu, so I just go off of what I see. The menu had an option for half dozen (Blue Point?) oysters, or there was a mixed option for the dozen. When I ordered, however, the server very helpfully suggested that I could get the half dozen mixed as well. So, I was glad to be able to try 3 different kinds of oysters. I can't quite remember the names of the oysters, just where they were from. The Maine oysters, I didn't like too much as they were too big. Despite my love for oysters, there is still a part of me super-squicked out about the idea of consuming these things raw. The local ones were okay, but the Washington ones were by far the best. I don't think they were the Kunamoto, as I don't think that's what he said. But I appreciated that he took the time to tell me which ones were which and about the mignonettes. He asked if I wanted cocktail sauce, which I rejected, because I hate cocktail sauce and I think eating oysters  is a wasted experience if you dump cocktail sauce on there. \n\nI didn't like the clam chowder as much as some of the other reviewers. I like thicker chowders (and I think I also prefer them with bacon...). It was still pretty good, but I think I'll try something else next time. But for $5, definitely one of the cheaper options at Swan. \n\nI like that bread and butter is not complimentary. Well, it may as well be since it is only a dollar. But I don't really like bread anyway-- it usually goes generally untouched by me unless I'm starving, so I'm always feeling guilty about the wasted bread. However, when the server asked me if I wanted bread, I was caught off guard and so overwhelmed by the place that I just agreed. But paying for the bread, even just one dollar, gives me more incentive to eat it, and I used it to sop up the chowder, which made the meal a little heartier. \n\nYou also have to ask for water. I actually really like the restaurants that do that because it saves water. I personally do tend to drink the water, but have seen so many people not even touch theirs. \n\nI really like their simple bare bones operation, the fantastic service, and the excellent seafood. I think I'll go for one of the seafood salads or the crab next time. And if I've saved up for the month, the lobster. Though I'll probably bring a friend for the lobster. My only trepidation about going again is that my timing will not always be so great. Once I left today, around 1:30, the line was out the door.", "author": "Jia min C."}

I've been here many times over the years, and I still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time.  The oysters are always good, and when they're local and in season, they're wonderful.  The key is to ask whoever's attending to you which ones are the freshest and most local.  And also, remember that any month with an \"r\" in it means oyster season.  If you like crabs, they also have good crab.  I'd get the seafood cocktail, and just ask for extra crab if you wish.  Stay away from the seafood salad, unless you dig iceberg lettuce.\n\nI enjoy everything about this place-the cramped space, the wiry benches, the lunch counter setup, the junk on the walls, the helter skelter vibe, the seafoody smell, the hat hooks behind the counter, all of it.  It's very San Francisco in my opinion, and great for snapshots, which I've taken many.\n\nThere's always seems to be a line at Swan, especially at mealtime.  I've never had to wait, however, even on saturdays.  All you do is plan to have an early brunch and arrive between 10 and 11am.  They open at 8am, so you can even have breakfast there, thouth that's a bit early for an Anchor.  \n\nIf you get to know any of the people who work there, they many even hand you a special treat!", "author": "Roland C."}

That day the foodie god must has been smiling on us.... I got parking literally across the street just like that and when we went to the place, lo and behold... no waiting!(thx. Giants parade!) I heard the line can be long at times but it just like the place is waiting for us! My friend went for the chowder which is delicious, but I went straight for the big mama... the oyster sampler! I had Oyster Rockefeller at the Four Seasons New York but the sampler at Swan's just blew my mind! No pretension, just total authentic heaven in your mouth..... Even the place is very authentic, classic fishmonger place, classic cash register, and food prepared fresh.

Maybe it's because I had such high expectations for this place, but I really can't see why everyone loves this place so much.  \nBetween my wife and I, we shared a dozen oysters, half a crab, and a couple drinks.  I don't mind splurging on a good meal, but what we were served clearly did not warrant the almost $60 tab (tip included). \n\nGood:\n- the Louie sauce was very tasty\n-bread was good\n-oysters were ok\n-friendly staff\n\nBad:\n-Way too expensive for what you actually get\n-Crab was very small and not as juicy as I had expected at this price point\n-not so sanitary conditions.

We almost stopped at an Indian restaurant but decided to keep walking just in case something really sparked our interests.  We then almost stopped at a sushi spot, but noticed some of the action next door coming from The Swan Oyster Depot.  We looked inside from the door and saw that almost every seat in the counter style restaurant was taken.  The visible demand sold us.  \n\nWe walked in and found two seats at the counter where we were immediately greeted by the friendly group of guys working the fresh fish.  Its a family operated business and you definitely get family hospitality.  The food was great.  We ordered a combination salad, crab cocktails, chowder, and a mixed plate of oysters.  Everything was delicious.  The seafood was all as fresh as possible.  A local sitting next to us said, \"this is where the fishermen come to eat.\"  I really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back next time I'm in town.\n\nIt wasn't cheap, but it was worth every penny.\nThe place is small and is not the best for big groups.", "author": "Hugo G."}

Everything and anything can be found in the city, but what really sets them apart is their selection of quality seafood. In a city so well known for seafood, I would figure it to be impossible to find the best Clam Chowder, but my theory proved to be wrong as soon as I walked into Swan's Oyster Depot. This spot can be found on Polk street, and you have to be careful when you drive by because the restaurant is so small, you will probably drive right past it. What's probably easier is to look for the long line of people heading into a hole in the wall, because that's precisely what you are looking for. \n\nNow, I consider myself somewhat of a chowder connoisseur, so I was very excited to check this place out. I tried to go here once before, but the wait was one and a half hours and I couldn't wait because I had to be somewhere later that afternoon. Back to the chowder at hand...my friends and I arrived to the place at 11:45am on a Monday, and much to our surprise, there was NO line! We walked right in and there were three remaining seats, the perfect amount for our party. This place is small, there are no tables, only a counter that seats about 15 people which can explain the usual line down the street. Since we had a day full of culinary adventures, we had to save room so each of us ordered a clam chowder in a bowl and a combination seafood cocktail. \n\nThe chowder.....\n\nI have had a lot of chowder in my life and I must say, Swan's has some of the best I have EVER had. It is not thick, but more of a creamy soup consistency. There are plenty of ingredients found in your typical chowder like potatoes and of course clams. But it's the soup that really sets it apart. It just tasted amazing. I knew something was up when it was served because you can see a light layer of oil on the top (you can see it in the picture above if you click on the thumbnail). Oh, before I forget...get the side of sourdough bread, it's perfect for dipping in the soup. \n\nOn to the combination seafood cocktail...\n\nEach order of combination cocktail came with an oyster on top, some shrimps and a bunch of crab, all topped with their cocktail sauce. On the counter was a big bowl of horseradish sauce to add to your liking, but I decided to try it first without. It tasted pretty good, but once I added the horseradish sauce...WOW, this dish was GREAT. The horseradish has some serious kick, so be careful if you don't like too much heat. \n\nAll in all, this place is wonderful. The chowder is exceptional and from the looks of it, so is everything else on the menu. It's not a hidden gem as a lot of people in the city know about it, so be prepared to go early or wait awhile. Just a note, on our way out, there was a line of 15 people waiting to get in, so we were lucky with not having to wait.\n\nmore reviews can be found on www.thekitchenfloor.com", "author": "Koji I."}

I would say this is probably one of the freshest seafood places I have been to. And the best uni (sea urchin) I've tasted, they crack open the sea urchin before they give it to you so it is literally right out of the shell. Oysters are also very good. For a small meal of 2 cups clam chowder, 6 oysters,and 1 uni  the total came out to $50 (including tax/tip) between two people. Be warned that I I dont eat too much, so you may spend more. The table next to me spent $80. I think for most people, you will be spending $30-40 per person to be really full. I think the experience is worth it because the seafood is definitely fresh. However, I will not be coming back often.\n\nService is hit or miss. The main server we had was a bit of a klutz and gave us a really shoddy presentation for our uni plate.

We waited about 30 min. The staff was friendly, and when we got close to the door, they served us our drinks. It seemed almost impossible to get a group of 4 to sit together because of the bar seating, so our group had to separate into two. \n\nThe servers are very sarcastic and to the point. Once you get past the initial awkward thought of \"is he being serious?\" they are very nice. \n\nThe food was great. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed the Miyagi Oysters best. He had a Shrimp Cocktail which he loved. I had an OK cup of clam chowder.. Not the best, but pretty decent. We also had their raw salmon and albacore tuna. Definitely Sashimi grade. We were very happy with everything here. \n\nOnly down side was the long wait... Otherwise I'd go here again. \n\nPS. CASH ONLY but there is a Chase ATM across the street.", "author": "Rosalyn D."}

My friend was in town from Wisconsin and had come to this place with his father every time he came to visit. His father recently passed away so he wanted to come to this place before he took off again. The wait was just over 25 minutes but I have to say that it was (indeed) worth it. I started out with a cup of the clam chowder. As others have mentioned, their clam chowder resembles more of a soup because the base is not thick at all. The milk/creme does appear to be separated from the rest of the soup but the taste is still quite good. One of the waiters had suggested I try some Tabasco sauce and I obliged. It was pretty darn good for dipping the sour dough in.\n\nMy wife and I then moved on to the combination Louie salad which had copious amounts of crab, shrimp, and prawns. Their thousand island dressing was nothing special but still good.\n\nNext we moved on to a Crab Cocktail. Which was very sweet and delicious. The great thing about Crab Cocktails is that they are so simple and yet so good.\n\nNext my friends ordered a dozen mixed oysters. There are two sauces you can place on your oysters. One was a vinegar inion mixture that was very good, but the other was far better. I'm not exactly sure what was in it but it was a greenish color and it was spicy. Loved it.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try their Smoked Salmon but I will next time.", "author": "Matthew B."}

That would explain the 1.5 hour wait out the door, but as we got closer and were able to take a look inside the restaurant, we realized that the entire restaurant is only able to accommodate around 20 diners. It's basically a seafood bar. Anyway, we order a dozen mixed oysters ($26) which consisted of Miyagi, Blue Point, and some other one I can't remember, combination cocktail (crab, boiled shrimp, one raw oyster, and one raw clam), a bowl of clam chowder, and smoked salmon on toasted bread with capers and onions. We weren't looking to get full here since the price just doesn't justify it, but we did get to eat everything that we wanted to here for $58 + tip. Everything was delicious and it was the best clam chowder that I've ever had. It's much less creamy, which I have decided is the better way to eat a clam chowder, but didn't lack in taste. Every spoonful had pieces of clam and potato. The oysters weren't worth the $26, I'll just stick to my $6/dozen gulf oysters at Captain Tom's here in Houston. \n\nThe cons: The seating situation. Not only are the seats super uncomfortable, your neighbor is practically sitting on your lap. You're not only rubbing elbows, but thighs and knees. \n\nThe waitstaff is not only handling your food with their bare hands, they're also handling money, dirty dishes, and probably scratching their heads and asses as well without washing.

Luckily, we were early enough to be only the fifth party in line for lunch when we arrived, and only had to wait about 15-20 min to be seated. They didn't have uni, but I found everything I ate to be pretty good! Watch out for the horseradish. It's very fresh, and much more powerful than what you normally get, so apply with caution. I loved the crab cocktail, and the oysters. Fresh and full of the flavor of the sea. Clams were good but not totally my thing though. The fish sauce that they recommend with the clams needs more acid, I put in some mignonette as well and it worked well. The clam chowder was very rich in clam flavor, rather than thick with thickeners, and I really liked that. I tried the Italian syle sashimi, but wasn't too blown away. It was good, but not as delicious as the crab cocktail. Also, they were going on about how the sardine was good today, but I didn't get any sardine in my sashimi. I did get some scallops, and they were very sweet and fresh. A win. Another thing to note- it's easy to spend some serious cash here! But raw food! But the line out the door tells you what you need to know. So why not five stars? The bar needs an upgrade, my seat had no space for my legs. They kept taking away my mignonette, I kept having to take it back. Well, not big deals, compared to the food, but it was imperfect enough for me to say, okay, go ahead and laugh all the way to the bank, I guess I'll be back, but I just wish you wouldn't take advantage of seafood addicts like me.

The \"house made\" cocktail sauce is ketchup based with no added flavor or tanginess, its just horrible sauce.It gives cocktail sauce and ketchup a bad name.

I was going to Brownies to pick up some hardware.  I looked into restaurant and for once there wasn't a line out the door.  I was curious....\n\nI timidly walked in and was a bit intimidated by the old school charm, everyone chatting and laughing as if they have known each other all their lives.  I saw a seat open and was figuring out the next thing to do.  The guy behind the marble counter came over and did the \"how you duin\"?  He sensed that I was confused and a bit shy.  He walked me through step by step on how the menu on the wall works and gave me a moment while he got my water.  I ordered the clam chowder, it was the best I have ever had.  Although watery, but I preferred it that way.  You can taste all the components in the chowder.  I have had my share of New England clam chowder during my college years.  Great with the buttery bread.\n\nNow I feel a bit bolder, since the guy made me feel like his buddy.  I ordered 1/2 dozen of oysters, his pick.  He went away and came back with the most beautifully chucked oysters I have ever seen.  He explained each and everyone of them to me and I slurp those suckers down with cocktail and horseradish.  On my last one, I got his attention and he knew I wanted 6 more.\n\nSo this place really made my afternoon.

All I was thinking was: this place better be worth it.  Well, I am happy to report that I was rather satisfied.  The oysters were very fresh.  They better be...after all, they are shucked right in front of you. My favorite still remains the kumamoto. Small yet jam-packed with flavor. They offered a couple of different kinds of sauces.  Try them all, especially the habenero vinagarette!  Great with the oysters.  The crab and shrimp louie salad was definitely a good choice; it comprised of a generous heaping of freshly shredded dungeness crab. The clam chowder was different.  You could certainly taste the clams.  It wasn't the thick chowder I'm accustomed to - more of a flavorful thin clammy goodness.  The last thing I got, which I thought was the best, turned out to be free.  If you ask them for the crab head, they give it to you complimentary.  I know it sounds gross and so full in cholesterol, but you have got to try it.  If I could have, I would have asked for two more and bagged them to take home. If you dip it in some bread, it is really scrumptious.\n\nThe service is fun and they move quickly to get you in and out as the line out the door never seems to shorten.

Your waiter/chef will most likely slice the raw scallops in front of you and chat away gregariously, they really remind me of Japanese itamaes.  They serve two styles of sashimi -- Eastern and Western.  The Western sashimi pieces are drizzled with olive oil and topped with capers; Eastern style involves a drop of Sriracha sauce with some ponzu shouyu sauce on the side.  I personally prefer the Eastern style much more.\n\nThey also serve free kani-miso (kani = crab, miso indicates the texture/appearance of miso paste) -- top half of a crab.  It's essentially a mixture of brains and eggs served in its original shell, or... if you prefer, a cholesterol bomb in a shell.

There's something very unique -- something very San Franciscan -- about shelling out $40 for a 400-calorie meal prepared and served by polite, cheerful dudes who could probably eat an entire minivan full of Combos (pepperoni pizza flavor, most likely).

Subtle.\n\nWe had delicious chowder (sounds SEXY!), Crab Louie (HOT HOT HOT) and of course, Oysters.\n\nNow, let's examine the supposed sexual healing that happens in the midst of oyster intake:\n\nIs it the sensual way they glisten as you pick them up?  Is it the way you open wide and they fill your mouth with salty, briny liquid?  Is it the way they slip down your throat effortlessly?  Is it the way you look deep into your dining companions eyes, knowing that you both just want more?\n\nUmmmm....\n\nNo.  It is not one of those things.  The aphrodisiac is the alcohol you ingest whilst sucking down shellfish.  An oyster connoisseur who has 4 beers by 1pm?

We were able to get a seat right away. I ordered my 12 kumomos,  12 miyagis and half a cracked crab. The crab was very pricy ( $16.50 for half a crab) but they practically do all the work for you. It wasn't just cracked, they took the time to remove half of the shell from all the legs so all you had to do was pick up the meat off the shell.   Yes, I am a lazy one, and I would gladly pay the extra money for someone to do all the work for me!\n\nThe staff was always very mindful. As I was eating my crab.. they kept cleaning my mess up for me and also brought me a wash bowl. \n\nWhen the oysters came out, about half of the Miyagi's were bigger than what I'd prefer. I told the waiter \"ewe, I'm scared of big ones\" and he took all the big ones back and replaced them with the smaller ones. THAT was awesome! the quality of the seafood was outstanding.\n\nThe decor of the place was very cute. They had a very old cash register. I was amazed that it still worked. All the decorations looked like it could have been as old as the resturaunt itself. It added a lot of character to the place. A lot of things were done old-school. Like the butter for my crab was melted using the coffee maker. \n\nIn the front of the store, they had endless mounts of crab, calamari and other types of seafood. It looked amazing. The only thing that they could do better is making sure they handled the food properly. I did notice that the guys made the salads, took money and then wiped of counters w/o washing hands in between.... it made me glad I only ordered things that had shells so they weren't touching the meat.", "author": "Anna T."}

I wanted to make this one a special place, but I have a tendency to review only places I like, and thus most of my favorite places I have already reviewed.  \n\nBUT, when I realized I had not yet reviewed Swan, I was elated.  Easily on my top 5 list of places to eat in San Francisco, Swan is a true gem of our fine city.  For those of us who love fresh seafood and hate (for the most part, as sometimes it can be fun) pretension, Swan is true find.  \n\nBecause Swan is VERY small (the number of seats numbers in the teens) and well known and a local institution, let me give you some tips on how to maximize your time here.  \n1.  Arrive early.  If you arrive after 11:45, you will have to wait--sometimes for a LONG time.  \n2.  If you don't arrive early, don't sweat it.  Everyone in line is friendly, and you all make it through your hunger pains together (though staring at the food in the window is pure torture).  \n3.  Once you are seated, don't bitch about being uncomfortable or cramped.  No one cares.  \n4.  The guys who work there know how to take care of you, so just let them.  If they suggest you try something, do it.  \n5.  Don't leave without having the smoked salmon.  It is the best I have ever had.  \n6.  Have a beer or a glass of wine.  Trust me.  \n7.  Ask for one of their business cards/sponges.  Just cause.  \n\nThat's about it.  Swan is one of those neighborhood businesses where, if by some stroke of terrible luck they were going under, I would join the campaign and donate money to keep them afloat.  The city would not be as rich of a place without Swan.", "author": "Blake W."}

But I am spoiled -- was recently at Splash Cafe in Pismo Beach.  But that's another review for another day.\n- Combo cocktail - just okay.  Cold, not seasoned.  Just a cup of steamed seafood topped with gritty raw oysters and cocktail sauce on the side.\n- Oysters: average. Had Miyagis, Kunamotos, and Blue Points.  Shells were jagged and broken so hard to slurp.  Luckily did not cut myself.\n- Sicilian style sashimi - best thing we had but not listed on the menu.  Tuna, salmon and scallops with capers, onion and olive oil. Vastly improved with our additions of salt and lemon.\n\nVERDICT: Save your time and money.  Okay overall but doesn't live up to the hype!

After reading all of the fantastic reviews on Yelp, Michael and I decided to hit up Swan's.  We went on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 pm, so there wasn't much of a line.  We were behind two groups and sat after about 25 minutes of waiting.  We sat, got a little confused in regards to how to order, figured it out and got us a bowl o' chowder and two dozen mixed oysters.  \n\nChowder was kinda amazing...a little watery, but the clams were so fresh it really did taste like they came right out of the water (which they did - $4.50).  We shared it with bread and butter ($1) and watched as Dean shucked our oysters.  Oh man...those oysters...\n\n...were so damn good!  We had a combination of different oysters and my favorite were the local ones.  So flavorful and so fresh...I-want-more!  Dean was so wonderful - he definitely made the experience awesome.  He shucked...he smiled...he took pictures of us Asians...he is the amazing DEAN.  Ask for him, he's so nice.  \n\nThen...someone behind the bar was making a plate of SCALLOPS, olive oil and CAPERS - oh, dear lord!  Did heaven descend on us?  Seriously?  We ordered a small plate (Dean got it for us for a little cheaper than $16.50) and DAMN I have never had raw scallops and WOW they were so buttery and so good, I want them now!  \n\nI will never forget my experience at Swan's.  They only take cash and they are mad cool.  I almost cannot refer you to a better oyster/raw food bar than Swan's.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-07", "description": "Over my lengthy, storied history of dining (I've been known to have had something to eat almost every single day, for my entire life), one constant I've found at places that are \"any good\" is a line of people waiting to get in. This is not to suggest that a good place *has* to have someone waiting in line to get in. However, if an establishment has 10-12 schmucks standing on the sidewalk every time you walk by, that sneaking suspicion that they know something you don't is probably correct.\n\nFounded in the early 20th century, Swan's has basically had a line of people waiting to get in for 100 years. Thankfully, Id recently moved into the neighborhood and happened by at an opportune time. On an ordinary Wednesday around 2pm, we only had to wait behind four people for about twenty minutes. As I shook my head, thinking to myself that I really don't even like oysters that much, I learned that Swan's is deceivingly named an Oyster Depot, yet serves such other seafood delicacies as shrimp and crab cocktail, \"Boston\" clam chowder (more later), fresh fish and, obviously, oysters. \n\nHaving grown up in Boston, I suffer from a common New England fixation with sampling any clam chowder advertised as \"Boston/New England/Cape Cod\", typically so I can shake my head disdainfully and explain to someone who is not a \"chowderhead\" that this is not, in fact, chowder from New England. While Swan's does put forward a tasty bowl and at least got the crackers right, the broth is too clear and not nearly damaging enough to my arteries to qualify as legit. But then again, it's not called Swan's Chowder Depot, is it?\n\nWe sampled six different oysters - mostly from the Bay, Washington and Canada and they were all pretty good. A chowder connoisseur I may be, but f*ck if I know a thing about oysters!! Irregahdless, there was only one - a rather large myagi - that was a little too slimy, not enough salty for me. I think we knocked them all back in about four minutes and were quite pleased. \n\nHigh props went to the crab cocktail, which we also sampled during the appetizer course. With a nod perhaps to the equally venerable and touristy Ghiradelli's, they serve up the fresh crab dripped in a housemade cocktail sauce and damn if it doesn't look just like or taste just as good as a hot fudge sundae.\n\nAll in all, Swan's is worth the four person wait. Knowing what I know now, I would probably stretch to six or seven people, but not chance more than 20 minutes in line. Perhaps if this is like the fifth time your parents/brother/sister are in town and you're out of tour guide options, I can see how the combination of killing time and being in the know with a locally acknowledged hole in the wall with a reasonably priced fresh catch may warrant a longer wait. Chances are good that when they return home and tell someone else that's been to San Francisco that they went to Swan's Oyster Depot that the reference will stick and they'll then be able to say \"Good!\" when they get asked how the oysters were and that might be quite pleasant.", "author": "Bryan P."}

Personally I always get the Miyagi's and a couple of anchor steams.  You can't go wrong with the crab salads or the shrimp cocktails.  They won't hold back on the crab meat or shrimp either.  They know you have come for it, and they will give it to you.  Combine that with some good ole' dark crust San Francisco supreme sourdough bread and you've got yourself a meal my friend!\n\nI never have really cared for the chowder.  Too watery and too damn salty.  It would the only thing I would pass on.  Everything else here is extremely fresh and tastes great.  Just remember to bring good ole' American currency (read cash).  This place has been and continues to be very successful and they don't take credit cards.

When I go here, I amuse myself by speculating how they've managed to not be shut down by food inspectors. Bread is stacked on dusty shelves, they're cutting up fish in front of you while you eat, and I've seen them bring in whole salmon to scrub in the sinks used for all purposes. I guess I have strange standards for amusement. \n\nThat being said, it is still my favorite seafood place. I am careful where I eat, and I've never had concerns that their food was anything but absolutely fresh.  They will rush you a bit if you dally at the counter, so it's not the place for a casual hour-long lunch. But it's hard to beat the price and surly ambiance for a tray of oysters and a beer. I pretty much stick with that and their smoked fish plate. Yummy!", "author": "Bubbles L."}

You eat the very fresh seafood here, taste the best shelled clams & oysters (barely any bits of shells), enjoy the sweetness of raw stuff, and you get out of here. Very efficient. Very tasty.

It's not like you don't order anything but still taking the seat. I can't believe someone is complaining about the customers waiting in line here. It's an oyster depot, DEPOT, like an oyster bar! You want comfy seat, go to Red Lobster, and let me tell you, you are probably getting frozen seafood. \n\nAgain, it's true what the others have said. You can't go there for the cooking, the sauce, the creativity, the dining environment, the presentation, because there is none. You go there for the freshest, most original taste of seafood. \n\nBy the way, if you like the creamy clam chowder, don't order it from Swan. To be honest, I don't like its clam chowder either, but it's another way of making it. Swan uses powder form instead of Safeway-canned form so it's not thick and creamy.

Well because we were there late and the boys in the place close around 5:00 or 5:30 they gave us a note that says that we were the last in the line, meaning that if someone got behind us we needed to hand the sign and break their heart telling them, sorry we are the last ones.\n\nWell I was in my third beer and we were still nowhere inside the place but we met three fun people. Steve which was a local customer, very friendly, Arby and Ab.....  (I can't remember how to spell it, please make a note I had alcohol over the driving limit).  Anyways, it was so much fun, at one point I forgot what was the line for since we were simply having fun in the line.\n\nWhen we got in and found seats available the ambience was incredible, it reminded me of my \"ole times\" I basically ate 3 dozens of oysters, a shrimp cocktail, a calamari cocktail salad and a shrimp cocktail with two more beers.\n\nWell...the guys kept asking -\"Does anybody else want more Oysters\" DUH... I kept saying yes! I ate until I could become a maritime beast, not like I am not one already! \n\nWell The guys are simply the best. We pretty much closed the place and the people there is extra friendly which is super nice. We met people from Ohio and Boston and yes we had a blast! The line was nothing but the appetizer for a marvelous meal. If you are planning to come to have sea food arrive early or expect a friendly line.

I have to admit that when I saw the line as I was approaching, I did think about turning around.  However, I was determined to give this place a shot and figured that the food must be good if there's a line.  We finally got seated about an hour later.  \n\nThe wait got us hungry and we wanted everything!  We started off with a dozen of assorted oysters: Blue Point, Drake's Bay and Tomales Bay.  They were so fresh and nicely chilled that we ordered another dozen.  :)  Then we had a dozen of the Cherry Stone clams on a half shell.  Again, very fresh and nicely chilled.  To me, these 2 aspects are important when having oysters and clams on a half shell because they're just gross warm even when sitting on a bed of ice.  Then we had scallop sashimi.  This was served carpaccio style with butter, olive oil, chopped onions and capers.  The scallops were fresh and sweet.  We had seen pictures from previous Yelpers on some fish sashimi, so we decided to have some: Blue Fin tuna and salmon.  We all agreed that this was a dish we could've skipped.  The fish were fresh, but definitely not sushi quality.  Next came the smoked salmon (flavorful and buttery) served with chopped onions and capers on a sliced baguette.  We finished off with a bowl of clam chowder.  Different from what I'm use to (the creamy style) and runnier but it was delicious.  There was a purer clam juice flavor that I liked a lot.\n\nThe service was outstanding.  All the previous reviews about the service was spot on.  Everyone there was friendly and happy to answer any questions you have.  Our main server was Jimmy.  When we started to rattle off our order, he suggested the order to have them as to not mess with our pallet.  Although he was the main person that helped us, everyone there was helpful.  There was a nice warmth and family feel amongst everyone that works there.\n\nAll in all, a great first but not last experience.  Any place that has great service, atmosphere and food will always keep me coming back.  The only negative was the cramp bar style seating.  If you want fine dining, this isn't the place for you.

The shrimp louie salad was outstanding -- the portions ample and the shrimp to lettuce ratio commendable.  \n\nFinally I must mention the clam chowder.  I LOVE clam chowder.  I eat it every chance I get.  I like it nice and thick and creamy with plenty of clam and little to no potato.  The clam was nice and chunky -- NO grit either. You usually have to expect a bit of grit, but theirs was totally sans.  The soup itself was a bit thin, but by no means watery.  Despite that one mark, I still give their clam chowder top marks.\n\nI can't wait to go back, dig into some cracked crab and another louie salad.  Three of us ate there for lunch and spent $35.

I sampled Blue Points (not a Western oyster originally), Miyagis, Kumomotos, and Olympias. All were delicous.

Kumos had the famous creamy texture, and the little Olympias surprised me with a great brine and hints of chocolate, believe it or not.\n\nWhile I savored the bivalves, a rickety, bearded old fisherman sauntered in quietly and ordered a sea urchin.

All four of us had been in line for about an hour and ten.  we ended up sitting next to them at the counter.  They ordered two bowls of clam chowder, which comes with their fantastic sourdough bread, and one of them had a beer.  THEY WAITED AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES FOR SOUP, BREAD AND A BEER.  that's how good the clam chowder is.  or, maybe more importantly, that's how great of a place this is.  the wait adds to your anticipation, makes you know how special it will be once you get inside. Once inside. plunk your booty down on a tiny stool,  take up your one foot of counter space, and wait for the drooling to begin.  \n\nAnother special moment:  Watching the care that one of the older counter guys takes when picking out your crab and shrimp for the combo louie salad.  it's like he's selecting jewels, and placing them on a bed of velvet - when in fact he's plucking fat pieces of crab and plump shrimps to nestle in shredded iceberg lettuce, to soon be napped in a rich thousand island dressing.  Such creamy goodness.  \n\nWe had the combo raw clam and oyster platter - 6 oysters, 3 of a kind, 3 big neck clams and 3 little neck clams.  All fresh and bright and slippery and yum.  Sides of kicky horseradish, cocktail sauce, and mignonette.  We wanted the steamed lobster but they were out.  Damn.  Were dying to dip succulent lobster hunks in the little copper pots that they serve the drawn butter in. \n\nWe shared the clam chowder soup - not too thick, very milky, very clammy, rich but not cloying.  Little perfectly cooked potato die.  Jig of Tabasco - aahhhh.\n\nThe star for me (besides that bread) was the combo salad.  Again, just these big fat pieces of crab and shrimp covered in their super unctuous dressing, over crisp cool iceberg.  My sister needed to doctor the dressing a bit with their cocktail sauce - for her the dressing was too rich.  I loved it - been craving it all day.\n\nAmazingly, we spent only $40+, and were so full and satisfied.\n\nI had a Stella Artois on tap, and next time I'll have a couple glasses of the Pinot Grigio, or better yet, the French Muscadet.

Even with 20 stools of people and a long wait line they make you feel as if you are the only customer they are serving....awesome service. \n\nWe ordered a bowl of clam chowder, cup of chowder, a combination salad (crabs and shrimp) with louie dressing along with bread and 2 Pepsi.  Our bill came out to around 30.00 ish.\n\nThe flavor of the clam chowder was delicious...just the right amount of salt and tastes very homemade.  The only thing I wished it had was a bread bowl instead of cut up bread on the side if anything and wished that the soup itself was a bit more thick.  Our salad was stacked with shrimp and crabs...they definitely do not go short on their seafood.  Very fresh and delicious.\n\nI notice when I finally got to the front of the door that there was a separate line for take out.  I would find this very useful if I lived in town!  We definitely enjoyed our food.  We waited in line for 2 hours and ate our food up in about 30 minutes, probably because we were so hungry! lol!  Would we stay in line for 2 hours again?  No, I don't think we would stay in line for 2 hours, maybe 30 minutes.  Next time I'm in town I think I'll stop by and take food to go!  It was a fun experience though!", "author": "Sharona R."}

But I got here at 4:45 and they were giving out the last number and I had to leave and went to Blue Anchor instead. The Blue Anchor was very nice and fine dining at a small place. However, Swan Oyster Depot is always at the back of my mind.\nCame here today around 1, and very lucky that only waited for 5 mins. When first got seated and I looked around this place, was not very impressed with the environment, or menu. There were not restaurant entries here, only oysters, clam chowder, seafood salad and steamed fish, smoked salmon. \nBut when our a dozen of Oysters came, I changed my opinion about this place. The Oysters were fresh and the sauces came with it were interesting, But I liked the horseradish and cocktail sauce the best. Oysters were very sweet and juicy. Then the smoked salmon swerved with red onion & caper on rye bread was very delicious, the salmon had strong taste but not too much to handle. The Cherry Stone Clams were very interesting and \"solid\", it's strong but not fish. Also the clam chowder was nice, very different. It's not very creamy like other places, instead you can really taste the seafood in it and soup was lighter. Surprisingly like it. \nI still prefer Blue Anchor more since that place is more suitable for a real meal, but this place is interesting to try and look.", "author": "Michele S."}

I know I tend toward exaggeration, but in this case and this case alone, it is not possible to hyperbolize the wonder that is Swan.\n\nSwan is all about simplicity. It is not about fancy menus, experimenting with taste combinations, or ornate marinades and sauces. It is about quality and purity. And quality and purity is what you get. Swan is classic seafood, through and through.\n\nThe louie salad is a must. I recommend the combo (a handful each of dungeness crab, prawns, and bay shrimp over crisp lettuce topped with the perfect amount of creamy louie dressing) for first-timers, though I myself often order the bay shrimp louie. I've eyed the lobster version, but still have not taken the plunge and ordered it. They serve their impressive assortment of oysters freshly shucked with perfectly tangy mignonette and cocktail sauce with just the right ratio of tomato and horseradish. I especially appreciate their offering of local choices as well as options from the Puget Sound and Vancouver (tastes like home!) The seafood cocktails and fish are nice alternatives. Watching them slice the salmon is especially impressive. The clam chowder is creamy and classic, but I only get it if we get there early. Later in the day, after it's been heated for a few hours, it tends to separate and even get a little lumpy. Even fresh, it's not my favorite chowder, which is disappointing since it's one of my favorite foods.\n\nIf the food isn't enough of a draw, the delightfulness of the family behind the counter should get you into a stool. Everyone is treated as a friend, and watching them shuck oysters and create the masterpiece salads offers almost as much enjoyment as you get from eating the food. Almost. Be sure to ask for a sponge business card for any out of town guests.\n\nSwan is worth braving the line at any time of day, and it's even fun people-watching and observing the food preparation (especially the giant $400 to-go orders which they make from memory - nothing written down!) while you wait if you're ready for it. But, the earlier the better if you're in a hurry. Going after the lunch rush is also an option if line-avoidance is a priority, but only if you're not going for the clam chowder. Don't forget, you can always skip the line and get your order to go.\n\nCome with cash and an empty stomach. The servings leave nothing to be desired except extra room in the belly for more seafood goodness. I just wish they were open on Sundays!", "author": "Veronica L."}

It's either here or down near Fisherman's Wharf that you go for fresh raw seafood.  This is the no-frills option for sure.  It is charming (very old school) and quaint (tiny) but without having to focus on those details they have more energy to focus on what their customers really want - fresh delicious seafood and great service!  \n\nMy most recent trip was a post-Thanksgiving treat on \"Black Friday\" while the drones were all distracted with their shopping tasks.  HA!  Yea right.  We got there around 12pm and had to wait over an hour in line.  Yep.  So much for that logic.  FYI - bring a book or some other distraction unless you want to make small talk.  Got in finally though and took our seats at the 20-max single bar who's barstools must be the originals from when the place first opened (which you shall see when you get there).  Of course by then we were STARVING so I started with an Anchor Steam and a 4 count variety of Kumamotos.  My friend and I refused to share - going Dutch we just ordered whatever we wanted for ourselves.  By the end of it all, I'd had 22 oysters, 1 combo seafood cocktail, 1 crab cocktail and 2 beers.    Yum and OWIE at the same time.  I was fine until we were ready to leave, when suddenly I felt as if I was going to heave up every single morsel I'd eaten.  I held it down though, thankfully because at almost $70 just for my meal what a waste that would have been!\n\nBest points of Swan's are obviously the fresh seafood.  The service = great because they are so attentive to your needs empty glass or no food in front of you and they are quick to offer you more.  Once you get to a certain point in line they will even offer you a free drink of your choice.  They have wonderful house-made sauces...all you have to do is ask!  The wall shows most of the items they offer, but there are some things that are NOT on the menu that you just have to ask for:  sashimi, raw scallops, a complimentary helping of the house tartar (normally $2, so ask for the stuff while you are eating).  They also make the usual vignette but also one that has spicy chiles and is the BOMB! on oysters :)  Really the only downside is psyching yourself up to wait in that line.  I wonder why they don't just expand the place, make it two stories or something??  But then, I guess after nearly 200 years in business they have a strategy down...tease you with a window full of fresh seafood, make you drool over the lucky ones nonching away at the bar...because once you get in you are ravenous and want to go for everything!  Don't suppose it'd be that way necessarily if you could just saunter in anytime huh?  \n\nAll good things come to those who wait so, I suggest you hurry up and wait for Swans cause it is sooooo worth it~!", "author": "Stasha A."}

It's texture was more like a juice than a traditional thick clam chowder.\n\nOn a positive note, the actual clams were fresh, chewy & tasty, which is usually rare, since most places use clam chowder from the cans (don't tell the tourists at the fisherman's wharf that).   Also, they were very generous with their oyster crackers.\n\nFor what you pay for, this place is a bargain!", "author": "Sheryl S."}

Old school and just the way it's supposed to be.\n\nThe staple primo dungness crab and oysters are just the beginning.  Experiment with the smoked fish, the variations of sardine or soft shell crab.  The stuff is seasonal so the goods on ice are constantly in rotation.  If you're looking for a budget-fill-your-gut pit stop with a bunch of deep fried shit - this is not your scene.

If you want boring details I won't provide them here, plenty of other reviews have that. It's a bit pricey but it's worth it when you know they haul in the day's catch every day, and they only serve the best. I did feel a little strange as everyone around me was clearly tourists, but I yucked it up with them all the same and the guys serving are genuinely nice.\nThe clam chowder is unique. It is buttery and creamy but doesn't have the consistent milky appearance of other chowders. The buttery taste comes through along with generous bits of clam, and sopped up with great SF French Bread it's a slam dunk. I also had a crab / shrimp and bigger shrimp combo salad. Again a bit pricey at nearly $20, but you won't find fresher ingredients anywhere, so suck it up and get some while it's still in our oceans.", "author": "Matt H."}

Or you may get a heal of the bread to go along with your clam chowder. It's one of those places that's easier to order once you've been before, simply because it's unique and has it's own system. Confusing at first, I wondered if I was sleep deprived or in a foreign country... not quite understanding what was going on or how to answer questions regarding options for my meal. But I wanted to try it all and realized trial and error is the way to go! There are no mistakes when the seafood is this good.\n\nOysters on the half-shell were absolutely delicious. As was the smoked salmon. Next time I am ordering one of the seafood salads because I couldn't keep my eyes off my neighbors plate. \n\nHave you ever shucked oysters before? Well, you probably wore a glove and rightfully so! Those raw babies from the sea are hard to open and full of aquatic micro-creatures. If you cut yourself with a shucking knife it's a big deal and the consequences come with a hefty dose of regret... and painful infection! Anyone sewing you up in the Emergency Room will just shake their head at you for playing the odds.  Well, the guys at Swan shuck barehanded! They're tough and must seriously know what their doing.

For me, it was this morning.\n\nI awoke with the words, \"Swan's Oyster Depot\" on my lips and before I could force myself to take a shower, I was out the door to catch the bus.  All this would have been reasonable had I woken up in the afternoon, but who's ever had oysters at 9 in the morning?  I'll tell you who.  Everyone else already seated before I arrived at 10.  \n\nThe young men behind the bustling counter were all so charming and not at all rude.  I don't know, maybe the rude one had a day off?  Who is this rude one people complain about?  \n\nI was seated immediately.  But then I got up immediately to go to the bank because this place was CASH ONLY.  I despise places like that, and I took off 2 stars.  But when I got those oysters, they deserved 7 stars so it all works out.  \n\nThe guy who sat next to me ordered a crab louis and it certainly looked like what people said, seafood with some lettuce underneath.  The salads were between $15 and $19.  Maybe next time I'll try one of those.  Or maybe not b/c I was SO HAPPY with what I got.\n\nSix cherrystone clams and six mixed oysters later, my mind was on the moon.  The last few oysters were so creamy and delicious, the taste lingered in my mouth.  For anyone who's ever had really really good hamachi toro nigiri, you'll understand what I mean when I say it was fragrant and intoxicating.  The sensation swirled around as I inhaled, the heady sensation mixing with oxygen and tantalizing my taste buds.  \n\nBeing the informed consumer that I am, I knew better than to order the clam chowder.  But a lot of people at the counter did order it and they did slurp it down.  The gigantic bowl of oyster crackers was there in case you wanted company.  Slices of lemon in a bowl were placed every few seats.  Tabasco sauce a-plenty, salt, pepper, other garnishes were available upon request.  \n\nOne last thing.

Some will do it for the newest video game console; others, for the hottest new toy for their child this holiday season. For me - a single, child-free, non-gamer of a gal - it's food. Specifically, Swan's Oyster Depot.\n\nNestled cozily between See's Candies and Nara Sushi on Polk Street (close to California St), you may be inclined to mistake the line snaking down the street as tourists jonesing for SF's famous candy. But don't be mistaken - they're waiting for the tastiest, freshest seafood in town. And there's only one place to get it - Swan's Oyster Depot.\n\nThere's not a bad item on the menu - the smoked salmon is so fresh that you'll see one of the employees slicing it directly from the fish. Definitely try the clam chowder (not as thick as you're used to but maintains all the delicious flavor) and the Salad Louis is to die for (think mass proportions of fresh crab, shrimp and lobster. TO. DIE. FOR, I say.)\n\nThe staff - I believe it's a family-owned business - is genuinely friendly and loves to strike up energetic conversations while you're dining: never annoying, always entertaining. I highly suggest coupling your meal with an Anchor Steam (or two); if the line is especially long, you can sometimes even order a brew while waiting...seems to make it go faster.\n\nAn interesting thing to note about Swan's is that tourists seem to know it more than locals; somehow it's been kept a bit of a secret to those of us who include dining out part of our daily routine.

I am a sucker for a good oyster, so when in San Francisco, this was an obvious must-do.  We went about 30 minutes before the opened on a Monday, and even that was overkill (15 minutes might have been sufficient to get a seat in the first wave, though there was a long line by the time we left).  We obviously had a good idea what we wanted after staring at the menu while waiting for 30 minutes, but when we went to order everything, our server (is that the proper term? maybe \"seafood guide\" is better) insisted we only order one item at a time.  Works for me, as I always appreciate not feeling rushed.  We did some chowder, a spread of six different types of oysters, shrimp cocktail, and a plate of their \"Sicilian Sashimi.\"  Everything was extremely fresh, well prepared, and delicious.  I easily could have sat in that stool, as uncomfortable as it was, for the next 6 hours drinking Anchor Steam on tap and pounding oyster after oyster, but alas, the real world was calling.

We LOVE raw scallops and usually, when fresh, they melt like butter in your mouth. We had to squeeze a bunch of lemon and even splashed some mignonette on them. \n- Recycling condiments--WOW! What if we had double-dipped? What if the people who used those before us double-dipped? If SF had a law that would require food establishments to post their letter rating (like they do in LA), I'm pretty sure this place would not be higher than a C. I get that it's supposed to be rugged, and etc., but you know, sanitation and cleanliness, especially when serving seafood, kind of important. \n- The vibe from the staff...I don't know. I mean, they love to talk, but not really friendly or warm. Does that make sense?\n\nIn sum, I really wish I had better things to say about this place, it being an old San Francisco standard and all, but I just don't. Sorry, SOD, but we won't be coming back.", "author": "Ali A."}

We were told the type of oyster it was and what kind of taste we might expect. \n\nAs we waited for our order to be filled, we watched one of the staff fillet a smoked salmon for another customer as he chatted with my hubby. He even offered him a taste. The staff is super friendly and will offer suggestions if you can't decide. \n\nThere are a variety of condiments to choose from that you can add to your seafood adventure. The cocktail sauce is without horseradish, but it's available and you can add as little or as much you want for that spicy kick. \n\nWe ended up dropping around $60 for the both of us for food, drinks, and tip.

As a big Seinfeld fan, I always thought of the well-known Soup Nazi episode, and when I realized this was a seafood place everyone was cramming to get into, I was excited to try it out!\n\nThis place did not disappoint me at all. I went 3 times, both with one other person, and we had a long wait, but when you get close to the door, waiters come outside and start serving you beer before you're even seated! \n\nThe second someone leaves you have to kind of hurry to the seat because, if you're like me, you feel a lot of pressure from holding up the big line behind you. Depending on what you get, the food is either amazing or so-so, and the cleanliness...it just seems \"OK\"- but I choose to trust it because the food tastes so good. \n\nThere's something kind of gross about the idea of seafood to me, in general, (a lot of it is stinky and squishy, maybe, and you see all the dead fish lying there on ice in the front window?) so I think when I stepped through the doorway I think I made the subconscious decision to not be a clean freak and enjoy my fish.\n\nSo I would give:\n-Five stars to the oysters...amazing, fresh, lemony and perfect!\n-Three and a half to the clam chowder...I would have some of this as \"filler\" maybe, so I don't break my bank on oysters. Nothing special to merit waiting in line just for the chowder, though.\n-Four stars for the shrimp / crab cocktail. You have to make your own cocktail sauce - you are given ketchup and have to add horseradish, lemon, etc. - this could be a plus for some people who like it to-taste, but I would have rather had some better cocktail sauce.

You pretty much get what you see.\nWe tried Blue Point and Miyagi oysters and Cherrystone clams. For sure this is some fresh stuff.. no fishiness at all, although there was a little sand. The miyagis are local, so they were a little brine-y and tasted like the ocean. Pretty crazy.\nI wish they had cocktail sauce to go with their stuff (they only have ketchup), but what made up for it was their special sauces of horseradish and another pepper sauce. Make sure to try all of it out.\nWe also all split a bowl of clam chowder, which was good and flavorful. It was thin and brothy, but I prefer restaurants not pouring tons of flour into it.\nThere was a giant slab of smoked salmon in front of us that I was drooling over, but I didn't get a sample like some people said!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-25", "description": "GOD I Love this freakin' place! Read to the bottom for a few secrets to maximizing your enjoyment at Swan.\n\nI've been going for almost 20 years now and the quality has not dropped a notch.  The only downside are the lines, which have gotten worse over the years, presumably due to inclusion in travel guides and the like. There are certainly a lot more tourists there than in the old days, and while part of me is annoyed by this, another part is heartened that there are folks coming to SF and eating here rather than at \"The Wharf.\"\n\nAnyway, Swan is everything fresh seafood should be. If you have quality fish, the best thing to do is to do as little as possible, and this they do.\n\nThe wild thing is that each and every item, from the fish to the oyster crackers are the best of their kind (possible exception the lemons which are just normal.)\n\nSo here is my standard meal, which I vary from it once or twice a year and get a mixed smoked platter:\n\nCup (not bowl) of white chowder.  This is BY FAR the best chowder I've ever had.  It is relatively thin - not thick and gloppy.  The broth is perfectly savory with great mouthfeel and bitesized pieces of clam.\n\nA few folks have criticized the chowder as being too \"thin\" or watery.  With all due respect, these people must be used to Cambell's Chunky or something. Clam chowder should not look like library paste.  In fact, it is the relative thinness that makes the chowder here so sublime.  It is principally a fish broth, with a bit of fresh cream and butter, along with the usual clams, potatoes, etc.  Yeah, you could add corn starch and your spoon would stand up, but whats the point.  All rigth thinking people know that this is what chowder should be.  There, I said it.\n\nOyster crackers tossed into the chowder.  Can oyster crackers be good or bad? Why yes!  These are super fresh, crunchy, and add the touch of salt the chowder needs.\n\nA small Anchor Steam.  Even if you eat early, as I suggest below, get an Anchor.  It is fresh from the keg, and a San Francisco original. Remember, beer is food.\n\nAn order of sourdough bread.  You have to order and pay for bread here (butter pats are free) which is as it should be.  Why eat crappy bread for free when you can have really great sourdough (which I don't normally like as its such an overdone cliche.)\n\nA mixed seafood cocktail, sauce on the side.  This is the cocktail, no the salad.  A perfect combo of baby and large shrimp, some dungenesse, and usually a nice oyster or two.\n\nThe cocktail sauce gets its own note.  Its just great.  Sometimes I add a squeeze of lime, and I always add some fresh horseradish.  By ordreing on the side I dip the seafood, rather than have it bathe in the sauce.  A point of personal preference, but the way to go, imo.\n\nSpeaking of the horseradish, it is super fresh and super hot.  Use sparingly, but use!  They sell it by the bottle if you want, and you shoudl want.  I always have some around at home.\n\nSo thats it, Quite simply, some of the best, simple seafood you will ever eat.\n\nNow the tips. I already told you to get a glass of Anchor.  I know it can seem wierd to drink a glass of beer (thus I get the small) at 10:30 am, but it is perfect with the food.  If you want something harder, they sell (under the counter - no liquor license) aged tequila.  So go for a shot if you feel like it.\n\nThe big thing, to avoid the crowds and get the best food, is go early.  By 11:15 there is ususally a line out the door.  Go VERY early, and call it breakfast. I usually go around 10AM and can get seated immediately.  Its also a bit less crazy and everything is fresher.", "author": "hOWARD y."}

We strolled down to Swan around 4;15 pm (the place closes at 5:30) and we got in line, within 5 minutes one of the servers came out with a piece of paper on it that said \"Last One\" and gave it top the group behind us, he asked them to tell anyone who tried to get in line that they were the last ones. (GET THERE EARLY) in return he hooked em up with some beers. the attitude of the server was was very much like your one of the family, no big deal, ill bring you out a couple beers asap. So just be prepared Swan is run by a family, and these guys make you feel like one of their family before you walk in the door. \n\nWe finally got in after about an hour fifteen minute wait and sat down at the counter.

The oysters were shucked perfectly, no grit or shells bits in the oyster and very very fresh. I loved the clam chowder not too thick with a nice balance of clam meat and potato's ( my buddy said he wished it was thicker so....) , the Crab cocktail was delicious... honestly some of the best crab i have ever had cooked to perfection nice and moist beautiful chunks of crab. Bottom line, everything was fresh and delicious! Next time I go I'm going to get a dozen oysters, a cup of chowder and the crab salad because it will be more filling than the cocktail. \n\nA couple notes on this place: from what i was told by one of the guys working there, this place is first an foremost a seafood butcher. They are not a restaurant, you will not find white table cloths, napkins, a waiter etc. you will find a long counter with about 20 stools, you will sit elbow to elbow, you will place your order and you will be spoiled. These guys aren't going to sit and fill your glass unless they see it, they have pickup orders to fill you need more drink ask for it don't expect someone to refill you cup every second its half full.

We got there at 2 on Saturday - there was a line of 8 or so....got the clam chowder (it was a little watery), combo seafood salad, and a sampling of all the oysters (there isn't an official oyster sampler - they just put together whatever you want.

This place gets packed but luckily my friend and I only waited 15 minutes for a seat.  The seafood is NO DOUBT the freshest but this rating loses my 2 extra stars I would've given it if the clam chowder met my expectations.  Sadly it did not.  So sad to say but Boudin and Sizzler clam chowder still win my heart.  This chowder was thin and oily looking....I even found a caper in it, I've never had capers in mine but the 1 caper didn't make a difference but still...1 caper, that was just weird!  A friend and I shared a dozen oysters--6 miyagis and 6 blue points.  I was indeed disappointed by the size of the miyagis because my friend was saying that they were suppose to be a lot bigger than what was shucked onto the ice.  Eh...the oysters were deeeelicious and super fresh so size at that point did not even matter.  This place is pretty pricey for a hole in the wall looking joint.  The salads on the menu were like $17 and up!  Yikes...!  My 3 stars will not stop me from going back every once in a blue moon so I will keep this place on my list.

Somehow I was lucky enough to talk him into it today.  We were both virgins.... and Michael our server was amazing. He was super friendly... smiling the entire time, giving us his advice which was incredible...  Emily, a local regular who was in line with us also gave us tips on what to order.  Yes there is a line because they to do not take reservations, but if you enjoy fresh fish, it is so worth the wait.  And it's not your typical sit-down-table type of restaurant.... which is what makes it so different and appealing at the same time.  It has one long bar that probably seats 12 or more people... not sure exactly how many, but it is small... thus the long wait out the door.  Swan Oyster Depot is only open for lunch and is very casual... not fancy at all.  Perfect... because I was wearing my baseball hat, yoga-Marina-gear... and was so craving Crabs since they are now in season.\nWe had the clam chowder... which is totally different from what one would expect... still very good.  Sashimi... scallops, salmon, halibut, and ahi tuna... that literally melted in your mouth. Crab Louie (not sure if I'm spelling that right) and the dozen oysters were also delicious. \nI have to say the food was great, but the service is phenomenal... Michael catered to us like our own personal seafood chef.

We also ate in, which was when we realized we could have ordered ahead for carry out. Having stood in line for nearly 2 hrs tho we wanted to sit and eat there. It's tightly packed in there too, shoulder to shoulder seating. We ordered half dozen west coast oysters, half cracked crab, and smoked salmon. Love raw oysters, but I gotta say East coast oysters are better. These oysters were extremely salty, or very grassy tasting. Great to pair with a summer beer or Sauvignon blanc. The crab was ok, but for the price I'd expect more. The smoked salmon was the best I have ever had (I was practically raised on it). Smelled and tasted like smokey woodchips. Delicious! $20 for four slices on extremely thin toast though? Especially since they don't smoke it themselves? Way overpriced.

When I die, I want to stop here first.\n\nAfter weekday Mass at Grace Cathedral, I asked the canon, \"Where would local people go for lunch around the hill?\" She immediately told me about Swan Oyster Depot.\n\nI didn't mind a little line, as the place was indeed from a by-gone era and you could see the fresh fish in the front window. The place was started in the 20s by a Dane and then puchased in the 40s by an Italian, whose grandson helped me figure out what to order. Not sure? \"Why don't I fix you a little tasting plate of...\" So I got two different oysters, a plate of smoked trout and two kinds of smoked salmon and half a crab. (You could tell the regulars love the clam chowder--it's just not my thing.)\n\nWhile he fixed my plates (as his brothers and cousins and father and uncles worked with him), I was offered a generous hunk of peasant bread, sliced, to enjoy with butter. Most of the lunch crowd enjoyed a glass of wine or a beer. \n\nMy West coast oysters were better than any I've ever tasted. Of my trout and salmon, I liked best the \"hot-smoked\" salmon but all was good. The crab was perfect--succulent and tasting like crab should when it's fresh.\n\nI ate every bite and my only regret is that I couldn't go again. Indeed, my next trip to SF will be planned to allow for as many lunches at Swan as possible.\n\nOther diners got the crab or combination salad. Yes, it's on iceberg, which is part of the charm--none of that mod cuisine with 10 kinds of baby lettuces that taste like dirt--and you have to ask for the house dressing--a sublime concoction of olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, Dijon, horseradish and salt and pepper. I asked the young lady next to me for a taste on a piece of bread and I wish I had ordered some for my crab--gilding the lily, not out of necessity. They also had a Louis dressing that looked good if you like a heavier accompaniment.\n\nI'm pretty picky and there's not a thing I'd change about this place!

After reading other reviews we got there early on a Friday (around 10:30am) and were lucky enough to snag two open spots along the bar. The place was small but full of charm and you could tell from the employee/patron interaction that many of those dining in were regulars. Upon sitting down I ordered us waters and the shrimp cocktail since that is my boyfriend's favorite. We watched them prepare it in front of us and a few minutes later were enjoying the freshest shrimp I have ever had. After the shrimp I informed the guy helping us that we were first timers so would need a little direction. He told me to try a cup of the chowder, a 1/2 dozen of mixed oysters, a full helping of smoked salmon and if we were still hungry to get either the crab cocktail or calamari salad. Feeling adventurous we took his advice and were not disappointed. I am not a huge oyster person but whatever variations he gave us were wonderful. The texture was just right and they did not have the usual \"fishy\" taste that you can get with shellfish.  The salmon had the best flavor and they gave us a very hearty portion - it will be hard to order in back home now! As good as everything was my absolute favorite was the crab cocktail. It came with a creamy Louie sauce and was so tender. I was already stuffed beyond belief from the rest of the meal but could not seem to stop myself from polishing the bowl off.

A local favorite for a reason, but it didn't blow my socks off and I have no real desire to return. \nPeople LOVE this place, and as a lover of raw fresh seafood I thought I was going to hit the jackpot here after hearing so much about it. My husband and I waited an hour plus to get in, which wasn't the issue- we expected the wait. We eagerly waited in line with returning patrons espousing praise of SOD. We ordered 1 bowl of NE clam chowder, 2 crab Louie salads, 1 dozen raw oyster variety, and each had a beer for a tip & tax total of $100 (only accepts cash). The staff is friendly & attentive, but I sat on a wobbly uncomfortable stool a foot taller than my neighbors making it awkward- plus I couldn't put my legs under the bar because of the height (sitting on the floor would have nicer and probably cleaner than the dirty bar countertop). Anyway, about the reason of our visit- the food. The chowder was very good- any higher praise neglects noticing the scant amount of clams and heavy hand of salt of this rendition of New England chowder. I did not mind the watery milk base (like canned Snow's Chowder) because it still had a pleasant clam taste. But let's face it people- this chowder is NOT winning any awards. The oysters were properly shucked and served, and were fresh and satisfying- the better part of our meal but still not extraordinary. The crab on the crab Louie was fresh and portions generous. But the shredded iceberg was a total bore- just order the crab cocktail for half the price with a side of Louie sauce for dipping. All in all not a total waste, but not memorable.

Only reason for 4 stars was due to the fact that they shuck them in front of you, the shells arent cleaned to the extent that you would find at a high scale restaurant, definitely had bits of shell in my mouth...I just chalked it up as part of the experience.

I ate well, and enjoyed it very much. The service is not good for the price of the food, it is cramped, and there is a line usually, and only go there if you don't take being ignored or told in response to my loud \"I want to pay my bill and leave\" after quietly and politely asking three times, \"I'm busy, someone will be with you when they aren't busy\"\n\nThe guys that work here are authentic, but kind of jerks from the perspective of an urban professional. The guys are not particularly clean hand washing and handling different people's food and dirty dishes, etc.  While I give it four stars for fresh seafood without pretentious preparation, I really don't think I would go back here in light of the cleanliness issue and attitude of the guys who work here.

There is a line becasue they do not take reservations. There is a line out the door because the same folks have owned it for so many years and the spot is long and very narrow. Jackets on the wall, purses on your lap ladies.. folks need room to get by you to get to the bathroom, Way in the back. It's a bar style seating so the guys are all in front of you the whole time, easy to get around and quick. People know to kind of eat fast, the service is fast, these guys have the routine down because they have such a following.. So the crab goes first, if you are there after 1 then don't count on getting yourself any crab or the combo plater: tiger prawns, shrimp and crab.. But the prawns and shrimp louie is good too! The clam chowder is where you start, nice little cup with a glass of white wine: $7, all the glasses are $7.. (it's easy.. simple men, it works). Then you go to the oysters, if you feel good about it and don't kow much about oysters, let the guys pick them for you or just get the... yes, the combo plate..because it's easy.\nFinish with a louie.. some sort of louie. They do the louie salad dressing and they also let you have the vinegar dressing instead if you'd rather. Their vinegar is so yummy and tangy, they make it there.. and there are post its all over the jugs reading \"don't touch\", simple.. to the point. I love this place.

Read ALL the reviews and they all said to get there early b/c there will be a wait. Went on a Saturday morning arrived at 11am they open at 10am and there was already a line down the sidewalk.  Got seated at around 2pm!! I didn't give up--and neither did anyone else in the line--everyone patiently waited.  Once you get closer to the door they start taking your drink orders--which I think is a fantastic idea!  Makes you feel like you are almost there, and you are invested at this point, no turning back.  The place itself only holds about 20 seats.  Once we were seated we were greeted and welcomed in by a couple members of the staff.  We decided to start out with a cup of clam chowder-- it was a bit cold outside so this was a pefect starter to warm up-- It was good!  It wasn't heavy and not greasy or oily at all (like some homemade clam chowders can be), and it had a good amount of clams in it.  Next I decided to order the Seafood Salad.  This was the best Seafood Salad I have ever had.  Huge amounts of Seafood on this salad--I shared with my friend.  She ordered the Crab Coctail which was wonderful too!  We then decided that we were at Swan Oyster Depot --we needed to get some oysters!  So we got 1/2 dozen oysters which were great--nothing was bad at this place other than the wait--and even that wasn't bad because everyone in line were fun, had some good conversations and it made the time fly by.  When you are inside you might feel a bit rushed-b/c you know people are standing outside waiting for you to hurry up so they can have their turn--but the guys working there were very nice and patient--didn't try to rush you--and in fact told us to relax, take all the time you want, and enjoy yourself--   I am really glad I tried this place the seafood is super fresh and good, and doesn't smell like a fish market in there!   If you are in town check this place out!  They only accept cash so bring a lot of it--b/c you will be hungry from waiting in line!", "author": "T J."}

I finally decided to try out Swan's based on much prodding by a friend, M, she may be their biggest fan. We decided to go for a late lunch/early dinner so we got there about a quarter to 5pm on a Saturday. Ten minutes after we got in line, they handed the \"end of line\" sign to the guy behind us. But we made it and that's all that mattered --- I was really hungry.\n\nPer M's suggestion, we went for a bowl of chowder and the seafood combination plate. There are 2 combo plates and we got the salad-variety. The chowder almost made me swoon on my bar-stool; I haven't had chowder that good since like a stupid amount of time. It was beautiful; the soup was delicate but so flavorful, I really wish I'd gotten some to go. Soon the combo salad arrived. It was generous amounts of crab, bay shrimp and large prawns spread throughout a bed of chopped lettuce, topped with sauce Louie. I didn't think I'd ever finish that salad. It was bigger than I'd realized. And the guys working behind the scenes are real gems. They were good-natured and gave us good customer service. A friendly, seemingly loyal crowd seated at the counter packed the place. Be ready to stand in line if you are eating on the premises (there's not a lot of seating) or just step up to the counter, just inside the door, in to order to order take-out.\n\nSo I'm a fan of Swan Oyster Depot, excited to head back and try something new.", "author": "Jen A."}

Also they have a crab salad which I love. It is really just a bed of shredded iceberg and at least a pound of fresh shucked crab with thousand island over it. It is $18. This is a good deal. Crab is expensive. If you take yourself to the Wharf (though I never recommend this) for a crab Louie you will pay $38 and there will not be nearly as much crab and you might accidentally fill up on all the other crap they put in that salad. \nI try to avoid the long ass lines by going at odd times on weekdays. I especially like to go around 4:30 right before they close and just pop in and get a couple beers and some oysters and chat with the guys while they clean up. \nSwans is the perfect antidote to Sears.", "author": "Melissa H."}

The place has character and charm as you enter the long, narrow shotgun style, family-owned establishment- the great history and tradition becomes apparent. The dark stained wood bar table and 16 stools run the length of this divey seafood gem! The food is amazing and everything is as fresh as it gets- the oysters will not disappoint you, the clam chowder is great to get you started, smoked salmon is prepared in house and is a must try- served on rye bread!  Other favorites include the cracked crab, shrimp cocktail, the salads are great and of course this is a fine place to get your lobstah craving taken care of!  Two thumbs up!", "author": "Akash D."}

I read about this place in the Continental Airlines magazine (I know, I know... tres chic, right?)  on my way to SF today, stumbled out of SFO and made a beeline to Swan Oyster. There was no line (weekday at 2pm), sat at one of the few seats at the bar, and then sequentially inhaled oyster crackers, sourdough bread, outrageous clam chowder, amazing raw oysters and clams and a smoked salmon plate. (Okay, I can't take all the credit, I did have a little help.) The service at this family run establishment is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is perfectly relaxing after a 6 hour cross country flight. So many places with a raw bar have attitude to match, and this tiny gem is truly an exception. I NEED a Swan Oyster  Depot in NYC.... PLEASE!

I guess best to come with someone so that either one of you can run to near by store grab something while wait, because if you come here hungry, by the time you are ready to be seated, you probably already pass the stage of starvation.\nAnyhow, not big fan of raw seafood, I had crab Salad - 18$, I didn't get their Louie dressing, I asked them to mix some olive oil, vinegar and mustard as the sauce, which came out superb on salad.  I got a generous amount of crab, fresh, very fresh, along with my Stellar, I was pretty happy.\nMy friend ordered a dozen of clams, I tried one.  I didn't know how to eat raw shelled live animals, i slurped the poor thing in my mouth, didn't know what to do with it, should i bite onto it or should i swallow it?

We shared a combination seafood salad, and since they had unfortunately run out of crab for the day minutes before we sat down (some storm caused a shortage that week) they added smoked salmon and trout to our salad. It was heavenly.\n\nBut the best part about this place are the people. My roommate and I must have met two-thirds of the staff, shaken their hands, and gotten asked about our lives about five times each. These gentlemen constantly checked to make sure everything tasted great, brought over capers and onions for our salad, and topped off our Bloody Beers (a delicious creation!) when they noticed them dwindling.\n\nI will be patronizing this place as long as I live in San Francisco, and recommend it to anyone who wants to have an amazing experience!", "author": "Casey M."}

So we arranged to go the next morning despite a late evening out.  Bright and early Sunday morning we treked over to Swan Oyster Depot.  Much to my dismay, we discovered it was closed!  I've never felt such traumatic disappointment in my life.  It's been a long road to recovery, but finally I've had another opportunity to satisfy my craving for those delicious mollusks.  Suffice it to say that the wait was worth it.  We managed to beat the lunch rush and were seated promptly at the last few stools at the end.  The seats weren't terribly comfortable, but I wasn't there to get comfortable.  I was there for some good, fresh seafood and fresh seafood was what I got.  \n\nFirst we started with a couple of cups of clam chowder.  The chowder was a little looser than most of the chowders that I've had, but the flavor was very nice and there were some decent chunks of clam.  Next we tried a sample platter of oysters featuring some kumamotos, virginicas, some blue points, and a few others whose names escape me.  All of them were excellent either alone, with mignonette, or just a little lemon and tabasco.  Next we tried some little neck and cherrystone clams.  I've never tried raw clams, and while I still prefer oysters, they weren't bad and the cherrystones had a pleasant flavor to them.  Next we followed that up with another couple dozen oysters.  While we waited for the oysters, I couldn't help but order some smoked salmon as it teased me in my periph.  I was not disappointed with that either.  The salmon was perfectly smoked, not too strong and still with good texture.  \n\nSince the SOD is so small, the service was excellent as every party had their own server to themselves.  Our oyster guy was super friendly and helpful in explaning the different types of oysters and in taking our orders.  It was a little more expensive than I would have expected, but worth the occasion every once in a while.", "author": "Gary L."}

It's not too creamy or butter-y or flour-y... it's not too anything because it's perfect. It tastes like it was made with fresh clam and fish stock (it probably was)... and it's not too thick or thin either. It's got a great mouthful of flavor and seasoned just right. Dip their tough, chewy, sour sourdough in it and thank the stars that you live in San Francisco. I also ordered their combination salad and it's worth every penny. While standing in line, I watched the gentlemen behind the counter build plate after plate of these - each adding the shrimp, prawns, and crab in their own artistic way. They seriously pile on the seafood and the crab is soo fresh and the prawns are huge and \"crispy.\" Mmm... and the cocktail sauce was the best cocktail sauce I've ever had. The bf ordered 3 different kinds of miyagi oysters and they were shucked fresh right before our eyes (his favorite was the huge, sweet Steamboats). \n\nATMOSPHERE: I love, heart, adore places that look like the Swan Oyster Depot - even though decades have past, nothing's really changed and nothing big probably will.

It probably would be less desirable; it would be shellfish was no longer cool.  Luckily shellfish is still in.  The Depot has what seems to be bounteous supply of crab, shrimp, oysters and other curiosities.  I am delighted when they have a gorgeous lobster tail; actually it is not a tail it should be called lobster belly (sounds better than lobster abdomen).  Come here for super fresh seafood; served most often as a salad or cocktail.  Order the combination salad (shrimp and crab); never mind it is Iceberg lettuce; I don't eat it either.   The crab is sweet, it is chunky; quite simply it is ambrosia.  The shrimp are fresh; just recently acquired from the ocean; the crunch is re-assuring of freshness and a delicate sweetness.  You wish the shrimp were steak size.  Order your salad dressing on the side; if not it will be drenching your iceberg and shellfish; and God forbid it will add to your waistlne (and In San Francisco that could ruin your social life).  Don't come here for a lengthy wine list or comfortable seating; prepare to not look at your dining partner as it is all counter service.\n\n If I did not have knees I might be more comfortable; prepare yourself for maximal discomfort.   I guess when the Depot opened up nearly a century ago that no one had knees and perhaps shrunken legs.  There is almost no where to put yourself.  You might be sitting in the strangers lap left or right of you.  I like my fellow dinners who ask if I can move (I laugh a little louder when I am a foot and half away from the counter and there is no where for me to go).  Ahh those San Franciscans are funny people.  \n\nIf you go by yourself (or even if you go with several people -- chances are your group will be broken up) be prepared to let your server know that the person who arrived at the same time you did is not your boyfriend or girlfriend--(I think I had a cute boyfriend next to me for about 45 minutes) a diplomatic way of letting your server know would be to ask for your own supply of sourdough.  \n\nI read another review and it mentioned that some of the seafood was frozen?  I hardly believe anything I had or was being served was ever frozen.  Frozen (or fish once known as frozen) is flavorless and often tough.  I am not sure where they were eating.  I am fascinated to see the servers readying a crab or thinly slicing smoked salmon.  Seafood is one of my favorite things to eat.  Swan Oyster Depot makes me think why are there more of these types of eateries in San Francisco?  \n\nI like the service; I know many people do not.  I think the service is minimal yet pleasant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-05", "description": "It's interesting that not one reviewer has been very specific about the wonder and beauty that is Swan's. So here goes:\n\n1. This is an S.F. place of worship. It's been there forever, in the same place, with the same damned piece of marble, and same family-ownership for nearly 100 years. \n2. Service is wonderful -- what an eclectic and interesting group of devoted shuckers and cocktail makers. The owner (son or grandson of the original owner) is a gem. Engage them in conversation, they tell stories or at the very least will chitchat about all kinds of things. \n3. Seafood is A+ topnotch fresh and tasty, and they do not skimp on the seafood for the salads and cocktails.\n4. They'll mix you \"special sauces\" if you ask; mignonette, dijon mustard, etc. Just ask! The servers have their own inventions, too!\n5. Ask for the goodies! Swans gives out little dehydrated sponges, refrigerator magnets and other tchotckies that you can take home and use or give to your friends back home (if you're a tourist).\n6. Don't got during \"rush\" times; i.e. any time that it be near lunchtime. Don't go between 11:30 and 2:00.  They do close at 5, so time yourself. You might have to wait in line anyway. It's worth it. \n7. This is the single most uncomfortable seating arrangement EVER. Tiny chairs and stools are crammed against a very small bar. So don't get all excited about bringing a crowd. Take yourself and maybe 1 or 2 others. Dress down and comfy. Sometimes it's cold inside so be prepared.  Don't be surprised that you'll be butting elbows (and butts and shoulders) with the person next to you. That's just the way it is and it's worth it. \n8. You put up with it b/c it's Swan's and for $15.00 or so you get the biggest Louie salad loaded with your choice of seafood. No other place else offers a louie this substantial and at this quality for this price. \n9. Do order the clam chowder. It's a soup, it's stew, it's a meal. It's damned good. \n9a. Try the smoked salmon/fish plate, worth every dollar. \n10. Don't miss the shellfish cocktail, you can mix in horseradish, lemon... anything else you want. They have all kinds of additions. You can customize your dressing to suit your tastes.\n11. Ditto on the Louie salads; afraid of Louie dressing??? They'll make you up any kind of dressing you want -- or one they've made up. Oh, I said that before, didn't I???\n12. Last and probably least is that they have an interesting collection of rubber duckies which they will happily let you play with.", "author": "Heather W."}

C'mon, guys, there's only 3 bullet points there!!!  Even 2 out of 3 shouldn't cut it!!! It should have been easy to name just one restaurant that can offer these 3 things (and offer them all consistently)!  But, alas, in the real world, we all know that there are certain places we go to when we want great-tasting food, but we have to go a different restaurant when we want to pay for cheaper version of it just to hold us over. Then we end up looking for an occassion that passes as a good enough excuse to go all out and finallly get to that finer diner for that tastier, alberit more expensive, version of that same cut of fish. So, so sad... \n\nWell, my friends, let me tell you something.  If you go to Swan, you will consistently hit these 3 points every single time.  You will not have to give up knowledgable staff for a better tasting shrimp cocktail.  You will not have to pay extra for another slice of smoked salmon (just ask for a taste while they're cutting one up for someone else!).  And you will not have to sacrifice flavor for friendlier service!  Too good to be true?  Only one way to find out, right?\n\nWhat else can I say about this place.  The line out the door speaks for itself.  People may say the only reason there's such a line outside is because there's only 15 seats inside.  Butt c'mon... if you've ever sat in there and wondered why they don't just knock down See's Candy next door and put in 60 seats, you'd quickly realize that you're very lucky to be sitting in there. Passersby gawk with envy as you induldge in a combination seafood salad overstuffed with shrimp and crab meat.  You glance to your left and someone is having a cold, crisp beer over a plate of a dozen (+ a half, maybe?), fresh, assorted oysters.  And to your right, I'm sitting right there smiling over a perfectly smoked salmon and bread combo with extra capers. After awhile you realize that no matter how many seats they put inside, there will always be a line outside. Because it is that dayum good. \n\nSo you say you need another example of how good Swan Oyster really is, eh?  Okay, well, have you ever been somewhere like- let's say- Chicago and had an authentic deep dish pizza?  Then you come home and order one from Domino's or whatever and you realize that Chicago just ruined pizza for you- for the rest of your life?  Because it was just that dayum good, right? Nothing will ever compare, right?  You wanna make another trip out there as soon as possible to get that perfect taste/experience back, right?  Well, that's what Swan did to me in regards to smoked salmon.  I used to get it every Friday morning at this deli just 2mins away from my house but after having it at Swan, I can't eat it anywhere else anymore.  Sure I get cravings and I drive by the place daily but now I shake my head and keep on the gas... because Swan is just that dayum good.  So if you want your current standards for seafood, service, and pricing to be forever ruined for you (in a good way, of course), then you gotta try this place.

So we wen't around the corner to Swan since it was before noon on a weekday they were wide open for seating which is rare.  We had Clam Chowder and a half cracked crab, The crab was hours old maybe and tasted fabulous, they provide any condiment you could ever want from Loui dressing to lemons, to horseradish what have you.  The Boston Clam Chowder was tasty and very traditional, not thick like the west coast version of New England Clam Chowder.  The soup seemed to have less fresh clams than the Boston counterpart, but all the seafood in this place is completely fresh and all the people behind the counter are like a throwback to another era.  Just watching the knife skills of these guys as they thinly slice smoked salmon or fillet tiny sand dabs this place oozes seafood and freshness.  We had to buy some fresh Bay Shrimp on our way out to take home because you simply won't find fresher fish anywhere in the country than their front window.  It's not cheap, and it can be extremely crowded at times, it isn't fancy, it's very small, but if you want to be transported back in time to a true fresh fish counter with fast and friendly service this is the place for you.

I've heard about this joint for years, and love all things oyster/seafood related, so I was really excited to go.  The wait was lame because I am impatient, but they let us drink while we waited in line, in the middle of the day, so I was ok with the wait, even in the rain.  Loved the chowdah and oysters.  I love the guys behind the counter too.  If I had to work a crowd like that all day, I would be pissy and mean, and would probably sabotage the bill or whatever, but they were so nice.  I have developed a small crush on all of them.", "author": "Shannon H."}

So far I only found 2 places serving raw clams in San Francisco.  If anyone knows other places, please do send me a message so I can go try them out.\n\nEvery time I go there (even if I go alone), a dozen clams is a must, and then maybe a half to one dozen of oysters depending on who I'm going with.  $8 for half dozen and you can mix and match however you want, it's a total steal.\n\nTheir other seafood items are all very good, and their pink sauce adds a nice touch to the seafood.  I like that sauce way better than the cocktail sauce.\n\nKeep in mind that even though they close at 5:30pm, try to go before 5pm because they may run out on the popular items.  That happened to me once.  I was told that I could have called ahead to reserve some clams next time though.", "author": "E H."}

They prepped the food right in front of us.  We sat inches from the smoked salmon.  It was too cute!  I didn't dig the bowl of oyster crackers though.  Reminded me of a bar where a lot of hands must've dug into.  \n\nI ordered the combo salad and my husband had the clam chowder.  They had *just* ran out of crab and it was only 12:20pm on a Monday afternoon.  Our server offered me smoked salmon and whitefish instead.  The amount of those were a bit skimpy.  The salmon was good but not special.  The whitefish was different and tasty but also nothing special.  The Louie dressing was also average.\n\nThe chowder was tasty but I do prefer it thicker.  My husband liked it a lot though.  He thought it tasted really yummy with the bread.  If you let it sit a bit, you can watch the cream separate which is a little creepy *shiver*.\n\nOverall, I really wanted to like it.  I will try it again but since I'm not a raw oyster person, I don't know how much better it will be for me.  It's a neat place though!!", "author": "Angie C."}

Yes, the novelty of sitting in a traditional setting was enjoyable for a \"been there, done that\" checklist. But seriously, why would anyone pay this much money to wait for 45 minutes for food that is not even gourmet? If you're going to charge this much for food, the seating should be comfortable (you shouldn't have to balance your ass on a stool with your belongings on your lap), the ambiance should be warm and cozy (I love the whole Manhattan-deli feel, but I don't want to pay $50 for it), there should be a chef concocting unusual sauces and side dishes (not a cocktail sauce that's 95% ketchup and a salad of iceberg lettuce) and you should be able to make a reservation.

I ordered a to-go clam chowder, which turned out to be curdled milk with a half inch skim of oil on the top and minute pieces of potato and clam. I took one small sip and realized it was as disgusting as it looked, the absolute worst chowder I have ever seen, so clearly poorly made and tasteless it was surprising coming from a seafood place. I went to return it for my money back and was told by some guy named Tom that he couldn't refund my money because \"California law doesn't allow it.\" When I countered that I hadn't eaten it all and didn't want a freebee, he proceeded to argue that I was wrong about the quality and that customers aren't right.

The soup itself was broken (the fat/cream seperates from the broth), but the flavors were still right on.

Last week we did. Don't be too put off by the line because if you can spare 25 minutes on a weekend, you'll get to experiance what the hoopla is all about. There are perhaps 20 or so chairs at a counter - that's it.  My wife and I had a dozen oysters and I had the Crab Louie and she had the Shrimp Louie. No problem...we also feasted on the sour dough bread and Anchor Steam Beer. The counter folks were friendly and the clam chowder was also superb. We were loving it.\n\nThere was a problem though. Most folks miss it as nobody has mentioned it in any of the rave reviews. The guys behind the counter grab the fish, shrimp, scallops, crab meat..out of the display in the front window and either wrap it up for to go orders or to serrve it to the hungry people that line the counter - with their bare hands.  These same hands also take the money.  Sit there some time and you'll see.  They never use gloves and didn't wash between each serving.  They handle the fish and  then they handle the cash, then they serve the fish. This might have not been a problem when the Italian immigrant family that opened Swan and still operate it - first started many years ago, but today this is simply unacceptable.  On the way out my wife had to wait to use the one restroom that they had there.  After 5 minutes one of the counter people came out and was obviosly in there smoking.  If the owners of Swan are reading this you know what I'm talking about.  You're lucky we didn't call the Health Dept!  \n\nSkip this place.", "author": "Nick C."}

You know when one reviewer sees everyone else giving a place a 5 star review you tend to give the same high score review in order to align with the other reviewers? I was probably expecting too much after I've seen all the great reviews of this place I said to myself I have to try this place during my 4 days vacation in San Francisco. Well now that I've tried it I can tell you don't believe everything you read in those 5 star reviews and instead look at the 3 stars and below reviews. First of all parking is non existing as with every other places in San Francisco. You'll have to find street parking around and expect to feed a lot of quarters to the meter as the line waiting to get in is LONG. Don't believe some of reviewers that say the line moves quick during lunch! I spent like 40 stupid minutes waiting to sit 3 of us. Now let's talk about the food....people seem to suggest the combination salad, oysters, and chowder so that's what I ordered. The salad is expensive for what you get and the chowder like many reviewers say they're watery. The half dozen oysters I ordered was not even worth it. The guy served me 3 different kinds of oysters (2 each) and supposedly they were from different parts so some are much smaller than the normal rare oysters you get at other places. So instead of getting 6 large oysters I got 2 large oysters and the rest were all small and tiny. I don't know how oysters are valued but I bet the small oysters cost a lot less compared to the big ones. At the end my total came to about $37 and other than the old San Francisco atmosphere of the store the food was not special and they were actually expensive for what you get. I think this place is a tourist trap and once is enough for me.", "author": "Wayne T."}

The oysters were great, clam chowder is amazing also. I docked a star because of the service that was provided to me and my friend the second time I visited Swans.. The first time was great! But i don't know what happened the second time around. Maybe it was just me.. I'm a little bothered that my friend and I requested for another dozen of oysters, where the gentlemen did not acknowledge our request- so we figured that he didn't hear us. Another gentlemen, kindly asked us if we would like anything else.. which duh- we then ordered our oysters! He acknowledged our request, and was sooo nicee, BUT the other older gentlemen brought the oysters out WITH the other gentlemen. I know there was a mix up. Hey! We didn't mind ordering another two dozen.. that was NOT the problem at all.. but what shook me up.. was the fact that the older gentlemen mumbled f**king \"something\" and thought I didn't hear.. that really bothers me.. especially because we were cool with having the two dozen oysters.

I then requested for fresh glasses he then poured water into the pitcher he dug his hands in.  I wanted to walk out then.  I requested he start all over with new glasses and new pitchers.

Friendly staff as well, price is just ok but it's the best deal I've seen for oysters and believe me I love my raw oysters! On the times that i've come it seems the weekdays are much slower and coming on odd times like 2pm-4pm is a better time no rushing and no lines. I raved about it by calling my dad and letting him know, I get the oyster tongue from him..he says to me \"oh yeah...i've been going there many years ago, yeah they have the best tasting oysters in the bay area\"..I agree as well, they are close to comparison with the juicy Hog Island ones as well hmmmm!", "author": "Ateh M."}

My roomie and I ran into a couple of our tranny friends who were more than happy to join us on our excursion (for you see even though it might have been just lunch to some people, a trip to Swan's for me is adventure for my taste buds). The wait wasn't too bad and one of the men working that afternoon was quite a comely fellow (plus once he realized that the three of us were talking about him and smiling he did a little strut around the counter so we got a meal and a show! that's right furry boy we noticed your cocky strut and loved it!) Oysters and salads and crab and shrimp cocktail are so tasty with an Anchor Steam to boot. However although I know that the counter is part of the \"appeal\" I will have to complain that I always always always end up either (a) getting the stool that wobbles slightly, (b) end up in that one area where you end up banging your knee cap on the tiles forcing you to sit in a faraway, awkward position or (c) sit next to a counter hog who starts invading my space and continues to glare at me while I try to squeeze my lunch into a space the size of a quarter.

Looks like something out of a 20's gangster movie, tiled floor with a worn marble slab counter. Simple menu (on the wall) but what they do, they do right. A shrimp cocktail followed by a crab salad with an Anchor Steam on tap and hunk of incredibly good bread and I'm in heaven. A ritual for me, if I don't hit Swan once a month I'm not living right. Not cheap, but shelled fresh crab is worth the cost!", "author": "Alessandra I."}

( guy at the counter handled money, did not wash his hands and touched a customers fish.) after seeing that i opted not to try the crab salad. decent place for oysters if there's no wait but after waiting over an hour i was dissapointed.", "author": "john l."}

I dont know why.  they also often have items not on the menu, so ask for something special and you might get lucky.  or might not.  also of note are the wooden casks of tequila that sometimes flow for an extra special post-chowder shot before the next course.  I love this place.", "author": "church B."}

We arrived at about 11am and had our pick of seats at the bar...within 15 minutes, there was a line out the door. Let's face it, the place is a cramped dive. But it has a terrific vibe and we had typically friendly service from the many guys behind the counter. We had wonderfully fresh and plump bluepoint and miyagi oysters (you don't get oysters like these in Utah and Texas!). My wife had the clam chowder (too thin for my tastes) and we split a dungeness crab salad which was loaded with impeccably fresh-picked crab. Awesome meal and still a must-do in SF. This place is much better than Hog Island at the Ferry Bld (there, you pay up the wazoo for ambience). Remember to bring cash cause they don't take any credit cards. It can add up rather quickly. A dozen oysters...$24. A cup of chowder...$2.50. Bread & butter...$1. Crab salad...$19. Soda...$2.50. Best seafood in SF...priceless.", "author": "Jason K."}

I popped in during an errand run to get a quick cup of SOD's famous clam chowder.  It was already $4.75 for a \"bowl\" and the guy upselled me to the next size up which the counter guy liberally stated as a \"pint\".  The physical container sizes made me think that a bowl is 10 oz. and a pint cup was 12 oz.  When he rang me up, he told me it was $7.50 -- which shocked me for the difference.   My expectations of a $7.50 bowl was that I would have chock full of clam meat.  Instead I got this greasy white clam chowder consomme with a layer of grease on the top and balls of cream.  Perhaps this is natural separation after the half hour in between serving and eating even though it was still hot.  But there were hardly any clams at all.  Not exactly your premium soup for $7.50 -- I would have been better off popping open a can of Chunky's.  The menu prices are way to high for what amounts to boiled seafood served with cocktail sauce.  $33 for a cooked lobster -- which amounts to dropping it in a vat of hot water !!  You're better off getting your seafood fix at a Chinese restaurant and paying a lot less for a lot more flavor.", "author": "Y M."}

Incredibly fresh seafood.  The oysters, prawns, cherrystones, and everything else on the menu does not get any more fresh.  The sauteed softshell crab was incredible, but I don't think they do it anymore.  Definitely worth it to ask though.  When you order the prawn cocktail don't forget to ask them for some tartar sauce.  They make the best tartar sauce in the world.  So good i can eat it by the spoonful. Maybe...    Their clam chowder is more like clam broth.  Very very tasty.  Not the typical thick chowder.  This stuff is good, and not overly rich like most places.  Come here and come early.  The wait can be long.  Try to get yourself a seat closer to the back.  Two reasons.  One... People waiting will be breathing down your neck towards the front of the shop.  Two...  The first few seats in the shop have no leg room.  Those of you who come here often know what I'm talking about.  Service is top notch.  Never seen people so eager to help.", "author": "Nick H."}
