Most chips have that crispy sogginess and theres good flavor from the eggs, avocado, salsa and onions. There was a good amount of avocado. I always dig that. I added tinga de pollo as an extra but honestly it was a bit hidden because there wasn't much of it. \n\nOverall it kind of satisfied the chilaquile craving, I really need to go back to Mexico City though.

Sangria was, well, Sangria and tacos were, well, good looking and tasty but no bargain at two bites for three bucks.\nThat aside, a bunch of friends decided to meet there. Ten of us arrived early (let's call them the Earlies) and I came with the second ten or so a bit later (the Lates).\nThe Earlies were seated in a corner on the East side of the room.  There were few other customers, being just after five.  When the Lates came, the host directed us to the West side of the room.  We explained we were together with the Earlies, but saw that the larger West side of the room was empty except for one couple who was just getting their check.  The was plenty of room on the West side for all of us, so we started making a place.  The gracious couple there encouraged us.  We called over the Earlies.  \nWell, the host was having none of it.\nHe explained that within the hour the place would be so packed we could hardly move, and it wasn't convenient to have us all seated together.\nI suggested that, since it was inconvenient for them to have us there, perhaps it would please him more if we found a more suitable venue (elsewhere).  Host demurred, faded away, and was soon off shift.\nThe other staff was very helpful, got us settled in, and came up with a great system for billing the large group (via tables of four).\nThe promised unwashed hordes never appeared.  In fact, the place was pretty lonely.\nIn any case, having been put off by our welcome and the diminutive tacos, we decided to dine elsewhere after happy hour, with some of us ending up across the street at wonderful La Mediteranee ... but that's  for a different review.\nQuick summary? If you are in the neighborhood, not too hungry, like self-important hosts and can't find anywhere else, it's not a bad place to end up...", "author": "Bruce J."}

Our delivery order was scheduled to arrive on Friday, September 28th between 11:30am and 12pm via Caviar. It didn't arrive until around 1:15pm, which means it was over an hour late. Not sure who's fault this was, but as a result, everything was lukewarm. Plus, they forgot an order of flautas, so someone at work went lunchless.\n\nTacos de la Republica: Your choice of meat or veggies, 3 tacos on organic corn tortilla, onion, cilantro relish, lime, and roasted tomatillo salsa ($12)\n*Beer Marinated Steak\n*Al Pastor\n*Adobo Chicken\n\nI adore tacos, so I figured this was a good way to sample a few. They all had pretty good flavor, but at $4 each, I found them kinda small. They were basically the size of a bigger street taco. Plus, they needed some salsa or something to give some of the meat moisture. I had some hot sauce at my desk, so I just used that. At least that gave them a little kick. A coworker ordered the plantains and hated them. And she loves plantains. Unfortunately, they ended up discarded. \n\nKind of a fail of a lunch order. My tacos were okay, but they were definitely not worth the wait. If you're hangry, don't order delivery from here. You'll be starving by the time it arrives.", "author": "Elena N."}

I live right around the corner, so I have no idea why it took me so long to stop by, but I am so glad I did. \n\nWe came by before watching the Derby, and realized it was Cinco de Mayo so you can imagine the place got crowded pretty quickly. We sat at the bar but had no issues. It was around 11am and there was no wait at the bar, and a short line for tables. By noon there was a short line but people seemed to be seated pretty fast.\n\nService was fast and attentive. They had Cinco de Mayo brunch and drink specials, and we went with classic Bloody Marias. They were great. They also had fresh watermelon juice, and although we didn't order it, it looked refreshing.\n\nThe brunch was on point. Everything was so flavorful, and exactly what we needed to satisfy our Mexican-inspired cravings. I had the Huevos Rancheros, and added carnitas. The person I was with had an order of the brunch special. It had eggs, pork?, and avocado among other things on top of a thick and fluffy tortilla. We shared a little of both and they were both delicious but different. We also ordered avocado toast to share. Avocado toast is avocado toast, but at least it wasn't $10.\n\nBefore we left, our server gave us a cookie on the house. \"You will love this,\" he said.

No salt, no lime.  Bland.\n\nWhite or red sangria was just fruit and wine.  No sweetener.  The waitress was kind enough to let me try both before deciding, but I like mine sweet, so I didn't like this version.\n\nAs for the $2 street tacos, you have to get 3, and they have to all be the same, no mix and match.  The fish tacos are not on special, because fish is more expressive.  I got chicken mole poblano tacos on recommendation.

It was busy, but we headed straight to the bar to be seated immediately. I ordered carnitas tostada and fried avocado taco, followed by a potato flauta garnished with fresh veggies. All equally tasty, with the exception of the carnitas which was cooked perfectly with the some crispy pieces on the outside, and tender on the inside.... winner, winner carnitas dinner! The SO ordered the asada taco with horesradish and chicken tostada.  The one thing strange about the tostadas and flautas is that they are priced individually, but you have to buy a minimum of two... so really should be priced for the true value to avoid any confusion. \n\nWe had such a great experience, that we went to brunch on Sunday. The SO got the California omelette that was polished off pretty quickly and I order the chorizo with eggs, corn tortillas and 1/2 black beans/potatoes. I also ordered a Michelada, to me is a beer version of a bloody mary that paired nicely with my meal.

And isn't the Castro where you're supposed to get blown? Well, let me retrace its history. First, it was the dependable grease pit that was Bagdad Cafe, then it went down N'awlins way to become Criolla Kitchen, then it took a sharp turn into whatever land as SliderBar, suddenly it was the oddly named Ovok and then just as suddenly it wasn't, and now it's The Castro Republic.\n\nI don't know when the neighborhood gained its independence, but I must have missed the Presidential motorcade passing by. The new owner, Juan Romo, also owns the less spacious Tacos Club across the street. He's also responsible for four Mexican places in the East Bay, so he certainly knows his food. I just wish he went for more authenticity with his menu. It seems like he's trying to compete with Tacorgasmico down the street and Tacolicious, magnets for the skinny hipsterati with their generic bar bite appetites and entitled attitudes.\n\nThis sure doesn't feel like a Mission taqueria, more like SliderBar redux with barely an accent. Jamie W. started our meal by sharing the $8 Guacamole, which was refreshing topped with chopped tomatoes, red onion, and cilantro. The chips were clearly house-made, thick and crunchy (photo: http://bit.ly/2gFVKGL). Good but pricey, a consistent theme. Jamie decided to try their $9.60 Burrito de la Republica, which was stuffed with green rice, grilled onions, black beans, and their house-made salsa. For an extra fifty cents, he had cheese added, and for another fifty cents, sour cream (photo:  http://bit.ly/2fuuvKk).\n\nNow $10.60 is not highway robbery by any means, but it still felt like there was a bit of nickel-and-diming there. It was hearty though nothing about it really stood out from any other overstuffed burrito you could find within a five-block radius. I ordered the $13.80 Carne Asada Quesadilla de la Republica (photo: http://bit.ly/2gG4Sej). It was a bountiful portion, quite tasty and really enough for two, but then again, it would have been nice to have a smaller option with a lower price tag.

I could see this as a popular spot to chill for those who live in the area - not a destination spot though.\n\nI believe it was $3.50-$4 for tacos, $8 for guac, and $14-15 for a plate.\n\nWe opted for the mole since it was one of their signature dishes. It was ~$14 and although it came with a decent amount of chicken for the price, it only came with 3 small tortillas and a tiny bit of spanish rice and beans :(!! A bummer that they didn't provide more of the 'cheaper' filler stuff to make it seem like a better value. The spanish rice wasn't that flavorful and a bit soggy, and the beans were whatevs. Tortillas were soft and doughy though! The meat to 'stuff' ratio was pretty high and we finished our sides faster than we did the chicken...\n\nAnd so, we ordered the guac/chips to round out our meal.\n\nThe guac is pretty fairly priced. It comes with I think a flour-based (NOT CORN!) chip. Nice, thick and freshly fried. Some pieces were a bit undercooked, they could work on cooking it more evenly.. and a dash of salt would go a long way! The guac seemed like maybe 1-2 freshly mashed avocados with a generous amount of lemon juice. No onions/tomatoes within the guac, it actually came as a tiny scoop of pico de gallo on top. Overall, pretty good, I would get this again but I do prefer a corn chip, or it would be nicer if they salted the chips a bit.\n\nI don't think I would return as there are plenty of other restaurants in the area I haven't tried, though I would TOTALLY come for their Taco Wednesdays if I ever had the chance.. except I don't think I would ever be able to get to the Castro before 6 on Wednesdays :(", "author": "Emily C."}

First off, the only server working (I'm an ass - I didn't ask his name or check the receipt) was close to rock star status.  Only server working but knocked it out of the park on being receptive to menu questions, doting on our table, and putting off a professional yet warm vibe.  \n\nAs for food, it literally took me one bite of my chilaquiles (w/chicken added) to form one regret about this place - it wasn't located in our home town for us to be able to return more readily.  The hunks of chicken in my dish were enough to make me wanna cry - if I could make poultry that tender yet not dried out I'd be a proud chicken chef.  Awesome ratio of cheese / chicken / scrambled eggs / sauce & tortilla chips - it really really hit the nail for what I was hoping it would be.\n\nTo continue the chicken theme - my wife's \"crisp-chick\" sandwich (one of the server's favs, and now one of ours) she was kind enough to offer a bite of as soon as it arrived.  Here's the deal - I usually decline a sample until I've eaten my own food & my wife has finished what she's going to..but in this case that sandwich looked so great I couldn't say no I was sooo glad I did not.  I was even more stoked knowing whatever she didn't eat was going to be mine because it was that great - spiced crisp chicken on soft bread w/pepper jack and some heavenly sauce.  I wished I had a cow's four stomachs so I could pack one with this sandwich on top of the chilaquiles I'd already inhaled.\n\nThe kids both rocked the silver dollar pancakes.  I even sampled a bite of these since our son offered.  And yea, whatever jerkwad was working the griddle nailed these too.  Jerkwad? Why the animosity?  Because both of the fruit of my loins said these pancakes were better than mine at home - hence the animosity.  Not surprisingly, our 8 and 10 year olds opted to go straight maple syrup on their hotcakes & took a pass on the mango butter & the mascarpone cheese on the side.        \n\nMore kudos to this place for being so clean it looked like you could eat off the floor (yea we came right @opening, but the lack of a single cobweb in a hard to reach corner & no dust shimmering in the sunbeams is a hint)...also the location - it was right off the stop for the Muni \"F\" line streetcars we took (because we were tourist-ing) & had prominent signage which made it easy for this old dude to spot before we had to roam aimlessly whilst starving.", "author": "Dave N."}

I guess because it was Wednesday and everyone knew about their deals, my friend and I waited about 20-30 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we ordered our tacos and drinks...and then had to wait another 30 minutes until we received our food. One star was deducted for the wait time for the food. The restaurant should know that Wednesdays will bring in a large amount of customers so they should adjust the kitchen staff to decrease the wait time. I also had noticed that another table that had been seated way after me had gotten their food a lot faster as well. The waiter had even came by while we were waiting asking if we had received our food yet, which I replied no. He said he would check on it but never came back. \n\nOnce we had gotten the food, the tacos were DELICIOUS. My recommendation is to eat the fish taco last because I had it second after my steak taco and everything after the fish taco just didn't live up to those standards.

Menu looked amazing and I was excited to try their \"famous\" adobo chicken tacos which only come in orders of 3 tacos (no single taco orders). They had two vegetarian options: deep fried avocado with black beans, or veggies including grilled onions and mushrooms on black beans. What can go wrong at a place that fries avocados? NO SALT. The different tacos had various spices but nothing popped because they did not salt the food at all. Tacos came with two house made salsas--red and green, both of which were bland and flavorless. Again, no salt. The food looked delicious and you can tell they used quality ingredients but everything really desperately needed a healthy helping of salt and seasoning. \n\nI probably wouldn't eat here again because I just wasn't impressed by the food.

Most of the items are predominantly Mexican, with some hints of Peruvian (ceviche), some hints of Caribbean (Cuban sandwich), and even a dash of Asian (papaya salad--really now?). The menu offerings are pretty expansive but all over the place. Instead of being all over the place, I kind of wished that the restaurant focused on a particular region of Latin cuisine (and actually cooking those dishes well) instead of offering dishes (which might not be the cooks' specialities or expertise) from all across the Latin world.  \n\nCame here with a few friends last week. For my entree, I had ordered the chorizo/potato and carne asada tacos. Both of which were salty but lacking depth or flavor. The chorizo taco was also pretty oily (as expected since chorizo has a high fat content).  As an appetizer, I ordered the fried plantains which were served in a wet goop of black beans and sour cream and cheese. The plantains were the most disappointing aspect of meal because they were semi-fried -- not heavily fried enough to make tostones and not saut\u00e9ed enough to make maduros. Instead what was served was undercooked, slightly raw tasting plantains that were also bland. I like my plantains either caramelized (and sweet) or completely deep fried (and crunchy and perfect for dipping or snacking). However, the plantains sadly were neither of these.  Also, the black beans that the plantains didn't seem cooked either- they were cold and looked and tasted like they were just poured out of a Del Monte can of black beans. No bueno!\n\nFrom lackluster tacos to poorly cooked plantains with canned beans, I can definitely say my meal experience was a disappointing one. Most people in San Francisco go to the Mission for Latin food; they don't go to the Castro for that. I definitely would stick to that general rule and skip out on food here.

The mango salsa on it was good though cause the mangos were ripe. The bbq chicken salad was large, but also not worth it due to it being smothered in dressing. Maybe it's just me in this city, but I work hard for my money and to have the food we had today was just crappy. Not worth the $67 after tip. It was not impressive nor any good to revisit. They were nice and the food came out quick. We did come to eat at 5:30. I can see how it may be worth it for Wednesday night taco specials maybe for the crowd that it would get (?).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-24", "description": "I came here yesterday with a friend who lives around the corner.  She had the quesadilla and the draft root beer, and I had the chicken mole tacos and a Lagunitas.\n\nThe tacos were awesome!  They are small - like traditional tacos, not all those tacos you get from super American-ized places, so the 3 per order minimum is a reasonable amount of food.  The mole is one of the best mole's I've had in SF.  It's spicy (YAY) but also has a lot of depth with the chocolate coming through just enough to remind you it's in there and enhancing the spiciness.  \n\nThe new owners have updated the space - including the bathroom!  The last time I was in the bathroom, it was disgusting.  It's now pleasant and very clean.  The whole restaurant feels clean and like it should be free of its troubles with the Health Department.  It has a welcoming, casual decor, fresh blooms on the tables and a great location.\n\nService was extremely friendly and attentive.  I suspect they have read the other reviews and responded :)  They offered my friend multiple free refills on her root beer which she happily accepted.  (I tasted it--that specialty draft root beer isn't even comparable to the regular mass distributed kind!  It *almost* made me want some instead of my beer).\n\nThe menu feels a little all over the place.  It is most heavily Mexican, but they have things like sliders and fries and typical brunch food on the weekend.  Given some of the other reviews, if the non-Mexican isn't their specialty, narrowing the menu to just the Mexican options might be a good move for them - easier/cheaper to buy for and better for food quality.  I'd definitely go back to try other Mexican items on their menu after having the mole tacos.\n\nThey have a good selection of beers on tap and several sangria options.  \n\nThe prices are definitely higher than your standard, hole-in-the-wall taqueria, but I thought the ambiance, service, and drink selection make it worth it.  This is a neighborhood place to come with friends for a leisurely, casual, fun drink and meal versus an in-and-out stop after drinking or when you're in a hurry and just want to grab a bite to eat on the go.\n\nI hope these guys succeed.  It's the best place that's been in here since Baghdad Cafe.", "author": "Sara E."}

The lighting fixtures are made from old hardware from the kind of ladders that roll on a track, like in a nice book store. The service was outstanding, eye contact, smile...it means a lot. With the prices in this city, people like to feel like they are valuable customers...they do here. The menu was extensive for what I thought was a Mexican restaurant...it is that, but it's more than that. The food was very good but not perfect. I had the chicken Tostada. It was really tasty, not a word I use often. Fresh is maybe better, very fresh. The chicken was cooked different than the usual boiled...it was flavorful with all the tostada fixing on top with fancy sliced (little) avocado. There was just too much moisture in the plate and the crispy part was soggy. I like crispy, but maybe it's their style. The seating was awful...really uncomfortable, I sat in three different seats before I could sit long enough to eat but even that...I could;dn't finish my food because I couldn't sit there any longer. Why 4 starts...it was my first try there, Tostadas are like that sometimes...the service was that good. I'll be back and try something else...it's close to the fabulous Castro Theater so, there you have it...the price was low, I thought...I was out of there for under $20.00.", "author": "Rodney M."}

Hate that an why go out to eat if im doing the work for u .  Anyway we stood in line to order and because we had ?s about the menu the people behind us made us feel rushed and I no the two guys were not thrilled with ?s being ask when the line was long , I don't blame them but thats how your owners set it up ,not our fault.  So we placed our order and I did ask the guy how much for mimosas he said  like 9-13 for a glass which is a small glass or unlimited for 18 and i looked at him an said 18 really! i got a diet coke ! but they did bring the food hot and my taco was really good and they came by to make sure we were satisfied .
