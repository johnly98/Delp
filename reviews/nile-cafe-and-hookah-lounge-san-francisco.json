The house tea made with milk rivals some of the best Pakistani/Indian chai I've had- a must try. \n\nHookah- 3.5 stars\nA good quality Khalil Mamoon base- but hose tubing is plastic-corrugated but had a decent pull. (A rubber hose with metal end would be better)  Comes with three coals- a bit harsh, I had to take off two of the coals- for a slower better burn. (Ask for tongs).\n\nHouse tea (ORDER IT WITH MILK!)- 5 stars \nUnbelievable- it's Chai- and quite possibly one of the best chai's I've ever tasted. Perfect for chilly SF evenings. \n\nRandom fact: This is where I lost my hookah virginity over 15 years ago. It's been around that long.

I'm guessing San Fran isn't really big on hookah bars because it was almost impossible to find some decent hookah bars around here. After desperately searching, we decided to come to this place. Their hookah menu is very limited and they only use coconara coals which i thought was kind of weird. I ended up ordering and the hookah they brought out to us didn't come with a clean pipe, you have to request it and pay a little extra for it. Here in the DC area giving people a new pipe is a given. Well we asked for a new pipe and started smoking. The hookah was good for about 10 minutes and after that it got really harsh and would burn my throat. I didn't have a pair of tongs to change the coals myself so I had to wait for one of the workers to come by so I could ask him. The service is kind of slow but not too bad. Another thing that I noticed is that it states on their menu that they only change your coals twice and thats it. I'm not sure if this is something common in the area or if its just that hookah bar but i have never heard of any hookah bar putting a limit as to how many coals you're allowed to have. Well it turned out that there was no need for a change of coals because we ended up leaving cause our hookah was so bad. Despite the hookah being terrible, the servers are very nice.", "author": "Nargis A."}

This place is definitely more for smaller groups of 2-4 people and nothing more. Secondly, the service here is TERRIBLE. Apparently there is a rule that one hookah must be shared between two people. But the problem is not everyone in our group wanted to hookah, we just wanted to chill together, but they said we HAD to order a hookah between two people...that's 5 hookahs (each ~$20+) are you kidding me?

You have to sit there puffing for 10mins before you get a decent smoke, and even then then flavour is minimal at best. \n\nThe service was abysmal which is a part of my hookah experience, note the place wasn't very busy so there was no reason for such poor service. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place unless desperate.", "author": "Adrianne D."}

The absolute worst hookah lounge i've ever been to. \n\nFIRST, the hookahs are all different sizes. At first, we literally thought that this was a \"bring your own hookah\" kind of place, because there are literally no 2 of the same hookah- they are all different colors and sizes, the latter being the issue. \n\nSo we ask for a nice, tall hookah because at $25 a hookah, I expect more than a 6 inch hookah like many that we saw in there. You can literally BUY your own hookah of that size for $25!!! \nSo we ask for a decent hookah, and apparently you can only smoke the tiny ones inside BUT there's a group of 6 guys smoking a gigantic one inside right next to us (what the heck!!!!) and they still refuse to allow us to do this. \n\nFurthermore, we settle for a medium sized one, and order 2 teas and a Rose/Mint Hookah, then they come and tell us that they are out of Rose, so we ask for Jasmine instead. Then, they tell us they are out of Jasmine too, and that Rose and Jasmine are the same, that if we order Rose or Jasmine, it doesn't matter because they are going to serve us the exact same thing. SERIOUSLY? These people don't even know how to differentiate one flower from another. They are completely different! SOOOO rude and not customer-oriented. \n\nThe tipping point was the table, which my boyfriend ruined his $300 jacket on, because the table was covered in some sticky red stuff that stained his sleeve forever. \n\nWe could not take ANYMORE, and left without another word. \n\nOh, and if this review isn't enough to get you not to visit here, there are crazy psychotic people with killer dogs walking around outside. We literally saw a crazy girl walking her gigantic pitbull struggling to keep it from attacking one of the millions of sketchy people walking around outside. STAY AWAY from this place.

This place took a NOSE DIVE since then. \nI consider myself a connoisseur of the mighty Shisha, and the last time I went to the Nile after being out of the country, I was so disappointed. Something happened to this place, it used to be such a gem.\nTo prove it wasn't just me, I'll list what changed:\n\n-No more lounging couches inside, just hard tables\n-No more wood coal in a brazier outside: now they use that coconut stuff that over-burns. That would be fine, if they gave you tongs to shuffle it around yourself, but they don't, so your shisha just burns black.\n-No more starbuzz. Not sure what it is now, but it's not starbuzz you're smoking,\n-No more prompt service to help, which sucks, since you don't have tongs.\n-Prices went up to match the competition (possibly exceed).\n\nBasically, this hookah is what you make at home, nothing impressive at all anymore. For some reason buttloads of Middle Eastern looking kids still like to come here in big groups. If you're with them, I guess this place is the sh*t. But I'm pretty sure their moms hang out at Pride...so I'm probably going to start going back there.\n\nI'm leaving one star for the super nice Russian (?) sounding waitress and yummy coffee blends and mint tea.\n\nOtherwise, skip it.

It was floral, minty, fresh, clean, almost like smoking a plethora of sweet alcoholic drinks and perfumes, which sounds kind of weird, but thats the only way I can explain the randomness from the tobacco pack. It was seriously really good and smooth.\n\nAlso, they do pack the tobacco in densely, and the coals are ultra slow burners and hold shape, instead of ash out easy and crumble into the pot. This prevents you from getting a really harsh burn.\n\nBut at 20, I think its a bit more than I'd pay for.

The only star goes to the friendly woman behind the counter. \n\nSo... it's after 10:00 PM on a Sunday, cabin fever has started to set in from sitting on me ass too long, and I think... what could we (me + boy) POSSIBLY do? I had Yelped hookah bars/lounges/whatever you call them a while back, and thought, maybe this was our only late night option for this evening. So why not? It's a cold night, I'm bored, so why not do a little lung damage?\n\nFast forward through a 25-minute car drive across the city to one of the crappiest neighborhoods San Francisco has to offer. Weaving through the dodgy crowd up a hill, we finally get to the Nile Cafe. We browse the menu, and quite reasonably decide we don't want to pay $20 for a hookah when they were closing in about an hour. Between two people that's a little steep... so, we'll just have a seat and order a pot of tea and a smoothie instead. And perhaps hang out for a half hour at most. Harmless enough, right?\n\nSo when the otherwise kind gentleman comes over to take our order, we politely explain that we didn't want to get a hookah but we wanted to order drinks instead. They (he) wouldn't let us! They said we couldn't order, or sit down, without getting a hookah. So we had to leave so we didn't take up valuable table real estate. Because any moment now, a flood of patrons would ensue and we would be hogging one of the ten empty tables? I don't know. \n\nBeing a hookah lounge virgin I cannot comment on the establishment's overall impressiveness, but the boy insisted that of all the lounges he's been to, that was by far the crappiest and most expensive one he had seen. Duly noted.\n\nSo fast forward through another 25-minute drive home, filling the car with mumbles of \"that was dumb\" and \"how retarded\" and \"fucking lame. I'm going to leave them a bad Yelp review, dammit.\" \n\nAnd, here it is.", "author": "Andrea B."}

The place is a bit small, but the owner doesn't really have a problem with it: the location of the building is very accessible as it's only three blocks away from Union Square.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place was great: Bob Marley sang through the speakers while a handful of sexy Middle Eastern music videos played on the plasma TV. And I agree with the consensus: the owner is super friendly and loves to chat without imposing on your friends' session. He suggested that we try a bowl of the house mix (Nile Mix 2), which I thought was a very delicious blend of fruity flavors and a hint of mint. Contrary to my friend's preconceived notion, it was nothing at all like smoking menthols; the mint was very subtle and even enhanced the taste of the fruit. The best part was, the owner didn't give us a time limit: we stayed at Nile for a good hour and a half, with a renewal of (legitimate, not prepackaged) coals halfway through.\n\nNile Cafe may be my new hookah joint.

I went here for the first time on Friday, and I found it very chill, unpretentious, and overall a very friendly hookah bar. Even if you don't smoke hookah, you can try their AMAZING tea. I swear, the best I ever had. I went with some friends, and I drank the whole pot of tea literally before they even had half of the pot. The manager was a super-chill guy, and I met these two guys who worked there, Vijay and David. Vijay was really nice, and David was uber interesting to talk to. Even if you don't really have anything to do, you can pretty much talk to David (who's a really interesting guy from East Africa) all night long (if they're not too busy) without getting bored and without the usual awkward silences, I swear. \n\nThe only iffy of the night was a high school girl (I know!) who decided I was being unfriendly and picked a fight with me. I was like \"chill\" and it was sort of funny how she got really mad at me in retrospect. that's how chill this place is. I literally forgot about how I nearly had my first catfight after some quality hookah and tea. How fitting it was to be this chill place to have my first fight (kinda).", "author": "Janet W."}

The oft-raved about house tea, though tasty, was a little sweet for me, especially since we were smoking sweet shisha.  Maybe the Lemon Mint would have been a preferable complement over Nile mix 1 (our server wouldn't tell us anything more about the mix besides that it's \"fruity\" - having smoked it, I don't have much more detail to offer.)  So many flavors!  \n\nIt's a tiny spot, but there's a lot going on to provide entertainment - a pillowed area near the front window for max-relaxin, and some booths near the back with a TV playing india-sexy music videos that don't correspond with the music in the cafe.  The music that's actually playing is a hilariously random selection.  When I went there was a really excellent bongo player who occasionally interrupted his puffs to bang along when he felt moved to do so.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-12", "description": "My friend has been telling me about this place since I met him, and today I finally got a chance to check it out.  Located in what he has dubbed the 'tandoor-loin', it was rather nondescript, but could be quickly picked out once we looked for the little sun shaped sign protruding from the wall.  As we walked in I first noticed the tidy, near-eastern feel of the place.  It may be small but it certainly didn't feel it.  How they did this without mirrors I do not know, though I admit it was a bit early and therefore not very busy.  My friend and I opted for a seat around the floor hookah stand (the rest of the hookahs are seating only but I'll take pillows on the floor anytime) and ordered the jasmine flavor which he so highly recommended.  Though the owner tried to dissuade us, directing us to the tamer 'fruit' flavors, we stuck by our choice, and did not regret it.\n\nHaving tried their shisha before (you can buy some to take home) I knew to expect a very flavorful experience.  However, trying it from one of their beautiful hookahs heated with real coals was something else again.  I am being completely honest here when I say that the shisha itself lasted over an hour before dying down.\n\nTry the tea.  It was hot.  It was spiced.  It was delicious.  He asked us what we thought of it, and we replied emphatically that it was delicious.  When we asked the man (owner, I assume) what was in it he vaguely cited 'african spices' as the ingredients which gave it that special oomph.  It may have been just us but we both agreed that we tasted clove in there somewhere.  And it was undoubtedly sweetened with cane sugar and not the 'refined' stuff one normally encounters nowadays.  Absolutely delicious, I only wish I could have brought some home with me.\n \nMy friend, who had never been there during the day before, said the atmosphere was much different at night.  Though I took this to mean a night time jaunt would result in an improved experience, I was more than satisfied with the day time vibe.  However, now that I've been here once, I absolutely must come again.

One things for sure is that it isn't as crowded as many of the other spots; Cairo Nights in particular. Great place to hangout and \"chill\" with your buddies. Hookah is fantastic as well. Customer Service is much better than other places; they actually come regularly to replace your coals unlike other places where you have to keep going up to ask the employees to come do it. If the $10 hookah deal was until late night, it would be the best spot! Go and try it for yourself :)", "author": "Moe L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-12", "description": "A better than average hookah bar in a city that lacks in many hookah options. Service is always somewhat slow, but it's hookah, you're there to relax, not grab a quick smoke over lunch. The shisha is just fine, the tea is pretty good, and while small the atmosphere is enjoyable enough. I've not been on any crazy busy nights, but it's usually got a few people, but not too bad. Wifi rounds out the mix, though I've only used it once. All of this is tempered by the fact that it is pricey as hookah places go. \n\nHonestly I was going to give this four stars but had to adjust it down to three. A lack of major negatives but a lack of big positives makes this a solid \"Alright\" in my book. Check it out if you don't want to deal with louder crowd at Cairo Nights.", "author": "Scott R."}

The place wasn't hard to find and there seems to be decent parking around.  Just be careful, I knew by looking at the address that it wasn't the hottest location as its in the Tenderloin.  Not the worst neighborhood but definitely not the best.  Lots o characters hanging out if that's your thang.\n\nThe joint wasn't that large and only two other parties were  here.  Pretty chill setting.  I'd say there's about roughly 5-6 tables to sit at.  We sit down and ask for a menu.  He handed us a menu with roughly 50 flavors.  We got our hooka pipe quit and smoked for roughly an hour and a half.  \n\nIt is also a cafe as my friends and I were able to get coffee and some Arabic Tea which was pretty good.  There's more selection for food and drink but  we didn't partake in any of it.  I'd definitely come back here and the people working here were cool and helpful.

Oh, and can't forget the scantily clad persian women on zhe mtv....\n\nIt's a great spot- close to everything downtown/union square/ hotel, but not pretentious, and very down to earth place.

I'm from the East Coast and I wanted to make sure I would have plenty of hookah while I was in San Francisco, so I did some research online and found this place. The reviews on Yelp were very positive so I decided to give it a try since I consider myself a sheesha expert. I've smoked in all corners of the world and I must say that I was really impressed with the hookahs and tobacco at Nile Cafe. There is a wide variety of flavors, but I decided to stick to my usual double apple and mint and it was amazing. Later on I decided to check out \"sex on the beach\" flavor and even though I'm not much of a fruity flavor smoker, I really enjoyed this one. \n\nThe place is small, but it's very cozy.  And sometimes you end up chatting with the people next to you which is pretty cool. And of course no one will bother you if you'd rather not socialize with the others. There's also an area where you can sit on the floor, which is perfect for larger groups. The owner there is an awesome guy who's very friendly and always tries to accommodate everyone. It's just a very chill atmosphere. \n\nI had a list of other cafes I wanted to try out while in the Bay area, but I decided against it since this place was just perfect. The owner was so sweet that he would let me try the hookah HE was smoking just to see if I liked the mix he had made. And if I did, he'd make me the same one. The Nile Mix is good too if you want something light and a little fruity. \n\nAlso, this place doesn't serve food so the one review on here about food doesn't make sense. The owner of this cafe only serves drinks. He makes pretty good lattes and the tea here is amazing. \n\nAnd for those of you who consider yourselves experts in the sheesha department...this place uses natural coal which makes the flavor even better. They don't use the fast lite kind of coal. \n\nI was a bit worried about the location of the place after reading a few reviews on here that said the area wasn't the best. I asked my friend and she confirmed this, but when we went we felt fine and we weren't scared for our lives or anything like that. There's also a police station down the road so...yah you might see some strange people walking around, but you'll be fine. There's also a parking garage right across from the cafe which was pretty convenient!\n\nThis place definitely deserves 5 stars. Go there and you definitely won't be disappointed. The owner is awesome and he'll hook you up. \nI'll always remember this place as having damn good sheesha and would recommend it to all my hookah-loving friends.", "author": "Na3Na3 L."}

And while i think Yelp is an awesome site, I have always been a little bit hesitant to join. However, after my experience last night as this pathetic excuse for a hookah lounge, I felt motivated enough to actually join. So, what's so bad?\n\n1. Crappy and shady area. However, can't really blame this on the hookah bar. And I've been to shadier places (that were WAY better). So it is excused from this accusation.\n\n2. Ambience- Very cheesy. If I could come up with an analogy, it would be Cafe Nile: Middle Eastern :: Taco Bell: Mexican. \n\n3. Service- Employees are EXTREMELY rude and if you try to ask for help or attempt to get them out of their routine, they respond with extreme arrogance. Manager is a stress-nut who cannot handle customers questioning the service. \n\n4. Hookah quality- There are plenty of positive review on Yelp about the quality of hookah here which makes me wonder just how experienced the people reviewing Cafe Nile are. Coals are red hot and abundant but flavors of tobacco is mediocre at best and hookahs are the ones you can buy at an outlet plaza for about 40 or 50 bucks. Not worth it for 15 dollars per hookah. \n\n5. Food- I didn't actually order food but from the looks of both the plates and faces of customers who did order food, it looked like food you could get at a food court in a mall. Again, think Taco Bell for Middle Eastern. \n\nOverall, this is the absolute WORST hookah lounge I have been to and I would highly recommend one of the neighboring lounges over this sorry excuse for a Hookah lounge.

At several points in the evening, my companion and I were the only ones speaking English - everything, including the television made us feel as if we were in the middle east.  They have 23 different flavors for the hookah and are willing to combine flavors. \nKen, the owner, was amazingly helpful and friendly.  He let us know that he makes the tea from scratch.  It was so good that I couldn't bring myself to try the banana milk, but I suspect its a must as everyone in the cafe had one.  (The coffee was also superb.)  The food was very good, but different from an Ethiopian meal that one might get at the much missed Blue Nile.  The flavors are similar, but the presentation and ingredients were different.  I'm not certain if its more of an influence from the middle east that I've had with Ethiopian food in the past or if its a greater emphasis on fresh produce.  \nI almost don't want to post this review, as I'd love this little gem to remain private, but must share.\nThe decor is modern - clean lines and bright paint.

We wanted to go to Marrakech, but when we walked into Marrakech it was DEAD! Just some old men literally rubbing up against a scary looking stripper turned belly dancer. So we said screw this and went to Nile instead. I had been here once before and was not impressed- probably cause myself and my friend were the only ones in there. But this time I really had an awesome time. It was chill, but an upbeat chill! Lots of people having a good time. Had the house tea which I thought was alright. But I'm not the biggest tea drinker in the world anyways. In fact I've only started enjoying tea the last 6 months or so. The play list was also pretty cool. A nice mix of Arabic, Turkish and Indian pop. Also a little American pop, which can also be cool. You have to love it when Believing by Journey starts playing and everyone gets excited- some even sining along. For our shisha flavor we chose guava, which was pretty tasty and smooth. No joke a crack head came in and asked if he could \"hit yo shit?.\" Nah foo, you cant hit my shit!", "author": "David D."}

Originally we were going to go to Cairo Nights but despite the posted hours Cairo Nights was closed. So we went to the Nile Cafe and it was a much better choice. As we got there we were warmly greeted by our kind and courteous host Kume. We purchased guava flavored shisha and it was delicious. The coals that they use do not have any harsh undertones which is often common in hookah bars. Also Kume makes amazing smoothies and coffee drinks. Overall a truly nice experience.", "author": "Joseph N."}

There's a portion of the cafe where one can recline. That's a killer combo with shisha and hot tea! Fun place to hang out with friends and catch up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-16", "description": "I Love this place! This place is really chill if you just ever want to relax sit down and smoke. I went here for the first time with my friend and we got the Peach flavored tobacco as well as the House Tea and they were both soooo amazing! The tea is really sweet and gingery and the Peach is really nice and soft. They had a range of flavors to choose from and I had no idea what to pick. Some of the mixed flavors they had were really interesting: Obama and Sex on the Beach...Anyway this place is really small but it is so chill, you have hookah and some nice tea(great combo btw!) and some really cool arabic/bollywood music. My friend and i came here pretty early and so we had seats to ourselves for 2 hours and it was nice. The waiter was also very nice and helpful. I find the prices are a bit pricey tho and that is one thing that bothers me. I am also really shocked that they didn't even card me or my friend, but oh well. I will definitely go back to this place late at night or in the very early morning if i just want to relax from partying or if im just chillin out with buddies. I recommend this place!", "author": "Clementine D."}

It's a cozy place where you can relax and enjoy a hookah while watching Middle Eastern and Indian music videos.  I love the tobacco mixes here.  They are light and smooth.  I've had the apple mint and the Nile Mix 1 which is fantastic (if you like a fruity flavor).   You should also definitely get a pot of the house tea.  It makes a perfect complement to the tobacco and has just the right sweetness.", "author": "Roy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-11", "description": "We went to this place yesterday with my family and we ordered two hookahs ( one mint and one jasmin mint) and one teapot of arabic tea, and the bill came out as $60!! Secondly, the service was horrible, the hookahs were served inside since outiside was cold and there was something wrong with their heat lamp. There are so many cons about this place that I do not know where to begin with. The place had these round little cylinders that were lightly covered with blankets as chairs, that were good and fancy, but not even in the same zip code as comfortable! The atmosphere gave me a very bad headache since they were burning the coals inside and they left it on a spinner next to the wall and every 30 minutes they would add new coals to your hooka. They had this small plasma tv that was relatively fit in comparison to the size of their \"cafe\" that played a previously-recorded DVD on a loop of some of arabic music videos, the music was loud and when we politely asked him to turn it a little down, he just frowned in the most unprofessional manner for a business owner and blatantly ignored us. They also had this group of the owner's friends who had a VIP lounge and were telling jokes to each other as loud as a PA system! It was like a radio Al jazeera that you couldn't turn off! The place was dirty and the the music was on a loop, and what's worse is that they don't ID you for hookah, this place should be reported to the police because they serve tobacco to underaged minors, I saw at least 8 arabic minors who were friendly with the owner receive hookahs, and I'm very sure one of them slipped some marijuana in it because the we could all smell it very well, Nile Cafe very professionally turned our great night around and made the entire experience in the city bitterly unpleasant. I do not recommend this place if it was the last cafe on earth.", "author": "Aryo A."}

The patrons were very friendly and answered all of my questions. The cafe is nice and small, and wasn't too crowded. Even though I know nothing about Hookah's or Hookah bars, the product was very tasty and lasted over an hour for 2 people. The Arabic teas was delicious. The music was also fantastic. If there was one bad thing I had to say about this place, it would be that seemed a tad bit expensive, but then again, what isn't these days? I'll be sure to return many more times in the future.", "author": "Dane K."}
