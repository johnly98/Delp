Traditionally, the \"pork cakes\" are very wet and moist, but for a dollar extra, you can ask them to pan fry it. The end result is quite the opposite, being more firm and dry. With salty fish mixed in or salty egg, the pork cakes go extremely well with white rice.

Except our battle was choosing where to eat in Chinatown as there was a superabundance of restaurants to choose from and almost all of them packed with hungry diners and some overflowing out the door.\n\nWe found this place very close to where we just came from at the Golden Gate Bakery. We crossed the street, went inside and down a few steps and we were in the heart of the restaurant... no lobby, no waiting area, no hostess reception desk, no host/hostess! There was a small cashier table to the left and a long counter right next to it. This was where people waited to be seated including us and we were seeing people being served, people eating, everything right in front of us while waiting. A round table opened up that seated 8 but there were only me and hubby and a young family of 3 ahead of us. We shared the table with them and it all worked out. Our wait time was only 10 minutes.\n\nLooked through the menu and the prices were very reasonable. I decided on the Mongolian Beef rice plate (not spicy). It took awhile for my meal to come maybe because I chose  to not have it hot plus the restaurant was super busy. When it finally arrived i savored and enjoyed each bite, the meat was tender, authentic and very flavorful. It included saut\u00e9ed onions, green onions and slices of green pepper. Hubby had the Short Ribs in Black Pepper with rice and he enjoyed his meal as well. \n\nPeople were still coming in as we were leaving. Locals seem to love this place. When I searched Yelp for \"best Chinese restaurants in Chinatown\" this restaurant came in at #45. Good food, good prices! We'll be back although I'd like to try the other restaurants here in Chinatown :)\n\nReview #0632 (and 221st review for the business)", "author": "May A."}

We were directed here by a local shopkeeper whom we asked where a great place to eat was. She said all the locals go here. \n\nThe orange peel beef is amazing... slightly spicy, tangy as all get out, good level of sweetness, and crispy. Oh so wonderfully crispy (like: how do they do that?). 5/5\n\nThe Mongolian beef was... not what most Westerners would expect (not sweet at all). It was tender meat with some saut\u00e9ed onions and green peppers, but no real strong flavors. 2/5\n\nTo be honest, we got potstickers as well to fill our bellies, which were awesome and crispy but not served with any sauce except the soy sauce and hot sauce on your table. 4/5 (because they were delicious even just with soy)\n\nTea at the table: 2/5. I love tea, and I'm accustomed to a certain level of tea in the Chinese restaurants out in Atlanta on Buford Highway. This tea... made me sad, but at least it was something to drink on a cold day with a warm meal. \n\nService was polite (ehhhh well mostly) but rather mixed. Example: they start out by bringing you a pot of hot tea and some cups (sweet!) but then proceed to literally scoff/laugh at you when you order water with your meal (even though some nearby tables have water?) (and they never bring you water, so you secretly sip from your hidden bottled water if you really need some). However, while they initially bring you forks to eat with, they will then oblige if you ask for chopsticks instead. I understand some places don't like to offer water because it's a cultural thing in several countries to just have tea. But if families from those same countries are right next to you drinking glasses of water... let's just say I get confused.", "author": "Haviland F."}

I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes. \nSeafood wonton soup - base of the soup tasted like chicken msg (the kind my mother made when I was a child)\nThe vegetables - was oddly $9 for no protein. I think the dish was alright, because all you do is sauteed it in a wok \n\nFish filet --- it must have been bland, because I don't remember.\n\nI did like that the New Woey Loy Goey opened late. My opening statement is 'the food isn't amazing,' but I rather eat than sleep hungry. Lol. My friend and I went at 9:30, and they served us. The place was roaring with Chinese families and really made the atmosphere feel authentic. I guess it's a family favorite for some in SF. \n\nOverall, I still stand that the food is 2 stars. The place isn't clean, but it's certainly Chinese (which reminds me of my childhood) which I award it 3 stars. Making my true vote 2.5\n\nSide note: I'm offended they didn't offer me chopsticks.

Glad to have another opportunity to enjoy it.\n\nWe ordered:\n   Roast duck -- very good\n   Braised filet of rock cod -- very good\n   Mustard green -- very good\n   Lamb stew in pot -- very good\n   And one Tsing Tao beer.\n\nThe portions were very generous, and the four of us could not finish the food. The total bill came to $59 (tip included) -- a modest charge for a very good and satisfying dinner for four. But I give the restaurant 4* instead of 5 because the service was very marginal -- the wait staff did not speak much English (it was impossible to ask them to describe a dish, \"Everything GOOD\" one of them kept on repeating as answer to my many questions) and it took three exhortations before my wife could get her beer late into the meal despite having ordered it with the food early on.", "author": "Trong D."}

It's a little hidden because you have to walk down the stairs to get inside. I ordered for a tomato beef over rice and egg prawns over rice. Asked for no salt and they made it completely the way I asked for! Which a lot of times restaurants forget and do add some salt. Their prices can be as cheap as $7 for a plate of food and rice, which is kind of impossible for a dinner meal. I love this place!

One of our points of interest was to visit China Town.  As we were walking down the street, we decided to have a early dinner right there in China Town.  This place was a definite hidden gem for both locals and tourists!\n\nWe, at some point and can't remember why, decided to turn down a street.  Once we crossed, we saw two young ladies looking at a menu posted on a wall.  We looked it over, the prices seemed very reasonable.  The variety was awesome.\n\nThe fun and interesting part was their entrance.  You had to walk down a staircase to get to the restaurant's front door.\n\nIt's a very casual atmosphere, authentic, and maybe a family run business.  They have some family and combination meals available.  You can also order everything a la carte.  Everything we ordered was awesome!\n\nBy the end of our dinner, we were enjoying our dinner and engrossed in the Chinese fight movie the very friendly employees were watching.\n\nThis is a must visit!", "author": "Manny S."}

The French aren't the only ones eating this delicacy; the Chinese do, too.\n\nThis was a family outing for lunch, but we decided to forego the snails and order plenty of rice plates - chicken & Chinese mushroom, steak cube & Chinese broccoli, curry beef tongue, filet flounder & bok choy, beef tendon & turnip; a platter of beef chow fun and a claypot of spicy eggplants.\n\nIncluded with our lunch was the house soup, which was flavorful (could have had a slight amount of MSG, but not noticeable to give me a headache thereafter).  \n\nI ordered the chicken & Chinese mushroom rice plate (my favorite).  It was a generous portion of chicken, Chinese mushroom, green beans and carrots.  Since it was family style dining, we all shared what each of us ordered.\n\nEverything was delicious.  The eggplants had quite a kick to it...spicy (slices of fresh jalapeno peppers and red pepper flakes).  I only ate one eggplant and washed it down with a lot of tea.  I am somewhat allergic to very spicy food, so I have to be extremely careful on how much I consume.  My sisters raved about this dish and would order it again.  \n\nThe price for our meal was reasonable...about $8.00 per person.  Not bad having lunch there and leaving with a full stomach.\n\nThe hostess and the waitresses were also attentive and made sure we were content with the food we ordered, and our teapot was filled with hot tea.\n\nFinally, a funny thing happened on my way to the restroom.  I did not know the light switch was outside of the ladies' restroom.  Thank goodness I had my cellphone in my pocket and I kept pressing the middle button, playing my ringtone (Purple Rain by Prince) just so I would have some light in there.  At least I wasn't singing that gospel song, \"This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine\".  Another female customer turned the light on after I washed my hand and opened the door.  I thanked her for being helpful (yeah, kind of embarrassing - mho yee see).  I have to laugh at my own foible.", "author": "Carol C."}

Three, four bowls of rice was no big deal and what is trans fat again?!  We'd eat like there was no tomorrow because we'd burn it off playing sports and keeping active.\nAs responsibilities like paying bills and saving for our future became priorities, we were no longer the playahz we thought we were.\nThat's why when you find restaurants that offer lunch or rice plates under $8.00, you take notice.  With my lunch rotation place on vacation, this place came to mind.  My order?  Minced beef and egg over rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=kmYCtvpKT-Fsiw8nBKA8Cg),  Cantonese staple... think scaled down loco moco.  Flavors were solid but I like a little \"kick\" to my food, so added some Yank Sing chili sauce and it was complete.  Sweetness from the peas, salty richness from the oyster sauce, offset by the runny yolk.  Top it with the spiciness and my $7.00 meal brought a Cheshire grin to my face.  Calling it my flavorfied loco moco!\nThe soup was flavorful though one note as there were no other ingredients in my container (suspect it was lotus roots boiled with pork pieces, lean given the broth color.  \nThose growing up in Chinatown will remember this as the third choice for casual American comfort food (Sun Wah Kue and Jackson Cafe being the more popular choices).  They made a KILLER roast pork with gravy and cabbage back in the day.  The crispness of the pork skin and the melt in your mouth tenderness of the pork and fatty trimmings were unbeatable; similar to the now closed Mariposa Cafeteria.  After closing, the chef owner/partner of the unparalleled 1980's Kam Lok (another basement restaurant) broke off and took over this space.  The cuisine stayed the same though the kitchen's skill level slipped a bit.\nSolid budget eat spot with old time cuisine, but might not be a good idea to bring a date here...  unless you are really hurting in the pocketbook.", "author": "Mike C."}

But don't let his deter you, some of their dishes are really good.\n\nHere are some of the things I have tried:\n\nSalt and Pepper Fried Chicken Wings - Very Good\n\nHot and Sour Soup -  I love a good Hot and Sour Soup but I am not wild about theirs. The fermented flavor is stronger than I like for this dish.\n\nBlack Bean Sauce Snails \nThis was the  main reason to be here. This place is known for its snails in black bean sauce. Warning: If you are new to snails they are a little scary looking when you are presented with a huge bowl of them. \n\nBeing an asian snail first timer, I made a few embarrassing mistakes. Hopefully you can do better.\n\nMistake #1.\nFirst make sure you order your snails spicy. I did not get it spicy the first time. Snails are all about texture. The taste is not that remarkable, so you need a bold sauce for it all to work well.\n\nMistake #2\nThe next thing to know is you should not chow into these like you might a french escargot appetizer. French escargots have been cleaned and had the nasty bits removed for you. They don't do that for you in authentic Chinese restaurants. The snails digestive tracts are still attached and taste totally awful. They need to be removed. You only eat the meaty foot bit and not the strange looking sacks that are full of sand and snail poo.\n \nMistake #3\nThis restaurant is generous with their snails. You get a lot of snails. So mistake #3 is If you get #1 and #2 wrong, don't eat all the snails by yourself. You will not feel so good if you eat a big bowl of snail poo.\n\nAfter figuring this all out, the snails here are pretty darned good.\n\nBon Appetit", "author": "David T."}

This place is one of the most authentic restaurant you can get. You can tell just by coming here because they been in business for decades and a lot of the customers are actually locals. Plus... if a Chinese person says that the food that they're paying for is actually better than home-cooked meal, that is saying something. Which happened to my family at this restaurant, and trust me, my mom never says that about any restaurant...even if they're a michelin-starred restaurant. What's even better is that this place is affordable! They have single individual noodle/rice plates that range around $5-8 and family style plates that ranges around $8-12 each (excluding higher range dishes like lobster). The service is great- always attentive and nice. Unlike most restaurants in CT, they do not treat tourists any \"higher\" than a local. \n\nAnyways to food...generally me and my parents order the same dishes so here is a breakdown\n\nRecommended: \n-Seafood + Tofu in a clay pot: my personal favorite. there is a variety of seafood (squid, shrimp, scallops) cooked with fried tofu, mushrooms and lettuce. Love this! Comes hot and stays hot.\n\n-Salt and pepper fried pork chop: would also recommend. Pork chops are fried and tossed with jalapeno peppers and salt. the pork chops are tender and seasoned perfectly.\n\n-minced pork + garlic sauce eggplant in clay pot: my boyfriend's personal favorite. the eggplants are sliced thinly and not even overcooked.\n\n-steamed oysters with black bean: the oysters are fat! they give you about seven and they don't even skimp and give you dead cheap oysters. \n\n\n\"Meh\" dishes:\n-fried flatfish (flounder) : sorry, I don't know what's the fish is called in English but it is deep fried flatfish served over a sugar soy sauce. This is probably the only dish my parents did not like. Major complain is that the fish was not crispy enough.\n\n-shrimp with cashew: we ordered this thinking it was fried shrimp w/ walnuts in that white mayo sauce but some miscommunication and we ended up with this. The cashews were soggy, and overall there wasn't anything special about this dish.\n\n-chinese style snails: my mom's complaint was that it was too salty, my dad's was that there wasn't enough taste. I thought overall it was okay.. but personally this dish wasn't anything special. it simply tastes like snail stir fried with soy sauce.", "author": "Jenny N."}

The thin bones of the fish is fried up as well - so you can eat that too, at your discretion!\n\nSweet and Sour Pork Chops - I like how they deep fry it to a point that it is still crisp and the taste of the  sweet and sour sauce is well made!\n\nAll in all, most of their dishes ordered up here, is generally guaranteed delicious!  It just depends on whether you feel like having something salty, sweet or sour.

When we arrived at the restaurant at 7pm the dining room was about half full. We took our seats at an otherwise empty counter. \n\nAfter placing our order, three other gentlemen, each alone, sat down at the counter and eventually placed their orders.

I asked the waitress several times about our order, and she just pointed to the kitchen and said it was coming. Again and again. \n\nBy the time our food finally arrived at 7:45, we had about 10 minutes to wolf the food down and pay our bill.

It's located in the basement of an old building in Chinatown and you have to take the stairs down into this quaint little restaurant. \n\nSome of the staff did not speak English but they were still helpful and tried their best to communicate with us. I felt kind of bad because I wish I could've communicated with them. Mr. Lee, the manager of the place who does speak English, was very hospitable and attentive to our party of 7. We came in around 9:00 pm. Service was quick as well.\n\nWe ordered Scalloped Fried Rice with egg whites, Snow Pea Shoots with garlic, Deep Fried Flounder, some sort of steamed chicken dish, Hot & Sour soup, Beef Chow Mein with tender greens, and some sort of egg omelette dish, I forgot the name of it. \n\nThe Scalloped fried rice was delicious, a bit too salty for my taste but I liked the flavor on the scallops. The Snow Pea Shoots with garlic was tasty and probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. I just like the combination of garlic and a little bit of soy sauce with vegetables, it's so simple but delicious. The Hot & Sour soup wasn't my favorite. There was something off putting about the taste, I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It just tasted bland and had a weird texture to it. The Beef Chow Mein with greens was delicious as well, I thought the beef was cooked perfectly. My family and I really enjoyed the Deep Fried Flounder that we ordered another dish. The fish was tender and slid right off the bone. We also ordered a steamed chicken dish, it reminded me of Hainanese Chicken (though I'm not too sure if that was the name at this restaurant. I completely forgot what this dish was called). Nevertheless, it was nice and tender and the red sauce that came with it wasn't too spicy. The last dish was some sort of egg omelette with vegetables inside. It was just okay. The omelette itself was a little soggy.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience. My family enjoyed the food as well. I will definitely come back to try some other dishes on the menu. The service was great and one of the reasons why I would come back to this restaurant. It's always nice to have friendly people helping us.", "author": "Andrea S."}

Me and my friend were wondering around the streets of Chinatown, searching for a place that had good noddles for a VERY cheap price. My wallet had only $10 and my friends wallet only held around $5. Thanks to one of those ladies who pass out pamphlets advertising their restaurants, we would of never stumbled across this place. The lady handed us a pamphlet to a different restaurant, but we told her the prices were too much for us. We told her we were looking for a place with amazing noodles and rice dishes for a cheap price. She told us about Woey Loy Goey and that we would like their menu. She proceeded to give us directions and we listened carefully. \n\nWe walked toward Woey Loy Goey and couldn't see the restaurant anywhere. We finally noticed the bright pink menus posted outside, pointing towards a staircase going underground. We looked at each other with a curious smirk and made our way down the stairs.\n\nInside, the restaurant looked like an authentic Chinese Restaurant. The fish tanks and large, circular tables with fresh smelling table clothes was a good sign for me. The waiter handed us our menus, and we were excited to order. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, and my friend ordered the Chow Mein (I think).  \n\nWhen we received our food, I was very pleased with the size. For very little money, I got nice, large, fresh pieces of chicken simmered in an amazing sauce with fresh cashews, vegetables, and white steamed rice. My friends Chow Mein looked just as good. As I finally dug Into my meal, I was even more pleased. I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food, and love the cuisine greatly. Woey Loy Goey lives up to my expectation. \n\nI definitely recommend Woey Loy Goey. The service was fast, food was fresh, and it's cheap, overall great Chinese food.", "author": "Emmanuella Z."}

We had our trusty Yelp App out as we passed restaurant after restaurant. Finally, it came to a boiling point. We were hungry and getting anxious to find a place to sit down and put something into our stomachs. Most places seemed to have either poor or varying reviews. We then came across New Woey Loy Goey and a restaurant a few doors down. New Woey looked a little sketchy, as we'd have to walk down the stairs to a below street level area. The place down a few doors had images of Obama eating there on the outside widow and a long wait. Nope. Back to New Woey. What a surprise! When we entered, we there are only a couple people inside. We were greeted graciously. By the end of our meal, the place was packed with locals. You gotta figure, if the locals are eating there in droves, they know where the good food is. \n\nWe got a couple orders of potstickers, an order of bbq pork fried rice, wonton soup, and a couple orders of chicken chow mein. Everything was real cheaply priced, but we got a mountain of food on our plate. Everything was so freakin' good. I devoured my fried rice and even though bordering on completely full...decided to taste the other plates as my family and friends were full and just about done. Won Ton soup was beyond superb, but the chow mein was out of this world good. \n\nLiving up in Santa Rosa, you think you have good Chinese food in your area until you go somewhere like New Woey Loy Goey. Staff was great and attentive. Just look past the exterior and fact you have to walk down a flight of stairs to an underground area to get through the doors. Inside is a hidden gem of a place where you won't be disappointed. I'm already thinking of a when I can go back.", "author": "Eric M."}

After a horrible day of climbing hills [us Arizonians aren't use to the physical work-out, lol] and battling face-burning winds, we stumbled upon this eatery and boy are we glad we did!\n\nWe had ordered the Tung Lok fried rice, ginger and onion oysters, Szechuan tofu, mustard greens and crab [sauce], and Peking duck.  Now for the breakdown:\n\nTung Lok Friend Rice - This is basically a yung chow friend rice.  It has some peas, multiple meats, and stir-fried using white rice instead of soy sauce drenched fried rice.  It was pretty standard and not too bad!\n\nGinger & Onions Oysters - Delicious but I thought the oysters would be on the half-shell.\n\nSzechuan Tofu - Also delicious!  It had some preserved veggies in it, peas, and some pork bits like an authentic Ma Po Tofu dish.\n\nMustard Greens & Crab - The dish name is kind of deceiving.  This dish DOES have some real crab bits but it's made into an eggy sauce [think of Shrimp & Lobster Sauce].  It's pretty delicious!\n\nPeking Duck - Super delicious!  It's probably my favorite dish.\n\nOverall, the food was excellent and so was the service.  The staff workers are incredibly friendly and strike up pleasant conversation about my last name.

It wasn't the best Chinese food I've tasted, but the soup, stir fry vegetables, and salt and pepper shrimps sure hit the spot. But I wouldn't come here again. Let me tell you about my experience during ONE dine-in.\n\nNow, don't expect spectacular service when you're in an authentic Chinese restaurant. Call yourself lucky if they greet you. The waitresses won't smile at you, but they will serve soup for you. What made this restaurant's service worse than other Chinese restaurants?\n\nFirst of all, they accidentally placed the wrong dish on our table. We ordered a \"meal set\" with this dish, but apparently the \"meal set\" only includes a smaller portion of the particular dish. We started to eat from this dish, and the waiter rudely grabbed the dish from us without saying anything. He didn't apologize or explain his action. We only understood what was going on when they placed the same dish with a smaller portion back on our table. And they still didn't apologize or even speak to us. Rude.\n\nWhile we were eating, we heard screaming. Two ladies were yelling at each other in Chinese; one was a worker, the other was a customer. Apparently, the customer reserved a table, but the worker accidentally seated tourists at this table. The tourists looked confused during the loud argument. The worker finally caved in and told the tourists that the table was reserved. The tourists left angrily. No one could blame them.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the workers found out that a table needed extra chairs. One waitress walked to an occupied table and grabbed a chair without communicating to the customers who were sitting at the table. A nice gesture or a simple \"excuse me\" would've been adequate, but the waitress didn't even bother to look at the customers when she grabbed the chair.\n\nAll this drama within an hour. You know what they say in baseball. Three strikes- and you're OUT! \n\nIf you're looking for cheap Chinese food, and if you're only thinking of dining in and leaving instantly, sure, come here by all means. But if you're not, STEER CLEAR AT ALL COSTS. You've been warned. I'm out.", "author": "Dana S."}

We ordered the pork spare ribs and they were nicely fried. Some pieces were huge and fatty. The salt and pepper flounder was really good too, though perhaps a little too much salt. The chicken with mushrooms mellowed it out. It was in a savory sauce that wasn't goopy. Anyway, definitely worth it and it was just the right portion too. It's good and cheap:\n\nLUNCH DEALS!! $4-5 PLATES!\n\nWarning: The restroom light is outside the restroom.

When I walked in though the server just stared at me from a chair across the room, I didn't know if I was supposed to just pick a table or wait to be seated. Finally after a couple minutes he looks to the woman in charge who was frantically scurrying around and points to us lazily and she helps us out. They weren't very busy at all, only 4 tables were occupied including my friend and I, however they were clearly overwhelmed. It took them 15 minutes after giving us a menu to ever come check on us or anything, however a positive is that the food came out pretty quickly! Well most of it...they brought all three dishes at different times, and it felt more like I was having a three course meal which was a bit of a bummer. They also never brought our water and took another 10 minutes after we finished to get us the check. \n\nThe food, however, was quite delicious. We went with sweet and sour pork, pork egg foo young and cashew nut chicken. It was all very tasty and had authenticity for sure (sweet and sour sauce was amazing, very nice texture-not too thick but not too runny). They had only two people waiting tables, one of which just seemed a bit lost the whole time we were in there, and were definitely overwhelmed. The experience overall was average, service was very poor, but the food was of good quality. I would recommend if you're in China town, but it's not worth any sort of an extra trip to get there and they REALLY need to address their service issues. But if you don't mind waiting awhile, then head over there because the food was pretty good.", "author": "Dan K."}

She even had the nerve to ask for a full tip after I paid.  I told her \"I get half service, you get half tip\".  The gentleman on the other hand was okay but the older waitress lady is just something else.  The reason I give this place two stars is for the food and for the price.  You can get a decent size plate of food for about $5 which is quite nice.  I heard the Salt and Pepper Chicken was all the rave here and that was the only I really came to this restaurant.  After trying the chicken, it was quite tasty and greasy like I expected it but nonetheless it was very flavorful.  As for the kung pao beef dish it came out piping hot as well, but the flavor was pretty generic but better than any Panda Express by my standards.

Thank goodness it did not taste that way. :)\n\nWe had the Beef Chow Fun and the Tong Luk Special Chow Mein with the Hong Kong style crispy noodles (for a buck extra).\n\nThere was nothing to complain about at all: \n\nThe Beef Chow Fun was excellent, not greasy, the beef was tender, and the portion was generous.\n\nSame for the Special: lots of freshly perfectly prepared meats (squid, shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken), Shitake mushrooms, and baby bok choy over crisp pan fried noodles with a nice Hong Kong style brown sauce.\n\nAll this & tea for under $20 (with tip), which in this touristy part of Chinatown is a great bargain.", "author": "Glenn H."}

If you want simple Chinese food, this is a great spot to be. You get a big bowl of complimentary house soup which is a meal in itself and a couple things and you can feed 2 for a little less than $15.

Enough gravy to make sure all parts of the fried rice has a bit of it, but not so much where it was drowned. TONS of scallops and shrimp.\n\nBraised Tofu w/Veggies = TOFU WAS THE BOMB! It was the super soft tofu, that tasted like it was freshly made. All up in a gravy sauce with some bok choy.  To be honest....the gravy kinda tasted the same as the one on my fried rice..but I didn't care cus the tofu was soo good!\n\nMe and my coworker ate until our tummies was given us super muffintop, and there was still half left of each order!

The reason we chose to eat at this restaurant was because of my aunt who found good reviews on yelp and because this place offered parking validation for the local parking garage.\n\nOur visit started off with us going in and asking if they were still serving lunch.  The gentleman who was seating us assured us that yes, they were still serving lunch.  Another gentleman came over to take our order.  Comes to find out, this gentleman told us that lunch prices ended at 2:30pm.  We bit the bullet and stayed and paid the dinner prices.\n\nWhen our meal was over, my aunt asked to get her parking ticket validated.  The server told her he couldn't because the drawer where the stamp was was locked and the owner who had the key for the drawer was not there.  My aunt told him how disappointed she was and told him that the validation was why she came to the restaurant.  She then ask if she could have the cash worth for the 2 hours that the validation was worth.  He got defensive and got dramatic by showing us his empty pockets.  He told us he had no money to give us.  And pretty much he was arguing and yelling at us.\n\nThen my father paid using a credit card.  The server came back and told us the credit card machine wasn't working.  My father told him he didn't have cash.  The server went back and tried again.  And miraculously it worked.\n\nTo wrap it up . . terrible service.  What kind of business argues and yells at their customers?  First, the staff was not on the same page about lunch and dinner times and prices.  Second, if they say they validate parking then they should be able to validate during the hours their business is open.  Third, don't try to be sneaky and say your \"credit card machine is not working\" so you can get cash instead.\n\nMy family will not be coming back here and we will be sure not to tell anyone else to come here either.", "author": "Rosely T."}

We didn't know a specific place and seeing that it all looks dingy and uninviting ( although there was some lady calling us into her restaurant. Literally inviting any non Asian/tourist looking people from across the street. [we didn't go there])we decided to go for the name that stuck out. We went down a few stairs and entered a run down dining room with worn out linoleum and dirty fish aquariums. On one side of the dining room was a long counter where old Chinese men drank tea under a muted tv playing an Asian soap opera . The tables were crammed together and all full of people (and not just Asian). So we figured it didn't only serve weird non Americanized food. The menu was non confusing and the server was a very nice and patient lady. Not only that but even though the place was packed, our order came out quickly and correctly. I didn't go crazy. Got the beef broccoli and a couple egg rolls. It was sooooo tasty! We were all very satisfied and would defiantly go back. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Chinese food but also for those who aren't sure about it. The whole staff was nice. Great experience!", "author": "Joseph K."}

It's not the cloth napkins, it's not the hipster waitstaff, it's not a \"scene\"  with beautiful people getting drunk before the food arrives, it's not the glassware or the silverware.  It's all about the food and how much the people in the kitchen care about what goes out into the dining room.  This restaurant cares.  I've never had a bad meal here, not even a so-so meal.  Always delicious in the way maybe only a Chinese person who grew up with this stuff would appreciate.  The people who eat here come to eat good food.  Not to impress anybody.  Not to have a \"life changing\" experience.  If you want to have an outstanding Chinese meal for a more than reasonable price come here.  If you want to have a \"restaurant experience\" and be fawned over like the VIP you think you are, don't.  The lunch plate of sliced lotus root with pork is amazing, so many levels of texture and taste.  All for less than $5 with tax.  This is a big tip place, because it's worth much more.

It was rainy yesterday when we decided to visit Chinatown, and I had remembered that I had read about this place, so we ducked in to check it out. The restaurant is in a basement just as other reviewers had described, but the place was not dirty or dingy at all! (Much to my surprise) Sure the bathroom may have been, but that is how Chinatown is, what can one expect? Of course there was the Madarin-only menu with better prices, but my friend and I knew what we wanted as soon as we walked in. We ordered the Beef with Tender Greens on Rice (this is a lunch special, but you can have it for dinner for just $1 more).  He also wanted a beer, but I warned him that since there were no prices for beverages, that would would be charged a pretty penny for a tasteless Tsingtao beer; We stuck with the hot tea. The waitress was friendly and comical. The restaurant had about 4 other groups dining (only one of which included a caucasian group he others were Chinese). There were the seedy single men at the bar, but the kept to themselves, so we were not bothered. The meal came fast and STEAMING HOT! also came the check, which I found a bit strange because the server did not ask if we would like dessert...\nI enjoyed the beef. It was tender and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My friend felt that the Bok Choy was too hard to eat and piled most of it on my plate, but I found it to be perfectly cooked. Overall this place gets three stars because I did notice that a group of flies liked to hover in one corner of the restaurant.... weird. The food was pretty good quality for being so cheap. We paid a total of $6.75 for the entire meal (one order was enough for us both) I would still say to just go to King Lee's off of Fillmore or your favorite place because this place is super hard to find unless you know where you are going.", "author": "Antoinette C."}

I remember I came down here once (literally basement level) and just got a noodle dish/item, but don't recall anything else after that.\n\nFirst of all, I clicked on the yelp photo, and the Chinese name/characters is pronounced Tong Lok. How the $#@XYZ did it become New Woey Loy Goey? And they seem to be proud of their Chop Suey too. Perhaps this place does offer the moo shoo poo poo chop soo goo goo broo hoo hoo doo doo stuff, but no thanks, I'll just stick with the classics. \n\nNon Cantonese speakers are going to have so much fun with the pronounciation. Woey probably is pronounced closer Wui, and not wooo-eee, and Goey is certainly not gooey/goo-weee which can be very visually unappetizing.\n\nThis place certainly has interesting and decent stir fry rice plates, noodles, and maybe noodle soups, also at good value, but it is definitely not refined like in Hong Kong, although they are similar to that old Hong Kong flavor in the usage of MSG to some extent (and in cases here probably more heavily so). Perhaps their food is somewhat simliar to Hong Kong stir fry/rice/noodle plates in the 60s/70s or even the 50s, in another perspective. Again we go back to old Chinatown, old receipes that eventually revolved to localized tastes (at times bigger portions), generation after generation with some whitewashing down here and there, and maybe additions to the menu for the moo shoo doo doo fans. Xth gen Chinese Americans will certainly love it here or have fond memories coming to places like here as kids, and low gen / homesickers like quite a few of us, will probably find a bit of that special old country flavor here.\n\nSadly the skankiness of Chinatown is part of the dining experience.

Though the bathroom was as terrible as the other reviews describe.\n\nService was minimal but adequately efficient. Friendlier than i expected. My friend and I got a free bowl of soup!\n\nA lot of old Chinese people and Chinese families were there, a good sign for authenticity.\n\nConsider me a regular!", "author": "K C."}

At one point we were here almost every single week. The owners and workers are always nice. Their food portions are pretty big for the price they charge.   Every time we come here we either get the Peking spareribs or the salt & pepper spareribs.  Thinking of it makes my mouth watery now!", "author": "Alexis T."}

The food was excellent, the service was friendly, fast and helpful.  We really enjoyed this place and would definitely go back.\n\nGreen beans with garlic (not on menu, but we asked for them) were very garlicy and wonderful.  Seafood combo was yummy, cashew chicken, all excellent.", "author": "Sherry B."}

I've passed this place often but never entered; today I went down the front steps to investigate...  it was worth it! The restaurant was crowded with asian groups and even some tourists who seemed to be enjoying their food. The tables were filled with plates of food, and the air was bustling with small talk from everyone - I was happy. Ordered a beef wonton soup - hey, it's COLD! Also ordered a plate of beef with thick chinese noodles with broccoli; both were served quickly and steaming hot!! I was in and out within 40minutes, and even drank two cups of tea and paid LESS than $25, with leftovers to take home and enjoy later! Cannot beat that!!! No parking but worth the walk!", "author": "Tony L."}

So we turned down a side street and found this place.  The menu looked good (plus we were really hungry) so we went down.  I ordered the curry chicken plate and she had vegetables and rice.  It was pretty good, and I figured if the old Chinese men were in there, it couldn't have been bad.", "author": "Geoff Y."}

First , when I got there around 6pm, there were only have few people dinning in. the restaurant was messing. It took me more than 40mins for 4items. \nwhen I paid for it, it seems that bill was higher than supposed to be, I have questioned the waiter and he mentioned that for \"Togo\" orders, customer have to paid for container which never mentioned at first place, that's fine, but when I went home and found out they \"Extra Charged\" \n\nI will never never go to this dishonest restaurant ... so sad for this Cheating place!!", "author": "J C."}

I was a bit disgusted that downstairs I think one of their pipes had burst and it was oozing water..but once you got over it, the foood was great at lunch time with very cheap prices. I liked the wonton soup we had and also fried rice - I forgot which type it was but it wasn't on the lunch menu... a bit more expensive. Overall a great deal @ lunch, prob not the premiere place for dinner, but I'd come back for a cheap chinese lunch!", "author": "Jeannette L."}

Also the plate lunch had some clumpy and hard rice bits.  It made me think they were recycling leftover rice from rice containers on other people's tables.  I didn't get sick but it's not good to be worrying about that while eating either.  This is hole in the wall should remain hidden.", "author": "Edmund W."}

This place is kind of hidden because its underground downstairs but I love this place ! Never would of thought a place like this would serve such good food . The chili pepper beef chow fun was really tasty . It was full flavor and spicy just the way I like it . The tender green with steak cubes was good . The greens were well cooked and full of flavor but the steak cubes were really hard to swallow . The eggplant with salted fish in clay pot was my favorite . It too salty like a lot of other places .. but just right . It looks oily and everything but it's really good ! You can really taste the salted fish . They put just the right amount of flavor in it . The food here is anything but dull . Prices are reasonable .  Don't see much young people here because I think it's targeted mainly to older folks . A great place to go for a family dinner . I love the atmosphere of this place . This hole-in-the-wall is definitely worth a try ! I promise you wont be disappointed .", "author": "Eileen L."}

All the seafood dishes are very fresh and tasty.  Lunch is very good and portions are again very large.  Highly recommend this place for anyone who loves authentic Cantonese cooking.", "author": "Linda C."}
