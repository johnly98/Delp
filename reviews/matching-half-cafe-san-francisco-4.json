We got in line behind a man and his daughter who appeared to know the woman working the counter as they had a long conversation in Hebrew as he ordered. \n\nAfter they ordered and walked away, the woman behind the counter stood there for a good three minutes waving and making faces at the child who was now sitting at a table just outside of the cafe. Meanwhile, a line had formed behind me that went all of the way out of the door and onto the sidewalk. Yet she continued to make faces at the child. Eventually, she took a cookie out from a jar and walked it to the child before coming back inside (by now there were approximately 15 people in line behind me). \n\nWhen she got to the counter, she looked at me and said \"what?\"\n\nNo \"hello\". No \"good morning\". No \"what would you like to order?\" Just \"What?\" as though I was annoying her by being there. \n\nI ordered a latte and a buttered bagel, my wife ordered a latte and asked the woman whether or not she could get a bagel with avocado. The woman responded \"It's on the menu, you can read it\" Yes, we had the menu with us and it was confusing as to whether or not it was an option so my wife sought clarification only to receive a condescending response.\n\nI cannot remember the last time someone was so rude to us at a coffee shop, restaurant or any service industry position. It was mind blowing. It felt like she had a grudge against us for something but we had never been here before and had never seen this woman before. \n\nBeyond unacceptable way to treat customers. If I could give zero stars, I would. \n\nFinally, after being second in line only to wait over 15 minutes we had finally placed our order only to wait another 15-20 minutes for them to make two simple bagels!  \n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the coffee was average at best, and the bagels were stale.", "author": "James A."}

This spot was quiet and looked decent enough so I grabbed a menu and ordered the salami panini. I paid and warmed a seat by the window while I waited. Then the cashier announced they were out of salami. Slightly bummed but an easy fix since I already had a second choice in mind... the apple and brie panini. \n\nMoments later a plate with a good looking panini was placed in front of me. I assumed the panini would taste as good as it looked and I was correct. The bread was crisply toasted without being so hard that it shaves the inside of your mouth. The brie was delectable and they gave a generous ratio of brie to apple and arugula. The honey sweetness on top made this a 5 star package because every bite got increasingly better. I would love to make this at home!\n\nAside from the 5 star panini, I also liked the staff and overall feel of the venue. It's a small establishment but comfortable and the staff made it more relaxing with polite chat. I noticed the male cashier initiated conversation with every customer and everyone ordering looked so happy during their stay and upon leaving. I don't think he was the owner (he seemed a bit too young) but he seemed to have a genuine like for his job which made my experience there better. \n\nI already know I'm bringing my friends here again soon and will be ordering the brie apple panini again and again.", "author": "Kristy F."}

It's a hard stale bagel with an egg and a slice of avocado on it. What? Didn't even add cheese. Next time they straight up put ham on it instead of avocado.

It's also situated interestingly on a hill and has decent outdoor tables, but I said two things and I'm sticking with two things.\n\nEverything else about this place is annoying.  It's expensive.  Food takes forever to come out.  Portions are anorexic-model-in-training meager.  It's frequented by all the annoying people who have moved into my neighborhood in the past five years.  It's uncomfortable inside.\n\nIt reminds me a lot, in fact, of One World Cafe, which it replaced, in a way.  But whereas One World Cafe was merely disappointing, Matching Half Cafe is disappointing, annoying, and pretentious--and that's a pretty good description of how my neighborhood has gotten worse since 2011.", "author": "John S."}

Here's a quick breakdown:\n\nPROS\n-Great food, great coffee, AWESOME baked goods\n-Nice vibe, lots of natural sunlight\n-Friendly staff \n-Very clean and pleasant bathroom\n-Outdoor seating available\n-Right on the 5 bus line\n-ALCOHOL (wines and beers)\n\nCONS\n-No power sources\n-Long wait times\n-Limited seating area\n\nEssentially, this place is fabulous as a spot to get a jammin cup of java and to enjoy a pleasant breakfast, brunch, or lunch with a friend. The food is great, vibe is chill, and the overall quality of the establishment is great if you can get past the fact that the friendly staff just kinda take a while to get orders out. \n\nThis is a BAD place if you want to camp out to get a bunch of work done with your computer. Yes, there are outlets. No, they're not going to charge your electronics.They turned off the power sources for a reason. I can understand this from a business perspective. They don't want you camping out for 10 hours taking away precious table space. They want to flip those tables and keep the money coming in to stay in business. I get it. I can't hold that against them. \n\nI do have to say that my Lox bagel did take a good 15-20 minutes and it was not extremely busy. But then some other people around me got their food within 5 minutes of ordering, so it's not like ALL of their orders come out super late. Just keep timing in mind if you're in a rush.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back to this place for a light meal/date with a friend, but definitely not to get work done unless I'm going all paper.", "author": "Cara O."}

Quiet neighborhood with low traffic and not much street noise. They have a serious cookie collection and homemade poptarts (nutella??? dayum!!). I like the old skool ice-cream-parlor countertop seating, and there are lovely stained glass windows that filter in blue light. Tea/coffee + a pastry will run you $5 - $7. They have the requisite milk-ish options: skim, almond, soy. Downsides are that the seating is limited, there aren't any (working) outlets if you want to plug in, and the wait can be long if you come at the wrong time. Oh, and if it's cold and rainy they won't close the door because \"the windows fog,\" so bring a coat.

They can also make you a lox salad since they keep smoked salmon on hand to make lox bagels; nice if you don't eat bagels/sandwiches yet still love meat.\n\nOther fun things to do here:  Order a banana when they're super ripe and spotty brown; goes great with espresso drinks with milk less the or equal to cappuccino level.  Check out their changing arrangement of artwork every few months.  Currently, it's an installation of small canvases with colorful, dancy geometric patterns.  Sit down next to their card/flyer section when you're flying solo.  Peruse the various yoga instructor, tech startup, meditation, photography, acupuncture, and other curious services available.  If you come on the sunday streets day, they typically have a cool live band playing.  Last time it was an quirky, malt shop doo-wop set.  \n\nFinally a word of advice: The food here is best for snacking and less for lunching/brunching, so have the right expectations in mind.

However, if you come with a large party, expect to split up. There's limited indoor seating and most of the tables are tables of 2. There's only one large table that fits up to about 8 if you squish.\n\nIt took a while for me to find the menu, but they have it on the table by the cashier. They also take card. So you don't have to worry if you have enough cash or finding an ATM.\n\nTheir food is really good! I had their grilled cheese. Their breakfast sandwich is quite popular. I saw many people order it. I had a bite from my friend's and it was delicious. The breakfast sandwich and the grilled cheese was quite large. I couldn't finish it. Their sandwiches range around 6-8 dollars. They also have baguette sandwiches which my friend said was delicious, she had the salami, and it was smaller in size if you don't have much of an appetite.\n\nThey also have quite a variety of house coffees. Their drips range from 2.50-4 dollars. I haven't tried their espresso.\n\nThey provide a bathroom, plus! Another nice little thing they have are hooks under the bar table so you can hang your bag, convenient if you bring a book bag or purse.\nDownside, they only had one outlet, but there was a little sign that said no power on top so I didn't bother to try to see if it worked. So bring a fully charged laptop or extra batteries, or a book.\n\nYou will also have to find street parking. There's lots of metered parking, but if you venture out another block or so there are also residential areas.

I think in addition to typical coffee shop pastries they do serve sandwiches and salads, but I've never tried them. \n\nI've never actually hung out there (I've just popped in and out), but it's a cute little location with a friendly staff.

Your latte will get made with real milk, and it's slow steamed one cup at a time (not in a big bucket like at Starbucks, which is how they can make 20 at a time). It's then slow poured over the espresso shots (every drink comes as a double) until you get that pretty leaf  appearance on the top.

Again, it's not the fastest cup of coffee in the world, but this isn't that kind of place either.\n\nThey also have some hot breakfast foods there now too, like bagels with egg and stuff on it, in addition to the pastries they already had.

Ahhhh, coffee.\n\nThis is the first coffee place I've gone to since moving into my new apartment in SF (though not the first SF coffee place I've been to in general), because it's only about a block and a half from my place...and I couldn't be happier.  This is the kind of coffee I'll be excited to grab every morning before heading to my MUNI stop.  \n\nTo give you a sense of the prices -- a latte's $3.25, a mocha's $3.50.  Drip coffee's $2.  \n\nI'm looking forward to trying their other drinks, and their food selection at some point.  I just couldn't hold myself back from an immediate yelp for this stellar mocha!  (FYI, the coffee drinks on the menu are what they've got -- no flavor shots and such-like...which is cool with me, but I'm putting it out there in case you're a vanilla-latte-only type of person, or something like that.)\n\nThey were under-staffed for a holiday, but you wouldn't have known it by wait time -- they got my drink to me quickly.  And even so, the guy who took my order and made my drink apologized to me for their being busy/under-staffed!  He and his co-worker were entirely friendly, super polite, ready to help.\n\nThe place feels cosy and warm, perhaps due partly to the blond wood and quality of light streaming in -- it had a golden quality to it, really attractive and pleasant.

I order a latte, turkey sandwich with a side salad for a total of about 13.00 and change.  Not cheap but for the city in a small cafe its about average.  My latte comes in what we used to refer to as a tea cup.  Its beautiful and hot but way to strong for me.   I go to the counter and ask  them to transfer into a coffee cup and add more milk.   The manager tells me they can't do that.  They have agreed to sell only one size of latte.  I ask again, please pour it into a coffee cup and add some more milk.  I have a gastric issue and it will only cause me pain about 20 minutes after drinking it.   He says they that they can't do that.  He offered to pull me a short shot (in the same sort of cup) and it will have more milk.  I don't want that.  I want all the caffeine but I want it diluted.   He absolutely refused.. I reminded him I am the customer and he said, yes, I AM the customer but they will not sell a latte in a bigger cup.   I offered to pay for the extra milk.  Again, they refuse to sell a latte in a larger cup.    OK folks, is it me????  I told him that I would not  be coming back and I wanted a refund on my coffee.  Instead of keeping a customer he still refused to transfer my latte into a larger cup and gave me a refund on my latte.    I work for a very large retail store, customer service is the top most importance.  We've had to do some stupid things because our customs were demanding.  Nothing that cost a lot of money for the store but its hard to let the customer get one over one you. Especially when you both know they are.   In this case I was not.  I just wanted a bit more milk in my latte.\n\nThis guy is good at what he does and never raised his voice or became rude.  I appreciate that.  The sandwich was very good and the side salad was worth the money.   I think their espresso might even be very good too.    \n\nThe young man who was my server was also very sweet and offered to get me something else to drink and apologized for the inconvenience.  All in all it would have been an excellent review if not for their silly customer service issues.\n\nStill, I won't be coming back.

Espresso drinks are smaller than some might like, but they're so delicious it's worth it (think Blue Bottle style). The food is good too. I especially like the turkey sandwich, and the fruit and granola for breakfast time. \n\nThey have free WiFi too (but only one plug, and it's not close to most of the tables). Basically everything about this place is great. You can sit and study, eat good food, and they have beer and wine, outside seating, and they played all the World Cup games.

It looks snobby inside, and you'll probably not be greeted by the staff because they are sort of snobby too.  The first time I went, i ordered a cofee to go.  That's IT.  15 minutes later, i had a cup of coffee in a small paper cup.  It was super hot and they don't have any of those sleeves to protect your hands.  They didn't appologize that it took that long for a cup of coffee.  I could have easily walked to the supermarket, and brewed my own in half that time.  But instead i paid 2 dollars for a small cup of insane coffee.  It was very strong and thus, made me insane.\n\nI wanted to give them a chance to redeem themselves, so I returned a week later with my boyfriend.  The service was a bit friendlier.  Boyfriend ordered an egg and cheese on a bagel, they only had 2 options for bagels.

Would you rather be able to sit in here for 2-3 hours(of battery life) and enjoy a sandwich, pastry or espresso; or would you rather not be able to take a set at all because the 6 early birds have been camped out for hours on end with an endless power supply.\n\nThe Food:\nI am always skeptical of new food places, part of being OCD. However, I did have a tomato, moz and basil sandwich there a few weeks ago and fell in love, I now have one at least twice a week. Same goes with the breakfast sandwich. Add a little tomato and it's perfect. Throw that fucker on a croissant and POW!\n\nVerdict on appeal:\nStill one of my favorite places to spend an afternoon. Start of with a sandwich and espresso.

Sunny outdoor seating and a clean indoor appearance makes matching half appealing, BUT more important is a quality product and customer service both of which are lacking here. They serve a Latte in a 8oz to-go cup, better know as an 'Africano' because they believe this to be the benchmark for proportions and something that sets them apart from the multitude of coffee shops in the area. Normally this would be fine because if you wanted you could ask for a larger cup and that is what you would get. Not at Matching half though! They believe so strongly in their idealistic proportion rule that they are willing to have an argument over it thus losing valuable business over a silly principle. Believe me I have tested them on many occasion in hopes they would step up and understand how to properly serve the needs and wishes of their customers only to be met with arrogance or some stupid excuse like 'the larger cup doesn't fit' or 'our milk steamer can is the size of a thimble' or 'we take our coffee seriously and that isn't how you are supposed to have it' or 'we've run out of larger cups' when you can see them behind the incompetent barista who on average takes somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes minimum to make your drink. Cutting off the nose to spite ones face it seems and far from making friends. \n\nCoffee shop snobbery and an establishment which offends it's customers with it's overt incompetence is not where i would choose to spend my daily 4 dollars and would advise others to think twice about supporting this place. They are rude and defensive purveyors of marginally decent coffee that pales in comparison to Mojo, Ritual, Blue bottle, Apollo, and Cafe Abir which is just around the corner. Remember Matching half people...without the support of your local community you have nothing.\n\nPS let us all remember as well that out of the 51 or so reviews the lion share come from friends and relatives of the owners. For a place that displays such high levels of SUCK i can't imagine that there are 50+ people out there who honestly like POOR service and are willing to overlook fundamental flaws in every aspect of this type of small business.

She and long time boyfriend Jason hand made the tables and bar and they're so sleek and sophisticated. The chairs were modern and comfortable too, and the glasswear is gorgeous and displayed tastefully. The menu is smart and simple, and done really well. My fav is the breakfast special - for somewhere around 6-8 bucks (my bad for not paying complete attention to the price) you can score a delicious breakfast egg sandwich on brioche and a PBR.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-01", "description": "I would really like to recommend this cafe, especially because in theory it's an excellent addition to the neighborhood.  After another bad experience, however, I'm avoiding it and keeping my fingers crossed that the owners either hire someone to help them with operational and customer service issues, or figure it out very quickly on their own so they retain their currently enthusiastic clientele.  For now, I recommend you stay away unless you like getting high blood pressure in the morning and have a lot of time to spare so you've got \"cushion time\" should your order get screwed up - very likely - and need time for a \"do over\".\n\nThe Bad:\n-If you handle money, cashier person, DON'T handle food with your dirty hands -- it's gross.\n-It's sad that such a beautiful cafe should be filled inside and out with piles of dirty plates, cups, etc.  It was amusing when one of the owners, as she slowly made espresso drinks, kept apologizing that they were out of plates.  Um...get someone to buss and stock.  \n-You can't serve coffee and espresso drinks and not have regular sugar.  Not acceptable.  I don't care if you are \"out\".  No excuses.\n-None of the baristas seem to have had any training and this has made for lukewarm drinks and VERY SLOW service.  \n-I ordered a wheat bagel with cream cheese at 10:15 a.m., and they were already out of cream cheese, but I wasn't notified until ten minutes after I placed my order.  I was told it would be awhile before they got more.  (How about a quick trip to the convenience store across the street?)  I switched my order to wheat, cheese and egg.  I got a cinnamon raisin with cheese and egg.  After having waited 20 minutes for my food I took a deep breath and notified one of the owners, and he took care of the mistake quickly.  By then I needed it to go, and I was done with my latte.  Mistakes happen, but they've got to be handled quickly.  So far, there is nothing quick about the Matching Half Cafe.\n-Admittedly annoying and picky comment:  the font of the sign hanging outside would look great on on a business card...just not on a large sign.  It makes my eyes involuntarily cross every time I look at it.\n\nAs someone who has worked in a cafe, I totally get that it can take awhile to work out the kinks -- but the timeframe for getting it right better be a super fast one.  Otherwise the novelty of this beautiful cafe will wear off quickly, no matter the pleasantness of the owners or the quality of coffee.  I already had a couple of great choices for coffee and bagels, and I'm happy to stick to them.\n\nThe Good:\n-No discernible attitude among the employees.\n-Most beautiful cafe bathroom I've ever seen.\n-Lots of light inside, and lots of seating outside.\n-The promise of a good afternoon/evening spot for beer and wine.\n-Nice owners with good intentions.", "author": "G.

Great coffee, great food. 3 stars.\" \nThese people, obviously don't know much about the mcbaker intersection, and have obviously no memory of the terrible two, neon and one world. God damnit these places sucked so bad that it was enough to make someone walk/ride to divis to get a decent coffee. I do say decent, not good because divis doesn't have good coffee. \n\nThat's right, this is easily the best coffee in Western Addition. And I dare you to argue with me on this. Don't even think about mentioning Mojo or Abir. Oh shit, Please don't mention Abir. That shit hole is the absolute worst. I feel like I'm on stage every time I go in there. At least, it's the worst next to the now deceased neon and one world. Anyways, let's not get off topic here. \n\nWhy is this new place good? Hand made, drip coffee made with amazing coffee beans. One of a kind espresso and cappuccinos. Superb food, amazing decor, great music. Crap man, what else do you want in a coffee shop? Not to mention how nice the staff is. \n\nYes, they're new, yes they are working out small kinks, but this place is already top notch. And they're only going to get better. I just can't wait until people start talking about how great this place is months from now. \"Have you been to Matching Half? It's my favorite coffee shop.\" That's what they'll say. I'll just respond, \"Yeah, no shitJohnny come lately, I loved it originally. When it wasn't so damn cool to love it.\" That's what I'll say.", "author": "scotty s."}

Cafe Abir went through all those months of renovation and somehow got worse, and Mojo just isn't my scene.\n\nMatching Half cafe changes all that. This is hands down the best coffee in the neighborhood (and I would argue a larger territory), they have a great selection of awesome, affordable beer and wine, and a really solid food menu. The decor is simple, beautiful, and bright. The staff is nicer than you could ever imagine. \n\nSeriously, go. You'll love it.", "author": "Gavin W."}

Rich, dense, smooth, perfectly moussey foam - it's divine.\n\nFit out\nThe interior is lovely, simple and stylish - what, no cheese? It's a classy fit-out, and about time San Francisco got some of that. That said, they could do with some more art on the walls and it was also a little warm in there on an indian summer late morning. I adore the wall planter. (4/5)\n\nFood\nLooks like they're doing the \"let's wait to order food til we see how many customers we have\" thing. Which means that the food ran out REALLY early on the weekend and I didn't get to eat anything. Excusable for a first weekend, and I really hope they fix it. (-/5)\n\nStaff\nThe baristas are wonderful, and everyone is very friendly. It seems like a few of the younger girls are getting their ocean legs, but hopefully they'll pcik up soon. I would also recommend that they figure out what they're doing about table service - it's not clear how/who is clearing tables. (3/5)\n\nCoffee\nIf this place scored zero on everything else I would still come here for the coffee. I'm a MASSIVE coffee snob and their espresso is a beautiful thing to behold. It made me very, very happy (5/5)\n\nOverall, I'm super excited that this place has opened up, and I look forward to watching them learn and grow. Good luck Matching Half Cafe!!", "author": "Terese S."}

As I walked in there was no one to be found over the counter, I waited for a couple of minutes for someone to show up. I asked for coffee over ice, and the \"barista\" replied offended: \"we don't do that here\". Then I asked kindly for a cup of coffee and a glass with ice ad she still answered with an attitude. Fine, I said, give me a cup of coffe, a glass with ice and I'll fix my drink when you are not watching. She looked at me confused and proceeded with making the coffee. Later, she charged me for the coffe and she was still rude.I would like to ask the Manager to be more selective while hiring, as this chubby, blondish little prick needs to learn how to deal with customers.

But of course, as long as the customers  swan all around, and are misled in to thinking that this is part of the thing that makes it \"chic\"... well, then it will continue. I've given them lots of chances, and wondered if at first it was just me-- but I have had other people say the same thing. It comes down to this: it's a \"top down\" problem (and potentially, solution.) But after going in again today to see the same crap from the owner and the crew working around her-- I realize it's not going to change (unless customers demand it).

It's best when they aren't busy and they are able to make a drip coffee from scratch. \n\nThank goodness they have bar seating which is usually available. It can be frustrating and a total bummer when you expect to just sit for 10 minutes with a coffee and a quick bit, and laptops are spread out everywhere. That being said- the visitors to this cafe are pretty chill and seem to sit to the back large table and leave the smaller tables or bar free. Also there is no where to plug a computer in, and that keeps traffic moving (great idea!) \nGreat granola- definitely expensive for a breakfast, but it's a nice weekend treat. It's definitely much fresher than other cafes, and they use good yogurt/honey.\n I love their salads and the unusual paninis. I've never had the egg bagel, but it looks pretty good. \nThe owners are always really happy and polite, however some of the newer hires have been a little intimidating to order from. This cafe always seems so upbeat, happy, efficient, so the grumpy barista's should go get a job at Cafe Tude where they indulge in giving halfass service.\n (ie: one day they were out of the yogurt for the granola bowl, so she said in her rough tone she said they were all out - but the owner stepped in quickly and said he could use milk if we wanted, which was fine with us.

I had seen this place before it turns into the cafe it is today, and I think the owners did a great job to transform this space.  The space is welcoming, lots of light.  And the use of space is great, lots of seating, and the place is clean overall.  The first problem I had was the cappuccino.  The milk wasn't frothed properly.  The top was covered with large bubbles, instead of a nice shinny microfoam.  Second problem is with the pastry.  I know they don't make it themselves.  I ordered the nutella pop tart made by Black Jet.  After I cut it in halves, one half of it has no nutella at all.  May be the pop tart was heated in a toaster, so when it was heated, all the nutella went to the bottom halve.  Before I left, I showed the leftover of the half pop tart to the staff.  I told her that there's no filling in it.  She looked at the opened up pop tart, didn't say anything, and walked away.
