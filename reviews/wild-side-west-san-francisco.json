The bar has a wonderful funky vibe inside, and I felt pretty welcome there immediately.  As soon as we walked in a table of ladies were sitting at one of the tables near the entrance, the immediately engaged myself and my family in some light hearted ribbing.\n\nThe bartenders were all nice and the drink prices were good.  We didn't sit on the patio, which is apparently very nice, because we didn't realize until we were leaving that there is a second area other than the spot you can see right from the door.\n\nAlthough this is a \"lesbian bar\" it also has a neighborhood bar vibe to it as well.  I saw plenty of straight couples there in addition to the LGBT patrons.", "author": "Nicole S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "Last night was the second and LAST time stepping foot into Wild Side West, the treatment that my friends, fianc\u00e9 and I received from the female Caucasian bartender was nothing short of discriminatory, rude, and borderline racist. We left the bar with sentiments of humiliation, embarrassment, and complete disappointment.\nFirst, I'd like to point out that, as a member of the LGBT community, for a lesbian bar that has been around for years, screaming liberation on their walls in a sanctuary city and has a big sign that welcomes all race, age, gender, religion etc. the bartender's actions last night spoke exactly the opposite of what a lesbian bar in San Francisco is supposed to represent however, by the other reviews I've read, I might not have been the only one that has had an unforgettable experience. \nMy Fianc\u00e9 and I came in for a couple of drinks last night and to play pool, (her grandparents/family have been living in the Bernal Heights neighborhood for decades) we hung out waiting for our turn for the pool table and a couple of friends; from the start the bartender wasn't entirely friendly (ok no big deal, maybe she's having a bad night). I was at the bar ordering my second drink by the time our friends arrived, the moment they walked in she was watching them waiting for her chance to check ID's, of course that's your job; do that. I've just never seen any bartender so eager to check someone's ID before (from that point on the bartender started to get very agitated, one of the ID's happened to be a passport because my friend is from Guatemala). My fianc\u00e9 was at the pool table getting ready for our game of pool when the bartender asked what they wanted to drink and the designated driver politely said he was just going to be playing pool and his boyfriend was good for the moment and still deciding, then she says extremely rude \"IT'S A BAR GUYS YOU GOTTA ORDER DRINKS OR YOU GOTTA GO\" ok, so at that point I gave my 2nd drink that I just BOUGHT to my friend that's not driving so that issue was solved. We were going to play our game of pool that we just PAID FOR and leave because in all of my years of going to bars with friends and one person out of the group isn't drinking because we're trying to get home SAFE and the other hasn't decided what he wanted yet, NEVER has it been a big deal. She kept harassing us saying \"IT'S A BAR GUYS\" yeah, clearly we know where we came? So, I asked her \"Why is it a huge issue? We bought drinks except one person that's driving? And we're paying to play pool?\" and with no logical or reasonable explanation she said \"If you don't like it then you can all leave!\" Even the other people at the bar stared and seemed a little uncomfortable. I was very shocked to be treated this way, the bartender kept staring us down to see if we were leaving then came from behind the bar to the pool table to tell us a 2nd time that if we weren't buying anything then we must leave even though I just bought a drink from her and gave it to my friend, does it matter who bought it? We skipped out on our pool game and left. At this point it's clear we were not welcome and it just so happens we were the only people of color in the bar that were not accompanied by a white person and the only people that were getting approached like this, it was humiliating, dehumanizing, discriminating, and flat out wrong. People come to this city to get away from inequality issues, not to get treated like this, it shouldn't be ok anywhere but we wouldn't have expected this type of service at a lesbian bar. There are still gaps to be filled within the LGBT community itself and experiences like these make it so much harder for people to come together in a time when the world is so full of hate and divide. To the owner of Wild Side West (god forbid if that bartender was the owner) make sure you have bartenders representing what you preach on your walls because this is so much more than just a bar for some people, it could be a haven but disappointingly enough there is no safe space here for people of color.", "author": "Angelica V."}

As one of the last (and oldest) lesbian locales in the city, it has a special kind of charm and magic that really make queers like me feel at home. \n\nMy girlfriend and I came by on a Tuesday evening just looking for a beer before grabbing dinner. We sat at the bar and were served promptly by a friendly bartender. \n\nThey have pretty basic beers on tap (Guinness, Anchor Steam and the like) as well as some well distributed crafts like Deschutes Fresh Squeezed and a rotating Fort Point. They've got a full bar and cans / bottles as well, plus chips if you're needing something to tide your tummy over. \n\nThe real magic of this place is the whimsical decor, welcoming atmosphere and the lovely mix of humans (I especially enjoy how many older lesbians frequent the place!). The back patio / secret garden is an absolutely magical setting that will have you questioning whether you're really in the middle of a metropolitan city. You really have to experience it for yourself. \n\nLike I said, I love that this is an absolutely welcoming dive -- sometimes you want to play a round of pool or just drink a cheap beer at the bar and stare at a TV without having to listen to drunken male conversation or worry about watching your back as a queer woman. Wild Side West provides that opportunity. \n\nI am concerned with the recent bad experiences with bartenders I've read from other Yelpers -- I'm glad I got lucky on a good day but I really hope management at Wild Side will take those to heart and weed out / correct any misogynistic or overtly, unnecessarily rude behavior from their staff.", "author": "Alex K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-07", "description": "I've been coming to Wild Side West for about 6 or 7 years and I am deeply sadden by last night (possibly racist, but certainly disappointing) experience. I've happen to only come here with white people in the past and never had any issues. Last night was different. \n\nAfter a queer girl party @ El Rio, I wanted to take my friends (who happen to be black) to the first place myself and my girlfriend went on a date 2 years ago. Having just stopped for ice cream (we weren't drunk) I thought a sip in their garden would be magical. \n\nWhen we first approached the door, I asked the young woman with the shaved head and piercings if the backyard was still open. \"Oh yeah, of course\" she waved me off. I said \"Yes, but I know it closes at 10p, right?\" Looking down at my watch I saw it was about ten to 9p. \"It'll close at 10ish/10:30p tonight\" is what she said. \n\nHaving confirmed the garden was open, I ushered myself and 4 friends inside, excited. \n\nMy friends have never been there before, so before we ordered drinks I wanted to secure my favorite spot in the garden. We walked downstairs, and after checking a few nooks, we found a spot. As we are putting our things away and getting settled, the same person from the door approaches us. \n\n\"My manager sent me. You have to buy drinks if you want to be here\" \n\nNo problem really, but it was a bit creepy, seeing as we were tucked in this fold and she came right to us. I told her as much. \n\n\"Yes, there are cameras everywhere. She's watching me right now.\" \n\nUH OK SUPER CREEPS. We all started to look around in the trees. I had never seen a camera there, ever. But I understand you have to buy drinks to kick it. We send a couple of friends to buy drinks so we can hold down the spot. \n\nAfter they get back with rounds, my friends try to teach me how to play rummy using a deck of cards. About 15 minutes after we get our drinks, the same girl approaches us: \n\n\"My manager is upstairs and says it's too loud. I have to close the garden. I've opened the deck for you though\" \n\nSurprised I say \" I thought that the garden didn't close until 10p? It's 9:40p\" \n\nDoor person (and bartender) says: \"Bar time is different\" as she is walking away. \n\nNow, what in the BLAZES does that mean? \n\nThe vibe was: black voices carry, and we don't want to hear yours. \n\nConfused, we gather our things. \n\nThinking that maybe she hadn't accounted for daylight savings time, I mention that she said the back wouldn't close until \"10ish\" and that it's only 9:40p. I also mention I've been coming here for about 6 years and the garden has always closed at 10p, quiet hours. \n\nPerhaps the door person/bartender was trying to be cool with us, but it just came off as condescending to be called \"boo\" (equivalent to \"sweetie\") as she dodged the question and said they are working on getting a permit to allow the garden to remain open all night. \n\n\"We have to keep the neighbors happy\" said door person/bartender. \n\n\"Yes, but the garden is always open until 10p, the time you told me walking up\". She said nothing. \n\nMy friends and I tried to make it work on the patio, but the magic of the garden was lost. We left in silence, and I was embarrassed to have taken my friends to one of the last \"lesbian bars\" in SF. \n\nWild Side West: although there aren't many black folks in SF, we are still here. I was hoping that it was okay to be black, queer, and have a good time within your bar, but it didn't feel safe at all, and pretty much we weren't left alone the whole time we were there. I guess El Rio it is from now on. \n\nI still have all the loving memories, including the first date with my girlfriend (who happens to be white) 2 years ago and I suppose those will have to suffice.", "author": "Mercedes G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-10", "description": "So reading a lot of peoples bad reviews on this bar is pretty sad. For one, this bar has been here for years as well as a ton of good people. INCLUDING all the bartenders. \nThe first time I came to this bar, the girl with the shaved head &piercings was such a sweetheart to me. I ordered my drink &decided to start up a conversation with her. Didn't have any problems. \n\nCan't really understand why some people on these reviews I'm reading are calling her a racist &condescending? I never really got that impression, so I'm a bit confused. She, nor any of the bartenders I've had really gave me that vibe. \n\nI was told that they had a garden &patio so I went to check it out. She said they close it at 10, so I said \"Ok, cool just let me know when it's time.\" It was absolutely beautiful. After being down there for about half an hour, the bartender told me that she'd be closing up the garden soon because there wasn't a lot of people going down there anyways. She explained that they were working on Bar Time which I can understand being that it was busier in the bar than in the backyard that night. But she said I could finish my cigarette up on the patio &that it would be open for a while, at least until people start being loud, then they'll have to close up to respect the neighbors.\n\n Totally understood. She kept checking up on me to see if I was having a good time &see if I needed another drink, so that was pretty cool. I got really good vibes from this bar, so far, haven't had a bad night here. \nBeen coming here for a while now.\n\nIn all honesty, some reviews, I think, is a defamation of character on these bartenders. Don't assume that because they call you dollface, hun, boo, that it's condescending. Some people just talk like that. I didn't mind it, but if you're insecure about someone calling you that, speak up &let them know.  \nPlease be considerate of people coming or working at this bar. Everyone deals with a lot of shit everyday, so don't take every little thing your bartender or people around you say, up the ass. You probably just had a bad day, don't make it harder on people at the bar trying to have a good night. You guys are taking these reviews too personally. All bartenders, no matter what bar you go to, go through a lot of bullshit throughout their day of dealing with drunks. They call it Bar Time for a reason. \n\nSo far, I've met so many awesome people here, so if it's your first time, or you've been there forever, spark up conversation with people! This is the best place to make new friends or acquaintances!! If you get here early, enjoy the garden before it gets dark out!!! \n\nThey also play basketball, baseball, &football on the TV's. I've gotten food delivered to me there as well. Pretty awsome bar to chill at &unwind after work. Thank you Wild Side for your services!! Hope you all enjoy!!!!

It was as if I was supposed to prepare for a public castration by a roomful of women dressed like the \"Girl with a Dragon Tattoo.\"  What I encountered here was quite the opposite. Maybe it was because it was relatively early for a Saturday, but the large majority of folks there were men. Everyone I encountered, whether friend or stranger, was straight. This retaught me the valuable lesson of never judging a book by its cover. I've been to many gay and lesbian bars in my day and the folks are some of the friendliest and welcoming I've known. \n\nI enjoyed a couple different refreshing draft beers while lounging around a large round table in the center. It was freezing cold outside and on the verge of raining, but you would have never known from the bar's the warm and cozy interior.

Living elsewhere in the Bay, I haven't really tried to venture to this neighborhood before recently, which was a MISTAKE!\n\nI came out here to Wild Side West after visiting a friend in the neighborhood, who was selling me on the fact that it's a \"divey gay bar with a dragon in a tree!\"  (She wasn't lying, but it's also so much more!)\n\nThe front room of the bar has some larger, cozy tables, a pool table, juke box-- everything that you need.  The surrounding mix of turn-of-the-century antiques (e.g. Clara Bow-esque black and whites in carved frames) and modern chotchkeys (including a beer-bottlecap-bedazzled pair of mannequin legs spread suggestively over a piano).  It's representative of the folk and the staff who populate the room: familiar, comfortable, respectable, with some edge and flair.\n\nThe real unique selling point on this cozy boozy oasis is the back patio/terraced gardens.  This is where the \"Dragon in a tree\" comes into play:  hodge-podge flower pots, plants, lights, and decor are sprinkled over a top-patio, a lower \"lanai,\" and a terraced garden.  By day, it'd be great to smoke and drink here for hours over a RIchard Brautigan book....and by night it'd be great to smoke and drink here for hours over some good conversation.   A great, unexpected outdoor area to get lost, while you lose yourself in whatever you're doing!  An effervescent womb of flora, light, and cigarette smoke!\n\nOur bartender, Mr. Nancy, was quality people--had to mention that.  \n\nI'm lucky to now have an excuse to come out here and hang (my friend had better never move), but, city folk, if you need a BART-accessible escape without crossing any water or suburbs, I still recommend coming here just to spend a few cozy, smoky hours just outside the trendy hub of the SF metro.", "author": "Sam R."}

Unless, of course, you are a straight guy trying to meet a straight girl, cause this place is also the beating heart of SF lesbian drinking culture  (yeah yeah, lexington, whateves) and your Game prolly won't pull much weight here.  (Not to say it is impossible to meet straight women here, it is just statistically less likely.)  \n\n    Anyhoo, the most fabulous thing about the WSW (aside from the killer people, hi Jan!) is the beer garden, which is out back and DOWN THE STAIRS.  Musicians often jam out under the big upstairs patio (you may find me here on occation), and the sprawling beer garden fills the back space with what seems to be 100's of little nooks and grottoes for private conversation.\n\n    The jukebox, which used to play a strict rotation of Janis, Eminem, and Missy Elliot has been updated to one of the internet equiped everysongintheknownuniverse kind of deals, which is cool.  Much cooler than Janis, sorry to say, but hey, to each their own.\n\n  Speaking of Janis, she had sex on the pool table.   True Fact!\n\n  Fireplace:  so so good on those cold San Francisco days and nights in the winter.  And the summer.  and the spring.  And the fall.\n\n   Some of the bartenders are cooler than others.  Mister Nancy is a personal favorite, but a few of the other good ones were sacked/left when the place changed hands recently.  Thus the 4 stars and not 5.  Love this place, can't say I am much for the new management.  BUT... they do care about the place in their own  way and didn't sell the place for scrap wood and condos when SF lesbian icon/bar owner Pat passed away recently.  I do have to say that painting over  the mural on the back wall was a major fuck-up.  Billie... WTF?\n\n   On a historical note, it is important to recognize that 30-40 years ago, lesbians were marginalized and maligned to an even greater extent than gay men, and that Pat and her partner Nancy put their necks on the line and their hearts and souls into a safe, positive place for lesbian women, by lesbian women.  This place drew all kinds of fire from  bigots for many years, and the big front windows were broken so many times by haters that they were eventually just covered up, and remain so to this day.

Tiny bathroom.\n\nI came here to meet up with some people who were getting together for a drink after work on someone's last day.  It's a block away from where they all work, so the venue was chosen for convenience.\n\nI really didn't like it much here.  When you walk in you notice an odd smell in the place.  Not quite BAD, but very distracting.  Kinduv an \"old\" smell.\n\nI sat down at the bar and waited for the bartender to serve me.  Now, I do know that this is a lesbian bar, and I didn't feel quite welcome here as a straight guy.  Maybe Im imagining that, but if it wasn't because of my sexual preference, there was definitely some reason why the bartender wasn't very friendly towards me.  She smiled and talked with other patrons that were either regulars, friends, or both, but wasn't nearly as friendly with me.\n\nI tried to order a mojito because I had read on Yelp they were great here, but I was told they were out of mint.  I asked the bartender if she had any other specialties, and she said she could make what tasted kinduv like an alcoholic Snapple.  That sounded awesome, and I went for it.  It was exactly as it was described, and was refreshing and delicious, not to mention strong.  I was very polite the whole time, and even attempted to compliment the bartender on the drink, but just got a weak thanks without her even looking up at me. \n\nLater when I wanted to play a game of pool, I waited around the bar a bit to ask the bartender for some change.  After a while, she stopped where I was standing and looked at me with a questioning expression, and I asked for change, with a please, and when she gave it to me a thank you.  The whole time she didn't say a single word or crack any semblance of a smile, only acknowledging the whole transaction by giving me what I asked for.\n\nThe bathrooms here are two tiny stalls out back, mens and womens next to each other.  Kinda uncomfy.  I had to step in on the side of the toilet in order to open and close the door.  I'm sure it must get difficult for people that are drunk to get in and out.\n\nThe patrons here seemed nice enough, but the bartender made me feel very uncomfortable.  Maybe knowing its a lesbian bar is making me confuse being unwelcome because of sexual preference with just plain bad customer service, I don't know.  I doubt I will ever be back.", "author": "Jon B."}

One of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was sitting there, collecting donations for breast cancer. \n\nInside, the DJ was mixing some fun dance music. The bartenders were friendly, and because of the breast cancer benefit, felt boobies of the chocolate and vanilla variety were for sale. Imagine walking up to bar and finding a random felt boobie on the bar while you decide what to order. OR being greeted by the bartender's felt boobie, strategically placed between her two real ones.\n\nWith several drinks in hand, we headed down the narrow steps to the backyard.

She lack personality and customer service. My friends told my girlfriend and I to meet them there before we go to dinner at Vega (excellent service and delicious food). So I went to purchase a drink for my girlfriend and I and she ask for my ID which is fine and ask me for the other ID whom I'm buying the drink for. I didn't have any problem with that but I knew it was going to be a problem because of the malicious stare when entering the bar and showing her my ID. My girlfriend shows her ID which is unfortunately expired. I understand by law that an expired ID is not valid. I told her ok but she continue to talk and was very condescending about it. She told my girlfriend that she can't stay because they do not serve food and again gave us a malicious stare of disgust. I didn't want to make a scene so my girlfriend  left and I went to the patio to let my friends know and they were furious because they didn't even get carded. So they decided to test it out to see if we were getting discriminated against because we were of African Descent or lesbian. My friend (Caucasian male) went to order a drink to see if he would be treated differently. Of course he was, so she wasn't just following the  law... She wanted us out of there. She didn't ask for his ID nor ask for the person of whom he is buying the drink for. At that moment I was furious but walked out because I'm not a confrontational person. I live close to the neighborhood, we did not present ourselves as if we were trouble. I have never experience such blatant racism in my life and this will not be my last review or action.

There's always somebody playing music and lots of great plants and weird garden ornaments.  The clientele is always friendly, often quite drunk, and widely varied.

AND this place has some pretty swell bbq's during football season!!! If bbq isn't your thing, you're easy walking distance from great restaurants....Vino Rosso, Liberty Cafe, Little Nepal, Piqueo's, Moki's to name a few! \n\nOn 2nd thought, forget what I said, it's really not that great here (hoping that the place won't be inundated with people...I like to think of it as perk of hanging in Bernal and being in the know!!!

I'm SO sorry but I just couldn't.  I'm a conflicted Yelper with trust issues.  Let's start with:\n\n1) I don't know you.  What if you're actually some chest bumper with frat manners?  I can just hear you yelling backward as the lesbian bouncer hauls you out, \"DUUUUUUDE!  Rosie W. said this place was cool!\"  Which leads me to:\n\n2) They know me here.  OK, not THAT well, but Regina knows me.  And she's pretty much the most professional, friendly booze ninja in this whole city.  If you ruin that for me, I will be a sober nomad with nowhere to go.  Which brings me to:\n\n3) I live crawling distance from this place.  It is my Regal Beagle.  And when I'm here, I really can't talk to you.  Because I am probably already drunk and boring the life out of some poor young lesbian who just got off the bus from Eugene and wanted to have some fun but now is stuck in a dead end conversation with a married chick.  So you see, I am busy.  Which brings me to:\n\n4) This is a lesbian bar.  That doesn't mean it's only for lesbians.  That means if you get into an argument with a lesbian here, you lose.  So you can hang out, but you are a guest and need to mind your ass.  Which leads me to:\n\n5) There's not a lot of room on the patio.  This patio has been the fertile ground of many a fruitful conversation with my neighbors.  It's my salon.  My Algonquin Round Table.  OK, sometimes it's just where I chain smoke and repeat myself (see #3).  But there's not a lot of room and it's one of very few al fresco drinking spots in town with a wind guard.  \n\nI want this to work SO badly.

I was a little annoyed but I thought \"hey, it's a week night, everyone seems to be in a good mood, I'll roll with it\".  \n\nMy friend and I finally got our beers and went out back to drink.   A while later the bar tender came by and told us to bring our own glasses back up since we were such jerks....WTF???  I asked her what she was talking about and she laid into us about how we were so rude when we were waiting for our drinks.  Neither us us had any idea what she was talking about.  She thought we had complained about waiting so long (obviously she realized we had and felt sensitive about it).  \n\nThe only thing we could figure out was that we had been talking about a race my friend was going to run and she somehow pickup up \"it's about time\" as complaining to her.\n\nIn any case, nothing we said made any difference to her or anyone else working at the bar.  As local customers clearly we were wrong and not worth listening to.\n\nSo if you go to this place, make sure you kiss the staff's butt or you may find yourself being attacked.", "author": "Keith B."}

Plus inside there's a pool table and a great pinball machine.\n\nWild Side West is primarily a lesbian bar, but everyone is very friendly and the bar welcomes all types. (On several occassions perfect strangers have invited us to join their parties and partake in their food) I don't know anyone, gay or straight, who hasn't been charmed instantly by this place.", "author": "Johnny H."}

There is the most incredible garden/patio hidden in the back of this place.  The initial interior is your standard dive bar situation with a pool table, some kitsch, and limited seating.  The garden in the back is what with take your breathe away.  It's like somebody pilfered all the most odd  pieces of furniture from backyards across the Bay and assembled them into nooks and crannies for intimate conversation.  I may have gotten one weird look from one of the lady patrons, but that could have been imagined.  I also thought I saw an animal in the garden, but it turns out it was just a leaf.  The drinks weren't magnificent because they weren't gay-man-drink-the-pain-away-bring-the-slutty-out, but some nice beers were on tap.  Overall, great neighborhood bar for lesbians, gays and all folks.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Ugh, even I hate myself for saying that.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

Well, friend, allow me to elaborate. I have never had a bad time at WSW, and I have been there, um, many times. Though this is undoubtedly due at least in part to the wonderful cohorts with whom I have had the pleasure of spending time at WSW, I have to give credit to the place itself. The jukebox is good (anything that puts Kanye West in the same collection as Al Green and classic country will automatically gain points with me), the drinks are strong and cheap, and though service can be spotty, it's really only because the bartender knows so many people that she can't help but chat a bit--- and she's always smiling. This is highly preferable to bartenders at many other bars who don't even give you the time of day. Plus, they actually respect women here, and will give us (especially we diligent and often underappreciated femmes) the preferential treatment we deserve-- not something I usually ask for, but I sure as hell do at a bar when drinks are at stake. I should also mention that this is a queer ladies' bar but by no means exclusively and by no means sceney (i.e., no cookie-cutter \"hipper than thou\" folk-- you know who you are) so most everyone should feel comfortable here, something I truly appreciate.\n\nThe ambience seals the deal, old-fashioned and quirky without trying too hard, like a combination of old west saloon and Victorian punch house, and the smoking patio/garden outside make for a lovely escape. Recently when some dear friends and I attended in celebration of my birthday, I had the pleasure of being serenaded \"Happy Birthday\" by members of a motley band who had a few moments earlier been performing holiday songs (to the best of their efforts) in order to raise money for \"the old people of Chinatown who don't have any.\" Friends, it doesn't get much better.", "author": "Janine M."}

The interior takes second place to the outdoor space, with its bi-level patios, shrubbery and sculpture garden, and hidden nooks and crannies for private tete-a-tetes. Bird feeders perch on rustic artwork, while patrons relax on furniture fashioned from cinderblocks and driftwood.

Males are more than welcome, and gay men more interested in socializing with a friendly crowd than cruising for tomorrow morning's brunch date will find its charm and character a refreshing change from the oppressive atmospheres found in Castro and SoMa bars.

I forgot everything about this bar except the nonfunctional fireplace strewn with odd shoes in the middle of the room.  BUT I missed out on the best part, which I discovered last night: THE PATIO.  \nThis ranks among the neatest (yes, I said NEAT) outdoor patios I've seen in SF and beyond.  It's like a secret garden with several intimate sitting areas, funky old junk decor, and porch swing.  At night, cords of bright-colored lights provide the only light and friends sip and chat in the dusk.  \nWe had a great time sipping Mickey's grenades and soaking up the bayou-like ambiance provided by the guy with a banjo (!).  \nThe beers were of average price, the crowd inside was fun and friendly, and the bartenders chatted us up appropriately.  \nIt's like an old shack full of your friends where you can play in the backyard.  And it's a bar!", "author": "Eric S."}

From the bar that looks like something out of Alaska in the 20's, to the garden in back with nooks, crannies and a clawfoot tub made into a planter! We went on a Friday evening (6 p.m.) with a friend from Chicago.  The place was a little dead, but picked up quickly.  Many places to hide out in the garden, have a beer and just kick back.  The fact that it has been described as a \"lesbian\"  bar is a bit misleading.  There are lesbians, there are straight people, and everyone was incredibly mellow.  I can't see anyone having a bad time here unless they listen to Rush or Hannity on a daily basis.  Oh, and to the people at the bar that night.. Sorry about our Chicago friend snapping photos.

I like to support the neighborhood businesses even if it is the filthiest place I've ever been in, dirty tables, restrooms etc. I know, lets try a remodel, paint, dump the dated crap on the walls and fireplace and give it a new start. Now the rest of the story: The Bartenders, OMFG!!!! Horrible, I actually watched the bartender ring up $4.00 for our round of drinks (4) and charged us $21.00. So lets see, 4-21=17.00, she's making bank! They have the same miserable bartenders everyday, lacking personalty, class, and conversation, which explains why they have no business. It would be very hard to have a business on Courtland and fail, the only competition would be the Stray bar up the street and that smells like a urinal. Since the \"New Owner\" came into play, we all hoped she would clean the place up, add a little class and charm. That didn't happen. My friends and I went there the other night...again, to play pool, thinking it changed. It did, they now have a male bartender, WTF!! So, the place is now officially a dump, but why bring a male bartender into the picture? Is this a form of desperation or it's going to the men? No longer a lesbian place?? This place had great potential with the right people and different owners working it, it would be 5 deep at the bar.
