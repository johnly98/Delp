I ordered this because it's so rare that Thai restaurants in the states have this -- I can only really get it when my mom makes it or when I go back to Thailand -- and just seeing the name on the menu gave me a hankering for it. But I knew from the second our waiter put it in front of me that I'd be severely disappointed -- and I was not wrong. The noodles had been carelessly and thoughtlessly boiled. The seafood was done all wrong -- the imitation crab (first of all, what place does this have in Guay Tiew Lord and who the heck thought it was smart to put it in here???) and calamari tasted freezer burned, and the shrimp was overcooked and shriveled up. The flavor was extremely salty and one dimensional. But. Because I was REALLY hungry -- and because I'm frugal and won't ever throw away food no matter how sucky it is -- I ate as much as I could -- about 1/3 of the dish -- before I asked for a box to take it home, where I will very begrudgingly force myself to finish it.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the Pad Kee Mao, which is one of his favs at Thai places. He said it was \"...edible, not great but not horrible.\"\n\nOne star for okay service and one star for pretty legit Thai iced coffee but honesty, don't come here. If you're craving pan-fried noodles like we were, you'd be so much better off at that Chinese counter food place tucked inside Lucky's. If you're craving a slightly classier sit-down Asian place, go to the sushi place across the plaza! Go anywhere but here.", "author": "Virulpat W."}

I'd say I've had better for the price margins, but perhaps it just depends on the palette. The service wasn't terribly attentive even with just a few people in the restaurant, and having two servers working at the time. This is just a general observation since service like this exists at a lot of Asian restaurants. Anyway I ordered the pad mau keur with tofu and veggies. \n\n*Side note: there are a lot of restaurants where I want to order meat for 50 cents to a dollar more just because it's a fuller portion. This would be one of them. This isn't to say there's a great amount of food, there just wasn't much tofu.\n\nThe sauce was salty, especially for using a sweet soy sauce. The consistency of the veggies differed here and there, some felt pre-prepared. Some had a good slight crunch as opposed to mush. Others not so much. The eggplant sorta fell apart. Due to how it was, it soaked up a bunch of the sauce and was salty too. The rest was ok but scarfing down rice to balance the flavor in my mouth grew tiresome. The one thing I did really like was the amount of basil. I adore basil. It makes food shine in flavor to me.\n\nI also got their tofu salad mini takeout. It was good but mostly because of the 6 dollar price idk if I would it again. The peanut sauce was yummy. Again, little tofu. Nothing to write home about overall.", "author": "David C."}

I have a soft spot for this place because I used to frequent this place back when I lived in the area and when I was a poor undergrad. Is the food here amazing? No. Is it a place you will take people from out of town? Probably not. However, it's a casual place where you can find not super authentic Thai food at relatively cheap prices. When you walk in, it looks like a hole in the wall place with their basic sometimes-wobbly-wooden tables and chairs. Yes, not much of a grand ambiance here but it doesn't try to pass off as some classy place.\n\nThe menu is standard and you'll find the usual popular Thai dishes like pad thai, pad see ewe, and an assortment of curries. I've had the pad see ewe, pad kee mao, and duck noodle soup here and they were all decent. Nothing to rave about but also nothing to complain about either.\n\nThe service has always been good and the food never takes too long to arrive at the table. Granted, there typically doesn't seem to be a lot of people dining here even during peak lunch and dinner hours. \n\nIf you're looking for a great Thai restaurant, this isn't it. If you're looking for a place where you can have a decent meal for less than $10, come check it out!", "author": "Christina S."}

I thought the pad thai here was pretty darn good. Of course, things change. I think King of Thai makes decent thai food but when I'm craving it, this wouldn't be on the top of my list of thai food restaurants. \n\nJust to recollect my memory of the restaurant, I recently picked up some pad thai and pad kee mao with chicken for dinner. Service in the restaurant was friendly and I appreciated all of the seating, as well as separate seating for those waiting for a pick-up order such as myself. I enjoyed the pad kee mao noodles but I felt that both noodle dishes were just dry. I remember the pad thai being saucier, and the pad kee mao just wasn't up to par. \n\nThis location still has King of Thai's iconic lavender walls but for some reason, the \"King of Thai\" letters were removed and it just says, \"Noodle House\" in front of the restaurant. Not sure if that's getting fixed or if this location is disassociating itself with the King.", "author": "Maya S."}

My pad thai was basically one SOLID piece of noodle with a few pieces of chicken and crushed nuts on top. It had no taste and smelled old. From what it looks like they took old food, microwaved it, and sold it to me. Then the salad that my friend/colleague had ordered was basically a quarter of a cabbage head NOT chopped, a few leaves of salad, red chopped onions and a few pieces of pork. And we paid around $20 for that (with tax). If we wanted to  get a non-chopped cabbage and leaves, we would have just walked a few more steps to Lucky's, and bought it all there. At least it would have been more fresh. If they are so lazy about small things like that, I don't want to even think about their sanitary standards in the kitchen.\n\nTo sum up, the food there is horrible.

Wish there were a little less fish cake slices though.

I'm also assuming they no longer have the same exact standards as King of Thai.  I can only assume from what I ordered the last couple of times this past week.  I noticed a huge difference in the portion of protein vs rice/noodles.  My pad kee mao which is stir fried flat rice noodles with choice of meat, basil, peppers, n sweet soy sauce was more like noodles without the meat or veggies.  I also ordered the basil eggplant with ground pork over rice.  Imagine a larger rock glass you'd normally see at a bar... That was the amount of eggplant, meat, and basil.  Gigi M. was like \"Why is there so much rice and so little eggplant?!?!\"  4 small pieces of eggplant by the way, while the name of the dish is called \"Basil Eggplant\".  Ground pork almost nonexistent.  Maybe at most 2 soup spoonfuls or pork to 2 cups of rice.  I added 2 fried eggs and asked them to make sure the yolk isn't over cooked and keep it runny.  Over the phone they said ok not going to be overcooked.  It came out more than fully cooked.  Overall, waaaaay too stingy for my likes.  Didn't know ground meat and eggplant was that costly for them to give the proper portions.\n\nWith that said... I'm pretty sure I won't ever be going back unless I absolutely have to.  There are plenty of better locations for solid mediocre and above average thai food like Vanida Thai 2 minutes away on Taraval and 40th or the original King of Thai also on Taraval and 24th.", "author": "Colin M."}

After a grueling morning or evening of water practice, thai food and noodle soup seems to be the agreed upon cure. \n\nThis past week we came with around 20 people, or normal amount. The staff was really nice and were able to accommodate us by putting tables together. What I like most about King of Thai is that not only do they have a variety of soup combinations and ingredients, but they give you choices between noodles! Egg, wide rice, small round rice, and vermicilli noodles-simply because some days I like my #7 with vermicilli normally, but somedays I feel like wide rice! Anyways, so as per usual I ordered a #7, which came with ground pork, fish cakes, fish balls, some beef slices in a tom yum broth-yeah, amazing combination for noodle soup. \n\nAfter a few moments our food started to come out- and it started to come out fast. It seemed as if once the staff dropped off a plate/bowl they went back they immediately came out to bring more dishes out. When about 75% of our food was out, dishes stopped coming out. Of course we told those that got their food to start eating, but when people had started finishing their dishes we noticed lots of time had passed since food had come out. We asked the staff what was was going on, had they forgotten or orders? One of the waitresses came out a few minutes later with the following news: \"I'm sorry, we ran out of those bowls\" while pointing at a noodle soup someone was eating. Those of us who ordered any noodle soup, including me simply stared and surprisingly in unison asked something close to \"Why didn't you tell us before?!\" Then we asked about the people who ordered normal dishes like their pad thai (which is delicious by the way) and her eyes widened and she told us she'd be right back. \n\nIn the end, we all got the dishes we ordered, but apparently only after people had finished the bowls necessary to serve our respective dishes. Apparently this rarely happens she said, but the fact that it could happen at all surprised all of us. Having come by many times before, it was a good thing we all knew this place was a great restaurant to get cheap and deliciously filling thai food. \n\nIf you're looking for a quick place to eat while you're in the area and your group is much less than 20 people, definitely check this place out, it's definitely an answer to the \"where should we eat\" question-something I ask all too often =D. Sort of random, but those on the Paleo diet, their eggplant chicken stir fry fits your diet regiment and is actually really well seasoned and cooked and tastes delicious!\n\n*Note-there is no longer complimentary thai iced tea and the restaurant only takes cash!", "author": "Jon K."}

Told my usual eating partner and we found ourselves at King of Thai on Sloat on a weekday.\n\nFirst things first, I didn't know there was a short list of things you could choose from for the 3/$18. S.H.O.R.T! Then to top it off one of the meals we chose, the waiter told us they ran out?!?! You've been open for 2 hours at most and you're already OUT??? So we ordered something else from the short list and what a disappointment. I don't even remember what it was, chicken something or other. We also ordered the Pad Thai, noodles were thinner than we're used to and it was sweeter than we're used to. Surprisingly there was plenty of shrimp in it. We also ordered the beef green curry. Nice flavor, plenty of veggies and meat, but the beef was so thin and tough. Must remember NOT to order beef at Thai restos anymore unless it's ground beef. 3/$18 is worth it if you're sharing.

We were tired, cold and hungry and thai noodle soup sounded incredibly delicious and warm.\n\nThe staff was very nice and accommodating for our large group. They put a couple of tables together to seat 10 at each. The menu also had a lot of variety (as most Thai places do). The noodles give you a choice of choosing a different type of noodle with your order - egg, wide rice, small rice or vermicilli. I ordered a #5 with egg noodles which was with pork as the main meat. Sounded delicious!\n\nAs food started coming out for some of my friends... and more food... I sat there with my empty spot. 45 minutes in while everyone was already FINISHING up with their food... some of us still hadn't gotten ours. I asked one of the staff what was up and he went back to go check. Some time later, a waitress comes out and tell us that they RAN OUT OF BOWLS. Seriously?! They asked us to reorder our food ... (and I also watched as one of the waitresses brought out a BOWL OF NOODLES to another customer that sat down MUCH AFTER we had). \n\nRan out of bowls, huh?! Still... how do you run out of bowls in a restaurant...\n\nI was already fed up with the waiting and how hungry I was that I just told them to order me a pad thai. The pad thai came out after about 5-10 minutes and by that time ... most were already finished and just waiting for us to eat. I mean they did compensate by giving us a iced tea (which actually only costs a dollar). The pad thai was alright, wasn't the best thing I had since it looked like they quickly threw it together.

Came in with a friend to grab some lunch TO GO, place was dead so it didn't take too long for the order to come. We decided to take a couple of bites before heading out and since there was no one in there we didn't think the workers would mind. Oh no no, the two workers just kept snickering and looking at us, it was SO uncomfortable. We both gave each other the oh haleee no face.    I know, I know, maybe they're not talking about us right? Then dang, did they have to LOOK like they were?  As if they were mad that we said TO GO but ate a few forks full there. \n\n\nI don't know why I keep coming back, maybe because it's the closest one to me and I pray I don't see the same workers.

I've eaten at the location and have had their take out.  I can confidently say I like this place a lot.  Apparently, there's several \"King of Thai\" restaurants scattered all over San Francisco, but this is the first one I have ever tried.  \n\nFrom the outside, it doesn't look like much. Once inside though, you'll be surprised to see it is pretty spacious.  The place is kept clean also, considering the high amount of business they have, though much of the business appears to be from take out.  The menu has a decent variety.  \n\nWith the name \"noodle soup\" in its title, I've tried the noodle soup and found it average.  Most of the good stuff are everything else on the menu.  The appetizers are good to try, but I'd advise just going straight to the entrees because they are almost the same price, unless you are really aching for them.  The yellow curry which my girlfriend likes is really good.  I could just pour the curry sauce onto the white rice and just eat it like that.  The Gal Pad Med Mamuang (sauteed chicken, cashew nuts bell pepper, white onion and dry chili with thai chili paste and sweet black soy sauce) is probably one of the things I order the most.  The Pad Thai, the staple of all Thai food, has nothing spectacular but is pretty good there.  \n\nAs everyone on previous reviews have said already.  Prepare to pay in cash because that's all they take.  I know that sucks, but they make up for it in speed and quality that comes with that speed.  This place isn't the pinnacle of Thai food, and if I were giving it a rating for the food specifically; I'd give it a 3.5 or to be more exact a 3.7.  The food is good, just not the best.

I have been to this restaurant multiple times, and after the first 4 times I gave up on convincing myself I like it. The only reason I keep returning is because I'd be with a group of friends.\n\nMy friends love their Pad Thai, but I think it's disgusting. You can buy instant Pad Thai at a grocery store for equivalent taste.\n\nUsually when I go to Thai restaurants I order Drunken Noodles, and when I asked the waiter if they make it (because I didn't see it on the menu) he didn't know what I was talking about. But another worker did know what I was talking about, and told me to order Pad Ki Mao. I love Thai food for the many flavors and spices its known for; this dish was extremely bland and tasted like Chinese Chow Fun. \n\nI did have one good experience though, I actually liked their Pumpkin Curry.\n\nI have been to MANY Thai restaurants, and one thing I have always noticed is how super friendly the staff always is. However, the workers here are actually kind of rude. I understand that one time we hadn't finished eating yet when they were trying to close and they were unhappy, but they were extremely unprofessional. I have worked at a restaurant before and know how irritating it is to have to close late, but I know the importance of respecting customers!\n\nYou may disagree with my review, but keep in mind that Thai food is one of my absolute favorites, and I am REALLY picky about it!\n\nI am new to San Francisco, so please let me know if you know of a good Thai restaurant!!", "author": "Kayla I."}

It was alright...definitely not strong like Vietnamese coffee, which I liked, seemed a tad watery though.  \n\nService is alright.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "King of Thai Noodle House really perplexes me.  Why on earth would anybody go through the effort of starting up a restaurant in San Francisco - one of the most competitive restaurant markets in the country - hire staff that can perfectly execute a meal, and spend the money on the freshest ingredients available, only to churn out dishes that are about as bland and boring as a cream of Saltine cracker soup?  Maybe, as some reviewers suggest, this restaurant has consistency issues, and I just happened to catch it in one of its bland moments.  Or maybe its neighborhood clientele are such wussies that even a drop of fish sauce in their food would cause their heads to explode.  Either way, taking classic Thai cuisine and sucking most of the flavor out of it is a food crime, right up there with the use of soy filler in the Great American Hamburger.\n\nTake, for example, the Poh Piar Tod (deep fried vegetarian egg rolls) that I ordered there recently, which were fried to perfection.  Their rice wrapper skins were paper thin, light as a feather, and crunchy - far better than I've seen in many more upscale restaurants.  Inside each roll was a mix of finely and exquisitely chopped bean thread noodles, slivered carrots, cabbage bits, and taro root slices (the menu said 'black mushroom,' but they must have run out of black mushrooms that day).  As perfectly prepared as these rolls were, however, they were dominated by too many starches and nearly tasteless.  They did come with a sticky, red dipping sauce whose hot, sweet flavor overwhelmed what little flavor there was in the rolls.  It was a bit like eating pretzel sticks dipped in the liquid remains of a melted cinnamon lollipop.\n\nThe Pad Woon Sen, which I ordered as the main course, suffered from a similar lack of anything my taste buds could recognize as flavor. I could not detect the flavor of any garlic, chopped scallions, soy sauce, fish sauce, or oyster flavor sauce - some or all of which are typically used to add flavor to this dish, as bean thread noodles are otherwise virtually tasteless.  Despite creating a dish that had all the flavor of the stuffing in your favorite seat cushion, the chef still took the time and effort to execute it well - the bean thread noodles were neither overly dry nor wet and mushy,  the chicken and scrambled egg in the dish were cooked through properly, and carrots, celery, and other vegetables in the dish were cut into incredibly delicate slivers.  Expending so much effort on food this boring is like serving the most expensive Rothchild's red that you can find in paper Dixie cups - it seems like such a waste!\n\nI didn't have any issues here with the service, and the minimalist ambience here was OK for the type of restaurant that this is.  My issues with this restaurant come down solely to the food that they serve.  Some folks like their food bland and boring like this, and I am more than happy to give up my spot at the King of Thai Nood;e House's table for them.

Their food is tasty and the portions are large.\nYes it sucks that they don't accept credit cards, but I am willing to go to the ATM for them. \nI've been to the Clement location too, but this one is much better. Overall, I won't doubt that you can get better Thai food somewhere else, but for now I love this place and their Pra Ram.", "author": "Sarah M."}

It seems as though ordering to go will give you the higher probability of getting more food.  Now this doesn't mean you WILL get more food.  Just a higher chance of it happening.\n\nI ordered the Pad See Ew and Pad Thai to go.  They had a lot of the Pad See ew, but the Pad Thai box was  significantly less full.  Seemed as though half of what was there was bean sprouts as well.  The Pad See Ew was okay. My only complaint is that the beef was very chewy/hard.  It might be that Thai people like to have their beef cooked this way, because I don't think I've ever had Beef Pad See Ew where it wasn't\n\nI also ordered Thai Iced Tea.  While it was delicious, they really filled the cup with ice (but what store doesnt?)  \n\nService is fine here, except while I was waiting to pick up my food, the cashier waited for a lady to order her food to go instead of serving me while she looked at the menu.  \n\nOther than that, it's a fine place to go for Thai", "author": "Andrew T."}

Hell.\n\nThe entire time I was on the treadmill at the gym, all I could think about was indulging in a plate of Pad See Ew from King of Thai. I had it all planned out: I was going to swing by Taraval on my way home, pick up a #15 Pad See Ew, steal some peppers from the hidden stash under the cart, and go home to a nice toasty meal. Buttt, I decided since I had videos to return at Blockbuster, I'd kill 2 birds with one stone and head to the King of Thai on Sloat instead. Big mistake.\n\nI waited an eternity for my order and when it finally got to our table, it was cold as ice. I stirred it around my plate hoping that maybe the noodles underneath were still warm and saucy... but no. Just a plate of cold ass noodles on a cold ass night. Yuck.\n\nI asked the waitress if she wouldn't mind taking it back because it was way too cold to the *touch* to enjoy. She gladly took it back, and my faith was briefly restored. That is, until I saw her open up the microwave and nuke my noodles for a good 2 minutes :(  They came out as expected: burning hot in some places, freezing cold in others. The sauce was even more evaporated and I sat there poking at the heap of noodles in front of me wishing I had just made the extra effort to go to Taraval.

And I do not like people who talk in condescending tones. I asked \"Ok... what kind of noodles do you have\" He blurted a list of noodles and I just chose vermicelli cuz that was the last one I heard. \n\nHe brought the vermicelli over and we ate our meal.\n\nHalfway through the meal.

It doesn't hurt that prices were moderately affordable. We ordered #17 pad kee mao with beef, #31 kao pad gai tod, and Thai ice tea, and was served in under 3 minutes.\n\nThe pad kee mao had just the right amount of heat in spiciness and wasn't excessively greasy. I surmise that grease from the ground beef provided enough oil to cook the flat rice noodles. There was TLC in the food preparation: they made the noodles and Chinese green beans manageable to eat by cutting them nice and short.\n\nI enjoyed pad kee mao more than the kao pad gai tod. The fried batter didn't stick to the chicken and was neither crispy, salty nor flavorful, but I guess the accompanying sweet and sour sauce is supposed to help. I just wish they gave more of the sauce. The chicken breast itself was a bit bland; however, there was enough meat to be satisfied. I was disappointed with the small size and quantity of scrambled eggs in the fried rice--it's barely noticeable.  And they could have added more onions and tomatoes instead of treating them like garnish. But I liked the spices in Thai fried rice contrasted to the Chinese soy-sauce based counterpart.\n\nThe Thai ice tea was great, though they filled half the cup with ice, and wasn't overly sweet. The tea could be a little stronger. The milk used  in ice tea reminded me of the taste of Vitasoy soy milk.\n\nOne regret I have is not trying their $18 dine-in special, which includes an appetizer, rice plate and noodle plate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-03", "description": "Came here with 2 friends tonight, and it was the first time eating here. Usually we go to the other Taraval branch, but decided that we would try this place out. Consequently my friends got pineapple fried rice, roast duck stir fried rice, and I got Pad Kee Mao with beef. We awaited our order which didn't take too long.\n\nI will say this. I'm usually very biased against local favorites. I really really like the taraval branch, not so much for their service, but the food tastes spicier, and usually the food is tasty. This branch seemed to cater to a crowd that perhaps has less of a stomach for a constant burning tongue, but overall it was good. The service people were attentive, and although a bit smaller than the Taraval branch, there wasn't as big of a crowd, and the decor in my opinon was nicer. It's also a tad cleaner, but that could due to the fact that the place doesn't get too many customers during the early evening. \n\nThe Pad Kee Mao dish had more noodles and less chilis. Usually that's a bad thing, but the Taraval branch seems to put on the hot and turn the knob to 11. It's not a bad thing, but sometimes the thai iced tea isn't enough to quiet the flaming burn. Also, there apparently was less grease used to cook the food. If you ever get this same dish from the Taraval branch, after finishing your dish, there's a lot of brown grease at the bottom of your plate. That can't be too healthy for you. This place was significantly less heavy on the grease, and the remaining oil on my plate was clear, so that's gotta be healthier.\n\nThe pineapple fried rice had less rice, but more stuff... aka chicken, pineapple, etc. The roast duck stir fry rice was apparently well appreciated by my friend as well.\n\nOverall not bad, and since my friend recently moved closer to this location, we'll probably frequent this place more. Slightly healthier options, and the waiters/waitresses are more friendly, and don't serve with an cold attitude. The decor is nicer, and cleaner, and the patrons aren't overflowing the tables. Nice experience, would definitely recommend this place. I'm definitely coming back.", "author": "Clinton L."}

The people are not friendly, the aren't very good cooks making your food, and the prices of their items are what you would pay in a higher scale Thai restaurant such as Marnee Thai.  I went there because I remember going to the one over on Clement Street and it was pretty decent.  For the convenience and hurry, I paid the price with having mediocre Thai food.  The Gai Ga Praw (ground chicken stir fried with basil & chili) was unpalatable even when I was already starving.   That tells you how bad it must have been!  The rice was mushy and the chicken dish, which should be packed with flavors of spicy, sweet, salty, herby, fragrant was absent of flavor and weren't cooked long enough to release these ingredient.  Needless to say, I'm deeply disappointed with this joint and I will never, ever, patronize them again!  I'll drive a little further over to Taraval location or to Marnee Thai instead so that my reward is well cooked food!  Damn you, KTN on Sloat, for ruining my Sunday treat!!!  One star for you!

Sometimes the food is good like at the other King of Thais, but it's really hit-or-miss here.  The waitresses (depending on the time you go//who's working) can be really rude.  I don't really care if the wait staff isn't really friendly or whatever, but I appreciate when they do their jobs.  Things like refilling water, remembering your order, not standing behind the counter with their jackets and purses, glaring at us, waiting for us to leave.  It was more than half an hour before they closed when we left!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-06", "description": "Thai restaurants can be broken down into two categories: noodle shops and everything else.  This is a noodle shop.  Their specialty is going to be the Thai noodle soup, and perhaps some of the noodle plates, but really it's the Thai noodle soup called 'Kiaw Diew.'  \n\nI'll walk you through how to order the noodles.  When ordering noodles you get two options: noodles and meat.  They have 3 types: Thin rice noodle, egg noodle, and thick rice noodle (sometimes called boat noodles.  I chose thin rice noodle (my favorite.) You get to pick what kind of meat you want: stewed beef (from the broth), meatballs, or sliced beef.  I chose the combination.  The combination also had some beef linings in it too in case you don't like that.  I'm not a huge fan, but I'll put up with it.\n\nOnce you get your bowl of noodles (about 5 minutes later) then comes the fun part.  You get to modify it to your tastes with the dry red pepper and the 'nam som' or pickled pepper (this is the sliced green peppers in the clear liquid.)  First I test the broth to see how it is \"raw.\" After that I add lots of red pepper.   Then add the pickled pepper to even out the flavor so that it's not too sweet.  \n\nThat being said this was a huge bowl of noodles and it was excellent.  I have to give them 4 stars out of 5 because they didn't have any beer. Singha beer goes hand in hand with this meal.", "author": "Chris C."}

The pineapple fried rice is aesthetically better, but I think you get more with the Taraval. However, I always thought the fried rice was pretty good here... though  I have one complaint. Tonight, the shrimp didn't taste all that great. I can't put my finger on it, but I just didn't like the taste. It's a first, though... unless I'm just now recognizing it.

If you you're a fan of noodle soup from the other king of Thai noodle restaurants - don't go to this one. My wife was craving beef noodle soup and she loves king of thai in Union Square so we tried this place. The noodles here were really bland and we'll never go back.\nIt was obvious that something was wrong when we finished all our other dishes but the noodle soup was completely full. When our waitress came by i told her (my wife was too greng jai) that the soup was not as good as the other king of thai noodle restaurants. We were very polite and expected that she'd comp the soup or apologize. Instead, she told us that they don't use MSG like all the other king of thai noodle houses and that's why the soup tastes different. But the noodles sucked, honestly, and they should have been free. And if there's any doubt of our credibility, i lived in thailand for 7 years, i've worked in a thai restaurant (as a cook) and my wife is, as you would have guessed by now, thai herself. \n\nKing of Thai Noodle on Sloat - you gave us bad noodles! And we plan to take our Noodle hunger elsewhere. You should have just said sorry, and is there something else we can get you and i would have been happy. But you decided to sucker punch your parent (not sister) restaurant in Union Square to defend your crappy noodles. So fork you and good luck with your noodles.", "author": "Brendan K."}

I LOVE it. I've been to all the King of Thai Noodles locations in the city, but frequent the one on Sloat Blvd the most. The service is good, they are fast, cheap and they always have Thai karaoke videos playing on the tv. \nWe've also ordered curries there and soup. They are all consistently good. The curries can get spicy though, so be careful when ordering. We've also ordered dessert there, sticky rice with mango. It's decent. But there is a reason why they are called King of Thai Noodles.

Most all of the KOT have these chatty Thai waitresses- I wish I knew Thai so I could hear what they are talking about- they chat up a good storm and seem to be having a good time.  Ahhhh, their food hits the spot when I just need some of that tasty asian food!", "author": "Mouse P."}
