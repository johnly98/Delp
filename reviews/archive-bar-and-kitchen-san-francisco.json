Since we had limited time it was really nice to be able to walk in and leave within an hour. Also with multiple dietary considerations there were plenty of options. Service was friendly and for a decent option near the office (when they are paying) I would recommend this place. Although based on other reviews sounds like happy hour is the better time to visit. \n\nWith rent as high as it is I can understand why they would try to cram as many diners in here as possible. But it was a bit awkward to be seated so close to the table next to us and to have to squeeze in and out.\n\nI ordered the Sutro pizza, while big enough for two meals for me, I felt like $18 for a pizza that was just okay was a bit much. The potatoes added nothing to the flavor, I actually preferred it without them and I would have liked more pesto sauce on the pizza.

The decor was nice, there was a great vibe, and our server super friendly. In fact, the friendly server is what enticed us to come in and sit down.\n\nWe ordered a simple half cheese, half pepperoni pizza, a couple of salads, and a sandwich. The salads were superb (highly recommend both the beet/frisee and the Caesar), the turkey club was very good, and the pizza was good as well. There was, however, a misunderstanding in the kitchen, and instead of delivering what we ordered: a pizza that was half cheese only and half pepperoni and cheese, the cook made a full pepperoni, with half with cheese on it and half without. Seems like a small thing, but a pizza without cheese on it is a hard sell to most people, especially to a tweenager. The server immediately recognized the mistake and offered to correct it but we ultimately decided it was less of a hassle for everyone to just eat what we had and leave the part of the pizza that was incorrectly made. \n\nWhen I got the bill, I realized we'd been charged full price for what was essentially a mistake. I asked our server to modify the bill and maybe only charge us half price for the incorrectly made pizza. He was totally amenable to that (and should have thought of/offered that himself). He came back and said \"This is all he would do\" referring to the owner, who was on site that day. The owner apparently approved discounting the pizza by something like $5, which is better than nothing, but from a service standpoint, kind of odd. When your kitchen goofs and a guest is nice enough to not make you go through the trouble of remaking something and wasting incorrectly prepared food, perhaps the least you can do is charge them half price as a thank you. \n\nAll in all, the food was good, our server was great, and the ambiance here was great. The service, in the form of that extended by the owner, could be a better. And to be clear, it's not at all about the money -- it's about good business practices and a customer-centric mindset.", "author": "Shelly K."}

The crust lacked crunch (also rarely say this) but wasn't quite doughy either. I'm sorry, I'm being like Goldilocks today. (Just checked reviews, looks like I'm not the only one with this opinion.

I really loved that this was way too hot when it came out, though that did interfere with texture initially since the pasta was almost melted too and the cheese wasn't gooey as much as liquid. Good truffle flavor on this though.\n\nFor such a small restaurant, it was extremely loud, and I definitely had to project my voice at my dining companion seated one foot across from me.

DUDE! this is the stuff cheese addicts dream about their whole life. \n\nSwear it on my grandma's dead puppy's grave. \n\nAnyway, about those pizzas, they are fantastic. They are not in anyway, the absolute best in SF, but guess what? Archive isn't aiming for that. The love for pizza is evident in the careful, well thought out flavor combos such as the Cardona (artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, swiss chard, goat cheese in an alfredo sauce) or the Hearst (white truffle oil, lardon bacon, wild mushrooms, roasted garlic) If you're feeling basic, their pizza margherita is as basic as you can get, although I disagree with putting fresh tomatoes on this one. I prefer mine with a simple sauce, basil and melty mozz combo. Either way, the pizzas here are hand pulled and the thin crust serves well to soak up the alcohol after you've come from Novela two doors down.  \n\nI didn't imbibe here, but saw a happy hour that can't be beat. With the busy foot traffic on the corner of 2nd and Mission, Archive lures in the Fidi crowd into it's cozy space with warm interiors.

Well made crust with fresh toppings. \n\nOverall, great place to hang out with friends with well made drinks and amazing orzo mac and cheese.

It turns out to be a disastrous decision. The pizza is expensive but no better than fast food delivery. Well, that is fine, at least not a big issue. The disaster started right after I finished my slices, even before I left the table. Pain started in my stomach, but I thought it was no big deal and managed to walk back to my office. Then it got from bad to worse. Vomiting and diarrhea, lying in bed for three days so far, I am still feeling sick. It is a clear symptom of food poisoning. It might not be the routine but just a bad luck, but I strongly recommend anybody to try their luck somewhere else. You can find many better and safer options on Mission.

My lunch break only has 40 mins. And thanks to Archive I had to be starving while attending a meeting. You'd assume businesses should hold their food to a high standard even if it's for MealPal. After all, it's a gateway to get more first time customers and hope they'll convert to frequent customers. But no, not this stinky restaurant. I cook often so I know the issue. They probably cook straight from when the chicken breasts are still frozen. So naturally outside is cooked, inside is inedible. For all I know, they probably sell these to MealPal customers cuz the chicken were about to expired (hence deeply hidden in freezer and hard to cook) Invest in a freaking thermometer now, will you??

They *will* take care of you here if you mention your dietary restrictions. At first I think I just ordered one of the mushroom pizzas without cheese.

So for a day of serious seminars, I went to lunch with my two buds to Archive since they had a gluten-free pizza crust our friend could enjoy. \n\nWhile service started off a wee bit slow (they were super packed) it was on-point the rest of our lunch. We ordered the Hearst* that is ($16 + $2 for a gluten-free crust) and the Caesar ($10.50). The Caesar isn't Olive Garden big, but we enjoyed sharing it, with our pizza coming out not long after the salad. I really, really enjoyed this pizza. The bacon was chunky bits with perfectly cooked mushrooms, and the slight nutty, rich flavors of the truffle oil. None of the ingredients over-powered the others like you might think they would and the crust was delicious. \n\nI say three skinny friends walk into a bar, because this seemed to be the perfect amount of food for us three, but I can imagine someone with a bigger appetite or who'd like to have a few beverages with their lunch might find the pricing to be a little on the expensive side whereas we were able to enjoy a delicious lunch for $16 each. \n\nI'd definitely try them again as a lunch option when I come back to San Francisco!\n\nCaesar* - Little Gem Lettuce, Parmesan Vinaigrette, Bread Crumbs & Spanish White Anchovy\nHearst* - White Truffle Oil, Goat Cheese, Fresh Mozzarella, Wildi Mushrooms & Bacon", "author": "Morgan F."}

They use asparagus, garlic oil, arugula and egg on the pizza... do i need to say any more? \n- Pork Belly Sliders: SO GOOD. The apples and jam really put it over the top. \n\nOkay so if I like the food so much, why am I giving it only 4 stars? To be frank, the drinks suck. lol. I've had their sangrias and tried a few cocktails but each one I've tried, I leave feeling like I just wasted money drinking something I didn't like at all. \n\nTLDR: hearst pizza, porkbelly sliders, don't order their cocktails/sangria - stick to the wines and beers imo.", "author": "Estelle C."}

We asked if they could the fan off that was right above us and they didn't even hesitate which was so nice of them. To order, we split the orzo truffle mac and cheese.

Being a Friday during lent, I had to nix the meat but didn't want to limit my friend and the waiter was more than willing to do a half and half pizza.

I don't know what it was but the pizza crust might have been some of the chewiest most delicious crust ever. I couldn't get over it.

I don't like sweet things on my pizza and if you're not a meat-eater, it's hard to navigate the menu without going sweet.

A dinner catch up on Thursday night.  We got there a little after 5:30 and it was already starting to get crowded.  The only tables that could fit us had the reserved sign, but they saw me walk in and look around and asked me if I would be ordering food or just drinks, I told them food too, so they let us sit there.  Guess that's their way of saving it for people that want to dine, pretty smart.\n\nOnly thing on their happy hour menu for food was a dollar off the pork belly sliders.  My sangria which I just got a glass of was a few bucks off.  The guys got wine and beer that wasn't a part of happy hour.  We decided to start with the orzo mac n cheese, the fried brussel sprouts, and the Hearst Pizza. The Sangria was rose based and was nice and refreshing.  I wish I had a little more hints of fruit in there though.  The orzo mac n cheese was very different as orzo is a rice shaped pasta, and it was served more like a dip as crostinis were served along side.  It had a hint of truffle and was a nice alternative to traditional Mac n cheese.  Reminded me of a savory rice pudding.  There was a hint of truffle oil.  The two waiters were slammed, and we asked for extra crostini pieces, but never got them.  No biggie, we were resourceful and used our crust to dip it in, and ate it by itself too.  If you love mac n cheese and love rice, then I would suggest you get this.  The brussel sprouts weren't chips per say, but when I got the leaf pieces, it reminded me of Marlowe's chips, but way better then theirs. They were well seasoned and not overly greasy.  We substituted the goat cheese for ricotta on the Hearst.  The Hearst was our favorite.  It had truffle oil, mozzarella, wild mushrooms, pancetta (and originally goat cheese too).  It was a perfect marriage of flavors with the two cheeses, and the woodsiness of the mushrooms and slight saltiness oft he pancetta.  And we love our truffle oil!  I would have just like the crust cooked a little more to get some crisp to it.  \n\nWe were still a little hungry, so we got the Lucas pizza too, which I was honestly eyeing too!  It was topped with apple slices, gorgonzola, proscuitto, arugula, garlic oil, mozzarella, and ricotta.  The pizza was quite rich with the assortment of cheeses and that stanky gorgonzola.  The salty, savory and sweet elements were enjoyable.  I used to love gorgonzola, but now I find it a little too strong for me, I think if it weren't for the gorgonzola I would have loved the pie, although we all enjoyed it, the Hearst was the winner.  Again, I thought the crust could be crispier.  \n\nI'm so glad I finally got to check out Archive.  It's a great place to grab a drink and some dinner or munchies with a couple of friends.

I used to have the occasional porchetta panini there, and it was good eatin' albeit pretty greasy for a coldly impersonal colleague lunch. Except for the three thin-crust pizzas on their menu, the Italianate influence has disappeared in favor of new American bar bites.

There were empty seats at the bar, so I parked myself while perusing their brief lunch menu (photo: http://bit.ly/1cw7bDi).

It was drizzled with an Asiago cream dressing that lent a bit of tartness to the plate (photo: http://bit.ly/18QaPtO). I enjoyed the salad, and it made me want to come back with a friend to try one of their pizzas and a house drink like the Atlas Apple which features strong cider, chai, walnut bitters and spiced pear foam. Sounds perfect for this time of the year.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...refreshing salad, simple and tasty\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...turn-of-the-last-century vibe with a contemporary twist\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and jovial\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice addition to the local bar scene, looking forward to their full food menu", "author": "Ed U."}

I was hesitant about having squash and pomegranate seeds in my pizza, but the flavor came together really well and it was on the lighter side. One order can easily be split for 2 and we were even able to add in a side of Mac n cheese (which I highly recommend). They don't have a full liqueur license so drinks are a little limited. We ordered the sangria rose and it was pretty light and was on the sweeter side. Don't let it fool you though, I definitely felt that drink later", "author": "Rebecca L."}

I came with a few friends the Friday before Labor Day and it wasn't too crowded around 5:30 PM. \n\nFrom memory, I think their Happy Hour is weekdays 3-6 PM and the specials included $6 Spring Sangria, $4 beers, and $4 house red/white wines. Unfortunately they didn't have a printed Happy Hour menu or sign, despite older pictures on Yelp. And they also didn't have a Happy Hour price on food, which was sad because I enjoyed their Sutro pizza with its whole garlic and fresh ricotta cheese...mmm. I guess I'll just have to get this during regular lunch or dinner!\n\nWe only came for a couple of Spring Sangrias and they were strong! Not a bad deal for $6, but they were on the smaller side.

It was my first stop for something to eat when I arrived in San Fran and after I checked into my hotel. It seems like a bar restaurant that attracts the young, local business folk. I felt like maybe I was the only tourist. Dim mood lighting but still showing sports on the tv, it was a nice balance of trendy artisan pizza spot and place you could go to calmly watch a game. \n\nI enjoyed a seasonal sangria that had apple and cinnamon spices. It was good, but I would have preferred it to be more spiced. It still tasted somewhat summery. All in all pretty good though.\n\nIt was sort of late for lunch so I decided to have a pork belly slider and the cheese plate. The slider was on happy hour special so it was a dollar off. I didn't think it was all that good. The pork wasn't so flavorful and tasted a little like the oil it may have been heated in. I could have done without it. \n\nThe cheese plate was really very good. I believe it came with 3 or 4 cheeses, all cut in thin triangular slices, with a generous 3 or 4 slices each. It came with round toasted bread slices and square crackers as well as honey, a fig jam and some toasted spiced nuts. I don't know what kind of cheeses there were - the waitress thought they were some kind of goat, but I would have expected them to be creamier if that was the case. It would have been nice if the staff knew the cheeses they included, but luckily I like almost all cheeses so I wasn't worried. There was only one I didn't eat because it was just kind of dull in comparison to the others. The fig jam was sweet and thick and sticky and complimented all these cheeses, as did the honey. The nuts were a nice additional snack. The plate was really filling. \n\nFor what it's worth, their pizzas looked pretty delicious. I just didn't want to spoil my dinner, otherwise I would have considered. \n\nI liked the atmosphere, the crowd, the cheese plate and the pizza (in theory).

All the sandwiches are sizable and delicious.\n\nThe real star of the show is the pizza. With sausage, pepperoni, black olives, mozzarella, and organic tomato sauce, the Moscone ($16) was tasty. The thin-to-medium crust is cooked perfectly to a nice light brown. Light and airy it is more chewy than crispy, but still nicely done. Very flavorful, the Hearst ($15) sports white truffle oil, goat cheese, fresh mozzarella, wild mushrooms huge hunks of bacon.\n\nDinner adds various \"Bites and Boards,\" ranging from the amazingly creamy truffle orzo Mac and cheese ($8) to bacon and feta meatballs ($10.50) served with fresh basil and a hearty tomato sauce. \n\nA few local craft beers are on tap. The well-priced but short wine list features west coast wines with a few offerings from Argentina. Although Archive Bar & Kitchen lacks a full liquor license, it does offer some \"cocktails\" beaded on sake or Ron Copa Rica wine-based \"rum.\"\n\nA warning: it gets crowded at lunch and happy hour, so be prepared.\n\nFor lunch or happy hour, you can't go wrong at Archive Bar & Kitchen.", "author": "CJ G."}

I like that he cares about the quality of his food.\n\nPizza is a decent thin crust, but the crust is nothing to rave about. I prefer the edges to be the crusty chewy bulbous kind as seen on a good neopolitan pizza fired in a high-temp oven. They don't serve that style here. The toppings on the squash pizza and the meat one were both tasty though. Wish they were a little more liberal with some of the ingredients. By comparison for example, Casey's Pizza is more generous and more to my liking in general. I'd give this pizza a 3, and something like Delfina a 5 in the thin crust department.\n\nI'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since they're so new that the food will be even better as they get into a good groove.

Whether I stop by with colleagues for an alfresco lunch or drop in for after-work cocktails, that warm and fuzzy casual feel is always in the air. The manager/owner is usually around and seems super invested in his patrons' experience - what a nice guy!\n\nI've tried their cheese plate and also the pizza. My choice of pie arrived piping hot and topped with bacon, mushrooms, goat cheese, and garlic. I opted for the gluten-free crust and it was phenomenal... I had to stop myself from eating the last three pieces as it was that delicious, yet I was full! Of course, it made for great leftovers.\n\nNot that many people know about Archive yet, and even fewer know about their wonderful cocktails and specialty sodas and lemonades. Throw in a well-curated wine list and some decent craft brews and this is a bar I'll never say 'no' to. Only drawback I can think of?

After a bit of deliberation, we ended up ordering the Hearst (for the truffle oil) and the Garcia (for that soft egg, mm).\n\nUnfortunately, both of us were a little disappointed with our orders. While prepared and baked well, both our pizzas were a bit lacking in flavor and depth: the Hearst, despite having ingredients that have great flavor on their own, fell short, being overwhelmed by the saltiness of the prosciutto; the Garcia, on the other hand, was much tastier, but was almost completely lacking in truffle flavor. We ended up supplementing our slices heavily with chili flakes to boost the flavor.\n\nTo be fair, their pizza is not terrible, and is better than that of Zero Zero - all things considered, in another city, I'd probably give Archive a solid three stars. But, given the selection of high quality pizza in the city (Little Star, for example), I can't really see myself coming back here.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A smallish venue consisting mostly of high-top counter seating, or high-top tables.

Can't say that I had one that I disliked. Each pie would be more than a formidable meal for one person to take down and they were split amongst our group well. I'm a fan of the crust, too. Nice and chewy with some well-done/crunchy/crispy spots, too. Favorites were the varieties with veggies and goat cheese. The few with meats were equally good. \n\nProbably the most minute, yet, still notable item on the menu is the rosemary lemonade. It was fantastic.

They have a pretty sweet happy hour deal -- $2 off pizzas (which are from $13-$15 each), $2 off drafts, $5 house wines, and $6 sangria. They don't have a ton of draft selection, but what they do have is quality. I recommend getting their amber selection. Realllll good. Only complaint with their beers is that it's not quite a pint. I can't imagine paying the normal $7 for a little more than a soda-sized glass beer. Their sangria is a also little lacking - both in size and in flavor. I didn't like it, and the girlfriend definitely didn't like it (she made me drink it). Better stick with their house wine or beer. Their cocktails are reasonably priced and sound great, but I didn't get a chance to try one, so I won't venture out there. \n\nOverall, it's a nice place to hang out if you want to grab some drinks for happy hour and a quick bite to eat.

I mean Delfina good (ok there is no such thing, Delfina is the best)ok, La Nebbia good or at least beretta good. Nope. The crust sucked and the rest of the pizza was mediocre. It's not even farina good and that's as far as I'm willing to go when I pay $15+ for a pie. Won't be returning.

Archive was just the ticket. A friendly man, who I can only assume is the owner/manager, greeted us at the door and immediately accommodated our group in their quaint indoor seating area - no wait on a Wednesday night. Shortly after squeezing us in, they expanded our table to more comfortably seat us and never once rushed us out or gave us any side-eye when we settled in for 2+ hours to chat and catch up. \n\nTheir house pizzas listed on the menu will give your decision making skills a run for their money since they all sound so enticing. Truffle mushrooms? Yes, please. My girl Trish threw some roasted onions on hers like a boss, I suggest doing that. I settled on the house pepperoni, which I only had the self control to stop eating after I looked down at only two slices left (all else eaten by moi.) Que embarrassing. \n\nThe cider they serve on tap out of Portland is really great, the cheese plate was legit and plenty to share among the group. It was served with fig spread, honey, and gluten free crackers for our intolerant friends - something the friendly boss man picked up on without us even asking. \n\nFrom now on, Archive will be on my list of musts when visiting the Bay Area.", "author": "Gloria C."}

Service is friendly and efficient. Lucas is great, too. \n\nSometimes the balance of ingredients is inconsistent (I think the pourer must have fallen out of the truffle oil one time, because it was so rich and oily I couldn't eat it), but usually it's awesome. Sized to split with a lunch date-- add a salad if you're hungry or need more variety/texture in your meal, but I usually don't need it. \n\nArchive is new enough that you can still find a table without waiting more than 5-10 mins (or no wait, if you arrive just before the lunch rush at noon), but parties larger than two may have to wait longer for one of the larger tables. \n\nOverall, solid food and service without an over-complicated menu. I'm lucky and cursed this place is so close to my office!\n\nUPDATE: having been back several times since I wrote this review (by myself and with a lunch date), I'd (regretfully) steer clear of pizza IF you are in a time-sensitive situation. Twice in the last month it took about 40 minutes from ordering to reaching the table, leaving not much time to eat and enjoy before your next meeting. But the salads and sandwiches are solid alternatives, so at least there's that. \n\nMy guess is a lot if people are ordering them now so the queue for limited oven space is longer than it used to be. On a relaxing lunch where you have time to linger, not a big deal. But when you only have an hour, it can be stressful to watch the clock and worry if you'll get back on time.", "author": "Krista L."}

If I were a banker/lawyer type looking for a local spot for a good lunch/late day drink.* Since I have left those suits to hang in my guest bedroom closet, I'll just plan on coming here for a good lunch/midday drink.**\n\nSince you're, likely, here with a group o' folks, go for the pizza. The pizza here's really good, easily shared and comes with an interesting variety of toppings. Whilst gorging, I sampled the Hearst (truffle oil, goat cheese, mushrooms, & bacon: delicious; I'd order again), Moscone (sausage, pepperoni and black olives: tasty but nothing too out of the ordinary), Garcia (speck, asparagus, arugula, garlic oil &, an egg: egg on pizza = always good), and the Drake (kale, cherry tomatoes, sauteed onions, Calabrian chili, goat cheese, & cheese cream sauce: fantastic, fancy and delicious). Because I'm a fatty and was eating with other fatties, I also sampled the pulled pork sandwich (bbq sauce and jalapeno-cilantro slaw: a mighty tasty sandwich). To cut all the fatty food, I enjoyed a refreshing hibiscus/hum beverage. Four years after first having hum, I still have zero idea what the h it is -- other than refreshing & sweet... plus, it's made from hibiscus so that means it's totally healthy and will add another 80 years to my life. That's how it works.\n\n*I would say 'after work' but we both know you're not getting out of the office any time before 7/8 if you're big firm'ing it these days.\n**Much better.", "author": "Johnny T."}

I'm not too big of a fan of thin crust but this place has made me second guess that.\n\nI came here with a few coworkers during lunch and were seated immediately. We ordered two pizzas and a salad:\n\nGarcia Pizza ($16) - Arugula, parmesean and mozzarella cheese, garlic oil, asparagus, and FRESH FARM EGG. Can't hate an egg on a pizza. The egg was cooked to perfect medium so it wasn't oozey and gushy all over the pizza that would've made it messy to eat. And I hate arugula but I could barely notice it.\n\nHearst Pizza ($15) - MY FAVE. White truffle oil, mushrooms, bacon, goat and mozzarella cheese. I went crazy over this pizza and it was all I really ate. I love truffle oil because it gives an extra distinguishable flavor to every dish. Did I also mention that I love mushrooms? And who hates bacon? There was a lot of delectable flavors going on in this pizza.\n\nChicories ($11) - Choices, Gorgonzola, apples, toasted almonds with a honey-lemon vinaigrette. I don't eat salad nor do I like it but if I must eat then I will choose the salad that has the most sweets and a vinaigrette dressing to mask the taste of the leaves and this salad did just that. Good but nothing special or out of the ordinary. You can add chicken for $3 extra if you like.\n\nThe pizzas are a bit on the smaller size but when it tastes this good I don't feel like I'm getting jipped. The crust was soft yet crunchy at the same time and that's hard to do. Our server was attentive and was always there to refill our waters without asking and came to check up on us often. This place DEFINITELY beats Zero Zero and I will certainly be back.", "author": "Kristina D."}

Thank Gaga for Archive...\n\nWhen we walked up, the nicest guy was at the door to greet us (I'm pretty sure he was either the owner or the manager). They quickly seated us and sent over a super-friendly server who could not have been lovelier. I explained this wheat-free nonsense to her, and she didn't bat an eyelash. She told me they had wheat-free pizzas! Yippee!\n\nBefore our pizzas came out, we got a cheese board that was filled with some tasty treats--no blue cheese (hooray!) and wheat-free crackers! Oh, it's always the little things. And then our pizzas came out... delicious! I couldn't have been happier with my 5-cheese pizza. For a little while, I completely forgot that I couldn't eat like I used to. \n\nDuring our amazing dinner, we stayed and laughed and gabbed for over two hours, and not once did the staff make us feel rushed.

I came on a Friday night with a friend and there were spots open at the bar.\n\n- Prosciutto/Burrata Plate (~$13): I'm not sure what this was called or what the price was, but it was in the appetizer section. It comes on a wooden slab, with freshly cut prosciutto (you can see the prosciutto rolls in the back near the restrooms), burrata, cornichons, toasted almonds, and 4 pieces of toast. The quality of ingredients and flavor combination is on-point.\n\n- Hearst Pizza ($15): The Hearst comes with truffle oil, goat cheese, fresh mozzarella, wild mushrooms, and pancetta. The pizza was a bit smaller than I envisioned, but they load it with toppings and the dough is the perfect fluffiness. The mushrooms, in particular, were very flavorful.\n\n- Spring Sangria ($8/glass): This is a pretty small glass with a lot of ice, but the wine is pretty high quality. The strawberry-passion fruit puree did not overpower the natural flavor of the wine.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual dinner with good drinks, Archive is a good choice!", "author": "Jessica F."}

I've been here several times and never been disappointed, and all the times I've been we've been able to find a seat pretty quickly.\n\nMy friends and I definitely enjoyed the selection of drinks, and each time tried something different and new. My favorite thing about this place is the food options. The social board (cheese, meat, crackers, and various nuts/spreads) is fantastic, and they really give you a generous amount. I've found in the past that other places tend to skimp on the cheese and meat, but here, we've always had plenty to go around and we've run out of bread/crackers first. They also have a good variety of cheeses, meats, spreads, nuts, and olives, which I appreciate as well.\n\nWe've tried the pizzas a few times and always enjoyed those as well.

We got here shortly after happy hour started at 3 on Friday because we wanted to beat the after work rush. The place was completely empty but the waitress crowded the 9 of us into a table that seats 6-7, acting annoyed that we showed up at the end of her shift. We ordered some drinks and food and were subjected to some more indifferent if not downright rude service. After an hour, one person in our party left and another person used the empty stool to place their coat. Since we were huddled in a crowded table, there were just not enough hooks underneath. The manager immediately comes over and tells my friend to place his coat on his lap so the stool can be moved back to the bar, where again, no one was seated! We had planned on running up a big tab because the boss was paying but left before any after-work crowds came in, so we can't vouch for how crowded it might get. I don't understand why the management would want to foster such an unwelcoming environment. We were a courteous, professional group of people and were made to feel  like our business was not appreciated there. \n\nOn a side note, the guy busing the table and the waitress who came in toward the end were pleasant but unfortunately the manager and earlier waitress set a bad tone for the establishment.", "author": "Mimi N."}

A guy comes in 5 mins. later, places order and tells the bar tender he would be back in 10 mins.  10-15 go by; guy comes back for his order and he's out.  I sit, i have a glass of water.  i ask the bar tender to check on my order, now the place is getting crowded.  People who have come in far after me are picking up orders and leaving or even worse, being served!  I see in the distance, the person making the pizzas place a box on top of the oven and just leave it there.  Didn't think much of it.  10-15 min's go by, bartender says that my order should be up soon and that they had just put it in the last time he checked.  I wait some more, more people come in, order and leave.  By now, I'm asking REALLY??  Can you check on my order?  I say, \"I saw the guy put a box on top of the oven 20 min's ago\".  Bartender goes over, takes the box off the top of the oven, turns out it was my order.  He slides it across the bar without so much as an apology for the inconvenience and never even looks at me.  UNBELIEVABLE.  Service is as important as food quality.  Neither were good today.  I wish I can say what I'm really thinking but I don't want yelp to delete my post! haha!", "author": "RastaGirl J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-27", "description": "Wow. I used to love this place. Awesome salads, pizza, sandwiches etc. Today, I got served raw chicken. All 7 of us had ordered chicken and after 3 of us tasted my chicken, it was unanimous that my chicken was raw (the pink color and fact it was cold in the center did not help...). When we approached the waiter, he said that this is how they serve chicken. We told him that none of the other chicken tasted raw. He then retorted: 'maybe next time don't order the chicken'. Not only was the chicken raw, but they messed up on 60% of our order (adding chicken to a pizza when we asked for it on the side, serving chicken chunked on a salad when we asked them to serve it in strips on the side, not tossing in the dressing on the salad, adding anchovies to a salad we asked to have no anchovies...). And when we complained about our incorrect orders, we got nothing but bad attitude from the servers. So if you want to get food poisoning and awful service with the head waiter/(owner?) talking back to you, this place is for you! As for me, I will not be going back and neither will anyone in my company.", "author": "Izzi T."}

Good examples include subtle and cool lights and very cool glass votives that have old school slides of SF attached to them (so that you can see them with the light of the candle).\n\nHad the homemade sangria which was a great mix of spicy and sweet with the right amount of fruit served in a cute glass.  My wife asked the waitress to just pick a nice white wine and her choice was great.\n\nDefinitely recommend the squash and arugula pizza.  Excellent cheese on top and perfect crispiness.  \n\nProbably my favorite part is the owner, Kevin, who is both behind the bar but also checking on everyone to ensure everything is perfect.  Super nice guy who clearly is interested in everyone having a nice time.  \n\nParking on a Saturday night was close and secure nearby.\n\nI'm definitely coming back.", "author": "Todd C."}

The food is delicious (had a couple pizzas, and they were both fantastic!), and the fun, creative drinks were excellent (the owner makes speciality drinks). The ambiance was very 1920's antique- LOVED it!  Service was solid, and the owners are very kind and involved in the service- you don't find that too often anymore.  Two thumbs up for this new spot...can't wait to come back!!", "author": "Erika L."}

The prosciutto and burrata cheese appetizer plate is a must! It's amazing - the best I've had so far. I also recommend their Cezar salad - I'm usually not a fan of this salad but it's great here - totally worth trying and I'm sure you won't regret it.", "author": "Alex M."}

The place just recently opened, and they're still adding a few things (e.g. didn't have an espresso machine yet when I visited). The menu is very limited, but if everything is as good as the sandwich I had, they'll be a go-to place for our office.", "author": "Massimo A."}

For the Margarita, the use of corto oil, the perfect thickness of the crust, and liberal and evenly distributed fresh mozzarella are all much appreciated.

Mission St in FiDi definitely needed something like this, so it's a great addition to the HH spots. I enjoyed their wine - thought I'm not sure they were actually HH prices.... maybe I came too late.

Don't sleep on the Caesar Salad, the anchovies are special with an olive oil and lemon twist. Pizzas are great, drinks plentiful and atmosphere is cozy. We met the chef (Matt), our server Dennis and the owner who made us feel special and really cared how our food and service was. This was our first time here and we'll be back. Great place, don't miss it, joe.", "author": "Joe G."}

The wait was a bit longer than expected...over 30 minutes from order to being served but well worth the it! I'll definitely be back just not at noon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-09", "description": "My review is based solely on  my take out order.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, which looked good, but lacked flavor.  I understand chicken breast typically can be dry at times, but the chicken in their sandwich was extremely dry.  Dry to the point where if you don't have something to drink with it, you could possibly choke.  Also, the chicken had no seasoning, it tasted like a dry bland piece of nothing.  The bread was decent, and what visibly looked like aioli dressing, did not taste like it.  I was able to eat most of the sandwich and not taste a thing.  The pizza looked good, but I will not try it after eating possibly the worst sandwich Ive had in the financial district.  Definitely will not return for the food.", "author": "Ron R."}
