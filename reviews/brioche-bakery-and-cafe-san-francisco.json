I had the eggs Benedict (which is something I usually avoid due to its absolute basic-ness) and maybe because I hadn't consumed this specific item in so long, it was amazing! The eggs were perfectly runny, the bread buttery, the sauce tasty... but I know for sure that those potatoes were possibly the best brunch potatoes I have ever had - so crispy on the outside! I liked that they even included the fruit bowl. Although I had to remind the waiter I ordered a drink, the latte was great. My friend's French toast was delicious also.

People who are writing \"cute Parisian vibe\" and similar twaddle have obviously never been to Paris. This is a totally unremarkable, sub-standard cafe with nothing going for it other than a good location in a heavily touristed area.\n\nI went here a year ago for lunch, found it disappointing, and, just today, went to check whether anything had changed. Nope. Here's what I had:\n- Croissant: at 3pm, this tasted stale and dry. There was a remnant of a buttery inside, but it's no prize winner. It was also unfortunately large and ill-shapen; a work of careless craftsmanship.\n- Apple crumble: pure sugar, with an aged and cold interior. This one's been sitting here for a while. \n- Latte: absolute swill. My latte machine at work could deliver a better drink. It is a large, 16oz latte, but it's totally unpalatable all the same. As I write this review, related recent reviews show that a man named \"Michal\" has given Brioche five stars with the explanation that the \"lattes are huge\", which makes me wonder (a) what exactly the bar is for getting a five-star review in this dude's book and (b) if all you care about is quantity, then I've got some dishwater to sell to you.", "author": "John L."}

Came here with my date for a super late brunch on a Sunday.\n\nVenue / service: cute Parisian cafe vibe inside.  Small tables that are close to each other.  You place your order at the front and sit down with a number, after which they'll bring your food to you.  Staff were nice and seemed patient from the little interaction we had with them.\n\n-- French Onion Soup (served gratin\u00e9ed with croutons and Gruyere)($5.25) - unfortunately a massive miss, and we both agree on this.  Severely under-seasoned; both of us commented that it could have used a LOT of salt (and we usually don't make a comment like that).  Not a lot of cheese either- it literally was one slice of gruyere and you couldn't get a bite of cheese with every bite.\n\n-- Spinach & Gruyere Omelet (saut\u00e9ed organic baby spinach and onions with Gruyere cheese, served with oven roasted rosemary potatoes and fruit. Add bacon or chicken apple sausage +$3.75)($11.75) - again, slightly under-seasoned, probably could have used a different cheese.  At least they loaded it with a lot of spinach so you feel somewhat healthy for eating your veggies, though the overall effect was still heavy.  Potatoes were non-eventful, and the fruit was ok (the watermelon wasn't sweet at all).  Chicken sausage at least was moist and flavorful.\n\n-- Chicken Pot Pie (forgot price) - probably the best dish we had that day.  The filling inside was slightly different (a bit redder color-wise) than your typical filling, but quite tasty!  Lot of chicken chunks and a decent amount of veggies.  Only wish there was a crust at the bottom of the pie.\n\nAll together, with a green tea, the price came out to less than $40.  Not sure if it was worth it more.  Maybe we didn't order the right stuff, but not sure I'll be back... I feel like I could get a better brunch somewhere else.", "author": "Audrey H."}

We ordered the Avocado scramble, Vanilla brioche French toast, fresh squeezed OJ, and a side of bacon.\n\nWe grabbed the fresh squeezed OJ and a table outside since it was a nice sunny day. The OJ was delicious and refreshing, I would recommend trying it. \nAbout 10-15 minutes later our food arrived to our table. \n\nThe Avocado scramble: Half a slice of avocado thinly sliced over a well cooked pile of eggs with 2 handfuls of oven roasted potatoes and a small cup of cut fruit. The size of the meal was standard for the price, the eggs were cooked well, but wish there had been more avocado.\n\nVanilla Brioche French toast - Sounds fancy and delicious but is small and disappointing for the price. 3 half slices of approximately regular sized bread, not fully battered with egg and sprinkled on top with powdered sugar and a few strawberries and raspberries. Comes with syrup. \n:( I was hoping for this dish to be the highlight of the meal, but I make better French toast at home (my French toast is nothing great). Not worth the $.\n\nThe side of bacon - Was completely burnt. When I say completely I mean completely. I tried to eat half of one piece but it was just not enjoyable/worth it to pay for burnt bacon so we asked if we could have a new plate instead. They immediately took back our plate and gave us a replacement plate 5 minutes later. The second plate was definitely way better! :) Someone from the staff came to check on us to make sure things were okay after the bacon fail, which was nice. \n\nPros:\n- No line\n- Outside and inside seating available\n- Good for reading a book or studying inside \n- Good customer service \n\nThings to note:\n- Not good for groups, tables are very small\n- Very noisy if you sit outside as the Muni stop is right where you are sitting/fire engines seem to use this road particularly \n- Chairs outside are folding chairs (no cushions) that you might use in your backyard if you have too many people over for a party \n\nOverall a casual cafe to grab a bite or drink to go, have coffee with a friend or study, but I wouldn't come back for brunch solely based on the quality of the food.", "author": "Saachi G."}

But we were both DROOLING gazing at all of the items that were displayed at their tent. I asked the kind lady what bakery this was, and she said Brioche Bakery in SF. \n\nTook the boo here, and we came for a light breakfast/brunch. I'm usually pretty over the SF brunch scene because waiting for an hour or more is not on my to-do list early in the morning. But Brioche was not a \"brunch spot\" and instead, more of a bakery with breakfast items like french toast or croque monsier's to order. They have French items, but also quick baked goods like quiches at the ready...and lasagna too. We shared the french toast and spinach/tomato quiche. Both were delicious and warm, as we decided to sit inside and enjoy our morning meal. They have serve-yourself water and a variety of seating--they share indoor space with what looks like a winery that is closed in the morning. There are a few outdoor seating options for those with dogs or people wanting a smoke. \n\nEverything was delicious and the wait for food was maybe a solid 10-15 minutes. Not bad.

I took one look at the menu, and decided to have lunch here instead. The salmon sandwich immediately stood out to me, so I quickly ordered one, which came with a side salad for just over $9.\n\nThere are two seating areas, one where you order food, and another to the left of it that serves as a wine bar in the evenings. I grabbed a seat in the wine bar, and was impressed by the natural lighting, and the simple fixtures and decor. The food arrived in just about 10 minutes, and the waiter was extremely sweet and offered me a refill on my water and brought out a hot sauce at my request.\n\nThe sandwich was out of this world! There was so much salmon on that sandwich that I felt like I should have paid twice as much, just for the salmon. The bread was wheat, and had a tasty lemon infused aioli applied to it, with the huge slices of salmon, lots of capers, and an additional 2-3 lemon slices. Every bite was just as flavorful and filling as the previous one. The salad was mixed greens, and had a vinegar based dressing, that had fruity hints. \n\nI could not believe I was able to score such quality food, both portion and taste wise for under $10.

I'm always up for checking out new bakeries, so when I saw Brioche was nearby and you get a freebie for checking in, I decided to check it out. The freebie that particular month was a cup of coffee (not much more can be expected, I guess), and I also decided to give their Brioche (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EHqmJ1bEnBACNzNBrvKSTg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg) a try since they were sold out of a lot of other baked goods by 1pm on a Saturday. The brioche was pretty good but not amazing, but the worst part about stopping by here was the unfriendly staff. I felt like they gave me the evil eye for asking them about what my freebie was for checking in on Yelp, even though I ended up purchasing something after, and other people that I brought in ended up purchasing items too. \n\nThis cafe is on the smaller side, so not that many tables and you'll be cozy with your neighbors. After this experience, I don't think I would return. Parking in this area can be tough since it always seems to be difficult to find a spot, even with a decent amount of street parking spots technically available.", "author": "Amy D."}

For the price point (just under $9), I like to get one and eat it for breakfast two mornings in a row.

So walking around North Beach we found this little bakery/cafe. We weren't really hungry so it's caffeine time. \n\nThey have their menu on a chalk board and you basically order at the counter and then they bring your food to your table. I'm into iced coffee now so I just ordered a Iced Mocha. Took a little while for the mocha to come out, but the lady apologized to us. They just got so busy and only a few people working in the back. That's okay cause we weren't in a hurry today.\n\nReally good iced mocha. Not too bitter and they give you a nice big cup. Very satisfying overlooking Columbus street and watching the traffic go by. \n\nAfter awhile my wife got hungry and ordered their Grilled Chicken Salad. Hugh and looked really good. The salad had some Chinese noodles with so many vegetables. The dressing seemed like a homemade dressing which wasn't to sweet and had a tiny kick to it. Only downside to this salad  was the chicken. Seemed like they slices the chicken and then put is in the grill to make it into grilled chicken. Not a problem with that but it made the chicken really dry. Had to drink something to down the dry chicken. \n\nNice little place with hot and cold sandwiches, pastries, and of course coffee. They have a very tiny kitchen in the back when making their food. Really enjoyed it and love checking out these little cafe in North Beach. Another great find.", "author": "Doug T."}

This stretch of columbus is well worth exploring as there are quite a few really nice eating and drinking places on this block.\n\nAs far as the parking goes it's street only, so like most things in this area it's best to ditch the car. \n\nThere is both inside and outside seating, and the while the outside seating may not be the best choice before the morning chill burns off, it's a great choice later on. The inside seating ranges from larger tables/bench items (perfect for groups) to snug little two spots with great street views. The inside has lots of muted pastel coloring(blue and white for the counter area, amber/burnt orange type stuff for the seating area) with both natural and artificial light. It works to make a nice mellow effect. \n\nThis place specializes in breakfast, especially and including quiche, which is a standout item. The coffee and chai options are good verging on great. The croissants are perfect. The other pastries are superior to what you'll find in many other like minded establishments. Other super awesome choices are the tartine(any of them) and the varuios sandwich choices. They do a mean panini. They also have some heavier choices such as omelette's et al. The service is better then I've come to expect in the area. They have a kind of ma and pop feel(the good kind of ma and pop that is) even though they aren't really a ma and pa kind of business. In the morning they seem to have a particular ability to listen to our fussy special ordering group was wanting. Well done Brioche.\n\nPricing? Yeah, well it's San Francisco. If you are eating and can keep it to a ten to fifteen dollar plate, you are making out like a bandit. Coffee and a sweet could run you 5-7 bucks depending on choices made.\n\nPerfect for a cafe style light breakfast and coffee and/or a soup salad style lunch.", "author": "Steven W."}

It's a hidden gem as it's right across from the Coppolla building (what a beautiful view! :) I've ventured out here for lunch on weekdays as it's a slight getaway from the hustle & bustle of the FIDI. On the weekdays, it's fairly quiet and seating is easy to find. Kinda feels like a mini Parisian getaway.\n\nPretty sweet deal at $8-9 for a sandwich + side salad. My go-to is the poached pear salad - the greens are fresh and the candied pecans + cheese + dried blackcurrants with the pear is just.. perfection all around. They don't skimp on ingredients and it's fresh so I don't feel ripped off! I haven't tried their other lunch options since about 4 years ago when I last came so I can't fairly review those.\nAs for take-away/baked items, I tried a couple loaves of their bread, the sugar brioche, and tiramisu. All fairly priced and delicious! So many other sinful delights in the glass case I must try.. seems promising! Might just order catering for the office soon! The quiche looks freakin BOMB since it's baked in a puff pastry tart.. :0\n\nThe icing on the cake is the staff here is always super friendly and always readily available.

The first is that this is one of the few places in the city that you can actually buy those mini brioche buns which are perfect for making sliders. The second is their almond croissant. It doesn't look like much on the outside but once you have them heat it up and take a bite into it, it is amazing. It is completely filled with a sweet gooey almond filling which will start oozing out if you're not careful. Paired with a hot coffee this is a great way to start the day.\n\nOverall, I appreciate Brioche bakery for both the quality croissant and the various brioche breads they offer. \"I'm a fan.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

I mean sit down like a civilized person and have an herb omelet, a smoked salmon tartine, an endive salad or even a tuna sandwich. Perhaps all at the same time. Maybe wear a beret and an ascot and cradle my pet chihuahua Se\u00f1or Wences in one hand and my fork at the ready in the other. But no, I often find myself walking down Columbus after satiating myself in North Beach likely with pasta or some other unnecessary carb, and that would be the very moment I find myself pondering a need to satisfy a sweet tooth.\n\nA stop at the chaotic Stella Pastry didn't feel quite right nor waiting in the queue at Golden Gate Bakery. Nope, based on my last two visits, I have to say Brioche deserves to be more than an afterthought. The first time I came here was in the evening as the place was half-full with laptoppers and others having light bites for dinner. I was looking for something more decadent and had the $5 slice of the Lemon Pound Cake (photo: http://bit.ly/1ulHhf8) with a $3.25 Latte (photo: http://bit.ly/1BdsFU8). The cake was spongy-good and none too sweet, just the indulgence I wanted to end the day.\n\nI returned months later with Jamie W. after a day out to see the Ai Weiwei art installation on Alcatraz. It was the middle of the afternoon, and the place was buzzing with customers. We decided to try their $1.75 house made Macarons, and sure enough, they are more substantive than the ones at Chantal Guillon and frankly much tastier, too with Salted Caramel and Chocolate particularly hitting the spot (photo: http://bit.ly/1xVzl4E). I took a gander at the Avocado Scramble on the next table and decided it was time to go savory next time. My only quibble?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-26", "description": "Honestly, Chinatown is among the last places you would expect to find the perfect French cafe, but this review is testimony that Brioche proves otherwise.  C'est drole, n'est-ce que pas?\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nI was on my way home looking for a place to get lunch, and all other places I passed by seemed too crowded, too expensive, and/or too generic.  \n\nI must be developing good Yelpy instincts because I chose Brioche purely by storefront impressions, without any consultations with technology whatsoever.  And what do you know, when I consult Yelp after the fact, it turns out I had spotted a 4.5 with my naked eye ;)\n\n[AMBIANCE]\n\nAuthentically French in every sense, except it's quite small given that we're in SF after all.  Besides the somewhat cramped size, it's a charming cafe.  The interior is homey and cozy, furnished and decorated like a kitchen and dining room.  The European feel extends to the exterior with the classic scalloped blue fabric awning.  It's even complete with wicker patio furniture and carefree customers sipping coffee, reading newspapers, and people watching.\n\nSome people ahead of me complained about service, but I thought it was fine.\n\n[FOOD]\n\nNi\u00e7ois sandwich, $7.75 (Mediterranean style tuna salad with extra virgin olive oil, fresh tomatoes, lettuce and chipotle spread on our crusty baguette): I'm extremely picky with sandwiches, but this was pretty close to perfect.  All the ingredients were fresh, and the baguette was fluffy and tasted truly homemade.  All those chain stores that claim to have artisan bread baked fresh daily blah blah blah now appear to be quackery in comparison to Brioche.  Also, it comes with a side salad!  Also fresh and I suspect it's organic.\n\nSpinach and Gruy\u00e8re Omelet, $11.50 (saut\u00e9ed organic baby spinach and onions with Gruy\u00e8re cheese, served with oven roasted rosemary potatoes and artisan organic whole wheat toast): One of the rare places where you can get a wholesome, satisfying brunch without lapsing into food coma afterwards.  The omelet has a nice, thin layer of egg, and they pleasantly don't overdo the cheese.  The potatoes are just the right portion (digging this continued European theme with the European portions), unlike the disgusting heaping pile of fried potatoes at most American brunches.  I really liked the toast, which is on homemade bread (in a beautiful homemade shape, I might add).  It even came with a few pieces of fruit, which was refreshing to finish with.\n\n[CONCLUSION]\n\nI was planning to come for an epic marathon cafe work session, but I didn't get much done.  Perhaps it's the relaxing atmosphere at this charming cafe, whose recurrent European theme predominates over the American workaholic mentality.", "author": "Edna C."}

Yes, the baguette that held my sandwich was stale. No place that purports to be a bakery should serve stale bread. Fresh bread is not just a hope I have when I order something at a bakery, it's an expectation. And they failed to meet it. \n\nNext is the coffee. My latte was bland. No bueno at all. \n\nNow that I've established how this place fails at what it purports to be, I'll move on to tell you about my meal. That sucked too. \n\nI ordered the prosciutto sandwich. They put clumps of brie cheese on it, so that when I ate it I would either bite into a huge chunk of brie that overpowered the whole sandwich, or just bite a portion of sandwich with no cheese on it at all. They should have cut the cheese thinner and spread it more. \n\nAnd the meat was old too. I ate a piece of the prosciutto on its own, because I can just eat that meat itself since it's so good, and I realized the meat was old and going bad. Its coloration had browned and it was very off in flavor. So they basically served me rotting meat that could have gotten me sick. \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't eat here.", "author": "Aiden S."}

You with your Parisian ways and your fresh bread and your fancy shmancy sandwiches. But the truth is, every time I order one of your fancy sandwiches, soups, or pastries, I'm left slightly disappointed (and a whole lot poorer).\n\nYour roast beef sandwich lacks flavor. Your pastries are always slightly stale. And your soup is a little too liquidy. Am I being too picky? Probably. But when I'm paying approximately $15 for a lunch consisting of a take-out soup and sandwich, I guess I'm crazy enough to expect near perfection.\n\nTake your three layer mousse cake. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, topped with a little chocolate cigar. Seems simple enough. Except there's a weird spongy layer in between. And the chocolate mousse feels so light, it has almost no flavor. And the entire concoction feels like it's been sitting in your refrigerated display case for too long. Same with your hazelnut tart. And your chocolate chip cookie.\n\nThe only saving grace is your chocolate croissant which is downright perfect. So perfect that you happen to run out every afternoon. Guess everyone else around me is also in on the secret of your perfect chocolate croissant. So yes, I will keep on coming to your expensive, frou frou little shop. But I'm only getting the chocolate croissant!", "author": "Nadeem A."}

They offer pastries, quiche, sandwiches, paninis, and salads in a cute, cozy, friendly and welcoming environment.\n\nThey have a pretty solid menu filled with different salads, paninis, and sandwiches. My favorite of their paninis is the turkey panini with chipotle spread and jack cheese. There is so much flavor in the chipotle spread and it's easy to see why it has become one of my favorites. The turkey, jack cheese, and chipotle spread easily compliment each other. All paninis come with a mixed green salad, that is extremely fresh. I have also tried their quiche, which is so delicious! It's really creamy and all the vegetables they use are fresh. Definitely another favorite to order there. \n\nService is great - the staff at Brioche are so kind and friendly! \n\nIt's a small cafe, so grab a spot if you see a table.

I was famished after the gym and was excited about the tantalizing array of possibilities that lined the street. Brioche Cafe was amongst the first place that I saw and the charming Parisian atmosphere drew me through its doors. \n\nThe cafe is named after the delectable pastry and the place offered several varieties of brioche. I was in the mood for something savory for dinner and the clerk recommended the Ni\u00e7oise sandwich. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie. I mean, how can one walk out sans any sweets from a bakery? I was told that they make everything in-house in a nearby baking facility.\n\nI was in a hurry so I got the food to-go and chomped on the sandwich as I walked. It felt oddly appropriate that I was gnawing on a phallic sandwich as I passed strip club after strip club. The sandwich was delicious and did not leave me with any regrets for being so decisive and ordering from the first place I saw. The tuna wasn't fishy and as you take more bites and get to the olives and celery bits, it really enhanced the flavor of the sandwich. The chocolate chip cookie was very thin (I wish my cookies spread like that) and crunchy on the outside, but chewy (but still firm in texture) toward the center. It wasn't loaded with massive chunks of chocolate (which I liked) and it's one of the better cookies that I've tried.\n\nI don't know how a gem like this escaped my radar for so long! There were so many tempting options on display (including two varieties of pastilla). I can't wait to go back and try more items. Maybe grab brunch these on a weekend.", "author": "Alice W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-07", "description": "Compliments in a list:\n\n1. My fellow foodie friend shared a giltcity brunch deal with me. Being a spaz that I am, I accidentally bought the \"lunch deal\" vs. the \"brunch deal.\" I happen to LOVE brunch and was standing there, holding my wrinkled print-out voucher, absolutely devastated that I made that boo-boo. The owner (I think?) behind the counter probably sensed our distress, looked over and kindly suggested that if we didn't find something we liked, there were other choices as a substitute. My friend jumped on this opportunity to ask if I could possibly (out of the kindness of her heart) let me switch my \"lunch\" voucher into a \"brunch\" voucher. The owner claimed that was absolutely fine and said all I had to do was pay the difference of the two deals.\n\nI'm sure a lot of places would be willing to do this given this situation...but it's always the attitude of how one handle things that make the biggest difference. From the way the owners here interacted with us, it tells us: this place cares for their customers. Are very down-to-earth. They're probably one of the classic mom n' pop joints that take joy in people enjoying their food than the profit itself.\n\n2. THE FOOD! I ended up ordering eggs benedict, and it was absolutely scrumptious. Actually, when I ordered the eggs benedict, the owner informed me that they were out of Canadian bacon and asked if it was alright to substitute it with ham or salmon. I picked salmon and she didn't charge extra.\n\nLet me say it again. Down-to-earth. Unpretentious. Makes the food taste even better.\n\n3. THE COFFEE! I'm not even a coffee drinker, but I ordered a Chai Latte and tried some of my friend's Iced Mocha, and both were really good! Probably my favorite Chai Latte I've had so far. Previously, I always claimed that the Chai from Mandeville Coffee Cart in UCSD was the best...but, sorry, no longer. This one was very rich and aromatic, which might not float some boats; but if you're sensitive to sweetness, I'm sure you can take advantage of their kindness and ask them to lower the sugar level for you.\n\nPlus, the coffee's fair trade. Controversial feature, I know, but seeing how they didn't charge extra for the salmon, I'd like to hope for the best.\n\n4. THE PASTRIES are really, really good! I got the Raisin Snail (?) and I actually finished it along with my meal. (Yes, I was a little shocked that I ate that much: giant cup of chai, eggs benedict, and a pastry. I had to walk around Chinatown-Powell afterwards to make myself feel better.)\n\n5. I think the only regret I have was not leaving a tip in the tip jar at the very end. Very uncultured of me, I know. But hopefully someone will listen to my 5-star review. And hopefully I'll find myself around the area in the future, and I'll make up for it then.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

My omelette was unsalted, unflavorful, and downright disgusting. There was a whole sprig of rosemary in my omelette, but this was literally just the stem and nothing else. My toast was obscenely dry, no amount of butter could have helped that toast. Finally, my strawberry had an bird feather stuck to it. I wanted to complain and get my money back, but at this point I was so fed up I just left without saying anything.\n\nLooking back I wish I would have gotten my money back.

Because when you're on the way to spend eight hours of sunlight at your corporate torture tower, and some happy folks are taking their sweet time laughing and talking over croissants and coffee at one of Brioche's cute little bistro tables by the window overlooking the Avenue, you think, \"Who are these genius bastards who can sit in bakeries until 10:00am on Tuesdays??\" And then you realize, there by the faux fireplace and the glass case full of pastry, that a lot of the world values this kind of time, and there are places where people don't get up before the sun to pickle their eyes in front of a computer all day. \n\nSo, they have Equator coffees, and though I'm not usually a fan of the super-dark roast, theirs is sweet and smoky and not bitter. Kind of like the people who get to sit in Brioche until whenever they damn well please.", "author": "Megan W."}

I LOVE YOU!  I love your cheese toasts (though I no longer eat them, read on if you'd like to know why...), the pretzels,  the olive bread, the surprise stuff that appears and I don't know what it is but I want it, the cinnamon twists, the chocolate scone things...I have not had one thing I did not like.  Most of what I've had, I love.  It's a problem.  Oftentimes I buy one thing, eat it while buying produce, and go back and buy another before I leave the market. And it's gone within blocks. Damn.\n\nAbout those cheese toasts- I used to rush there to get one before they sold out. But no longer. Why? Well, one, I always got heartburn and queasy after eating it.  And two, I decided to ask one day (jokingly) which was healthier- the toast or a ham and cheese croissant.  The guy said the croissant. I asked why, and he seemed hesitant to tell me. I persisted. That cheese toast, which I obviously knew was greasy, had WAY more fat than even I suspected. If you've had one, you know how oily they are. Well, apparently before they melt that crapload of tasty cheese on top, they brush the bread very liberally with mayonnaise, or rather aioli (what's the difference?).  That would explain the heavy feeling I got after eating it, and the heartburn.  Well, I've had to let that one go. But there's plenty of other amazingly tasty treats to buy. Too many.  \n\nI took my BFF there when she came to visit and she got some thing that was basically flaky/puff pastry (like croissant) layered with butter and sugar. It was like eating a butter pie.

I couldn't tell what it was, so I asked, and the guy said it was a morning bun. I thought those normally had citrus zest (although a quick google shows this is not necessarily the case), and anyway, this one didn't. Instead, it had a pleasantly rich dough and lots and lots of cinnamon and sugar (for the first time, more than I wanted - there was actually about an eighth of an inch disc on the bottom that was near inedible). \n\nThe morning bun was probably a 4, but it was $2.50, and the overall selection didn't seem so great.

The BIG hit was the chicken pot pie - just like your grandmere would make if'n you was french. My salami sandwich and orzo salad were delightful (though too much to eat in one sitting - the sandwich was really big). And we got a few sweet treats to share and review.\n\nThe chocolate chip cookie was deemed \"fine, though nothing special\" which is ok, since it's a french bakery and they really should be excelling at things with FAR more butter in them!!  ;o)\n\nThe raspberry tartlet was really good with a slightly crispyish shell and beautifully deflated whole raspberries nestled amongst the jam base.\n\nBut everyone's fave, hands down, was the chocolate lava cake. Gooey and rich, it was served in a small container and was truly transporting. A lovely, dark mass of sinfully delicious chocolate. Thankfully I only had a bite, otherwise I think I'd be in a food coma right now!\n\nDefinitely will become part of the regular lunch rotation.

Bakers often use frozen dough, which ends up giving over-flaky crust. They also put too much chocolate in there and the chocolate is too sweet, not \"cocoa-y\" enough.\nNone of these at Brioche Bakery.

They did, and I got an apricot one. It was really quite good, with a crispy pastry edge, lots of apricot, and an almond-y custard filling. The girl was rude-ish again, although she again seemed nice to the person in front of me. Two and a half stars for one good snack, one bad one; mediocre rating maintained by snotty service on weekday mornings.*\n\nI went here this morning after much anticipation. When I got to Brioche around 7:40am, I noticed that the dude in front of me was a regular, as the counter girl recognized him and was accommodating, offering to heat his order. That made me happy and expectant that my experience would be equally friendly. Not the case. I asked if there was any jam (I wasn't going to order a plain brioche without it) and she looked exasperated about having to check (which required that she look over her shoulder) and gave a curt \"yeah\". I then asked for a brioche to eat there and a single espresso (which was spelled 'expresso' on the wall, and pronounced the same by the girl). My espresso request also garnered exasperation and diverted eye contact. I told her she could get the drink after helping the only lady in line, but she ignored me and proceeded to make the shot and then bark \"HERE is your exPRESSo\". Whatevs.   \nI sat down to eat and was pretty disappointed in the brioche: it was dry and crumbly and cold, not chewy and moist like I wanted. I don't eat that much brioche, but I think it's supposed to have the latter qualities, yes? I ate the round top and, while I knew I was pushing my luck, I asked the girl (who was doing nothing) if she wouldn't mind \"sticking the rest in the oven for a minute\", like she'd done for the dude who'd ordered before I did. \"Sure.\" \nShe brought it back literally 30 seconds later so that the top of it was barely warmed. \n \nI might go back here and revise my rating, but only because there were these danish-y looking things that involved mixed fresh fruit over custard in a pastry shell ...and I love both custard and fruit. I should have ordered that, but it only seemed right to first judge the place based on its namesake. \nThe girl was borderline rude, but I'll tell myself that she's much better qualified than slinging pastries lets her express(o)....", "author": "Aimee F."}
