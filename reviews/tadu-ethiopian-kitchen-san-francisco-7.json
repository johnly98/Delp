This was my first time having Ethiopian food, so I don't have much to compare against.\n\nThis place is fast-casual, which I'm not the biggest fan of as it usually means that you pay a bit more for mediocre food. I'm the type of person who would either pay more for very high quality food or pay less for big portions and have quality suffer a bit, so fast-casual is kind of a no-man's land for me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nAs for the food itself, it was pretty tasty.

Ambiance: It's loud but comfortable and they there's wonderful Ethiopian decorations. there are no wait staff. you order at the front and they bring it to you. \n2. Food: the stews are all very flavorful. Their spicy hot powder, available by request, is just what you'd need to bring the heat up a notch\n3. Tadu is Vegetarian & Vegan friendly. They know their ingredients so they can advise which dishes will suit those with self imposed dietary restrictions. \n4. they take apple pay and other digital currency. i tried to pay with bitcoin but their PoS stystems don't accept this yet. \n\nI can give Tadu five stars because even though i usually reserve it for restaurants who offer vegan proteins (e.g. TVP, Gardein, Beyond Meat etc.).

This came along with a side of injera for the table (sour spongy rolls). The injera was a great vehicle to soak up all the various juices on the plate.  Although my friend and I ordered two separate dishes, they came together on a large plate, separated by an aisle of salad.\n\nThe lamb was in good portion, tender enough (although more tender is always welcome), with a good lamb taste without being overwhelming. I liked how they let the lamb flavor shine through without dousing it in any sort of sauce. It left a little bit of heat in your mouth after eating it, but was not on the tongue sort of spicy. The meat was all meat (instead of some fat / sinew plus meat)-- I really would have wanted more chewy, but this is a personal preference. The lentil side was all mashed up, with good flavor from the spices. \n\nThey weren't really doing rounds to fill up water, and the water was located behind the counter-- perhaps a filling station might be helpful! A bit short of 3.5/5 for me given the price and lack of service.

The injera is squishy and spongy--it's the perfect vehicle for absorbing the delicious sauces and such that go inside. The dishes themselves are huge and satisfying. We got the kitfo wrap and the gomen besiga, and it came with various lamb cubes in sauce, a salad, and collard greens. I'd say generally the food was hearty, sour, and savory in the best ways.

I enjoyed the hearty and flavor-filled Ethiopian dishes at the still thriving original location a lot, but the walk over there did not provide me with as much pleasure since it's way deep in the 'Loin (review: http://bit.ly/2J1bhMl). Granted, Mission Bay is a lot more sterile and youth-oriented as a neighborhood with a lot of ongoing construction. Yet, taking a leisurely stroll through Mission Creek Park to get here is a lot better for my urban-sensitive nerves than the walk up war-torn Leavenworth, and the interior here is far more modern and spacious to draw me in more than once.\n\nThe menu is just as robust here as it is in the 'Loin, and I've ordered the same dish on both my visits, the $15.90 Vegetarian Combo Platter, which offers the best of their homestyle cooking over a hidden flat of spongey injera (photo: http://bit.ly/2GkMt4h). It was quite a presentation dominated by five distinct specialties, all tasty and made with similar ingredients: Kik Alicha Wot (chickpeas cooked in turmeric, onion, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os); Gomen (fresh collard greens saut\u00e9ed with onion, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os); Alicha Tiki Gomen (fresh cabbage, potatoes, and carrots cooked with a turmeric sauce of onion, garlic, and ginger); and Key Sir Wot (fresh beets and potatoes cooked with onion, tomatoes, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os).\n\nThe surprise fifth addition was Misir Wot, which is a spicy split lentil sauce made with berbere, onions, garlic, and ginger. There were hearty sooonfuls of Eggplant Wot and Buticha which is the Ethiopian version of hummus. A small salad called Azifa completes the dish. As you probably know, you're supposed to eat all of it with your hands by tearing pieces of the injera and scooping it up, something that requires more dexterity than I possess. They leave a basket of rolled injera which I noticed they freely replenished at other tables (photo: http://bit.ly/2GpKiIB). Since Jamie W. and I were watching our carb intake, we cheated and used our forks simply because injera easily becomes an unbridled addiction if we aren't careful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-30", "description": "Have you ever seen a coworker bring in some incredibly delicious food and you're like, \"Hot damn, can I have some of that??\"\n\nWell ever since our company moved to China Basin, I've frequently spotted colleagues of mine order takeout from Tadu Ethiopian Kitchen. Although I've personally never had Ethiopian food before, I can't help but salivate when I see stuff from this restaurant. \n\nAnd so when my friend and I were looking for a quick lunch spot to catch up at, I immediately suggested we check out Tadu Ethiopian Kitchen.\n\nAccording to their website (http://taduethiopiankitchen.com/menu-house/), Ethiopian food apparently encompasses a blend of veggies and meat - all surrounded by flavorful spices, sauces, and bread. One look at their menu and even I, a noob at this sort of cuisine, could tell that this was definitely the case here. At Tadu, pretty much every item - be it side, plate, or salad - included a large variety of scrumptious-sounding ingredients. The dishes that caught my eye the most were the Tibs Plates, which were essentially a mix of protein, a veggie side, and some bread. \n\nIn terms of pricing, this place is a bit costly for lunch. Sides themselves are a shade under $10, whereas entrees go from ~$10-$16. I guess for San Francisco standards it's not bad, but don't expect to pay under $10 here.\n\nI ended up getting the Beef Tibs with Kik Alicha Wot  (chickpeas). Here's what I thought of my experience:\n\n-- DAMN GOOD FOOD!!! --\nSo thankful that I popped my Ethiopian food cherry here because the Beef Tibs was 10/10 amazing! \nFirst off, I thought the cubes of beef tasted great. Each piece was quite flavorful and juicy as well. Secondly, the sauce was perfect - probably all thanks to that berbere spice. Furthermore, I'm glad I ordered the chickpeas because it offered a nice, soft texture to juxtapose with the chewiness of the beef. And if it couldn't get any better, this dish also came with a sprinkle of fresh lettuce, some tomatoes, onions, and jalape\u00f1os.  \n\nPerhaps one of the best parts, though, was the injera bread. Omg this Ethiopian-style flatbread threw me off guard. It was sponge-like, extremely soft, and tasted like heaven!\n\n-- QUIET, SPACIOUS SETTING --\nDespite the fact that we came in around lunchtime, Tadu was quite empty. We were able to settle in to some nice seats right away. The restaurant was fairly big, it looked very clean, and all I could here was ... silence! Not a bad place to have a meeting or a catch-up. \n\n-- PRETTY DECENT SERVICE --\nOverall, the employees here were hella nice and considerate. For instance, they brought out glasses of water without us even having to ask! And, they were extremely efficient as well! This is definitely a great spot if you want a fast and decent lunch.\n\nBeyond the food, ambiance, and service, one additional perk about Tadu was the location. This restaurant is only a few blocks down from both the MUNI and the Caltrain, so getting here should be a cinch! Plus, it's also like right next to AT&T Park, which is AMAZING because sometimes you might want something more than just stadium food. And since the cuisine options at Mission Bay are really lacking to say the least, this might be your best option for delicious food. \n\nAll in all, for those of y'all who are craving Ethiopian food in the city or perhaps you just want to try it for the first time, Tadu Ethiopian Kitchen is the bee's knees. But who knows, I have no idea what constitutes amazing Ethiopian dining. However, what I do know for sure is that this place ain't bad! I give Tadu a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. Yidesetu!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I headed into their newest location to see for myself what my friends had been raving about.\n\nI love the space that Tadu is in-- large windows, lots of natural light, bright colors and Ethiopian decor.  And unlike many other Ethiopian restaurants, the food came out really quickly which is a huge plus. We wanted to taste as much as possible so we ordered 4 different dishes--Kitfo (a seasoned raw beef traditional dish), Lamb tibs (cubed lamb saut\u00e9ed with onions and spices), Beef firfir (beef meat in a spicy tomato based sauce mixed with pieces of injera), and a veggie combo which included multiple veggie dishes including lentils, greens, and cabbage. All the food was seasoned and cooked to perfection and it really fulfilled my cravings. I walked away completely satisfied and happy. \n\nAdded bonus, the owners (a wife + hubby duo) are a total pleasure and the service was great! I'll be coming back for sure!", "author": "Ruhama G."}

I believe this is the second location for Tadu; the original location is very highly rated with 4.5 stars and over 450+ reviews. \n\nWe came here on Sunday for a late lunch. Parking was incredibly easy. We found a spot located right in front. The restaurant wasn't what I was expecting. It's like a quick counter service type of spot with elevated SF prices. \n\nWe placed our order at the counter for a combination meat platter and a combo veggie platter served family style (about $16 each). The menu also had Injera wraps and salads, so I think it's more aimed as a quick lunch spot rather than a traditional sit down restaurant. It's a very casual place.\n\nThe food was served fairly quickly; we were the only ones there since it was like 3:30 pm. The portions seemed on the small size, but we did ask for more injera, which was given complimentarily (we didn't know before we ordered, but other reviewers here also mention that).  \n\nThe dishes themselves were really nice and this really hit the spot! However, I think I prefer a more traditional Ethiopian restaurant with big family style platters and more ambiance. For the price, I'd expect bigger portions or a nicer ambiance and atmosphere.", "author": "Rebecca G."}

This is really bad for people who are vegetarian. If you are vegetarian, you should ask the employees to put your food onto a separate plate. \n\nThe Alicha Tikil Gomen tasted good. It kind of reminded me of a very mild Thai yellow curry. I liked how the carrots, potatoes, and cabbage pieces were very soft. \n\nThe sauces on the lettuce were strange to me. One sauce had the texture of tuna from a can and the other reminded me of hummus. They were both sour. \n\nOur dishes came with tons of injera (on the side and at the bottom of the curry)! I thought the injera was going to be sweet since it reminded me of the rolls that have creme on the inside. Instead, the injera tasted sour and reminded me of sourdough bread. The texture was soft and it was cold. The injera contrasted with the Alicha Tikil Gomen and sometimes overpowered this dish. At one point, I got sick of eating the injera because there was just too much!\n\nMy friend did not like the Lamb Alicha Banatu because there was not enough meat. 25% of that dish consisted of injera. \n\nI will probably try other places before coming back. This place was a bit pricey.", "author": "Kristina M."}

The pepper pieces were a bit large in comparison, but had nice smoky grill marks\n\nMisir Wot: I love berbere!  It just doesn't feel like a trip an Ethiopian restaurant without a berbere heavy dish.  These lentils were just that.  My technique was to get a good smear of the misir wot on my injera and then scoop up a large lamb chunk and some onions.

However, when it comes to dinner spots, it depends what your looking for.  If your looking for the best Ethiopian food Id say here but if your looking for a romantic date then maybe start with Sheba.  While Tadu is super Tasty it's modest Mission Bay sparkle packs tables along a window display that allow passerbyers to glean over your food while you eat.  Some people are bothered by this. Doesn't bother me though, I keep stuffing my face with fluffy injera and spicy berber.  Which leads me to believe they are not gleaning over my food as much as disgusted by my misdemeanor of etiquette.  Well, the satisfaction on my besmeared face should be convincing enough that the food is worth disregarding delicacies \n\nOh yeah, and they have TOFU TIBS!! NO other Ethiopian place does this!

Their beef with mushrooms tibs dish was disappointing; the meat tough and flavorless and nothing really coming together as a main entree.  The veggie combo had a couple of decent dishes (out of five) but the portions were so small that they were forgettable. Wouldn't return here so the recommendation is pass.", "author": "Saminda W."}

I'm a regular here and have on many occasions ordered the kitfo wrap (medium rare) and the lamb tibs - both are extremely flavourful. Portions are quite large so be prepared to share or come hungry. Also highly recommend trying the Telba if you're looking for a beverage with your meal - it's made with only water, flaxseed and honey yet has a creamy almost milk smoothie texture. Extremely tasty, and very healthy as well. Love this place!", "author": "M K."}

I got the chicken tibs ($13), which comes with your choice of veggie side. The tibs are a safe first timer choice, but are more or less the Ethiopian equivalent to fajitas. \n\nOverall, doesn't quite compare to the Ethiopian food in LA, but I'd try again with a more adventurous dish.", "author": "C W."}

A welcome addition to the otherwise sterile yupster environment of Mission Bay. \n\nYes it's more expensive than a 'traditional' Ethiopian joint, but that's SF. The person to bitch at is our worthless supervisors and your neighbors who fight development, not a restauranteur trying to make a go. \n\nExpect to pay $15/pp for a filling portion of meat, salads and all the Injera you can eat.

We ordered at the front and took a number. Our food was brought to our table after fresh glasses of water were delivered. We ordered the lamb tib entree to share. This comes with injera and veggies, so for $18 it was a great deal. The injera was full of flavor and tasted like it was made fresh. It went perfectly with the lamb, hummus, and misir wot.

We paid for 3 main dishes and what we received was only comparable to 1. And when we tried to talk to the manager, we waited for 30 minutes before the waitress with the highest deplorable attitude tells us to give her our number since the manager is \"busy\" and she will call us. REALLY? Do you not know how to talk to PAYING customers. You omitted dishes from our order, then upon complaining you do nothing. We PAID for it and then we walked out since they didn't have an ounce of decency. It is my life's mission to let my entire neighborhood to know how terrible this business is. I have been here before once for lunch and they served proper portion then but I think the more you pay and tip the less food you get.", "author": "Prateek G."}

Now you can have Tadu without braving the human feces and crazies endemic to their original Tenderloin location.\n\nAs with the original location, as soon as I tasted the special kitfo, it was revelatory. I have no words to describe this flavor except that I have never had anything like it and is the same here as the one in the Tenderloin. It is like pure flavor - and I strongly recommend you get it rare. As soon as it arrives I begin to eat it, and I become more and more compulsive about it until it is gone.\n\nVery few things have this effect on me (dry rub BBQ ribs from The BBQ Shop in East Memphis is one of the others), but it is like a drug in its effect.\n\nSuffice it to say: try Tadu. They only need a few more addicts like me to keep them in business indefinitely.", "author": "Marco C."}

It's a bit pricey for an Ethiopian restaurant (especially for counter service), but to be expected for the area and rent. Meals can be served in the traditional family style or individually. We got a veggie combo and a meat combo. Portion size was ample. Injera was very good (light, spongy, not overly sour), and they have a teff-only/gluten-free option for +$3. The wots in the veggie combo were all yummy and standard. I've had tastier, fresher-tasting gomens though. Wish they had a more traditional salad (with the tomato and dressed lettuce) in the combos instead of just a few pieces of lettuce tucked between dishes. I liked the minchet abish wot (ground beef with berbere); tasted like the Eritrean zigni dish my aunt always makes. Spiced tea was a little different than I'm used to but nice with the meal -- although they did bring it out way after everything else was served.
