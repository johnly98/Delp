Some of the better pizza I have is in SF. They were small personal 5/6 mini slice pizzas \n\nWe ordered two pasta dishes. They were very creamy and tasteful. A lot of cheese topped on top. \n\nWe had for started bruschetta, burrata, and carpaccio. They were all great.\n\nWe also had row bottles of wine that was good. \n\nFor food it was overall very good for what we ordered.

The wine however was on the expensive side at $62 a bottle (we got two). I'd say that's something you can skip.\n\nOverall:\nA great place with great food.

I wasn't quite dissatisfied enough to give a 4, but 5 feels like a special thing reserved for my top restaurants. I would return here for good Italian food, but I wouldn't put it on my list of top San Francisco spots.\n\nEating here feels like a genuine Italian experience. Our waiter had an Italian accent and attended to us much like you would see in Europe. He kept his distance and gave us lots of time. We didn't mind it, but if you were in a hurry I could see it being troubling.\n\nThey bring out some complimentary bread to start the meal. I think it was basically pizza dough cooked as a roll. It was honestly a little boring on its own, but was good when we asked for oil and vinegar to dip it in.\n\nWe tried the bruschetta and burrata appetizers. The bruschetta was good, but nothing to write home about -- quite basic. The burrata was very delicious.\n\nI ordered the eggplant Parmesan and absolutely loved it. It was delicious. The one thing that was a little deceiving is that on the menu it is under \"pasta\" and it mentions everything being with a tagliatelle pasta. Well, the eggplant just comes alone as an eggplant stack in a baking dish with no pasta on the side. That was a little disappointing, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nThe other members of my party loved their food. Particularly notable was their \"spicy\" pasta that the waiter recommended. Everyone was very impressed with it. The fresh made noodles were stellar.\n\nWe also tried the pine nut and custard tart dessert (I would write the name if I even knew it -- it's Italian). It was mediocre. The custard was a little too sweet for my taste. I would've preferred a more subtle sweetness in a dessert focused around pine nuts.\n\nIn summary, eat here, but don't be in a hurry, and make sure you get oil and vinegar with your bread.

We had the Margherita Bufalina, Salame with tartufo (truffles) and another with arugula. Fantastic! I still have no idea how they manage to get their crust so thin and yet crispy enough to be able to hold (most of it at least) in one hand without flopping over. I bought an Italian outdoor pizza oven to experiment and try to mimic their version, but am failing miserably at it! Another reason to come here!\n\nHomemade pasta is well done and perfectly chewy--the tagliatelle with meat sauce was perfectly executed and reminds me of our visit to Firenze (Florence). On this trip we opted for dessert--cannolis were perfectly sized and not too large like is often seen, the chocolate tartufo ice cream mimicked a truffle beautifully, and my affogato tasted superb ( though the gelato was a bit too melted when served--cooled espresso works better for this dish--but no big deal).\n\nTips: come early or make reservations as they were turning folks away after 7p.

The server did not check up throughout the meal or pay much attention to us, which made it difficult to end and pay the bill. I suppose it's part of the mom and pop store vibe. \n\nPasta was solid - fresh made and cooked to the perfect level. We ordered the lasagna, gnudi, and lobster ravioli.

I'm excited already.\n\nI opted for the Tagliatelle ai Funghi Porcini (Porcini mushroom with their fresh homemade pasta).  I like spicy and requested an extra spicy twist to the dish-- they were happy to accommodate; and guess what, the dish came out extra spicy just the way i like it!  \n\nWhen the dish arrived, it looked simple and bland in color -- but certainly not in taste or culinary skill!  One taste and I was like Whoa!.. they truly know their pasta.  Their motto is \"we try to make you feel like you're in Italy\" and this dish certainly came through.\n\nThe pasta is a fresh, perfectly textured and cooked deliciousness... the pasta sauce coated each piece of pasta lightly and did not drench or overtake the pasta's freshness and taste.  This is how a great Italian pasta dish should be!  The dish arrived hot and remained hot throughout my meal.  It was so good... I resisted the urge to lick the plate clean.  They also served a basket of complimentary bread and that was also very good... I can see that their pizzas but be delish too - based on the yummy bread.  \n\nReservation is a must at this restaurant.  Service is attentive, efficient and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "I have a soft spot for family businesses that are run with two generations.  The owner told us how they started as a bakery and changed to an Italian restaurant less than 10 years ago.  They have done a great job building the business.\n\nThe evening started off with a tongue-and-cheek question about whether their pizza was better than Tony's.  One of the sons articulated the difference.  Their pizza is thinner and the crust is crisper.  He nailed the difference with their margarita pizza.  Similar to the other place they get their tomato base from Italy. \n\nThe prosciutto and melon had a nice presentation with great taste.  The melon was nicely ripe without being overripe.  The prosciutto was nice but hey, I am not a prosciutto expert.\n\nWe had a risotto with seafood including calamari, shrimp, mussels, clams and scallops.  The flavor touched our palettes.  \n\nFor dessert the cannoli, as recommended by other Yelpers, was a nice ending.   It had just the right amount sweetness that went well with our cappuccinos.  One of our neighbors saw the cannoli after they had paid and said they wished they had seen it.  My wife stated we saw it on Yelp.\n\nWe have had some great experiences in North Beach but this was near the top for fun.  I agree with the other Yelpers that this place feels like going to your grand mother's house.\n\nWe recommend you give them a try and suggest you make a reservation.", "author": "Allen S."}

Had a reservation and for a Friday night that happened to be St Patrick's Day- that was wise.    Located in the North Beach Area, it's tucked away in a side street which gives it much more of a neighborhood feel.  I will admit I have had sketchy  luck at some of the more touristy places on North Beach.    Not the case here.  My god it was so good.     My table ordered the pasta Bolognese, the Caprese Pizza, the rustica  pizza, and the Baonicci salad.   We also tried the family chianti- the heartwarming story is told inside the menu. \n\nFirst, the pasta was rich, flavorful and simply delightful throughout.   Almost other worldly on its flavor from the meat sauce - even without needing volume .....  wherever the sauce had been, the flavor remained.    The pizzas had the most beautiful thin crust that was near cracker thin and the top, with the appropriate chew in the pizza body.   The salad was equally nice. \n\nThe chianti, exactly what you hope for based on the description .... it was rich, approachable, the right acidity and balance to make it a family table wine.  I resisted ordering another glass, but will search out a bottle. \n\nThe setting- it's the storybook family restaurant.   Really a nice place, managed by sincere people.", "author": "Darin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-05-16", "description": "Food:\n\nI thought overall the food was not good. I ordered the classic calzoni and was really disappointed. Overall the size portion wasn't that bad, but the sauce that came with the calzone was mediocre at best with no taste or flavor. \n\nA few others ordered some pastas among other things. The bolognese looks to have been the better choice between the other three pastas ordered Pomodoro, Peperoncino. Portion sizes were a bit lighter, but the taste in the bolognese seemed to win amongst our group of 5.\n\nPrice: \n\nPersonally my take away was that the price was outrageous. $21 for a calzoni is way to high considering it wasn't very good. Others in our group decided to go with some apps as well which were incredibly mediocre and over priced (eggplant parm and Toscano each over $20 with again a small portion size). Their beers are reasonably priced, however upon looking at the Italian beers (Yes, I know they are known for wine not beer) I decided on a $6 Anchor instead.\n\nService:\n\nHard to believe after what was mentioned above, that it could possibly get any worse, but it did. The server didn't hand us a menu and came to check on us 30 minutes after we had arrived. All of us starving by that point, didn't let him run away so we orders beers, water, apps right away. Then we waited almost another 25 minutes before we ordered our entrees. I guess eye contact doesn't go a long way towards saying, \"Help me! I am hungry.\" Then the finale of getting the check was absolutely terrible. A bus boy cleared our table and we still waited close to 45 more minutes to get our check. The entire ordeal took about 2 1/2 hours! No wonder these guys are packed all the time.\n\nOverall:\n\nI won't go back, not a chance. I'd recommend a lot of other potential better priced places around North Beach area. This was a terrible experience and dragged on like it wanted me to suffer.", "author": "Jon G."}

He said it was the best thin crust pizza he has ever eaten (including the many pizzas he's eaten during his regular work travels to Italy). \n\nThis is a Mom and Pop restaurant that cares about the quality of their food and provides excellent homey service.

I researched on Yelp for a tasty Italian meal and this place seemed like the spot! I was able to get reservations and salivated at the pics in anticipation. When we got there we were immediately seated and given water, about 20 min later the waiter came around... at that point we had all had plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat. we started with a bottle of wine and a meat and cheese plate. The wine was reasonably priced but not my cup of tea ( no fault of anyone just didn't enjoy it). The meat plate looked so delicious but the ends of every meat were very dry like they were improperly stored. Dish was okay at best. Now the real bummer came from our main dishes, my friend and I decided to share our dishes with one another, he ordered the margarita pizza and I the fungi tortellini, can't go wrong right? Wrong! The pizza tasted like straight gasoline! I noticed my friends face when he took a bite, and he usually gets very excited and vocal about his food but this time his eyes got really big and just stared at me... i immediately grabbed a bite and was taken back by the strong aroma and taste of gasoline! What the heck! Others tried it at our table and were nice enough to share their pasta with us but... we couldn't even stand that! They ordered the angriest pasta they had on the menu and honestly it was unbearable to eat. Way way way too many chili flakes ( I'm Latina and grew up eating very spicy food). My fungi raviolis were the saving grace however, I only had 5 on my plate! I really wanted to love this place and was so excited to try it but left feeling totally underwhelmed and honestly disappointed :( maybe it was an off night, and I will totally give them that much but I would never go back. Service was below average as well and took the waiter a very long time to acknowledge us and he was just kinda \"blah\" about everything...I feel like we could have a pretty great meal for $200 and kinda feel cheated but I guess you can't please them all!", "author": "Sonja D."}

Pizzas (12 inch) and other entrees average $20 each. Beer and wine are served and there are two outside sidewalk tables. It's in the heart of the city's beloved North Beach Italian-American district.\n\nFinally calling up my dog-eared bookmark after two years, we had a chance to try out BaoNecci's renowned pizzas. While it's a charming restaurant with excellent service, we found the food to be...well, bland, and a bit overpriced.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and helpful, letting us know what items are crowd favorites, as well as what wines to try.  The service was consistent throughout our meal, letting us focus on our food and surroundings.\n\nStarting with a $14 tomato and burrata salad, I felt myself jonesin' for summer California heirloom tomatoes. Yes, the dish was authentically Italian - but I just wanted more pronounced tomato flavor to balance the creaminess of the burrata.\n\nSimilarly, the recommended $19 Diavala (Spicy san marzano tomato, garlic, Italian parsley), had a nice crust but lacked an intensity of flavor. It arrived warm, not hot, which probably didn't help. Maybe we should have asked for pepper flakes! Not wanting to offend, we figured it wasn't part of the flavor experience. \n\nThe $18 pasta al pesto, housemade noodles and sauce, was good, but nothing we couldn't have whipped up at home. And, pricey at $18 solo.\n\nSo many others rave about this restaurant and I hate to be the one saying it's \"A-OK but not great.\" But that's what y'all pay me for, right?\n\nAt a Glance:\nFoodDrinks: 3 - Mild flavors...too delicate for me!\nService: 4 - Italian accent, of course!\nSetting: 4 - Walk to all of North Beach in minutes, corner location.\nValue: 3 - Appy, entree, dessert & glass wine =$50pp - I'd like a bit more for the money! \nDate worthy: 3 - It's cozy and romantic; afterwards you can walk to Coit Tower.\nDogs: Leave 'em home!!", "author": "John H."}

Bravo!\n\nIf you are one that likes big hearty pizzas with lots of toppings with it, this is not the place for you.  The thin crust and toppings are light I could actually finish two whole pizzas since it is not very filling. Ordered the Specialty pizzas. I don't think your life has started if you haven't tried this pizza:\n\nMonte Bianco ~$19.95\nLight San Marsano Tomato sauce, topped with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto parma and get this while the pizza is still hot it is topped with a scoop of mascarpone cheese it is spread around so that every inch of the pizza had this sweet creamy cheese taste. Each bite was heavenly.  I would love to take this home but I don't think it will taste the same.\n\nTruffle Salame ~ $18.95\nSan Marsano tomato sauce applied meagerly, topped with fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil and arrugula the sweet and salty combination of the toppings was a treat to the taste buds. Had to order two of these because it was so good.\n\nTomato sauce wasn't to thick or overwhelming. The ingredients for the toppings  were very simple and high quality and sparingly applied. The dough was just the canvass for the toppings. \n\nThe reason for it being 4 stars was that for light and thin pizzas they were a bit to expensive and believe me your going to want to order more!

Nothing stood out. We ordered the truffle pizza and lasagna. I couldn't taste the truffle oil very much, and the pizza felt like a snack rather than a meal. I guess thin is in. Very thin crust, thin slices of salami, and thin red sauce with minimal cheese. Lasagna was bland and needed salt, and there was a bunch of oil around the dish which came from either the meat or cheese. We just weren't fans of the place, and thought maybe the seafood place next door might've been a better option. Definitely Hub was still hungry afterwards.", "author": "J S."}

Nice! Also, two of us (myself and a sea-gan) were vegetarians of one sort or another, and this place had plenty of things we could eat :)\n\nI got the pizza with mushrooms, Mr. Piano got the pizza alla contadina (gorgonzola and pears), and our friends got a cheese-less pizza and one of the pizzas with the various meats on them (can't remember exactly which one). The mushroom pizza was delicious, as was the gorgonzola and pear pizza! I had asked, and while their pastas have eggs in it, their pizza dough does not (I have an egg allergy, plus we had our sea-gan friend), so that was great. The waitstaff was friendly and good about refilling our water glasses, as it was a warm day, so that was also fantastic.\n\nWhile I don't expect to be in the neighborhood all that often, when I am, I will definitely be thinking about this place and their delicious pizzas :) Awesome!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

They have spectacular pizzas and wine. I'll even go as far as saying, they serve one of the best thin crust pizzas if not the best in SF. With over 20+ choices, BaoNecci beats my favorites: Tony's, Capo's, Delfina and Beretta. And, although the wine list is small, it's a quality selection. Get the chianti ($10/glass)!\n\nDon't think about walking in here without reservations (listed under Opentable as \"Baonecci Trattoria & Pizzeria\") especially on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night (they're closed on Sunday). BaoNecci seats about 35 people with 12 tables inside and 3 outside. We had reservations at 6 pm and midway through dinner, the dining room was packed and there was a wait. The ambiance is a bit kitschy but it adds to that authentic Italian feel http://bit.ly/14htGwt. \n\nThere were so many choices so after perusing the menu for some time, we decided to start with the Burrata Salad ($12.95): http://bit.ly/14cbhkg. I would skip this next time as the burrata lacked that quintessential silky, buttery texture and was too watery in the center. I wished heirloom tomatoes were used since they're more robust in flavor and would have given this salad more oomph. \n\nI opted for the Contadina w/ Mozzarella, Parmigiano, Gorgonzola & Pears Pizza ($16.95): http://bit.ly/13iDBlR. I added proscuitto for an additional $4. Almost too pretty to eat, the blistery, crackly crust was deliciously crunchy . I normally hate pizza crusts but these were addictingly good. If you're a sweet and savory flavor whore, you will LOVE this pizza. The melange of salty proscuitto, rich and pungent cheeses along with the crisp, sweet ribbons of pear were ridiculously good. I inhaled the entire pizza but didn't feel grossly bloated afterwards because it was light.\n\nMy friend ordered the Salamino E Salsiccia Pizza w/ Fresh Tomato, Mozzarella, Sausage & Pepperoni ($15.95): http://bit.ly/YgLoyJ. A solid choice if you like something meaty and rich. This would make the ultimate drunk food after happy hour nearby as it will soak up all the copious amounts of booze you've downed.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but I have my eye on that Nutella Dessert Pizza the next time I come. \n\nService was equally as fantastic as the food. The food was a solid 4.5 stars but the service boosts my rating to 5. The entire Italian accented staff was warm, charming, and attentive. I was waiting for my friend to arrive and one of the waiters passed by several times to check on me. He probably felt bad thinking I got stood up on date.\n\nDon't be a lush like me and drink on a empty stomach. Just half a glass of the chianti made me tipsy while waiting for my friend.

It's of a decent size, in a hilly location in Little Italy. The food there has a rich, tomato sauce, most of it anyways, and the bread is the heavenly type of good! They have an odd addition of pizzas, for most are with prosciutto, not that I'm complaining. It's great, as is the pasta, but if you've been to a magnificent Italian restaurant, this is really comparable. The portions are all for just a single person, definitely not any more. \n\nMy experience there wasn't exactly splendid, but my opinion was that the restaurant and the food were above average. My cousin was visiting from Europe, along with her daughter, who complained enormously about the food, for silly reasons. Gross prosciutto, too much sauce, or too little sauce, but no.

This I had to see firsthand because I have become very intrigued with the concept of extremely paper thin crust pizzas ever since I had the thin crust pizza at Palomino.\n\nCame by for lunch and I was their first customer of the day.  So for me, service was pretty much on point.  They have a wide selection of pizzas, from the classics like Margherita and Quattro Stagioni, along with their specialty pizzas such as the Monte Blanco and the Porca.  But for this occaision, I decided to splurge and go for the Truffle Salame.\n\nTruffle Salame Pizza (http://bit.ly/1137v93) - San Marzano Tomato, Fresh Mozzarella, Truffle Salame, Truffle Oil, Arugala.\n\nHEAVEN!!!  So much flavor going on with the Truffle Oil and Truffle Salami.  The Arugala helped balance out the flavor.  And despite its thinness, the crust was very good as well.  In the great words of George Takei (even though it's meant for something else), OH MYYYY!  Best pizza I've ever eaten!  And that's saying a lot because I've had my share of good pies and bad pies.  Or maybe I'm just a sucker for really thin crust pizza.  Just look at how thin this slice is (http://bit.ly/TrwG2r).  When it comes to really thin crust pizzas, Baonecci takes the prize!\n\nEven though this was my only visit, I'm already sold on coming here more often to try their other pizzas and menu items.  Granted, I wouldn't recommend the place if you're expecting to load up on some fat slices of pizza.  You can go to Seniore's,  Nizario's, or even nearby Golden Boy Pizza for that.

The place is really cute and intimate and I found the man that seated us (bus boy) to be very friendly. However after that, the one waiter looked us and almost scoffed at us (both the only minorities in the restaurant, and I NEVER play this card), and just threw our menus on the table without a word.  He never returned....Thank goodness for the owner (I think) who finally came over to help us and was very friendly.  The 3 stars are for the waiter and the quality of the food, unfortunately.  We ordered the bruschetta to start, which was excellent, so we had high hopes for our pasta dishes.  We ordered the Tagliatelle All Arrabiatta, and the sauce was AMAZING, but the pasta  was overcooked and not al dente as I have grown to expect from high quality Italian restaurants.  We also ordered the Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese, which was seriously lacking in flavor and sauce.  It was basically just the meat without sauce or flavor, and again, the pasta was overcooked.

It's not the place to eat if you want dishes with meat in them. The dishes with meat are limited to a lasagna with meat sauce and a few pizzas and calzones with meat toppings. \n\nOur party got some dishes to share so that we could try different menu items. The lasagna and the eggplant parmesan were very good. The Quatro Formaggio pizza was not good at all. It was paper thin and did not have a very good flavor. It didn't even smell very good. On the plus side, they did take the pizza off of the bill. \n\nThe service was not good either. Once our order was taken and our food was dropped off, we didn't see our server for a very long time.  We were hungry from walking around the city, but didn't get any bread until our meals came. The bread was delish! \n\nThe food came out in a reasonable amount of time, however our water glasses were empty for the majority of the meal and no one ever came to see if we liked our food or if we needed anything, like WATER!

Wife's lasagna was excellent. The meat sauce is flavorful and well balanced. It's worth noting that the lasagna is different from the others that it uses only Parmesan cheese and bechamel sauce. \n\nMy pizza was great!! It has just the right amount of cheese (mozzarella)  and san marino tomato sauce (that expensive good stuff). Toppings include mushroom and wild boar salami. The pizza crust is probably the best part. It's lightly charred, paper thin, and crispy...almost like a cracker. So, every bite was crispy, full of various flavors from the ingredients and char.

As simple as it sounds, this thin crust pizza is baked to a perfect crispiness, and the ingredients are just top notch. The mozzarella provides the body and texture, but it's not overwhelming, instead painfully fresh & perfectly mild, for with BaoNecci pizzas, the cheese is just a vehicle to deliver the other goodies. That prosciutto melts in your mouth with a godly level of saltiness, and that mascarpone, oh glorious mascarpone--you are as sweet, thick, & creamy as a cherub! I hereby would like to request that I be buried in a coffin filled with sweetened mascarpone (catered by BaoNecci of course).\n\n***TRUFFLE SALAME - San marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella, truffle salame, truffle oil, arugola\n\nKeep your voice down, reciting this holy script of ingredients is a religious exercise. The truffle salame is dreamily rich, the arugola provides those crucial bitter accents and leafiness, and that truffle oil, the fragrance emanating therefrom fills the entire kitchen. I could IV this liquid gold into my veins and survive on its sustenance alone! These two pizzas are BaoNecci's secret weapons--one bite and you'll be forever prostituting yourself out for another.\n\n***CANNOLI\n\nI was extremely disappointed that the Affogato Chocolate Tartufo was sold out. This is BaoNecci's signature dessert, described as chocolate in the shape of a truffle (the fungi variety) and filled with custard. So we went with the cannoli. The plating was absolutely gorgeous with a preserved cherry as garnish. The cannoli itself was solid, but was just missing something--the filling had that perfect consistency, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, and the pastry shell lacked that \"Step aside, I was just deep-fried!\" punch in the face. It was solid though. Next time that Tartufo is mine!\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nThe gods fated that I would happen upon BaoNecci--it was predestined. How else could you explain it?\n\nBy the way, the Gambaccini sons (Elia & Filippo), who happen to be waiters here, have perfectly chiseled noses and chins.

We were seated inside, we had a very nice server and the food was amazing. To drink, we ordered a bottle of Italian white white wine (by the way, the place is famous for their extensive wine list). Make sure you ask to get the best recommendation.\n\nAs a starter, we had the Antipesto de Breasola. As a main we had the Ortolana pizza, which we decided to share. The pizza was delicious, and more than enough for two people. \n\nOnce we were done, no one rushed us to leave. The staff took their time clearing the table and bringing the check, which I really appreciated.

We were lucky to find BaoNecci and were seated immediately. \n\nI ordered the Truffle Salame and was pleasantly surprised. My friends ordered Salamino E Salsiccia and Salsiccia e Taleggio pizzas but we all shared and agreed the Truffle Salame was the winner of the night.  The truffle flavor really made the pizza stand out from the other 2 we had.  My friends didn't like that the pizzas were so thin, although this is an Italian style, but I thought the thickness was fine, it just didn't look as appealing as other thin crust Italian style pizza I've had before. We each also ordered wine and beer.  The total for each of us was around $30 each which is a little steeper than we would've liked considering the pizzas were truly personal sized and weren't on par to what we were expecting.  I prefer Delfina in the Mission District, they have a better quality pizza (among other dishes).  \n\nService was also a little spotty, we waited at least 20 minutes to get the attention of a waiter to order.  When we turned around we saw that a party that was seated after us had already ordered and gotten a bread basket, which we never got.  When we wanted more water, again it was a challenge to get a waiter's attention. However, when we wanted to get our check there was no problem there, they got our check to us immediately.\n\nSo, yes, I would recommend the Truffle Salame and give BaoNecci a try maybe try other items on their menu too.  I would give 4 stars to the pizza alone, but the unfortunate service and unpleasant experience of my friends inclines me to deduct a star.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Also with others saying they were blown away.. they seriously must have never eaten at an actually awesome Italian restaurant.\n\nThings started off with the awkward question \"Do you have a reservation?\" and look as if we might not be seated.. when there are plenty of open tables.  The guy walked away from us (group of 3) without indication if we'd be seated.  It was ~8:30 on a Wednesday night.  He put us at a table next to their [tiny] bar.  My buddy asked us if we should leave.. but we were starving so we decided to roll the dice.\n\nThe burratta app ($14) was uninspired... no seasoning/fresh pepper/oil/balsamic.. nothing to elevate this dish besides the tiny bit of arugula.  The bruschetta ($11) was also underwhelming.  Decent flavor/bread, but again.. nothing that justified the price in my mind.  It was not a 4.5 star start by any means. I would have rather taken that $25 and bought a pizza somewhere else to feed us all.. and have $75 to get a bunch of good beers?  anyway.. too late, we're already there.\n\nI ordered pesto pasta.  For the price it was solidly nothing special.  I make better pesto at home.  It was bland.. I had to load it with crushed red peppers for it to taste like something.  Their homemade egg noodles didn't seem to go well with the dish in my opinion.  My friend ordered lasagna which he said was \"not tasty\". My other friend said the calzone was OK - but he left most of it uneaten (this dish, unlike mine, was big).  We asked for bread with our dinner and it was never delivered.  I was looking forward to the bread since my pesto dish was pretty small, but didn't want to flag them down again and had finished our food before they came by our table.  \n\nAnyway, the place in general was just nothing special.  The single bathroom was small and I had to wait for it to free up - no paper towels which is always a deduction to me (i hate those dyson air blades.. I always end up touching it).  The dining area is pretty loud and crowded - the server was standing in our way when we were trying to leave through the tight passageway of chairs.  Basically it was a dining experience where I felt like I would have rather grabbed a few random groceries and not gone out.", "author": "King B."}

She loves thin-crust pizza.  I didn't taste it, but it looked good.  My Lasagna was good, but it was one of those \"white\" type of lasagnas that didn't have a lot of tomato sauce flavoring.  It was good, but it is not my type.  It is worth considering if that is the style of Italian that they prepare there in their other dishes and it is what you like.\n\nWe went on a very slow night.  We were one of two tables occupied at dinner.  I found the waiter to be very nice, but overall the service was a bit \"blah\".  We didn't get bread until the food arrived and if I recall, we asked for it.  The waiter and two others pretty much just stood around not doing much.

While it is off the main drag and has an unassuming storefront, don't let appearances deceive you. Instead, follow your nose; the lovely aromas of fresh garlic, salty mozzarella, and fruity wines draw you in like an open hand extended. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were greeted at the door promptly, and were seated shortly thereafter, which was much appreciated as it was late Friday night and we were starving! The interior was oddly decorated with large photographs and graphic prints, but the overall impression was pleasing. There was a certain authenticity to the atmosphere, with its low lighting and feeling of fullness thanks to lively conversation and laughter filling the air. My boyfriend said it reminded him of the trattorias that he often visited while living in Rome. There was a small tea light lit on each table, lending a flickering glow. It felt quite intimate.\n\nThe server was warm and charming, and we felt at ease as we took some time considering our options. We selected a glass of Sangiovese (acidic and bright) and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, (soft and fruity), along with a quarto fromagi pizza. We decided to start small since we wanted to save room for the house-made desserts. \n\nSince moving to San Francisco, Benjamin and I have had trouble locating a place that serves thin crust pizza in the Roman style. Boanecci served us just that. The quarto fromagi was to die for! The crust was wood fired, with lovely bits of charring around the edges, and the cheese was melty and flavorful. There was a perfect swirl of rich olive oil as a base and a good amount of herbs to round out the dish. I even loved that there was a light dusting of corn meal on the crust, a testament to hand stretching and firing. My only suggestion to the cook is that they add more fresh basil to top the pizza. \n\nWe loved the pizza so much that we ordered a second, a traditional Margherita. I wasn't as pleased with this one. The mozzarella and basil were solid, but the tomato flavor of the sauce was less pronounced than I would have liked. However, we still ate it up, as the crust was so delicious. \n\nThroughout the meal, the servers and the restaurant manager checked in on us, making sure that we were taken care of without being intrusive. I felt like a family friend dining in their home. \n\nThe dessert of the day was tiramisu, so, even though we were quite full at this point, we couldn't resist. It was served in a glass dish, and had a more pudding-like quality to it, which is more traditional. The ladyfingers still had a spongy spring, and were drenched in a bittersweet and tart espresso that complimented the creamy, buttery mascarpone. A sprinkle of cocoa on top added a hint of dryness and created a beautiful mouth feel in combination with the other textures in the dish. \n\nI'm so happy to have found a great Italian restaurant in the city and can't wait to return to try other dishes.", "author": "Mars W."}

The wait at Tony's was 2 hours and the line for Golden Boy was out the door, so we decided to call BaoNecci's to see how long their wait was. They surprisingly said they had a table available for us and we noticed this was because they had a \"Reservations Only\" sign on their door that day, to keep out the drunks I'm assuming. I thought that was kind of funny. \n\nI'm not usually a thin crust pizza fan, but their Monte Bianco and Truffle Salame are amazing! I wasn't even sad about not being able to eat clam pizza anymore. We decided to do half and half with these two because they both sounded really good and we thought 2 whole pizzas would have been too much. The main toppings on the Monte Bianco were prosciutto and marscapone cheese and I thought the saltiness and slight sweetness complimented each other well. The Truffle Salame had salami and truffle topped with arugula. Truffle and arugula are two of my favorite things to eat ever so I thought this one was amazing too! The crust was a little too thin for me, but that's just my preference because I usually like doughy crusts. Oh and we also shared the Stefania salad (romaine lettuce, walnuts, apple slices, and Swiss cheese cubes), which was way better than I expected. The dressing was light and all the ingredients were really fresh.

Nevertheless, it was tasty but something was missing...the porcini mushrooms needed more seasoning to make them more assertive in the presence of the arugula and the shaved Parmesan.

But I watched, 1 by 1, as all the other tables around us were seated after us. & then I watched, 1 by 1, as each of those other tables got their food before us.\n\nSo, what about the food we waited so long for? We ordered Prosciutto Cotto e Finocchietto, Stefania's Salad & Pizza Margherita. In simpler terms, an appetizer, salad & basic, thin crust pizza. Certainly not the type of order that would take even 1/3 the time we waited.\n\nAll of it was actually very good & obviously made from high quality ingredients. The Prosciutto Cotto e Finocchietto had a buttery, almost melt-in-your-mouth Prosciutto & tantalizing thin slices of Fennel. Stefania's Salad was delightfully light with the right amount of sweet from the apple.\n\nWhen it comes to pizzas, the Margherita is the litmus test of a pizzeria's skill & execution. The Pizza Margherita here was 1 of the better examples of this pizza I've had, but not 1 of the best. For its size, at $15, I would also say it's a little overpriced.\n\nCaff\u00e9 BaoNecci does have an authentic & welcoming Italian feel + the food is well prepared using fresh ingredients.

We were in SF for a few days for our honeymoon,  and took a cab over to this address. Very unassuming from the outside,  we weren't sure we were in the right spot at first!  We didn't have a reservation but were seated quickly on a Thursday night. \n\nIts nice when a restaurant can make you feel like a guest of the family. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. I loved reading the family story on the back of the menu. I was especially excited to discover (after my husband made a trek through the kitchen on his way to the bathroom) that there was a \"little italian lady hand-making all the pizzas\" in the back\nWe ordered the brushetta. A-mazing. Perfectly ripe tomatoes and some delicious tasting creamy olive oil. We asked our waiter what the most popular pizza was, and he made a few recommendations. We settled on the truffle salami. Perfect amount of cheese, flavor in every bite. Not a super heavy pizza, but truly authentic tasting. After our wonderful meal, we decided on a piece of pistachio cheesecake dor dessert. Again, did not disappoint in any way. \n\nThe best part.....after raving to our waiter about how impressed we were, we discovered just how special this family business was. Our waiter informed the chef (Stefania, the family matriarch) that we were newly married and how much we enjoyed the dinner. She came out personally to thank and congratulate us!! You just don't get customer service like that!!!\n\nIf the gentleman that were sitting next to us happen to read this review.....thank you again!!

If you come here for one item, try this!\n\nBufalina: Simple and tasty! The fresh mozzarella and quality tomato sauce made all the difference. \n\nOrtolana: Good enough that the vegetarians in the group refused to share.\n\nMonte Bianco: something about baking prosciutto and putting it on a pizza that just works. Maybe the flavor of the meat with crust. It was a good match with the wine. \n\nYou're in safe hands with the wine list, just about anything will be good and all is affordable.

After seeing this place had 4.5 stars and reading the variety of entrees on the menu, my family and I decided to give this place a shot.\nWe arrived, drenched from the rain and we were asked by a gentlemen, \"do you have a reservation?\" We responded \"no\". He then walked off to see if he could \"squeeze us in\", and we were left to stand awkwardly in the doorway in the EMPTY restaurant. I work in a restaurant;  I understand the importance of reservations. However, I truly believe the interaction could have been handled better.\nWe were then seated and given glasses of water. I don't know if the servers were just coming on to their shift, because we got there shortly right after they opened, but no one came to our table for thr next 15-20  minutes to offer the specials or anything aside from water to drink...which we probably would have ordered because this was a treat for us. Our server finally came to our table and he seemed surprised that we were ready to order. My father ordered an antipasti cheese platter for us to share and we each ordered our own entrees. Pasta Bolognese. Lasagna. Pasta al Fogno.  Canaloni. I expected the cheese platter to come out at least in 10 minutes but it didn't. Which was disappointing because we are cheese fanatics and were really looking forward to enjoying them. Had our server not been so consumed by whatever he was looking at on his phone. It might have occured to him to ask us how we were liking the platter or better yet realizing we never got it. I get it, mistakes happen. You forget to ring in something, you get so consumed with all the tables you have worry about. But we were the only other table in there. So the only mistake was being on the phone and neglecting the customers. However, I did enjoy my food.\nOur food came out in a reasonable amount of time though. We didnt wait long. Everything had a nice presentation. Steam was rising from the dishes and the melted cheese was bubbling. My lasagna was delicious. It was well portioned. The egg noodle was tender and melted in my mouth. The ground beef was succulent and had the perfect blend of spices.

The front of the restaurant (the cafe side?) is more casual, but the back opens up into a very romantic, dimly lit room. It's kind of an amusing, surreal experience given that I was at dinner with my co-workers, not on a hot date. The music is kind of outdated, playing cheesy 80s romantic songs, probably from a Pure Moods CD. \nAnyway, onto the food--the pasta is all made w/ homemade egg noodles but they also have regular pasta. I ordered the pasta bolognese, which is my favorite pasta sauce. I thought overall the pasta was decent but nothing amazing. Noodles were a little too soft, not as al dente as I would've liked, but they did taste fresh and homemade. For once, I actually thought the portion was normal sized, even a bit small.. everyone in my group finished their plates. It didn't help that I was starving, though. My friend ordered a pizza and said it was just ok as well, and that it was a little too soggy. I tried a few bites of my other friend's eggplant parmesan, which I actually really enjoyed. It was very flavorful and cheesy and nicely balanced with a side salad. We all shared the nutella pizza which was decent. Sounded like an interesting design but it was pretty much just a flat crepe only w/ pizza dough instead of crepe material.\nService is very friendly, but super slow.

With my heart set on a pizza dinner in North Beach, I took a walk around the area and decided to try this place. We didn't have a reservation, but we got lucky with timing and snagged a table. We had a carafe of wine, the caprese salad, two pizzas, and gelato. The caprese salad was lovely - delicious mozzarella, simply but well-dressed with olive oil, salt, and pepper. The pizzas were crazy good. We had the one with sausage & pepperoni (the best!) and the one with olives/prosciutto/artichokes/mushrooms. The crust is super super thin, which is my favorite. \n\nA little pricey for a pizza dinner, but I'm so glad Tony's was closed so I could discover this place. Go.", "author": "Kristina C."}

Our group of 7 was seated in the back room and I wish they would have turned on just a little more light or lit all the candles.  Overall, food was mediocre. I ordered the pesto pasta which was just that, pesto and pasta, no veggies or any additions. I added prosciutto and tried to add spinach, but they didn't have any. When my pasta came out, they forgot to add the prosciutto and basically just brought me 3 slabs of prosciutto on a plate, which was unexpected and kind of unappetizing. The pesto pasta itself was ok, but the portion size was perfect for me, but may be small for others (I usually don't finish my food, but I finished my pasta this time). We ordered the Nutella pizza to share which was also just mediocre. Not sure what I was expecting, but it was pizza dough, which was overly powdery, with thinly spread Nutella, topped with kiwi, banana, and strawberry.

We decided to dine here after reading great reviews on yelp - we were really looking forward to eating here. \n\nWe are a large group of 12 and were thankfully seated right away. We were waiting on a few members of our party to arrive so we placed drink orders for those present to pass the time. They don't have appetizers so beer seemed like the next logical thing. =) Our drinks took a long time to get considering all they had to do was pop off the caps. Perhaps the prosecco my girlfriend ordered threw them off. Note: beer and wine is all they serve. \n\nWhen the rest of our party arrived, here's what a few of us of ordered:\n\n--Caprese salad - a basic caprese salad. There was nothing special about this. Flavor was great. \n\n--Margherita Pizza - Authentic? Well perhaps the crust but not the flavors. I love margherita pizzas but this one didn't do anything for me. The flavor was bland and that was with the addition of crushed red pepper. I've had pizzas throughout Italy and those have flavor. I'm sorry to say, this didn't. \n\n--Funghi Pizza - My friends ordered this and I was able to grab a slice of it. The flavors here were much better but the flavor still didn't blow me away. \n\nTwo members of our party also ordered the eggplant parmigiana and the meat lasagna. Both mentioned that the center was really cold. One sent it back to the kitchen and the other kept it in fear of someone spitting in their food. Bummer. \n\nWe all decided against dessert since we no one was overly enthusiastic with what they ordered.\n\nIn terms of service, I was a bit disappointed in that as well. We had to ask for everything; plates, silverware and our dishes were just brought to the table. We all had to swap plates to get the dishes that we ordered. It was just awkward and the staff wasn't warm, friendly or welcoming which was very surprising to me. \n\nI'm disappointed that I couldn't give this \"authentic\" pizza joint more stars considering so many others liked it.

Two of the waiters (which I believe were the sons in the family business), actually looked at us several times and didn't come over to greet us.  Now, like I said- this was similar to experiences we had while dining in Italy. So I'm just going to chalk it up to a difference in cultural dining norms. It definitely didn't ruin our night. Finally, the owner came over to seat us.We were a little early for our reservation, but they gave us a table anyway, which was very nice- as the place was already very crowded. \n\nI started with a cup of the **Zuppa Garfagnina**, which was a puree of cannelini beans and farro which olive oil on top. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly seasoned, nice consistency and served with a little bit of Italian bread for soaking up the last bite. I really enjoyed it. Hindsight is 20/20, I would have gotten the bowl and a salad instead of my main dish.\n\nFor my main dish I got the **Pesto Pasta**, the Rotini was perfectly cooked. A nice al dente. The pesto covered the pasta nicely, but wasn't served in puddles and pools, which is good for me because I don't like things over sauced. I just wasn't that impressed with the pesto itself. It tasted very fresh, and not store bought as other reviews indicate, but it was not very flavorful and fell flat. My husband on the other hand really enjoyed it and said he liked it better than the Pesto that I compare all pestos to at L'Angello de Museii In Rome. Not close for me, but I'm glad he enjoyed it as much as he did. It was by no means BAD, it just wasn't GREAT!\n\nMy husband got the Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza- **Salamino E Salsiccia** He really likes thin crust pizza, so he was impressed with the crust of the pie. It was thin, but he could still pick up a slice and everything didn't go falling off. He also noted that the cheese was very creamy and melted well, a higher quality mozzarella than was served in our regular pizza place. He's definitely not as descriptive as I am, so when I asked him how he felt about it overall, he said \"It was good.\" So good it was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the Owner came up to talk to us and asked me how I enjoyed making our reservation on Open Table. I guess they just started using it a few weeks ago. He was really nice, and seemed really interested in how we felt about the process. \n\nI think that their business will continue to thrive. They are really nice people, making quality food. I wish them well.\n\n**Another note, the bathroom is in a hallway behind the kitchen, so you need to walk through the kitchen to get there. I was so impressed with how impeccably clean the kitchen was. Everything was neat in prep containers, and there was not a crumb on the ground. I love a clean kitchen.

We had the bruschetta as an appetizer, and the servings were heaping, fresh, and very well seasoned. We ordered the Monte Bianco and the 4 Stagioni and were very pleased with each. The service was great, but expected to be so since the place only seats about 25 people. I certainly recommend going here if you're looking for great tasting pizza, but not if you're trying to fill up. It's a bit expensive, too: $19 a piece. I would be a regular if we lived here!", "author": "Lauren P."}

Their inventive thin crust pizzas (e.g. pears and gorgonzola), lasagnas (made by one talented chef/mom), and calzones are exemplary.  Maybe, best of all is the warmth of the Italian family that operates this restaurant: they exude love, enthusiasm, and grace -- and nothing makes good food even better.  They (mom, dad, and their two sons) left Lucca, Italy, about 5 years ago, to take over a bakery at this North Beach location and have evolved it into a much loved neighborhood restaurant. Take takes skill, talent, and chutzpah.  You will love this place.", "author": "joe r."}

It was inedible, but we had gotten takeout so it's not like we were going to drive all the way back to complain.  \n\nIt also took A LOT longer than the half hour they told me on the phone, so I was stuck standing around their tiny shop waiting for my order, getting hungrier and hungrier which made the eventual disappointment of the food so much worse.

Everything looks scrumptious whether it be their pastries, cookies, biscotti, pizzas or focaccia.  I've only sampled the focaccia so far, but I'm planning many return trips to sample other goodies.\n\nYesterday I tried a couple of slices of their focaccia.  The focaccia comes in six inch squares and the bakery will toast them warm for you if you'd like.  I particularly liked the combination variety with sliced mushrooms, black olives and green onion on a slightly tangy tomato sauce covered slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gtIud2JPu_tW3LMldEOUaw?select=2MiPPKyb_CVnSUrabNaM4g).  It was as good as any cheeseless pizza slice I've ever had.\n\nI liked the green onion focaccia (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gtIud2JPu_tW3LMldEOUaw?select=VjyR3wDHHydoIObplgJk3g) also except Danilo's version has a bit of pepper sprinkled on it, and I'm used to having that without the pepper like what is sold at my favorite Liguria Bakery.  Two things that I did like more than Liguria's on both of the slices was that neither were as oily, and both were still available in the middle of the afternoon.  The combo square was $2 and the onion square was $1.50.  There are tables and chairs both inside and outside.  I was in a hurry to return to work; otherwise, I might have stayed a bit to soak up some of that great North Beach atmosphere.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

After a lot of research, I finally decided on Bao Necci since it had great reviews.   \n\nWe enjoyed the overall atmosphere---there were several Italian families eating lunch and everyone who arrived (on foot---definitely a neighborhood haunt)  carried on exuberant conversations with the owners in Italian.  Unfortunately, the owners seemed more interested in the locals, who received much better counter service than we did.  For the most part, I felt ignored.\n\nWe sat at one of the tables out front---even though this place is on a side street, there were plenty of people strolling by, so it was fun to feel part of the scene.  \n\nI just had biscotti and coffee, but my husband had some pizza.  It wasn't as good as he thought it would be---he says it was very unexciting.  \n\nBao Necci is a decent place to stop for a coffee and a rest after a morning of sightseeing.

I really like her handmade long pastas, Tagliattelle, Pappardelle etc. made with eggs and from traditional Tuscan menus which accompany savory sauces like her Bolognese made like my Mamma did both with beef and pork. Also, I get very nostalgic with the Fagioli all'Uccelletto with cannellini beans, tomato sause, garlic, sage and sausage ( she adds this for me). I mention the pasta because Caffe Baonecci, and rightfully so, probably has the reputation as having the best pizza in the Bay Area but I wanted to tell you that the pasta is fantastic too.\n\nThe Master of the Kitchen is a native born Italian and I mention this because most Italian restaurants have Latins cooking and although trained by Italians, for me there is nothing like having a native born Italian cooking for you as she/he would for their families. They have also expanded so it is wonderful for a private party of 10-15 + and Stephania will cook dishes of your preference or she will recommend some and these are not on the menu. It's a perfect place for a Holiday party, birthday, anninversary etc. Try it, you'll like it, I promise you !!!\n\n\n\nNon posso dirvi il mio piatto preferito che Stefania fa perch\u00e9 ci sono cos\u00ec tante ed ella cuoce per voi che cosa ella si prepara per la sua famiglia Amo particolarmente le paste lunge, tagliatelle, pappardelle etc., le paste all'uovo nelle ricette di cucina italiana tradizionale toscana che si accompagna magificamente a piatti dal sapore forte come la salsa bolognese fatta come mia mamma usata per fare con carne di manzo e di maiale. Ma veramente eo divento nostalgico con suoi Fagioli all'Uccelletto con cannellini fagioli, salsa di pomodoro, aglio, salvia & salsiccia(lei aggiunge per me). La nostra famiglia era povera e questo era il nostro pasto intero con una pasta piccola come ditalli, conchiglie etc e pane e insalata.

I love what they offer in the menu; definitely not the regular Americanized pepperoni, sausage and bell peppers kind. Instead, you will find buffalo mozzarella, truffle oil, Italian tomatoes.

It was a nice warm night in San Francisco and we couldn't pass up the chance of eating outside without freezing to death. Our meal was perfect. Loverboy kept moaning with each bite (and no!!! I wasn't giving him naughty treats during dinner....he was moaning from Foodgasms!) I wanna keep this hidden gem to myself but I think this business deserves to be in the spotlight.\n\nDrink:\nI ordered their strawberry prosecco and that was so refreshing. It wasn't extremely sweet and it was really fizzy.  It's way better than their peach bellini that I wasn't a big fan of.\n\nFood:\nThe lasagna tastes really fresh.  You could tell that they made it to order and it is probably one of the best lasagnas I've ever consumed. The pasta layers were not too soggy and the sauce had the perfect balance of herbs and spices. It also had just the right amount of cheese which complemented the slightly sweet and tangy tomato sauce.\n\nThe truffle salame special pie is THE BEST PIZZA I've ever eaten in my ENTIRE life. I dare anyone to suggest to me that there's a better pizza out there (because I highly doubt it).  I'm sorry Tony's Pizza, but Caff\u00e9 BaoNecci beat your version of a truffle pizza hands down.  The flavor of the truffle is more intense and I really like how they added arugula as a topping.  Loverboy and I both agreed that the flavor of the pizza reminds us of a forest.  Fresh, woody and clean.  The pizza crust was flavored and cooked perfectly.   You can tell (without checking out the kitchen in the back) that their pizza dough is made to order. We loved the pizza so much that we ordered a second one to take home since we were running out of room in our bellies.  The server was so happy to hear that we loved their pizza and he told us that this would make his mother happy (since she's the one who made it). I thought, \"awww how sweet!!!!\".\n\nFor dessert, we had the almond cake which was not too sweet (just how we like it) and it was the perfect ending to an amazing dinner.\n\nCustomer service:\nThe servers were very attentive and came back regularly to ensure that we had everything we needed.  They also were so approachable and didn't hesitate to strike a short conversation with us (without ignoring the other customers).  We were really impressed with their friendly demeanor and they made sure that our glasses were never empty.\n\nI can't wait to take my parents here so that they can have a taste of THE BEST PIZZA EVER!", "author": "Shirleyanne A."}

So, so good.\n\nI came to Caffe BaoNecci with my girls Liz H and Ricki S. and left about two hours later laughing at the terrible service.  This place gets busy on a Saturday night so we didn't mind waiting.  After waiting for half an hour (we were quoted 10-15mins) we were seated...and then ignored.\n\nAfter years of experience playing the game Diner Dash I'm quite observant at service order - if somebody gets seated after me but then gets their order taken before me, those little hearts above my head go pop, pop, pop!  Definite pet peeve.\n\nNeedless to say, it was quite a while before anybody took our order.  We got the cheese tray, prosciutto pizza, pear & gorgonzola pizza.  After a few minutes, the cheese tray gets dropped off at the table, with maybe four slices of bread.  The waiter flew off before explaining what the cheese were, so we shrugged and just dug in.  For the price I was very impressed with the amount of cheese we got - I just wish I could tell you what the cheeses were.  They were accompanied with honey and a spicy currant jam (this was good!)\n\nAfter those four baguette rounds were devoured we tried to flag down more bread...and got maybe four slices again, but this time in a basket!  After this bread was gone I gave up and just shoved cheese into my mouth with a butter knife.  Judge me all you want.\n\nWe finished the cheese and played my favorite game...waiting!  The couple next to us, who were seated after us but didn't order an appetizer already had their pizza.  And it smelled good.  After a few minutes they brought two pizzas to our table.  Yay! Oh wait..one was the prosciutto and the other was most definitely not pear and gorgonzola.  Solution?  Take both pizzas away and leave us sad and hungry.\n\nSo, while they're sorting that out we are still pizza-less.  Another prosciutto pizza comes out and finally, this one is for us!  We devour it.  It is amazing.  It is finished.  We wait another few minutes and the pear and gorgonzola comes out.  We devour it.  It is amazing.  I even devour the sticker on the pear.  JK I spent a minute or two peeling off the tiny sticker slithers.  A sticker won't kill you, but really??\n\n\nA note on their wine: we tried both the house red and the house white.  Stay far, far away from the house white.  Red was pretty good!\n\nAnywho, we wait another ten minutes before we can flag down our check.

The menu is very limited but everything we had was delicious. We started off with some traditional antipasti, followed by burrata and arugula, followed by a lovely thin crust prosciutto pizza, and finished off with arrabiata pasta. Everything was very simple, but very well made.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet the chef / proprietor herself - it was amazing what she could do out of her little kitchen.\n\nOn a regular day, I'd likely give this place 3.5 stars but after meeting the owner, 4 stars all the way.

I have declared that west coast pizza on the whole totally sucks.  But Caffe BaoNecci is really good.  Not the best I've ever had everywhere, but the best I've had in San Francisco.  Perhaps the best I've had on the left coast.  Very thin crust, excellent meats, the sauce is right, it's all great.  It's the kind of pizza that must be eaten very quickly, because it's only amazing when hot.  The staff here is excellent, they know their stuff, service is efficient, and they speak Italian.  The space is small, not pretentious or crazed, just a stellar little pizza spot that does it right.\n\nHighly recommended by a pizza snob who's eaten the best of the best in Naples, Boston, New Haven, Chicago.", "author": "Chester H."}

Pizza.  :) Not super greasy, or stale topping or puffy crust, burned or nasty pizza. It was thin crust, a little flaky, tasty and at the same time you could fold it without losing anything. I wasn't covered in flour after either. I was happy with this place. I think my favorite was the prosciutto and cheese pizza. I am a sucker for prosciutto on a pizza. Finally I have found a good pizza place in SF.  Or maybe this is just the start of many ... I hope the latter because I know I will get bored quick.\n\nDesserts here are good too.

If you have never been to Italy and don't really care about that (READ: pizza snob disclaimer (sorry!)) or just can't empathize or actually enjoy what I call crappy California pizza, then you might want to cut a few stars off this review for yourself.  I recently got back from Italy (Sorry! I'm being snobby again aren't I? woooo, I've beeeen to I~taly :P) as well and got to eat at some award winning pizzerias (really overdoing it, aren't I?).  If you have been to Italy and eat here, you will know what I am talking about!  For that magical transportation, they get full ranks from me.  This is authentic pizza here.  I will actually say that their pizza was better than some of the places I ate in Italy (naturally the award winners still rank highest for me (I'm just full of it here)).  The pasta dishes are good but I recommend just sticking with the pizzas.

If you don't like thin crust pizza, don't go here.  if doughy crust , stuff crust, deep dish, Sicilian style pizza is your bag, come with realistic expectations.  My brother has a theory that we all love the pizza of our childhood.

So of course, I consulted Yelp.  This place had the best rating.\n \nThe inside is very cute.  If you're looking for something fancy, this isn't the place for you - this is more of a homey place with an authentic Italian feel.  The tables are pretty close together (had I sneezed, I would have contaminated my neighbor's calzone), with adorable little checkered tablecloths.  Italian flags adorn the walls, as well as photos of Italy.  The best part is that to get to the bathroom, you get to walk through the kitchen, and see the magic happen first hand. \n \nOkay, onto the food.  It came out relatively quickly, which was great - we were in a huge hurry unfortunately, and didn't really have time to enjoy everything like we wanted to.  We decided to get the four cheese pizza and pesto pasta, and split them.  The pesto was good - I'd give it 3.75 stars.  It was tasty, but I've had better pesto.  It could have used a pinch more garlic.  And I don't think it had pine nuts - all of the best pestos I've had (i.e. my mom's) have had plenty of pine nuts.  The pizza was great - I'd give that 4 stars.  Paper thin crust, delicious sauce, and you could taste the different cheeses.

There was no word of warning from our waiter that the pizzas were individually sized, but after we ordered we saw other peoples' pizzas coming out and put two and two together on our own.  That was a minor gaffe, though.  The pizza itself...the dough at the middle of the pizza felt a bit gooshy and undercooked.  It was severely underwhelming, and even their prosciutto lacked the strong flavor I was expecting.\n\nThe salad was also very bland, with shredded carrots and onions atop what I can only assume is a premade mix of spring greens that was not very well washed before it came to our table.\n\nFor these bland dishes, a glass of the house wine and a cappuccino, we were charged $45 before the tip.  We left still feeling hungry and extremely disappointed.", "author": "Sadaye M."}

After coming back from Italy, I didnt know if I would be able to find the same pizza I had there in the states! Most places with the thin crust arent thin like this. \n\nMy favorite is the Napoli pizza, which includes capers and anchovies, and also the Contodina pizza, which is an amazing combination of melted cheeses, with thinly sliced pears on top. Its a gorgeous pizza to look at, and also wonderful to eat. These two are the most unique pizzas to me, and they are representative of how good this place is. All the pizzas are light, tasty, and will leave you full without feeling gross like most pizzas will. \n\nThis is a family owned restaurant, and the owner is very nice and treats all his customers like his own family. I went on a Saturday around 1pm, and there were still one or two tables left in the place, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a rather small place, but I've seen groups about 5-6 people and they were able to accomodate them easily. If you are looking for a place with good food in a touristy neighborhood this would have to be it. It also seems like a good (and impressive) place to take a date!\n\n It has a lot of hype due to the fact that you cannot get this type of pizza anywhere, with these quality ingredients, atmosphere, and customer service. Yes, you can go to North Beach pizza down the street, or any of the other tourist-based 'Italian' places on Columbus, and get what most people expect out of food: to be grossly full with bad food. Or, you can walk the extra block or two, and go here.", "author": "Mary K."}

I'm always game for trying to find a great pizza and Italian restaurant. So my wife and I gave it a shot. Caffe Baonecci did not disappoint. Not only is the service good and very friendly, but the pasta and the thinnest pizza I've ever ate rocked. \n\nI'm rating it four stars because of the price. As good as the pizza, the twelve inch pie costs $18. Ouch. It's a steep price to pay, but worth it. \n\nMy wife and I ordered the salami pizza with truffle oil and arugula. The flavors melted in your mouth and the saltiness of the salami was amazing. The crust is very thin and it worked very well. We also ordered the special of the day and it was very good. It was a penne pasta dish with ground pork and ground beef. This was authentic Italian, folks. Not only was it very good, but my wife gave it a rave review. The pizza is very thin and is solid. \n\nThe people who work there are very friendly. It's a real neighborhood place. Stefania our waitress was so friendly and accommodating and she treated us like family. Little did we know, that we were actually chatting with one of the owners.

My dining companion had not been to the Bay Area for 15 or so years and he was hankering for thin crust pizza.  Baonecci did not disappoint.  We were torn between the prosciutto pizza and the truffle salami special of the day.  The waiter kindly offered to let us do as 1/2 & 1/2.  Both were wonderful.  The salami was delicious, but both of us gave the slight edge to the prosciutto which had a saltier bite which paired well with the arugula topping.\n\nBe warned that the pizza is not large and has a super thin crust, so it will not fill you up like a slice of Golden Boy's pizza (thick, doughy crust dripping with topping) and located a few door down, but this is quality thin crust.

When you can't drench your pizza in heavy sauces, you are forced to use quality ingredients.  You taste the crust, the mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil, each individually, and then harmoniously together.  \n\nClaim to have the thinnest crust in the city, pizzas do come in a small size of 12\" and almost paper thin, barely holding the toppings together.  Four slices can vanish within minutes.  So don't plan on sharing, unless you are doing it for the sake of sampling different flavors. \n\nOther than the Marguerita pizza, we also got the one with prosciutto.  Also delicious, and especially divine if you like cured, thinly sliced meat.  \n\nWe shared a cannoli at the end of dinner which was just alright.  Nothing exciting. \n\nPrice can be more expensive than you thought, since the decor is very simple---suggesting a more humble priced menu.  But pizzas run between $15 and $20 each, and they aren't big. \n\nService is friendly and efficient.  Room is quickly filled with people, so do come early.  Some article on the wall says that they host movie nights where you eat family style for $30 each and watch a movie together.  Another charming note of this restaurant.", "author": "Candice B."}

Amazing thin crust that almost breaks in your hands, great tasteful sauce, not too much cheese, but really good cheese, and many types of great meats and fresh ingredients overall.

Great! They have that, too, and it's all good. So if you can't have pizza here three times a week you can feel safe about changing it up a little.\n\nFinally, there's the Gambaccini family.

The Stephanie salad is very nice as well, work great right before pizza.

I was the first customer that evening, so I got their full attention.  The Italian waiters are very friendly, casual yet attentive.  The place itself is simple but warm; it really reminded me of many similar neighborhood pizzerias in Italy. \n\nNow, about that pizza: I like simple pizza toppings, so I asked for the prosciuto and funghi.  The pizza topping was very correct, even it it lacked a bit more tomato sauce for my taste.  However, the thin crust has two shortcomings.  First of all, it was strangely tasteless (lacking more salt or time, or whatever) .  Also, it was just a bit overdone, it even splintered when cut.  First, I thought it was just mine, but then another table got their pizzas, and I could hear the crunching noises all the way across the restaurant!   I guess it's a question of taste, but I like mine just a bit softer.  \n\nIn any case, don't let me put you off.  It's a simple place with good vibes and decent pizza.

None of the restaurants seemed to take reservations though, so when we managed to get a table for 5 at Caffe BaoNecci I was a little worried that Yelpers had made a mistake. How could such a highly-rated restaurant come at no cost? Thankfully I worried for nothing.\n\nEverybody's going to talk about the food first but hey, at Caffe BaoNecci, you don't just get a treat for the tummy but for the eyes as well. Two servers were extremely easy on the eye, and came equipped with the biggest, cutest smiles (teehee). But onto the serious stuff: BaoNecci's thin-crust pizzas are SERIOUSLY good. No joke about it. We had the Truffle Salame pizza and as soon as it came out of the kitchen, the fragrance just hits you in the face without being overwhelming (can you actually BE overwhelmed by truffle oil)? Each crunchy, crispy bite was a trip to Textured, Tasty Heaven. We had a little awkward situation when one slice lingered on the plate, and everyone was clearly hankering over it, but that just goes to show how delish it was. We also had a Capricciosa pizza (tomatoes, proscuitto), creamy burrata, and proscuitto parma ham, which were all good, but I think the truffle salame is definitely the star of the show. \n\nOh wait, but how could I forget the Nutella + fruits pizza? Yes, their profit margin for this dessert dish must be ridiculously high but UGH THIS IS SIN THAT YOU CAN EAT. Chocolately hazelnut goodness with an abundance of strawberries and kiwis and bananas on a crispy thin-crust bed topped with sugar? HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG? I mean, I suppose if I came here everyday, I'd be 200 pounds overweight and wondering how I let myself go this far... But for now, man. Nutella pizza, I dreamt of you last night.

The wine was ok, though you can order higher prices bottles well up into the multi-hundred dollar range if you wish. The pizza was amazingly paper thin and still was able to hold itself together. Like eating the crisped edges of philo dough, which I love. Though I could've used some red pepper to make the flavor pop. The bolognese was the star of the meal, and it looked like most people were ordering pasta.

It was about 8:30 p.m. Monday night on 8/8/2011 and my wife and I along with our little baby girl thought it would be a great idea to stop by North Beach in our old haunts and grab a bite to eat before we drive back to the East Bay.   I have heard and wanted to try the pizza here at BaoNecci, so we pay for parking across the street, $11.00 and walk across the street.  \n\nBefore going inside I noticed that there were3 tables empty outside and inside about 2 tables left and the rest are filled with patrons eating their tasty looking pizzas.  Also we wanted to go somewhere cozy where it was nice and warm because it was a bit chilly outside.  So my wife goes inside and says can we get a table for 4, because we are waiting for a couple of friends who were about 10 minutes away.  The waiter or host goes to the back by the register talks to whoever that was behind it comes back and says ok and then proceeds to ask, is the other party here yet? Obviously no, but told them they should be here shortly.  Well he said, since we don't do reservations, we will seat you once they get here. \n\n WHOAAAAAAAAAA..PUT ON THE BRAKES!! I looked around the restaurant, sure didn't look like the French Laundry, nor Boulevards,  nor any 4 or 5 star restaurants that I have been to here in the states or overseas.   It is 8:30 p.m., its cold outside., the restaurant is not full, no one was waiting and sure didn't see a crowd trying to make their way in.  Plus we have a baby in our arms.  The right thing to say was, oh since they are on the way have a seat, let me tell you about the wines or beers that we serve (hint hint $$$$) you shouldn't go back outside in the cold with your baby, AND YES WE WOULD LIKE YOUR BUSINESS AT 8:30 P.M..\n\nSo who am I? Well I am not a food critic or a food snob, but I am a patron to the city of San Francisco and its hole in the walls to fine establishments.  But I do have 28 years of restaurant experience and grew up in one, since my mother and father owns one of the oldest restaurants in Sonoma County.  I spend very good money and have a very large circle of friends that we like to recommend eating establishments to and basically have had it all.  \n\nWe have never been so rudely treated and walked away with a bitter taste in our mouths.  I am sure I will end up trying this pizza place, but really in no hurry anymore, if they are still around.

We shared 2 pizzas, a salad & dessert between 2 people and left stuffed to the rafters. We had the caprese salad. It was ok - tomatoes weren't the best or quite ripe. We had the mushroom & pancetta pizza which was quite good. The other pizza we had was the Italian sausage...nothing to brag about, quite bland really. For dessert, we had the chocolate tartufo. It was pretty good, but again rather plain. Can't say I'd go back.", "author": "Katie E."}

BaoNecci is family-owned spot and they obviously take pride and enjoyment in their cooking. The ingredients are simple, fresh, and high-quality. They certainly do the right thing in using the best stuff, in moderated quantities - just the right ratio of sauce:dough:cheese:topping.\n\nThe pizza sauce has wonderful flavor and they import it from Italy (you can also pick it up from Molinari's, round the corner). It is not overly sweet and has a great tang. I had the margherita, but stuck with the standard mozzarella, which was great. Next time I would ask for more basil, as it only had two small, whole leaves.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-06", "description": "I'm so torn on how many stars to give Cafe Baonecci.  Their pizza is AMAZING. Hands down the best pizza I've had in the Bay Area.  But, I was also on the receiving end on some of the worst service EVER on my last visit.  I've been here for lunch and enjoyed the pizza & service, but when I came for dinner last Saturday night I was kind of appalled.\n\nBut, let's start with the good stuff- THE PIZZA.  They make amazing, crispy thin crust pizza.  On my last visit we had the prosciutto and arugala pizza and the gorgonzola and pear pizza.  They were both fantastic.  The pear pizza gets extra points for looking super cool as well - they take fresh curly strips of pear and throw them on the pizza after it comes out of the oven.  I wasn't 100% sold on gorgonzola on pizza before I had this, but the flavor was great and not too overpowering.\n\nNow on to the bad stuff. First, it took them much longer to seat us than was quoted - not a big deal, happens all the time.  The first strike was after they seated us, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes.  So 30 minutes waiting outside + 15 minutes waiting at the table (totally ready to order - had to entertain ourselves outside somehow) = three hungry ladies.  We finally get to order and asked for the cheese plate plus the two pizzas I mentioned above.  Cheese plate comes out and is delicious - there were 4 kinds of cheese + jam + honey and bread.  We ran out of bread with about half the cheese left so we asked for more.  Instead of getting another serving of bread the size of what we had already eaten, we got about half that.  Really?? I'm pretty sure they give bread out for free to people who don't get the cheese platter so it seems pretty absurd to skimp on that.  We again ran out of bread but just sucked it up and finished the cheese.  Next came the pizzas... and by pizzas I mean pizza.  They brought out one of the pizzas we ordered and some other pizza we didn't order.  When we told them the second one wasn't what we ordered, they took back BOTH pies.  About two minutes later they came back out with the one correct pie.  We ate that (again DELICIOUS) and the second pie came out a few minutes later.  Again, this wouldn't have been a big deal if it had been the one thing that went wrong.\n\nWell, now I have officially gone on a Yelp rant, but as you can see I still gave them four stars.  I think their food is great, I love the atmosphere and I have had good service there before.  I'm going to give Baonecci the benefit of the doubt on this one, but I'll update my review after my next visit!", "author": "Liz H."}

This is super thin crust pizza which is what you would expect to find in Naples, or Rome, or Florence.

We literally were teleported to Italy for about an hour while inside the doors here.  Food aside- this experience was absurd.  It was kind of late, 9:30 or so and we weren't sure if this place would still be open.  It was, and there happened to be a group of 10-12 Italians crowded around some tables in the corner.  One of them happened to have a guitar. Q- Who does this guy think he is with a guitar in this restaurant??  A- The life of the party.  I figured he would be playing his favorite dave matthews and kings of leon songs, but we weren't so lucky.  This group proceeded to serenade the entire restaurant with a variety of Italian hits, ranging from opera-esque duets to some Italian countryside sounding songs.  The quality of the singing was just wild.  I think I would have payed money to hear a performance like this.  \n\nSo, great vibe.  The owner of the place was our server, suggesting we get the pizza with the chilled mascarpone on top.  We did. It was great.  The bread sticks were also very simply delicious.

For their pizzas, they serve traditional thin crust pizza with specialty items on them. They even state in their menu that \"their pizza is not for the hungry person but for the connoisseur\".

They are now focusing on being a restaurant rather than pizzeria and they definitely want to shake their cafe image. I used to be able to go in for a morning or afternoon coffee as in any cafe, but they now insist that we must be dining there to have coffee. I'm pretty sure that in any other restaurant you can go in and order a dessert and coffee (although the waiter might not appreciate it, they'll do it). Their hours of operation are inconvenient and their pricing is a bit high.\n\nAll the same, at least the quality of the food is good. It's a shame about the coffee though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "It's been almost four years since I've been to Italy. I love authentic Italian pizza so much that I would take a trip to Italy just for the pizza. In the meantime, I've searched in vain for authentic Italian style pizza in the U.S. After reading many reviews in my search for a slice of Italy in the U.S., I finally came across Caffe Baonecci, and I knew I just had to try it.\n\nCaffe Baonecci is appropriately located in San Francisco's North Beach district known as Little Italy. It's a tiny speck of a restaurant hidden on the corner of the street and an alleyway, so it's easy to almost miss. Inside are only about 10 tables. The walls are covered with black and white photographs of famous Italians, including Sofia Loren and the like. A flat screen TV played contemporary Italian music videos. The tables had the traditional red and white checkered tablecloths commonly found in trattorias (a casual Italian restaurant). Though the atmosphere was casual, there were little touches of elegance, like real baby poinsettias donned by each table, and glass water carfes.\n\nPerhaps the nicest touch was not the d\u00e9cor, but our host for the evening, the proud Italian owner who is originally from Lucca. His rolling accent and humor filled the tiny space with warmth. We could hear lively Italian conversations coming from the kitchen that gave me the sense that I really could be in Italy. \n\nWe started with Stefania's Salad, which had romaine lettuce, thinly sliced apple, walnuts, and cubes of Swiss cheese, sprinkled with a light vinaigrette. I was pleased by its freshness and quality ingredients. \n\nBy the owner's recommendation, we chose the \"Monte Bianco,\" a combination of Parma ham and Mascarpone that is unique to Caffe Baonecci. The crust was perfectly thin: soft melt-in-your-mouth in the center and slightly crispy on the outside. What I love most about Italian pizza is the thin crust, so thin that you have to fold it in half like a sandwich to eat, and this is exactly how the crust is at Caf\u00e9 Baonecci. The ingredients were top-notch: San Marzano tomato sauce and Fior di latte mozzarella. True to Italian pizza, the tomato sauce was spread just thin enough, and not too acidic. It married perfectly with the fresh mozzarella, which is not oily or greasy, and the right amount of chewy. The Parma (Italian cured ham) added a little bit of saltiness. What makes this pizza truly special is the Mascarpone. The pizza arrives hot from the wood oven with a dollop of cold Mascarpone cheese in the center. (Mascarpone is a soft spreadable Italian cheese, a sweeter version of cream cheese). While the pizza is hot, spread the Mascarpone cheese over the pizza and it melts in like butter. I cannot describe in words the deliciousness of this experience in your mouth: the cool buttery Mascarpone contrasting with the warm Mozzarella and blending with the salty Parma. Truly a special pizza. I even dreamed about this pizza later that night. That's how good it is.", "author": "Kelly S."}

We called ahead sort of late one night and they sat us right away when we arrived. The staff was friendly, polite, and talkative (in a good way). They enjoyed telling us the history of the restaurant and about traditional italian ways of making pizza, I got a lesson on the origins of mozzarella cheese, it was just wonderful. The pizza was incredible. SO GOOD. My date and I only ordered one between us because we thought that would be enough food, and it was - we were full - but it was so incredibly delicious that we wanted another one. And even though BaoNecci's had closed their doors at that point they HAPPILY made us another pizza from scratch. We tried to be polite and considerate when asking, figuring that would be super annoying to have customers order more once you've closed, but they were TOTALLY cool with it!!

We asked about those tables and were told they were for people who had reservations at 7:15-- 45 min later!  We asked if we could sit there and order our pizzas in the mean time ( we knew what we wanted) - they said no. \nThe weirdest part is that they didn't tell us how long we could wait for another table ( as in putting your name in etc) they tried to shoo us out the door.

Not grungy enough to be called a dive, more like a neighborhood staple.  The kind of place you'd expect to find in NYC's Little Italy or Boston's North End.  The mother and father run the restaurant with one or more of the kids helping out now and then.  They take pride in their food and if given the chance, will talk your ear off.  If you speak Italian (which I don't) you'd be in ever better company.\n\nThe food\nThe kids ordered by the slice, and their slices were quite good looking and plenty of size there for the adults too.  However the real star was the pizza that my wife and I ordered, and it was an absolute revelation.  The Monte Bistro pizza with the marscapone cheese added cold after the pizza cooked was amazing.  The starter minestrone soup was fantastic as well, really cutting through the damp chill that one can pick up on an evening perusing the streets of San Fran.  The desserts were also fantastic with the kids ordering a few pastries from the counter case and the wife and I splitting a fresh, homemade, cannoli.  I felt that I was insulting them when we said we couldn't take the last few slices of pizza with us ... just like I would at my mom's house.\n\nThe bottom line\nThis was one of the best dining experiences we had while on our trip.  The small family run operation was a treat.  The only knock, which wasn't worth taking a star away for, was the TV which was showing the Italian equivalent of American Idol.  It entertained for about 5 min, then became annoying.  Not so much so to ruin the experience, but enough that I noticed.", "author": "Gregory L."}

I must remind myself that this is now priced similarly to any other $$-$$$ place in the city, and hence visit occasionally and with awareness, rather than treat it as a go-to lunch stop. \n\nBaonecci is now rather expensive for what one receives, yet the tv still blares Italian pop and aspects of the experience are still self-serve, like at a cafe. For regular restaurant prices I want the full experience, including elegant or interesting music, not cheap Italian pop blaring from a flatscreen, which interferes with conversation or study. I previously tolerated the music and cafe atmosphere because the prices used to be equally casual, and because the restaurant began as a neighborhood cafe that served home-style food. However, when paying $35 for lunch (per person; well, my friend ordered way more than me and we split the bill nonetheless) I don't want to feel jarred by grating music, and pay $2 for more bread. Do they want to be a cafe or a restaurant? Now it's priced as the latter, but still retains a few too many aspects of the former, given the cost. Regardless, I always wished that they would choose less jarring, cheap music, which would enhance, rather than detract, from the atmosphere.", "author": "Eliza S."}

I had no problem getting a table for 4 people at 7:00PM on a Friday evening. \n- The Baonecci Monte Bianco pizza was somewhat on the light side. The mascarpone cheese is kind of dolloped in the middle so you don't really get that much of it. It adds a creamy note to the pizza. The pizza was very light and I was expecting something more flavorful because it is named after the establishment. \n- The California Pepperoni pizza (my friends wanted it okay) was surprisingly good. The salami on top was delicious and the pizza had more sauce on it, similar to American style pizza (but not THAT much sauce).\n- The service is very friendly. You feel like you stepped into someone's kitchen as opposed to a restaurant.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n- You have to walk through their kitchen to get to the restroom. Some people might be turned off by that but I thought it was cool to see the kitchen.\n- The pizzas are not that cheap ($11-16) if you are hungry. The pizzas are super thin crust so if you are starving, one pizza is enough for only one person. \n- The decor is minimal and bare. It might be too casual for a first date but if you don't care about decor, don't worry about it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- BaoNecci is a nice gem in North Beach. It is easy to walk past this place without noticing its existence because it looks more like a bakery than a sit-down place to eat.

I am good with a standard NY style slice with fresh ingredients, but I am starting to lean toward the thin crusts...especially after eating here. \n\nWe read the reviews while visiting SF, and wanted something a bit more authentic than the normal places. We were really surprised by pizza. My daughter had the pepperoni & sausage (probably the best one), and my wife and I had the mushroom (fancier name, but I forget what it was), and the tomato/basil pizza. I am now searching all of LA for a place that has crispy crust like BaoNecci. The reason that I gave it 5 stars was the great thin crust, phenomenal pepperoni & sausage pizza, and the service was really friendly. \n\nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Rick T."}

The entire family loved it and kids finished off the last of it in no time so we finally decided to listen to the experts and ordered:\n\nRustica:  Ok, three perfect dishes!  unreal.

That's almost too obvious a statement, but when you're raised on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made with sliced wheat bread your first sampling of an Italian panino can be a tricky experience.\n\nFor me, I felt like I had too many choices before me, and none really good. (Looking at a case of panini) Open faced, looks like some combination of tuna, mayo, and peas-WTF? Next, prosciutto crudo, that means raw ham? Next, and on and on. I learned how to order prosciutto cotto and pretty much left it at that.\n\nThen you go back to Italy a little older, and this time some strange impulse moves you to order the bizarre sandwich with the peas in it. This panino, and many that follow change your life. You bust through the American palette barrier, and you'll never again hold a Subway or a Quizno's in high esteem.\n\nBack home panini have become very popular, and they are good but they are also familiar and unforeign to me. Then, about one month ago I noticed that Danilo looked a little different than it used to, and I walked in to see what's up. There are some nice new owners, who have moved the bakery cases around, and whoa! there they were! Panini only an Italian could make - giant wedges of impossibly thin focaccia. Toppings like tuna, capers, tomato and mayo, or ham, mushroom, and melted provolone. Tomato basil, olive oil, and mascarpone.\n\nI ordered the tuna panino. The tuna is used almost like a condiment to lightly add flavor to the real star of the show-perfectly flavored tomatoes, and the capers add the right amount of zing. I ate the sandwich while walking down Green Street, and when I finished I turned around and walked straight back into Danilo and ordered the ham and mushroom sandwich. Same result, goodness.\n\nNow, any time I walk near Green Street between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m., I  go to Danilo. Little by little they are adding to the menu, pizzas by the slice can be had as well. The space is still filling in, but I'm looking forward to the day when their panini case is stacked high with strange combinations. I will try them all.", "author": "Greg L."}

The key to delicious pizza is not quantity, but quality. Something America usually does very different from Europe.\n\nHere at BaoNecci, you have a thin pizza. Why? Because thick, American-style pies loaded with cheese and meat makes you fat, that's why. A thin crust calls for less toppings. But a few slices of authentic aged prosciutto and good cheese are all you need. Just enough to create that music in your mouth.\n\nBravo to the owners on their success in staying true to thin Italian pizza. This is the only place I've found in the Bay Area that serves such a pizza. Family run shop is a good experience. I enjoyed how they brought out water in the tall glass bottles with the flip top.

Even when there's way more interesting shit to watch, like some road rage happening directly in front of us in the street and Italian men leaning out their windows yelling stuff at each other in Italian. Maybe she's staring at B-- 'cause she thinks that there's only room for one Asian person in the park and that's her. I dunno. B-- is uncomfortable, so I tell him to stick his tongue out at her.

Yes, the pizza was fine, but it was not worth $17 per individual-sized pizza! The crust is super thin, since that's their angle, but its also floppy and weak compared to real Italian crusts: most of the toppings just slide off. About 1/3 of my crust shattered into charcoal when I picked it up since it was so thin and burned to a crisp on the edges of one side of the pizza.\n\nThe toppings were good, although the prosciutto is some kind of budget-variety meat which is closer in flavor and texture to thinly sliced deli ham or mortadella. The family-friend's wine mentioned in the menu was bad for $34 (maybe it should have cost more like $22-$24 at the most marked-up restaurant prices), and the server brought a 2009 despite the menu listing a 2008. I should have corrected him, so that was my fault.\n\nIn any case, the mediocrity and high prices of BaoNecci set off an evening of debates within our group about how it could happen that the masses and Yelp's algorithms could be so wrong. (Probably it is the masses). This restaurant frustrated me to the point that I wanted to start a Yelp account to warn you. I have until now just been a consumer of the otherwise informative reviews of other restaurants in the Market St. and Berkeley areas.\n\nI'm not going to give this place a very low 1-2 star rating despite being annoyed: it deserves a solid 3 stars and the atmosphere is comfortable.

Upon entering, I was impressed with the selection of foods available.  They had a whole display case full of biscotti, as well as several trays of fresh focaccia sheets in different varieties, focaccia paninis, and a few by-the-slice thin crust pizzas.  The cafe also sells Italian import products (such as de Cecco pasta and Sanpellegrino sodas).\n\nWe decided to get two focaccia paninis--one prosciutto and mozzarella and one ham, mushroom, and mozzarella.  The server heated them for us and brought them out to us when they were ready.  They were so tasty, and they were also large.  The focaccia was a little crispy, having been reheated, but it had a fresh, buttery taste.  We were both quite satisfied.\n\nI also really liked the atmosphere--cute, authentic little Italian cafe nestled on one of the side streets of North Beach.  When we walked in, we walked into an Italian conversation, and heard Italian rap music coming from the television.  The server (one of the members of the family that owns the restaurant) was very nice, and was very patient with our own Italian.  The place is cozy (maybe 5 or 6 little tables and 1 or 2 outside) and maybe not the least expensive place in the area, but it was definitely worth it!", "author": "Katrina S."}

We ordered the contadina pizza and lasagna. Both were superb in presentation and taste.\n\nThe contadina pizza is a three-cheese pizza topped with paper-thin slices of pear. Personally, I've never eaten pizza with a dough like BaoNecci's and must say that it was a nice change from the ordinary. I was very impressed by fruit on a pizza. Who would of thunk it? The pears tasted so well on the pizza that it inspired me to cut up apple slices on my own pizza.\n\nTheir lasagna was extraordinary. Not greasy at all and I did not feel bloated afterwards. I highly recommend it.\n\nI was also impressed by the authentic Italian vibe from the restaurant. The menu briefly describes about the history of the family restaurant and why they carry only two types of wine. The American and Italian flag are hung above the ceiling and several portraits of Italians can be seen on the walls. Last but not least, the tables and chairs along with everything mentioned above make you feel like you're in a cafe in Italy. Seriously.\n\nIf I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.

Its a cozy little place, with an eclectic assortment of Italian themed art on the wall and everyone that works there has an Italian accent, very authentic feeling. We brought our own wine and ordered food to share: a salad (arugula, pear, and goat cheese) and two pizzas, one with prosciutto and arugula and the other with cheese and mushrooms (I know there were two with mushrooms and cheese on the menu but I forget which one we ended up getting). The salad was good, but I wished it was bigger since it was shared three ways. Both pizzas were delicious, with the definite winner being the prosciutto and arugula; none of us usually eat red meat but this was sooo worth it. We wanted a light meal because we were going to be dancing, and pizza is not generally this type of meal, but we all left perfectly satisfied but not weighed down. Great!

Our first night in the city, we had a craving for pizza and were lucky enough to find this place on yelp.  After trying to park for 30 minutes (I don't know why we thought a car in the city was a good idea?), we found our way in.  Actually, after parking, then reading parking signs for 10 minutes and asking locals (apparently no one owns a car) trying to figure out if it was okay to park where we did, we arrived, but that's a whole different story.  The dining room was small, with Italian TRL playing on a giant TV overlooking the dining room (apparently Italy LOVES their ballads).  We were greeted by our waiter, a younger handsome man, who I immediately ordered my girlfriend not to interact with (JOKING....kind of...no seriously, I'm kidding).  He helped us select a pizza and a salad.  The salad came out first and was delicious.  I can't recall the pizza we ordered, but do remember that it had green olives.  It was different than anything I'd ever had, but is now the standard by which I measure all thin crust pizza.  It's hard to explain exactly (especially as I'm writing this review a month later), but it had a fresh/nutritious quality about it.  After we had finished the pizza, we talked to our waiter for a bit, who told us a lot about himself and his family which owned the place.  He was a very charming guy and was constantly smiling (something that seems to be increasingly rare these days).  We decided to finish off dinner with a desert, and ordered a cannoli.  Which was, like everything else, delicious.  Before leaving, I had to use the bathroom, which you have to walk through the kitchen to access.  Although the experience was weird, I do respect that their kitchen is clean, albeit small (our waiter's mom was back there and had to turn sideways for there to be enough room for me to pass....I'm 170lbs, if you're envisioning a guy that normally requires people to stand sideways to pass, that's not me).  Anyway, I came out to my girlfriend exchanging numbers with our waiter and let them BOTH know what's what......KIDDING!  I ran out crying.", "author": "Pat A."}

Even if the briosche was obviously frozen it reminded me of Milan. We ordered capuccinos and brioches and went back for focaccia. After talking with the owner we thought he would serve us the real authentic thing. My husband had the prosciutto crudo focaccia. The focaccia was stale, what disappointment... I had the focaccia with brie and that was reheated so there was no way for me to understand if the focaccia was old. We had the pizza too and that seems to be fresh. Still why would you serve a stale focaccia that costs us 8$ without saying anything? I hope this was just a mistake but I am not sure If I'll go back again", "author": "Biemme B."}

It's a 10-table (I counted) cozy restaurant, with an attentive staff and VERY good pizza.  I had an all-meat pizza, my wife had the pear pizza talk about, and my sons had a caprese pizza and a salami pizza.  All were very good and distinctive - each flavor was distinguishable and the crust was thin but foldable, so I could finish my pizza and start in on my wife's leftovers!  I would definitely recommend one pizza per person, unless you have appetizers or a larger salad.  They are a little pricey too - ours were about $20 each, but we truly enjoyed the dining experience.  My only knock is that $4.75 for a CAN of Coke for my son seems a little excessive, and they charged me for two glasses of $11 chianti, when I only had one.  (Just discovered this on the receipt.)  It's definitely a great choice for flavorful, distinctive pizzas.", "author": "Lance T."}

Even left the few block area is usually stick to when I'm in town. I made a reservation on a Wed night. Walked in and 5-7 tables were open (half the restaurant). I was by myself and they clearly only wanted to sit me at the bar which I did not. Why I made reservation for a table. They made me stand at the door for 5 mins while the original greeter told another person who came up to me and we had the same conversation about not wanting to sit at bar. He then made me wait some more. Clearly half the restaurant was empty??? Why can't I sit down? Finally they sat me. The service was ok. Not bad but not great. Had to ask for bread and it was not buttered and yummy like another review mentioned. I got the Arriabiata pasta which is supposed to be spice and garlicky. It was just ok. A bit spicy but no true taste. It did appear to be run by real Italians however but my dish was disappointing.

Baby slept the whole time, but it's not particularly quiet in there. The waiter was obviously the son of the woman we met initially, and we were all amazed at the polite service.

Believe it or not we went to THREE bakeries that did not have our sought after treat. As we walk into Danilo we notice that their case is also lacking cannolis and we softly grumble and turn to leave. The man behind the counter notices this and asks what we are looking for. We tell him of our hunt and he says \"Well why don't I run back to the kitchen and make you one... or two!\" We were so excited we jumped at the option of two freshly made cannolis. Pure gluttony. When the man returned he placed the cannolis on the table and exclaimed \"They don't get any fresher than this!\" Man was that a great cannoli. Granted it was my first one but the ricotta was sweet but not overwhelming. The chocolate chips gave just the right amount of texture and bitterness to the sweet cream. And the cherry... My favorite... Was sweet, but not candied to the sticky extreme, and a bit tart. Man did they make a fan out of me quick!

One thing we noticed that is different is the super-thin crust.  Other than that, nothing to brag about !  My kids love pizzas and they only gave a \"so-so\" rating.  I couldn't agree more.  It is definitely one of the cheap-eats in the area if you are on a budget.", "author": "Howie L."}

Try the ham and mozzarella, the tuna, or the vegetarian w/marscapone from the case.  Delish!  Foccacia is good too.\n\nSometimes on Sundays, they sell out of the good stuff by two...so go early and eat at the small counter or snag one of the few tables if you can.  This place is no frills, but as close to Italy as you're going to get around here.", "author": "Steve J."}

We wanted italian but after reading some bad reviews of the famous Stinking Rose, we found Bao Necci's. We instantly fell in love. If you're looking for a big, fancy place, this isn't for you. Its definitely a small family place. But if you want to experience some truly authentic Italian food, then you should go visit this place! We got the meat lasagne and pasta puttanesca. It was so amazing that we came back the next night for pizza! I hadn't had Italian food this great since I was in Italy!", "author": "Jennie R."}

The sauce is what separates this pizza from the others. Excellent! I will say that you better plan on having one pizza per person. They are not really filling. We had 2 pizzas and had no trouble putting them away. We actually ordered another dish. That said, as good a pizza as I've ever had. 5 stars for taste. Had to knock it down one on the portions.  Highly recommended", "author": "John L."}

I've been making and drinking em for over two years. It was $2.50.\n\nThe prosciutto focaccia sandwich was really quite good, and only $4.75. (Someone on here mentioned it being cheaper. They're not.) Where I used to work in Buffalo we had decent focaccia sandwiches, served with a salad and a little bigger for $7.95, so really, not a bad price at all. And they're pre-made, so no wait.\n\nFour stars because I gotta leave room in case I find a better place, but still wonderful and worth the money. No line, open tables, newspapers to read, friendly staff, free wi-fi and no waitress to feel bad about not tipping well.\n\nThere's a question below that yelp is asking me: Good for groups?

Me and my husband found Bao Necci (after having tried Rose Pistola's pizza which was not authentic) and we are a regular-at -least once-a-week customer. We also take our family and friends there. I love the pizza since is one of the best I have ever had . With my high standards, this place is a 5 star even in Italy and she has a unique way of making pizza from Lucca in Toscana.\nThey were less crowded when I moved here, but with their alcohol license and a few review they got, they are quite busy. The Service is the service of an Italian Trattoria/Pizzeria run by a family and you have to take it for what it is and experience the spirit. They might even tell you to go get the knife from the drawer, which is their way of making you feel at home :)\nShe always tells me that she doesn't want the place to be called a restaurant.... she loves to cook for friends! :)", "author": "Mary G."}

A very handsome young man behind the counter flirted with me (as only a European man can do!) and I found they are making the delicious corn bread loaves on Saturday again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-21", "description": "3.5 really. Pizza was good, the cheese was amazing, pepperoni also great but the almost non-existant dough just didn't do it for me. I know they are proud of their thinnest crust in the city, but man that crust is sure really thin and the flavor of raw AP flour was coming through a little too overpowering. I asked for a bathroom and they pointed me through the kitchen, it was very odd walking right through the kitchen back to the john, being from Seattle I'm not use to that, probably a little more common in bigger older cities and it was pretty fun to do so, I wanted to take my time walking through to check out the goins on but I got the vibe (and understandably so) that they wanted me out of there. Waiter was really cool, extremely friendly. It was a great place to start the night out while I was visiting friends in SF. The ravioli we had, however, I didn't really care for, it was kind of bland and dry. All in all good experience, will have to explore more pizza places next time I'm down though.", "author": "Sean W."}
