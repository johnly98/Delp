Price is ok for San francisco, but overpriced overall. Had the \"Tea for two\" and split amongst three people. Bill came out to roughly $25 per person.\n\nFood: Had the Afternoon tea for two which comes with 2 scones, tea, 2 sandwiches and an assortment of desserts. \n\nRecommend: Assam Chai Black tea. No afternoon tea is complete without having black tea with a little bit of milk. Fragrant smell. \n\nSkip: I also tried the \"Mao Feng Shui\" tea which has a \"vegetarian grass\" taste. It's a green tea, which I usually like but I found the grass taste a bit overwhelming. \n\nSandwiches:I would recommend getting the cream cheese with salmon, and ham with mustard. Their sandwiches weren't anything out of the ordinary, but they tasted fine. \n\nScones: Their scones taste ok. Nothing too  impressive. Definitely liked their sandwichs  more. They also provide some jam and cream to put on the scones.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place b/c it is fairly inexpensive, especially for San Francisco prices.

I had the egg salad and chicken curry tea sandwiches and they both had great flavor and the tomato basil soup was the warm creamy finish to a quick snack. \nGreat job sip. Parking is difficult so plan on parking at Golden gate parka and walking 2-3 blocks. I just changed the review to 5 stars, because the butter and roll served with the food was amazing to my taste buds.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-09", "description": "Given the change of ownership at Lovejoy's Tearoom, which used to be one of our favorites, we thought we'd give Sip a try, seeing the Yelp ratings.  I'm glad we tried it, but before we return, I think we'll opt for other places instead.\n\nThe food was fine, and apparently, everything is made on the premises.  We got the $27.00 3-tierd set up, and shared it, along with the $5.00 small pot of tea.  It was well priced.  If we were really hungry, there was a $52.00 (if I recall correctly) option for two, which would've been too much for us, since they're fairly heavy on desserts. \n\nWhat we didn't care much for was the loud music in the background.  I guess that just didn't match our expectations of a nice quiet, relaxing tea room experience.  It's located in a pretty lively busy neighborhood, so I guess that's the buzz they're going for inside too. The thought crossed my mind of asking them to lower the volume of the music, but if that's the vibe they're seeking, who am I to change it?  After 10 minutes or so, I didn't notice it as much, but we prefer a much more \"sedate\" environment when it comes to afternoon tea.  The Sheraton Palace is next on our list of tea rooms to try.  I'm hopeful that'll be a more quiet experience.  I've just never been anywhere for tea where the music feels like I'm kind of in a hip bar.  \n\nIf you're going on a weekend, as we did, just be prepared to encounter difficult parking.  I know that isn't as aspect of the restaurant itself, but it is a part of your experience, if that's your destination.  We came yesterday for a 1pm reservation on a sunny Sunday, and there was a flea market on Irving, along with a packed Golden Gate Park.  My husband dropped me off, as he went in search of a parking spot, and called me a couple of times, saying he was about to give up.  Not a nice way to start of our tea.  Fair warning on the parking. \n\nService was initially fine with our waiter, but no one ever came to see if we wanted more tea.  I had to flag down someone, who I believe was the owner, to ask her for a hot water refill on our tea.  She was going through the restaurant handing out the checks, but didn't seem to have time to also look around to see if anyone needed anything else.  Typically, you'll find service a little over attentive in a tea room, but that won't be something you'll experience here.  \n\nA little disappointing for us, given some of the positive Yelp reviews.  I think I'll pass on a repeat visit for awhile, given the numerous options for tea in the Bay Area.", "author": "Lori N."}

The place was actually pretty quiet.  I had called about 30 minutes ahead just to make sure they could take me and honestly, I probably could have just walked in.\n\nI ordered the high tea to get the full experience.  Everything is made in house.  The strawberry marmalade has got to be the highlight of everything.  It tasted so fresh and naturally sweet.  You can taste the love.  \n\nThe staff are really sweet.  I probably sat for 2 hours and they didn't rush me at all.  While I was there, a table had forgotten their boxed food and the server ran down the street to try to find them.

They really really did a good job making the dreary secret garden (old tea place) into a bright and airy tea room. The place was super cute and for the royal wedding they had trivia at the table! The food was really good. We got the smoked salmon, egg salad, cheddar and apple, and curried chicken. My bf liked the smoked salmon and egg salad best. I liked the cheddar apple and curried chicken. That is how you know the sandwiches are good! In addition the scones were tasty and the numerous desserts were generous (raspberry cake, Burberry cheesecake, and brownie.) My bf really liked the dessert because he felt it was not overly sweet.\n\nAll in all, there was so much food my bf said he felt the food coma coming on! What was even better was that the price for high tea was very reasonable given the amount of food and the quality. This place is definitely a better value than the rotunda, Fairmont, lovejoy and crown and crumpet (similar value as dartealing lounge but I think this place is better tasting and has a better atmosphere.)

Very cute and cozy, with just the right amount of charm but not too kitchy. Pretty new to the city, as it's only been there for 6 months. Good size and the smell of freshly baked goods wafted throughout the entire restaurant. \n\nService: I called about 30 minutes before we got there and was relieved that I didn't need to make a reservation a week advance. We were greeted and seated instantly at a cute table for two next to the window. Adorable place settings made it feel like I was in a traditional English tea house. Everyone who worked here was very friendly and attentive. Brought us more clotted cream and lemon curd when we asked for it. \n\nFood: Loved the different options of food and tea mixings they offered on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided on the afternoon tea for two, which came with four sandwiches, 2 scones, desserts, and a large pot of tea. The current scone with clotted cream and lemon curd was my favorite, because it was warm and went perfectly with my Earl Grey tea. Sandwiches weren't amazing, but I appreciated the wide variety of offerings. $51 seemed pretty reasonable to me for as much food and tea as came with the tea for two. Much better and cuter than high tea offered in many chic hotels. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with Sip and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cute place for afternoon tea in the city!

We marveled at the charm of the warm and intimate room and enjoyed ourselves for 2 hours or so.\n\nWe both ordered the Sip Tea Classic option of two tea sandwiches and one scone. Our seasonal Cranberry Orange scone was served with strawberry preserves, clotted cream, and lemon curd. Written on the blackboard are amusing instructions on how to eat a scone. A waitress told us that she favored the Cornwall Style and so we went with her suggestion. All the spreads were so yummy on the scone. \n\nI chose the Branston Pickle, Aged White Cheddar & Green Apple (recommended by our waitress) and the Smoked Salmon & Sip Cream Cheese sandwiches. The Branston Pickle sandwich was especially tasty. The tangy chutney goes heavenly with the crisp, tart apple and rich, creamy white cheddar. The Smoked Salmon had very thinly sliced salmon which made me regret not getting the Curried Chicken. \n\nFor the tea, I had the caffeine free HoneyBush. The tea had a mild honey flavor and lovely pink hue. I think I would have preferred a stronger brew. Our waitress said the cups she gave us were new. It felt special being a first time user.

This included scones, 4 varieties of sandwiches, a large pot of tea and an assortment of desserts. They were happy to let us substitute a little in the sandwiches. We added cucumber to the goat cheese and herb sandwich, which was fantastic. I also got a french press coffee. I don't drink a lot of tea.\n\nThey say that everything is handmade, and it tastes that way.

There's no speculating that the cookies are from Costco like at another unnamed other Bay Area tea place. And accordingly, the food at Sip is excellent. My only (very small) quibbles are that I prefer a slightly sweeter scone and I'd like a savory in there (a puff? a tart?) that's not a sandwich. That's just my Sip constructive criticism.\n\nSip has gone modern and more streamlined in its ambiance. It's fine but needs a little something. Maybe take some inspiration from Crown and Crumpet or Satori? They also went modern but sort of \"clever modern\" with cute references to tea culture without the doilies and clutter. Sip is really loud and needs something to absorb the sound.\n\nFor the actual tea I went with chai which was a mistake on my part because I didn't realize that what I actually like is a chai latte. The chai was fine but advertised as spicy so I expected spicy which it wasn't. I actually preferred my bagged Trader Joe's chai at home. Sip's chai was on the bland side and not as aromatic.\n\nWe got the high tea for two. Note that it's for one pot. Serving it this way for two is a great money saving idea for some twosomes. My husband and my taste in tea is too divergent so we sprang for an extra pot. The run down on the sandos: The chicken curry sandwich was EXCELLENT. One of our sandwiches strangely had quadruple the amount of currants as the others. The smoked salmon and cream cheese was also really good. The egg salad with arugula was good but not as special. The husband thought the sandos were on the small side. (He actually had a slice of pizza immediately after tea, whereas I was stuffed.)\n\nFor the scones, the currant was good. I actually didn't taste the lemon in the lemon poppyseed. They came with lemon curd, homemade preserves, and clotted cream.\n\nThe dessert course was one of the best I've had, and I think the best among Bay Area tea places. The lemon bar was very good. Their blueberry cheesecake consisted of plain cheesecake with a blueberry sauce. I might have preferred a flavor to the cheesecake, but again, quibbling. It was very good. We agreed that the brownie was the best. It was soft and moist.\n\nThe husband jokingly noted that the bathrooms in most tea places are unisex. Even though there are usually two bathrooms, the gender ratio at tea houses is so off it makes sense to make them available to both sexes.\n\n\nKathleen's High Tea Rankings\n1) Claridge's, London\n2) Le Parloir, Montreal\n3) The Fairmont Empress, Victoria B.C.\n4) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tea at One Aldwych, London\n5) Aubrey Rose, La Mesa  \n6) SIP, SAN FRANCISCO\n7) Lisa's Tea Treasures, Campbell\n8) Crown and Crumpet, San Francisco\n9) Lisa's Tea Treasures, Los Altos\n10) Tea Upon Chatsworth, San Diego (closed)\n11) Lovejoy's, San Francisco and Redwood City\n12) Lovey's, Pacifica\n13) Tyme for Tea, Fremont\n14) Lisa's Tea Treasures, Los Altos\n15) Dushanbe Tea Room, Boulder \n16) Satori, San Jose\n17) Charles Chocolates Tea, San Francisco\n18) Ampersand Science Afternoon Tea, London\n19) St. Julien Hotel, Boulder\n20) Tea Time, Palo Alto\n21) Lisa's Tea Treasures, San Jose (closed)\n22) Samovar, San Francisco (Page St.)\n23) Shakespeare's Corner Shoppe and Afternoon Tea, San Diego\n24) Cafe du The, Burlingame\n25) The Huntington Langham Hotel, Pasadena\n26) Satori, Saratoga\n27) Dartealing Lounge, San Francisco", "author": "Kathleen M."}

I think that's an amazing price compared to the afternoon teas I had in England. Though there are limited options for sandwiches and desserts, the sandwiches I had were great. I could tell they were made to order with fresh ingredients. I would definitely come again for a lovely afternoon tea. \n\nThe owner was extremely nice and helpful. \n\nI recommend making reservation because the place is small.", "author": "Shelley L."}

My boyfriend and I went to stow lake boathouse on a sunny Sunday afternoon. We passed by Sip tea room on our way to the boathouse parking lot. I knew I had to try it since sip teahouse was super close to the boat house. \n\nUpon entering, there is a sign in sheet in the front. I highly recommend you set up a reservation. The location has only few tables, so you could be waiting a while. I waited a good 20 minutes for 2 people without a reservation. \n\nTea for two, traditional English afternoon tea \nSince it was my first time ever trying a tea service, I wanted to try the 3 tier food platters. The amount of finger foods sip tea gives you is very filling. On the bottom tier, we got 3 types of sandwiches: egg salad (try this!), ham, and salmon with cream cheese. The ham sandwich was very heavy on the mustard, not appealing to my tastebuds. The coleslaw that came with the sandwiches was very delicious, probably one of the best coleslaws ive ever tried. \nOn the 2nd tier, there was 2 warm scones with whipped cream, strawberry pur\u00e9e, and lemon curd. I recommend eating the warm scone first before anything before it gets cold. The scone wasn't dry at all, which can be a problem with scones. \nOn the top tier, there was a small fruit assortment, two fudge bars with walnut crust, cheesecake topped with blueberry, and almond bars. The cheesecake was very tart, not my favorite. I loved how fudgy and chocolatey the fudge bars were. The almond bars were chewy and not too sweet. \nI got the English breakfast tea with my tea service. You get a whole pot full. I ended up finishing my tea pot half way through, and I wish my waitress came back to check up on us so I could ask her if she can refill my pot with water. It was pretty busy, so I get why she couldn't check up on us. \n\nSip tea room is beautifully decorated. A modern twist on a dainty tea party vibe. Love the small chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.", "author": "AJ C."}

We ordered Yorkshire Golden tea is it did not disappoint. All of the sandwiches, scones and desserts were fresh and delectable. The Branston pickles, British cheddar and green apple sandwich was my favorite. I purchased a jar of Branston pickles to re-crest this sandwich at home.

I came at 3:00 PM on a Sunday, so it wasn't too busy when I came, though there was just a small wait to have the tables cleared out. The tables are spaced out pretty well where you don't feel like your personal area is being invaded, and overall, it's a very chill place to catch up with a girl friend or two.\n\nThe place is on the smaller side, maybe 10 tables max.. Decorations aren't ALL OUT like Dartealing or Lovejoy, and the ambiance is more slow, reserved and quiet.\n\nThe food and tea was OK - no complaints but also nothing that stood out in particular.

My friend and I were very excited and pleased with how cute and pretty everything looked.\n\nI do recommend that you make a reservation if you plan to come here on a Saturday since they can get busy on weekends according to the staff. We made a reservation for 11:00 am and all seats were filled by reservations when the shop opened. \n\nWe had the Tea for Two ($51), which comes with our choice of \n- Large pot of tea, scone of our choice (one/person), four tea sandwiches, coleslaw, Sip clotted cream, strawberry preserves, assorted sweets for two (one of each variety/person)\n\nHONEYBUSH TEA (5 stars) // This wonderful tea had a beautiful sunset orange color and its aroma was just as described: like peaches and honey. The waitress offered us a bottle of honey to add into the tea, and the honey enhanced the taste of the tea so that it actually matches the aroma. We fell in love with this tea. The tea pot, cups, and strainer were also very pretty to look at.\n\nTRADITIONAL CURRANT SCONE (3 stars) // I found my scone dry and unexciting even when paired with the yummy, tart lemon curd. The clotted cream tasted similar to unsalted butter. The strawberry preserves were nothing special.\n\nTEA SANDWICHES (choice of 4 sandwiches, 3 sandwiches/choice)\n       (3 stars for the fluffy, white[?] bread that looked a bit gray)\n1) Branston Pickle, Aged White Cheddar & Green Apple (5 stars) // This was our only vegetarian choice and we ended up loving it. The branston pickle chutney was so savory and yummy, and was a great contrast to the strong aged cheddar and light apple slices. \n2) Baked Ham, English Mustard & Tarragon Butter (3 stars) // This was definitely one of our least favorite, it can be described simply as ham between two slices of bread. \n3) Smoked Salmon & Sip Cream Cheese (3.5 stars) // I generally love smoked salmon sandwiches, this one was okay. A little more creativity would've made a big difference. I also think if the smoked salmon was kept cold right before serving, it would taste better as well. \n4) Sip's Curried Chicken (4 stars) // This sandwich definitely had the strongest flavor. It was a yellow curry chicken sandwich with raisins mixed into the spread, the sweetness from the raisins was just what I needed to cut the heaviness of the curry.\n\nCOLESLAW (4.5 stars) // Nice touch with the addition of apple bits! A little saltier than the average coleslaw with a touch of black pepper.\n\nASSORTED SWEETS (variety of 3 pre-picked sweets of the day/person)\n1) Berry New York Cheesecake (4 stars) // This was my favorite. The cheesecake is surprisingly not as firm as I had expected but overall very yummy.\n2) Chocolate Indulgence (3 stars) // This is just a personal rating because this was VERY rich chocolate. Maybe this is for you if you like chocolate as much as Chocolate Boy from Hey Arnold.\n3) Finger Shortbread (2 stars) // Dry shortbread topped with almond slices. \n\nOverall pretty pleased with our experience here, definitely recommend to anyone looking for a decently priced high tea experience.", "author": "Amy T."}

Today warrants an excellent review.\n\nA friend and I both love high tea, and traveling to different tea rooms throughout the Bay Area and beyond. Today we decided to try Sip Tea Room, and I'm so glad that we did. Out of all the High Teas that I have been to, \"Sip\" has made it to the top of my list.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, open and simple, but still elegant with chandeliers, china and lace tablecloths. There are subtle hints of the U.K. throughout the room. Not overly done, and not crowded with knick knacks, hats and feather boas (which I always felt to be rather creepy, sharing those items with people that have already worn them for who knows how many times). Room to sit comfortably without being crammed against other tables, or in some places...sofas, and sale items.\n\nThe menu is not inundated with a bizillion tea choices, but the teas available should appeal to a wide range of people. The smell of freshly baked scones fils the air, making tea time even more inviting. Fresh sandwiches were all very good and on super soft bread, the sweet treats were incredible, particularly the lemon bar, and the coleslaw was very tasty. The fresh fruit included with the sweeties had PINEAPPLE...my favorite!\n\nService was excellent. Our wait person was as wonderful as the place itself, and we got to meet one of the owners, Paula, who gave us a little background history on \"Sip\". Both Paula, and her wait person are British, which to me, makes it all the more authentic and fun.\n\nAnother nice \"rule\" is that children are asked to remain seated. Too often I have gone to places where there are \"free range chickens\" who are disturbing to other patrons. Tea should be relaxing!\n\nI could go on and on, but I won't. Others have already covered the bases. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try some of the other items that were not included with our High Tea.", "author": "Cynthia S."}

The annoying part was not the waiting but the fact that for good 5min we just stood there without getting acknowledged at all.  This was a consistent theme throughout our experience.  While the staff is friendly when you do interact with them, flagging them and getting their attention is no easy task.  The tea room is small and they don't scan the room to see if anyone needs them -- they ignore you until you randomly fall into their line of vision.  \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was very well done.  Tea sandwiches were just right -- not too much bread, plenty of filling, very tasty.  Pastries accompanying the tea were lovely, not overly sweet.  Tea selection is typical -- nothing exotic or fancy -- but good quality tea.  \n\nTo be honest, I'm torn about this place in regards to coming back.

Kudos to their website's rule section because it was so helpful to properly prepare!). I changed the number once after that and then still showed up missing one guest and they didn't complain! Instead they swiftly removed the (now) extra place setting and had my friends and myself settled down for tea about one minute after they opened the doors. \n\nI found out later on that this was all 5 friends' first high tea and was so pleased that Sip was their first experience. I've been to my fair share of teas around the world and this was a really pleasant one with good food and good tea. \n\nThey did serve traditional fair, with nothing extraordinarily creative or different, but it's nice to know a traditional staple is out there featuring tea sandwiches, scones with curd, cream, and preserves, and assorted sweets.\n\nThe decor wasn't traditional for the less expensive Bay Area teas I've attended, but that was a huge draw for me. I'm not interested in the stuffier, over-the-top lace and trinkets.

I was a big fan of the cranberry orange scones. The strawberry jam paired with he scones were delicious! My friends were a fan of the lemon one. My favorite sandwich would have been the egg salad. The sourness is the pickle one with white cheddar stood out to me too much so it was my least enjoyed one. The crust part of the blueberry desserts were burnt tasting, which made us all not a big fan of the dessert plate. Very cute spot with festive and cute decor, service was amazing and very honest.

I was so excited to have a tea place in the sunset! But this place just doesn't flavor their food. The cucumber sandwiches and the salmon sandwiches are flavorless and don't have enough filling for the thickness of the bread. The jam for the scones isn't sweet enough, and if you get a scone without a tea package you have to pay $1.25 for any jam/clotted cream/lemon curd you want, and then they only give you a tiny scoop! For $1.25 you should get a bigger portion! The slaw doesn't taste good. The dessert bites don't seem very British and most of them don't taste good either. All around a very disappointing meal both times.\n\nAlso it's cute inside but it'd be more fun if the tea service cups/teapots at our table matched each other. \n\nThe servers are nice though so I guess I'll give 2 stars instead of 1.", "author": "J M."}

It was very run down and really needed serious updating. The tea house closed and is now under new ownership, SIP.  \n\nThe new owners have made a tremendous amount of improvement compared to the old tea house.  I give them top kudos for the redecoration and updating.  Sip did a great job!  I think this is why my honest review pains me so.  I would have loved to have given SIP a five star rating.  I'm not sure why this tea house has gotten a 5 star rating?\n\nSurprisingly enough I had reviewed Yelp to see the rating and decided that I would give SIP a try.  I have a childhood friend that I get together with a couple of times a year.  We looked at going to SIP as an adventure.  \n\nThe presentation was lovely.  The service was good, too. The first thing my friend asked for was half and half and they said they didn't have anything but milk.  I've never been to a tea house that didn't have half and half or cream.  The finger sandwiches were average nothing extraordinary.  The scones ok but probably the best thing on the platter because of the truly delicious curd, clotted cream and strawberry preserves.  I love sweets but the desserts were not light or delicate but really rich and sugary.  The fruit cup consisted of one cut strawberry, one blueberry and a couple of orange mandarin slices, not nearly enough for two.  The tea was good although I think it could have been a little warmer.\n\nI think one of the biggest hurtles SIP has is to make better food than their predecessor, Secret Garden.  Secret Garden was terribly run down and the service not so great, however, the food was excellent.  \n\nI think this could be a really great place.  Perhaps the owner just needs to dial it in a bit.

I haven't had high tea since visiting England in 1992!  The chocolate chip scone was our favorite with real clotted cream.  Service was fantastic and as well as the decor.  Thank you for a great experience.", "author": "Elements Of Light L."}

Although I hadn't planned on eating, the smell of fresh-baked scones was too tempting. I was so glad I ordered one after slathering on homemade clotted cream, strawberry jam and lemon curd. Now I can't wait to go back for lunch to try more.", "author": "Wynne B."}
