Which, coupled with how this is the third one I've reviewed, probably makes this a little less useful.  Yet, redundant at this is, it's also entirely necessary.  Why's that, you ask?  Uhh...because it's ice cream, duh.  What kind of monster would I be if I DIDN'T write about them??\n\nIn all seriousness though, Smitten is pretty awesome.  Besides being the preeminent spot for \"nitro ice cream\" in the Bay Area (ice cream made with liquid nitrogen, which creates a creamier, icicle-less texture), their stuff is also just that tasty, simply enough.  On any given day, they usually offer (just) six different flavors - three or four of their staples (Vanilla, Fresh Mint Chip, TCHO Chocolate, and Cookie Dough with Pretzels & Chocolate Chips) along with a couple of flavors they rotate through.\n\nWhile I normally give preference towards whatever seasonal flavors they happen to have (Mountanos Organic Coffee and Peaches & Bourbon, in this case), I decided instead to finally try their COOKIE DOUGH WITH PRETZELS & CHOCOLATE CHIPS ($5, small).  Though not nearly as good as their Lemon with Shortbread Cookie (my all-time favorite), it's easy to see why this is their most popular flavor.  Equal parts classic and unique, (slightly) salty and sweet, crunchy and creamy.  What's more, the texture was so smooth!\n\nBeyond the ice cream, everything else about this Smitten is just like the others that I've been to - both good and bad(-ish).  The service/staff here is just as quick and friendly, and the ice cream is just as delicious, but the menu is also just as narrow (though they do offer some tasty looking sundaes).  Still, it's hard to argue against Smitten.  Other ice cream joints in SF might be better, and nitro ice cream may be losing its novelty, but there's no denying they still serve up some tasty ice cream!", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-17", "description": "The ice cream we had from Smitten Ice Cream in the Marina District was delicious. This is a California ice cream chain that differentiates itself from other ice cream shops by churning each order to order. The result is some of the freshest-tasting ice cream you'll probably ever eat. If you've ever had Thai-style stir-fried ice cream (or \"rolled\" ice cream) which is flash-frozen on anti-griddles, the idea here is similar; however, the mixing and churning process at Smitten is a lot less labor-intensive thanks to the company's patented machinery and equipment.\n\nThis location of Smitten opened on July 2, 2016 in the old Judy's Cafe space on Chestnut. In the 1930s and 1940s, this space was home to another ice cream shop, Eastman's Ice Cream. I'm sure Eastman's never foresaw a huge liquid nitrogen tank installed on the second level, overlooking the shop and connected to a network of touchscreen tablets and ice cream churners below. When you place your order at the register, it's automatically sent into Smitten's system and the creation process begins. At each station, ingredients are mixed and frozen in only about 90 seconds. It's fun to watch and sort of a mini spectacle. You'll see bowls and mixers spinning in different directions among billowy clouds of thick white smoke. It looks like some sort of crazy science experiment.\n\nWhile the whole contraption looks really cool and technologically advanced, some might also perceive it as gimmicky. Fortunately, the ice cream is actually tasty.\n\nWhen we visited, ice cream flavors included vanilla, peaches and bourbon, Mountanos Family organic coffee, cookie dough with pretzels and chocolate chips, TCHO 60.5% chocolate (TCHO is a fancy chocolate brand from Berkeley), and mint chip. These were sold at $5 for 2 scoops, $6 for 3 scoops, $7 for a half pint, and $11 for a full pint. (The peaches and bourbon flavor was $1 extra.) Daily scratch-made waffle bowls and cones were $1.50 each and toppings and sauces were $1 each. Examples included all-natural rainbow sprinkles, organic whipped cream, spiced oat crumble (new), and TCHO crispies and chocolate sauce. They also sold a root beer float for $6.50 and vegan pops for $4 each. The menu states they use organic milk and cream and fruits and vegetables from west coast farms.\n\nThe menu also featured a few sundaes which were ice cream, topping, and sauce combinations that Smitten put together. I tried a couple of these and a half-pint of cookie dough with pretzels and chocolate chips. They were:\n\n* Choc Full O' Mint (two scoops, $10.50) - fresh mint chip ice cream, TCHO crispies, TCHO chocolate sauce, organic whipped cream, waffle bowl\n* Dough My Goodness (two scoops, $9) - cookie dough ice cream, cookie dough, TCHO chocolate sauce, organic whipped cream\n* Cookie Dough with pretzels and chocolate chips (half pint, $7)\n\nIn general, the ice cream was great. Of the items I tried, my favorite was the Choc Full O' Mint sundae. It had the best combination of flavor and consistency, from the smooth and refreshing mint ice cream to the light and crunchy TCHO crispies and house-made waffle bowl. The cookie dough ice cream was excellent as well. Personally, I could have done without the pretzels, but they were fine. All of the ice cream flavors were sweet, rich, and delightfully creamy. To me, taste and quality-wise, this ice cream was on par with other specialty and gourmet ice cream shops. So, to be honest, Smitten's elaborate setup doesn't really produce an ice cream that is head and shoulders above the competition, but it is still very good and quite satisfying. It's definitely worth a visit.\n\nAfter tip and tax, I did think $13 was pushing it a bit for a two-scoop sundae, but then again, this is the Marina in San Francisco.\n\nService was quick.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, Smitten has six locations in the Bay Area (four in San Francisco) and three in Southern California. This location was the third San Francisco store. This is a fairly small shop with limited indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seats are neat; they're custom-made out of milk crates. The inside of the shop has a modern and trendy vibe.", "author": "Daniel B."}

It Costs $5 for the ice cream in a cup and $1 for the chocolate sauce plus sf ordinance fee total of $6.30. They didnt charge any taxes. But their ice cream was still good\n\nOne thing thats cool about this place is that they use a machine where they make your ice cream fresh each time.

He even passed along a cute business card from them, which really sold it to me.\n\nUpon walking into the store, I noticed that the same kind of stylish-yet-functional design applied to their interior. There's a big, easily-readable menu with their usual flavors and add-ons, for one. The lines are designed to allow the customer enough time to read the menu, and the queue for the finished product lets people see their liquid nitrogen ice cream as it's made in modified stand mixers. Kids and science geeks will especially love that.\n\nIf you've ever had Dippin' Dots, which is also manufactured with liquid nitrogen, you'll be familiar with the type of ice cream Smitten produces. It's just as creamy as my friend said, but lacks the heaviness of other ice creams made using traditional methods. This allows you to digest more scoops than usual, which I theorize is the reason why they give you two scoops as the smallest size. I split a strawberry mascarpone (mascarpone ice cream and strawberry coulis) with my significant other and found that it tasted like delicious New York cheesecake, complete with real chunks of berry. We weren't getting a bad deal, considering that we were in the Marina District and liquid nitrogen is pricey to get a hold of.\n\nThe downside is that ice cream melts very quickly without the subzero temperatures used to keep liquid nitrogen cool. Not fun if you're a slow eater. You also can't get more than one flavor in a cup, so if you want variety for an affordable price, you're better off going somewhere else.", "author": "Gwen W."}

Maybe because I've never had ice cream made with nitrous oxide before, but this was the smoothest and creamiest ice-cream I've ever tried. While they don't have a lot of flavors, they do make each flavor batch individually in front of you and allow you to try samples! The chocolate ice cream with almonds was absolutely delicious, but I didn't like the joyous almond flavor- it tasted like it had dessert cherries mixed into it, not my favorite flavor. The Meyer lemon was really tangy and delicious- a must try for anyone who likes tangy ice cream. The early grey was really flavorful and while I didn't like it very much I could see how someone who loves earl grey would really enjoy that flavor. The staff who helped us were wonderful and kind.

Then when I saw it was made with Nitrogen Gas, I thought this was so neat and cool and had to go see it. I have heard of ice cream being made this way but have never come across it so it was neat. \n\nAfter our late lunch at Pier 39, my husband and I caught a cab to Smitten on Chestnut to get ice cream. When we got there the staff was nice or at least the guy running the cash register was welcoming. The girl making the waffle cones and bowls didn't say anything when we walked in and the other girl with dreads didn't say much either and was behind the counter singing a Drake song that was playing. Anyway besides not having a more welcoming greeting the experience was good. \n\nMy husband got plain Vanilla Ice Cream with Strawberry Sauce in a waffle bowl. I ordered Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream with Pretzels. His ice cream was very good. Not much to talk about since it was plain Vanilla. The sauce itself was more on the tart side than sweet but still good. I didn't try his waffle bowl but I imagine it was good since he didn't say otherwise. My ice cream was very good. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough was a childhood favorite and I still like it as an adult so I couldn't pass up on this flavor. Then when I saw Pretzels were added I was like this has to be a win. It definitely was. You get the bits of chocolate chip, cookie dough and pretzel in each bite. The pretzels added a salty touch. Overall good flavor. The texture of the ice cream is good. It's a little more firm and creamier than other ice creams. It wasn't bad just a tad different. \n\nOverall, it was cool to experience how the ice cream was made.

And with the heat wave hitting San Francisco this past Sunday, it was perfect timing to check out the goods here.\n\nThis shop is tiny. Three stools by the window and  a wooden bench that can be a cosy seat for three with packages. Outside there are also high tables with stools to perch on.\n\nWhat I see is that Smitten offers flavors that serve as a base. The deal here is that they want you to pay for add-ons to soup up their scoops. Let me suggest to first-timers, like I was, that you try out their ice cream straight first. Just to get an idea if you like it.\n\nSince I was there with my buddy B, we decided to share a regular ($6) cup of the Earl Grey ice cream with milk chocolate chips.  Sharing is caring, isn't it?\n\nSince each ice cream order is made fresh, expect to wait a bit after you order. You can stand towards the front (since the shop is quite narrow) and watch the staff make their magic happen. The ingredients are poured or spooned into the metal container. The liquid nitrogen is introduced and with a whir, the ice cream is churned in minutes.\n\nSo how does Smitten measure up?\n\nFor me, ice cream breaks down into the following characteristics:\n\n(1) Flavor\n(2) Texture\n(3) Uniqueness (a certain je ne sais quoi that offers a little verve)\n\nFlavor - 3 stars\nThe earl grey ice cream is very subtle. This is a great flavor for someone who doesn't like overly cloying, in-your-face tasting sweets. It definitely appeals to the sophisticated palate. The milk chocolate chips were also very pleasant. Tasting this flavor was similar to tasting wine. You have to inhale to enjoy the subtle taste and take in the tea aroma.\n\nTexture - 2 stars\nI understand liquid nitrogen causes the ingredients to freeze super fast as compared to the regular ice cream process. But as I said to B, the consistency of Smitten ice cream falls between soft serve and true ice cream. The latter is typically solid because it's been frozen for some time. The product here is whipped up very quickly and doesn't have that solid consistency. Add to that a hot day, and the ice cream starts melting quite quickly; in turn you have to eat it quickly or end up having a cup of milk.\n\nUniqueness - average rating of 3\nThe liquid nitrogen process (only in the SF area would a techie process add to this factor) is a 4 for the novelty; whereas the ice cream flavors are 2 - hence an average of 3.\n\nSeriously though, the ice cream here is not very memorable. It was okay and I would eat it again if I'm in the area. Guess I'm just not \"smitten\" with the place that I'd make an effort to come back.", "author": "Joanna T."}

The flavor of it was very strong, which is great then just tasting like plain ice cream. \n\nAlso, the way they make the ice cream was very neat because they use liquid nitrogen which is different than other ice cream stores. So it gives you a show while you're waiting to get your ice cream. I would say it does take a little bit longer for your ice cream to come out.

The menu is simple with five flavors to choose from(I think it's different flavor everyday) and the toppings/sauces. I went for the small scoop of classic vanilla in a waffle bowl with toasted almonds which totaled out to be $7. Smitten is great because they make your ice cream right in front of you in the ice cream machines with nitrogen so you know it's fresh! The ice cream definitely tasted better than regular ice cream where it didn't melt as quick and the toasted almonds gave it a nice crunch.

Once you look past the literal smoke and mirrors magic trick of how they make their ice cream you find it to not be good at all.\n\nThis is my first negative review of anything on yelp.", "author": "Pauline L."}

I love the cookie dough with the cookie dough topping. This week they featured a cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream with pear caramel sauce and OMG it's easily one of the best desserts I've ever had! While I wish they had more seating, especially when the line literally goes out the door, I love this place and will definitely be a frequent customer!", "author": "Elizabeth H."}

The chocolate ice cream was not very flavorful, the mojito flavor was weird and the waffle cone was sloppy. Front register cashier was rocking a major attitude! My order was messed up and I was blamed for not paying for my cone, which I paid for and tipped $3 for $14 ice cream. Not worth the wait or the cost!", "author": "Tasha B."}

I had the cookie dough, pretzel and chocolate chip ice cream. It was delicious! A of the ingredients tasted fresh and the crispness of the pretzel was amazing.

I had the TCHO 60.5% chocolate flavor and it was rich, but not over powering. A fun, quirky atmosphere, the best part is that you get to watch the ice cream be made using liquid nitrogen!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-07", "description": "I've tried lots of ice cream places and after passing a certain level, they all are kinda hard to differentiate from each other. Most shops have trademark flavors to set them apart...humphery schlocomb has the corn flakes flavor, mitchell's has a lot flavors inspired by asian desserts. And while Smitten has fewer flavors--only 4 or 5 at a time (due to the way they make all the ice cream on demand)-- and costs a little more, I've got to say the end result is satisfying and pretty tasty. It may lack variety, but they focus on a few really interesting flavors each week and from what I've tasted, they know what they're doing. I've only tried the cookie dough pretzel and chocolate flavors, but that was all I needed to try to convince me to go back and recommend this place to anyone who enjoys ice cream. The cookie dough flavor has crunchy bits of chocolate and pretzel with chewy chunks of cookie dough. The waffle cone is a pretty good add-on too... it's crunchy and sweet and makes a perfect compliment to the creamy ice cream. With this place just down the street from work, I'll be tempted to come out for some ice cream after lunch more often.", "author": "Captain Z."}

Anyway, after walking in to look  at the menu, we were immediately engaged in conversation by an extremely enthusiastic associate. She gave us recommendations and described the flavor profiles in depth. She even swayed me, and I never eat ice cream because it wreaks havoc on my digestive system. Anyway, we ordered, and the cashier was just as enthusiastic about the waffle cones as the associate was about the ice cream. I opted out but did take a sample of the waffle cone, and it was delicious. Anyway, we both ordered the pretzel cookie dough flavor and it was very good. The price was a little steep, but I suppose we also pay for the novelty of the experience, so I am not going to quibble about it. An excellent atmosphere and cute decor in the store as well. BEST PART: no digestive distress! Crazy.", "author": "Anju O."}
