It was like a one-night stand that I immediately regretted and hoped in hindsight that it was all just a nightmare. But it wasn't. It was real. Over a decade ago. Before Grubhub. Before Eat24. Before DoorDash. Actually it wasn't that horrible, but I remember trying their diet special of Steamed Chicken with Vegetables, not the best idea for takeout since it was sitting in the delivery guy's car for quite some time before it got to me. Dried out and rubbery is what I remember.\n\nNow I came back because I was looking for some lunch after a half-hearted workout at the gym and realized I had never actually been in the restaurant before. It was pretty sparse but frankly what I expected. I didn't order the Steamed Chicken with Vegetables but instead went for the $7.95 Eggplant with Garlic Sauce. It was drowning in the perennial brown sauce that always puzzled me at every low-end Chinese restaurant as to how the cook can achieve that particular shade of brown on a plate (photo: http://bit.ly/2s52WR1).\n\nThe white rice looked absolutely timid afraid to be overcome by the sauce. Because it was part of the lunch special menu, I got a cup of the Soup of the Day, which judging from the brownness of the broth, I was guessing it was the same soup they served the day before, maybe even the year before (photo: http://bit.ly/2rZulng). And of course, there was the obligatory deep-fried egg roll which I didn't touch. Yet for all that, it was not the same one-night stand from a decade ago. I mean my server didn't boil my pet rabbit in a stock pot. She was quite nice.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...a whole lotta brown\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...plain inside\nSERVICE - 4 stars...no Glenn Close...she was pleasant\nTOTAL - 2 stars...did I mention how brown that sauce was?", "author": "Ed U."}

Its your standard american style chinese takeout but great prices and huge portions. I ordered both the house special chicken fried rice and the fried wontons to barely put me over the 10 buck free delivery. \n\nI swear it was enough to feed 3 or 4 people. The wontons were freshly fried and very crispy but not much meat to speak of. At 4 bucks for a giant rack of them I cant complain tho. The fried rice had a solid blend of all the meats, egg, and veggies but while healthier i suppose was steamed instead of fried. I was in a greasy chinese takeout fried rice kinda mood but it wasnt bad and was a ton of food. \n\nNot bad but nothing to write home about. Great price for alot of food if your living on ice cube sandwiches till payday as well.", "author": "Sean G."}

It's typical american chinese, but they also have some more interesting dishes if you branch out.

When I arrived, there was a short line of 2 people. Shortly after I stood in line, some random guy cuts us all and begins to order his food. Mind you, the 2 other people and I were waiting in line for a few minutes (even stopped 2 waiters to ask if we could order since no one was near the register and was told to wait).  I asked the waitress why she skipped us (ignored me) and she continued to take his order. \n\nBut wait... there's more! While this waitress takes the cutter's order, another waitress starts helping people at the end of the line (these people came in AFTER we did) and taking their orders. By this point I was pretty irritated (its plain boiled rice that I already paid for and now I have to wait while you help people that came in after me?). \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back.

Its a hit or miss, some days its salty, some days its bland, and some days its made just right. I always had hot sauce to it, so it makes everything taste pretty good. They do delivery and online order and pick up. It's so much easier to do that but I would always check your order before you leave. There were a few times I've requested certain things, and they simple just dont' look at the extra comments being made. \n\nDelivery is quick and easy,since there are times I'm at the office and its too busy I don't have time to go out and pick up. I have to say they do get really busy especially other companies are around and people go there to eat. I've ordered once in the restaurant and it took forever to just get my food. \n\nI've also tried their wonton noodle soup, it was really salty the first two times buying git. And the soup base was very dark almost as if a lot of soy sauce was added to the soup base. \n\nAll in all its not super expensive and you pay for what you get.

The food is good, just as I expected for a standard Chinese Restaurant.  The portion size for the rice plate lunch's we ordered was filling, and there were leftovers.  The Garlick Chicken wings became an immediate favorite.  My only complaint was about the ordering process.  It seems that their Website Menu has not had it's prices adjusted for 5+ years, or so I was told by the owner.  We had questions because it was our first order, so we called using the Menu for our ordering.  When it was delivered the bill was 25% higher than I expected.  I called for clarification, and was told that the online menu hadn't been updated in years, but If I look at the online ordering tab, that does have the correct prices.   So I suggest that anyone ordering by phone, ask for their current price fo the items being ordered.  One other piece of info,  Not all the Items shown on the menu appear in the online order tab.  Primarily, the lunch rice plates I order by phone I wouldn't have been able to order online.\n\nAll in all, be aware of the inaccuracy of prices, & discrepancy of dishes available, when you order.

The order was delivered at 3:35 PM.  The estimated time for delivery was 45-60 minutes.  Delivery was prompt but not particularly fast.  There is no delivery fee.  The delivery person was polite.\n\nOrder Minimum - It is very low ($10)\n\nMandarin Spicy Chicken - Even thought the dish has the word spicy in the title and I selected the Hot option, there was nothing spicy about it.  It was bland, bland, bland.  They also did NOT include the side of hot sauce that was requested.  If you like broccoli, they did include a ton of very fresh broccoli.   \n\nMongolian Beef -  This is another dish that is traditionally spicy and I selected Hot.  But, it was also bland, bland, bland.   I have no idea what you get if you select mild.  Once again, they did NOT include the requested side of hot sauce. The meat was tender but was quite oily.  The veggies were crisp but it was basically just onions.\n\nBoiled Rice - The rice was good.  I ordered and paid for two orders.  However, I only received one small container.  I can't imagine that two orders of rice could be squeezed into that small of a container.\n\nPacking - The food was neatly packed in a combination of clam-shell and traditional Chinese take-out containers.\n\n7-Up - I ordered and paid for 3 7-Ups.  I only received one and it was room temperature.\n\nPricing -  I would place their prices on the mid to high range for Chinese food delivery.\n\nMandarin Spicy Chicken 1 $7.50 Make it : Hot\nInstructions: side of hot sauce please\n\nMongolian Beef 1 $7.95 Make it : Hot\nInstructions: side of hot sauce please\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3nl5c54\n\nCan Soda 3 $1.25 Flavor: 7UP\n\nBoiled Rice (For One) 2 $0.95\n\nSubtotal: $21.10 \nTax: $1.79 \nTotal:   $22.89 \n\nFortune Cookie - Now is the best time for you to be spontaneous.  Serendipity!\n\nLucky Numbers - This was some kind of budget fortune cookie.  It did not have any lucky numbers.  They could only afford the fortune.\n\nOverall - Bland food.  Delivery that is not particularly fast. So so prices. Inaccuracies on the order.  No lucky numbers.  I would not rate it as one of my top experiences. Their low minimum delivery fee would make them a money saving option for ordering for one.", "author": "Mark D."}

You'll make it to your next paycheck courtesy of the taxpayers but if you eat at Shanghai China on a regular basis kiss your government pension goodbye.  (Taxpayers cheer.)  \n\nWhen it came time for the bill, we payed with a pile of cash and a credit card.  Apparently, this dual-payment method was too much for the waitress.  Confusion ensued behind the counter and before we could finish the last drops of green tea to clear our arteries the entire staff, including the \"chef,\" were staring down at us, making comments amongst themselves in some far-Eastern dialect.\n\nAlthough we asked if there was an issue, the replies were, uh, inscrutable.  Eventually, we were able to surmise that the Shanghai China staff thought we left no tip.  On the contrary, we left an appropriate -- considering the service -- 10 percent.  \"Americans leave tip,\" the waitress scolded.  In frustration, and perhaps with an overriding desire to make it back to his wife & kid in one piece, a coworker threw down an extra $5 to get us the hell out of there.       \n\nI call on all public employees to boycott this dump and leave it the likes of Google & Facebook who, rumor has it, will soon be in the neighborhood...", "author": "Paul D."}

But after work weeks of salads and sandwiches, I sometimes just swallow the inevitable disappointment and just eat Chinese in SF.\n\nYou walk in and it's pretty clean for a cheap Chinese restaurant. I don't know if it's because they weren't too busy or because I'm Chinese and impressed them by ordering in Mandarin or just because but I was greeted, seated and served tea immediately. I ordered a lunch special and was given a bowl of hot and sour soup.\n\nHot and sour soup: not the best I had but definitely not the worst. It's not watery but the flavors didn't have the complexity I've tasted in better versions. All in all, it was loaded with goodies and left a pleasantly burn of spice in my mouth.\n\nYu Hsiang eggplant: the portion is massive. I order this 50% of the time when I eat Chinese and this wasnt so bad. I don't know that I would come back just to have it but I was able to eat a good amount. It wasn't very spicy though adding chili oil helped there and the flavor was decent. The eggplant was at least marinated in the sauce. Again not the best but not the worst. Especially good for SF since my total was $6 and Chinese food in the city is almost always overpriced (and what's up with being closed on holidays and/or one day out of the week? Chinese restaurants in LA wouldn't do that.)\n\nThe service was pretty good. They weren't overly attentive but I also didnt need much. \n\nIf you're looking for delicious authentic Chinese food, you're looking in the wrong city. Try South Bay. You can tell this place isn't one because the table settings feature forks (not chopsticks) and its called \"Shanghai China Restaurant\" yet doesn't serve xiao long baos and is missing other trademark Shanghainese dishes. Also the fortune cookies. \n\nIf you like typical Americanized Chinese fare that is on par to the rest of the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, I don't think you'll be especially disappointed.", "author": "K C."}

Even if you serve tasteless, almost inedible food with rude service, THEY WILL COME! Why? Because people have no where to go but here, THAT'S WHY!\n\nShanghai China is a block away from the office and although it's NOT as bad as Iron Wok, it's STILL bad nevertheless. It's one of those, \"Damn it, I didn't bring lunch to work and it's my last resort type of thing without having to go too far.\"\n\nI've been here 3 times and have tried the following:\n\nFOOD:\n*Mu Shu Pork: A stir fry combo of sliced pork, egg, cabbage, wooden ears fungi, bamboo shoots, carrots, and onions. The veggies were overcooked and mushy esp the cabbage which should have stayed naturally stayed a bit al-dente. The pork was suppose to be sliced in strips but were cut 90% down the way, so multiple strips stuck together. The dish is quite salty from the MSG, soy sauce, and oyster. So, if you're MSG sensitive like me, expect to get headaches soon after and make multiple trips to the water cooler throughout the day. The 5 crepes provided are cracking b/c they're so dry. They're thrown on top of the carton without wrapping it. :X\n\n*Beef Stew Wonton Noodle Soup: Awful! The beef stew was hard, dry, and flavorless. The wonton aka wrapped meatball was horrendous; the center was hard which was obvious it's been frozen for a LONG time. It was overcooked to the point the edges of the wrapper had sloughed off and intertwined with the overcooked, soggy noodles. And, the bok choy is also overcooked, mushy, and no longer a vibrant green color. The broth is MSG laden probably b/c it was made from beef bouillon cubes.\n\n*Steamed Chicken and Veggies (from Special Diet Menu): Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT order anything from their diet menu. The dish consists of several slices of white meat chicken and frozen veggies (carrots, snap peas, baby corn, bamboo shoots). The chicken is DRY and tasteless and the veggies are overcooked and mushy. They don't cook it in oil or season it, so it literally taste like rabbit food. If that's their interpretation of \"diet food\" no wonder 95% of diets FAIL.\n\nSERVICE: \nI've eaten here once and the waitresses are rude and inattentive which is why I've done To-Go orders thereafter. You have to ask them multiple times if you want something. But, worse of all, the waitresses speak in Canto about customers as if they don't understand. When my co-worker and I were sitting down waiting for the menus, another table had freed up, and one of the waitresses wanted us to automatically assume to know to move to that table. She then said in Canto, \"Those girls are stupid for not moving and wanting to sit in the middle table when they can have the corner one.\" WTF?!?!? How in the hell were we suppose to know she wanted us to move when she never asked? ESP??? I'm use to abuse in Asian restaurants, so although it slightly pissed by off, I quickly rubbed it off. However, they should really be mindful of what they say because you never know who will understand them. \n\nPerhaps, I should use my BB calendar more often, so I can avoid those \"Damn it\" moments where I have to resort to coming here...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-18", "description": "Usually, I look at incredibly generic Chinese restaurant names involving any combination of {Imperial, Panda, Garden, Palace, China, Wok, Bamboo, etc} to mean I'm going to get good Chinese food that isn't trying to be anything fancy.  Usually, such places deliver on their promise of flavorful and oftentimes greasy fare.\n\nSo I ordered the Shrimp with Peanuts in Garlic Sauce and the Hunan Crispy Beef, along with Spring Rolls.  The beef was ok, and there was lots of it, but none of the food was good.  The spring rolls had no flavor whatsoever.  Both entrees were listed as being spicy, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMaybe there are certain dishes to get, but unless some odd circumstances lead me back here, I won't be figuring out what those dishes are.", "author": "Joseph N."}

While the menus (not to mention decor) in these parts lack the authentic idiosyncracies that make their outer-city brethren so much more unique, it would be a mistake to assume that the chefs-manship is equally uniform.  And on this count, Shanghai China comes out on the winning side of the spectrum, at least when it comes to their BBQ Pork Chow Mein.

The \"Steamed Vegetarian Delight\" was probably not steamed, but heated in a plastic cooking machine because you could distinctly catch the plastic after-taste.  \n\n2)  The \"Crispy Orange Chicken\" was orange, but not crispy.  This is probably why they changed the name recently to \"Orange-Flavored Chicken\".\n\nThe Good\n\n1)  The \"Szechuan Style Bean Curd\" was the only good surprise because it was what it was supposed to be.

It's a solid, consistent place for lunch if you find what you like best and order that mostly.  On the odd occasion I've ventured away from my regular order I haven't  really liked it.  But that said, if you order what you enjoy it's a good value, service pretty quick and no frills.  It doesn't get overly crowded and I don't trip about the service (if it's dour or brusque) as long as I'm in and out promptly and food was good which it is almost always.  I've been going there for years and I know they recognize me by now but it's always the same almost indifference (although personally I've never had a problem with the service or staff), but I don't care cuz I'm not there to make friends.  If I got lousy inconsistent service and food, I wouldn't go back to any restaurant and I wouldn't expect anyone would want to, either.  So I don't and I do keep returning to this place because it's consistent and good in my book if nothing else.  I almost exclusively order the beef or shrimp scrambled egg over rice or over chow fun noodles...always great and sooo filling and done just right.  They include soup and an egg roll with lunch with almost too much rice and the price is good (nothing over $6).  The friends I go with consistently enjoy the sesame beef, eggplant with shrimp, shrimp with lobster sauce and tomato chow mein, and everyone's been happy with their choices.  This may not be the best Chinese restaurant but it's good if you find and stick with what you like.  For that, I give it 4 stars.", "author": "Mimi L."}
