{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-04", "description": "When my bf suggested going to Fat Angel, I didn't jump on the idea because I probably subconsciously thought it implied something about myself. Fast forward two years, and my friends and I are wandering about Pac Heights and I suggest Fat Angel. We snagged the last table, I received compliments for my recommendation, and my response was that it was actually my bf's rec. Moral of the story: Don't take restaurant names too seriously, and listen to recommendations by your SO. \n\nThe alcoholic menu is extensive and overwhelming, in a good way. They have amazing wine and beer selections from all over the world. It's somewhat pricier, but they also have less expensive options for the rest of us peasants. The cocktail menu is short but intriguing, with a beer or wine base. There is a list of rotating draft beer and wine as well.\n\n(+) We started off with a cheese and charcuterie board ($16 + $18 for 3 meats and 3 cheeses). It was beautifully laid out, with little dabs of spicy nuts, jams, honey, and whole grain mustard to mix it up.\n- Brie was quite standard and the piece was small\n- Pecorino and machego were good, not too strong but subtle\n- Finocchio was like a fatty salami. Tasty, but may not be the best if you're on a diet\n- The spicy prosciutto spread was more like a meat jam, and was also a somewhat small quantity. If you are craving something prosciutto-y, I suggest the speck or the bresaola. Tastes deliciously cured\n- The bread came in a paper bag on the side. Would have liked it on a board for Instagram purposes, and in fact I think it comes on the same board if you don't order as much stuff for your board\n\n(++) The tomato, spicy sausage, arugula, and Parmesan flatbread ($15) turned out more impressive than your standard flatbread. The bread is so miraculously thin it's almost like eating a cracker with a myriad of toppings with contrasting flavors. I bet this is what pizza tastes like in heaven for fat angels (....get it?)\n\n(+++) We got their popular FA chicken pot pie ($14). I'm not sure if I've ever had fancy chicken pot pie (I can only think of the frozen ones from my childhood and that my roommate in college used to microwave). But FA has created quite a gastropub-worthy version with roasted chicken and assorted veggies, spiked with sherry and tarragon, and topped with a flaky puff pastry. It's savory and herby, with contrasting textures, a tad of creaminess without being too heavy, and a bit of nostalgia.\n\nThe server was helpful in her suggestions for the charcuterie board, never rushed us (even though we were taking a long time chatting after dinner and there was a wait on the Friday), and split the check 3 ways for us. It totaled to slightly above $40 each, for a glass of wine and a lot of food.\n\nThe ambiance is vintage and cool: marble tables, a chandelier with a statement, and a small patio for better food lighting. FA is a place I would come back to, in order to try the different drinks and noms. Plus, their menu has variation and is printed daily. (at least until SF bans non-reusable menus)\n\nMy minor complaints are that my friend noticed a bit of lipstick stain left on her cup, and that there were little fruit flies including one that landed in my wine glass. Good thing I finished it quickly. \n\nOther tips:\n- Happy hour is 4-6pm weekdays, $1 off wine/beer and $2 off flatbreads\n- It's a short walk from Jtown and Social Study, so there are great options for more drinks/things to do afterwards\n- Not really great for large groups since it's fairly small. I'd say not to come with more than 6ish people\n- Other dishes that look amazing are the greens (it a huggggggeee  fluffy salad) and spicy mac n cheese (comes in a skillet, of course)\n\nFun fact: it's owned by the same group as Trestle, Stone's Throw, and Corridor, and it indeed has the same wow factor.", "author": "Edna C."}

I like how secluded it is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in this city. I finally decided to give it a try last night and was blown away!  Not because they are doing anything that is rocket science.  Mainly because the ambience and their simple menu (but very solid!!!) and extensive wine and beer list.  \n\nAmbience: What more could you want? Candle lit, very cozy.  Love the wood furnishings and bar.  There is a big stuffed buck on the wall when you walk in.  Makes one feel like they are going back to the shire after a long days hunt. LOL\n\nService: Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about the wine offerings when asked.  She recommended one wine and then went as far as coming back with the original recommendation as a sample as well as a revised recommendation she wanted us to try. Now that is service!  \n\nWine: Great selections. I had the Sauvignon Blanc and it was great! It packed a great punch as almost all CA wines should.\n\nFood: Simple offerings but very flavorful! The food came out fast and that had me worried for a little bit but after we took the first bites those fears were gone.  They really are good at what they do, do a few things and do them well.  I had the chicken pot pie. It was delish and a healthy portion (as well as the wine pours!) The pot pie actually had chicken in it! Not like the typical SF eatery where you're to fine 2 pieces of chicken in your chicken salad. There was a lot of chicken, and perfectly cooked veggies. Not soggy.  The caesar salad was also killer.  We ordered the roasted Chinese nuts with our wine and that was a great duo.  The nuts were not chinese though. ha!  Sadly, we were too full for dessert. next time!\n\nIf you're in the weekday slump, and not looking to cook or just want to go out for a simple yet delicious meal, come to fat angel. Bring your friends or family!  Will definitely be revisiting!", "author": "Dario L."}

Overall, Fat Angel does some things well and with some tweaking could be a great place to grab a drink in the neighborhood.\n\nThe good:\nThe space is super cute and when we arrived at 5:30, it was pretty empty. By the time we left around 7:30 it was packed. Definitely arrive early for a spot. The service here was also excellent and their staff gave great Recs. I really appreciated that they do tastings if you're not sure about a glass of wine. Great to try before committing to a full glass. \n\nThe food was also tasty though portions on the charcuterie board were laughable (more on that later). Wine selection was good but they seem to have much more beer here. Happy hour glasses were only $1 off so I ordered off the regular menu and tried the Sangiovese and Tempranillo (both great reds). I tried my friend's happy hour ro\u015be and it was really great-very refreshing.\n\nFor bites we ordered the flatbread with prosciutto, grapes and Gorgonzola. Really cracker thin crust (almost like matzo) but seriously good and $2 off for HH. The spicy mac and cheese was also one of my favorite things--I would come in again just for that!\n\nThe not so good:\nI initially thought Fat Angel would be a cozy spot to catch up with a friend but it's LOUD. I mean, scream across the table, leaning in, reading lips of your dining companion, loud. Definitely wouldn't recommend if you want to have a conversation. Very lively atmosphere though (I think the pandora station was either Madonna or Lady Gaga).\n\nWe were pretty disappointed with the portion size and accompaniments for the meat and cheese plate. Four thin slices of salami and a half-moon of cheese?!? The bread was okay but with Jane bakery in the nabe, I was hoping they served Jane bread with the board (They don't. It's firebrand bakery out of Oakland). \n\nLastly, I thought the price point was a bit high compared to similar wine bars in the city. When the bill came, it felt a little absurd to be paying $54+ each especially given we got there during happy hour.\n\nBetter happy hour specials would be great as well as fixing the portion sizes for the charcuterie board. Something on the walls to absorb the noise would also be nice.", "author": "Semuteh F."}

It's a small wine bar with a relaxing ambiance and chill vibes. They only serve beer and wine here, and although the list isn't huge there will probably be something for everyone. You won't have to worry about college kids tossing back Jaeger bombs either.\n\nOur group of 7 easily got a table in the evening on a weekday night and this restaurant is perfect for sharing food with friends and enjoying each other's company. The charcuterie plate along with cheese was perfect for sharing. My favorite food item on the menu here was the chicken pot pie; it was hot and juicy inside and nice and flaky on the outside. I'd probably pass on the pretzel plate next time, but if you want something \"bready\" then any of the flat breads would satisfy. \n\nThe service was top notch and everyone there really helped make our night wonderful.

Fat Angel is small but pretty busy establishment. The staff really great though, and even offered to let us order food at a side bar space and eat it there (despite no seats). We ended up ordering some drinks + food and took a seat in their small outdoor space while waiting for food. They turned on the outdoor heater and lights for us and it was so comfortable we just ended up hanging out there and just ordering any other items at the bar inside and bringing it out.  \n\nThey have a good variety of wines and beers to choose from. The Navarro Edelzwicker (white) was soooo goood for me (light and sweet). I think I could have sat there with friends having conversation all night with that glasses of that Navarro all night. It was so easy to sip on! The food came with lightening speed, which was great because we did have a hangry friend with us! The mac and cheese seemed to be a staple and there was also butter w/ bread, but from what I heard, it was a bit on the obscure side with hints of lemon (and capers?). It was interesting, but probably not to my friends palate! \n\nOverall, service was great, food was fast and decent and the space was just right for all our pre-concert needs!

It accompanies the meal well. \n\nThere is a great selection of food for any occasion whether you are looking for a snack to accompany your drink or trying to have a full meal. Obviously, I'm trying to have a full meal. The kale salad is SO good. It must be all the cheese that they put on it, making it so unhealthy but I get it every time. Note: it's bigger than the size of my head (definitely shareable). \n\nThe chicken pot pie is my friend's favorite. It has shredded chicken, the vegetable mix (peas, carrots, etc.) and two puff pastries. The sauce is thick and savory. I like to add a lot of pepper onto it. \n\nI've also gotten the mac and cheese, which is really rich. It's topped with breadcrumbs and put under the broiler.

When we arrived they told us that the kitchen closed in about half an hour, so we sat down and looked over the menu. We asked the server what her preferences and what was good and all she did was point at the menu items and told us what was in the dishes. With absolutely no input we decided to order the chicken pot pie, pretzel with mustard and cheese sauce, the flatbread with roasted grapes and goat cheese. The food was alright and I would have to say I have honestly had a lot better elsewhere.\n\nChicken Pot Pie - The first bite I took was from the center and the soup was cold in the center. The puff pastry they had on top was soggy from the top to the bottom. In that first bite I got a chicken bone. The flavor was decent and the veggies were cooked well.\n\nFlatbread - The flatbread itself was very thin and cracker like. There were areas where it was nice and crispy but then there were other areas where it was really soggy and all of the toppings just fell off. The grapes were probably the best part about the dish. They were seasoned well and had some really great flavors.\n\nPretzel - The shape and presentation of the pretzel was really bad, but it was probably the best tasting dish we had. It went great with the whole mustard. The cheese sauce was really think and broken and did not have a great texture.\n\nWe also ordered a glass of wine and beer. Our wine had some pieces of cork in it. With how service was going that night we decided to just take out the pieces and drink our drinks. Every time the server came by, it always felt like an inconvenience to her and that she had better things to do, even though we were 2 out of 6 people there that night.\n\nTo be honest, I would avoid coming here. There are very few places that I feel like I need to get away from, and this was one of them. I would not visit again unless the service gets better.", "author": "Camera P."}

My girlfriend got the glass of lambrusco. It was a bubbly red. As a fan of red wine, I ended up liking her glass more. Another friend joined us and he got the pimm's cup. It was refreshing, but it was a little too sweet for me.\n\nI'd love to come back for their food. I was actually tempted to order something to snack on while we were drinking, but I restrained since we were going to dinner.\n\nGreat place for wine. I will definitely be back to try their food.", "author": "Elena N."}

I got there a few minutes earlier than a friend and all the bar seats were taken, so I decided to sit by the window. The bartender called me over and told me I couldn't sit there unless I was eating dinner. Totally fair, except half the place was empty. So I told him I would immediately get up if he needed the chair. Surprisingly, he said \"no, can't do that.\"\n\nAfter a bit more back and forth with no real explanation of their \"rule\", and still in shock that I couldn't sit for a few minutes in a place that had plenty of open seating, I left and met my friend across the street at Sheba Piano Lounge where they were happy to have us.", "author": "Vinay A."}

If interested in food and drinks that borders on the unfamiliar, look somewhere else. The reason why I love Fat Angel is that it succeeds in what may quaint neighborhood jaunts fail to do: keep things simple and classy. Fat Angel serves up tastes and an ambiance that is comfortable and recognizable. This restaurant doesn't attempt to be something it's not.\n\nSince I discovered this place over a year ago, I visit the establishment about once per month. Of all San Francisco restaurants, this would be my most visited and the place I most often take friends for a light, casual dinner. My friends always leave commenting how much they are \"surprised\" by the food and ambiance of this hidden gem of a bar/restaurant. \n\nMy 'go-to' meal here is the Fat Angel Chicken Pot Pie, with roasted carrots, chicken, sherry and tarragon ($14). Their bread is less like a biscuit, more like a croissant. I think the light, flakey texture of bread choice is key for this dish. The contents themselves are thick and creamy, without leaving you stuffed. When I need to eat emotionally, I crave this chicken pot pie.\n\nSome other dishes I have tried that I have enjoyed greatly are the Spicy Mac N' Cheese, with gruy\u00e8re, cheddar and parmiggiano-reggiano ($12), the Baby Kale, minus bacon, marcona almonds and Parmesan ($12). \n\nAs for drinks, I encourage you to be adventurous and try something new every time. I am never disappointed. \n\nThe service here is impeccable. The bar and wait staff is a tightly-knit family. If you show your face here often enough, they'll recognize you, remember your tastes and give you recommendations for navigating their beer and wine lists. The team is also lightning fast at delivering your food, checking up on you, and bringing you the bill whenever ready. \n\nAs has been mentioned in other reviews, this place should be listed as a bar, not a restaurant. Think of it as a bar with bites on par. \n\nThere's limited seating here, with most tables set for two. Perfect for a date night; not ideal for a family dinner.", "author": "Kimberlee P."}

After coming here multiple times randomly over the last couple of years with my lady, I've honestly yet to experience anyone who is a genuinely friendly, warm or fuzzy personality. Whether it be bartenders or servers, everyone just has seemed a bit on edge or curt or gruff during our visits. At first I thought it was an anomaly but it's been more than a couple times now and it's really the one thing that's kept me from coming back regularly. Maybe they are really sweet and I'm just catching them on a bad day? Everytime? I dunno. I've tried to give the benefit of the doubt but they all seem really stressed to me for the most part. Also, I think their seating policy is a tad too uptight. I get that they have limited space, but in my experience, they will not seat you until your entire party has arrived regardless of if they're having a slow night. Every restaurant is different and I know this isn't a completely unique policy, but from a patron's perspective it can be frustrating and I'm merely recommending a little bit of flexibility. If 3 out of 4 people are present and hungry and ready to start spending our money at your establishment, why make us stand around?? This isn't really in one of the high traffic, tourist-dense areas of town. Admittedly, it's been a few months since I've been in so perhaps they've loosened up. Aside from that, they have great beer and wine options, nice ambience, a great outdoor seating space when the weather isn't too windy and some pretty yummy food offerings. I will say I'd like to see a few more menu options, however. Their choices seem a bit limited imho, but whatever. I have no idea how much kitchen space they have to work with. Willing to give another try sometime down the road but would probably be the last if the general vibe remains what it has been previously. We'll see.", "author": "Kareem C."}

We settled on a range of beers and cocktails and splurged on the sausage flatbread, the pretzel with cheese sauce, and the spicy mac & cheese.\n\nSuffice to say, the food was absolutely delicious and we came out pretty full and tipsy. \n\nA few observations to make note of: \n* watch the prices on the drinks. There's a wide range of beers and ciders that go from an easy $9 to well over $20 due to sizes and alcohol percent and it's easy to not notice.\n* spicy mac&cheese isn't really spicy. I'm super sensitive to heat and yeah... this was not spicy at all. \n* if you're careful on the drink costs, it's actually really decently priced overall (came to about $60 for the two of us and that was with two drinks apiece).\n\nWe'd definitely be happy to return for more samplings of food and drinks.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

It's a much smaller restaurant (seats maybe 30 people) and has an intimate vibe. We saw quite a few dates while we were there. Aside from the restaurant, there is also a bar located at the front if you just want to stop by for a drink or two.\n\nFood (5/5) To be completely honest, the sausage, tomato, and arugula flatbread that I ordered was probably one of the best flatbread that I have ever tasted. It had a thin crust and was topped with delicious spicy sausage. I should also mention that the flatbread is a very generous portion and I was able to take half of it home for tomorrow's breakfast (SCORE!). My friends also really loved the sliders, chicken pot pie, and mac and cheese.\n\nDrinks (4/5) The drink menu is quite large, but I was surprised that it cost me $13 for a 12oz bottled beer...I mean I love me some good beer but that is a hefty price for something I can buy in the store.\n\nOverall I'd say the food was awesome and the beer was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "I figured I should write a more comprehensive review for fat angel considering it's one if my favorite spots. This place is what a gastro pub should be. Great beer and wine selection and delicious consistent food. It is quite small and very popular.  The combination of small and popular is actually the major drawback of the place.  They do not take reservations so wait times can be upwards of 1-2 hours at times if you want a table for dinner.  You can put your name on a list and they will text you when a table becomes available, but this system may not be ideal for some. Also considering that some people order food and then sit at tables for hours drinking after dinner makes it difficult for the staff to accurately predict wait times.  Also since they have outdoor seating, weather becomes a variable in that on nice days their seating capacity almost doubles.  \n\nThe staff is always very friendly and do their best to accommodate given the limitations listed above.  They are understandably in a tricky situation and there is no great way to make everyone happy!  \n\nWhen you walk in there is a chalkboard that lists the beer and wine on tap. This is an ever changing selection which is great. Occasionally they run out of beers and the selection of tap beer can be limited. They make up for this with a huge selection of bottled beers listed by type in their menu. \n\nJust about everything on the food menu is awesome. My favorites are the maple bacon butter, kale salad with chicken, all of the flat breads, and the sliders. These all seem to pair perfectly with the beer.", "author": "Paul W."}

But it took about 20 min until someone acknowledged us (only about 3 ladies were working). We were able to sample some of the wines before we decided on what glass to take. The server was super friendly and knowledgable. I noticed it's the same price to drink wines by the glass versus buying a bottle, so it allows you to try multiple kinds! And the pours are generous! \n\nFor food we ordered the wild mushroom flatbread with truffle oil and a salad and added rotisserie chicken for $3. \n\nThe endive salad was a hefty portion! I do wish there was a bit more chicken throughout, but it was tender and flavorful. I enjoyed that it wasn't overly done, but bf found it to be too sweet for his tastes. \n\nThe flatbread was delicious as well!

You also have the option of exploring the neighboring stores and bars since you get a text letting you know when your table is ready.\nOnce seated, we ordered a few of the items that were recommended by other reviewers - the maple bacon butter, spicy sausage flatbread, and chicken pot pie.  I would say the flatbread was my favorite, it had a good combination of ingredients.  Unfortunately, the chicken pot pie had some flavor in there that tasted cherry-like which I didn't really appreciate that permeated the whole dish.

Like a good Yelper, I observed from Yelp friends' check-ins that Fat Angel was/is the place to go. I've walked by it many times especially on Saturdays when the Fillmore Farmers' Market takes place. Now I know what all the rage is about. It's low key, the food is good, and the patrons are locals. Not that this place needs another glowing review (as there are many already), but here are my two cents.\n\nI walked in promptly at 7 on Sunday night to join some friends for dinner. They've been here before and agreed to my recommendation. Clearly, they were also happy former patrons. One of my friends noted their wine selection is among the best, and I saw that as well. They have an extensive wine menu... but I wasn't there for wine. I was there for other libations. So, I ordered the Pimm's Cup: lemonade, Pimms #1, and cava. This came with plenty of ice (which I personally enjoy). Very refreshing, and had just enough bite and alcoholic \"zing!\" for a Sunday evening. \n\nWe decided to share a charcuterie platter which was, no doubt, a fantastic idea. The prime selection of meats and cheeses came with spiced and candied nuts, various jams, and mustard. Loved it. Oh, and duh! It came with copious amounts of bread. How could I forget THAT?! \n\nWe also shared the endive, apple, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola salad with roasted chicken shreds (+$3). This was a delicious and heaping amount of greens and fruit, and very much needed with all the meats and cheeses we were consuming! And well, did I mention we needed salad to also balance the very decadent mac & cheese? That mac & cheese: I want to just lift that hot plate and put it right onto my face. It consisted of three cheeses: gruyere, cheddar, and parmigiano-reggiano. The bread crumbs on top and the spice of cayenne pepper really made this mac & cheese distinctive from others. Granted, I've had bread crumbs on mac & cheese before, but this was toasted to perfection and the spice cut through the creamy richness of the dish. \n\nThe service: solid. The servers were friendly and quite personable. While my friends and I were very much engaged in deep conversations (at one point we were talking about economics... I mean, who does that on a Sunday night?... [We do.]), I noticed how efficient and attentive the service was. I'm glad I was able to experience a meal at Fat Angel. I intend to come back for dinner or perhaps a casual drink on their petite patio out front. Give this spot a try. It's heavenly! (Womp. Womp.)", "author": "James Z."}

Every night I was shaken down by mafia-governement workers, threatening to revoke my health permit unless I give them a cut of my profits. It was a beautiful place, very dark with a brown and mahogany color scheme. This was before the whole lodge thing was en vogue. I'd like to think that my dreamscape is ahead of the times.\n\nFat Angel kind of looks like the place in my dreams, but it's lighter, better decorated, and just cooler, without being too cool. There are animals overhead, a pipe organ, a beautiful bar, and, in contrast to my dingy and dreary nightmare, it's light filled and sunny-even if the streets are shrouded in fog. \n\nI could see myself here on the regular. Wine on tap-in particular a robust Pinot. There are beers for people who speak of Trappist monks and hidden abbeys-special brews from round the world of which I know nothing, but whose stories are told by the lips of those who know. The food is warm, and stands alone from the libations. When a patron ordered a bread pudding, the whole place smelled wonderful. I like places that are small enough that you are attune to what others are enjoying. Fat Angel passes that test.

It is right off of Fillmore, it is a great spot if you are in the neighborhood. I've been going for about four years, and every time I go I find another great menu item. Mind you the menu is only one page (we aren't talking Cheesecake Factory selections) so hard to believe that I haven't tried it all. But on my last visit I discovered the Chicken Pot Pie. Divine! It may have been my first time trying it, but it certainly won't be my last. It is an open bowl of Chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and the perfect amount of gravy and spices with a nice layer of buttery, flakey crust on the bottom and backed to perfection on the top. Man, I want to go back today just to try it again. It is almost sweet (in a good way) so I do recommend sprinkling with salt and pepper. \n\nThey always have a kick bootie beer selection. And definitely keep them on the radar during sf beer week. Every evening they have a different delicious offering. I sampled five great Paradox beers and on another night 5 Bruery beers poured from bottles. (They had fifteen hard to find beers to choose from, so I had to narrow it down to one sample of five.)\n\nOur fall back food options have always been the bread with flavored butters. The most recent flavors were Bernaise, Chive, Chili, Maple Bacon and Molasses. You can try one for $5.50, three for $15 or all five for I think $25. That is a lot of butter, but I did feel compelled to try them all once and take home the left overs. This last time the Bernaise butter was my favorite. Delish.\n\nWe also love their flatbreads, toppings change seasonally. Most recently we tried the butternut squash and kale. Perfect!\n\nAnd the mac n cheese, is great. Has a tangy hardier taste with the perfect amount of sauce to crunch ratio.\n\nSometimes the prices can get a little steep if you don't pay attention when ordering, you think it may be a quick bite of food and a beer from your local gastropub, and next thing you know your tab is $90. But you can't blame them for having too many awesome things to order! \n\nI would like to have cold ice water, luke warm water is the worst. And a few veggie sides and sweet options. But this place is a great go to spot.", "author": "Victoria O."}

However, when it comes to establishments that do it well (and consistently), I am a creature of habit. \n\nFat Angel does not have an extensive menu, but what they do have is a well-balanced selection of basics. The outlined food categories nicely fit one page... and it covers the necessities: Appetizers (Angel's Share), Cheese, Meat, Butter, Greens, Flatbread, Plates. The kale salad is unmatched - marcona almonds,  bacon, and the right touch of champagne dressing. No arguments about the chicken pot pie, as it is exactly how I envision a perfect savory pie to be (probably used a cup full of butter to have reached said perfection, but who's caring?). The spicy mac/cheese is pure bliss on a mini skillet. Still want more, you say? The Grape/Gorgonzola/Prosciutto flatbread is the way to go.\n\nAre you judging my diet yet? Did you miss the part about me crushing on a salad? \n\nOh the beers. Amazing beers on tap that rotate frequently based on season and featured microbrews. Some of the best variety offered in SF, but you end up liking one - drink up, as chances are that beer will be gone in 2 days and it may be while until they get another limited batch. They also have an excellent selection of bottled beers that covers a range of palates. Wine on tap more your groove? I've only tried the Sauvignon Blanc (Martella?) and Pinot Noir (Copain), both decent, but in a place like Fat Angel - with all the beer selections and so little time? Go for the brew. \n\nThe staff knows their stuff. Friendly, fun, and - I'll emphasize this - patient. You in need of figuring out what kind to get, given the otherwise intimidating selection? Engage them in conversation, and they'll make several recommendations (armed with samples)... after which you complete your selection and indulge happily. Let this be a lesson to other establishments: It pays to have a crew who is knowledgeable and passionate about the very things the place stands for. Need I spell out why? Because they generate fans who, not only (willingly) shell out $XX regularly for food and drinks, but ones who give gratitude over a public space like Yelp - even at the risk of getting a longer wait for a table on a Friday night.", "author": "Cham M."}

We ordered the sausage flatbread, the endive salad and the smoked trout with greens. My mom also ordered a coffee which was freshly made, one cup at a time. It was delicious!\n\nThe food didn't take long to come out but at first we thought they had forgotten to give us the additional chicken we ordered for the endive salad. They didn't forget, they just brought it out later so no problem there. I really enjoyed the sausage flatbread because the bread was really thin and the arugula went really well with the sausage and tomato. I think I ate about half of it by myself lol. The endive salad was pretty good but I wouldn't recommend ordering the chicken as a side, because it was pretty dry. The trout on the other hand was very tasty, and the greens were delicious.\n\nWe didn't order any drinks (aside from the coffee), so I can't comment on that except for the fact that 75% of the menu encompassed libations which was interesting.

The focus here is mostly on the libations part... Obviously from the name :) The food is pretty good though (just a bit on the expensive side for what you get). Even though it is pricey, it's worth it to get a couple of the small plates (especially the meats and cheeses) since it pairs really well with the drinks. Also, keep in mind, the menu changes every now and then, so it's kind of a different experience (at least from the two times I've been there).\n\nThey have a bunch of beers on tap and a vast selection of wine and bottled beer. They have everything from cheap to like... almost $72 for a bottle of beer (didn't really pay attention to the wines because we weren't really there for wine). The second time I've went here, we had just gotten out of a very beery brunch at 21st Amendment, so we didn't really order much alcohol; only Drake's 2013 Jolly Rodger Imperial American Black Ale (how awesome is that name). It was the last bottle though... but damn that was good. Highly recommend it... if you can find it somewhere else XD\n\nWe ordered the lemon caper sage butter (maple bacon is better), sliders (meh), mac and cheese (yum!), and a meat plate with salchichon, two slices of duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 ('cause we're so fancy), speck, duck salami, and truffled wild boar. The meat plate was definitely better this time around (don't remember the last one we had), and you get a brown bag filled to the brim with bread (which is crazy yummy). The meat plate also comes with a great mustard which brings it all together. Would definitely avoid the sliders though... came out a little soggy... and honestly not very unique/flavorful. The mac and cheese comes in a tiny little cast iron with these awesome breadcrumbs on top.\n\nI like this place for the random selection and the chill atmosphere. Luckily the second time we went, it was waaaaaaaaaaay quieter (we were the only ones in the resturant, minus some of the tables outside) and it was great to hang out with a couple friends. It did start to fill up a little bit by 6 pm (halfish full) but by then we were pretty sated and happy.\n\nWould come back, would recommend, but really the attraction here is the drink!

I had read in reviews that getting a table could take a while so my wife and I arrived a little before the dinner rush, around 5:45, and got to take our pick of several open tables. I should mention that when we left about an hour later all the tables were taken and there was a short line at the door of people waiting for a table to open up. \n\nThe vibe of the place when we first arrived very different than when we left....\nIf you want to avoid a wait, get there early but don't be surprised if it feels a little like you're eating in a library until it fills up. If you don't want to feel like the loudest person in the place, arrive when it's full and it'll feel more fun, making the atmospheric difference alone worth the wait.\n\nThe food at Fat Angel is good, but definitely an after thought. The menu is ten pages of alcoholic beverages and a page at the end of food. We had the pot pies and Caesar salad, one of only two entrees they offer (the other being mac and cheese) and both of were very good. The downside to the small menu is there's a good chance they wouldn't have anything you'd like.

It was soft, seamlessly smooth and juicy with vibrant berry and aromatic floral tones. It trumps my favorite (now former) 2007 Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon at Press Club ($27.50/glass). For someone that needs 6-8 shots of Goose to get a good buzz, two glasses were enough to give me the giggles.

Like, what type of product does a place called Fat Angel serve?\nSince I've recently become a developing bourbon connoisseur, now whenever I think of angels and a gastropub, I think of \"angel's share\" which is a term that describes the evaporated liquid of processing bourbon in a barrel (before it's ultimately bottled after however long it stays in a barrel). Because of this knowledge, I thought this might be a bourbon joint. It's actually a wine bar.\n\nThis is a small joint that doesn't get crowded right away, but usually does about an hour and a half into the restaurants opening. So, if you can't get a table at State Bird Provisions around the corner, this is an alternative for some people who want to eat ASAP.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese is amazing. The crumbs on top make the dish 3 times better. This is the only dish of food I tried. The other dishes on the menu sounded amazing though.\n\nThe drinks are expensive so don't binge here (a beer might cost you $10). I ordered this one sour bourbon beer and it clearly said it was $8 on the chalkboard but the bartender charged me $10.

Also, with SF weather, bring either a jacket and sit outside (much shorter wait time, and they have heat lamps), or wait longer for the inside tables. It's a tiny space so waits can me 1.5-2 hours long depending on party size.\n\nWe started off with fried capers. These were interesting -- deep fried, so the insides were hollow, and the outsides were crunchy. It was delicious, but super salty (capers, duh).\n\nNext, we noshed on the chocolate cinnamon butter. This was served with a great rye bread, and was so delicious. Like cinnamoney-nutella. Spread like butter, and was soft.\n\nThen we had 2 flatbreads: (1) Roasted red grape, walnut, & prosciutto w/ Gorgonzola, which was lovely. The roasted grapes are a favorite thing of mine that not many places do. It adds a hint of sweet to something that feels savory. It's great. (2) Wild mushroom and white truffle oil w/pecorino. This was also delicious, and better than the roasted red grape flatbread. Both flatbreads were super thin -- think nacho chip with pizza-like toppings. Very tasty and not too heavy.\n\nThen we had the Mac n'cheese - gruyere, cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano, cayenne. Was a nice, homey mac and cheese. The Fa's chicken pot pie - roast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon - was also super homey. The toasted filo dough on top was a great touch, which you break into pieces and eat with the insides of the pot pie.\n\nFinally we had a great cheese board, which our server picked.

Not too doughy since the crust isn't completely surrounding the pie.\n\nBurger Sliders -- My favorite thing here! Juicy meat with some amazing aioli. Also goes great with the pickled jalapenos which are served on the side.\n\nMac n' Cheese - Cheesy with a kick. The heat seems to linger for awhile, but it is so good.\n\nFlat Breads - Extremely thin crust! Thin and crispy!\n\nGreat place to grab some beers and delicious food. My only complaint is that the restaurant is really small, so sometimes the wait can be long.", "author": "Richard P."}

Noticing that they were a gastropub with a fine beer list made the choice easy for me.\n\nAfter parking nearby with my friend P, we made a beeline here to quench our thirst and grab a bite. Unfortunately, there was a small crowd of people jamming the doorway and we thought we might be out of luck. After all, the place is really tiny. \n\nUndaunted, we squeezed through to the bar to find several open spaces. I guess everyone really wanted a table.  We didn't.\n\nThe draft beer list here (written on chalkboard) was FANTASTIC: all microbrews, including two IPAs, a golden ale, a porter, a weiss beer, a brown ale. a double IPA and even a sour beer.  The bottle list was much longer; The waiter said the total count was over 100!  So many choices that we couldn't decide, and so we left. (yeah right)\n\nThe menu was short but we found what we wanted quickly: sliders for me, and chicken pot pie for my buddy P.  Unfortunately, it took about 15 mins to get someone to take our orders. (Staff was very thin.) At least we had tasty beers in front of us and some time to examine the cool decor, including the large glass chandelier (echoes of the nearby Fillmore?) and the back of the bar, which appeared to be made out of an old church organ...pretty Cool actually.\n\nOnce we ordered, the food arrived quickly. We both enjoyed our meals and our second, tasty brew.  The night was off to a good start.  By the time we paid up and left, the outside crowd had doubled, and even bar seats were in demand. We were glad we had arrived when we did.\n\n5 stars for the perfect pre-show dinner and excellent beer selection; 1 star off for the spotty service.", "author": "Dan B."}

A patron who was holding a few seats let us take them (we asked a few times to make sure it was okay), the stools are made of old tractor wheels!  \nThe ambiance/decor was great, a rustic, vintage, watering hole that would seem to be popular in the days of Billy the Kid but with a modern flare and elegant features.  Not only were the stools made of old wheels but the bar was an old organ, the bathroom had a very nice style to it and it smelled pretty darn good (especially for the area around the Fillmore), and there is a gorgeous chandelier casting a dim light over the room.\nWe each had a few wines on tap and each of the bartenders were pretty friendly.  The wine was quite delicious and I got a Sav Blac, it was surprising to me that I didn't change to a red since I'm not a white wine lover.  They also had bottled beer and cider (Crispin the Saint was an option), plus tap.\nOverall, I would come back here in a heartbeat, especially if I am headed to the Fillmore- the food seemed divine, the drinks were great, and the service was splendid.  If they take reservations I suggest you make one, we were here on Thanksgiving's Eve and it was at about 80% capacity.", "author": "Sara N."}

We ordered, among other things, the sliders. We were disappointed by them: The patty was small compared to the bun, overcooked and the sauce wasn't very good. We each had one and left the third one untouched. I told the waiter that we had a nice meal that was let down by the sliders. There comes the weird part. The waiter became very defensive and started offering a partial refund of the sliders. His argument was that we ate two and left one, so he could refund us 33% of the sliders. WTF is this? I didn't ask for any refund and was not expecting one. But offering a refund of 33% of $10 is just a joke. I told him so, and he went to talk to his manager. He came back and told us that we will be completely refunded.\n\nSo, decent food (overall) and good beverages, but terrible service.", "author": "Benoit T."}

We wandered until we realized we had 30m until Fat Angel opened, so we sat and waited, so SF.\n\n\nCut to 5m before 4, and the waitress on staff comes out to set up the outdoor seating area, and lets us know she is the only one working at the time.

The waitress and her barback are running around, taking everyone's orders - it was so fluid and efficient. She did a wonderful job and the staff (of two, haha) was attentive and quick. \n\nWe had our drink and appetizer about 15m after being seated, and by the time we were done with our appetizer (pretzel and garlic chili butter YUM!) she came around and took our dinner order. \n\nI got the pot pie, which was amazing, and my husband got the grape flatbread - delicious. I ordered a lavender/black currant cider, which I cannot stop raving about. It was sweet and light, I kept thinking it was a sangria.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-11", "description": "Quiet possibly the greatest place to take a date in the city. Edit for hyperbole but you get the idea. This has to be one of my favorite places in the city and had to give them a proper yelp review finally. The combination of atmosphere, cost, quality of food and drinks make it a no brainier five star that anyone venturing in the Fillmore area should try.\n\nThe highlight of Fat Angel for me is the food. It is a relatively small menu but everything on it is worth taking a shot at. The areas they excel in are the salads and the flat-breads. I had never encountered this combination of flavors before I came here and was shocked they could get such quality food to come out of that small kitchen. \n\nSeriously all four salads are delicious. My personal favorites being the kale salad and the endive salad. Also the portions on the salads are HUGE. They should be shared by two people and shouldn't even be attempted by one person. They aren't expensive and will fill you up. The Flat breads are even better. Every time I look at the menu I want to try something else but I always, always get the roasted red grape and walnut flat bread. It is just so savory and a perfect combination of sweet and salty. I rely on my date to order one of the others so I can at least try it but it is a halfhearted attempt at best. \n\nAnother positive is the service time. The turnaround on food is one of the best I have had in the city and the quality is always consistent. Shout out to whoever is back there whipping up the food.\n\nBy this time you are completely full and realize you haven't even gotten to the main dishes. I have had the sliders and the mac and cheese which are both great as well. The mac and cheese is very spicy so be forewarned if you aren't used to that. \n\nThis place also holds its own as a bar as well. There is a stuff drink menu with plenty of options for the beer aficionados. The wine is pretty varied as well but may not satisfy the wine heads of SF. \n\nThe customer service is great at Fat Angel as well. With easy pay at the bar and personally calling you when your table is ready are great perks. \n\nAlso full disclosure I am in love with the bartender/waitress.I don't know her name but she has short hair and tattoos and is the woman of my dreams.  I am sure she is married or taken but I am professing my love for her here. \n\nThe negatives that could knock off some stars for others are just how small Fat Angel is. It is a really tiny and intimate place and can get crowded on most nights by around 8 or 9pm. I am talking standing room only at the bar and freezing your butt off by choosing to sit at the outside tables because nothing is available inside. Be prepared for a wait time but its never too long. Also the small place leads to some really really close table set ups. You are in the other couples conversation no matter what so be prepared for people watching as you will be two inches from someone else. \n\nFat Angel may have an odd name but as one of my first introductions to social life in SF I couldn't have had a better experience. The service has not dipped in the three years I have been in SF and I would venture to say it won't when you make your way out there as well. \n\nFillmore has a gem that serves a perfect wine and candlelight home with food that leaves you coming back for more. Also if you know the waitress tell her she is awesome and has a fan club. This is the place I suggest whenever dinner is up to me so I am sure I will see you there.", "author": "Nick R."}

So I was sad, called all the people I needed to call to report everything, taped it up, and then needed something to calm me down and lift my spirits. \n\nA friend had told me he'd had a really nice evening at Fat Angel the other weekend, so I made my way over and snuggled up to the bar. I was one of those annoying people who wasn't sure whether I wanted a draft Syrah or draft Stout, so I made the bartender help me figure it out. Star #1 is for the fact that they had both draft Syrah and 2 stouts (among other fantastic drink options), and Star #2 is for the sweet bartender who was patient enough to help me find my way to a fantastic stout that hit the spot.\n\nWanting to eat my feelings -- but just a little -- I then made the bartender help me decide between a cheese plate and a butter plate. I went with the Chocolate Cinnamon butter with toasted bread, which earned Star #3 because it. was. perfection.\n\nStar #4 is for the ambience. I felt totally comfortable writing birthday cards to family and friends while sitting at the bar with my stout and butter. Laid back, not too pretentious -- unless you were one of the fancy pretentious people there, then I guess it could be your scene, too. What I'm saying is, the place is as fancy or low-key as you wanna make it, which I really appreciated.\n\nStar #5 is because I left so happy that I almost forgot about my busted window.", "author": "Theresa P."}

The atmosphere is great and cozy, the service is good and their menu looks really appetizing. \nHowever, I have subtracted two stars because of the food. We ordered the baby kale salad and the prosciutto flatbread which looked very promising. Th salad was drenched in dressing which made it very salty and heavy. The next dish - the flatbread was even worse. The cheese was definitely the main ingredient and it was so much that you can hardly taste the bread or any of the other ingredients. If you are a relatively healthy eater like me, I wouldn't recommend the place.\nThe only reason I would return to to the Fat Angel is for a drink - its still a pretty nice place for a glass of wine or beer.", "author": "Mirela S."}

Walked right in with a friend of mine around 7pm.  Nice dark and intimate atmosphere; perfect for a date, or catching up with an old friend.  \n\nI'll cut right to the chase. Here's what we ordered...\n\n-House Olives $4\nSimple marinade of olive oil and maybe garlic. No variety, only the green olives not pitted. Where my Kalamata's at?! Got very redundant, needed more herbs. \n\n-Maple bacon butter w/ bread $4.50\nSome wheat bread and maple bacon butter. Maple Bacon butter was interesting. Overall meh.

Bun was soft, bacon, caramelized onions, aioli. Came together so nicely, best slider I have ever had, hands down.    \n\n-3 cured meats ( duck salami, speck, chorizo)  $15. \nDuck salami was melt in your mouth, chorizo was a bit oily, but the mustard and bread countered it nicely. Had to ask for more mustard, they only give you a small half dollar sized dollop. Tons of those little baguettes.  This was perfect. \n\nhttp://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ki2pbk7yjAcndoxGFaDo0Q/l.jpg\n\nConclusion: We ordered a lot, since it was our first time, we wanted to get a taste of everything.  Next time I come back, which will be very soon, i'm going to order the sliders, 3 meats and a few beers.  Skip the apps, olives, bread, go straight for the good stuff! \n\nTotal was $58.05 for two, before tax.  Quite reasonable, given how much we ordered.

A friend and I had been searching for another wine bar, but when we couldn't find it, we stumbled upon this one instead. The selection of beers was very impressive, but what caught my eye - and captured my heart - was the fact they have WINE ON TAP. Let me repeat that again.. Fat Angel has WINE ON TAP. I thought draft wine only existed in my version of heaven.\n\nAnyway, we had to wait quite a long time to be seated, which is perhaps the only downside. It was a Wednesday night. It was around 8. And it was packed. Just elbowing our way to the bar to put our names on the waiting list was tricky. We must have been lucky to arrive at exactly the same time as everyone else, because by the time we were seated (well over an hour later) it was no longer so crowded. But they have WINE ON TAP, so I was content. As for the food, we ordered the 3 cheese plate, the chorizo meat plate, the asparagus flatbread and the sliders. Being generally gluten free, I passed on the breads that arrived with our cheeses and meat, and the kitchen was (kindly) able to serve my sliders with lettuce instead of buns. Everything I ate was super tasty, and my friend enjoyed his flatbread too.\n\nJust about everything here was fab; the decor was fun, the bar staff friendly, the servers attentive, the food yummy, the drinks flowing.

Sort of works for the vibe of the restaurant, just don't plan to have any intimate conversations here as you'll have to talk fairly loudly for your friends/date to hear.\n\nWe ordered the mac & cheese (yum), chicken pot pie (my choice favorite of the night), endive salad (delightfully huge portions), prosciutto flatbread (meh, kind of small and not filling but it'lll be hard to resist ordering one so my review probably won't mean anything to someone who's read this far), and a single cheese (this was the first item to come out and it's safe to say everyone in my group was disappointed at the size of the cheese and the bread). Personally, I was thinking that for $5 I could buy a huge block of muenster cheese and be pretty happy with that.\n\nOverall, it was a nice place to try but I wasn't made into a regular.

It's small, so be prepared to wait on a busy night.  The decor and ambiance is great for a romantic date (after dinner or even before for light snacks and drinks), and it's great for a few friends just to hang out.  Completely low key but uber chic and cute.\n\nThe drink list is super intense, and quite extensive. It takes some time to navigate it.  i saw other people eating salads and they were huge. We got the mushroom flat bread which was completely divine. The mushrooms were fresh and so fragrant. There was the right amount of cheese just to give the salty and nutty taste.  We also got the sliders which I am still dreaming and drooling over.  They were the best sliders I've ever had. They were juicy and fresh. Love it!", "author": "Vanessa K."}

Sweet, darling Fat Angel, will you marry me?\n\nThe wine on tap thing is a novelty that some bars will make you pay dearly for. Fat Angel offers up an affordable full glass. Never say cheap. I need not go on about the bread and butter you should order. By the way, I never *ever* say you should order bread and butter. In fact, I would normally never say the bread and butter that is given to you gratis in most restaurants is something worth filling up on. So, trust me on this one. \n\nWhat really made this place for me, though, is the hospitality. The place was packed and I walked in with a rather large group that would have flustered the best of 'tenders. I shockingly embarrassed myself (/sarcasm) by leaning on the wall and making the lights go from kindly dim to harsh and bright... I know, I know, how dare I? The lady bartender fixed the problem without issue (if it were me, I can't deny there'd be some snark involved). By the way, this same bartender told us that we were a beautify group. \n\nI might add that this was *after* the brightening incident. \n\nFat Angel, you are, so so very fat...if by \"fat\" you mean generous in spirit.", "author": "Joi B."}

I was out with my BF and wanted to take him out to dinner.  I wanted to try the food at FA but the stuff prevented that from happening. \n\nOMG, confusion and chaos. There where only 2 people handling the bar and tables. Serious mess, matter the fact, the male server said as much, he used the word confused.  We took 2 seats at the window and the same server questioned why we took those seat. We were standing for nearly 10mins, waiting for someone to smile and greet us but that never happened. As we began to walk out, we then caught the attention of the woman at the bar who asked, how many we said 2, she said take the window. Realizing that getting served was going to take some time, I got up and looked at the wine list on the wall hoping to get a bottle and chill a bit. That didn't happen. I stood reading the menu and was completely ignored. I tried to get the bar tenders attention, it never happened. I sat down, waited a bit more....we then decided to leave. \n\nBoth the bar tender and only the server were struggling, communicate was lacking.\n\n Restaurants have off nights, people have bad days.

We checked out the menu and it looked fabulous, and a quick look at Yelp showed us 4.5 stars overall.  We were sold. \n\nWhen we showed up at about 7:45pm on a Friday night, the place was PACKED.  Every seat in the house (even outside, where it was cold) was taken, and we put our name on the wait list.  We each ordered a glass of wine, and were seated before we finished them.  The staff seemed slightly overwhelmed by the number of people, but they did a good job of handled the chaos, were knowledgeable about the menu when we had questions, and overall we had a very pleasant dining experience.\n\nMy wine, a Syrah/Cab blend from N2, was delicious and complimented the food perfectly.  They also have a very unique and diverse beer selection, and I greatly enjoyed reading the humorous and informative descriptions on the menu.\n\nFood we ordered for 2 people, and left stuffed:\n- Smoked Trout Salad with Horseradish Vinaigrette: Could have used a few more pieces of trout, but was seriously good.  After devouring the salad, we had high hopes for the rest of the meal, and were not disappointed.\n\n- Flatbread with Gorgonzola, Grapes, Walnuts and Prosciutto: Super thing and crispy bread was just thick enough to support the deliciousness on top.  The combination of flavors was amazing.\n\n- Charcueterie of Duck Salami, Wild Boar Salami, and Sopressata (see picture): Served with warm thinly sliced bread and whole grain mustard, the meats were amazing.  We both agreed that the duck was the winner, but all were really good, and I thought about sneaking the mustard home with me, it was that good.  \n\nWe were too full to order dessert, but plan to come back soon and save room to try either the bread pudding or blueberry cobbler.

It helps to be friends with regulars, not going to lie, but even if we didn't have the inside scoop, I'd still like it here. \n\nThey've  got it all, unique beers, wine, and delicious food. Speaking of food, I feel that at this point that I've tried most of the menu and it's all delicious, but the real stand-out is the smoked trout salad. Jesus tap dancing Christ, that smoked trout is the most delicious fish ever. I want to buy a case of that smoked trout and eat it everyday. My fiend described that salad as \"an orgasm you don't have to work for\". It's that good and it's SALAD.\n\nMoving on....\n\nBeer selection is top notch and changes regularly as does the wine but I think they have certain bottles that are always on hand. The decor is pretty cool too, they have a lot of pews from an old church, which adds a naughty element as you indulge in booze and rich food. \n\nMy only criticism is that it gets really crowded and it can be hard to get a table as it's not a very large place. They do have some outdoor tables (with heat lamps) but it's nicer inside. They seem a little disorganized when it comes to seating as well, so if you don't want to wait around, I'd suggest coming early. Whatever though, I'd probably wait an hour for that trout salad. \n\n5 stars for the food, the drinks, and the fun I've had here \n3 stars for the organization/seating", "author": "Iska B."}

Trout salad excellent. But spent $13 for 3 small sliders with maybe 1/16 pound of meat on each, with the thin patties charred to toughness -- also came out bone cold.  $5 pretzel was overbaked and bland.

But as soon as we got inside - we were warmed up! Not too hot, just perfect! We got lucky! The house was full - but a minute after we arrived a couple had just left so we scored some good seats!\n\nI started off with the Riesling. A nice light fruity crisp wine. Yummy yummy. After 2 glasses I was definitely feeling warmer!\n\nWe ordered the Firebrand sourdough baguettes with cheese & meat. The platter came with spicy mustard, some fancy smancy jellies and sauces, and nuts. The server was so nice! I had no idea about the types of meats - I don't normally eat this type of food. But I'll definitely start! He gave us a break down of each type of meat, how it was seasoned and processed! \n\nWe went with:\nCHEESE: \nVella Dry Jack   hard cow\nRoaring Forties Blue   semi-soft cow\n\nMEAT:\nSalami\nHot Copa\n\nAND on top of that! The server felt bad because our plate was accidentally given to someone else (we didn't even feel the wait was that long). SO he hooked us up with another cheese and meat on the house!\n\nChorizo\nTruffle Tremor  soft goat\n\nThe Vella Dry Jack was my favorite! It was dry, but in a good way! The truffle tremor was good too! A bit strong, but very tasty! Especially paired with the yummy sauces  and the spices in the meats! I loved all the meat! It felt like so much food! But we ate pretty much all of it!\n\nI was planning on this being a starter, but I was so full! We ordered the chicken pot pie as our main entree - and as soon as we got the dish I had to make room for it. A different take on the traditional dish. It was served in a bowl - so it had the appearance of soup - with a square shaped crust placed on top. But with a nice surprise! As you eat the dish - you will find more crust on the bottom and sides of the bowl! The crust is my favorite part, so I was happy! Yummy chicken - thick soups full of veggies, carrots, sherry, & tarragon.\n\nOnce we were absolutely full we hung out. Finished our drinks. It was really nice. The setting was perfect! I wouldn't have wanted to spend my last night any other way. I wish we had one of these places in Hawaii. Great for intimate settings - or just to hang out and catch up with the friends. Warm, cozy, clean, nicely decorated. Part of the drop ceiling had beautiful copper tiles with chandeliers hanging from it. There were lots of different types of lighting, \nchandeliers, candles, track lighting: the combo of all of them spot on!\n\nI'll admit the drinks were a bit pricey.

I mean, you can't really go wrong with mushroom and truffle oil on anything, so the taste was definitely there. When the cheese hardens, however, it just tastes stale. Sidenote: I spread some duck liver mousse on it and it was incredible.\n\nPretzel: It was okay. I wish there was another sauce than mustard.\n\nCheese Plate w/ Duck Liver Mousse: The duck liver mousse was excellent. When spread upon the bread (or the flatbread), it gave me a faint glimpse of what I loved most about foie gras before the ban. \n\n--------------------\n\nFat Angel is an excellent joint for beer enthusiasts.

The place is small enough that it's intimate but without seeming exclusive, which is probably why it manufactures so many regulars.\n\nAnd of course, the drinks. Definitely the most extensive collection of craft beers I've ever seen: the menu had about 8 pages of beer and wine, one page of food, and then another page of wine. I wanted to try a beer from the Bruery but wasn't willing to splurge quite yet and opted instead for one from Pretty Things. I also tried a cheese plate and the smoked trout salad based on the reviews here and wasn't disappointed. \n\nDespite the quantity and deliciousness of the food, this is still a bar at heart, so it makes for an interesting inversion of your typical dinner.

I'm a big fan of bread puddings and this could possibly be the best I've ever had. There's speculation at our table that the bread in the pudding is actually (gasp...) donuts!! Regardless of what it was, we (or I) devoured it.\n\nWe also got the endive salad and the flatbread. The flatbread had great flavor and the ingredients married perfectly; the only suggestion that I would make would be use a focaccia or actual pizza dough instead of the almost cracker like \"flat bread\". We also enjoyed the salad. \n\nThe place was rather crowded and it took us around 45 minutes before we got a table. They really need to put some heat lamps outside and maybe a happy hour menu.

About a 20 minute wait (during which time, drinks were involved). It's a small place, and I think we got lucky on the timing - our wait time really wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe drinks are priced anywhere from the regular/affordable and up to a 'sky is the limit' deal - pick what you want. The selections were nice, something for everyone - check out their menu for more to choose from, not just the board.\n\nVery casual atmosphere, hip... all that good stuff - it is a small place, so we were almost elbow to elbow with the table next to us, not that it was a problem.\n\nAs food goes, we had the polenta fries (loved it), the maple bacon butter, some of the meat (I can't remember the name), a kale salad, and the mac and cheese - with a drink on the tab, we only came out to $50! If I was going to exclude anything, it would have been the meat - not that it was bad in any way, but the rest of the menu is what I'd suggest trying! It was simply the least memorable part of the meal. The salad in particular stood out for both of us - and an order of that is easily good for three people (we couldn't quite finish it with two of us). The mac & cheese was more on the order of 2 people, I think.\n\nAs someone mentioned, if it isn't too breezy that evening, consider bringing a jacket and sitting outside if you want to sit and eat quickly; that evening, I think only one group elected to sit outside, the rest of us waited for a spot inside!", "author": "Peter L."}

Still give it 4 stars so long as it's a nice night/day out and you're outside. Otherwise, the inside is pretty much just like any other crowded, loud bar.  Upon walking in, it took 7 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us or make eye contact.

Finally sit down, takes another couple of minutes for the waitress to get to us, though she was apologetic, which I can appreciate.  Our order came pretty quickly which was nice. But took us another 10 minutes to get our plates, napkins and knife.  As good as the cheese was, I still need a knife.  We had to ask multiple people to get our place settings.\n\nFinally when we're all settled in, trying to enjoy our food and libations, table next to us was just filled with loud obnoxious guys who seemed to want to have all their friends join them at a small 4-person table.  Their waiter was as eager to participate in this \"bumpin\" night as they were.

At nighttime, the whole park is lighten up by a blue LED light projected from the top of a marvelous building. The effect turns the park into a visionary scene from the movie Avatar. It's really quite beautiful.\n\nThe cute fat angel statue is hanging on the restaurant, smiling and waving to every incoming customer.\n\nAn interesting fact is that Fat Angel doesn't carry mainstream beers. My beer-drinker boyfriend had no idea what to order when there were strange beer brands from that stretched from England to the Netherlands and everywhere in-between. Finally, the owner recommended us to try an English bitter: Engels Brouwerij De Molen. The beer had a similar taste to my Alan's favorite beer, Blue Moon. Compared to Blue Moon, the body of Engels is a little bit lighter, but very smooth.\n\nA lot of previous customers of Fat Angel recommended the Chicken PotPie on yelp. I decided to give it a try for this first time visit, which I found to be quite an interesting dish indeed.\nFor the chicken potpie, the owner recommended me to pair the pie with a white or red wine with a light body. I craved for the red wine on this beautiful night, so I went with the glass of red to soothe my cravings. In the end, I decided to go with what the owner had suggested, a Grenache from Santa Cruz, CA, Birichino 'Vieilles Vignes.'  My, was it wonderful.\n\nAlthough the look of Fat Angel's chicken potpie was different from a traditional potpie, it still has the ability to fill up a gigantic stomach. My stomach was about to explode after I've barely finished a half of the potpie. All ladies have to be ready to ask their boyfriends to finish what is left from this gigantic dish! The powdery sauce was smooth, thick, pure, fresh and brisk. The Pot Pie and Grenache from Santa Cruz paired quite well with each other, but they where not perfect. I couldn't help but keep my mind stimulated by looking for another pairing to perfect this wine and potpie collaboration and  build a stronger relationship between the taste buds within my mouth.\n\nI will definitely go back to Fat Angel to give a second look at their well-known cheese served w/ organic Firebrand Bread and seasonal accents.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Nobe Z."}

No idea since he said not a word to me except to gasp that I dare try to get through the door while he juggled his, um, 3 tables outside. Life is so hard. \n\nI finally found my way through and waited for ANYONE to say hello to me. After about ten minutes I said something to the incredibly rude woman behind the bar. Oh, how dare I think I was getting a seat. Hilarious. I was allowed to stand in the two-foot by two-foot space right next to the door while I sipped my wine. It should be noted that the wine and beer selection are excellent so if you care nothing about your dignity and only your bo\u00eete, this is the place for you.\n \nThe night went on like that, laughably.

So, we went to Fat Angel since it was two blocks away. It was packed on a cold, dreary night. Nobody appeared to be hosting or seating people, so I made my way to an empty table and sat down. Not knowing if this was acceptable behavior at Fat Angel, I kind of went with it and went to town with the carbs. LOL.\n\nWe had the Pimm's cup and the Champagne cocktail for drinks. Neither of which were to die for. We then ordered the mac-n-cheese, chicken pot pie and sliders. The sliders had a good cook on them and were tasty. The chicken pot pie was yummy, but there wasn't enough crust and therefore, too much filling. The filling, however, did have a good amount of shredded chicken which I was glad they didn't skimp on. The mac-n-cheese was okay. It was served in a hot skillet which made scooping and serving the dish a bit difficult (there was no pan holder or hot glove to help in handling it). The Mister didn't take to the mac-n-cheese and said he could have made it himself. Although a fair assessment as far as difficulty of the dish, the Mister rarely cooks...yeah, go figure! Kettle meet pot. \n\nThe service at Fat Angel was good, but the envirnoment was too cramped for our style. Other table's conversations were bleeding into ours, coercing silence. I did get what I was in search of - a few mouth fulls of starchy carbs, but I do not think I would go back again. A gastropub probably isn't my cup of tea, but I am sure others had a wonderful time at this neighborhood joint.", "author": "Sean A."}

(Or a movie at The Clay, which is where I was headed.)\n\nI arrived at 6PM on a Friday by myself and got the last table.  They had a nice Happy Hour for \"draft\" wine & beer, but I decided against the house wine and went for the Sangiovese 2006 Savignola Paolina, Chianti Classico IT ($10).  I *did* decide to order a little appetizer off the Happy Hour menu.  I ordered the duck salami that came with a grainy mustard and bread in a bag (see my picture).  The presentation was beautiful and the service was friendly.\n\nAnother thing I really liked was how they presented their wine list.  I'm not a wine expert, but I know what I like and what I feel like drinking.  The wine I had was listed under \"Bright and Juicy\" and that's exactly what I wanted and wasn't disappointed.\n\nThis is a nice addition to the area!", "author": "Kimberly B."}

However most tables were empty but the standing area was so packed that it was difficult to cross the room on my way back to the front. It was obvious that the 25 people standing around were part of a group that came for drinks and did not want to sit down. So instead of making my way to the front I sat down at one of the 10 free tables. This place is so small with only 12 tables. The waitres which were not paying that much attention through the whole evening came over immediately to remind me to wait in the front.\n\nService: food came at different times, wine arrived after the food although ordered a long time before. Waited for the check quite long too. Waiters forgot orders.\n\nFood: the small smoked trout salad had way less trout compared to our neighbor's plate. The 3 cheese selection was quite expensive for what it was. Portion was good but $$. The taste of everything was good.", "author": "Chris S."}

You know I've been sitting on that intro for a few days! *wink* \n\nOther edibles:\n-- fried capers, $3: not what I expected. Crispy, salty but needed a lil' sumfin, sumfin to be eaten with. \n-- charcuterie platter, $23 for 5: not sure what meats he chose but I tried a salami w/ black pepper which had an understated taste, nothing wild or spicy about it\n-- maple bacon butter & bread, $4.5: I should have gone for the garlic chili...\n-- FA's chicken pot pie, $12: one of my least favorite pot pies, sadly. Sherry, tarragon, carrots & roasted chicken had the consistency of goopey mush. There was a spice that totally turned me off (cumin? coriander? curry?) The pastry top had many flakey layers. \n-- mac & cheese, $11: loved the corkscrew pasta & the generous crunchy topping. Cheese wasn't as sharp as I would've liked & too runny. \n\nMore misses than hits, so three stars for our dinner is more than generous.

There's something about darkened and packed restaurants with cozy yet humbling food that really strikes a chord with me... I think Fat Angel might have been my first SF gastropub foray. I wasn't disappointed!\n\nI came here for pre-show dining before seeing Shabazz Palaces at Yoshi's SF. If you're going to Yoshi's for music, I highly recommend you come here instead of dining at Yoshi's; Yoshi's is overpriced and doesn't taste very good. Fat Angel was only a couple blocks away from the venue.\n\nThe wait is a little long, and since the establishment is pretty small, I had to wait outside. There is some bar seating, but I opted for the tables instead. The atmosphere was sexy yet understated, and the noise level was at a comfortable middle between awkward low and overbearing high.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nMaple bacon butter: As a self-proclaimed butter aficionado, I approve this dish! It reminded me of a buttery reincarnation of Frances' Bacon Beignets. When I ran out of bread, I started eating the butter on its own; NO REGRETS.\n\nMac n' cheese: I'm not a huge fan of mac n cheese, but since my boyfriend seems to be stuck in fourth grade, we gave it a try. It was AMAZING! They used conchiglie rigate (or what I always refer to affectionately as the \"shell pasta\", and the dish was served on a cast iron mini-casserole. Yum!\n\nChicken pot pie: Not as great as the mac n cheese, I'm afraid, but memorable in its own right. If you have never broke the shell on a steaming hot pie with the back of your spoon, you are missing out.\n\nI'll be back for you, Fat Angel.", "author": "Hanui C."}

I'd almost think it strange if this joint weren't sandwiched between two jazz clubs that serve traditional Ethiopian food.  Gotta love a wine bar that offers more snacks than just cheese (not that there is anything wrong with that).  Wine on draft was kind of cool too, though wish they'd offer it in a proper pint...\n\nFried Capers w/ Sage: I thought fried pickles were cool, but they don't hold a spear to fried capers!  Seemed like caper flavored air-filled raisins.  Each wrinkly skin of caper shatters in your mouth leaving just a wisp of bitter caper taste and a lot of salt.  Great on the innovation front, but felt a little grease overload halfway through.  Best to share.\n\nMaple Bacon Butter: Why did it take so long for someone to offer this?  Two of my favorite things together at once.  Real bits of fresh crisp bacon in a mound of extra buttery butter.  The bread offered was nice, but mainly just a vehicle for me to enjoy this butter because spooning it directly into my mouth would be a huge social faux pas.\n\nWild Mushroom & Truffle Oil w/ Pecorino Flat Bread: The bread was extremely thin, like a cracker.  Kind of reminded me of a makeshift pizza I once made from leftover whole wheat lavash bread.  The truffle oil wasn't heavily pronounced, they need to use more.  Overall, not so much a fan.\n\nMac-daddy Mac n' Cheese w/ Bacon: Dense spirals that manage to stick some gooeyness between each ramp.  The dense chewy texture was a nice change of pace compared to the limper elbows often offered.  The bacon was a nice add-in as always, but could have been crispier.\n\nBlueberry Tart: Not on the menu, but a substitute for the dessert they ran out of.  It was more like a mini blueberry cobbler than a tart.  Loved how the freshly whipped cream melted ever so subtly over it's luke warm dough.  Had that great jam-like blueberry texture which feels richer than the flowing berries of a traditional blueberry pie.", "author": "Adam B."}

It probably wouldn't get noticed by WineSpectator, but the selection should be satisfactory to all but the most snobbish wine drinkers. The beer list is several pages long and quite a few are on tap as well. I'm more of a wine drinker than a beer drinker myself. But since this place is clearly known for the beers they serve, I just told the bartender that I liked hefeweizens and just give me whatever they have on tap that was closest to it. I don't remember the name of the beer I got, but I was happy with it.\n\nFrom the kitchen I ordered the Basil pesto, black olives, roasted tomatoes & sausage w/ ricotta flat-bread. The bread itself was paper thin and crunchy yet still strong enough to support the tasty toppings. My only complaint is that I think sausage is a bit overpowering flavorwise. It still went well with my beer.\n\nThe waitress suggested I try the mac n' cheese which I ordered as well. She warned me that it was very hot. I dismissed her warning thinking she probably has to say that to everyone because she has to deal with a lot of people who are not used to eating spicy food. When the mac n' cheese arrived, I was a bit surprised because it was hot! Not so spicy that it was inedible, but spicy enough that you really wanted that beer to take the burn away.\n\nOnly two bartenders were holding down the fort all night and I must say that they did an excellent job of making sure everything was ok and getting all the drinks out.\n\nThis place is super popular with the locals.

The place looked quite unorganized, the bartender was also the server and there were only another female server for a crowded place. \n\nWe sat down and ordered our drinks. The drinks came momentarily, after we told them we were ready to order. He got our order in, there were a couple of other tables behind us who ordered later. We waited for almost 20mins for our cold cut plate. I don't know how long it takes to slice meat. But as I looked up, the tables who ordered way later already received their cold cut plates and salads! When my bf tried to speak to the waiters, they ignored him. I managed to catch the attention of the female waitress and explained to her that everyone else who ordered after us had received their food, even the hot plates yet we only had drinks. \n\nAfter 5-10 mins, our food began to come. The male server who was also the bartender made no attempt to explain or apologize for the significant delay, and acted as if nothing had happened. When we ordered dessert, they made no attempt to clear our table full of plates, instead piled the dessert plate on our stacked table. We had to essentially gather our own plates to have them being taken away. \n\nAs for the food, the cold cut platter was standard. The chicken pot pie was quite good, but the salad was overly dressed and soggy since it probably had been sitting on the counter for a long time. The creme brulee was average.

We both had flat breads (I had duck sausage, Luann had a lemon butter) and though I ordered a mac' n cheese they delivered a chicken pot pie my wife ordered the sliders.

I have been going here shortly after it had opened and loved the selection of beer (amazing menu + tap rotation) and food (bougie bar food). \n\nHOWEVER, of late I have had 3 terrible experiences in a row. Why:\n\n1) The service is atrocious. There are routinely too few waiters and bartenders. They always seem generally annoyed to serve you. \n2) The beer selection is diminished - as a bar this is bad. If you have 3 double IPAs and no belgian beers on tap, you're doing it wrong. \n3) They do not appreciate repeat business. I have met the same bartender probably five times, often going with my friend who lives across the street. Not once have we gotten a free drink or even just some better service. That's amateur hour compared to most other places I try to frequent.", "author": "Louis A."}

Okay... 3.5 hours later and table turnover on 2 tops that could have been pushed together but were not... A little annoying.  Biggest complaint is lack of foresight by the staff.

The intimate space has a small bar, dim lighting and seating along the far wall and lined across the front windows. There was outdoor seating as well but being San Francisco, it was too cold to sit out there. We scored a random cozy table in the middle of the restaurant. It ended up being a little traffic-y as waiters and customers would have to walk past us to get in and out.\n\nThe menu is simple and conducive to sharing. Selections of cured meats, cheeses and breads are the primary items. I was cursing that we had a lackluster meal at Dosa just 30 minutes prior as I wanted to try some of the great cheese choices they had.\n\nMy brit husband was in heaven with their beer selection. When the barman brought over the book of beers, his eyes lit up. He ended up getting a craft draft beer which was offered as a 16 or a 22 oz. The wine menu looked good but I wasn't in a vino or beer mood. Upon the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the pimms cup and it was so refreshingly good. There are cute quotes on the menu and I like that they included 'hetchy hetch' priced as free on the drinks side. \n\nThe crowd was a mix between girlfriends, first dates and married couples. I like communal/family style meals so the idea of ordering a couple of plates and sharing over some bottles of wine is ideal.\n\nPerfect spot for date night, intimate snack/drink with small group of friends.", "author": "Seema M."}

Nope, I've never had dose nutz.\n\nWhich brings me to one of my favorite quotes about our fair city:\n\nMost people believe the afterlife is one of eternal bliss.

While I don't know if that will be a lasting relationship, I have to say I was still impressed with this establishment as a business of its kind.\n\nI had not known of Fat Angel despite the fact that I live 4 blocks away. I hang out quite a bit on Fillmore street - more around J-town/Pac Heights area, but still, Fillmore street has everything my Webster street lacks. I was pleasantly surprised to be invited here one night and discovered that not only is this a \"bar\", it's a wine bar - WITH FOOD. Great food.\n\nOn a busy Sunday night there was one man running the show. He was behind the bar mostly making drinks. But he was also somehow waiting all those tables, cleaning up after tables (right away, too), and doing his job with such quickness that lacked the appearance of chaos. He didn't even lose his cool or raise his voice, NOT ONCE. The place isn't too big - maybe seats 25 people, max. But the place was PACKED. And it's easy to know why.\n\nThey not only have great wine and beer selections (I had some FANTASTIC IPA and more pinot noir, on the house) they also have wonderful fare. I had some of the best Mac&cheese of my life, a tasty and crispy flatbread, and the absolute best apple bread pudding of my life, served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream. It was a large serving of desert for only 6 bucks, a portion large enough to go around between probably three people. I don't know what they put into the bread pudding - nutmeg? But it was killer, not like any other bread pudding I'd eaten before. It was perfectly creamy and eggy but there was something else about it I haven't found in other bread puddings. It was creamy, crispy , rich, warm, gooey, not too sweet, and subtly spicy in a way I can't describe, really. \n\nWhat an awesome place to hang out in the neighborhood. Furnished with a curved bench, individual marble tables and matching antique chairs, antique sconces, matching mirrors, and beautiful, dark mahogany wood and cherry blossoms, this was a great spot for me to enjoy a low-key night with good musicians and better friends. Since my roommate and I are on almost exact opposite schedules except about once a week, once she turns 21 I have a feeling date nights are going to happen here often.", "author": "Y K."}

The shiraz is exceptionally good. And we tried a few. \n\nThe decor is swanky and homey all at once. It's a tiny place, and probably not great for a large group, but the perfect spot to kick back with a few friends. \n\nFat Angel is a little bit on the pricey end, but I think I'm just spoiled by all the places to get a cheap drink in SF. It's not the place to go for a cheap happy hour beer, but it's worth it if you're looking to linger and savor your food, drink, and company.\n\nIt's in a totally weird and unexpected neighborhood, but trust me, it will be worth the trek and the 45 minutes you spend trying to figure out how to get home in a wine induced stupor.", "author": "Kristen B."}

Not a huge venue, but its coziness and warmth adds charm to this wine bar in the Western Addition. Their happy hour specials are decent--$1 off draft wines and draft beers and $2 off flatbreads. \n\nNever having tried wine on draft, my companion and I ordered a draft cabernet and a pinot noir, respectively. We both enjoyed them...enough to order another. In addition, we ordered the mac 'n cheese and the wild mushroom and white truffle oil with pecorino cheese flat bread. The mac 'n cheese, while was delicious, both admitted to having had better, as theirs lacked a richness. The flatbread was just the right amount of crispness, and ingredients were fresh and very present. I'd definitely order that again. \n\nStaff was friendly and attentive; coming by our table just the right amount of times where we didn't feel neglected nor annoyed. Wine list was extensive (by the glass and bottle), as was the beer list. Prices were moderate; glasses ranging from $8 (whites) - $13. Ambiance is chill and relaxing; perfect for catching up with a friend, a romantic date (lighting is dim), or group outing (though again, the venue isn't huge). \n\nI'm a fan, and I'll likely go again as I enjoyed the wine and food, ambiance and service.

Would've expected some insane wait time,  but the staff was super friendly and we got a drink while we waited.\n\nPositives: Food was AWESOME, get the chicken pot pie. It'll fill you up and tastes amazing! Aside from that, all their little meat and cheese dishes are fabulously paired with jams and mustard to provide an incredible tasting meal. Ask the waiter for his/her opinion, and just trust them if you can't figure out what you want. Staff is super friendly, one of those small businesses where every customer is precious to them, and it shows. Atmosphere is romantic, great for a date.\n\nCon: It's a bit small. There's something like space for 20-25 people, and the place can get a little cramped. But really... being a small cozy romantic restaurant can be a nice change of pace. Not going to take away a star just because their business is so good that it's a little hard to move around.

Also a great place to grab a glass of wine or two pre- or post- concerts at The Fillmore or Yoshi's. \n\nTheir wine list is rather diverse with hilarious little descriptions of the wine written by Jason, which actually is what drew me to certain wines over others. I mean how can you not want to try a Syrah that is \"Proof that God loves us. This wine will take you on a magic carpet ride to Pleasure Town. Worth every penny. Funky, freaky, delicious.\" Right? The \"Cosmic\" Syrah will take you on a trip, and the Tempranillo is magical. For Spring-in-a-glass, make sure you get the Grenache Blanc, and the Chenin Blanc is lovely.\n\nThere are also bar bites, cured meats, cheeses, salads, dessert and BUTTER. Get the maple bacon butter - you'll wish you had a jar of it to make a MBB&J sammich at home. The angus beef sliders are crazy good. You'll want to up your order to 4 instead of 3 because they're that delicious. \n\nAfter several glasses of wine and nibblies, I walked out of here feeling a little bit like a fat angel.

We came for dinner Friday evening, and though it was more crowded than we were used to, we were seated immediately and service was friendly and quick.  Jason and Cy are enthusiastic, friendly and quick to clarify the interesting and humorous descriptions listed for the alcohol selection.  Draft beer selection changes from month to month I believe, but you'll always find something you'll thoroughly enjoy.\n\nTo the food.  Up until last night we've only ever ordered the meat plate.  A large plate of assorted charcuterie with bread and mustard for 22 dollars makes a great accompaniment to a few beers or wine, as well as a tasty appetizer.  My girlfriend had the pot pie, which I was blown away by its size, and I had the baked macaroni and cheese, made with various cheeses, and sized just perfectly even for a big boy like myself.  Rich but not sickeningly so, cheesy and filling, I'd happily order it again, but not make the same mistake of having pizza for lunch.  And the pot pie, well I helped her finish it.  Flaky crust, hearty filling, makes me wonder why the heck I ever buy the frozen variety.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-19", "description": "Here's something about me that may or may not surprise you: I grew up Catholic.  Not just church every Sunday, but Christian Bible Preschool and Catholic School for K-6.  I had nuns for teachers.  I had to wear an ugly uniform.  I used to have to read the Bible during class (we got to pick what we read, however, so usually I read the Book of Ruth.  It was only 4 pages.  Or Revelations, because it was cool).  I've completed the sacraments of Baptism, First Reconciliation, First Communion, and Confirmation (Mary Magdalene was my saint). \n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) having spent 18 years as a Catholic, I am what one would consider \"lapsed.\"  I don't go to church.  I don't pray.  I call out God's name in vain all the time.  I am most likely going to whatever hell Catholicism believes in, even if I no longer do believe.\n\nAlthough I am lapsed, there is something extremely comforting about entering a church, sitting on a cool pew, hearing the sounds of an organ wafting through, eating the wafer, and having some of the Blood of Christ.\n\nFat Angel is cool and comforting.  As part of a non-traditional St. Patrick's night adventure, a very cool friend (I was cool enough to come here by association) suggested we come here as a last stop.  He had mentioned that it was his favorite \"local\" many times so I was anxious to try it out, but hadn't the opportunity (meaning I'm clearly not doing a good enough job stalking him).\n\nAs this was the end of an already fun evening, I will definitely have to go back to gather more details.  Here's what I do know:\n\n-The owner/bartender is awesome.  He probably thinks I'm less awesome since I was saying lame things, but people really should get used to me saying lame things.  Answered all my questions, even if they were completely random and not appropriate.  \n-The decor is primarily made up of a church in Napa that was about to be demolished, complete with pews and the pipes from an organ.   It's a place where you can relax and have a soul-searching conversation with a friend, or have a first date.  This place is devoid of snobbery.\n-Although they don't have a full bar (which I prefer, keeps me out of trouble), they have wine on tap.  I really like this way of doing wine, especially since they have tastes, glasses, half-carafes and full carafes.  I also got a sample of a unique beer.\n-They have noms.  Really good noms.  An assortment of cheeses, accompanied by crusty bread?  Yummy.  A couple of salty meats?  Double yummy.  My cool friend?  Triple yummy.  Oh wait, he's not on the menu.  Tried one of the sliders as well, which I believe they said they could make without the onions.  \n\nBottom line?  This is my new local, even though it's nowhere near local to me.  I have fallen madly and truly in love with Fat Angel, which probably has Eros hidden somewhere.  Oh god.\n\nOh FYI, we're having a UYE here.  Soon.", "author": "Pam S."}

Whoever thought of making a bacon butter or a chocolate cinnamon butter needs to patent that shit because those two butters were two of the most amazing parties I have ever had in my mouth. Adding it with their country bread was genius! Looking for a little more substance? Their sliders and  their Mac n Cheese were both delicious.

While I stuck with the wine side this time, I was extremely impressed with the variety, as well as them being able to cover a lot of regions throughout the world. The owner, who was serving us, was extremely knowledgeable and for my last glass, I made him pick something for me. He ended up picking a beautiful Portuguese wine that was big and bold and fabulous! \n\nThe atmosphere is awesome. Small, quaint, perfect for that girls evening where you want to sit at a table and catch up, or for the predate drink where you are sitting at the bar. The owners also have an amazing taste in music, all his own collection. We made him promise that he would never change the music. The whole bar is made from a church organ he was able to snag from napa, and beautifully restored.\n\nI am so glad my friend stumbled upon this and wanted to share it with myself and our girlfriends. We all had nothing but excellent comments about this place and decided this is probably going to be our go to spot when we want to get together for a drink and hang out.

Cyrick is one of the happiest people around -- and is really knowledgeable about good food/drink pairings on the menu.  Plus - he  really knows cured meats. \n\nThe food -- the smoked trout salad with fennel and fried capers will turn any raging carnivore into a whipped vegetarian. It is THAT good. The sliders with the garlic aioli and spicy pickles are perfect bits of heaven. The chicken pot pie and mac 'n' cheese are consistently good. The tartufo salami is really tasty.\n\nThe wine -- Jason is like Pandora, but for wine. You tell him which wines you like, and he introduces you to new wines that he thinks you might like. He is usually right. \n\nThe ambiance -- Fat Angel is soft, romantic and brooding. Girls - the lighting will make you look your most beautiful.

And what a serious bargain for city dining! \n\nEverything was in our favor last Thursday evening.. one of those odd nights where hubster and I must have had karma and/or the gods on our side.. rock star parking on Geary directly in front of the Fillmore? Check. The last available (corner) table for two at FA when we walked in? Check. Being seated, ordering, & eating within about 40 minutes and getting to the show just as the lights came down? Check!\n\nContrary to reviews, service was FAST. And our waiter was super friendly and sincere. Instead of trying to upsell us, he discouraged us from each ordering a salad as they are GIGANTIC and also said if we weren't super hungry, we could probably share the mac n' cheese vs. each getting our own. We opted to each get our own anyway as we weren't ordering any other apps., but he was totally right, we ended up both leaving with a to-go box of mac (which then became our next day lunches!).  \n\nAs far as the food goes, everything was ridiculously tasty. The horseradish dressing on our arugula salad was super yummy, but the fried capers put it over the top! And the mac n' cheese was some serious comfort food- perfectly cheesy with an amazing bread crumb toasty top, baked in its own mini casserole dish.. yum. We had to use some crazy will power to stop ourselves from leaving in a carb coma.\n\nFinally, the beer and wine is I think what people first & foremost come for; as they should. They have a terrific list not to mention some incredible and reasonable stuff on tap. Once again, our waiter actually suggested to me one of the least expensive wines on the menu, the $6 sauvignon blanc on tap (!) and had we had more time, I would have  loved to have shared a bottle. Super juicy and refreshing, easily one of the best wine deals in town. \n\nAs a side note, to be honest, the name Fat Angel was a bit of a turn-off. I thought it sounded a little cheesy, especially after ogling the gold chubby angel that greeted us, hanging prominently above the doorway. BUT, don't be fooled, inside the decor is actually quite nice. I especially dug the gaudy in a good way giant crystal chandeliers and what appeared to be extremely large golden organ pipes behind the bar. The soundtrack was a decent mix of indie rock that was just loud enough to help mask the super loud and slightly rowdy conversations going on around our table. \n\nAll in all, Fat Angel is definitely thee place to hang before a show at the Fillmore and if you happen to live nearby, this is sure to become a new favorite. You could easily split one of their $9 giant salads (which are presented at your table in a large wooden salad bowl) four ways with a group of friends. $2 for a quality salad?

Wide and interesting selection of unique beers and wines on tap for decent prices with a selection of snacks like cheeses, salami, mac and cheese, sliders, etc. Not really a dinner place, more of an after-dinner/late-night spot. The wine list is written in a fun, accessible way.\n\nPerfect for hanging with any amount of friends, whether it's catching up with one pal or filling one of the bigger tables and getting stuff to share. In my experience it's been crowded/full but we never had to wait... it's relatively noisy but that's to be expected where people are drinking, eating, and making merry :) In its way it kind of reminds me of an old fashioned tavern, though the decor is classy.\n\nServers are efficient and friendly enough, but not overly so.\n\nThis is more of a 4.5 review. The only thing I really had a problem with... and this is just my preference, at the time I went they had a lack of any quality \"lighter\" beers. For their entire list/selection, even after I asked the bartender, there was only 1 lager that was very cheap compared to the others. I really enjoy Belgian beers, wheat beers, etc, and from a place that aims to have an extensive beer list I wanted more of my favorite beer \"genre\" to choose from! Although... checking their menu now I see a Belgian listed called \"Beer of the Future\".... I MUST RETURN FOR THAT. Further scrutiny shows that more such beers have appeared on their list, so I guess I can give them a whole-hearted 5 stars next time!\n\nOh yes, and did I mention they have MAPLE. BACON. BUTTER.??\n\nEDIT: They serve brunch now on Saturday (during the Farmer's Market in the Fillmore area) and have an unusual/different selection, although you could get \"normal\" items too (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc). I had a really tasty breakfast sandwich. My roomie got a pink mimosa (pricey but good) and the breakfast potatoes, which were seriously good and a pretty big portion for $4! My other friend got the \"Ploughman's Lunch\" which is a nice little salami/cheese/fruit plate that comes with a small beer (though he traded it out for OJ, ha). Overall it was enjoyable but getting any \"adult\" beverages hikes up the tab quickly. The food/normal drinks are reasonably priced.", "author": "Remi X."}

The flatbreads were superb: very thin,crisp and hot.  The cherry tomato's on top explode with flavor.  \nThe grape/gorgonzola/walnet...flatbread was memorable, to say the least!  Then came a fresh, complex salad with Endive, gorgonzola, walnuts.  It sounds like the usual gang of salad'fixin's but it is not!  Superb.\nWhen the little cast-iron dish of macaroni and cheese arrived we abandoned all attempts at civility. Smooth and creamy with a mix of cheeses and topped with a smattering of crunchy crumbs.

You can tell they love what they do ( i used to be in the industry and this is something you can tell! it translates into the whole feel of the place) they are passionate about their hand selected ingredients beer and wine.

Definitely do NOT walk around this area after dark alone or with a group of girls and no guys or big lesies to protect cuz it gets real SKETCHY! This area was one of many SF former neighborhoods I lived in as an adolescent and early adult, so I know very well that this is not an okay place to be vulnerable in.\nAside form this we walk in with no resies and are immediately seated. Very small place for which I was shocked by. Smelled amazing and the place was not packed yet. My fiend and I were greeted by a super nice women who was helpful off the bat in describing everything for us. We decided to each get this PIMM's cocktail which was odd but unique. If you get this then STIR IT! It does not look like it needs to be stirred, but it does! The bottom is where the cava liquor is. \nOnce we discovered that, it was super yummy!\nWe ordered the endive salad and the mac an cheese. NOTE about the mac: there is much more to it than shown on the menu. It is not a basic mac and cheese. It is spacey and filled with seasoning not typical of mac and cheese. I think it was a chipotle type seasoning so if that's a problem let them know in advance in case they can make it without. \nThe salads are HUGE! Enough for 3-4 people. Far too much for us. There is a reason they are around $11 each.....because they are the meal!\nAt some point out waitress asked if we wouldn't mind moving over one table because this large group without a resie walked in. We had zero issues moving and as such, the owner gave us a large and super amazing creme brulee on the house! SOOOO nice and so sweet! We would definitely return.

Parking was limited so I had my friends park the car so that I could go in and grab a table. INSTANT DISCRIMINATION. The snobs who worked there (except the Hispanic waiter who initially greeted me) were horrible. I asked for a table for 4 and got seated at a two seater. They acted like I was going to dine and dash the entire time. I looked over the menu as I waited for my friends, and in that time almost every obnoxious waiter (especially the pretentious dbag in the jorts who looks like the guy from the mountain goats) Came over to me and asked me what I wanted when it wasn't even busy and said they were going to get busy hinting for me to leave. I was pressured into buying a $20 bottle of mead that was a fair price if they included a free bj along with it. After ordering I asked if I could switch to a bigger table and they laughed and said \"maybe when you're friends get here\" rolling her eyes. Long story short my friends got there we closed the tab and I left her money plus tip which I didn't want to give. (I was a waitress and I have never in my life treated any of my customers so rudely). Then jorts (jean shorts) and waspy hipster girl run after my friends and I claiming that we hadn't paid! They've got good brew at horrible prices, but the pretentious hipsters that serve there are what make me never want to come back.", "author": "Bela V."}

So I'm pretty sure the bartenders & rest of staff find that pretty comical, but hell if a guy asks me out and asks me for my suggestions, well Fat Angel is definitely on my list! \nIt's a perfect date place. I love that it's not  huge or generic. The vintage cozy decor reminds me each and every time why I love living in the city. The cool inviting bar with the organ-like pipes way above, the enormous elk greeting everyone who arrives, and my favorite: the chandelier that reminds me of the one on James Cameron:  The Titanic. Oh I forgot the  charming dining area has actual pews from a church. The overall vibe and clientele is somewhat eclectic and granola, so no need to dress up, but who really does in SF unless it's a high-end sit-down dinner. \nSmall food menu but amazingly delicious. My favorites as mentioned earlier is the Endive salad but also love the flatbread with mushrooms with truffle... yummmm:)\nIt's just beer and wine here... not  a beer drinker, but they seem to always have  quite a list. Wine... well another reason why i come here.  Jenny the sommelier has great suggestions; she's usually behind the bar. The only negative thing i have to say about this place is when it is busy, service can be painfully slow. So I try to come when it's not:)", "author": "Myra M."}

I mean it looked like 1/2 oz of pate and about the same for the otehr items.  The Muchroom and truffle oil flatbread was dry and did not taste of truffle oil.  I think they might have put the oil in the mushroom past before it was cooked.  Truffle oil should be put on after it is out of the oven.  Great selection of bottled beers.", "author": "Mike P."}

Eventually some one came up with the brilliant idea of going to the first bar that we saw. Since I live quite literally across the street from Fat Angel, this ended up being our spot.\n\nIt was really cute and cozy inside and the wine list was extensive without being completely overwhelming. We shared a bottle of red wine that is made in somebody's garage or something and it was well received by all! The best part, however, would be the service. It's a small place, which I suppose helps with the attentiveness of the staff, but it seemed our server was always one step ahead of us.

It's an incredible addition to the city, and particularly the Fillmore. They have an impressive selection of wine and even more impressive selection of craft beers from around the world. I always ask either Cy or Jen for a recommendation and it's always spot on. Btw, Cy and Jen are awesome. Good people and great service. The food menu is short but you won't be disappointed with any dish you order. That's guaransheed for all my Rasheed Wallace fans out there. The atmosphere is beautiful. The owners purchased architectural components that previously belonged to a church - notice the organ above the bar, wooden benches along the walls, and golden \"fat angel\" hanging outside the front. If you're looking for a venue for a date, or low key dinner before going out, or a drink after work, look no further. Rumor has it the owners are looking to open a larger restaurant a half block around the corner on Fillmore.

Its swanky, stylish and such a find. A couple of friends opened up the place and it retains the unpretentious, intimate look irrespective of the surrounding neighborhood. My only gripe with the Fillmore district is that it's either 4-star expensive or 1-star and cheap and dirty. This place is a perfect balance for the neighborhood as it appeals to a wide range of people, young or old, professional or artsy type. It's perfect for me because I fall in between both those categories (in San Francisco definitions). \n\nThe wine bar is well decorated with reclaimed, recycled and repurposed materials from around San Francisco. So boho chic. The decorating highlights are the stamped tin roof and the \"99 bottles of wine wall\", aren't they so creative! The prices were average for the city, food was a bit cheaper than expected with the cheese plate being only $5 per cheese whereas you can pay up to $10 for the same sliver of cheese at other bars. The fried capers were delicious and creative. They tasted like the little fried bits of popcorn you find on the bottom of the bowl chocked full of salt and buttery deliciousness. I don't know how they made them, but keep it up. There is a wide selection of house made butters with all sorts of fun flavors like maple bacon and flatbreads to fill the tummy's of those who have a hard time just grazing. The theme for happy hour is \"whine after work\" which we all need from time to time, $1 off draft wines and beers and $2 off flat breads. What is draft wine you ask? Its the barrel of wine directly from the vineyard hooked up to a tap system similar to how bars serve beer. It's a fabulous idea and quite entertaining to check out. I'd never had draft wine outside of a vineyard before but I'll definitely come back to try out every kind. That's just the kind of dedicated blogger I am. \n\nFat Angel is my new favorite local spot! Plus the name is entertaining. It reminds me of the Lyle Lovett song, \"Fat Babies Have No Pride\" which still puts a smile on my face. Poor fat babies.", "author": "Alice S."}

My favorite items on the menu are the smoke trout salad and the meat/cheese plate.  The staff are really  friendly and willing to give suggestions if you don't know what you're in the mood for.  They had a delicious triple creme bleu cheese the last time I was there, but their cheese/meat options seem to change fairly frequently.  They have a good beer/wine list so it's a good place to grab drinks after work and then transition into dinner.  The decor is cozy and warm, but it is pretty small, so does get crowded.  I'd call ahead if you're going on a Friday/Saturday.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

And in my book as long as the wine is good, it's hard to go wrong. As a result, it can definitely hard to stand out among the many around. And yet Fat Angel flies high above them all. It's a bit off the beaten path of busy Fillmore but very worth the trek past Popeyes and the Brooklyn's clothing store. The have a very interesting and varied winelist plus really good stuff on tap. Who knew a zin could be so good when poured like a beer? Fat Angel's food shines as well. The meat plate is a little bit of sliced pork heaven and the bread to go with is perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The flatbreads are also delicious and worth the fire time. So grab a seat at the bar, chat up the owner, and enjoy a nice glass of vino after that long day of work.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

The ambiance  is is one of relaxation, romance and quirky fun.  The lighting is kept dim, the furniture is vintage inspired, beautiful flowers decorate some of the corners while a great chandelier dangles from the slightly vaulted ceiling.  Laid back classy.  There is a great wine list with wonderful little descriptions to help you decide which one to pick and to have in the most beautiful glasses ever!  We always end up going with one of Jason's suggestions, as his recommendations are spot on for whatever your pallets mood is!  I love bubbles and wish there was a bigger variety, however, their food is pretty amazing!!  The flat bread is off the hook!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-27", "description": "After seeing great reviews on Yelp my boyfriend and I decided to try out Fat Angel last Saturday. We arrived at the restaurant around 7:30 and we're told there was one party in front of us as we put our name on the list. Note, we didn't actually write our name down or watch a host write our name down, we just gave our name to a waiter who was supposed to be responsible for the wait list. I never actually saw our name or any other guests name recorded in any way.\nAnyway, after putting our names on the \"list\" we grabbed a drink and stood near the entryway with a couple of beers. A few minutes later a couple came in and put their name on the list. Two seats opened up at the seat yourself bar so we sat down. Food menus were placed in front of us immediately, I told the waiter I would rather wait for an actual table, which he said was fine. A few minutes later I see the couple that came in after us being seated. I grabbed the waitress working that night and told her that we had come in first and asked why we weren't being seated. First the waitress tried to argue with me and insist that I must have just imagined to have stood next to them while they put their name on the list and that they probably came in earlier. When I insisted that no, we came in first, we were there when they put their names on the list the waitress rolled her eyes and told us that most people were fine sitting at the bar so the waiter handling the list had probably just taken us off. She then just walked away. I was shocked. She was just so rude. Instead of trying to rectify their mistake she acted like it was so ridiculous to expect the wait / host staff to do their job. I didn't catch her name, but the waitress working 5/19/2012 was probably the rudest waitstaff I have dealt with. I couldn't believe she just walked away, so I grabbed another waiter to try and get the situation resolved. The second waiter (named Sai I believe) apologized and offered to buy us a round of drinks out of his own pocket. Now, in retrospect he probably wouldn't have paid for the drinks out of his pocket the restaurant probably would (or at least should) have an allowance of food and / or drinks that can be comped when there is some sort of mistake on the part of the staff, but since he was saying it would be coming out of his pocket and since he was neither the very rude waitress I had just dealt with or the incompetent waiter who \"put our names on the list\" I refused the free drinks and just asked that we be seated at a table as soon as possible.\nA while later we were seated at this little window - bar thing. I thought it  was odd we were being seated there since we refused seating at the bar and this was ostensibly the same or worse than seating at the bar, but at this point I was quite hungry so I just sat down. We ordered cheeses, meat, a salad, the mac & cheese, and a couple glasses of wine. The cheeses, meat, and wine were delivered quickly and were fine. The salad came out after we were finished with the cheeses and meat. The food was fine, not mind-blowing, but not bad. We were about two-thirds of the way through the salad when the check arrived. Both of us were sufficiently satiated so we didn't ask about the mac & cheese, but it was at this point that I decided I had to write a review addressing the subpar service at Fat Angel. The waiter who had offered to buy us a round came with a check that had taken the first round off the bill, which was nice but didn't really make up for all the issues with the meal. To me it seems like most of the waitstaff would fit better at a crappy dive bar, where you don't need to write things down because it really is much easier to remember a few drink orders than the names and order of people on a wait list or several tables food orders and you can be more surly with guests. \nIn short although the beer and wine list seems extensive & interesting the service will keep me away.", "author": "Kelsey M."}

Grab a drink at the bar while you wait and make sure to bring people that will make good conversation or you can always stand at a table giving dirty looks to hurry up and get going. Anyway back to Fat Angel, great selection of beers and amazing bites. You would definitely have to come here a few times to try all the items on the menu. The menu itself is quite small but you definitely want to try it ALL. For appetizers they offer their flavored butters (yum), cheese and meats (yum yum). They offer salads, flat breads, mac n cheese, sliders ( a must try!!! you will die for the sauce), and chicken pot pie. They also offer items for dessert but the 2 times I dined I was way to stuffed to get to that part of the meal. I will definitely have to leave room next time.

First time was to scope out the place, try the wine, and a few of the appetizers and see what I would need to do if I was bringing a semi-large, free flowing group through on a Friday.  The first experience was divine!  Great wine and champagne plus a delicious cheese with honeycomb (my favorite)!  i was sold and hooked.  After devouring my experience, I touched base with the house manager/wait staff/jack of all trades about possibly making a reservation.  He stated this wasnt possible.  They dont take reservations.  But if I got there early I could take over a couple tables and he'd make it work.\n\nThe invites were sent, I was talking up the place and people were excited.  I arrived before 5:30 on a Friday to snag my two tables.  When I arrived I spoke with the same guy who informed they had two reservations totaling 35 guests.  I am expecting an additional 20.  We tried to make it work at Fat Angel.  Then it became increasingly more difficult, so I took my party elsewhere.  Saddened and dismayed this decreased my 2nd experience at Fat Angel.  \n\nBe up front with your customers about what you can and what you cant do.  Either you DO take RESERVATIONS or YOU DONT!

I walked in, thought it was a coffee bar, did a double take and realized I was in the right place. Very intimate with some really sweet bartenders/waiters. I had the GSM and the Zinfandel on tap. Both were great, although I think I liked the Zinfandel more. They also have an amazing cheese plate that disappeared pretty quickly among five friends. It was a great start to a fun and random night :)", "author": "Lizette R."}

Yummy!  For me, what stands out about FA's mac & cheese is that it's made with Gruy\u00e8re, topped with toasted bread crumbs and comes out sizzling in a cast iron casserole.  The portion is large enough for two, so one can try other things on their limited menu.  I was in a group of 4 in my first visit and along with the mac & cheese, we had their sliders, flat bread and a nice bottle of reasonably priced red wine.  All of us had a wonderful time!  On a return visit with a friend, we sat at the bar had very good wine from the tap and shared FA's chicken pot pie and a fris\u00e9e salad.  The salad could easily have fed 4.  The pot pie portion was huge, too, but both of us agreed that it was too heavy.  It's more in the style of a shepherd's pie--too thick and potatoey.  I much prefer a creamier pie that one can spike with a shot of sherry.  The Big Four still ranks as my personal favorite for pot pie.\n\nThe Fat Angel, having just celebrated their first anniversary, attracts an attractive, young, hip crowd probably more into FA's very good beer list than their wines.  I find the decor very attactive--done up with the fixtures of an old church.  Organ pipes line the wall behind the bar and pews serve as banquettes.  Sit long enough at the bar with a few glasses of wine and one can easily think of Christine Daa\u00e9 being serenaded by the Phantom!", "author": "Alex M."}

When telling the waitress she simply said that the kitchen staff is from Mexico and that's why it's spicy.... ??????? Never heard such a thing B4. Wines were good but service was non-existent. After seating at a table for 15 minutes we had to get up to order at the bar. When they brought us the food there was no napkins, silverware or water until we got a glimpse of the busboy and asked him for those items. Even to ask for another wine and the bill we had to go to the bar, but a group of girls next to us had a waiter coming to them all the time... Would not recommend.", "author": "Amanda T."}

And for the first half an hour, I was not disappointed. We ordered some mushroom and truffle flat bread and it was delicious. The Pinot Noir on tap was not bad but I didn't expect much from tap wine anyway. Then things started to go downhill after I ordered a glass of Bordeaux. I swear that bottle was opened more than two days ago. There was no fragrance left. The wine was really bland. My bf also ordered a glass of another red wine which turned out the same as my Bordeaux. So 3 stars for food and atmosphere. But seriously, taste your wine before you serve it and throw away the old bottle please.", "author": "P. L."}

We had the mushroom flatbread (also $2 off for HH), maple bacon butter, 2 meat selections and ceasar salad with roasted chicken.  surprisingly the salad was my favorite.  Don't get me wrong, butter that tastes like breakfast was fantastic, but the roast chicken was cooked so perfectly and the homemade dressing and fried capers really took a typical salad to another level.

I searched around on Yelp for places in the area so we could just park one time and walk over to the show afterwards. I found this place on here and saw the good reviews so we decided to try it out. We got here around 6 p.m. and sat up at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and nice! The place became very crowded as the evening went on, probably because of the show at the Fillmore. It was fun, classy and overall a stellar time! It was a place to go for food, wine, good beers and you can laugh in there without the whole place noticing even though it is a smaller place. We ordered the boar salami, truffle oil mushroom flatbread, a bleu cheese, maple bacon butter, lemon caper butter, bacon macaroni and cheese, sliders and chicken pot pie. This was more than enough food for four very hungry people!  All of the food was very good with the only disappointment being the chicken pot pie. The pot pie was only luke warm and very bland. Next time I would opt for a salad because they were huge and looked amazing. It seemed like the kitchen was a bit disorganized if they were busy but I am sure that will be worked out in time, they are fairly new. As for the drinks we ordered the Pinot Nior on tap, Pranqster beer, a specialty bottle beer and a glass of each of the two Pinots. The 2006 Carneros Pinot was out of this world, highly recommend it. The highlights definitely were that Pinot, maple bacon butter, macaroni and cheese and the truffle oil flatbread.

What to expect from a place called Fat Angel? No girl ever wants to eat at a place with the word fat in it unless it is spelled with a P.H. When walking in the restaurant I wasn't sure how the night was going to play out because it was packed with only 1 seat at the bar, our odds were not looking good. Our home town friendly bartender made us feel confident and right at home when he said that it will only be a few moments. Literally in a \"few moments\" the best seat in the restaurant was available. We like to people watch. There we were sitting at a window seat looking over the charming vibe of Fillmore and O'Farrell. was more than we ever expected. Great conversation surrounding us as we ordered delicious wine and waited for our handcrafted ceasar salad to be made. Our flat bread pizza was thebomb.com. DEELISH is all i have to say. We topped it off with the best sliders. Just ask Dianne for the \"mini goodness\", she knows what's up. Overall...a quaint setting with incredible service. Whether you are taking your gal, your friend, your brother or cousin you will for sure have a good time. Thanks Jason.   I'd go back because it was a chill, open environment .

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-26", "description": "What separates Fat Angel from other wine bars in the city is the unconditionally friendly service from the owners and their thorough descriptions of the wines. They emphasize wines that are not from the CA region (which makes me happy, since I am a wino for Spanish and South American varieties) and they are willing to spend a lot of time talking about the flavors and your personal preferences. They also offer tastings if they think they have a great suggestion for you. It is San Francisco, so the prices reflect that (7-14 dollars per glass) but their 7 dollar glass is of a higher quality, in my opinion, than at most other wine bars. Fortunately, they do not have the all-too-common SF wine snob approach. They have been very good to me every time I come in, and this very quickly became a favorite spot.   Lastly, as someone who avoids places like the Marina and the Financial District at all costs, it needs to be said that I've been in this place on the days when I've been sloppy and scrambling for loose change and on the days when I just bought a pretty new dress and wanted to make an afternoon of it.", "author": "Annemarie G."}
