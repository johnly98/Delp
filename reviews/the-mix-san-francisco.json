Surrounded by the happiest people on earth, we left all our cares and worries at the door and partied it up like it was 1969. The place looked and smelled like it was from that era- divey for short. The drinks were stiff and dirt cheap. G&T for $4? Hell, yeah! We hung out at the back outdoor patio with music blasting and people mingling. It felt like a house party as if everyone knew each other - until a little fight broke out between two girls but they instantly got kicked out. Everyone cheered thereafter and went on with the party like nothing happened. Gotta love this neighborhood bar and Castro, of course. Cheers!", "author": "Marissa S."}

I think my brother and I were just so exhausted from traveling that we just weren't able to really enjoy the atmosphere of this place.  As much as I love a heavy pour for my whiskey, I couldn't even drink my Jameson and diet because of the lack of any soda.  I could have gone back to the bar to have them top it off with more soda, but it was a Wednesday night and not a lot of action happening.  We did like the heaters on the back patio because it allows everyone to enjoy the fresh air but also stay warm during those chilly SF evenings.  Hopefully, I can come back and check this place out when I'm ready to hit the town and have more than one drink.  This will more than likely change my experience.", "author": "Jamie J."}

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying straight people are not welcome. I'm saying that there are plenty of hetero dominated bars in the city that have more room.

Bartenders are very friendly to all us and treat us equally. \n\n$14 for a Whiskey Sour with Jack not too shabby! \n\nSee you again when we're in San Francisco.", "author": "Liz N."}

One bartender was more interested in the cute boy at the end of the bar and the other walked past me, twice, before asking what my order was. If I was looking for that kind of service I would go back to Charlie's in Phoenix -- at least they have an awesome taco stand next door. My wife and I ordered two draft blue moons -- you can't really go wrong there -- but the 10 minutes it took to get noticed was a bit ridiculous.\n\nOnce we sat down, we commenced people watching. I enjoyed the three games of pool I watched -- damn, it would have been nice to get a chance to play instead of the guy setting up the table and waiting for his friend for 20 minutes. Real mature, Mr. I'm-A-Regular-Here Guy. Give someone else a chance, yo.\n\nI guess it's a \"thing\" in San Francisco to only be a cash bar (QBar, Twin Peaks, The Lexington Club, I'm lookin' at you, too) but holy hell is that irritating.\n\nI give this place 1 star for the diversity and 1 star bc my Blue Moon was delish and only $3.

Firstly, for some reason, it seems (to me) that they are far cruisier than the dance clubs in the area... I know, that's opposite of what people usually say. But I think that in a neighborhood bar there's a different sense of 'friendliness' and the acceptability of talking to total strangers. When you're a regular here, people tend to get a sense of who is there to hang with friends, who is there to meet people, who is there to be generally social, and it's all good. But as an outsider, in a neighborhood bar, I think that people are more likely to chat you up than in a busier venue, and if you just want to kick it with friends, that can be annoying after a time. But I digress...\n\nThe Mix is one of the better venues of its type. The large back patio is inviting, the people are friendly but maintain boundaries, the bartenders are chill. I knew I was back in SF when I saw a young guy (early 20s) pull out a bong and hit it right at his table, looking fairly unconcerned that anyone in the bar would take offense.

However, it is easily my favorite bar in the city, gay or straight, and I am not gay.  I do not go to bars to meet girls, or try to get laid, nothing like that.  I go to bars to drink, hang out with friends, people watch, and get some ridiculous stories.  And, depending, if I am drunk enough, to dance my sweet little ass off. \n\nThis bar has a great patio to hang out with friends and people watch, the general clientele is all very friendly, and unlike some gay bars, where being the straight one is frowned upon, no one seems bothered by the fact that I am there, and many still offer to buy a drink, even when I say \"Just so you know, I am straight.\"  Sure, to my hopefully narcissistic self, I take this to mean they find me sexy as hell and hope they can get me drunk to woo me, but hey, if they want to try, as long as I am honest, why the hell not?  \n\nAs far as the stories from people watching or drunken friends go, I have many.  From the time my female friend decided to walk around topless after allowing some random guy to touch his first vagina (hers) and then those two made out with my other friend, only for her to be left out as my gay friend and this random guy disappeared into the bathroom to 'service each other\" as I walk in to witness it, to the time when one of my friends legit pimped out me and another guy for drinks.  (Yes, this happened: story,  girl I was seeing came with me, two gay friends, and a straight buddy.  Guy approaches us, we say we are straight, but she is our pimp.  He proceeds to hand her cash if she will make us spin around and or let him touch our butts.  She then used the money to buy rounds for everyone involved, the payer included, and then returned all the change to him.  He hung out with us the rest of the night.)  \n\nThe patio allows smoking,  and based on what I have witnessed, not just tobacco. There is a bar inside or outside, the margaritas are KILLER, and every drink is strong as hell (think Pop-Eye on Spinach).  There is pizza across the street, and pretty much any major bank I can think of within half a block, so  cash only shouldn't be an issue.  \n\nWhen I say I would choose this bar over any other in the city, I do not exaggerate.

For instance, If you go to Badlands, you'll most likely drown in a sea of top 40 mainstream gays who all have the same collared shirt from Forever 21.

The music isn't too loud and the lights aren't too dim, the ambiance is always just right. I really want to know who is in charge of the music, the play-list is always superb. It'll range from '80s to indie and rap to chill-wave, none of that crappy music you hear on the radio.

She also can't say most names correctly, and if she pronounces it wrong the first time, she'll most likely never get it right. \n\nTherefor, it could *only* be she who would ask me, after 9 hours of pm -to-am labor, if I was up for \"The Mix at Six.\" I didn't know what that meant, but seeing as who was asking me, I knew it would probably be something I didn't want to tell my mother about. \n\nSo my first and some of my only experiences with the Mix have been at 6am, when we were by no means alone in that bar. There were a few regulars, some people who looked as though they hadn't been home in days, and a man overly eager to compete with my supervisor in a game of pool. Classy broad, that woman. And she turned me into one swell lady myself. But at least we had worked through the night and were relaxing afterward... my other friend who woke up early just to join us borders on being an alcoholic.", "author": "Brian K."}

I guess The Mix fills that bill.\n\nHaving lived in the Castro for some 15 years, I frequently bemoan the lack of good quality bars restaurants and stores. Sure, if you are 20-something and/or gay and/or male and/or a Swedish tourist, you will probably enjoy the charms a packed meat-market bar with a dance-floor followed by a slice and some mediocre pasta and trip to the video store (the one next to the all-lube store - no not that all-lube store, the other one). \n\nI must admit that when I was a tourist (albeit, not actually gay or from Sweden - England, actually - I know, I get that a lot!) I did revel in  the insanity and debauchery of many of these establishments, but these days I look for a steady down to earth bar where I can knock back a few and laugh of the woes of the week.\n\nThat's why after all these years, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally ventured into The Mix. I guess you can't judge a book by it's cover as I had always taken this place, peering in from the outside, as a cramped and sweaty all-boys, all-the-time action bar. \n\nBut what do you know? While the joint sits firmly and proudly on it's gay-bar monika, it is simultaneously straddling the cozy-local-bar mount. There's plenty of booze, TVs, pool tables, and welcoming bar-staff. There's a bright and breezy conservatory out back and the drinks are reasonably priced. \n\nThe night I first went, there was a tequila promotion going on and free mini-daiquiris for everybody. WooHoo - what a pleasant surprise all round! I love this place! They don'y mind a bit if you're not from Sweden!\n\nA word to the wise for the ladeeez - there isn't one! Ha!

The bartenders are ridiculously nice, almost to the point where you have to wonder if they're working you for tips, but it doesn't matter as they always end up giving us free rounds because we return the ambiguous, friendly favor with our, well, our generous tips. The drinks are heavy on the sauce, so I stick with MGD (if I'm driving) and it's entertaining to see which way Nick or Gil will open my bottles.\n\nThey have a jukebox with all of the classic songs as well as modern-day radio shit; a pool table that is always in use; touch-screen video games; and a nice little lounge area surrounded by blue lights.

It is often used by us smokers, so if you're looking for a smoke-free patio, I'd suggest you take your pink lungs and look elsewhere.  \n\nAs far as the patrons go, its the usual kindness you would expect from drunk people - easy to mingle with anyone of all ages, especially if you, a gay man, wear plaid.  As far as the women, occasionally you will have your group of lipstick lesbians who make fun of everybody.  By everybody, I mean they will directly talk shit about you, your friend(s), the bartender you ordered from, the guy you were standing next to, the guy he was standing next to, and the air that you, \"all aren't worthy enough to breathe,\" all within a 11-inch radius of your ears.

It's women-friendly, the gals working at the bar make pretty tasty drinks (nevermind the bartender guys, they're pretty high on themselves and their twinky bodies...specially that shirtless douchebag. *looks at douchebag*), there's a patio where you can sit down and eat some American grubs like a cheeseburger or some jalapeno (alt+164) poppers.\r\n\r\nThe crowd is rather mixed. Specially towards the end of the week, when some brown and asian folks will come out. I'm just happy to see people who don't necessarily look like your typical Castro clone. There'll be chunky guys, tall guys, short guys, guys in their 20's, 30's and 40's... all behaving properly and having a good ol' time. And not many old guys either, thank God. No offense, you daddies out there. But sometimes it feels like if it's not the gym-bunnie/Abercrombie ficticious TV-shit, it's grey haired hairy men who'll grab your butt at random.  The Mix is NOT that. And that's what's been making it special recently.", "author": "Tomas V."}

Don't worry, I'm fine and I have no inclination to throw myself off the GG bridge and the eye makeup isn't running down my cheeks yet -- besides I've never been one of those perpetually peppy people who always accentuate the positive -- but I kind of want to go to sleep for a long time, like FOREVER. Know what I mean? Maybe it has to do with my broken penis pump or longing for my immortal beloved or my usual post-Pride crash but frankly I feel like a fucking leper. I mean, shit, my self-hatred is even outpacing my misanthropy and everyone knows that rarely happens. Robert Burton told me the Ancient Greeks had a word for this -- melancholia (black bile) -- then devoted over a thousand turgid pages to chronicling it. Personally, I prefer the less-clinical FUCKED IN THE HEAD. I know you're saying: THAT'S WHAT YOU AND YOUR ASS FACE GETS FOR WRITING SHITTY REVIEWS, MONKEY BOY! And: cry me a river! Like you're the only one who's felt like that! To which I say: fuck you. And: WHERE'S MY ZOLOFT/STOLI/TWINK PORN/LOADED GUN?\n\nSo in an effort to exorcise the emo demon, some friends brought me to The Mix for booze and boys since the best way to cure problems is by becoming an alcoholic who will bone anyone with a pulse. Also, Jesse Helms just passed and I wanted to celebrate his contributions to society by possibly giving some hot male ass a tongue bath. We passed the interior bar, the pool table, the plank benches, and made our way for the second bar on the back patio where the smokers congregate under gas heaters. It's not my favorite bar in the world, but the drinks are fairly priced, the pours are steady, and the folks aren't full of themselves unlike a lot of the other Castro haunts. I sat there, Tom Collins in hand, inhaling second-hand smoke, calming my nerves and feeling better about myself, when I noticed this guy across us staring at me.\n\nMe [to Friend]: Hey, see that guy?\nFriend: Which one?\nMe: The one in the blue hoodie, brown hair. He's on the other side of the patio, smoking. Kind of to your right.\nFriend: Oh yeah...Oh shit, he's totally checking you out!\nMe: I know!\nFriend: So?\nMe: Well, he's pretty cute.\nFriend: Yeah, so go over and talk to him.\nMe: Huh? Shit, you know I stink at talking to strangers. Plus I feel retarded right now.\nFriend: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. You're fine. Look, he's clearly looking at you. Over half your work is done.\nMe: I guess you're right\nFriend: Fuck yes I am. GO! [nudges me in the side]\n...\nMe: Hey.\nDude: Uh...hey.\nMe: I'm Darin. What's up?\nDude: I'm R______. So, Darin, aren't you that crazy gay guy on yelp?\nMe: Um...yes.\nDude: Yeah, that's what me and my friends thought...OKAY, it's getting chilly out here, I'm heading inside.

I am usually resistant to crowded places, but this wasn't too bad. Because of the heat, we had their frozen margaritas, which were kind of pricey at $8 for a tall, but they were pretty strong, so there you go. Alas, the most memorable part of this experience (for me) was observing the preparation of one of their house specialty shots ... the \"Ovarian Burst.\" It looks just as disgusting as it sounds -- plus contains butterscotch liqueur, which is even more vile to me than the gelatinous bloody clot floating inside the shot glass.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-12", "description": "The drinks are cheap and strong at the Mix.  The bartenders aren't really that interested in talking to you.  I'm not a big sports fan so I don't often hang out here, but it makes a nice change sometimes.  The patio is relaxing, sometimes they have shows outside which are very entertaining.  The food served on the patio is not the best, I've tried it twice without enjoying it.  The pool table crowd can be a little annoying as they use up all the inside seats and don't look where they are jabbing with their sticks.  However all in all it's still a nice place to go once in a while.", "author": "Michael D."}

It was crowded from the front all the way to the back patio where it was still so warm and muggy because of the sweaty bodies under heat lamps and shrouded in a dense miasma of smoke.  I'm willing to overlook all of this because the bartender made me an extra long island.", "author": "Marjorie B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-20", "description": "I have been an on-again/off-again regular of Mix since it opened.  The manager, Silvia, makes the most amazing margaritas and is one of Castro's most popular bartenders.  She really treats everyone with kindness even when super busy.  Linda on Sundays is pretty famous for her bloody mary's.  The bar really does get a mix--from gym bunnies to locals getting off work to chain smoking alcoholics with no teeth.  The owner, Larry, is often around and keeps the place clean and well-maintained.  One of the best outdoor patios around.", "author": "Richard N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-12-15", "description": "My friends and I would saunter over to the Mix on Sunday nights to watch the L word.  It's a pretty decent sized bar with a patio in the back.  If you are going to watch the L word, they have a bunch of flat screens around the bar, so you don't have to hover around one screen.  The bartenders are kind of aloof, in that I-am-cooler-than-you kind of way.  They have a pool table, for those of you who just want to be seen, but don't really care to watch the show.  The only gripe I have with this place is that they need more than one toilet!", "author": "jen n."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-16", "description": "I really like this bar.  It's a gay sports bar and it fits both those descriptors very well.  There are always games on the tv and great eye candy.  They have an outdoor area that is covered and has heating lamps so you can smoke while drinking and not freeze your ass off.  They always have some kind of special drink which will be like $2-3.  It's pretty casual and has a good neighborhood feeling.", "author": "angela k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-23", "description": "After a crazy experience at a place which shall remain nameless, my friends and I came here to end the night. They didn't have a DJ, but  the music was so much better than where we came from, plus we had room to breathe. I liked how there was a long bench along the wall where people could sit. There's also a pool table which I had my eyes glued to for a good minute because the guy that was playing looked like he could be a professional. Interesting part for me was when I headed to the restroom. Theirs is co-ed. I didn't even experience that in college. Awkward? No, not really. Although it would've been nice if my guy friend had closed the stall door before going about his business (#1 mind you). I was so close to walking in on him. O_o This would be ideal pre-party territory. I suggest that you try one of their shots. It's called, wait for it....a c*ck sucker. Sounds nasty, but tastes damn good. Don't knock it 'til you try it!", "author": "Rhia R."}

Good place to go after already having a couple drinks, and great for having another drink before dancing.  The three of us went to the back area and had a marvelous time chatting.  There were some Sisters there that evening, one who was lovely and kind enough to warm my freezing hands.", "author": "J B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-19", "description": "Overall a really great bar.  I typically hang out at the front bar and avoid the back patio as I am someone that does not tend to like alot of people in a small space.  The bartenders are super friendly, the drinks are great and it is fun watching the regulars playing pool when they are drunk.  The Mix has two different crowds as well which is kind of unique for a Castro Bar.  The front is a little more laid back and the back is more roudy.  Basically it is a great bar for everyone regardless of what your crowd may be.  I only wish this bar would hop on the band wagon and accept credit cards.  Until they do this I cannot give them a 5 star rating.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

I give it three stars for the patio as I smoke; patio is always open whenever I have been there.  The little tiny gal there that bartends is a real sweetie.  A couple of the staff can be extremely rude so I simply avoid them.  Someone else here mentioned the tranny regular who speaks in a foreign language that no-one understands.  I also get a kick out of her/him; have never heard her/him speak a word of English.  She speaks some sort of jibberish with crazed fits of laughter every few minutes.  I always say hello to her and she smiles and then mumbles incoherently for several minutes before falling into another fit of laughter.  I want whatever she is on.", "author": "Mario C."}
