I quickly made reservations in advance but it was honestly a little tough to find a good time/date because it was so busy. What a cute place though!! A handful of tables inside, very very pristine and welcoming, with great smells drafting out onto the sidewalk as you walk in. I don't spend a lot of time in Bernal Heights but I'm glad I got out here for this place.\n\nTo start we ordered drinks, the infamous sangria and the anchor steam beer. The sangria was absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend getting the pitcher if you have 2 or more people wanting to drink it. For food, we ordered:\n\nCebiche Pescado $17.5 - Fresh Fish of the day, Aji Rocoto leche de tigre\nPulpito Bebe $15.5 - baby octopus, papitas dorada & ocopa\nPaella Negra with Squid Ink $26 - Peruvian style seafood paella with Arborio rice in pimento-saffron base\nAji De Gallina $20 - Shredded chicken breast stewed in aji Amarillo sauce with potato, Botija olive, egg & side of steamed Jasmine rice\n\nEverything was delicious and the portions were large, even the smaller plates on the menu that we ate as appetizers. Our server was nice and helpful, and he came back several times throughout the meal to check on us and it always seemed to be perfect timing - when we needed water refills or we were ready to order another drink.\n\nWe'll be back!", "author": "Bri T."}

Simple, intimate, eclectic but not overstated. We were seated in tight quarters in the back - small area (but we were not uncomfortable).  However, if you make a reservation ahead of time I would suggest trying to get a table in the main (front) room.  This restaurant definitely deserves four stars for both the food and service.  But be warned that it's pricey (as reflected in the $$$ on the Yelp! description).  So, be prepared.  If the servings sizes were larger i wouldn't blink at the prices but these dishes are intricate and small.  Our dinner for 5 was $269 (and the tip was included in our bill...so if going with a group make sure you check that).  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and it was enough for maybe 5 1/2 (not full) glasses.  In addition, I think the boys got a couple beers after and then 1 more glass of sangria.  We also ordered about 5-6 tapas plates and 2 entrees, which again are very small portions. \n\nTapas:\nCostillita de Res $15 - looked yummy but didn't try.\nPastelito de Choclo $12.50 - by far one of my favorite dishes.  Sweet and yummy.\nBolitas de Yucca $13 - 3 yucca balls, nice texture, interesting flavor.\nTequenos $13 - another of my favorites\nHumita Dulce $13.50 - a table favorite\n\nEntrees:\nArroz Chaufa $20 - Chinese inspired fried rice (I didn't try this)\nLomo Saltado $21 - very good but again a very small portion for the price.\n\n2 Desserts\nPassion Fruit Panama Cotta $9 - AMAZING\nAnother dessert - fried banana thing (don't remember the name of it).\n\nI would definitely go back but probably not with a group (unless a special occasion).", "author": "Rachael C."}

With friendly service, refreshing Sangria, and captivating Peruvian flavors ...it's a no-brainer to come back.\n\nAt one point, our table looked very picturesque with all the vibrant colors of our small plates.  These tapas we shared include Chicharrones, Cebiche Pescado, Pulpito Bebe (baby octopus), sauteed spinach, squid ink Paella, beef hearts and chicken skewers.  The sauces in these were rich in color and taste.  \nWe also had the pan seared scallops...perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  I really wanted to order another plate for myself.  But I got hooked with the purple mashed potatoes - a pleasant accompaniment.     \nFor dessert, the passion fruit panna cotta won me over with it's creamy texture and arroz con leche sauce.  It's been a while since I've had really good panna cotta, like this.    \n \nI really need to find my way back to Bernal Heights. And when I do, Piqueos will be my first stop.

If you've never tried Peruvian food, this place is wonderful, located in Bernal Heights. We loved everything we ate. It's a great place to go before you catch a concert like what we did ( we were headed to see Gene Loves Jezebel At the DNA Lounge), food is not too heavy and the service is fast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-06", "description": "We were across the street doing happy hour when I decided to see what restaurants had openings for dinner and drinks. When Piqueo's popped up, I decided to take it. I made a reservation through OpenTable about 10 mins prior for a party of four on Saturday, March 31st at 5:45pm. We were wrapping up our meal at the current spot, so I called over to let them know we were running a little late. I ended up heading over first after we settled our bill.\n\n*Cebiche Pescado: Fresh Fish of the day, Aji Rocoto leche de tigre ($17.50)\n*Anticuches (skewers): Marinated in panca served with crispy potatoes & huacatay, Beef heart x1, Chicken x1 ($13.50 each)\n*Chicharrones: Slightly fried cebiche marinated base, salsa criolla & rocoto aioli, Chicken ($14)\n*Scallops Ficho: Pan seared Dayboat scallops, purple mashed potatoes, toasted nori & tongarashi ($17)\n*Pulpito Bebe: Baby octopus, papitas dorada & ocopa ($15.50)\n*Paella: Peruvian style seafood paella with Arborio rice in pimento-saffron base, Negra: with Squid ink ($26)\n*Sauteed Spinach: with garlic ($7)\n*Passion Fruit Panna Cotta: with arroz con leche sauce ($10)\n*Alfaiores: 2 Peruvian cookies filled with Dulce de Leche ($9)\n*Sangria: Red wine, Sparkling wine, fresh fruit and fruit juice ($32 pitcher)\n*Ochoa Moscatel (sweet) '13, Spain ($9)\n*Porto Feist - Tawny 10 Yr ($9)\n*Organic Peruvian Coffee ($4)\n\nSince I was left alone with a drink menu, I decided to get a pitcher of sangria. This was rather good. Not too fruity or sweet and nicely balanced. The glasses come with fruit inside, so it's not sitting in the sangria the whole time. My favorites of the dishes were the octopus and the beef heart. The octopus was tender with a slight chew. The beef heart nice and meaty. When we ordered the chicken, we actually thought it was chicken heart, so we were a little disappointed when it was just chicken. Our fault for not reading the menu correctly. I like a good paella, but I've found I'm not a huge fan of squid ink. It adds an earthiness I don't exactly like. But one of my girlfriends loves it, so I just deferred. We also got complimentary Purple potato chips and salsa, but I couldn't try them due to my deep fried food ban. I also couldn't try the chicharrones, which looked tasty. Out of the desserts, I enjoyed the panna cotta. Creamy, rich, and smooth. The after dinner drinks were small pours, but I wanted another drink, so my port did the trick. I did noticed we were charged $9.50 each instead of $9, so they really need to update their menu if they did a price increase.\n\nI adore Peruvian food so I'm glad I was finally able to check this spot out.", "author": "Elena N."}

Peru here I come! We began with an appetizer special of steamed mussels with\na lime cilantro sauce that was a light, refreshing way to start. Next, we moved on to the Aji de Gallina, stewed chicken breast in a creamy aji amarillo sauce, and served with marinated olives, a hard boiled egg and jasmine rice. It was a great dish, that reminded me vaguely of a yellow curry apple chicken dish my mother used to make. For a dish with a cream based sauce, it was rich, without being heavy. We followed that with the Churrasco, a medium rare New York steak served with chimichurri sauce and a side of yucca fries. The meat was cooked as ordered, which I was quite happy about, since I've been let done by quite a few restaurants in that department lately. I would have been pleased enough with it on its own at that point, but the chimichurri sauce brought it up a level from merely delicious to outstandingly exquisite. My wife ordered the 2016 Blanco Nivea Verdejo from Rueda, which she described as delicious- reasonably priced, and tasted much more expensive than it was. We had planned on getting dessert, but were too rotund to try try adding anything, even a Python-esque wafer thin mint.

We had at least the following, all of which were delicious. Pallta Rellena a delicious stuffed avacado. Tamal Ficha which has duck confit and olives. Churrasco - a NY Strip dish. Salmon Andino, Empanada. Adobo a delicious pork shoulder dish and Braised Lamb Shanks.\n\nEvery single dish was fantastic. The plainest ,meaning least flavorful, was the lamb shank.\n\nMy two outstanding favorites were the Pallta Rellena and the Adobo. Others were equally excellent but three days later these are the ones I recall the most.\n\nI noticed the restaurant has earned a Michelin recommendation. Get here quickly before they get their Michelin Star and two things happen: 1 They will get even more busy and you will need reservations months in advance. As it is we made ours weeks in  advance. and 2. They will justifiably increase their prices.\n\nThe wines, I am  not a wine drinker at all, were very well enjoyed by all.\n\nRegarding price feeding 8 adults is not a cheap experience in most places. So estimate $45 a head including wine. Eating with a large group is a great idea as you get to taste so many more dishes than just eating as a couple.\n\nIn the heart of Bernal Heights this is a rare find.", "author": "Peter K."}

There is so much arrogant service in SF, I really was looking forward to the unusually helpful and fun servers of years past. No way. Not now.\n\nThe scallops were yummy, pork decent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-24", "description": "First of all, one disclaimer. I am one of those obnoxious Peruvians that when they go to a Peruvian restaurant, nothing really satisfy them. Comments like 'this doesn't do justice to the real thing' or 'not the same' are not uncommon. If they don't say it out loud, they are definitely thinking it. \n\nHaving said that, Piqueos is amazing. It is the real thing and the mix of many different and rich flavours are definitely noticed here. Yes, like home!\n\nWe started by ordering a couple of glasses of wine. One tempranillo and one malbec. Usually when one goes to a restaurant, you can tell where the owner is making his money. Mediocre wine that you can tell you can buy the whole bottle for the price of one glass. While probably the economics of the wine we drank was the same at Piqueos, the quality of the wine was a lot better than the average. One can tell they spent a lot of time selecting them and both were very distinctive and complex with long lasting taste. The wine selection was just a nice introduction to de dedication to details I noticed to the whole dining experience. \n\nAs for the food, some general comments. Piqueos is closer to a tapas bar than to a large meal restaurant. The have a long selection and the good news is that even though it is tapas, the portions are not in miniature like other tapas bars I have visited. \n\nWe had a Quinoa salad that was really good. Each of the ingredients were super fresh and it had a semi sweet balsamic that made it delicious. \n\nWe also had the grilled hongos that cooked perfectly, which were accompanied by some arugula and a tartar sauce (similar to a mayonnaise but better). \n\nThe scallops were amazing. Grilled and not overcooked, just tender and tasty as they should be on a bed of lentils that added flavour to the dish without overpowering.  \n\nWe tried the Teque\u00f1os with avocado as well. It is a rather simple dish, but every time I try it, they always mess it up because people tend to make them in a hurry. I asked for them not for the flavour but as a point of comparison with other restaurants. That was not the case in Piqueos and I liked them a lot because they literally brought me childhood memories. That reinforced my belief that the staff at Piqueos are really paying attention to all the details. \n\nThe baby octopus was fantastic. Not too chewy, not too hard. They were just right and they are served with a fantastic sauce inspired in the anticuchos one can find in Lima. \n\nThe last dish was a corn cake, which was made with choclo grains (Peruvian corn), potato and cheese. Really memorable. \n\nAll in all a really good experience and I will be coming back to try the rest of the dishes in the menu.", "author": "Rodrigo B."}

I suspect this may be due to new management but am not sure. In any event, they've dramatically increased the prices and decreased the food quality. Several of our favorite dishes are gone and the ones that remain have clearly been revised for cost savings.

The waitstaff was very professional and all of the servers helped us not just our server. The menu was mostly tapas and small plates. There were a handful of other large plates or entree to select. We started off with some wine, both in the mid price range at 15 dollars a glass. The quality of the wine was quite good though, I got the tempranillo and my boyfriend the malbec. We shared the Andes salad which didn't have much queso fresco though did have a tasty dressing. We then had the baby octopus, which were very small and wonderfully tender, followed by the tequenos which were full of cheese and topped with powdered sugar. We shared the fried mushrooms which were deep fried goodness with a spicey mayonnaise based sauce. We also shared the pan seared scallops which were perfectly cooked on top of blue mashed potatoes.

Service was ok, but the staff could be more personable for these prices.  \nI don't think we'll come back again, Vega and Red Hill Station are much better choices around these parts.", "author": "Peggy L."}

One mid sized crab cake, order two, this is one of the items you don't want to share, difficult to describe not like your average crab cake definitely different is all I can say\n\nPulpito Bebe - Baby octopus, papitas dorada & ocopa. chewy but flavorful slightly vinegary I think I liked the Causa Tasting better then dish, there was more ummph in the Causa\n\nLomo Saltado - stir fried beef tenderloin, onions, tomatoes, cilantro & soy sauce served with fries and rice, had this dish at several other restaurants sadly this place it was not the best I had more of the passing grade, fries did not have that piping hot crunch in the bite, the beef was tender for me it was sliced to small, a tad to salty for me, mind you I know there is soy sauce with the sauce but it seemed a tad overkill on the meat, onions and tomatoes were standard, set it up this way and the saltiness will cease, grab a helpful scoop of rice, on top of the rice add the onions tomatoes, throw the beef tenderloin on it then get 3 tbps of that soy sauce and throw some fries on top\n\nSeco De Cordero - their version of braised lamb shank, it was good, not my favorite dish but it was good, tender, not too salty, meat portion wise was good for me I think I was looking for a more heartier sauce accompaniment. \n\ndefinitely recommend this place for first date, second date, anniversary, etc \n\nfood ****\nprice $$$\nservice *****\nambiance **** very dark but I prefer the dark", "author": "Clarence A."}

Hopefully the food has changed since then, since I can see good reviews.\n\nMaking this review on their Lomo Saltado/Lomito al Jugo solely. I remember ordering this dish and asking if it was possible to do this with chicken, which they so kindly said they could do. Unfortunately, I regret to say, this was possibly one of the worst peruvian dishes I've had. I felt that the sauce/soup was easily a campbells tomato soup poured onto the food. The fries felt like they were store bought from the frozen aisle--in all, the dish was terrible.\n\nI feel I'm being extremely critical as I come from LA and had excellent peruvian cuisine from many restaurants. I've also had the pleasure to go to very good peruvian restaurants in SF, that I must've paid the same amount for, without the \"terrible\" in it. While I hate to compare restaurants, I feel you should skip on Piqueos and go to Fresca and/or even Limon. It'll taste much better for possibly the same price.

Luckily we were able to place a reservation that same evening. Our table was fairly small, but it wasn't a big issue. The server here was friendly, and kept a good eye on us without being too intrusive. They started us with w/ complimentary deep fried garbanzo beans which were surprisingly good! Our yuca fries and baby octopus appetizer then came. Both were cooked nicely, and the octopus had a nice chargrilled flavor to it. We also had the ceviche mixto which had a variety of seafood (mussels, clams, shrimp, fish, etc.) and the sauce was perfect, and seafood was fresh. For our entrees, we had the lomo saltado & paella. Both were delicious, we was everything else we had. The paella is the more saucy, yellow saffron kind, rather than the dryer more orange type that I think is more common. I usually like the drier, orange kind but the one here was pretty good, and I loved that they gave a lot of seafood unlike other restaurants that give a lot more rice. I was so fill after the paella, I only took three bites of the lomo saltado. Of course we had to finish wth dessert. My boyfriend surprised me with the passion fruit panna cotta, which he snuck away and told our server that it was my birthday & they brought it out topped with a candle. It was sooo delicious & and plated beautifully. Oh, and the sangria was delicious! Our server also offered us a complimentary glass of wine after he accidentally poured an extra glass, which was sweet.

They are all different with different focus and names, but all leverage the Peruvian heritage embodied in Chef Altamirano. \n\nPiqueo's, although small and modest has a hostess on staff (at least on weekends) with mostly tables for 2 and 4. The food is inventive and fabulous, with a fusion of flavors that is becoming well known in nuevo-Peruvian cooking, perhaps popularized by the internationally known celebrity chef at Astrid y Gaston, Gaston Acurio. \n\nThe menu has a range of choices, with starters, tapas or small plates (about a dozen) and about 10 entrees as well. \n\nThe mix of Chinese, Japanese, Italian and Peruvian flavors is indicative of this new Peruvian cuisine, and we were very happy with our 6 choices, mostly tapas. Most of the small plates are in the $12 range, and the entrees in the $20 range. \n\nThere is a decent wine selection to choose from, although it is mostly bottle or glass sized, with good choices from Argentina and Chile.

It was a special place my mom and I would have empanadas (we shared cheese & spinach as well as the beef) and coffee after a mani/pedi at Bernal Nail Salon. It was also a place my bff and I often met at for wine & tapas, where my family and I took out of towners and the last restaurant my father dined at before his sudden passing in 2013. Thus, this restaurant has held a special place in my heart and belly. But not after today! My mom and I had our usual mani/pedi and decided to go for coffee and empanadas afterwards. We were told that we had to wait an hour for a table when there were plenty of empty tables. The hostess was nice, but our server, this short Latino guy, said that there was a large group coming in an hour, so we could be seated right away, but we had to be done in one hour. I was ready to leave, but my mom wanted to stay. While we were eating my mom shared that she felt looked down to by the waiter/short, Latino dude and she felt like maybe it was because we were in casual clothing and flip-flops. The FOOD: we had the yucca balls, the shrimp over sweet potato mash and the cheese & spinach empanadas. They were all just blah. I feel like the taste had definitely decreased in flavor and quality. I was very surprised to learn the chef is the same. Even the sauces, which are Peruvian specialties, we're not add good add they usually are. The prices have also gone up. The empanadas were $13 each.

The boy and I went for date night after making reservation the same day. We told them on Open Table about my Celiac Disease and that we would need to be sure that they could accommodate a safe dinning experience. We felt comfortable with our dining choice because of all of the good Yelp reviews about having many gluten free options. Well they sure lived up to it.\n\nWe arrived to find a gluten free menu already set at the table for us, and the waiter was extremely knowledgable and helpful about my options. We ordered 4 small plate options, and every dish was better than the last. We had the chicken avocado dish, the sweet corn with shrimp, the crab cake (yes a gluten free crab cake), and the scallops. Even though we ordered all of them at once, they were perfectly timed so that the dishes didn't overlap, and we were able to enjoy each one individually (one of my big pet peeves when ordering small plates is when you have 4 plates sitting at your table all at once and you don't get adequate time to enjoy one dish without the others getting cold). The waiters were attentive, filling water glasses often and offering new plates if old ones were covered in amazing sauce from the previous dish. \n\nEvery dish was perfectly cooked, so full of flavor and we basically licked the plate clean every time. While every dish was so amazing, I must say that the crab cake was so unique and delicious. I also haven't been able to eat a crab cake in 6 years, so deprivation might have had something to do with it. I would absolutely recommend this place for dinner dates.

Glad we tried this dish. \n*Lomo Saltado, one of the most perfect steak dishes I have had lately. Very tender and juicy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=fRarTyMkIQwSUPvlxcn2pg served with rice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=rXUxP-O36f4ObgXymUMO7w\n*Pulled Pork Sliders (Sliced for sharing): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=8rEHz8zJ8DfcR3HKp33uUA\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure we ordered those scallops again, although I forgot a pic this time, here is what it looks like from last time, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=B9LhaFNc3ifmt5TYcxJonA\n\nI love booking a table on Open Table and never having to wait.

We had set up a reservation on opentable and had our groupon ready...as soon as we walked in, our table was ready immediately.  \n\nWe were greeted with a couple of glasses of water and a small bowl of addicting fried chick peas.  The server recommended an excellent glass of wine for me while wifey had a glass of chimamosa.  Both were delish.  \n\nWe started off with the cebiche mixto...this appetizer was super tasty, fresh, and fun for my palate.  I loved the chunks of fish and the variety of seafood...and they weren't stingy.  Much better than Mochica if you ask me...\n\nFor our main dishes we ordered the adobo with sweet potato mash and the paella classica.  The adobo was surprisingly delish...I couldn't get enough of the sauce and the sweet potato mash complimented the meat perfectly.  Oh btw, the meat was absolutely tender and falling apart on your fork delicious.  The paella killed the one I had at mochica's...the seafood was plentiful.  The rice was cooked perfectly.  The seasoning was just right.  \n\nOur server was slammed but he still paced our meal well...no complaints there.  We skipped out on dessert though cause Mitchell's was calling out names...haha.  But next time I return, I will definitely try the dessert.  \n\n5 solid stars...loved our experience there...will return again!", "author": "Jen W."}

Tasty start to the meal. They tried (and failed) to clear our unfinished bowl of this when the cebiche came out ;-)\n\nCebiche - more irregular sized cuts of fish compared to La Costanera's version (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=3W7QU7eanoWETzJEUlB5ow). Lightly spicy with a nice mix of flavors from the leche de tigre. A couple of stringy membranes showed some sloppy knife-work.\n\nScallops, salsa panchita (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=EojlhH9szMeQC9Lx3bEKrQ). Based on our instructions of \"no cilantro in anything\", they subbed out the cilantro mashed potatoes for plain. The scallops were nicely seared and seasoned. My favorite of the night.\n\nTeque\u00f1os are like a Crab Rangoon with shrimp instead of crab. The diced shrimp & mozzarella are fried in wonton wrappers and come with some guacamole and a sweet purple corn (chicha morada) sauce with a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=0vsepYPRwNE_5Rr76Je4mg). This was tasty, but much more cheesy than shrimpy.\n\nBeef Empanada was odd. Instead of the typically formed pastry around the filling in a half-moon shape that you can see in other pictures, this was  rectangular puff pastry simply folded in half over a triangular mix of the filling in the center part (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=qTqHOYuF1XqSC6I3MVdTdQ). The outer triangles had nothing but nicely cooked puff pastry and the inner section with the filling had undercooked puff pastry trying to hide under the dusting of sugar. The meat was tender in a very sweet sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vsiJDU-0_cdYrf1Otawtbw?select=te8s6RGpM9-ESHRbMLUu3g). I picked the meat out of the unappetizing pastry shell.\n\nCebiche: 3.5 stars\nScallops: 4.5 stars\nTeque\u00f1os: 3.5 stars\nEmpanada: 2 stars\n\nOverall: 3.5 stars.

So, if you're trying a new one, no tasting, just full commitment.\n\nI had the scallop appetizer, and it was the best thing I had that night. The scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly, which seems to happen so rarely. The purple mash that came with them was similar to something i make at home, but it was good. I only wish the red onion hadn't been so mixed in. I hate red onion, and the restaurant is somewhat dimly lit, making it hard to pick it out.\n\nFor entrees we shared: the Lomo Saltado, and the Aji de Gallina (on the server's rec.)\nBoth were underwhelming. The steak in the lomo saltado was mushy, and it had more chunks of unripe tomatoes than anything else. \nUgh, please restaurants stop serving tomatoes out of season, they're so unappetizing! The dish tasted like soy sauce, and not much else.\n\nThe Aji de Gallina was the better of the two, but still a bit bland.\n\nI did appreciate that as soon as my friend told them she had celiac, they brought her a menu with the gluten free items highlighted.\n\nWhile nothing was bad, nothing was very impressive.

Our experience was really good so I decided to try it again for a group of 5 of us. We made a 7:00PM reservation last evening, a Friday. We arrived on time and were seated around 7:10. \n\nThe food, as with our previous experience was quite good. We all had wine with some excellent appetizers, main courses and dessert. The check came, we provided our credit cards, signed the bill and were wrapping things up. \n\nAs the waiter picked up our final signed bill and thanked us, the hostess appeared. She abruptly said: \"You have to leave now... I have people waiting for this table.\" Note this was at 8:40, exactly 1  1/2 hours after being seated... Her tone was very cold and very rude.   We were all in shock. \n\nAs we left the restaurant, I commented to her that I had never experienced such treatment in a San Francisco restaurant and that I would not be return. She looked up at me and in a dismissive tone of voice said: \"Sorry!\" Her actions totally ruined a nice evening for all of us.\n\nWhat was even more interesting is that as we walked out, we noticed that there was no one standing waiting for a table!\n\nI will never return to Piqueos and would never recommend going.", "author": "john r."}

Also, Mochica (which I still need to try) and La Costanera (in Half Moon Bay, another 5 star) have the same owner as Piqueos. \n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "Karen G."}

In our San Francisco \"adaptation\" of the Andes, you'll run into narrow a$$ streets and numerous one ways.  To the inexperienced eye, streets appear like spitting images of each other.  Electing to hike up from Mission Street will leave you sweaty en route to your destination resulting in wobbly legs.  The extra minutes driving in circles lost, like in my case, will be worth it.  \n\nPiqueo's is a Peruvian restaurant.  Very trendy and chic, all of things I don't really know much about.  Foolishly, I find myself gravitating towards this place.  Finally seeing the little sign on the corner restaurant, the trek felt like finding that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.     \n\n\"Any wine or sangria?\" the waitress asked.  Any normal person would order wine or sangria at a tapas BAR.  Oh no, not me.  I inquired about iced tea.  Our waitress probably thought \"You serious?\"  Since I'm a light weight (alcohol tolerance wise), I just stuck with water.  The sangria sounded good (next time!) when I looked over at the other table.  I could see myself bumper car-ring my way out of Bernal Heights drunk on sangria.  That wouldn't be good for my insurance.  \n\nWith so many tapas choices, we only chose one, the papa rellena.  Think an egg fashioned deep fried potato ball with meat inside.  Sitting in a decorative pond of mole-like green sauce, it was accompanied with a mix of greens and salsa.  Meat on the inside kept the potato from being too dry as the surrounding sauce also became an excellent dip.  I wish we had another.  \n\nIf our main dishes weren't as good, I would have regretted not getting more tapas.  With meat on our minds, we got the lomito al jugo and the churrasco.  The lomito al jugo (their lomo saltado) is loaded with chunks of beef tenderloin topped with skinny fries with a yellow drizzly sauce carried a soy sauce flavor light accented in the meat.  What's churrasco?  I don't know, but apparently, it's what they coin as a New York steak.  It was perfectly cooked medium upon request.  Picture this: meat so clean, a butter knife could cut through it.  Those yucca fries partnered with the steak weren't too bad themselves.  Smothered in very decorative and delectable sauces, it was an ideal starch to the meat.      \n\nPiqueo's modern picture of Peruvian food is a framework masterpiece.  High five to the owner and chefs on a well executed operation and a job well done.  I doubt I'll ever get a chance to explore the Andes Mountains, but I will definitely come back here.", "author": "Arnold T."}

It was after all Saturday night and the place we originally tried to go to was booked up for the entire evening. Luckily for us, we happened into Piqueo's.

Piqueo's brings a bit downtown aura to this area.\n\nThis restaurant labels itself as a tapas place but the portions are actually pretty generous. The menu is dizzyingly extensive, with probably about 40 dishes being offered from appetizers, tapas plates, entrees, sides, salads, etc.  Given the offerings on the menu, it took us awhile to choose. Also, quite a few tweaks are needed on the chef's part taste-wise. The presentation looks nice on the plate, albeit heavy handed on the sauces. \n\nI was excited to start the evening with a nice chilled glass of sangria.  Fruity enough for my taste, but at $8 a glass, I was only given a half full one.  (or half-empty, you decide). Either way, I was not pleased with the serving.\n\nThe complimentary fried chickpeas is # 82 on the Big Eats SF list. Crunchy chickpeas mixed with white corn, salty feta, finely chopped red onions and lime. You won't miss bread and butter with this healthy starter.\n\nThe ceviche mixto ($16) had mussels, octopus, shrimp and halibut, served with white corn and roasted sweet pepper on the side. The lime juice and red onions make for a sour-slightly spicy taste that I liked. Ingredients were fresh but for really good ceviche, try La Mar. \n\nThe grilled NY steak ($28) needed more seasoning. It was also tough to cut and the adobo sauce it was served on was lackluster. \n\nThe fried plantains ($6) were sauteed in brown sugar and butter, topped with powdered sugar. This is more soft than crispy but still good.\n\nI was curious about the Tequenos ($12) which is pastry dough filled with shrimp and mozz cheese, fried and topped with powdered sugar and honey. Crispy and honestly, not too sweet, but you know what? the sauce they used on this was the exact same one for the next dish! Our empanditas de mi abuela were filled with slices of tender beef and melted cheese. Very good, but having this dish right after the tequenos, it kinda tasted the same. \n\nCamarones al ajo had succulent shrimp brimming with garlic flavor, thanks to the sofrito garlic paste it was cooked in.  Served with baguettes topped with mild salsa.\n\nThe duck quesadilla with goat cheese was probably the favorite of the night. At this point, we were already full, but I couldn't stop eating this!\n\nService was inconsistent but we didn't have to wait long for our dishes. Our waiter who started us off with our meal was probably on the end of his shift, he brought out the first couple of dishes and disappeared. A second server took over for him. But there wasn't any transition between the two which was kinda confusing.\n\nOverall, Piqueo's has room for improvements. If they scale down their menu to focus more on select dishes and improve on their service, this could be a really great neighborhood restaurant.", "author": "Janice C."}

So easy street parking and less crowded.\nReservation: I took reservation for 11 people through Open Table. We were seated not in the main restaurant but way at the back. It seemed like a storage turned into a seating area. It was very dimly lit and even on a cold SF day, we were all feeling extremely warm there. There was no air conditioning in that area. \nService: It was flaky. The server came to take our orders once and forgot us for a long time. We literally had to call out for him. Finally, after much wait, we could go ahead with our order. Over the course of the evening, service was not that great. It was okay. \nDrinks: We had sangria, wine, beer and so on. Sangria was a little diluted and was not the best. It seemed like I was having a glass of red juice with fruits. The wine collection was definitely better.\nFood: This was the best part of the restaurant and deserved all stars for it. We ordered calamaris, crab cakes, pork adobo, pulled pork, some chicken, mushrooms, ahi tuna fish dish, ceviche, yucca balls, plantain, lamb chop, seafood paellas and so much more. Every dish was delicious and was simply mouthwatering good. I loved the pulled pork and the crab cake and the seafood paellas was to die for. \nOur bill was a freaking $700 + dollars, but was worth it with such amazing food. \nSo overall, go there for the food, not the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "This is more a Latin fusion restaurant - they have things on the menu like \"fried wonton shrimp.\" I wouldn't go here if you're looking for an authentic Peruvian meal. The food is okay but generally everything is over-sauced. As in drenched and dripping, which makes it difficult to figure out if the actual food is good quality, cooked/flavored well, etc because all you can taste is sauce. Some things are also oddly sweet, and not in a good way - for example, powdered sugar dusted on some of the savory dishes, typically savory meat dishes in sweet marinade. Very limited wine list.\n\nService isn't great - we waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to give us water, another 15 minutes before someone took our order. I thought plate service was strange too - they brought out the dishes one by one, as if each one were its own course. If this is how tapas is supposed to be served, please excuse my ignorance, but when it's small plates and you're with a party of five, it is annoying for everyone to get a bite then wait, get a bite then wait, get a bite then wait 12 times over. And it takes forever. I think a few dishes at a time would've made more sense and the meal more enjoyable. Plus it would've turned the tables faster and the restaurant could accommodate more customers.\n\nIt's a cute, small space and the ambiance is nice; tables are a little too close together.

I was pleased to be able to make a reservation for 2 on a Saturday afternoon for that evening; I wanted to take a friend out for her birthday dinner, and this seemed the perfect opportunity to try Piqueo's. Indeed, the food was delicious, but I will never go back, and here is why:\n\nAt 7 pm (our reservation) our table was not ready, which was fine as my friend was running a few minutes late. She arrived, and we waited for a larger party to be seated, and then were shown to our table at 7:15. The service was prompt; we took the waiter's recommendations and ordered 4 items off the tapas menu, which were all excellent, along with a couple of beers. We had a nice meal, and declined dessert, as we were pretty full from the rich tapas, and then paid the check which had arrived immediately after declining dessert.\n\nMy friend still had about a third of her beer left in her glass when the hostess leaned over and told us that she was sorry, but our table was needed for another reservation so we had to leave. Startled, we started gathering our things and my friend guzzled the rest of her beer. I checked my watch: 8:07. We had occupied the table for less than an hour and we were already being hustled out the door. At that point the crowd had actually thinned and there didn't appear to be anyone waiting for a table, and in fact there were other empty tables.\n\nWay to ruin an evening! Needless to say, we felt like crap having been so summarily tossed out and made to feel so unwelcome.  What had started out as such a nice evening ended very abruptly and badly. I have never been treated this way by any restaurant staff in SF or elsewhere and still can't believe that this is acceptable treatment anywhere.

After being outside in the cold and reading the menu on the window, we were sold with the heavenly-sounding entrees. \n\nBecause there were two of us, we were seated right away near the entrance and began perusing the menu, unsure of what to choose - everything sounded amazing...from causas to cebiche to octopus and more, we had to have the waiter come over to help us decide. After selecting the paella clasica and slow-braised lamb (seco cordero), we then began inspecting the funny-looking circular appetizers in front of us. Apparently they are chickpeas, but it was almost like crack popcorn, and we couldn't stop eating them...a sign that we couldn't wait to eat our meal.\n\nAfter waiting for a while, the entrees came out looking and smelling fantastic. The lamb was very tender, falling off the bone, and also came with white beans that were nice and soft. I was surprised b/c I actually got more lamb than I initially thought. My lovely date ordered the paella, which had just the right amount of spice that gives that peppery taste at the end, and it was pretty populated with different kinds of seafood, which we appreciated. AND we ended up with leftovers. Nice.\n\nOverall, a fair-priced and delicious meal that I cannot wait to go back to so as to try some of the tapas!", "author": "Brandon Y."}

Everytime I get them, it's always dry on the inside.  This wasn't like that.  Oh wow!!!  Nice outer crust and beautiful meat inside.  Yum!!!\n\nCeviche with shrimp, mussels, and snapper.  I think I've become a ceviche fan.  Just perfection!  Really.  Perfect acidity balanced with flavor while showcasing the proteins themselves.  \n\nThese were my top two of the eight dishes that we ate that evening.

Piqueo's, like it's sister restaurant, Mochica, just offers the best possible Peruvian dishes I have experienced.\n\nPiqueo's plating of dishes is different from that of Mochica's but it still delivers the same great taste.  \n\nThe dishes that captivated me the most were:\nCreamy Mushroom Potato Soup - $8\nPulpito Bebe - Complimentary\nBeef Empanada Peruana - $8\nChurrasco A La Parilla - $24\nCebiche Mixto - $16\nSuspiro A La Limena - $8\n\nThe dishes that were good but just OK to me were:\nChicharronnes De Pollo - $12\nCalamar Relleno - $19\n\nThe Creamy Mushroom Soup was just fantastic.  It was rich, thick, and had an overpowering taste of mushroom and potato that just had me wanting more and more.  It could be that my love for mushrooms and potatoes superseded an unbiased thought from me, but who cares.  It tasted good to me!\n\nMy table was later introduced to the Beef Empanada Peruana, Cebiche Mixto, and Churrasco A La Parilla.  The beef empanada was good.  The outer crust was crunchy.  The beef was tender and hinted a bit of sweetness in it that reminded me of my grandmother's empanadas from long ago.  The Cebiche Mixto was extraordinary.  And, the Churrasco A La Parilla was classic.  The strip of beef was just done perfectly and the yucca fries that came with it were just incredible.\n\nWe were later given a complimentary order of Pulpito Bebe that we humbly accepted.  I love octopus!  I definitely appreciated their gesture of kindness since octopus is one of my favorite dishes.  That gesture of kindness though led us to loosen our belts just a little as the meal progressed.\n\nWe finished our meal with the Chicharronnes De Pollo and Calamar Relleno.  The Calamar Relleno is a giant squid filled with Spanish chorizo.  I'm not a big fan of giant squids.  They usually taste rubbery and tough to me.  Fortunately, Piqueo's delivered something pretty edible that tasted decent.  I don't know how we did it, as stuffed as we were, but we managed to finish a flavorful Chicharronnes De Pollo.  It had a bit of kick to it, I have to admit.  It could have knocked me out since I was so full.\n\nAs full as the three of us were, we still managed to share a dessert, the Suspiro A La Limena.  It was nothing original but it tasted wonderful.\n\nPiqueo's, to me, is what small San Francisco restaurants have always been - an intense environment that caters to adventurous palates.  Piqueo's is a great place to take a date, enjoy a meal with friends or family, or dine alone at the counter as you overlook your meal being cooked by the chef.  Piqueo's epitomizes what Bernal Heights has become.  Simply, cool!", "author": "Jules S."}

I have been a little obsessed with Peruvian food ever since the first time I tried ceviche and lomo saltado just a year ago. The flavors are just so well balanced and I don't think I could ever get sick of it! \n\nWe tried the ceviche pescado, beef heart skewer, shrimp curry, beef short rib with a red wine sauce, and seared scallops. Every dish was pretty phenomenal, but standouts were the seared scallops, shrimp curry, and beef short rib. Each of those sauces were just packed with flavor. Really great dishes to try if you've never had Peruvian food! \n\n-Seared scallops were perfectly cooked, nice char on the outside (not burnt) and just cooked on the inside. The sauce carried a hint of heat but didn't overpower the scallops.\n-Shrimp curry had great flavor as well. The curry sauce I could not get enough of! \n-Beef short rib, again, had great flavor! Not overly salty in the sauce, which had just the slightest hint of tartness. Couldn't get enough of this sauce either! The short rib could have been just a tad more tender though, but that's just my personal preference. \n-Ceviche was great too, but a little on the acidic and spicy side. It left our mouths burning a little and definitely wanting some bread to calm the heat. \n-Beef heart skewer was good texture-wise. Flavor wise it reminded me a little bit of teriyaki beef jerky, but with a little more gaminess and chipotle-like heat. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try more dishes, especially the seafood paella and aji de gallino. \n\nMake a reservation, the place is pretty small and gets packed.", "author": "Grace C."}

The waiter came over about 2-3 times asking if we wanted anything to drink or order within the space of about 10-15 minutes. The 2nd or 3rd time he seemed to be getting annoyed, leaving quickly even as we started discussing what we might want. No one was really making decisions yet. Finally he stopped coming by for about 10-15 minutes. I actually caught the waiter rolling his eyes as the one most boisterous friend started making jokes. I know we weren't the easiest group to wait on, but hey, rolling eyes is totally rude! Finally someone in our group just ordered food for everyone. As far as I recall the waiter never came by again and never asked if we needed any more drinks or food. I believe one of my friends went to ask the hostess to bring over a birthday dessert with a candle which was nice. The food was ok, pretty fried for the most part.

Oh wait...never mind, there's MaggieMudd...where the hell are we?\n\nBernal Heights is not really a neighborhood you can just stumble upon ....you have to make a very specific detour in, for me, relatively unchartered waters. Driving up Cortland from either side of the hill, if feels like you've landed in Hooterville as reimagined by Stephen King. Even the excessive windiness there brings an eerie feeling of isolation. And lots of dogs...and smiling dog walkers. Kinda like a cult....know what I mean?\n\nInto this palpable atmosphere are a sprinkling of culinary gems like Liberty Cafe and Little Nepal. This is a new one for me, and I liked it. I liked it a lot. If Destino is your cup of pisco, then you need to try Piqueo's. It's higher-end Peruvian, and I think the small plates are the way to go, at least the first time, to get a broad sampling of their food.\n\nI went with my friends Jonathan and Syd last night, and while calling them food snobs would be the pot belly calling the kettle fat, I know the palate plateau is raised every time we go out. The first plate served was the $8 Choritos ala Chalanaca - three New Zealand mussels topped with chopped tomatoes and onions, those big Peruvian kernels of white corn, and slathered in a special lime juice. It's been so long since I've had the meaty NZ mussels that it was heaven on a designer plate even if it was a bit overflowing in the juice.\n\nThe second plate was the $9 Pollito, which were chunks of fried chicken - very fresh-tasting chicken with papitas doradas and a spicy tartar sauce. This was absolutely the dish of the night. If KFC was reinvented by Michael Mina, I am confident this would be it. This was followed by the $10 Pastelito de Choclo, probably the safest bet among the small plates. It's one robust corn cake made up with softened potatoes and those same big white kernels, mixed with saffrito and a Mexican white cheese with a fresh salsa on top.\n\nThe $10 Tomatoes Rellenos was our last plate - a baked tomato stuffed with piquilo and mozzarella cheese served with yet another different tangy salsa. Believe it or not, with just these four plates plus the ramekin of special Peruvian beans and other spreadable paraphernalia served with our bread at the beginning, the three of us were pretty satisfied leaving just enough room for dessert, again my biggest downfall. \n\nBut Piqueo's has at least two excellent desserts. One is the $8 Flan de Camote - a total rethink of the classic Mexican flan where they somehow blend in sweet potatoes. The taste is there, and the consistency a bit heavier as a result. But it works magically especially with the orange-canela sauce. The other is the $9 Torta de Chocolate, a perfectly prepared little chocolate cake, moist but not runny and served with a combination of lucuma ice cream (just a tad too frozen but tasty) and caramel sauce. Lucuma is a tropical fruit native to Peru and hard to describe (I think they have it at Mitchell's too)...mmm, good. A nice wine to accompany the meal is the $32 Tempranillo, a Spanish wine from the Rivola winery with a nice, full-bodied cabernet body. Nice finish to it.\n\nStuffed. Completely. Total bill came to about $47 per person - which we thought was pretty fair given the stellar quality. And the place is nicely decorated with warm colors in a small space with an open kitchen. Service was very attentive, maybe a tad too intrusive during the meal as the three of us were more enraptured with the food than each other. A real dazzler. Not us. Piqueo's.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...not sure about authenticity...I seem to recall guinea pigs on a stick in Cuzco, but hell, I liked the dishes here...a lot\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...smallish but nicely decorated, a warm vibe, probably even better when it's pitch black outside given all the windows (vs. the vault-like feel of Destino)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...like I said, attentive is an understatement here...even the busboys who could be paid by the plate\nTOTAL - 5 stars...always room for another Peruvian treat destination in the city...Vietnamese is so five minutes ago", "author": "Ed U."}

Bought a $50 coupon off Bloomspot and figured why not try it now?\n\nWe've been to their sister restaurant, Mochica, a few months ago and had a great experience.  Food and service were great, so we figured this place wouldn't be too far from that.  \n\nMy boyfriend is a big fan of Mac and Cheese, so we ordered one for appetizers.

Needless to say, they did have similar items on their menu.   I was determined to try their seafood paella, because I thought it was the safest and best dish to try to compare the two places.  \n\nAdobo turned out better than I expected.  You can taste that it's been braised and sitting in their sauce.  It was paired with a sweet potato mash, which I've never had before, but tasted great since sweet potato is my fave!  The pork by itself may taste a bit too meaty, but the taste balances out together with the sweet mash.\n\nThe paella on the other hand, was not to expectation.  It didn't come out on the hot, iron plates like usual.  It was good, but not great.  Seafood portion was generous, but not enough rice.  Not a good thing for my boyfriend....good enough for me.  \n\nOverall, I think this restaurant is mediocre and its location is a bit out of the way.", "author": "Nancy S."}

Unfortunately the staff there is not capable of reliably managing reservations.\n\nHere is my last story: I make a reservation at 6pm for a party of 3 at 7.30 via open table. At 6.30 I get an e-mail that my reservation has been cancelled w/o any explanation. So I call Piqueo's why my reservation has been cancelled and they say because I didn't pick up my phone when they called back (that's only the 1st terrible mistake), after telling the hostess that I am planning on coming with my guests she says she'll fix it. When we show up the place is busy and there is no reservation. The hostess claims she never talked to me on the phone and blames it on Open Table. Even though I recognize her voice. This is not the first time  a reservation goes wrong, therefore I one star it is. Piqueo's fix your reservations and I'll be happy to come back.", "author": "Jacques C."}

I've been to Piqueo's sister restaurants (Mochica, La Costanera) but never made it to Piqueo's until tonight.  Service was consistently friendly and timely throughout - from the warm greeting walking in to plate clearing in between tapas dishes and water glasses consistently refilled. If we were deep in conversation, the staff backed off and returned later to avoid interrupting.\n\nDishes were spot-on.  6pm reservations on a Thursday and seated right away.  We had:\n\n1) Ceviche de Pescado: refreshing! Did not mind the addition of red onion (thinly sliced) and yams.\n\n2) Costillita tapas (short ribs): Delicious! The tenderly braised meat was accompanied by polenta-like yucca and a scrumptious tomato sauce.\n\n3) Fried yucca balls: Stuffed with cheese, meats and veggies. Filling!  Served with 2 different sauces on the plate.\n\n4) Suspiro dessert - absolutely exquisite! Fresh, light and the perfect way to end dinner. Highly recommend! And I'm not a dessert fan usually.\n\nWe also had a red wine by the glass - the name escapes me now.  I asked for a taste first and our waitress graciously opened a new bottle table-side.\n\nOverall, Piqueos is a hidden gem in the Bernal Heights area and I'll definitely be back!", "author": "M G."}

We look over the menu and decide on Cebiche Chino, Pollo al Mani, and Paellas Clasico.\n\nThey give a free appetizer of fried garbanzo beans.  I thought they were pretty good, nice and crunchy.\n\nOur cebiche comes out, and it was really flavorful.  Ahi tuna in a tangy, peppery marinade, with some huge Peruvian corn kernels.  Pretty happy so far....but then we wait.\n\nand wait....\n\nand wait....\n\nI think they realize we've waited awhile so they put a second plate of garbanzo beans.

While we are waiting, the table next to us (who ordered AFTER us) has their food, and is halfway through their meal.  Same situation to with the couple on the other side of us.  Obviously the kitchen works.  Frustrated, we ask if we can just have our two other dishes to-go.  Then we wait...\n\nand wait...\n\nThey give us a bill...\n\nand wait....\n\nand wait...\n\n20 minutes AFTER getting our bill, and a total of AN HOUR AND 25 MINUTES after ordering, we have our food to-go.\n\nWe asked for an explanation, and they worker said it was because we a) ordered two entrees b.) we asked our food to-go halfway through the meal c.) it is tapas style, so usually meals take longer and d.) they are dealing with groupons.  We more than willing to wait for food, but SAY SOMETHING.  You can't have customers sitting for 30 minutes with the waitress not checking in, or giving an update.  And how does putting an order to-go take longer, when the chef puts the food on a plate, and the waiter dumps it into a container?!?!

However having lettuce and raw onions on top made it an unusual paella, at least quite different from what I have had in Spanish restaurants.\n\nThe restaurant looks very nice inside though; lighting, color of the wall, the bar, it's one of the better, newer looking neighborhood restaurants I've been to.", "author": "Tadaa T."}

Very misleading menus on their website, where beer/wine prices are posted about 30 percent less expensive than they are in the restaurant- house wine and some glasses listed at 6/7, but nothing less than $11 on their menu?!

Seemed very dishonest, to lure people in with a bait and switch...  Similarly non-transparent was to charge when we asked for a bit more of the complimentary garbanzo app (we had ordered other apps too).  All of this left a very bad taste in our mouth unfortunately, enough so that I won't return to their sister restaurants either.

I had a Groupon voucher and made reservations via Open Table; made a note that I had a Groupon. The service was great! I wasn't treated like a second-class citizen with my Groupon and I really appreciate that in a business. Our server was awesome; he was attentive but not overly so. He must have spidey-senses because he seemed to intuitively know when we needed his services and he wasn't always just popping in to ask how we were doing.\n\nWe started off with a pitcher of Sangria that was well crafted. It was a good blend of fruitness and red wine (and stronger than it tasted - sneaky!). Our first appetizer was the Anticuchones (beef heart) that was quite tasty and unique. Beef heart isn't a typical dish (unless you go to a super-asian restaurant, from my experience). \n\nOur second appetizer was the Cebiche Mixto and this was totally delicious. There was red snapper, shrimp, clams, and mussels. I don't know if this sounds weird or not, but the seafood was not too fishy tasting which means that the ingredients were fresh. That's always a plus. This was the best dish of the night.\n\nThe paella negra is made with squid ink. I am a fan of paella, but in this case, I didn't think the squid ink added to much to the dish. It is also a liability - I wouldn't recommend it for a night with a (new) date, unless you're comfortable with someone seeing your teeth and lips (and fingers, to remove the shellfish shells) turn black. It's temporary and you can wipe your mouth/drink water... but still, just be aware. Lastly, we ordered the Flan con Quinoa and that was also just so-so; not really a dish I would recommend.\n\nI also have to mention that all of our dishes includes roasted corn kernels (like classy corn nuts) and steamed corn. But let me tell you, the steamed corn kernels were huge! If you were a giant, they would seem like regular-sized kernels. I really enjoyed the oversized kernels... they were fun to eat! Additionally, the presentation of the dishes was well-done; they were little pieces of edible art.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable time but I don't know if I would come back given the price point.", "author": "Kim T."}

The kitchen is open and right in the center of the restaurant, so it can get WARM in there. \n\nMy husband and I ordered four small plates from the tapas menu and it was too much food. We brought some home and were still overstuffed.  We would have been full off of just three plates.  They brought the plates out one at a time, timed pretty perfectly to arrive just when we had finished the previous plate. After the first two plates, though, the staff couldn't seem to remember how many more we should be getting because they kept asking if we were still waiting for another plate.\n\nThe yucca balls and pulled pork sandwich were our favorites. The crab cake was kind of meh--large, but not especially flavorful anf with big potato chunks inside. The scallops had a good flavor and were tender, but they were not deliciously flaky/melty and the whole dish was WAY oversalted.

It's the kind of place that I'd want to deem as my \"go-to\" based on aesthetics themselves. \n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience didn't live up to the hype. Our server, while friendly, was rather judgmental. Given that our Bloomspot was worth $50 bucks, and neither of us were drinking, we decided to try a bunch of different things to which we were asked, \"Are you sure you want that much? That's a lot of food!\" Umm #judging much? Yes, I am the fattest skinny girl ever- get over it.\n\nWe were disappointed that some of the items on the online menu were not actually available. (Duck paella- the item I had my heart set on, could not be made the night we were there). \n\nWe ordered:\n\n1) Some sort of cebiche- of which the boyfriend ate all by himself. I don't like the stuff personally, so I can't comment.\n\n2) Camarones al Ajo- these were fine, but nothing special. It also made me kinda sad that for $15 bucks I got 3 shrimp.

Surprisingly the space was very small, but had a cosy neighborhood feel with an open kitchen. It was packed with people even on a week day, which was definitely a good sign.\n\nComplimentary bowl of fried corn and chickpeas is served on the table, a delight!\n\nGoing with Yelp reviews we made safe choices. Ordered :\n\n1. Duck quasidilla - $14, served 3 portions of good sizes with mint and mango chutney on top, a flavorful bite and very filling.\n\n2. Seafood paella classica - $22,  Goshhh, the dish was filled with plentiful clams, calamari, fish, prawns. Ohhh so good! Seafood lovers - here it is!!\n\n3. Adobo pork - $19,  Again big FAT portion! The meat was so tender it melted in the mouth. The chocolatey sauce made the dish a perfect 10!! Best was the mashed sweet potato served on the side, which we couldn't stop licking clean.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1. This is the 1st tapas place where the portions served were a LOT!! Just couldnt finish the dishes, so had to get the leftovers to-go. Maybe we made the right choices for our hungry and starved tummy.\n\n2. Service was very attentive and highly satisfactory.\nWorth mentioning here, on informing our server about the voucher we had the staff was very professional in telling us that the voucher will be taken care of in the bill. This was a relief as in many places when you show discount coupons the business refuses to recognize the voucher or choose not to give good service. But this place was an exception! Even with discount coupon you are not treated cheap but like a king!!\n\n3. Easy parking in the area at 8, as its in a laid back neighborhood and lot of street parking around.\n\n4.

Service was also handled by a very capable young Spanish speaking lady.\n\nWe tried a little of everything and each time a dish was passed my way, I was thrilled at how delicious each creation tasted and washed down so well with Matt's selection of liquid grapes (Mas Malbec).  \n\nEven the paella was scrumptious!!

With a couple of inconsequential exceptions, the food was outstanding and impressively creative.  Soon after our arrival, a pitcher of amazing sangria and a zesty quinoa salad were set before us.  The salad combined the earthy taste of the quinoa and Peruvian corn, the subtle sweetness of tomato and onion and the slightly kick of the aji amarillo vinaigrette.   We knew more goodness was in store.\n\nOur favorite hot dishes were the chicken thighs with a mole-style sauce and yucca, a (reportedly, for I didn't partake) succulent lamb shank, and the incredibly addictive macaroni and cheese with bacon and a spicy, creamy huancaina sauce.   Long after these dishes were consumed we received the a forgotten plate of ham-and-cheese stuffed yucca, a hearty treat that makes for ideal (if sinful) finger food.\nOur sole disappointment in the meal was the absence of the sanguchon (pulled pork), a favorite of our companions and, apparently, too many others, as they'd run out before we arrived.\n\nFor dessert, we dove into the chocolate lava cake.  Enough said, really...it was fabulous, and was crowned with a homemade ice cream crafted from a Peruvian fruit, the name of which my sangria-addled brain cannot recall.\n\nOur server was aloof, indifferent and nearly invisible, as we went nearly half an hour without a visit, empty water glasses and more on the table.   I look forward to trying another round of new dishes on my next visit, hopefully accompanied by more attentiveness from the staff.", "author": "Derek W."}

The only detractions were 1) The service was a little slow, both initial approach and between the courses; and 2) The dessert wasn't very good. We had the Dulce de Leche with port whipped cream.  I think it would have been much better if it hadn't been dusted with cinnamon.  Cinnamon did not go with the caramel flavor OR the port in the whipped cream.  It was also incredibly sweet (though we were warned about that).  without the cinnamon and a higher cream to pudding ratio, it probably would have been excellent.\n\nWe want to try the chocolate cake next time.", "author": "P K."}

And at home it is - the deep, wine-dark walls and clean styling work well in the space, creating a cozy yet modern feel. \n\nThe service was genuine & friendly from the minute we walked in the door (1/2 hour before closing, with no reservation), and our server was very knowledgeable about the dishes and made some very good recommendations.\n\nWe started our meal with an order of the baby octopus which was amazing both in flavor & presentation (see photos).  The sauce was tasty & smoky and the potatoes were topped with 3 different colorful sauces, each with a bit of a kick at the end.  It was a very unique dish, definitely a signature of the restaurant.  We also shared the Choclo Peruano, or fried corn ball, which was very good, and the Chicken Empanada which was excellent - a must-have.  Juicy chicken mixed with raisins in a tender crust sprinkled with powdered sugar - divine!\n\nFor my main course, I had the Lamb Chops, which were extremely tender (I barely had to chew) and cooked perfectly, in a wine sauce and on top of a bean/vegetable mixture.  The beans were great - the veggies reminded me a little of succotash, but still tasted very good.  My husband had the Aji de Galina, or shredded chicken in sauce, which was spicy and delicious.\n\nThere are a number of wines and beer to choose from, or for something really interesting and different, try the chicha morada, a drink made with purple corn.  \n\nWe were too full for dessert, but I know I will be back soon, and I am looking forward to seeing what else Piqueo's has to offer.

It looks very clean and the service was excellent.  Our server was very friendly and fast.\n\nMany years ago, when there were only very few peruvian restaurants in the bay area, none of them offered piqueos (tapas).  And still now, i think this is one of the few places that offer a wide variety of small plates.  And i love this because sometimes, i want to try a lot of little bites of everything.\n\nThe menu i think has recently changed, but a couple of weeks ago, we ordered, of course, piqueos:\n\n1. Chuletita Alberto:  Perfectly cooked and delicious.\n\n2. Cebiche de pescado:  It tasted just like a cebiche in Lima... and that is very hard to find in the bay area.  For me, it was the perfect combination of spicy and sour.  It came with a bit of typical canchita and peruvian corn.\n\n3. Humita Dulce:  A delicious fusion of a peruvian sweet humita and curry sauce...  loved it.  The humita had the perfect texture.\n\n4. Peruvian crab cake:  I wasn't going to order this because it's not a typical peruvian dish, but i'm glad we did.  It was very good.\n\n5. Pastel de Choclo: Very yummy corn cake, typical peruvian piqueo.  \n\n6: Chocolate cake with Pisco Ice Cream:  the chocolate cake was to die for.  The ice cream was good, but i honestly did not feel the pisco taste.\n\nOh, and that house chickpea spicy thing is very very good.  Even though i have never eaten a chickpea aj\u00ed in Per\u00fa, the flavor of the mix was definitely peruvian.  Loved it.  \n\nWe had an Open Table certificate and had no problems redeeming it.\n\nI totally recommend Piqueo's and would absolutely go back again for more.\n\nGracias Piqueo's, for offering a yummy meal away from home.", "author": "Rita F."}

I say lax because they strategically spaced out our dishes so our table wouldn't be too uncomfortably cramped.  Smart!\n\nOur server was really cute and was attentive enough without being overly attentive (did that make sense?)  She definitely made us feel comfortable and didn't rush us through the end of our dinner, even when we ended up being one of the last tables left.  She even checked to see how long MaggieMudd's Ice Cream would be open.  We kept eyeing it to make sure it was still open...We didn't make it, but I thought it was nice of her to do so. :)\n\nI was really impressed with our food, minus the paella...you'll see why.  \n\nFirst off, the Fried Chickpeas are addicting (good one, 7X7).  Luckily, they're light and small in portion.  I love how restaurants offer yummy alternatives to the filling combination of bread and butter.  \n\nThe Red Snapper Ceviche was so good!  The fish was perfect, tender and full of flavor!  Let the snapper marinate in your mouth before chewing on it...definitely a \"moment\"!  I'm glad the server didn't bring the other dishes out while having the ceviche because it's definitely one to finish on its own without other dishes to distract your attention.  \n\nNext up, the BACON Mac n Cheese...Not only do they sprinkle bacon shreds on top of the mac n cheese, they also chop up thick chunks of bacon IN the mac n cheese.  Knowing my love of bacon, my date found a ginormous chunk of bacon in his share and gave it to me...\"HE LIKES ME!  HE REALLY LIKES ME!\"  Give me your bacon and my heart is yours... \n\nThen, the Chicken Chicharrones...can we say Yum?  We commented that usually, when you think of Chicharrones, you think of crispy fried skin.  But this chicharrones dish came with the tender meat and some out of this world dipping sauce.  I dipped it with some of the mac and cheese...EVEN BETTER!\n\nSo, after all the wonderful \"moments\" I had with the tapas, the paella came last with not so wonderful flavors.  I think, however, that if the paella come out earlier, it would have been better.  It was just \"meh\" to me.  I will say that they were very generous with the fresh seafood portions...\n\nOverall, points for its cozy romantic feel, nice service and tasty \"moments\"...", "author": "Jennifer L."}

We had a sub-par experience from a service perspective where we were forgotten about by the server then ignored by the staff as it became clear that an entree was never cooked for one of our party.    It was hard to get drinks, impossible to get more water and we could not get a response out of anyone.  There were no acknowledgements of the missing entree and when we finally were able to get a staff member's attention our missing meal was brought 15 minutes later.   The food was ok but by that point the poor service made it less palatable.    \nWhen we were trying to exit the restaurant the hostess actually hit me to get me out of her way-inexcusable and very rude-it was so shocking I did not say anything because I could not believe she did that, but sadly my husband confirmed that she did indeed bang into me to move me out of her path.  WOW!.\nI wrote to Piqueo's customer service email address provided on the site immediately after our poor experience but never heard back.

However I left Piqueo's with a full belly, a smile on my face, and a few extra dollars in my pocket with the coupon from Bloomspot.

Pretty much on-par with the ceviches served at every other Peruvian restaurant on the planet.

I'm a sucker for duck confit and this quesadilla was filled to the edges with succulent duck meat.\n\nShort Ribs (Stew) - I'm also a sucker for braised short ribs.

I practically danced (okay Samba'd to my own beat--I won't lie) out of the place as I drove off more than satisfied. \n\nFirst off, the group of 12 of us were seated in a small backroom that required us to be brought through the tiny place, alongside the kitchen, and out onto a covered/heated/enclosed deck of sorts. To be honest, I thought it was pretty cool. Its that whole elitist/VIP thing ya know? Ooooooh, Private Room!\n\nMoving from decor to deliciousness, our group pretty much ordered a little bit of everything. From ceviche, to beef brochettes, to plantains, the flavors were both adventurous and strong. Fish across the board seemed very fresh, and prepared well. Almost everything was done very well in fact, with consistent touches of lime, tomato, and garlic. I enjoyed, literally, everything I tasted.\n\nDrinkwise, the wine selection seemed decent (other people had ordered a few bottles). I ordered Sangria (they do it blended in-house) and it was some of the best Sangria I have ever had. It was strong, fruitful, and deliciously dangerous.\n\nDessert shared among the group was rich, flavorful, and true to the Peruvian Fusion theme. The chocolate was unbelievably decadent, and a few bites had me more than satisfied. Word of note for you heavy-sangria-drinking-peruvian-barmaids: they don't serve coffee (not that I would know, since its not like I'm a heavy-sangria-drinking-peruvian-barmaid).\n\nIts on the pricey side, but well worth it for a special occasion.  The service could use a little work (entree dishes came out at drastically different times, and left 2/12 -- including me -- dishless for upwards of 10 minutes).

(That's a complete flip-flop, but in a good way.)\n\nOn my first visit I ate the Empanada (yummmmm) and the Baby Octopus (double yummmmm--and thanks, little baby Octopus, for sacrificing your octopus teenage years and possibly adulthood for my dining experience).

Must the internet so 'simplify' everything ? But, if not for Table, I would not have ever found Piqueo's...which would have been a shame.\n\nRight off...my favorite Latin-y/Tapas-y places in the city are B44 and Zarzuela...both superlative, consistent, and fun.  Both are also in the NE corner of town...which happens not to be where I am.  So it's nice to find a place on the southern side of SF.\n\nI was very impressed.  Ambience was very nice...comfy, pretty, generally quiet as opposed to the boisterousness of the aforementioned.  Service was attentive and the food was really good.  A bit more experimental than your typical Tapas joint...and there was definitely a sorta Latin-asian sorta fusion going on in some dishes....but if you have a hankerin' for Latin American cuisine of a classier variety, this is a good place.\n\nAnd apparently Piqueo himself actually is on-premesis (even on a Monday night!)...which you gotta love.\n\nWine list was nice...but the Sangria is way overpriced (good, but overpriced).  Also, the Pulpo (octopus) would be better served with sliced potato as opposed to mashed...but, it being the TEST of whether a Latin American place is up to snuff....the dish passed muster.  The octopus was prepared very well.....not undercooked rubber (see Pasion) nor overcooked jerky...but done to perfection.  They did a great job on the Fish dishes as well.  We wanted to go for the platanos, but our server gently  insisted we were over-ordering for 2 people, so we layed off.  (She was right).\n\nDefinitely will be returning there.

But the tables are also dimly lit, so you do still have a feeling of \"just us.\" if you're comfortable having a romantic dinner within a few feet of others having a romantic dinner, then this is the place. And why would you come here in particular when there are countless spots offering romantic dinners in this great city? The food is fantastic. Perfectly cooked, great flavors, and plated beautifully. The service is quick and attentive, but not intrusive. We enjoyed every dish that came out of the kitchen, including the ceviche (trust me, this is the appetizer you want), the ribs, the shrimp.

There were a few tables up front in the main dining room, but it appeared that the only table available was for 4-people. I felt they could've given us that table or the tables could've been separated and we could've sat in the main dining area; however, the server decided to put us in the back room, literally!!!!! The back room I believe was intended solely as a work station, but they decided to had a few tables to increase the capacity. Our table for 2 was right next to the wine station, in fact, I sat about a foot away from the wine refrigerator. I was really concerned if they wanted to get wine, it would be a bump and grind moment, and it would be quite disruptive and intrusive to our dining experience. However, when one of the wait staff got some wine and got closer to us than we wanted him to be, it wasn't too bad, but annoying none-the-less. In the small back room there were tables for 7 people: 2-doubles and 1 for four, we were the only ones there, after one patron left. We sat directly under the speakers, and the music was so loud we had to ask them to turn it down! I'm thinking maybe those speakers were meant for the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, this was not a good start nor was it a good first impression!\n\nOK, for a start we got some wine, me a chardonnay and my companion a red, which he claimed was pretty good. We shared an appetizer of octopus. OMG, it was like chewing on rubber bands, and atop a starchy mushy concoction of potatoes. And, to top it off it was charred, I'm being polite, it was burnt!  Again, not a good start.\n\nFor our main course I got the pork in an adobo sauce and my companion got the lamb. OMG, I thought France has a heavy hand with the salt when it concerns pork, but this restaurant has them beat. It was SO salty, thank god for the mashed sweet potatoes to offset the saltiness. On the other hand the lamb was good, but nothing spectacular. I literally had to order a another glass of wine to eat the pork and extra water. If you guessed that I didn't finish it you'd be correct.\n\nWe opted not to have dessert for obvious reasons.\n\nIf I could give this restaurant a half point I would give it a half a point above poor. Two out of the 3 dishes were very poor. Saving grace was the wine, and they do pour a nice generous portion.\n\nService was excellent, except for banishing us to the back room in \"never-never\" land. For the two of us we paid $90 including the tip! I think I'll skip this restaurant when I'm next in town and head over to the more established eating areas such as Noe Valley, Valencia corridor, or even the Mission!", "author": "Randy D."}

You walk into a tiny candle-lit place and begin with a plate of little Peruvian munchie things of roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and chickpeas. Highlighted with their passion fruit sangria before the small dishes come out, the experience is heavenly. \n\nThe place is relatively dark, and small, and might be a perfect place for Valentines Day - although we had a group of four with us when we went. We started out with the Ceviche - fresh acidic lemon and lime juices marinate succulent pieces of octopus, scallops and calamari. Accents of onion, fresh cilantro and roasted corn sprinkled on top reminds you you're eating Peruvian - not Mexican. \n\nWe had several dishes - the beef short ribs, the guy next to us recommended it ...and it melts in your mouth. Mac n' cheese - baked - with a crumbly topping and most memorably, the chunks of fatty maple bacon swam in the thick white cheese sauce. Potato croquet balls that were fried on the outside and starchy on the inside. \n\nWe had a few other dishes, but it slips me at the moment bc likely I was too entrenched in conversation to remember. The dessert was a mousse-like fluffy chocolate cake dessert, and flirting with it on top was a tiny scoop of mango ice cream - an interesting pairing to say the least (but delicious). \n\nIt was a great, chill and romantic atmosphere, good for small groups or a couple, and sits atop of a hill in Bernal Heights. If you try to go, be careful around Alemany Road, it's confusing and we got lost and looped twice back over. \n\nAll in all - a sweet place.

While the food is not cheap, it is plentiful the menu features some dishes I havnt found many places.

Free cultural lesson! score!\n\nCebiche Plate trio is a must. It features all of their popular cebiches. If you are new to Peruvian foods...go for it! The seafood stew was delicious and the goat cheese and duck quesadillas were dangerous. Come on...shredded duck and cheese? Nothing better. Well, almost. For the adventurous, order the beef heart. ORDER IT! I promise you it is not metallic or chewy or anything like you would think. Perfectly charred with a spicy red sauce...mmmm. Id go just for that.

The restaurant is small, but the atmosphere is cozy yet modern; a perfect setting for sharing tapas with your loved ones.  \n\nWe got acquainted with this restaurant after purchasing an Open Table certificate for half off.  We ordered a variety of items from the menu to share: ceviche mixto, ahi ceviche, bolitas de yucca, and 2 specials of the evening: a \"surf and turf\" and the paella negra.  Everything was delicious, with a few caveats:  there was a lot of large raw onion chunks in many of the dishes we ordered.  I actually quite like the taste of raw onion, but even I felt it was overboard, particularly in the ceviches and the paella.  The ceviches were bright and flavorful, but lacked a bit of panache it terms of knife skills and presentation for the fish (compared to La Mar's ceviches).  The bolitas de yucca were these wonderful fried balls filled with love and came with a sauce that will make you lick the plate.  In other words, GET THESE!!!  The squid-ink based paella was generously packed with assorted seafood.  The steak and scallops of the surf and turf dish were grilled perfectly (so tender but with a nice char).  We ordered a cava cocktail with chicha morada to accompany our tapas, but unfortunately I found the cocktail to be too sweet.\n\nWe finished the meal with 2 heavenly desserts:  the chocolate lava cake with pisco ice cream and the \"Suspiro a la Lime\u00f1a\" (Dulce de Leche with pisco whipped cream).  According to another Yelper, \"Suspiro a la Lime\u00f1a\" means \"sigh of a woman from Lima\" and how can you not be absolutely tickled by that?  The custard was dense and rich and much like a (satisfied) sigh of woman (from Lima or any other place).  \n\nService was attentive, but a bit slow at times.  All in all, we had a good experience at Piqueo's and will return to try other items on the menu.", "author": "Beth K."}

Why did we bother to make a reservation??\n\nThe most frustrating part was that they seated 3 tables before us that had arrived after us because they had given us seats at the \"bar\" (which isn't a bar, it's just a counter where you can watch the food being prepared) so they forgot about us since we weren't standing on top of them and kept giving away our table. \n\nHad it been any other night we would not have put up with it and would have left... but since it was Valentine's Day we knew we didn't have much other choice besides McDonald's.\n\nIn the end we were finally seated... starving and frustrated. They did bring us a free dish to try to make it up to us although we didn't get to choose it so we weren't very happy with it. If the food had been outstanding they could have redeemed themselves a little and received a 2-star. Unfortunately we were not all that excited about the food, not that it was bad or anything.\n\nIt's very cold and drafty in the back, so if you do go here, try to get a seat toward the front.\n\nOverall a very very unpleasant experience.

Could have easily eaten a whole bucket of it.  To our waiter's recommendation I ordered a glass of their Sangria.  Que ricura! I was hesitant based on my experience with sangrias at restaurants, but this was delightful.  I won't preference any specific dish from the four we ordered for the simple fact that, without exaggeration, all were equally delicious!  The bolitas de yuca, cebiche de pescado, lomo saltado, and adobo de chancho were not only very tasty but also had eye appeal.  As an observation, the cebiche I'm used to back home in Panama tends to have the seafood diced smaller and has had enough time for the acid in the citrus to cook it completely until it's opaque.  The cebiche at Piqueos was a big larger but just as equally delicious and flavorful.  \nSomething else to note, our waiter (didn't get his name) was not only friendly and professional but also showed knowledge in the food preparation. \nI now know why this is one of my partner's favorite spot!", "author": "Jose R."}

We were seated in a little corner next to the restroom where no one paid attention to us. After we ordered it took over 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out, then it took intervals of 15-20 minutes for each of our dishes to come out- and mind you we absolutely did not ask for our meal to be family style where one dish comes out and everyone shares it. My brother finished his meal about 40 minutes before I received mine, and by that time I was already asking for my meal to go because I had spent almost 2 hours waiting. Did I also mention about half the people who came into the restaurant after us, left before us. I assume this means, if your skin is not wrinkly and white, they don't care about you as much. \n\nThe food at best was okay. It was tasty but I could probably find Peruvian food on mission street that is much tastier, cheaper, and more largely portioned.

It really bothers me when someone says everything on the menu is great, I don't care if it really is, but I digress. \n\nSo anyway, we were a party of three so he recommended about four small plates, then splitting two entrees.

Again, my advice, go experience and experiment with the menu, ask advice from Tomas or whomever is on your table that night.\n\nFor entrees, go with the lamb chops, or the classic lomito saltado dish.

It's a gift to have another delicious restaurant on Cortland for the \"foodies\" of Bernal Heights to feast in. \n\nI loved this restaurant and can't wait to go again. At our request our waiter was quite helpful recommending his favorite items from the menu. We took his advice and only ordered dishes he suggested and we were very happy with everything we ate. I regret, however, that we didn't order his dessert recommendation because the 2 desserts we shared were both average. \n\nTapas:\nWe started with a couple of items from the tapas menu: Camarones al ajo (Sauteed shrimp with sofrito garlic paste, soy sauce served with grilled bread ) & Pastelito de Choclo (Peruvian corn cake with potatoes, saffrito, queso blanco y salsa de maracuya). Both of these dishes were very good, especially the shrimp. I can't wait to sample other tapas items on future visits.\n\nEntrees: \nWe both shared an entree from the dinner menu: Chuleta de Cordero con Locro (Lamb chops a la parrilla served with pumpkin stew and fried mint leaf). This dish was fantastic, the kind of dish I could get cravings for. Very memorable.\n\nDessert:\nFor dessert we shared two items: Torta de Chocolate \n(Chocolate cake served with lucuma ice cream and caramel sauce) and some kind of pudding type thing (I can't remember the name). We didn' finish either desserts since they were average and unremarkable (unlike the rest of our meal). \n\nFor the record, our waiter had recommended the Passion Fruit Mouse, which I will try next time. But if that is only average too, I might skip dessert at Piqueo's in the future. The desserts didn't suck they just didn't move us.\n\nCorkage fee:\nPiqueo's does have a $15.00 corkage fee, which was not advertized on their menu and even Yelp says they don't have a corkage fee. We had brought a bottle of 2004 Porter Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek) and after the waiter had already opened it he said, \"you know we have a $15.00 corkage fee.\" I said, \"actually, I didn't know that, as it's not on your menu.\" He didn't waive the fee and we weren't in the mood to argue. I will change this mistake on Yelp to reflect that they do have a corkage fee. \n\nI can't wait to go back to Piqueo's again. I loved it. Delicious.", "author": "Yvette K."}

My visit to Piqueo's marked my first visit to Bernal Heights -- and I'll definitely be back.  \n\nOn a Saturday night, the restaurant is busy, but not packed (probably a result of being located in such a sleepy neighborhood).  My bf and I had a reservation, but it's probably not absolutely necessary.  The lighting is dim and romantic, the music has a great Latin rhythm, and the decor is trendy and cool.\n\nUpon being seated, you're welcomed with a bowl of fried garbanzo beans in a sort of pico-de-gallo mix. Delish.  The bf and I ordered sangria - which we both agreed was the best sangria we'd ever had.  (The bf hates that sangria so often tastes like cheap Merlot. Piqueo's sangria = a sip of heaven).\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered 4 tapas dishes and 1 dessert.  This was definitely enough food for two starving people and probably too much for two moderately hungry people.  We had the tequenos (fried wantons stuffed with crap & shrimp, covered in powdered sugar w/drizzled raspberry sauce and guacamole) which were delicious, but  might be good to have last instead of dessert since they're so sweet.  Next we had a Peruvian corn puree dish in an avocado mousse. Tasty, but not my fav.  Third was the fried calamari.  Really the best calamari I've ever had (but after the tequenos was overkill on the fried food).  Last, we had the pork costillas (short ribs).  Definitely my favorite dish of the 4.  SOOO darned good.  \n\nWe were pretty full after our 4 tapas, but simply couldn't resist the dessert menu.  We asked our server to help us decide, and she recommended the quinoa flan.

Really, really, really effing good.\n\nI don't think it's on their menu online but there was a mound of out of control, orgasmic, perfectly horseradishy potato with ahi tuna and a layer of something, by turns stupendous, wondrous, piquant and provocative New Zealand mussels lightly fried and served with ensalada de lechuga y crema de rocoto(?), mini white beans and rice cake served with platano & egg (damn) , and a sweet potato flan with orange-canela sauce and chifles(?) which was so obnoxiously good it was almost disturbing. Paired with an '03 Duero, this was an extravagant sojourn into original, inventive, delicious and beautifully presented tapas that consistently rocked, served with a smile. I have no doubt that everything on the menu is a further, scrumptious immersion into a world of flavorful corn, potato, shrimp and queso blanco eggstacia. Amazing sauces too, which are apparently a secret.\n\nWe went on the early side when the place was nearly empty, and after a brief moment of maitre'd-m.i.a., the service was impeccable.

This was the first of many bad ideas as we could see directly into the kitchen. \n\nOur first waitress came over (1 of 4 that we ended up having throughout the night) and we explain that S. is allergic to wheat and gluton.  She says ok and recommends the first 3 things on the menu. Now, I'm no  brainiac but I'm pretty sure that breaded and fried probably implies wheat... Ok, here comes waitress #2. We ask her the same thing and she says that she will ask the chef. After 15 minutes, along comes waitress #3, new explanation and still no clue.... Waitress #4 finally answers some questions so we order. I love ceviche so we order that as our appetizer.\n\nWhen it arrived, it looked awesome, but looks can be really deceiving. The fish was some gigantic, odd cuts with tendons and really chewy. The flavor was good but the fish was completely raw. Isn't ceviche supposed to be marinated for sometime before being served? \n\nSo, at this point, I notice the guy preparing the ceviche. He mixes it up, takes a little taste, and then, ew, puts the spoon back in the bowl. I stop eating the ceviche and tell S. Since the guy is right in front of us, we keep watching.... He does this over and over until he notices us watching... At this point, he tastes, then wipes off on the kitchen rag that I just saw him use to wipe off the counters, and back in the bowl it goes.... Appetite is fading fast....\n\n2 more small plates arrive, but by now, nothing tastes good, except the wine which was awesome. Good thing I lilked it because we never got any water after asking twice...\n\nThe skewers were good and although I would love to tell you about the other thing we ordered, it never came.

For every Jekyll, there's a Hyde: Valentina vs. Palatino, Wild Side West vs. Skip's, new Moki's vs. old Moki's.\n\nPiqueo's is a Jekyll, for those keeping score. It's sort of a date place, which I didn't know when I took my buddy there, but we're enlightened men so we sat down anyway. The space feels more open, and thus more relaxed, than it did when Moki's was the tenant.\n\nOur waitress was eager to suggest personal favorites from the menu, and even translate where necessary. If asked to choose, she was decisive; like Nish N. intuited, anyone who claims they like everything on the menu is either lying or selling something. She set us up with two great red wines (a Syrah and a Malbec) to accompany our entrees. I don't remember what my buddy ate (like I said, it wasn't a date), but I had the steak covered in linguine with sauteed mint. Could the meat have spent a little less time in the pan? Yeah. But the flavor was great -- not to mention unique -- and the portion was just the right size.\n\nThere was room left over for some kind of lime meringue concoction -- one dessert, two spoons (maybe it was a date?). It was really rich, I mean one notch below pucker-and-wince rich, but again, very tasty. Enough to put the kibosh on our Mitchell's-and-Front-Porch routine for at least a weekend.\n\nOverall -- great menu, fair prices, very subdued vibe. Cortland keeps getting better.

It recently just opened at Bernal Heights, so we decided to give it a shot. The space is very small and intimate, but not too crowded. The menu offers a large selection of tapas, cerviche and entrees.\n\nWe decided to order 3 tapas, 1 cerviche and 1 entree. The perfect amount of food since the tapas portions were just right for tasting. First we had the seafood wontons. They were small little wonton deep fried and stuffed with a mixture of \"seafood.\" It didn't really taste like seafood to me, but they were okay. The weird thing about the dish was that it was topped with sugar. The sweet and savory combination didn't seem right. Then we had the plantain. I was very disappointed. It was a whole plantain sliced in half (through the middle) and it sandwiched a piece of cheese. YES, a piece of cheese. This was the first time I ever ate plantains that way. Honestly, I didn't enjoy it that much. I took the cheese out and just ate the plantain by itself. Then we had the Chicharroncito chicken. It was deep fried chicken with a rich creamy sauce. It was delicious. \n\nThen we had the mixto cerviche. Marinated raw shrimp, fish and mussels served with yams and corn. It was pretty good, not too tart from the lime and the seafood was very fresh. For our entree, we had the baked breaded halibut stuffed with shrimp and mushrooms. This dish was excellent. The fish was crisp and flaky and the sauce was very flavorful. I definitely thought the entree tasted better than the tapas.\n\nDessert didn't seem that tempting, so we skipped. Overall, I thought this place was just average. I still prefer Limon or Fresca for my Peruvian cravings.", "author": "Denise L."}

The camarones and ceviche in particular stood out with their incredible sauces and delicate fire. Not terribly crazy about the papas, I thought it could have been cooked a little longer. \n\nFor entrees we had the arroz con mariscos (this was AWESOME.. I was hesitant to order this because I had ordered it from another Peruvian restaurant not 2 weeks ago and was very disappointed because of the dry consistency and lack of overall flavour... not so at Piqueo! Their dish had just the right amount of \"moist\" texture and the seasoning was perfect, highly recommended!), lomo saltado (maybe it's just me but I am SO picky about lomo saltado and I wasn't crazy about the beef they used... my brother ate the whole dish, though!) and a halibut dish (shoot, I forgot the name!) that was fresh but on the verge of being overpowered by the spicy sauce.\n\nFinally for dessert we ordered the flan de camote (let me tell you I am NOT a flan fan but this was different... it wasn't quite as mushy and overly sweet. I loved it as did the rest of my family) and torta de chocolate (I wasn't crazy about this dessert as I thought the chocolate cake was somewhat stiff, the lucuma ice cream it came with made up for it, though)\n\nService started off very well- our waitress was very attentive while we were there. However I think the kitchen is still working out some of their kinks- our waitress came out 10 min. after we had ordered to inform us that they ran out of the stuffed halibut we had originally ordered. We also received another table's appetizers... three times.\n\nOops.\n\nFinally, we were seated in the back room which was on the cramped side and got LOUD as the evening progressed, hope they can do something about  that. It was also a warm evening so it was quite toasty in the back, not very comfortable when you're eating spicy foods. \n\nBut overall I LURVED it and will definitely return...

The ribs ($10) were falling off the bone, so tender and tasty! Ooh, yummy sweet potato fries- they were thicker than most that I have seen. The scallops were amazing (very small portion, 2 for $15). We also had a pepper that was stuffed with cheese and meat. This had an interesting taste- kind of sweet. Definitely good, but not necessarily my favorite. The chicken we had was with a peanut sauce, and I just felt like I should be having curry and noodles with the chicken dish. It seemed out of place, but it was tasty. \n\nFinally, for dessert, they were out of the lava cake so we had a very traditional dessert: Suspiro a la Limena which means \"Sigh of the Lima Woman.\" This is a milky, thick pudding with caramel.

They're not the type tiny little ones that you might think; instead, they're huge - inside a puff pastry.  The choclo (corn and cheese) was fantastic.\nWe also loved the shrimp encrusted with quinoa.\nThe ahi tuna ceviche with avocado was absolutely to die for!  It's a bit pricer than the others but worth it.\nThe service was cheerful and prompt.  I loved that they cleared our plates in between tapas courses and that they served the tapas one at a time instead of all together, which means that something ends up getting cold and they all compete for space on a small table.  Nice job!\nFinally, parking was super easy - a huge plus in SF!\n\nCons:\nA bit small so there may be a wait, even with a reservation.\nThey were out of two wines by the glass and a few of the others weren't so good (avoid the red blend from Lodi).\nThe only dish that we didn't love was the cheese-filled wontons.

The dishes that are good are great, the flavors are strong and distinctive, all of the meat and seafood is high quality (if not always perfectly prepared), and the sangria is perfect. Plus, the room is very warm-feeling, with rich red walls and wooden tables, which I love; it's just a fun, casual-feeling place to hang out and eat.\n\nRecommendations: There are four different ceviches on the menu and both of the ones I've tried were very good: strong, flavorful marinade, but you can still taste the fish. Deep-fried stuffed yucca balls with salsa are a specialty and a must.: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, yet light and not at all greasy, with a pleasant, subtle flavor. They do a pretty good job simply preparing a lean piece of steak. And, again, the sangria. Always get the sangria if you go. I mean it. As some others have said, this isn't authentic Peruvian food, but authentic Peruvian food sucks (i.e., Mi Lindo Peru down on Mission, yuck). This Cal-Peruvian fusion is much better.\n\nFor mains, I generally would prefer the small plates to the large plates, and for the large plates, the seafood and red meat to the poultry. The Pollo Pachamanquero is one dish I have been underwhelemed by, with slightly dry chicken and, frankly, a bland recipe. Avoid it. Dessert selection is a bit fruit-heavy, chocolate light for me, but above average quality in general.\n\nIf you're going on a weekend night, you must make a reservation.

To be fair, I've never had ceviche before.  But, this just blew me away for the different flavors the 3 tasters had.  Honestly, I could have just eaten ceviche and been so satisfied.  My taste-buds were exploding.\nBaby octopus small plate: I'm a fan of octopus, but that also makes me picky.  It was fresh, not at all chewy, and the sauce just made it so different to any other style I've had.  Delicious.\nQuinoa encrusted shrimp: AMAZING.  Comfort food with mash and a sweet sauce.  Delicious.\nDuck quesedilla: Decadent.  It will fill you up - save it for the end.\nMac and Cheese: I'm not a fan of mac and cheese, but my man is, and his eyes were rolling back in his head.  This mac and cheese is no joke, just because it's a \"small plate\" don't think it won't fill you up.\nDulce de leche dessert: RICH.  Share with a friend.  Delicious.\n\nI really felt like the price was fair - small plates were around $15 but you really got what you paid for.  \n\nThis restaurant would be great for a date, ambience is very romantic and cosy.

But I have to say that none matches the offerings of Piqueo's in Bernal Heights. Due to it's \"remote\" location in otherwise picturesque Cortland Avenue, this little gem may have escaped your  \nradar until now, but please, do correct this mistake and visit them for a real treat to your senses. From the moment the friendly staff brings you a free aperitif, to the moment you went through several courses (tapas style) and all the way to dessert, their menu of light, honest and surprising combinations will leave you wanting for more. I have been there numerous times (visiting Bernal Heights is equal to making a stop at Piqueo's), and all my experiences have been flawless, unlike other places where you go to get stuffed and feel regretful afterward, at Piqueo's you go to feeling good about yourself and leave with a \"wanting more\" aftertaste. I cannot recommend any single dish as I have tried most and all of them are my favorite, you just can't go wrong. No doubt, one of my  top-three favorite restaurants in San Francisco (And no, nobody is paying me to give them five stars, and I don't know any of their owners... Just their food and that is enough).", "author": "David G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-15", "description": "First, let me start by saying that I'm Peruvian so I have extensive background with Peruvian food from simple to refined. After a long day we stumbled onto this place with the intention of just exploring the Bernal area because not having a car, we never get up to that area. Much to my surprise what used to be Moki's was now a Peruvian restaurant. Of course, my curiosity lead me to read the menu outside and giving my stamp of authenticity approval after reading the descriptions...we decided to give it a try despite the inflated prices for what really was Peruvian home cooking. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation but the hostess who looked confused offered us bar seats right in front of the cooks. Perfect for me since I love to cook and was curious to see what the cooks were doing. The ambiance was nice. The reds on the walls are a very Peruvian touch and the art was quasi Peruvian enough to work. It had a nice colonial touch to it - very much what you would see in Lima. Why did I have so much time to explore my surroundings? Because the waitress didn't even attend to us, meaning not even offering a drink, for at least 25-30 minutes and that was only after I flagged her over and told her in my best Peruvian Spanish that we would appreciate at least a drink. We felt a little bad for her because she looked overwhelmed. We even saw her give the wrong dish to the wrong table. We could only assume that the restaurant had just opened because of the lack of organization...we later found out that it just had - so we'll let the lack of structure slide in this case. \n\nSo we finally got to order and went with the causa (layered mashed potatoes with chicken in a aji cream sauces), the humita (a Peruvian tamale of sorts) and the mixed seafood ceviche - all Peruvian classics and items that are very familiar on my grandmas table. The causa was a little sloppy. The potatoes should have been mashed/pureed more and the olive and egg were missing. Howerve, the flavor was good and the sauces were fantastic. Grade: B. The humita...not so much. It was way too sweet and could have even been served as an experimental desert. Tasted like it was made with that masa powder you buy at mexican stores to make tortillas. My grandma would not approve. In fact, she would have taken it off the table. C-. The ceviche was...horrible. Ok, that might be a little strong....but it was bad. First of all, \"where's the beef?\". Barely a childs handful of mixed seafood on the plate. How about a little more sweet potato too? That wasn't the killer. The killer was the fact that the halibut was of poor quality, was cut in too large of chunks and was NOT MARINATED PROPERLY - in other words deathly raw - ok if it's high grade - not ok if it's not - it wasn't. My girlfriend literally gagged after putting it in her mouth and almost went to the bathroom to finish the job. I, again keep in mind I have probably had more than a 100 ceviches in and out of Peru in my time, was also completely totally infinitely turned off by it as well. The chef was right in front of us and I couldn't help but let him know that this is not what ceviche anywhere in the world, and especially Peru, is supposed to be like. He told me that this is the way it was always served at his restaurants - maybe nobody has ever had the knowledge to tell him that this is not the way ceviche is supposed to be. I was tempted to have him try it and I'm pretty sure he would have agreed. He did kindly offer to replace it. What I did instead is cut the halibut in peices and marinate it in the juice myself for the next 20 mins - only then was it palatable. The ceviches only saving grace is that the marinade was very good. To salvage the chefs feelings...I felt I had to share that with him. Needless to say the eye contact with the chef that was strong at the beginning of the meal faded fast after my ceviche comments. Why did I just write so much about the ceviche? Because it is practically the national dish of Peru - you have to make this properly to call yourself a Peruvian restaurant. Grade: F. \n\nAll this being said, I hope hope hope hope hope that this is not the way they usually serve it and that the restaurant is going through it's first month growing pains. In the meantime, I would go to El Perol's little cafeteria style Peruvian joint in the Mission any day over this and spend 1/10th the amount and get my self homey Peruvian food made the right way - just like grandma used to make.

Everything about it just rubs me the right way (except maybe the price, but that's likely just due to the fact that I keep loading up on tapas- shame on me.) Parking here has been easy for me the past couple times coming here- I was able to park within a block of the restaurant both times. The place is rather small, but clean and doesn't feel too crowded, which is good. \n\nI've already been here twice so let's try to throw out the things I've ordered: cebiche pescado, bolitas de yucca, tequefios, quesadilla de pato... looking at the online menu, it doesn't seem to list everything that's on the in-store menu... although there's some things on the online menu that doesn't seem to be on the in-store menu... perhaps it needs to be updated or I'm going crazy...\n\nIn any case, there were some dishes that I would pass on (due to preference, not due to quality), but there were some things that I really enjoyed while coming here. The quesadilla de pato (duck confit quesadilla) for one, which was wayyy better than I had expected. A generous amount of duck inside, and the flavors just work. Really great dish. The meals always come with some free fried chickpeas at the beginning of the meal, which are really really good, and I don't even like chickpeas. In fact, I don't like any peas at all, because I own a rabbit, and peas remind me of rabbit poo... \n\nThe service there is good. We've always made reservations and were always seated promptly and quickly greeted by a waiter and offered water. One thing that I really liked about the service here is that after each dish, if our plates were dirty, the waiter would offer us new plates for our next course, which is awesome, because it's NOT awesome having sour/tangy cebiche/ceviche juice mixing with my curry yucca balls. In addition to that, they pass my \"don't let me go thirsty\" rule and always fill my water. Also, the last time I went there, my bolitas de yucca (yucca balls stuff with cheese and ham) were still cold inside. I told the waiter and he quickly took it back and had the kitchen cook us some new ones. A couple minutes later, he came back to check to see if it was hot enough this time around (which it was.) Very attentive waiter. Great guy. I never caught his name, but it's the guy with the green tattoo on his right forearm. If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thumbs up to everyone at Piqueo's!\n\nI've always left this place full and happy with the service. I will definitely come back.", "author": "Eugene C."}

It has been a little noisy for my taste, in the past, but that wasn't the case this time, perhaps a result of some re-designing that had gone on since my last visit. If I had one complaint, it would be that at the prices jumped up since my previous visits. With a bottle of wine, we walked out for about $90 per couple - not terrible, but not a spur of the moment amount of money to spend, speaking personally of course.

We ordered our meal and when it came out she told us that even though She explained that the chicken was suppose to be stuffed with asparagus, they were out, so it was just a plain chicken breast.  How do you not run up the street to Good Life and buy some more asparagus?  Or how do you not tell us this before you cook it?  So then after tasting it and realizing it was no better then Good Frickin Chicken, but 4 times the price, we ordered something else and had to stagger our meals for a weird dining out experience.  As I was finishing my meal, my wife was sipping on her wine when the waitress came over and topped it off with water and then took off!    It was getting comical at this point, but we were sure they would comp us for the wine, one of the dinners or offer free dessert to apologize right?  Nope, the check came and everything was on there.  Then they tell me that I can't use American Express to top it off.   \n\nIf they had made some kind of effort to apologize for their mistakes, I would go back, but for the prices they charge and on principal, we can not take the chance of going back in there and suggest you spend your time elsewhere as well.", "author": "Pele N."}

Instead, we had a whole bunch of misses. Plus the previously mentioned inattentive (or new? or incompetent?) waitstaff. Plus cold cold wind blowing in through the mostly open door, where people congregate while waiting for a table. We asked to move and were turned down, and my husband spent his entire dinner asking patrons to please close the door.\n-- \"ahi\" ceviche, absolutely covered in too many red onions. Big slices of kind of tuna. Just because it's tuna, it doesn't mean it's ahi. Not ocean-y at all, but closer to meat. Maybe it's how Peruvian cebiche is suposed to taste?-- but then, if so, I don't like it.\n-- the empanada. We ordered the spinach empanada, the waiter said \"cheese\"? and I pointed to the spinach one on the menu, and he brought us -- get this -- a meat and cheese flaky pastry object. Really very much like a hot pocket, but flakier, and the meat was scarey and neither of us liked the sauce it was sitting in. We should have sent it back. My mistake.  \n-- baked corn-cake embedded with white beans and floating in paprika flavored cream. It was great. How bad can something get if it's floating in cream?\n-- then the waiter brought us our plate of cooked spinach. OK, but it's weird to have a plate of cooked spinach sitting there by itself after you've eaten three other things. It tasted strongly of burned garlic.\n-- then we were asked if we wanted anything else, and we replied that yes, we wanted the octopus that we had ordered at the beginning of the meal. The plate arrived eventually. Little baby octopi, tender enough, on an enormous pile of those white beans. \nWe gave up and went home.  75 bucks.", "author": "Margaret G."}

One cup of ceviche (mixed seafood) for 18 bucks?  literally, a cup of food.  Too expensive.  Two glasses of wine each and our bill was 80 bucks.  Before our entrees even got to the table, we just left.  The tables are so close together people are literally listening to each other and it's such a drag.  Loud.  Slow.  They cram as many people into such a small space and they can't even serve them.  Our server was nice enough but that didn't make up for waiting an hour for our entrees.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-27", "description": "I was recently whisked away for a surprise late evening repast at Piqueo's. Upon discovering our destination, I was excited b/c it's in the neighborhood and it's been on the to try list for a while. I love ceviche and creamy aji amarillo sauces and don't have the opportunity to eat Peruvian cuisine enough these days.\n\nWe were told there would be a short wait when we walked in the door. There wasn't much space to loiter b/c the place was totally packed; this really surprised me as Bernal isn't really a late night dining neighborhood. After we were seated I became worried about what was in store for us since it took 25-30 minutes to place our order. If we had been given drinks, the wait would have been more bearable, but our drink order was not placed until we ordered our dinner. The menu was far more expansive than either of us expected with numerous small plates, ceviches, specials, entrees, and house specialties. It was a bit overwhelming b/c even with our experience with Peruvian cuisine, we were unfamiliar with certain ingredients and items. \n\nThey were out of the scallops (one of my selections) so we chose a tuna ceviche, the camerones al ajo, bolitas de yuca relenas con queso, and a duo of taquetos made with dungeness crab and cheese. The pacing of the meal was appropriate for the small two top and we shared everything. The service was clearly still harried as we had to ask for bread to help sop up the delicious sauces that accompanied each dish. The camerones were slightly overcooked and a few were entirely unpeeled. The mahogany colored sofrito garlic sauce was worth the hassle of flagging down a server for more bread. I also loved the cheese-stuffed fried yucca balls and their dipping sauce. The taquetos were slender fried dough cigars, some filled with cheese and others with crab. The sweet tamarind sauce didn't really do it for me but the manfriend liked it. I thought that the ceviche was very well prepared, the cubes of tuna were uniformly cut and properly marinated.\n\nI enjoyed each of our dishes, found them to be well prepared and fresh, and enjoyed the bright and exciting flavors of rocoto and aji chiles, lime juice, and garlic. Everything managed to have an interesting flavor profile without being overwhelming. I will say that I found the prices to be higher than I expected for a neighborhood establishment. With ceviches hovering around $14 and entrees in the 20s, it's verging into more of the nice dinner date range, especially b/c their small plates are so interesting and we seldom can resist ordering a bottle of wine. With prices that high, I expect to have bread brought without attempting to flag someone down for 5 minutes while our dishes cooled. I would also hope that the establishment wouldn't seat more people than they were capable of attending to, which was clearly the case when we were there. I did appreciate our server bring a chilled ice bucket for our bottle of white wine. It's clear that the service and chef have potential but that they need to smooth out a few issues still. 3.5 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

Not a good idea eating sand for dinner and a second dish returned for the night.\nPeruvian cooking flag dish, Lomo Saltado, is a dish to try in any so called Peruvian fusion restaurant. It was a total disappointment. Piqueos claims in their menu that this dish is a Sauted marinated New York Strip but what you get is a stew of cheaper meat. Interesting that when we talked about this faux pas with Piqueo's chef he said that it was the owner's recipe, that it was cheaper to prepare it that way and that their food was not for Peruvians.\nAbout the service, it was mediocre and dishes took a long time to arrive to the table.", "author": "Jeffrey R."}

They feature a delicious assortment of sauces and perfectly cooked food.  The pork is as good as I've had and they always have a nice duck breast tapa.  We have been here around 6 times now and tried just about everything on the menu and the only item I didn't care for was a potato dish with raisins.  The sangria here is terrific too.\nThe prices are pretty reasonable too, generally it costs us about $30/person with a pitcher of sangria for every 2 people.  The tapas are fairly large so you don't need to order many.", "author": "James S."}

We have tried ordering pretty much every tapa on the menu and have liked or loved every single one.  Also, their ceviche is really good.  This place is sort of like Peruvian fusion, so there is a great combination of different flavors and options which truly makes this place unique.  They have a back room that is great for parties (which is especially helpful if your hard-of-hearing parents are visiting).  Haven't been in a while, but in the past, the tapas that didn't disappoint include the mustard lamb chops, the empanadas (a MUST), and the white bean cake (doesn't sound all that good on the menu but my brother ordered it and I tried it and yum!).", "author": "Christina P."}

My friend Rebecca (Miss Boston if you're nasty) had recommended this place from way back so I decided to go with her out to the rarely frequented Bernal Heights for some Peruvian.  She grew up in Peru and Paraguay so I trusted her taste more than most.  We got there and she ordered a drink called a chicha morada which is popular fermented purple corn drink from Peru.  I had a taste and it was really sweet but good.  We shared 4 dishes: yuquitas (yucca fritters), grilled baby  octopus, mar y tierra (steak and scallops), and the mixed ceviche.  All the dishes were really good.  Some might say too salty, but Rebecca said food in Peru is all really salty, so it was relatively authentic.  I really liked the baby octopus because it was really tender and had a nice chargrilled flavor.  The yuquitas were soft and tasted great with the melted cheese inside and the tasty sauce outside.  The steak and scallops were also perfectly cooked, medium rare steak and huge tender scallops.  The ceviche was also delicious and all the seafood was so fresh (clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, snapper).  If you like Fresca and Limon, you really should try Piqueo's...even if it's way the heck out there.", "author": "Dave L."}

It was Valentine's Day and my husband and I were also celebrating our wedding anniversary. We live in Bernal Heights and wanted to try this restaurant.   I got childcare for our son.  I got dressed-up.  It was raining, and VERY DRAFTY and cold in the back.  The waiter couldn't pronounce the dishes, in fact, he didn't know what was on the menu.  Disturbing!  The meal was just ok.  Nothing spectacular like the dishes we had in great restaurants in Lima and Cuscu, Peru.  I wasn't even allowed to have dessert and coffee after!  I didn't ask for my left-overs to be boxed, but it was and promptly dumped in front of me, as a message to scram, get out of here.  I was so upset!  It took me awhile to type up this review, because I was just so angry thinking about Piqueo, I would have typed up something with more bitter emotions earlier.  I think others tipsy on sangria probably would not have notice the bad service.  I don't drink.", "author": "Christina V."}

As a native Peruvian I have ventured into many Peruvian restaurants in the Bay Area; and Piqueo's has made it to the bottom of my list.   To start it was over priced for the amount of food you get - we ordered 3 appetizers, 7 entres, and a pitcher of chicha morada (filled only 4 glasses) - the bill was $260 if you include the tip the total was $300.  Way too much for a casual dinner out.  I wouldn't mind paying that much if the food justified the prices, the appetizers were a JOKE; the \"chifles\" were just potato (they gave us plain potatoes even when the menu said purple potato), yucca, and sweet potato chips served with guacamole and a tamarind sauce...the chips were not fresh, especially the yucca was stale and no longer crisp. The \"yuquitas fritas\" were tasty and the sauce it came with was yummy, but you only got 5 gumball size stuffed yuccas for $10 - I felt robbed! To make the long bad experience short: the steak was over cooked, the salmon did not have a quinoa crust (as described in the menu), what seemed to be Lomo Saltado was nothing more than tasteless tough pieces of meat in a red sauce.  The rest of our plates were average.  I read the reviews before going to Piqueo's especially the bad ones, and still decided to try it out...bad, bad idea.  Every one of my friends was disappointed that night and swears never to go back again.", "author": "Grace K."}

I walked past Liberty Cafe, but there was a decent wait (hardly surprising, it's a neighborhood favorite).  I continued down the street, and noticed that someone had finally moved into the old Moki's space (which I wish they hadn't left.  I understand they wanted something larger, but the old Moki's had a much better vibe).  I perused the menu;  it looked interesting, so I stepped inside.  \n\nThe hostess approached me, and asked how many.  I replied, \"just me\".  She motioned to the bar.  I'd noticed the bar, but it was appealing to me at the moment -- it was completely unoccupied and practically on top of the cooks (read loud and hot).  Now, that might have been fun and interesting under some circumstances, but sometimes when you're dining alone you'd rather just sit down at a quiet table and read.  I said, \"I'd prefer a table this evening if that's all right.\".  She shook her head, almost sadly.  \"Looks like there's one back there\", I said, eyeing a two-person table.  \"Oh, it's reserved\", she replied, but it was pretty clear that it wasn't by her tone.  What she really meant was \"we're not about to waste our precious table on a lone diner\".    I said, \"Oh, maybe another time then\".  I left, walked down the street to Little Nepal -- a great neighborhood spot that has\nan inviting, cozy atmosphere, great food, and staff that don't make you feel bad on that odd night when you're dining alone.\n\nNow, I understand that restaurants want to maximize their revenue, and it's a tough business.  I get it, really.  I'd be a bit more sympathetic if I hadn't gotten the \"it's reserved\" line from the hostness and had instead been told the truth.  Still, it's a pretty short-sighted business strategy -- especially as a neighborhood restaurant  -- to give a customer the brush-off because he happens to be dining alone that night.  It stands to reason that he might bring friends next time, spread the good word, etc.  \n\nI'm willing to revise my one-star review if I try it again sometime, but I'll deliberately go solo first;  I won't take my people there until I see if the bad attitude was a fluke or standard practice.  I *really* want to support new neighborhood restaurants in Bernal, but those that discriminate against lone diners don't deserve a spot in my hood.   Remember, we all eat alone sometimes...", "author": "Mark K."}

As far as ambiance, it has a very different feel...much more intimate a dining space....packed and active with an open kitchen. It was packed when we arrived there, but since we had a reservation, we were seated immediately. The menu is similar to Mochica, with the requisite Peruvian staples, but I remember the portions at Mochica being significantly larger. Our meal included the ceviche mixto, which as another reviewer also described, had halibut served in cube form. I wasn't as enthusiastic about that either, so I let the halibut cubes marinate a little longer. However, the shrimp and calamari were excellent and overall the flavor of the ceviche absolutely wonderful. The lomo saltado was also melt in your mouth yummy. And the flan for dessert was scrumptious. Both of our wine selections (he with the Argentinian Malbec and I with a gorgeous Argentinian Chard) were also right on. We found the staff to be quite helpful and friendly...but busy so we had to grab their attention a couple of times. However, for a newly opened restaurant the experience was quite good and I will definitely return.", "author": "Suepattra M."}

Desserts were also not good (extremely sweet) and we had to ask them NOT to charge a \"cake fee\" but luckily my friend baked a cake, it was far better than anything on the menu.

We had a hard time deciding because everything looked so good.   We settled on a mixed green salad, quail, and crab stuffed wontons as our appetizers.  They were all delicious.  For our entrees, I had the lamb with a wonderful risotto; my boyfriend had the New York Strip steak, and our friend had the Duck.  All were amazing - so flavorful!  Our friend also recommended the Rabbit but they had already sold the last order before we got there.  I can't wait to go back - you could even just order several tapas and skip the entree depending on how hungry you are.
