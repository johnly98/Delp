During my move, it was my go-to lunch spot because it was along the way to my new apartment.\n\nI took my mom out here for lunch as she was helping me move.  She was pretty amazed that a tiny coffee shop would have good sandwiches, at a good price!  I've had several of their sandwiches, and I have never been disappointed.  The breakfast bagel sandwiches are standard, and a fast way to fill up if you're on the run.  They have other snacks available, like knishes and pastries.\n\nThere's plenty of places to sit, and there's many places to be able to plug in your device.  It seems to be a hangout for college students and writers, so it can be on the quieter side, which is a nice environment for studying.\n\nService has always been fast and friendly.  And they have free wifi.  If you want to support a local business, you should buy your next sandwich and coffee here.", "author": "Vira P."}

I came here a few good times and never had any complaints. \n\nThe San Francisco Sandwich - It comes with turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, Swiss cheese, mayo, all on a soft roll. I've never really met a sandwich I didn't like and this sandwich was no exception. Yum! Hits the spot and definitely gave me what I was looking for. Savory with a good balance of sour puckering from the pickles and onions. This is their most popular sandwich, btw. \n\nYou will pay about $8-9, but this is the city so it is to be expected.\n\nService was extremely quick and they do offer free wifi. The Caf\u00e9 is large and very open. I usually get my order to go so I don't spend much time inside. The bathrooms are clean and they do take pride in making sure the caf\u00e9 has a clean appearance. There is ample seating to choose from, so if you want to sit for a while to do some work on your laptop, it is a perfect place to chill. Parking can be a pain if the meters in front are unavailable. If I am in the area I like to visit this place before the local high school lets out. It can get a little overcrowded for a short period.", "author": "Ann S."}

The cashier was a young girl the fact that I had seen a roach did not seem to even phase her! Then the older guy wearing glasses came by, \"trying to look for the roach\" but every time I would point at the terrified roach he would move things around & be like \"where, where, I don't see it\".Finally, I got offended to have them ignore my concern as a customer.

My go to, Home Cafe is always crowded and I need to get work done! Enter Cafe Enchante. \n\nI remember stopping by this cafe on my way to do my first hike in San Francisco. The cafe had comfy sofas, lots of tables and wasn't crowded. It was such a pleasant space, a great pit stop for my tired feet and I knew I would return. Fast forward two years, here I am, right now - Cafe Enchante is saving my butt yet again. \n\nWith coffee and food offerings, outlets aplenty, and lots of tables/sofas - this is an ideal place to sit down and be productive. It's so rare to find these cafes nowadays. I really, really appreciate an establishment like this, and it feels welcoming for every type of person since there are different open spaces, high and low tables, quiet corners, sofa chill spaces etc. You can even play chess on some of these tables. But the major thing is - you can do work here. The coffee is pretty decent. The staff are welcoming and on top of everything.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Specialty Sandwich, which is probably the most expensive sandwich on the menu, and a large iced vanilla latte. It was $13 !\n\nThe environment is definitely a working place. Many many tables and sitting areas to do work in, have a small business meeting in, etc. There is music playing in the background, but it's not very bothering (at least not to me).\n\nThis place includes free WiFi, clean bathroom, and tons of charging cables.

It's some customers who are destroying the atmosphere and make some people uncomfortable. On regular basis a guy comes in with his kids. They take up both couches. They speak very loudly and then he is reading them some books and commenting on politics loudly. At least he and some other customers should see that most people are trying to read and study. It's just common courtesy. Some people just want to sit and relax and these kids and dad take up everything. Once again. This is not the cafe's management's fault.\n\nIn the evening you may often see various shady people come in and out. Watch your laptops.\n\nPlease make the coffee better. These days we know what coffee tastes good and what coffee sucks. Most of the time coffee here is ok. Not good but passable. It tastes like the beans weren't ground that day but instead tasted like stale old coffee from coffee that was ground days ago. Please, it's so simple. Just grind coffee beans in the morning or couple times per day. Otherwise everyone immediately know that the coffee is made from some week old ground coffee.

Unfortunately the photos don't necessarily show the corner you're more likely to end up sitting in (because of how busy this place gets) is poorly lit and looks like the inside of a janitor's closet. \n\nBut before I get into all that. This place does have plenty of street parking in the area, the service is not the nicest but they do their job professionally, there's plenty of seating, and there's free wifi. I didn't see any outlets in the area I was seated in (back, more dimly lit corner). And of course I love the atmosphere of the cafe. It has a whimsical pseudo-European vibe that lives up to the \"enchante\" name. The menu on the other hand is pretty straight forward. It has some sandwiches and pastries along with your basic cafe items. I ended up getting a matcha blended drink. It was fine. The matcha quality wasn't great but the drink was blended well and a had a good balance of sweetness. \n\nOverall, I do like this cafe.

Aside from the convenience of it being just two blocks from my house, the service is really quick and the people that work there are very friendly. I unwittingly went in there once 10 minutes before close, realized it as the woman was making my drink, apologized to her for being one of \"those\" people, and received a very pleasant smile and conversation from her, saying she was happy to make my drinks. Sweet lass. There is one woman who is always there when I go in for my Iced Caramel Latte (which is delicious) and she's very difficult to understand. But fear not! Once you become a seasoned patron like myself, you will understand this woman and your past miscommunications will seem so far away.\n\nAnyway, the food is pretty good and the portions are fairly large, especially for the price. My friend once got one of the smoothies and she has confirmed that it was very tasty.\n\nThe one downside to the place (if you want to eat in or drink your coffee on one of the many couches) is that the furniture has seen better days.

There are also many electrical outlets so you can work on your laptop.  There are also sofas if you want to be comfortable and talk to your friends there.   It kind of reminds me of a french cafe if you see the decor on the walls.   The noise level is quiet to medium.  Their bathroom is decent and usually well-stocked with soap/tissues/towels.\n\nTheir wi-fi has always been good when I've been there.  Unlike Peet's also on Geary, Enchante doesn't limit your wi-fi to 2 hours before you get the signal that you have to buy more stuff to get another code which limits to you to another 2 hour block of time. \n\nI love their bagel sandwiches (esp the Le Jardin Bagel) and regular sandwiches the best along with their smoothies, various coffees, and cold blended drinks.  They have a LIBRARY of just about any type of tea you would want.  I like non-bitter coffees which is another reason I hate Peet's.  I prefer Starbucks sweet coffees, but when comparing beverages and food selection/quality with Starbucks, I find Enchante on par with, if not better, than Starbucks.\n\nThe only thing to beware of is of the various pastries inside their glass counter.  I don't know where they get their various pastries, but sometimes, they can taste pretty off like the ground beef piroshkies.  Also, there is a $5 minimum to use your CC, but they do have an ATM inside.  \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to go to Enchante cafe, but if you're near Geary & 25th Ave, it's a great place to go to relax and use the wi-fi and get a good brunch or lunch esp since they open early 6am (7am on sundays) and close late 10pm (9pm mondays/sundays).", "author": "Frugal C."}

The paint job on the back wall is adorable and very inviting. There are three large couches as well, which is always a nice change from hard wooden cafe chairs. Pre-made snacks are delicious. (I had banana bread that was wrapped in saran wrap as well as a turnover type pastry filled with mushrooms and cheese; both were very tasty.) \n\nThe only thing that is making me write a 3 star review instead of 5 stars is their use of the Executioner. (This is an electric bug swatter that looks like a tennis racket.) The Executioner definitely works (I know someone who uses this at home and it works like a charm), but it makes me avoid purchasing any of their pastries that aren't wrapped in plastic wrap or anything they have to prep on the counters. They wave the device right over the unwrapped pastries to zap any flies that have gotten into the pastry display. Yes, it's better to have a zapped fly than one that is alive on your food, but the idea of powdered zapped bug all over a croissant isn't very appealing either. I assume they are coming in through the door that is left open (probably for ventilation since the large picture windows don't open). If they could just keep that door closed, they would probably not have to use the bug zapper. It emits a loud zapping noise too, which is distracting, especially when you realize what is going on.\n\nI hope they read this because I think it's an easy remedy to fix by shutting the door. The staff there have all been very pleasant and I have seen them cleaning the tables off when they are vacant, so they strive to keep the cafe sanitary and clean.\n\n(I just realized that I had already posted a review before with 4 stars but wanted to downgrade to 3 stars since I recently saw them wave the zapper directly over the pastries.)", "author": "Judith D."}

This is their vegetarian sandwich piled high with sprouts, pepperoncini, red onions, roasted bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese of your choice inside bread of your choice. A couple times, I think during training a new hire, they put avocado in it.. I'd order it with the sandwich any day. I usually get the sandwich with provolone cheese on rye bread that is nicely toasted. I come here for the sandwich a lot, even skipping the coffee sometimes. Turkey wrap is good too but they could use better quality turkey and maybe provolone or instead of I think American that isn't that great with the hummus.\n\nCoffee is decent, not sure how often they change the dispensers but haven't had terribly burnt coffee from them. Get their chai since they use Big Train which is sooo good dirty (w/ a shot of espresso). Big Train is more like a sweet chai powder rather than a chai tea concentrate.. so don't expect the latter. It's the same brand used at Nordstrom espresso bars, which is delicious and they often sell it there.\n\nIt's a good space to study, lots of outlets and tables and big windows for natural lighting. All the good sandwiches/food/coffee/beverages can fuel you for hours, even all day. I just wish they were open late to serve all the students living in the Outer RIchmond.

I'm usually drinking either a double cappuccino or black coffee (sometimes sweetened). Their drips are served in big thermos dispensers (the kind you'd take to an outdoor event or picnic) so if you order a regular coffee, they're only going to hand you a cup. They have brown sugar which, IMO, is better than any other sweetener. The brew is strong and flavorful. Last time I got an amazing cappuccino which I swear I can still taste. The environment is very relaxed with plenty of seating. It reminds me an old library.

Caf\u00e9 Enchante doesn't seem that different from its predecessor, Euro Caf\u00e9, though it looks nicer now that they've painted a French street scene on the walls and added an indoor fountain (a little odd).  They also added some fake plants and replaced most of the furniture.  They kept the free wi-fi, ample number of power outlets, leather couches, bathroom and the ATM.  The wooden chairs aren't padded but they're not that uncomfortable.  \n\nThe menu seems similar (sandwiches, bagels) and the pastry and deli cases seem to hold the same items it used to (e.g., piroshky, cake, croissants).  The sandwiches didn't look bad.\n\nThe latte is good ($3.25 for a medium).  I wouldn't say it's amazing but it's solid (could use more foam/milk), fairly strong and not too bitter/burnt.  \n\nThe morning crowd seemed older and Russian.  One guy with a long beard and flowing black robe was probably a Russian priest from the church across the street.  Later the laptop crowd appeared.  The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet - good for work - plus some interesting characters show up.  I'm usually able to find unlimited free parking in the area (side streets).", "author": "Lolia S."}

An iced mocha (or iced green tea) and a BLT. But the bagels are good and so is the Ham and Swiss cheese sandwich on rye/wheat.  What I like is that there is free wi-fi and you can sit for over 4 hours without them kicking you out or getting made you are using their plugs (my computer dies quick!) Plus there are chairs with tables, a few desks, fridges full of soda and juice and some sofas to sit and relax in too. The only thing I'm not a fan of is how you can obviously see a lot of people sitting and working/studying and some people give their kids free reign of the place to run around and scream.

The coffee isn't the best, but it'll do just fine given the fact that I'm guaranteed a comfortable, clean, quiet, and great place to study for hours and hours.

I'm new to the city/neighborhood and have wanted to check this place out since I moved in because it looks really nice and I need a place to get a semi-daily coffee.  I finally did today.  The decor inside this place is really nice; it looks like some fancy hotel lounge from the 1920's.  The menu looks appetizing enough.  I decided on a small coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  When the redhead taking orders (who, mind you, has been mentioned several times in these negative reviews) waltzed up to the counter, she gave me no \"good morning\", no smile, no friendly look; nothing even in the vein of customer service or acknowledging my right to come into this establishment and be treated like a human being.   But, um, okay, whatever.  Start ordering.  Told her I want a breakfast sandwich.  \"What kind of bagel\", BARELY even came out of her mouth.  \"Plain bagel\".  \"What kind of cheese?\" she asked acidly.  I told her I wanted cheddar.\n\nNow, at some point during this transaction I became so insulted that I actually started to mock her voice.  I don't know what possessed me to do this, but it was a compulsion I could not control.  I'm not going to be treated like this and not do SOMETHING to fight back.  And it definitely was not lost on her because she stopped dead in her tracks. She must not be challenged very often.\n\nThe girl actually making the sandwiches was RIDICULOUSLY nice! I mean, maybe it was just by comparison though.  Because again, redhead obviously doesn't want to be there, thinks she's better than everybody else, and even wants you to KNOW that she thinks she's better than you.\n\nThe food and coffee itself weren't too bad.  A little overpriced for what it was.  The sandwich was made with care and I appreciate that they use qualitly ingredients and don't microwave everything.\n\nAgain, I'm looking for a REGULAR place to go to.  So if it hadn't been for the fact that their cashier (and, by default, face of their organization) hadn't made me want to slash my wrists, I'd be coming back on a regular basis.

I would suggest that the sandwiches be priced about $1 or $1.50 less expensively (if I were to make this a regular haunt that could seriously add up), but good work / coffee / food station for sure.  I would give the place the full five were it just a teeeeeny bit more affordable for regular visitation.", "author": "Kennau K."}

Really, it's just like the hotel!  Which makes it all kind of cute.  \n\nI visited for the first time today in the afternoon so there were plenty of tables open.  I chose to sit right by the window which helped me focus on my task at hand rather than the ambiance of the place.  I ordered a medium Americano ($2.45) and was surprised at how good it was.  The coffee was not too dark and bitter.  \n\nI really liked that this place was calm and quiet but it was a Thursday afternoon.  I'm sure it's not so mellow on a Saturday.  Regardless, a nice place to sit and read.  I will definitely come back!  The only thing that weirded me out was when I asked the owner for the internet  password.

To make matters worse, when I tried to ask the cashier about it, she stared at me blankly until someone stepped in to help.  Maybe it was her English proficiency, but I got the feeling she was trying to brush it off.  She spoke English well enough otherwise.  She could have also been in training, but no one mentioned it, so I will assume she wasn't.

I tried the other cafes in the neighborhood, Art Bistro, Simple Pleasures, and Cafe Zephyr, and this is still my favorite. The coffee's good-not great, but good. They have lots of stuff for sale-bagels, croissants, Russian tea cakes, cookies, candy bars, ramen noodles (no idea why) and sandwiches. Kind of a \"throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\" approach, but given that the cafe is fairy new and in an area with three other cafes, I can understand. I go here to read or do homework-it is undoubtedly on of the more comfortable cafe's in the city. The couches are new and clean and firm, not dirty and sagging like in many other cafes. The whole place is kept very clean, including the bathroom. You'll see the owner and his wife walking around in the afternoons sweeping up and wiping things down. They have a huge, executive-style desk with a leather-bound office chair set up in the corner, complete with power strip, the perfect location to get work done. I jokingly say I'm \"going to the office\" when I take my laptop there to write a paper. The food is pretty good. I usually get the Bay Club sandwich, made with turkey and bacon. I always get it on sourdough. It's not as big as some other cafe sandwiches I've seen but it feels you up. It comes with a goodly amount of mayonnaise, which I like, but others might find it too \"wet\" for their tastes. \n So, the food and coffee are good, not the best, but more than passable. But where this place really shines is the ambience. Most of the cafe is filled with a Parisian street scene mural. There is a small fountain installed into a side wall. French accordion music plays on the radio. The place can come across, initially, as cheesy theme restaurant, but they keep the French theme sufficiently restrained. The staff doesn't wear barrettes or speak in fake accents or anything, and sometimes, when the owners aren't around, the staff changes the music to more standard Indie-rock fare you'll find in most cafes. There is a very eclectic mix of people there- college students doing homework, Chinese couples arguing with their children, old men playing checkers at one of the many checkerboard tables, even the black-robed priests of the Russian Orthodox cathedral across the street are a common sight. It's a very comfortable and relaxing place and is one of my favorite spot to chill out.", "author": "Eli H."}
