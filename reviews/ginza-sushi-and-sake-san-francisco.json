I know it sounds obscure but DAMNNNN was it fire. The dish is smaller than normal but for 6 bucks it was a steal. If you don't know how to eat it all you have to do is squirt the lemon on the fish. Then you put the radish (its the grated white thing on the plate) into the given sauce (also on the plate). Then you just pick at the most delicious part of the salmon, dip it in the radish sauce and enjoy ! \nPS one side of the salmon is better than the other so make sure you start with that part first ;) \n\nSKIRTTTTTTTT steak $13? - wow guys.. the yuzu mixed with the steak was amazing. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked to a medium rare. \n\nOther items ordered: \n\nChirashi bowl $19? - for 9 pieces of nigiri and rice it was pretty standard. The nigiri was good and the size of the slices were suffice. Nothing too special. \n\nService: \nOur server was nice enough to sit us at a bigger table since it wasn't too busy. But they're pretty lax, they don't really check up on you and you have to flag them down.

Most dishes ranged from $10-$20/dish and portions being on the smaller side. Three of us arrived on time and used the yelp check in for a free litchi ice tea. When the fourth one finally came 30min later, there was no more yelp check in offer. We weren't sure if the restaurant took down the free check in because we had already redeemed three freebies or if there was a glitch on yelp. The litchi iced tea was very delicious.\n\nThe Daburu roll ($11) was delicious. I am a sucker for anything with fresh salmon and lemon. It was a light and refreshing roll. The Kaiyo roll ($14) was also very good. The fried potato chips garnished on top of the roll was a very interesting addition to the roll. With only 8 small pieces per roll, shared amongst two people, we weren't full. \n\nI tasted the tofu steak my friend ordered and it was really good. It came with three pieces of small tofu, asparagus, tomatoes, and a bowl of rice. There wasn't much of it. \n\nQuality of the food was excellent, but the portions resemble Japanese portions more than American portions. Do not come here if you are hungry and plan to get full without spending $$$. My friend, after ordering a sushi roll (which came with 5 pieces) and steak appetizer, wanted to go to Chipotle after his meal.\n\nThe one star taken off was mainly for the slow service.

They were: butter scallop (comes with white miso soup), seaweed salad, beef tataki, and 8 other nigiri which I will put caption on my photos. Overall, the food was mediocre, but indeed there were several dishes the highlight of the entire meal that I strongly recommend you to try-seared halibut topped with Ikura nigiri, and the butter scallop as an entree. They are both nicely flavored and will definitely give your tongue a kick.\n\nOne thing I must say is that the service needs to be improved. There were occasions that the service is so bad that it irritated me. I have to mention things more than twice to a waitress, or they would forget it. They even forgot to bring me the soup that comes with the scallop until I literally requested for it... \n\nWell. If you live near the place, you could try their sushi, but it does not worth to drive for a long distance to this place :)", "author": "Annabelle L."}

With all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be my new go-to Japanese restaurant.  \n\nFirst let me start by saying that we went during Happy Hour, but they purposely did not show us the Happy Hour menu until we asked for it.  We ordered the California rolls and Agedashi Tofu from their happy hour menu for $5 each.  When it came out, there were 6 small/medium sized pieces of sushi and 3 small pieces of Agedashi tofu.  Since this was my first time eating here, I'm not sure if they made the portions smaller for Happy Hour or if this is their normal size, but it was not worth the price with plenty of comparable restaurants nearby.      \n\nTheir entrees were average.  For the price, you can get a lot better of a deal in Japan town.  A pet peeve of mine is when restaurants show gratuity calculations on the bottom of the receipt calculated \"After Taxes\" without telling you that.  This was the case with Ginza and I find this to be pretty deceptive and a lot of people probably wouldn't catch this.", "author": "Justin Y."}

I really love when the chefs take their time with the meal. I prefer to wait twenty to thirty minutes for a roll if it is good. They take their time, but it is worth it. Try not to be in a rush. The staff prefers if you sit with the menu for a long time so you can make the right decision on your meal. Maybe have some tea and a scone a few blocks down before hand so you can relax and not be in a rush.", "author": "Sam B."}

Creations are fairly inventive but for the price, it's pretty mediocre.  And for whatever reason, only once out of three times have they figured out to read the directions to keep the fish sushi separate from the vegetarian sushi. So attention to detail is not their strong suit.  I don't think we will order from here again, it's been too off the mark each time for the price you pay.", "author": "Saminda W."}

The chefs are constantly working hard- food was great and prices are reasonable. 1st of all - don't bother making a reservation, they tried sitting us at a table that was nested right up against the host stand 1 inch from the table next to it.\n\nThen we received attitude when we wanted to sit closer to the back (even after making a reservation for a table there). The waiter threw the menus down and walked to the back when we pointed out there was a table that was open. 2nd of all, seconds after being seated, the waitress wanted our order and kept saying \"that's it?\" every time. To wrap up the night, when the check came, before I could even sign my name...the waitress was waiting beside me for the receipt (I realized it was 9:50pm and they were cleaning up to close). People were sweeping and banging dishes around... She also opened it to check the tip on the way to the back. \n\nAll in all, save your tip to give to the chefs here.

She provided me with the menu and I was confused because I had thought there was a lunch menu too. So then I asked her for it, she took away the original menu and gave me the lunch menu instead. Why weren't both presented in the first place? I'm assuming she knowingly did not provide the lunch menu so I can spend more on the regular menu (later I saw her doing this to another family that walked in).\n\nThe food itself was mediocre, the service wasn't great despite it being not busy at all, the service was dubious and it was just very unsatisfying all around. \n\nWould not come back or recommend.", "author": "M L."}

But it was exactly these extra ingredients that made me not like the rolls after the first couple pieces.  For example, one had lemon for zest, and another had potato for flavor...

Located on bustling Haight Street, Ginza doesn't just cater to tourists, but provided one of the better sushi experiences I've had in awhile. \n\nFor starters, we checked into Yelp and Ginza gave us a free Lychee green tea (Lychee fruit and all!) It was SUPER refreshing and tasted almost like lychee juice - couldn't make out the tea so much, but I didn't mind at all. \n\nNext up, I ordered the Kayoi roll (yellowtail, salmon, thin strips of fried sweet potato and roe on top, spicy tuna in the middle) and the buttered garlic scallop main entr\u00e9e. \n\nThe roll was one of the tastiest rolls I've had in awhile - fish super fresh, and I loved the attention to detail in the fried sweet potato. That added a super complex flavor profile that was a nice surprise. \n\nButtered Garlic Scallop bowl was definitely buttery - a little too buttery. I felt the rice was drenched in garlic butter and the dish itself ended up feeling too heavy. I recommend lightening up on the butter before I would order again. Scallops were cooked well, though. That was definitely the highlight for this dish.\n\nLastly, we checked in on Facebook and added a picture and for that, got a free housemade dessert! I was honestly expecting matcha ice cream or something, but when the matcha creme brul\u00e9e came out, I was so pleasantly surprised. It was very very tasty, you could taste the matcha in the creme and all is well with the world. Would recommend Ginza if you're in the area and craving sushi.

Our waitress seemed to try to play it off by pretending she didn't speak English and acting like some sort of a coy geisha, walking by our table very quickly and sort of nodding in our direction but ignoring us.\n\nThere were several parts that were disappointing. It started with a table of six people who came in at least ten minutes after us getting their edamame before us. (There were two of us.)\n\nIt continued with silence from our server not having any sort of update about what the hell was going on. I can understand screwing something up, not putting our order in, something like that. People make mistakes. Purposefully ignoring us and not resetting our expectations was a bigger problem.\n\nAt some point, when we still don't have food, I notice we also don't have soy sauce. I asked that she bring us soy sauce for when our sushi came out. She did her coy little nodding bullshit.\n\nAfter 50 minutes of waiting, no edamame, no water refills. Guess what?

Furthermore, although the chirarshi bowl is $17, Ginza only gives you two thin pieces of salmon/tuna/mackerel/yellowfish and one shrimp. That chirarshi bowl was one of the most skimpy bowls I've had! \n\nThe food is lackluster and the portions are tiny.  I have no idea why this place has the rating it does. Until the prices reflect the portions and the quality of the food here, I'm not coming back to Ginza Sushi & Sake. \n\nOVERALL: Way over priced for mediocre sushi served in ridiculously small portions.

Tender chicken in a flavorful ginger soy sauce on top of 2 pieces of asparagus. This came with a bowl of rice and miso soup and I wish they would serve a little salad of some sort along with it. All in all, I recommend this dish!\n- Sushi bento set ($18) came with 4pc nigiri, 6pc sashimi, 4pc of spicy tuna roll, 4pc of CA roll, vegetable tempura, and salad or soup. Nigiris; a little smaller than I'm used to. Sashimi; thin, generally fresh and okay (a few fishy ones though). The rolls; pretty standard. Vegetable tempura; also smaller than I'm used to, but the crispy batter was good.\n- Daburu roll ($10.95) had salmon & cucumber topped with salmon & sliced lemon with yuzu tobiko. Just an okay roll for me... the salmon was a bit colder than we would have liked - made eating the roll slightly uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, I felt everything was just... miniaturized! Although maybe they are huge on presentation and what not, but for the price, I feel I can have a more fresh and tastier (not to mention bigger) meal elsewhere. Service was amazing though - no complaints there, as they were very friendly from the moment we walked in.

I mentioned this to our waitress, Ming, and she told me that everything is made-to-order and not prepared beforehand.  They don't even batter the soft-shell crab until it's ordered.

Every flavor is unique and delicious - the gyoza is the best I've ever had, the drinks are super scrumptious, the ginger is flavorful and potent. The first time I came, the service was exceptional. The second time I came, it was mediocre at best. We were waiting for our ticket to come for at least 20 minutes (probably more) before one of us finally went to the bar to ask for it. We also didn't get our waters until after we'd received our food.  So I give this place 4 stars, which is a 5 for the food and a 3 for the service.

The sauce on the Tofu Steak was lovely. Nice, sweet flavor yet very savory. I felt the portion was a little small considering the price. The Tera roll had very unique ingredients. I haven't seen that combination in a roll before which was exciting because usually vegetarian rolls are not very innovative. I enjoyed the roll but it didn't wow me. The presentation is nice though and it was fun to try something new. We ordered the fried ice cream for dessert. It wasn't as hot (temperature-wise) as I've normally had it.

The chefs reveal their lack of training in the quality of their rice and tamago, both have incorrect texture and flavor. Fish quality was very average. They were out of half of the nigiri we ordered.

We also got the Kazan which was really good but a little more difficult to eat, fell apart a little more cuz it was warm (which was a good thing for taste)\n\nWe also got the daburu and Katsura, both were good but lighter then the first too, definitely some\nUnique flavors with the lemon.", "author": "Emory S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-28", "description": "Ginza opened up on December 27, 2015 on Haight Street, in a location that formerly housed Kan Zaman and then Great Indian Food.  We have been starved for good restaurants in the Haight, and over the past 5 years we have been getting more options slowly but steadily. \nGinza fits the mold of the new type of place opening up in the Haight.  I ate there the second night they were open, so I will reserve ultimate judgement, but I am optimistic that I have a solid sushi option less than a block from my house...which would be incredible.  \nThe sushi was fresh and inventive, and some dishes really shined.  The spicy scallop roll was done a bit differently than normal and it was great, and the edamame with garlic and soy sauce were fantastic.  We had some sake, and the selection was small but nice, though on the expensive side.  In fact, the place in general was a bit more expensive than I expected, though the food was already showing signs of being fresh and well above your average sushi spot. \nService was friendly and nice, though maybe a bit less than polished.  I wouldn't complain at all though, and it was their second night.  Everyone was sweet and it was a good start.  \n\nJudgment shall be reserved, but let's just say that this place is immediately on my watch list for a local standard.  The only issue I had was that the place was freezing--it's been cold out and it was super cold inside as well.  Hopefully that can be remedied!  \n\nSo, let's just sum up what I am trying to say--the place is just getting going, but the first meal I had there on their second day of business was excellent.  Fresh sushi, good drinks, nice staff, solid decor, and a huge upgrade for the neighborhood.  Let's hope they get even better!", "author": "Blake W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "On a global basis, this isn't a 5-star sushi restaurant but in SF Bay Area it is, since so many of the 4-star rated ones are actually kinda shitty and this place was a definitely a tier above them.  Here is why they are good:\n\n- They don't give you an ENORMOUS piece of fish in their nigiri.  Seriously, I don't understand why so many mediocre sushi places do this.  Is it that hard to cut the piece a little smaller?  It is supposed to be bite-sized, not a huge hunk of fish.  This means their sushi chefs are at least not-clueless.\n- The quality (freshness) of the fish was very good.  This is at least pretty par for SF sushi places, even the ones where the chef skill is mediocre.\n- The agadashi tofu was actually crunchy on the outside, even after a bit of time being soaked in the broth.  That's impressive.\n- They are open on Mondays.  Good for those of us who like to eat sushi on Mondays.\n- They are open in the afternoon past 2:30pm.  Good for those of us with irregular schedules who find the \"closing at 2/2:30pm\" convention of many sushi restaurants infuriating.\n- Their tea service is a little fancy.  I don't care too much about tea, but I appreciated it.\n\nPrice was commensurate with quality.", "author": "Yishan W."}

I was there with my partner and our 9 month old son. The bill came , and I paid with my card and went to the restroom to clean my son's bottle. I came out, and my partner was engaging in a verbal argument with our server. I asked him what was going on , and he said our server had disrepected him over us not tipping . I had crossed the line tip out , and she had come back and said that there was not tip, so my partner had circled the tip line I had crossed out and sent it back. She had came back again, saying that the was not tip. My partner explained that we were not tipping. And she told him, loudly, in front of the whole restaurant, if you aren't going to tip, next time, order to go. He told me that out side and I walked back in there an confronted her. What type of customer service is that. Where is there a sign that saying that gratuity it a must. Tipping is never required. You get a pay check honey, maybe if your service was better you would get tipped. I got on her line and most of the patrons seemed to agree.

Great lunch specials, we ordered a roll combo ($11) and sashimi/sushi bento combo ($18) which came with a tuna roll, california roll and rainbow roll (you can also select a dragon roll or the chef special instead) for the roll combo or 4 pieces of nigiri and 6 pieces of sashimi plus tempura for the bento combo, and the standard miso soup. Considering how fresh and tasty the fish was and the quantity of food, thought this was a great deal. The decor is also quite a step up from most other places in the hood, modern and stylish, I could see this being a cozy date spot. Would recommend this place if you live nearby or are in the hood!", "author": "Valerie C."}

Koo on Irving has long been our favorite, but when Ginza opened just a block away we thought we'd give it a try, maybe for this times we didn't want to hunt for parking near Koo. Got some take out and thought it was surprisingly good, so went there for a full dinner. Simply excellent, every course. Got a dozen oysters, fresh, briny, lightly but well seasoned, and only $1.50 each before 6. (we walked in at 5:59 and they still gave us the deal.)  Tempura was served hot, greaseless, excellent batter, the shrimp still moist and not overcooked as if often the case at even the better Japanese.  All the nigiri was glistening, but the tuna toro and the yellowtail toro were outstanding, creamy, melt in your mouth texture from the belly fat, just wonderful.  Even the green tea and miso were top notch, not just an afterthought.   Highly recommended.", "author": "Greg R."}

I really hope they put it on the menu full time at some point. We enjoyed the Clams in Yuzu broth with Garlic toast. Its a nice space with good service. I'll definitely be back with friends.", "author": "Tony M."}

The Daburu roll was also very fresh and the flavor was perfect. Our waitress Lisa was also super top notch and was very nice. She even held the door open for us as we left. Overall it was a great experience and I would go again. Meow!", "author": "Jordan L."}
