This means if you need anything after you sit down, there is no table service so you have to return to the front to ask for anything. We had to do that a few times because there was no dressing on the salads, and we only had 3/4 silverware at the table. Not a huge deal but it was a little annoying to keep getting up after we had started eating.\n\nThe menu is huge so it can be a little difficult to order because it's so overwhelming - which is not necessarily a bad thing!! I went in a group of 4 and we all ordered lunch combos, giving us a soup and sandwich or a salad and sandwich each. All of the food was fine and filling, but nothing to write home about. However, we did not order any crepes so I do want to return to try them.

Upon walking in weren't greeted or acknowledged, which left us wondering what to do.  We just sat down at a table because, I guess that's how it works? We picked up a paper menu and picked out what we thought sounded good.  They have a lot more savory crepes than sweet, I assumed that was because they're open pretty late but I opted for the banana-Nutella classic along with their blueberry pancakes, chai and fresh squeezed OJ. The pancakes and crepes don't come with sides so I ordered a side of egg (1) & a side of bacon (3). This all came up to $42.  Which I think is pushing it for 1 crepe & 2 pancakes and boxed chai. \n\nThe pancakes were good but the blueberries were a little hard, possibly due to being previously frozen. \n\nAll in all , just an \"okay\" experience.", "author": "Sydney S."}

I asked her had she refunded me for the beer she replied yes and because I was trying to be fair I gave her back the money for Said beer only then to realize that she hadn't and I had just given her back money that belongs to me so thanks again for a $10 plus disgusting sandwich that was in edible and I suggest you go elsewhere for decent food in the neighborhood, I knew I should've stuck with burger meister as they have never let me down in this way don't take my word for it, but if you hear somebody say do you know how to pour a beer that should be a huge red flag for you!

Is that due to some group discount they got? Or were they all franchised and then spun themselves off? Or is it supposed to transplant you to Paris? Anyway ... that was just a little rant unrelated to the review to get you ready for the crappy review below.\n\nBottom line, the food wasn't anything I would want to eat again. I'll admit, I got the Salsa Crepe, which probably isn't the best option. It's just that the people I went with seemed so content with going to the restaurant again that I thought it would be good. Anyway, the crepe was kind of mealy, there were bits of rotten avocado (or at least it had gone black and they hadn't bothered to cut those bits out), and a general lack of seasoning. A friend got a salad and she said it lacked any flavor. Several people got add-ons (like tofu or chicken) and they came separate from the dishes and we had to remind them. The clincher was that they got balsamic for one of the salads but forgot oil ... and then kept asking if we'd like oil, but kept forgetting to bring it. Sorry, but that's just silly service.\n\nThere are so many place (including Padrecito, which is always tasty) nearby that I can be 100% sure I'll never return here.", "author": "Akash K."}

It was very thin and bland with hardly any vodka. After adding a hefty amount of tabasco it was drinkable. What a waste of $7. \nWe all ordered different variations of scrambles, which were lacking flavor and overpriced. The vegetables did not taste fresh, and a friend at my table even commented it tasted \"like DiGiorno pizza, and it wasn't even delivery\". The side of potatoes were extremely undercooked and unseasoned, and the toast was not even toasted, it was simply sliced bread. \nAlso, everything on the table was nearly empty- ketchup, salt and pepper, forcing us to steal them from a neighboring table. \nMy friend who ordered the San Francisco Benedict and iced coffee is the only one who didn't complain about her meal, so perhaps that is the way to go if you're eating here. \nI wanted to love this place, there was plenty of open seating, and the menu was large with lots of options- but sadly that's where the positivity ends.", "author": "McKenna P."}

Alright, no big deal.\n\nAfter maybe 15-20 minutes, the first 4 in our group got their 4 meals. After 10 minutes of waiting for us to get our meals so we could all begin eating, our 3 meals still weren't there so we gave them the go ahead to start eating. While us 3 waited, maybe 8 other plates came out for people that came after us. We thought \"oh maybe it's because they got pancakes/crepes, which are easier to make.\" Nope, some were the same exact meal my friend and I ordered in the later group! \n\nTo make matters worse, once our food finally came (about 15-20 minutes in total later than our friends) I got the special (a crepe Benedict) that didn't even have hollandaise on it, as advertised. Also, my friends' plate in the later group didn't have avocado or sour cream, also as advertised. Not a good look for 2/3 of the meals to be missing an ingredient! \n\nThe food was fine, but the staff/management just needs to get their priorities straight! If you can't get everyone's meal out at the same time, either let them know, or hold all of the plates until they're ready.

I understand throwing down a plain crepe so that you can charge for things like sugar or salt, but when the crepe to filling ratio is 3:1, a plain crepe turns into a weak point, bringing down the whole dish. My peanut butter and nutella filling was fine, but something that puzzled me (as you'll see in the pic) was a mess of what appeared to just be some runny canned whipped cream on the side. Why? A fresh spoonful? Great, but otherwise why bother? All in all, I wasn't a fan.

Plus, I've always seen this place with people but it's never overly packed so I was curious to see how it compares to other brunch food type places I've been to.\n\nRight when walking into the restaurant, I noticed how quiet this place was for the most part.

They serve food like omelettes, sandwiches, pancakes, bagels, salads, and of course, crepes!

I got the Fisherman's Wharf (smoked salmon, havarti, capers, dill, red onions, spinach) and my friend got the Bon Jour (goat cheese, eggs, onion, chicken apple sausage). Both ranged around $11-$12 which was alright considering all savory crepes come with potatoes and mixed greens on the side. Overall I thought the food was alright. Not bad for the portion sizes but I don't think it is something to rant or rave about. It was filling at least! \n\nOnly one bathroom but it was really well kept and clean. I would come back here again to try other options and maybe even a dessert crepe. I also really enjoy the atmosphere here.

Sadly though, the chicken pesto crepe was downright bland.

My wife and I come here all the time, for breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between. I am addicted to their soups and their sandwiches - the eggplant sandwich and grilled chicken w/pesto are THE BEST.\n\nTheir breakfast is fantastic as well. Their blueberry pancakes are phenomenal, though you may have to request extra syrup- they give you a HUGE portion. French toast is up there too, as well as their large range of benedicts that are available. Ask them to toast the English muffins first when you order.\n\nIf you want to go the crepe route, you can get one of the pre-configured options or you can make your own to spec. My wife gets spinach, artichokes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, garlic and havarti cheese, and it's awesome. For dessert crepes, you can't lose with a banana-nutella crepe.\n\nThey will also do what my wife and I call the Hangover Cure, which is fresh carrot juice with orange juice mixed in. Just ask and you shall be saved from the crappy red wine your friends brought over the night before.\n\nThe owner, Sam, is a great guy and is often there. He can be tough but he demands excellence and he gets it. He wants every customer to have a great experience and it shows. All the server gals are great too, especially when they get to know you.\n\nI think the best thing about Crepes is the atmosphere. Having lived in Cole Valley for eight years I can safely say many of the cafes in Cole Valley are lacking in this respect. Most of them are poorly laid out, loud, cold and cramped. Crepes is none of these.\n\nCrepes is right on the corner of Carl and Cole. If you want to just space out, grab a window seat and watch the N-Judah and the people go by, this is your place. If you want to grab a bite pretty much any normal time of day that is solid and tasty, this is your place. If you want a no-frills breakfast, this is your place. If you just want some tea and a cookie and an awesome space to work, you will love it too.\n\nNote: There is no Wi-fi, and that's a good thing- it weeds out the cheapos who don't want to pay for their own bandwidth and who buy one thing and camp out for 7 hours.", "author": "Nowell V."}

Turns out I ended up coming here twice for lunch. I must say that their crepes are not bad. Sometimes a hit or miss, but generally pretty good when there's warm melted cheese stuffed in there. \n\nThe first time I ordered a crepe, I thought I had to eat it like a burrito before figuring out it was a fork and knife type of food. The ingredients would always flop out when I attempted to hold it together with my hands, while people would look at me funny as I did this. It wasn't until I started learning how to make these that I had to use a fork and knife.

It's spacious, always has 2.95 beers on tap (if this was in Portland or Anchorage it'd be packed 24/7), it's got outlets, employees are courteous, only 1 bathroom but it's always in good shape, and the food is better than good, it's YUM!\n\nI live around the corner so Zazie's is often an option that I pass on.  \nWhy?

I wasn't expecting much service-wise--just some good food. \n\nThree of us came in and ordered when they weren't too busy and figured it wouldn't be too long of a wait. After about 20 minutes we started noticing that everyone who had walked in and ordered after us had already gotten their food. I thought it was since they had ordered crepes and we'd gotten egg dishes, but then I saw my exact meal come to the table next to us who came in 10 minutes after us. \n\nOur food came after about 30 minutes, and the scrambled eggs were cold to the point where the cheese was hardened and congealed. We sent them back and oddly enough got new eggs within 4 or 5 minutes so not sure what the initial wait was.\n\nThe eggs Benedict (I know I know what was I thinking) was very subpar--almost no hollandaise and a weirdly large english muffin for such a tiny egg. The scrambled eggs were pretty whatever. If you can't get scrambled eggs right the first time that's a little disappointing. The pancakes were surprisingly good, so I'll give them points for that. \n\nAll in all it was just a very mediocre meal with not great service. Would've been find if I were at a greasy spoon diner but this place seems to think of itself as a step up. I can forgive long waits and so-so service if the food is worth it but I walked out really disappointed in the food.", "author": "Molly O."}

Crepes on Cole used to be my go-to breakfast spot, but the last couple times I went, I have been very disappointed. \n\nYesterday, I came in with a few friends. One of my friends decided to save a table while the rest of us ordered our food. After we were done ordering, he went up and ordered (several minutes later). \n\nThe three of us who ordered food first got our dishes around the same time. We began eating our food and when we were all about 2/3's done, my friend still hadn't gotten his food. We flagged one of the waitresses down and she said she would look into it. About 5 minutes later she came back and told us she had not found his order ticket and asked him what he ordered. At this time, another friend of mine came in and asked if he could add his order to the order that was lost. She said she could not do that and asked him to go wait in the long line to order. You would think that the girl would say sorry, or try to accomodate my other friend after the mistake...but no, she didn't seem to care.\n\nMy friends dish finally showed up. At this point, I wasn't too thrilled at the service so I politely asked her to comp the meal that was forgotten about. She said she couldn't do that but might be able to get us a free drink. A free drink?? I told her we have been waiting an hour for his food since he ordered...the other 3 of us finished our food about 10 minutes ago. \n\nSure enough, the waitress never came back to tell us anything. I had to go find her and ask nicely to speak with her manager.  She said he was at the cash register. I have seen him before from previous times coming to crepes on cole...I think he is the owner. I went up to him and politely asked him to comp the meal that was lost. I told him we waited an hour for my friends meal. I also mentioned that nobody even said sorry for the mistake. He turned around to look at his staff and looked at me with an angry expression on his face. \"An hour?? You did not wait an hour!.\" He then said these exact words: \"You want the entire staff to apologize to you??.\" At the same time he grabbed 11 dollars from the register and slammed it on the table. \"Here is your refund, have a nice day\" in a disgusted tone. I told him I didn't want the whole staff to apologize....then I took the money and walked away.\n\nI could not believe I got that kind of attitude from the manager. It is not like I was one of those angry/entitled customers. I will not be coming here anymore nor recommending it to my friends. Go to Crepevine in the inner sunset instead.

But like finding a good dude, I have learned after today, to never settle.  \n\nThe servers are consistently rude.  Today, the lady may as well have been comatose when taking my order.  The prices however, are nothing short of inconsistent.  One day it's 12 bones for two bagels and two coffees, another day it's 16 bones for same order.  After said zombie bitch waitress took my order, I found out they were out of the bagels I wanted, so I settled for my second choice, only to get it home and find that it was sesame (totes not my second or even 4th choice), AND it was stale to boot.  It also seems that they may frequent to the grocery outlet to pick out some amazing rotten produce, because the sour limp green pieces of shit on my bagel could not have been cucumbers.\n\nAll and all, besides the gnartastic soap bagel from the Grove, this really could have been some of the sickest food-like substance I have ever consumed.

Not to mention, on the menu it said the sandwich came with sprouts, and there were no sprouts to speak of! The slices of tomato are thin. Also, the amount of food was noticeably less than in Palo Alto. I was full after eating half the sandwich there. Here, I'm still hungry after eating the whole thing. There's less tuna and the one there came with avocado. The positives here are that food is quick. My sandwich was out in less than 5 minutes. The cashier also threw in cheese for free.

I walked in and asked if I can sit outside and if I order there or at the counter.  I was told to order at the counter and they would bring my food out.  Sounded great on this beautiful afternoon.  The gentleman I placed my order with was older with grey hair and extremely friendly.  I  was in the mood for a dessert crepe after my lunch and wanted to make sure they'd still be open.  He joked that they didn't close until 10pm so take my time.  I ordered a custom crepe and a coffee.  He gave me my coffee in a mug and since I was sitting outside and I didn't want to have to have my server (as I thought was the case) go back and forth, I asked to have it put in a large to go cup.  I paid my bill with a tip for what I assumed would be  for my server.\n\nI nearly finished my coffee when my food came out.  The woman who brought my food was in her mid 30's and put my plate in front of me and took my number.  She didn't bring or offer hot sauce, ketchup,salt or pepper but it wasn't a big deal.  I asked if I could get a refill on my coffee and she took my cup and brought it back to my table.  There was no cream so I asked if I can have some cream for it.  This is where the experience went bad, very bad.  She told me that they don't take care of coffee refills and that I can go get the cream myself.  I thought she was kidding but when I asked her why I had tipped when I paid the bill at the beginning of my order she had no answer.  I told her I just needed some cream for my coffee and she literally walked away from me completely ignoring my request and told me to get it myself.  A few minutes later the nice older man came out with a small pitcher of cream which I thanked him for.  \n\nMy crepe was great, the coffee was good but the attitude of the other woman who was working the counter and tables was beyond terrible.  What a turn off.  It wasn't even the fact that she didn't bring cream, it was her attitude as she told me to get it myself.  She had dirty blonde hair and was dressed a bit like Holly Hobby on 3/13 when I dined.  I'm in the restaurant/hospitality business and she's the type that will ruin a perfectly good experience/restaurant with a sour apple attitude.  I liked the place for food, however she doesn't belong around people.  Possibly a spot in the kitchen or as a dishwasher would be more fitting for her attitude.  Would love to try again, but not if she's here.\n\nKind of sad someone can be so bitter and hurt a business.  4 stars for food,1 star for service.

We had been playing at the playground at Golden Gate Park when it started raining, so we decided it was time to get some lunch. This was about a brisk one mile walk from the park. When we arrived at about 1pm every table was full. It is a seat yourself kind of place, so we worried for a few minutes about finding someplace that would accomodate our party of six with two kids, one needing a high chair. \n\nCrepes on Cole looks like your typical crepe place right down to the very similar chalk board menus on the wall. I was a little worried because I haven't always had the best luck with places like that in terms of food and my first impression of the service was less than stellar. My husband decided to start ordering at the counter without asking if I was ready and my mom and brother were hanging back looking for a table. The guy who was taking orders was very impatient and brusque when I took a second to name what I wanted. I turned to try and wave my mother over to place her order and he was already giving us our total. There was no one else behind us in line, so I thought that was fairly ridiculous. When my mom had to go up and place her order afterwards, he was similarly rude to her when she inquired if they had french fries. \n\nMy brother managed to snag a table while we were ordering and they did have high chairs, so my youngest son had a decent place to sit. After we were seated everything took a turn for the better. The waitresses who dropped off the food were all very friendly and efficient and our food was much better than I have experienced in crepe places in the past. My crepe was large and filled with yummy chicken, pesto, cheese and tomatoes. I loved that it came with both salad and potatoes and I was not forced to just choose one. My boys' grilled cheese sandwiches also came with potatoes and fruit. My mom got a huge salad that looked abundant and very fresh with nice slices of apples, chunks of blue cheese and candied walnuts on top. She also got a cup of soup that was more like a bowl, with lots of chunky veggies. My husband got some delicious looking french toast and a side of scrambled eggs. My brother's omelette looked fantastic as well and came with more toast than he could finish. I would have loved to have also tried one of the sweet crepes with a side of ice cream, but unfortunately we were all too stuffed, but they looked fantastic from what I saw at neighboring tables.", "author": "Lisa H."}

Today the service was frustratingly bad enough to get an angry review from me.\n\nI came in with my girlfriend and mother for brunch, and there was a bit of line, but it was moving fast enough and there were plenty of tables.\n\nI waited in line, got to the front, and ordered from an older guy with a mustache (maybe the owner?). It was fine until the server next to him grabbed my table number so quickly I wasn't sure what was going on, and used it for someone else's order. Before I left the counter I checked on this and the guy got visibly frustrated with me like I was playing some kind of trick on him. I told him I didn't go anywhere and I thought the other person grabbed my number. Not really a huge deal but seriously man... check with your staff before you vent on people. I feel like he gave me weird look when I only put a 10% tip on my check, but that could have just been my impression. If you want more, seriously chill out and show some patience with people.\n\nWhile waiting for the food I saw him repeat this kind of behavior with everyone else in line and figured it was worth mentioning. \n\nSo we waited. And waited. I saw several tables with much larger parties than mine who arrived later get all their food. By the time 40 minutes went by I checked with a blonde server about my order and she said she would go back to the kitchen. Cool, there was hope now.\n\nShe came back out and visited several other tables without saying a word. I gave her another 5-10 minutes before I went up to her and asked about the order. \"YES! I'll bring it to you when it's ready!!\" she impatiently replied. Seriously? I'm being unreasonable here?\n\nIt only takes 10 seconds to let someone know what's going on. It makes them feel better when they've waited a long time and they're hungry. I've worked in a restaurant and I can tell when something goes back as a re-fire because someone forgot the ticket. Customers can be really understanding. But this staff apparently can't even spare a few seconds of politeness. When someone's hungry, it's really the wrong time to be impatient or rude. Especially if you want repeat business.\n\nThe food came out soon after I checked on it and 2 out of 3 of our orders were good. The french toast was great. My girlfriend thought her Bonjour crepe was pretty tasteless but my mom liked the blueberry pancakes.\n\nI'm really mixed if I'll come back here again.

A friend had another breakfast plan, but as I feel might be common in a place like Cole Valley, we had to go with our backup. Parts of my culinary experience were great, others were not my favorite. (My mom always taught me you never say you don't like what others are serving, you just say it's not your favorite.)\n\nPlus: Good selection of savory and sweet crepes. Sometimes places specialize in one or the other, and it's nice to have lots of choices.\n\nMinus: Too much! Overwhelmed! Decision-making fatigue induced! I appreciate a desire to offer options, but similar to Filter in Chicago (I did review them, right?), I just couldn't choose. \n\nPlus: The potatoes. Delicioso! Well seasoned and crispy while still tender inside. Truly great.\n\nMinus: The crepe. Good fresh ingredients, but kind of a weird combo of flavors (I got the Cole Valley--maybe that's saying something!).\n\nPlus: Quick turnaround after ordering. Much faster than waiter service.\n\nMinus: Potential for hazardously long lines snaking among tables and moving very slowly and eyeing my breakfast jealously.\n\nPlus: Friendly staff! Absolutely everyone was enjoyable to interact with. \n\nSo, kind of a balance. I'm not sure I'd go back again if I go back again to San Fran, only because there are so many options.

The Apple Crepe was good with apple cinnamon cheddar and sour cream, same with the Cole Valley Crepe. However I was disappointed with the Brown Sugar desert crepe (brown sugar, butter, lemon) and I thought it would come with ice cream but maybe it didn't because I got it to go - so that one tasted delicious but was a little disappointing seeing a single flat crepe with no filling or side for $7.", "author": "Kevin M."}

This past weekend I convinced a friend to drive across the city just because the place really has a good vibe, great proportions, excellent breakfast menu.  Well, we split a crepe and I watched as she pulled a chunk of wood out of her food.  It had obviously been cooked with the mixture.  I'm not talking about a sliver of wood or something.  This was an actually CHUNK of wood.  When she showed it to the manager (?), he was very apologetic but said that the same thing had happened before.  WTF?  Anyway, he gave my friend a $10 off coupon and apologized again.  However, I don't think she'll be going back any time soon... or EVER.  As for me, I'm not so sure......", "author": "Morgan G."}

The curry crepe is also pretty interesting and tasty if you are in for yellow/brown curry flavors.  Pesto/Pesto Chicken is also solid if a little weird to the tastebuds.\n\nThe home potatoes are also really good!\n\nThe beer special is great - makes this a solid place to hang and have a brew if you're not up for loud music but are down for brews and solid conversation.

So I must be some kind of expert, right?\n\nEnough with the sarcasm. This place serves great crepes, with a delicious side of potatoes and salad if they're savory or whipped cream if they're sweet. The choices are vast between savory and dessert crepes, and even past that there are bagels, omelets, eggs, french toast...you name it. I have tried every crepe on the menu and I don't remember ever being dissatisfied. Sure, they aren't Parisian delicacies, and I'm sure you could find some gourmet crepe shop in the city with more authentic french crepes, but that is not the point. These crepes are filling, thick and heavy, loaded with ingredients; they offer some new interesting combination of ingredients too. \n\nAnd, you have to trust me on this, the owner is an awesome guy. He remembers me every time I come in even when I have been away at college for months. He asks how his regulars are doing and treats newcomers like regulars too. He cracks jokes, makes you comfortable, but doesn't overplay the host thing. The staff has always been nice to me. Never rushed me, even if I stay long past when I've finished my meal. It's so comfortable to be there.\n\nOn top of all that, add these delicious tidbits:\nThe restaurant is cozy and always has local art on display. It has a hand drawn chalkboard menu. Big windows for lots of light. The N rolls right past. Heart of Cole Valley. Hop skip and a jump from the Haight Ashbury. The building it's in used the be \"The Other Cafe\" where Dana Carvey performed a lot.\n\nI'm not saying this place is my religion. I'm not forcing you to go there. I just had to stand up for a place that has always been so wonderful for me. Thanks, Crepes on Cole.", "author": "India K."}

I ordered a crepe to go - the crepe benedict. As it was around the same price as a regular eggs benedict, I assumed it would be a similar amount of food. However, when I opened my takeout box I found that it was just a single egg with the tiniest drizzle of hollandaise sauce perched on top of a small, flavorless crepe. Which is not to suggest that anything else in the box had any flavor. Maybe I should have eaten in and poured lots of salt on everything? \nThe food was terrible. No flavor, tiny portion, and a mushy crepe. The service was mediocre. It was a Sunday morning so the restaurant was understandably busy, but all the staff seemed more stressed than would have been justified. This may have been because the owner (manager? Not entirely sure, but he acted like he owned the place) was unpleasant to all of them. Standing by the counter waiting for my food (which was another thing - they had no place to wait for takeout and they didn't take down my name, so I didn't feel like I could wait outside or anywhere other than right by the busy counter), I got to watch him angrily ordering the staff around and telling people off for things that clearly weren't their fault.

The prices, while not inexpensive, are very reasonable for what one gets as well (just be sure to bring cash, though). A waiter service component might have been nice, but for some a register order might be more preferable and this location does provide that experience. \n\nIn terms of our crepes of choice, we have gone with the salsa ones (being one of the few locations were we have ordered the same dish). It just seems like the standout entry on the menu, although the salsa itself tastes a little \"generic\". Not bad, but comparable to the ingredients and slight taste one might expect to find from a store bought variety in a bottle.\n\nOverall, due to proximity, its likely we will be back. Not the best crepes around, but the place offers a unique experience and is far more reasonable with its pricing (since they give you more than just a crepe) than others in SF.", "author": "Sami R."}

I know, because I used to work there.\n\nAs an ex-employee of this establishment, I can get you the goods... or bads, about this stinky little hole of narlyness, sexism, and the general disregard of their employees. \n\nLet see, where to start... They will only hire Hispanic men to work in the kitchen. Why? Because they know they can get away with overworking them and sticking them in a little hole of a kitchen without any ventilation.\n\nThey pay minimum wage with no chance for a raise. And they never, ever pay over time or time and a half (as the law requires). Ever. Even though they make all their employees work on New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and all other major Holidays. Why? Because they know they will be busy because everyone else is closed.\n\nIf you ever have the misfortune of working at this dump, you will be subject to the shorter brother's little temper tantrums, who one day decided to fire me because I had the cook rearrange my breakfast bagel and side of portabello mushrooms  into a sandwich. \n\nWhy, you ask? Because employees are only \"privileged\" to eat crepes with 2 or 3 ingredients not including chicken, avocado and some cheese (I can't remember which), unless they paid for it. And they are not allowed to have a sandwich, unless they pay for it. But we were allowed to have eggs with a bagel and a side of something. So I order the bagel, skip the eggs, with a side of portabello mushrooms, and asked the cook to arrange it as a sandwich instead. \n\nNow, I will admit that the first time I did it was to piss-off that little bitch of an older brother (the shorter on with feminine hands). Unfortunately, that day he was in a good mood and just laughed it off. So I guessed it didn't matter. I ordered my breakfast like that from then on until one when he wasn't in a good mood and he went off. He yelled something about sandwiches not being on the employee menu and that made me laugh. So he fired me. Well, \"f*ck you, too\" I said (ok, so it was a bit more colorful than just a 3 word sentence.)\n\nOther things to know about Crepes on Cole:\n\nThe cooks like to comment on female costumer's body parts.\nA woman once found a rusty nail in her salad.\nIf you sit at the large round table by yourself (even if you are a little old man with his grandson) and there is no one else in the restaurant, the bigger brother will try to burn a hole through your head with his eyes and curse you behind the counter.\nTheir coffee is really bad.\nThe food is very unhealthy, just look at those big bellies behind the counter. You don't want to look like that, do you?\n\nSo that was the bad, now for the good:\n\n...hmmmm....nope. Nothing. Oh, well. I tried.\n\nThank you Yelp. I have been vindicated!!

We got our food approximately 10 minutes later. Quick, yes.\n\nThe girls working there and busing tables were really nice. We told them we had about six more people joining us and they happily obliged in clearing off tables around us when people left and adding them to ours.

I have to say that Crepes on Cole may be the worst of any of these crepe chains that I've tried. \n\nWhile it serves the \"usual\" crepes, I think the items inside their savory crepes tend to be undercooked (mushrooms especially... if they still crunch, it's not a good sign). My BF likes omelettes and will eat most breakfast food and he had a hard time eating the omelette at Crepes on Cole. Apparently the eggs were browned (eww), the mushrooms undercooked (surprise, surprise), and the whole thing generally unappetizing. The salads at these crepe places tend to be an afterthought sparsely coated with vinaigrette and Crepes is no exception.\n\nThe dining area always strikes me as slightly dark, which seems incompatible with light California crepes. Maybe that's just me... I'm pretty sure if I went there right now and had a Nutella crepe it would be delicious, but let's face it, Nutella straight from the container is 5 stars.", "author": "Amanda C."}

It was fine-- not great, but fine.  I can't remember which crepe I ordered... the one with cheddar, cottage cheese, marinara, and mushrooms.  I had them add spinach, which they did gladly.  My friend ordered the pancakes, which she had them make with blueberries and pecans.  They didn't seem to mind customizing our order at all.  We got a caprese as an appetizer, and what we got was a huge salad topped with slices of tomato and fresh mozzarella, with sliced crusty bread on the side.  Not what we were expecting, but ok.  \n\nMy crepe came with herbed homefries and a salad.  I wish the salad had been on a separate plate.  It got kind of warm and soggy, which is kinda not that appetizing. However, the portions were huge.  \n\nI wouldn't take a crosstown bus to get there, but since it's around the corner from my boyfriend's house, I'll totally take it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-21", "description": "I feel bad giving this place two stars, because the guy who must be the owner seems so nice, but, c'mon, guys, you can do better.  Go visit a few other places, taste their food, see how it's done.  A few specific gripes:\n\n- No salt in the salad dressing.  I can't believe that this omission comes from a concern for public health, based on the rest of the menu. Management: Please see recipe for \"Basic Vinaigrette\", any cookbook, anywhere.\n\n- Home fried potatoes. Props for at least not using frozen shreds, but I am not sure what they are trying to accomplish with these. Crispy browned edges or mealy, soft chunks? I think it is the former, but each sad mound of greyness is typically the latter.  They clearly don't realize that the whole POINT of home-friend potatoes is the satisfying crunch of nicely browned crust against the creamy interior.  I would actually rather have the Pork Store's processed shreds (at least they are well-fried) than these.\n\n- Bagels: Skip it.  Go across the street to Reverie and get a bagel there instead. From the taste of it, not even sure if theirs have been boiled- taste more like rolls with holes. [UPDATE JUN 08: Since Reverie is closed this week for renovations, got my bagel here this morning, and what a lovely surprise to find that they have a new, and MUCH better, bagel supplier, hooray! This was a real bagel - chewy, not too big, just dense enough with the perfect crust. The bagel-lovers of the world thank you, CoC, for no longer perpetrating bagel slander.]\n\n- Salad greens: The same anemic \"mesclun\" you see in low-end, trying-be-gourmet places everywhere.  Much better to get a nice fresh head of good old green leaf or romaine than the tasteless, limp, wan pile of dispirited fluff they serve with everything. [6/9/08 UPDATE again: the Greek salad is a good bet - lettuce is crunchy & fluffy, piled high, nice feta]\n\n- The real test of a crepe is how it tastes when you have nothing but butter, sugar, and lemon juice on it.  (Of course, it's all about the batter, and the flour it's made with.) Theirs: Underwhelming. If you are going to name your place after a dish, at least get the most basic thing right.\n\n- Finally, not a food thing, but I thought worth mentioning - Styrofoam takeout containers. SF being SF, even the street vendors will probably soon be serving up food in waxed cardboard instead of styrofoam.  For a place trying to be moderately upscale (it is a creperie, after all), you'd think they'd be willing to make the switch. [These are no more as well, of course, and CoC uses the waxed paper that everybody had to switch to. Thank you, SF, for banning them!]\n\nAll that said, it is a casual and convivial place for people-watching, reading the Sunday paper, etc., and the atmosphere is neighborly.\n\n[I upgraded them from two to three stars based on the improvements I noticed today....and, you know, neighborly counts for a lot. - Jun 8 08]", "author": "Mary B."}

The eggs were a little runny, and the salmon wasn't evenly distributed throughout the mound. The potatoes were pretty good though. \n\nThe wife had the salsa crepe which actually looked decent. She commented that a savory crepe should probably have the crepe part be somewhat savory as well.. Not the sweet crepe for deserts. \n\nI think the biggest problem, which is why I'm only giving them 2 stars is that the service was horrible. The women behind the counter obviously don't want to work here and treat their customers like annoyances more than paying people who keep their paychecks coming in.  Not that people should be overly gracious at a cheap crepe joint, but there should be some sort of customer/employee respect here that they just lack. Makes me think that if we were in LA they were only here till they get their acing break.\n\nOn the upside, they have internet and don't seem to mind people using their laptops. \n\nAnother plus is that their espresso is all illy.. too bad their drip isn't.", "author": "Mark C."}

Today, I dealt with their poor customer service. I called for a take out order: 2 Chicken Caesar salads with dressing on the side. My father picked up the salads and the cashier said, \"dressing is in the bag.\" Because she said that, he did not second guess her. He gets home and the bags are missing dressing. I call back informing them of the mistake. I ask them to refund us or if they could deliver the dressing. She asked where we lived and would call her boss. She calls me back 15mins later and says she cannot deliver the dressing but we could come down to pick up the dressing. At this moment, our chicken on our salads are getting cold. However, they would not refund us for our time, gas, or effort going all the way back to their place. She did not even apologize for the inconvenience. She even said, \"I put the dressing in myself!\" Well that can't be true because where did it go? Are we magicians? She did not take any responsibility. Now, of course my father could have looked in the bag before he left the restaurant, but Crepes on Cole handled it incorrectly. Their customer service was poor. They just needed to handle it a bit better. They couldve thrown in a dessert or 10% off for us coming back the the restaurant but they gave us nothing. Instead, they just blamed it on us.

I eat here practically every Saturday because it's the starting and ending location for the kstars running club's Saturday morning runs through Golden Gate Park (www.kstars.org).  The french toast is the best thing on the menu.  Potatoes are absolutely horrible IMO, but they are good about allowing substitutions for toast (semifreddi's, yum!) or salad (decent assorted greens from a bag).", "author": "Galen C."}

They really need to improve on the terrible potatoes...  not at all tasty, and often overcooked.    The sandwiches are nothing special.   The dessert crepes are good, but how can you mess up on those?   I don't dig on the atmosphere, either.  It is anything but homey or inviting.    The times I've had the owner (or manager?) take my order he seemed totally disinterested...  his attitude reminded me of a station agent or a toll booth operator.   Though to be fair, the waitresses have always been reasonably friendly and attentive.", "author": "Victor S."}

In that time I've put up with the high margin on the food prices, and the inconsistent cooks (including one day when everyone that got there when the place opened had to wait for over an hour for any food because the cook was late), the severe mood swings of the staff and Sam, the raising of the prices even more, the wonderful cash-only policy that one finds in so many places in this area, and, of course, the bland, tepid, often ill-prepared food. A couple of days ago I paid almost 8.50 for french toast (two pieces of bread) and 2.25 for iced tea (bad-tasting water) that was obviously left over from the day before. No more.\n\nBy the way, the wifi people use in the restaurant isn't theirs. I don't know if anybody really knows where it comes from, but it isn't theirs- that is why it is better near the windows.", "author": "Arthur B."}
