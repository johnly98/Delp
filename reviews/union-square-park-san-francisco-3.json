Take a deep breath, and now look all around you, make a nice big 360, what you are seeing is Microcosm on a Macro scale.  You are in the Heart of San Francisco. Union Square is only 2.6 acres but this  this one-block plaza and surrounding areas are one of the largest collections of department stores, upscale boutiques, gift shops, art galleries, beauty salons and not to  mention Hotels, in the United States.  Union Square is like the love child of NY's Civic Center and Herald Square with Granny Broadway and Grandpa Nomad. This area has a very cosmopolitan but laid back vibe, and during the holiday season, everything everything is lit up, the Ice Skating rink comes in, and the Christmas Tree towers over guests buzzing around the plaza. You'll find anything and everything you need for your shopping desires, and within close proximity is Chinatown, with a great connection to the cable cars. This is a great place to come and spend a week or month or two.", "author": "Eddie S."}

We walked here after our lunch nearby, seriously can this few blocks get even more crowded and busier? There were people everywhere, so many tourists speaking all kinds of languages. I was glad they had a few deli stores around this Square, they even had decent selections of beer and wine, I could always use a glass of wine to keep a day going! \n\nParents and sister took photos of this park, a lot of people were just sitting around and relaxing, it was a bit hot for me at the moment. I remember they had a dance event last time I was here, I think they have different events all the time, so it's a fun place for local activities I suppose. \n\nA MUST see when you are in San Francisco Bay Area.

I walk by it all the time as it's close to work, but I never really go inside the square anymore.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-18", "description": "Union Square today is considered a high-end shopping district in the heart of San Francisco. Yet, if you delve deeper into \"the square\" you'll discover a rich history dating to 1850. The land was immediately set aside to be a community park & gathering spot by San Francisco's first mayor, John Geary. The official park's name came in honor of the pro-union army & navy rallies held in the square during the American Civil War - hence the \"Union\" in the square. The 85-foot tower in the center of the park was dedicated to Admiral Dewey, a popular guy with all millennials;). Yet, many overlook the 9-foot statue of the Goddess Nike at the pinnacle... the Greek Goddess of Victory! Look up! \n\nUnion Square Park is easy to find as it covers over 2-acres in the busiest part of the city. You have not been to San Francisco unless you stroll or sit in the square. Art shows are regularly shown on the weekends. And recently, the heart sculptures from the Hearts in San Francisco public art installation have been placed in each of the four corners of the square. Each year, the sculptures are auctioned off to benefit the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation and new sculptures painted by talented artists are installed in their place. It is said that Tony Bennet's song \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" inspired this wonderful event. Photo ops galore! \n\nToday, Union Square Park remains as the \"heart\" of San Francisco, serving as the spot of public concerts and events, art shows, impromptu protests, local events, the winter ice rink, and the annual (love) Christmas tree and Menorah lighting. Iconic landmarks include: Sir Francis Drake Hotel, The Macy's building, and the Grand Hyatt hotel. Other retail giants anchor around the mostly concrete park like Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Neiman Marcus, Saks 5th Ave, Williams Sonoma, and ironically a giant Nike store! \n\nLastly, I can't emphasize the importance of relaxing on a busy day. So if in downtown San Francisco and you're too busy shopping, too busy being busy, just head on over to Union Square Park... maybe you can't breathe-in nature like Golden Gate Park, however \"the square\" offers you a place to sit even for a few minutes and collect yourself. To hear the trolley's \"ring-a-ding\". To admire the Greek Goddess Nike. Hey, It's not a bad place to be. You just might be in the mood of singing... \"I left my heart in San Francisco...\" in Falsetto!", "author": "Eric R."}

Union Square Plaza Park is surrounded by the hustle and bustle of Downtown San Francisco, encircled by Hotels, High End Shopping, Cable Cars and lots of energy.  You feel like you're in the middle of a major city, because you are.  This place has come a long way from its roots - originally this was where pro-Union citizens came to rally during the Civil War.  \n\nI remember my first time standing in the middle of Union Square Plaza Park and being rather in awe of my setting.  This was my first trip to San Francisco.  In fact, my first time to California.  We landed a few hours earlier and were staying at a nearby hotel.  We were walking to drinks (Starlight Room) and dinner (Scala's) at the Sir Francis Drake - not a bad first few hours in SF, huh?  We walked through Union Square Plaza Park just before dusk on an April evening.  There were tourists and locals, and my thought was \"Gee, this is really nice.\"  You're looking at all these amazing building around you and the voices you hear are from across the world.  I didn't know it the very first moment, but within a few hours I started thinking \"Maybe I'll live in SF one day...\"\n\nLiving here now, I don't always have quite the same magical feeling, but this is still a beautiful place.  I enjoy passing through on the way to work in the morning when I'm working from the FiDi - it is sort of peaceful despite the downtown workday frenzy.  It's also beautiful at night when the surrounding buildings are lit up.  There can be art vendors at lunch and outdoor concerts in the evenings.  The best treat is during the holidays when the Tree is up and they have an Ice Staking Rink.  (You should absolutely do this when you are visiting SF)  Also, make sure to get a photo with one of the SF Heart Sculptures.\n\nThis is a great spot for visitors and locals alike.

Once you get past that though it's great.\n\nThe park itself is kinda on the ordinary side (Disclaimer: that statement reflects the views and opinions of Steve only and may not be universally shared. Your experiences may vary.) for San Francisco at any rate.It is smack dab in the high end shopping district if that's your thing. It is a main recruiting station for various San Francisco tour bus companies(you'll see what I mean. It's impossible to get in without them hitting you up.So to speak.)There is a magnificent victory memorial for the war of 1898 (the Spanish-American war.), a ton of places to sit and watch people,bicycle rentals, two sophisticated coffee/wine bars (they also serve food. Paninis, insalata and suchlike), a street art market on some days, some photogenic public art, decent views of the surrounding buildings, and well, that's it. I find it more magical in the winter when some of the open space is turned into a public ice skating rink. Awesome for people watching.  Also great for selfies. Pro tip-the shopping center across the street-the one with the starbucks and cheesecake factory-allows for spectacular open air views of the square, once you get to the top floor(the one that has the cheesecake factory restaurant). \n\nGreat for a quiet afternoon of watching people, or if you need a rendezvous spot. Also a perfect jumping off place for the bus tour thingys. But hey if you miss out on this spot, don't sweat it, there's tons of other stuff in San Francisco that are truly truly spectacular.", "author": "Steven W."}

Apparently the park underwent a recent renovation, thus ridding the area of many homeless people and dissuading the once present pickpockets as well. There are occasional spottings of street performers to take pleasure in; however, for being such a \"city center\" park (particularly with all of the ever present tourists about 7 days a week), the lack of street food (there is one pretzel stand) is quite perplexing.

Emporio Rulli Cafe sits right on Union Square and caters to your coffee and sandwich needs.  Outdoor seating is a must for a cafe like this, and Emporio Rulli does not disappoint with its ample seating in the sun, shade, or indoors.  I really like how there are oversized steps inside Union Square Park for lounging and people-watching, too.  \n\nAt nighttime, the lights from the street and neighboring shops cast warm shadows and pools of mysterious light on the park's stones.

(Lots of events happen here, and some like to put up huge tents in the middle, which hinders the usual for foot traffic across the park.)\n\nThere's something for everybody, which is why everyone from different walks of life congregates here. In the spring, you can admire cherry blossoms juxtaposed with the year-round palm trees. Between May and October, you can catch live performances, thanks to Union Square Live. In the winter, you'll likely see the gargantuan Macy's Christmas (fake) tree, the oversized menorah, and the ice skating rink.\n\nThe park is also friendly for tourist activities: at least two different hop on, hop off tour bus companies have stops here, and there's also a bike rental service on the west side of the park.\n\nIt also has a long history. You will can read more of these facts on the plaque located at the southwest corner of the park, but the following are my favorites:\n* Union Square was originally called O'Farrell's Mountain in 1847 because it was a sand dune. The sand dune was cleared around 1860, and the park was named after the public rallies held in support of the Union during the Civil War.\n* After the 1906 earthquake, temporary hotel rooms were built in the square while St. Francis Hotel was being reconstructed.\n* Timothy Pflueger (architect of the Castro Theater and the San Francisco Stock Exchange) designed the parking garage under the square, which was the first underground parking facility and doubled as an air raid shelter.\n\nThe verdict: As a local, I do have a love-hate relationship with Union Square, but I think I secretly love it more than I hate having to navigate the throngs of tourists in the area.", "author": "Tiff T."}

Identity theft a possibility here, keep your stuff close, deep in pockets or purses, cops were tackling people left and right, sirens at multiple locations and police with people in handcuffs on quite a few corners awaiting a \"pickup\" from any kind of police car that could squeeze through, the cops were on Motorcycles that were arresting people, only way in. 4 stars for the only factor of questionable activity. To be expected, but well governed and policed. Enjoy your time!", "author": "Phil H."}

There is also an ice skating rink and a ton of people gathered around to admire the spectacle.  If you want to grab a bite, I'd suggest checking out the Cheesecake Factory or the Burger Bar inside the Macys building.  The food at both these places are decent, but it's the view of Union Square that's worth the price.  Keep in mind though, the wait time for the Cheesecake Factory could run anywhere from half an hour to two hours!\n\nAlso, parking can be a pain in the butt, not to mention quite expensive too.  My suggestion is to take the Bart (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to the Powell station, which drops you off right inside the SF Westfield Shopping Center (just a few short blocks away from Union Square).  \n\nIf you're looking for a shopper's paradise, this is where you want to be.

But now it's a model urban space well worth hanging out just for the flow of the United Nations delegations streaming by.

Or I'd watch the lovers strolling by at dusk and try to be encouraging...\"Look who's gettin' lucky tonight!

Union Square also refers to the central shopping, hotel, and theater district that surrounds the plaza for several blocks. \n\nUnion Square was built and dedicated by San Francisco's first American mayor John Geary in 1850, and is so named for the pro-Union rallies that happened there before and during the Civil War. Since then, the plaza has undergone some changes including the 1903 dedication of a monument to Admiral George Dewey's victory at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish American War. It also commemorates President William McKinley, who had been recently assassinated. The figurine at the top of the monument, \"Victory\", was modeled from the likeness of a local heiress. Around 1940, a large underground parking garage was built under the square that relocated the plaza's lawns, shrubs and the Dewey monument to the garage \"roof.\" \n\nDuring the late 1970s, and into the 1990s, the area became a bit derelict, as the homeless began to camp in the space. San Francisco's rowdy New Year's parties used to happen yearly at the plaza with some sort of civil disruption happening. In early 1998, city planners began plans to renovate the plaza to create more paved surfaces for easier maintenance, with outdoor cafes, and more levels to the underground garage. In late 2000, the park was partially closed down to complete these renovations.  Then in July of 2002, the park was reopened. Then Mayor Willie Brown was quoted as saying - \"Use it; it is your square\" \n\nGayle and I particularly enjoy Union Square during the Holiday Season at night. We come here to look through the Macy's windows (especially the cats and dogs), admire the lights, and walk hand-in-hand through the Plaza. The only things missing are snow and a one horse open sleigh.", "author": "Eric B."}

Like the famous painted cows, the painted hearts -- created from uniform molds and painted by individual artists -- decorate the city in areas like Union Square, until they are auctioned off at a benefit for the charity.

There are more serene, picturesque and generally more pleasant places to be in San Francisco; there's more variety of cultural cuisines elsewhere, for much less money. Still, I end up here more often than not.\n\nSometimes it's because a friend has visited SF, as has happened several times in the last couple years, and they wind up getting a room in a Union Square hotel. Other times it's for the nightlife and all that entails - Ruby Skye, e.g., with it's occasional headliners of house, electronica, etc etc.\n\nLately I've driven there on almost auto-pilot mode, favoring the stout parking garage very near the Powell Street cable car origin. I've found several places that have very decent food and beer specials; Foley's Irish Pub on the southwest corner comes to mind (though fear for your appetite if it's a busy Friday evening, and more so for your ears as it's thunderously loud when full). Across from Infusion Lounge, to its west, is a little yakitori place that has a nice selection of sake and a very trendy, quiet atmosphere with huge windows from which you can people-watch during conversational lulls, assuming you're not alone.\n\nTo the East End of the Square: fancy pants stores galore, including my personal favorite, a GUESS flagship store (the basement being entirely devoted to Men's Wear! Yes I do get excited enough to use an exclamation point.). For some reason the streets on this side seem almost entirely devoid of homeless. There's a cool little street that's blocked off to all traffic except that on foot which has another favorite store of mine, the ridiculously over-priced Sur la Table gourmet cooking store (rumor is, I see, that this location is closed? Anyway.), as well as a cute cafe that spills itself onto the vehicle-less street.\n\nNorth by northeast from the Square you'll find yourself soon enough at the grand entrance to Chinatown, a place that I have yet to brave alone. Go two steps further west of Foley's and you'll be in the mix, as it were: the Tenderloin (q.v., on your own dime, if you don't know; there are some ultra cool spots to visit though so don't let the smell, sights and sounds scare you off too quickly . . . .).

It's a few blocks from the Apple store, Burberry, Prada, and Sephora.  It's right next to Macys, Victoria's Secret, Tiffany & Co. and Niketown.  It's also surrounded by art galleries, fabulous restaurants, and theaters.  There are steps to sit on, people to see, places to rest your soul.  Crowds congregate, gawk, and disperse.  People come and go.  It's easily accessible by public transportation.  It's literally a hubbub, day and night.  There are street performers throughout the day.  There are events that take place at the Square.  I've stayed nearby Union Square twice now and it's such a cool place to be at in San Francisco.

I walked by here the other day and there was a homeless lady shooting up in the doorway of one of the shops, facing the sidewalk/street, kitty corner to the park. This was at 7pm with hundreds of people walking by right by her and there she was with a hypodermic needle hanging out of her arm and half asleep. It was crazy and weird. There are no bathrooms for these people to use so they urinate (and defacate) right on the street or in the doorways to most of these businesses. The smell is absolutely horrible and gross. They will also constantly ask you for money. Some of them are aggressive and will get in your face. On a couple separate occasions, I gave a couple people a dollar and they all said ok, but do you have 4 more or can I have more. One big black homeless guy asked me if I had any money to give him and when I said no, sorry I don't, he walked right next to me for a while and had his face almost up against my ear and said, I really need some money man. That time I honestly thought I was going to get beat up and hurt by this homeless guy. Something needs to be done about these people.

I love the romance of the City from the view, cable cars, and the cafes.  Mocca on Maiden is a favorite stop.  There is so much history here.  Parking is an issue - busy, traffic, and pricey.  Most shops, eateries, and galleries are within close proximity so I walked.  If I wanted to go farther, I took the cable car.  This is a great place for people watching too.

No, I am sorry, I do not know everything about the city, and you shouldn't scoff at me if I reply \"I don't know\" to your enquiry about \"where is so-and-so and how do I get to so-and-so?\". \n\nAlso, not only can the tourists be rude, but the homeless around the square are particularly demanding. There's the guy with the cat who is sneaky with how he goes about with his peddling; he puts his cat in front of Macy's somewhere and then stands away from his cat, so he can get money from passerbys who don't know the guy's old tricks and gives the cat money. I used to feel some sort of pity for him, but after he cussed me out one day for not helping him change his coins into dollars, I didn't feel pity for him anymore. Plus, there's that other bum that goes right up to customers at the hot dog stands and begs so pitifully for someone to buy him food. One, this method is just too close to comfort for many people; they don't want someone to be so close and begging for food. Two, the guy isn't even thankful after someone does give in to buying him a hot dog. Hm, perhaps people need to wise up and not give the guy what he wants.\n\nOkay, but I digress. The \"love\" (maybe like?) that I feel for Union Square stems from just the convenience of the square to all of the shopping in the area. It's a good, free place to sit and people-watch (you can then watch the aforementioned groups in all their glory and just be an innocent bystander to the ruckus). On days when the weather is nice, the square is a great place to relax in and catch up with some friends. Also, the square never fails to attract free samples being doled out, and also celebrity sightings (David Beckham was in the square over the summer for his Giorgio Armani campaign for Macy's, and recently, K-pop/J-pop star BoA* was interviewed by Union Square). \n\nAlso, it's great that the ice skating rink is open this year, which brings a very festive atmosphere to the square for the holidays. Too bad I don't really skate though, so I can only enjoy watching the people skate around the rink.\n\nOverall, what can I say? Although Union Square evokes mixed feelings within me, it's a decent place in the end. Yes, if you're a tourist, please come here to see the sights and sounds of downtown San Francisco (but please, if you are going to ask questions, at least be courteous about it).", "author": "Helene K."}

It pulsates with people rhythmically winding in and out to get to opposite sides of the square to go shop hopping and/or purchase tickets to a show or a cable car ride. Yet, for some reason, this place is so much more enjoyable at night when nobody is around. Well, you see people sluggishly coming out of the Cheesecake factory from a hefty meal. You will also see young couples out on a romantic stroll. I highly recommend going to the St. Francis, taking the elevator and checking out the gorgeous view.

Nike Town, Levi, Macy's, Michael Mina, and these are just naming a few. \nWalking to work in the morning you pass all the professionals, kids going to school, and the occasional homeless person asking for money. \nIn the wintertime there is the Christmas Tree, the Ice Skating Rink, The big ass Menora haha... \nOn the weekends you have the art shows! Tons of great paintings by several talented artist. \nSometimes it can be a little over whelming on the weekends with all the lost tourist and their luggage, strollers, and big Maps of the city but that is also why I love it so much. I live in a city where people are excited to come visit. and I live in a neighborhood that people can't wait to come see!\nOk, back to last night! This review does not take away from Union Square but it happened there so here it is. 1:30am some friends and I were leaving Vessel heading to Ruby Skye and 8 Drunk ass guys come up to us (4 guys). They are drunk talking sh*t. The next thing i know a fight breaks out. It was really more of us trying to get away and avoid the fight and defend ourselves.  Nobody was really hurt, I left unscathed, but when it ended they \"thugs\" ran downstairs to the parking garage. We call the police (along with the security gueard). The police are there in 3 minutes flat... Thanks guys... \nThe police close off the exits, the first car to come out is yes THOSE FOOLS!  \nOk so long story short...
