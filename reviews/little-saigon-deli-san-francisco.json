We work in the Financial district of SF and they had just signed up for MealPass where they ordered a Pork Banh Mi for pickup.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've ordered at this establishment once.\n\nFOOD: I actually ordered a combo sandwich which contained both the pork and the fancy pork (not sure what made it fancy besides a difference in color) on the sandwich. A buddy of mine got me into Banh Mi sandwiches when I lived in Philadelphia so I've been a fan for a while now and this was a pretty good one. Not the best I've had in SF thus bar but also not the worst. Plus for lunch prices in the Financial district you can't beat a $7 sandwich.\n\nDRINK: I did not order any drinks while at the Little Saigon Deli. I believe I remember they had coffee and some fountain drinks on the menu. A co-worker of mine commented that the coffee is very good but I have not tried it.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This place is literally a hole in the wall. You could walk right by it and not even know it. That being said there isn't much atmosphere besides standing outside the window and placing your order. Make sure it's nice weather out (relatively easy in the Bay area).\n\nSTAFF: I did not speak to the staff besides placing my order but he got it right any was polite during the process. That's all I ask for in a fast food style joint.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nFor the Financial District I'd say this is a good spot worth stopping by if you've had a Banh Mi before. If you've never had one, look up the sandwich and the ingredients. Based off my experience this sandwich isn't for everyone but I enjoy them. Good lunch spot and I will return.", "author": "Christopher D."}

I mean, if they can't even get the proportions right in a regular cold cut banh mi like that (no cooking required!), how're they going to get any other sandwiches right?\n\nFirst off, it was the most expensive sandwich so far ringing in at $6.50. I can almost buy two sandwiches at any other place. For that alone I probably wouldn't come back. \n\nLength-wise the sandwich was on the smaller side, but it was thick and seemed like it would be generously filled with meat.

First time here so I get the super combo with viet iced coffee and the coconut waffle. \n\nSuper Combo: The bread was fresh and soft (saving them from the one star review). Skimpy on the carrots and complete absence of the other veggie staples in a banh mi. No Pate. Jalepeno's had no kick. Meat was well cooked but there were too many fatty chunks to fully enjoy it. \n\nCoconut Waffle: Basically an undercooked egg puff in the shape of a waffle. Where's the crisp? Just as important where's the coconut? \n\nViet iced coffee: Check out my list for my caffeine fixers and you'll see that I like strong coffee. Sweet is a plus but it HAS to be strong! They poured theirs out of a pitcher (definite no-no) and loaded it with that low grade truck stop ice that melts quickly therefore diluting the coffee. Plus serving it in a dixie cup? seriously? \n\nFinal thought: I really wanted to like this place even sneaking away from my usual Banh Mi spot of Les Croissants to try it out but I was let down on all counts.

The lean, thinly-sliced pork (oddly ringed with black pepper) wasn't really roasted, or if it was, it was a while ago, because it was kept warm in a rice cooker.  I suppose that's why the pork was still moist.  The pate wasn't pate, but some sort of mustardy sauce.\n\nThe bread was nice, since it was warm and a little hollowed out to allow for a favorble filling to crust ratio.\n\nIt was a pleasant sandwich, but there wasn't anything aside from the carrots, daikon, cilantro and chili pepper that made it a \"Vietnamese\" sandwich.

I was so happy to find that finally the financial district was going to have some good ole vietnamese sandwiches, and that i wouldnt have to travel to tenderloin to the other popular place on Larkin St. That place has been in business for over 20 years and there are still lines coming out the door everyday for lunch. \n\nBut lets get back to \"little saigon deli\". It Turns out i was very disapointed here. There's nothing in these sandwiches that really emphasize a good tasty sandwich. I've had the Chicken Sandwich, and was so disapointed. The meat was bland - except i think they overloaded on one of the spices, and did not taste right. The carrot/daikon slaw was lacking in its sweet and tartness that it should have. I would try out different sandwiches, but i dont think i would change my mind. \n\nThe vietnamese shrimp rolls here are a disapointment as well. It is full of noodles and bean sprouts as fillers. A huge discredit also goes to the fact that it wasnt prepared correctly - everything falls apart when you pick it up. \n\nthere seems to be lack of technique and lack of understanding the flavors of the food they prepare here. My take is they see a market that is unfulfilled and decides crank out the food with no concern, but only to reap in the benefits.

The catalyst for this is that I got to talking to Jessie the owner of this deli when I was in SF a month ago.  On my second visit in three days, Jessie asked me if I liked his sandwiches.  I replied that if I didn't I wouldn't have come back.\n\nYou see, Jessie needed a sanity check.  He mentioned that some people on Yelp were trashing his sandwiches.  I was surprised by that statement and told him so.  I asked if the reviewers were Vietnamese because they obviously don't know what they're talking about.  I told him I was born in Saigon, grew up in LA and Banh mi as well as Vietnamese food in general is one of my passions.  I told him his pork was spot on.  Jessie said that he modeled the recipe on a deli he visits in Saigon.\n\nI dunno what other people have been eating, but all the sandwiches I've ordered here have been outstanding.  I've ordered the three pork (dunno what the menu name for it is), the ja one only and the chicken.  All were exceptional.  As a side note, my friend is a vegetarian from Georgia (the Baltic Sea country, not the state) and she thought the vegetarian sandwich was also very good.\n\nThere is enough pate, enough jus, good daikon, carrots, cilantro, jalepenos...everything just comes together very nicely and tastily on a very fresh baguette.  My only disappointment was not being able to try the deli's ngoi guon as the woman who specializes in making them was out and Jessie wouldn't allow me to roll my own.\n\nI know there will be people here that will disagree with me, but if you can find a better Vietnamese sandwich in the Bay Area, please message me as I'd like to try it out.  In fact, if you've got recommendations for Banh mi shops in LA/Chinatown, the San Gabriel valley and ESPECIALLY (pretty puhlease!) Manhattan, let me know.", "author": "Thomas V."}

Although there are many food places on that block of the street, only Little Saigon Deli is a practical choice since all the other eateries there cost as much as it would be to feed an entire village from a developing country or a limited edition gold collector's plate of the original transformers cartoon (I know what I'm going to choose). \n\nI'm all about diversity and I'm a strong believer that variety is the spice of life. I especially like it when that variety is smashed together to create an abomination to everything that is good and holy. That's why I ordered the Super Combo sandwich. Like many other hybrids that probably came about from indecisiveness (pie topped with ice-cream, turducken, platypuses, etc) the super combo sandwich is basically taking pieces from all the other choices of sandwiches and cramming it into an indecisive person's fantasy (sexual fantasy). \n\nI was a little concerned when the person who took my order didn't speak with an accent. Just as you would call into question the authenticity of a Scottish Terrier who spoke with a German accent, I questioned the authenticity of the Vietnamese Sandwich into question. However, they were able to pull it off well. The pickled vegetables, the meat, the unreasonably spicy peppers were all there. The bread was hard, but then every Viet Sandwich I have ever eaten have had hard bread, so like the emperor's new clothes I'm going to say that all authentic Viet Sandwiches have hard bread and if you disagree you're an fool, a fumbling buffoon. What was disappointing is that lack of symmetry throughout the sandwich. For example in my sandwich the peppers were only located in the middle and the beef was in a separate part of the sandwich from the pork. It was like racial segregation at its worst causing much civil unrest in my taste buds. Eventually after much upheaval all ingredients mixed and were together harmoniously in my tummy. But I shouldn't have had to put that much effort and metaphors for an equal distribution of ingredients in my sandwich. \n\nOn the other hand the price was only $4.50 which is great for the financial district, plus since it was to-go and the sandwich is served cold not only did I not have to pay the 1% increase in sales tax, I didn't have to pay for sales tax at all. Take that Board of Equalization!!! I'm going to take my $0.42 savings and invest it into stocks, and then they're going to go up, and I'm going to be like \"SELL SELL SELL\" and I'm going to be a trillionaire and I'll have all the gold transformers collector's plates I want and I'll be able to eat all the roasted platypuses I want because I can't decide between duck or beaver.", "author": "Youchen W."}

It's a lot like pho but without the noodles if you add chili. \n\nMaybe it was an off day and they were all out of curry and tried to pass off hot soup as spicy curry. But at least now I know where to go the next time I have a cold.", "author": "Ls Y."}

Sometimes the bread is good and nicely toasted. other times stale. The only thing i look forward to at the end is the green coconut waffle, which you must request for a fresh one or they might give a already made one that's cold and sitting for a while. for a fidi lunch, it's cheap. but i think i'll stick with little paris", "author": "Patrick M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-15", "description": "Just picked up a pork bahn mi and green waffle for lunch and I must say Little Saigon did not disappoint. There was harmony and balance between the perfectly toasted bread, pork (fancy pork is \"processed\" by the way, which doesn't translate to fancy for me), carrots, radishes, the greens and the light dressing. Now I'm usually not a sandwich gal, but I devoured this in mere minutes. Then there's the green waffle which is a cross between savory and sweet. I would prefer tasting more of the \"green\" coz I don't have a sweet tooth, either. However it was still yummy. No standout, but  yummy. I would highly recommend this cute hole in the wall for a good bargain lunch. You can't beat $4 for a satisfying lunch!", "author": "C P."}

I would recommend calling ahead to get your sandwich made.  There's just one guy making the food and the line can start building up pretty quickly.", "author": "Steve L."}

Good enough on its own to make syrup jealous.\n\nUnfortunately, the pork sandwich was lackluster.  I didn't expect much for a $4 sando and it mostly met my expectations... except the pork was more than 50% fat.  I don't mind a little flavor in my meat, but this was glorified strips of pork fat.\n\nThe rest of the sando was okay, pickled carrots and jalapenos.  The bread was good, soft with a crunchy crust.  I'll try it again with a different meat, but now I'm leery.  The waffle salvaged the rating.", "author": "Chris S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-15", "description": "Unfortunately my first experience with this place was the fancy pork. It was some processed sliced pork log....not at all what I expected.  I thought it would somehow be a step up from the regular pork. Definately not the case...I did not like it at all. I will give it one more try with a non-fancy meat.\n\nThey should really re-label that sandwhich.", "author": "angela p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-09", "description": "I had the combination - which had both pork and chicken.  A little small for my taste - and not too many veggies.    The best thing it had going for it though was the flavor.  The bread was also just okay - small and it seemed more chewy which is a bit of a different experience.   I also had the waffle - while the flavor was good, it was a bit soft.  So if you ever order this, ask for a fresh waffle and perhaps tell him to leave it a bit longer on the waffle iron.", "author": "Gina C."}
