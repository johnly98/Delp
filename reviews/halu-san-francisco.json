It was totally a surprise to me and I'm glad to have found it as it is one of the best meals i've had in SF in a while. It is a tiny hole in the wall place, typically with a line and cramped seating but I could care less as the food is amazing. The service here is fast and effeicent like a lot of japanese places and they use yelp for the wait list so you can put yourself down before you get there to minimize the wait.\nThe food here is yakitori, ramen, and Japanese apps/snacks. Haven't tried the ramen but the yakitori and apps/snacks are legit. My favorite yakitori is the chicken wing which is butterflied and seasoned perfectly. The beef belly and the yuzu chicken are also favorites. Tired some of the more adventurous bits like skin, heart, tendon, cartilage and to be honest they weren't that bad, a little bit chewier but good. I definitely recommend you explore the yakitori menu as you may be surprised like I was how a lot of things taste better then what you'd expect. The apps here are good as well, tried the gyoza, takoyaki, and oknomiyaki and all were good. Not amazing but good. Keep in mind this is a yakitori place so they are really good at that stuff and the other things on the menu are ok.

The first with a friend and the latter with my cousins. It was Saint Patty's and honestly, we weren't going out for the holiday festivities (we actually forgot), but the Richmond was nice because.. even near the bars and the food places: it was 'dead': nothing packed, just the usual numbers. (If you want crazy: try the Castro and other areas.. or go to DTSJ like San Pedro Square). It was really nice not dealing with crazy people. We did walk to a local bar while we waited for our spot here (they said about 30 minutes and they called us). \n\nIt's a very small establishment with Beatle's memorabilia all over the place and Beatle's music playing in the background. I really like this place. My cousin and his girlfriend LOVE this place, but my other cousin has never gone. And it is sadly closed on Sundays (we were trying to go last Sunday after trying out couches at Living Spaces). So we did a raincheck and went last night.  \n\n-\n\nAnyways to the food..\n\n2nd experience:\n\nI ordered the beef tongue (comes in a set of two skewers). It was really good. And I appreciated that it was prepared differently than the beef tongue that I would also receive in my dinner set mentioned below. My dinner set was randomized so I didn't know I would be getting the 'same' thing, but it wasn't remotely the same. So thumbs up. \n\n------\n\nI also got the Yakitori Omakase Dinner which is one of their specials: \n7 assorted yakitori skewers (chef's choice so it varies on any given day)\n\nMy assortments came with a delicious beef tongue, \nplum soaked beef with herbs (that was my favorite), \norka (everyone loved this, but I thought it was okay),\npork (my cousin Kyle's favorite, but I'm not huge on charcoaled meats),\nmushrooms (super delicious), \nchicken meatball, and \nsalmon (my cousin Syd's favorite and it was good but it's not my go-to).\n\n*beef tounge isn't as chewy as the leunga of a burritto so if you were wondering on texture, I can't do super chewy meats, I think if you've never had tounge: it's a good starting dish to get here. It's really good.\n\nThe dinner comes is served with rice, miso soup and organic spring green mix salad.  The miso is really good here, they make it different than any place I've ever been too. They have enokitake mushrooms in their miso and it's not a super salty broth or anything, it's just dead-on good. \n\n**veggie choice available for the assortments \n\n--------\n\nWe also got Okonomiyaki (japanese style pizza pancake topped with traditional tonkatsu sauce, mayo, aonori and red ginger), it's vegetarian, very similar to a Korean seafood/non-seafood pancake. I liked it, but if you don't like Korean savory pancakes in general you won't like this, it's the same texture.\n\n------\n\nMy cousins got the Combination (I don't believe this is on the menu, but written on one of the boards on the wall) & Karaage Ramen. The ramens were good. This isn't really the right place to get Ramen, but it's good with the food we had.. we did order a lot.. so you might want to tone it down a notch. \n\n-----\n\nOne cousin got a sake flight (where they choose for you, but there's a lot of other options where it's not a surprise) and they enjoyed it. \n\nI just choose not drink so I can't comment on anything. \n\n----\n\nOne cousin got 2 Spicy Mentai Caviar Mayo Chicken, so all four of us got a skewer and it was really good. \n\n-----\n\nFirst experience:\n\nGot the takoyaki, crispy chicken wings (super small, my friend was disappointed.. I think it was typical sizing), I got the Crispy Chewy Soft Skin (comes in two) and that's my absolute favorite.", "author": "Lilian L."}

All yakitori were grilled perfectly, and since we ordered off the beaten path, ours were all freshly grilled. I'd say the salmon, ginko, meat balls and okra were my favorite. The Japanese couple sitting next to me were enjoying ramen instead, and were very happy that this place does a more toned-down ramen, Japanese style versus the overhyped and Americanized ramen places mushrooming all over the city-- big hint that I will take.

I literally had to yank all of it forcefully with my teeth off the skewers.

We also had fried chicken thighs, and those were fabulous. \n\nMy advice: bring your hot date here for some warm ramen on a typical, cold SF night.

This review is an exception as they had good food but everything else about the experience was abysmal and we didn't even get a single apology from them.\n\nThe crux of the matter is that we ordered 4 skewers and only one was delivered after about 20 minutes, and they totally forgot about rest of the meal.  30 minutes go by without any activity until we were asked if we were ready for the check.  When we said we hadn't gotten the bulk of our meal, they said the problem was that they needed to prep the food (i.e. put meat on skewers) and they obviously didn't want to so do so - so they just ignored the rest of the order.  \n\nWe were given the option of either waiting another 20 minutes for the food to order (i.e. they would start making it)  or we would be served different items that could be prepared more quickly.  We were starving and asked for the quicker option -- so we were served random food we didn't order and it took well over an hour twenty minutes to get served.  All the replacement options they brought were also more expensive than the items we originally ordered.\n\nAt this point, I would have expected a simple apology - but none was offered.  It was stated matter of factly that they just didn't bother making our food. \n\nThe service was so bad that I left a $0.95 tip on a $40 order - and after walking out I felt like I had over-tipped.

(This is a big one) Halu does not take reservations, we arrived at 7 and were told there would be a 20 mins wait. But after 35 mins we still haven't got our table, so we went in and were told we would be the next party, then it took another 15 mins until we were finally seated... Granted we were asked to leave a phone number so they could call us when table's ready, but the extended waiting time was just too long compared with what we were quoted\n\n* * * FOOD * * *\nSpinach Salad: A-.\nA tiny appetizer recommended by our server, the spinach was fresh but it was the sauce that made the difference. It was peanut + miso kind of taste, good start of our meal.\n\nTontoro Skewer: A.\nCrunchy and tender, one of the best grilled pork belly I have ever had. Each piece of pork belly had an equal fat/meat ratio, the grilling time was just about right that the meat was still very juicy when it was served.\n\nChicken Skewer: A-.\nNothing surprising here but good quality of chicken meat and the addition of avocado was a nice match to the oily/greasy meat.\n\nGyutoro Skewer: A.\nThe beef belly was not as crunchy as pork belly, but definitely a lot more tender and juicy. Again the grilling time here was controlled very well. Some kind of sauce was put on the meat before it was served which made this dish even more delicious.\n\nChicken Katsu Skewer: A-.\nQuite an interesting skewer. Grilling a fried stuff seems to be an extra step and I couldn't really taste the grilling part of it anyway. There was some onion inside the chicken katsu too.\n\nGrilled Eggplant: B.\nQuite disappointed. Very bland even with the addition of ginger. Should have come with soy sauce instead.\n\nOkonomiyaki: A-.\nNice texture and very tasty, flavorful sauce. Not too thick. I was hoping there could be more green onion to enhance the taste even more though. Definitely a must-order dish.\n\nChicken Stuffed Mushroom: A-.\nAnother recommendation from our server. There was just a tiny bit of chicken meat in each piece of mushroom, but the combination of both was rather interesting.\n\nGeso Age: A-.\nThe squid legs were deep fried in just about the right amount of time, not too crunchy while the squid was still very tender. The sauce was once again very flavorful.\n\nSatisfied with almost all the dishes ordered!

It's a pre-gentificatin-type OG that brings izakaya fare back to basics in a cozy unpretentious hole-in-the-wall. \n\nIzakayas in SF are all too often posh and shiny, striving to emulate authenticity with dramatic head-to-toe wood everything that almost looks more like a temple than a restaurant. In contrast, Halu's vintage diner ambiance and whimsical decor of Beatles paraphernalia makes me feel as if I had walked straight into a local joint tucked into alleyways in Japan. (Ironic that the quintessentially American aspects of the diner are what make Halu so authentically Japanese)\n\nThe menu features ramen, yakitori, and okonomiyaki--staples including choices with a spin, such as kara age ramen, sirloin yakitori, and a more-green-than-usual okonomiyaki. There are several good alchy selections as well, such as potato sake (reminiscent of vodka, as expected).\n\n(++) Kara-age ramen ($12): Personally I always find this to be an oxymoron since the kara-age would be good with anything besides sitting in a noodle soup and getting soggy. Although I still think the kara-age would be best on the side, I do commend the ramen here! The noodles are thin and bouncy, and unlike noodles typically found at ramen places (I suspect it's housemade or from Japan!) The broth is solid, a perfect balance of a nice robust flavor without being too thick and heavy.\n\n(+) Hiyashi chaku ($14): Not terrible, but I would pass. First of all, the plate is oval which looks pretty but makes it very difficult to mix all the ingredients together. Secondly, the chashu portions are a bit skimpy because the slices are very very thin. Overall it didn't stand out too much.\n\n(+++) Okonomiyaki ($17): My favorite dish here, and probably the best okonomiyaki I've had in SF so far! Usually I find it too saucy and carby, but Halu's version has a mild sauce drizzle, a slightly less starchy composition, and topped with a layer of nori flakes. Intriguing and tasty P:\n\nSince the place is small, the wait on a Friday night around 7pm is approximately 30 minutes, but they call when your table is ready, and there are various Asian grocery stores to browse around.\n\nIt came out to ~$24 per person: a little pricey but fairly standard in SF terms, and worth it for a  memorable food adventure in a fun setting.\n\nAnd yes, the food/decor do make good Instagrams, for those of you who take that into account :P", "author": "Edna C."}

I started with the chicken liver skewers. They were good, but a bit pricey ($5.75) for only two skewers. I also expected the liver to have a bit more of a richer flavor. Next, I got the Karaage Ramen. I didn't really understand the idea behind putting fried chicken in soup. As one would expect, the fried chicken was not that crispy after being soaked by the broth :/  The broth was flavorful, but lacking spice for my taste. Luckily, they had some red chili flakes for me to spice up my ramen. $12.50 was a bit more than I would like to pay for ramen, but it was a large bowl and the broth was flavorful. If you want a soft-boiled egg, it's extra. I forgot to ask for one and they never asked me if I wanted one. \n\nHalu has lots of character and is super cozy, but a little pricey.

I thought iit was because this place is popping (according to the Yelp reviews) but through my visit here, I learned it's also because the service here is suuupppeer slow. \n\nI came here on a weekday night, around 5:30pm (only about 30 mins after opening) and was seated immediately. Plus the restaurant was relatively empty, so I was happy that I finally get to try this place with little to no wait (yess!) My happiness was soon diminished as it took almost an hour for me to get my food. I honestly thought at one point that they were just trying to get me super hungry so that everything would taste good. The service here was also not that great. Took me forever to flag the waitress down to get the check, took a while to even get the check, and reached the point where we rather just pay in cash just so we don't have to wait to get our card back before leaving. \n\nHowever, I have to admit...this place is one of the better ramen joints in San Francisco. The ramen here tasted good. I got the karaage ramen and even though my karaage was semi soggy in the broth (make sure you request to have them separated!) it was nicely seasoned and fried. The egg was neither hard boiled or half boiled, probably just an overdone half boiled egg. The broth was flavorful and made the entire bowl pretty good in general. My bowl of ramen wasn't perfect but then again it's hard to find okay ramen in San Francisco.\n\n\nTLDR; Probably one of the better ramen joints in San Francisco but for the wait you get here, I rather drive down to San Mateo.", "author": "Jenny N."}

It is a very small and dimly lit restaurant and feels like youre at an old fashioned bar and hole-in-the-wall style atmosphere. There are a row of bar stools in the front and small tables in the back. I chose to sit at the small table in the back with the lamp under it. The server (super friendly and nice!) told us it was the most popular table since it was brightest. There are a bunch of beatles posters everywhere and beatles music playing in the background which gives it a cozy old vibe.\n\nFor two people, we ordered and shared a five skewer saikyo chicken set, two beef steak skewers, a karaage ramen, and an okonomiyaki. More than enough food, and took home a fourth of the okonomiyaki. The saikyo set was a bit too exotic for our liking. The gizzard was interesting. Two of them were quite bony, and we did not like the chicken liver. The belly steak was yummy as well as the avocado and guacamole beef skewer. Both were a little too chewy..\nI enjoyed the karaage ramen. It came with four big pieces of karaage, corn, red ginger, and onions. The okonomiyaki ($17) is the item to get here. It tasted authentic and reminded me of Japan. \n\nThere are many unique items to try. Food is tasty and a bit on the pricier side but I would come back.

The service is GREAT. Extremely polite, outgoing and always check on you from time to time. \n\nDuring my visit, I ordered Karaage Ramen (comes with 3 pieces) with extra chasu slices (2 pieces). The broth was very good, and the noodles were soft. While it does not have a lot of toppings like other ramen shops, the meat was plentiful and I still had a good fill after all was said and done. \n\nThe shop is indeed small, so hard to move around with traffic. We had to sit at the bar right next to the entrance of the shop but it was not a problem since my party was not in anyone's way.\n\nAs for waiting time: Luckily, we arrived at 6:30pm and were the first names on the list they had. They give wait-listed people a phone call to let them know their seats a ready, so you can go walk around if you don't want to stand on the sidewalk waiting. \n\nPrices are fair for the food served.

I had passed by it countless times while parking the car after dropping my mom off for grocery shopping, and finally entered it about a week ago with my friend. The shop is a little hole-in-the-wall Japanese restaurant that offers rock music and Beatles decor coupled with yakitori (traditional and fusion) and ramen. \n\nI entered around 5:15 PM and thankfully there was no wait. The shop began filling up afterwards however. As a note - they offer happy hour (take advantage of it!) but you will have to ask for the menu (seems like it's a secret of some sort). The prices are rather solid - $5 chicken karaage, a few skewer options, and several drink options as well.\n\nMy friend and I split a few orders:\nChicken karaage: I am a huge karaage fan, and this one definitely did not disappoint. For $5, you get a reasonable number of pieces and the chicken is tender, well-seasoned, and crispy! Definitely worth a try.\nChicken Stuffed mushrooms: these mushrooms are stuffed with bits of chicken, coated in batter, and deep fried then skewered to be served. Pretty interesting combo, worth getting if you are big on mushrooms.\nChicken skewer with avocado cilantro: The chicken on these skewers is really tender as well. The guac/avocado was underwhelming, having little avocado taste. This is worth getting for the chicken, but don't expect much from the guac.\nChashu ramen: Pretty typical ramen - not the best I've had but definitely still decent. It comes with a few slices of chashu pork and enough to split (they are happy to provide bowls to split) if you are also eating the yakitori.\n\nOverall, the meal was pretty enjoyable. The service is good, the food is decent, and the ambiance is very unique.

I can see how some people absolutely love this place because of the atmosphere, however the food quality and preparation does not meet my standard.\n\nWe went to this place with high expectations of ramen after reading previous reviews.  Walked by it twice and couldn't find it, it is quite literally a hole-in-the-wall.  The music was great.  The server was very intense, in a traditional Japanese manner.  We were seated immediately and then she took our order right away.  \nThe ramen was decent, but the meat tasted over-boiled.  I got the lava-spicy while my friends got regular spicy.  They were disappointed and needed more chili to spicen it up.  Also, the egg is our favorite part and everyone's egg was hard-boiled instead of soft-boiled, .  \nThe restroom is very small and I hit my head and stumbled around trying to get in it, same on the way out.

The yakitori was delicious, we chose bacon wrapped scallops (how can you go wrong) and chicken with scallions (yum). We ordered the gyoza which came out on a sizzling platter, these were not frozen from a bag gyoza! They were delicious. I also wanted to try some of their katsu. We got the chicken thighs and the stuffed mushrooms, both were very yummy, but the mushrooms were very new to me, so they were a pleasant surprise.

That was before my awakening. \n\nTwo years ago when I rediscovered the Mission, I went on a search for the hippest places and stumbled onto an article: 48 Hours in the Mission by New York Times. I had, of course, neglected to read the publication date, which, of course, ironically, was 5 years in the past. No wonder Weird Fish, Savannah Jazz and 500 Club had no wait time. I felt like a fool afterwards, though, ever since then, I've caught on. The Chapel, Mission Control (aka underground club), Viracocha, and obscure Argentinean beer and empanada places were among my discoveries.   I showed up at Lolinda when it just opened and was hip and I ordered Icelandic beer at Mission Chinese aka Lung Shan before it opened up its east village outpost in New York. \n\nYou ask, wtf and why is it at all relevant to Halu? Well, it's very. very. relevant. For one, I needed to know that I have since risen from the ashes and I have since stayed ahead of the trend. Incoming Halu and GQ Nov 2013 issue. Halu was mentioned by a jet setter who frequented SF and recommended Halu. But that's not it.  I knew of Japanese bar food from my old stumbling ground in Toronto. I in fact had failed to get into a couple of those joints due to overcrowd. Incidentally, if you have not been to Toronto, you are not a real foodie. It has the best food scene in the East Coast. Ab Fab. But I digress. So we went for Chicken Skin, Chicken gizzard, Beef Tongue, Octopus, Fried Mochi, Steak, Pork, Yuzi Chicken, ramen, Peppers, chicken katsu, beer and sake. \n\nRuben and Andrew were not so keen on trying gizzard or skin of the chicken. Though they seemed to be Ok with it. White boys, what can you say?  Scallop fried was delicious. In fact fried mochi took the crown for how good it was. Shannon and I were a bit more adventurous, we liked the skin, the gizzard, liked the tongue. \n\nOdd combo if you ask me, but it works. Sake was delicious, I had two bottles which perhaps was not a great idea considering I'm Asian and a lightweight, But I loved every drop of it. \n\nSeeing that the Mission was now overcrowded with hipsters who don't have great taste but pretend to have (see my review of Haven), I had been long waiting for something authentic, innovative and surprising, not to mention, a lesser hipsters infested neighborhood. I had suspected Richmond had it all. It did. As they say, the proof is in the pudding, or in this case, the proof is in the gizzard. \n\nGQ November 2013 was way better than New York Times 48 Hours in the Mission circa 2008. I have redeemed myself, at last. \n\nNote to those who are looking for a date restaurant, especially if you are a Caucasian man and you finally landed an Asian date.  Yoko Ono on the wall along with Beatles and endless British pub beer. You ought to be proud of yourself, for bringing hard-to-find Asian date to this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-16", "description": "Halu is cool because they decorate the small little restaurant with an abundance of Beatles collectibles. They also play oldie music in the background, so i guess it really takes you back to the 60's/70's if you grew up jamming to those tunes. If you sit in the bar area, you'll see a row of Japanese Premium Beer lined up on the counter. Each of those beer can run you up from $8-$12, so be careful where you point to!\n\nA couple of skewers are always fun, especially if you order things like the bacon-wrapped mochi or exotic things like those chicken/beef internal organ stuff (hope im not grossing anyone out!). I think most of the skewers just taste like oily crispy stuff, but they're fun to try. I think the $4 and up price tag would be more justified if I am able to distinguish the skewers by taste.\n\nI come to Halu for their ramen though, so that's the most important part of the review. The Lava Ramen looks Red Hot Chili Peppers, but it's actually not too spicy. I don't like that their egg is not soft-boiled (the yolkiness is soooo important) and they put a lot of bean sprouts in the broth that it gets into my way of slurpping the ramen. So overall, i don't think it's the best bowl of ramen ever, but it's still decent.\n\nI think this is a cool place to just enjoy the vibe with some beer/sake and snacks/skewers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-02", "description": "Located on 8th Avenue rather than Clement or Geary Streets, Halu is a tiny, but cozy, Japanese restaurant tucked away in the Inner Richmond district. They offer a great selection of yakitori, ramen, donburi, and drinks. I've been here a couple times so far and haven't tried much, but I recommend the yakitori.\n\nSalmon onigiri --\nI was expecting a rice ball with a thick (or at least noticeable) layer of salmon in the middle. However, Halu's salmon onigiri only had small salmon bits dispersed throughout the ball. And it didn't hold together nicely either -- the rice ball quickly fell apart as soon as I took the first bite.\n\nYakitori --\nThere's a large selection of yakitori here -- beef, pork, chicken, seafood, and vegetable -- so you're bound to find a couple of options that are worth trying. I've had a small handful from the yakitori dinner special. The chicken meatball was flavorful and marinated nicely. Stuffed mushrooms were filled with ground chicken that was juicy, and the mushrooms were very meaty. Chicken wings were moist and fell off the bone so easily. Flat steak was a bit chewy, but good, and it was cooked medium, which is surprising because the meat was so thin to begin with. Okra was simple, but still tasted great and had a nice, non-rubbery texture. Bacon wrapped scallop was delicious (but bacon wrapped anything is delicious).\n\nKaraage ramen --\nThis ramen had five pieces of deep fried white meat chicken that were very juicy and tender. The batter got soggy quickly, which is a no-brainer because the karaage sits in a bowl of soup. The broth was decent, not too salty, but very oily. The ramen noodles had a firm, chewy texture. A majority of the bowl consisted of the noodles too. Although they're very generous with the noodles, the overall proportions were off -- there was just too much noodles in the end.\n\nButter corn ramen --\nThis ramen comes with two slices of butter, which helped make the broth thicker and creamier, yet not too heavy. The spicy version definitely has a lot of heat! I had to drink a lot of water to subside the spiciness. This ramen came with two types of pork. The chasu was nice and tender, but not too fatty. The other pork was fork-tender, but it seemed a little cold, like it came out of the fridge and placed into the bowl shortly before serving.\n\nAs indicated on their menu, ALL ramen broths are meat-based, so Halu isn't a vegetarian friendly place for ramen. The service is very friendly, but wait time for food varies based on how busy the place is. First time we came here, the restaurant was packed and it took 30 minutes for food to arrive at the table. Second time we came here, it wasn't as busy and our food took less than 10 minutes. Halu probably holds no more than thirty customers, and they're nice enough to call you, letting you know your table is ready, if you don't want to stand outside waiting.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

They are little piece of meat on stick for 10 bucks. I can put meat on stick too, but god damn it, it's not Yakitori. It's Yakitori-product.\n\nEvery time we come here, conversation stops to a minimal when the food comes. Because you cannot savor every bite unless you stop talking and concentrate. Every time we come, we ask ourselves why we don't come more often. \n\nIt's probably good we don't, because one of the best things you'll ever eat, is the Beef Belly. oForget other cuts, beef belly is it. \n\nThey also really know how to do their chicken parts. Get the Exotic chicken sampler for a sampling of heart, liver (amazingly done so that it just melts in your mouth), gizzards, soft bones, and chicken skin. My favorite? The liver and the soft bones. But also I like the heart. And the gizzard. I guess rather, I should say I like everything but the skin... it's just a little much for me.

The broth is so incredibly porky, but it's not overly fatty / oily like many tonkatsumen.\n\nI don't have to describe the greatness of the beatles decor and hole-in-wall''d ness and the general Japanese authentic-ness of this place, as others have mentioned very much.\n\nHalu is a dying kind.

Both were cooked perfectly. I think it's easy to over cook the gizzards bc I've had it at other places and they were too tough and inedible. Halu does yakitori well! We also had the wasabi octopus (raw). It far exceeded my expectations. It was amazing! Tons of wasabi flavor and so so delicious. Yes, the appearance and texture is slimy but once you get over that, it's so good! \n\nWe came for the ramen so of course, we had to get that too. I had the pork ramen while bf had the beef with corn and butter ramen. Yes, it comes with 2 slabs of butter. Looked good but I was too afraid to try too much of that broth for the sake of my cholesterol shooting through the roof. First, the bowls are huge! The ramen was probably one of the best I've ever had. The perfect texture - chewy goodness. Second, the broth was flavorful and not filled with tons of MSG. There was a huge slab of pork in my bowl...score! I was so stuffed after finishing my bowl of ramen. Yes, I finished it...and almost regretted it 10 minutes afterwards. It's ok, I made it a point to work out extra hard the next day. \n\nI'd be giving 5 stars, but it took really long for us to get our ramen (30 minutes). Other than that, all was great. Bathroom was also tiny but very clean and had a lot of little posters and fun hello kitty knick knacks in there. The service was good too...the waitresses were super friendly and courteous.\n\nWe only heard 1 Beatles song during the whole hour and half we were there. I think more Beatles music would be more appropriate. Thank you for playing Led Zeppelin - Staircase to Heaven! Bf almost wanted to get up and jam the air guitar to the solo!", "author": "Liv A."}

That's just plain rude for that group, considering the place is not that big and there are still people coming in to eat! The hostess/waitresses needed to be a bit more assertive to get these people up and moving. \n\nAnyhoo, by the time we sat to eat it was already 9:30pm (which in East coast terms is 12:30am).

This was one of my worse experiences.\n\nEven though there was no wait, the food took forever. It's like once they seat us, they forget about us until they see us just sitting there twirling our wooden chopsticks out of boredom, waiting to have our order taken. I ordered the pork ramen while my friend ordered the vegetarian one. We also asked for gyoza and agedashi tofu as soon as we sat down so it would come out first since we were so hungry. \n\nThe ramen took 20 minutes to come out. They came out before the appetizers did. I was a little annoyed but then again I realized it was ramen and most of the ingredients were already cooked. But once we were done eating, we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for our appetizers! Really?! We had to ask the waitress twice to make sure they didn't forget about us. Turns out, they gave our appetizers to a table that came after we did. Our waitress wasn't even apologetic! She simply asked if we wanted to cancel and my friend really wanted the gyoza and tofu so we just waited. I was beyond irritated at this point. What horrible customer service that night.

I joined him and thought Halu was nice but nothing special. I would visit weekly because it was what my friends did. But I was here for my friends, not for Halu. However, as time passed and I continued my weekly Halu sessions, Halu grew on me.

The karaage ramen that I once deemed average began tasting amazing as I sampled different variations and really took the time to enjoy it. \n\nAs time grew, I pursued Halu more heavily and took time to understand it. I would get its sake flights to taste all of what it had to offer and try different pieces of its succulent yakitori. Halu helped me understand myself too- I now know that I will absolutely devour any yakitori that has even an inkling of chicken in it. \n\nI knew me and Halu had something special going on when it closed its doors for several months, but for what seemed like an eternity.

The main reason my friends and I came to Halu one night was because we were craving okonomiyaki, which is not really all too common around SF.\n\nHalu is quite small inside; it seats maybe 20 people max (I think I'm giving a generous estimate). The kitchen is actually right by the front, diner-style. You can actually sit by the kitchen, along the bar. There is a tiny bit more seating along the opposite wall and in the back. I would definitely not recommend this place for larger groups. Even with a group of 5, I feel like we were pushing it.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She recommended that we could share the okonomiyaki (we ended up all getting our own though), and recommended some drinks as well. I think you should be prepared to be upsold on the alcohol though, so keep that in mind. We ended up getting the sparkling peach jelly drink without checking the price, and we had acute sticker shock. Service was very good nonetheless.\n\nThe food itself was good though. I mean, it wasn't extraordinary, but still satisfying. The okonomiyaki were very dense. I got seafood and wasn't quite satisfied with the amount of seafood in it, but my friends got the beef one and were happy with it. That being said, the okonomiyaki is better as a side, shared with a friend, rather than a full meal on its own. I also got the beef tongue yakitori, and it was quite tasty and tender (not tough).

After years of years of yearning, I finally got a chance to try it out last weekend. We came early and were seated right away. To call the place a homage to the Beatles is a vast understatement. The walls are dripping with Beatles memorabilia and the speakers softly hum their tunes. There's even a Beatles drum set on the mezzanine. Well, you get the point, they love the Beatles. \n\nI'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the restaurant is entirely staffed with women. Even the cook in the back is female. The vibe of the place reminded me of the venue in Kill Bill (the first one!) where our heroine went on a killing rampage in a Japanese restaurant/bar. Definitely very cool.\n\nNow we talk abut the food. To start, we went a bit wild on yakitori -- beef tongue, short ribs, bacon wrapped scallops, bacon wrapped tomatoes, chicken wings, and okra. We also ordered the spicy raw octopus and seaweed salad. We got the spicy chashu ramen and seafood Okonomiyaki (Japanese \"pizza\") for the mains.\n\nThe skewers were good. I loved everything, especially the bacon wrapped scallops and the beef tongue. The seasoning were light so you can really taste the freshness of the ingredients. Definitely order a few skewers to share!!\n\nThe spicy raw octopus had a strong wasabi kick that cleared our sinuses. This was my first time eating raw octopus and it was good. The seaweed salad is pretty standard and compared to other places, the portion size was good.\n\nNow, the main attraction, the ramen. I was amazed at how great the noodles were. The broth was top notch and the spiciness great for a cold night, but the noodles completely stole the show. It was so springy and the texture blew me away!! I asked the waitress and she told me that they air freight that stuff over from Japan. No wonder!!\n\nI didn't like the japanese pizza all that much because of all the sauce on top. It made it too salty for my taste. I think if that didn't have all the topping, it would be good.

More skewers were needed. Jamie ordered the $4.50 Pork with Onion Kushikatsu, which was basically a pair of pork tonkatsu kebabs on a stick with sauce and mustard. I followed suit and got me some Chicken Liver Kushi-age, also for $4.50 ' cause I loves me some fried chicken innards (see photo). It looks like a Japanese-American couple runs the place with a hip-looking girl running around waiting on all the incoming diners. It's all good comfort food for the undiscriminating sansei with a pork fetish. That would be me. \n\nAnd in the end... \nThe mochi bacon you take \nIs equal to the mochi bacon you make. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...awesome Japanese bar food with one whip-snapping bowl of spicy ramen \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...as fast as she could possibly serve \nTOTAL - 4 stars...a return visit to Liverpool is in the cards, love", "author": "Ed U."}

Halu was the winner because they served yakitori (and chicken hearts were on the menu).\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1.  Chasu-men (even though we ordered mild, they accidentally gave us spicy, but I loved it!)\n2.  Karaage Ramen (chicken too salty)\n3.  Chicken Hearts (yummy)\n4.  Chicken Gizzards (a little rubbery)\n5.  Crispy Chicken Wings (also yummy-must try)\n\nTheir portions of ramen noodles are HUGE, so make sure you come hungry, otherwise you will be a disappointment to the global movements to eliminate world hunger and poverty.\n\nThe venue is a very small \"hole-in-the-wall\" location.  On a cold night, which occurs often in San Francisco, you do not want to be seated at the bar section of the restaurant right in front of the door.  You will FREEZE because there really is no place for folks who are entering the restaurant to stand and wait to be seated.  Like, the place is for real tiny. \n\nHowever, it is awesomely decorated with lots of posters and photos of famous rock artists (Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, etc.)  \n\nEven though it was a Tuesday night, it was pretty packed for dinner.  The servers were still friendly and worked their butts off, making sure we were happy.\n\nThe one CON I have about this place is that if you want to use your credit card, there is a $20 minimum.  It was only slightly annoying, but not the biggest deal in the world.  I recommend this place for people who have not tried it.  It's got good social energy.", "author": "Elisha Y."}

My Dukedom is at stake!!!\n\nSo here you go Yelp, this is review number 3. \n\nWhat can I say about Halu that hasn't been said by my check in total. I've been here 19 times (20 is coming soon!!!) over the last year. Nineteen. It's just that good. To put it in perspective, I come all the way from Nob Hill JUST to eat here. Those Lyft rides get expensive, but it's damn worth it. I just tell my wallet to man up and suck it up. \n\nSituated on a secluded corner of 8th and Clement, don't let its diminutive appearance fool you. Inside, the interior is jam packed with old school Beatles Memorabilia, old posters,and retro styled decor. They also play music from the old days (and not just the Beatles, I heard the Troggs too). It's a great third or fourth date spot, especially if your significant other likes the Beatles. I still get a kick out of all the cool stuff inside because it gives the place its own personality, something that many restaurants today lack. \n\nBecause it's a small hole in the wall (and family owned and operated to boot), they are almost always busy and crowded to the brim. Be prepared for a wait on busy nights, but don't worry, the food is WORTH it. The servers are friendly (shout out to Erika and her family!) and do their best to accomodate you, but remember, there's only two of them servicing the entire restaurant, so be nice and patient!  \n\nThey are known for their yakitori, (skewers), and the meat quality for the price (7$ on average for 2 skewers at the time of writing this) is insane. \n\nHands down the best beef belly I've ever hand. Period. \n\nTheir chasu and karage ramen is also top notch. I wouldn't say it's the best Ramen in the Bay, but it's the best Ramen in the San Francisco area, imo, and I eat A LOT of ramen. (Sorry Ramen Underground, Ken-Ken, and Izakaya Kou). They close on Sundays and Mondays though, so I have to get my fix elsewhere on those days.\n\nNote: they don't serve sushi here. Don't ask. Neither do they take reservations. You just got to show up, put your name on the list, and sit on that nice quaint bench outside. \n\nThey have an extensive sake menu here too, so prepare to get your drink on too! \n\nSTANDOUT DISHES YOU MUST TRY:\n-Melts with every bite Belly steak (I order this every time without fail)\n-Chicken Avocado Yakitori\n-Okonomiyaki Japanese Pancake\n-Karage Fried Chicken Appetizer (and the ramen).\n-Chicken Heart skewers \n\nI love Halu and I'm going to miss it when I peace out from San Francisco in April. \n\nLONG LIVE HALU! :)", "author": "Jason L."}

I was determined, I was on a mission to eat at Halu.\nWhy it has escaped me for all these years, I will never know but I admit I have been missing out for all of said years.  When I FINALLY made it...\n\nTiny joint. Seats about maybe 20, 25? Bar seating (in front of the grill) and a smattering of small tables. Try to go in a tiny group. The smaller the better. You will have to wait. Get your name on the list, give the nice waitress your phone # and you can either sit in your car or go grab a beer somewhere. Beatles posters EVERYWHERE. \n\nOrder skewers. Order beer. Maybe share an order of ramen if you're exceptionally hungry. (buttered corn ramen! mmm)\n\nMy favorite skewers: \n\nbeef tongue - so damn tender! \nokra - grilled and salted. crunchy. \nchicken stuffed mushroom - oh man I don't even like chicken but this ground chicken stuffed mushroom was DELICIOUS. the chicken was slightly sweet, ground up all nice so it was tender and juicy. \n\nappetizer: tako wasabi. I order this at every yakitori joint because it's probably my favorite thing ever. diced, raw octopus with fresh wasabi. MmMmMmM chewy, spicy, a little crunchy, slightly slimy. Not for those squeamish of raw foods by the way. \n\nHalu doesn't do the tare sauce on their skewers. They just lightly salt the meats/veggies as I feel good yakitori should be done. \n\nWe ordered what I felt was a good amount and the three of us left content and happy. It wasn't until later that I found out from my girlfriend that it was her VERY FIRST TIME having yakitori. So glad that Halu popped that cherry! Halu also carries some good sake if beer isn't your thing. \n\nBe nice to the waitresses. They work hard. It's a small spot, but they're bustling about multitasking like pros. \n\nI've never been to Japan but let me tell you, upon finally seating (after a 25 minute wait, not too bad) I felt like I was transported into a Murakami (my one of my favorite authors of all time by the way, write that down) book in Japan.

The beef skewers were great as well, I liked the one with the avocado spread on top but not the one with cilantro on top. I thought the soy sauce mochi was good to accompany my meat, but it was not amazing. There was no bacon on it or anything special. It was just mochi, seaweed and soy sauce. Also, it came with just two big pieces. We both felt like the pancake was very doughy and the batter made for it was the same as what you would use to make takoyaki balls.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "It all started when I felt like having some okonomiyaki for dinner, and I was so eager to go to Japantown to order takeout.  However, my mother had different ideas.  She felt that Japantown is a little out of our way, despite the fact that I know the ins and outs of the area very well.  I didn't want to argue with her anymore about it, so we chose a place that was a little closer to home -- low and behold, we found Halu.\n\nWhen we first walked in, I was actually a bit shocked of the decor for a Japanese restaurant.  It was a very rinky dinky place, with decor from the 1960s (i.e.: Beatlemania).  Although I'm not opposed to anything from the 50s and 60s, I found it redundant, considering that so many Beatles fans have vilified Yoko Ono as the woman who broke up the band.\n\nTo add more fuel to the fire, I felt that the food was nowhere near superb.  I've had okonomiyaki before, and for the price we paid for our meals, I tasted more \"pancake\" than anything else.  Although there was meat mixed into the dish just as I asked, I couldn't even taste it.  Even with the sauce, mayonnaise, and aonori flakes, it was practically tasteless.  Also, can somebody tell me what you have when you spell B-O-N-I-T-O followed by F-L-A-K-E-S?  That's what their dish DOESN'T have; that's one of the main toppings you put onto it.  Okonomiyaki is supposed to be a savory dish, and there was nothing appetizing about their version of it.\n\nThe reason why I gave this place a 2 is because despite the fact that the food wasn't to our liking, they definitely get points for their customer service; their waitresses were very kind and welcoming.  Originally when we walked in, the door was open, and where we were seated, we felt a really cold draft.  In an attempt to change seats with my mother, one of the waitresses noticed, and asked me if I wanted the door closed.  I said, \"yes\", and she did just that.  She was also very nice to allow us to take up one of their tables while we were waiting for our order to be boxed and bagged.\n\nOther than the good customer service, I would suggest that if you really want a taste of some real okonomiyaki to take a trip to Japantown.  There's a couple of restaurants there that prepare a very traditional and savory okonomiyaki, as well as a Westernized version of it as well.", "author": "Claudine P."}

There was no line, which was a huge excitement too. \n\nMy bf and I arrived at 8:30, and ordered. We got our appetizers 15 minutes later.  Erichan's Special - mochi inside seaweed - was soooooo good. Definitely order that, because you can't really get it anywhere else.  We got the Karobuto Pork hot dogs, which was yummy too but slathered in oil (not sure if good or bad thing). \n\nWe ended up eating our ramen at around 9:10. It was so ridiculous. We had some appetizers come periodically, but stil, our ramen took forever to come. I didn't really understand why it took so long, since it seemed like everyone had arrived before us and was already eating.  Perhaps there was only one cook, but the restaurant is tiny. I don't know why it took so long!  \n\nBut when it came, the ramen was delicious. I got the Chasu Ramen, which had good flavor. They also gave me 3 huge pieces of ramen, which was great. The amount of noodles was also impressive. We were both super full by the end of the night, something we weren't exactly expecting!\n\nAlso I love the atmosphere here.

Prior to moving to New York, I was an izakaya dilettante. How could I not be, given how few authentic izakayas are in San Francisco? Thus, I didn't appreciate what Halu had to offer. A cozy, divey, comfy environment with delicious food and a surprisingly awesome drink selection. I kind of got that sense the first time, but I did not appreciate it as much as I did after having run the gauntlet of NYC izakayas.\n\nTrue, it's definitely not the cheapest at all. But the ambiance was great and with that, sometimes, less is more. I've come to an understanding that there is no \"Kenka\" in NYC, where you can eat and drink super cheaply in an izakaya style. So given that it's gonna be a bit pricier in SF, Halu totally hits the spot. (I compare it with Sun-Chan in NYC which is in my hood.)\n\nIf you need cheap izakaya, try Izakaya Mai in San Mateo.

Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, as the Beatles-theme of this hole in the wall definitely offers a certain uniqueness that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. \n\nHowever, this was sadly the most memorable aspect of our meal. While the food certainly wasn't poor, it remained largely unremarkable and if it weren't for its funky Beatles-theme, I may have forgotten about Halu altogether. \n\nFor starters, the wait time between arrival and actual food consumption is incredibly long. The restaurant is tiny, so it's almost guaranteed a table won't be readily available when you come. Combined with the snail's pace the kitchen maintains, a trip to Halu can be a pretty arduous one. \n\nWait time aside, the food was only middle of the line for me. I came to Halu for three reasons: (1) Bacon Wrapped Mochi (2) Okonomiyaki (3) Ramen. Unfortunately, none of these dishes excelled. \n\nBacon Wrapped Mochi - After months of fantasizing about it , I was super excited to finally sink my teeth into some. However, I was pretty disappointed with the real deal. While the texture of crispy bacon paired nicely with the the soft chewiness of mochi, Halu's was super greasy and on the bland side. \n\nSeafood Okonomiyaki - It took close to 1.5 hours to make; however, the final product didn't quite justify the long preparation time. It was tasty enough and the amount of seafood in it was generous, but the pancake itself was a little burnt. After sitting on the table for a while, it hardened to a cracker-like texture. So, try to eat it immediately, while it's still warm and kind of soft!\n\nRamen - This was the biggest disappointment. I opted for the Corn Butter one while my friends got the Lava and Spicy Karage Ramen. The annoying thing was that they staggered the timing of our ramen. The first two bowls came out together, but the third bowl didn't come out until 30 minutes later. As for the ramen itself, the noodles tasted like the instant kind and didn't have the springy texture that I prefer. The broth was nothing special. Too salty in my opinion. Also, if you have an aversion to spicy foods like I do, stay clear of the Lava and Spicy Karage Ramen. Even my friends who love spicy foods had a hard time getting these down. \n\nOverall, I might be willing to come here again.

Perfect for a warm bowl of ramen in a small cozy Japanese restaurant.\n\n...well until the waitress came over and told us yakitori was their specialty.  doh!  yakitori was indeed pretty good.  I thought the ramen was average but maybe I'm a bit influenced by the fact we waited a good half hour after the yakitori came out for the ramen to be served and it was only 3/4 bowls that came out.  Had to wait another 10-15mins for the 4th bowl to come out.  The spicy pork broth from the chashu lava ramen was indeed very very spicy so watch out.  The karaage chicken part of the karaage chicken ramen was deep fried well so make sure not to get it wet or you'll lose the crispy fried goodness!\n\nand then it was back out to the cold, wet, windy San Francisco night.  Oh until the waitress came out and chased us for a tip because even though it says on the menu gratuity of 20% for parties of more than 6 they don't actually automatically include this on the bill.", "author": "Angela Y."}

DELICIOUS.  Buttery, savory mochi and seaweed.  \n\n7:30 PM - Shrimp skewers arrived.  Sizable shrimp, but roasted to a crisp and it was hard to get the shell off.  No flavor otherwise.  Not worth $11/shrimp.  Owner asked if we were waiting for anything else.  Ummm, yes, MOST OF OUR FOOD.\n\n7:45 PM - Gyoza arrived.  Completely flavorless.  But at least it looked like it was freshly made and not over-fried.  Owner said, \"this should be your last dish!\"  to which we were like, UH NO.\n\n8:00 PM - Owner came and gave us an order of calimari on the house and apologized for the wait.  This was pretty good, and I liked the dipping sauce.\n\n8:05 PM - Steak fillet skewer came.  Probably the second best thing I had here.  Juicy, tender steak with three spoonfuls of daikon on top.  I could've eaten a whole meal of these, but at $12/pop, it's dang expensive.\n\n8:20 PM - Ramen FINALLY came.  Pork was incredibly tender and there were three large pieces, portion size larger than any place I've ever had.  Amazingly chewy and delicious noodles.  Unfortunately, the broth was so salty it was bitter, and I couldn't eat more than a few spoonfuls and had to give the rest to BF.\n\nI seriously cannot believe the turnover is so slow here.  I understand the kitchen is super tiny, but there needs to be a way to streamline things so they aren't asking what else we're missing, and seriously, 2 hours to get all of our food?  Ridiculous.  Either limit your menu so you can just make a couple things and speed it up, or have a better system to take care of your customers so they aren't sitting there, feeling abandoned.  The few times that one of the two girls came to take care of us, they were really nice and sweet, but those moments were really rare.\n\nProbably won't be returning.

We came on a Friday evening at around 745 expecting to wait. Fortunately, there were two available tables upon our arrival.  The space was very small.\n\nThe place wasn't extremely busy but the waitress was all over the place. It took us a while to flag her down and place our orders. Then, it took forever to get our tea (we had to ask twice) and it took at least 35 minutes to receive our orders. That's a LOT of waiting.  However, I was hopeful that the food would make up for the long wait. The seizure-inducing anime on the television set wasn't helping either.\n\nAnd then the food came.. It was excellent. Definitely worth the wait.  We ordered (in pairs of 2 skewers each): \n\nYakitori:\nbacon wrapped mochi, chicken wings, chicken thigh, bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp, pork and onion\n\nKarage:\nBasil chicken, scallops, shrimp\n\nRamen:\nLava\n\nThe yakitori and karage average $5 for 2 skewers.  Portions are on the small side.  Skip the karage - order more yakitori.  My favorite are the chicken wings and bacon wrapped scallop.  The mochi was very interesting with a crunchy exterior.  The basil chicken karage was good too.  The lava ramen was indeed very spicy!  It is the spiciest ramen I have ever had so far, before adding the chili pepper.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't have chicken skin.  Minimum charge for credit cards is $20.\n\nTwo thumbs up!", "author": "Vivian H."}

Although we didn't drink this evening, they offer a wide assortment of Asian alcoholic beverages - beer, sake, soju, and plum wine. \n\nWent there initially to try the ramen, which I would give 2.75 stars for a borderline ok, but the yakitori is amazingly delicious hence the 4-star overall rating. \n\nDecor is charming with an affixiation to the Beatles.

We agreed to wait, but this means outdoors. 75 minutes later we were shown a table.\n\nThe drink orders were so rushed I never got to order before the server left. I asked our food server to send the drink server back but she never did.

I've heard some good things about Halu, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe place is small, but they gave me a seat at the counter right next to the door. Probably the worst seat in the house, constantly being blasted by wind when the door opens and bumped by other people entering and exiting.

I said yes and got it 10 mins after that when she came to take my order. \n\nI ordered karage ramen and beef yakitori. I got my yakitori in 15 mins, but still had no napkin and utensils.

Noodles were solid, karage in it was nice and tender, and a good mix of toppings. The egg was a little disappointing because it was refrigerated, instead of a nice soft boiled egg. The broth was a little salty for my taste as well, but I know this is more of a regional thing. It was a good bowl of ramen, definitely not worth waiting over 60 mins for though.

One of the last bastions of restaurants in San Francisco with character and an amazing menu and staff.  I love the servers although recently we had some misorders. The entire restaurant is Beatles themed with really special memorabilia. I keep finding new items every time I go in. \nWe live 5 blocks away and find any opportunity we can to go there.  \nNot a good place for more than four people.  It's tiny and a little loud. But fun. Good date spot. \nThe yakatori is well composed and relies on perfect cooking time and the flavor of the meat or veggie. Get the chicken wings, chicken heart or avo beef. \nAnd the ramen. Oh my. Although not the best ramen I have had its solid and one of the top 5 in the city.  It is unique like all ramen so don't compare it. To an Ozakaya sozai.  I do recommend getting the chashu ramen spicy. The karage is too dense and takes away from the broth. The corn butter ramen is excellent but not an every visit sort of recipe. \nThe Erichans special is an orgasmic mocha wrapped in nori. Its a little hard to eat but well done. \nAlso don't forget the okonomyaki.  It is filling but prepared light.  The flavors are distinct and traditional making it feel authentic. The price has skyrocketed in the last year but the mixed seafood is awesome.", "author": "Darius D."}

I skipped ordering any yakitori to leave room for sake and ramen. Took longer than expected for our dishes to come out. I had the chashu-men which came with all the usual fixings: corn, ginger, egg, & slices of pork. I did not like the addition of bean sprouts and green onion.

I have driven by a zillion times and never noticed the place until I read the reviews. I arrived @ 5.15pm and from the outside, it looked dark and dingy like there were some construction works going on inside. The sign at the front door still said \"closed\" and the frontage looked uninviting. The inside though was quite cute. The walls were adorned with Beatles paraphernalia, posters of the Grateful Dead, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Signs of a bygone era like \"Love\", \"Peace\" and \"End of War\" were posted in the restaurant. The inside had a funky vibe and the ambience was like an old English pub. it also looked somewhat like my old college dorm! The atmosphere was incompatible with the kind of food they served though I don't mean it in a bad way. I found out that the reason for the upbeat hippie look. The yakitori chef (owner?) was a musician before and obviously a big Beatles fan.\n\nThe decor did bring back some fond memories of the 60s and 70s but the food didn't quite measure up. My biggest disappointment was the chashu ramen. The chashu smelled obnoxious and was a big turnoff. It smelled of pig's urine. Damn! This was the second time in three months that I was served with stinky chashu. My other experience was in Great Eastern in Chinatown. The bad pork spoiled the broth as well and my complaint to the server just fell on deaf ears. I can understand once in a while the shipment of pork they buy might be bad but I can't condone or understand how the chef could have failed to detect this and continue serving it to their customers. A big thumbs down on this one.  \n\nI always order skewer/yakitori items whenever i dined in an izakaya place. I am not sure why I picked the basic yakitori fare like chicken liver, chicken gizzard, shitake, stuffed mushroom and salmon yaki onigiri for the evening. They were not bad but were not great either. In addition, I tried the tako wasabi which had good flavor and did give my jaw a good work out. On hindsight, I am sure what I ordered were not their best. There were other stuffs in the menu yelpers raved about. Included in my next to try list - bacon wrapped mochi, rib eye skewer, agedashi tofu and the seafood okonomiyaki (pancake).\n\nThe restaurant does have a unique atmosphere that I like and has potential for improvement. On the ramen, they need to pay more attention to meat quality, go easier on the salt and allow the pork bones to simmer longer for better broth flavor.", "author": "Geoff G."}

Ok, not that bad, but you get the idea.\n\nThe chashumen ramen was pretty good. Great soup and noodles. However, the chashu pork was chewy, gamey, grey colored and cold as it was floating in the hot broth. You could tell it was refrigerated. Same for the hard boiled egg and corn. The only saving grace for this ramen was the delicious, thick broth and noodles. \n\nWe were told our yakitori order would come AFTER our ramen. It was not-so-good. We had the beef tongue - too chewy. Beef tongue should be tender.  Beef with shiso and ume paste. Traditionally ume(boshi) and flesh-meat are not eaten together. I wanted to try something different. It was OK, but wouldn't do it again. Chicken livers - tasted \"dirty\" and \"muddy.\"  Even my friend who's a fan of offal noticed the off taste. Oyster chicken - couldn't  really figure out where the oyster came in. The shishito peppers were spot on, but how can you f-that up? \n\nThe worst part is the service. Friendly wait staff, but 45 minutes for the ramen and the yakitori served AFTER our ramen?  For real?\n\nThe killer is the tiny space. Waitstaff constantly kicking my chair...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-21", "description": "Coming here was a mishap. We intended to go to Kukje, but people were on CPT so we instead took the opportunity to cross this restaurant off the to-eat list. Even before entering, you know this place has spunk. The canopy says \"A Different Japanese Restaurant\" and the door has \"no sushi today (or tomorrow)\" and \"sushi free zone\" signs on it. The format is sign up and wait, but rather than a communal clipboard for soon-to-be diners, the list seemed to be managed mentally by the servers.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening, we were lucky enough to catch a table upon arrival due to the people before us on the list being neither present nor reachable by phone. Seating was quite limited, with 6 or 7 bar seats and about that many tables. We sat immediately by the door. If you're at the door table with a large(ish) person, I recommend seating them on the side of the table away from the door. As it was, the back of my chair was sometimes getting hit by the door, and a few times my elbow brushed passersby. The many people waiting mostly left and checked back later or waited outside.\n\nBeatles, Beatles, this place is absolutely crawling with Beatles. I hope you like them and I hope you've brushed up on your Beatles edition Rock Band. Beatles music plays from the psychedelic Beatles movie on the screen above the door. Posters are all over the walls and memorabilia crowds the bar top.\n\nAll this eye candy kept us busy during the long, drawn-out time it took for our order to be fulfilled in bits and pieces. The place was packed and something like two people were working the stove, so expect to be patient between ordering and getting your food. We ordered 5 kinds of skewers (chicken heart, beef tongue, pork jowl, bacon-wrapped asparagus x 2, and okra), veggie okonomiyaki (similar to pajeon), veggie don, some beverages, and later red bean ice cream. The skewers arrived in several waves. As described in the menu, it indeed took a while for the okonomiyaki to be prepared. Somehow, it was this wait plus even more time before the veggie don (which I see as a much simpler dish) appeared. Keep in mind that the tiny kitchen was cranking out dishes for everyone in the packed restaurant.\n\nThe food was, in a word, good. Picture in your mind - and mouth - much savory tastiness, and very slowly reread the food items I listed in our order. Imagine. Concentrate. Whatever feelings you had while doing that, that's how good the dishes were. The okonomiyaki included a faint scent x taste that I couldn't name, and I think it was from the combination of the herbs and fixin's on it. I liked the crisp blackened areas on the top and bottom. We took only three \"issues\" with the food. Some of the salted skewers were a bit too salty for my friend, but my friend did appreciate the distinctiveness of the specially prepared house salt. Also, the menu listed the veggie don as being over brown rice, but our rice was white. The third thing I noted was that everything seemed oily: the meats, the vegetables, by association the rice - everything. I realize it all had been made on the same greasy stove. Just be ready for it is what I'm saying.\n\nFrom the time we arrived to the time we departed (and afterward), the workers were more than nice. Friendly, patient, recommending, suggesting, describing... you know, the qualities and actions you want in people who are creating your meal experience. It was a pair of waitresses serving us, but the one who showed up more than the other was animated in her lively talk of the dishes. For example, the don bowl came and its recipient wondered how they'd eat it, as they only had chopsticks. My friend took this somewhat literally and asked our server how to eat the dish. Our server took this to another level and, along with hand gestures, told us her personal process of scooping a bit from one side, scooping some from the other, digging further to get the rice, etc.. This was after a showy recommendation of ways our table could mix up or split the dish to share it. Also, props to our servers and cooks for their flexibility when, about 20 minutes after ordering, we remembered we'd wanted the okonomiyaki sans mayo.\n\nI say the people were still nice after we left because, on our way to our car, we passed by one of the cooks who was hanging out on the sidewalk drinking a hot beverage. They had a friendly conversation with us, friendly even to the point of bowing way too many times. You know how it is. Maybe I'll have to return a few of those bows when friends and I go back to try some of the other dishes that we totally need to eat.", "author": "Dan B."}

They also have both white ($1.50) and brown rice ($2). But note that not all items are available every day. For example, they didn't have hijiki (seaweed) or beef tongue on the days I visited.\n\nThe house salad is delicious, with avocado and cherry tomatoes. In my opinion, the highlight of my meal was the remarkable chicken karaage, nicely seasoned and very moist. The capelin or shisamo (pregnant fish) appetizer was very nice too. You get 4 small grilled whole fish for $4. The ramen is not the best as others have claimed, just good enough (I could make a better bowl at home). And one time they forgot to put the hard boiled egg in my bowl, no big deal.\n\nThe skewers are about $4-5.50 for the meats, and if I remember correctly $2.50-3.00 for the vegetable items. They also have 2 combos that include 7 assorted skewers, with rice and salad ($13.50-16.50). My favorites are the grilled chicken hearts (gizzards are okay too), the stuffed mushrooms, the asparagus wrapped in bacon, and the deep-fried okura (okra).\n\nThis small place has 5 or 6 tables, and 5 seats at the counter. When the place is packed they have trouble keeping up with orders (I had to wait +30 minutes before I got any food). They make most items to order, from chopping and assembling the simple salads, to boiling the water for tea (regular size electric kettle), so that system gets bogged down very easily when the place is full. The food portions are moderate, not overly generous, but still okay. And I think that the prices are reasonable (not cheap), considering the quality you get. The husband & wife work in the kitchen behind the counter, while 2 girls (maybe their daughters?) work as the waiter/servers. One of the girls appears more calm when it gets busy, while the other seems to get flustered.\n\nThis place was formerly Mama-san. I think that this is the 3rd time this location has changed ownership. The first owners were also a mom-pop & daughter setup, that served teriyaki, donburi, katsu, and later expanded into sushi/sashimi. For many years when I lived in this area, it was one of my favorite dinner spots. Many years later they decided to move and sold the business. The second owners kept the name, and changed the menu towards ramen and other items. But were not able to keep the quality of the original.

The Koumi Don is a battered and fried piece of boneless chicken thigh meat served over a bed of toasty brown rice.  The layer of batter is super thin so you can easily overlook it, but it adds a nice bit of crunch to the chicken.  A spring mix of assorted greens combined with a vinegar-based dressing comes on the side along with some thin slices of grilled zucchini that had a wonderful sweetness to them.  \n\nIn addition I had an order each of the Rib Eye Yakitori and the Scallop Bacon Yakitori (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j7ZO28rAdTVlQdE2zJSSTA?select=7IhdX5l9cpEvdaB1I1VA8w).  The rib eye steak cut into bite size pieces then skewered and grilled were very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The scallops wrapped in bacon were just dripping with bacon fat.  Mmmm, bacon fat.  Yes, it was excellent.\n\nI didn't stop there though.  I also had an order each of the Asparagus Bacon Yakitori and the Salmon Yakitori (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j7ZO28rAdTVlQdE2zJSSTA?select=BC6SlJPsIVyuNMHD05mkFQ).  The bacon rolled asparagus pieces were also dripping in bacon fat.  Yum ... bacon fat!  It was the perfect unification of delicious bacon and crunchy asparagus.  The salmon was very good too basted in a sweet teriyaki sauce and topped with granules of black pepper.\n\nI washed everything down with an ice-cold Sapporo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j7ZO28rAdTVlQdE2zJSSTA?select=Ak2lgCTnp9Z7msFqxkuG-Q).

On a busy day, it is pretty hard to get a servers attention at time, but it's not because of negligence. Erika and co. are constantly moving around and when they do get to me, they're nothing but friendly. On a slow day, service is perfect. No complaints.\n\nNext is wait time. On a busy day, it can take awhile for certain things to come out, BUT there always seems to be a steady stream coming to keep me satisfied. I normally spend at least $100 and don't remember a time where we were just waiting with nothing to eat/drink.\n\nAs for food quality, it's amazing. I don't think I've had anything I've disliked at Halu. There are somethings that are better than others (in my opinion), but overall no complaints. Yes, the food is a little salty, but I like salty foods so it's not an issue (may be for others). Beef tongue, pork cheek, chicken liver, cilantro/avocado chicken, shiso/ume beef, okra, eringi and shiitake mushrooms, etc are all things I normally order on skewer. Gyoza, soba salad, and kara age is always good too for appetizers. On occasion they carry green tea tiramisu which is my favorite dessert there.\n\nI don't switch it up on drinks too much but they do have my 2 favorite Japanese alcohol beverages: Orion beer and Iichiko shochu. They do have normal sake, flavored sake, chu hai, etc as well, but I normally don't go for those so can't comment on quality.\n\nLastly, the atmosphere is great. It is a small place, but it reminds me of izakaya in Japan. The Beatles' memorabilia around the place is cool and they always play great tunes.

It probably can seat 20 on the tables and there's a bar seating area as well.  We arrived around 9pm so there wasn't a line to be seated, but the restaurant was a full house.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nchicken ka raage - A.  The batter was very light and served straight from the fryer.  Crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside.  Cooked to perfection!  Some japanese restaurants serve the mayonnaise with the ka raage but. this place doesn't.  still a great appetizer full of flavor and juicy yummyness!\n\nmiso soup - i don't think i've ever had miso soup with enoki mushrooms and it was a nice complement to the tofu rather than just green onions.  i love how everything they serve is HOT, like they prepared it specifically for you.  it actually took me almost 5 minutes for me to drink the soup without being worried about burning my tongue!  the flavor was perfect.  salty, but not too salty. tofu was soft, but not so much that it was falling apart.  and i'm still loving the enoki mushroom!\n\nbeef and veggie okonomiyaki - BEWARE, there is some dried shrimp for those with seafood allergies!  i wasn't a huge fan of this plate.  there was too much sauce, too many flavors.  but, i actually think this may be what authentic okonomiyaki is supposed to be like, so it's probably just my personal taste in food.\n\nstuffed mushroom yakitori - my favorite of the night!  marinated to perfection.  again, served HOT.  you bite into the mushroom and it's a burst of delicious teriyaki, meat, mushroom all in one bite.  really really amazing.\n\nshort rib yakitori - very delicious!  i only had a small bite because i was getting full but definitely worth getting again the next time we go!\n\nbacon wrapped asparagus yakitori - who doesn't love bacon wrapped ANYTHING.  it was really delicious.  the asparagus was still crunchy and the bacon was cooked just the right amount to bring out all the toasty bacon flavor but soft enough to wrap like a blanket around the asparagus.

Halu is a refreshing change.  The location is small and intimate, which for some reason makes it feel more Japanese and is covered with old music memorabilia, mostly Beatles stuff with sprinkles of Jimi Hendricks and the Doors.  They serve yakitori, but I came for the ramen.\n\nWe wanted to split a tall Asahi, but our waitress suggested the quart-sized cans of Asahi for just $3 more imported direct from Japan.  I've never been to Japan, but I feel like it's the sort of thing sold in vending machines next to panty hose and condoms.  Anyway, I ordered the Chasu, and I got two thick pieces of pork belly, half a hard-boiled egg, and ginger.  It was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken karaage.  He liked mine more.  :)  I'm afraid, though, that I was a little surprised by the $10.50 price tag on my bowl of ramen ($11.50 for the karaage).  It wasn't as outrageous as a $14 bowl at Ippudo in the East Village but still pretty shocking this being the Inner Richmond.

Instead she said, \"there's this Japanese place around the corner, I've never been, do you want to check it out?\" I am game to try new spots, so we skipped on over to 8th and Clement to discover a small restaurant (I think hole-in-the-wall is an exaggeration unless you're talking Yamo-sized) which seemed packed but happened to have a table for two, and bar space as well for the people who came in after us.\n\nThe servers were very friendly, and seated us right away. Immediately I noticed the decor--this place was packed with Beatles memorabilia, and other bands as well--a Jimi Hendrix poster hung on the high wall over the front-of-house kitchen, a couple of Who posters--but mostly the Beatles. There was even a drum kit on a tiny balcony over the entrance, which looked possibly only just large enough to host a three-piece band, should one ever want to perform a rock concert in the tiny space. Despite the obvious theme, there was nothing precious or kitschy-seeming about the place--it felt like you were in someone's home, albeit someone who had a thing for classic rock posters. The vibe was totally friendly too... the servers seemed like they were down-to-earth, but there was no slacking when it came to attentiveness. \n\nWe were presented with an enormous menu, which, along with the specials list(s) and many handwritten labels for items on the wall, contained such wonders as \"Avochick\" or chicken thigh skewers with spicy guac, a savory fried butter mochi wrapped in nori, an array of yakitori items, several ramen options, ochazuke, okonomiyaki, and other intriguing specialties. I was pretty excited.\n\nOnce we finally made up our minds, we ordered yakitori, kara age \"don don,\" and the butter mochi appetizer. Everything came out pretty quickly, even though the restaurant was full, and my friend and I enjoyed catching up and checking out the scenery in the meantime. The rad server even offered an suggestion for how my friend could eat her meat (\"like a popsicle\") when she noticed my friend having trouble getting everything off the bone. The food runner (who maybe also was the chef?) presented everything formally and gave us the Japanese names. \n\nOh and the food? Super delicious... homey in presentation but served on super cute plates (apparently bought from the restaurant supply place around the corner) and succulent. Butter mochi? Buttery. Kara age? Light and with a small flavorful salad and scoop of rice for a totally satisfying meal. I didn't try my friend's yakitori but she practically licked her plate clean so I'm thinking that it was bomb. \n\nOur total bill, including tip, was $40, not bad for a fully satisfying, unpretentious, fun izakaya experience in SF, and with leftovers to boot. The servers were totally cool with us sitting and chatting, even for a while after we had paid (which I usually feel guilty about doing at most good and small SF restaurants).

(Makes everything taste better)\n- thinner, old school, negi ramen noodles (like the instant noodle kind...)\n- darker colored broth\n\nThis is old school ramen.

The broth was SO good that I ordered an extra bowl of rice and mixed it in to finish it off!  \n\nThe difference between Santa Ramen and Halu is definately the type of noodles and the two completely different flavors.

The miso broth was rich, savory, and not too salty. There was tender pieces of enoki mushrooms and tofu. The scallions added a great freshness to the soup.\n\n*Agedashi  Tofu ($6): YUM! The silken tofu was lightly fried to a light golden brown. The outer layer was slightly gelatinous w/ a light crunch and the tofu was velvety smooth. The tentsuyu broth married well w/ the tofu adding a salty and sweet savoryness.\n\n*Yaki Nasu (Baked eggplant - $6.50): Meh. Although the eggplant was soft and tender, it was very bland b/c it was lacking the miso paste. \n\n*Bacon Mochi ($5): YUM! The smoky, savory, and fatty bacon was a nice contrast to the soft and chewy glutinous mochi which had a hint of sweetness. \n\n*Pork Jowl ($5.50): YUM! The pork jowl which is like a lean pork belly was grilled to perfection. It was juicy, moist, well-seasoned w/ hint of smokiness from the char marks. \n\n*Kushikatsu Scallop ($5.50): OMG--SO GOOD! The scallop was battered w/ panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried to a golden brown. The crust was light and crispy and the scallop was incredibly succulent, sweet, and tender. The accompanying tonkatsu sauce complemented the scallops well as it added a tangy sweet flavor.\n\n*Short Rib Skewer ($5 for 2): YUM! The short rib was perfectly grilled; the beef was tender, moist, and well-seasoned.\n\n*Chasu Ramen ($9.95): It was just ok and I don't understand what the hype is all about. Although the chasu was tender, the broth was salty as opposed to being \"flavorful\". The noodles were overcooked almost to the point it was borderline mushy. And, the egg was a hard boiled egg and not a brown egg which is more flavorful. Overall, the ramen was missing the depth of flavor from the broth which results from simmering pork/beef bones for a long period of time. \n\nSERVICE: \nThe service was ok, but aloof at times. Upon arrival, we stood there for several minutes before being acknowledged. When the waitress (owner's daughter?) finally noticed us, she ask us to sit at the counter, but we politely requested a table instead. She then walked off w/o saying anything and came back 2 minutes later and placed menus at the counter. I had to repeat myself again until she complied which made for a slightly uncomfortable situation.\n\nService is typical of any Asian restaurant where they don't check in w/ you and you have to ask if you need/want anything. The food did take a while to come out so it took about 2 hours for dinner.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nA hippie's haven; Beatles memorabilia and other d\u00e9cor reminiscent of the 70s. Halu is TINY; there's about seating for 20-24 and for 5 at the counter. \n\nI have to note that being in the bathroom is a bit unnerving. First, you have to put your hand into a wooden box outside the bathroom to turn on the lights and there is a huge water heater in the bathroom which is a safety hazard. \n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking which can be difficult in the Inner Richmond. There is a metered parking lot at the corner on 8th Ave, but it's metered until 12 midnight. \n\nI highly doubt I would return for the ramen since there has been a proliferation of ramen shops that serve superior ramen. However, I would return for their Izakaya and low-key funky vibe.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The inside is as small as it looks on the outside but the unique thing about this place is that everything is about The Beatles and the 60s.  It's just way too funny.  It's just not very expected when you walk into a ramen place.  Oh, and NO sushi.  Halu makes it very clear before you walk into the door that it's not a sushi place.  They only serve yakitori and ramen.  \n\nLet me say that I think Halu serves the best spicy karage ramen.  It comes with freshly fried chicken, bean sprouts, corn and a bit of ginger.  I love it.  It's great on a nice cold day.  I'm not sure how else to describe it.  The broth is spicy but not so spicy that it'll make you cry.  It's at the perfect level of spiciness.  However, the spicy ramen here is spicier than most other ramen places that I've tried.  It's a great kick if you love spicy food that won't kill you.", "author": "Shirley T."}

MONTHS!\n\nEver since my friend told me about it and we looked at pictures of bacon wrapped scallops and ramen on Yelp, I've been craving it!! Due to different schedules, we had to wait til winter break and here we are! :) We were lucky that it was rainy because that made hot steaming ramen sound even more appealing!\n\nSo we arrived at 5 pm (right when they opened) and it was pretty empty except for one guy at the bar. That was definitely a good thing, especially since we didn't want to be stuck waiting around!\nThe servers are SUPER DUPER nice and so friendly and helpful! Our waitress accidentally missed my order, but she was so genuinely sorry and kept apologizing that I started to feel bad for even mentioning it. She even took a picture of my friend and I! :)\n\nAnyway, the most important part was the food, so lets get to that! My friend ordered the chashu (roast pork) ramen and I got the yasai (veggie) ramen. It was OH-SO-DELICIOUS, but I have to admit, it's a HUGE portion!! Not that I'm complaining..I ate it the next day for lunch! \nWe also shared 3 different kinds of yakitori: salmon, bacon wrapped scallop, and bacon wrapped MOCHI!! Highly recommend the bacon wrapped mochi! :D I didn't see the special menu until later, but I'm itching to try the beef tongue yakitori next time I stop in!\nGuess we were feeling pretty hungry, so we also got a beef & veggie okonomiyake! That was good as well. Nice crispy edges :)\n\nInside, there is a bunch of Beatles memorabilia, as well as some other awesome rock legends, like Jimi Hendrix and the Shitones. It's fun to look at everything and a great way to kill time while waiting for the food to come out! My friend and I got to sit next to the holographic yellow submarine poster! :D\n\nOverall, it's a great little ramen place with a unique atmosphere, friendly staff, and FANTASTIC food!! :D You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be coming back!

Today was one of those days, it was cold and rainy and nothing would make me feel better than sipping hot broth and slurping down some yummy noodles!  \n\nI have been to Halu a few times now and have tried their Ramen and Okonomiyaki. The Chasu Ramen has tender Chasu with bean sprouts, corn and a porky flavor broth. While on teh other hand the Karaage Ramen contains very flavorful Chiken Kaarage that is fried to perfection, not too oily and not overly fried.

We came here on a random Wednesday night. I was feeling a little sick and wanted something to warm me up a little and thought ramen would be the perfect solution! \n\nArrived here at around 8:15, no line, got seated right away and ordered promptly. We got the Eichan's special and 2 ramen bowls. It took about 10 minutes for the butter-basted mochi to arrive, which is a bit long considered the level of difficulty to cook mochi in a pan of butter. It was still good though. After that, we waited (no kidding) 30 MINUTES for our ramen, we didn't start eating our ramen till about 9:00, we were annoyed and hungry. and kept looking for our meal to come. I mean come on, it seriously doesn't take 30 whole minutes to boil some noodles, warm the broth, throw in an egg and heat up some pork. We do admit, it was good ramen and the wait staff was very nice and friendly. They did notice we were getting a little restless, but didn't offer anything to compensate our lackluster food service. \n\nNot sure if I'll be quick to return here, we've been here before and recall that service wasn't that bad. I'll have to give it some time, but for now Izakaya Sozai is my new go-to ramen spot.", "author": "Justin L."}

I'd say about seven of those ten occasions were unenjoyable due to service issues - I suppose my most recent effort was the final straw.\n\nWe put our name on the list and waited outside. Two people leave, then the one couple before us came back to be seated, then two people leave, three people enter, two more enter...we begin to wonder to ourselves why so many are going in and none of them are coming back out...\n\nSo we check. The waitress was just seating people because they walked in at the right moment. She hadn't forgotten about us outside, but had no regard for the \"waiting list\". Over the course of 30 minutes she had seated 5 people, none of which were before us on the list. We asked why; she was completely unapologetic. The three that she sat down at a four-seat table first because we were only two? Understandable. But how many times was she going to do that while we waited for half an hour. Needless to say, after ten generous times, I'm done trying. And you know what? The ramen isn't really that good. There. I said it.\n\nBut it's not all bad! After walking straight out the door we made our way to Thai Time directly across the street, another little hole-in-the-wall place that admittedly we had been too afraid to try. We were immediately seated to find an extensive menu of excellent thai food, and without us even asking, our waitress moved us from our two-seat table to a four-seat table once it was available simply because we had ordered so many dishes.

Great decor, cozy joint, also great restaurant ambiance! Waitresses were extremely friendly, and despite having to wait 45 minutes to be seated it was worth it.\n\nWaiting for the food was a little long though, we were seated at around 9pm and food didn't come until nearly 10pm. I was ready to just stuff myself on yakitori, so I ordered bacon-wrapped quail egg, chicken hearts, gizzards, bacon-wrapped enoki, and some grilled mountain boar sausage. My friend ordered shiso steak, bacon-wrapped zucchini, and the same chicken innards. The food came out in segments rather than all at once, which kind of made me restless when I finished the portion and had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the second.\n\nYakitori isn't filling, but I didn't want to order anything else. Definitely didn't leave full, but I'd love to come back again to have a few drinks + yakitori. Something that bothered me was that the waitress said the kitchen closed at 10:45 so we couldn't order past that point, but there were people who came out as we left (10:30) so I'm guessing they know the owners or something. \n\nI was told that the yakitori + okonomiyaki here was good, and everything else on the menu sort of lacked--so I played it safe. I definitely recommend coming here if you're in a small party and want to sit at the bar and have drinks with friends (their selection seems generous) and yakitori.", "author": "Ling C."}

They have their special miso (or soy, whichever one you choose) broth with their awesome noodles. I opted to go for the vegetarian ramen, which I thought I'd regret, but their variety of 10(!) vegetables kept my tongue satisfied and tummy full!\n\nIf you don't mind waiting a while, I'd say come here and enjoy a nice, large bowl of Japanese ramen!

Really.  I'm ashamed.\n\nThis Saturday night, we donned our wool coats and braved the fog to try out Halu.  Again, I'm embarrassed to say that although we always think the Richmond is \"so far away,\" it took us like, 12 minutes to drive here from the Mission.  And we parked like, 12 feet away from the restaurant.  So really, we need to stop bitching about such things.\n\nThere was a 20 minute wait so we walked over to the 540 Club on Clement for a quick $2 PBR.  Halu called us in almost exactly 20-25 min. and we were immediately seated upon our re-arrival.  \n\nService was a little spotty-- I think one of the servers was new.  But they were both super cute and nice so I'll give them a pass.\n\nBut the food was spot on.  We basically ate everything that most people wouldn't on the menu, including:\n\n-Dark pork sausage: LOVED\n-Chicken hearts: Liked\n-Katsu liver: LOVED\n-Chicken skin: LOVED (eat it while its hot!)\n-Chicken oysters: LOVED\n-Okra: LOVED\n-Bacon-wrapped quail egg: Recommended by our waitress, probably a favorite of most white people but it was kind of too chewy for us\n-Shishito peppers: Liked\n-Seafood okinomiyaki: LOVED\n\nAll that and a large beer cost us about $75.  It was probably too much food but we wanted to try lots of things.  Lots of people were eating ramen, so maybe we'll try that next time, although its difficult to turn down grilled animal parts :)\n\nGREAT Yakitori place.

Somehow I'd decided on the way over that I didn't feel like going here, didn't know why I was going, etc. So I was ready not to like it. But Halu excelled despite my negative attitude! At 7:30 on a Thurs night we actually didn't have to wait for a table for 5, which seemed lucky.\n\nWe went fairly all out on the food, focusing on the yakitori. Favorites: ground chicken (nice and loose, rather than having the hockey puck texture of so many meatball-type items), short ribs (a little chewy but very flavorful), fried tofu appetizer (delicious!!). Good: chicken wings, chicken thighs, kara age (fried chicken) Wouldn't get next time: bacon-wrapped asparagus. Good idea, but I found that some of the bacon wasn't very crisp and was more limp. I would try to get more vegetables overall if I were the one ordering next time. Surprisingly good: whichever salad we had, which had unusually sweet and tasty strawberries and nice chunks of creamy avocado.\n\nI really liked the overall saltiness of a lot of the items - I know it'll apparently kill you faster than you thought and everything, but it was a nice touch on crispy exteriors.\n\nAnd don't worry, fellow Beatles haters, they only played Beatles music for like half the time we were there.", "author": "Lisa K."}

The yasai was chock full of different veggies and while the broth isn't as rich or porky as say, santouka/orenchi, but it was still fulfilling and the noodles were up to par. Yakitori? Beef tongue was done well! Donburi? Our koumi don (lightly breaded and fried chicken) was done really well, atop a bed of brown rice with salad and grilled eggplants on the side. And kushikatsu? You don't see much kushikatsu in other restaurants--breaded and lightly fried. Our pork and onion was yum. \n\nBasically, there's a little something to satiate every Japanese culinary desire in you.

There was a long wait so they offered to take our name/number and call when the table was ready.

The place is also pretty tiny so out of respect for their customers they have folks wait outside.

However, our minds changed upon walking out and being greeted by the rain.  Usually when its a cold day, social norm calls for a variation of soup, pho usually.  However, having recently tapped into the dish called ramen, I opted for that.  We drove to Izakaya Sozai, our initial choice, however, were crestfallen to learn that it was closed on that particular day.  Changing my search parameters on my yelp application, Halu had the next best rating.\n\nThis place is tiny and cozy, a true hole in the wall.  However, imagine this hole in the wall completely adorned with Beatles memorabilia.  Posters are hung and there are many books and booblehead variants of the Liverpool quartet; Beatles music softly serves as the soundtrack for your impending meal.   From reading previous yelp reviews, it seemed that wait would be a while, however, we came around 9:30 pm, and while the restaurant was jam packed, the waitress quickly had us seated at the makeshift bar.  Service was very slow as the waitresses took forever to give us water and even longer to take our order.  This seemed to be a reoccurring theme as I saw many patrons tap their nails impatiently on the table.  However, the waitresses were neither standoffish nor pretentious, offering a kind word of patience or chatting us up.  I ordered the chasu-men and a side of agadashi tofu while hahnjob ordered the special spicy ramen.\n\nMy tofu took about 20 minutes to get to us while our ramen took abou 40.  The tofu was good, fried just right and served in a bowl of some sauce.  I don't know exactly what it is...a variation of soy/ponzu....but it was delicious.  I prefer a little crispier tofu but all in all, this was a solid dish.  My ramen, however, was very average.  After eating Himiwari's ramen with pork belly, I can't go back to eating the pieces of chasu.  They are good pieces of pork, however, not as flavorful as the pork belly.  The noodles did not stand out at all.  They tasted eerily similar to the instant ramen noodles.  They were a bit too hard.  Himiwari also ruined my egg experience; I can no longer eat tea eggs with my ramen.  I prefer the boiled ones where the insides are still goeey and mix with the soup base once broken.  Scooping up corn pieces were scarce and I was amazed when my spoon finally ensnared one.  There was also no seaweed; i thought seaweed was a staple however the bean sprouts were a welcome addition.  However, the broth was good, savory and not too salty.  The food was average and the wait long, however, the waitresses were very outgoing.  In addition, this cramped hole deserves a visit; the ambiance is unique and one of a kind and I will be back to try their specialty, the yakitori.

Being seated for 20 minutes before even having someone stop by to get our order was criminal too.\n\nBut really, we're here to rate the food aren't we.\n\nHalu seems like a rip off.\n\nHonestly, if I order a donburi, or the soba, I do NOT want half the friggin plate to be a salad. And there's nothing under the salad, so it isn't like it's hiding more rice, or more soba noodles.\n\nAnd the soba, really, it comes with avocado. That's fine, I love avocado, I just don't love it when the dish is put in front of me and it's already turning brown and grey. Talk about a major turn off.\n\nThe seafood okonomiyaki was the star of the show here, really good, and a nice crust. Would come back to order that, but I don't think it's worth an hour wait just to get food when it seems like every other table around you is getting what they ordered.", "author": "David H."}

The Beatles decor is totally random but gives this place personality. I had the ramen which was so so. I liked the al dente noodles and the chasu pork is flavorful. But it was missing the rich and creamy tonkotsu broth I was hoping for on a cold day. And for 12 bucks, it's not cheap. The service was fast and very friendly though. Will have to try the yakitori next time. Although the lack of charcoal smell in the air makes me wonder how it's cooked.", "author": "William B."}

It was a really cold night in SF and the place doesn't have glass in the windows (?!?) so it was FREEZING in there.  It kind of detracted from the food because you really want your ramen piping hot, don't you?  Next, they completely screwed up our order and were bringing out the most random dishes.  What I assumed was my vegetarian dish turned out to have tiny bits of beef hidden within it and I didn't find out until they brought my actual veg dish, when the other one was already half way gone.  For someone who has been a vegetarian for 16 years, finding out that I had just nommed a half plate of cow was just a little bit devastating to my psyche and my tummy.  \n\nDespite the very poor service the food was phenom (yes, carnivores, even the mysterious beefy one tasted deliciuos).  Asparagus Yakitori was delicious if of tne small side, and my buddy loved the ramen.  Points also redeemed for the music and the classic rock decor.  \n\nI would probably go back here but next time I will be sure to double check what everything is before digging in.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Anyway, that's why I'm knocking down a star but ONLY for service. \n\nOverall...\n-GREAT ramen and not too expensive, had enough flavor without tasting like MSG.\n-Best Karaage around, though not the kind with the teryaki sauce.\n-Will definitely be back for the ramen and karaage.\n\nThe bad..\n-Service seemed extremely slow and without offering any apologies\n-not a good place for a larger group\n-decor is lacking any Japanese influence whatsoever and instead made you feel like you were throw back in the 60's hippies era dinners with all those Beatles memorabilia covering the walls.", "author": "Petra S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-15", "description": "This was all our fault.\n\nWe really, really wanted to like this place. It's a cozy hole-in-the-wall with Beatles & Hendrix memorabilia adorning the walls. Just a handful of tables, a fair number of regulars (judging by the other Yelp reviews & labeled saki bottles), and a high rating on Yelp. Must be good, right?\n\nThat's what we expected when we walked in. I should add that we were starving for ramen also. I did a search on the Yelp iPhone app and this was the second search result. We glanced at the high-level reviews and decided to go for it.\n\nOur experience:\n\n+ Got there at 9:00pm on a Friday night. The place was packed. That's a good sign.\n\n+ Got a seat right away. Score!\n\n+ 30min wait before being able to order. That's okay, it's fairly crowded. There's only one waitress on staff, so she's probably swamped.\n\n+ 15min wait for edamame. Cool enough. The crowds are disappearing now and there are a few empty tables. Hopefully since the rush is subsiding, we'll get our food soon.\n\n+ 45min wait for the rest of our food. Okay, not cool. It's 10:30pm now and we're starving. So much for getting our food soon.\n\n+ 10min to scarf down our food because we were so hungry. I burned my tongue slurping down the scalding ramen. :-P\n\n+ 20min wait to get the check. It's 11:00pm now. Fan-f'ing-tastic.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the food, we looked back at the Yelp reviews. That's when we began to see all the 1-2 star ratings. They mostly complained about a long wait and poor ramen. Uh oh. That's what we came here for: ramen. We also came here starving and expecting to get the food in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe 4-5 star ratings raved about their yakitori and fried dishes. Damn. One reviewer wrote that the waitress told him, \"We're not a ramen shop,\" as an explanation for why the ramen was taking so long. Double damn.\n\nAnd the ramen itself? Average. It wasn't bad, to be honest. A little salty for my taste, but not stellar. I've had better ramen. I'm a bit of a ramen snob too, so I may have unrealistic expectations for a place that's not a ramen shop. :-P\n\nAlso, after we finished the ramen, the surface of the broth congealed, showing how much fat was in it. That's not too unusual, but well-made ramen doesn't congeal like that. You see drops of fat on the surface instead.\n\nWhat really killed Halu for us was the wait. It took us an hour and a half to get our main meals. Thank goodness we ordered edamame, otherwise we would have just gotten up and left. (We were seriously debating that too.)\n\nBut really, this was all our fault.\n\nWhy? We should have read the Yelp reviews more closely. Just because Halu was the second search result for \"ramen in san francisco\" doesn't mean it's the second-based place for ramen in San Francisco. (So maybe it's Yelp's fault? ;-)\n\nIf we had read through some of the negative reviews, perhaps we would have adjusted our expectations accordingly. Or gone somewhere else.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\n+ Come here when you're not starving.\n\n+ Come here for some drinks & snacks.\n\n+ Order the fried foods. Stay away from the ramen.\n\n+ Be prepared for a long wait.\n\nWith those expectations, I'm sure you'll have a better experience than we did.", "author": "Mike L."}

They don't have a waiting area because space is so tight, so you leave your name and number. I love it because after putting down your name, you can walk off and window shop on Clement Street. \n\nThe order was:\n\n* Chashu-men Lava (spicy) $12.50 (4 of 5) Very spicy and noodle was quite al dente. The noodle texture reminds me of real good egg noodle. But the pork slices are very soft. Melt in your mouth type of pork. Also, I really like the lava, so it will be hard to try the non-spicy flavor when I drop by next time. Great portion. This ramen portion is actually shareable. \nNote regular is $10.50 \n* Kara Age Ramen $12 (3.5 of 5) Very good broth and you get 5 nicely fried pieces of chicken. But in comparison, the chashu-men is a lot tastier. Great portion. This ramen portion is also shareable. \nNote spicy is $12.50\n* Bacon Mochi 2 for $6 (5 of 5) Yummy. Like eating marshmellows wrapped in bacon. It was fluffy and crispy at the same time. Delicious. \n* Oyster Chicken $3/each (3.5 of 5) Twist on chicken skewers. Topped with white mayo type sauce and scallions. It was juicy white chicken breast meat. \n* Stuffed Mushrooms $3 (3 of 5) Mushroom was juicy. But I saw the other table had a fried version of the stuffed mushroom and that looked a lot more amazing. I think their tempura skewer is probably a better item to order. I will skip stuffed mushrooms and go for their katsu mushroom next time.\n* Beef Tongue $3 (5 of 5) Fresh and bbqed perfectly. It was delicious. Juicy and crunchy. I highly recommend this skewer.\n\nFun place, but not recommended for large groups. Can't wait to go back and try more yakatori from their menu. So many choices.", "author": "Janice T."}

If I could, I would put 3.5 stars, mostly because I feel like a ramen place should have great quality ramen noodles. Halu's broth was pretty amazing, very pork-based with a shoyu complement, but of the spoonful of noodles I sampled (since I can't eat too much wheat anymore), they seemed soggy.\n\nOther than that, the fried buttered shoyu (or tamari? I forget) mochi was super super amazing. Warm, salty, crispy chewiness. And if you love mushrooms and avocado, you will love the Veggie Donburi, which comes with a side salad of nothing but greens and the buttered mushrooms/avocado are over a bed of seasoned brown rice. Three kinds of mushrooms, too.\n\nGreat service, though, and a sweet atmosphere. It's like a cubby corner filled with Beatles paraphernalia.", "author": "Helen I."}

You found a nice little dive for yourself where you can enjoy their memorabilia and tunes over the speakers.  \n\nHowever, as for their food and service (which is the most important aspect of going to a restaurant) is...to be nice, very overrated.  I've been here about 3 times and each time, the food does not come to table until I've basically lost my patience to wait any longer.  There is absolutely nothing worse than waiting too long to get your food, especially when the ramen here isn't even that good!  To be fair, the yakitori is okay and I could give them 2 stars because of it. But the server - the one who handles the waitlist - didn't even apologize to me when I asked her how much longer I have to wait to get my food.  I understand the restaurant was packed and there were people on the waitlist.  But all I ordered was just ramen.  That was it, and I waited over 50 minutes for it.  While being thoroughly agitated, I realized why there is such a long waitlist.  It's because the cooks take so damn long to cook the food.  Again, I like to stress that this is based on all 3 times that I've eaten here.  And each and every time that I've been here, the food comes out at a glacial pace.  To top it off, when one of the parties on the waitlist came in to ask the server how much longer he would have to wait, the server disingenuously said that it would take about 10 more minutes.  The patron then replied that she already told him that he would be waiting for about 15 minutes but he's waited for over 50 minutes.  Instead of being apologetic, she gets defensive and tells him that she cannot control the patrons that are inside the restaurant.  I was basically fuming at this point and wanted to chew her out.  Instead, I got my check and went on my way, deciding that I would never come back.  The excessive wait for the food is just not worth what you receive in return on your plate or in service.  As a I was leaving, I almost recommended the same guy who was still waiting with his girlfriend to go somewhere else instead.  I hope he had a much more pleasant experience.\n\nHey Jude, your restaurant should strive to do better.", "author": "Evan H."}

Halu is a cute little restaurant in the heart of the Richmond district where having a restaurant is extremely competitive. It's a hole in the wall ran by a family; one sister cooks in the kitchen, the other waitresses. \n\nI came here with a friend at 7:30 on a weeknight and took the last available table.  I let her do all the ordering.  She ended up ordering beef tongue, a really fatty pork, stuffed mushrooms, butter corn ramen, and bacon wrapped asparagus.  Sounds like an unreasonable amount of food between 2 people, but everything except the ramen comes in small portions, yakitori style.\n\nBeef tongue was extremely tasty.  It was seasoned perfectly and had a really good flavor.  If I didn't know it was tongue, I would've thought it was small pieces of steak.\nFatty pork (can't remember the proper name on the menu), was memorable.  It was grilled so the fat catches the off the grill taste while being crispy on the outside and around the edges.\nStuffed mushrooms were my fave!  They're stuffed with some meat and covered in panko, then deep fried.  When you bite into them, they're juicy and crispy. SO GOOD.  Theyre also served with some sauce.  Honestly, the mushrooms on their own are tasty enough.\nBacon wrapped asparagus, can't go wrong with that.  I thought the price was a little expensive for a total of maybe 1 spear and 2 strips of bacon.\nRamen was average.  I don't know if I'd say Halu's specialty is ramen so if you're looking for ramen, go somewhere else.  The noodles weren't overcooked and the broth was light with a mild flavor.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun place to go to, try Halu.  It's not your typical sit-down restaurant where you order your own big plate to yourself.

I recall seeing this when I was still in High school, but not sure what they are really known for. \n\nFrom reading the reviews, I just went with the basics, a bowl of cha-su ramen. The bowl of ramen contained only  a couple pieces of cha-su and less than 10 pieces of each - bean sports, corn and even green onions. My sister asked to have her vegetables to be set on the side and that's how we have noticed that a $10.50 bowl of cha-su ramen has so LITTLE vegetables. These were not high grade or the most expensive type of vegetables too. The cha-su was just terrible in texture, I felt like I had some Chinese hard boiled pork from the soup base and it was just not satisfying. \n\nI would say that Ramen is not their \"best\" at this location. If you were considering having lots of sake, wine, or beer, maybe this is just the type of place to be - to have BAR food with your alcohol, but not a $$ worth 4 star rating restaurant. \n\nThe reason I gave one star is because at the end of my unfinished bowl of ramen, the waitress showed courtesy to ask how was the food.", "author": "M W."}

The door also looks like it is a side entrance which can throw first-time visitors off. they have a counter/bar set up with hooks for purses and a big stand for umbrellas on wet days. Oh and hooks by the door for big jackets. I just wish the first available table wasn't so close to those jackets. I would say this place isn't good for groups larger than 4.\n\nThe bacon-wrapped scallop skewers were really good but at $5 for two it's a bit much. I do like how they offer three types of ramen (pork, chicken and veggie) but vegetarians beware the broth is meat based!\n\nI got the kara age ramen and i liked how the pieces of chicken were really large and managed to keep its crispiness even after being in the broth for a while. I didn't like how the broth tasted pretty salty but that's probably because of the chicken. \n\nAccording to Yelp they take credit cards, however last night they were only accepting cash (which was known from a sign where the register is). Luckily my friend and I had cash but this should have been communicated early on. I think I'll keep looking for that perfect ramen spot in the city, but they were really nice.", "author": "Liz S."}

They have approx 4 tables in the back which can hold 4 skinny people and the rest were 2s.  This is a tiny place like Katana-ya in Downtown.  \nIf you like yakatori in small portions, they have a large selection but you will go away hungry unless you supplement with some of their other dishes.  Most of the yakatori items were $4-$5 for 2 skewers but the items on the skewers were probably only 4 in long.  \n\nWe started off with a very peppery and over-salted beef and onion yakatori that was so-so.  The panko breaded basil chicken was much better.  The okonomiyaki (pancake) was $10 and resembled an Asian small personal pizza but was soggy and had way too much mayonnaise.  We ordered the beef but I think we got the seafood because it tasted and looked like it had a lot of white fish in it.  Heavily topped with green onions.  Doubt that we'd try this again. \n\nJr. Yelper liked his karage-chicken with a large serving of rice and green salad.  Hubby had the karage-chicken ramen which was good.  I had the roasted pork ramen.  The meat was tender and good but hands down, the best pork ramen to be had would still be at Santa Ramen in San Mateo.  The noodles were good and I had 1/2 slice of hard-boiled egg in it but it was pretty salty.  I think the egg was marinated as the whites of the egg was tinted brownish, probably in soy sauce. \n\nThey were busy for dinner.  One primary waitress took the orders and the other 2 women in back were cooking and the owner would help out.  The primary cook was the male.  They really could benefit from having another staff work the tables or at least a busboy.  Service was exceedingly slow, even 'tho the staff was very nice.  If you're in a hurry, this is not the place to come eat.", "author": "Ry T."}

Halu is a really tiny restaurant hidden in richmond neighborhood. The inside is decked out with Beatles memorabilia and you will be listening to nothing but non stop Beatles tracks. So be warned if you for some reason hate the Beatles then maybe this isn't the place for you. \n\nOn to the food. The yakitori here is simply amazing. I never knew grilled okra could be so tasty. All the grilled skewered meat and veggies were cooked to perfection. My favorite were the chicken wings and beef. All the ingredients tasted very fresh. I saw bacon wrapped mochi on the menu and I just had to try it because it sounded so ridiculous. Wow was it good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-13", "description": "Halu. A different kind of Japanese restaurant. \n\nThat's what the sign outside says. And, for the most part, that's exactly what it is. It's really refreshing to find a place that doesn't fit the typical mold, decor, feel, design, jeux-ne-se-qouis, etc. of 98% of Japanese restaurants in the US. When you walk into the closet-sized restaurant, you realize two things. First, it's tiny. Since we're talking about Japan, tiny is authentic. Second, it's all about the Beatles. Everywhere, floor to ceiling, the decorations are all Beatles, all the time. Of course, the soundtrack is too. It's a different kind of Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe came here for the ramen. Yelp let myself and my Japanese friend down when it suggested we have the ramen at Izikaya Sozai. That ramen was pretty weak and we felt betrayed. Nonetheless, given that Sozai didn't clear the bar and Nombe is no longer even offering ramen, Halu became our last ray of hope. The ramen here is very typical, and very delicious. All of the tastes are understated. The pork is even and not too fatty. The addition of a little bit of ginger is a simple, nice touch. The noodles were dead-on great. Best ramen in SF? Possibly.\n\nWe also had the chicken kara age and chicken kushikatsu. The kara age was definitely fried well and the portion is pretty good for $7. The kushikatsu was pretty unique in that there were basil leaves intermixed with the chicken under the panko breading. I loved how the basil and chicken worked with the mustard dipping sauce.\n\nAnyways, Halu overall was a great food experience. The only thing holding it back was the service. Their 15-minute waiting estimate would have been about 45 had we not decided to sit at the bar. A couple came in later with a reservation and were told to wait another 20 minutes (always unacceptable). And most egregious was that they charged for \"green\" tea. It's bad enough to charge money. It's inexcusable to not know what kind of tea it actually was once I asked them to specify. That's not ok.\n\nSo, overall you're left with some great food, some terrible service and a different kind of Japanese restaurant.\n\nFair enough.", "author": "Tolga E."}

The Karaage was good, but I didn't like how it was plopped in the soup.  I should have asked for it to be on the side.  What's the point of frying something to be crispy and then dunking it in broth which then kills any crispness?  I thought the broth was OK, but I found that it was overpowered by the spiciness /sourness (my bad for going with this option, I should have chosen non-spicy broth as this was my first bowl of Ramen at this place).  The noodles were the thin style egg noodles.  I liked how the bowl/broth were super hot, but the noodles couldn't stand up to the heat and became soft/mushy.  I didn't really want to finish my bowl at that point.  \n\nMy wife had the shoyu Ramen and it was definitely better than my bowl, but the broth lacked depth and really didn't shine at all.  In addition, the Chasu didn't have much flavor at all.\n\nIn addition to the Ramen, we tried the bacon wrapped scallops and thought they were pretty good.  This is a definite must try.  \n\nIn the end, I rank the ramen at this place at 2.5 stars.  It is MUCH better than the other Ramen Halu in San Jose but not as good as Himawari in San Mateo.

I came here around 10pm on a friday night and was told there'd be about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant is TINY, you could probably only fit about 25 people in there max. After we had ordered, we literally had to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes for the food to come out. The waitress had told us it would be awhile, but i didn't think awhile literally meant a half hour. I'm not sure if the food is worth an hour wait, especially since i was STARVING but it was the best cold soba don i've ever had. Then again, there aren't many japanese restaurants i've been to that had cold soba. The noodles were cooked just right and the sauce combined with the cucumbers and avocado and egg topped it off perfectly. The portions could of been a bit bigger considering it was an entree, but i definitely recommend giving it a try! I also tried a bit of the kara age ramen, and it was SPICY!! so for those of you who are fans of spicy soups, that is definitely a must try as well. \nEven though i'm not a fan of yakitori as i mentioned above, i felt that i needed to try something at least since that is what they are known for, so i got the eggplant stuffed cheese thing. i love love LOVEE eggplants and pretty much anything that has eggplants in it, so i did enjoy it.

Having lived in Japan, we're always on the hunt for \"real\" Japanese food. We definitely found it at Halu! \n\nWe visited this restaurant around 7:45pm on Saturday night. We were seated right away at the bar. \n\nWe shared the Agedashi Tofu, which was just perfect, and an assortment of skewers as follows:\n\nBacon-wrapped asparagus - very tasty.\nAsparagus - good, not amazing.\nGyuu-shiso - delicious, with mild shiso flavor.\nPork jowl - good, a bit rubbery\nBacon-wrapped enoki mushrooms - amazing - our favorite dish!\nTrumpet mushroom kushikatsu - good, not amazing.\nChicken gizzards - he loves 'em (me = not so much).\n\nThe only drawback, and frankly why the restaurant gets three stars instead of four, is that it took more than an hour to get our skewers. The appetizer came in about 20 minutes, which is okay. But then, it was maybe another 45 minutes (or longer) till the skewers came.

It's a small space with an area with a few tables and a counter where 5 people can sit to eat. We sat at the counter and it was totally fine - except it was pretty cold that night so everytime someone opened the door I froze a little. But I didn't mind that much - just keep your jacket on!\n\nWhen you finally sit down and settle in, you start to look around and realize every single item/accessory the restaurant has put up, is some kind of Beatles memorabilia. If you really settle down, you'll also notice that the music played while you dine is some Beatles song or some rendition of it (acoustic, live recorded performance, etc). Pretty cool!\n\nAnyway, here's what was ordered:\n\n*bacon wrapped mochi - you get two skewers with two wrapped mochi on each. SO GOOD - eat while hot.\n*okonomiyaki - definitely the most authentic I've had since visiting Japan. Although I don't prefer the amount of sauce put on it.\n*chicken karaage ramen - it was ok. the chicken was super flavorful, almost a little too salty and also remember to take out the chicken RIGHT AWAY unless you like soggy breaded chicken. The noodles and broth could've been better, but it passed.\n*grilled onigiri - this is definitely the best thing I had here. It's simple. A rice ball with some salmon flakes mixed in, GRILLED. The rice is nice and crunchy - seriously perfection.\n\nI was pretty satisfied with my dining experience here. Just didn't like the 45 minute wait (we went at 8:30pm too!) when it was freezing cold outside.

Even since moving back from Japan, I have been craving some good ramen and was told to go here. \n\nThis place is a total hole in the wall. If you're walking by it you wouldn't even know that it existed, since the windows are all covered up. This place was tiny! Is it really wheelchair accessible?! That aside, when we entered we were immediately greeted with a warm \"irrashaimase.\" Not all cold and monotoned like at those Japanese themed Chinese ran restaurants. \n\nWe came in at around 7pm, it wasn't full and it wasn't completely empty.  As we ate however it began to fill up.\n\nI looked over the menu and decided I didn't want to order any ramen. They put corn in their ramen which I am not a fan of. I have never had corn in my ramen in Japan and I don't think I want to start having any in it. Maybe I will try the ramen another time possibly ask them to not put in corn. \n\nWe decided and ordered the dinner plate of yakitori and kushi katsu, in addition we got the grilled bacon wrapped mochi and a bottle of apple flavored belgium beer. \n\nThe beer was excellent. I usually hate beer but the fruity taste was what drew me to it. \n\nThe edamame and miso soup came out first. What can i say about the edamame? It was edamame, unsalted and to my liking. The miso soup was a bit too salty for my taste. I quite enjoyed the grilled bacon wrapped mochi. It wasn't too salty and not to sticky that it would get stuck in the grooves of your teeth. Was perfect!\n\nThe yakitori and kushi katsu came out beautifully plated. The first thing I tried was the yaki stuffed mushroom. It was so good, not all mushy and rubbery and the taste wasn't overwhelming. So far so good I thought. I then tried the katsu onion. Bleh, it was a thick slice of onion battered and fried. Needed a kick to it. After trying all the items on the yakitori plate and katsu plate, I can say for sure the katsu was bland and only seasoned wit a bit of salt and pepper. The yakitori was inconsistent some were good and some were overly seasoned with salt. Maybe if I had some more beer it would have helped. \n\nThe decor of this place, I am sure a lot of people think its a bit weird with an overkill of Beatles memorabilia. A lot of bars in Japan are randomly decorated usually with whatever the owner has an interest in. If you go to a bar which catered to foreigners it is mostly decorated with foreign music memorabilia,  foreign license plates and knick knacks. The decor was very much like the random shady hole in the wall bars in the backstreets of Japan where the businessmen come to drink and let off some steam after work. So happened a customer was speaking non-stop Japanese to the owner the whole time I was there. I felt very much like I was back in Japan. I loved the feeling!\n\nThis place is definitely an izakaya a place you come for drinking and snacking. Or on a cold night you feel like having some warm ramen in you. \n\nFor a first visit, I mostly enjoyed the atmosphere, great getting to listen to Japanese being spoken and it's great if you want to knock back a couple drinks and snack a bit.", "author": "C L."}

When I'm in the mood for some really good yakatori or ramen, I come to Halu.  I order whatever yakatori sounds good (anything with bacon is great!), a large beer, maybe some ramen and they never disappoint.  And their side salad has that ginger dressing that I can drink.\n\nIt is a very very small place, run by a 4-person family and has only 1 waitress.  So if you come here, be patient.  The wait to be seated might be long, you might have to wait 15 or so minutes before ordering or your food might not arrive very fast.  This is not the place to go if you only have 30 minutes to eat.  Its the place to go when time doesn't matter.  Just sit and enjoy your beer, the Beatles deco and the smells of your food being prepared.  Its all worth it.", "author": "Bianca R."}

I was supposed to meet my friend here, but it was chilly peppers and I didn't want to wait outside, so I went in.  Of course, 8 minutes later I get a phone call from him asking where I was.  He was outside while I was inside.  Luckily, that situation was fixed lickety split.\n\nI was thinking about getting some yakitori, but decided instead to order the Veggie Don.  He ordered the Chashu Ramen and a big bottle of Sapporo.  My Veggie Don was actually really good!  It came with salad, a variety of mushrooms, avocado, and brown rice.  It was a pretty big serving size, but I managed to finish almost the entire thing.  I left a couple leaves from my lettuce and a couple scoops of rice, but it was really good.  I ordered it initially because it sounded healthy, but SCORE because it was also really good.  I'd definitely order it again if I were at Halu.\n\nThe service was great.

I had no idea there was such a gem of a restaurant here! I had lived near the area before and never stumbled in. Such regrets! Anyway, it is a tiny place, but the atmosphere feels very cozy and well established. The cluttered and aging decor added much to its mom+pop charm, Beatles themed, with coordinating music in the background. The food was wonderful! we ordered a chicken karage dish that came with veggies and salad, and a bowl of chashu ramen. everything was served for sharing, which was nice. The veggies were fresh and the ramen was stellar. The best i've had yet. We encountered a small problem with a dish we ordered being forgotten and coming out late, but as we were just on a casual outing and had no where to be, it was not really an issue. The wait staff was super nice about it. My friend and i tried a sake called Drunken Whale, which was super. i can't wait to go back.", "author": "Iliea S."}

It took 25 minutes to get our 2 orders of the Kara Age (fried chicken) ramen ($10 each) and an order of the buttered mochi wrapped in nori (seaweed) ($6.50).\n\nThe mochi was seasoned with a buttery soy sauce, grilled until it's warm and chewy, then wrapped in seaweed before serving. The appetizer is definitely my favorite of the night. The ramen, which consists of corn, ginger, bean sprouts, green onions and uber tender fried chicken, was so thick and rich, a slight film would form on top if you let it sit too long. Kind of gross, but it tasted good. I have an appreciation for hand-made noodles, and I'm almost positive Halu uses packaged noodles, which is disappointing.\n\nOn my next venture to Halu, I'll try the yakatori (skewers). It's supposedly their specialty, but I can't bring myself to pay $5 for 3 tiny little skewers. In the meantime, Halu will remain my close substitute for ramen until my next trip to Hawaii.", "author": "Sam L."}

We both had Koumi Dons which were fabulous.\n\nThe second time I wanted to bring my French friends to this restaurant and we arrived at 9. I know it's unusual in the US to have dinner after 9 (in France we usually eat around 8h30-9h00) so this was a good point that the restaurant close 11pm. \n\nThe bad news was the wait, due to the lack of space (the room is really tinny). I let my phone number to the waitress who told us that she would call me 20min after. 30min later I finally called the restaurant. They apologized, saying that, at this moment no more seats were available and we would have to wait 15 more minutes. Which we did, but again, we didn't hear about them so we call the restaurant and, after showing our beginning of irritation, they told us that a table was available (available = being cleaned).

I know Halu is mostly known for it's yakitori but I swear yelpers were writing their ramen was good. Was it you ask? I had better unfortunately. The broth was bland. It didn't taste like anything. Seriously. If you were to ask me was the broth beef, chicken, pork, or veggie based - I wouldn't be able to tell you. The broth was just brown. Can brown be a flavor? \n\nThe Karaage chicken was good - crispy and full of garlic. The pork was bland unfortunately. I wasn't keen on the portion size.

It just tastes better if it's cooked on a stick and served slightly charred.  Mm.  I'm having a flashback just thinking about this.\n\nIt was Friday night, I had been running around doing errands and trying to do research for this very important thing I'm suppose to write this weekend.  I waited for the 33 bus that took nearly as much time as it would have taken me to walk, but not really so I just stood in the sun and ruined my porcelain complexion.  After the bus deposited me ungracefully in Geary and Arguello, I walked the 8 Richmond blocks (i.e. 1/3 the size of standard city blocks) to Halu with a small detour to the bank.  No credit cards.  CASH ONLY.  \n\nLou and I sat at the counter and he ordered this ridiculously large bottle of distilled barley shochu.  So much for not drinking this weekend.  \n\nOrdering was fun and easy, the choices were exciting and came out quickly.  We tried the bacon scallops, bacon enoki, tontoro (pork belly), shiso beef (best flavor combo ever), salmon (eh, it had some yucky sauce on it), age dashi tofu, and spicy kara age ramen.  I was really really full.  \n\nThe yakitori was good.  I think the salmon could have done without the sauce, and just a sprinkle of salt.  I like shioyaki more than teriyaki.  Bacon enoki was great.  There was this bottle of red powder sprinkle thing.  While the yakitori was already flavorful, the magic red powder made it better somehow.  With magic.  \n\nThe ramen was good but by the time we got to that, my taste buds had been saturated.  I could no longer taste anything.  Woof.  I surrender peacefully. \n\nIt's a little expensive to just drop in for a snack, but that makes it more realistically Japo because the standard of living is really high in Japan and food is really expensive.  The price of a pair of skewers was similar to the price of nigiri at $$ - $$$ places.  The most expensive was tontoro and shiso beef at a whooping $10 for a pair.

Tony and I had the chicken gizzards, the beef tongue, and the enoki bakon yakitori last night. The flavors were great. We topped it off with some chashu ramen, because it was a cool and foggy night in the City, and we needed some noodle soupd to warm us up. The ramen is a-ok, not fantabulous. But, people venture to Halu for their yakitori.\n\nThe service is the reason why it doesn't get higher marks. Sadly, we were neglected. It's a tough call. I think it's family run, and the space is small, so you really cannot hire a lot more people. But it took 10 minutes before we could order, after we seated at the counter. Another 5 before we got our green tea. When our chashu ramen came, we asked for napkins. She said \"yes\" and then forgot. Tony busted out his own napkins. When I finally caught her eye again, she did get the napkins, and that was when she realized she never got napkins for us. She apologized for that.  Our yakitori finally came mid-way through our ramen.. I make a note of this BECAUSE sitting next to me at the counter was a regular. I could tell because he kept telling Shige-san how great the yakitoris were - they kept asking him if he wanted more- and his yakitoris came immediately! He ordered some of the same yakitoris we did, after we did, and he finished his before we even got ours. They even got him extra napkins when he asked.  It took another 10 minutes to get our check. I watched her hug several friends, take several orders. I asked her twice of the check. And the topper? She was doing the math so quickly, that our final bill came to 14.75. But the ramen orders alone should have come to 17.50. We paid the correct amount. If they note the mis-calculation, we gave very little tip. If they dont note the miscalculation, we gave at least a 15 dollar tip.\n\nBut, the food is good. And we live really close by. So we did the honest thing. And we'll probably be back some day, when we are looking to eat some yakitori. But we can't come when wer're starving. The wait is too long.", "author": "Annie Y."}

I am still confounded that I never noticed this Nihongo hole in the wall joint on my bike route to GGPark.  Amazing!  Its door has been openfor at least a year, by the accounting of other Yelpers, at it's spot just off of little Chinatown Clement Street not six blocks from my front door.  One night as I pedalled toward the Park, I peeped its twinkly lights and read the name above the door:  Halu, a different kind of Japanese restaurant.  My first thought was that Halu ramen house in San Jose had just opened a sister shop in SF.  So I rolled up and engaged the first person I spotted waiting in line to get a table.  He informed me, with a slight air of early twenties know it all cendescention that did nothing but betray his beggardly ignorance, that it was neither ramen house nor isakaya, which I had guessed at.  It was yakitori.  San.  \nNeedless to say, excitement instantly welled up in my being, and the image of the yakitori that I had eaten at when I walked out of the train station in Kyoto on my very first trip to Japan popp into my head.  Nostalgic feeling clouded my eyes.  I felt so happy to be smiling at this stranger and his friend, whoever they were.  They must have thought I was a mochi marshmallow.  I hope so.\nEver since that first encounter with Halu, the desire to eat it's provenance and drink it's large hot sake has hovered closely above and beside my belly.  I wanted to stuff its hibacki grilled kabobs into my gaping pie hole yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  Nothing was going to come between me and Halu, a \"different kind of Japanese restaurant.\"  Beatlemania be damned!\nAt last, it happened.  I have Bill Belichek to thank, in point of fact.  My girlfriend Julie and I had a wager on the Patriots v. Colts game, with the prize a meal at Halu.  If Mr. Bill did not opt to go for it on fourth down with 2 minutes left in the game, perhaps Julie's home state Patriots would have held on to their six point lead.  Lo, it was not meant to be.  Halu here I come!\nAnd thankfully, the different kind of hole in the wall did not disappoint this little padawan.  Halu & it's fab five friends greeted me at the door warmly, sending one of two twin sisters to Arishay us and guide us to an open table.\nThe spot is tiny by SF restaurant standards, but quite roomy by hole in the wall standards.  Compared to Tekka Sushi down by the park, it's cavernous.  The color warm yellow comes to mind when one enters.  You see, as noted here, Beatles gear in all corners.  There is also a prominent Jimi Hendrix picture up, as wells a the obiquitous happy cat and cartoony godzilla figurine.  The place is candy for the eyes, true indeed.  I particularly found the wooden branch \"fencing\" along the back wall very pleasing to look at.  Australia came to mind.  \nJulie and I ordered it up O for sure!   Large hot sake, large sapporo for drinks.  For eating, we were all about the pig!   Bacon wrapped enoki, bacon wrapped scallop, bacon wrapped mochi, oyster pork yakitori, as well as shrimp on a stick, and whatnot.  It was all very fattening!  But very good for your soul, too.  Every few years, one must go ape shit on the other white meet, don't you think?  \nWe tried the pizza pancake that yelpers seemed to craze on, but I personally thought it way sub par.  The very best eat of the evening:  butter fried mochi wrapped in seaweed.  Now if you like mochi, seaweed, & butter,  with sauce served up Japanese style, you're gonna absolutely jizz over this one.  Your eyes will roll back in your head , no doubt! \nI'm glad I finally got to eat Halu.  The bill was not exactly a bargain, it was still worth every dollah dollah bill yo!  The service was polite and familial.  After all, this is a spot run by a single family.  If you arrive at dinner time, plan to wait.  One piece of advice:   if it's busy, order everything at oned.

Last night's meal tasted even better than I remember even though I've had most of the same grilled items before. Even without bacon wrapped everything, the meats and vegetables are perfectly seasoned. You can see the \"good salt\" sprinkled on the beautifully presented skewers. When I skewer meat, it's never that pretty... I would never attempt to butterfly a chicken wing. Other delicious grilled items include stuffed mushrooms, shishito peppers (apparently only 1 of 5 are actually hot), and I always forget what those little silver fish that always seem to be pregnant are called. \n\nAnd when the small yakitori items are not enough, we always order a bowl of the chashu ramen. Delicious chewy noodles with piping hot broth. And really what sent me there was Omar's review of their new okonomiyaki (no curry last night). How many places in the bay area actually have this? They were also offering up a stew later that night. I'm sure having such a small kitchen makes it easier for the family to really experiment with the dishes they cook at home. You can easily eat here for $20/person without alcohol. \n\nI'm no music aficionado at all, lazily listening to radio and whatever friends download onto my laptop. But I grew up loving old time Rock 'n Roll, Motown, doo wop, etc. I cry a little inside whenever another member of the Four Tops passes. It must be because I loved watching Dance Party on KOFY when I was like 8 (apparently they're rebroadcasting old episodes!). But Halu gives me that fix that I can't get anywhere else. Last night they were playing the Beatles' early Motown cover songs. And among all the Rock 'n Roll memorabilia, there are little touches of their daughters' influences (girly hearts on the specials board, leopard print menu holder). It really warms my robotic heart to see the whole family involved in the business. I love this place. \n\nBeen listening to this as I wrote my review.

Also, the chef drizzled a ton of mayo on top and was very generous with the seaweed powder so though it lacked the usual protein, the pancake was very yummy.  \n\nBeef tongue yakitori--if you're not squeamish about eating beef tongue, I'd highly recommend this dish.  It had a great chewy texture and was very well seasoned.  \n\nChicken skin yakitori--the skin was lightly salted and grilled to perfection!  Not overly chewy or charred.\n\nFor all the sake lovers out there, Halu has quite an extensive sake selection.  In fact, it carried two different varieties of my favorite sake--Hakkaisan--so thumbs up just for that.", "author": "Sandy W."}

Ramen was average, but I didn't think there was anything special about it. The food took a while to get out from the kitchen. \n\nWhat bugged me the most was that my yaki onigiri was being shown the grand tour of this tiny joint. How could two little grilled rice balls take so long to make? I finished my ramen and was still twiddling my thumbs waiting for it. My plate of yaki onigiri was brought to the table behind me and they said they didn't order it. The owner then walked the plate to the back (by the bathroom) and asked the waitress which table it belonged to. For a second time, the plate was brought back to the same exact table with the owner insisting it was theirs. A couple minutes later the waitress took it from the table and plopped it in front of me.

We quickly walked to the tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant, noticing the Beetles memorabilia everywhere.  Not exactly sure how this relates to Japanese ramen, but cool nonetheless.\n\nI ordered the Karaage ramen (imagine popcorn chicken in ramen).  It was delicious!  Seriously one of the best bowls of Ramen I've ever had.  To quote tonight's episode of How I Met Your Mother, \"This is so good it makes me wanna staple my ass shut.\" Seriously - it was that good. The broth had the perfect amount of flavor, the chicken expertly fried, and the ramen had a very nice level of tenderness.  The portion was definitely filling enough for dinner, but I was definitely glad that I had yakatori as an appetizer.\n\nThe only negative is that the chefs took a bit long to get the food out.

I got the first donburi, which comes with brown rice, fried chicken and a salad. \n\nThe fried chicken was flavored extremely well - it had a salty tang that was anchored by the brown rice, and the dressing on the salad was light and flavorful as well.

If the prices won't upset \"The Tax Man\" and the menu includes \"Piggies\" in a few moist and tender forms, I'd be \"The Fool on the Hill\" to not give it a try. In fact, \"The Two of Us\" had been talking about eating at this place together for a few weeks prior to my stay in San Francheesy. We even invited \"That Boy,\" who gets the shakes if his diet lacks ramen over the course of a week or so despite his introduction to the particular soup not too \"Long Long Long\" ago. The power of hot soup and meat makes even the most diverse of individuals \"Come Together.\"\n\nHowever, we heard absolutely zero songs by the Beatles when we made it to Halu. They were playing an assortment of surf rock arrangements of vaguely familiar songs. I can't be sure whether I'm disappointed by this soundtrack or relieved. I became irrationally fond of the unmanned drum set with a purple cymbal positioned up in a loft.\n\nBut of course, you can't dine on trappings alone. We each ordered different bowls of ramen as well as asparagus-wrapped bacon on skewers. You would expect me to fall head over heels with bacon-wrapped-anything on skewers, but I just fell in like. The bacon grease didn't sap the 'gus of its natural crunch or freshness, so it had that going for it. The flavor just turned out to be more subtle than I expected for a bacon yakitori. That's probably a wise choice, because the ramen portions are hefty and could easily suffice as meals by themselves. I approved of the large amounts of noodles, bamboo shoots, and surprising add-in's (who knew corn in ramen would work out?) in each bowl. Now I suspect my salt tolerance is higher than most others', evidenced by my being raised on spam and Sapporo Ichiban top ramen. But the deeper I got into my char-siu bowl, the more the sodium content cloyed. This might not be so bad if the saltiness enhanced the flavor of the broth, but I found the soup's taste to be, again, kind of light. I'd return for another meal, but I'd want to check out other izakayas first. Definitely not an \"Eight Days a Week\" destination but I hope \"Something\" about it changes my mind.", "author": "Kimberly V."}

Well, they get everything right, EXCEPT the food. I hate to be picky, but this is what Yelp is for right?\n\nFirstly, the Yakitori wasn't cooked on a true Charcoal grill, so you don't get the smokey flavor that is intrinsic to eating grilled meat. Secondly, everything was much to salty and while this is great with beer, it was just a bit too much.\n\nThe Okonomiyaki was decent, but not fluffly enough to really enjoy the batter and ingredients. Ochazuke was quite salty too that I couldn't enjoy the crisp taste of the tea and subtlety of the rice. I really enjoyed the Mountain potato appetizer.

I think we must have gone on an off night.\nI was really excited to finally try Halu after a couple of friends recommended it. I took my 93 year old mom. We went on a Thursday evening. As we were walking up 2 women were leaving. A server came after them and as my mom walks slowly with a cane we heard most of the conversation. The server asked if everything was alright, the women said yes, but they didn't want to stay. The server said \"I know it's crowded, but you can sit at the counter\" (the very tiny too close for comfort counter -as it turned out) or  wait for a table though she couldn't say when one would be free. The women declined. The server asked if she had been rude to them. They assured her that that wasn't the case, but that the counter felt  \"too claustrophobic.\" They left. \nOn that note my mother and I entered the restaurant and another server pointed to the counter area by the door where there were three padded free standing stools and one hard wooden stool that was attached to the bar so couldn't be moved. Even though tricky for mom to maneuver we sat at the counter leaving one padded stool between her and the man seated at the next stool (otherwise they would have literally been touching that's how tight the space is) and the wooded stool on my right. We were given menus. About 10 minutes later a single man came in. The server who had been outside talking with the people that left greeted him and after a minute she asked my mom and I to move to our right so that he could sit down. I was irked, (we hadn't been greeted, nor offered anything to drink, but I moved onto the wooded stool to find it just as uncomfortable as it looked plus it was a couple inches lower than the other stools. I stated that the stool was not comfortable and that I didn't want to move, but the server just looked at me like \"too bad.\" My mom tried to get up to move, but was struggling , but still the server didn't change her mind. That really got me , so I suggested to my mom that we leave and although she/we were hungry and had wanted to try and like Halu, she agreed. We slowly made our way out without a thanks or sorry or please come again. No one came out after us to ask if they'd been rude. I don't know why the sub-standard, uneven treatment. Was it age-ism? We were the oldest people there. Was it racism? No, mom's Japanese and I'm half and the other customers/servers were either White or Asian. Hmm, why????

Freshly prepared food right off the grill--- Nothing is better than hot, a bit burnt yakitori or deep fried skewers with cold sake.\n4. Quality time spent with your guests --- Don't need to scarf down your big plate of food and not speak to each other. Enjoy the time in between dishes and have some more sake.\n5. You will be treated like a family --- Go there a few times, try a Japanese word or two, and you will be welcomed with smiles and remembered next time.\n\nMy husband (American) and I (Japanese) have enjoyed the food and experience at Halu from the first visit. We went without a reservation and did not have to wait to be seated or for our food (Note: went early around 6pm). We love the family helping each other and are happy to have Halu in our neighborhood. We don't like other overpriced \"izakaya\" restaurants in SF that serve yakitori. Minor requests I have for Halu (hence 4 stars) is to turn down the music a little and add more \"gu\" (e.g., veggies, fish cake) to ramen. Make sure to try deep fried stuffed mushrooms and grilled shiso chicken skewer....yum.\n\nCheck out Halu once for yourself. Just remember this is not a fancy big restaurant but a cozy relaxing family-owned place. Enjoy the food over sake and good chat with your friends and families!", "author": "Tomo B."}

Each kushi, no matter what kind of meat or how it's cooked, tastes exactly the same as the kushi before it...and after it.  The only saving grace was the ponzu/mayo sauce which I wish I could swim in.  The deep fried scallops wrapped in bacon were good but I can't eat 10 sticks of those as my meal.  Or I guess I could but something would be missing.  Maybe some grilled ginkos to round out my food pyramid?  No thanks.  The ramen?  Thin broth; slightly soggy noodles; tasteless stewed pork. \n\nMore entertaining than the food was the company.  It started out as dinner with some lady Yelpers but Yelpers are like ants.  Where there is one, there will be many.  Which made for a raucous dinner. \n\nI can't fault Halu for the music.  I would rather hear a Beatles' album replayed over and over than traditional (and annoying) Japanese music.  The classic rock theme and the psychedelic posters reminded me of a Japanese movie where this young Japanese couple travels to the US to find Elvis and play some ro-ku andu ro-ru.  Japanese love the West.  Which makes this decor somehow traditional.", "author": "Shelley H."}

I had planned to go to dinner and then take a stroll to Green Apple because I'm looking for something.  Nice, mellow evening.  It was not to be however.  \n\nI knew this the moment someone walked in with her own big bottle of booze with no label (Thanks, Wakako!).  It could've been moonshine or rubbing alcohol for all I knew but I drank it because there are some people I can't say no to.  I also tried Echigo for the first time.  I realized how good it was when they ran out and we switched to Sapporo.  \n\nOnto the food:  I asked one of my dinner companions what was good since he's written so many reviews of this place, I thought he was an investor.  He said he actually hadn't had much except for some appetizers, all the yakitori, all the kushi katsu, ramen and some rice things.  Ladies and Gentlemen, that accounts for 4/5 of the menu and left out only the salads and a rice dish with no meat.  \n\nIn one night, I managed to sample the entire menu.  My favorites were:  salad with strawberries and avocado (i luv you), okra, chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms, mushroom/salad/avocado/brown rice bowl, chicken karaage and the meatballs.  Looking over my list, I pretty much liked it all except chicken gizzards, especially covered in their jalapeno sauce.  We also got ramen but that came out last and I thought I was going to die.  I need to try it again before I evaluate.\n\nThe service was slow here and there which contributed to the length of dinner but since we were chatting about all kinds of nonsense and I remember the slave labor I provided when my parents had a restaurant, I can't hold it against them.  Plus, our waitress was significantly more pleasant and accomodating throughout than I ever was.  What, it's not like I was going to get fired.\n\nI am still stuffed and the thought of eating again is kind of nauseating but I may have to go back this weekend.  \n\n[Hey, Hamburglar, Wako from Katana-ya came through.

I go in for seconds to try the ramen.\n\nWe get the counter -- very uncomfortable for someone with long legs. We get our menu. Not menus. They only have one available -- this happened my first visit, as well. Place our orders -- well, attempt to. As we're giving the girl our order, customers walk in. She actually stops taking the order, goes and seats them, gives them menus, then returns to start the ordering process again. The delay doesn't really matter. It takes a good thirty minutes for the first dish to arrive: the daikon salad...\n\nThe daikon salad isn't so good. The vinagrette dressing is a bit bland, and the dish itself tastes more like a radish salad -- it's not just sliced Oriental daikon, but Occidental radish as well. The radish is strong, bitter, and a mismatch for the more delicate daikon. Both are called radishes, but they have very different tastes.\n\nMy Ramune-hai (Japanese lime soda with shouchuu) -- not bad. Not bottom of the barrel soju. The tea we ordered? It never arrived -- this almost happened my first visit, as well. (We got tea at the very end of the meal the first time.)\n\nThe chashu shoyu ramen -- the broth was cloudy, a sign that the soup probably boiled over. It also didn't have a strong pork flavor -- not enough bones. The fresh Chinese egg noodles were fine. What bothered me the most was the too-fibrous, hard menma (bamboo shoots) from a can -- the kind you find in Chinese stores in the little tins used for stir fry, and not the ones used for ramen.\n\nTo finish things off, we tried the sake yaki onigiri (grilled salmon rice balls). I've never had an onigiri where the salmon was in little bits spread throughout the rice ball, as opposed to the normal way with salmon in the middle. And I've definitely never had a salmon onigiri with bones in it before... As for the yaki (grilled) part -- it was barely grilled. The rice was barely browned, and there definitely was no crunch to it. Definitely the weakest dish of the night.\n\nYeah, I think 1.5 star average is about right...", "author": "Perci N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-18", "description": "My girlfriend and I just wanted to grab dinner on a weekday and she thought about this ramen place that she heard about. On top of that, we were both feeling like ramen that night. Just a note on parking, it could be challenging since Halu is located near the corner of 8th and Clement. We were just fortunate to find a spot right outside the restaurant. \n\nAlright, on first impression, Halu felt and looks like a hole-in-the-wall establishment. Despite the \"rundown\" look and tight interior space, Beatles fans will appreciate the many novelties ranging from posters of the British rock band to the choice of Beatles music over the speakers. Several other interesting decorations also include a giant poster of Jimi Hendrix and The Who. They even have a left-handed stratocaster hanging next to the Hendrix poster. One might have their attention divided between the menu and the posters just as I was distracted myself.\n\nNow on with the food! Four selections were made and it is as follows: Shrimp and Steak Yakitori, Cha Shu Ramen and Onomiyaki. The Shrimp Yakitori was simply shrimp tempura on a skewer. Only thing was that the shrimp wasn't all that big, but it was tasty. It came with a dish with a horseradish based sauce and some other sauce, which I can't remember because the horseradish was awesome. The Steak Yakitori was much much better than the shrimp. Very juicy and tender plus it was the perfect mate for the horseradish! The only problem was the portions. Not very big nor cheap. Regardless of that, it was amazing.\n\nI tried a little bit of the ramen (girlfriend ordered it) and it wasn't too bad. The ramen was at the right amount of chewiness and had a good bounce to it. The broth was flavorful. Portions wise, it fared better than the yakitori, but that's rather an unfair observation since ramen is more entre\u00e9 than appetizer.\n\nYes, I ordered the Onomiyaki despite my ramen lust. It's just a matter of fact that onomiyaki doesn't come by as often as ramen does, so why pass a chance to have something different? My Onomiyaki was satisfying. Simple dish with the usual stuff, drizzled with a sweet and salty sauce, that I can't put a name with, and mayo. Only thing is that they could go easy on the sauce. First bite is great until the sauce catches up with you and after that the saltiness can be overwhelming.\n\nOverall, Halu is good, but thanks to my Americanized bias on Japanese food as big and deep-fried, my appreciation for Halu goes as far as I can to try and savor the flavor rather than to stuff myself silly with ridiculous portions. Regardless, Halu has my vote for fresh and flavorful Japanese food.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

It was tasty. The green tea was possibly the best I've had. The miso soup was a little salty, but still good.\n\nWe came in here on a Friday night and as predicted, it was packed. We had to sit at the bar at first - however, the staff was kind enough to let us take a table when there was some room. Be prepared to wait.

My favorite place for ramen when I was back in Japan was a tiny ramen shop near my university. The small ramen shop atmosphere cannot be beat. They always have some sort of quirky decoration scheme going on, the intimate atmosphere lets you get to talk with the ramen cooks, and you're always jockeying for space in the tiny room.\n\nSo when I first came here, I was immediately deluged with memories of that small place in Japan. Of course, it didn't have as much of a musical theme as this place, but it had Japanese wait staff, giving that much more of an authentic edge.\n\nBut yeah, the food. Despite the long wait (a very strangely long wait for a small place) I was not disappointed with the ramen that came out. I still give a slight edge to my favorite, Tanpopo, but Halu is definitely up there, a hidden gem in the RIchmond. And it does have something Tanpopo does not have, a good selection of grilled items. I'm always down for a good piece of grilled chicken, and they did it well here. It's a bit pricey, but it's a good alternative to gyoza as a ramen side dish every now and then.", "author": "Roland C."}

Unfortunately, some of these places, well some have gone and some remain.  Let It Be.\n\nHalu is a very good place not only for the food, but also because it's one of those cozy places you can bring a gaggle of people and have a grand old time.  It's a little short on the beer and sake selection for an Izakaya, but you'll get by With A Little Help From [your] Friends.\n\nOn this day, my Better Half and the Little Man accompanied me.  We were given three seats in a row at the bar.  We did have to wait what seemed like a Long, Long, Long time, but it really was just a few minutes.  The restaurant was packed that day, so the delay can be forgiven.  The waitress and everyone there was very friendly and kind, and all in all, the atmosphere is like a Yellow Submarine.\n\nWife and I ordered the Charsu-men.  Ah, the little Piggies who gave us their succulent souls to accompany our noodles.  Nice, fatty pork might be the best food in the world, but mix that with noodles, and it's heaven.  The broth was very flavorful, thick and rich, the noodles had an excellent consistency albeit slightly soft (preference really).\n\nMay be even better than the ramen though was the yakitori.  We ordered the Chicken Hearts, Flat Iron Steak, Short Ribs and Chicken Thighs.  All were very good.  It was a lot of food, and I Should Have Known Better, but never do.  We finished it off.  The Little Man was amazing.  He scarfed down that food like it was water.  There's definitely Something in the way the little dude can put it down.\n\nAll in all, it's one of the places I would love to go after a Hard Day's Night of work.  Grab a beer, a sake and order up some food with your friends.  In a lot of ways, it reminds me of my college days, I remember that like Yesterday, hanging out, having a good time, enjoying good food and good drink in a cozy atmosphere.  Three cheers for (or rather, four cheers) for Halu.

I went here 2 times already and at first I thought it was a fluke, when I went the second time I ordered a bunch of sticks, enough for 2 people!! \n\nAnyway the first few sticks were great, the gizzard was cooked to perfection and so was the short rib. However mid-way though the meal BAM! a super salty beef tongue. I love salty foods and I do use a lot of salt, but even for me this was too much, it was barely edible. the other sticks were good but after a such a salty stick, my palate was kind of jarred. then came the bacon covered scallops. again, way too salty and the bacon overpowered the scallop. \n\noverall i liked about 70% of the food served to me, but for the prices you pay (I paid close to $50 for 1 person), having 30% of your meal almost inedible due to saltiness is not a good thing. sadly I do not think I will be coming back for a third visit.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

Turns out, my friend and I were the only two dining on a Tuesday night.   As a result, the waitress poured us an enormous amount of attention and care.  \n\nDespite her good will and eagerness to please new customers (it is still a \"grand opening\" restaurant afterall) by explaining extensively the different dishes and her recommendations, we ordered two simple ramen noodles.   My friend had the basic ramen, and I had the cold ramen. \n\nThe taste is on.  Often cold ramen has this tang that is superb when you are eating but leaves a pungent aftertaste in your mouth once you are done.  But in this case, the taste is rich but mild, great for a hot summer day.  \n\nThe only thing that was weird to me was the salad in the cold noodles.  I simply don't like lettuce unless it's in a regular salad, so to see leaves perching on top of the noodles just makes me want to put them aside and pretend they never existed.  \n\nMy friend had a good time with her ramen.  She cleaned the bowl. \n\nLucky us also got a free appetizer: grilled chicken and mushroom.  Tasty, a bit greasy, I imagine them being perfect bar food to go along with sake or something. \n\nBill was very reasonable, $7.50 for a bowl of ramen.  We took our time and sat around and chatted.  I almost felt bad when the waitress asked if we wanted some tea---it seems like she is doing an awful lot of work for our pathetic $20 dinner.  \n\nBut, I am sure business will pick up---ramen on 8th and Clement?  Seems like a good business idea.  And I will be happy blending in with average diners slurping noodles--no special treatment.", "author": "Candice B."}

How could a restaurant possibly make you feel these things? I couldn't decide if it was the food, the beatles blasting through the speakers, or maybe just the other people in the restaurant. In the end it's probably useless to try and disentangle all the stimuli, so I'm just going ahead with the facts. Fact: I've now been here twice and decided that it's my new favorite local - no, scratch that - all time favorite japanese place. Fact: this place is small and easy to miss, and I've been walking by it forever, so thank you yelp(ers) for helping me find things in my neighborhood.  \n\nFood Picks: Okonomiyaki is nice and thin. Slightly crispy on the outside giving way to soft innards. Good ratio of batter to vegetables and other stuff. The chef likes his worchestershire and mayo, so if you like things light like me, better ask em to take it easy with the sauces. \n\nVegi-Don with slices of avocado and brown rice (among other vegetables). This isn't for the same person who's ordering the deluxe yakitori dinner package, and it isn't meant to be, but it's very good in its own right. \n\nChicken gizzard yakitori. I'm not entirely sure what a gizzard is, but it sure tastes good when prepared on their grill. Its got a texture similar to liver, but with a little more bite, and possibly more gamey. \n\nDrink Pick: Echigo. It's like Singapore's Tiger beer, but a bit less hoppy and a little more sweet.

It was flavorful - I saw other skewers that I wanted to try but didn't get to, like the asparagus wrapped in bacon, so that just means I'll have to come back!\n\nI'm curious about the ramen, but I'm going to have to get through all the yakitori before I get to that.  The only thing I didn't like was the miso -- it was too salty for me - I'm not sure if it was supposed to be like that.  They put onions in it, and I appreciated that.\n\nI liked their extensive drink list --- I kind of would like to just come back for drinks at some point.  I had  a Shochu cocktail...and I really, really liked it.  They even had Ramune cocktails!!!  (the Japenese bottled drink that is sealed with a marble)  They had barley, potato, and sake alcohol\n\nI loved the Beatles theme, including the Beatles drumset above, the Japanese Beatles posters, and the guitars on the wall.

Halu, though, lets its food do the talking while it fufills its fetish for Beatles, Hendrix and other 60's rock icons. It's like \"Hell yeah, we're Japanese, we don't need to write it on our foreheads.\" So points for that.\n\nMore importantly, the food is awesome. Love the skewers, though i always peak with the pork ramen (spicy-version requested). Very tasty and hearty.\n\nService is also great and I love the cozy atmosphere, though hereinlies Halu's one fault. The place is so tiny getting a seat can be a challenge, and even if you do, you'll often find yourself shivering in the seats by the door. They really need to invest in some sort of double-glazed, insulated door cause even when its closed you can definitely feel the Richmond Chill creeping in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-19", "description": "This ramen joint is tiny and narrow with so much Beatles and classic rock memorabilia on the walls making it seem even more claustrophobic.  I ordered a vegetable ramen bowl for $13.50, which is pretty expensive for noodle soup with no meat, and it ended up taking almost half hour to get there.  For a ramen place, they should have all broths ready to go and noodles should only taken a few minutes to heat up.  Half hour is way too long for noodle soup.  Typical Chinese restaurants can get you a bowl of noodle soup within five minutes of ordering.  And I know you might be thinking that you can't compare Japanese ramen to Chinese noodle soups but I gotta let you know that ramen is actually originally Chinese food.  Noodle soups are supposed to be fast and cheap food.  I know we're knee deep in a ramen craze these days but high prices and long waits shouldn't be the norm.  Keep the prices more reasonable and hire more people in the kitchen and you'll get customers in and out quick and the restaurant won't be as cramped and crowded.  It's definitely doable but Halu isn't there.  Oh yeah, and we ordered hot tea when we first got there and they didn't give it to us until AFTER we got the ramen so it took longer than half hour to get hot tea.  And they charged us $2.75 for the tea.  It should be FREE NINETY NINE.", "author": "Law C."}

So began our hunt on Yelp for a decent ramen house in our new neighborhood. \n\nFirst off, I'm not going to let my own personal disliking of the Beatles hinder my experience at this place because my first impression from walking into this place is that they must really love the Beatles. The walls are covered with Beatles memorabilia along with a Beatles movie playing in the background. There were a few pics of Hendrix and other similar era artists as well but the Beatles were the obvious house favorites. \n\nThis place is quite small inside and would be unbearable if it was played out like most hip restaurants in this city. The staff were very kind and hospitable and it looked like a small family run business. \n\nNow the food. We started off with the shiitake mushroom skewers that were very good and full of flavor. I would (and have) ordered again. I ordered the \"spicy kara age ramen\" which contains a few vegetables and little fried chicken pieces and my wife ordered the \"spicy vegetable ramen\". It took about 15 minutes for our food so I'd recommend ordering a libation or two in between. The ramen came out piping hot and we both fell in love from the first slurp of their broth. YUM!!! The noodles were cooked perfect and the spices were evident. When my wife asked for a little extra spice the cook (which was the owner) came out to our table and actually mixed the spices into my wife's soup for her.\n\nI hear that ramen is not their specialty so if their other dishes are anything close to as flavorful as their ramen then I could see this place becoming very popular in the years to come.", "author": "Kevin C."}

The customer service we had tonight was one of the worst that we've experienced in a long time -- that's saying a lot because we eat at a lot of Chinese restaurants. \n\nWe thought we'd go to one of our local Japanese restaurants for a causal Friday night dinner.  We arrived and were immediately seated, which, unfortunately, was the highlight of our evening.   \n\nAfter we were seated, it took a few minutes longer than expected to take our order, but that was expected since there was only 2 wait staff for the small restaurant.  We've eaten here several times before and recognize the kitchen can be a little slow on Friday and Saturday nights.  That being said, what we experienced was unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWe order the agadashi tofu, chashu ramen and karage donburi -- something very simple, we thought. After 50 minutes, and watching several people who were seated after us receive their meals, we asked the waitress why our meals were taking so long.  Her response: \"we're not a ramen house.\"  WTF?!?!?!?  It's Japanese restaurant that doesn't serve sushi and only has a limited number of entree options, and nearly half of those are ramen.  So, if you're not a ramen house, then why is it on the menu???  \n\nSo, after another 10 minutes the donburi shows up, but no tofu or ramen to be seen.  It takes an additional 5 minutes for the tofu to arrive.  We ask again how much longer before the ramen comes out and the waitress says it'll be soon.  We start with the tofu, but after waiting ANOTHER 5 minutes, we decide to split the donburi because it's getting cold.  We finish the tofu and about 2/3 of the donburi before the ramen finally shows up.\n\nAfter nearly 80 minutes, the ramen shows up and it's not even hot.  The broth and egg were salty beyond belief.  We received a half-hearted apology about the wait time and felt rushed to finish our meal, so they could turn the table.  \n\nWe should have walked out after 40 minutes.

Mostly Beatles paraphanelia, and whether you like them or not (who doesn't?) it gives the place a real unique homey comfortable feeling. The only thing is the place is rather small, you probably can't come here with a party of more than 4 people. Right as you enter, there's a counter to the right facing the chef making his yakitori. A couple two-seater tables to the left, and there were maybe 4-5 4seater tables in the back, and that was about it. \n\nWe mainly came here for the yakitori. Usually when people think \"Japanese\" they think sushi, ramen or izakaya style so it's pretty damn hard to find a good yakitori place in the US. We're both Japanese, which makes us a bit spoiled, so when we go out to eat Japanese, it better be f*ckin good, and Halu was just that.  \n\nFirst off, we went there with no reservation, I think it was a weekend night, so there were a couple groups lined up before us. No problem though, we left our name and phone number with the waitress and walked around a bit, within 15 or so minutes she called us and we were seated. Originally we were seated at the counter, which was cool, but before out food arrived, when a table for two opened up the waitress was nice enough to move us to that seat. Overall I would like to give the waitress a 5 star because she was really nice and accommodating the whole meal. Constantly giving us suggestions, seeing how we were doing, etc.\n\nFinally, the food, like I said before we came here exclusively for the yakitori. We started off with some of the standard yakitori menu items, I think we ordered a kushi-katsu or two? They come two skewers on one plate (or you can just get one skewer, just have to ask). Every dish was amazing. When the dishes arrived, the waitress explained which dish was which, which I thought was nice because a lot of restaurants just give you the food and leave it up to you to figure what is what. After we were done with the original order, we noticed their special menu on the wall and ordered a few from there. Everything was delicious. I think we ordered a total of ~10 dishes? with alcoholic drinks, came out to over $100. I wanna say each yakitori dish (with 2 skewers) was around $6-7, which I guess is not too bad.

Then came my drink, which was a Guava Shochu. It was definitely Guava, but I wasn't sure how much Shochu was in there, and finally our Chicken Karaage before the main attraction. The batter on it was light, and it wasn't the super deep fried Karaage, it was the nice and golden kind. I actually liked this style more because the chicken was actually tender and juicy.  \n\nThe ramen took a little longer than we thought, but it came to us hot! At first, the soup base tasted a bit on the saltier side, but after sipping more and more of it, the soup just started to settle in. The soup was a little bit more on the heavy side, but I thought that was fine. They must use a nice pork broth, because I saw bits of fat and oil floating around everywhere. The noodles weren't too soft as well, which is what I love about ramen houses! I ordered the Chasu ramen, and was surprised to see corn in there. I love corn (and no, not just because I'm corny either)!  I enjoyed the Chashu slices as well. They were nicely cut pieces that were extremely tender. \n\nOver all, I thought it was a decent meal, but I'm giving it a 3 star because I thought it was overly hyped.

I thought the ramen was great.  The flavor packed a punch and the noodles tasted just right.\n\nWhy doesn't that deserve a 4 star?  The food definitely gets it, but the service was a different story.  There was one other party there when we arrived when my friends and I came.  We were seated promptly but only given one menu.  That wasn't too bad because it didn't take us very long to find out what we wanted.  We all placed our order in.  15-20 min. later two bowls came out for me and a friend.  The waitress told us they ran out of hot water so the other two bowls will be another 10 min.  That was sad.  I didn't want to start eating before my friends got their food but she said, and I quote \"it will taste nasty if you wait.\"  I wasn't going to wait after that.  It could have just been that one day I went, and I'll definitely go there to eat again, but the service was just too slow..", "author": "Tom Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-25", "description": "While San Mateo will probably remain the hot-hub of Ramen in the Bay Area, Halu provides San Francisco with one of the better Ramen dining experiences.  I've been eating at Halu for 5 or 6 years and recently, they really managed to trim down the fat/oil of their broth.  They must really have listened to customer feedback which is very encouraging.  The broth is both lighter and more enjoyable to drink.  If you go to a ramen place and no one is drinking the broth down to the last drop, they are probably doing something wrong.  They also have a pretty good Japanese beer selection and they do really good grilled meat sticks.  They can definitely get pricy as the meat sticks aren't terribly filling and when you order a bunch, the price really starts adding up rather quickly so buyer beware.  Make sure you order yourself some form of filler or you may feel like you didn't get good value out of your meal.  The bacon wrapped mochi is tasty (but not very filling).  I also like the shitake mushrooms but again, for what you are getting, it's really up to you if you are ok paying the cost of these dishes.  Service is pretty good.  Sometimes they are short staffed and things get backed up (FYI, 2 waitresses would be the standard number you'd want to see for things to move smoothly).  There can and almost always is a wait in line to get seated but they conveniently take your cell number and call you over so you can kind of relax while you wait.  3.5 stars.  Nice Beatles decor and good drunk food as well.", "author": "Nat L."}

Specials are listed on the white boards on the wall with collected pictures of some special rock and roll stars! Oh my goodness! So many items to choose from! Here's the list of items that I remember, but I know we ordered more. We had the gizzards, chicken hearts, beef and asparagus, ribeye,cow tongue, pork jowl, bacon wrapped scallops, bacon wrapped mochi, and chicken skin. Once we got the items, we just engulfed it. The items were so delicate and tasty that all I can do is wait in anticipation for the next plate to come out. My favorites were the bacon wrapped mochi, bacon wrapped scallops, and chicken skin. Oh wow! The mochi was warm with the bacon. It makes me reminisce of being in Hawaii eating mochi, cheese, and nori. Yum! Generally, chicken skin is just very fatty, but sooo good. Why not on a stick? Maybe some seaweed or nori to go with it? Oh, wow! The okra looks good! Maybe, next time we'll order that! Hmmm...so many possibilities! Also, I love the Hakkai-san sake! It was so crisp and clean!

My friends wanted to have double orders of chicken skins, hearts, gizzards, thighs, and pork/onions...some were good to great. Sandy M. tried the char-siu ramen which was okay, although the portions were huge. I liked Izakaya Sozai's ramen better. We definitely had to try the seafood okonomiyaki, which I heard was done in Yokohama style. It was flatter than I'm used to but the edges were crispy and delicious. I would have added corn and caramelized onions to flesh out the flavors more. John M. ordered the chicken donburi with salad...we girls loved the salad...bitter greens and not a lot of crappy iceberg cabbage...that's what we like! The rice is brown rice and it's healthier...I kept thinking, take that Uncle Ben (haha).\n\nUnfortunately they haven't developed a dessert menu beyond ice cream, so that's something they will have to work on in the future...as for the peeps...\nWe were outnumbered by the okasans and obasans that kept the place hopping.

We came in about 6:30 pm on a weeknight after finding parking a 1/2 block away. We scored the last table for four (there were three of us) and quickly got our menus. Following Euge's game plan, we ordered a few yakitori (scallops and chicken) to share and individual bowls of ramen. Seeing the specials on the wall, I ordered the spicy Cha Siu Ramen. For a typical cool SF evening, this was perfect to get my blood flowing again. The sniffles from the heat were testament to the spiciness. Between dishes, I couldn't help but notice how the atmosphere was like a time machine. My brother is a HUGE Beatle fan and would have loved to see the various postings on their walls. The background music was .... what else, Beatle music. The ramen ran $7.00 to $9.00 per bowl while the appetizers were in the $5.00 to $9.00 range. 3.5 stars for the food, 1 star for the atmosphere, minus 0.5 star for slightly slow and inattentive service (hopefully, chalk it up as a bad night for her).

It's pretty tiny, but somehow I never feel super cramped or wanting for more space. You can still have a conversation without having to yell, but it's not so quiet that you'd feel super awkward for laughing hella loudly at a joke your friend made. Servers are nice and the Beatles memorabilia on the walls are cool too. Drinks are great as well! I usually get an Asahi or Sapporo now, but during my first time here I tried their Calpico shochu drink. I've drank Calpico since I was kid so trying a more \"mature\" variation was a trip- a very good one. Beer has ended up to be a better fit with the skewers for me, but Calpico shochu would be a fine alternate.\n\nOn to the food! All the skewers I've had are above average but the two standouts for me were the beef tongue and the bacon wrapped scallops skewers. Halu cemented my love for beef tongue. It was tender and juicy and well seasoned. And anything wrapped in bacon is bound to be delicious but the combo of scallops makes it amazing. The scallops kinda just melt in your mouth. Definitely on the salty side so be prepared to drink often. And the ramen. I've tried both the chashu-men and the butter corn ramen. First, the ramen is a little pricey, but the portions they serve are pretty big. The chashu-men's broth is way different that those at Santa or Hakata. The noodles are a little thin but are cooked perfectly, and the chashu is not skimped on. My favorite has to be the butter corn ramen though. With a pretty sizable piece of butter and corn sprinkled in the broth, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the soup wasn't too heavy or too salty, but just right. Noodles were cooked well, not too soggy. It was one of the better ramen I've had since I left Los Angeles. \n\nIn short, I love Halu, and I can't wait to go back again!", "author": "Amanda K."}

I've had Halu bookmarked forever so we decided to give it a try. \n\nGot to Halu at 730pm on Saturday night. There was two couples in front us along with a group of teeny boppers (7 of them)... so I was thinking the wait would be be horrendous but it was like 20 min. Not bad. \n\nWe were seated at the counter and quickly checked the board for the specials of the day. Bf got the Lava Ramen and I chose the Spicy karage ramen plus the shisho beef and shishito peppers and a beer to share. Our order was taken quickly and our beer was brought out quickly. When we sat down we noticed the first couple that was seated before us didn't have their food. Okay so that's about 30 min later...hmm... *thinking* I hope this doesn't take forever... \n\nSo about 20 min into our wait...we're enjoying the Beatles music and all the cutesy decorations...40 min into our wait we're staring at each other and order another beer...55 min into our wait... our friends call us wondering where we are... 60 min after ordering...OMG food arrives!!! Our shisho beef and shishito peppers came!!! YAAY! Food. Now mind you we are starving so we inhaled the yakitori. I had hoped the beef would be dripping with gold of some sort or be a huge portion but no, it was 2 little skewers.... I ate mine in two bites (yes I know not very lady like but i was starving) and it was above average. I would have liked it if it was cooked med rare rather than well done. I did enjoy the shishito peppers. I ate all of them in one swoop. So this is one hour of sitting at the counter...tick tock..where is our ramen? We noticed once we got our yakitori everyone around us (people that had come in later and ordered after us) all got their yakitori orders as well... huuuh waat..? Then suddenly our ramen arrives!!!\n\nMy ramen was spicy and delicious! It came with 4 pieces of chicken and I loved that the spicy didn't mean a huge oil puddle of spicy chili oil. I immediately dove into the ramen and didn't look back! My ramen's spicy color was indeed more red than the bf's lava ramen. We both finished our ramen in record setting time and then paid and left. Eating at Halu took about 2 hours of our lives. The ramen was GOOD..the yakitori ... hmm... i'll have to come back and give it a re-try.

You just wait outside in a line....\n-We had 2 beers and some yakitori and ramen and we weren't \"stuffed\"..portion size for ramen on the smaller side\n\nEven though I wasted a bunch of time here, I think the ramen saved them from a 3 or 2 star review. Our waitress was pretty attentive and nice as well.", "author": "Julie F."}

It's not too wild or extravagant like so many \"HEY, WE'RE A REALLY NICE AND AUTHENTIC YET HIP JAPANESE RESTAURANT!!\"-type places out there. It's small, simple, laid back and there are lots of Beatles artwork on the walls. \n\nOur waitress seemed really busy and a bit rushed. After we placed our orders, I must say it took quite a while for our ramen bowls to get out. Halu isn't a very big place, so why would it take so long to cook up some ramen? It's really a pretty simple thing to make.\n\nRegardless, the ramen wasn't bad. I ordered the Chicken Kara Age Ramen and while it wasn't anything spectacular, it was pretty good. 8 bucks is an acceptable price for what I got, and I'll have to come back another time to find out how I really feel about this place.", "author": "Edmund C."}

Beatles music played on speakers and the smell of meat wafted through the air.  We ordered a bottle of Sake and it was terrific.  We placed our appetizer orders, pan-fried mochi in nori and a japanese pizza.  Before they had arrived we were reseated - as was promised - at a table and we were served.  Both dishes were very good and very unusual for me and I loved them both a lot.  We then ordered Ramen and several of the Yakitori skewers: Pork jowl, oyster chicken, Shishito peppers and enoki chicken.  Each of them were excellent.  The enoki chicken was wrapped in bacon with the enoki mushrooms inserted into the chicken making the dish look somewhat like a small octopus.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-13", "description": "Halu is located on 8th Ave. between Geary and Clement, in the midst of New China Town. \n\nFirst thing you'd notice is how they spell the name of this restaurant differently from the dictionary notation. (Halu, instead of Haru. ) As some of you already knew, there's no Rs in the Japanese language, and what's spelled as \"R\" is actually pronounced as \"L\" (reasonably close sound, if not exact). The owner is aware of the issue and wrote out the name according to the correct sound. Cool enough,,,though it's a trifling matter. \n\nWhen you enter the place, you may start wondering \"how come there's no Chinese people dining here despite the location?\". When you don't see many local people in a restaurant, that's usually a bad sign. \n\nOne of the following should explain why few Chinese people go to Halu. \n\n1. Food isn't up to par. \n2. Something in the restaurant repels them. \n3. Expensive \n4. All of above \n\nIMO, the answer is 2. I think it's the British music being played there all the time that turns Chinese people down at the gate. Mr Lee forfeits and never gets to the 2nd floor to meet Dan Inosanto or a Korean Hapkido Master. Game over. \n\nWhile I was having my dinner, they made me listen to 2 Beatles album (Please Please Me, and A Hard Day's Night) at medium volume. It did not bother me because I love Beatles as well as Jimi Hendrix and Pete Townshend that were found in the posters on their wall. The middle aged owner of Halu obviously like those classic anglo-american rock music from 60's and so do I (#1). However, the average Chinese people will probably find it otherwise unless they grew up in America or Japan or developed openness to the cultural diversity. This place may not be for the family-oriented people. \n\nOK, I wrote enough about them being an unusual Asian eatery in the Chinese neighbourhood. The rest of my review will be on food and service. \n\nI had several kinds of Yakitori (grilled poultry meat usually skewed w/wo onions) and kara-age (deep-fried chicken thigh). They are cooked properly and they taste OK except beef skews that weren't too fresh. Like any after-5 food should be, they are good to drink with. I personally prefer a charcoal grill (#2) because of the smokey flavor it creates, but I'll cry instead. \n\nMy server was a Japanese speaking young girl who might not be the most attentive one, but I thought she was nice and her Americanized character and attitude fit very well in the international atmosphere. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone who likes small, cozy oriental restaurants that aren't crowed with homogeneous Asian faces. \n\n\n(#1) Japan has some of the geekiest fab-4 maniacs in the world, and that's one of the cool things about Japan that isn't the same in the other Asian countries.\n\n(#2) Cooking Area is pretty much covered up, but I'm sure they don't use chacoal to grill meats.", "author": "yota L."}

That is exactly what my wife and I had to deal with this past weekend.

This is the kind of spot I think I would love to visit if I ever made my way to Japan.  Good Ramen, tasty yakatori and beer to knock down while you are at it.  \n\nOn my first visit here, all I tried was their Ramen but I think this would be a really cool place to just chill with friends, drink beer and eat some yakitori skewers.  Not sure how late they stay open though.  But if they did open late, it would be a great night out.  \n\nThe broth for the Ramen had just the right consistency.  Very tasty.  We had the Lava one, which they advertise as very spicy, seriously!  And I would tend to agree with them.  I can usually eat very spicy and I would say this broth was on the high side of the spectrum.  We also had the Chasu Ramen.  I really liked the taste and tenderness of the meat.  It reminded me of some places in the Chinese cuisine that make really tender beef stew.  The only thing is, I wish they gave a little more meat and even a little more noodles.  Maybe it tasted so good I wanted more.  Or maybe because these bowls of noodles were on the pricier side of what I like to pay for noodle soups.  The Lava one was $9 and the Chasu was $8.75.  I know Good Quality Ramen places are a little trendy right now and popular but hopefully, when even more places open up, competition will set in and prices will have to drop a bit.  \n \nI will say I now prefer Halu to Genki, which is a few blocks away.  Genki is still okay but I do feel like they were a lot better the first couple times I tried them.   \n\nThe only other drawback was the wait.  They were a little busy on a Saturday evening prime time for dinner but I would think if you go eat at a noodle house, you are wanting or expecting quick service.  Some of my friends have told me in Japan, when you go to Ramen houses, the service is quick.  You order, the food comes out quickly and you are done.  They told me that the places are small so they want you to get in and out so they can maximize their business.  \n\nBut I guess since this place is also a Yakitori and beer kind of place, that's the kind of place you don't mind service to be slow.  More or less, you are kicking back with friends when you are eating like that.  \n\nI definitely have to try that experience here at Halu sometime.

Just think of the long list of great restaurants that started off as hole in the walls, mom and pap places, and neighborhood favorties.  In SF, Slanted Door and Delfina in the MIssion, how about Boulevard, owner originally was the chef of an Irish bar in the Richmond just to name of few.  But many great chefs and owners move on to bigger and better things. I'm all about the sweet spot, the time when these restaurants peak.  RIght before they make it big and have to mass produce their food.  When their kitchen and staff is still small enough for the head chef to control and put their personal touch to the preparation of the food.  \nThe atmosphere:\nSumi is a new hole in the wall restaurant.  I remember previously there was a not so great restaurant at this location, but the owners have done a great job with this little space.  Who can deny Japanese food (this is a yakitori place) and the Beattles theme?  It's such a fun combination, being half Japo, my parents generation would appreciate the theme.  There was a family there with 2 young boys and I could just imagine when they grow up reminiscing about the yakitori restaurant there parents used to take them to as children that used to rock the Beattles.  So its great for the older gen and kids.\nThe food:\nI had the yakitori dinner, which comes with edamame, miso and rice, fyi they have brown rice.  The yt dinner was an assortment of chicken, beef, mushrooms, and shrimp.  The chicken was by far the most tastiest of the assortmnent mmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!  \nService was great, as the waitress continually did the check in and asked how the food was, of which the chef could probably hear due to the tinyness of the space.", "author": "Aaron I."}

We did get the chicken wings (2 skewers, 2 wings on each)and the bacon wrapped scallop (2 skewers, 2 scallops on each) with two big sapporos.  Any place who serves bacon wrapped scallops holds a special place in my heart, specially the ones who grill it over charcoal.  It was satisfying, but not filling, so we each ordered ramen as well.\nThe chasu ramen was good, not great like katana-ya, but decent.  It had a rich broth that was made with tender loving care by the rocker chef.  It had layers of flavor that lets you know he didn't just open up a package of MSG and powdered broth and mixed it in water.  The noodles on the other hand were definitely not great quality. It was a little too soft for me. It didn't have that same bite as house made noodles like katana-ya, but of course ramen is not their specialty. I'd definitely order it again.\nThe service was not bad when I went. I know the other reviews mentioned that they were forgetful.  I can definitely see that happening.

Service slow.\n\nWait is horrible and seating seems disorderly:\nWalked in - 2 of us.  There was an empty table, waitress says there's 1 party ahead of us - 10-15mins wait (not bad..but this was about 9:45pm).  Noone else was waiting though, probably on the phone list/resos?  10mins later, a party of 2 comes in, and another waitress asks them \"how many?\" and they say 2, and then seats them in that empty table.  We stood in the corner like... What?!  Okay..maybe they were that party and the waitress knew?  Another party comes in 10mins later and asks for the wait and gets seated before we do.  I told that waitress - we were here before these guys.  She picks up the \"waitlists\" and points to the top of the list where all the names were crossed off, and said they were here first. Bullshit. Because, those guys also knew we were there first, and actually stepped outside.  Pretty much left after that (the 20mins of waiting and looking at the menu and prices also made us realize it wasn't worth it).\n\nDisclaimer - I've been here once before.  Same thing happened.  But, the previous time, we actually benefited and cut a couple of other people because that same waitress is just clueless.  I guess - das is karma.\n\nCute, friendly girl.

Yes, they are a Japanese family. No big deal you may say.

I've been here a jillion times since that incident and haven't had any others.  I think I'm safe.  Plus, I still don't eat pork so I ultimately don't care if they have it or not.  I've had a few different things now so my review can expand.  Most items are winners.  Karaage ramen=awesome.  Even my pork eating boyfriend prefers it after trying the chashumen.  This is not to say it's bad.  Just that it's not as strong.  Yakitori was good but not enough to order it over ramen if you have to choose.  Yakionigiri=awesome.  I don't have anything to compare it to since I've never ordered it elsewhere but if it tastes anywhere near as good as Halu's I'll order it everywhere every chance I get.  Green salad with strawberry=tiny mediocre dressing and not a good value.  The boyfriend tried the katsu sampler.  Some items were really good, most were just ok.  I also tried the karaage and zuchinni brown rice bowl.  Really tasty and the brown rice and salad make eating fried chicken seem healthy.  Kind of.  \n\nAs with most restaurants, some items are better than others.  Service can be efficient when not too busy and slow when it is.  Pretty standard for mom and pop restaurants with only 1 server though.  Overall, the concept and execution of the simple menu at Halu works and I really hope it's successful.", "author": "M M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "Unfortunately, I would like to rate this restaurant higher. However, there were too many things wrong to contribute any more stars to the average. It is harsh that I am obligated to do this because they were kind enough to give up a complementary Yebisu for one of the mistakes. However, as another review mentioned, this was not how all customers were treated that night. What this is really about is how is San Francisco ever going to get anything that is legitimately good and/or authentic when Halu is a 4-Yelp-star restaurant? Do not get me wrong, the food was overall fairly good, and nobody was sick afterward. But, this was a \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" experience, and that's how I have to rate it.\n\nBear in mind that this is a Wednesday night at 8:30PM. The restaurant is full with nobody else waiting. There is only one server who playing the role of waitress, hostess, food runner and doing random things in the kitchen person. There is also a man, a woman, a younger woman, and a younger man (dishwasher) all behind the scenes. We (party of two) waited 15 minutes or so outside for the two spots at the bar to be clean and ready. We ordered an Asahi dry to share, marinated tako salad, Chashu-men (pork ramen),  10 skewers (ten: 2 thigh, 2 pork+onion, 2 ground chicken, 2 wing, and 2 heart it's important later). Skewers are fairly small so we also ordered mochi bacon and shishito peppers.\n\nNow, I was being complicated by ordering one skewer salted and one skewer with sauce for the 10 meat skewers. But, in a new place, I was hedging against the sauce being really slimey and salty or the salt mixture being just salty and not very flavorful. It was dumb for such a busy waitstaff, I know. In any case, I received 9 (nine) skewers. Some meats were salt, some meats were sauce. Arbitrary, but it's half and half in a way. This is when the older woman behind the counter apologized very graciously, offering to remake them if it wasn't what I wanted. I really couldn't care, and I'm not going to really rub it in about the elusive skewer. The unfortunate part was it was the thigh skewer which was good. But, I was fine with it, and she brought us a beer without any time to reply. For that portion of the meal, the pork skewer was the least favorite, and I actually really enjoyed the wing skewers. On the subject of skewers, the shishito peppers were also good and the mochi bacon was quite texturally mind-blowing. Flavor-wise it's dry bacon wrapped around rice, so it tastes like dry bacon with a rice-flavored chewy center. If you like bacon, it's good. If you like chewy, it's also good.\n\nNow, the ramen came out right near the end there and, rather than the Chashu-men, it was filled with kara-age fried chicken. Not a problem, it's apparently so crazy this Wednesday that things are just flying out of the kitchen willy-nilly. Then the family next to us gets the Chashu-men, uh oh! It hasn't even touched the counter-top when we hear \"But, I got the chicken!\" wah-waaah.\n\nOk, long story short. The skewers weren't enough for my belly so I ordered some onigiri. They were very patient before letting us down gently that they were out of white rice. Yes, out of white rice. Don't go here on a Wednesday, it's out-of-control bonkers crazy-town busy. So, our onigiri would be made with brown rice. Hey, something new to try. They were at least prepared fresh, and pretty tasty. I actually highly recommend the mustard green onigiri, but probably with short-grain white rice. The brown's okay, but not my personal preference.\n\nAll in all $66.xx for two. Is it the San Francisco rent prices? Or the lack of creative restauranteurs? Why is there such a quality absence in most (but certainly not all!) SF cuisine? I really don't have a lot of incentive to branch out from what I know to be good and worth the cost.", "author": "Chris C."}

It's a small place that is usually packed, but well worth the wait. the Lava Ramen is really good along with fried chicken ramen. Go there to support a local business who serves really great and unique food.", "author": "nick m."}

I've been back a couple times since my first encounter and they've all been tremendous.  But this last time took the cake.  I finally tried one of their rice bowls - sauteed mushrooms with greens over brown rice.  So delicious!!  It's the perfect dinner item when you're not feeling too hungry and want to be somewhat healthy.  Of course, I ordered that with karaage (not the best thing for you) but I had to have a little something something to spice up the brown rice!  I think they have the best karaage in the city.  I can't wait to go back there again - I love their vibe and they are the nicest owners in town.", "author": "Ming Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-15", "description": "I read all the Yelp reviews about this place before I went and many people raved about the bacon wrapped scallops. I love bacon and I love scallops, so I was totally on board.......until they arrived at my table. Maybe I got something different then what everyone has been raving about, but I got raw, chewy, fatty, gross bacon wrapped around a scallop. The bacon was cooked in only 1 small part and the rest was raw, and , frankly pretty disgusting.  The rest of the meal was good. The short rib yakatori was delicious. I liked this place but I am a little confused at to where all these fabulous reviews came from. This place was fine.. average.... no big deal. I dont think I would travel a long distance to eat here. Certainly there are better places to go.", "author": "angela j."}

First off, it took twenty minutes to take our orders, another thirty to get the food and worse off for my friend that ordered a variety of skewers, it took an HOUR AND A HALF to get them!!! The waitress was polite enough to apologize and offered aspargus skewers to him as a peace offering but that was after forty minutes.  Normally I would give it another try but it seems that this is the norm.", "author": "Erick K."}

First off, the space is small, kinda awkward near the door with a narrow passage wedged between the bar seats and small tables along the wall. The door literally hits my friend's chair everytime someone comes in. That being said, the size definitely contributes to the cozy factor. The interior is crammed full of Beatles memorabilia and various knick-knacks of dubious vintage. Of course, Beatles music is blasting the whole time. I read somewhere that the owner used to play in a rock band. We got a good sampling of dishes from this place and formed a consensus on likes and dislikes. They fry really well: the age dashi tofu, kara age, and stuffed mushroom kushi katsu were all done well. Not too greasy, and piping hot. The stuffed mushroom was bursting with juices when bitten into, I wished we tried more of the fried items. Their yakitori on the other hand... Everything that we ordered that came with the house sauce was too salty and felt lukewarm, the ingredients simply lacked the freshness and delicious bincho smokiness that I've experienced in places in LA. However, their yakitori selection wasn't a total loss due to the bacon wrapped items. I mean come on, you could wrap plastic in bacon and it'd taste good. But seriously, maybe because there wasn't the salty house sauce to mask the flavors and the food was hotter, the bacon wrapped items were simply sublime. Bits of crisp, charred, smoky bacon interspersed with the unctous lardo parts surround perfectly cooked vegetables and meats= orgasmic. Lastly, we ordered the kara age ramen for the heck of it, which was nothing to write home about, good enough if you're hungry. In summary, stick to fried stuff and bacon wrapped anything and take your statins of choice at home. Also they're closed from 1/1 to 1/5.", "author": "Cho C."}

I was not in a rush and had some reading to do so slow service was not a problem. I ordered the yakitori set dinner along with sake and tea. The food was great! Never would have ordered the grilled okra on its own but I loved it. The chicken, beef and shrimp were awesome. I really liked the dressing on the small salad. While eating, I noticed the okonomiyake pancake on the specials board. I had read about this in my Osaka tour guides (while dreaming of Japan travel) and saw Anthony Bourdain scarfing it on TV. I don't know where else you can get this and was thrilled to try it. The pancake, think it was meatless with a mayo sauce on top, was tasty and the leftovers were killer for breakfast. I'm going to bring my husband with the Beatles theme as a lure. I will definitely return to try the scallop, asparagus and ramen. What I like about Halu is it's cozy atmosphere with original, authentic high-quality food. ps. the Yelp listing says they don't take credit cards but they took mine.", "author": "Michelle L."}

And it's walking distance from the pad..double yay! Came here for the 1st time early friday night with the bf and his 'rents. Place was pretty empty when we arrived but was super crowded when we left. 1st impression: cute, small, cool beatles paraphenelia, but majorly hot and stuffy! Wear layers cause you'll want something to take off! Got loads of appetizers..erichan specail grilled mochi was pretty unique and agedashi tofu was yummy (although I saw another couple have tofu with mushrooms on top that looked yummier), gyoza was odd, and the grilled rice triangle was really tasty. It tastes exactly like the burnt rice at the bottom of the pot..which I love cause it's super crispy! My ramen was really tasty too, the miso broth wasn't salty at all and you could really taste the tonkatsu base. The yakitori dinner also was good. The only complaint...portions were not that huge. If you're a big eater like the bf and his dad...you'll need multiple entree orders. Even I finished ALL my ramen without trouble...I don't know it that means it was just really yummy or if there weren't enough noodles ...you decide.", "author": "Emily W."}
