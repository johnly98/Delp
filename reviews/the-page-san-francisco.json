Most of the brews are default, recognizable names like PBR, Stella, and Anchor Steam, but there are also a few gems like the Russian River Pliny the Elder DIPA and the New Holland Dragon's Milk stout. \n\nService is perfunctory, although to their credit they were able to handle large crowds when I stopped by. The venue is a bit narrow but is also more elongated than you might think; the front portion feels like a man cave from the '50s or '60s while a rear portion has lots of games (all paid) and feels a bit like a hunters' lodge.

Your standard chill place to grab a drink and play a round with some friends. There was only one bartender who seemed a bit swamped and one of our friends would grab a round for people and collect cups (she didn't even work there! but she'd go back and forth with 10 cups and bring back a round) but they were super short staffed and things were piling up everywhere.\n\nPretty chill divey place.

I'm still reeling from a geeky adolscense and I often don't feel cool enough in a lot of places in the City.\n\nI had an experience last night at The Page that reminded me just how good it feels when you encounter a friendly staff on a night out.\n\nI went to the Page for drinks with a friend and we had a fine time enjoying the abundance of cute little hipster males in the place. As she took off, I went outside to my parked Vespa to ride home. To my dismay, I actually watched myself, in slow-motion, lock my keys in the storage compartment of my scooter along with my cell phone, wallet, and house keys. It was 12:30 in the morning. I had no cash in my pocked. I was a few miles from my house and I couldn't remember anyones number.\n\nGarrett, the door guy, tried to help me pop the lock. When he couldn't get it, he borrowed the bartenders cell phone to call me a locksmith. We waited for a bit and then Garrett suggested that he cancel the locksmith, who was going to cost $200, and try to get home to wake up my roommate to get my spare key. He even offered me bus fare for Muni! I realized that he was right and it was probably cheaper to take a cab to home, grab the key, take a cab back, and then grab my scoot. I did just that. It saved me a lot of money and a lot of time waiting in the middle of the night.\n\nSo thanks to Garrett and the rest of the helpful and hip patrons and staff of the Page! You made this moron's night a little easier to contend with!", "author": "Veronica L."}

Thank you very much, I'll buy you guys beer later (we were all in our late 40s and I'm in my 50s).\n\nGood choice of beer at the pub. We had IPA of some sort then I moved on and tried Sierra Nevada, Glissade. This is a bock beer, I suppose it is of the traditional pale bocks of Germany. A little too malty for me, but when you're getting elbowed by so many people, it didn't matter.\n\nMove down further into the dark hall, and go down the stairs and you'll see an additional pool table and good luck trying to find a place to squish in.

The Page has been a mainstay for me while here.  \n\nLast night I was there with a friend and a work client.  We were at NOPA for dinner before, then headed to The Page for some drinks.\n\nWe were immediately snubbed by the two bartenders, for reasons I cannot explain.  We were friendly, talkative, but not annoying.  However, we must not have ranked high enough on the cool scale. \n\nWe had a couple drinks and then the bartender proceeded to cut me off.  I was a little shocked, as I had about 4 beers and a shot.  I don't consider myself a lightweight, but maybe I need to self evaluate.\n\nI'm not trying to hate on The Page, as I think it's probably the best bar in the neighborhood.  However, the bartenders are a bit questionable.  I get that it's a cool part of town and they need to come across as being sort of hip, but the whole 'I don't care about anything, dress like a slob and I'm cooler than you thing' is a little much.  If need be, I can watch the Star Wars trilogy and brush up on my Sci-Fi knowledge, just post a disclaimer at the door.  Plus, the bartender had some boyfriend-type kicking it at the bar while she worked...He tried to get involved once I was 'cut-off', which I didn't appreciate.

On Thursdays, it sucks because it's in between divey and weekend-hipster-sceney.  On Friday nights, well, it's just sceney.  Not hipsters-only sceney, but sceney nonetheless.\n\nWhat I like about this place, even on sceney nights, is that everyone seems to be afraid to crowd the lower level.  There's a pool table in the back, but if you go down the stairs, there's yet another pool table.  There's also a foosball table way by the back, and although it can often by overcrowded by annoying hipsters, it's often being used (surprisingly) by people who just want to play foosball.  That's awesome.\n\nWhat isn't awesome is that the last time I was here, I was being distracted in my goalkeeper-and-back-line duties by an annoying drunk girl nicknamed Tim who wouldn't stop going on about the authenticity of her Vietnam War-era jacket.  And I wasn't distracted in that way--I was distracted because she wouldn't shut up, and my team ended up losing because of my poor goalkeeping.  I also don't like the fact that there are three goalkeepers as opposed to one, nor do I like the fact that this is a particularly dangerous foosball table because the bars extend too far and don't have rubber pads on their ends.\n\nBut it's cool hanging out down here, and the change machine works remarkably well, and if you stand in the corner you can guard your stuff effortlessly.", "author": "John S."}

Always have, probably always will and so when I am in other parts of our fine world and exploring civilizations outside of Hell-A, I definitely like to get at least a few dives in before I consider it a successful trip. With that said, I found a cool one to add to the list. \n\nApparently this place used to be a hardcore lesbian bar and was a rumored sh*thole, but now it seems as though it has been cleaned up a bit and is nicer than it was in prior years. I don't even wanna imagine how bad it was then, because it still definitely falls into the super dive category.\n\nAs for the vibe, it was a Tuesday night when we hung out here so it wasn't the hipster clusterf*ck I seem to be reading about in other reviews. True, there were hipsters, many of whom were wearing awesome outfits and one super sassy vixen hooked me up with a great vintage dress tip, but for the most part it was just full of seemingly down to earth folks enjoying some early week cocktails.\n\nI would hit this place if I just wanted to grab a drink or 4 with some friends or wanted to shoot some stick, as they have a few pool tables in the back.", "author": "Stephy S."}

Seriously, the ghetto. Not the Tenderloin.\n\nSo, so, super-duper cool. Been there since the 40s. Seafood joint and bar with its own marina, and people pull up to it on their boats. They have great fried catfish... Mmm. And a delicious soul food Sunday brunch... Oh damn! I miss that brunch. And upstairs in the summer, the patio is open, and the menu up there is ALL catfish. Catfish everything. Fried catfish and catfish salad and catfish po' boys...\n\nInside, it's dark: all the time. Even when they pull up the shades on the big windows that overlook the little marina, it's still dark. The interior walls are just DARK. Lots of paneling, and wood finishes... And they have a great big painting near the bar of an old galleon on fire, and I remember when my dad used to take me there as a kid, just staring at that painting... At the brilliant red of the flames eating the boat alive... Thinking it was the brightest thing in the whole damn place.\n\nKeeping with the nautical theme, there are ships' portholes in the doors to the restrooms. The chairs and barstools are leather upholstery with brass buttons: very captain-like. And on the placemats, there's a mermaid throwing a net over the word \"Sinbad's,\" spelled out in ship's line. And she's bare-chested (though she doesn't have any nipples, of COURSE). I remember always being embarrassed by her boobies as a kid, and making sure to set my water glass right on top of them...\n\nAt night the place gets rowdy with the sun-tanned boater crowd. All the people moored down in the marina come up to get their schwerve on -- outside on the patio if the weather's nice. I'd feel bad for the neighbors, but hey -- this is Detroit. All the houses on the street that dead ends at Sinbad's are abandoned.\n\nSo now I've painted a completely incorrect picture of the Page for you.\n\nIt is NOT in the ghetto.\n\nIt does NOT serve seafood, or soul food.\n\nIt does NOT have a nautical theme.\n\nIt does NOT have a marina, nor is it anywhere near the water.\n\nHowever...\n\nIt DOES have those same leather-upholstered chairs and barstools, and it IS dark, and it has more or less the same vibe... In that same cozy, cabin-like way. \n\nIt DOES have lots of people getting their schwerve on. They likely came from the Panhandle or Lower Haight, and not off their boats. And they're definitely not sun-tanned, because this is San Francisco. But schwerve is schwerve.\n\nAnd, with enough schewervin', it probably COULD have some boobies, too. Maybe not of the mermaid variety, but I think boobies are boobies, right?", "author": "Lisa T."}

Initially, it was nothing spectacular but suddenly the Playa turns into a gigantic ice skating ring. After some moments(minutes/hours?) of wonder, I close my eyes and I see a huge volcano erupting lavas in my mind's eye. Both the outer and the inner experience of fantasy are so strong that I am struggling between keeping my eyes open or closed.\n\nI reached Page last night already very drunk from the combination of free and Happy hour priced booze plied on me by the loving bartenders of Jade. I sit at the Bar in Page and down a few Coronas in rapid succession. I wonder around and talk to yelpers as well as random people playing pool, fuzball or footsie.\n\nSuddenly, I come back to the Bar and dose off. I see volcanoes erupting lavas in my mind. I open my eyes and see the color red everywhere. From deer heads frozen in eternity on the red walls to the  Eternal Godhead erupting redness in my mind, I am awash in an ocean of red and my inner and outer experience becomes One.\n\nToday I am facing the aftermath of volcanoes erupting in my head last night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-04", "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am issuing a moratorium on usage of the word \"dive\" as an adjective that expressly modifies the word \"bar\".  Henceforth, you may NOT utilize the word \"dive\" to describe a bar unless it meets ALL of the following criteria:\n\n1. Cash only\n2. Lots of beer on tap\n3. Contains pool tables\n4. Bears a jukebox of any sort\n5. Cheap drinks\n6. TV tuned to ESPN or another sporting event\n7. Blue collar clientele\n\nYour pampered, monied, gentrified ass really has NO IDEA how to define \"dive bar\".  That trendy Mission joint in da hood is simply NOT a dive bar just because it's a little gritty and has a few floor stains.  Please leave the nomenclature to those who have extensive experience with such things.\n\nThat having been said, The Page is as close to a dive bar as the undiscerning socialite can approximate (minus the blue collar clientele).  It's populated by a randomly generated series of Marina assholes who undergo a serious case of cognitive dissonance: the desperate desire to be \"seen at the scene\" coupled with an over-inflated sense of chic and elegance.  Yet, somehow it still manages to retain its \"old world\" charm, those bygone days manifested by the proletariat partaking of the sweet elixir known as beer after performing some activity resulting in sweaty bodies and callused hands.\n\nI like this place.  The drinks are cheap, the music is generated by the digital jukebox near the entrance (CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE, BITCH), and pool/foosball tables abound should you feel the need to demonstrate your drunken ineptitude.  There are a few real people here genuinely interested in conversing instead of touting their own non-achievements.  The ambiance is festive, though this is entirely fostered by the people.  The decor is typical of the \"dive bar\" and in no way remarkable.  But that's the way it should be.\n\nI will return to The Page, as if it were an actual page in a novel that contained my favorite passage, some age old bit of wisdom passed down by the authors of yore.

I like the positioning on the corners of the relatively dark and residential Page and the much busier Divisadero.\n\nThis place is a great location if you want to have some different beers.  They have Brother Thelonious (quite good) as well as Baltika (strong Russian ale).  Other than that the selection is good with a number of Bear Republic and Stone brews on tap.  They also have Hoegaarden and Trumer Pils.  The drinks were pretty stiff and with everything ringing up at about $4.50, I can see myself making my way back at some point.\n\nWhat I was least crazy about (and ultimately the reason we left) was the layout of the place.  It's kind of like the walls are lined with tables, so on a Saturday when they are all full, you kind of really have no where to stand.  You can go down to the little pool room area, but then you're constantly shifting so the bastards playing pool can make their shots.  You can stay up in the bar area but then eventually someone is going to want to get by you.  It felt like our group turned into this gelatinous blob, shifting around the club in an attempt to find a place to settle down, but it just wasn't happening.  Ultimately the Page's charm wore off for me.\n\nProps on being one of the few bars genius enough to put a change machine next to your quarter operated (pool, foosball) games, it saves you from feeling like an idiot when after much effort, the bartender comes over to you and all you order is... $2 in quarters.", "author": "Steven R."}

The people around were pretty decent, didn't seem like any sort of specific crowd.  We made a night at the page, and it seemed like a good spot...but it's also super close to a lot of other cool bars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-17", "description": "The last time I found myself here was immediately after a friend and I got 86'ed from that other bar down the street for smoking in the bathroom and tampering with the smoke detector (in protest of the impromptu no ins-and-outs policy; can you believe it?!). The repeated pounding on the door hadn't deterred us either, we just assumed it was some dumbass, drunk and impatient coke fiend at whom we continued to yell, \"SHUT THE FUCK UP!!\" Actually, turns out it was the 6 foot 7 gargoyle of a bouncer and he was fucking pissed, to say the least. Hilarity ensued as we were being escorted from the bar with me trying to make a case for the lack of evidence linking us to the scene of the crime and my friend repeatedly denying her inebriation with absurd statements such as, \"I could DRIVE right now if I wanted to!\" In any event, towards the Page we stumbled, almost instinctively, and it welcomed us with open arms. This bar means business and business means booze. No DJ's, no dancing, no theme, no scene. Just a row of worn-out bar stools begging to be warmed. This is my kind of bar.\n\nIn a way, the Page is sort of like your lame friend's cooler older brother with the lame friend being that nearby watering hole. Your motive for hanging out with aforementioned lame friend is clear: you have a crush on her awesome older brother but he doesn't really know of or care about you. He's just there. Like maybe while your sort of lame friend is in the bathroom, you pretend to wander aimlessly down the hall pretending you're looking for her and conveniently \"drop by\" his room, casually \"pop in\" and \"innocently\" ask what's up. Maybe he ignores you because Metallica's on full-blast and you don't have the balls to speak up or maybe he just looks up and nods because you're his sister's totally pathetic and uncool prepubescent friend and now you're totally embarrassed and want to die. True story. Anyway, I forget how I intended to weave this analogy into my point. But back to the Page, go there.", "author": "Jenn W."}

The bartenders, really just the female ones, are quite stuckup and bitchy. They will come around and serve you when they feel like ending their conversation with the guy they are talking to at the end of the bar. There attitude is so bad they will make you feel like you are unwelcome and wasting their time. Maybe because I am a girl I don't know but they seem to have it out for me just about every time I go there, which is not often, maybe a couple of times a year.

The cocktails are weakish, and sometimes they're strong so they're very inconsistent...the crowd is also inconsistent. So there's foozball and pool tables, one of the tables is located in the worst spot for it I believe and when it gets packed it really sucks. If I didn't live across the street....well, I do and I almost never go in here because I hear all the drunk douchebags outside all the time on the weekends.

After the first one I felt like I had reached my limit (boy have times changed!) but Zibby kept going strong.  About halfway through the second 40oz, he started with the trash-talking.  Calling me all sorts of names, pestering me not to be such a pussy and to just drink, etc.  A few minutes into his bantering and just before he was about to take another swig the scenario played out like this:\n\"You pus--\"  BLARF.  *Zibby puking*\n\"Oh man, this suc--\" BLARF *Zibby puking again*\n\"Dude, you're lucky you didn--\" BLARF *Zibby yet again puking*\nOne of the few times that restraint on my part actually paid off.  Also one of the last times where a single 40oz could get me drunk.  \nThat being said, I've always known my cutoff point when it comes to booze.  Well, almost always.  But for whatever reason, The Page is *that* place for me where I test out my limits.  After a raucous night out when I should be heading home, I often go to the page for a last drink.  When I'm starving and the only thing I've had all day is booze, The Page is probably where you'll see me having a liquid meal.

(read: umbrella ella ella ella ella barf). oh well... happy hour is good.  but not a lot of seating... so get there for happy hour... grab a stool.. and do.not.move.", "author": "Ashley A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-11-29", "description": "Inside, The Page is a full fledged salute to rumpus rooms of the late 60's and early 70's. Tons of vintage lamps with red bulbs, various animals heads staring you down, two pool tables, etc. Drinks are reasonably priced and they have a nice selection of beer (I really enjoyed the Anchor Steam Christmas Ale). The bartenders might, however, benefit from the understanding that people come in to actually spend money there and deserve only a minimal amount of courtesy. That is, of course, unless I accidentally got this place confused with the San Francisco location of the Dick's Last Resort restaurant chain. 4+ star place, 2- star service.", "author": "Greg H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-10-20", "description": "Although I was once criticized by the bartender for ordering one of their \"girly\" cosmos (note: it was actually for a lady), I've designated the Page my Official Preferred Watering Hole (which is quite a hefty title to wield). The decor reminds me of my parents basement (pre-1980s remodelling effort), the music (internet jukebox) consists of a great mix, but is not overpoweringly loud, and there's a foosball table that is generally not in use (until I arrive).", "author": "nick m."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-10", "description": "It seems like it could be a decent place, but every time I've been in, it's completely crowded with people who don't seem anything like the people I see everywhere else in my neighborhood, and I mean that in a bad way. The lower Haight is a relatively mellow area, and particularly this spot on Divisadero is almost exactly between the upper and lower Haight, so it's not too inundated by revelers destined for either, but for some reason whenever I go to the Page, I get flashbacks to the undergrad asshats who made me loathe going out in Santa Cruz.
