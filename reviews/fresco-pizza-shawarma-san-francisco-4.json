The $12 lamb pita is MUTTON at best, tough and grizzled like an old angry ram. The pizza is not that great either. If you're out after bars on Polk St. with the munchies, keep walking. Go to Mustafio's for a big $5 slice of Neapolitan style pizza. \n\nAlso remember (even though you're most likely too drunk) to avoid Piccadilly's fish and chips right next door to \"Fresco\" Shawarma's, per my other review. This part of Polk street is really awful for decent late night food, so if you're here you're screwed. Around the corner on Pine St. is Grubsteak, but they fleece you every time.

I've seen Fresco Pizza Shawarma on Eat24 for the past couple of years or so. Since they serve the two things I was looking for: an appetizer and a meat sampler, I decided to order delivery last Sunday, July 24th. I placed the order at 12:06pm an it arrived at 1:02pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Mixed Appetizer Platter: Combination plate of hummus, baba gannoush, tabouli, ezme, potato salad, eggplant salad ($14.99), Extra Pita (+$0.75)\n*Mixed Grill: Mixed grill consists of chicken and lamb shish kebob, kotte kebab, green salad, hummus ($18.99)\n\nThe baba ghanoush and tabbouleh were the best things about the meze platter. The tabouli added a nice green freshness to every bite and the baba gannoush was savory and creamy. The hummus, however, was very bland. Didn't have much flavor which was disappointing. Out of all the apps, I figured I'd like the hummus the best. The eggplant was all bad. I'm not sure how this is normally prepared, but it was slimy with a snotty texture. Really unappealing. I didn't try the potato salad and I didn't see any ezme, but I'm not familiar with ezme, so maybe it was there?\n\nAlso, the Eat24 app requires you to order extra pita with the mixed appetizer sampler. I believe this is a glitch as I realized later, the Eat24 site doesn't require you to do that. So save the extra $0.75 and go online to order as the pita was a little hard. I didn't even end up using on of the pitas I got anyways, so it was a waste. The mixed grill was a little better. All the meats had a nice smokiness. And surprisingly, I really liked the rice. The hummus with the mixed grill was also flavorless though.\n\nVery disappointing mezze platter. And the mixed grill was just okay. This may be a good spot for late night eats like a shawarma or a slice of pizza, but for straight up Mediterranean food, Fresco fell a little short.", "author": "Elena N."}

Loved the char on the outside.\n- The Hummus was actually a little flavorless, but the rest of the combo made up for it, I think. It went well smeared on the soft pita with the salad.\n\nThe Dolmas\n-The rice inside was very soft, almost porrige-like in consistency so meh to that mouth feel. It did have a nice flavor though... I felt like there was a good amount of herbs present, maybe dill, and some lemon.

However, they were a bit on the cold side. I understand it was delivered, but it could have been warmer. As for the salad (lettuce, tomato & Italian dressing), well, it was salad.

I was randomly looking for a place to deliver hummus around 1 a.m & I got lucky with fresco!! I was iffy about the hummus first since I mostly know them as a pizza place but omg I'm so glad I went with my gut!! I ordered hummus , and mozzarella sticks with extra hummus and extra pita . I mostly wanted just the hummus but they have a delivery minimum so I got the other stuff but wow! I absolutely love the hummus!!! It's more on the citrus side but it's absolutely amazing! So before I had ordered from this place I wasn't quite sure where it was located but I thought I had seen it before,  so one day while walking down on Polk Street I ran past it so I decided to stop by and grab my friend & myself a little tub of hummus ;) best thing ever!!! She loved it as well! And OK so the other night I got off work kind of late and I was craving that hummus again so I ordered super late and they ordered within 30 minutes!!!! I ordered this time with rice pudding which is to die for!! They melt some type of caramel on top that makes it more amazing u must try yourself!! Well thank you so much fresco for being so wonderful and keep up all that good hummus I will definitely be your regular customer!! thank you!!!\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE : hummus recipe was changed . I repeat HUMMUS RECIPE WAS CHANGED! Why??? No flavor in new recipe . Please change back. I know you guys changed it a while back but everytime I pass your spot im sad and miss the old hummus. Please change it back ! Thank you !", "author": "Lupe V."}

All I ordered here was the Hawaiian and the combo pizza around 11pm on a Sunday night. We were actually just passing by, but a couple workers were sitting outside and assured us that their food was delicious. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have so readily believed two people who obviously worked there, but my hunger at the time was so overwhelming that we ended up going inside. \n\nYou can't go too wrong with a pizza with generic toppings, but it's usually not great, either. The pizza was similar to Little Caesars, which is on the lower tier of pizzas for me. I might be back, but not for the quality of food -- only for the convenience of having something to drunkenly scarf down in the wee hours of the night. \n\nIf you want a larger selection of pizza and you don't mind walking a bit, you might want to stop by Mustafio's (at Polk & Post, a few blocks down).

But it closed at 3am, so I had to hurry. \n\nDouble checked to confirm the closing time and both Yelp and their website (and it turns out the sign outside the restaurant!) say it closes at 3am. So I hurriedly got appropriately dressed, put lights on my bicycle, grab the bike lock, hop on the bike and pump the cranks hard and fast to make it in time to get a sandwich. \n\nI arrive at 2:50 and the chairs are all up on the tables, the lights are off save for one in the back and it appears empty. But the sign in the window still says open and the door is not locked. \n\nSo I pop in and a guy appears from the back to tell me it is closed. I told him I thought it was open until 3 and and he said yes it's now 3 a.m. I was a bit mystified how I had taken so long, but I didn't have a watch and my phone was in my backpack so I accepted the reality that I was going to have to go somewhere else to eat. \n\nSo I find a place to stand the bike and sit down and dejectedly root around in my backpack and pull out my phone to find a new place to eat only to discover that it is 2:52 a.m. per my phone. So I walk back over to the place and tap on the glass and show the guy my phone which says 2:52. He gives me a rude and condescending, \"What?\" \n\nI told him it wasn't yet 3am and showed him the sign that said it closes at 3am. So he then sarcastically said, \"ok, so what do you want to eat?\" Obviously the kitchen was closed and I wasn't going to demand food, so I just asked why he closed early. \n\nHe told me that he closes the kitchen and stops serving food at 2:30 a.m. every night, starts cleaning up and finally locks up at 3am. I earnestly suggested that he should change the sign to reflect a 2:30am closing time if that is when he closes down the kitchen. So, dripping with disdain and superiority, he richly replied that he would change the sign tomorrow just for me. \n\nBad mojo. Weird policy. Unappetizing looking place from the outside.

This review is based on a delivery through Eat24.\n\nWe have ordered from this establishment several times (almost every weekend...) and although it is never remarkable, because of the late night delivery we continue to give Fresco Pizza our patronage. We have ordered an arrangement of things including chicken kabob plate, kofta kebab plate, salmon kebab plate, pizzas, salads, soups, appetizers and sandwiches. \n\nThis past weekend our order was awful. We ordered the kofta plate which was sub par, per usual. The meat was bland, the rice was old/crispy/bottom of the batch, per usual, the pita was stale, per usual, and the flavor of the hummus was completely inconsistent with previous orders. We also ordered a side of Baba Ganoush, which I typically do enjoy from here, however this one was inedible and tasted entirely of mayo.\n\nI typically do not like to complain in situations like this because its late night delivery, I get that its hard to be nit picky.. however nothing we ordered was remotely close to good and we ended up critiquing the food then throwing it away.\n\nI called the restaurant to let them know that I was completely unsatisfied and at first, the man who answered was incredibly hostile and questioning toward me. He did agree that the hummus was overly peppery and not right and by the end of the conversation told me that he would take care of the bill for me. When I logged onto my account I saw that $7 had been removed from my $35 bill... so much for being taken care of. I contacted Eat24 to find out what was going on and it seems that Fresco Pizza did not provide any comments on the order therefore it looks like I'm SOL. Hopefully this issue can be rectified soon. Although far from stellar, it is nice to have Fresco Pizza in our late night routine however at this point it will not happen again.", "author": "Lauren B."}

No idea why I went back thinking that ordering a new dish might be a good idea knowing that my experience has been 0 for 2.  Proximity I guess.  I've been here three times now; the pizza is bad, the shawarma wraps are bad, and now I can confirm that the Philly cheesesteak is the worst I've ever had.  As soon as I'm done with this review I'm going to toss this sandwich and go buy food somewhere else.  There is no cheese in it despite the guy behind the counter telling me there was; they just put a shitload of mayo inside!  DISGUSTING.  There is more mayo than meat...The sandwich can be described as 70% bread, 15% mayo, 10% meat, 5% onions.\n\nAlso they have a sign offering 10% off if you show them a Yelp review.

Front desk gives us a couple of menus, 1 of which was this establishment. This place won due to its inclusion of shawarma and rotisserie chicken. I call and put in an order for 3 plates, 1 sandwich. I ask if I can pay with credit and he says they will bring credit machine wit them. I ask how long they expect it to take. Guy hangs up. We are starving and hungry, but whatever.\n\n35 minutes later I decide I should check on the order to confirm. They ask for the address.. Then to confirm the number is 409... I reply, no it's 449. They say 1249? I say no.. 4..4..9. I ask how long. They say driver has already left, so soon. I ask will he know what room.. He mumbles yes, I think.\n\nAnother 20 minutes passes and we get a call. The driver hasn't left yet and needs credit card info, as the other driver left with the credit card machine. I provide my card info and ask how long - \"it's busy tonight, it's taking 1 hour to get orders out. I'm leaving now so 15 minutes.\"\n\n15 minutes or so later, to his credit, I get another call. \"What room?\" 449 I reply. \"That's why it's late, I'm on 12th floor. I'll be down.\"\n\nI wait for him with door open, he says \"you don't have to be mad.\" I reply \"don't say it's late because I gave you the wrong room number.\" He starts to show me his scribble of 1249 on his notes. I proceed to not tip him. He hands me my receipt along with a four letter expletive.\n\nI gather myself and start serving people their food.

The pizza didn't look very good, so we didn't bother to try it. Our group ordered, the steak and cheese sandwich, french fries, chicken shawarma and the lamb shawarma. Let me just say everything was just EH except for the lamb shawarma. The lamb was delicious and amazingly tender. The chicken was kinda dry. They make it really spicy, so if you can't handle it - tell them to omit the spicy sauce. But damn all the ingredients they throw in there is good and the sandwich is jam packed!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "When you see a place called \"pizza & shawarma\", you should always order the shawarma; there's no way they'll make decent pizza. Focus on what you know! And anyway, the last thing I wanted was pizza, and Fresco is nearly the only non-pizza option late at night.\n\nSo: 1 chicken shawarma, 1 hummus, 1 pistachio baklava. This should be easy, right? Order and delivery via eat24 arrived in very reasonable time, about 40 minutes. Good so far.\n\nHummus came without pita to eat it with, instead I got some other small bread loaf that I didn't recognize. Hummus was good but bread didn't do it for me. I guess you have to ask for pita? It wasn't on the menu. This was my \"fall back\" in case the rest of the meal failed, and yet was a failure too. There was still a ton of hummus left and no method to eat it. What a waste!\n\nShawarma was huge but falls apart very easily. The chicken itself was great. The vegetables seem to be a pickled red cabbage (?) which give that pickled flavor  you need for a  good shawarma, but it could be a lot better. It's pretty strong and kind of overwhelms the rest of the food. It was also bit spicy, which was unexpected but fine with me. \n\nOverall, I didn't finish it due to it's size and won't save it for tomorrow due to it's peculiar flavor. That said, shawarma varies widely from region to region, so for all I know this is exactly what you might be looking for. You also might get the option to customize in person.\n\nBaklava was bad, extremely mushy. Have to wonder how old this was...\n\nWhile the shawarma was OK and the hummus might be okay if pita was provided, I doubt I'll order here again. That said, with a few minor improvements, this place would be pretty good for middle-eastern delivery.", "author": "Jonathan D."}

First, they are open late and deliver late.  After midnight it's nice to be able to get something other than just pizza or Thai!  We've had their pizza and it's decent.  Better than expected.  The owner? (who reminds me of John Turturro) is a really nice guy and often delivers our food.\n\nThere are places with better middle eastern food but Fresco is more than adequate in taste and portion size and did I mention that they deliver really late?  The shawarma plate (or kebab plate) is a really good deal and includes a lot of rice, meat, a small salad and some hummus.  The wraps are also decent but should be ordered spicy for that extra kick of flavor.\n\nSo why 4 stars for such a seemingly average place? \n\nTonight we ordered the shawarma plate with lamb and a cheeseburger for delivery.  The order didn't take long to arrive and we dug in.  The cheeseburger was decent but the lamb shawarma was a little overdone and tough, like we were the first to order it in hours so they had given us all the charred edges.  I personally like burnt meat so I was enjoying it.  But then, maybe 15-20 min. after we received our order, the door bell rang.  The delivery man was back with a whole separate order of very fresh, hot CHICKEN shawarma that we didn't even order!

The problem was deciding what to get so of course we over ordered, but the leftovers were perfect for the morning, ha ha.  Got the lamb and beef shwarma, more like the wraps you'd get in Istanbul late night vs the kind in a pita.  1 was enough to share between two of us.  Also got a side of falafal balls and hummus, really crispy and the hummus was pretty good.  And finally the Nob Hill pizza, great at 3 am and I thought even better the next morning.  I would eat that shwarma anytime.\n\nI know, it was a lot of food, but it WAS 2:30 am and when you don't want to leave the apartment you don't want to take the chance that you want something else!

In the near future, I may be temporarily impaired; strangely, I enjoy this feeling.*\n\nHow is it humanly possible that there is a pizza place in San Francisco that hasn't been reviewed yet?  Honestly.  I ordered pizza from here last week, and it's near the Tenderloin, so many many many Yelpers must have tried the pizza.  And no one's reviewed it?  I'll take the little badge, but I also feel like I'm getting away with something.\n\nThe pizza is mediocre.  Ignore that for a few seconds, and go to grubhub.com to see the best pizza deal I've ever seen in my life.  OK, it's not better than any of the Little Caesar's pizza deals back in the late '80s, but it's definitely the best pizza deal I've ever seen offered from a non-chain place.  And this is in San Francisco.\n\nHaven't visited grubhub.com yet?  You're so lazy but so am I, so I'll provide you with the details:\n\nRED-EYE DEAL\nLarge 16\" 2-topping pizza\n2-liter soda\nonion rings\n$15.50 (including tax)\nMondays and Tuesdays after 9 p.m.\n\n\nYes, you read that correctly.  There are many places in this city at which you cannot get a 16\" pizza with no toppings for $15.50.  But $15.50 for all that, plus the tax is included?  Is it too good to be true?  No, because I ordered this last week.\n\nThe onion rings aren't the best, but they're slightly better than the pizza.  It probably deserves three stars, but the deal and the fact that they're open till three a.m. every night put this place over the four-star threshold.\n\n*Pointer Sisters paraphrase.  \"One two three four five, six seven eight nine ten, eleven TWELVE!

And at times, I've known too the pay-off... although... and let's be honest here, it is often thankless, and the pay itself does not seem to justify one's efforts.\n\nI know it with with my great tap root.\n\nAnd I know too that very often the thankless-ness does not come from the employers, but the customers! It is a great economic injustice that they tend to dictate if an establishment should succeed or fail. I am not one for passivity, or for clich\u00e9s, but this couldn't have come any more serviceable than now: that tired, old, neo-Stoical stance of \"It is what it is\". In business, especially in small business, if you are to succeed, you rely heavily on your customers, and your customer service.\n\nAnd having been a customer myself-- longer than I've been in customer service jobs-- I know what makes bad service and good.\n\nI used to be a fan of this place, and can't seem to stop singing its praises to my fellow \"drunkards, insomniacs and fl\u00e2neurs\" desperate for grub in the middle of the night. Back when I lived in the South of Market, they would, quite literally be very happy to deliver to me even at the eleventh hour: at two-thirty, two-fourty-five in the morning. The delivery fast and replete with smiles and pleasantries. I'm thinking they were new-ish then when first I wrote them a glaring review (there were, to my recollection, only three or four other reviews here on Yelp), and were excited to get a place up and running. I was more excited when I found an apartment a block away from them on Lower Nob Hill, and you better believe that there came a period when I just couldn't stay away. I'm still rather new to the neighborhood, and being a homebody, if I can help it, keep the weekend evenings all to myself, relaxing, although I've since grown quite aware that I've moved smack dab at the center of the hub of things. Well, that is to say if you feel yourself comfortable, at home, or one of the AAU plebs, or the raucous \"bridge-and-tunnel\" people. Needless to say these rats constitute the majority of their customers, especially during the weekends. I've been witness to the pandemonium several times, an obstreperous line out the door. In one such episode, the business was so frenzied that when I got to the counter for my phoned-in order, they had forgotten that I had placed an order for two items, but completed my transaction for only one. Not until I was turning around did they notice, and after some manic hand gestures from one of the cashier's co-workers, perhaps alerting him of his negligence, I had already exhausted my patience to fall back into that line. Whatever. No big deal. The Shawarma Sandwich was still good. Never mind those soggy onion rings, indeed my dinner was complete even without them.\n\nI had mentioned in my last review the difficulty in placing orders (delivery or otherwise) over the phone. I may have mentioned too that part of that difficulty is, shall we say, with the, let's call it their 'cultured voices.' But the greater difficulty is the noise from within their confines: all that hollering amongst each other and amongst the customers. That's why I prefer ordering online. When came the time that I did, and arrived to pick up my order, they haven't made it at all! I expected an apology,-- as customary response, like I said, I've done customer service jobs before, and apologies are rarely meant, although the gesture is appeasing-- instead I got a nice scolding from the cashier, telling me that in future ordering over the phone would be best for them! But oh well... The Spaghetti Bolognese wasn't half bad.\n\nIn time I've started noticing their competitors. And if one knew my neighborhood, one knew there's plenty of them around. It took a while before I thought of them again. And when finally I came around, last night, their delivery service online wasn't working (not much to their dismay, I'm sure!) and so I had no choice but to phone in. Well, it was the same hollering, clinging-and-clanging situation happening, muffled by 'cultured voices' and a fuzzy connection, was it too late to place an order for delivery, I asked. No, he said, only if I would be willing to be put on hold. I obliged. I heard the microphone set down the counter with the sharp thud of plastic on plastic. I overhear the madness carrying on as usual. Minutes go by, I wasn't counting, but it couldn't have been less than five. I heard the microphone scraped off the counter and picked up, and then one last click before silence. I kept my ear on that silence for a good few more minutes. In horror? No, but surely in absolute bafflement. Could it have been so busy that they quickly forgot that a customer on hold was trying to place an order? Could it be that business was that good they could afford to lose this customer? Well then, if so, I'd be happy to take mine elsewhere.", "author": "Rho-p O."}

I placed an order for delivery and when the man finally got here (after about two hours) he called and said \"I'm outside, come and get your food\" ARE YOU KIDDING? \nSave your money, don't eat at Fresco Pizza!", "author": "Windy Y."}

The pizza is better that Victors in the taste, size, and price categories.  The shawarma was a disappointment.  The turning cone of meat was not only not turning, it looked like meatloaf.  The server cut a few pieces off it and heated them on the grill.  That's not the shawarma experience I was expecting.  Service was pleasant enough. The walls of the place are clean and freshly painted but pastel green and pastel pink are troubling.  There is great potential for improvement here.", "author": "Soy L."}

I only ordered it cuz it had pesto and basil (which I love), yet somehow these flavors were subdued. The chicken didn't have much of a taste either. Let's just say I was underwhelmed. Luckily I wasn't hungry at the time or I may have been upset..\n\nHowever my friend ordered some fries and she liked them. They were crinkly. Though she said they were a bit salty. They also were 3 bucks for just a small handful. Yeah,  I think 3 stars is adequate.", "author": "Rasi A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-10", "description": "I'm always wary of places that serve completely different cuisines, (pizza and falafel?!?) and this is another case that proves my instinct correct.  Though the server was very warm and welcoming, and even gave me a free falafel ball taster as I waited, I won't be going back unless they serve up some fresher Mediterranean. The crust on the falafel was thick, and the inside was dry.  The wrap came with some old greasy potatoes that I would've skipped for some tabouli or lettuce instead.  The hummus was pretty flavorless, too.  The pizza, I didn't try. :(", "author": "N. L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-03-27", "description": "When I first moved here, the shawarma was really good, other than being stuffed with huge under-cooked french fries. The last two times I ordered, it was different. They seem to have replaced their nice cucumber/tomato/red onion veggie salad with shredded red-cabbage and (at least one of the times) grilled onions and bell peppers. Tasted pretty gross. I haven't been back super recently, and it looks like they may have changed up their menu a bit, so maybe they fixed it. For a place with \"shawarma\" in the name, they need to be on their game. I understand you have to serve drunk assholes all night, they don't care about the taste, and all those nice chopped veggies are probably expensive, not to mention it takes way more effort to make a shawarma than to reheat two slices of pizza when there is a line out the door. Just offer a different menu after 11pm.", "author": "Anthony B."}

The first time I ate @ Fresco was the last time I journeyed for another traditional middle eastern type Lamb Shawarma joint. \"Truly Mediterranean\" or \"Oasis Grill\" iv had and trust me when I say I wish I hadent, especially because of the quality difference Fresco Pizza & Shawarma  provided. The Lamb Kabob plate or even the Spicy Lamb plate served a heap full of Rice, side veggies, hummus dipping sauce for fresh & HOT out of the oven bread. The atmosphere is always calm and never to loud. Great place to lounge outside on there tables to enjoy the Polk st. crowd when I first had their chicken Caesar salad fit for a king with two whole chicken breasts on top! O and they deliver Thru Eat 24 hr SF.com.  I gave a 4 star review because as a Connoisseur in food generally speaking being 6'2 215lb I'm basically stuffed and always bringing home leftovers.
