We were slightly intimidated by its appearance - it's intimate and extremely classy, so we assumed it would be expensive. Thankfully the prices were pretty reasonable.\n\nOur waiter recommended the bacon & ricotta ravioli ($16). It came out steaming hot with some crispy bread on the side. While I didn't have taste buds after my meal, it was creamy and delicious. It was pretty rich but I still wanted more! While a little pricy, I had no regrets (even though my lactose intolerance was acting up...).\n\nThe only disappointing aspect was that our waiter wasn't the friendliest. After reading some of the other reviews about how staff wasn't friendly however, I don't take it personal. I personally think it enhances your dining experience when you feel welcomed. However, although somewhat preoccupied, our waiter was quick to take our order and fulfill any requests we have.\n\nFor a classy dining experience before your night out partying it up with amazing people in Castro, check out Blush!", "author": "Abby C."}

I've never had a wine here I didn't like, and they have many of my favorites (no claim to being a oeno/expert here) including a House Montepulciano, Sanc\u00e8rre, and some lovely darker red blends (my favorite!). \n\nHappy hour (until 6pm) is choose your own adventure at 30% off all wines. \n\nFOOD: There are cheese plates and other smaller bites that looked appetizing! Hope to try sometime soon :). \n\nSERVICE: so friendly! Never felt rushed (I do in most wine bars) and appreciated our server's high indecision tolerance. Everyone working there was open and ready to help--easy to flag someone down for whatever reason (more drinks, question about the wine list, bathroom low on toilet paper). \n\nAMBIANCE: perfect for a first or hundredth date or catch-up. There's a good mix of counter, table, bar, and couch seating--something for everyone (well, comfortably groups up to 10)! The lighting is charmingly dim without the hazards of darkness (looking at you, Local Edition). It's cozy, but doesn't feel small given the high ceilings and many nooks settle in. Overall, a welcome oasis amid all the fun craziness that is the Castro at night :).", "author": "Helen W."}

The vibe is chill, it's next to lots of other spots I like, and the happy hour drink deal is good... But I've also had a number of wines by the glass here that I don't adore here. Some are quite sweet? Others quite plastic? Hard to pin... But there are some interesting things like a pink pinot gris and a sparkling  red that are fun to try even if they aren't my fave. The staff are honest as you find your way through the wine list and can help you avoid things you wouldn't like. The tapenade and bruschetta and edamame hummus are all good but overpriced for the portions. Love the ambiance-- could hang here for hours.", "author": "Anastasia Z."}

I rode the Rainbow-lit-escalator up from the muni station into the vivacious heart of Castro. Thirsty, I sauntered over to Blush! An adorable sign boasted a seven-day-a-week happy hour. Thirsty, I ordered a glass of prosecco from the charming bartender. I proceeded to people watch the hustle and bustle of Castro street while sipping my effervescence.\n\nLater, my companion arrived and we moved to a scarlet, velvet couch in the back. I sipped a glass of dry, Jacqu\u00e8re. The bartender was kind enough to pour me a taste before I committed to a generous glass. We sat, chatted and took in the wonderful neighborhood of a wine bar. Although, It appeared the majority of customers were regulars, I felt quite welcome. I would definitely return to try more of the unique offerings in such a quaint establishment.\n\nFunny Note: \nA customer asked if one of the bartenders was celebrating Cinco de Mayo. The server embraced the other server and cried, \"We are French! We do not celebrate Cinco de Mayo! We lost!\"", "author": "Backwordbender F."}

It's conveniently located right across the street from the Castro Theater, if you and your friends just finished watching a show and want to grab a drink or two before heading home. \n\nBoth times I've been, there were 5-6 of us and it was never too crowded that we couldn't find seats immediately, which is impressive given its prime location in the Castro. We came around 10 pm on a Friday and Saturday night, respectively, so I was surprised we could find seating so easily.The set up is varied with some larger communal tables, some cozy looking couches, and some private tables that are perfect for a group of 5-6 people.\n\nI've never had the food here, but I've consistently gotten their sangria ($8 a glass) which is delicious if you like sweeter drinks like me. Note that it's probably one of the sweetest sangrias I've ever had, so if sweet drinks aren't your thing, stay far away from the sangria here and try one of their many wines instead.\n\nParking here is all along the street. The last time I came my friend drove and it was shocking to me how we were able to find an open spot right in front of Blush. So it is possible but I would recommend ubering or lyfting instead to be safe, especially on a busy Friday/Saturday night.", "author": "Dianna H."}

I had wanted to sing at a place like this, dark and trendy, good wine but not too crowded so that you can still hear your companion at a respectful distance.  It also possible to take small breaks and mingle around the tables scattered around this bar, without bumping into sweaty people. I did not think a French wine bar existed in many places in this part of the town. In part, I was never looking for such things. If I wanted a French bar, I would have gone to one at my home in France but that's too far, too ambitious and unnecessary when a good one is just across the street from the Castro theatre.\n\nI arrived last week after a long day at work, honestly thought I was late but I was the first to arrive. Promptly ordered a glass of bubbly Rose and grabbed a table because my girlfriend often arrives with her entourage and that evening it was no exception. Soon six of them arrived, separately and then some together, they complimented my seating arrangement. We all set at a communal table, pleasantries exchanged. Noted two new people from Brooklyn, musicians, who I had not met before, one friend I already knew, some musician who lives in Cole Valley, a Bavarian girl I've known through a gallery outing and then my girlfriend who was an ageless lady who used to belly dancing naked in the early years of Blackrock city, now a perennial fixture among the musicians and artist in town. She literately knows everyone and is friends with everyone in town. So you get the gist. This bar attracts artist types who came in that evening to watch a band. It's a good place for likeminded people to gather, to have a good meal and then listen to some tunes. \n\nI ordered appetizers for the table. Ever feel that you are the lucky one who did well for yourself and you should be more generous among your artist friends? Well, I do. I always feel too sheltered and too lack of artistry. The only thing I'm good at is to eat food. So I ordered two things and they arrived shortly. They edamame spread was quite clever. I liked it a lot. The musicians playing that evening were quite good. French gypsy music was quite suitable for this bar. \n\nIt's low key. Meaning, you don't have to scream and yell to talk and to be heard. The ambience is chill. And the food is good. The wine selection is robust. Stick with French, but of course.\n\nWill likely bring other friends of mine over here for meal and music.", "author": "Victoria E."}

This caused my friends and I to explore around Castro for 45 mins before it opened, granted the street has many places to wonder in and explore so it wasn't too bad. I only noticed the late opening (10 mins, so really not that big of a deal) because we were literally standing outside. Also they were not completely ready at the time the store said they would be, in terms of kitchen staff and decor. \n\nCame here one weekend with my two high school friends to chat, drink, and eat. We walked in right when they opened the doors and clearly they were not 100% ready. The kitchen staff does not come in for another 30-45 mins after the opening so any food orders just took a little longer. The candle light decorations had yet to be lit and placed around the room either so it was a rather dark and uninviting environment. Once properly set up though, the place was rather charming with selves of wines, coaches, more private tables, and a bar. \n\nWe also weren't aware but we came in during happy hour (daily 4-6pm) and all wines were 50%, yay! I am not a professional wine taster so sadly you cannot fully trust my taste on the \"good stuff\" but I can say there was a good selection of options. We ordered a bottle of Moscato for $18 after the 50% off (that screams girl-drinkers, I know! Partially ashamed, partially not.) and a large assorted board ($38). The board though! It really went well with a glasses of wine and I fell in love with the olive tasting spread, yum!\n\nThe service was super friendly with the two interactions we had. Once when the kitchen staff apologized for the wait with the food they brought out and the second time when were were brought out our wine and asked if we wanted the option of chilling the remaining amount in the bottle, considerate. Overall, I think they were busy opening and could tell we wanted to chat and catch up, so they left us relatively alone which was fine for me. \n\nEnd note: I would love to come here during happy hour again but I would double check the times they are actually open and maybe wonder in 20 mins after they open.", "author": "Maybo H."}

It's the only wine bar in my neighborhood (the Castro), it's pretty cute inside and the staff is friendly enough, and because of all that they do a consistently good business. But there is one major drawback: MEDIOCRE WINE. \n\nHonestly, I wonder why I keep going back despite the convenience, because every time I try a different glass and hope I will finally find that one exceptional wine, I am disappointed. Every time! In all the years they've been there I'm not sure they've changed the wine menu much but I guess it works for most people because business does not suffer. To me, however, their $12-14 glasses taste like the $12-14 bottles I get at the corner store. I have no problem paying that price for a glass of wine, I just want it to rock my world a little bit.\n\nTwo positive things to note. They have an amazing happy hour special... 1/2 off all glasses and bottles, which is honestly the only time I go anymore because that's the only time their mediocre wine selection has a justifiable and appropriate price. Secondly, the food menu, while a bit on the plain side at least as far as the cheese and charcuterie platters go) has always been consistently tasty. (Probably because it's helping the mediocre wine go down better.)\n\nOverall, this place has the potential to be *outstanding* but kinda falls flat.

They're open late and have a decent amount of seating, which means you can sit with a friend and chat comfortably into the night over a few glasses of wine.\n\nOf course, we should talk about the wine: Most importantly, this place has a huge selection of wines! They have wine of all kinds from all over the world, and many wines aren't even on the menu, so ask the staff if you're looking for something in particular. For someone like me, who admittedly doesn't know much about the wine, the staff is really helpful. All you need to do is describe the type of taste you're looking for and they'll make sure you're satisfied. They even let you taste a particular wine first before you get a full glass. The wine selection is mostly reasonably priced at ~$10-12 a glass, so you can feel fancy without paying too much for it.\n\nImportant note: I didn't try the food, but I'd like to! I'll be back the next time I'm looking for a place to spend a quiet night out with a few friends.", "author": "Brittany C."}

Sure there's good ravioli, variety of wines and somewhat uncomfortable chairs; service can be slow and the ambiance ranges from nice couch, bar to picnic table. Ours was an issue of service and accommodation. My partner has a painful back condition that really is helped if he puts his feet up on another chair, which he's done pretty much every time we've gone. We're not talking reclining with feet up on a table but just propped up onto another chair so as to relieve the pressure coming up the legs from the concrete floors to his back. It's certainly not a sign of disrespect. \n\nEvery time we've been there nad he's done there was never a reaction, no comments, nothing even if they're busy. They've had a good track record of accommodation too. We bring our big serivce dog there regularly and never even had an eyelash batted at us. \n\nBut for some reason tonight (which wasn't busy) the staff was having none of the foot-raising. And instead of asking why his feet were up or asking him to put them down the rather animated (and jerky) security/staff skipped right ahead to kicking us out after curtly announcing that, \"you need to leave right now.\" And that was the end of our night. All in all the episode was more shocking to us more than anything else. It seems as if staff needs to get a refresher on customer service and empathy.", "author": "Kevin H."}

My friend and I took place in a big sofa which felt awesome after a day walking around. When comparing prices between a glass and a bottle we quickly concluded we should go for the bottle. However when asking the waiter for a recommendation he brought us wine only sold by the glass, misunderstanding I guess. I explained him that we were actually going for a bottle and he left us the bottle he used that was 4/5 full. He said we could drink as much as we wanted and he would make us a price. This proposition can be tricky because you have no clue how much you will end up paying but we decided to enjoy our wine and figure it out later. Two others friends joined us and even though the place is not really charming we had a lot of fun. When asking for the bill, the waiter asked us the equivalent of 3,5 glasses although we had finished the bottle and pretty much had 2,5 glasses each. Great deal thus from this very friendly bartender.", "author": "Laura N."}

It's decent, but I've only had 'lette (down in SoCal), and it seems to be a bit better with the outer shell.

It's a nice place to meet friends in the evening for a drink. The bartenders are always very nice and welcoming.  I feel bad for them, however: management can't seem to get staffing right.

Also, something really needs to be done about the kitchen.  Sometimes it's fine, and you get your food within a reasonable time.  At other times, it's ridiculous--half an hour or more to get some tapenade and a few crackers.  I realize their closest competition is on Valencia Street 3/4 of a mile away, but seriously... on more than a few occasions, I feel like we could have walked to Valencia, had some (vastly more interesting) wine and appetizers, and then walked back to 18th and Castro in the amount of time it would have taken Blush to fill our food order.", "author": "Mike M."}

Others have already covered it, but the service sucks, by American standards.\n\nJust prior to my last visit to Blush, I had just read an essay about how different cultures think differently about time. If you are American and think of time linearly and expect a menu when you walk in, to be asked what you would like to drink shortly after being given the menu, to be asked whether you want another drink after you've finished the first, or to be given a check when you clearly look ready to leave, you may go insane here.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you take the southern European way of viewing time, which is based on completing encounters rather than on sticking to a rigid schedule, you'll be fine. Recognize that you will be served when the staff finishes the conversation they are having with whoever they're catching up with, or when they're through with shuffling things around by the register, and you can retain inner tranquility.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-04", "description": "One of the tricks to understanding Blush is that it is one of the few places in the city--yes, really, the city (note: native San Franciscan writing here)--where your party can get nice wine AND nice Belgian beer on draft AND sit comfortably AND hear one another talk AND get nice nibblies. Not one beer, either, but four (always the same four, which is fine by me): Duvel green label, Chimay white label, La Chouffe IPA, and Maredsous (which at 10% is kind of an event all by itself). Oh yes, and Anchor Steam and Blue Moon for your Uncle Roy from Milwaukee who don't like them thar furrin beers and ain't never had a wine he liked. \n\nThe wine lineup may not be extensive, but it's always good, and having paid silly amounts elsewhere for wine that was merely meh, I appreciate that. A nice Sonoma wine in the vicinity of $8 for a generous pour, in a humanely comfortable setting: go try doing that elsewhere in the Castro, or most of the city. \n\nThe food plates are terrific for what they are -- simple accompaniments to a decent glass of beer or wine. We have done the cheese plates, the fish plates, the oysters,the olives, the tapenade... it's all good. In fact, more than once we have made it a meal, and frankly, it is one of the better places to dine on Castro Street proper if you are not a big eater and are not looking for a major sit-down dinner or do not want a forgettable burger/pizza/etc. The Alsatian pizza and Croque-Monsieurs look good, too (though I'd rather spend my carb count on the beer). \n\nMany Castro Street restaurants are tiny and crowded, with seating that feels cramped and is either by the kitchen or (as happened last night, in an incident that drove us to walk out of a restaurant before ordering after waiting over an hour to get in) near a banging door that blows in an icy draft every minute. In comparison, almost all of the seating in Blush is *comfortable.*  It's a mellow setting that in one small storefront manages to have window seats, a bar, small tables, couches, and a great long table where you can sit absorbed in your beer and your iPad or mingle/chat with others. If it's full, you may not get one of the choice spots, but none of the seating is outright uncomfortable--again, for the Castro, high praise. \n\nThe art is always interesting (even when it is odd, like the blacklight exhibit--unlike another reviewer, I kind of liked that one; it's not like they were twisting my arm to buy the stuff) and the service is personable and knowledgeable without getting in your face. \n\nThe noise level varies, but on a weekend night this is one of the few places that is likely to be comfortable and not over-the-top noisy. On an early weeknight when it's not a major holiday, Blush can be serene, even when full. Last night the music briefly got on a weird jangly techno-something jag... after five minutes my partner asked if the music could be changed, and the server could not have been more courteous or moved more swiftly. (In my fantasies, Blush has a jukebox featuring Edith Piaf and Nina Simone... but at least the music is usually pleasant.)\n\nThere is at least one review suggesting that inebriated blowhards looking for a new perch for their obnoxious behavior will get the message that while they may patronize the establishment, an extended drinking session will not be encouraged. To that I say: thank you. \n\nI do sometimes wish they would surprise me with Delirium Tremens on tap or even sneak in a (gasp) American Belgian, like Damnation or Matilda. But that's a small quibble. This review has been overdue, but a pleasure to finally write.

The server said we had already been drinking so SHE COULD ONLY SELL US BY THE GLASS... If we were near drinking too much why serve us to begin with?\n\nObviously she was trying to get a higher ticket out of us by trying to take advantage - 8 dollars a glass times four, or one bottle for 20 bucks... You do the math...  Not our first time at the rodeo...\n\nThe wine wasn't even that great for 8 bucks a glass.

Kicking back on the couches with your pals for a Friday night workweek debrief, washed down with a $10 glass of tasty Pinot (the Les Carabenes, I believe), is socializing at its best.  I only wish the waiter had been a little less eager to flirt with our entire group--perhaps he was hoping we were drunk enough to get talked into ordering some of their tempting but pricy tapas.\n\nAlso, it was almost too easy to get good seats in here--I can't help but wonder if this place is going to get waaay more popular after it's been open a little longer.", "author": "Wes M."}

I'd made reservations way in advance, so they knew we were coming, but they had one server for the whole place and we all felt really bad for him, bc man were they not prepared.  First off, when we got there, he told us to hold on sec bc they had lost their menus and he had sent someone next door to go make copies.... Okay.  Then when they brought the copies, they had only made 25 and therefore asked us to be careful with spills (PS the copies were made on regular printer paper, and handwritten).  Then they were out of coffee.  Initially when he was serving us our bottomless mimosas, he was making one at a time, so luckily he started just making pitchers which was a lot better.  But lastly, which was prob most unforgivable, every single person got their food completely separately with the first person and last person's arriving probably within 45 mins of each other.

The best part is, it makes for a great spot to grab a drink with the bestie and catch up on life and it also makes for an entertaining date spot with a hottie. Double duty! In order to be deemed a safe-date-spot a place must have good drinks, good eats, plenty of people and activity and some entertainment always helps in case the date is a dud. \nBlush has three distinct areas. You can hang out in the back part at the community table surrounded by racks of wine. Who doesn't want a room like this in their house? Or you can belly up to the bar. Or you can relax and get cozy on the couch. Sometimes there is live music, which can be too loud for the small space, but they are usually pretty talented so more often than not they are forgiven. \nThe wine is good, they always have drink specials and the small plates pair well with the wine.

It was funny because we initially tried to go to Catch to get some oysters, but it was too crowded....and guess what Blush has on the menu? Kumamoto oysters...1/2 dozen for $11! Score!\n\nSide note: Blush has the best use of space I've seen in San Francisco. The layout of the bar allows for SO much seating but manages to still give off that \"cozy\" feel.

Below average wine selection.\n\nI have visited Blush three times now and I have been consistently disappointed. There are, however, certain aspects that I enjoy about this bar. I love the location (love the Castro), enjoy the live music provided on certain nights, and can appreciate the lively vibe of the place. HOWEVER, I can't get over the feeling that the bartenders could really give a s*&t about actually getting me a glass a wine. \n\nThe wine selection has expanded. They do offer a better selection of wine than they did a year or so ago, but it is still rather lacking. \n\nI haven't tried the food here.  But after our last experience here, my girlfriend and I agreed to never step foot in here again, so I guess I won't be tasting the menu. \n\nI don't give up easily on a place (especially a wine bar) I feel like I was supposed to love...but alas, I have given up on Blush.", "author": "Patricia Z."}

The location is excellent as it is in the center of everything in the Castro. Very laid back atmosphere, like a neighborhood bar. They have a pretty good selection of wines and beers. I'm more of a red wine type, so just ordered those all night. Started out with the Malbec, which was good. Ordered small plates of olive tapenade and bruschetta. The pairing went well. Second glass I went with Bordeaux, partner went with a Cabernet. We firgured we'll be staying a while longer so ordered the cheese plate as well. Yum, loved the cheeses and jams. For our last glass, the server recommended some other red wine which I forget the name of.. by this time we were pretty tipsy haha. But it was good! The server really warmed up to us, he started smiling by the end and actually started recommending wines. So I'd say pretty friendly staff. The crowd was eclectic, all sorts. But all seemed pretty happy and enjoying themselves. It's not too loud either, you can carry conversation without screaming. We had a really good time here.

It's classy, fun, well staffed, and just about perfect.\n\nTheir wine selection is varied and unique, plus it's updated by season. Nearly anyone will be able to find a wine here that will satisfy them. The food and snack items are also perfect accompaniments to the wines. Especially nice are the meat and cheese platters. They're a perfect amount for 2-4 people to graze on while sipping away on delicious local and abroad wines.\n\nThe staff is spot-on. They're extremely well informed, and can explain or describe every bottle on the menu. They are all attentive, friendly, mildly flirtatious, and overall eager to assist you in your wine selection. They're more than willing to offer suggestions, or attempt to tailor your drink purchase to your palette and preferences. \n\nInterestingly, for a wine bar, the place is very much not pretentious. It's decor is casual, and inviting. The seating isn't fancy, but nonetheless welcomes you to sit and stay a while with a group of friends. Sometimes light, unobtrusive music is playing. The place never reaches a volume level where normal conversation can't be had.\n\nIf I had to knock Blush, it'd be the cost. Many of their wines are international, and thereby carry an international price. The snacks are also a little more pricey than one would expect. Still, it's a bar, so what do you expect? Plus, the atmosphere and service well out-shadow any negative feelings about price. \n\nTruly, one of the best places in the Castro for friends and drinks.", "author": "Adam G."}

We entered and approached the bar to find the man behind the counter engrossed in bookkeeping, with books and papers spread out on the bar. We stood there for a minute waiting to be acknowledged.  Since he couldn't  deign to lift his head or even mumble a greeting, I picked up the only wine list on the bar/in sight, and began to look at it. It was laying (closed) on the bar near the only patron at the time, whose back was turned and whose drink had already been set in front of him.  Then (suddenly and rather abruptly) as if to \"reprimand\" me for \"taking\" this patron's wine list, the bartender paused from his bookwork to snatch the list from my  hands, slap it  back down on the bar in the spot from where I had picked it up, and, reach under the counter to produce two other identical wine lists, which he again literally slapped down on the counter in front of my husband and me. This was done deftly,  as he never ONCE looked up from his work.... OR SPOKE.\nIt was very pointed, very discourteous, extremely amateur, and a huge hint-and-a-half as to why the place was dead at 5:25 pm.  Needless to say it was a buzz-kill, and we left, just as he seemed to want us to leave.

With absolutely nothing going on in this sudden ghost town we bumped into a sign for a wine bar that read \" Great wine, delicious food and cute bartenders.\" DONE.  We walked in and demanded to see the cute bartenders.  Fully satisfied by their combined adorableness, we looked at the list for .05 seconds and made our second demands known;we want great wine!  OMG delicious! And the decor was so warm and inviting; my guests were happy, I was happy, Sandra Bullock was the happiest.  To top it off, as soon as I took that first delicious sip, I look over and see my long lost friend! What are the odds that someone awesome that you meet in one wine bar (Nectar in burlingame) you will re-connect with in another wine bar?! ( I hate it when people say, \"small world,\" 'cause it is NOT small, but I admit I was thinking it.  \nI didn't have any of the food, but from what I saw, it has to be good! Trust me, I have seen a lot of food.\nWe actually took a cab there and back from the Fillmore area and it was pretty cheap, but I can't speak for parking.  Let's just guess that it might be a pain.  \nYeah, OK, it's a BAR, so If you want more wine you have to go up to, wait for it............THE BAR.

Now, you might want to temper my review with another, because I'm not a big wine officianado. Okay, I'm being modest-- I'm actually well-versed in wine, having had to take several classes and tasting hundreds of bottles as a server in one of the east coast's biggest country club chains. I can wax philosophical about the different vineyards all around the world, including the virtues of the soil, climate and overall practices, which all serve to make the wine in your glass unique (read: marketable). My knowledge is bigger than yours. *pets knowledge* But look, let's not make this all about me. The point is, Blush serves wine that's about on par with all the others in the surrounding neighborhoods. But where it separates is the atmosphere they've created. It's snooty enough in a nouveau sophisticate kind of way but without the caustic venom from the clientele that wine bars such as this will tend to draw. By this I mean that the people here are cool, and the food pairings that the staff suggests are on point with the wine bottle on your table. If you're here, ask for Willem. He knows his stuff and he's just about the nicest guy you could meet in San Francisco.", "author": "H.R. N."}

The two men working the bar were not so much rude as uncaring.  After sitting with an empty glass for 15 minutes and trying to get the attention of one of the staff, I finally tried to flag one of them down as he walked by me.  He looked at me and then walked on.  I would be a little more understanding if he were quite busy, but it was a fairly slow night.  After finally getting another glass of wine, I watched as a table of people spent half an hour trying to get the attention of the servers.  Unfortunately, the two servers were too busy doing something on their cell phones to notice.  After all of this they gave me a tab for 6 glasses of wine when I had only ordered three.  There are far better places to get a glass of wine.", "author": "Brandon J."}

They have a large selection of both white and red wines from throughout the world.  Moreover, they change the wine list regularly, adding new and interesting wines.  I have tried a number of wines from $7 to $15 and find them all interesting and tasty.  Most wine bars in San Francisco have few if any wines below $10, but I can always find one at Blush under $10 that I like.  Blush gives you the opportunity to select from a broad range of wines by the glass.  The bartenders are most helpful in assisting you with your selection by describing the wines that are offered and offering a taste if you are unsure. The bar snacks are also tasty and healthy. \n\nThis is a good place in the Castro where anyone can feel comfortable .......

Most of the customers were seated at the bar, my girlfriend and I were one of like two parties at a table, and we repeatedly had to get the guy's attention (who was drinking and chatting with someone sitting at the bar) to order, get the check, etc. He was nice enough, but seriously, if you see two people sitting and staring at you, with empty glasses and plates in front of them, you might want to check on them.", "author": "Abby S."}

We all settled on Blush since we had never been.\n\nAfter sitting down for like 20 minutes, we finally went to the Bar to place our order and still had to wait even more. There was only one person at the bar and the place was packed, I sincerely hoped someone called out sick and thus the lack of staffing.\n\nWe had the cheese plate and the eggplant dip to go along with our glasses of wine. I ordered a glass of bubbly since I was in the mood for something a little more. However, they had run out, come on, how to you run out of Roerder!!!! I was perturbed, but relaxed, and had a glass of the 5ive Russian pinot which was AMAZING!!!!! Highly recommend this pinot.\n\nIf you at all remember this place from before, they somewhat shotty cafe/crepe/coffee/something place then you will remember the decor, it is oddly similar (as in they did nothing except hang lights from the ceiling and shortened the bar area).\n\nAfter enjoying our drinks and a short time of people watching, we decided it was time to leave. We had to wait longer for our bill to be run up.\n\nThis place is wonderful in the sense that it isn't a bar/club that is typical of the Castro and offers something else if you do not want a hard spirit drink. I also like the fact that they are open until Midnight on Fri/Sat so that you can relax and enjoy.\n\nI truly hope that my poor service experience is just a one time thing. I will be going back because the price is perfect and the assortment of wines is nice and the being open later is better.\n\nIf you want amazing service and great wines - earlier in the day - then I highly recommend Swirl on Castro. The service here rivals Blush but the down part is their wines are more expensive and not a lounge atmosphere, more of a Bevmo, buy and go type place.
