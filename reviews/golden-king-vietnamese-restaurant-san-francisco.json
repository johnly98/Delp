Being the broke college kid that I am, I can actually afford to come here twice a week and sometimes more! The food is simple but very nice. I had one of my TOP 5 best bowls of pho at Golden King. The best part is, during the non busy hours your food comes in like 5 minutes. The Thai Tea is my favorite, never had it before until Golden King and it's my favorite item on the menu. Also their waitress is very nice and does a good job despite often being the only staff member on duty. \n\nDon't be fooled by it's location and modest appearance!

You are just looking for a cheap meal in Chinatown. \nI appreciate their extensive food menu and the pictures of those meals on the menu. However, the quality of the food itself has nothing to appreciate. I had the spicy shrimp with fried rice. When you cook seafood or meat, if you are coating it in a sauce, you still have to season the food with salt and pepper and whatever before you but the sauce on so that the meat itself has some flavor! This is not how food is cooked here so there was not much flavor the shrimp. \nInterestingly enough, their white rice tasted better than their fried rice, ha!", "author": "Angela L."}

I mean there is the Golden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant, Golden King Vietnamese Restaurant and the Golden Star Vietnamese Restaurant all close to each other. After trying Golden Flower, I decided to give Golden King a try. It is located on Clay & Walter U so it's in the heart of Chinatown and almost opposite to Golden Star.\n\nAt the peak lunch hour on a Saturday the place had only 2 tables full, so it seemed pretty empty. I decided to get the Vietnamese style beef stew noodle soup ($9) to-go. As expected I had to pay in cash as it was cash only. After ordering it was a short 10-minute wait and I was on my way.\n\nI got two containers, a container for the broth and another small Chinese takeout container for the noodles. The broth was really good and the noodles were fine. Overall this was pretty good.\n\nPrice-wise it was in-line with what you would pay at other Golden restaurants in the area. I'm going to have to come back and try some stuff of their menu as I liked what I got. A strong 4 stars is how I'd rate this place.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The remaining meat was doled out in a generous portion.

It's been a good, spacious meet up spot for hang outs and pho. The only thing to get is the beef pho (#1). Every time that I've been here has been relatively good. \n\nThe experience with the bun bo hue really had me unimpressed with their service and mentality as a restaurant. I had ordered it because it was something new from their menu. When the bowl came out, I saw a lot of spice particles around the edge of the bowl. That was already a bad sign to me because it meant that the broth was a dry mix. It was also a lot of hot oil. Traditionally BBH has spicy oil topped off but this seemed excessive. The worst part was when I stirred up the noodles, the bowl was practically empty. The noodles were all broken. I had asked if that's how it's usually served. The owner was nice and said that I don't have to feel uncomfortable for asking about it. She had asked the cooks at the bottom if they had had more noodles or whatever. For a second, there was confusion and they took a while to come up with more noodles. I was already planning on ordering my usual and sending back what they had given, but they came up with a smaller bowl of just noodles. i had expected them to redo the entire bowl. I ate it because I was hungry, but I was super unhappy. The pig's foot that was in my noodle, was practically inedible because of the hairs and the size. I would have expected better quality since we're so close to the source, Chinatown. They also charged full price, showing me that they didn't value my experience. \n\nThey earn a star for the pho and a star for having a good attitude when I complained.

I am polite, patient and give good tips.  So why were my last two take-out orders amiss?\n\nAmiss Nos. 1 - I ordered the #45 (Bun Cha Gio Bo Nuong grilled lemon grass beef and imperial rolls with vermicelli)  and evidently you did not have beef that day (strange), so you offered me the option of chicken or pork.  Me not being a supporter of the slaughter of those cute little, albeit VERY INTELLIGENT pink fuzzy things we humans call pigs, I opted for the chicken (and yes, I am aware of the inhumane treatment of chickens too).\n\nWhen I got back to my office, I eagerly opened the lunch tray and to my surprise, I found that I did NOT get what I ordered.  WTF?  \n\nI was really looking forward to the imperial rolls - it is the only time I allow myself to splurge on something fried; imagine my disappointment.\n\nIn thinking more about what I received - I remember just 15 minutes before I was studying your menu and thought perhaps you may have substituted my order of #45 for the # 47(Bun Ga Xao Sa (Tom, Dau Hu) - Stir Fried Onion Lemon Grass Chicken With Vermicelli choice of shrimp or fried bean cake), and then I was further disappointed in realizing that not only was I short-changed once, but twice - I didn't get the shrimp or fried bean cake (I would have been fine with either).\n\nOh well - I dealt with it and ate what I did get.\n\nAmiss Nos. 2\n\nToday I went to Big Apple Grocer and purchased myself a BIG soup bowl so I can indulge in tasty soups from all the tasty restaurants along Kearny Street and in China town.\n\nI was short on time and recalled that I had made notes of your menu on my blackberry - so while on the way back to work I called and placed my order for the #20 (Pho Ga & Tai chicken & slices of beef rib eye noodle soup).  The nice woman who took my order repeated what I ordered and confirmed \"the chicken & beef with rice noodles\" - I said yes, exactly.\n\nI picked up my order, even left a $2 tip (for pick-up to-go items, I think that is a generous tip).  I went back to work, cleaned my pretty new soup bowl and then went through the process of placing the items of the #20 in my bowl.  To my SURPRISE, what I found was about 16 oz of very delicious broth, a small portion of incredibly thinly sliced beef and about the size of my index finger of shredded chicken, 3 thinly sliced peppers and bean sprouts.  In addition, I asked before leaving for chili sauce and was informed that everything was in the bag.  Hah, jokes on me because what was supposed to have been mixed with chili was actually only the plum sauce and no sriracha (and everyone who knows me knows I love me some sriracha).  \n\nAgain, I ask; WTF?  \n\nGolden King I really wanted to like you - but for now, I think I will continue my quest for delicious tasty soups and search elsewhere.  Maybe next time I'll go to Have a Rice Day for some delicious noodle soup (even they are more generous with the amount of beef they put in their soups).\n\nMinor update - not only was my Pho disappointing, but evidently the soup it is made with MSG - I know because I have allergic reactions to MSG.  So now 30 minutes later I am I sitting at my desk with a bloated belly and having difficulty in breathing through my nose.  Argh!

I usually get extra tendon because they cook them perfectly - gelatinous and perfectly chewy.  The beef stew noodle soup is good too but I found it to be a little too salty at times.  The Five Spice Chicken Noodle Soup is another classic.  Go here...you won't be dissapointed!!! Total bill is usually $13 for two people.", "author": "Mia B."}

My favorite dish is Grilled Pork Chop Rice Plate . YUM The pork is actually in steak form, not just pieces of pork that's grilled . The Pho is pretty good here . The soup is savory and the noodles are always perfect . They have an option where you can get pho noodles and the pork chop . YUMMY ! Their 5 spiced chicken is good too . VERY VERY tasty .", "author": "Jenny Y."}

So far, I've never left disappointed. I stopped going to Golden Star, which is across the street. This place is more affordable and the quality is just as good. The portions are just right. I always order a small bowl, and that stuffs me. This restaurant is pretty big, and I've never waited more than a few minutes for a table. Best of all, you get your own table!!! No sharing tables and elbowing strangers! That's a feat in Chinatown. The best part is the 15 minute walk back to the office because it helps me digest.", "author": "Wendy L."}

But, for some reasons, maybe because of the recession.. they have been limiting on the food they serve including the  noodle.. #1.. It used to be really good with plenty of meat. The soup has also been decreasing in quality.. it wasn't so tasty anymore and the price has also been raised.

The vermicelli, which I normally dislike, was also surprisingly good, even if I don't like the sauce that comes with it. The tea was good, and the service is wonderful.\n\nGreat meal, good prices, and the place looks nice. This is about as good as a pho restaurant can get! I always leave so freaking full.

WRONG total opposite. I ordered a large pho, and they gave me what seemed to be an endless bowl. Okay, but then the pho wasn't that good either. Service was rather bad. The waitress kept coming back and bothering us, and she also got her co-workers to do the same. They assumed that since we were teenagers, we didn't have any money. They also assumed that we were gonna run out the second we were done. Big mistake there. Well I found the service here to be the WORST. But two stars only because their pho was okayy. The prices were cheap, but hey service matters a lot to me. I don't think I'm ever going to come back here unless it's the only place open.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Even better than their delicious neighbor Golden Star (in my opinion - my girlfriend prefers Golden Star).

Want something really filling for under $10? Go to Golden King. They have the one of the best Vietnamese food you could get in Chinatown (Golden Flower is the other place in CT; they're both connected somehow). I usually order their #43 vermicelli & pork dish or #1 pho house special. I've also had their yellow curry, porkchop &rice dish; they're all delicious. Serving size is pretty good for what you pay for. However, their prices have increased since I've first started coming here. The wait time for your food is pretty fast & service is alright for an Asian restaurant. This place gets packed around lunchtime, but I usually come here in the mid-/late-afternoons when they're slower. It's also pretty spacious & a bit less busy compared to Golden Flower. Don't forget to have cash in hand; they're cash only!", "author": "BrendaJoy G."}

Since I don't like ordering Pho all the time, i usually go for the rice plates and they are pretty good.  Curry beef or curry chicken or some other rice plate, and vermicelli w egg roll and pork are good and it fills me up.  Prices are cool with me since its usually almost the same prices elsewhere.\n\nService it alright, sometimes i don't like sharing tables with others. But with a 1 hour lunch break, i don't want to waste time waiting.  But if you don't wanna share and there are no tables open, you gonna have to wait a little bit, but shouldn't be a long wait because they usually try to rush you to finish by giving you your check even though your technically not done yet.  \n\nIf your working in the financial district, parking is not a problem since you guys walk.  But, for me coming from outside Chinatown, if you get lucky there s some meters open but .25 for 6 minutes is not really that great, so sometimes parking at the garage right across from the restaurant is the way to go, just be done before an hour so you just pay $2.50 for parking.", "author": "Jason C."}

Friendlier service today, until their friends/relatives got there (then they were too busy chatting on the other side). The soup was extremely bland today. There was no taste besides from the taste of boiled salt and water. I had to add hoi sin sauce today. And unlike the last time, there were more noodles today and the rare slices of steak to the side were of very good quality. This time the colors did not differ from top to bottom of the plate. I also ordered the rare steak w/ lemon juice and it was good. I've had better though, and the portion wasn't the biggest. However, they were large pieces of steak, unlike some other places that has them chopped/sliced up. My burning question still remains: is this beef the same as the ones in my noodle soup? If so, then I had been misled from the beginning! The price for the lemon juice over steak was only $8.05, which is the cheapest I've seen it so far. But most of the noodles are $7.05, which is more than the average Vietnamese place.", "author": "Elaine H."}
