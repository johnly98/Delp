{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-27", "description": "A former staple in the community, this north beach pizza was often visited by city kids like me who had just finished track practice over at kezar, mid Friday night football game down at the stadium or the pro am games at the gym literally across the street or even just mobbin' on haight after school. But due to the culture change of this city and the unfortunate changeover of NorthBeach's management, this establishment has gone to shit. \n\nWalked in at 830pm on a Friday night to grab a slice or two with friends, and this PIZZA place, that advertises and supposedly serves PIZZA by the slice, did not have any pizza available. How on a Friday night during football season you have no pizza in a pizza by the slice shop is beyond me, but no problem, ask when slices would be available gentleman at the front says 10minutes. Step outside and wait 15 minutes and walk back in, still no pizza. Other delivery drivers and patrons alike now are waiting at the counter as the manager tells me only pepperoni slices will be coming out. We wait another 15 minutes and finally I see a pizza come out the oven. Awesome, the pizza chef puts the pizza in the spinning display case as the manager is working on the register. Patiently our now band of brothers type line of customers waits as he fumbles through delivery orders and receipts. \n\nNot much place in the establishment to stand so as I am directly in front of the register staring at the now spinning pizza, I await the managers gaze so we can continue our transaction. Not only did this unprofessional amateur ignore me, he proceeds to brush by, walk directly past me to leave the register as I'm standing there, to walk to the back and fumble up some other mess. I, at that moment, a patron who waited patiently, no attitude, quiet just hoping for a slice of pizza, hit my shit experience limit. After another few minutes, As there is now clearly a line and no one at the register I audibly say \"yoo I been standing here waiting 45 minutes and there is now literally a pizza spinning in my face. Can I get a slice or what?!\"\n\nManager has the nerve to ask me to wait again and continues to ignore customers in the restaurant. He finally comes back and asks me what I want. At this point, it is pretty clear that the manager or register attendant who I really hope is not an owner, gave no shits about the type of experience his customers had. At this point I buy all the slices of pepperoni for our group, and as I walk out with our full pizza, the manager, not sure from where exactly, pulls out other slices with a variety of toppings to place in the display case. At this point I just wanted food and to get back to our football game, but it would be a disservice to my community and all the good people who used to enjoy this establishment if I did not comment on the lack of empathy, service, logic, and operational aptitude.

In no small part because I've passed by this particular location countless times over the years.  Yet, for whatever reason, it didn't seems like any of my friends or family had actually ordered pizzas from here.  So, of course it would make perfect sense that my relatives would suddenly ask me to bring over some pizzas from here, right?\n\nWhile I'd always known this North Beach Pizza was small, I never knew it was THIS small (blink as you drive by and you'll miss it).  Their spot in North Beach may be an actual restaurant (from the photos, at least), but this is definitely more of a grab-and-go/delivery type of spot.  Though, given the neighborhood's parking situation, that might not be the worst thing...\n\n-- COIT TOWER - Fresh Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami, and Italian Sausage...$31.35 (large)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/north-beach-pizza-san-francisco-4?select=NC3-4Z-lvcMYg9kDaDlnAg)\nEssentially a meat lover's pizza...but with mushrooms.  As a whole, the meats were decently plentiful and flavorful.  However, everything else fell short - some of the mushrooms were a little mealy, the sauce was super generic (read: not good), and the crust was very thick and tasteless.\n\n-- CABLE CAR - Creamy Garlic Sauce, Chicken, Bacon Pieces, Fresh Tomatoes, Green Onions...$27.40 (medium)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/north-beach-pizza-san-francisco-4?select=kEMwJs8JKmOKREdY4hU3hA)\nThe better of the two, but it still underwhelmed.  Though the sauce wasn't bad, and despite the chicken and bacon, the dough sucked up all of the other flavors with how thick and bland it was.  What's more, the tomatoes made both the taste and texture of the pizza really watery/wet.\n\nConsidering how they have a number of locations around the Bay Area (though, their site only lists three), North Beach Pizza is practically a chain...except not nearly as good.  I don't recall Domino's or Pizza Hut being worse, but Round Table is definitely better by leaps and bounds.  Plus, while their menu does have a wider array of options to choose from, the prices here are notably high, especially for the quality you're getting.\n\nIn any case, the silver lining to all of this is that I now know someone who has tried these guys, but really, that's about it.

Although boasting awards about their pizza, this joint has not proven its award-winning taste to me. In fact, I think their pizzas are a long way from that. \n\nI walked in to order a slice of pesto pizza and a cup of water. Because they had no water, I ended up ordering a sprite instead. (Total cost: $5; paid by card)\n\nFirst of all, who doesn''t have plain, non-sparkling water? So instead, I opted for a sprite, which was lukewarm after removing it from the fridge. That definitely puzzled me because coming out warm defeats the purpose of putting it into a fridge in the first place. I figured this may be because the fridge wasn't operating properly. Regardless, that was not acceptable. When I opened the can and took a sip, I realized I forgot to wipe the lid, which tasted contaminated. By then, I lost my appetite, fearing I consumed a pathogenic bacteria. Needless to say, my opinion of this place was not starting off on a good note. \n\nThen, I tried the pesto pizza, which seemed as if it was sitting in the rotating glass case for far too long. It didn't taste fresh & the ingredients tasted poor quality for $3.50/slice. The crust tasted stale & I didn't like how it wasn't heated before it was served to me in a small, white pizza box that was stained with grease when I lifted the pizza to try it. I think, despite the distance, you're better off driving to Cheeseboard in Berkeley to get a better tasting pizza for a cheaper price (plus, if you're lucky, free entertainment). Regardless, I was disappointed by the taste of the pizza & should have read through reviews prior to trusting my gut & walking into this place.

If reception cannot get ahold of who ordered the food, they are instructed to sign, and take the food. The person who the food is for will call back and add a tip if they wish. I guess as of late the delivery people don't like that idea, and will actually leave with the food. When the customers read the email from reception saying their food is here for a CLIENT MEETING, and come downstairs to see nothing, it is a horrible experience, and makes everyone involved very angry.

And as my tastes grew finer with sophistication and class, I no longer needed mounds of cheese on dough and the spicy aftertaste of medium-grade pepperoni and sausage.  So my dedication waned...\n\nTonight, this Thanksgiving Eve and stressful work day, I ventured to North Beach after many,many years of an absence. \n\nAnd it can be a whole 'nother many, many years before I return again.\n\nTwo simple requests: 1. thin crust; 2. parmesan and peppers to augment what I remembered to be an overpowering blandness of mozzarella.  What did I get?  Only the first.  Why?  THEN I remembered that North Beach seemed to always have this issue.  So, while the pizza wasn't all that awful, peppers would have been lovely.\n\nHere's one thing that I'm happy about though - North Beach has joined the Seamless revolution.  So, I can order and not have to deal with a single person over there on Stanyan. Part of the reason why I stopped ordering from them (other than there being better options, I soon learned) is that they just weren't very easy to get along with.

Order for delivery, and you have a crapshoot. They deliver by driving around the city, and you cannot guarantee that your pizza will be the first out of the trunk.\n2) Order the pizza with pesto sauce. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Just do it.\n3) Order the pizza. Period. This is a pizza joint, people, and that's what you should realistically expect them to make well. Period.\n\nThe pesto pizza is perfect. Period. Finito. Let's move on.\n\nOr not.\n\nThe sauce is really garlicky and flavorful, and the pizza was piping hot when I arrived to pick it up at this location. Not being a fan of tomato sauce to begin with, I was thrilled to see they offered this green and garlicky option. The toppings were plentiful, and they must use some special dough for the crust because it actually tasted like bread - special bread, that is. You know, like it was ciabatta or something.\n\nThe pizza itself is a tad pricey, and the toppings can add up if you get the pesto sauce and a couple additional toppings. However, to me it's totally worth it, and also note that inside the shop they have flyers, which have coupons for $1 off a small, $2 off a medium, and $3 off a large.\n\nAnyway, five stars for both this and Eleven Madison Park? \"Blasphemy! What could they possibly have in common?\" you may ask. They're good at what they do, and in this case, what North Beach Pizza does is pizza.", "author": "Audrey J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-25", "description": "I walk past this place on a daily basis.  Today I was enticed by the pizza by the slice.  I was hungry, on my way to class, and it was quick.  \n\n$5.50 for a slice of sausage pizza and and a 20oz bottle of lemonade.  The lemonade was very tasty.  It came from a bottle so North Beach Pizza had nothing to do with the processing or taste of the lemonade.  The sausage pizza on the other hand was completely not edible.  \n\nI believe that they purposely undercook some pizzas because they expect that they will be sitting under the heat lamps for some time.  What was served to me was garbage.  I walked outside and sit on the bench and had a drink of lemonade.  I planned on tearing into the slice of pizza and then heading to class.  I took a huge slice of doughy pizza which I immediately spit out while trying to avoid vomiting.  This slice of pizza was nothing that I expected.  \n\nI've worked as a server in a restaurant now for 10 years.  I am a firm believer that if you clean a plate that you should have to pay for a plate.  You were given a mouth and if you have a problem you need to speak up, especially when it comes to food.  I've had all types of customers; the good, the bad, the pain in the ass, etc.  At the end of the day it's those customers that allow me to have a job, and I should go out of my way to please them.  \n\nIn turn I might be the easiest person to wait on.  I enjoy a variety of foods, and I've had dishes that I didn't quite care for.  Usually this happens when I'm trying something new and feeling adventurous and didn't ask for a detailed list of all the ingredients in a dish.  Restaurant and bar staff usually find me a pleasure to deal with.\n\nRather than toss my doughy pizza in the garbage and walk away never trying North Beach Pizza again, I walked back in to the counter where I received my pizza from and told the asian girl at the counter that this pizza had in fact been undercooked and was no good.  If no one brings to to the attension of the employees how can the problem be remedied?  \n\nSince I had in fact had the last slice of sausage pizza I asked if I could exchange the slice I had for a mushroom pizza (which looked cooked fully).  Rather than just exchange the slice of pizza she wanted to argue with me that I took a bite out of the pizza.  I was tempted to go outside and fish up the spit out piece of pizza and directly place it in her hand.   She did however offer to toss the undercooked slice into the oven and I could wait for it to finish cooking.  Needless to say she totally missed the point of me stopping in for a quick already made slice of pizza (I simply did not have time to sit around and wait for this slice to finish cooking).  I honestly do not think that I should have to wait for pizza by the slice at all, it's one of those grab and go kinds of things.\n\nRather than staying and arguing and making a big grand scene, I handed her back the slice of pizza and told her, \"Fine, i will give you the pizza back and just chose to not come back.\"   She seemed perfectly content with that as I walked out of the door.  So be it!   \n\nObviously this location has way too much money because they care absolutely nothing about the guest.  I believe that the slice of pizza that I took a bite out of cost me $3.50 out of pocket that I will never receive back.  That's a small price to pay for the lesson that I learned today about how North Beach takes care of their guest.  Who knows, had the pizza of actually been cooked and tasty I would've stopped in 3X a week for a slice and lemonade ($16.50 weekly X 52 weeks = $806 dollar a year that North Beach Pizza will not be collecting from me).  \n\nKudos counter girl on a job well done.", "author": "Daniel P."}

Now, at this point, you've finally got yourself a damn fine pizza, and HOT!  And while it may look like a waifish thin-cruster, it's actually extremely dense (both cheese and crust).  But by this time you've gone as mad with hunger as Leland Palmer, and you've inhaled 4 slices like a little lamb eating so much ivy.   And if the show is weird on an empty stomach, that's nothing compared to watching it through the dream-haze of a pizza-induced semi-coma.  \n\nIn other words, dense, well-made, but it takes too long to get anywhere and the night inevitably ends with bizarre dreams.  Wait, am I talking about the show or the pizza now?  Maybe, in a Lynchian twist, the show IS the pizza...\n\nAnyway, if they deliver it punctually next time, I'll totally bump this to 4 stars.  Although maybe I should be ordering from the Taraval location instead?  Note that Stanyan is the only North Beach that's delivery-only.\n\n(Update 10/27/09: I tried these guys again now that I live about 4 times closer.  Still slow, and not as good as other options in the nabe).", "author": "Wes M."}

The pie itself suffers from too much toppings (cheese especially I think) that cause the bottom of the crust to get very soggy very quickly, if it doesn't already arrive soggy. I appreciate the attempt to put a lot of yummy stuff on top of the pizza, but the whole thing winds up mushy and impossible to eat with your hands- a fork and knife are usually necessary. I like the sausage they use and they tend to be generous with the garlic (which I love), but it's been so inconsistent that I really have stopped ordering from there. In general not a bad idea to stop eating delivery pizza... it helps the waistline.

The pizza was ok-ish at best. The sauce was very bland, as a matter of fact we added spices, salt and pepper to our pieces to make them taste like something. The slices were also very limp. \n\nHonestly, I wasn't expecting a pizza from Shakespeare (Columbia, MO), but I was certainly hoping for something better than what we got, even more since it was far from being a cheap pizza. \n\nMaybe it was an off-night, but I was greatly unimpressed. \n\nOn the plus side, ordering it over the phone was very easy and hassle free. I thought I'd mention is since many people seem to have had bad experiences ordering, we didn't. Phone service was friendly, easy and quick.", "author": "Willow K."}

I am downright smitten with the Barbary Coast Special at North Beach Pizza. It comes with chicken, green onion, red onion, and (drum roll please...) bacon! Bacon makes everything better and bbq sauce doesn't suck. The combo is out of this world. I have a theory that they mix the bbq sauce into their tradtional sweet, tangy homemade pizza sauce (or maybe they also make the bbq sauce from scratch and the recipes bear some similarity) and that's what you get underneath the just-right blanket of cheese and scattering of meats and onions. For their other pizzas, see other reviews. I don't know anything about the other pizzas. I don't cheat on the chicken. \r\nFYI- I can vouch for their veg lasagna. It is a fairly generous serving- two large rectangles side-by-side, smothered in marinara and cheeses. Mmmm...and the salad that comes with it (for an extra dollar or two) is a pretty big side salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and carrots. I like this location a lot better than the Grant Street store.

We were told that it would be there in a few minutes and another half an hour later the doorbell finally rang. Forgetting our frustration about the ridiculous wait and the fact that the delievery guy had no parmasean or peppers with him, we anxiously dove into the pizza only to find that it was barely edible. It was obvious that theyd completely forgot about our pizza and rather then making us another one, they took the one that had been sitting there that hour and a half, re-covered it with cheese and reheated it. So the crust of the pizza was the only part that was cut. And despite this, it was still cold! And our Diet Cokes that we'd ordered with it, turned out to be the splenda kind.

They call to give you a 5 minute warning so you can meet them outside.  They allow you to pre-pay the tip and everything way in advance.  The pizza comes hot and the soda cans come cold!  I will never order a large pizza order from anyone else in the city, the North Beach Pizza guys rock!", "author": "Shannon N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-17", "description": "OK, so good thing about this place is that they deliver til real late, like 2am and if you wanted, you could order one of their specialty fancy pizzas.  You know, the ones that have stuff on pizza that shouldn't be on pizza...like asparagus, or pheasant, or buffalo meat...you know, crazy ingredients like that.  So we order a large specialty pizza (can't remember the name but it had chicken and BBQ sauce).  It was like $25 which was pretty high for a fancy pizza and when it came it didn't seem fully cooked since the middle was all soggy.  Plus, the guy that I talked to on the phone to make the order was a complete stoner so I was worried that I might be getting a totally wrong order.  Plus the pizza wasn't that great, kinda tasted like Dominos.  I would've given this place 2 stars but I'll leave it at 3 since they deliver til late.  Good for those stay-in nights getting really high off bong hits and needing that late night munchy food.", "author": "David C."}

When it arrived it cost $2 more than it said on the website and it was just a handful of ravioli. They tasted good, but I was still hungry! Either lower the price or increase the portion.

'edible' meaning nothing special with a LOT of drawbacks!   GREEAASSSSSYYYYYY!! HELLLO PEOPLE...Learn to make a pizza that doesn't deteriorate your cardboard box! Soggy if it sits for more than 30seconds.  Delivery is dependable...can't hate on them there.  1 extra star for the bald headed troll stunt double delivery guy...he obviously has kids to feed.  help him out and get a mercy pizza if you're desperate.", "author": "jim a."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-14", "description": "Pretty good for the most part, but the pizzas are nothing spetacular.  I do like their large selection of pastas that are pretty cheap and tasty.  My favorite is the tortellini with ham and cream sauce.  Buffelo wings decent but overpriced.  The only thing is it takes about an hour (or more depending on how busy they are) for your food to be delivered to you (once my pizza was lukewarm when it got to me), so might not be the best option if you're starving and want something fast.", "author": "N T."}
