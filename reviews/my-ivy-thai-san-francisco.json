Foods we had were a mixed bag in quality. First, the red curries were very pedestrian, not much flavor, wouldn't reorder (and I LOVE good red curry). \n\nThe Thai steak salad we ordered both days and it was probably 4-stars for this area. Great flavor, enough for 2 to split with other items. \n\nAlso had the Pad See Ew noodles, with pork. THESE were delicious and a generous portion. Pork was cooked perfectly, noodles tasty and not much oil, vegetables delicious. Fair price. \n\nWould return for more noodles and salad.", "author": "T J."}

Seriously. Luxuriant with an indulgent amount of chopped peanuts on top (photo: http://bit.ly/2I3k9DD). I could take that little gravy boat and pour it directly into my mouth. I probably would have if I was at home alone in front of the TV watching something on the Food Network like \"The Pioneer Woman\" where Ree cheerily makes cookies out of caramel corn and peanut butter. But alas, I am watching my calorie intake, so the peanut sauce came with the $11.95 Param which was a plate of steamed spinach and broccoli (photo: http://bit.ly/2Jz75mr).\n\nIt was delicious if somewhat overpriced given that it was hardly an effort on the part of the chef. No tofu please. Having the sauce on the side at least allowed me to dip the veggies gingerly without overdoing it, no small feat. To complete my dinner, I ordered the $9 Fresh Spring Rolls, which were well put together with lettuce, spinach, basil, mint, vermicelli noodles, tofu, and carrot slivers wrapped in rice paper accompanied by guess what... yes, peanut sauce only it was on the plate in a pool for the rolls to sit on (photo: http://bit.ly/2KpvaNS). It also had a touch of chili to give the rolls a bit of a kick. Pretty healthy choices, huh. I can try the Pad Thai and Duck Curry next time.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...healthy selections made especially delicious by their peanut sauce\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...modern space, not that big\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite nice and friendly\nTOTAL - 4 stars...My Ivy is Your Ivy and Your Ivy is My Ivy", "author": "Ed U."}

They seem to be mostly a take-out place; when our group of 5 arrived around noon, the restaurant itself was almost empty and there were plenty of seats, but there were a lot of people coming in to pick up take-out orders during the time that we were there. \n\nThe ambiance is quite nice and the area is clean and well-maintained. Service was on the slow side, and it was especially frustrating that the other 4 people in my group got their dishes super fast (within 5-10 minutes) but it took over 20 minutes for my pad thai to come out, so there was an awkward period where everyone else was eating. The pad thai itself ($10.25 on the lunch menu, with choice of chicken or prawns) was decent, but I thought the portion size was a bit on the small side and it didn't have as much flavor as other pad thai dishes that I've gotten. I also wish there were more peanut pieces for more of a crunchy texture.", "author": "Amy C."}

Maybe one day I'll go check them out since they're not far from me, and fresher is always better. Today is not that day though! Suckered in by the promise of free, quick delivery, I hit \"order\" and went for it.\n\nOne look at \"Lychee duck\" and I knew I had to try it, too. And Tom Kha soup *gush*. I love Thai food :D. My staple Pad Thai rounded out the order.\n\nSo do I start with good news or bad news? Uh, I'm feeling pretty good...let's do good news!\nThe Lychee duck is DELICIOUS, just like it sounds. Duck is already amazing; soak it in lychee water and it only gets better. Of course it's not like this is a particularly complex dish, but it sure is tasty.\n\nTom Kha was decent but a bit middle of the road. Should be a little more savory in my opinion.\n\nWould not order the pad thai again. I ordered it spicy and it was totally mild, which is excusable as pad thai is not traditionally served spicy. It was also super bland. Ho hum. \n\nOh, as if you needed another reason to love Yelp and Eat24, I tried to order this first through Caviar...where the prices are inexplicably more than a dollar higher on every item I looked at...AND they threw on a $5 service fee before tip! Nah. I ordered with Yelp, applied a generous tip, and my total was STILL less than Caviar was BEFORE tip. \n\nOh, and speed of delivery was definitely solid.\n\nIt's disappointing that they're not open late, and with the other good thai food in the area, I probably won't go back here on my own. But, if I end up here with friends or something, I won't be disappointed!", "author": "Chris S."}

If it weren't for the speedy delivery to prevent me from getting 'hangry', I wouldn't have ordered from this restaurant to begin with. \n\nAfter seeing the other reviews prior to receiving my order, I lowered my expectations knowing that it wouldnt be great, just fast. \n\nMy 4 dishes were delivered within 30 minutes as expected. Surprisingly, my soup was still hot enough to soften the noodles it came with once I poured them together. \n\nI ordered the following:\n2 tom yum rice noodle soups\nPad see ew\nPapaya salad \n\nThe tom yum soup reminds me a bit of pho noodle with the tomato base. It was a bit sour and tangy with a little too much sweetness. I prefer my tom yum spicy, tart and sour. \n\nThe pad see ew was on, but it doesnt taste authentic. As other reviews have stated, it has a 'california' flair to it. I eat food pretty bland, but I must saw this dish didnt have the appropriate flavors I was hoping for. \n\nI actually havent had the papaya salad yet since I was too full from the other dishes. It did look pretty standard and its hard to go wrong with fresh salad, however I did smell the salad and could tell there was a ton of fish sauce. I do not recommend ordering this to the office! :)\n\nOverall, food is decent, but not authentic and definitely not the best thai in SF.

You'll have to head towards the Tenderloin (at Lers Ros) or Inner Richmond (at Marnee Thai) to get the traditional flavors you expect from Thai food.\n\nI was in the mood for some light and healthy salad and the mango salad filled the craving. I was digging around for more grilled prawns, but they were generous enough to put two in there. (omg) Hmm. Yes, you can make better salad at home and for $9, there wasn't much flavor to it except lime and fish sauce. The chicken lettuce wraps are a great low carb snack, but the only dominant flavor in the sauce is Hoisin. The tom kha soup is passable.\n\nThe amiable service is welcomed, especially when I'm exhausted from my core40 workout, conveniently located one block away.

Tom Yum noodle soup $10.  I really wanted Tom Yum soup but it was not on their menu but later, I found it on their printed take out menu!  I really didn't like this soup.\nHubby usually hates this soup because he finds it too sour.  The soup here was too sweet (Really, who makes a SWEET Tom Yum soup?) and not sour enough - it is per Hubby, who doesn't even like this dish in general.  Would not order again.  And, the soup came AFTER our entrees arrived.  There was a lot of chicken pieces in it and lots of noodles, the thin rice noodle kind.  Should've tried the Angel wings instead.\n\n2. Crispy chicken with egg fried rice, $9.  The chicken had a nice crispy crust and wasn't bad, the rice looked and tasted like plain white rice with some egg mixed into it.  I have to say the chicken is better than that at Chabaa on Irving (their food has gone downhill).\nI would try this again.\n\n3. Green Curry chicken, $10.50.  The sauce was so thin, it was like a bowl of soup, extremely watery.  Some vegts in it, occasional eggplant, chicken.  But, I thought it lacked flavor and Hubby was surprised it had more heat in it for a \"mild\" dish.  I wouldn't order this again. A small bowl of white Jasmine rice to accompany this was $2.00.\nI prefer the curry dishes at Chaya in West Portal instead. \n\n4. Thai fried rice - $9.  Was OK.  \n\nOver all, food wasn't up to my standards.  Hands down, I would rather spend the extra money and go to Marnee Thai and even Osha Thai's food tastes better in my opinion even 'tho it's a chain.", "author": "Ry T."}

I had to throw the entire dish away. If I had eaten there I would have sent it back to the kitchen. I did not taste garlic chili or basil and have no idea what the sauce was.

The service can be slow sometimes during the lunch rush, but if you order via phone you can just walk on over and it'll be ready instantly. There's no place to wait inside so when it's crowded it's best to just get in and get out.\n\n+ Fave Eats:\n-BBQ chicken & papaya salad - comes with rice and a side of sweet and sour sauce; one of the best lunch dishes here in my opinion. Though there are times when the salad tastes like they put too much fish sauce/lime.\n-Pad thai w/ your choice of meat/tofu\n-Lemon grass chicken w/ veggies and rice\n\nThe curries are just okay in my opinion. They don't give you very much of the vegetables. Also, I can barely detect the \"spiciness\" that some of their dishes indicate, maybe our definitions are not the same seeing as how I love sichuan/korean/mexican food to the point of having to pop an omeprazole before heartburn sets in.

That said, the atmosphere was still fine, as the lighting was good and the restaurant looked like it had been recently remodeled.  There were some beautiful modern fixtures and art, and the tables were cleanly set. Top 40 hits played from a radio, which sounded a bit scratchy, but at least they were making an effort. \n\nThe service was fast and a bit rushed; it was only an hour before closing. The server was friendly though and was very accommodating of my requests for vegetable substitutions and fried tofu. We ordered crispy spring rolls to start, followed by pad see ew and pumpkin curry, with a side of white rice. \n\nI was surprised to find when I took a sip of water that the glasses were plastic. Dining from plastic isn't what I would call magical, as I don't even use plastic cups at home. I dislike the lack of weight and clinking sound, and the odd mouthfeel. Maybe this makes me a snob?\n\nThe spring rolls were perfectly crisp and had a nice mixture of vermicelli and vegetables inside. I really enjoyed the sour sauce that accompanied them too, so much so that I was using it as a dip for the crunch rice noodles they sprinkled on the plate for garnish. It was so tasty I could have drank it! The spring rolls were larger than usual, so I felt almost full after eating two of them. You could easily order them as a meal, so it was a good value. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we had to suffer through a commercial break (radio), which was a mood killer. The music returned just in time for our entr\u00e9es. The pad see ew was prepared with carrots, instead of broccoli, as I had requested, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, the noodles were very overcooked and stuck together, like they had been in sitting in water for too long after taken off boil. The portion was huge, but we barely ate it because of the noodles and the beef, which was tough and chewy. I would NOT recommend this dish.\n\nThe pumpkin curry was delicious. The curry base had the right amount of spice, was rich and creamy, and full of flavor. I ate tons of rice just to have more curry sauce. I enjoyed the pumpkin and veggies in the curry too, although they were cut in very large pieces. It would be easier to enjoy if the veggies were more bite-sized, especially since chopsticks are the best for cutting things smaller. \n\nOverall, My Ivy Thai seems like it has potential to be a good restaurant. The staff is sweet, the curry is tasty, and the interior is polished. There is some real work that needs to be done in terms of food consistency and attention to detail. And they need to invest in a music service, or at least stream a commercial-free channel!", "author": "Mars W."}

Just a couple of people were seated. So service was fairly quick (just one person was manning the phone, serving tables and taking our orders). We had two dishes, an appetizer, and two deserts and liked the deserts best.\n\nThe appetizer, Golden Calamari, was our least favorite. The calamari was tough, and was served under a glaze of a too sweet Thai smoked chili paste. For calamari, less would have been more: they should have been served straight up with the sauces on the side for dipping if needed. And the quality of the calamari itself could really been improved by not overcooking them.\n\nThe Pineapple Fried Rice was good. Kind of a Singapore curry flavor going on, with slices of chicken, and chunks of pineapple with onions and cashews, but we did not have an \"OMG, this is amazing\" kind of moment. We had such a large serving that we took most of this home.\n\nWe also had their dish that they called \"Ivy Best Friends\" which are three things served together but separated: Boneless BBQ Chicken (thigh served dry), shredded green papaya salad, and a black sticky rice served with a thin sweet and sour sauce. Separately these items were OK (the crispy-skinned chicken was a bit on the dry side for a thigh) but really were at their best when mixed, all the different textures of sweet, sour, crunchy, chewy, tangy, cold and hot were all represented in this dish. \n\nThe execution of this entree might have been better if the chicken were more juicy and had more inherent flavor, but this dish had a great potential to be an eye-opening lesson on why Thai food is so good at combining so many textures and tastes into their wondrous cuisine.\n\nThe deserts were the stand-out for us: Mango Sticky Rice and Fried Banana with coconut Ice Cream. \n\nThe sticky rice was amazing: this warm short-grained white rice was so dense and chewy that it seemed like it was on its way to being mochi, covered in a thick, sweet coconut milk. This was perfectly offset by mango slices that were not too sweet, so they complemented the rice's sweet stickiness with a firm cold tartness.\n\nThe Fried Bananas were coated in a perfectly crisped batter that was not oily and were perfectly sweet. Again those many textures: cold sweet coconut ice cream, crunchy warm and sweet banana fritters--just heaven in a spoon.\n\nWe would definitely visit this place again to check out their other main dishes.", "author": "Glenn H."}

Can you steal their recipe - please (I'm begging you!)  You'd really have a dish no other Thai restaurant in San Francisco has been able to duplicate anywhere close to Appe-thai-zing's (and I've tried quite a few).\n\nI digress...\n\nMy Ivy's appetizer of almond prawns accompanied by a delicious creamy lemon dipping sauce was heaven. While the angel wings were yummy, the almond prawns are the way to go. It's a sensational appetizer I've never seen on any other menu so for me, it had that pop of trying something new and it was delectable.\n\nAnd a thumbs up on My Ivy's crab rangoons. Here, My Ivy's delicate yet flavorful spices really stepped up this delicious (and decadent) appetizer.  \n\nI would give My Ivy 4.5 stars if I could since the second time I ordered I asked if they put me higher up on the delivery rounds and they did.

Hmm, let us ponder. \n\nFresh Spring Rolls - FANTASTIC. Yummy peanut sauce, fresh, non-wilted greens, crunchy carrots, and flavorful tofu. Throw in their beautiful display and it certainly puts a spring in my step! \n\nSpicy Basil Leaf - ummm better every time I order it. That's a pretty major feat. Spicy, fresh, colorful, and frolicking with flavor, this dish remains a fave. \n\nPumpkin Curry - I have a crush on pumpkin. There's something about that cute little stem poking out the top, the shiny skin oozing with beta-carotene, and don't even get me started on those touchable vertical curves... It started with carving and seed roasting on Halloweens, matured with Burma Superstar's Pumpkin Shrimp, and has now reached unconditional status with My Ivy's Pumpkin Curry. Love... \n\nOur waitress was phenomenal. She saved us from some potentially drastic ordering mistakes. When trying to sub fresh tofu for fried, this lovely lady kindly informed us that \"it's gross\" with the fresh. Who knew?! I know we all comment on service... but even compared to any fancy shmancy, hoity toity restaurant, this place wins hands, feet, and butt down (butt down on decorative chairs!). #1 for perfect waitressing. \n\nQuestion: \nWhy are plates and bowls circular? Let us consider the evolution of circular dishware. Did it begin with drift wood - rounded corners from years sand wear and tear? Maybe the pelvic bone of some animal, shaped to cup some fluids or random prehistoric mush. Whatever the original reason for round dishes, rest assured it's worthless now! My Ivy is going 21st century on us and whippin' out some square ones. I guarantee it holds your foods just as well. \n\nSo tell me, was a review update necessary? Do you stop watering a perfect flower? Stop encouraging a straight A student? Stop brushing a cavity-less mouth? It. Was. Necessary.", "author": "Zoey S."}

I ordered the tofu pad thai, papaya salad, fresh spring rolls, and chicken fried rice.  When I got home I noticed I received tofu fried rice instead of chicken fried rice.  Normally I wouldn't mind the mistake since the tofu fried rice wasn't that bad but since I live close by, I decided to call them to correct the order.  When I called and spoke with the waitress, she read back the correct order so it wasn't like she took the order wrong, it was more so they just made the wrong item.  She told me to come back and when I showed her the tofu fried rice, she took it and gave me the death stare as if I made the mistake.  As if that wasn't bad enough, she gave me more attitude when she gave me the correct order.  Please tell me how it was my fault to get so much attitude???\n\nIn a nutshell, the food was OK at best but the customer service was freaking horrible since I didn't even get an apology or anything.

That's not to say I didn't have a good experience here the first time (both times I've eaten here it's been takeout), it was just that I ordered something kind of plain so I figured I'd order something more \"exciting\" before reviewing it. \n\nThe first time I ordered here I got crispy chicken w/fried rice, and it was good! I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but it was simpler than I thought it would be. It was literally just fried rice (w/nothing else mixed in) and pieces of lightly breaded chicken. There was a light sweet sour & sauce on the side. The thing is, I LIKED that it was simple. I also liked that neither the chicken or sauce was all that heavy (and that the sauce came on the side). \n\nThe second time I ordered from here I got Drunken noodles, which were also yummy! They were garlicky (but not to heavy) w/lots of veggies mixed in. Again, this dish was fairly light, and pretty simple, which is something I liked. \n\nEven though I got takeout I noticed this place does do delivery (I think there's a $20 minimum). I didn't get to experience the restaurant itself that much, but it seems nice and the staff seems friendly. I like that there's now a Thai option in this area to go along w/all the other casual dining spots (Tortilla Heights & Godzilla to name a couple). \n\nThis place doesn't have website (that I know of anyway) so both times when ordering I looked at the menu from GrubHub (I've STILL forgotten to grab a menu from the restaurant), and both times my meals came out a little cheaper than the prices listed there, so that's good! In general, My Ivy is very reasonable price wise. The portions aren't huge, but satisfying enough. I'll be back!", "author": "George A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-29", "description": "If you've got Connect 4, Scrabble, UNO, whatever... bring it. My friend and I played several rounds while waiting for stuff like having our orders taken, the food arriving, and getting checked on by our servers. We showed up on a Monday evening with something like 3/4 of the tables occupied and two friendly servers present. It was one of those \"Hey, what's that place we just drove by? Let's try it.\" things for us.\n\nCompared to some other SF Thai restaurants, the interior is slightly more modern and upscale (but not like the Osha on 3rd St or at the Embarcadero). I appreciate that, given the setting, the vibe is still chill enough to walk in head-to-toe in sweats or Lululemon, or football (soccer) scrimmage gear like a pair two tables down from us. But don't let any of this stop you from putting on your sportcoat or that little black number.\n\nOf note among our particular items were the Black and White Sticky Rice, Strawberry Mojito, and Pumpkin Curry. I haven't seen the B&W rice on other menus. It came in a small foil wrap and had parts that were slightly crunchy. About the crunch factor, think a number of levels lower than the rice at the bottom of a Korean hot stone bowl. Actually, I'd say they weren't \"crunchy\" so much as \"not as soft as you'd expect rice to be\". The non-alcohol tones of the Strawberry Mojito were like Kool-Aid, if that's your thing. My friend liked the Pumpkin Curry as good as or better than others they'd had; it was overall too sweet for me.\n\nAccording to one of our servers, the food here is intentionally California-ized. So if you're seeking the intense and traditional, My Ivy might not be Your Ivy, per se. Given the ambience though, I shouldn't have to spell that out for you while racking up double and triple word scores.", "author": "Dan B."}

And Ivy delivers, usually in 30 minutes or less (despite what they quote us on the phone).\n\nThey replaced another Thai restaurant that was at this location, and improved the food and service dramatically. They have really creative specials,  very high quality food, and they really do listen when you ask them for modifications (more spicy / less spicy / not so much pepper / etc).  \n\nI absolutely adore the Ivy Beef, the almond prawn appetizer, the Pad See Ew, and just about everything else on the menu.  The Pra-Ram has more vegetables than just spinach, which was a nice surprise. The mango sticky rice is hit or miss. It's never BAD, but sometimes it has an abundance of coconut milk and sometimes it's lacking.

I like that they have our information in the computer, so we just have to give our phone number and they are ready to take our order.\n\nI haven't actually been inside the restaurant, so I can't make any comments about that!  \n\nSo overall, if you are looking for super scrumptious Thai food, definitely make a point of calling or stopping by My Ivy.", "author": "Sherri H."}

When we didn't have a kid we frequented this place. It's near a ton of other casual quick eats on Divisadero but the service and attitude we got from the people working here recently totally sucks. We ordered the pumpkin tofu curry and a bunch of other dishes for delivery. The menu indicated we can order non-spicy and so we ordered this dish for our 3 year old. When the food arrived, it wasn't just spicy it was flaming crazy spicy, so clearly we can't feed that to our toddler. I called the restaurant and they said \"we can't make exceptions the curry is pre made (Um, even though you can order it that way ). Just brush off the spice and next time YOU HAVE to order the other kind of curry\". Like FORREALS? You talk to your customers like that? \"Just brush it off\" it's in the freaking sauce, yo. A W E S O M E. Ah, how about no. Big fat no. Luckily, we placed our order through eat24, called them and they refunded us since we had to toss that firey  dish in the trash.

Mostly I cook Thai food at home but after foot surgery I am not be able to cook for myself and friends. One time, My fiance had to pick up my stuff@ Kaiser so I asked him if he could get me some papaya salad at any Thai restaurants. My ivy seems to be the best choice.\n\nSo he ordered some papaya salad and pad see ew chicken to go for me. After I ate papaya salad, I woud say It was nice balance between sweet and sour and a little kick off thai chili. I love grilled shrimp on my salad as well. But for the Pad see ew chicken, It wasn't right for my taste yet. The noodles needs to cook a bit longer, and more sauce on it.", "author": "Sasitorn O."}

I live nearby, so I frequent this place as a very reliable source for good Thai food.  My go-to is the Pineapple Fried Rice, and lately I've been enamored with the Pumpkin Curry -- these are usually to-go for lunch, but the indoor seating is also nice.  Plus, this sounds kind of weird, but the sink in their bathroom is really cool.  The servers there are super friendly and always greet me with a smile.\n\nThey've also donated for my AIDS/LifeCycle ride, so I personally can vouch that these are good people.

Texture and flavor wasn't bad, but again not a lot for $7.\n-Pad See Ew: $8 Got this with chicken.  So little noodles.  I love pad see ew with LOTS OF NOODLES!  Chicken was very dry.  I didn't even eat any of it.\n-Druken Linguine: $8? (I think that is the price)  This dish was a little spicy for me.  Wasn't anything special.  Just tasted like a stirfry noodle.\n-Crab Fried Rice: $11 This dish had a lot of crab it in, and the flavor was okay.  The thing that got me was the rice was so mushy! Clumps of rice all mushed together.  Ew!  The texture was just horrible.\n-Caramelized Lychee Duck: $13 ALL FAT AND OILY AS HELL! Ehhh gross.

Spring rolls came sitting in peanut sauce (wished it was served on the side like most everywhere else), seafood soup was missing a lot of shrimp (or was just not very generous on portions), grilled chicken (lemongrass perhaps? I wasn't the one ordering) was solid as was the tofu with veggies. The dish I was most looking forward to, pinapple and prawns in a red curry, was good but much like the soup, light on the goods.\n\nFavorite part was the bathroom sink. Blue color with a unique design that had the water flowing from the faucet onto a plate and into your hands. More interesting than the food. Overall design of the space was good too. Loved the exposed bricks, just enough to feel modern, but not too much that it felt out of place for the neighborhood.\n\nProbably would have gone three stars if it weren't for the finale. We were a large group celebrating a birthday, and the bill was large with tip included. Everyone had paid their share and we were about to leave before we were stopped to let us know they forgot to add a dish. Really? Hundreds of dollars later? There was no time to double check, we paid and left. Those are mistakes you catch before giving us the bill.\n\nSkip. Unless you need to use the bathroom.", "author": "Jason B."}

My co workers and I ate here one day, and I ordered a dish that had crushed peanuts on top when my dish was brought  out. It was my mistake, the menu did say there were peanuts in the dish, but we were rushing and I read it really fast when I ordered it and missed that memo. I am not allergic to peanuts, but they don't sit well in my stomach and I knew I was not going to like it. When the waitress brought my food out I politely asked her if it was possible to remake the dish with out the peanuts on top. She responded with a \"no\" and proceeded to tell me that it was my fault, I made the mistake, I should have read the menu and  if they made me another dish, I would have to pay for an additonal dish, so I would be charged twice for one plate, because of course, they were going to take the first one back. I couldn't belive what she had said, she was being very argumentatvie and rude. I apologized and stated that I was not aware that the dish was topped with peanuts, being that I had this particular dish many times from other Thai resturants and never had it been topped with crushed peanuts, so again my mistake for breifly skimming the menu and ordering, but if I ask for the dish to be remade, as your paying customer, I don't ever want my server yelling at me, blaming me and saying it was my mistake so I would have to be charged for two if the dish was remade, just simply, remake the dish.", "author": "Kiesh M."}

The food here is just as good, I particularly enjoyed the coconut soup, and it also doesn't cost as much.  The reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars, is because it doesn't stand out much when compared to other Thai joints in the area.

They have delicious food at affordable prices and they give generous portions.  The service was friendly and timely and the interior is quite clean and minimalist.\n\nFor lunch we tried the Papaya Salad with BBQ chicken and the Pad See Ew with beef.  They gave us a complimentary soup to start, which was a nice addition -- nothing groundbreaking but a nice touch.  The Papaya Salad was really tasty and refreshing.  And the BBQ chicken had great flavor -- it had a bit of curry flavor which was nice.  And they also served it with a bowl of rice (I hate it when you have to pay extra for rice).  They grill it with the skin on in case you don't like that but I didn't mind and it added to the flavor.  My husband's beef Pad See Ew was also fantastic -- very generous portion with lots of tasty noodles, broccoli and beef.  A nice balance of salty with a touch of sweet.  \n\nI was so excited to see that they also deliver for dinner service!

I live in NOPA and so walking a few blocks or easily taking the 24 to get there is no big deal.

We visited at about 2 in the afternoon, the restaurant is small and has a cool modern vibe, the drink menu is small too but creative. You seriously got the cool Pac Heights vibe from this place. The fried rice with crab  was to die for and so was the beef with homemade wine sauce and the angel wings were so sticky and sweet...we were embarrassed at how much we were licking our fingers and in ecstasy all at the same time.

I ordered through My Ivy Thai online and unfortunately I didn't think the order went through. I never received a confirmation from the order because the web page expired. I decided to call My Ivy and place the order over the phone. About 15 minutes later, the delivery person showed up with two orders. He told me that they had an order online from me, as well as over the telephone. I told him that it couldn't be because I never received an order confirmation online. He called his boss and I spoke to her about how I should be refunded for one of the orders. She refused and was rude and unprofessional. She also said she called me three times, however I never picked up. I can assure you she never called. I told her that I would no longer be a customer, though I have supported the business from their initial opening. She said that was fine and hung up. I decided to call Eat 24 to see if they would reverse the charge. Thankfully, they agreed and were pleasant about reversing the charge. I feel that as a customer, My  Ivy should have made the call to Eat 24, not me. Therefore, I will no longer eat at My Ivy Thai. Honestly, if I was out fifty bucks for both orders, whatever, it's more about the principal and how unrealistic and ridiculous the manager of My Thai Ivy was. I hope this is helpful.", "author": "Lindsay N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-28", "description": "First visit to a new restaurant, two people.  The food was quite a disappointment.   The menu is very limited (particularly in vegetables), all the dishes are a lot smaller than you would expect for the price, and nothing tastes particularly fresh or good.\n\nWe ordered Fresh Spring Rolls (raw vegetables wrapped in rice paper), and asked them to omit tofu; the waitress checked with the kitchen, and reported that they could NOT omit tofu because the rolls were all made in advance, and they specifically refused to make one to order.  (The restaurant was empty at the time except for us.)  We ordered it anyway and picked out the tofu, and indeed it tasted tired and pre-made.  Another appetizer was Salmon Rolls, small amounts of mashed salmon rolled up in wonton wrappers and deep-fried; the filling tasted OK, but the wrappers were much too thick and chewy so they dominated the salmon and were hard to eat (four small rolls).\n\nFor entrees, we had Pumpkin (Kabocha) Curry with chicken; the red curry sauce was OK, with nice coconut milk flavor, but the dish was small with very little chicken and even less pumpkin (five small cubes).  Another dish was Spicy Eggplant with Pork; this lacked flavor (it was certainly not spicy, at all), had pork cut too thick, and was again short on eggplant (half a dozen pieces).  Carmelized lychee duck featured good roasted duck, but the raw spinach salad served under it had a distasteful sweet dressing, completely inedible.  Trying to get more green vegetables, we had asked for anything made with asparagus, gai lan, snow peas, dao miu, bok choy, sugar snap peas--anything, but nothing was available.  The only green vegetables in the kitchen (we were told) were broccoli, green beans, cabbage, and spinach.  We ordered a side dish of Steamed Mixed Vegetables with Garlic Sauce; it included carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and a little cabbage,but didn't have much flavor (and in particular we couldn't taste any garlic to speak of).  \n\nTwo appetizers and four entrees made a scant dinner for two, because the portions were so small.\n\nThe wine list is extremely limited, and restricted to only a few very modest choices.  But corkage is offered at $10, so you should take your own wine.  (We did, and the wine service was fine.)\n\nThe restaurant space is clean and new, but minimal.  Very few people came in to sit down while we were there, but there was a trickle of take-away customers.  Service was competent, but not particularly attentive.\n\nComparing My Ivy to its neighborhood competition, a much better choice would be the nearby Sweet Lime thai restaurant.  Sweet Lime has a wider menu, more vegetables, larger portions, and all the food there tastes much fresher.  It also has a nicer environment, full of fresh flowers, very gracious and welcoming service, and a more-extensive wine list.\n\nI cannot recommend My Ivy based on this visit.  Based on the flood of early reviews here at Yelp, we had expected much better.", "author": "Robert G."}

My friend and I were both super hungry after spending the day moving and the food did not disappoint. We shared the fresh spring rolls and the crispy tofu to start. Both of the portions were huge and I really liked both dishes. The spring roll was served in a peanut sauce that I thought was absolutely fab and I liked that unlike most crispy tofu, this version was crispy on the outside while being the right consistency on the inside. The Tom Yom Soup was also really good with a nice balance of meat and veggies plus the right amount of spice. I was not a huge fan of the Pad Ki Mao (drunken noodle) but it was only because of the consistency of the noodles (slightly gummy) and how undercooked the veggies were.

Tonight, after going to the Opera Plaza for a movie, I happen to go to My Ivy because La Tratoria Food Inc, one of my favorites, was closed. I have to say that I was incredibly disappointed.  The moment I walked in (and maybe it's because of I'm a woman of color: who knows), I was treated like an intruder. The two women who approached me were rude, and continued to be so throughout my dinner experience. I could not help but to notice that while they went to other patrons to ask how their food was, I was never approached, only to sit me and give me the check. The caramelized duck was nothing other than 5 pieces of greasy duck over spinach. I barely finished it. And the wine glass was pretty dirty. I asked the waitress and she said it was on the outside of the glass. Is that any consolation? I love Thai food, but will definitely never go back to My Ivy at all!", "author": "Migdalia R."}
