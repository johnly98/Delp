Why have one of a thing when you can have two? By now I've convinced myself that Dickel tastes great, though really, anything tastes good if you wash it down with some Tecate, including spite and sadness. Those are the two key active ingredients in Dickel, right? \n\nThere's also a sort of smoker's isolation tank where you can hang out with a beat-up piano that someone probably bought at Tom Waits's garage sale.\n\nLike some sort of grubby, evil TARDIS, Edinburgh looks really tiny on the outside and is secretly gigantic on the inside. It's pretty dark, too, which I count as a plus because I don't think light would be flattering to either the bar or its patrons (i.e. me). Don't get it twisted; it only LOOKS like the kind of place where people break pool cues over their knees in futile attempts to defeat Patrick Swayze. It's been super-chill every time I've been there.

The place was nearly empty and somehow the classic San Francisco smell of Tenderloin streets was stronger inside the bar than out. I'm actually shocked to now find out that they apparently serve food here? \n\nI'm not going to advise anyone against eating here but I will present you with the knowledge of the women's restroom, that has 2 stalls. One of which has a toilet that does not flush and a door that once locked, jams. So be prepared to go full Kool Aid Man to get out there like I had to. When you go to wash your hands you'll notice there's not only no soap, but the sink is not even hooked up to water. I have no idea how many women work here, but they aren't washing their hands up in this piece. \n\nI went back to my friend at the bar who was truly disgusted that I came back with \"piss hands\" even though I'm 70% sure I did not pee on my hands. But I guess I see his point. \n\nThe great thing about this place is that on a pretty prime Saturday evening in a bar that could probably hold 250 people, there were maybe 11 people here in total and that includes the bartended, my friend, and I . So there were plenty of seats, it had a great dive bar vibe, the accompanying SF dive bar smell, and while you maybe need to bring your own hand sanitizer, it's a cool gritty place to come with a big group for maybe the cheapest drinks in town.", "author": "Candice G."}

The bartender also gave us small taster glasses because we were debating on our first pitcher, which was nice! \n\nThere were roughly 20-30 people there (8:30-10PM), and our team (\"in dog drinks we've only had one\") got flattened in the trivia. Like, who comes up with these questions and why do people know these answers. \n\nIf you put it on google maps, it might tell you to go to cedar road and not Geary. The entrance on cedar road is super sketchy and empty and difficult to find. Go to the entrance on Geary that is much more legit and noticeable. The bathroom sort of looks like a scene from a horror movie, but has character, I guess. \n\nI had just come from a dance class and hadn't eaten dinner so I was really excited for bar food.

Though my friends and I had such a fun time and I had just been there the weekend before to encounter tons of foreigners who bought me plenty of Fernet and cokes, which was cool in and of itself, but still, nothing really came to mind that made this drinking experience different than any other. But then I decided, maybe there was something awesome about Edinburgh.\n\nWe pranced over after checking out a couple places in NoPa to discover that the bouncer wouldn't accept my friend's passport as her ID. We started to get sad, but then he said he was just kidding! Oh man, this guy's got jokes. Next, we walked in to find that there was a $10 per person cover charge. Sadness reinitiated, as paying covers suck and we only had $6 between the three of us. But then, lo and behold, this bouncer accepted our $6 offering and let all three of us in! Childbearing, periods, and lower pay aside, being a woman has it's perks.\n\nHeading inside we approached the bar, ordered three beers and went up to the top level to look down over the fake rooftop awnings above the main floor. It's such a cute and fun atmosphere, you have to be a real beezy to not at keast enjoy that.\n\nThe night continued, hip hop came on, and the drunken white girl in me had to make an appearance. Enter the first bouncer who gave us good natured grief about the passport, commence grinding / dancing / actin' a fool, but who cares it was so fun and he didn't seem to mind. \n\nAs we walked down to the main floor for another bevvy, my friend reached into her purse and pulled out a pair of those funky false hill billy teeth, so naturally I put them in and started dancing more. I, and anyone who came within one foot of me, could not keep a straight face. Yes, we were all surely tispy and reading this you may think I'm an attention whore (which I am), but it was hilarious. \n\nAll in all, an awesome night. Cheap drinks, great music, entertaining staff. One of my favorite TL bars and not too many pretentious hipsters, so that's a major plus.", "author": "Crystal C."}

Walking back down Geary, I saw so many way fancy bars and was glad that we'd gone to such a casual laidback place.

It used to be a simple affair but now the line can go down the street, so come early if you want to get in.\n\nTuesday night trivia is one of the best in town, and can get VERY competitive.  \n\nHappy hour goes until 8pm!  2 pieces fish & chips and ANY pint for $10.  Shot of well and a PBR for 5.  \n\nThere's usually one tv playing a ball game and one tuned to AMC.

However, when I'm at Edinburgh, I always enjoy myself, which I guess is what counts, right?\n\nEdinburgh is home to a couple great club nights (1964, Nightbeat), but even on off nights, it's a fun place to grab a couple pints. There are plenty of seats at the long bar, booths, and upstairs (if they have it open.) I always hear how back in the day, they held 1964 in the now closed room upstairs (and curse the fact that I couldn't see that at least once.) Also has a dedicated smoking space up in the front, which is often as packed as the rest of the bar.\n\nThe bathrooms are pretty disgusting, thankfully I don't need to spend too much time in there nor actually touch any of the fixtures. But I guess it's kind of fitting for the ambiance of the bar to have dirty restrooms. Reminds me of the 'worst toilet in scotland' scene from Trainspotting.\n\nCan't forget to mention there are also bartenders walking around taking orders for more drinks. What's better than being able to get more beer without having to lose your seat and/or squeeze in between people at the bar?\n\nDefinitely a must if you're in the TL.", "author": "Jon T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-06", "description": "I have very mixed feelings about this bar after 10 years of visiting it. To be fair, I go once or twice a year when I visit San Francisco, usually in December. The environment is great, there's a good beer and whiskey selection, and the prices are reasonable though not surprising given the required transit through the Demilitarized Zone known colloquially as \"the Tenderloin\".\n\nThe following rant is directed mostly at Captain Sullen Sullenberger aka The Dyspeptic Scottish Barkeep (hereafter S.S.). When I order a drink from this guy, I get treated like the person who (presumably) ran over his dog (repeatedly). At this point, I wish I had. Sullen is the middle aged male bartender (owner?) who over the years has become an enormous poopy pants. To be fair the static-emanating music system, which almost blue-screened my frontal lobe, can give him a run for his money. (Just between us, neighborhood bars in the Tenderloin don't need club music even if the hipsters claim otherwise.) I guess if S.S. really is the owner, game over man, game over!\n\nSeriously though, I don't need to be screamed at \"There's nothing free here!\" and glared at like Dick Cheney in a peyote-fueled drum circle as I take a tonic water that had been served twice to me for free earlier in the night by the much more pleasant Happy-Hour shift barkeep. He had even said \"cheers!\"\n\nIn previous years S.S. has been \"chode-like\" aka dickish about ejecting people playing games on the upper level at the end of the night, ruder than other bartenders I have interacted with in similar situations. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I don't think it's unreasonable to take 2 extra mins to finish a pool game. I also don't think it's a paradigm shift to treat your customers with some basic respect. When I return the following year and he's still there, I know the same thing will happen. Last night was the final straw. I will throw my lot in with the Irish Bank, Owl Tree, or some other haunt much closer to the AGU epicenter.", "author": "Andy F."}

Chances are you've ended up here at least once before you even knew where or what the Tenderloin was and before you knew beers better than Newcastle or Boddy's.  You've done the requisite cab battle outside and probably didn't even know there was an upstairs.  \n\nIn any case I usually find this a great multi-purpose bar.  It's close enough to downtown that it's a decent meeting point for visitors yet you've ended up here on random weekend nights with your friends so it's a bit of a locals place too.  The seats can be cramped but that all makes for a more intimate feeling.  It's relatively neat but with that layer of grime so it feels like it might be a dive.  The beer selection isn't the greatest though they do have a good range of the United Kingdom's finest offerings.  The Black Prince Porter is a welcome selection if you're looking for something dark and have long ago divorced Guinness.  The trivia night is solid and a good outing.  You know you won't win anyway and the questions are decently difficult that you can give your cognitive acumen a good workout while killing brain cells.\n\nProbably the biggest gripe is the food.  Everyone seems to tout the fish and chips but I found them sub-average at best.  The breading was too soggy and soft and it seemed to not only dwarf the fish but also ruin the flavor of the veggies.  Just like any other bar you really enjoy it becomes a quasi hipster colony on the weekends and competition for a cab after last call could be an Olympic event but weekday nights or three day weekend Sundays are still great.\n\nDespite the selectivity required in visiting, I'll still look forward to visiting the Castle.", "author": "Steven R."}

Pretty reasonably priced too (compared to bars/pubs in SJ)  - 3 beers and a rum and coke for $16.  \n\nWalking inside it's nothing like what you think you're walking into - it's a pub most assuredly but to have a name like Edinburgh - you would have thought that there would be something Scottish about this place but no.  It's a pub and serves alcohol - as long as there is seating and music what does the decor ultimately matter?

My experience certainly wasn't up to that of the others here.\n\nThe evening was an hour or two of slow service, poor food, and rude and obnoxious patrons.

No Bellhaven?  How about something from the Inveralmond Brewery or the Caledonian Brewery?\n\nThey do have Guinness and Racer.  Very good, but not Scottish.  Guinness is an Irish beer, and before any of you utter \"same difference\" you better think before you speak. I thought they had Kiltlifter, but they weren't pouring it that night (and it's brewed in Arizona anyway).\n\nThere are some positives:\n- Good selection of Whiskey\n- Trivia night looks fun\n- they do get some decent bands here\nSo I will go back.

It made me angry enough to confront the guy to tell him that was uncalled for and way too aggressive, especially when I wasn't fleeing away from him or anything. He quickly apologized and although I still didn't think it was necessary for him to grab me, I felt better and left the bar in a decent mood.\nAnyway, come here if you're down for crowded places and cheesy white people.

Hmmm....Scotland.  I could go for that.  I'm half Scottish.  Maybe I could work on my Sco'ish accent, order a Scottish ale,  and water it down with  a deep-fried Mars bar!\n\nWell, I made my way up to Geary St., avoiding some hookers, and some other ne'er-do-wells in the shadows, and made it to a castle enshrouded in mist:  Edinburgh Castle.....Pub.\n\nYeah, I didn't expect to see an actual \"castle\".

Other than the barkeep, I was the only other person in this fairly expansive area.  I must admit, I did like the space.  The bar was old and woody.  I saw a grip-load of brews on tap.  Yes, there were some from the Old Country, but there were many local microbrews.  I saddled up to the bar, and went with a \"Death & Taxes\" ale, and later a Lasgunitas IPA.  I watched the muted Olympic cross-country skiing race, as the bartender watched some sort of British movie awards show.\n\nThe bartender was nice, mellow, and treated my loner-self well on an evening when I was in the dumps.  After his award show, he muted his show and popped in some music.  The first song sounded Celtic, but I couldn't place it.  Next, there was a Cowboy Junkies song I had never heard of (but my ears gravitated toward), and then he played a T-Bone Burnett song.  In other words, this bartender was a phenomenal DJ.

Yes there are a few others in the city, but this tenderloin gem is such a find!  Beers like Kilt Lifer, Dragonslayer, and Kronenbourg 1664 to name a few.  I usually just get the Kilt Lifter, one of my favorite beers, especially on tap, and at 8.5% alcohol I recommend getting their half pints which are exactly half the price of their full pints.  Genius!\n\nThis place also has a full bar, decent jukebox, a pinball machine, open upstairs section (rumor has it live bands play up there) great Tuesday night trivia and good happy hour specials.  If you are a smoker there is a ventilated smoking room complete with beat up piano.  I've been known to wail on the poor beast and sing like a wounded seal with emphysema driving the rest of the smokers outside (usually after too much Kilt Lifter and Fernet).\n\nOn the weekends during the day they have free pool and pretty good bloody marys.  One of the bartenders makes a mean \"porn star\" dirty martitni which he makes by muddling olives and ice together.  It's the money shot of martinis. \n\nBring a small flashlight and check out the bar sometime.  It is resin poured over old British pence.  The newest I found was from 1968 and the oldest I found was from 1899. I've been known to pick up some Mexican food from Mid City Foods down the street, bring it in and enjoy some Kilt Lifter and Fernet with my dinner and gaze at the coins with my key chain flashlight, occasionally striking up conversations with random people.\n\nYeah I'm a sick puppy.", "author": "Theron L."}

Originally it was for the quiz with MC Enzo( who went on to Jeopardy fame). Over the years it has slowly and steadily gone down hill. \n\n   When they started doing club nights, I though that would be a good addition, I was wrong. The Castle has transformed from a TL locals/ average joe's type of pub and turned into an unwelcoming hipster bar. The current trivia MC is horrible, no sense of humor, unpleasant, a speech impediment( not good to have when running a quiz) and basically a jerk. Service had always been poor and somehow it has gotten worse. The space is cavernous but poorly utalized, always cold and they have no regard to maintain it, rather just let it continue to deteriorate. Prices have climbed, it is mind boggling how a TL bar can charge $6 for a standard pint. They are by FAR the most expensive TL bar you will go to, Hell they might be the most expensive bar in 1 mile radius. Alan seems tired as if he no longer wants to be there. \n\n   They still bring in the fish and chips from the Old Chelsea, and I stand by saying they are the best in town. So with fond memories and the fish and chips, I can muster 2 stars. It pains me even more to say I will never intentionally go there again. I would love to see that space better used, I shall dream of the day I can buy it and rekindle its former glory.", "author": "Christopher N."}

You will recognize the crumbling decorations of the old country, whiskey jars, football penants and photos of the teams that matter (all teams except them in the blue shirts), combined with an American choice of beers (some of them I had not seen elsewhere in the city) and a crowd that ranged from neighbourhood regulars to metalheads to students with silly sideways hair.  As this place was only a short walk from my hostel, I visited it late at night on 3 or 4 occasions.

A lot of it I've tried to block out. Black out. Whatever. MAKE IT GO AWAY FOREVER. But, for your reading pleasure, a few BENIGN snippets...\n\nOne of only three times I've ever cheated on my diet was after Edinburgh Castle. I don't even know how I ended up there.

So how to straighten myself out? Go next door and EAT A PIECE OF FREAKIN' PIZZA. Augh. It stopped me from THROWING UP, but if you don't eat dairy, and then you DO, it ain't pretty -- what FALLS OUT of you, that is (and nearly during the cab ride home; ack!)...\n\nI also came here with my ex of 9+ years, when he decided to come torture -- oh excuse me, I mean, VISIT -- me for a weekend a year ago. \n\nANDREW: (whine) \"I don't get it Lisa, whatever happened to us? Bartender! SHOT OF JAEGER, PLEASE!\"\n\nLISA: (sob) \"I don't know! We had to do this! You know it's true. Please just let it be.

They wound up with a happy ending and a good crowd of friends and newbies alike. Thanks, E to the C!!!\n\nBut all those warm fuzzies aside, I guess they DID still wind up with that very-drunk-girlfriend-of-the-guitarist. To which I can only say...\n\nI'M SORRY! DON'T PLAY AT EDINBURGH CASTLE AND TELL ME TO BE THERE AT 10:00 AND NOT GO ON UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT!

Edinburgh Castle does well on both accounts surprisingly, but the overall cheap, rustic atmosphere is what makes it work. \n\nSome notable points:\n\n*The only faucets are found within the stall of the bathroom, so if you use the urinal and someone's in the stall, you have no choice but to wipe on your pants.  \n*The ATM spits out $10 bills.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night to go here though, go here for trivia night.  It starts at 8:30 on Tuesdays, and the entertaining \"MC\" takes you through seven rounds of questions, from Kevin Bacon topics to current events to music.  Prizes include free beer, as well as cold hard cash.\n\nJust be sure to arrive with either some really smart people, or someone with access to a PDA phone with internet access.  \n\nUnfortunately there's no wifi points in here...though, if you're surprised at that fact, this probably isn't your kind of place.", "author": "Tien N."}

About a dozen people are hovering around on the sidewalk indicating that the inside is probably pretty packed. The door guy has a bored look on his face as he checks your I.D., while you stand in a cloud of smoke being expelled by skinny jean clad 20-something-ers.\n\nAs you walk in, you think back to the 1st time you were at the E.C. What was it, '98? '97? A long time ago, when it was brightly lit and filled with average Joe's out for a post-work pint. Tonight, it looks like a frickin' hipster bomb went off, because all you see are shag hair cuts (circa 1982), studded belts, horizontal stripes, and Vans. Whatever. You're there, it's been a long night and a drink is in your future.\n\nWhile the clientele has changed, you notice that the bartenders have not. Rough around the edges, the handle-bar mustached bartender gives you something close to a \"What'll it be?\" Your friend looks scared. While he does seem a bit intimidating, you flash a smile and keep it simple. No pink drinks here. This is a beer and shots kind of place, so you order a couple of Fernets with ginger backs. All paid up, you grab your drinks and step aside for the loaded couple who are practically falling over each other and you. A couple of frat boys who seem to have lost their way to the Marina make a sloppy attempt to chat you up. Not in the mood, you find your way to a big booth and toast your friends at the sheer luck of finding seats on such a crowded night.\n\nOverall, as your crew starts to get a little boozy, voices growing louder and louder, you notice little things about the E.C. You see it for what it is. A dive bar. There's a red lantern candle on the table giving off a nice rosy glow. The music is really loud, which is why you can't hear anything significant from your friends conversation. You like that he drinks were pretty reasonably priced, and once you got the bar keep to crack a little smile through his handle bar 'stache, you think that the staff is almost friendly. You also realize that their service style is not completely inappropriate considering the crowd of inebriated hip kids around this Tenderloin bar.\n\nYou yawn. It's really late. You look over to see your incredibly drunk friend weaving and wagging her finger in the face of a tall hipster guy who has a mildly amused look on his face. Yep. Party's over.

They have a ton of great beer on tap and their scotch selection is impressive, they have a pool table and darts, there is live music every now and again, they sponsor events for writers, the JUKEBOX IS AWESOME , yet the smell of this bar is so repulsive to me that I can't stay for more than a half hour.  \n\nNow I understand that most bars will have a bit of a funk to them from the food, the booze, and whatever else is spilled around, but there is also another issue I have with the odors that emanate from inside of this establishment.  \n\nLast night I had the good fortune of literally being surrounded by the worst smelling humans on earth.  It was like they formed this invisible odor circle around me that made even my black prince porter taste like their 2 month old musty sweat.  Now of course a bar cannot be held responsible for the smell of it's patrons, but damn.  Can they put a shower in the back?  I'll do the plumbing for free and throw in a year's supply of soap.  I mean, I still am getting wafts of BO while i sit here and it is making me physically ill.  \n\nnote to the man with the little black dog sitting at the table behind me:  you are fucking gross and it is not very hygienic when your hair looks like you just got out of the shower when it is plainly obvious that you have not set foot in a shower for the past month.  \n\nIf you can stomach the scent or you in fact are an incredibly smelly person, this bar is great for you.", "author": "Charley B."}

Don't get me wrong - I get bleary eyed when I hear a tune from the old country and get excited about any reference made to home... otherwise you wouldn't find me in a Scottish bar hoping to hear some familiar inflections. It's like an aural hug. \n\nTrivia night was good - I love me a good pub quiz so that and some fish and chips (haven't had any better in the bay area... not that that actually says much)... but need some broon sauce... it's just not the same otherwise.

When we first walked up to the door, the \"bouncer\" was a little preppy Indian guy playing on his iPhone. We confusedly handed him our IDs wondering, \"is he just pretending to be the bouncer?\" After he engaged us in a quick friendly chat, we sidled into the mostly empty bar and occupied one of the cool booths on the side. I think we were too late for happy hour but the drinks were pretty cheap anyway - like $2.50 for PBR on tap. They also have an upstairs balcony area, a free jukebox, and a pool table. And I can't get enough of their fish'n'chips delivery service and super-friendly staff! The \"waiter\" (another young guy who didn't look the part) kept politely asking if we needed more drinks and he promptly took our fish'n'chips order and brought it over to us along with some sauces.

Luckily (well, for me), my teammates are damn smart, so we usually do well. (Don't be mad.) I'm just there to add my two cents in the picture round. And drink lots of beer. My complaint would be that it tends to go loooong. It starts at 8:30 and usually isn't over til 11. It seems like Carl (the quizmaster) is trying new ways to make it go faster, but it's still lagging. \n\nThey have a limited staff -- one waitress (Kim) to serve the entire place (and the quiz usually has 20+ teams), but she's on top of it. Tip her well! As for the guys behind the bar... I've never seen them crack a smile. If you want fish & chips, they are brought in from a place around the corner on Larkin. It could take a while, so if you're starving, you'd be best off just running over there between rounds and grabbing them yourself. \n\nIf you do want to check out the quiz, be sure to get their early. Tables go fast, and if you get there at 8:25 you'll find yourself standing.\n\nAlso, if you come here on a Tuesday, but aren't there for the quiz, beware.

Before they had a vehicle to transport their gear they would use mine putting me there around 8pm waiting for them to play a show which they say starts at 9 but really doesn't get goin till around 11.  Some of the times i have been here I have only had one beer since i had to drive all the equipment back to the Mission. However more recent times the band has found a new way to transport their goods. I get there 30 minutes early just long enough to order a few drinks and walk around socializing. They just got a new sound system going which sounds great. \n\nPros \n* Only $5 to see a band\n* bands play upstairs away from the rest of the bar\n* very spacious \n\nCons\n* Parking is horrible if you are trying to park, but if you are just unloading gear you can go around the back\n* That damn puddle of God only knows that i slipped and fell down on the last drunken time i was there (people laughed, it was sad)\n\nI love this bar.

It's local, and kinda divey, so you know that the folks here are gonna be cool. It's usually a mix-up of random people. I've seen emo kids, hipsters, punks, and business people, all merging together to grab a few drinks and hang out in the evenings.\n\nThe bar is dark, with wood all over the place. The old rickety stairs are kinda scary, but they're cool in their own way. Leading up those rickety stairs is a cool little space where I've seen some great bands playing. Usually a lot of local flavor there, and the people watching the shows are always there for the music, and not because \"someone said it would be cool.\"\n\nI went here once for a pub trivia night...it's kind of a joke. I mean, it's fun, but it's super loud and you can't hear the announcer and typically, it goes on for nearly forever. It's definitely something you can't do if you work early the next morning.\n\nOverall, cool place. Drinks are decent and usual price. Sometimes hard to get a drink at the bar, but that's usual.

The bathrooms are horrendous, I've come in on one night and found one toilet literally being used regardless of it's obvious state of disrepair. Girls giggling and shitting on shit and piss and then pulling their underwear back up over their tights. Hipsters. The booze isn't bad, I don't mind a bar that serves Guinness on tap but then again, so does a few bars in the Loin.\n\nI do remember one fond night, however, where we were surrounded by hipsters outside and my friend (wearing a kilt) decided that for true authenticity he should remove his underwear and promptly did so. In view of all the outdoor chicks and dicks (wearing girl pants tight over their junk, removing all further usage no doubt) who gaped and glared as if the mere disposal of underwear was unheard of.

Back Ithaca ways where I am, I barely even knew about Yelp. \n\nBut this review is not about my history on the other side of the coast; it's about the greatness that is Edinburgh. \n\nYou see, Edinburgh sells itself to me on two principles; it's got charm, and it's not crowded full of a crowd that at most bars could be charitably described as \"lively\" and less politically correct given the name \"preposterous morons\". While some of them show up during the infamous Quiz Night, I make it my business not to, because if I wanted to be around people shouting incorrect answers, I'd go to a campus political demonstration. \n\nEdinburgh is perfectly located around three blocks from my apartment, and is small, and has reasonably priced drinks, and the jukebox is killer. There's all the Joy Division and The Jam and weird obscure funk tunes from the seventies anyone could want, depending on mood. \n\nPlus, Frank is probably the best bartender who I've known in all my days. I'm only twenty-three, but I've cruised enough bars and spent my fair share in the trenches of alcoholism to know a good bartender, and Frank is bad ass. In between a sharp with and tons of amusing stories about knocking head in his years as a bouncer, he makes a mean screwdriver and actually gives a rat's ass if you like the bar, rather than just throwing a drink at you and scowling over a pile of sorted napkins. He certainly improves upon the experience of Edinburgh. \n\nThe other part I enjoy about Edinburgh other than location, price, and bad ass jukebox, is how easy it is to bring friends there. Some bars, you have to introduce, you have to say \"this is such and such a place, you gotta understand the kind of people who hang out here\". Edinburgh is the least pretentious bar I've seen, and for the west coast, that there is an accomplishment. \n\nSince coming to San Francisco and having been dragged too and fro all across drinking holes by all manner of malcontent, I can say that Edinburgh is easily my favorite out of all of them.", "author": "Daniel V."}

The Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology, held annually at the four major Universities of Scotland: Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews.  Past lecturers include Hannah Arendt, John Dewey, Paul Tillich, and Hilary Putnam.  Its stated purpose is to promote the study of God through the natural sciences.  Which basically means the lectures are totally fucking ineffable and full of shit.  \n  \n2. David Hume, empiricist, luminary of the Scottish Enlightenment, and one of Edinburgh's favorite sons.  Contrary to popular belief, Hume was NOT full of shit.  Yeah, I went there, you Kantian bitches can take your fucking Categorical Imperative and shove it up your ass.\n\n3. A portly, bearded redhead who shaves his back and wears a tartan plaid kilt which conceals a monstrous Scottish banger in casing.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these three things can be found in Edinburgh Castle. This shouldn't surprise you -- it didn't surprise me.  Let's face it, I'm a philistine who thinks Scotland is a nation-state on the Iberian peninsula.  And by the way: is there a reason why \"Edinburgh\" is pronounced Ed-in-brah?  I'm not one to generalize, but do the Scots just fucking HATE phoneticism?  Or are they simply trying to drive me crazy, like the rest of you bitches?\n\nSo you will not see Hannah Arendt drinking herself under the table.  You will not see David Hume tossing his Guinness into Bishop Berkeley's face (Idealize THIS, motherfucker!).  And, regrettably, you will not blow on any bagpipes, kilted or not.\n\nWhat you WILL find at Edinburgh Castle is a charming, two-level dive with a multitude of banquettes and booths, a shrine to shoegazing author and poet of the heroin drip Irvine Welsh (Welsh?  In Edinburgh?  Sorry, my ignorance is appalling), the smoothest beer on tap (Smithwick's), and a killer jukebox that contains, among other notable albums, Screamadelica by Primal Scream and Protection by Massive Attack.  \n\nBands habitually play in the room upstairs.  To the Castle's credit, the cover charge for the show is collected at the entrance to the room, and not the entrance to the bar -- now that's pretty fucking righteous.\n\nThey also serve food, though your choices are restricted to standard english pub fare (fish and chips, onion rings) and in fact these deep fried delicacies are actually made at Old Chelsea, the chipper on Larkin.\n\nIf you will allow me the indecorous use of The Royal We, WE met a Pretty Male Friend and a Pretty Female Friend here for drinks. As is customary, our conversation turned ribald once the booze started flowing.  We earlier established that PFF would RATHER fellate an unwashed penis than suck on someone's toes -- don't ask me to explain this, it made no sense to me either, bitch is crazy.\n\nMe: Okay this is interesting.  So PFF I have another question for you.  Let's say you have a foot on the one hand, and an anus on the other.  Which one would you --\nPFF: [flustered] Okay! Okay!  I'd suck the foot!\nPMF: Hmmm.\nMe: And now why is that?\nPFF: Because assholes are dirty.\nPMF: [turning his head away from the table to snicker]\nMe: Well have you ever had -- you know?\nPFF: [shocked] Oh no!  I've never had anal sex. \nMe: Really?\nPFF: Really. That's where the shit comes out, it's not meant for...\nMe: For what?\nPFF: ....\nMe: Not meant for fucking?

Over thirty distinct beers including a fantastic Microbrew list. If you are a beer drinker and into the darker stouts and porters, I'd say get a Moylen's kilt lifter. Five dollars for a pint and 8% by volume is one of the best bangs for your buck, and it tastes great. The over all ambiance is on the hipster side, you'll never find a lack of skinny jeans and thick glasses, but I've never had a problem there. There is an indoor smoking section so nicotine addicts wont be left out in the cold, and an upstairs area that allows for better seating. It is still very much a bar with no real dance floor or music to jam out with. They appear to take credit cards at specific times but never during prime time, so you need to rely on one of the two ATM machines they have, or go across the street.

Why? Several reasons;\n1. Cuz I like whiskies. While I usually don't participate in the Scotch vs Bourbon rivalry, when I want scotch this is the place to go! I brought my twin sis from NYC here cuz we share the same love of whisky and have the same nose and lips. Are they related? I'd go with nurture over nature on this one. The cocktail waitresses and bartenders are sweet, they let us sample two different scotches before each round of scotch on the rocks. Too bad I don't remember which I liked best.\n2. Live music. I even played a show here once and would do it again. Like the Hemlock or Elbo Room, you can drink in one room and if you feel like paying a small cover you can catch some local music in another. Though I think this may be only one or a few times a week. \n3. Rockin juke box. Band upstairs sounds boring, I'd rather have another scotch on the rocks. \n4. Fish and Chips. I always say there needs to be more watering holes that offer food, a fine distinction between restaurant bars. Fish and chips are super sustenance. \n5. Pool table, and a substantial variety of beers on tap, always a bonus.\n6. Smoking area. Well, there isn't one, but guess I can't have everything. five outta six stars.", "author": "Tihani K."}

There are 2 balconies, above each side of the room, accessed from the elevated space in back, and above the entrance to the place is a small room which often has live bands.  The place is done up very Scottish pub-ish, with a caber on the wall in the back, Scottish flags hanging from the ceiling, and the balconies are done as if they're roofs overlooking a street below, contributing a cool olde-worlde feel.\nThere's a big beer selection, including 1 hand-pump cask which is always worth trying.  You can also order fish & chips, which are delivered from the Old Chelsea around the corner.  These are arguably the best fish & chips available in SF - crispy, greasy, thick cut, and totally delicious, served in a rolled up newspaper.  A hot slab o' fried fish, a fresh pint, and you could almost convince yourself you're across the pond.\nOn the downside, I was stunned to find last night that their scotch selection has suffered a dramatic downturn.  They've less than 1/2 the bottles they used to.  I don't know why this is, but it's a sad state of affairs.\nThey also have regular quiz nights and other events, and have an annual Robbie Burns night, honoring the Scottish poet's birthday with bagpiping, poetry reading, and the Mighty Haggis!

If you haven't figured it out yet, this is a pretty big bar, and can easily accommodate you and your twenty closest friends. \n\nI can't recall if I've ever had to pay a cover to get in.

Prices arn't bad and the Juke Box is rocking, but I hate waiting that long for a drink.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

Art, culture, truth, a sense of history, rock bands,literary events, their own publishing house, good selection of single malts and can you say Bellhaven? I can and do repeatedly.\r\n\r\n Crowd is mixed, I like the layout , some of the staff is has been there for years and that friggin mural is amazing. I generally play pool or  go upstairs to check out the music. I never go on the weekends so I can not tell what the crowd is like but i always have fun during the week. Not tryin to hate but those who call this place a dive lack sophistication.

Highly recommended if you want a highland single malt. Has Highland Park, my favorite highland scotch. Conspicuously lacking lowland single malts. The scotch selection is uncharacteristic of some dirty meat market with a pool table. Needs better bathrooms for rails, though.", "author": "Andrew A."}

Indulging one of my sister's infatuations we ventured in in search of fish and chips and a pint.  She had heard that they served the dish in newspaper here, its authentic she said.  Early on a Tuesday evening we walked into the almost empty bar and the first thing that hit us was the overpowering smell of vinegar.  I loathe the smell of vinegar and it started to make me queasy.  We were off to a great start.  If you don't mind the smell, then this might actually be a decent place to hang, that is, if you don't order the food.  All three of us had the fish and chips, one piece of fish and french fries - $5.  Yes, it did come in  a cool newspaper package, but it was the blandest oiliest piece of fish I've ever had - gross!  As if I wasn't already queasy enough because of the smell.  Finally, to add insult to injury, there was something very wrong with my coke, it was almost completely flat and it didn't taste like coke.  The only good thing about this bar was the beer, go for that.", "author": "Nancy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2005-06-10", "description": "When I used to work in SF, I went to Edinburgh often enough that the waitress brought me my Tetley's without asking for an order.  It's been a few years since then and the waitress is long gone and so is the Tetley's.  And the service here has gone way way downhill, at least judging from our experience last night.  The bartender served us promptly, but when we tried to order the fish and chips from the server, she told us she'll be \"right back\" and didn't come back to our table EVER.  She was busy flirting with some other customers while we tried to flag her down or shoot her the \"we're hungry!\" looks without being too obnoxious.  About 40 minutes into this charade, we just sent two people to bring us takeout from the Old Chelsea.  In the mean time, the waitress never returned but we didn't give a shit because we'll probably just get our fish and chips directly from the Old Chelsea from now on.  It was fresher and crispier because it wasn't waiting around to be picked up by the flirting waitress.", "author": "maiko h."}

Then I went on a recent, rather slow Monday night, only to be totally dicked by some old geezer working the bar.  It seems this guy had a hardon for me the second I walked into the room, and he served about 10 people who walked up to the bar AFTER I did before finally serving me--and he only finally did that because another customer who saw this (the geezer was being pretty obvious about it), when asked what he'd like, told the bartender to serve me first.  Then he tells me it's 14.25 for two shots of Jameson?  Maybe my memory is a little hazy, but I don't recall ever being charged prices like those at the Castle before.  Sorry if this comes across as sour grapes, but I never disrespect bartenders, here or anywhere else, I always tip at least a dollar a drink, so when someone pulls something like that for no apparent reason other than he doesn't like the looks of me, then I have to call that out.
