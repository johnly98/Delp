There are a large variety of pastries and buns at this small bakery.  The prices here are super reasonable as well.  Each egg custard was $1 and the were quite tasty.  Super creamy with a crispy flaky shell.  I even ate one the next day and it was still really good.  I do have to give a shout out to the wintermelon cake (sweetheart/wife cake).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-04-26", "description": "Maybe the good reviews are for the items they sold out of that we couldn't try. But 2/3 things we ordered came out pretty disgusting.\n\nWe were walking around Golden Gate Park all day, starving, and craving sweets when we walked by this little bakery. Our favorite Asian bakeries nearby were closed, so we strolled in. \n\nThe entire bakery smelled like cigarettes but no one was smoking outside the entrance. It had to be coming from the back kitchen. No bueno. What if I was pregnant? Food babies don't count, I know, but come on. Not to mention it's highly unappetizing as a bakery should smell like freshly baked goods. STRIKE 1.\n\nNothing really stood out and they were sold out of egg custards and a few other things we wanted. Well we were inside and the lady looked eager to take our order, so we bought 3 mini cakes with yellow and red colored jelly on top (the kind Chinese bakeries often use to write on birthday cakes), 4 pineapple buns with red bean inside, and an eclair. \n\nThe lady charged us a little bit more than what we totaled up, but oh well. Against the principle, but oh well. Not going to argue over that. Still though - STRIKE 2.\n\nThey take cash only. We paid and she handed us our goodie box and as we left, realized she didn't hand us the other half. I ran back in and asked for it, and she hurriedly retrieved it and told us NEXT time we come, she'll give us extra. STRIKE 3 \n\nLet me tell you why we're never coming back...\n\nFirst off, the mini cakes tasted nothing like we expected. Colored jelly/frosting is always artificial but should be very tasty, right? Not here. The jelly had gone bad or they used too much chemical coloring and no other flavoring. The red jelly had zero flavor. Bland, fine. That sucks, but not as much as the yellow one sucked. It had a bitter, plastic-like aftertaste that was bad enough that I spat it out immediately. It's probably that same infamous yellow 5 in Mountain Dew that kills your sperm. Or something worse that kills your liver. DO NOT ORDER ANY CAKE WITH JELLY IN IT. STRIKE 4.\n\nThe cake inside and white cream on top was very plain and lacked that light fluffiness you expect from Chinese cakes. No flavor, too. Perhaps if that had more flavor it would mask the nasty jelly flavor, but nope. \n\nThe eclair had a very weird after taste, and I'll tell you how bad it was now.\n\n1. As soon as we picked it up the chocolate on top completely flaked off. Weird. \n2. The cream inside had an odd aftertaste, like they used a bunch of fillers. The main ingredient in custard is egg yolk. That's what makes it rich, creamy, and yellow. \n3. That weird bitterness we tasted in that yellow jelly returned. DAMN IT STOP USING THAT NASTY YELLOW #5. \n4. The baked outer portion tasted like it sat in a fridge for days. Safeway eclairs taste 10x better... STRIKE 5.\n\nAs for the 4 red bean pineapple buns, they were pretty standard, didn't taste old or stale like the other items but could have had a lot more sweet crumbles on top, and more red bean inside. 3/5.\n\nOverall 2/5 not coming back.", "author": "Ivy C."}

I knew that there were quite a few options in the area but I came here solely because it was on the way back to my car. \n\nIn looking through the window from the street this place is a bit small. When you walk inside you first encounter the few tables, fridges to the right, and the pastry case directly in front of you.\n\nThe selection that I saw when I walked in was somewhat unique to some of the other Chinese bakeries that I have been to. The walnut cake was something that I haven't seen in other bakeries. The cheesecake looked really good as well, it is in slices. The fridge is comprised of juices and sodas. \n\nThe best part about this place would have to be the prices. Most of the individual items range from $0.80 to roughly $1.20 or so depending on the item. Either way that is a pretty sweet deal.\n\nI went with a basic option because I need to get going so I bought some chocolate chip cookies. They cookies were OK. The cookies were a bit hard but not stale. I was looking for that gratifying taste that I typically get when biting into a chocolate chip cookie but this place missed the mark. Not sure how long the cookies had been out or how fresh they were but the toughness to the cookies was a bit of a challenge for me.\n\nI would could back to sample some of their cakes.

All at a ridiculous low price and unbelievably delicious! My go to spot in the city for baked goods!\n\nLocated in an area of limited parking between Kirkham and Judah on 9th, you most likely will have to park far and walk or pull an illegal parking job to reach the bakery. Or take the muni. They have a stop right out front. But trust me, it's worth it. \n\nThe shop is pretty small. So if you come during a busy rush hour, it's going to feel cramped. But order away at the counter. Best sellers are definitely the Pineapple buns which sell out quick at 80 cents a piece. Super flakey and soft and buttery. I can see why it sells quick. And also BBQ Pork Buns at approx 1.20 a piece. Affordable with a good amount of sweet BBQ pork and just the amount of soft bread wrapped around it. Unlike most places that mostly wrap the non-existent meat with bread. I have to say probably the most delicious pork buns out there! And I have had my share. I tried their curry meat bun, coconut bun, and egg tarts as well and they are all so delicious. Even stored for days later and still good. \n\nThey also are constantly busy for their strawberry sponge cake. I have to say I haven't bought a sheet of it yet for a party (planning on it), but usually just buy slices to go (less than $3!). The cream is light and not overly sweet and compliments the soft sponge perfectly. The fresh strawberries adds to the perfect amount of sweet you want in a cake. Don't go expecting Kara or Sprinkles level sweet, just light enough to hit and satisfy your sweet tooth. I asked the ladies behind the counter how long it usually takes to call in an order. They said call the same day and we can have it ready! Now isn't that something! \n\nNot looking for an Asian treat, no worries. They also sell plain muffins, cupcakes, and cookies as well! I haven't tried, but the prices are definitely appealing. \n\nService is amazing. When they're slow (come early morning to get your goods), they start small talk and get to know their customers.

Asian cakes tend to be lighter and filled with fruit. Their staples are mixed fruit and strawberry cakes...at least from my last stop. \n\nTheir prices are reasonable but they take cash only...which likely helps keep costs down. They sell cakes in various rounds and sheet sizes and even at 4pm they still had enough of selection to match the party size I was expecting.

I switched to English but the service did not improve. When I asked if they deliver on Sundays, I could feel her rolling her eyes as she replied \"yes of course, why would we not.\" She seemed so annoyed on the call and refused to give me a starting price on a three-tier cakes and said I had to show up in person for this basic information. Lady, I'm based in LA and some minimal consideration would be nice. You also have Chinese characters on your cake boxes but give me shit for speaking Chinese?

The pineapple bun with just the perfect amount of flakiness will leave you smiling and wishing you have bought more. Also don't forget the cakes, strawberry cake which is my personal favorite is moist and delicious not to sweet. The strawberries are actually sweet and not sour like some bakeries.

The Asian suburbia has better Asian restaurants, better milk tea, and, of course, more space and cleanliness. Unfortunately, this Asian suburbia also has more fog and more expensive grocery stores, dimsum, and baked goods. Opportunity costs, opportunity costs.\n\nSunset Bakery is a small modest bakery that stocks affordable Asian pastries. They don't tout the same fluffy-wuffy theme that the bakery branches like Sheng Kee and Kee Wah boast, which makes them more like a Chinatown bakery transplant.\n\nI snagged a $0.70 PINEAPPLE BUN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunset-bakery-san-francisco?select=WqVain3uFFK-oPTdOGn9Xw#A08BmoAfvxnvaW_2gi6Xvg), which did its duty in curbing my hunger. The sugary crust top is a bit drier than those I've tried in Chinatown--perhaps they use less lard, making it less oily. Or perhaps they bake it longer, since the bread dough is soft and chewy but isn't as pliant as others I've had. Not bad, but I would prefer a pineapple bun from Chinatown.\n\nI give them 3.5 stars, but I would have to try more of their items to round up to 4.\n\nSide note: they have full custard pies and apple pies for $7.

I arrived at Sunset Bakery on a stormy Saturday morning to order a full sheet birthday cake for the party. It was a nautical theme party and I was expecting to pick one of the sugar sheet designs from their collections. Unfortunately, they didn't have anything that match our nautical theme. I was in panic mode as the party was in two weeks. The lady at the front was super nice to comfort me that I still had time and didn't need to rush to pick a design that didn't match our theme. She suggested that I could find a design that I like and their baker can try to draw it on the cake. I came back few days later and gave them a drawing for the cake. The baker confirmed he could do it! I was happy to hear they could draw the design yet a bit skeptical and worried the outcome wouldn't be what I have envision. When I picked up the cake, I was very happy to see the result has exceeded my expectation! It matched our party decoration perfectly and the strawberry filled cake was light and fluffy. All of our guests enjoyed the cake a lot! \n\nI chose Sunset Bakery because I had also ordered my wedding cake from them five years ago. The cake came out beautiful and I remembered they accommodated our request to deliver the cake earlier for our decoration! It was a 5-tiers sponge cake with fruit filling at reasonable price. I definitely recommend Sunset Bakery to my friends and family!", "author": "Christina C."}

I didn't want to deal with the parking hassles around Clement and Geary, so I put out an inquiry on Facebook for suggestions for bakeries in the Inner Sunset area.  Within a few minutes my cousin pointed me to this place.  I was fortunate enough to find parking nearby and walked up to the store, only to discover that I had actually been here before.  As compared to the Chinatown bakeries it's quite small with a limited selection of items, but what they do have is very good.  The pineapple buns (I grew up calling them sweet top buns) were among the best that I've had.  They were huge and the topping actually stayed crisp all day long.  Often, these get a little soggy if you don't eat them right away,  The egg custards were very good, but the crust was not as flaky as I prefer.  On the plus side, it also wasn't as greasy as the flaky crust tends to be.  The baked BBQ pork buns were quite tasty, but the pork itself was perhaps just a little overseasoned.  However, the bread was moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  Overall, we were very pleased with this place and I expect that I'll be stopping by frequently whenever I find myself back at UCSF.", "author": "Lee L."}

I was hoping to get up to 199 at the end of 2014, but totally forgot.. *le sigh* .. so in place of it, my first review for 2015 will be a good one! \n\nA new year, means new beginnings. This post is dedicated for my amazing boyfriend! Happy 24th Birthday babe! (New Year's baby ;D) \n\nFirst off, let me say asian birthday cakes are the best birthday cakes. The light frosting, minimal design, sponge cake filled with fruits. Everything is so simple, yet so delicious....yum.. \n\nSunset Bakery is located right around the corner on 9th Ave & Irving. Parking is hard cause it's Irving. Service was great, as one of the women helped me immediately. A plus about the service is, they speak English too! The place is small, with probably about 10 2-4-seater tables & chairs. CASH ONLY! \n\nSunset Bakery offers a good variety of asian pastries such as lemon, cream, and chocolate-filled cakes, pineapple buns, cookies, egg tarts, and much more. This includes asian birthday cakes! They have a lot of birthday cakes already prepared in a fridge next to the front counter - all made, ready to go! You have the option of the strawberry-only cake or mixed-fruit cake. I think for the price of a cake in general (or just Asian cakes I guess...), it's pretty cheap. A small cake serves 8-10 people and is $19. For $2 more ($21), it can serve 10-12 people. If you'd like a bigger cake, I highly suggest calling a week in advance or something. From the pictures, it seems like they also make wedding cakes! \n\nI bought the large mixed fruit cake ($21) and it was delish! It's filled with bits of melons, kiwi, oranges, strawberries, cream, and other fruits... If this isn't enough info for you, just trust me; it's delicious. The strawberry cake is filled with cream & strawberries. Looking at other reviews, they seem to be a popular one here. Though, I do prefer strawberries, the birthday boy prefers mixed-fruit, haha. If you would like a taste of the strawberry cake before buying a whole cake, the bakery does sell slices of strawberry cakes for about $2 per slice. \n\nOverall, I would definitely be coming back for more birthday cakes! \n(Hint to the BF: I want an asian strawberry cake for my birthday!! ;D)\nMy boyfriend loved the cake so much, his mom just told him to buy his own cake this year and he wants to come back here to make the purchase! I guess I made a smart choice ;) \nThe price for cakes & pastries is quite reasonable and highly suggest you to come here for a snack or cake! :)", "author": "Mandy G."}

Over the past 15+ years, I've tried other Asian bakeries in the city and down in the south bay, some of which have well  known names, but nothing compares to Sunset Bakery's quality, consistency, and price.  The buns were $0.70 for the longest time and just recently increased to $0.80 each - this is still amazing compared to $1.25-$2.00 each some of shops charge in Mountain View and Cupertino.  I make a point to stop by here every time I visit my parents in the city - make sure to come before 3pm because they sell out of this popular item.\n\nMy parents always came here for their fruit filled birthday cakes made with light and fluffy layers of yellow cake and real whipped cream.

Lots of cheap, fresh buns, cakes and other baked goods. Great friendly service. Bilingual staff. Most baked goods are around $1 or under.

There's a few chairs and tables inside, but mostly people take their goods to-go.\n\nMy favorite item by far is their green onion bun -- always comes to me fresh, warm, and moist.

Egg tarts: pretty good but not amazing. The crust was flaky and the custard wasn't to sweet, but not memorable. All the other pastries there looked meh and definitely not fresh.

Needless to say, I've sampled a little bit of everything from them.\n\nTheir egg tarts are always delicious and the crust is always done right. I prefer mine a little more toasted, but that's just my own personal taste.\n\nTheir hot dog buns, green onion bread, bbq pork bun, and pineapple bun are very authentic. I grew up in Hong Kong and go back almost every year, so imagine my delight when I found a place in the US that did it right! They use the same ingredients and techniques that they do in Hong Kong, and the quality never falters.\n\nI've also ordered a regular white/sponge cake from them, and it's pretty much perfect. The cake is soft yet firm, and the flavour is subtle. The icing/cream is very light unlike most American cakes, but that's what a Chinese cake is supposed to be like! They also use fresh fruit unlike some other bakeries (I saw them cutting the fruit in the kitchen), so that is a definite plus for your money.\n\nThere is a bit of seating inside the shop and newspapers to read if you're planning to stay, but there's quite a few parks and the botanical garden nearby which makes the location great for getting a snack with friends.\n\nIn case anyone didn't know, they bake their stuff fresh daily and never serve anything that was baked the day before, and so you know you're getting your money's worth!

All that for about $6. \n\nTheir buns are so yummy!  I would eat their bread the same day to make sure the bread stays chewy and soft...thinking about it makes me hungry. \n\n1. Strawberry cake: not too sweet with pretty fresh strawberries, the cake itself is a little dry on the top later but moist on the bottom layer probably because of the strawberries. Cream is not too sweet, but the cake itself is sweet so it all worked out pretty well overall ($2.25 per slice)\n\n2. Cream bun: was gonna save half for later but ended up eating the whole thing...bread is so good! They put some coconut flakes on top of the bread and cream in between. I had to scrape a lil bit of cream out when eating it but it was really good, couldn't stop eating it. Good with coffee if you have some. \n\n3. Pineapple bun: the top layer crust is flaky, sweet, and buttery. The bread is very soft and delicious, pretty much like any of their breads. More like cantonese style than taiwanese style pineapple bun.\n\n4. BBQ pork bun: Kept heated and was warm when I got mine. The BBQ pork is pretty good, not too much fatty meat, quite tasty. The only thing I think I didn't like as much is the sweetness of the bun, would prefer it to be less sweet because the BBQ pork is already kinda sweet.\n\n5. Egg tart: came here for this but was least impressed by it. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just did not stand out compare to their other buns.\n\nDefinitely will come back for more if i'm in the inner sunset!", "author": "Whitney W."}

I've been a patron (though in my formative elementary school years, it was my parents who were patrons because they had money) of Sunset Bakery for going on twenty years. Their pastries'  tastes have stayed the same for all those years. They haven't reduced the size or quality of their items and yet the price feels like highway robbery. It's not the same price as that of the late 1980s (yes I just dated myself) but you have to account for inflation. \n\nTheir cocktail bun is warm and the filling is gooey with coconut, sesame seed goodness. The ratio of gooey filling to bread is just right: 50/50. The warm buns that sell out the fastest in the morning are....Pshaw like I'm going to post them and let them disappear even faster.

I found Sunset Bakery on yelp while searching for an inexpensive wedding cake baker. Most bakeries I researched charged upwards of $4 per slice and Sunset Bakery was by far the least expensive option I came across. \n\nFor the wedding cake, we paid approximately $340 for a 5-tier cake (serves 200), which included delivery to Fisherman's Wharf. The basic price was less but there are surcharges for different flavors. The counter girl was pretty helpful in explaining the pricing and gave us a sample of the type of ribbon that works best with the frosting. \n\nUnfortunately, the bakery doesn't have samples of most of their flavors. I was considering the chestnut filling for one of the layers of our wedding cake but couldn't sample it. Instead, I ordered it for my bridal shower cake and found that I didn't care for the flavor. I was expecting it to be like the chestnut cream cake from Sheng Kee (one of my faves), but the chestnut filling had a heavy consistency and the texture was kind of chunky. The cake was light and moist though. \n\nFor our wedding cake, we chose chocolate with strawberries, yellow with strawberries, and chocolate with mocha cream. The designs are fairly simple, but I was more concerned about how the cake tasted. The cake again was really light and moist, the frosting wasn't too sweet, and the strawberries were fresh.

So light in fact, I'm almost obliged to have more than one slice because something this airy can't be all that bad for you.\n\nAnd for the price and flavor and feelings of euphoria, I'm thinking I should buy their strawberry shortcake more often - like every other week more often.\n\nMoreover, their strawberry shortcake is such a nice pick me up that it should not be limited to having an occasion.\nIt's just one of those things that are nice to have once in awhile.\nHere some possible reasons I'm thinking of getting another:\nIt's Tuesday\nor\nIt's Thursday\nor\nWork Sucks Day\nor\nMe Want Food\nor\n*insert own reason here*", "author": "Dan B."}

Therefore as the loving-daughter, she did all the necessary arrangement for a memorable anniversary gathering, including calling and picking up a cake from one of the parent's favorite Chinese bakeries in San Francisco. With many positive reviews, this bakery is also a favorite of Yelp with the sticker on the glass door. \n\nI'm not too fond of enjoying dinner or any special gathering at their crib. Her parents obviously love her daughter and our kids, but not me. \n\nWhy?  \n\n\"Matt is too condescending, arrogant and \"way\" too \"Joe Cool\" for them.\" You can easily tell that our wedding and my graduate from the academy was bit rough getting my family and her family to get along. \"Hey, I pay most of the bills around the house and feed my kids cupcakes! Do I get any respect?\"\n\nAt their crib, the whole family and relatives chatted and reminiscing the past and other BS in the living room. While me, I was in my wife's childhood and occasional bedroom to privately enjoy the slice of Sunset Bakery's Strawberry Cake by my lonesome self. The strawberry cake has chunks of fresh strawberries and a thick ass cream and frosting for design that makes Elizabeth Faulkner to be thrill. Unfortunately, my slice of cake has a heart symbol on that slice. Hopefully with that heart shape on that slice, her parents will respect me as a real gentleman and true father and loving husband and not as a \"thug\" or a \"gangsta-asian\". \n\nFor a Chinese-style dessert, that unique slice of cake was very fresh with the colorful strawberries and tasty despite enjoying the treat on enemy's turf. Wife also bought a 12 pack of egg custard tart for my family to enjoy for breakfast for the next couple of days. The $1.00 tart may be on the same page with Chinatown's Golden Gate Bakery, but still it was piping hot and fresh. Since this is a Chinese bakery, she paid her $20.00 cake and $12.00 custards in cash. \n\nWe don't come out to the Sunset often, but this Chinese bakery is one of the better ones in that area.", "author": "Matt G."}

He would normally get a slice of the lemon curd cake, and I'd get an apple struedel or a BBQ pork bun.

Then Sunset Bakery is your answer.  The cakes are the spongy -- almost like angel food cake -- texture, very light, with a nice vanilla flavor.  Frosting is (real) whipped cream, and they decorate the cakes with fresh strawberries.  They'll also add any greetings you wish.  You can get traditional round cakes (medium serves about 8, large serves about 12).  \n\nFor large groups, I've ordered 1/2 sheets and full sheet cakes and they were eagerly gobbled by the event participants.  (I also noticed that people didn't leave behind the icing, as is the case with the Costco too-sweet frosting cakes.)  \n\nIn addition to the white cake, you can also request chocolate -- it's not a deep, rich chocolate like you'd get at Tartine, but rather a chocolate-flavored sponge cake.  Even still, it's yummy.  \n\nPrices are very reasonable -- call them for quotes (be patient -- some of the workers here don't speak English).  Bring cash -- they don't take credit cards.  \n\nWhen you pick up your cake, buy a pork bao for you and your driver for the trip home.  \n\nFour stars only for two reasons: \n1) parking really sucks -- it's good to go with someone who will wait in the car while you block someone's driveway, otherwise, you'll be tempted to park in the bus zone, where you're guaranteed a ticket on this heavily patrolled street. \n2) I wish the premises were a bit less grimy -- like so many other similar independent bakeries, it really needs a deep steam cleaning.", "author": "Bevy M."}

They are located in a busy area so parking was always hard to find.  I recently purchased a 3 tier birthday cake from them and it was WAY cheaper than any other place ($200).  They do deliver for a $50+ (minimum) depending on how far your location is, but I say get the cake on pillars and transport it yourself.  Or that's what we did at least.  Yes, it may be a bit of a stress factor, but we did it just fine without one single dent.  Just make sure to have PLENTY PLENTY PLENTY of towels or THICK blankets and a CLEARED out trunk.\n\nYou can see all the little holes and such on the cake, so they do not use the fondant that the majority of bakeries use out there now a days, so the visual quality isn't as great (-1 star), but hey ... you get what you pay for.  (And to be honest, $200 for a 3 tier white cake with fresh fruit and cream filling -- I can say that we got more for our buck at this place.)\n\nYou do have to return the pillars during the next following days or they will keep your deposit (they have you put down a deposit for them, ours was about $25).  Also they must be clean or they take half of your deposit.  I think that this is a great idea seeing as to how people don't ever need those pillars anyways ... they just get thrown away, when we had to pay extra for them.  So instead you pay a deposit to \"borrow\" them and then return them when your done.  Genius.\n\nAlso  this place is cash only, so if you did want to get a cake then the order must be placed at least 2 weeks in advance and paid in full with cash.\n\nThe cake itself tasted great.  The white cake was very soft and the filling, very creamy.  The fruit still tasted very fresh and everyone was delighted.\n\nAlthough I have not had a chance to really try any of their other pastries, I might be going back in soon for a visit.  If their cake was that good I'm going to assume that the rest of their selection is up to par as well.\n\nI'll be visiting again soon ... and as always if there's anything new, I'll update.\n\n(I'll also post pictures of the cake once I get them from the photographer =).)", "author": "Pia V."}

I make a stop every time I go home to see the 'rents.\n\nBUNS:  Mmmmm. Pineapple Bun.  Weird that the English name for Bo-luo bao is Pineapple Bun when really, there's no pineapple in it... maybe because it looks like a pineapple? Either way, delicious.  Also yummy green onion rolls, cocktail bun (I mean c'mon how can you NOT love butter and coconut slathered together?) and their sponge cakes are not bad.  Definitely better than the crazy dense sweet birthday cakes you get at Safeway or the like.  This place is Dr. Atkins' worse nightmare and a carb wh*re's dream.  Perfect for me!\n\nAMBIENCE: Small, crowded, and looks EXACTLY as it did 20+ years ago.  I guess these ladies' mantra is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  I guess there's nothing to fix too because no matter when I come, even when they open at 7 in the morning, there's a line out the door.  Chinese contractors in their paint-stained overalls and baseball caps that they got for free at the casinos (c'mon Chinese people you KNOW this is true and you're probably related to someone who fits this description) still make daily stops here.

Oh and make sure you have cash, I don't believe they accept credit cards here because well... Chinese people like green...\n\nPRICES: Which is ok because sheezus where else in the city do you get breakfast for under a buck.  At least, that was how much stuff was when I visited a month ago.  Buns are under a dollar and feed a grown man.  There's also a variety to choose (I just listed the veggie ones) so you have a rather choice menu at hand for cheap.

Time to put the \"Which Bay Area restaurant / bakery has the best Chinese BBQ pork buns?\" discussion to rest because Sunset Bakery is FTW.  The buck stops here.  Stick a fork in it, it's done.  This place is LEGIT.\n\nThe large BBQ pork buns are $1.00 each.  The pork buns are absolute perfection.  Perfectly baked, sweet bread with a generous heaping of deliciously marinated Chinese BBQ nestled inside the bun.  The outside is a golden brown, soft and sweet.\n\nThe buns are freshly baked.  I once came in and asked for 2 dozen pork buns and they said they'd make and bake it fresh for me right then and there.  Of course I waited for 20 minutes, but TOTALLY worht the wait.\n\nAlso, the pork buns are HUGE.  Forget those little pork buns that are $.60, $.80, or even $1.10.  These pork buns, especially out of the oven when they're all fluffy and warm, are like... the size of my face!  Granted I'm not a huge giant of a person, but these pork buns are bigger than my palm.  You get the bang for your buck AND there isn't any sacrifice on taste, quantity or quality.\n\nAs for their cakes-- DELICIOUS.  If you like Chinese sponge cake, you can get that same texture and consistency here in its cakes.  I seriously would have my wedding cake done here.

Two co-workers in a row requested a cake without super-sweet, heavy frosting and with fresh fruit. I turned to Yelp to help me out, and everyone was right - the white cake with whipped cream frosting and fresh strawberries is GOOD.\n\nWhile I have an healthy sweet tooth, I don't like the typical, grocery-store-cake frosting, so this was a great change. The cake was moist, the frosting was just sweet enough, and the berries were fresh and tasty.\n\nBoth transactions were super easy and the cakes are inexpensive. $18 for a 9\" inch cake that fed 15-16 people ain't bad. Cash only though, beware. I didn't have any trouble relaying my desired writing for the top either. I'd definitely like to go back sometime and try some other stuff!", "author": "Carmen B."}

It was created in early 19th century by nuns in Portugal (not a lot of people had access to eggs and sugar like nuns did back then-hence the term conventual cooking, an elaborate cooking \"genre\" filled with goodies.\nUpon the liberation revolution the monastery where the egg tarts were made was closed, and the recipe was bought by a merchant that soon turn them into a local success. The years went by, many versions of the recipe were created, and the tarts popularity became undeniable. The Portuguese connection with Macau and china made the recipe \"swim\"all the way over to the other side of the world, becoming pretty popular over there too. \nThe Guardian considered pasteis de nata de 15th most delicious stuff to eat (I don't remember the exact name of the category), and still, every time I sink my teeth in them at the sunset bakery to have a taste of home I struggle understanding why don't they have the full recipe. The chinese version is more puddingy, not as creamy and silky as the Portuguese version, you don't quite feel the lemon and the cinnamon (that should be infused in the milk before the milk is mixed with the eggs) and they don't caramelize the top of the tart (as it is traditionally done) or sprinkle it with cinnamon (the finishing of a lot of conventual desserts) .\n\nDespite the incomplete tart I still love this place and go there often :)", "author": "Bea L."}

However it seems the girl that hubby talked to 2 weeks prior the wedding to drop off the check did not know what she was doing as well. Also hubby was not happy they waited until wedding day to check if the ribbon was enough so hubby had to buy another roll and drop it off that morning. Hence the 1 star off.

I bought a whole cake for 10 people, a chicken bun, and a sponge cake.  Everything was less than $20!!!  Unbelievable.  I ate the chicken bun and sponge cake before I set foot outside the door.  I am half way done with the cake.  The chicken bun isn't the normal steamed chicken bun.  Its the baked version.  The chicken filling resembled a chicken pot pie.  It was good.  I am definitely going back to buy me a 20 person cake.", "author": "Fatty A."}

Believe me, as a child, I grew up eating several different types of the so called 'Chinese Cake' or 'Chinese Fruit Cake' and there is no other bakery that makes these type of cakes the way they do.  I'm also someone who typically eats only the cake portion of cakes, disposing of any frosting, fudge, or creme.  That stuff is usually too sweet and heavy.  However, the light whipped frosting that covers the exterior and separates the cake layers is delish!  Very light and not too sweet!  Now, the type of cakes I've been raving about above are only the spongy yellow fruit cakes.  They also sell chocolate cakes which in my opinion are not that good.  Chinese bakeries are not known for making good chocolate cakes.  They are light brown in color with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Personally, the chocolate cakes at Safeway or Luckys is better.\n\nI've not tasted any of the baked buns or other pasteries as I work close to Chinatown and will walk there to purchase those.\n\nPros: \n1. Great fruit cakes\n2. Friendly staff\n\nCons: \n1. Parking (I usually have my bf pull into the next door driveway and wait for me while I run in)\n2. Does not except credit cards\n3.

Really. \n\nThe first time we went there, a young Chinese woman/girl was working behind the counter. Since she was Chinese, I spoke to her in Chinese, even though my own Chinese is not the best. Well, she refused to respond in Chinese even though it was obvious she understood what I said because she responded to all my questions perfectly...in English. I. Can't. Stand. People. Like. Her. Oh, she never cracked a smile. \n\nThe second and definitely last time I went there was earlier today with my two kids. Behind the counter was an elderly Chinese woman. I spoke to her in Cantonese. That was not the problem this time. Instead she was downright rude. I asked her a question about one of the cakes I was not familiar with. Instead of answering me, she came from behind the counter and told me to \"you watch your kids!\" because they were touching their help-yourself paper coffee cups that they stupidly placed at children's height. Then she went back to the counter and rang me up: $6.80. I handed her $7 and waited for my change. And waited. It never came. She then came around the counter again and said that I had to pay for the two paper cups my kids grabbed! At 10 cents each! Do the math. Yep, that adds up to $7. How convenient. Coincidence? I think not. I gave her a piece of my mind: \"I can't believe you charged me for paper cups. These are kids. Five and two year olds! If it were me, an adult, I could see that. But two toddlers?!!\" She said it was not her decision, but that it was the boss' policy. Had I not already grabbed my purchase, I would have left it there on the counter and taken my money. On our way out, I emphatically threw the cups into their garbage can and said \"Don't count on my business again!!\" And walked out. Yes, a little dramatic, but I think my message got through. The two elderly customers sitting there stopped and looked. The cooks in the back came out and looked. Another customer walking in wondered what was all the commotion. Oh, the elderly woman never cracked a smile. Must be the younger woman's mom. Sourpuss face must be hereditary. \n\nThis was my first review on Yelp. Why doesn't Yelp allow zero stars!?

I didn't expect to order a wedding cake from the same bakery that provided my favorite childhood breakfast staple (pineapple buns, mmm) but the price was right, the light cake suited my guests' palates, and they needed only two weeks' notice! True, they're not famous for elaborate designs, but I saw a cake in their repertoire that I liked and provided the ribbon for decoration. I had my florist make a floral a cake topper, too.\n\nThere was a little hitch in the process because the bakery outsources cake delivery and the deliverymen initially refused to stop in front of a downtown venue for fear of accumulating parking tickets. However, the bakers were gracious in staying in touch with me and finding another deliveryman who eventually conceded to make the delivery. \n\nOne minor drawback for me was that the fresh fruit selection for the cake filling is limited (no mango :(). But still, a great experience.", "author": "Ellen Y."}

The cake was light and spongy and the frosting was light and just a tad sweet, not too sweet where you have to scoop it off to the side of your cake plate and leave it there while you eat the rest of the cake. You know what I mean? You know who you are, we've all done it! The best part is the service. I walked in there thinking that I would have to speak in my not so good chinese, but the gals at the counter were bilingual. Since it was last minute, I was thinking that there would be slim pickings..... not at all! There were actually cakes in the frig to the right when you walk in. There were large square cakes to smaller round cakes to choose from. At first I chose the smallest cake that they had to offer, but the gal at the counter mentioned that if I bought a size bigger, it would only be like 4 dollars more. Now what a deal! I couldn't pass up a bigger cake for a better price, now could I?  I chose the cake with mixed fruit on the inside and they whisked it back to the baker to have them put the saying that I had chosen and POOF, I was out the door with cake in hand. To me the hardest thing was my decision on which cake to choose from, so be prepared to either pick some sort of fruit filled cake, which is super fresh or a chocolate type cake. If it was my choice, I would have chosen a chocolate cake, but alas the cake wasn't for me. So hint hint to whoever reads this and is planning to get a cake for me...... get me the chocolate one.", "author": "carebear l."}

My family have been ordering our cakes & pies here for at least 20 years. When I recently ordered a cake to be picked at 4pm sometime during a weekend, the girl I spoke to said, \"Well, we close at 5pm, if you're late...oh well.\" I was really appalled by her response. There is a better way to ask customers to be on time.  When I got there, the same girl was working the counter. She showed no enthusiasm at all.  I hear this place is under new management but c'mon now...don't you think you should uphold the same customer service as the previous owners?! So with the sucky customer service plus the fact that it's hard to find parking in this area (my family and I never cared about this before), I'm not sure if I'll ever come here again.  If they want to keep their customers, they should go teach their staff some customer service skills.  My brother can attest to this...he recently bought something from this place. After he sends me a texts and says,\"You're right, they are mean.\"", "author": "Rose E."}

Our guests were thoroughly impressed by the appearance and taste of the cake.  We chose a mocha cake with fresh strawberry filling.  The cake was moist, light, and airy.  The strawberries were sweet and mouth-wateringly delicious and smothered in whipped cream.  The frosting was fresh and sweet but not overly sweet.  We have come to know the owner and his family and have found them to be such pleasant and generous people.  I highly recommend this bakery!!", "author": "Andrew W."}

The pies are popular during holidays so it is best to call in your order.", "author": "c v."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-02-09", "description": "We were over at the Sunset bakery the other day asking for information about wedding cakes based on the good reviews here.  However, it was a disappointment that the two young employees were not very helpful at all.  They seemed to be more interested in talking on the phone or eating their lunch than answering our questions.  We were pretty much put off by their indifference and have decided to go with a bakery with better customer service.  Their price is very competitive but with the employees' attitudes, we could not justify giving them our business.  We hope that other people have a better experience with this bakery.", "author": "har g."}

However, I rather find it annoying. BUT, the lady who works there was so rude and taking my order took her almost an hour, since she is the only one who works with customers. While trying to finalize my order and get all the desired explanations, I received only jokes towards me in Chinese.  I found myself not knowing how to react (To say something  nasty in my first language? No way). By the way, I was not ordering three buns or a roll, but a wedding cake for which she insisted me to pay immediately in cash, making some nonsense excuse for not taking only a deposit.  I'm a sugar junkie and they just killed my curiosity for the cake....And I finally ordered the cake, which came out exactly how I expected: nothing special, ok,  the frosting wasn't tasty. When it got to talking to them about the delivery, I simply gave my phone to my husband who, after a short conversation felt the same way I had felt before- at the edge to get a nerve break. The only good thing about this experience was the price of the cake!", "author": "Snezana A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-10", "description": "My husband wanted a vanilla layer cake with coconut frosting for his birthday party.  Simple, right?  Well, no.  I called many fancy bakeries, offering taste bud-numbing, over-the-top creations like triple fudge caramel cake for exorbitant prices.  When I told them what I wanted, they treated my request for a simple vanilla cake with coconut frosting with disdain.  So I called Sunset Bakery.  The person who took my order listened to what I wanted and said, \"No problem.\"  The cake was ready at the scheduled pick-up time, and was an incredible value.  Most importantly, my husband and all of our party guests raved about the cake.  Moist, incredibly light vanilla cake.  Perfect frosting.  It wasn't too sweet, tasted like fresh cream, and had flakes of moist, chewy coconut.  As a bonus, the cake was bordered with fresh strawberry and tangerine slices.  I'm using Sunset Bakery from now on for all of our entertaining needs.", "author": "A W."}
