Now give me a kiss!\n\nIn all seriousness, who would've thought you can get a solid silver bullet from the NoPa area? For $10.00, which is the average cost in the area, I get a grilled Carne Asada, fresh and sharp cheddar cheese, a perfect amount of guacamole, sour cream, salsa, beans and rice in a flour tortilla. The grilled steak had a nice crunch and bursting with smoky flavor. The taqueria also offer different kinds of tortillas. But I am cool with the standard white tortilla as the wrap. \n\nYou know I got to have a brew with my wrap. The taqueria also sell Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and a few draught brews for $4.50 a bottle. Now my meal is complete. \n\nThe salsa bar has various condiments including grilled onions and mushrooms. Those two are very popular and goes very quickly. \n\nThis is one of few along the Divisadero Street strip and NoPa area. But the food from this taqueria is really good. The cleanliness is a bit a work in progress. But I am all about a good burrito.", "author": "Matt G."}

I ordered the chicken flautas (corn fried chicken rolls) which came with a side of rice, beans, gauc and sour cream. Everything was how you want your food to be when you're extremely hungry.

It was our very last night in SF and we really want to end with a good food spot, especially the last taco spot we tried right before this place, was a huge disappointment. It was just about 10:30 pm at night, we walked out of our hotel with pajamas and we were determined get better tacos here. \n\nWhen we got here, it was already looking better because this is how a taco spot is supposed to look! We saw the garnish bar where you can grab your red sauce, green sauce, beets, limes, and etc. Yes!!! For the food, we ordered three tacos: lengua, al pastor, and carnitas. We also got a side of guacamole to go with it. All three tacos were really good! Lengua Taco had to be my favorite. Each bite was the perfect mouth-sized and the meat was so tender that it just melts in my mouth. Al Pastor was a close second, I probably would like more pineapple bites in mine. Carnitas was also tender and flavorful as well. \n\nWe were both so satisfied with the tacos and could leave SF with a happy stomach!", "author": "Cynthia D."}

The ingredients overall seem a bit subpar. The beans are not fully cooked, the rice felt more grainy than usual and the guac was not as tasty. I felt the vegetables tended to dominate each bite a bit more than the other ingredients, which are supposed to have more flavor. There was also free chips and salsa. The salsas were fantastic but the chips were extremely hard and tough to eat.\n\nI would recommend coming here if you're in the area, but maybe go for one of the specialty plates or something.", "author": "Sampath D."}

I got the al pastor and the lengua (pleasant surprise, no upcharge). \n\nWhen they came out with my tacos, I was shocked. The super taco is called super taco for a reason. It's topped with all kinds of things with 2 corn tortilla (each) under all the toppings. It was delicious and super filling.

The shrimp was meaty and their carne asada was grilled just right. Their food isn't salty either, which is always a plus.

That was our first mistake, ordering two dishes with two people because the plates came out to be huge! We ended up taking home the leftovers. We thought the carne asada was made just right so that is was still tender and juicy. The burrito was stuffed with lots of meat and had little beans and rice. The salsa, guacamole, and sour cream poured over the burrito were also paired really well. As for the nachos, it was also layered with delicious carne asada, beans, tomatoes, and guacamole.  \n\nAside from the dishes we ordered, we were also given chips on the side and there's a complimentary condiment station across from the cashier. The service was great. As first time comers, we didnt know whether if we should wait for the food at the cashier as it seemed like a fast food place, but the lady told us to sit down and later brought the food to us.", "author": "'Cindy V."}

I keep telling myself I need to stop loading up on chips and tortillas and cheese and rice and beans and chorizo, and yet, somehow, I keep finding myself back here, doing that same thing. It's all I could do to stop drinking the horchatas every day. The food is always decent, occasionally I get lucky and it's great, but it's never, ever bad. They make quesadilla suizas the good way... stuffed full. All the meats are decent enough. The service is pretty quick most of the time, even when it's busy. And it's open when I'm hungry, which is unusual. Not the sort of joint you'd ever think to rave about, I wouldn't call myself a \"fan\", and yet, I just keep coming back, frequently.

It's a local taqueria targeted for a very specific crowd. It's nice to witness a taste of Mexico without all the hipster culture typically surrounding Mexican food. And in that regard, El Rancho Grande is one the best I've seen. But nothing is all good, and in this case it was the overpriced food, stale chips, and bland salsas that really brought down the experience. The fish tacos were great, but seemed like a rip-off to me. The mushroom quesadilla was also pretty good, but pretty greasy with partly-melted cheese in some places (that one really bothered me).

What am I saying?! That Mission-style's long-gone, replaced by couture shops and sterilized, sex-with-a-condom type burritos (hello Little Chihuahua); there is no more funk to the Mission. \n\nBut my brokenhearted, nostalgic mind digress's. This place is the real deal. Hella TV's blaring Spanish language sports. Beaming fluorescent lights beaming down on the floors still smelling of Pine-Sol. Salsa bar WITH radishes. Most importantly, you can get an excellent burrito for less than $10. Home sweet home.\n\nMy only note of skepticism is they have an EXTENSIVE menu for a taqueria sporting caesar salads, philly cheese steaks and hamburgers. Dubious but when it comes to the taqueria-fare, they'll keep it real. \n\nI've had nachos, burritos and tacos with al pastor, carne asada, cabeza and carnitas and all of them have been good--EXCEPT for the carnitas. I've had three different things with carnitas and they were all disappointing. Most places don't do carnitas well but theirs is particularly dry and bland.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-08", "description": "This brand new taqueria opened up in the Western Addition with very little hoopla about two weeks ago.  I'd been working on a volunteer project in that area recently and passed by on several occasions.  On Saturday afternoon on my way to the volunteer site I decided to hit up on nearby Green Chile Kitchen, but the place was packed and there was a line of people at the door.  That's when I remembered about the new place which is less than three blocks away.\n\nEl Rancho Grande was fairly empty at the time.  Two parties were eating inside and another three customers were waiting for takeout orders.  This restaurant has a huge menu that is mounted on a wall behind the order counter.  I had to study it for a bit before I got in line to place my order.\n\nI decided to go with an enchilada plate with carnitas.  Rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo are included on the plate.  There were no choice in beans which was a slight disappointment because as many of you know I only eat whole black beans.  I ordered a fish taco also and a bottle of Jarritos even though the agua frescas looked very good.  The friendly lady behind the counter asked if I wanted chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=-FA-_2AKcGXCjQi-EMtVjg) and I accepted.  There is a complimentary salsa bar with containers of pico de gallo, a tomatillo salsa, a red salsa and whole pickled peppers on ice.  Once I paid my check the lady asked me to take a seat and said she would bring me my order.\n\nThat she did beginning with the big Enchiladas Plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=qNKMVxkPe_WxiN5mJscsnA).  Everything on the plate was nice and fresh and the enchiladas had quite a bit of carnitas inside including some fairly large pieces (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=Yg3PAheoQ2Z9G04ntjA3PA).  The carnitas were very good.  The pork was very lean, moist and tender and the edges were nice and crispy like many of us enjoy in fried pork.  Don't ask me how the refried beans were because I didn't eat them, but I did eat everything else on the plate.\n\nThe Fish Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=-v1qpO_oKE6pGzx-TGde-A) was unlike any fish taco I've had before.  On two mini soft corn tortillas were several big pieces of grilled white fish (possibly tilapia), some chopped white onions, a mound of cilantro and a somewhat spicy brown sauce that had tomatillos in it.  The fish itself was excellent, and I loved all of the fresh cilantro and the sauce, but as good as it was I think I still prefer Baja style fish tacos.\n\nAnother reviewer had posted a nice shot of the wall menu in the photos section, but I decided to add images of the scanned take-out menu anyway since the restaurant doesn't have a website yet.  For Soups, Salads, Tortas, Tacos, Burritos and Quesadillas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=A-ugSGp99hwDc-rer25FpA), for Types of Meats, Nachos, Breakfast Plates, Special Plates, Sandwiches and Burgers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=vkGK-QVB6D4PrKibNxcbSQ), and finally for Side Orders, Extras, Agua Frescas, Juices and Beverages (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VKPA24jl5g19ESyA9tN8Vw?select=Cj14DkQOkN_hDqGuxZsvZw).\n\nI wish them well, and I'm certain I'll be back when I'm in the area again.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Wrong!    \n\nSomething was wrong from the beginning as I looked on how they were preparing the asada meat for the California burrito. I couldn't help notice the color and texture of the meat. It was different from any other times I've eaten at a Mexican food restaurants. (And yes I am a Burrito Snob, I have Burrito credentials lol) the meat looked odd and mushy. \n\nI asked cashier if I could have some salsa to go she point toward the cold counter covered with thick plastic grey covers. I asked the cashier if I could have a spoon she said to use the little plastic cups as a spoon. Huh? okay.(Moot point)\n\nWith the first bite I knew something with different with the burrito and it was the Meat! My burrito palate and nose was not liking it. However the hot sauce I was digging (one Star) and gave me a hint of maybe were the owners style of cooking is from. The salsa is very Yucatan.\n\nAfter awhile I started to feel nauseous and it was the meat that did it. \n\nI don't blame restaurant for my experience however I blame myself for coming here by trusting a few Yelps who probably don't know what good Cali-Mex food is. \n\nI have to remember in SF there is a huge job hiring in the tech industry which is creating a population boom in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-07", "description": "Although I'm not much of a carnivore, every now and then I feel a certain craving for the noblest cut of the cow--the tongue. Back when I was in Japan I found out that the most delicious and the only way to cook this oft-overlooked part of the cow is to peel off the thick hide from the tongue thus revealing the soft juicy meat under it, perhaps season it with a little salt and then grill the gorgeous thin cuts of meat over a charcoal fire. I was very disappointed to find that the tongue never made it as a staple cut in the American beef diet, but my disappointment was set aback when I found out that the pan-Americans and the magical restaurants that have so become ubiquitous to American cities known as \"Taquerias\" usually carry my preferred cut of beef as part of their delicious burrito menu. This all changed tonight when I visited El Rancho Grande.\n\nFueled partially by an initiative to explore my immediate surroundings a little thoroughly and partially by a drunken escapade, I decided to try out the taqueria that's exactly two and a half blocks away from where I live. My first impressions of the establishment was no different from any other Taquerias I've visited all around California; little cashier's booth under neath a giant menu conveniently located aside the actual \"cooking area\", seats lined up across the wall with a TV playing Mexican soaps/futbol on telemundo. So assuring myself that this experience would not be any different from my usual frequentings, I decided to order my favorite cut of beef wrapped around a tortilla stuffed with rice, beans, sour cream, diced tomatoes and onion and guacamole. How can you possibly mess this up, right?\n\nWell that's where I was wrong. I'm not a burrito scientist, but the first sign of a poorly made burrito can be observed through the color of the tortilla; the tortilla was toasted/browned--to date I've never had a single positive experience with burritos when the tortilla was (nearly) burnt to a crisp. My next grievance with ERG's burrito is that the queso they used overpowered almost every flavor the burrito had to offer--if I wanted a cheesy filling Mexican dish wrapped in a tortilla I would have ordered a quesadilla. \n\nMy last and final grievance with RG's lengua burrito is that it managed to capture every reason why white people don't usually eat this cut of meat; they somehow managed to overboil the lengua and thus leaving it devoid of any sort of flavor/texture whatsoever. Now I'm very passionate about my beef tongue so perhaps it's not in anyone's best interest to take what I say about this burrito au pied de la lettre, but this burrito managed to betray every expectation about the noblest cut of the beef: whereas I expected a succulent, juicy, flavorful sensation with each bite, all I got was a mushy, watery concoction that was overpowered by the overly generous flavor of cheese.\n\nBesides from the disappointing lengua burrito, the chips they gave me were the super greasy home-fried kind, which I imagine might be a plus for some and a huge gaping minus for others including myself, and their pathetic excuse for a salsa bar only had four choices: salsa verde, not-so-spicy red salsa, pico de gallo and another thing that I cannot remember at this point.\n\nDespite all their shortcomings, their food is surprisingly affordable (6.95 for a super burrito) which, in my opinion, is the only thing preventing me from giving this place a one star review. Since I was a little intoxicated when I tried this place and out of the virtue that this place is only 2.5 blocks away from where I live, I'll give this place another try on my next drunken escapade, but I know when I've been thoroughly disappointed and betrayed and this experience came mighty close to it.", "author": "Scott S."}

Sometimes you have to discover it by customizing, sometimes you discover it by accident.  This place is your typical taco shop, being mexican i can't order anything straight from their menu and be happy with the obscene amounts of cheese, sour cream and \"pico de gallo\" in their burritos.  So, here's what you need to order, any of the burritos but ask for refried beans and guacamole only, no cheese, no sour cream, and no rice.  Think about it, growing up poor we didn't have money for cheese or sour cream, and rice was often reserved for special occasions.  In other words, if you'd like to eat what the common folk in Mexico eat, which is effing delicious stick to the fewest ingredients possible, you can thank me later.", "author": "Roberto Z."}

Pretty large TV in the corner that should usually have on some type of soccer.\n\nI ordered the regular pollo asado burrito, good size, good taste. Meat was done quite well, not too much rice. Definitely better than Gordos or Pancho's on Geary.\n\nRegular burrito was decent price at 6.80 including tax. Tacos are not super cheap at $2.50 ea especially since I usually get $1.50 tacos down the Peninsula by my work but still a good deal. A plus is that they are open until 2 on Fri and Sat and 12 every other night.\n\nAll in all I would eat here again tomorrow.", "author": "Andrew C."}

The fat girl at the register has a bad attitude and messed up my wife's order then gave her a hard time about it. The California burrito I had today was the worst one I've ever had. The tortilla was burned and stale. The meat was full of gristle and I had to spit out chunks of meat I couldn't chew constantly.

The food was better than 'meh, but pretty much 'meh.\n\nAfter weeks of waiting the place opened and so we had to give it a try.  Wanting to try a lot of different things my husband and I ordered this stuff to go:\n\nSuper Carna Asada Taco\nChicken Tostada\nFish Taco\nChicken Flautes\nSuper Steak Quesadilla\n\nThe steak taco was a sloppy mess in a box.  I had to eat 2/3 of it in order to pick up the corn tortillas and bite into it.  The flavor was delicious.  I'm thinking steak burrito would be much better.\n\nThe tostada was again, a sloppy mess to the point I had no idea what it was.  And the shell was not crispy, and had  probably never actually been fried..seemed like a corn tortilla just layed down and layered with slop...tasty slop.  I did have one of those unfortunate bites of chicken that seemed to be bone, grizzle, muscle, or something tough.  I poked around for about four bites then straight up gave up.  I won't recommend any of it.\n\nThe fish taco was not bad, but after two bites I found myself wondering if my dog might like a taste of the fish.  Not a good sign.  \n\nMy husband thought the flautas were excellent.  My only warning is that they are smothered.  So if you get them to go, either plan to eat them quickly or ask for the guacamole, pico, and sour cream to be on the side.\n\nHis review of the super steak quesadilla is \"It was pretty good.\"  \n\nThe flavor is there.  I think, because everything seemed so sloppy, this place will be best for burritos and hopefully enchiladas.  (fingers crossed)", "author": "Jessica B."}

That part ended up in the trash. Maybe a fork would be wise next time! It was super good though, and huge...if I was given more foil it could've been used as a second meal.

Aside from the carnitas being highly over-seasoned, fatty and lukewarm, my first bite was complimented by a giant bone shard. The rice was drier than a (or rather, the) bone, the salsa tasted old and sickly sweet (why!?),  and the guacamole was worse than that Guacamole Dip you buy at the store that's really just green sour cream. To top the whole thing off, the tortilla had so much shortening in it, I could see straight through it. Really, I could have used it as plastic wrap. What a miserable experience.

Not because it is the BEST Mexican food ever but because it is close and authentic. A few people refer to Little Chihuahua and Green Chile Kitchen as better. Sorry - those are not even in the same category. This is a TAQUERIA - NOT a schmancy SF gourmet mex knock off. Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places but they are NOT the same thing. This place has good, fairly priced, authentic taqueria food. As someone who was born and raised in the Bay Area I have been going to all sorts of Mexican food forever and this place is good enough for the location.\n\nBottom line - if you are thinking of driving across SF to come here you are better served going to Pancho Villa or somewhere else in the Mission. HOWEVER - if you are leaving the Independent or romping around Divisadero it is the best/most authentic around and is open SUPER late-night(dude even passed me some tacos out the back door one night when they were closed). \n\nI tend to get the Al Pastor taco/burritto.

I did really like the chips - a little different than the super light one you find most often.  They were small, crispy and salty - really enjoyed them.  The salsa bar was a bit of a disappointment.  Only two options and a pico de gallo.  Neither was especially unique or flavorful and no spicy option.  I also happened to arrive at a time of day where I was scraping the bottom of the salsa dishes while one of the staffers carefully restocked the ketchup packages. (Yes, they serve cheeseburgers and some other non-mexican dishes - I believe in doing one thing and doing it well, but just my opinion.)  The meat quality was average at best - got a couple bad cuts of chicken I had to spit out.  If I go back, I'll definitely go veggie.\n\nIn all, it was good.  If Little Chihuahua weren't just a few blocks away, El Rancho Grande would easily satisfy my mexican craving.  But Little Chihuahua has an amazing salsa bar, the highest quality meats I've found in SF (steak - phenomenal!) and yummy chips they always serve warm.  \n\nThat said, it was a good burrito and I recommend giving it a try and forming your own opinion on the place.", "author": "gretchen d."}

My guess is that they had refrigerated the burrito and heated it up once I ordered it.  The burrito was little more than a tortilla stuffed with cold mush and some half-frozen vegetables.
