The bar was crowded as many others had the same idea. The back outdoor area was open and had a makeshift bar, which served only beer and hard liquor for cash only. The drinks were cheap as beers were $4 and I had a half full cup of Jameson for only $8.\n\nWe eventually made our way inside the bar for some mixed drinks. A Jameson and Gingerale was only $8 as well. While drinks were cheap and bartenders were friendly, the place was like any regular neighborhood bar. My biggest disappointment here was the jukebox they had. My friend had put in $2 to request 3 songs, which never came on after waiting for over an hour. I even complained to the bartender who said the songs don't have an order. A guy nearby overheard me and showed me the list of songs on an app, which I noticed our song picks coming up. With hopes, we waited a few more songs yet it still never came on. We eventually gave up, finished our drinks, and just went home. What a waste!", "author": "Cindy Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-01", "description": "Everything about this pub says it's a solid, inoffensive, neighborhood sports bar where you can have a beer with some buddies on a Sunday afternoon. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and want to grab casual drinks it's a decent choice, but there is really no reason to seek it out, unless you just need a bar with an outdoor area (a small back patio with a canopy and high-top barrel tables).\n\nIf the service were comparably decent, I would have no problem giving this place 3 stars, but the bartender's attitude definitely downgraded the experience for me. As soon as I tried to order, the bartender's tone was blunt and impatient. It took her at least five minutes to pour me one Guinness (all the while I'm standing patiently at the bar), even taking and serving other patrons' orders before mine (it was not busy either, maybe 5 other people at the bar). \n\nNormally all this would be slightly annoying but unmemorable. Service is pretty low on the totem pole of what I care about in a bar experience. However, when my friend tried to order and realized he forgot his ID, the bartender, in an aggravated tone, basically told him he had to get out. Now, I fully understand that the liquor business is heavily regulated and a bar has every reason to play by the rules. However, the bartender made absolutely no effort to be service-oriented or gracious about it. After my friend (who looks pretty clearly of age) offered to show a picture of his passport or ID, her response was, essentially, \"I don't care, get out of here.\"\n\nAgain, I have no issue with a bar requiring all their patrons to have ID. That's the law. But when you see a group of respectful people trying to have a good time at your bar, you don't just tell them they have to get out, in a blunt tone as if we're trespassers. The least you can do is say, \"sorry, but that's our policy, we don't want to get in trouble.\" I don't necessarily want to play this card, but we were also the only group of non-white people in the place.\n\nI will say that the place is fairly clean and looks inviting. There's a shuffleboard table in the back and I saw one table of people in an intense game of Magic the Gathering. I like chill neighborhood bars where people can lounge and play games, so if that's all you're looking for then by all means give it a try. Just don't forget your ID.", "author": "Terry L."}

I've been going here for years and it just gets better and better.\n\nNow, I'll be the first to admit that I have a certain bias towards Blarney's. It was the first bar I went to after turning 21 (almost 3 years ago) and years later I'm as much of a regular as it gets. All the bartenders know my name and so do most of the other regulars that go there. But, even before I did get to that point, I always loved everything about this bar. It's located in my favorite district in San Francisco, The Richmond. Now, to many people, they look for bars that are trendy, hipster and filled with a bunch of people. That's not my style. This place is nothing close to hipster and the only time it gets truly packed is during big sporting events- but that's what I love about it. It's the perfect place to go for a Sunday brunch, or for a late night drink to chat with the bartenders, or if you want to watch the latest playoff game. It's a versatile bar.\n\nThe staff...they are incredible people. All very friendly, down for a conversation and skilled at making drinks. Prices here are very reasonable. Happy hour usually goes a bit afternoon until 7pm and most drinks are $5. Pretty great deal. This place is also amazing for sporting events. Though it's usually not too packed on most days, it get's totally stuffed if a big game is happening. Always a fun time! It will get loud and even claustrophobic at times, so this is more of a recommendation for people who enjoy that type of environment.\n\nObviously, this place is not for everyone, but I can confidently say it's the best bar in the Richmond District. The bartenders are nothing short of amazing, the drinks are cheap yet good and if you ever become a regular, you'll never run out of stories to tell to the awesome people that go to this bar.", "author": "Alex B."}

Maybe it was that one time at elementary school when we slugged a ball out of the sandlot. Or that time when we rushed for a 40 yard return at the homecoming game. It was a time when the dream was most vivid and the hope least far-fetched.\n\nBut we got older and dreams gave way to reality. Our locker room became a cubicle and the lucky pair of dirty cleats are now a sparkling pair of dress shoes. The X's and O's? Spreadsheets now. The congratulatory slaps on the behind? Cordial handshakes. Then one day, we realize we are no longer an athlete. Just another guy at Blarney Stone, looking up at ESPN with a $5 pint.  \n\nBut our passion for the game remains resilient. Buried beneath a man faced with reality, it is ever ready to be unearthed by a timely play. \n\nThe passion begins to surface as the Giants field a perfect 6-4-3 double play. We adjust our baseball cap proudly and order another pint.\n\nIt inches even further out when a certain quarterback throws yet another interception. We furiously lament our hopes of the Lombardi to the nearest Niners jersey, but find our hopes clinging back on to the television screen by the very next play.\n\nAnd on rare occasions, when the play is so spectacular, the passion fully emerges. We slap high fives as hard as we can around the bar through shouts and cheers. Three to our left, and five to our right. One for the fan across the counter who just so happens to be the bartender that night. The adrenaline rushes through our veins and feeds our passion with euphoria. And for just a moment, we feel like the slugger back in the sandlot, the star receiver back in homecoming.\n\nNo, we may never be professional athletes, but we will be the next best thing.

Blarney Stone has provided me with a place to go drink and chill for many years now. They get busy during games, but there's a lot of seating and an outdoor area, so not too hard to grab a spot.\n\nUsually my pal Jeremy P and I will grab a burrito at Gordo's down the block and bring it in. You can do this with whatever food you like, which is nice. I think B Stone just started serving food, which is why I give only 3 stars. The food is HIGHLY mediocre. But I guess if you don't know that a place serves food, there's probably a reason for that.\n\nI was on the struggle bus (but what's new) and ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich ($11) with a side of Tater Tots. I expected fresh fried chicken, though thinking about it now, I'm not sure why given it's bar food, but got an *obviously* pre frozen, breaded hockey puck with wilted lettuce and an old slice of red onion. Truly a sad excuse for a chicken sando. The only redeeming quality of the meal were the tots: crispy, crunchy, freshly hot out of the fryer. \n\nMy friend Mike had the Chicken Tenders ($9) and they were just awful. Salty to the max, drenched in some kind of salty \"buffalo sauce\". Someone in the kitchen really used a heavy hand, this stuff was puddling in thick pools around the plate. They were also extremely tough to bite, as he offered me one and I nawed for a while. With a side of soggy fries, this dish was no bueno.\n\nBut I digress as The Bloody Mary and all the beers on tap make B Stone a great place to hang your hat for a while. Just maybe save your appetite for a Sheppard's Pie from next door, pho for Turtle Tower down the street, or any other local restaurant.

They have a decent though not extensive selection - the core holdings you find in most bars and a couple higher end selections.  But the list is nothing to write home to father about.  In the whiskey department they have 3 Irish, and handful of scotch, and a handful of American (mostly bourbon).  The list has them all listed together with no differentiation between them.  Also, the first two bourbons I asked for, they were out.  Similar selection of other spirits - decent but light on the higher quality gins, vodka, etc.\n\nClientele\nThe crowd both times was an interesting mix of older (drunk) locals at the bar, young (drunk) partiers towards the back, couples canoodeling in the corner, and a few lonely hearts spread around.  I have had a few interesting conversations there, in the interesting way of having a debate with someone much younger and drunker can only go.  It was entertaining at least.\n\nD\u00e9cor\nI would describe this as a poor imitation of an Irish pub crossed with a sports bar.  Lots of wood - bar, floor, tables, walls.  It's basically a standard large \"Neighborhood\" bar/pub.  Plenty of TV's to watch the current sporting event, and TV's are usually turned to sports.  My only complaint in this regards is that the TV's mounted above the bar are too high to watch comfortably while sitting at the bar.  Since the bar is not that deep and the TV's are pretty high, the viewing angle is pretty steep - leading t a sore neck\n\nAlso, it seems that the younger set thinks that \"dive bars\" are cool and therefore calls most any local place that is older and not high end a \"dive\" bar.  This is not a dive bar.  Believe me, I have been a many a dive bar, and you can look up the common definitions of a dive bar - this is not one.  It is way too well lit, has way too many TVs, etc, etc.\n\nCleanliness\nThe place is kept reasonably clean and the bathrooms were not too bad.  But I will say that both visits were earlier in the evening - 7:00 to 9:30 range.  I would wager that by the time midnight rolls around, the back patio and the bathrooms will start to get fairly rank and you may catch an occasional whiff of the love smell of urine or puke.\n\nParking\nBest to walk because:\n1. Parking can be a bitch in this area\n2. You are drinking\n\nSo, three stars it is.  I enjoyed it there and will likely be back on occasion, but there are (IMHO) better places to go.", "author": "Jeff H."}

But it is a fun Irish pub to go to on a weekday night, play some shuffleboard with friends, have decently priced drinks (fresh-squeezed grapefruit and vodka is $5-ish), and meet some unpretentious people of varied ages. \n\nI've come here on a Sunday morning to watch football and have brunch, and the food is pretty great (first time trying fried pickles, an amazing would-be heart attack) with $7 mimosas.

I'm not sure how we managed to snag a table, but we did and we were happy to have a good view of several TVs.\n\nIf I were just rating this place on the service or its value as a place to watch sports, I would give it 5 stars. But, alas, I was starving after soccer practice and needed to eat while I watched the Niners eek out a painful win, and the food was just not good. \n\nTwo things were good, in my opinion: the burger and the tater tots. Unfortunately, my so-called \"friends\" ordered me french fries instead of tater tots while I was in the bathroom (come on, guys. Really? French fries over tater tots? What is this? Communist Russia?). The fries were terrible, lukewarm, and just not my kind of potato (which is saying a lot). \n\nMy boyfriend got the chicken tenders and they were god awful. First of all, they were soaked in buffalo sauce...ummm...did we order chicken tenders or the world's largest boneless buffalo wings? (Who even wants regular sized boneless wings?) That part wouldn't have been so bad if the buffalo sauce was actually good but it was so salty, I wouldn't have been surprised if that sauce recipe called for equal parts salt and buffalo jizz. Just gross. And the chicken sandwich was also gross. Just a poorly heated piece of freezer meat.\n\nSoooo...just go to Blarney Stone for the beer and the sports and you'll be fine.

HUH? \nYou read correctly or may be completely hungover from last night, but yes, in honor of this Mexican Holiday, my friends and I hit up the Blarney. \nTrust me, we were in the Avenues, and Tommy's Mexican Restaurant and Tia Margarita's were our \"Go-To\" places for tequila y cervezas, but it wasn't meant to be. Crazy crowds inside and outside of both Mexican restaurants, and we weren't willing to wait a gazillion minutes for a table. \n*So, what's this Pinay Paddy and her friends to do? Go with Plan C - Blarney Stone! Our hearts were definitely in the right place, but we opted for no margaritas at this Irish bar, and instead settled for the brewskies. \n\nAnywho, when I used to live in the 'hood,' I'd frequent this place, and always solid good fun! I love the chill and relaxed vibe, and the patio area out in the back. Crowd can be a mix of locals, students, and even a few tourists. Decent selection of draft and bottled beers and lots of hard alcohol for your drinking pleasure. There is a jukebox and various tvs for your futbol or other sport watching, and oh BTW trivia is held on Tuesday nights. I also think there is karaoke night, but can't recall which day. No unisex bathrooms here (thank goodness), but one drunken evening, I walked into the Men's room by accident. Oopsies! When I realized where I was, I exited immediately to enter the ladies room, hoping no one saw. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. My friends got a good laugh at my expense. Whateves! :) \n\nAs you may (or not) recall, a few months back, I yelped all Irish establishments in honor of St. Paddy's Day. I inadvertently missed yelping Blarney.

Then the RHG told me he's not that into trivia, so my little trivia balloon deflated.  No matter, as we managed to talk about a plethora of subjects while partaking in two of the many beers that were on tap (in case you're taking notes, it was Widmer for me- from my brief stint living in Oregon, and Sam Adams Octoberfest for him- I could only imagine was to toast our mutual Boston connection).  \n\nSuffice it to say, this is yet another Irish bar that I like.  It was virtually empty when we came here, and I don't know how I'd feel if it was packed (less opportunity to use the candle wax in ways other than to hold up a wick), but I definitely dug the vibe.  They have an excellent selection of liquor, and had I not been trying to impress RHG with my beer knowledge, I would have liked to get an irish coffee.  Perhaps next time.  \n\nAlthough we moved on to bigger and better things that evening, I will look back on the Blarney Stone fondly, although I'm going to have to take away a couple of stars....\n\n1 for the occasional wafts of vomit odor- this may make it an authentic Irish pub, but it's not that pleasant\n\n1 for them not taking credit cards- this may also make it authentic, but I try to deposit all those ones I get from my other other job as soon as possible.

He did bill exactly what we each asked for and since I did share quite a bit of whiskey with the \"boyee in da middle\" we put our totals together and split it evenly.\n\nI wished there were a few more Irish whiskey selections, but I suppose I've been a bit spoilt by the Black Rose Irish pub back home. I stuck with drinking the Tullamore Dew happily. But there were the other usuals like Powers Gold, Bushmills, and Michael Collins. I missed my favorite Red Breast though.\n\nIt does seem all the Irish bars we frequented over the day are cash only, and this one was no exception.

Doey (I know I'm spelling this wrong), Bart, and Nate. There are more, but these are they guys I see and I love 'em. Super friendly, while still being real. (Sidenote: People, ALWAYS be nice to your bartenders and servers. They are people, they are your servers, not your servants, and they yield way more power than you bother to acknowledge!)\n\nThe Atmosphere: For me, it's the perfect balance. Neighborhood vibe, comfortable and non-pretentious, but clean and not dive-y. (Don't get me wrong, I love a good dive bar, but I'm just clarifying.) I can come here with friends, alone for a chill beer, watch the games (lots of T.V.s and one is a HUGE screen!). There's free shuffleboard and air hockey, a jukebox (although I feel the volume on this can be too loud) and a back patio with great atmosphere. My only wish is that they had a kitchen, but I get why they don't, and I don't care because what they do, they do well. There are still plenty of food options to get for take-out, too.\n\nThe Crowd: I've seen a little of everyone in here. Barely legals to gray-haired regulars. I love that there seems to be a lot of neighborhood folk, who the guys behind the bar know by name. It's been pretty non-douche-y every time which has me breathing a sigh of relief. Even if there are a few, they tend to stay together in a little douche-y cluster. Any drunk regulars are harmless. \n\nOn a personal note: I love that this place is two blocks from my house in a safe neighborhood. I love that Doey promised my cousin that he would watch out for me when I stayed behind one night. That's good people. I love that I've actually made friends out of strangers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-02", "description": "Okay people, let's get some definitions down--just because a bar is old and not trendy, this does not make it a \"dive bar.\"  As a matter of fact, I have consulted with the experts, Mr. Guinness, Ms. Greyhound, and the Kamikaze and they have all confirmed that you can't really be both a sports bar and a dive bar.  It's in the regulations.  Check'em out www.divebarregs.bs. \n\nThis is not a dive bar.  It is called \"The Blarney Stone,\" and it means it only in a mildly ironic way. Now if it were called the \"Blarney Stud\"--then maybe it could be a gay dive bar.  \n\nOkay, now that I've vented I can get back to the review.  This is your fairly typical, neighborhood Irish pub. It's got TV's and plays local sports, so it could double as sports bar.  It has a trivia night which is yet another sign that it is not a dive bar.  The only trivia nights that dive bars...\n\nOkay, okay, back on my meds.  We've established that it's an Irish pub.\n\nNow even though it is fairly run of the mill, it is light years better than Hooky Hell (my new name for Hockey Haven) just a few blocks to the west.  Blarney has okay atmosphere.  Good lighting.  Nice wooden d\u00e9cor and Guinness served the right way--to me.\n\nNow I would never leave the city to come here, but if you happen to be in the Richmond District it is one of three fairly similar bars within a few blocks.  You don't really feel like you are in the city here, which is both good and bad.  Bad because the crowd is maybe a little too low key and cliquey.  Good because you can get away from the pretentiousness of the city and just have fun with your friends.  This is not really a pick up spot, I don't think.\n\nI wouldn't mind hanging out here every so often.\n\nOh yeah and here's a tip for the gals--there's a secret way to get the bartenders attention here. It's called flirting with them.  They will keep an eye out for you and refill your drinks when you're out.  Oh yeah, and they're hot too...(see how well it works).", "author": "Nikki K."}

And I got sprayed! \n\nAnd 4 stars because of the following analysis on new leadership and direction:\n\nThe Blarney Stone has been the local spot for years now, I've always gone in when I had the chance to grab a bite (ha! the portions are huge, there will be no nibbling here!) of brunch on the weekends. Though they do not have the same rush of people frequenting, as they used to, when I first moved here, they still have an amazing Irish breakfast/brunch. Get the Ulster, it's amazing. \n\nI've read the reviews, and yes, Bart seems to have a hard shell, but at least he's real. He doesn't just cozy up to anyone who throws a dollar down, and I appreciate that.\n\nThat goes for that new Indian chick too, who seemed to be handling the brunch and the bar! Woo, that girl can move! (I think her name is Rasha.. She's cute.) The're both efficient and courteous and seem to handle the drunks well. They ask you the basics any bartender will ask.. and will talk with you if you have something interesting to say (not as though you need to bring up the Zeitgeist conspiracy or anything. But I think they figure if you want to talk you will talk.) \n\nThe atmosphere is different, not bad, just different. They have not really found their own new identity yet, seemingly riding off the old one. It's like an old friend who has undergone a drastic life changing event, and they themselves, in turn, have changed.. But it's still your old friend the Blarney.\n\n\nStay tuned for my next review!", "author": "Rascal F."}

At that point we decided to saunter back to the beach through Golden Gate Park (it was quite a long walk) and as we were heading to Golden Gate Park we spotted the Blarney Stone. Of course we stopped for a pint mid afternoon because it was a warm day, it was a Saturday and it didn't seem too unacceptable to drink at 3 in the afternoon.\n\nThe interior is well lit and the bartenders are friendly. Everyone seems to have an Irish accent (bartenders and patrons) and they had Smithwicks on tap (my absolute favorite Irish beer though it will never compare to the stuff you get in the UK). They had a nice selection of ales and an even better selection of Irish whiskeys. They even had a few shitty domestic beers all relegated to the corner like a bastard child--obviously neglected but necessary in this country and our expectations. \n\nIt seems like the sort of place that would be fun in the evenings with live music, quiz night and darts. We sat for about half an hour with a pints and we chatted, listened to other conversations and watched the bartender pull an expert pint of Guinness. I'm impressed.\n\nAlso impressed that the bathrooms are surprisingly clean for pub restrooms, but we'll see how clean they are if I'm back in the evening.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

We were lucky enough to snag a table here for Giants/Rangers World Series Game 4.  \n\nUnlike a lot of bars in the city, The Blarney Stone is square shaped, not long and narrow, so they can fit a nice amount of tables in their main area.  Plus, the ceiling is very high, and they have a nice big movie screen hanging from the ceiling on which they project the game.  Add in a few flat panel TVs along the bar, and you find yourself with multiple angles from which to watch the action.\n\nThe place was filled to the brim the night we were there, with everyone cheering on the Giants.  They had happy hour prices going on during the game, plus a burger/hot dog menu to keep our bellies full.  The Blarney Stone definitely took advantage of the World Series opportunity, and made for a fantastic venue to watch the game.  Thanks guys!", "author": "Tim N."}

It's not a classic facade whose extent of Gaelic culture is a shamrock over the door and a barmaid with an accent.  No indeed...I've come by the Blarney Stone half-a-dozen times, and each time my ability to join a conversation has been utterly neutered by my inability to understand some of the most incomprehensibly thick brogues I've ever heard.  The crowd is very Irish...and very local too.\r\n\r\nThe authenticity doesn't stop there either....a SETANA-like sports channel seems to grace the best-positioned television, while numerous types of athletic jerseys (I'm guessing soccer) hang behind the bar.  A largely wood interior with tasteful decoration contributes to a musty but pleasant vibe, and a lovely outdoor patio sits beyond double glass doors in the back.   The patrons tend to be friendly amongst those of their own ilk, but they seem wary of strangers; During my drop-ins at the Blarney Stone, I've gone 1-for-6 in striking up conversation.  It's overall feel is somewhat like Durty Nelly's on Irving, but the crowd reminds me of the somewhat quieter lot at the Sam McGuire on Noriega.\r\n\r\nWell-moderated music and civilized patrons make this place a great retreat from the noisier spots along Geary and Clement.  If you're Irish, you'll no doubt find kindred souls, and if you live near 20th and Geary, It's worth it to break in as a regular.  But if you stop by as an outsider without a brogue, bring a date or come with a group.

He looked at me an said I dont have aniphone charger, I told him  my  story  and pointed to the wall and said its over there would u be able to do that for me please He look at me and said I dont charge phones and walked away. I stayed there staring at him I also work in the industry and I was in shock with the way he treated me, specially because all I wanted was to charge my phone for 2 min to see if my son was ok.

It's a no-frills bar, but the bartenders are friendly, and the 2-7 prices are cheap.

A creepy guy in his late 30s tried hitting on us and asking us about music, we pretty much ignored him, he played his U2 and we kept talking. later two severely drunk blondes, also about the same age, kept stumbling back to the bathroom. Its pretty sad when you are old enough to be a college student's mom, but you are still acting like one. \n\nThe drunker of the two females stumbled back and tried the bathroom door the third time and found that it was closed, so she went outside and puked over the balcony into some plants.

Authentic meaning that not only are the bartenders irish, but all the patrons were as well, accent and all.  I wonder if its like that all the time.  And when i say all, basically, my friend and i were the only non-irish in there.  And damn if everyone didnt seem like they were 7 feet tall.  My friend and i both felt incredibly tiny.  For the most part everyone was very friendly, minus the 2-3 jerk guys.  No joke, as im standing at the bar waiting to get a drink, this really tall guy starts talking to me.  I ignore him...i also couldnt understand a word he was saying his accent was so thick.  But i did understand, very clearly, when he leaned over to his friend and said something along the lines of \"aye, i could get a bj standing up no problem\".  I really could have gone without hearing that tidbit.  My friend looked at me, rolled her eyes, as did i, and we both walked away.  I have many friends that are irish, and I like the irish, but sometimes they really have no filter for their mouths.  \n\nOverall, its your typical bar.  Despite the asshole i came across, everyone else was friendly, including the guy at the door.  They also had live music playing and an outdoor patio.  If i was in the neighborhood, i may stop in for a couple drinks again.  \n\nOriginally, i had this at 3 stars, but i feel i need to bump Blarney up an extra star because i appreciate owners who take pride in their business and really care about their customers enjoying their time at the establishment.  Gerard, is a very kind man who likes to make sure everyone has a good time at his pub.  I have no doubt that he has many loyal regulars as well as new patrons, who im sure upon meeting him, will want to come back again.\n\nNote:  its a cash only bar so make sure to have some handy.", "author": "Juv C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-01", "description": "After dinner, the wife and I jumped on the Muni limo from the FiDi to the Outer Richmond for The Blarney Stone's NYE Party. I have to say, it was probably the 2nd best New Year's Eve party we've been to in SF, the best being the dearly departed Pat O' Shea's open bar extravaganza in 2003. The biggest reason we chose The Blarney Stone was, unlike most places in the City, they resisted the urge to make easy money by charging a cover, or even worse to make everyone buy overpriced pre-sale tickets for a \"party\" that included nothing more than a glass of $5-a-bottle champagne and a noise maker. It was just crowded enough to have a fun vibe, but not overly packed to the point where it takes an hour to get a pint of Guinness from the bar. We got there about 10:30 and were able to score seats, a special treat on New Year's Eve in the City. The bartenders did a fantastic job of serving patrons in the order they stepped up to the bar, no matter what tricks the drunken masses tried to get even more inebriated faster. The crowd was great, with none of the amatuer, Jersey Shore-ish shenanigans that we experienced on Polk St last NYE. We watched the Ball drop, had a few pints, and checked out before the wait for a taxi got too ridiculous (or the urge to head over to Video Cafe hit us).\n\nWe don't make it in to the Blarney as often as we like, since it's kinda out of the way, but it's a great little Irish pub. The bartenders are super friendly and always treat you like a regular, no matter how infrequently you drop in. The beer prices are pretty standard, $6 for a Guinness and $4 for a Bud Light. They also have a cool outdoor patio that's great for killing those lazy football-less Sundays in the Spring. One bonus is you can order food from John Campbell's Irish Bakery next door and the bartenders will bring it right to your barstool.\n\nOverall, The Blarney Stone is one of the better Irish pubs in San Francisco. A word to the debit card addicted like myself, The Blarney is cash only, but there is a Chase next door and a Wells right down the street.", "author": "Michael T."}
