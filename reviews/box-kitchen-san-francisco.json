I was debating a beer, but he never offered again. He spent most of his time at the other end of the bar and I wasn't eager enough to try to flag him down. The Tempest had a great selection of beer both on tap and in the bottle. \n\nI choose the fried green tomato sandwich and fries. The fries were just your basic fries, lightly salted with a good crisp. Nothing much to write about. I have pretty high standards for fried green tomatoes after spending most of my life living in Georgia. The fried green tomatoes on this sandwich did not disappoint! They were lightly battered and perfectly fried. Unfortunately, I found the peppers on the sandwich to be a distraction. They were too spicy for what I was looking for and the quantity of them overpowered everything else about the meal. After putting them aside, I was able to enjoy the sandwich. \n\nNext time I find myself in the city the Box Kitchen won't be my first stop, but I definitely would come back to try more on their menu.", "author": "Anne F."}

My runaway favorite was definitely the mac & cheese eggrolls. They were crispy on the outside and generously filled with decadent mac & cheese. The tomato sauce on the side was also the perfect accompaniment for this dish! My second favorite were the potato skins. I LOVED the sunny side up quail eggs on top! But all in all, what's not to like about potatoes, pork belly, and a runny egg? Bringing up the end were the garlic fries. They weren't bad by any means, but compared to the egg rolls and potato skins, they were just kind of average, you know?\n\nFor my main, I went with the honey grilled cheese sando. I loved the mix of gouda and manchengo which provided a delicious nuttiness that also went well with the thicker peasant bread. The tabasco honey was also delicious and I really liked that they drizzled extra honey on the sandwich too. You literally got bites of sweet, spicy, and ooey gooey melty cheese between bites.

I'll start by saying, the customer service we received was 100% terrible and uncalled for, so much so that we ended up walking away and most likely will never return to this establishment again.  Here's a summary of how our experience went:\n\nAs we were standing at the window to order, I noticed that the big chalk sign menu next to us had several items with a 'Sold Out' sign over them.  The 'Sold Out' sign was covering the entire menu item, blocking it completely from view. Since it was our first time here, I was curious to see what we missed out on so that we could get there early next time to order what most likely was a popular item.  Seeing that it was just a magnet, I pulled back the magnet to see what the menu item was and quickly returned it to its place.  Upon doing so, the lady behind the window aggressively began yelling at me and said \"um, could you not f*cking do that??\"...I was obviously startled and quickly apologized saying I was just curious to see what we had missed out on, so we could know what to come back for in the future.  She continued to say, \"it's f*cking sold out, so why the f*ck you need to look at it?\" and then told me to \"not f*cking touch it again\".  Maybe I was in the wrong or being too curious, but it certainly didn't warrant this lady responding in the way she did.  Especially as an employee at this establishment.  Needless to say, we stared at her in disbelief (along with everyone else waiting for their food) and walked away to take our business elsewhere.  I'm still in shock at how this establishment treats their customers definitely will not be recommending this place to anyone I know.", "author": "Laura K."}

I think I'd prefer the battered ball version over the roll.\n\nThe broccoli and potato croquettes were a bit of a heavy let down because they just seemed like a deep fried ball of softness but i was hoping there was going to be some sharpness or gooeness from cheese and maybe a kick of spice from cayene or paprika or something.

My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and thought it was below average - I tried a bite of his chicken and I definitely agree that it was below average: flavorless and bland.

It was just around the corner from the mall. \n\nI had the following:\n1) Fries - good. They season it with pepper and too much salt. A little less salt would be better.\n\n2) Brussels sprouts - okay. I make better brussel sprouts myself.  They taste as if they are just roasted with oil only. They could easily make the Brussels sprouts a hundred times better if they added some seasoning like rosemary or lemon. Also, they put too much oil. Some of them burst with oil when you bite into them or leave your mouth feeling really greasy. \n\n3) Mac and cheese egg rolls - okay.  I think they would be better without the roll.  Just plain mac and cheese would be better.  The fried dough around it didn't add much flavor.  Also, the sauce it comes with was pretty bland.  I ended up using TJ's sweet chili sauce on them instead which tasted much better.\n4) Buffalo chicken ranch sando - a little dry.  Definitely needed some ketchup or some sauce but otherwise it was good.  \n\n5) Box burger - AWESOME.  So good.  It was seasoned just right also.  I usually have to add ketchup to burgers for the moisture.  But this burger didn't need it.   I will definitely come back for this.\n\nIt's basically a hole in the wall. There's no seating so you get your food Togo or eat on the street. I think I saw some people bringing the food into the tempest next door. The place is in a sketchy alley with some sketchy people around it. I would prefer to drive there than walk. \n\nTL/DR: the box burger was amazing!  The fries, brussel sprouts, mac and cheese egg rolls and buffalo chicken ranch sando were okay. Driving there feels safer than walking in that alley.", "author": "Jon P."}

Surprised to see it was just a walk-up door/window/takeout stand. Guess they are owned or affiliated somehow to the Tempest bar next door. They have their menu written up in chalk on their door. It's actually quite a few options. I was craving fried chicken as it happened to be national fried chicken day when we went. So I got the chicken and waffles. The bf got fried chicken sando. And we also got the mac n cheese egg rolls and a side of fries to share. Food took a good 20 minutes or so to come out. We didn't want any drinks and we were too far from home and there's no place to sit so we actually walked back to the mall to enjoy our meal. It was so much food for two people. My chicken and waffles was tasty. The waffles seemed to be made out of like a wheat batter bur I liked it. It came with two pieces of chicken, boneless dark meat, which I liked. It could be slightly crispier but good nonetheless. I tried a bite of the chicken sandwich and I thought was ok. There was some spicy spread on it. The bf enjoyed it though. I also unfortunately did not like the fries and mac n cheese egg rolls that much. Fries were a little cold and hard and not super crispy when we got to eat them. Could've used a little salt too. I may get the garlic parmesan ones if I ever go back. The mac and cheese egg rolls is a cool concept. I think I was expecting it to be a little cheesier on the inside. And they must've used like a spicy cheese because it had a kick (and I don't really like spicy). Again my bf really like the egg rolls though. All this food for around $45 so not bad. So fried chicken and waffles is a thumbs up for me. And next time I'd like to try their burger and the garlic parmesan fries.", "author": "Alison W."}

It's a couple of blocks from the mall. This place is a little hidden because it's a hole in the wall next to a bar off of some smaller streets, but most likely you'd find a line of people at the window.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu. When looking them up on Yelp, you'll find mostly pictures of the Chicken and Waffles, and Box Burger. The order taker even mentioned the two when I asked what's the most popular. I was trying to avoid red meat because it was Friday (you probably can figure out why), so I wanted to check out the Chicken and Waffles, but they were unfortunately out. So I went for the Box Burger.\n\nIt didn't take too long to come out, probably what you would expect at a sit down restaurant. Because it's a window, there's no formal seats available, but they are partnered with the bar next door, so you're welcome to eat in there. Not sure if they ID all day, but just keep that in mind. We were there on a Friday night, so it was tough to grab a seat.\n\nThe burger was really good. Juicy patty, a good mix of condiments and toppings, all between two unique buns. I forget exactly the kind that they use, but it adds to the quality. My only gripe about it, is that it is a little pricey.\n\nThis is a nice little spot. Make sure you prepare around times of bar-goers if you want to enjoy a little bit more room at the seating area at the bar. The food is good, but it does come at a bit of a steep price, but I definitely want to come back and try more of the menu.", "author": "Robert O."}

When we got there, we discovered that it was a literal hole-in-the-wall with limited seating in the bustling bar (Tempest) next door. \n\nRating Breakdown:\n2/2 Stars for Taste --\nWe ordered a Box Burger and the potato skins to split. YO. Those potato skins though! Perfect, thin potato skins fried to a crisp and topped with thick chunks of pork belly and quail eggs. Everything fried. A true work of art. Topped with some lemon aioli. The Box Burger paled in comparison. Yes it was juicy, but it was merely GOOD. Those potato skins were LIFE CHANGING.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value -- \nIt's kind of pricey for the quantity you get. I think $10 for 3 potato skins and $11 for a burger -- typical by city standards but objectively not ideal. We weren't super hungry so splitting two orders was just fine, but I can see myself easily spending $15-20 here if I were looking to eat a real meal. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe guy taking the orders was very nice. After placing my order, he just told us to \"come back in 20 minutes\". They don't call your name or anything, you just have to wander back from the bar every 5 minutes or so and ask if your order is ready. Then you have to get carded again (I'm an Asian girl that will look 15 until the end of time.) when you go back to the bar -- it's a whole thing. Once you get your food, you have to secure a table in a packed bar where every few minutes you have to scootch your chair around so the people playing pool don't whack you in the face with their sticks. If you don't want to deal with the whole seating situation, you can always squat outside and eat in the abandoned sketch alley. Flickering street lamps provide the best mood lighting.\n\nNo bonus star because I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. \n\nTL;DR: Try the potato skins.

You order and pick up from this little window and there are only maybe ~12 items on the menu but I can't wait to try them all. \n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n1)Box burger: my favorite item. The patty is full of flavor and juiciness, the toppings and textures are very savory.I don't even remember what was in the burger because everything was so good. \n2) Brussel sprouts: wayy too much sauce. the brussel sprouts itself had great flavor and texture (soft baked(?) and not bitter) but that sauce was so salty I couldn't finish it :/ hate it when foods get lost in the sauce\n3) Garlic fries: flavor nation. it had cheese and garlic that's a winner. can be a little soggy\n4) Fried chicken banh mi: good concept, good sauce, but the fried chicken was a little dry and flavorless (very chicken tender-like) and the jalepenos were spicy. Well-toasted bread though", "author": "Lydia Z."}

I had the mac and cheese egg rolls which were a delight of textures with the outside being crunchy and the inside being perfectly creamy and smooth. The mac and cheese by itself would've been a hit but putting it in the egg roll shell was a real treat and also made it easy to share. There was a dipping sauce that came with it too but it shone on its own without it.\n\nThe staff is super friendly. They also accept credit cards so not to worry if you don't have cash.

The food was decent AKA good but stingy on the cheese (3/5), and the customer service was not great (2/5). At Box Kitchen, you order at a little window, then wait outside for ~10 min while they prep your food. You are also able to order food from Box at the Tempest bar, which is right next door. \n\nIn general, most entrees were in the $10-15 range, and there were some sides or appetizers for $6+. One thing that disappointed me a little bit, is that the menu online is more extensive than the actual menu at the restaurant, so the things I wanted were not available the day I went. I think they might rotate the menu day-by-day, so the selection on the day you go varies a bit.\n\nOur food was pretty reasonable. We ordered Honey Grilled Cheese Sando, the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets, Parmesan Garlic Fries, and a Coke. The grilled cheese was actually very tasty. I was a little wary of the honey being used instead of butter, but I really liked it. It added a nice sweet flavor. The one thing I didn't like about this sandwich was that it didn't have much cheese. It seemed like they only put cheese on 1/2 the sandwich. Then, the \"parmesan garlic fries\" (menu board said) were actually just garlic fries. I saw 2 shreds of parmesan at the bottom of the box, but that was it. The chicken nuggets were good. They came with some little veggies and buffalo sauce on top. You can also get them with honey mustard instead. Finally, we ordered a coke. When we were walking away, we realized the coke wasn't in our bag and went back to retrieve it. The cashier insisted that we had never ordered one and wouldn't give it to us. I am 10000% sure we did order one, so I thought that it was kind of a scam.", "author": "Kristin A."}

Once your order is up, they'll call your name through that same window. Just grab your food, and head right back on into Tempest.\n\nThen one time my friend was in the city, so we decided to go to Tempest for lunch.

Box Kitchen is a window alongside a building, located directly next to a bar.  LITERALLY A HOLE IN THE WALL!!!!  It's understandable why their name is \"Box Kitchen\" because the location consists of the window (box) and the kitchen behind that window.  Nonetheless, their food is BOMB'DIGGS!!!!\n\nBox Kitchen is located in a small alley-looking area.  It is open late which is ideal because I don't know about you but my friends and I are usually hungry after an event or concert hosted in SF.\n\nThey have a unique menu consisting of burgers, wings, fritters, tacos, elotes, fries, etc.  Keep in mind that the later in the day it gets, the smaller the menu gets because once they run out of certain ingredients for something, that's it for the day.  People rave about their burgers but I am here to talk about their elotes!  Their elotes don't come on a stick.  They come in a tray and you eat them with a fork so they are different from other restaurants/places, right off the bat.  The corn is cooked in their chipotle lime butter and elote spice, topped with their garlic aioli sauce, radishes, and queso fresco, and is garnished with cilantro.  I know this is isn't the traditional way of making elotes but man oh man is it a tasty way!  The corn is cooked perfectly.  The toppings are not too dense and don't overpower the flavor of the corn.\n\nI have come here a couple of times.  The quality and flavor of their food has remained consistent.  The workers are very welcoming and energetic.  Their food does take a few minutes BUT is worth the wait.  I think this place is worth a try the next time you're in the area.

I've tried the kale egg burger, chicken sando, potato skins, garlic fries, and Thai chicken wings. Everything is deliciously greasy and horribly unhealthy, but somehow you just can't bring yourself to care. \n\nMy vote is for the chicken sando and garlic fries; the garlic fries come in a huge box that you can slowly work through with a friend, and they are the perfect level of crisp - just don't try to breathe on anyone after. The chicken is crunchy and paired with a creamy sauce, and you have to be careful you don't finish it within a couple bites. The potato skins which come with cheese, pork belly, and quail egg are also so good, but they're accompanied by a good serving of guilt. \n\nI haven't tried some of the more daring things on the menu, but I don't think Box Kitchen ever gets things wrong. The wait can get a bit long, especially you stop by at 2am with a bunch of other drunchy fiends, but this little hidden stand in a sketch alleyway serves up some of the best late-night food out there.", "author": "Sophie W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "Let's get right down to business and discuss the food first:\n\nThe food is cooked to order and fresh ( your order won't be ready in 5 minutes and I don't mind waiting a little extra, as long as they cook it right). Fries are succulent, not soggy but not too crisp (must be a good potato choice), and the burger is nothing short of perfection. Zero complaints on food and service.\n\nWhat an incredible find! Just note that I rarely give out 5 star reviews. In my opinion for a 5-star review to surface I need to see the following three requirements:\n\n- stellar customer service or above and beyond patient staff\n\n- exceptional food quality\n\n- outstanding cleanliness \n\nWhile the overall experience was excellent, It's tough for Box Kitchen to get 5 out of 5 because of the way they have things set up.\n\nFirst of all it's important to note that Box Kitchen is not a restaurant; it's a Kitchen. You order your food in an alleyway inlet. There is no place to sit, other than taking your food to the bar next door. Kind of a cool \"speakeasy environment\"; not complaining here, just explaining the process.\n\nI think they'll attract a larger audience and get even better reviews (if that's the goal) if they change the dynamics and get a much larger space. But I feel flattered to be someone who knows about Box Kitchen and highly recommend to anyone who wants a high quality burger among other extremely tasty menu items.\n\nGreat job so far Box, you're on your way.", "author": "Brandon O."}

Best thing to me was the Mac n Cheese egg rolls which come with some type of tomato soup dip but I asked for hot sauce and they happily obliged. Tapatio. Smackin. The Box burger was pretty good too. Bun was over toasted but didn't over shadow burger. Also order the Buttermilk Chicken Sando and that fried chicken was off the chain. Fried to perfection and the accompanying condiments on the Sando were on point. Also ordered the potato boats with the pork. Those things were good with a decent amount of Ranch on top. All the food was good.\n\nNo seats, tough parking, next to a bar, sketchy block and peeps around, long wait but worth it for a hole in the wall.", "author": "John M."}

I might've just been really drunk (thanks Tempest) or super hungry or both - but the Tempest 5.0 was so goooooooooood.\n\nEgg, cheddar, fried kale and aioli all between an English muffin. Never really thought of putting kale in my breakfast sandwiches. Really want to start doing that now! It was all salted so perfectly. For $7-8 it's really not that bad. Your pricetag starts going up if you want sides like garlic fries and whatnot. STILL REALLY GOOD. I had a bite of the Box Burger which was equally as good. And I'm sure the rest of the menu is great too.\n\nYou really don't expect much from such a small hole in the wall, but it's awesome. You can take your items into the Tempest or even order from there (during the daytime?

The alley is a bit sketchy, but it wasn't too far from the main street which was nice. It's near the University of the Pacific on 5th St. \n\nWe ordered two Box Burgers, one Chicken & Waffles, and two orders of Garlic Fries. We waited 10-15 minutes for our food. Since there isn't anywhere to sit outside (the bar is 21+) we took our food to go. We ate it on our way home, & the food was delicious. The Box Burger was really good. I really enjoyed the honey smoked bacon (at least I think it was bacon lmao). The Garlic Fries were not too garlicky which was great. I took a bite out of my brother's Chicken & Waffles, and the waffles were alright. The chicken was really crispy and the maple syrup was really good. \n\nIt was a bit pricy, but the food was great.

The line can also get pretty long, and be prepared for a minimum of 12-15 minute wait outside as they don't have seating for box kitchen, just next door for the tempest bar.

You know how the saying goes, \"Sometimes great and beautiful things come out of tiny packages.\" That's a saying right?\n\nAnyways, as the kids would say, \"Box Kitchen is tight!\" Do yourself a favor and get the Box Burger (4.5/5 $13).

Holy cow it may have been the best burger I've ever had (definitely top 3, I had a great kimchi burger in Chicago this summer and my mom's burgers have a soft spot in my heart). The bun is crispy on the edges from being toasted on the grill, the burger itself is tender and amazingly flavorful. I thought throughout the meal it couldn't be ground beef, and instead it was Michelin Star meat. The bacon cubes and onions on the burger make it irresistibly juicy and savory. I honestly cannot say enough about it. \n\nI will be back probably daily as I live in SF and I can't live without eating box burgers now that I've been exposed to what true happiness feels like. \n\nP.S. be ready to nap after this meal.

Our box burgers were great , garlic parm fries  great. And the kid got spaghetti-os and meatballs. He said the meatballs were great too. Wait was 10 mins for the food, we ate outside in the cold. Well worth it.", "author": "Jeff N."}

We walked in to grab a drink and everyone was just so nice and friendly! \n\nUnfortunately they messed up my order and therefore over charged me but I wasn't even that mad because the egg rolls and banh mi were so good!

My favorite thing on this menu. Pastrami is juicy and the balance of flavors and textures is wonderful. \n-Chicken Sando: Very good, hearty sandwich. Messy to eat, but pretty great when you are super hungry. \n-Potato Skins: some days are better than others, but these are creamy and tasty.

Came here after we saw Hamilton to grab a bite and maybe grab some drinks. Price point wise, it is a bit on the higher side with an entree clocking in around $12-14 bucks depending on what you get. You can get some more finger food items like fries at around $6-8 price point.\n\nFood takes awhile to cook but from the dishes I had here, they are definitely worth it. Fries are crispy and done right. Burgers are juicy and hits the spot. The sammie that knocked it out of the park though was the pastrami. It quite literally hit the spot. And was one of the better tasty pastrami from a location I would not expect. There are no tables so you just kind of eat there on the sidewalk with the other patrons munching away their alochol infused breaths. \n\nThe area at night is pretty dark and a dash of sketchy but don't let that frighten you off this gem.", "author": "Andy L."}

The food here tend to be on the heavier side but also with more complex flavors than you'd expect.\n\nI am personally a big fan of their fried chicken sandwiches. The chicken is tender and juicy, encrusted in a batter resembling a cornmeal plus crushed corn flakes. The batter ends up giving a lot of nice texture. The lettuce slaw they use on the sandwich pairs pretty well. It has just the slightest hint of tang from the blue cheese that offsets the oiliness of the chicken quite well.\n\nI usually also get the potato skins - these are baked potato skins with pork belly, green onion, sour cream, and a sunny-side-up quail egg. Also on the heavier side but a great choice for the gluttonous days.\n\nI imagine it'd be hard to find something here that is a complete miss. It's sort of my go-to when I don't have strong cravings and also don't want to exert energy/time into thinking up a new place to it. It doesn't disappoint.", "author": "Chia L."}

Crispy stayed even with our walk back to the hotel. \n- elote: I have a strong love for corn, but this one was delicious and definitely satisfied my cravings for elote. It had the perfect amount of spicy that I could endure and the corn was sweet!\n- Baja fish tacos: my boyfriend got three of these and it was large enough to be filling without the other stuff we ordered. The fish stayed crispy with all its topping that didn't make it soggy. \n- chicken and waffles: perfect amount of batter on the fried chicken that wasn't too thick with juicy chicken inside. Usually chicken is overcooked but this one was perfect. The waffles were a yummy and perfect fluffiness with siracha dipping sauce.

We're staying in a hotel nearby and my teen daughter wanted a burger. I refused to go to a chain or themed tourist nightmare place and yelp turned up Box Kitchen tucked away on a side street only a block away. FABULOUS. Far better than I ever expected when I agreed to find her a burger. \n\nService with a genuine smile and tasty food - perfect. Excellent meat cooked to order topped with fresh tomato, mixed greens, grilled onions, cheese all enclosed in a quality bun that held up to the juicy burger, crisp fries and an unexpected seasonal fresh corn in a spicy sauce that had great depth of flavor. I loved the corn! \n\nAs noted in other reviews, it's only a window next to a busy bar, so if eating at the bar doesn't work for you, be prepared to carry away. I'm giving them 5 stars because this place is as good as a take-away window can be and offers a great local food experience. \n\nI should mention that this is completely out of the tourist zone. A block away can be a different world in cities and this area is the real SOMA (ca. 2016). My suburban child was uncertain about the street vibe, but she got more comfortable as we waited for our food with the friendly crowd (didn't hurt that the Golden State Warriors were winning). We certainly stuck out - us 14 and 50 surrounded by millennials - but good food unites.", "author": "Nancy L."}

While on vacation here in SF, it's always difficult for me to plan my preferred eating times around the waking hours of SF. I have a bad tendency to skip breakfast but, snack for lunch in the late afternoon, therefore looking for something to eat for dinner around 10-11pm. You can imagine my struggle whenever I'm on vacation and food places close anywhere from 6pm to 9pm. So, when I yelped for an affordable, quick bite, open passed the hours of 10pm, I was delighted to see such a well-rated joint - Box Kitchen.\n\nFrom where I was (the Westfield mall), the walk wasn't bad at all. However, I did question the area of Box Kitchen the closer I got to it. Turn down an alleyway that isn't the best lit, with not a lot of people around, great. I judged a book by its cover, sadly, but never again. \n\nI ordered the Turkey sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Bolito Misto. While I was expecting a basic turkey sandwich with not a lot of flavor to it, I was proven wrong. The turkey meat was carved and not reminiscent of your average deli meat at all. The aioli sauce on top of that... to die for! But don't let me forget the Bolito Misto. While I didn't get to enjoy the sandwich as a whole, my boyfriend was kind enough to let me try a slice of the meat and it was delectable. Small, but packed full of flavor and the aroma of the sandwich itself made it an even better experience.\n\nDon't skip the Box Kitchen like I almost did just because it's in a sort of inconvenient place. This place is well worth the price, experience, and the service was quick.\n\n***NOTE: If you are driving, there is a small parking lot directly in front of/across from Box Kitchen. However, it is $15 to park there.***", "author": "Kay E."}

Trust me, you'll be happier at the end of the night.\n\nNow, I've only had two items: The meatloaf sammy and their life changing brown butter rice crispy treat. But based off the quality of these food stuffs I'm willing to bet that more often than not you'll be wholly satisfied, even if they're out of something you were really craving. \n\nSeriously, I didn't even put ketchup on my sandwich. Ketchup goes on EVERY MEATLOAF. My Mom's, my Grandma's, and my Girlfriend's. Now I mean, it's not like I had any ketchup, and in all honesty I would have added some had it been available. However, I legitimately didn't need it. It was juicy enough to withstand the fairly thick bun and didn't fall apart at the first bite. It was also the perfect size (and the perfect size to pair with a desert or side option).\n\nThe brown butter rice crispy treat is a lie. It's more like a rice crispy pie with a buttery crust on the bottom and marshmallows on top. I only finished half, but it was a great half.\n\nI'm rather disappointed that Box no longer makes burgers. I won't knock them for it cause that's not really a food or quality issue. But the pics I saw all over and the menu on the pourguys website really got me in the mood for a burger, especially because so many Yelp reviews mention it being dank.\n\nStill, this is a great option.

I'm talking about places where after 25 minutes of waiting for nachos and ask, hey where are my nachos, only to be given a confused look and the explanation \"sorry man, but our guac guy is out for a smoke, man.\" Man. \n\nMy advice: I would recommend that this staff take a field trip to The Mission or to the kitchen of any Californian's kitchen and learn how to make make nachos, then drop the prices by 40%.

Our waitress came by exactly twice: to take our order and to give us our check. Both times, we had to ask the busboy walking by. The waitress had enough free time to watch the TV but NOT ONCE did she come by to check in on us. We asked her and another waitress for waters, but they never came. We ended up going up to the bar to get them. No apology or even acknowledgement from the waitress. We had way more interaction with the busboy.\nI asked (the bus boy since the waitress never came out) for a side of blue cheese since my sandwich was so dry. It never came, so I went up to the bar to ask. I had to stand there for 5 minutes while the wait staff watched TV. Finally someone from the kitchen brought it out.\nWhy don't they just do bar service and give up the presence that a waitress will serve??\n2. SHITTY DRINKS. We ordered margaritas. They were 3% tequila and 97% cheap margarita mix. I don't really drink, but I got no buzz off this. From the reviews I was expecting a quality drinks. Big disappointment\n3. DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. The menu sounded great online. It's rated as \"$,\" meaning under $10. Nope. When we arrived, they had taken all the cheap options off the menu, leaving only $15 sandwiches. How do I tell Yelp this? \n4. SHITTY FOOD. I ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich - two slabs of dry, overcooked chicken with weak Buffalo sauce.  It was a watery vinaigrette with a tiny amount of blue cheese in it - I'm from Buffalo, and this is NOT blue cheese dressing.  \nMy boyfriend ordered the meatloaf sandwich. The meatloaf was fine, but it was a 2 inch slab, impossible to eat as a sandwich. They couldn't have cut it down?\nThey also messed up our salad dressing orders.\n\nFAIL", "author": "Drew G."}

I had the Box Burger and it blew me away: the patty was thick and super juicy, the saltiness was just enough to make the burger flavorful. The vegetables also tasted very fresh. The price was ok: The burger was 11 dollars w/o tax which was a little high for a street food place. it was worth it though.

And I've had many (gourmet-ish) burgers in my life. The patty is cooked to a medium rare is and is extremely juicy, and the burger itself has a ton of texture (via the fried shallots) and flavor (via the thick chunks of bacon it comes with.) I could probably die happy eating this burger for the rest of my life. If you're here, I definitely recommend you try the Box Burger!\n\nWe also got to try the roasted potato skins which are topped with more thick cut bacon, a quail egg, and cheese. I got the cheese on the side because I'm not a fan of cheese (I'm terrible, I know.) The roasted potato skins were really yummy, but were also really rich; not sure if I'd recommend getting a burger at the potato skins together, as that might be too much food. They also come with a side of ranch so you can dress your potato skin to your heart's content (although there's a ton of flavor without the ranch already!)\n\nMy friend got the kale and egg burger, and she absolutely loved it! I was confused by the existence of a burger without meat, so I didn't think too much of it, but she was a huge fan. So, if you're looking for something lighter, that's recommended as well.\n\nAll in all, the food was super delicious and pretty cheap for a meal of that size.

For such a small kitchen, they have lots of variety of options like their popular Box Burger and those breakfast tacos with the quail egg on each one.  It really was way too many options to ponder.  Maybe it was the adrenaline or my uneasiness in the neighborhood, but I indulged and got some garlic parmesan fries with an order of meatballs.  \n\nAfter I got to a place to sit down and eat the food, it still tasted great even after the additional walking time after I got my order.  \n\nSince I know the lay of this land now, I probably won't feel too out of place here the next time I'm in this area.  The food is definitely worth a return visit.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I was forward to Box Kitchen, and I was very happy with the dinner I got for my bro and me.\n\nThe definite keepers were the chicken sando, the box burger, and the potato skins. You get a good hearty amount of meat for both sandwiches, and definitely filling for what you pay for. As for the potato skins, you already know pork belly and quail eggs sound awesome. Three doesn't sound like a lot, but don't expect those tiny toddler skins you'll find at some scrub like Applebee's. You're gonna get three hearty half potatoes the size of some people's hands. Definitely worth what you're paying for.\n\nThe buffalo wings were excellent as well, but didn't knock my socks off like the first three dishes. As for the Chicken IN Waffles - I get the concept and you can definitely taste the confit. But personally, I'm not a fan of the concept and the chicken-tasting waffle just leaves me hungry alone. It's a neat idea, but no substitute for your classic chicken and waffles. We also shared Tempest with Chicken Fried Steak - pretty good, but the chicken fried steak isn't prepared like the classic. Instead of thin tenderized steak with some double breading, you're getting a big chunk of meat. Enjoyable, but not what I love about CFS.\n\nOverall, Box Kitchen hits a bunch of great notes from dinner takeout to bar food. If you hit up Tempest, I don't see why you'd get food anywhere but here. Because it's damn good.", "author": "Dave N."}

It's crazy how long the line gets right after opening, lucky we were there right when it opened. The staff was super nice, and the potions were great for the price. If I had a complaint it really would be the quality of napkins (I know, it sounds petty).

I love the concept and I am thankful that my foodie friends introduced me to this place.  It is located in an alley that I never knew existed and the people traffic is mellow!  There is a bar next door, so this isolated alley to drink and eat is pretty much down to earth and low key.  Keep in mind that there is no seating! \n\nIt is endearingly a hidden gem and surprisingly a block away from the main Bloomingdale, Metreon, Powell shopping area!\n\nWe ordered up the majority of the menu.  Every dish sounded too compelling to roughly decide and settle for just one or two.  They have Chicken and Waffles, signature Box Burgers, Battered Corn on the Cobs, Chicharones, Fried Chicken Wings, Fried Chicken Sando and Crisp Potato Skins!  It seemed like a short, simple list, but it was hard to choose because all of the names sounded too savory to pass up!  They even have whole coconuts as drinks!  So hipster and random at the same time!  \n\nBasically, anything coming out from their kitchen, was top notch, comfort food!\n\nThe highlight was their potato skins!  It was perfectly crispy and a unique concept!  It is served as 3 in an order with the pork belly tucked inside the potato skin and each topped with sunny side up quail egg.  It is food-gasm in the mouth!  Believe me!\n\nMy recommendation is to order up at least 3 entrees from the menu, such as the Chicken and Waffles and Box Burger! \n\nWhether packed to go or served on a platter, Box food gets me wide-eyed and wonderfully waiting to become comfortably satiated!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

We got the burger (with a fried egg), side of fries, the fried chicken banh mi, and the sweet and spicy wings. The burger was a solid 4, but could easily have been a 5 if it hadn't been take-out. The bottom of the burger got soggy due to some sort of sauce and/or grease, but tasty nonetheless. The sweet and spicy wings were good, but didn't seem to stand out in any way, just tasted like good buffalo wings. Fries were  still crispy. The chicken banh mi was a disappointment as it just tasted like a rather dry fried chicken sandwich. It didn't have the pickled carrots and daikon, or the cilantro, or some sort of pate spread as you would expect from a delicious banh mi.

Don't let the grungy name fool you, though; I had literally the best burger I've ever eaten in my entire life here. \n\nYou know how a lot of burgers end up tasting overwhelmingly like the toppings, piled onto a charred, crumbly patty that hardly resembles beef anymore? You won't get any of that here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/box-san-francisco-2?select=ENy9FfHsWDoZ87gVhuYTRw#AuJCEcgKiGNLbwc6ULbwTw). Cooked to a perfect pink and juicy medium, the flavors were clean yet complex. The bacon shallot gastrique added a smokey depth without overpowering the unmistakable flavor of BEEF! The crispy shallots made my taste buds squeal. All this was enveloped in a dense potato bun with just the right amount of crunch. GET IT. \n\nThe chicken in waffles (IN waffles, not AND waffles!) is oh-so-clever and witty, which makes me gleeful. The confit chicken is a smart and tasty move, as you don't risk any sogginess while it's sandwiched between the crisp waffle. So is the sriracha maple syrup - it adds an interesting dimension that I can't quite describe. You'll have to get it yourself to find out.\n\nAt $8 for the burger and $7 for the chicken in waffles, prices are totally reasonable for the quality of food. We came around 6pm on a Friday evening and there was a 14 minute wait, so keep that in mind if you're planning to take it on the go.\n\nI'm sure Box gets a large portion of their business from late night bar-goers with the munchies, but honestly, I'd rather come here sober so I can consciously enjoy every last bit of my burger.", "author": "Clarice W."}

And the additional toppings I snarfed are a Bacon & Shallot Gastrique--shallots with nice chunks of thick sliced bacon. My mind didn't miss these details, they were all very present but I didn't ruin the experience by analyzing them.\n\nFinding out later these details helped me relive the experience and served as an appetizer as I waited for my new order in the bar a scant 12 minutes.\n\nSo damned good.", "author": "Travin T."}

The food here is good and their menu is great- really creative and I see it being switched up from time to time. Not 5 stars, but I would definitely give them 4.5 if I could and they are definitely a solid 4. Gotten both takeout as well as food \"for here\" (which you can eat standing up outside or at the Tempest bar next door; I absolutely recommend doing the later). \n\nAs I mentioned, they have a pretty creative menu. Lots of interesting options- think classic with their own spin. I've had the potato skins (topped with pork belly and quail egg) and the meatballs (a little too spicy for me, I wasn't a huge fan of them) but I keep coming back for the burger with garlic fries. The garlic fries are great- I definitely recommend them, either with or without the burger. Delicious garlicy fries with some awesome beer from the Tempest or other drinks = fantastic. The burger is alright. Definitely specify medium as they otherwise cook it a little too well done for my tastes; even the medium has a pretty good char on it. I'm not a big fan of the bun it comes on and tend to remove the bun and just enjoy the burger by itself. The combination of bacon shallot gastrique, white cheddar, and arugula that it is topped with is delicious. Not the best burger i have had by any means, and I think the toppings are the best part (better than the burger itself) but a solid option and I love that they let you add the garlic fries to it for a couple of extra bucks. \n\nI definitely need to come back for lunch at some point as I hear they have table service inside of the bar.

It's a take out window next to a dive bar, so adjust your expectations (puppies riding zoombas aside). But as a take out window next to a dive bar, they have perfected their niche.

I think that Box Kitchen just hits the drunk food mark so perfectly, that ever single top drunk food experience will come flooding back and you body will have trouble understanding that something is missing. How could something taste this good if you haven't been out all night?!\n\nI'm not gonna lie - While I was in SF this past week, I hit up Box Kitchen twice in one day, and no, I am not ashamed. \n\nTrip 1. Got myself the chicken and waffles. A hard combination to find in Calgary if you're looking for effort put into the two most important aspects, being Chicken and Waffles. Box Kitchen does it right and taught me a new way of life. I never really understood the American fandom to this mix until I tried box chicken's, I mean Box Kitchen's (see?! they're already messing me up!) Chicken & waffles... People! The saltiness of the fried chicken works with the waffles in a very similar way to bacon. I'm not saying chicken is better than bacon, in fact, I never would, but I will say that it keeps up. It's a re-defining genera. Go ahead and pour the syrup over everything. The two of them hold their own, but are happier when you blend them.\n\nThe waffles? Soft. Fluffy. Crispy. Magnificent.\nThe chicken? Juicy. Tender. Crispy. Magnificent.\nPut them together and you've got a home run, or a #WINNING sports analogy of your choosing.\n\nTrip 2.\nLate night, super tired albeit sober fast food craving. This led me to realize that Box Kitchen is NOT fast food, but in fact good food, fast. \nI got the Chicken Caesar Sando - hold your horses scaredy cat - a Sando is really just a sandwich... on a bun, maybe? I don't really know the difference, but that made it all the more enjoyable. The same delish deep fried chicken breast I had experienced early was now on a sandwich, covered by some American-style creamy coleslaw. Failing to find a spot to park our tushes inside Tempest, the neighbouring bar the Box Kichen Serves as a regular kitchen for, we parked our butts curbside to consume some chicken. Yup. I'd shove a Box Kitchen Chicken Sando in my face curbside - ignoring the stench of street-side urine, the Sando is one deliciously mean chicken bun-wich.\n\nI can't wait to go back.

I just wonder how the poor guy inside the place stands dealing with the crap-fest of customers that come here.

All the good stuff you would find after you knock down only two of the milk bottles in the midway. It was hard to decide, especially since it was pitch-black at 7:30PM in the Natoma alleyway where I felt like I was about to be cut.

This is when the army of praying mantises started contaminating the landscape.\n\nTwenty minutes elapsed, but the wait seems reasonable since the guy behind the window prepares the food one order at a time. You can even watch him make everything from scratch with his deep fryer going full gonzo at that hour. I took it to go since I ain't eatin' in that alley with the smoking slackers. I trundled home with my food and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know that Chicken in Waffles actually meant 'chicken in waffles' or more accurately, waffle sticks (see photo). Referring to the poultry as 'chicken carnitas', he used real pieces of shredded chicken since I actually ran into a bone in one of the waffles.\n\nIt came with a zingy siracha maple syrup, which I thought was a nice touch for all the sweetness involved. I especially liked Aron's little asset (no offense, Aron) since it turned out to be a set of mini-corn dogs that used higher-end sausages and mixed bits of jalapeno in the batter. They were delicious with an aggressive dunking into the spicy aioli (see photo). What a nice surprise this little closet operation turned out to be. It may be worth tolerating the slacker mantises.

By the time we checked into our hotel, we just wanted to find some delicious local spot that was still open. Fellow yelpers led us to Box Kitchen. All the dishes sounded great, but execution fell short (and hence the 2 stars.) \n\nThis place is located in SOMA, in a small quiet street, right next to a bar. Apparently people buy food here to bring over to the bar next door. This place is literally a hole in the wall. You order and pick up your food through the same window. There are no seats, only a small bar top for you to quickly inhale the food, or the sidewalk. There are a lot of smokers around that window, either waiting for their food or just from the bar next door, so get use to the smell. \n\nWe tried a few things but none of it was memorable. By the time we got there, they were out of the burger and the chicken sandwich. I was really looking forward to the Chicken IN Waffles from all the reviews I read before, but I was highly disappointed. The waffles were soft and sort of soggy, not crispy exterior and fluffy interior. There was so little chicken that I didn't even taste any chicken flavor. The maple syrup was suppose to be sriracha maple syrup, but it tasted like regular sweet maple syrup. So what was suppose to be awesome waffles with chicken inside with spicy and sweet maple syrup turned into regular soggy waffles with regular maple syrup. Not very exciting even for a starving person who just got off a plane. \n\nThe chicharrons were ok. The buffalo wings had a good kick but was a bit salty for my taste. Overall, I think this place has high ratings because people are drunk and/or high. If you're sober, you're probably better off going somewhere else.", "author": "Vickie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-27", "description": "Bravo to the design of the operation, providing us with affordable prices where we can take risks and order adventurously without breaking our bank.  Sure, we didn't like everything we tried, but at least we weren't angry about paying through the nose for it.  I've gone three times now and can give you my subjective rundown on most of the menu:\n\nBurger:  juicy, and great satisfying thickness.  The bun is delicious on its own too--soaked with the burger juice, bacon, and sophisticated dark greens.  Of the three times we've gotten it, it was incredible once, it was taken home and not bad, and it was pretty good.  Overall, Umami is better in terms of taste and consistency (it is ALWAYS good), but this burger is about 60% of the price.\n\nBrussel Sprouts:  Excellent.  Similar to Starbelly and Hi Lo BBQ (when they had it) etc.  Satisfying cruciferous fiber with a heady balance of sweet/sour\n\nPork adobo tacos.  If you like generous meat and deliciously pickled vegetables, this is really good.  \\I actually had to take half of the meat off to balance  it out.  1st world problems.\n\nFries/Garlic Fries:  Delicious, done right\n\nWaffle/Chicken:  Probably the most exciting sounding thing on the menu.  Not bad.  On our serving, there was a slight sparsity of chicken bits.  But it is fun and thoughtfully made.  The waffles are also made fresh to order, which you can taste.\n\nBiscuit breakfast sandwich:  pretty much what you think, except the english muffin is a bit on steroids.  Sort of like a panaroma bakery english muffin--the muffin mass overwhelmed the other tasty components.  The touch of seaweed inside was elegant.  I should've put some of the extra meat from the pork adobo tacos in this huge muffin.  There's a dirty joke in there somewhere...\n\nFried Chicken Sandwich:  The fried chicken is a nice thick breast.  It's very white, but a bit bland (didn't taste brined?).  All the fixings around it are delicious (just like with the burger). We ended up taking the chicken out and finishing off the bun/toppings.\n\nWings: standard, salty.  The vinegar smells awesome.  I wish these were as exceptional as the burger.  Maybe they could throw in some korean style wings (just adjust the sauce!)\n\nPotato skins:  if you look through other reviews, I'm probably the only person who did not like this dish.  In great part, it may have been to us taking out--and the dish losing its crunch and heat.  Besides that, for us, there were too many toppings that were not discernable, and a slightly fishy taste (maybe from the quail egg).  I won't bother trying it again, but probably better eaten IN rather than taking home.\n\nAlso, the bar next door was a more than fine place to eat the food.  If you order a lot of food, tell them it's \"to go.\" That way you can stack the plates on top of each other more easily as you make your way through the crowded bar.\n\nFree parking around, esp after 6 pm.

The burger and the garlic fries were the stars of the bunch, while the other two were good, but more interesting than anything else: the chicken and waffles were actually more chicken IN waffle batter, and the chiccarones could be likened to the shrimp chips you sometimes get at Thai restaurants, but, crispier, saltier, and tangier.\n\nI suppose it's a good thing that they don't have proper seating, because I'd be coming here a lot more than I should otherwise!

It's like a shredded chicken with an Asian fusion sort of vibe, especially with the paired Siracha maple syrup.\nI honestly did not like the syrup concoction but then again I'm not huge on Siracha so everyone else probably digs it.\nThe waffle just seemed so soggy and didn't really have flavor I could taste unless I got a piece with chicken and then again there's not much chicken.\nDid not satisfy my desire for chicken and waffles.\n\nThe Elote however... Woooo! Right up my ally. Probably because it reminded me of the Mexican corn they'd have outside of church when I was a young girl.\nIt has a nice aioli with cheese and a sauce.\nThe best part was it was crunchy and one whole corn split in half.\n\nMy boyfriend had the fried mac and cheese balls. We were so excited for them, we don't mess with our Mac and cheese love.\nThey were good but sadly only 3 of them. They come with cheese curds and they were weird tasting. Wouldn't get again.\n\nWe bet other things are amazing like the other reviews say... But I just don't know if I'll go back here again unless I come back to this area and am in need for food but not for me to drive from the marina district to here.", "author": "Eff B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-31", "description": "A hole in the wall... literally!\n\nLooking around for some late night eats and found this place on Yelp. \n\nThe place seemed a little sketchy because it's down a dark alley next to a dive bar surrounded by drunk people. If a place like this was in San Jose, you deeeefinitely shouldn't be there. But this is San Francisco. It's a totally different vibe!\n\nFirst off, the drunk people surrounding the place are pretty nice and friendly. Everyone is drunk, but they're all happy that they get to chow down on the goodies coming out of Box. \n\nSecond, the menu choices at Box are different from the typical late night fare. Chicken confit? Sriracha maple syrup? Bacon shallot gastrique?? HUH? O_O I'm definitely not at Jack in the Box!\n\nYou MUST try the garlic fries. The BEST garlic fries I've ever had. Yes, even better than Gilroy. There's REAL garlic flavor. And the garlic isn't just sprinkled on top. It must be in the oil because you can really taste it in every bite of fries! Most of the fries come out crispy, but even the not-so-crispy ones taste good!\n\nThe roasted potato skins were sooooo good. Roasted potato halves filled with chunks of crispy pork belly and topped with cheese and a fried quail egg. Talk about elevated! I wish every place made potato skins like this! \n\nThe goat cheese and bacon potato croquettes are also a good choice. The bacon inside still stays crispy in the middle. Love the addition of the goat cheese and the homemade salsa just ties everything together. \n\nThe chicken IN waffle was a surprise! You might think it's the typical friend chicken and waffle, but instead of making it a knife-and-fork situation, they actually put the chicken inside the waffle itself. Handheld and yummy! The Sriracha maple syrup was a nice touch!\n\nSometimes the wait can be a little long when the kitchen gets backed up, but the wait is worth it!\n\nWith food like this available late at night, who needs fast food anyway? Move over Burger King, Box is here to stay!", "author": "Daisy T."}

Seriously, the first time I had the Box Burger I was drunk and I worried that going back it wouldn't have the same effect. Wrong! The second time I was dead sober and it was just as good!\n\nAlways a treat to go to Box Kitchen, pick up some grub, and go next door for a nice time at the Tempest (which has great prices, a good beer list, and an interesting crowd!, great for Dubs games too.

It holds late night hours, and the food was really good! I will be back as it's in my 'hood.\n\nThey were out of the chicharones unfortunately; I'll have to try those next time. The two of us ordered the burger (with fries for $2 extra), the potato skins, and the chicken and waffles.\n\nPotato Skins:\nWow! The potato skins really hit it out of the park! \nThey're a little pricey at $9 for only 3, but they were so amazing! How can you go wrong with pork belly with an egg on top! They were perfection and worth the splurge!\n\nBurger:\nThe burger was really good and juicy. The fries were great too with just the right amount of crisp and garlic. \n\nChicken and Waffles:\nOne of the chefs recommended this item, so we ordered it, but I did not care for it. The chicken is inside the waffle, but I couldn't really taste it. It was covered in powdered sugar and was too sweet for my palate. \nThe Sriracha maple syrup was very good though, and I don't like syrup, so that's saying something. The spice in it was very nice. \nI've tried chicken and waffles a few times now at various places and I just don't think I'm into them, so take my review on this item with a grain of salt.\n\nBox Kitchen also serves lunch inside Tempest, and Tempest told me they really \"class it up with black tablecloths.\" The lunch menu looked good. Also, Tempest apparently serves free food on Sundays during football games, so that sounds fun! I'm guessing it's food from Box (so it'd be good), but I have not confirmed that.", "author": "Rebecca G."}

Simply put, there is no better burger and fries in downtown San Francisco than the Box Burger and Fries...and certainly not for the paltry $10 they charge. That's right, ten bucks flat including tax (but not tip, just the tip). It would be a bargain at twice the price. And the other delicacies on the rotating menu are worth a few bucks and your sense of adventure. Particularly the Chicken In Waffles with Siracha syrup. Grab a bite at this late nite walk up and a beer at the Tempest next door (you can eat the food in the bar) and you are guaranteed a San Francisco experience of the highest order.

With no food menu in sight we attributed the lack of a kitchen to the fact that Box Kitchen opens at 4:30pm and it was 4:10pm. For 20 minutes we waited in anticipation that this awesome dive bar would magically transform into an awesome dive bar restaurant!\n\nI counted down to the seconds as if the rapture was going to occur on the dot annnnd....nothing. Just like the actual rapture.\n\nDefeated, confused, and still very hungry we hung our heads down looking for the closest quick bite. That closest quick bite turned out to be the kitchen next door that looks like it's in a box and close enough to qualify as part of 431 Natoma St.\n\nTo save yourself from looking as stupid as I did, Box Kitchen directly to the right of Tempest outside. \n\nI got the fried chicken sando, perfect amount of heat and very juicy, almost too juicy to the point where my fried chicken had no crunch to it. As much as I want to give that sandwich another shot, there's too many other mouth watering gems on the menu to repeat dishes. Though you can't really go wrong any of the greasy food at Box Kitchen and a cider from next door. \n\nThe experience itself is worth going back. I don't remember the last time I was able to sit buzzed on the sidewalk with fried chicken in hand and not be judged for it. Hallelujah, child!", "author": "Jason O."}

Box Kitchen is in an alley way next to a bar (Tempest) or maybe it was connected to the bar. It seemed sketchy with all that. \n\nWe were greeted by a nice gentleman. He took our orders and we waited about 15 minutes for the food. We ordered chicken in waffle, fresh young coconut and the box burger with fries. The food was in a nice paper bag. I did not check the food before leaving. My friend and I opened the box of food at the theater. When I looked inside, all I saw were waffles. I was really confused. I was thinking \"Where's my chicken? Did they forget about it?\" I decided to go ahead and rest the waffles. I pulled the waffle apart and wah-la! The chicken was inside the waffle. No wonder it was called chicken in waffle. \n\nThe chicken in waffle was good. Inside I found the chicken with siracha. It also came with a side of syrup, so it gave it that sweet and spicy kick. The waffle wasn't too dry. This can be a snack, but not a meal on its own. The box burger was delicious! The size of the burger is huge. It had a good amount of meat and a lot more. I would definitely order this again and share it with someone else too. The fries were crunchy and addicting. The coconut was refreshing and quenched my thirst, but wish I had more. Probably a life time supply worth. \n\nMy other friends went to get another burger after having one bite.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience. I would love to try the other items on the menu.

When was the last time you got a burger with fried shallots and true leafy spinach greens? Usually they just slap on some iceberg lettuce, devoid of any real nutritional value or flavor and call it a day! The Box Burger I ordered was absolutely PACKED with flavor, and interesting tones I had not previously tasted on a burger. The crispy shallots and bacon shallot gastrique gave it a truly earthy, rich flavor. It really hit the spot.\n\nMy friend got the Chicken IN Waffles w/ Sriracha Maple Syrup. Nope, that was not a typo - Chicken IN Waffles. As in, the waffles had chicken inside of them. If this wasn't enough of a treat, they came with a side of Sriracha Maple Syrup! I don't even like hot sauce, and I have to admit I loved this combination. Though I question how it first came about - who dared combine the two?? Defying all logic, the sweet maple mixes well with the spicy Sriracha sauce, giving a great kick to the classic chicken and waffles. The perfect late-night snack.\n\nI cannot recommend Box enough - their menu is innovative, delicious, and reasonably priced, and their service manages to match this quality. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to come in a car or cab. Don't walk or bus it to the area, especially if you aren't from the city and especially at night.

A literal hole in the wall serving late night bar food from a walk up counter next to a bar (using the bar's previously unused kitchen?).  Not as sketchy a corner as you'd think given the proximity to 6th Street (a.k.a. Crack Alley).  Best strategy is to turn on to Natoma from 5th to avoid the nearby street theater (and I don't mean Boxcar).  All the food was made to order, so it was a good thing we were the only people there else I might expect a long wait.  Seemed like an interesting menu so I will definitely be back to try other items like Aaron's Little Wiener.\n\nFried Pickles: Some of the best fried pickles I've ever had.  Very thinly sliced so when they're fried, they are actually crispy. I hate when fried pickles are so thick that they are still squishy after being fried.  Love the sour contrast to the salty fried crust.  Some nice seasoning, like Old Bay (?) on top.  A nice creamy dipping sauce helped add extra calories.\n\nWings: The sauce seemed Asian soy inspired, almost like something you'd expect on a spare rib.  But it worked.  Though I love hot wings, I appreciated all the spices going on in this sauce and enjoyed the experience of trying to figure out all the flavors.\n\nChicken in Waffle: Innovation!  Why throw fried chicken on top of waffles when you can put chicken inside the waffles???  Kind of like a bacon waffle, but with pulled chicken bits.  Extremely tasty.  Could have been better though if the chicken was battered like little popcorn chicken.  Came with a nice cup of syrup to provide the very familiar sweet contrast.", "author": "Adam B."}

(Which is pretty much why there is a line there in the first place).\n\nI know that the area looks dodgy.  It probably is.  But you don't want to miss this spot and late at night there simply are no alternatives.  \n\nPerfect for dieters or those considering a diet that consists of tasty grilled and fried foods.  \nDelicious?\nYes.\nWhy?\nThese guys understand how to season/flavor and cook. \nMost places cook stuff till it is tasteless dry cardboard/leather.\nBox Kitchen cooks food so that it still has juices and flavor.\nActually knowing how to properly prepare food is a rare trait that we normally must pay a substantial premium for.  (Think Ruth's Chris or Lawry's as opposed to any mediocre restaurant/steak chain that hawks leathery jerky steaks and meats by cooking everything well done, even if it is ordered rare).\nUnlike the rare premium places that know how to prepare food: this place is seriously cheap.\n\nSo the food rocks.  \nIf you make it (alive) out of the alley, (I mean off of Natoma Street): you can bring your own dining room with seatbelts, comfy seats and great music to make this a fun place to eat or see if you can get your box home without opening it and munching on the way.  Either way is pretty much a tasty adventure.\nOkay, maybe I exaggerated how comfy the seats were.  I mean how scary the alley was.  Oh hell: if it is late you have few options anyways.  You gotta eat, just do it.\n\nAll joking aside: I love Box Kitchen and I rate it a full 5 stars.\n\nEdit/Update 2 days later.

I omitted the bun, 'cuse I was \"trying to stay healthy.\"\n\n- Garlic Fries, pretty bomb.com but eat them there and don't take them to-go. You know fries aren't traveling food, as much as your brain tries to convince you otherwise. \n\n- Chicharones - skip them. That's been the one disappointment at Box.

That's not the case at Box...it's those chips that you buy at the corner market and it's not worth your $$$.  \n\n- Beet & Apple Salad...WHOA. No words...this salad is amazing. So good. I was on a 30 day fruit diet and couldn't find any places to go that would abide by my dietary restrictions, but this made me love being on my horrible diet.

I think there was a small table top but I can't be sure of it. It's an order and eat somewhere else type of joint so it's totally fine. My friend and I just ate in our car, away from the cold. \n\nWe arrived at around midnight after coming back from San Jose for a Sharks game on a Wednesday night. There were other people around but not a ton so we were able to order and get our food pretty quickly. \n\nJessica and I split some garlic fries and adobo tacos.

A mid-week meeting in SF is always pleasant because I will have an opportunity to try some new food spots.\n\nSo sitting in my car after my meeting, I had an honestly long debate with myself (I am not crazy I swear) about where to eat.  On my long list of places to try, Box Kitchen just kind of called to me that day and off I went.\n\nBox is tucked away inside the Tempest on tiny Natomas street so it can be a challenge to find.  Once inside, my first thought was total dive, and my face lit up with a smile.  I got to the bar, ordered an Allagash White and proceeded to have another debate of what to eat (not crazy).  Finally, after some serious soul searching, I decided on the Potato Skins and The Tempest Breakfast Sandwich.\n\nPotato skins - HOLY! A must order.  Crispy fried, topped with braised pork belly, cheese, and fried quail egg all sitting atop sauce.  Oh man this was sooo good.  And the salty fried goodness is perfect with beer.\n\nThe Tempest - Delicious hand made English muffin? Check.  Fried Egg and Thick cut bacon? Check.  Cheddar and tomato? Check.  Crispy Kale? Ohhh yeah check.  Tomato coulis? Drool.  This is one seriously good breakfast sandwich and is one that is a benchmark breakfast sandwich (even though I had it for lunch).  Definitely a must try.\n\nThere are so many things I still want to try on this menu.  I could only fit so much in my stomach.

Unless you are eating in the bar next door there is not sitting spots for you to eat, unless you want to stand and eat off the tiny bar next to the door where you order at. The area might seem a little sketch at night to just stand and eat your food sober. While I was ordering there was a lot of drunk people also ordering food which took quite a while. The food also take a while to make but to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt above their menu does give us a warning asking us to be patient. The food itself is delicious. I had the potato skins which was absolutely delicious if you are a potato lover. The pieces are big filled with tender deliciously marinated pork belly, cheese, a quail egg & amongst other ingredients I was not able to explore because it was quite dark when I got my food. I only finished 2/3 potato skins from my plate and that filled me up a bit. I saw a couple people walk away with the poutine which looked really good. We also ordered the \"Box Burger\" which is one of the most popular items on the menu according to the chef. The burger was really flavorful and over all very tasty.", "author": "Teena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-16", "description": "If you've gotten very drunk at the bar next door and need something to satisfy those drunchies, this is certainly the place to be. If you're sober though, this place is ok. I came here for dinner and got the chicken in waffles. I loved the idea of it. There's no need to alternate between waffle and chicken. You can just have both with every bite! While it was a great concept, the actual food was a bit of a let down. In terms of flavor, it was nothing special, but the most disappointing part was the portion size. I certainly expect more food for $7 at a fast food place. I was left still hungry after finishing my meal and I had arrived there feeling only mildly hungry. My brother got the box burger. He let me have a bite, and his burger was delicious. This was probably the only real redeeming part of this place.  My friend ordered the fried pickles. We probably shoud've canceled it the moment the guy at the counter needed to check that that was an actual menu item. It tasted like eating deep fried blocks of salt. \n\nThe other downside to this place is that the food is pretty slow at coming out. I waited nearly half an hour for my tiny waffle, and my friend waited even longer for her garlic fries. Even though I was still hungry, I didn't want to order anything else because I didn't want to be stuck waiting forever for more food. Most people wait it out at the bar next door, but since I had someone under 21 with me, we were stuck standing on the street with not even a bench to sit on to ease the wait. In case you've never seen it, it's just a window you order your food out of. There's no seating available.\n\nIn terms of price, sides such as garlic fries cost $5. Everything else costs $6-8. Yelp rarely fails me, but I have to assume this place has 4.5 stars because a bunch of drunk people at the bar next door decided to rate it.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

The fries tasted like dehydrated fries. I like my fries crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.\nTacos were the size of the ones you buy from taco trucks aka street tacos and again, not worth $7 for two. You are better off buying the street tacos.\nThe only valid reason why this place may have earned 5 stars is perhaps its connected to the bar at the corner so hungry drunks only available option for food is Box Kitchen. \nI suppose if you're hungry and it's late night, anything would be good.

And really, when you get down to it, the best part of Tempest is its proximity to Box.  A shady little window just down the block from Tempest's entrance, doesn't suggest \"culinary wonders\" to you.  But lemme tell you, after a beer or four, a fried chicken sandwich from Box is about the closest thing to perfect as you can get.  Well maybe the brussel sprouts are the closest thing to perfect and the burger is the next most perfect and then the chicken sandwich.  But where does the waffle with fried chicken inside fit in this ranking?  I don't know.  Go try them all and decide for yourself.\n\nAs if serving food to drunks after work wasn't saintly enough, I just learned that Box is open during the day - with table service right inside Tempest.

I'm with an out of town friend who suggests \"Let's just eat anywhere\" Not without checking Yelp I reply. So I see Jon A's review on this great little place that is only 1 mile away. Let's go! \n\nWe walk through the Mission down some sketchy dark streets, down a dark side street and here is this crowd of people gathered around a doorway counter. It looks like the place is built into a garage. There is no seating, it's just a dark street and a window and wow is it ever busy! \n\nAfter I ordered I found out you can take your food over to the bar next door and eat. I was told 15 minutes come back, and we ventured next door. The bar was packed, $2 draft and not a seat in the house. We ended up eating in the street. My friend was all weirded out and questioned my choice just after ordering, but after the first bite he shocked. Best burger he has ever had. I loved it too. Totally worth the wait, lack of seating, etc. \n\nThis to me is San Francisco. Excellent food in the weirdest of places and always a wait for something good.

Incredibly juicy, no sauce needed! I believe the patty lay on a bed of spinach or arugula and there were shallots under the bun. Biting into it reminded me of the movie Ratatouille where all the flavored heavenly pop together... Just wow! And I've got to say the fries were a hit! I've always had some gripe about fries at this place or that: any garlic ones being too mushy n soggy. These hit the spot! Just crunchy enough on the outside, moist on the inside... The minced garlic complementing them perfectly. Phew, I feel slightly selfish knowing I found this hidden gem on some concerning back alley. I tried the potato skins just for the hell of it, based solely on reviews but not expecting much because that's not something I would typically crave...ever. Thus, I was underwhelmed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "Warning: long rant/review.\n\nThe decent:\n1. The food. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't an OMG moment either. The food concept is creative and different-ish (i.e. siracha maple syrup), but that's all it was - different. \n\nThe bad:\n1. The wait. 25 minutes for chicken in waffles, garlic fries, and a honey mustard crispy chicken sandwich. The sandwich came out in decent time; less than 10 minutes. The other two orders they forgot about. When we were there, there were 2 customers ahead of us and 2 after us. C'mon now. It's not exactly the dinner rush. And when we asked to have them double check the order, the chicken in waffles had actually been sitting on the counter all along, and they had to quickly pull together the garlic fries.\n\n2. The environment. Literally a hole in the wall. No seating, no tables, nothing. There were cigarette butts EVERYWHERE. You could not avoid stepping on them. And so many people hanging outside of the bar were smoking and spitting at random places on the sidewalk. \nAfter we placed our order, we had to wait at the sidewalk. I had literally just come off a 2hr commute from Sac to pick up the boyfriend for dinner, so I guess I was tired + hungry and therefore cranky, but when this very intoxicated and loud group of 6 came to stand with the 1 guy in their group who ordered, I got ANNOYED. You're all standing in a close circle. Why are you screaming at each other?! Talking louder does not make you appear to be a cooler person. It just makes you obnoxious. Not only were they loud, but the extremely trashy jokes they threw around about rape were really insensitive. It made me question how they behaved when SOBER.\nAnd maybe we came at a bad time because they were wheeling out their trash bins and emptying compost into the bin. It's not very appetizing to have your trash bins next to the order window, but with such a small \"storefront\" I guess they have no choice. \n\n3. The attitude. I understand that when dealing with intoxicated, loud, obnoxious customers, you need to be bruff and stand your ground, but not ALL of your customers have had a drink and/or a smoke. We certainly did not need to be given an attitude over a bag. Yes, we did not ask for it to go, but you did not ask us either so we are both at fault. Just give us a darn bag already. Jeez. It doesn't have to turn into a DEBATE over who did and didn't do something. \n\n4. The correction. When my boyfriend said \"chicken in waffles\", I guess the \"IN: was not pronounced enough for the guy taking our order. It was not necessary to cut my boyfriend off mid-order and say, \"It's chicken IN waffles.\" Yes, we know. \"Chicken IN waffles\" is what the sign says, but when we got our order, it was more \"waffles with specks of chicken here and there\". The sign should be corrected due to its lack of chicken. \n\nNormally, I go to a place with low Yelp ratings and am pleasantly surprised by it. This is the first time I've gone somewhere with high ratings and ended up so unsatisfied. I really don't see the hype. I guess you'd have to have a drink or two in you before you find it's appeal. \nHonestly, the only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because in my annoyance, I found it slightly entertaining when the guy behind the door was arguing with an intoxicated Tempest-goer. I was also amused by the group I found annoying in the first place; their conversation made them look so....brilliant.....*cough*", "author": "Florence S."}

I thought it was the bar/lounge so I was about to just bounce, but luckily the bouncer told me Box was next door.  The eatery is literally a hole in the wall.  You order from outside the kitchen.  The place looks clean enough though.  Me and my friend ordered garlic fries and a box burger.  I would have to say that the garlic fries are one of the best I've ever had.  They definitely compare to the garlic fries at the ballpark  I didn't really try to the burger  but my friend said it was really good and he's super picky!", "author": "Steven S."}

I'm never eating an expensive burger anywhere else as long as Box is around, it'd be a waste. The Bolito Misto pork belly sandwich, garlic fries, and hush puppies are great too. \n\nApparently the new chef arrived a month ago, which explains why there's only been 5-star reviews here since then... \n\nThey're open from 11am-3pm weekdays now, in addition to 5pm-1am every day.

Chicken in waffles sounded legendary and the menu and pictures quickly led to the necessity to try. what was actually there was very plain and lacked complexity. The fries were good but if not frozen aren't they always?. Chicken sandwich is boring with dry bun. The ingredients in all the dishes sound provocative at best but seem no better then more simple and familiar ones. Next too loud bar it was clear this was a satellite kitchen feeding the demand of its drunk patrons. Might go back for  the burger especially if I am at the tempest an need to soak up the booze.", "author": "Jake C."}

Was already lured in when I saw pork adobo tacos and chicharones on their menu! Nice vibe once you walk into the bar Tempest. I like the whole divey bar look with tagging and stickers everywhere! Once I sat down and saw the whole menu with chicken and waffles, I was set, but was a little bummed when the waitress told me the waffle machine was broke. I still went with pork adobo tacos which were tasty! I would definitely want to check this spot out at night again in the nearest future!!", "author": "Jayce M."}

My friends would always message me with something like, \"Be there in a sec grabbing food\" and then show up with these pretty good wings. By the time I figured you know I should get food and ask them where they got these from, I was a little too out of it to figure the rest out on my own. Finally after coming with some more friends we landed here and all got food before hand and I got to discover a dish which called to me. Chicken IN Waffles. Rather than having to mess around with trying to eat the chicken between to waffles or should I make a sandwich or should I eat them alone ... this was easy, they just put the chicken carnitas in the waffle batter and sliced up the waffle into strips. This was genius in my mind and pretty good too.", "author": "Greg G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-10", "description": "Wow.  The only thing I've had is the Box Burger and it was absolutely fabulous, just exPLODING with flavor in every bite and perfectly balanced and pleasing textures.  How do you do that with a burger?  Right up there with the couple of best-ever burgers, ever.\n\nThe \"salad included\" is an outstanding mix of baby spinach, baby kale, and a few other greens all with great flavor; I got the balsamic dressing which was light and tasted superb.\n\nEvery ingredient carries its weight, does not overpower, and is there for its specific contribution to the overall experience.  Verging on masterful, for $10!!  At least as far as the burger goes... but other reviewers indicate similar outperformance for the other choices as well.\n\nI walked past Box a bunch of times because people say it's \"next to\" Tempest.  Well I didn't find anything like a window \"next to\" Tempest.  It must have been closed (lunch time).  Just go inside Tempest, sit down at a table, and order the food -- it's Box.\n\nAnd it doesn't hurt that the playlist has Doors, Pink Floyd, Beatles, Stones, Aerosmith, etc.", "author": "Mike K."}
