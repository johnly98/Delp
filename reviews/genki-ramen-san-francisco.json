So we yelped Ramen and this place popped up within walking distance. As we arrived, there were only two tables...it was after 10pm. So I am not sure if we beat the crowd or that no one knows yet how tastey this place is. \nThe one waitress was really nice and friendly, greeted us with a smile, answered all my questions. They even have a Japanese bar and tap as well, which is pretty cool.\nThere is a free Yelp check in offer, but what it says, might not be, as it changes, depending on the night and what they have left. That night they were giving out the wakame.\nI got the Chicken Karaage, and man was it yummy! I loved how they brought the karaage on a separate plate, keeps it nicely crispy. The broth was super tastey and so hot. It stayed hot the whole time...which is how to do it...\"ahem *cough* kopan in fullerton\" can learn a tip or two. \nI loved the corn in my soup. So much that every bite had a good amount. I really enjoyed my ramen.

The broth was rich and slightly oily. The braised rib was fall off the bone tender.  The egg was not soft boiled, but hard boiled which was a tad disappointing. Ramen had a nice chew factor.

C'est la vie of non-hobby hobbies when you're inside 80 hours a week....\n\nI had the tonkotsu ramen with cha shu (pork) and a ribeye skewer. The broth flavor wasn't as \"piggy\" as some of the other spots I've had, but was also a bit more salty and not as complex / creamy as some of those other spots. The noodles themselves were pretty al dente and had conformed to the shape of the box by the time they arrived on delivery (totally understandable). The cha shu was a bit on the dry side of things, but they provided four pieces, which is pretty generous vs. some of the other ramen spots, though the pieces were sliced medium-thinly. Whoa the middle of their soy sauce egg was super salty. Eek. The soy sauce egg (half) was fully cooked through. 2.5/5. \n\nThe ribeye skewer could have benefited from some pre-marination and was generally pretty tough. The meat itself seemed of good quality though, and I enjoyed the flavor of the fatty piece that they added in between the meater bits. 3/5.\n\nAs much as I'm trying to adopt a genki (enthusiastic / lively) mindset these days, I'll have to not be super genki on this spot for now.", "author": "Nicole H."}

It's spicy mapo tofu, but it's mild not as spicy as it seems. Super flavorful in each bite and the ramen noodles are soft, just the way I like it! There's also pork bits with green onions, and the soup is thicker and on the runny side, but it's not a weird texture. \n\nWe also ordered the chicken karage and there was a soy oyster type of sauce on top!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "The food here won't knock your socks off, but you can definitely get a large quantity of pretty good tasting food especially during happy hour.\n\nI came here at 5:30 on a Sunday, and there were only like 3 groups here, so there was no wait, which I really appreciate; one of my pet peeves about San Francisco is having to wait for everything. Happy hour runs from 3-6 PM at after 10 PM 7 days a week (including weekends), so it's actually pretty accessible. The appetizers are $4 during happy hour, so I ordered some chicken karaage along with my chashu ramen, which was $10.95. Just FYI, lunch is served until 5 PM according to their menu.\n\nMy food all came out within 5 minutes of ordering, so it was super fast. I got a complimentary wakame salad for checking-in (they didn't have edamame or the cold tofu), which apparently is a seafood salad. It was really clean tasting, without a strong seaweed flavor, and just lightly dressed. It was definitely a good start to my meal.\n\nThen came my chashu ramen, which was overall pretty good. Mainly, there's probably around 6 slices of sliced pork, a good handful of bamboo shoots, and noodles all in a slightly cloudy tonkotsu broth. The pork didn't really have a strong BBQ flavor, but it actually tasted pretty clean, like pork shoulder just roasted in the oven. It was actually pretty good, but didn't have that distinctive chashu taste that I was expecting. I wasn't a huge fan of the bamboo shoots, they were just kind of there and stayed out of the way. The noodles are nice and bouncy and didn't get too soaked in the broth, so no complaints there. And the broth had good substance to it and had a rich pork flavor throughout, so you could tell that they had boiled the bones well for this broth. It's not a complex flavor, but it hits the notes that it needs to.\n\nThe chicken karaage came out piping hot, but was probably the most disappointing of the 3. It was a lot of chicken, probably about 12 pieces, but the outside was a bit too heavily coated, and the inside was a bit overcooked. It wasn't dry yet, but it was headed that way. But I can't really complain because for $4, it's still a good amount of food and a good value. Plus, it was still tasty, just not the best I've had. For that same amount of chicken karaage elsewhere, you could definitely be paying up to $9-10 bucks.\n\nThe pictures can be deceiving, as I actually got a lot of food. I walked away from this restaurant full, which is really a rarity. It's a pretty unassuming place, and people aren't tripping over their feet to get here, but it is solid quality food with some very reasonable prices. The food probably won't wow you, but it gets all the basic things right for a good meal. This place is definitely worth a visit, especially if you can make it during happy hour.", "author": "Eric Y."}

It has a wide variety of Japanese food, such as donburi, yakisoba, and even okonomiyaki.  The menu within the ramen category is super eclectic; they have unusual (aka inauthentic) kinds such as sparerib ramen etc.  Therefore, I refused to try their ramen.  Instead, I opted for their okonomiyaki.  But I had doubted it that their okonomiyaki was authentic either.  First all, one option that came with their okonomiyaki was to \"add ramen for $2\", but in Japan, people put \"soba\" onto okonomiyaki, not \"ramen\".  So just from that, I knew it wasn't gonna get real okonomiyaki.  But the beef okonomiyaki with ramen that I ordered turned out to be pretty tasty.  The beef slices were too thick making them tough to chew.  The noodles were incorporated within the batter which is totally unusual since they're usually served on top of or below the okonomiyaki.  But overall it was okay.  We also ordered chicken karaage which was not good at all.  They used the wrong type of breading so they tasted more like American style chicken fingers than actual karaage, and they drizzled tonkatsu sauce over them rather than serving it on the side in case customers don't like it.  The takoyaki was delicious but hella small.", "author": "Kev H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-12", "description": "A solid if somewhat unremarkable place for homemade Japanese Ramen, Genki Ramen is just one of many places where you can get you can get Japanese noodles on Geary Boulevard in San Francisco's Inner Richmond neighborhood. I came to Genki Ramen because my dining mates had been here before and wanted to take me here plus the fact that this was an affordable mom and pop place for some down home Ramen didn't hurt at all.\n\nWe came on a Saturday evening at about 7pm and the place wasn't busy at all, as I was able to get a table in the back of the restaurant. You'll notice the rich wood on all of the walls and tables that combined with all of the multitude of flat-screen televisions turned to sports programming provided a homey almost bar-like atmosphere. Since I was sitting back of the restaurant cell phone service is limited in that corner and when I asked if there was a WiFi password to their WiFi option I was immediately rebuked by a server. I must admit despite having the name of the restaurant being named Genki Ramen, the menu has much more than that including Robata grilled items, sizzling rice plates, and even Japanese pancakes!\n\nBut let's face it I was here for their signature dish, their Ramen noodles, the only problem I had was in deciding which one I was supposed to choose on their menu, as I counted no fewer than 19 noodles and soup and three cold Ramen noodle dishes. Decisions, decisions,sometimes it's worth noting that less is more when it comes to menu items. But after a long deliberation, I went with number 412 on the menu, Beef Stew Ramen made with tender, braised beef brisket, spinach, red ginger, served in a tonkatsu base. My dining mate went with a more ambitious meal option with number 703 the beef Okonomiyaki, which is a sizzling deep dish pancake served with shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and topped with seaweed flakes, pancake sauce, mayo and bonito fish flakes. My noodles were a nicely prepared dish with beef that was nicely sliced and prepared as it were pork belly the only drawback is that I wish there were more noodles in my dish to go with all of that excess beef broth. My dining mates' pancake looked unique enough almost like a Japanese pizza, but here too I thought the quantity of food here was lacking. Thankfully Genki Ramen does have a check-in deal via the Yelp app and between a choice between the Edamame or Cold Tofu, we went with the tofu which was an amuse bouche which came topped with dipping sauce and green onions.     \n\nAll in all, we had a decent time at Genki, we were able to sit at our table and enjoy ones company as we dined on our noodles as there wasn't too much business going on to move us out. I would consider coming back for lunch perhaps, as they seemed to have some affordable options. Unique ramen dishes with a flair? Count me in all of the time for that!", "author": "Jason F."}

They had a long night of drinking, and her boyfriend kept insisting we go eat here after 3910. The way he was explaining it... he seemed to really like going here late nights for a simple bowl of ramen. \n\nI don't know of many ramen places that open late, so this is a plus for them to attract late out goers who are seeking for a warm bowl of noodles to comfort them before heading home. I was a bit skeptical at first because I figured that it was his drunk taste buds talking, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.\n\nThe place looks a little run down. I think they can use a little update because the leather on the booths are all cracked. There's also a sour smell the second you walk in, kind of like a old mop that needs to be replaced, but its just sitting there. \n\nThe workers were really nice! We were seated right away.

Genki Ramen lost a star right when I entered the restaurant. There was a huge faulty smell as if they were leaving the trash out in the open at the back. I wanted to leave right away but decided to give it a try anyway. I suppose someone decided to finally take the trash out because the smell was gone in 10 minutes. \n\nIt was our first time here so we spent time looking at the menu. They have a variety of ramen, rice, appetizers, and beverages. The waiter seemed a little impatient and approached us twice for our order. Luckily I caught that tea is $2.50 so we both opted for iced water. \n\nI went for chashu ramen while my boyfriend chose a garlic flavor. There wasn't even broth and way too much ramen. It seems like their 'garlic' flavor was literally minced garlic added to the broth because the meat was dry. \nTheir menu incorrectly advertises soft boiled egg because ours were clearly boiled tea eggs.\n\nI would recommend Saiwaii Ramen on Irving Street for friendlier service, flavorful broth, and more importantly ramen that isn't falsely advertised.", "author": "Danae L."}

Personally I would rather take the 2 crepes :3\n\nThe ramen here is okay. The broth is saltier than usual, the noodles are QQ'er than usual noodles, and the menu has more options than usual. However I suggest sticking to the basic chashu ramen, because most of the gimmicks essentially just dumps a curry or stir-fry on top of ramen. \n\n(-) Shoga Niku Ramen ($10.95 stir-fried pork with ginger in tonkotsu base): I thought it would be based on Japanese ginger pork (shogayaki), but this turned out more like kung pao pork with slices of ginger over ramen. There was no synergism, and the heavy soy sauce and chili were an odd mix with the tonkotsu.\n\n(+) Chashu ramen ($10.95): Decent and will satisfy ramen cravings, but pricey for what it's worth. No magical broth, no magical soft-boiled egg, no magical melt-in-your-mouth chashu. On the plus side, there's good amount of chashu (could be considered extra meat at more pretentious ramen joints), and it's lean cuts. \n\n(+/-) Chicken karaage side ($1 extra): $1 sounds like a deal, but the plate tiny--the size of a soy sauce & wasabi saucer! At least the karaage was solid and tasted like zesty popcorn chicken, drizzled with the delicious sweet sauce that typically accompanies croquettes.\n\nI'm very close to giving this 3 stars because you dine comfortably here. The ambiance is modern and spacious, featuring lime green and dark wooden chairs each branded with the restaurant name and Kanji character--maybe the ramen here is on the pricey side in order to cover the cost of the custom chairs.\n\nThe service unfortunately bumps it down. The attitude was very robotic and RBF, which I usually don't mind, but it led to a lot of small inconveniences. Even though it wasn't too busy at 2pm lunchtime, it took awhile to get seated, it took awhile to get menus after we were seated, and it took awhile for us to get the check. They also only gave 2 Hi-Chews for 3 people and ignored us when we asked for the third one :( If we were snarky, we would've used some tip $ to buy own Hi-Chew at Genki Mart :3", "author": "Edna C."}

The broth is very savory and oily, probably from the mapo tofu oils embedded in the soup.\n\nTan Tan - stir fried minced pork with chili and pepper flakes in vegetarian base:\nTastes like dan dan mian in soup form. Spicy broth with lots of chili pepper flakes. Tons of spicy, savory minced pork throughout the bowl with thick, chewy noodles. \n\nI guess I like Sichuan dishes in noodle soup form.\n\nThe menu is pretty hefty with a bunch of other Japanese-style comfort food options, like okonomiyaki, robatayaki, takoyaki, curry, etc. They are not bad for the price point, but the dishes that stand out to me are definitely the Spicy Mabo Tofu & Tan Tan ramen (~$10). \n\nThe restaurant itself has a good amount of seats. There are tables on one side, and a small bar on the other, as well as a couple of high tables.

The dish comes with 2 croquette's and a side of hoisin sauce for dipping. Only complaint is that the croquette's could have been more crispy on the outside.\nTAN TAN RAMEN - 3/5: Unfortunately this was my least favorite dish. The noodles were cooked very well and it came with a generous amount of minced pork, however the ramen broth lacked in flavor. Tan Tan Ramen normally has a sesame flavor to it with a kick of spice, but this had zero sesame flavor in it.

I could be wrong, but Japanese ramen noodles are supposed to have structure in the ramen to avoid absorbing moisture. I eat a lot of noodle soups and I generally prefer to have softer noodles.\n\nService was mediocre. The dining room is nice and modern, except for the music; they were playing popular modern American music which is strange for a Japanese restaurant.\n\nOther food my family and I ordered: Seafood Okonomiyaki, Cold Chicken Ramen, and Seafood Yakisoba. Again, nothing wowed me.\n\nAt least, Genki Ramen gave me the first opportunity to eat Japanese ramen and I am thankful.", "author": "David T."}

This is because I don't live in New York. Everyone knows San Franciscans go home and sleep early. No one goes out on week days. T wants to take me for ramen. Great. Just great. I want to sleep. Reluctantly said yes a few days before the actual evening, I told my gf in the known (of Inner Richmond) that I'd be heading to her direction, for some ramen place on 4th and Geary. She immediately responded, \"You mean Genki.\" I replied, \"I don't know. I just know that it's on 4th and Geary.\" Apparently she has heard about it from her friends who have children like she. And apparently this is a kids friendly place (which sums up the Avenues). Thank goodness that evening no kids on sight, only youngish people who are, I guess, kids in the eyes of people who are of certain age, present company included.\n\nAllegedly the chicken wings are good. I ordered only 1 stick, seeing that I was not enthusiastic about eating out twice in a roll. The previous night I was also out and I was beginning to feel the effect of staying out late. It was very good, surprisingly so.\n\nRamen: that's a toughie. I have a few of my favorites: Ippudo in lower east side, naturally; Izakaya Sozai in Inner Sunset; Halu, also in Inner Richmond, Santa Ramen and Ramen Dojo in San Mateo; Jimbo sushi in Alameda (of all places). Men Oh Tokushima has been a good long standing place for me whenever I felt adventurous, a couple of years back. \n\nGenki is not among them.\n\nThus the coin toss brain surgery earlier on that resulted me messaging T, because clearly I have nothing more important to do on this evening but to write reviews.\n\nBut this is very much a people's food place. You can show up without a reservation, which is always a plus if you are not in the mood of shuffling among a crowded restaurant. You can watch sports because there are countless TVs on the wall. Your companion tolerates your bitchy attitude once again and is so accommodating of your mood. Your girlfriend endorses this neighborhood restaurant and proudly and quickly identifies the place. Did I mention that I was with a friend who's practically a saint when it comes to dealing with my mood? And he likes this place. \n\nThere you have it. I may be back, dragged and kicking. But I may be back. Next time I'll try their odds and ends and avoid ramen.", "author": "Victoria E."}

He liked it dipped in the tonkatsu sauce.\n\nChicken karaage - chicken nuggets ($4.95)\nGood. The outside was nicely fried and crispy.\n\nGyoza (5 pcs) - pan fried pork dumplings ($5)\nOkay. Kinda oily and all the dumplings stuck together.\n\nBeef & enoki roll: shredded kimchi and enoki mushroom wrapped in sliced beef, seasoned with spicy miso sauce ($7.50)\nI think there was too much sauce and it was too one note. I love enoki mushrooms and beef, but the tastes and texture were just mushy.\n\nChashu ramen: house made boiled pork served with half boiled egg, bamboo shoot, green onion and red ginger in tonkotsu base ($9.95) +Boiled spinach ($1.75) +Spicy miso (+$1)\nThey forgot my spicy miso! Arg! This is the second time this has happened so I was annoyed. It was only $1 and if they had come by again with the miso, it would have been too late. The broth is very light, both in consistency and flavor. I was expecting it to be richer. Chashu and toppings were okay. Some slices of the chashu were a little dry. I did like the boiled spinach though.\n\nOx tongue robatayaki: with salt ($2.75)\nPork neck: with soy sauce ($2.95)\nIka yaki robatayaki: giant squid with soy sauce ($8.50)\nChicken gizzard: seasoned with salt ($2.50)\nShishito: japanese green pepper with salt ($2.50)\nAll the robatayaki skewers were pretty good. The squid was a little too sweet for my liking. And the gizzard was super rubbery.\n\nCurry tonkatsu rice - deep fried pork chop with curry sauce ($8.95)\nThe roommate's. I wish they put the curry on the side so the tonkatsu breading wouldn't get soggy en route during delivery. \n\nChahan rice - fried rice with chashu ($9.25)\nI didn't like this at all. It had a nutty flavor. Almost like there were peanuts in there. Maybe it was some kind of nut oil? Anyways, the roommate liked it. Since I'm not a huge fan of nuts, I didn't care for this dish.\n\nIn all, I would give the food 3 stars. But -1 star for forgetting my spicy miso again! What a waste of a $1!", "author": "Elena N."}

We ordered the gyoza (potstickers $4.75-5pieces) and Takoyaki\n(octopus balls with aonori, okonomi sauce, mayonnaise, dried bonito flakes and red ginger- $4.75). \n\nI ordered the Butter & Corn Ramen (house made boiled pork, fish cake, corn, butter and green onion in miso base $8.25). It was OK. I've definitely had better ramen, in terms of the broth and bite of the noodles, something was just lacking. Also, I didn't think they'd actually put slabs of butter in it. I mean, what's gluttony if you can actually see the bad stuff you're eating! My cousin I believe had the Chashu Ramen (house made boiled pork, half boiled egg, bamboo shoot, green onion and red ginger in tonkatsu base $8.95).

The place is pretty HOT and it's dimly lit. They do need some sort of ventilation though, it was so hot inside. \n\nService is alright. The woman who was telling us where to sit wanted us to sit at the bar when there was already an available table that could easily fit 5 of us. We asked politely if we could be seated there instead and all she did was give us a pretty smug look before attending to another group and seating them in the bar .___. \n\nThe menu consists of many options, from ramen, to cold ramen, to rice plates, appetizers, and even skewers. Many of the dishes range from a price of $7-$10, especially if you're going for their ramens. I ordered their Chicken Karaage Ramen ($7.50) and was exceptionally okay with it. It contained corn, green onions, and wakame in a tonkatsu base. The portion seemed smaller than what I would get at other places that serve ramen, but I guess it's alright since I also had chicken karaage. The soup was nice and warm, although it was a bit bland in my opinion. I added a dash of red pepper for more flavors, but it's definitely up to you on how you like your soup :-).\n\nChicken karaage was served in a separate plate. Crunchy exterior, chewy interior. Deep fried, but no sauce or nothin'. Sorta bland, but given in huge chunks lol. \n\nOverall, this place decent. If you're super hungry, i wouldn't quite recommend it though, not only because of the wait, but just because you could probably find another place with similar food faster.

The takoyaki came out hot and were small enough to fit inside your mouth although you have to be careful not to burn yourself!

If the quality of the food is of such high caliber, I guess the temperature could be secondary...maybe. But when it's middling to begin with, why add insult to injury by making the broth just a cut above room temperature? That's what happened when I ordered their house special, the $9.75 bowl of Garlic Tenderous Rib Ramen. The tonkotsu broth would have been so much more flavorful if they bothered to light a switch under the burner.\n\nThe roasted garlic and spinach were fine, but the concept of \"pork soft bone\" threw me since I nearly cracked a molar with some of the pieces swimming in the broth (photo: http://bit.ly/16lfIe6). I also went for a pair of the Robatayaki barbecue skewers which I found a bit overpriced for the paltry amount of meat provided. The $4.50 Lamb Chop with Mint Sauce was barely a lamb chop with little trace of the mint sauce. I was about to call in CSI when it dawned on me that the mint could have been in the marinade. A more reasonable deal could be found in the $2.75 Pork Neck with Soy Sauce where assume to innards of a pig's esophagus were threaded onto the stick (photo: http://bit.ly/11oWVxJ).\n\nI frankly liked both skewers but they were gone so soon. An added bonus came by way of my virginal check-in which yielded a \"Free Daruna Tofu or Edamame\" coupon which had me shoving my iPhone into the young waitress's confused face. She informed me in an indifferent tone that the free deal that evening would be a pair of Potato Croquettes (normally $4.50) (photo: http://bit.ly/10JY9Ms). I was disheartened by the prospect since I had a flashback to a classic Yasujiro Ozu film where the unmarried daughter came home to her traditional Japanese family much too late to have dinner with them and could only have croquettes with rice before going to bed.\n\nThis sad scene of rejection was accompanied by the moan of a mournful oboe indicating how the daughter lost face as she nibbled on her croquette. But when my croquettes arrived, I actually enjoyed them. They reminded me of the pocket hash browns you get at McDonald's but less greasy. I actually meant that as a compliment. Anyway, I just found the whole dining experience at Genki Ramen on the lackluster side, although that doesn't appear to stop the hipster parade from coming in here, something the waitstaff appears to anticipate with brio. When I got up from my chair simply to adjust my pants, I was given the heave-ho with an abrupt \"Oyasuminasai!\" Well, OK then.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...lukewarm ramen and skimpy skewers make the free Mickey D-style potatoes the default winner\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...synthetic is the only adjective that fits here (photo: http://bit.ly/10mfCur)\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...nice enough until it was time to release my table\nTOTAL - 2 stars...genki desuka?...only semi-genki, dude", "author": "Ed U."}

Either that, or maybe I really am just a nice guy.  ;)\n\nWhile I'm genuinely surprised with how many stars I gave Genki, I should say it's not because their ramen is bad.  Rather, it just seems so unremarkable now compared to what you can get at newer places in SF.  Something like the Garlic Tenderous Rib Ramen is fine and all (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/genki-ramen-san-francisco#o15fNqy49Qaz6KTNhBLsRA), but it falls short compared to the Spicy Garlic Tonkotsu at Saiwaii Ramen or the Spicy Tonkotsu at Men Oh Tokushima.  Between the mediocre broth, average noodles, and lackluster meat, there isn't anything about the ramen to distinguish itself.\n\nWhat Genki can (and should) hang its hat on though, is its menu.  Beyond staples like Gyoza, Agedashi Tofu, and Takoyaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/genki-ramen-san-francisco#RO91LjXQ90opGakYS70GKg), it's cool how they offer up unique dishes like Seafood Fried Rice and favorites like Seafood Okonomiyaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/genki-ramen-san-francisco#77mln--fYhO2OySTR0e27Q).  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the Takoyaki and Seafood Okonomiyaki were pretty decent as well - both had a good amount of octopus/seafood and were cooked quite nicely.  Also, on a side note, it's surprising more places don't include okonomiyaki on their menus considering how people love it so much.\n\nEven though Genki is more wallet friendly than other ramen joints, I'd personally be willing to pay a few bucks more for something much more satisfying.  But if you're looking to eat in the area (especially if it's late), Genki isn't the worst choice you could make either.", "author": "Mike L."}

Top favorites are: beef stew ramen (nice brisket, spinach, tonkotsu broth), spicy mabo tofu ramen (chinese style mabo tofu with minced pork in a thick sauce, so delicious!), noodles with meat sauce, beef enoki mushroom rolls, yakisoba, and chahan. \n\nThis isn't one of those authentic japanese ramen restaurants. They've got a huge menu consisting of different types of ramen, noodle dishes, sizzling platters, rice, appetizers. Happy hour 4-6 pm and 10 pm is amazing. $3 appetizers and cheap drinks ($15 for a huge pitcher of beer). If you check in you get a free appetizer as well. Lunch menu you can order a ramen and pay a few extra bucks to make it a combo (choice of gyoza, karaage, or chahan). All three are yum.\n\nI used to come here a lot when I was back in college. Pretty good food for the price you pay as a college student. Plus they deliver :)", "author": "Ava F."}

They have good happy hours in the early evening and late evening with food and drink discounts. However I will always get their ramen. My favorite is the tenderous pork rib ramen. The meat is super flavorful. Their soju cocktails are also pretty tasty. \n\nThe one thing I would ask this place to improve is their broth. It's not quite flavorful enough... I always end up having to add the spicy flakes and chili oil to oomph up the flavor. It needs more salt or something. \n\nI would come back here again because it seems to be one of the few ramen places in this town I can get into without having to wait in a massive line.

They offer a mix of \"asian\" style foods, which I don't actually know what that means, but I watched the owner of Genki say that on a video. They have items like Kimchi ( which is traditionally korean), and also Shumai which is a chinese dumpling.\n\nAnyway, the ramen was average and it curbed my ramen craving. I was looking forward to trying Ramen Dojo, but couldn't make it out because of the rain. \n\nI opted for the Negi beef ramen with extra green onions. Totally not traditional. I was most disappointed to find out that it was not typical ramen. Did not come with a soft boiled egg, which I was craving. It came with good beef stir fry with onions and green bell pepper with ramen noodles and broth. The broth was good, I think the saltiness and garlic flavor of the beef added to the complexity of the broth. \nMy two friends I was with, said that their broth ( the same broth as mine minus the beef ) was very bland and had no flavor as far as typical tonkatsu broth it did not meet their expectations. They both chose the chasu ramen and weren't very impressed. They were both disappointed that the ramen came with only 1/2 of an egg and it was hard boiled. \n\nWe were disappointed to learn that Genki no longer offered okonomiyaki.\n\nGenki seems like a fun place to drink with friends and enjoy a mix of asian bar foods, an american izakaya if you will. It was super cheap, only 30 bucks for 3 ramens. Not really my style, but I know a lot of people would find the atmosphere enjoyable. The ramen was \"okay\" overall, but not the authenticity that I look for in ramen. The service wasn't anything spectacular. Probably wouldn't come back unless I was in the neighborhood, walking distance away.", "author": "Alexandra C."}

You can select your choice of appetizers or mixtures to complement your bowl of ramen, ranging from the customary chashu to katsu or tofu.\n\nHappy Hour:\nTheir happy hour offers several appetizers are a lower price. I haven't ordered the regular portions of these appetizers, but I was shocked by how small the portion was for the Nasu Gomaae (which by the way is absolutely delicious) and daruma tofu (just okay - not that special).\n\nDinner:\nAs I don't live in San Francisco, I most often find myself enjoying the ramen here for dinner. I almost always stick to my chicken karaage ramen, but occasionally deviate to chicken katsu or chashu. \n\nOverall, this place has good food at reasonable prices, a nice atmosphere for conversations, and almost always no wait.

What a sleeper hit.\n\n---\n\nMy girlfriend used to live a 5 minute walk from this place, so we came to Genki at all hours - for lunch, for dinner, for late dinner, and best of all, for happy hour (we were in love with their blue So Cool drink that is literally 95% Yakult and 5% alcohol).\n\nOver the three years she was in SF, we found ourselves returning time and time again to Genki, and slowly we've also sampled most of the menu. \n\nHonestly, I consider this one of the best ramens in SF, and I'm saying that with a straight face, totally serious.\n\nWhat Genki does right is not the traditional miso, shoyu, shio...traditional ramens. What Genki does right is making impeccable fusion ramen, so don't come here expecting a solid bowl of traditional tonkotsu.\n\nGenki excels at blending flavors together, even superimposing dishes like Negi Beef and Shoga Niku on top of a bowl of ramen and having it work (which, incidentally, are my two favorite ramens at this place). The flavors are always delightful and super yummy. Granted, sometimes the ramen tastes so good that I wonder if I'm just having a healthy dose of MSG, but since I trust my tastebuds which are essentially ultra-sensitive detectors (I get super thirsty an hour afterwards), it so far passes my test.\n\nVery broadly, the appetizers are so-so (but great during Happy Hour when they are discounted), yakisoba and okonomiyaki are alright, but the ramens - ALL OF THEM - are fantastic. The skewers aren't worth it - save your money and get a second bowl :)\n\nOh, while you're at it, make sure to indulge in some So Cool Yakult goodness. Can't wait to go back!\n\n+ Recs: Negi beef, shoga niku, kinoko mushroom, kimchi, mabo tofu\n+ During lunch you can add a small chahan or karaage to your ramen for $1 extra. The extra portion is tiny but I do it anyway :P the karaage is very average.\n+ Ask for more of the little plates of pickled cabbage they give you in the beginning :P\n+ Happy Hour: 3-6p, 10p-close, 7 days a week, $3 appetizers and $3 drinks! :D", "author": "Chris S."}

The broths not fatty but still pretty good. I'm giving this place only three stars because its always a hit or miss on service here. Food is always good and so are the drinks. Coming here on a friday night though means you've got a wait ahead of you. Service, like i said is a hit or miss. There are days where service is on point while other days you might just get someone completely rude and have it ruin your day. Otherwise if service was on point every time...

Not sure if everyone will have the same luck with this place as I have had.\n\nThe two bowls I like here are the chashu ramen and the butter & corn ramen. During lunch, you have the option of adding a side dish for $1. I usually get the chicken karaage since they give you a lot for just $1, versus only two pieces of gyoza.\n\nYou can watch some sports in here too - one time during the Giants' playoff run we came here during lunch to catch part of the game. It was pretty nice too because not a lot of people would think of watching games at a ramen shop.", "author": "Allen C."}

Wasn't terrible so I have nothing negative to say, but I will say: 1) they asked if we were ready like 2 mins after sitting down, not enough time to take a good look at the menu and decide unless you're a regular and know what you want. and 2) no one came and checked up on us the entire time until we were done eating and she asked to take our plates away.\nI might come back if I'm ever in the area again and craving ramen or something.

All in all the ramen was pretty good. A bit salty but still good. The gyoza I think is made fresh and to be honest they weren't that great. Fell apart and stuff. Different tho as far as the wrapping style. \n\nThe service on the other hand was terrible!! The staff wasnt helpful when I asked questions. They didn't have an expressions on their faces. Like they were mad we came in an hour and a half before they closed... Boo hoo hoo. They took a fat chunk for tip that's already included. \n\nNot sure if it's a place I'll ever request to go to but I don't mind going there :)", "author": "Melysa T."}

Despite knowing that the sodium-fat one-two combo could exacerbate my migraine & make me feel even shittier, I chose ramen anyways because the instant gratification of tucking my head into a big, steaming bowl of noodles trumps all potential ramifications. Genki Ramen, you made my owie all better! \n\nI chose butter & corn ramen ($8.25) & added bamboo shoots for $2. I asked for no fish cake (ewww), but lo & behold, there was the plastic-looking white piece with it's signature pink swirl swimming in my miso broth. After I quickly fished it out (no pun intended), along with the roasted pork (which bf referred to as average tasting), I was left with a light broth, perfect, long chewy noodles, two pats of melting butter, corn, green onions & my favorite ramen topping--bamboo shoots. Delicious! The butter gave a familiar taste & a slight richness to the broth. Just the right amount of toppings & good ratio of noodles to broth. The flavors were just right. I'm definitely a fan!\n\nThe ebi spicy mayo was an excellent appetizer--half a dozen medium-sized fried & mayo-coated shrimp sitting on a cloud of crisp rice noodles. I love this dish everywhere I've had it; easily a winner. Bf ordered samurai wings which had an awesomely crunchy exterior. \n\nCheck in on yelp for free edamame or chicken karaage.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I think they used the same menu writer as Ajisen.\n\nWith the kimchi they brought out a small complementary bowl of pickled veggies (cabbage, carrots, etc. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=Mv0EuRwlQU-XtVALUZCQ7g). I wondered what the kim chi appetizer would be. Just a bowl of kimchi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=oBiK3dBJcKQKqxOq-jAOvQ). It was getting along in sourness. I liked it, but maybe time to add Kimchi Chigae to the menu!\n\nThe ramen was an OK bowl, but some issues. First off it seemed short on broth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=oeqI5MZ__BFnjFFBc7q3ww) and being a conical bowl a little height at the top is a lot of volume. In the end I had a small pile of noodles in a smattering of broth. Never had that happen before.\n\nAnyway, the tonkotsu broth had good flavor, but it could have been richer. Maybe this is better for maintaining my girlish figure?!? The straight thin noodles were slightly on the soft side (overcooked).\n\nToppings included half of a boiled egg, slices of roast garlic, spinach, the namesake tenderous ribs. The seasoned egg half was grey around the yolk and chalky (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=kvjcdfiTbC7lYeJmYl0c2A); plus was that it was seasoned. Wasn't a big fan of the roast garlic; it was very hard and didn't have much garlic flavor. The clump of spinach was forgetable as well.\n\nThe tenderous ribs were decent. I liked the flavor of the braised meat, but they could have been more tenderous ;-) Plus there was a large bone to meat ratio (see pile of bones http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=q2GwBmW8YEgIRYr5zuZanQ) Ajisen's tenderous ribs win the ramen rib throwdown.\n\nThe cha-han was GREAT! Delicous flavor and nice tender chunks of pork. Made me wish I'd ordered the Cha-shu Ramen :(\n\nThe waitress kept my water glass full, but didn't seem like she enjoyed her job.\n\nOh, and they called their broth Tonk*a*tsu (breaded pork cutlet), not Tonk*o*tsu (pork bone broth).

It really shouldn't be there if they don't plan on delivering.\n\nI was craving for some ramen but Izakaya was closed (second time they have failed me), so a quick search for \"ramen\" on Yelp and came across Genki Ramen. Was glad to see that it's happy hour, even though nothing much on the menu appealed to me.\n\nOrdered:\n     - Garlic Tenderous Rib Ramen($8.75)\n     - Chashu Ramen ($7.95)\n     - Crispy Daimaru ($4.75) free with check-in on Yelp\n     - Takoyaki ($3) happy hour price\n\nI also wanted to order their Happy Hour priced Matcha Swirl ($3) to-go, The waitress kindly told me that I wouldn't get that at HH price, but I can order it, get a to-go cup, then pour it in myself (wtf). I thought it was pointless and wasn't worth the trouble, so I didn't get it.\n\nTheir ramen is their claim to fame, since it's clearly in the store name. To be honest though, I thought it was mediocre ramen.\n\n:::Pros:::\n     - Not just 2 measly slices of pork \n     - Broth was pretty good\n:::Cons::: \n     - Noodles were soggy and 'cheap'\n     - Low broth to noodle ratio\n     - Prices were high for the quality and quantity\n     - Fairly small amount in the bowl\n\nNone of the fried appetizers were anything to be proud of either. Both were lacking in filling and were skimping on key ingredients.\n\n:::Crispy Daimaru::: reminiscent of cream cheese wontons. They made the mistake of using 2 skins just to wrap one filling's worth, perhaps to look bigger and it won't look as sad to have 3 big circles on the dish, rather than having 3 pieces that only took half the space. When you bite through the crust and finally get to the filling, it's sorta worth it. A little like imitation crab with spinach. To be fair, this was a free dish so I won't complain too much, but I would be pretty pissed if I paid for this.\n:::Takoyaki::: looks really delicious, nicely fried, and had a good taste. It was a whole different story once you bite into it. The batter tasted underfried, and there is only 1 little piece of octopus :\\ quite sad. I ended up taking bites of it just to look for the octopus piece and left a bunch of half-eaten takoyaki halves on my plate. \n\nThis is one of those places you come for the ambiance, music, colors on the wall, LCD screens, and the fact that it probably won't get too crowded. They did, however, have good happy hour options and prices (including alcohol). But if they are serious about being a ramen shop, they really need to amp it up because if they only served ramen, this place would be a joke.", "author": "Azn B."}

The ox tongue was cut into cubes, which made the meat hard and dry. Recommend them to cut it into slices instead, would be more tender. The scallop was nice, but again, not so fond of the oil. The tomato and pumpkin was a nice idea, but the cherry tomato turned out to be sour, the pumpkin too hard, and again, everything dripping in oil.\n\nAlso ordered a garden salad, which turned out to be SO small that its not worth the $3 at all! How small you ask? I finished it in 3 bites, with the lettuce and tomato and the corn bits. THAT was how small it was. For something that is similar to a house salad that cost $3, it was definitely not worth ordering.\n\nThe Chasu Ramen came in a big bowl, but it had a shallow dish, which meant the serving was not as big as you thought.

Also, they only serve you half an egg, and it was hard boiled, not the soft-boiled egg I am so fond of when having Ramen.\n\nThe ramen noodle was also pathetic little in portion. Usually i can only eat about half of the ramen at any other places, but at this place, even all with the extra food that I ordered, i still finished all the noodle and craved more. And the waitress assured me that the lunch special serving was the same as the regular portion...\n\nLast but not least, the broth they used for the ramen probably had MSG added into it, because I was feeling super thirsty the whole time, not to mention my tongue was also feeling a little bit weird (a common side effect when I consume MSG).\n\nThe only saving grace of the whole dining experience was their karage, which was crispy, tender, and juicy. Too bad I ordered the lunch special and there wasn't enough to make the rest of the nightmare go away.\n\nService was also non-existent. 10 minutes into my meal my water cup was running empty, and with two waitress and two other tables, I was not offered a refill the entire time (I was there for about 35minutes total). And no one came to ask how I was doing once they were done serving my food.\n\nThis is a place I would avoid. Overpriced for the portion, MSG added Ramen, oily yakitori, and bad service.

At first sight, this place looks really franchise-like.  They appear to take a page from the book of Aijisen.  It's interesting to see a sign that they cater, comes off as a bad sign to me.  There's a clipboard waiting list in the front after entering the doorway.  On the day we went, the clipboard wasn't needed.  We were sat immediately and upon checking in saw there was an offer for free edamame or chicken karaage.        \n\nOn this ramen outing, I actually got my parents to come with us.  That was a nice change of pace.  It's always a funny sight to see my parents react to food they don't necessarily eat on a normal basis.  While my parents only shared a bowl of chicken teriyaki which came with miso and a salad, we went to the route of ramen of course.  Little Bun ordered the nori ramen combo with pork fried rice and I got the chicken karaage ramen combo with gyoza (comes with two).   \n\nThe ramen looked fine at first glance, until further investigation things were different than they appear.  The taste of it didn't do the presentation justice.  Like a less than half filled reservoir during drought season, the bowl was big; what was inside wasn't as much as one would visually expect.  The chicken karaage, placed on a separate plate, was appetizing enough.  The coat of batter wasn't overdone and not overly oily.  Regrettably, I can't be as positive about the ramen.  The noodles lacked the chewiness expectant of awesome noodles; texture of it felt overcooked.  Due to the lack of other ingredients, the broth was forced to be the epicenter.  Regrettably, the broth couldn't shoulder a more favorable overall approval with a flat lining flavor that was satisfactory at best.  \n\nBecause of the area, my expectations were slightly raised.  Most of the disappointing points were derived from that notion of thinking.  I may be harsh in critique, but there are some encouraging aspects.  The ramen combinations are good deals.  It'll definitely fill the stomach at an affordable price.  There's a check-in offer however long it may last. The happy hour times give Genki Ramen a step up compared to options like Halu that is also in the vicinity that opens only at night.  I'd defer to other restaurants in the area with so many choices, but Genki is a decent enough outlet for simple ramen needs.", "author": "Arnold T."}

That being said, I can't say whether Genki does it really well or just mediocre. \n\nHowever, I will say it's not a great place to go if you're vegetarian/vegan. There are very few options, even if you tweek some of them to exclude items that make them non-veg (such as asking for appetizers or dishes without bonito flakes.) Also, I'm a little inclined to think that almost anything you get here is going to have some fish thing in it, even if the menu doesn't state it does (nor does the server.) I got the non-broth version of the curry veggie. It was really good, but I had a stomach ache afterwards and I don't know whether it was just really filling or if something was in it that shouldn't have been.\n\nIf it weren't for the stomach ache (which didn't occur until after I left the restaurant), I'd say the food was pretty good overall. In addition to the curry veggie, I got the tofu salad (without bonito.) Both dishes appeased both my tastebuds and hunger. Also, my friends and I got to take advantage of the free appetizer you can get right now if you check-in on yelp!!\n\nI probably wouldn't go here again, both because of the limited options and it being pretty far from my usual neighborhood haunts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-23", "description": "Don't go here looking for gourmet quality food.  \n\nGenki Ramen is an under-appreciated Japanese restaurant that is a combination Izakaya (Japanese tapas) and Ramen shop all under a single roof.  Genki Ramen is like Randy Moss.  When you first look at him, he looks like the best receiver in the league.  Upon a closer examination, you realize that there is something slightly wrong with him.  If you use Moss in the right system (New England), he could be very useful.\n\nWhen you examine Genki's dinner menu, you are impressed by the number of authentic Japanese dishes.  When you eat it, some are very good, but others have some fatal frauds.  They make mistakes that normal Japanese chef would never make, which suggests that the chef is not Japanese.  If you know how to avoid these landmines, Genki could be very useful.  Of course, if you are not an expert in Japanese cuisine, you will probably not notice these mistakes, so you might enjoy their food without any issues, which is a good thing.   \n\nHOW TO USE GENKI:\n* Go there for lunch, order Chashu ramen ($8) with $1 fried rice and $1 gyoza.\n* Go there with friends, order a bunch of grilled robata-yaki items and enjoy them with Kirin or Sapporo draft.\n\nHITS:\nOkonomiyaki - While not perfect, it was pretty good.\nCharcoal grilled items, including Chicken Gizzard\nHomemade gyoza\nPumpkin and Yam tempura\nUjikintoki - nice dessert\n\nLANDMINES:\nGrilled onigiri - what the ?!? Genki's version was really bad.\nNoodle pouch - ???  It looked good.\nPapaya salad - forget it.\n\nATMOSPHERE:  Who decided to install 5 flat-screen TVs?  Is this Best Buy or a ramen shop?  If you get past this confusion, it's actually the nicest looking ramen place in San Francisco.  J-POP videos included Otsuka Ai, Goto Maki, Country Musume, Morning Musume, and an episode of Music Station.   \n\nPRICE:  Nice value!  Note that their lunch and dinner price differ.\n\nA sample dinner for two:\n$2.50 A stick of grilled chicken\n$1.50 A stick of grilled shishamo \n$2.50 A stick of grilled chicken grizzle\n$2.25 A stick of grilled minched chicken\n$2.50 A stick of grilled asparagus bacon\n$8.75 Okonomiyaki\n$4.75 Gyoza\n$8.95 Chachu ramen\n$5.50 Large Kirin Draft\n$7.50 Ginjo class sake by glass\n$11.00 Tip and taxes\n----------------------------------\n$58 for two people\n\n------------MY RAMEN REVIEW-------------\nTheir regular ramen was pretty good.  Not dynamite, but I am glad that I found another ramen place in San Francisco, although I prefer Katana-ya.  Genki has some embarrassing 'pseudo ramen' (as quoted by Nobu K.), like curry tonkatsu ramen and shrimp tempura ramen.  It required some guts on my part to eat at a place where the chef thought it was okay to throw in a tempura into a ramen.  Do they think ramen is soba or udon?  If you stick to their standard Chashu Ramen, you'll be fine.  \n\nMEN (Noodle): C-.  Probably the weakest part of their ramen.  Medium thickness, not so wavy, not so yellow.  I wished there was a little bit more firmness ('koshi') and elasticity.  I have no problem that Genki uses packaged noodles.  As mentioned in my past ramen reviews, many famous Ramen shops in Japan also outsource noodles to big factories.    \n\nSOUP: B-.  I liked the fact that they have one soup, instead of offering the usual 3 choices (miso, shio, shoyu), which indicated that Genki spent the time and effort perfecting one soup.  They use a pork bone based soup, brownish color.  It was very smooth and easy to eat.  If you are not a fan of fatty Santa Ramen soup, you might like Genki's soup, which was not oily ('sap-pari').  While the positive word is 'smooth', another way to say this is 'lacking substance'.   \n\nTOPPINGS: B+.  Their homemade roasted pork (cha-shu) was very nice, although I wished it was not so thin.  Green onions and bamboo shots (menma) was just fine.  THE BEST part was their boiled egg, which was flavored.   It is common in Japan, but quite rare the U.S., probably because it is an acquired taste.  If you never had your eggs this way, you might not like it.    \n\nImportant note: As with all my ramen reviews, I avoid comparing these ramens to the ones in Japan as that would mean that the majority of ramen shops in the U.S. would receive below average rating.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

I finally discovered recently that they're not quite as busy during the weekday lunch hour so that's when I made my visit.\n\nI was greeted by the lone waitress who gestured to me to take a seat anywhere.  The interior is quite nice with soft avocado green tones, dim lighting, comfortable custom-made chairs with high back support and flat panel televisions throughout airing CNN and the Food Network (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=skSB5mgp0CCRpY6zD-I-8g).  The empty bar looked quite nice with all of its soft colors (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=wm3JCj88qgn6Wzaskkf0oA).  There's a large window in the back of the restaurant that looks into the open kitchen.\n\nAs the waitress served other tables I got a chance to study the lengthy menu which has good descriptions of all of the selections.  I asked about the seafood sampler appetizer dish, but the waitress quite honestly told me it might be too much food (along with an order of ramen) for one person.  I selected the deep fried Chicken Karaage and the Chashu Ramen with the addition of corn.  There are about a dozen items you can add to your ramen, for additional costs of course.\n\nThe wait was quite lengthy for the food to arrive.  I understood this though because there appeared to be only one chef working in the open kitchen preparing food for many tables.  I sat back and watched some decadent desserts being created on the Food Network.\n\nThe Chicken Karaage (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=098hWFpepQEafzvxnSTAYw) arrived first, but my order of ramen was fast on its heel.  I allowed the ramen to sit a bit while I sampled the chicken appetizer.  Maybe I expected more than just deep fried chunks of lightly battered chicken thigh meat.  Just slightly tastier than an order of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, the moist chicken chunks arrived with a drizzling of sauce.  I couldn't make out what that sauce was because the chicken was so salty that it overpowered the sauce.  I've never been more thankful for that cup of complimentary hot tea.\n\nThe Chashu Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ml0zISgWDnt1hDWorSMNiw?select=pmSWIkmZMvpLcwD7pE9TMw) was much better.  The menu states that the broth used is meat-based.  I couldn't really tell because the broth was very milky in appearance, but this was the best ramen broth I've ever had.  It was perfectly seasoned and just mighty tasty.  I often eat up all the ingredients of ramen dishes and leave the soup to be discarded, but I liked the soup so much that when I had finished the bowl was nearly empty.  There were lots of flavorful slices of tender, marbled pork and the bamboo tips were nice and crunchy.  When they add corn, they really add corn because there was lots of  it.  The single negative was the hard boiled egg half whereas the egg white was steaming hot but the yolk part was room temperature cold.  There was a fair amount of ramen noodles underneath those ingredients too.\n\nI'm not familiar with the different types of ramen noodles, but these appeared to be similar to angel hair pasta in appearance and texture but much softer to the bite.  I loved the ramen, and I'll certainly return again for lunch.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Also, my bf ordered a side of spicy miso and the waitress forgot. We had to remind her and although she brought it out, it tasted like sweet tomato paste with a speck of spiciness. On top of that, our waitress charged us for 2 servings of spicy miso although I never asked for it. Had it been less busy, I wonder if the visit would have been better.", "author": "Maya S."}

I just went a hour ago so...I may be bias because my tummy is full and all smiles. Just kidding! I will not let my satisfied tummy get the best of me! Here's my thoughts and views in all honesty! \n\nPARKING SUCKS. Genki is located on a busy street so do try to find parking in the neighboring streets but be warned that it spent me a half hour or more each time I've gone. \n\nHAPPY HOUR IS COOL. $3 appetizers including Takoyaki (6 pieces) and $3 drinks like Watermelon juice, which tastes fresh, and the Matcha Swirl, which is like a Matcha Frappucino. \n\nSERVICE IS FAST. Food usually comes out in 20 minutes or less and that means all the food! The waitresses are also very efficient in taking your order and giving you your check.\n\nThe place is also pretty big so you do get seated pretty quickly. The only bad part about the seating is that all the tables are very close so if you get up, you probably will booty bump someone in the face. However, there are TVs on each wall so you're highly entertained while eating. \n\nThey have a LOT of choices of ramen (around $9). The noodles themselves look like they came from the ramen packages but the broths are very flavorful. Do try the House Special Char Shu if it's your first time! Chicken Karaage is good since they give you a lot of the fried chicken on the side. Shoga Niku is also very good but note that the stir fried flavor does overpower the broth. And my fav is the Beef Stew because I think that the portion of meat to noodles is just right. All the portions are just enough to make you happy. \n\nI love their Okonomiyaki! It's a huge portion so it's easy to share and the flavor is really good! \n\nI didn't like their Yakisoba. It is a giant mound of noodles stir fried with meat and vegetables on a sizzling platter but it does get very salty after awhile. I kept guzzling my water. Also, no on the Crispy Seafood Roll because it's not worth the price and the taste is bitter. Same thing goes with the Crispy Daimaru..there's barely any filling and you only get three pieces. \n\nI know I wrote a lot but the menu is HUGE. Genki Ramen is affordable, fast, and great for groups! Enjoy!", "author": "Joy L."}

After a quick Yelp search, I found that Genki had a number of these tasty Japanese pizzas to sample.  I went over for lunch one day and shared the Sumo with a coworker.  While it couldn't stand up to the real McCoy, it was bursting with savory flavors and a hint of sweetness from the Japanese mayo on top.  Yum!  In addition to the okonomiaki, we had a beef and enoki mushroom roll which I enjoyed, as well as some standard but tasty gyoza.  If none of these things are quite what your taste buds are seeking, Genki had a very extensive menu with most Japanese staples well represented.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious, and the d\u00e9cor is decent and simple.  I don't know that I would head there for a date with romantic ambiance, but it will certainly fit the bill for most meals.

I'm consistently amazed by the fact that every time I've gotten food here, it's always been fresh and surprisingly delicious. Delivery has been speedy and I'm impressed that the fried food is always really crispy. It's near impossible for me to get genuinely good delivery anymore. I'm always disappointed with the experience in some way... Well, not with Genki Ramen. I only wish they had dessert or some kind of sweet thing on their menu, because their dinner menu is so vast and creative. \n\nOne of my favorites tonight was the boiled pork. I randomly ordered it not knowing what to expect. It was juicy, delicious slices of pork that tasted poached or lightly cooked. Amazing. Reasonable size for the price, too, unlike some other items. One weird quirk on the menu is the size of tofu for the price. Their version of agedashi tofu is delicious, but it's in really small portions and I usually order 2 ($7). I feel like it's wrong to pay that much for tofu, but the toppings are pretty delicious and the sauce tastes expertly made. I think the problem is that they consider it fried tofu and think they can mark it up, but other nearby places offer the same amount for half the price. \n\n'Im not a huge ramen person, but I did enjoy their tempura ramen. Curry chicken cutlet is amazing too. Definitely a greasy dish, maybe more on the unhealthy side of versions I've had, but good. This place is ideal if you want to go on the healthier side of unhealthy. If you order all fried, it's obviously pretty bad, but they offer a bunch of grilled items that are amazing. I always get 2 orders of the roast buttered corn skewer ($1) each, and it has this amazing charcoal grilled, light buttery flavor. Once we ordered the silken tofu salad and was shocked at how fresh the sliced tomato an avocado were. We ordered the soft shell crab thinking I'd get half the amount. There were 4 huge ones, all delicious, light, fluffy and crispy. The balsamic vinaigrette sauce obviously has an American twist, but I think it adds a huge kick.\n\nI'd say that yes, it is a little pricey, but I feel this place deserves 5 stars because it offers free delivery that for me has been both speedy, with food still hot. Full disclosure I live nearby, but in all my time ordering from other places--near and far-- precious few have quality, delicious food. Tonight one of the employees was a little snippety on the phone because I messed up my Eat24 order, but I don't even care because the delivery was super quick and everything is amazing.

We were seated right away as only half the restaurant was full and had our orders placed in a timely manner. I glanced over the menu quickly (they have a huge variety of ramen) and decided on the shrimp tempura and seasonal vegetable miso ramen. We also ordered takoyaki and food came out in no time.\n\nI don't have much experience with takoyaki, but I will say it was pretty good. The fried batter on the outside reminded me of potato and there is a small piece of octopus inside along with the pickled radish and fish flakes and kewpie on top. For 6 pieces, it was about $4. My ramen came out right after and I was happy to see a large plate of assorted tempura with my bowl of ramen and nori. The broth was good because it wasn't too salty, which is the case a lot of the time for me. It is different from some other places because it's also not as rich. Nonetheless, the noodles and broth were pretty decent.\n\nLastly, while we were eating, I checked in on yelp and noticed a free offer and decided why not use it now? You have the option of seaweed salad or these crispy spinach and cream cheese wontons. Of course I went for the wontons...It came with a sweet chili sauce and was ok.\n\nTotal came out to be a little under $25 with tax. 2 ramens, 1 takoyaki and a free appetizer. Not bad!

Silky pieces of tofu were deep fried perfectly so that the outer layer remained crispy when served.

The Japanese pancake was flavorful and tasty, however, I wish there were more pieces of spicy sausages.  \n\n*Chashu Ramen ($8.95) - The tonkatsu soup base was a bit on the salty side and I drank the miso soup base from the butter and corn ramen instead.

We opted to add $1 for spicy miso which came out as a paste\n\n*Butter & Corn Ramen ($8.25) - YUM a must try!  The miso broth was delicious and the sweet corn perfectly complemented the dish.  My only gripe about this dish is that it didn't come with enough broth.  TIP: Ask for a lot of miso broth.\n\nEXTRAS:\n$4 for the watermelon slushy drink - FRESH watermelon blended, it was quite refreshing\nGenki has a large variety of sake\n\nBONUS:\nHi-chew candy with your check!\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waitresses were nice but they never came back around to check on us.\n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking which is often difficult in the area, even at 9:30pm we found ourselves circling for a space.", "author": "Nicole S."}

My sister and her friends were in agreement, and they live nearby, so I'll take their word for it.  There was no equal to Daikokuya among any of the ramen places near where I work in San Jose.  Kumiko in Japantown, Kahoo in Santa Clara, all very average.  \n\nI usually order chashu with tonkotsu broth as a measuring stick for a new ramen spot.  If they can't do that right, I won't try anything else.  Served in a sleek black bowl with a long curling spoon, the noodles were buried deep under shaved green onion, a broth-infused hard boiled egg, soft bamboo shoots and ample slices of pork, though not grade A as far as tenderness.  The temperature was perfect; at other places, sometimes I feel as though I burn my tongue right off the bat, and have to wait 5-10 minutes before I can try it again.  \n\nDespite a few minor imperfections with the rest of the dish, the tonkotsu (pork) broth was Daikokuya good, but a tad lighter on the pork flavor which could actually be an improvement.  A perfectly-sized portion for me and my friends, not too much as many places tend to serve.  Granted, I had about 4 pieces of the deftly fried chicken karaage.  Genki gets my stamp of approval, and henceforth is to be known as the Daikokuya of the North, without the hour-long wait.", "author": "Danny K."}

The first time I had genki was for delivery...I was sick, and since my family lives on the other side of the country I had no one I could convince to make me chicken noodle soup.  But luckily I was dating someone, for like a minute, who decided the next best thing to homemade chicken noodle soup was to order ramen, sit in a t-shirt and underwear (his idea) on the couch, watch a bad movie, and de-sickify.  I don't know if it was the guy...who was kind of a catch, the sitting in our underwear, the movie, or the ramen...but it was exactly what the doctor ordered. The ramen came quickly, it was cheapish, there was a ton of soup and the ramen was pretty brothy and plain...which is what I wanted.  he ordered some breaded chicken thing (which now I believe to be chicken katsu, though at the time i couldn't care less)...and it was yummy.\n\nThis weekend a girlfriend and I decided to go for ramen.  It was the residual effects of two days of yucky foggy rain that came to san francisco earlier in the week but we were craving ramen...iT didn't matter that it was now four days later and super warm...\n\nGenki is located in the inner richmond, easy enough to get to, parking not too bad...like 5 tvs....their happy hour prices for beer was 3.00....(or 12 for a pitcher) had a free app on yelp...which was kind of awesome because it was this crispy fishcake spinach thing that there is no way in hell i'd ever order, but since it was free we tried it..and I'd probably order it again...\n\nThen the heavenly bowls of goodness arrived...I got the boiled pork ramen, which was pretty amazing...The egg perfect, the broth tasty...but the pork itself had no flavor and sort of tasted like turkey...and my friend got the beef ramen which was good too despite the pieces that were a little too cartiledgy...\n\nThe lose a star because it seriously took them 15 minutes to even come to our table and take any orders...luckily they gave us happy hour beer prices even though at that point it had ended...", "author": "Kierstan G."}

The ramen was cooked well, not too mushy and with a bite. The broth was good, however nothing to rave about, missing the wow-factor that some ramen places have, like Santouka in LA, or Totto in NYC. By wow-factor I mean after having a taste of the broth and receiving a few flavors on your tastebuds, but as you let the broth linger more tastes come about out of no where. That's the wow-factor. The chasu was pretty flavorful and wasn't too lean nor fatty which is good. The soysauce egg was definitely soysauced. \n\nWhat will bring me back to this place is that they actually make decent takoyaki and okonomiyaki. The takoyaki was fresh, the batter wasn't too watery and there was a decent size portion of octopus inside of it. I appreciate how there was the right amount of okomi sauce, mayo, bonito flakes and ginger slices. The okonomiyaki was good too, ordered the one with beef.

Looking around the restaurant, there were lots of people like us with dissatisfied expressions on their face as they sat at their tables with no food.\n\nIt appears as if they have a small kitchen here which is probably part of the problem, and they've decided to prioritize takeout overs over customers that dine there.

However, when you advertise that you can make \"vegetarian broth\" for ramen, you'd expect that you can have a vegetarian meal at Genki Ramen. Apparently that is not a possibility.\n\nFor the lunch combo you can get gyoza with your meal. On their menu they have both regular and vegetarian gyoza, however, for the lunch menu you can only order the pork gyoza with your vegetarian meal. How does this make any sense?\nEven when I pointed it out to the server, she just looked at me and said \"you can have the pork, not the veggie one.\" \n\nThe ramen is fine, veggies for the veggie ramen are crunchy and fresh.

First, we ordered two ramens, one kim-chi ramen, and one curry katsu ramen.\n\nThe kim-chi ramen was so underflavored that it tasted like a normal miso ramen with a few kim-chi cabbage leaves thrown it.  Even then, the broth was watered down and ended up tasting like salty water.  Truly disappointing - 1 star.\n\nThe curry katsu ramen that my girlfriend, who is Japanese, got had a well done chicken katsu on top but suffered from the same sad fate as my kim-chi ramen in that there was a spoonful portion of curry that just diluted into the watered down broth so it tasted nothing like curry.  When she asked the waiter to get more curry, the waiter tried to charge us $4 for a cup of curry that should have been in the ramen in the first place.  We had to argue with her to finally get her to get us a cup of curry to \"fix\" the ramen.  1-star.\n\nFor a ramen place that seeks to evoke authentic Japanese cooking, Genki utterly fails.

Disappointed might be a better word, actually.\n\nWe were in the neighborhood yesterday around 2 PM starving and looking for something not too terribly unhealthy to eat. We saw this place, checked out the menu and decided it looked good.\n\nThe best I can say is that it wasn't terrible. My husband had veggie yakisoba; the noodles were tasty, but the (lunch) portion was on the smaller side, and there just weren't really many veggies in it. The menu said there was asparagus in it, which was a big selling point for him, but there was no asparagus in it at all. The veggies that were there were diced so fine or shredded that it was like no veggies at all almost. He was hoping for some big chunks of vegetables, since there was no meat. I don't know if the dinner-sized portions are significantly bigger, but I do know that he left kind of hungry. And while it wasn't super pricey, it also wasn't cheap enough to merit leaving hungry.\n\nI had the kimoko (?) mushroom ramen. I did like the flavor of mine and the texture of the different mushrooms, and overall enjoyed eating it. However, as with my husband's, the portion size was just a little too small for the price. Again, maybe it is because it was the lunch portion, but at Hotei down the street from our house you can get a bowl of ramen twice the size for the same price or even less, at any time of day. Plus Hotei has more variety of noodles, etc.\n\nI got the gyozas with the ramen for $1 extra (part of the lunch special) and they were OK but nothing to write home about...not to mention being very, very small. I was glad to get them but also glad that I only paid $1 for them.\n\nFinally, what really made the experience pretty \"meh\" was the service. I hate to badmouth people and I don't give many negative reviews in general, but the service really left much to be desired. No one was rude or anything, but it took a good 10 minutes or so before anyone came to our table to take our order (even a drink or appetizer order), and we were starving; when we were ready to go, it took a while to catch the waitress's eye to get our check, and then it took forever for her to come pick up our card, so much that we were scrambling to find cash so we could just leave...and it was around 2:30-3:00 on a Monday afternoon, there were a couple of tables in the restaurant but I would hardly say they were busy, and I saw the waitresses standing around, so there was really no excuse. And again, no one was rude, but there was a very blase attitude going on there...a general I-don't-give-a-shit attitude.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't go back.

The baked scallops are *very* hot when they come out, I would suggest putting them on your plate as soon as possible so they don't overcook in the mini cast iron skillet. They had a tasty garlic flavor. The lamb chop was so good, I forgot it was lamb. I usually hate the texture of lamb, but they cooked it to tender perfection and it lacked all traces of the slightly icky aftertaste I've had all the previous times I've had lamb. Finally the ramen, I thought the corn ramen combo would be weird, but the sweetness of the corn was a welcome balance to the slight saltiness of the broth.The only thing that could've made the ramen better is if I had remembered to request a hard boiled egg with it and if the chicken karaage had had a little more taste (it was missing a slight sweetness and a tad more salt).\n\nThe service isn't bad but it isn't spectacular either. They're pretty anxious to take your order, but then pretty much forget about you till you request the check.\n\nI need to come back here to try the assortment of appetizers and other snacks on the menu. Thanks for another great suggestion JL!", "author": "Dani D."}

Being that there are so few ramen shops in Sam Francisco, it is one of the few people eat at (and usually remember).\n\nBefore coming here, I've already been here a couple of times. Although I've never been impressed (since they've never had the WOW factor), they have never done that badly with their food. \n\nAmbiance - Very chillax. Definitely not the best \"restaurant\" mood. Being surrounded by like six TVs, the dark lighting and loud chatter screamed restaurant/bar like atmosphere. \n\nService - Good job Genki Ramen! (for an Asian place!) There were multiple female waitresses that were constantly checking up on us and asking us if we needed anything. But most importantly, they were able to keep our water glasses pretty much filled - I'd say this is by far one of their more impressive factors. \n\nThe food came out pretty fast, which was nice. I got the Katsu Curry Ramen, my sister got the Chashu Ramen, and her husband got the Chicken Yakisoba. [Just a heads up: Genki's may only have decent food, but they ARE one of the only few places that sell Japanese delicacies such as okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc among the myriad of sushi restaurants in SF.] \n\nI was pleased with my food, it was a nice balance of crunchy Katsu, and rich curry soup.

I suppose if I'm desperate for Ramen RIGHT there, and the buses are all broken, my car is unavailable and my legs are too tired to walk to Japantown...maybe.\n\nCame here with a bunch of friends on a cold SF day (really, what day isn't?).  Figured Ramen is a good choice because its warm, right?? My friend suggested Genki...and since I've never been but pass it all the time, I figure sure.  Now I realize its an experience I didn't really need to have.\n\nWe came in to a half-empty restaurant. The waitress told us to follow her and we did...to a table that was dirty. And we were like...ok.  She takes the time to clean it and shove the ajoining table together.  But we're standing in the walk way totally taking up room. Would have just been better if they cleaned it then asked us over.\n\nWe look at the menu's provided, and after deciding, we close the menus...with everyones menu's closed, its a clear sign we're ready to order. They didn't catch the hint.  In fact, a couple walked in AFTER us, and got their orders taken BEFORE us. I had to wave a waitress down. Points off.\n\nWe all order our foods. I got Chasu Ramen, and changed to Miso base for no extra charge (yay!).  BUT. Our orders came really far apart from one another. Weirdly, the first and the last order she took down was the first to come. One other came 5 minutes later. And 5 minutes after that, my order and my friends order came last.  Points off.\n\nFood-wise, its average.  The soup base had little flavor.  Maybe it was just me.  Portion and size wise, it was average.  The ramen was a good consistency.  Size was perfect for average hunger.\n\nI think if the waitstaff was better, I'd give it a 3 at least. Food was really average.  If I wanted good ramen, I'd trek to Santa.

The crispy sushi turned out to be an over priced elegantly placed deep fried spring roll. Chicken wings were meh... The appetizer selection was extremely limited and pretty pricey if you are not there for happy hour.\n\nHappy hour is from 3PM to 6PM and from 10PM till close.\n\n\nThe Food:\n\nSo most of us ordered the Rib Ramen in which the majority of the rib was bone. The broth was not all that good. Some what flavorful but seemed not as hearty or thick as other places. There is NO option to customize the ramen. What I mean is that if you want them to \"hold the green onions\" the answer is NO. One of our friends asked and it just wasn't possible... not sure why. Obviously requesting the egg in the ramen to be half cooked would be too much for them. There is however, a good amount of ramen selection.... but I don't think they are authentic Japanese style ramen. (Prob. Thai, with all those curry broths.)\n\n\nThe Service:\n\nIt was a bit hard waving someone over to get the order, not sure why. They were not understaffed.

Genki offers a large selection of Ramens and other dishes. Judging from their most popular chashu ramen we would say it's a decent 3.5 star Ramen house.\n\nThe broth had good flavor but was a little on the lite side.  \nThe noodles were slightly overdone. (it said on the menu that noodles are served medium but they were a little on the softer side)  \nThe broiled pork meat was better then average and had a lot of good pork flavor.\n\nA major plus was the price of the lunch combo.  For two dollars cheaper you get the same amount of Ramen given in a regular order with the addition of fried rice, gyoza, or fried chicken.  We wouldn't recommend the fried rice.  It's not that it was bad but it's wasn't what we were expecting.  It kind of had the yakisoba seasoned taste which is something we don't really prefer.

Still, \"Ogenki desu ka? Hai, genki desu!\" is one of the few exchanges I learned somewhere along the way. Are you fine? Yes, I am fine!\n\nOn its own, \"genki\" means health, happiness, and in good spirits. Genki is a state of being. Unsurprisingly, genki also pops up in a lot of restaurants (since who doesn't like to eat?)--ie, Genki Crepes on Clement, Genki Sushi in Hawaii, and of course, Genki Ramen. For me, ramen indeed is one of those things in life that simply does make me quite, quite genki.\n\nAt Genki Ramen, the ramen's ok. Not the best, but still capable of channeling genki.\n\nPlus points for a lot of choices, from standard char siu to spicy mabo tofu. I tried the beef stew ramen recently (which is more like \"stewed beef\") and the fatty meat was packed with flavor. My problem with Genki's ramen is that it's kind of boring. The broth is pretty good, but they don't really garnish it with much. Though I'm pretty sure the ramen all falls under 10 bucks, I don't think the prices quite match up to what you get (or, what you don't)--I'd love it to see them a wee bit cheaper (of course, I'm the biggest cheapskate ever so I'm not sure if this is helpful).\n\nIn addition to ramen, they have yakisoba (fried noodles) and okonomiyaki (eggy floury pancake full of yummy things). For a good deal and something different, go for the seafood okonomiyaki topped with ramen noodles and bonito flakes--*nom nom nom*.\n\nMy other slight beef with Genki is that the service tends to be really slow. But I'm pretty sure it's because it's one of those places where Asian kids come and chill out foreverrrrrrrr and never leave (I think the plasma tv screens and the trendy interior have something to to do with it).

In the end it's always based largely on my personal preference for the soup base, then comes the less important stuff like the actual texture of the ramen, the ingredients and the price of all the extras I want to add into it. My fave soup base is easily spicy garlic miso or tonkatsu... so when you don't offer that, you're out of the running for 5 stars in my book.\n\nI went with the curry tonkatsu ramen based on yelp reviews while my sister got the chasu ramen - no extras. Got the free side dish of chicken karaage. The large piece of tonkatsu was super crispy and hot... pretty damn good! Noodles were soft and chewy to my liking. I thought the soup base was really good at first, but it must've been the curry flavor mixed in with the red ginger that got to me towards the end. I felt sick after eating it and I didn't even have that much ramen in my bowl.\n\nAfter tasting my soup, I could barely taste the soup flavor in my sister's bowl. She said it was good, but she does favor the milkier soup bases a la Daikokuya over, for example, Ramen Dojo's. Don't be fooled though, it was a lot less flavorful than Daikokuya's tonkatsu base. Her chasu was the kind I like - part fat, part moist meat.\n\nThe chicken karaage reminded us of Popeye's chicken strips... same batter except it was dark instead of white meat. It arrived with the sauce drizzled on top but it wasn't enough! Nothing special. If it wasn't free, I wouldn't have ordered it. \n\nEh. If I were in the area and was really craving ramen, maybe I'd come back and try the garlic tenderous rib one.

We were just looking for a random place to eat close to 3pm on a Sunday.  We were just talking about how we both want to go to San Mateo to eat ramen and that we can never get in because we go when the restaurants are closed for vacation or we arrive during the off-peak hours when they happen to be closed.  So it was rare to see a ramen place open between 2 and 5pm.\n\nLuckily, 3pm is when Happy Hour starts here and there was hardly a crowd at all inside so we were seated right away.  In addition, the lunch menu is good 7 days a week until 5pm.  They have a good selection of food on their menu.  You can get the lunch special ramen for about $7.95  and add a side dish for just $1 more.  That would be 2 gyozas or 2-3 pieces of chicken karage.  We asked how big the happy hour size was for the same dishes, she said it was a little bigger so we opted for happy hour portions.  The two of us ordered way too much food.  They gave us 6 gyoza, and a whole plate of karage for just $3 a dish.  Not bad for the size.  We also ordered the croquettes- 2 McDonald's hash brown sized croquettes on a plate.\n \nI ordered the chasu ramen that comes with the basic tonkatsu broth and my friend ordered the kimchi ramen.  We both liked our ramen.  There was a good amount of chasu that was soft enough that it fell apart easily but was not overcooked.  It comes with an egg and a ton of green onions and bamboo.  I would have to say it was very flavorful.  Not too salty and not overcooked.  I probably finished all the broth.  I was pretty impressed considering we had no expections for this place.\n\nWe ended up with quite a big of leftovers since the chicken karage appetizer was a good size.  Though sometimes my stomach is not  fully satisfied after eating ramen, I didn't feel jipped by portion sizes here at all.  I was so full that I couldn't even eat anything else for the rest of the night.  I will definitely return.  In fact, I almost returned the next day but decided to wait just a little bit.

Genki Ramen is what you'd typically expect at any ramen place. Not terribly expensive and not terribly overpriced. There is a wide variety of items though. I ended up getting the chicken karaage ramen and my friend got chicken katsu. The chicken karaage apparently comes separately with your ramen so you get an entree and an appetizer all in one. The karaage had a weird chalky taste to it. Overall, this place is good if you're looking for a quick bite to satisfy your hunger.", "author": "Amy J."}

The menu is huge, which makes it convenient to eat there in a group since there's something for everyone.\n\nI had a bowl of the chicken karaage ramen. The chicken came on its own plate on the side, which I appreciated because that meant you could keep the chicken very crispy. The chicken was really nicely deep fried so that it was crunchy without seeming greasy. The one negative was that the pieces were sort of pink inside, which I don't think was a mistake but turned me off a little bit. Additionally, I think I ordered the ramen as a combo or something, so it also came with a generous side bowl of chashu/pork fried rice. OMG.

I previously had never seen him without his gear on.  He looks quite impressive from the back.  Slurp.  Yum.  I'm talking about the ramen, of course.\n\nWe decided to share a bowl of ramen because the menu had too much stuff to try.  Since my initial encounter with spicy miso tofu kimchi ramen was meh, I recommended the mushroom ramen.  It turned out to be delicious with succulent slices of trumpet mushrooms, button mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and one symbolic shiitake mushroom.  The broth was greatly improved from last time.  It was flavorful and not too salty.  A liberal sprinkling of red pepper powder and a drizzle of oil chili oil brightened my eyes and turned on the nose faucet.  \n\nThe sesame wings were bleh.  Overly sweet and glazed.  Nothing special.  I was really craving some dry chicken wings.  Salt and pepper with some slices of jalapeno.  Not glazed, tossed, drowned, sugar-coated.  And there were only 4 wings.  For $6.  I think it was not worth it.  I need to start looking for those places that have happy hour wings for $0.50.  WHERE ARE MY PEOPLE?  The WING PEOPLE?\n\nSquid tentacles.  Delicious as always.  I love the chewy texture.  It's more tender than the dried squid snacks but more firm that poorly fried calamari rings.  BTW, does anyone else get suspicious when calamari comes only with rings?  Where have the wiggly bits gone?  This dish was only the wiggly bits.  \n\nLamb Chop robata - Marina loved it.  I passed on it and ate the shiitake mushroom skewer instead.\n\nShiitake mushroom robata - Tender, flavorful, over-sauced.  The glaze was a bit thick.  I like just a hint of seasoning.  More smokey than sweet.\n\nAnd....that's it!  $28 dinner for two girls.  The last half of the Jets-Broncos game.

I just want to say beforehand that my low rating is based on the food that I ordered and not the establishment itself since I have never dined in. This could be a charming place for all I know, but regardless the food that I ordered was sub-par. But in all fairness I would still sit down and eat at this place just to give it a shot. Maybe it was just the food I ordered.\n\nFirst I want to applaud Genki Ramen for adopting such an easy to use online ordering system. Pick your food from the menu and pay with a credit card online. Simple and easy. I wish all delivery places had a system like this.\n\nNow on to the food. For starters my roommate and I had the Pumpkin & Yam Tempura and the Baked Scallops. The tempura was soggy and incredibly oily. This could have been result of us ordering take out and not eating it fresh at the restaurant. Regardless the pieces were also cut really small. The Baked Scallops on the other hand were pretty delicious. Those scallops were pretty tiny, but the garlic butter it is cooked in made up for it.\n\nI also ordered the Seafood Yakisoba. This was pretty bad. The noodles were pretty bland and incredibly greasy. I had to add soy sauce to give this dish flavor. In my opinion if food tastes good you don't need to add anything extra to it. This was not the case here. The seafood pieces were small and mostly imitation crab. My roommate ordered the Curry Tonkatsu rice plate. The curry itself and the katsu cutlets were pretty good. But the entire dish is made up of mostly just rice.\n\nThe food we ordered was not very good. Despite its poor showing, I would still give Genki Ramen one more chance.

I actually went to 4 places, but only 2 were open, Sapporo-Ya, and Genki Ramen.\n\nGenki was my last spot, it was MLK Day and the parking on the street was not free, it is SF and guess no holidays are free in the city. I ran into the restaurant and asked if I could break a $1. I only had $1 in cash and was planning on using my credit card to pay for food. $1 for parking is only good for 30 mins, so I asked if I would be able to get a bowl of ramen and consume it in 30 mins. The waitress said, \"oh yeah you will\".\n\nI got my change and paid the meter. I went back into the restaurant and sat down, made a quick glance at the menu and ordered the Chicken Karaage Ramen.\n\nI loved how the Chicken Karaage was on it's own plate, not dropped into the ramen bowl. The chicken was really crispy and tender. The broth was tasty, not too salty, and was a bit spicy (the way I like it).\n\nWhen I finished the bowl, paid, and went back to my car, there was still 9 minutes left on the meter. Genki had some fast service, and the ramen was great.\n\nBetween Sapporo-Ya and Genki, Genki wins my vote.", "author": "Alen K."}

Granted I've only tried about 5 different places thus far, but Genki is currently my favorite.  \n\nI enjoyed lunch here with the coworkers on a rainy day in June (that really shouldn't be allowed in California...rain in June that is).  3 of us got ramen, one got yakisoba, and one tried miso soup and octopus.  \n\nI opted for the basic chashu ramen, to see if this place was legit.  First of all, the soup came with 4 slices of pork, the most I've been given with a standard order of ramen.  Other accouterments included the obligatory boiled egg, bamboo shoots, scallions.  The broth was a meat base, and while not kicked up with anything, still not bland, and currently one of my favorite basic broths.  The noodles too were more ideal than others I've had.  The right size, consistency, and taste.  \n\nPerfect rainy day ramen.  Now, in terms of more exciting flavors, they have a lot to offer here, but none that stood out to me as being really unique.  I still need to try more ramen places in the city, since I know there are better ones out there, but so far, this is the only place I'd gladly come back to and order ramen from again.  \n\nPlus they have such a huge variety on the menu, you can satisfy pretty much anyone's tastes in your party.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

It's not too salty but definitely has enough flavor, so I kept slurping it up. Noodles were on the tender side of chewy, but I still liked it. Slices of pork (I ordered the Chasu Ramen) were big, and they gave me half a soy sauce egg with the scallions and bamboo shoots.\n\nI should talk about the egg.

This is excellent. It means I'm free to order whatever type of ramen I want and still get the egg.\nEnd discussion of egg.\n\nWe also had two robatayaki items: chicken gizzard and saba. The saba was huge and not on a skewer. You get a whole half of fish. Value! It's covered in the same sweet sauce you get on unagi, which was surprisingly good with mackerel. Gizzards were kinda tough (they're gizzards, wasn't expecting tenderness).

After having the chashu dish for sometime, however, I felt like there was some weird funky odor or taste to it so I started to order the beef ramen. Other favorite dishes that I love ordering from here is the croquette and especially the grilled ika yaki!!! Whenever I can find grilled squid, I try my best to get my hand on it! Although it's almost $10, I feel like it's so worth it because it's grilled just right and isn't dried out or hard or anything.

We were sitting at some other restaurant a few weeks ago and sat down and she looked around and said, \"Hey! This is not my favorite restaurant - Genki Ramen!\"\n\nAnyway, A and I were in the mood for some soupy noodles one rainy Saturday afternoon so we headed over to try the niece's favorite restaurant.  It was about 1pm and fairly empty.  Only about 3 tables were occupied, so we were seated super quick.  We ordered two grilled onigiri as an appetizer and then I got the beef curry ramen while A got the kimchi ramen.\n\nThe grilled onigiri is so good!  It has unagi in it and the grilling is just perfect.  Nice and brown and crispy on the outside, while soft and yummy on the inside.  A has been dying to go back just to order some more onigiri for snacks!  My beef curry ramen was just right.  You could taste the curry, but it didn't ruin the taste of the broth or alter my ramen.  It hit the spot.  And A really liked his kimchi ramen.\n\nSo, even though we had doubts because it's a 4-yo's favorite restaurant, I'm pretty sure we'll be back.

One of the orders was to go since one of us was not very hungry.   The ramen seems ok--though it seems to be better before.  The prices, likewise, seem to be about a dollar higher per order than before as well.    And the service was hardly exceptional--basically, they provided you with glasses of water and served you the food when it was ready.  The waiter/waitress never bothered to refill your cup or provide you any additional service.  In other words, the service was mediocre to below average.   Therefore, I was shocked when a gratuity amounting to 18% was written into the bill.  And the waiter that provided that bill with the 18% gratuity wasn't even the one who took our order or served our food.  Needless to say, I complained about the 18% gratuity because there were only five in our party and there was no mention that a gratuity would automatically be charged to a party of five.  It seems that the waiter just made that the decision of 18% on his own for mediocre service which was not even worthy of a 10% gratuity let alone an 18% one.  \n\nBecause I complained about it, he took some time before he returned my change.  I guess he thought I was right--that the \"basic service\" of putting our food on the table and providing us each with exactly one glass of tap water was not worthy of a 18% gratuity.  Therefore, he brought it down to a 16% gratuity instead!  I guess for this \"waiter\"--bringing food to a patron and giving them a glass of tap water is to him--superior--\"A+\" service.  \n\nI don't think we will be coming back to this ramen joint anytime soon again.  The food is ok but the service is mediocre to below average but they want to be paid with a gratuity of 18%.   Please note that a gratuity is left for you if you provide good service only--we are not your employer--just your patron.  Your employer is responsible for paying you your wages--not the patron.  And if you want a worthy gratuity--learn to provide better service.", "author": "Sharmagne A."}

A choice of a free chicken karaage or nasu gomaae for appetizer. For a free dish, it's pretty huge.\n\nWhat I really liked about this place is the full bar and that they offer free delivery. I also enjoyed the lounge-y sort of feel of the place and that they're tuned into ESPN on their many large flat panel screens.\n\nIf the place is busy, it's going to be hard to find seats for groups of four or more so plan ahead and make a reservation. Luckily, I never come out to the city with that many people.\n\nBack to the food, the fried stuff is good - Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, Katsu, Chicken Karaage, etc. They're very crispy and flavourful on the inside. The ramen, however, is just mediocre. There really is not anything special about their ramen because there are definitely better places in the area that serve ramen. The Hiyashi is just alright too; I wish they had the hot mustard for it. What I found amazing was that they had Creme Brulee on the menu, so I had to order it - can never go wrong with Creme Brulee.\n\nThis place is great if you just wanna run to somewhere to eat some quick Japanese.

The tonkatsu broth had a good taste, but was also a bit thin compared to many of the other ramen places.  The beef ribs in the soup were delicious though!  \n\nMy wife had the tempura ramen, but she didn't love her miso broth.  We also felt that they skimped on the noodles, so we had to order an extra side of noodles.  The noodles were cooked right though, and they had a good texture to them.  The chicken karaage we saw at many other tables look delicious, and we'll probably have to try them next time, as well as one of the curries probably.", "author": "Pilan C."}

I normally get the seafood ramen. It's filling and its good. It has fake crab, shrimp, scallop, mussel, fish cake in miso base. I normally get it with some spice (which is just a chili paste on the side of the bowl). \n\nI also get the garlic tenderous rib and that's pretty good. The meat is very tender and just is tasty and delicious. \n\nA lot of people complain about it being overly salty. I, however, am a fan of salty foods and therefore, have no issues at all with the soup. Miso is salty anyway isn't it -- add other contents that naturally contain sodium and that's probably why. \n\nI also get an order of short ribs, oily, tasty goodness and cheap for a nice teaser appetizer. \n\nOh and for drinks, I love their maccha swirl. If you like any green tea drinks, you'll like this! mMm...\n\nAnd now for the exceptions. They charge for you to make your broth spicy. How silly is that?! And their service is VERY spotty.

I fiend for green onions, and was slightly disappointed at what their definition of \"a lot\" was.\n\nThe broth was basically hot soy sauce, and caused my body to immediately scream in thirst.

It felt so good to dig into a bowl of steaming hot ramen. I ordered the chicken karaage ramen and I was amazed at the texture and flavor of the ramen and broth. The noodles tasted so fresh and it was cooked to perfection--not too soggy, not too hard. It had the most amazing flavor and the broth was just superb. It was definitely something to remember--I can't wait to come back here to eat the ramen again and try some of the other delicious looking items on the menu! Next time though, I'll probably try the other ramens. The chicken karaage is deep fried chicken nugget so the first few bites were good, but after having it soak in the broth, it just becomes a little too greasy for my taste. But oh my gosh, I'm in love with their ramen!!\n\nI came here with a group of friends for someone's birthday and we did sake bombs. This seemed like a nice chill family-friendly place so when we did sake bombs, we got A LOT of stares in the restaurant.

I need comfort food and when I crave for some soupy dish, I think of ramen. Genki Ramen is one of those places that you know will satisfy your ramen taste buds. \n\nThe ambiance is Asian contemporary and hip. There are a ton of TVs that decorate the place and a huge TV right above the kitchen. A small bar that serves various sake drinks is carefully situated on the right side of the restaurant. This place can be a sports bar if it wanted to! This is another reason why I like coming here is that I get to eat ramen and watch a game. Tonight was the Giants and Red Sox! Go Giants!\n\nI always get either the chicken karaage ramen with tonkatsu base soup or the butter and corn ramen with the miso soup. Of course the karaage is the least healthy but it is my favorite. When I want lots of meat, I go for that. They give you a decent amount of chicken karaage that is served on the side to prevent it from getting soaked in the broth. Nice job. If I crave for corn, I go for butter and corn. It is fantastic with the miso base soup and the flavored boiled pork. EB usually gets the beef stew ramen. He loves it!! Although he has been noticing that they have been giving him fattier meat which I don't usually mind. However, I have to deduct a star because of the inconsistency with the meat and occasionally the broth flavor and amount. Ramen is decent and does not get soggy after a few minutes.\n\nThe bonus part of the meal is the Hi-Chew candy that is given to you when you get your check. Awesome!!!!\n\nService can be spotty but is usually quick.\n\nAgain, a great place to have comfort food and watch TV....almost like home.", "author": "Molly T."}

She rolls her eyes and walks away.\n\nFinally, we get the check.  I usually never check but today, I did.  Guess what?!?

I told her about it and she said \"you ordered the brown rice separately with a heavy accent,\" (in a very demeaning tone.)  I said, NO.

It looked and sounded like a lounge/club with the dimly lit lights, TV screens, and chill beats playing over the speakers. Indeed, I might have entered a Ramen Lounge, something I expected to find in Los Angeles or New York and not in San Francisco.\n\nThe modern vibe of the restaurant reflects itself on the menu. There were non-traditional types of Ramen aside from more traditional Japanese items like Okonomiyaki, Rice Dishes, Yakisoba, and grilled Meat Skewers.\n\nGenki Ramen has a promotion lasting until the end of the month of March where you can get a FREE order of Crispy Daimaru or Edamame with your meal. I started off with the Crispy Daimaru that comes with 3 disc-shaped fried dumplings with a sweet sauce on the side. These are filled with cheese, fish cake, and spinach. When I bit into the center, the cream cheese filling was soft and oozing out. I probably won't order this normally, but it was worth trying. \n\nFor my main order I decided to try their Spicy Mabo Tofu Ramen, which consisted of stir fried spicy soft silken tofu and minced pork in a Tonkatsu base. I really enjoyed the flavor of the dish and it really packed a spicy punch. I wasn't particularly fond of the ramen noodles though. They just didn't have enough springiness to them and I found they were slightly overcooked. On the side, my server also provided me with a small dish of pickled vegetables. \n\nI commend Genki Ramen for delivering new variations on the traditional ramen. On the other hand, I just wasn't very keen on the noodles in my dish. A great thing to note about Genki is that they accept credit cards and provide Green Apple Hi-Chew with your check!", "author": "Jason H."}

It was the perfect weather for ramen, cold and rainy, and I'm sure the other people at the restaurant would agree as this was the first time I ever had to wait for a table during lunch.  The wait wasn't longer than 10 minutes so I can't complain.  There are many televisions located throughout the restaurant making the time pass by quickly, especially if your favorite sports team is playing.  The ambiance and dim lighting also make it great for a lunch date.\n\nI ordered my usual Curry Chicken Katsu Ramen and my friend ordered the Chicken Karaage Ramen.  There is nothing better than a hot bowl of ramen to warm you up on a day like this, and that is just what it did.  The noodles were cooked to perfection, not too soggy like some other places and the broth was neither too salty nor too oily, which I love.  I recommend getting the katsu on the side so it doesn't get soggy from the broth.  \n\nThe best part about coming at lunch is that you can get the combo, which is ramen plus one side of either 2 pieces of gyoza, chicken karaage, or chahan (pork fried rice) for just a dollar more.  I opted not to get the combo this time knowing that the ramen would be more than enough for me.  Our total bill came out to less than $16, which I find decent for a ramen place.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Genki Ramen to anyone looking for something to eat on a cold day.  I would have given the restaurant 5 stars if it weren't for the service.  The waitress seems to forget about you after you order and don't remember you until you request the check.

I would recommend taking the 38 MUNI bus, which goes straight onto Geary. I'm pretty sure there is a stop very close to the store. \n\nComing in, the restaurant is dark and dim - something that annoys me. I can't stand eating at a restaurant with dim ambiance because it makes me want to fall asleep, and I can barely see the people across the tables. The brightest light comes from the kitchen, which is flanked by glass windows so customers can watch their bowls being made while waiting for the bathroom. \n\nThe restaurant is split up into two ramps, with a higher ramp leading to booths for larger groups and the floor for smaller (2 people) groups. The decor is nice, but again, hard to tell because the restaurant is dark. \n\nThere is a TV on the right side of the restaurant, which can be viewed if you are on the booth side on the higher ramp. The \"booths\" are parallel to the wall, meaning there are booth-like seats on the wall side, but seats on the other side of the table facing the wall. It's quite a problem because the tables of different parties are really close together, so if you are on the booth side, it will be difficult to get out to go to bathroom.\n\nThe ramen is tasty, but a little on the expensive side. The bowls are a little heavy, and the portions are not enough to fill. There is a large variety of items to add with your ramen, and the dishes are around $10. Appetizers are about half the price and bite-size to say the most. I ordered the kabobs and tongue, and wasn't too impressed with either.

I couldn't make the drive to Santa Ramen so I looked up ramen places in SF and found Genki Ramen.\n\nThe place was packed but we managed to get a table in the back. Everyone in our group ordered a different bowl of ramen. I was so excited and overwhelmed to see they had a lot of variety in their ramen, including vegetarian ramen. I ordered the garlic rib ramen with spicy miso added and some extra toppings.\n\nThis was everything I hoped it would be. Salty, rich, spicy, and hearty. It was so good, I force fed myself to finish all of it when I was full. The garlic pork rib was so amazingly tender and delicate. The noodles were the perfect consistency and the broth was delicious. Even my favorite ramen places tend to oversalt their broth on occasion, but this seemed just right. Hopefully they're consistent with their broth.\n\nEveryone in my group enjoyed their ramen of choice, even the vegetarians. I'm so happy I found this place.

The Delivery guy shows up even later and asks about getting a tip. I informed him that he was very late and I was not at all happy about that, and he goes 'Whatever it's your call.' and walks away before I am done talking to him. I try to give him what cash I have on hand as a tip, I get the bill out and go for the coins, and he gives me attitude and refuses it before I can even get the coin pouch of my wallet open. It wasn't much yeah but that was just rude. Is it crazy to be upset when your food is late compared to what you're told to expect?! I mean I know that delivery persons work hard and practically live off their tips, but seriously giving me attitude when you're late and my food is lukewarm?!\n\nGenki Ramen, please talk to your delivery staff.

It's a messy dish (they give you a claw cracker and scissors to help) but well worth it at under $13. \n\nThe second time around I sampled the \"Garlic Tenderous Rib\" ramen, which came with pork on the bone (which fell off the bone with ease), sliced roasted garlic, egg and spinach. I'm making myself hungry just typing this. On my third visit, I went against my carnivore inclinations and tried the Kinoko Mushroom ramen, which had several mushroom varieties (Shiitake, Hiratake, Bunashimeji, Eryngii) in a tonkatsu soup.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "I know this is going to sound like a heap of self-loathing on my part, but the main reason for my distaste for Genki Ramen is that the food tastes Korean. The ramen didn't have that milky, fatty, umami-laden goodness you'd expect from the real deal (even at the crummiest of the Japanese-run restos you're bound to get a smidge of it) and the croquettes and katsu were undercrisped and a bit greasy. Operational touches indicated Korean nuances, like the filet used for the katsu that was on the thinner side (as Koreans used to serve it before they caught on to using chop-size cuts like the Js), which I actually prefer, but it just indicates to me that I'm having more of a fusion-y, interpretive experience. What saves this place for me is that they have decent happy hour offerings, and beers are actually quite affordable.\n\nIf I happen to be mistaken and there is, in fact, no Korean involved in the operation of this restaurant, then it is truly my mistake and for that I am sorry. But then again, if this is the case, this is a bunch of Japanese people who just don't know how to make good Japanese food. You tell me which is worse. It doesn't really make a difference for me, since I have bags of Shin Ramen-- what Korea really does well.", "author": "Nuri K."}

It actually has pushed me to do pick up there a lot. Also, I really hate the tvs. I've never been to a ramen spot that has so many (if any) tvs. It's like a saki and ramen sports bar meets a trying-to-be-fancy mall restaurant. \n\nDespite these turn offs, the ramen is quite excellent. In fact, I'm tempted to say it's amongst my favorite (if not my favorite) in the entire city. I haven't read the other reviews for this joint, and maybe other people are put off by the decor, too, but I really don't understand why this place is rated 3 and half stars. It should be at least 4, if not 4 and half, especially in light of the fact that there are not many places in SF to find a consistently good to great bowl of ramen. I've had at least half of the ramen dishes there, and 3/4's of them have been fantastic. Here's a list of my faves: \nSpicy Mabu Ramen - hands down my favorite dish here. I get it about half the time I come. Not gonna leave your mouth on fire, but if you're spice-phobic/ a wuss, I would stay away.\nTan tan, Negi beef, and Shoga Niku are probably my next favorite dishes here. I'm not one who can describe tastes very well, but suffice it to say, these are all excellent, in my opinion. Surprisingly, their Chashu Ramen has never knocked my socks off.\n\nI'd say their Okonomiyaki is really good, and their yakisoba is pretty good. I'll occasionally order one of those dishes to switch it up, but normally I go for the ramen. \n\nTheir Robatayaki is pretty awesome - it's just a little pricey for what you get - however, if you have a couple extra bucks to spend, it's worth trying any one (or more) of their Robatayaki with your Ramen.\n\nOnce again, if the atmosphere were any less obnoxious it would be a hands down 5 stars in my book, but even still, it's one of my favorite Ramen spots in the city.

The noodles are firm, just the way I like it and the broth (so flavorful, I had to resist from drinking the entire thing) was swimming in corn and green onions. \n\nI suppose the other menu options are just as good, but I'm only sticking with the chicken karaage, but honestly, I love it THAT much! My favorite comfort food during the winter... or actually, any time, really. The only drawback is a bit of a salt/MSG kick at the end, but then again, small price to pay for deliciousness. The appetizers are pretty good too. Do come in for the happy hour specials, as appetizers are $3 each!", "author": "Sabrina C."}

The noodles could have had a bit more texture, the broth is decent, the chashu is a bit bland. It's passable, and it probably suffices for lunch, or if you happen to be nearby and really want Ramen. I think in Japan town, there are some better Ramen choices, but Genki is fine.\n\nBut, like I said, try going beyond the Ramen, and explore. The appetizers and grilled items were tasty, especially the ribs. Order a serving per person. They are great.\n\nThings to get:\n* Kim Chi Ramen if you like something with a bit more kick than the Chashu\n* anything with curry\n* a smattering of things off of Robatayaki\n\nService was friendly and helpful, albeit a bit slow for a place that is only half empty for dinner.\n\nDecore for dinner is dimmed, and is a good place for a quiet conversation.\n\nParking can be a bit of a challenge in the area.

However, few weeks ago, I was really disappointed with the service and the food quality.\n\nI came around a day before the president election time. There were 2 lady servers at that time, and 2 lady cook as well. All the TVs channel was airing the debate. I ate alone and would like something else to watch. Even sports is fine.  I requested the server, she gave a me a bit of attitude and changed it. I was like whatever, I'm here for the food. But, how disappointing I was when I got my food. I can taste the broth was very watery and the noodle doesn't have any flavor at all. I informed the other server. Her reaction was, walked away and talk to the cook. She didn't even say \"Sorry,\" or \"Let me check/ask something to someone and I'll be with you shortly.\" No... this is plain rude, walk off, don't care. She then returned to me and said, \"There's nothing wrong with your noodle.\"  Owwkay... I was giving you a constructive feedback, but if you can't take it, that's fine. I'll go eat somewhere else then. And I did. I haven't returned to this place since that time. Even tho it start raining and windy as hell and I'm craving for some ramen. Heck!

I finally found it because I was on the opposite side of the street and was looking for it. The store sign was hiding behind a street post or something. My vision isn't best at night but it wasn't all too bright either. Hrm, when I came in it was a bunch of kids on a weekday so it seems like a hangout of all sorts. there's like flat screen TV's mounted on the walls.. probably about 8-10 of them so wherever you turned you would be watching the same thing on every screen. I'm surprised that they didn't have one that was on the ceiling. D:\n\nFirst waitress sat me at a table closest to the podium. She didn't seem to happy that night but the other waitress that did help me that night was really friendly and she had the decency to smile. I took a little time before ordering to see what was good on the menu. I was... but didn't.. go for the kaki fry... I thought it would have been over my budget but then again I can go to basa at any time for that instead of having it as just an appetizer. Anyways, so I ordered a takoyaki and it it came back to me piping hot... was pretty good and I think I was really happy to get it cause I burnt my tongue eating it D:  next on the list was my okonomiyaki.\nNow, there are two types that I seen before I went to find this somewhat of a beer snack, There's Kansai (which is literally everything mixed up including the batter)\nand then there's Osaka (traditional, which they start off with the batter first and start placeing everything in order... including yakisoba) but Osaka style was the one that I was gearing my stomach towards. Unfortunately, this was more of a Kansai style but they instead had ramen. I swear... I don't think that I got the ramen placed with my Okonomiyaki... I felt a bit cheated but I shrugged it off. Next in line was a Kirin and oh man... when you do have that rich taste of okonomiyaki and the kewpie mayo... you definetely need to balance it out with the beer. After having takoyaki and okonomiyaki I was just about stuffed. I didn't have any room for dessert or anything so I passed. I do have to compliment the second waitress on smiling and being alot happier than the other waitress who seated me though. \n\nLastly, I ordered something to go and I asked the waitress for a suggestion. She immediately pointed out the garlic tenderous spareib that was on the menu... (I was thinking to myself that it was a bit pricey, cause I asked her in between that and another ramen selection) she didn't really give me another option but I got it anyways. However, this time only from the time that I did go to Ebisu to take home sukiyaki it wasn't as disastrous or near disastrous as having the coated paper bowl leak through. They had plastic containers at Genki, thank God...\n\nFinal comments:\n\nAtmosphere is almost like a bar... generally the college type crowd that would hang over here. I'm surprised that they don't have a kareoke showdown here... or something like a 'free ramen' contest on a special day/night. I think that would totally be better. Then of course everybody would be \"Genki\". Most of the waitresses are attentive and will get to you but make sure that they smile because that sets your mood. After all its supposed to be Genki after all...\n\nI don't mind coming here again but I would recommend it to any or all people that are sports fanatics or like to dine by yourself or come in late night with a few friends to hang out.\n\n\nThats it for now guys!!!

We were seated after waiting about 5-10minutes.  They have a good selection of food, ranging from rice dishes, curry, fried noodles, cold noodles, noodle soup, deep fried dishes, and much more.  We decided on getting the pumpkin and squash tempura (because that's all that I eat anyway in the vegetable tempura), the garlic pork ribs ramen, and chicken katsu curry.  \n\nThe noodle broth had a really good flavor, and the pork ribs were similar to the fatty pork at Santa Ramen, however, they only give you 3 pieces with really nothing else... It would have been nice to have at least one more piece of meat or vegetables in it.  The noodles were really good though, nice and chewy.  As for the curry, it was good, but I prefer  Muracci's curry much more.  There was definitely way more rice than actual curry or chicken.  More curry please! Lastly, the tempura came with a lot of pumpkin and squash!  It was pretty good, except that they only give you a TINY dipping bowl with hardly ANY tempura sauce... We had to ask for another one and that still wasn't enough.\n\nOverall, food was good, service was okay... It satisfied my noodle craving, but I am not sure if I would always make this my noodle stop... it would depend on my driving mood/traffic/ and type of noodles i'm craving.", "author": "Diane L."}

So here it goes., \n\nFirst arrive on a Sunday evening at around 6pm, with about 15 customer already dining and 30% of the table fill serve by 6 waiter as I counted.  I was directed to a table promptly by one of the waiter and presented their menu.  After I sat down it's a totally different story,  I was sitting there for over 8 minutes without being approach by any waiter or server even a glass of water to start with.  As I turn around, I turn around, I saw the male water just chatting away by the bar with other waiter and the others just doodling around.  As I try to wave down a server, 3 choose to ignore me as I wave and I finally found one that's actually delivering food and ask her for a glass of water.  As she deliver my water the lazy male server jump in but didn't even greed or said a word, so I just told him what I wanted.  Then, he give a some what under hand look as if, \"OH,. I got your order, Geee,.. \" In a way I felt offended,... Even though the service at this point is enough to drive me out the door but I still hold some hopes with so many decent review... so I've decided to stay hope the ramen that I had order will be the saving grace.  \n\nUnfortunately, the chashu ramen that I've order was a disappointment as well.  The menu stated that all the ramen is in a beef broth, however the broth for this ramen was very weak.  I've had ramen all my life, and found the broth resembling the Safeway 99cens ramen broth. It was weak, thin, without enough grilled onion and simmer of bone in the broth .  The pork loin was cold in the middle, the egg was over cooked  and cold. The only fresh veggies were the green onons. The noodles be your regular yakisoba noodles, that's typical. As soon as you take your last spoon, they take the bowl away. \n\nOverall experience, NOT COMING BACK and I DON'T RECOMMEND IT.

Also a good feature are  the \"extras\" you can add to your ramen, like seaweed, corn, tofu, and extra ramen noodles.\n\nI also really like the veggie gyoza, grilled and freshly assembled in their greasy goodness. The bite of yakisoba I tried was also good, with that \"grill\" taste to the noodles. Some here complain of the \"hardness\" of the noodles.

Our server made minimal screw ups with regard to the splitting of bills (we had a group of 7 and wanted the checks split in strange ways).

They also asked me to return the incorrect food to them (hopefully not to re-deliver - super gross) and said they would get me the correct meal in another 40 minutes (translation: another hour). After waiting an hour, spending 20 minutes trying to get a hold of them and communicate the situation, another 40 minutes to wait seemed sort of ridiculous so I asked to reverse the charge that they had already made on my credit card and they said it would take them 5 days to a week?

I was never a fan of okonomiyaki so I can't say I enjoyed it that much. For those who don't know what okonomiyaki is, it is like a japanese vegetable pancake with chopped cabbage, this is the plain version.

That's when I usually get a craving for ramen, and most specifically, Genki Ramen in the Richmond.  Though Hotei is just a few steps away, we like Genki for its uber-flavourful broths and noodle variations.\n\nTake, for instance, my current ramen of choice - the beguilingly-named \"Garlic Tenderous Rib\" [sic] Ramen: you get with your miso broth and noodles, an almost obscene chunk of melt-in-your-mouth pork rib that tastes like its been stewed for hours (in a sweet-savoury sauce with hints of anise) until the meat and tendons are definitely falling off the bone.  You also get a marinated hard-boiled egg, a smidge of saut\u00e9ed spinach and a savoury sprinkling of fried shallot... leftovers are delicious heated up the next day.  If you feel that the cha-siu pork slices that come with the other ramen options are meager, this particular chunk o' meat won't leave you wanting.\n\nThe husband favours the kimchee ramen as well as the mapo-tofu ramen; I also like their butter corn ramen.

Funny thing is that I'm not even a huge ramen fan. Santa Ramen in San Mateo has come close, but doesn't quite compare. After searching through various lists of ramen joints in the Bay Area, it seemed that Genki Ramen got pretty good reviews all around. It was close to my final destination that evening, so I figured I would give it a shot.\n\nThe atmosphere at Genki is pretty contemporary. It's dimly lit, decorated with lots of glass, and has plasma screens in different parts of the restaurant broadcasting Giants games and other sports. As I was a party of 1, I sat at the bar.\n\nSince I've been comparing all ramen places against Daikokuya, I went with the tonkatsu (chashu) ramen, a dish in which the broth contains pork bones, fat, and cartilage that not only gives the broth a rich pork flavor, but also a smooth texture. The ramen was satisfying, but a little underwhelming. The broth was flavorful, but not as smooth. There was a hard-boiled egg, pork, bamboo shoots, and green onion, and that was about it. The noodles were just slightly undercooked, just enough to the point where you find them to be a little overwhelming. The ramen, though, was nice and hot, which was good for after a cold afternoon in the Richmond.\n\nI'd come back if I were in the area again and looking for a place to eat, but I won't declare it my new favorite ramen place.

It's fine I guess, it's just that it doesn't give off that homey vibe that I associate with eating ramen.\n\nGenki Ramen looks pretty fancy through the windows for a ramen place.

I made sure to finish up my entire bowl, even the broth, which is a great sign for taste. I'd like to come back here and try some of their more non-standard ramen.\n\nThey also seem to hype up their curry ramen quite a bit.

I arrived at lunch time with a group of four on a saturday, expecting it to be busy. I was shocked to see that the place was fairly empty. There were at least 5 tables open when we arrived. We waited for a table for about 7 minutes and were asked twice how many in our party, mind you there were a few right in front of us that we open. We sat down and waited for another 10 minutes for a waitress to give us tea or water, but no one came. The only time we ever got someone to come over was when we flagged them down. It took about 15 min after sitting to get our order in for food and drink, and this place is still half empty. When they did take our order they rushed us. It felt like she thought we were the ones taking all day to do anything. When the food came it was decent. the croquets were really good, light, fluffy, and really crispy as well as the fried chicken. They have fried food down to an art. The ramen was ok at best. I got the garlic tenderous rib ramen. The broth was flavourful but the noodles were lacking. the ribs were more bones than meat and the egg was over cooked, the yolk leaving a slight, dry, sandy feel in my mouth. \nWould have been 3 stars but the service leaves a lot to be desired, they should at least refill hot tea for customers, my mom never got hers.

My favorite is the kimchi ramen because the broth is more flavorful.\n\nCame here again with my boyfriend yesterday and we ordered the kimchi ramen and the seafood Okonomiyaki (fried pancake thing).  The ramen came really quickly and we devoured that.  It took them another 5 minutes after that to bring us the Okonomiyaki.  I was all excited and cut into it only to find that it was not the seafood one that we ordered.  Our server took it away, apologized and said they'll remake it.\n\nSo we waited...and waited...and waited.  After about 15 minutes, she apologized for the long wait and gave us a Caramel Milk Tea on the house...which appeased me for a while.  The tea was very floral and tasted like it had jasmine in it (but apparently it's just regular black tea).  Anyway, another 10 minutes pass before our food finally comes.  I would've been really pissed if the pancake was not as delicious as it was (super crispy bottom with lots of veggies and seafood inside ~ yum!).\n\nThey really need to improve their service though (noticed they screwed up the orders for another table as well).  Service is usually pretty slow too...they need to hire more people to work the front and back.\n\nJust a note - has anyone ever played Diner Dash?  Because the whole charade yesterday totally reminded me of that.  I was the hungry customer who was waiting impatiently for my food...getting angrier and angrier by the second.  So then our server (aka Flo in the game) gave us a drink to make me happy again.  Then I get angry again, so they rush to bring me my food and I'm a happy customer again (sort of).

I think it would have tasted better if I ordered the spicy miso like my BF and our other friend did. They seemed to enjoy their soup much better. Ramen noodles were standard, nothing special about it, yet nothing horribly wrong either. \n\nGenki is just an average place. Is it bang for your buck?

Looks like now I get both.\n\nIt's no understatement that there are a multitude restaurants to choose from on Geary, especially in the Avenues.

I'd even place them ahead of my dining expereinces in Japantown.\n\nThe restaurant itself is sleek, stylish and simple, with hardwood floors, dark lacquered tables and chairs, and LCD flatscreen TVs lining the walls and playing JPop music videos. The bar to the right side carries a posh decorum,  and in the back you can see into the kitchen through the plate glass windows.

It was something of a whim, and a pleasant surprise was in store for us. Selecting the curry chicken and chicken ramen entrees, we were first present with tea, and an appetizer of miso soup and a small salad. When the entrees arrived, the portions were massive, filling, and delicious. The broth was delicate and savory, not too salty like many places. The noodles strong, firm and distinct, and the chicken adding well to the bowl without overpowering. The gyoza side was an excellent addition. The whole meal left me feeling full, happy and refreshed. \n\nEven better, our two dishes together and drink cost us under $20 (the girlfriend returned for dinner on a weekday night and the price was slightly higher, though.)

What meal screams manhood and strength?  Noodles.  I should have just gone flower picking instead because that was more masculine than eating noodles.\n\nAnyway, I can only blame myself for demeaning my masculinity by visiting Genki Ramen after \"Beowulf.\"  Seriously though.  Can you imagine Achilles eating noodles?  How about Hercules?  Maybe King Leonidas?  Nope, nope, and nope.  In a vain attempt to reclaim some of my broken masculinity, I ordered the seafood yakusoba.  Those are fried noodles served on a hot skillet.  Fried = Real Man.  Skillet = Real Man.  It was excellent, and it came in a Hungry Man sized portion.  We also ordered the fried appetizer.  Not tempura mind you...FRIED.  When Genki says fried on the menu, they mean FRIED.  Like as in keep your nitro glycerin tablets close by level fried.  Also excellent.  \n\nWhat I really do not like about Genki is that the actual restaurant looks like a video game.

Sheesh, talk about stacking the deck against myself! I hate going to restaurants when it's slow and near closing time, because kitchen staff typically are more focused on cleaning up the kitchen rather than their cooking. But due to some logistical issues I won't go into, I found myself in the restaurant, hungry and cold.\n\nWell, since they have an exhibition kitchen, I could see all their moves. And they seemed to be focused on their cooking, thank gawd, as the last thing you want is errant splashes of Clorox in your broth.\n\nI prefer my ramen noodles firm, so I specified that for kicks on my order. I chuckled to myself when I saw my server run into the kitchen to make the notation on my ticket. I suppose their order entry system doesn't account for noodle doneness. This was interesting, as the menu mentions in a footnote that you can specify the oil/fat content and the firmness of the noodle, which was a nice gesture suggesting that the restauranteur did some research into ramen.\n\nAt any rate, I had their #401, their chashu ramen, and it was decent. I avoided the other weird fusion ramen abominations (curry tonkatsu ramen WTF???), deciding to go for something much more pedestrian. I also skipped on the various toppings that were on offer like corn and extra chashu.\n\nThe slices of chashu had a nice sweet, ginger soy marinade taste, but it was a bit on the salty side. It probably sat in the stewing liquid for too long. Same goes for the shoyu egg as well.\n\nStandard issue menma tasted fine. Their beni-shoga topping was straight from the jar. Standard foodservice stuff. No complaints there.\n\nThe soup seemed to be a tonkotsu style broth, light milky brown in color from the marrow and collagen that comes from hours of cooking down pork bones. Well, I'm assuming that. For I know, they're just serving up pre-made foodservice broth.\n\nAt any rate, the broth was served nice and hot. Perfect foil for a cold evening. The slices of scallions added a nice kick to the proceedings.\n\nThe noodles came out firm as requested. Nice. They tasted fine. Not too eggy or day-glo yellow like noodles you see sometimes in other establishments.\n\nThe portion size seemed a bit small, but not too small. I'll have to ask if I can order extra noodles next time. Don't recall seeing the option on the menu tho'.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Especially if you are drunk and craving something hot, salty and oily. Definitely a better option in my book than a slice of 'za from Nizario's up the street.\n\nI would go on a limb to say that Genki's ramen is probably better than the offerings at Halu, Katana-Ya, Oyaji, or Tampopo. At $9, it's not a bad deal.\n\nBut then again, that's like picking the lesser of all evils ramen-wise in San Francisco.\n\nI think I'll come back again and check out the other goodies on their menu.", "author": "Bono B."}

Gyoza was alright, nothing special, and the tentacles were just....fried squid tentacles. \n\nWe also got the grilled onigiri which is basically a rice ball with eel on the inside, grilled and smothered in unagi sauce. It was alright but again, nothing special. \n\nI ordered the Chashu ramen and the gf ordered the seafood ramen. Both were pretty small portioned compared to Himawari. I had a generous helping of chashu and she had a decent portion of seafood, though her mussels were reportedly pretty sandy. The noodles had some texture to them but it just didn't have that \"bounce back\" that I expected. Broth was alright. I'll give them credit for not having globules of fat floating at the top like Himawari does, but at the same time, it does make me question the authenticity and the origin of the soup. \n\nOkonomiyaki was alright, good amount of seafood, lacking on the cabbage and was a bit underdone. \n\nIn the end, the check came and we were charged full price for all the items, so when I addressed this to the waitress she argued with me that it was entered in the computer at 7:01 when I had ordered around 6:45, and had been told by the other waitress that these items were on happy hour rates.

The ramen was alright not the best, but decent enough.  Their seafood okonomiyaki was actually pretty good and I think that would be the only thing I get there.  The food wasn't horrible at all.  The only problem I have with them is that they AUTOMATICALLY add tip onto your bill even with a party of 5.  I find that pretty lame that I had to pay a 15% tip rate when the waitress only came to our table ONCE after the food was served.  I think people will tend to not see the tip part and will probably add more to their total for tip even though its already added on to the bill.  So I would suggest you carefully look at your bill before you pay.  \n\nDid it become a law to automatically add tip onto the bill now?  when it comes to service and tipping I find it pretty shady...", "author": "Jess T."}

I had a seafood ramen soup bowl, and David had spicy mussels, which were covered in a sort of \"secret sauce,\" that was slightly spicy and contained bits of seafood.  He drank a \"So Cool,\" which was a shoju cocktail made with yogurt (tasty, but dessert-like) and I had a shoju Mojito.  Very refreshing.  \n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant.  It was very clean, with lots of televisions and modern-looking Japanese-style furnishings.  Service was competent and friendly.

The brightness and unnecessary flickering and flashing from the TVs diminishes an otherwise very nice atmosphere.\n\nThe food also suffered from a similar inconsistency problem.  While my ramen bowl was well presented and the broth was tasty, the lack of ramen and other ingredients undermined the dish. For a $9 bowl of ramen I was expecting a bit better. Add another $1 for corn and the price - quantity - quality trade-off didn't really work for me.

We also thought the name was amusing, since we're picturing lively, animated, and spirited noodles (a definition of genki we use in taiko).\nI had the Chashu Ramen with a side of Pork Fried Rice.  Maybe it was a bit redundant to order a pork dish with a side of pork, but sometimes you just have to go for it!  The restaurant gave a generous amount of pork slices in a broth that was flavorful ... not just salty.  Like the movie Tampopo stressed, it's critical to have a good basic soup stock. .  \nMy dining partner ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Donburi that came with a side salad and miso soup.  He said that the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce had a good flavor (not bitter).\nWe were sitting in the back so could see the cooks busily and efficiently working in the small two person kitchen.

It wasn't necessarily a 'salad.' And the dressing wasn't the ponzu/shoyu based that you're normally supposed to get. It was the creamy sesame kind.\nThen, the gyoza came out and the wrapping didn't even enclose the meat in. The gyoza wrapping was around the meat like a enchilada. The whole point of the wrapping is so that when you pick it up, the meat doesn't fall out. It's not like only a couple gyoza were made accidentally that way. It was ALL of them, and my boyfriend being optimistic said that maybe they were trying to be 'different,' but that was a fail. So I ended up eating all the wrappers and meat separately cuz they all fell out.\n\nThen the ramen came, and I don't really know how to describe it, but it didn't taste like ramen. It tasted like some type of noodles in broth, but not ramen. Having lived in Japan for a year, trust me, I know what quality ramen tastes like. And broth is as important as the texture of the noodle, if not the most important. And this broth was...booooring. \n\nThe reason why I gave this two stars though is because the people who worked there were nice and had speedy service (But then again, we were one of two tables there).

It is located on Geary in the small shops area of 94118(single digit avenues).  I have witnessed this place for both lunch and dinner and found this place to be very pleasing!\n\nFrom the outside it looks like a cheap chinese restaurant.  I used to drive by it on my commute home from work and noticed the bright flashy orange sign(very smart color to use).  I thought to myself that I would try it out cause it was new.  The menus on the front window were very nice and had good photographs of the food.   Genki Ramen has a low profile front.. so be careful you could miss it while walking!\n\nOnce you enter the restaurant there are Plasmas on the walls!  I worked for Best Buy as an installer and felt that the TVs were done up very clean indeed.  Nice and level... evenly spaced.. very proper.  The tables were very nice and the chairs all had the Genki words etched into the wood(Classy!)  I thought the overall atmosphere of the place is 5 stars!  There were paper chopstick holders that saved me the trouble of making my own normal boatshaped version out of the chopstick wrapper.  I must say the sake filled bar, the open window view of the chef, and the nicely planned locations of the seats and tables took my breath away!\n\nThe lunch menu is actually a smaller(photoless) version of the dinner menu.  I highly recommend going there for dinner to scout the menu out for the first time =)  The ramen was not the best I have had, but one of the best in the city that I have tried.  I am normally a Shoyu broth fan, but their own pork based one was grand as well.  The onigiri was yummy!!!  What else can I say... I also ordered the Yakisoba that came on it's own sizzling platter.  The waitress was super nice and the chef although he was very far from my seat.. would beam a smile here and there.  To top it off nonstop Japanese music videos cycle on the screens. \n\nIn conclusion.. this place is definately a good choice for something different!  Although parking could be very rough, I recommend this place for people who want something different than sushi =)\n\nUPDATE: This place retains the 5 stars just because it takes online ordering from grubhub.com!

Actually, i take that back. The food is pretty good, the appetizers mostly. The ramen is just mediocre, all the soups have the same base so anything you order will probably taste similar with different ingredients. The price is pretty average, not too expensive (but then again, its RAMEN). \n\nWhat i didnt like about this place was the service. The servers were borderline negligent, which i HATE.

The place is nice and jazzy and feels comfortable once we arrived, along with a nice bar area. The waitress promptly seated us while we looked at the menu to order. Now I know why your all asking why I gave this place only 2 stars instead of more and I will get to that part shortly. I really even considered giving this place 1 star but in the long run I have to admit the food was good.\n\nSince it was my first time here I let my friend do all the ordering, after she did so I noticed that we got soft shelled crab (a personal favorite) hakata ramen and some other appetizers. I decided to order a coke since I didn't feel like water at the time and I can tell ya the wait was unbearable. Since we came here on a weeknight there weren't a lot of people seated but still the service was HORRIBLE! I have never waited so long for food, drinks, and service especially since there was no one in there! Even when we were done eating it took a good 15 minutes to get our bill and I never got refills on tea or water. It was frustrating to say the least considering the food was pretty good. I was pissed to the point where I wanted to skip the tip but my friend took care of it so I guess that was that.\n\nThe food itself wasn't bad. The ramen was good and the soup base was perfect. It wasn't too thick or too salty, and along with the soft shelled crab made for a good meal. If only the service was better I would have rated this place better.

They do offer one meager slice of braised pork which turned out to be a real stingy piece.\n\nThe curry pork ramen is to be skipped.  The pork is prepared tonkatsu style and again, once dunked into the broth it just ruins the entire structure and original taste.  And plus the pork was so lean and dry, you're best left w/o it.  \n\nThe ramen was pretty good.  I've had ramen at japanese restaurants that tasted like the dehydrated packages you live off of in college.  This I could tell was at least semi homemade.  And the portions were substantial so I was happy.  \n\nI thought the open ended gyoza was pretty good too.

I commend Genki on its balanced flavored ramen soup that is not too salty and no too oily. (You know you go for at least 2 full pints of water after eating at Santa Ramen, you know you do. Kinda annoying on a full stomach.) I wish the hard-boiled egg came in the soft-boil style. But alas, the eggs are pre-boiled, so PASS. \n\nBesides the extensive Ramen list, Genki has quite an awesome list of appetizers, chef specials, and small dishes. I wonder how they can keep the ingredients fresh day in, day out. The beef enoki roll topped with miso sauce was decent. The chicken gizzards had a great crunchy texture. My friend was looking forward to the ika yaki, but he still likes Kirala's ika better 'cuz Kirala grills the sides to a perfect crisp.\n\nGenki is definitely a welcomed neighborhood ramen joint.

We can only watch Tila Tequila for so long while eating, before food begins tasting dirty.\n\nThe appetizers are good.  We've had the salmon, gyoza, and kara'age chicken.  All staples of these new fusion-y ramen places, so it didn't lose any points there.  However, it's the $9 chasu ramen and $8.50 basic ramen that makes us scratch our head.  Is it really worth that extra buck?  Especially when food comes so cheap in the Richmond?    We suspect this place would flood with foot traffic if they made their prices more competitive.  Yes, the ramen is ok.  Broth is clean, beef is tender.  But we're turned off by the premium price.\n\nThe service is pretty good.

Genki primarily serves ramen noodle bowls, with thick, delicious noodles and a hearty (but a little oily) broth. I couldn't tell if the noodles were house-made, but either way their taste and diameter were a whole different ball game then the $.60 ones you get at the grocery store. (not that I have any problems with those.)\n\nThe rest of the menu is almost tapas like, with small plates and lots of appetizer and a la carte items to share. We started with my choice of pumpkin and yam tempura and my bf's choice of shrimp shu mai. Both were excellent, although the shu mais were smaller than usual and therefore a little over priced in my opinion. The tempura I could have had alone as a meal itself. The pumpkin pieces are always my favorite when I get tempura, and in this order I got 2 pieces of pumpkin, 2 pieces of yam, and 2 pieces of wintermelon. Yum!\n\nWe then shared a chicken nugget ramen bowl, which was great because they put the crispy chicken pieces on the side instead of in the bowl so they stayed crisp. Off the a la carte menu, we sampled one lamb and one prawn skewer. My lamb was a full grilled lamb chop on a skewer stick! It came with a great soy-mint dipping sauce. My bf's prawn skewer was a whole, unshelled prawn with a skewer stuck up it's butt and the head still attatched. This kind of freaked him out a little, and he said the flavor was \"a bit TOO fishy.\" I didn't try it. I think I could have 2 or 3 of the lamb skewers by themselves as a meal next time.\n\nWe rounded the meal out with a caramel ice cream sundae with big pieces of fresh watermelon, mango, strawberry, and kiwi. We usually don't order dessert but this was totally worth it. They have another sundae with a green tea topping that I will definitely try next time.\n\nOverall: Worth it and a totally fun vibey experience.\n.", "author": "Rosie B."}

There was plenty of chopped scallions, bamboo shoots, and slices of tender pork.  The marinated hardboiled egg was a nice add-on.  The whole bowl tasted fresh and wasn't too salty.\n\nThe spicy tofu ramen isn't a traditional Japanese dish but we tried it based on a recommendation from a friend who's more J than A.  This one was a bit too greasy for me, most likely due to the chili oil they added to put the spicy in spicy mapo tofu ramen.  The broth was a bit thin and had less flavor than the chashu soup.  It came with cubes of soft tofu and minced, seasoned pork.\n\nThe service was semi-prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere was a bit noisy with groups chatting over the J-pop music.  There were several screens showing J-pop music videos and after a while, I felt a little edgy and unnerved by the flashing, cartoonish images.

We ordered our usual stuff, stir fry black pepper beef ramen and the curry tonkatsu along with a mango smoothie and watermelon juice. When the mango smoothie came, my boyfriend noticed it was really bland, no taste at all. So we told the lady and her excuse was that the mango was not in season so it wasn't sweet. Ok sure?  whatever. When our food arrived, i took a few bites from my curry tonkatsu rice plate and the rice was hard. I told the server that the rice was hard. The stupid lady said \"oh she didnt cook the rice so its not her fault\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Your the server. You represent the people in the kitchen as well. Do your job and satisfy your customer. Do whats best for your customer and make them happy. But they definitely do not understand the concept of good customer service. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I asked for the manager and another server came by and said she was the manager. BULLSHIT. She is definitely not the manager. She was not understanding at all.

I came here last Friday pretty much expecting this place to be what it is. There just wasn't anything special about anything they served. The prices are fair compared to Nombe & Isakya Sozai. The chashu ramen wasn't too oily or too salty-- but the chashu was a bit dry. The tako yaki was a bit disappointing because there's only a small piece of squid in the center-- but again, for the price, it was fair. The ambiance of the restaurant is probably the best thing about this place. High ceilings, TV's everywhere, and nice bathrooms. This is a good place for groups and families-- but probably not for a date. If you do-- it'd be a pretty cheap date. They've got drinks and yummy looking soju mixed drinks (which is probably a sign that this place is not entirely authentic..). For a casual dinner (and no lines around 7 on a Friday) in San Francisco, this a good place to go.", "author": "Julie H."}

Yeah, that's the disappointment, I know you're feeling it right this very second as you nod your head in agreement.\n\nGenki is fine for lunch, its a good place to take someone that has never eaten a really great bowl of ramen to go, but it makes you cry when you think how far from the mark this ramen actually falls. Make sure to read the menu, there's an option that will allow you to get a more flavorful bowl by asking them to keep the oil instead of skimming it off.... i mean seriously, why in the name of all that is holy would you ever want them to skim the fat and oil off the ramen!?

I wouldnt say it's five-star quality, but it was pretty decent ramen!  Surprised this place didnt get a higher rating.\n\nCame here with two of my besties.  I have a thing for noodle soups, so ramen was the obvious choice when we came here.  I ordered the Chasu Ramen with Gyoza ($7.95).  I didnt try anything else on the menu though, so I cant speak for their other choices.\n\nIt definitely hit the spot as far as ramens go.. pretty tasty and a decent portion.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place as well.. looked like there was a bar against one of the walls, and I remember there to be two plasmas that were showing cartoons.  Nothing like watching cartoons with a bowl of ramen on a Saturday afternoon.  \n\nThe waitress was nice.. dont have much to say about the service.  She took our orders, brought us food, gave us tea.

The Veggie Okonomiyaki, a Japanese frittata on a hot plate, was not bad, but maybe I would try something different next time. Finally, the Tempera Ramen was not bad, and the broth wasn't that salty.\n\nI actually liked this place, overall.  I would say that it is however expensive ramen.  With many things you could just make at home.  You do a Sandra Lee and do it semi-homemade and pick up some Mapo tofu from your favorite Chinese restaurant and toss it on top of some homemade ramen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-28", "description": "I came here for dinner with a friend last night. Like a good little Yelper, I looked at their Yelp review page before I left work. From there, I clicked on their website. The first thing that caught my eye on their website wasn't the picture of a delicious-looking bowl of tonkatsu ramen, but a hyperlink labeled \"Coupon\". I then used the company printer and ink to print out a coupon for free crispy daimaru (deep-fried ring with cheese, spinach, and fish cake) or sesame wings. Woot woot!\n\nFree food makes me happy, and free-food-related happiness makes me more inclined to give a good rating--which may be why Genki Ramen gets 3-stars instead of 2. (Because really, in Yelp words, \"Meh. I've experienced better\".)\n\nMy friend and I chose the CRISPY DAIMARU out of sheer curiousity as to what they were. What we got were 3 crispy deep-fried disc-shaped raviolis filled with cream cheese, spinach, and fish cake. They were served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Since I like anything with cream cheese in it, I was a fan. Were they amazing? No. Would I normally order this? No, but I'll take any free food I can get =P\n\nFrom their Happy Hour menu we got the potato croquette and takoyaki for $3 each. The CROQUETTES weren't anything special and were basically greasy mashed potato hash browns that weren't particularly flavourful. (I actually think I prefer McDonald's hash browns...) As for the TAKOYAKI, they were decent but looked like the frozen type you can find at Nijiya. (I'm 94% certain they don't make them in-house.) Even worse, they were soooo stingy with the okonomiyaki sauce (a few squiggles) and there weren't even any bonito flakes!\n\nWe then shared a few robata items. At all the other izakayas I've been to robata come in two skewers (or more) per order, so when I saw the prices here I thought they were very reasonable--until I realized you only get one skewer per order. (D'oh!) We got the ox tongue with salt, pork neck with soy sauce, and yaki onigiri (grilled rice ball with diced unagi). The OX TONGUE was horrible. It was tough and chewy--basically the furthest thing from melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't even finish the small skewer because I didn't want to waste calories on non-tasty food. The other two were a lot better. The PORK NECK was tender and fatty and I really liked the unagi in the YAKI ONIGIRI. The only problem was the too-sweet teriyaki sauce they were covered in. We also got an order of their \"house specialty\" BEEF & ENOKI ROLL. These just looked kinda... well, sad. For $6.75 we got 4 small rolls of sliced beef with enoki mushroom wrapped inside. There wasn't much flavour except for the spicy miso sauce they top the rolls with.\n\nLastly, we got the CHASHU RAMEN in tonkatsu broth. The pork was tender, the bamboo shoots were tasty, and the boiled egg was marinated well. I wasn't that impressed with the broth though. Sure, it had the creaminess I like in tonkatsu broths but it was just salty more than anything. It didn't make my lips smack and I've definitely had better.\n\nAlas, my search for the best ramen in SF goes on...", "author": "Steph L."}

At this point my friend is starving, we're all finished eating so he just gives up and takes it.\n\nWe asked for separate checks, but he just divided our group in half and gave us two checks, go figure.

The atmosphere is really cool and almost mysterious. Check the website for a monthly coupon, usually valid for a free appetizer during dinner. However, I must dock one star because the service is not up to par. Refilling tea takes forever and most of the time, the servers ignore your table. Exhibit A: I was holding the check for a few minutes before the waiters standing around the bar chatting finally got the note.\n\nI love the tea that's served here. I drink cups and cups of it every time. As for the main entree, I've tried the butter & corn ramen, chashu ramen, shrimp tempura ramen, and chicken kaarage ramen. I think the noodles used to be better quality (thicker) since my chicken kaarage ramen seemed to have finer noodles during lunch today. The chicken kaarage was fried to perfection. I can't wait for my face to breakout, wait, it already is. \n\nI also opt for the yakisoba entrees when I'm not down for ramen in soup. Now, the yakisoba is smothered in oil so be warned! My friends and I refer to yakisoba as \"oily goodness\" and it's basically stir-fried ramen with mixed veggies, cabbage, and whatever other ingredient you choose (beef, chashu, kimchi, spicy, etc.) I've tried the kimchi and spicy yakisoba dishes and both are good. The portions aren't fulfilling enough for me, though. This goes for both soup ramen and yakisoba. It might be best to go with an appetizer. During happy hour (3-7pm) many appetizers are $3, but for lunch combinations with soup ramen, an additional $1 will get you either: 2 pcs gyoza (pot stickers), chashu fried rice, or chicken kaarage. Not a bad deal, except maybe the 2 piece gyoza. I've never seen anyone order any rice here but I might try that another time. Genki Ramen is open pretty late but if you around 30 minutes before closing, all orders are forced to be take out. I do recall eating at Genki Ramen after watching movies at AMC Van Ness.

The broth (chashu) we had was flavorful, though, with fresh meats and veggies. \n\nI had a chicken okonomiyaki (pan-fried potato pancake with meats and veggies, with special sauce) and it was solid but not mind-blowing. Served piping hot on a heavy skillet, it was on the bland side, but the okonomiyaki sauce on top was quite tasty. The service was attentive though a bit forgetful (we had to ask for our drinks twice). Dishes were served up promptly but the kitchen got my order wrong and I had to wait doubly long for my dish. \n\nAmbiance: Asian-style casual cafe, with contemporary decor and flat-screen TVs all along the walls. I liked the dark wood floors and custom chairs. \n\nI'd say this is a good place to go for late-night munchies (open til 1am on weekends). It' also a good lunch or dinner place for groups, and families with small kids.", "author": "SfMom O."}

I was a bit disturbed the following day when I pulled the leftovers out of the fridge for lunch and found my soup had become a gelatinous blob that plopped into my bowl.\n\nSecond visit I ordered ramen noodles with curry veggies.  Veggies were ok, but the noodles were a stringy pile of glue.  Blech!  My friend ordered some very tasty asparagus wrapped in bacon.  So good and the asparagus wasn't overcooked.\n\nThe loungy atmosphere is nice, even when crowded it didn't seem loud and the service was good.

The menu offers a great assortment of ramen, okonomiyaki, appetizers and robatayaki.  \n\nI ordered a Garlic Ribs (soft bone) with silky tofu and spicy miso.  Then we shared Takoyaki (octopus balls with sauce and bonito flakes), ox tongue robatayaki  and my friends ordered chashu ramen, spicy sausage and chicken okonomiyaki.  I enjoyed my Garlic Ribs ramen, they had some fried garlic pieces in the meat broth and the ramen was cooked to an al dente texture which I liked.  The other food that I tried from my friends were ok.  The takoyaki was pretty good, very hot and tasty.  The ox tongue unfortunately had no flavor and we had to add salt and pepper.  The spicy sausage okonomiyaki was pretty good (the okonomiyaki in Japantown tastes a lot better).  They served it on a sizzling plate with a cute cutting utensil.\n\nService really sucked.  They were understaffed with only two servers and one buser.  The girl got our order wrong and I kept thinking she was going to add stinky tofu because that was what she kept repeating.  We had to flag the server so many times for simple thing like getting the bill, paying the bill and just getting simple condiments like salt and pepper.\n\nAtmosphere is nice and clean.  I actually liked the tvs at all angles so there is something to watch.  \n\nI would come back when I feel like ramen closeby and some variety in my menu.", "author": "Yun W."}

It doesn't get real busy here but a good amount of ppl flow in and out of this place.  I came here for lunch to treat my co-worker since his bday was last month and we were both busy the whole month. I opted for the Chasu Ramen and he got the Chicken Kaarage Ramen. I also got a Matcha swirl which is a like a green tea smoothie wit whip cream and some powdered Matcha on top. My guess is that there is green tea ice cream in their since i have tired to duplicate this and have made a good one but their is still something that is missing, not sure if i will ever figure out wat that is tho. The Chasu Ramen came with about 4-5 pieces of well seasoned chasu that literally melted in my mouth. I think it was a bit too tender, cuz i didn' t have to chew much. lol.  The noodles are always good and so is the broth.  I also ordered their Karrage which is good but not as meaty as other places. I think Genki Ramen of a place to grab a quick eat or a snack like their sister store.

There are tv's everywhere broadcasting various basketball games, which is nice. It seems like the place is trying to go for sort of a sportsbar/clubby atmosphere. I like the TV's, I give a thumbs down for the atmosphere. The music is thumpy and not food music, as if we're in a club. You don't eat ramen in a freakin club. Also, the lighting sucks, it really gives the food an unappetizing hue.\n\nThe ramen isn't the best I've had, but I like the texture of the ramen and the soup base. \n\nI like the croquette cuz it's crispy, but tastes vary since my bro didn't like it at all.", "author": "Shizuka L."}

Nice, clean, trendy, and even a good restroom. Questionable at those in the hole places, where their food is really good, but their restroom is so ghetto and dirty! \n\nNow the food, the ramen was okay, not the best like Ryowa or Santa Ramen, but still good.  I prefer the thick curly noodles from Ryowa in Mtn View, vs straight. Most places do serve straight noodles however. \n\nfood item scores\n\nRamen 3.75 stars\nBlue Night Cocktail 1.75 stars\nPotato Croquette- 4.25 stars\nChicken Karaage- 3.75 stars\nVegetable Tempera- 4 stars\n\nThey have a big list of sake.

We ended up sharing the meals and they made a great combination. Their strawberry mochi makes a great dessert as well. They also have a Japanese yogurt beverage (alcoholic) called \"so cool\" which seriously tastes like liquid yogurt. \n\nMy only gripe was that we ate there around 4:30PM while nobody else was eating there, and the waitresses STILL were just sitting around, not asking how the food was or anything. I always had to call them over instead of them doing that themselves. \n\nOther than that, the food was good and I would eat there again; perhaps at a sooner/later time when there's more customers other than myself and my lady.", "author": "Michael S."}

I rarely leave my neighborhood (TL Heights) so coming out to the Inner Richmond was a treat for me, almost like going to another city really.\nGenki Ramen was about half full when we arrived, we were quickly seated and had to choose from the numerous choices on the menu. What I quickly discovered is this was not the typical Japanese restaurant that I frequent; Mifune in Japan Town and Kyoto on VanNess. I was in the mood for udon or soba noodle but only saw Ramen. Ok, so that just meant I had to open up my culinary mind and enjoy the culinary ride.\n\nWe started with the Chicken Yakisoba which is kind of like a Japanese Crepe only thicker and served hot on a pizza like skillet that comes with a little spatula to serve. For my first time having this dish I have to say it was my least favorite. I thought the dough/batter was too mushy like an undercooked pancake. The chicken was flavorless and the dried seaweed served on top as a garnish made it to \"fishy\" tasting. I'm glad I tried it but wasn't doing it for me. \nThe next item was scallops in butter and garlic. I am not a fan of scallops but Irv and his friend from Germany seemed like them, lets just say none were left behind. I ordered the shitake mushroom served with soy sauce, three good sized mushrooms were served on a wooden pick, nicely cooked al dente'; I definitely like them.\nNext we ordered grilled lamb chops served with a mint sauce, not mint jelly, there's a difference. These were grilled perfectly, moist, not gamey tasting and the mint sauce added that extra something special to the chops.\nOur final dish and only because I needed some carbs was the Curry Beef Ramen. A healthy portion was brought to us with slices of beef, carrot, green onion, potato in a miso base. It tasted alright but I felt it needed some spice so when I asked our waitress for something to spice it up she brought me a bottle of Sri Racha sauce, anyone who loves spice has a bottle of this in their fridge like I do. Let me just say it did the trick and made this dish even better.\nWe did not order any drinks and our bill with tax and tip was just under $50 for three people which isn't too bad in my opinion.\nI'd definitely come back the next time I venture out to the Inner Richmond.", "author": "David P."}

I only recently started to like it, since the advent of Yelp.  After growing up on Top Ramen and Maruchan packaged ramen, I never knew what the big deal was.  The package stuff was good for the starving the college kid, but it's not fit for grownups.  Fortunately, I do know what flavors work for me.  I don't like an overly salted broth.  Too much salt and you lose points.  Too much MSG, and I may not be back.  Having sampled Katana-Ya, Halu, and John Hayato's ramen, I can honestly say that Genki's tonkatsu-based broth is delish and ranks up there.  I liked its full flavored velvety broth.  It had like a buttery flavor to it, with not as much MSG (I tasted it afterwards) as Katana-Ya. It was good.  The ramen itself was OK.  It was soft, but didn't have that chewy texture...kind of like having al dente pasta...to it.  The topper was choosing the beef brisket instead of the boiled chasu.  First off, chasu, or Chinese char sui, isn't boiled...it's bbq'd.   I had some of T's charsu ramen, but wasn't that impressed with it.  I was perfectly happy with the slices of brisket that topped my ramen.  The brisket itself had been slow cooked to tender perfection and there was some nice fat marbling in it.  Given this combo, the noodles were forgivable.\n\nGenki Ramen has a pretty decent offering of Izakaya or tapas-like Japanese food.  Since we weren't too hungry, we chose to order the fried squid tentacles.  Usually, when I have fried calamari, I like it with some sort of tomato-based cocktail sauce.  This fried goodness didn't need any of that.  It was perfect on its own and it had me wanting more.\n\nI'm surprised at the mediocre rating of Genki Ramen, as it seems like a really good place for a quick Japanese-style meal.  The d\u00e9cor was modern with warm dark wooden table/chairs and bright flat screen TVs.  The staff was excellent all-around.  They brought me a new set of chopsticks after seeing me drop my original pair.  They were on top of it and everything else.  Perhaps they've improved since they opened.  It's certainly worth a second look, which I will be doing again soon.", "author": "JeFF T."}

Sorry genki, you just got demoted to 3 stars...**\n\n\nAs LA ramen fanatics, my roommate and I have devoted our tastebuds and sensory organs to finding the best ramen in SF (and maybe the woooorrrlllddd).\nMaybe it was the extreme withdrawal from LA ramen.  Maybe it was the disatisfaction from other SF ramen.  Whatever the case, Genki ramen answers where other SF ramens have failed to deliver.\n\nWhile roommates were circling the area looking for parking, I had a good 15 minutes to admire the decor.  First impressions, Genki looks like a chain resturant with customized chairs, chopstick holders and the like.  Naturally, I assumed the food would be typical franchise food, comparable to Ajisen...\n\nThe menu is extensive with many ramens i have never seen, including a seafood version (new to me).  As a first timer, I went with the original Chasu ramen...\n\nDominus Ramenus Points:\n+ very modern look, gives it an upscale-y type feel (entire place is newly renovated)\n+ great staff was helpful and service was speedy\n+ actual ramen noodles were good, not fantastic, but def above par\n+ soup base was very tasty and the entire bowl's temperature was perfect (can eat with soup without scalding your mouth)\n+ toppings plentiful, more than just 2 slices of chasu\n+ chasu had good ratio of fat to meat so that it was tender and delicious and at the same time didnt make you feel like you were an alaskan sucking down whale blubber\n+ option of spicy oil to add at own discretion\n+ very spacious seating!!!\n+ tvs to watch while you wait\n+ the kitchen is open to public to view, so we can watch the masters at work\n+ the chefs all looked old and japanese (= authenticity in my book!)\n+ you get your own pot of tea, to refill at own leisure (plus it came right when i sat down)\n+ portions are generous\n+ they DELIVER!!!\n+ give little japanese dessert hard candies\n+ cool sink in the men's bathroom\n\n- parking may be a hassle as that Clement area is...popular...during dinner\n- according to another yelper, you must order extra noodle at beginning...\n- ramen may be slightly salty and has aura of mass production when compared to a hole in the wall ramen shop\n\nOverall\nI will definitely come back when I'm craving some ramen, and am not on an adventure to try out other ramen.

I planned on cooking but with my kitchen sink broken until the next morning, I opted to order some Japanese food rather than try to make stuffed crab and sauteed kale.  If I'm going to eat a meal outside of my home, my number one priority: dine out somewhere you have never eaten.  Hence, I  had some food delivered from Genki Ramen (GR) via eat24hours.com.  The restaurant has a 15 dollar minimum charge for delivery.  Boo!  However, after selecting what I wanted from the menu, my total was 16 bucks and some change.  Not having to order tomorrow's lunch in order to make the delivery minimum: PRICELESS!  Delivery ETA: 30 minutes to an hour.  Should I have a spoonful of soy peanut butter and jam while I wait - my stomach is giving my liver the hungry eye.  Thank god for my friend Sahar who entertained me until delivery guy rang my door bell in what felt like less than 30 minutes: FABULOUS!  When I go to the door the guy held a cute little reusable GR bag that stated \"Got Ramen?\"  I signed for the bill and held my hands out expecting him to unload the food in my waiting hands.  When he handed me the reusable bag with my dinner and walked away I was already having premonitions of my future trips to Trader Joe's with my \"Got Ramen?\" bag.  \n\nDinner is Served! (with subtitles):\n\nwakame salad (seasoned seaweed salad): not much to botch up here - seaweed and seasonings.  It wasn't the best seaweed salad I've ever had, but I can't even name the best seaweed salad I've ever had and I've had a lot of seaweed salad.  The seaweed was good.  I added some amino acids (great soy sauce substitute - see Rainbow Grocer) and red chili flakes to the salad - SO NECESSARY!  NUMMY!\n\nunagi tempura (deep fried sea eel in tempura batter, served with tempura sauce)  My second priority after finding a restaurant that I have never dined at: try any thing on the menu I have never had in my dining experiences.  I love2love unagi, but I've never had unagi tempura.  The unagi tempura was a bit fishy in taste like fried oysters and I assumed they would barbecue the eel before tempura-ing it.  I assumed wrong.  However, with the tempura sauce and a squeeze of the accompanying lemon wedge: NUMMY!\n\nGrilled Onigiri (charcoal grilled sea-eel rice ball):  I **heart** rice balls!     (Shut it and get my mind outta the gutter!)  Cooking the rice ball on charcoal grill rather than the traditional way (steaming), was inventive.  I actually thought the rice ball was burned until I took a bite, followed by 4 -5 consecutive bites that did a David Blaine on the rice ball in less than 5 minutes.  After the first bite the rice ball fell apart and the eel came tumbling out, so some one at GR needs to re-enroll in rice ball 101.  Despite the aforementioned, the rice ball was bomb and the sweet and salty sauce the rice was soaked in gave the whole rice ball a wonderful flavor that accented its charcoal preparation.\n\nGR - I got your ramen!

The egg (whoa so small) was overcooked although it had a nice orange color, I hate bamboo. The noodles are sorta unremarkable and I hate how they slice the meat so thin. It feels so cheap though other ramen houses do that also. What a lame tradition. The bright spot is the broth, actually quite good. Alas, the whole bowl can't really go on broth alone\n\nFor an extra $1 you can have either gyozas, chicken kariage or a bowl of fried rice. I tried the chicken on people's recommendation.

I asked the if it was too late for us to be seated since I understood the desire to leave as early as possible on a Saturday night.. the server said \"no\" seated us and asked us if we wanted to order anything. I requested some time to review the menu. he went to his co-worker and did not realize that I understood and could hear clearly what they were saying. he returned shortly after and said \"can you order NOW?\"  I requested a couple more minutes. As soon as he returned we ordered our food and made special requests...  no pork (for health reasons) I politely asked him to please make sure there was NO PORK.  he and his co-worker were in such a rush to get out that they were just tossing plates and bowls down on the table as opposed to gently placing (which you think they would because of the hot soup and hot tea we ordered, btw can you say.... \"LAAAWWWSUUIIIITTTTT\" ) after making myself a little bowl of ramen I began to eat as quickly as possible thinking that I would hurry and get out of here since they didn't want me here and I didn't want to be in here with such a rude staff... I was just too hungry to think of another place, As I'm eating, I bite into a piece of pork. now if you don't know what gout is... you would want to avoid anything that could trigger it again. I simply stopped eating and sat there the server came over and picked up my bowl without even asking... funny how he didn't even need to ask. kinda makes me wonder if he did it purposely to get us out..  basically, if there is anything I want you to take from this... A) don't work in the food industry if you don't want to be mindful of others' dietary needs. B) please do not work such late shifts if you do not want to be there, you pretty much ruin EVERY ONE ELSE'S night.

When I first saw okonomiyaki options on the menu, I was excited because I don't know of many places that offer this kind of variety ever since trying it for the first time in Japan. I ordered the seafood okonomiyaki. It tasted ok but i think they should have more cabbage and less batter. The garlic rib ramen is ok and definitely not something you will want to write home about. Too much bones and cartilage on the riblets. I think the shiitake skewer is a rip off because it was only 3 small mushrooms for $2.75.

My favorites are the kimchi ramen and the chashu ramen, while my bf prefers the curry tonkatsu ramen. The noodles are tender, but not overcooked, and the soup has a great multi-layered flavor (it also feels so nice on a cold winter day). I actually like the decorations, too, it feels kind of modern and young, especially with the flat screen TVs (but I do agree that it is sort of distracting when there's a tv everywhere you turn). The only thing I would think that is not so stellar about this place is the gyoza. It's nothing really special.

Kind of modern/posh but not over the top. The Tonkatsu broth was great, not as rich or eggy as Izakaya Sozai but nearly as good (as good depending on what your in the mood for). The noodles were cooked to perfection.  And you can't go wrong on what's included because you can get or add anything! I chose Yasai, giving me delicious stir fried vegetables, definitely with a hint of yummy sesame, and added Wakame Seaweed and 1/2 Hard Boiled Egg (ditched the yolk). My mom had the Shichimi Chicken Salad which had wonderful grilled chicken and a tasty ginger dressing (and edamame) and the Nasu Gomaae we got was sweet and tender as well.

The ramen I got with chicken karage was quite good at Genki.   Price is reasonable and the only tough part is getting the attention of the waiter/waitresses.

There was only one spring roll, cut into two, two pieces of oysters, and maybe 5 or 6 squid legs.  The seafood was in a lot of batter.  I would not try that dish again.  We also ordered the samurai wings.  There was a misunderstanding and we thought there would be more wings to the dish.  The waiter told us that we usually get 5 wings but since they were bigger today, they gave us 4. First I thought .. there are some inconsistencies with that and secondly there are 5 of us .. I'd rather have smaller ones so all of us can have some rather than have one person miss out because they are bigger.  Aside from quantity, the taste of the wings were the highlight of my meal, sadly.  We got our appetizers at the same time as our entrees.  I had the curry chicken katsu ramen.  The chicken was decent, but by the time I finished eating my appetizer the fried crust on the chicken was all soggy.  The ramen itself was okay.

The thing about Ramen is that when you find one thats really good, you find yourself thinking about it often - craving the taste.  Go to popular ramen places and you'll find people waiting outside to get in.  \nI've been to Genki Ramen twice.  I can't recall what their ramen tastes like but I did like their chicken cartilage appetizer.  I never thought I'd ever like this part I usually throw away, but my wife got me into appreciating these new \"textures\"  \nI'm sure others before me have already mentioned the TV sets.  That seems to be a common addition to Japanese places recently.   As expected, they had Iron chef showing one time but I think nowadays they show more J-pop videos.   I don't like J-pop, but my uncle's younger brother was actually a challenger chef on one of the early Iron Chefs in 1994.  The main theme was Anago which he lost.  He has a nice restaurant now in Kobe.\n\nUpdate:  I just reduced my rating to 1 star.  We haven't been back ever since our last visit.  Even though its close, and we love Ramen, I guess they just didn't produce anything worth coming back for.\n\nUpdate2:  Guess what - I did come back.  I ordered the ramen set with small fried rice.  They gave me a ramen with large order fried rice.  The fried rice costs as much as the ramen and was way too much!  They shouldn't assume I want to eat all that food because I don't order using the exact menu phrases.\n\nUpdate #3:  OK, I give it 2 stars since I appear to be coming back about once a year.  Its still not what I would consider true ramen but good enough for annual visits so I've shown that I'm at least not avoiding their ramen.  My new complaint is now the MUSIC.  Please choose a more noodle-friendly genre or turn the boomboom tunes DOWN!", "author": "J M."}

I just wish I didn't have to drive out all the way to San Mateo for Santa or Mountain View for Ryowa Ramen. Since Genki Ramen is on Geary and is relatively close, I'd thought I'd give it shot for those times I need a quick ramen fix.\n\nUnfortunately, Genki Ramen is not the answer. I got the cold ramen, which to be fair may not be the best way to judge the quality of ramen. However the noodles were soggy, the chashu was way too salty, and the sesame dressing, which isn't really the standard sauce that I am use to accompanying cold ramen, was pretty flavorless. I think the main problem with the sesame sauce was that since it was more like a thick dressing, the water from the noodles and other ingredients just diluted the flavor.\n\nMy other friends got the soup ramen. One chashu and one katsu curry. They did not look appetizing either.\n\nI must admit the decor was modern and sleek. The restaurant was spotless and the LCD TVs on the wall fit well with the restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately, Genki Ramen falls way short on its ramen, which doesn't bode well for a ramen restaurant.", "author": "Jeff K."}

The food was okay--nothing to write home about but not bad.  The noodles were all right, the fixins were fine, but the broth was really lacking in depth.  This place is no Santa.  The service, though, was really not good.  The poor waitress was handling about 10 tables on her own and was really swamped.  We could see two guys in the kitchen but neither ever helped her out.   Our food came fairly quickly, but that was the last we saw of the waitress.  No refills on tea, no checking to make sure things were fine, and we had to practically grab her to ask for the check (which it took 10 more minutes to get).

I only have to go as far as 4th and Geary. The ingredients were fresh, the noodles chewy, the broth was the perfect temperature and the spices perfectly balanced. With every delicious bite, you could literally feel the restorative power of the traditional soup.

Each server answered with \"wait a minute\" and never came back to check on us.  When the food finally came the order was completely wrong.  We got one bowl of ramen between the two of us and one soda.  We tried to get the attention from the server to ask her about the rest of our order, but she answered again, \"wait a mintue.\"  If the servers have no time to attend to the seated tables - then guess what - stop seating more guests!

The tonkatsu soup base is a little different for me, but I like the richness of it.  Also, I think the chasu is much more flavorful than other places I've tried, and the portions are decent.  Also, I like that you can change the firmness of your noodles (apparently, I like my ramen a little firmer than most).  Gyoza and chicken karaage are good, though I remember the gyoza sauce is a little different.  Also, love the candy they gave at the end of the meal.

I usually come here whenever it's late and I have no where else that I want to eat. Their decor inside is nice, they have some cool chairs and some nice menus. The walls are aligned with televisions that are really interesting when wanting to eat your food and watching t.v. Haha. The food here is okay, I don't believe they make their own noodles unlike Watami. Too bad they didn't, but if they did I think this place would be a great hit. Usually I get the ramen noodles because they are oh so yummy! Ha. My favorite has to be the curry veggies. yum. I'm trying to eat healthier nowadays so I'm going more of the veggies thing. Thats a great choice if you're wanting to be a veggietarian. Overall this place is really good if you want a late night thang. Also the parking here is sucky... like how geary always is. But anyways, come here if you want some alright tasting ramen for some nice prices. Opens 'till 1! (on fridays and saturdays.)", "author": "Johnny T."}

Gyoza is good, Chicken Karaage and the fried rice all complimented the main bowl very well. Though the lunch combo special is only two pieces of your choice of appetizer, you get what you pay for. $71 + tip for 5 of us. Good service and trendy decor.", "author": "Brad Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-03", "description": "Genki Ramen is selling the atmosphere more than the quality of the food. The food is ok. If you want to hang out with friends and have a cocktail, Genki Ramen will do the trick. They have multiple TV hung up on the walls and they play Japanese or Korean music videos. The value of the food is a little over priced and the quality of the food is acceptable but if you just want some place to hang out and chat, Genki Ramen may fit the purpose.", "author": "Liana C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-15", "description": "price is very reasonable.  service is below average because the waitress seemed lost and i had to ask another waitress to refill the tea pot.  the ramen was average, nothing spetacular, ramen is ramen.  however, the fried rice was exceptional.  concerning the wait for the food, it's below average.  since it's ramen, i expected the preparation time to be minimal.  however, we did have a party of 14 so giving a rating of average is reasonable.  i wouldn't drive all the way to SF from sJ just for ramen, but if you're in the area, give it a try.", "author": "Wailun Eugene W."}

But I can comment on their small portions. We had ordered yakitori for delivery and was very shocked at little food was actually delivered. We couldn't decide whether to order more food from another restaurant that night or what. Overall, it was disappointing. If you like Yakitori like I do, try Hana Zen near union square.", "author": "Chanli S."}

They even forgot 2 orders!  When we asked for ice water, the waitress asked how many.  We said for everyone (which is like 10 people), she started counting and came up with the number 4.  She only brought 4 cups, and I've asked her if she can bring more ice water for everyone and she brought me one cup.  We had to ask her for the 3rd time and she finally brought EVERYONE ice water.  The food pricing is decent.  Overall, it's Ok.", "author": "Linda H."}
