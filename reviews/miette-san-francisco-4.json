The Macarons are on the soft chewy side, and I am one of the rare people that like that texture, but if you like your Macarons on the traditional side of crunchy on the outside and then chewy while you're chewing, these may not be for you. I love their vanilla bean and raspberry flavor. My husband liked the Pistachio and Caramel flavor. \n\n\nI think on week days their Macarons are on sale for happy hours :)", "author": "Jenn H."}

I usually \"buy the bar\" but I resisted! Lol! \n\nNot only are their cupcakes beautiful, they're moist and delicious also! \n\nFor me, the Miette cupcake embodies EVERY BIT of the cupcake Kristen Wiig (aka Annie) made for herself and then devoured on Bridesmaids. It's totally the doppelg\u00e4nger (with a minimalist spin) and exactly how I imagine it tasted while watching that scene. It's dainty, carefully iced, and has a tiny confectionery flower and petal. \n\nSorry, this is how my mind works and needless to say, I loved it! \n\nThe staff was kind and readily available to answer questions. The store is beautifully set up and offered a million and one options for your sweet-tooth sans their ice cream sandwiches as the freezer was broken.

I purchased neither the cake nor cupcakes.\n\nI'm a committed cake lover. It's one of the reasons I exercise -- so I can eat a ton of cake in times like these. I'm only half joking... \n\nUpsides: The white icing was delicious and fluffy. It was lightly sweetened and quite delicate on the palette. Loved this part of the cake completely. \n\nDownsides: The lemon curd was way too sweet. It was aggressive and masked the white icing flavor and cake itself. I was not a fan of this intermediate layer. In addition, the cake was so dry! I'm thinking it's because my friend had purchased the cake earlier that day and we were celebrating at night but even so....if it was baked the same day the cake would not have been that dry. My guess is that they were selling older, less fresh cakes from the back...?

Sure, it's bad for my teeth, not to mention my waistline, but who cares? Like the soap operas say you've only got one life to live and these are the days of our lives. I particularly like trying new candies and having old vintage classics. Also, when someone makes their own kind of sweet treats like cookies and ice cream sandwiches it makes me even happier. And so when I stepped foot into Miette my dentist cried a little and I got down to business.\n\nI peeked into every basket, every jar, every bowl and pulled out treat after treat. I bought chocolate in the shape of cars and sharks for my children, fancy chocolate with sea salt and ginger for my husband, and such a wide assortment of things for myself I'm ashamed to list them all. But guess what? The gal working there was so kind she didn't even blink an eye as my candy piled up.

(12/18/17)\n\nThe reviews here give a lot of conflicting information regarding their Happy Hour. The Miette's website gives no information, so I'll just write in my review the most up to date info, as far as I'm aware. I've read in reviews here that the Happy Hour was no longer occurring, was from 4-6, 5-7, etc. I've also read that there was no limit, had a limit of 6, etc. My first visit was in November of this year, I called ahead and asked if they still had a Happy Hour for their macarons. The woman on the phone told me that they do still have a Happy Hour, from 6-7 on weekdays. I pick up 6 macarons that evening. My second trip in December I go in and pick up 24 macarons. The lady charges me $12, so I assume the Yelp photo stating there's a limit of 6 was wrong and that perhaps there's no limit. I go in for my third visit on December 18th, and was about to pick up two 16-count boxes of macarons. I am told by one of the guys there, \"You know about our limit right?\" I tell him, \"Yes, I've heard something about the limit on Yelp (assumed it was 6). But the last time I came in, I got more than what I thought the limit was. So I wasn't sure if there still was a limit. But I'm happy to pay the normal price for the macarons that goes after the limit.\" The guy, who I'm assuming is the manager, responds in a very catty tone, \"Well, I'm going to need to know when you came in and who you talked to because if someone is bending the rules...\" I completely understand from a managerial standpoint you want to know who has not been following the rules. But also understand, that those discussions should happen internally between you and your employees. I should not be berated by a manager, who for one, I don't work for and for a mistake that another person made. I already let you know that I was willing to pay the normal cost. I'm not trying to make trouble here, I just came here to buy some adorably small cookies, not get yelled at by a grumpy manager.\n\nFor the future, Miette, I recommend being more transparent about your Happy Hour (be it through your website, Facebook page, or on Yelp). Your Happy Hour is great, by the way, for customers and your business. It clears out stock that would normally go bad by the next morning and it entices more customers. But this miscommunication between your business and your customers creates a lot of unnecessary conflict. \n\nAnother aside, while I love the all-natural, no food coloring vibe of your macarons--some of them are impossible to tell apart. If you guys could find a way to write down which are which in the box or better differentiate the look of them, that would be wonderful!", "author": "Diane D."}

I stopped by on a Sunday evening on the recommendation of a friend who told me that Miette's macarons are pretty good. When I went into the store, I didn't realize that they serve much more than just macarons! There are so many baked goods--cookies, ginger snaps, candies, chocolates, just about any type of dessert that you can possibly imagine. I didn't love the stuff I got, but I could see myself coming back in the future if I wanted to give someone a easy, presentable gift--that's why I'm giving it the four; I don't super love it right now, but if I really wanted random desserts, this seems like the right place to go. More of a fan of the concept and how cute the store is.\n\nI got the raspberry turkish delight, butter cookies, and macarons. The Turkish Delight tasted like Turkish delight--which is basically just a jello like gummy bear for those of you who aren't familiar. Butter cookies were pretty decent if you're into that--I'd be willing to try more cookies in the future.\n\nThe macarons are super 3 though. They're definitely on the cheaper end at around $1.45/macaron I think, but meh they tasted so bleh. I got the green tea, salted caramel, and vanilla. It may have been because I came too late in the day, but the green tea and the salted caramel were both really, really hard. The shells weren't necessarily hard but they were on the really need to be chewed side, which isn't what a macron should be like. Flavors were pretty good though. I will say that again, maybe I just got a bad batch because my vanilla macaron was actually like a proper macaron--soft shell, good flavor, though not rich flavor. It's definitely no Laduree.\n\ntldr; expensive cute pastry/snack shop. great for giving gifts, but so far I haven't actually super liked anything in here.

What is unique is that Miette uses no coloring or artificial flavoring!\n\nAgainst other macarons, flavors have a lighter sweetness and texture is a bit cakier / less chewy (depending on flavor). I liked the  hazelnut, pistachio, chocolate, and the seasonal chocolate lavender. Don't think I could really distinguish the subtle differences between Chocolate or Chocolate Lavender though.

The chocolate on chocolate was as delicious as promised. I was let down by the chocolate with Italian marshmallow cupcake. It was beautifully adorned and decorated but the cake was dry and the topping didn't blend as well with the cake as I would have thought. Still, a fine cake... just not as good as it looked (and in all fairness, it looked beautiful). \n\nThere are also all sorts of candy bars, fancy Euro chocolates, candies, jellies, toffees, caramels, etc. If it's sweet, it's here.

We walked into a boutique that had this charming book called \"Miette\". I immediately bought the book and I realized they were based in San Francisco, just a jump away. We decided to make a day of it. We walked to the Octavia St location from downtown. It was so cut and charming. I love the use of color perfectly placed around the entire room by use of Candy. I love their cute round table displayed with all their hand crafted gems. This place is so charming, I didn't have a problem with purchasing anything here. The young girl was very helpful. The darn little cakes are just the cutest things I had seen. So perfectly fitting for the boutique. The price of the items are perfectly priced for the quality of items they produce. The creations that people are buying take a certain skill to create, and either your good at it or your not. They are great at it! When I was there, I bought the marshmallows, the large caramel, and some meringue cookies. The ingredients used are so predominate in the flavor. The vanilla bean seeds in the marshmallows, the rich flavor of the butter from the caramel, and the light rose flavor from the meringues show the craftsmanship of a true pastry chef. \n\nIt's been a while, but I miss this place. I took the plunge and ordered online, for delivery to Texas. I have to say, I was a bit nervous. Because, I was not sure how they would ship. I ordered yesterday morning and I received my purchase just now by way of UPS next day air. Everything was packed perfectly so nothing was crushed, or broken. I was so happy when I opened my goodie box and ate a Rose-Geranium Macaron, still cold, but not too cold. Really the toffee was in perfect shape as well and did a dance in my mouth.

It's not a regular cookie. I like Miette so much better than other shops because these babies aren't overly sweet, their semi-crunchy and semi-chewy.

I realized it's been 5 years already since I first stopped at its Embarcadero location, particularly excited to try their macarons -- one of the first I ever tried, and while I've since tried many more, these macarons still don't disappoint. And that's just the beginning of their goodies.\n\nI didn't even know that there was a large store on Octavia St, which is even more satisfying than stopping by the Embarcadero one. The store here has tables and walls of imported, international candies that you grab yourself. With the gorgeous packaging and displays, everything is really tempting so you better watch your wallet or else you'll be surprised at how easily they add up here.  \n\nThis location reminds me of Sockerbit in West LA (they both have some similar options of candies), but Miette also has their own pastries. Today I tried a few macaron flavors that I don't remember getting years ago -- green tea, lavender chocolate, and rose geranium. All three of these happened to only have a few left by the end of the day when I went, although there were still plenty of other flavors. They are all so distinct in flavor! I didn't have to second guess myself or try to decipher them by color. Their macarons are always on the chewier side and particularly on a hot day, can very easily melt. But they're still some of my favorites, and whereas some macarons tend to be bland, forgettable, or disintegrate on first bite, I definitely know when I'm eating one from Miette. Their cookies are also worth noting; my family would get a couple boxes of them and they'd be finished way too soon! \n\nThere wasn't really any service here when I went, which surprised me.

I don't like Dylan's very much because it is geared towards young children, and they went wild with their color scheme and theme. I like how it has a feel of an old-fashion candy shop like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but everything was updated. \n\nWe tried a sample of their macaroons and it wasn't that great. I don't think I will order any of those from them, but I do want to try their cupcakes and tomboys. \n\nMy favorite candy was the Champagne bubbles, champagne and fruit flavored gummies. Just up my alley! I knew it would be good because there were only a few bags left. I wasn't disappointed! Tasted so good and exactly like Sanrio candy. A light taste in a chewy gummy covered with sprinkles. The candy is overpriced though. It was like three dollars for a little baggy of gummies. \n\nThis is a place you would go to for the novelty and not necessarily for everyday.

Not too sweet, but sweet enough. Each flavor really tastes like the actual thing...like pistachio literally tastes like pistachios. \n\nThis was my first time trying one of their cupcakes and I was drawn to the gingerbread one because I wanted something different that wasn't your usual vanilla or chocolate cupcake. I'm glad I stepped out of the box and chose the gingerbread one! It was incredibly moist and the ginger taste wasn't overpowering at all. The cream cheese frosting was rich and velvety. I loved it!\n\nThe gals that work here are very nice and you just can't help but feel happy once you leave the store.

When I gave the cookies to my host families, they all kept asking me which flavors were which and I had no idea because they were all the same colors!! Also, the flavors were nothing too great. I love different varieties of macaron flavors from passion fruit to green apple but they only had like 8 different flavors normal and not any great ones either.\n\nWhile eating them during coffee with my hosts, the flavors were a little too underwhelming.

I think their newest addition is ice cream- something I definitely would have remembered from my last visit. \nThey now carry mast brothers chocolate- a necessary indulgence.\nThe prettiest candy store I've ever been too- I've yet to try any of their cakes.", "author": "Margaret H."}

They had all sorts of glass jars filled with different candy and chocolates. Specifically, I came here to try their macarons because I needed to compare them to the ones from Paulette. I tried one hazelnut macaron and it was good, but not as good as Paulette's. They are a bit bigger in size, but the appearance and texture of the macaron is like a cookie. Where's the nice semi-crispy shell? \n\nI really like the decor of this place. You see a lot of contemporary bakeries these days that focus on one specialty item like macarons and cupcakes and their stores all start to look the same (e.g. Sprinkles, Kara's, Paulette). I haven't really seen a place like this yet. They also had a giant chocolate bunny in the glass counter on display that reminded me of that episode of The Simpsons when Homer was dreaming he was in Candyland and he took a bite out of that chocolate bunny that was hoping by.

They have chocolates from around the world and super adorbs hand wrapped candy flowers. \n\nHowever, on my quest to find the perfect cupcake, I tried their gingerbread cupcake and was sadly disappointed! Food Network, how you break my heart! There was a decent molasses taste, but I prefer a slightly stronger ginger taste and the frosting was overwhelming the cupcake. Maybe less frosting or more flavor in the cake part? Also, the cake was oily! Not cool! \n\nOh the bright side, even though my initial first bite/impression of their gingersnaps was that there was too much butter, my second impression is that these are highly addicting and proceed with caution.

However, that's not the sole purpose of the business.  \n\nI won't beat around the bush:  I was very disappointed in the cupcakes, which were heavily touted by online reviewers I'd read.  I found them bland, flavorless, and overpriced.  I especially disliked the chocolate cupcake, which was overly sweet and lacking in much chocolate flavor.  Also, the size of these cupcakes is a little bit smaller than average, so for $3.25, you wonder what makes these worth so much more money.\n\nI also purchased one of their mini-Scharffen Berger cakes, for $6.  It was quite a bit better than the cupcakes, but still doesn't make it to my mental list of favorite chocolate cakes.  I saw that the larger size 6\" cake was $35 (!!!!) and nearly fell over...um, a wee bit pricey for what it is!!!\n\nFor those of you who love cute candy shops but require disability access, know that this place is NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE:  there are steps leading into the front door.  What a shame.  \n\nOverall, I was not impressed by my experience here.

The packaging and decorations were so perfect and simple, I was really really pleased.The carrot cake was really dense and oily but the flavors were pleasant. The vanilla cupcake I have nothing bad to say about, it was really good.\n\nI wish I could give it a higher rating because Miette has such awesome little chocolates, german candies, and great baked goods with really great flavor and it is just so stinkin cute looking but the customer service was just nonexistent.", "author": "Ellen Y."}

In passionate, passionate love with Miette.\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a sucker for candy, baked goods, delightfully girly packaging and the color pink. Miette delivers on all fronts.\n\nWalking in will send your seratonin levels soaring. There is just no way you can come into this shop and not be happy. The packaging and placement is perfect. Candies, both nostalgic and whimsical, wrapped up in cellophane and stuck with the \"miette\" sticker to seal it. Conversation hearts, licorice bites, chocolate covered gummy bears, etc etc. All looking so pretty in their displays. Bunches of lollipops grouped together, all swirly and fluffy looking. Round ones with one color swirled with white. Long unicorn horn looking ones with the rainbow colors, slim ones on long sticks tipped with with shiny glass looking hearts, ring pops in multiple colors, some heart shaped, some gem shaped. Wafer discs of all colors bagged together, gum drops, gumballs! Jelly beans of one color filling up big glass vases. Whimsical, pink, frilly, and girly. I love it. It's Wonka's candy shop if Wonka was trying to impress a ballerina, or Glinda the good witch of Oz.\n\nJars lined up of loose imported chocolates and hard candies from around the world (mostly Italy and France) wrapped up in delicate papers and in fantastic colors. One in particular was described as a cloud burst. A tiny candy a little bigger than a jolly rancher. They were a dollar a piece but I had never tasted a cloud before so there you go. Unwrapped it's a white soft candy covered in sparkling sugar and...well...it tastes like you think a cloud wood. Sweet and fluffy, a little chewy then it melts in your mouth. I can't describe it but it's magical!\n\nMarzipan treats, chocolate squares, fizzy candies, Mary Jane's. All for the picking. Varying from $.25 a piece to just shy of two bucks each. And a chocolate table! With imported Italian chocolate bars, Vosges, Mast Bros. out of Brooklyn, and other small batch confectioners in the states. Wrapping up their bars in layers of shiny paper and beautiful papers with scrolly lettering. \n\nAnother table with their own baked goods. Plastic tubes filled with chocolate wafers, ginger snaps, etc. Baggies filled with round, puff like marshmallows, lavender shortbread, chocolate sables. Smaller tubes filled with pink and white meringue kisses. Oh the beauty of it all!\n\nAt the counter they've got fresher baked goods--macarons (the chocolate one was obscene), cupcakes, tarts, and ice cream sandwiches (which change daily. I had a fantastic little one with creme fraiche ice cream and a gingery cookie. Tart and sweet at the same time! Also--of no surprise--fresh cotton candy! Not sure how often they run the machine as it was off when I went but it was close to close so that could have explained it. Or maybe it's made to order? \n\nThe place isn't cheap. For the traditional candies you could easily get a box of conversation hearts in a box at Walgreens for much cheaper (and for a larger amount) but sometimes it's nice to give a really fancy wrapped gift for a special occasion. Or just treat yourself to something pretty once and a while. My little cousin turns three next week so I stocked up on pretty lollipops and candies for her for her special day. Also treated myself to a few sweets for the plane ride back, and cookies and other imported candies to take home to share with friends and family. At the very least it's a beautiful place to stop into and look around in. Get a gumboil for a quarter and feel like a fairy person in Candy Land.", "author": "Annette J."}

When I walked into the Hayes valley store today, I was in complete heaven! \n\nMy favorites are the macaroons of course! They are crispy on the outside and oh so fluffy on the inside. The cream fillings are amazing, and with flavors like rose and chocolate lavender, I was sold. The store is filled with beautiful displays of candies, gourmet chocolate bars, a variety of cookies, and gorgeous cakes and cupcakes.

Why are you so cute and expensive at the same time, Miette? My friend bought me a tiny chocolate marzipan bar for $5. Not worth it. OVERPRICED. It's 1/3 the size of a normal candy bar. This pretty little store can rob you. STILL I had to give it four stars, because I can tell you that the chocolate ice cream sandwich was worth it at $5. And the Mini Scharffen Berger cake was also worth it for $6.50. My friend isn't a big dessert eater, and is very picky about his chocolate cakes, but was in love with this one.  Eating those two things, made me forget about that stupid marzipan bar, which really should have been a $1.

All the candy colors of the rainbow!  Soooo pretty.  \n\nMy friend and I decided to try their chocolate cupcake, frosted with OCD perfection, topped with a red jellybean.  I also had to try their large round gingersnaps encased in a plain round plastic.  Unfortunately, the cupcake's frosting, even though completely upright during the trip home slid right off the cupcake; leaving some of it on the wrapper, and not in our mouths.  The chocolate flavor was not that intense, rather average.  The gingersnaps' flavor is excellent!  They are quite gingery, without being overly spicy, with a hint of orange and butter.  Unfortunately the ones I bought tasted like they had sat on the shelf for a week.  They were extremely hard..and not crunchy; just hard.

But they were good but that pricing is just too steep (I know cupcakes go up to $3 each but they're 3x the size). Pistachio was on point but lacked variety of different flavors. I really didn't taste much diff between the 3 different pistachio flavors, vanilla had no taste whatsoever. I felt cheated with the filling as if it were too airy and added no substance but since these were my firsts, I had nothing to compare by.\n\nThe major thing that put me off, and I agree with more recent reviews, is the two awkward hipster female workers. Light weight creepy how they arose from behind the counter just starring. One started assisting me while the other silently slid back down to her coffin. There were no formal greeting just pure silence, I even asked questions and the child was barely audible in response - I probably disrupted their facebooking time, but it killed my excitement of finding this place and receiving this type of service.

I've been working with cream cheese frosting forever and can never get it to be stiff to stay put.  They did it in a way where it looks beautiful but again, the taste is lacking.  The cream cheese flavor was barely there and there is so much frosting that it becomes way too sweet. \n\nThe Italian Meringue was also way too sweet and didn't go well with their chocolate cake.  \n\nI was pretty disappointed since the cupcakes look so pretty but don't be deceived by the looks.

That's the name of one of the delectable candies at Miette -- so called because when you squeeze it, it emits a little sigh -- that's how soft and fluffy and delicious these things are.  They come little bowtie shaped colored wrappers and come in three flavors, vanilla, coffee and something else, I forget, but those are the two that I bought.  \n\nI eat a lot of chocolate and sweets.  There are a lot of chocolates and sweets at Miette.  The interior is like a set from a Tim Burton movie -- bright, colorful, striped and zany.  They have one wall populated with all kinds of licorice and a large table with cookies, chocolates and other goodies so tasty that it would make my cardiologist cry.  Marzipan selections are carefully picked, wonderfully packaged and are all delicious.\n\nThey have a variety of \"English\" style treats too -- Flakes (chocolate that falls apart in the mouth like flakes), marshmallows as long as a ruler and cupcakes of all variety and flavors.  \n\nThey also carry Parisian Macarons which are similar, but not identical, to Paulette Macarons just around the block.  Miette Parisian Macarons are not quite as light and smooth as Paulette as the baking/preparation process is different.  This is not a bad thing -- it's just a different kind of bang for your buck.  SECRET TIP:  Miette Macarons are $1.00 from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Mon-Fri (Hayes Valley location only).  Another seasonal SECRET TIP:  Holiday candies are 50% off -- so get your fill of Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus chocolates and candy canes while they're still in stock.\n\nThe staff at Miette is excellent -- friendly and knowledgeable and appear to have tasted everything in the store.  A job I wish I could have on the side.  I would pay them to be the taste tester!\n\nMiette is not cheap, even for Hayes Valley.

I've been a long devotee of the original pastry shop so this visit was long overdue. Miette Confiserie is a dream to say the least. The store is filled with imported candies in glass jars, others formed into bouquets of flowers and pretty shades of pink and pale green docorate the walls. It's everything you ever wanted in a candy store but never saw in real life, until now. \n\nI loved that every candy had a name card that explains a little bit about where the candy came from, what it's made of and why Miette chose to have it at their store. They do have a limited selection of pastries but they still offered a few items like cupcakes, macarons, and a few cakes. I've always been more of a pastry dessert girl than a fanatic of candy but I had full faith in Miette on the candy. They didn't disappoint!\n\nCaramels - One of the things I hate about caramel is how overly sweet, chewy, or hard they can be. The ones Miette sells has given me a new appreciation for caramel candy (even though they don't made them themselves). They're made with local and organic ingredients and you can taste the quality. The multiple flavors just melt in your mouth. It was buttery sweet, nutty and even hints of fruit that went down so smooth. I'm sad I only bought one!   \n\nPetit Fours - These little cakes are beautiful. It's covered with white chocolate and hints of lemon flavor and is topped off with a real sugar flower petal. The name tag said they're only available during holidays so I assumed they had some left from Mother's Day. Perfectly fresh and delicious!\n\nChocolate Malt Balls - I had to get a mixed bag of dark, milk and white malt balls. One bite and I knew these were not like anything you could get at Walgreens. I didn't expect how thick layer of chocolate was going to be but it was so good. I love that there was probably more chocolate than malt (though there was a good portion of each).  \n\nI have one chocolate foiled candy left waiting for me at home. It's a chocolate, flavored with strawberries and cream and made to look like a real berry. It's absolutely adorable, which is why its lasted this long outside of my stomach but I think tonight's the night!

Miette has delicious macarons. \n\nI'm sure the rest of the stuff they sell is good too. Read the other reviews for that other stuff. All I'm talking about is the delicious macaron. Swoon. \n\nThe meringue cookies are light and chewy when you bite into them. \n\nThe fillings are delicious. They have 7-10 different flavors on any given day -- pistachio, chocolate, chocolate lavender, vanilla, etc. \n\nThe size (larger than normal) is perfect, because, unlike a pringle, you can eat just one. And feel like you've eaten something delicious, and be satisfied. Which, considering macarons are lower in calories than a cupcake or three chocolate chip cookies, is a good thing. \n\nI go for the pure chocolate macaron. That's my thing. \n\nThey lose a star for price -- $1.85 is a bit steep, especially if you're bringing them to a party for dessert or something. Perhaps if the price were lower, I'd eat more of them. Either way, it's a big high. But overall, a great, great thing.", "author": "Tom P."}

My first impression was that the macarons were definitely \"duller\" in appearance than other macarons that I have had before, since they do not use any artificial coloring. I also thought that they only had a few flavors, but they actually had seven flavors: chocolate, chocolate lavendar, hazelnut, pistachio, rose geranium, strawberry, and vanilla. The flavors were pretty apparent and distinct in each macaron, especially in the light cream filing! My absolute favorite part about the macarons though, was their texture--they had the perfect crunchy exterior with a nice and extra chewy interior. It was $1.75 per macaron, but if you buy a dozen, you get one free. They have a few locations in San Francisco, and according to Conde Nast, they are one of the top ten pastry bakeries in the world!

The small selection of macarons are in transparent jars right on the front counter (not the large wall lined with colorful jars). The macarons are $1.75 each and had some normal flavors like vanilla. I bought a pistachio and a rose flavored one as well a piece of mint candy ($.25). There was one staff member in the back working and the one on the floor was \"busy\" behind the counter. She seemed very tired and just wasn't all too cheery and smiley as I've come to know at any Miette location.

The interior of the confiserie looks like it's been spun from the very sugar that has shaped Miette's success, but after tasting their macarons I very swiftly wrote the entire establishment off. It wasn't bad.... just terribly mediocre and unrepresentative of the art form. The raspberry and chocolate confections seemed to match Miette's color palette more with their subdued pinky and brown neutral tones than slap the taster silly both aesthetically and orally with color and flavor. They're... accessory macarons, if you will.\n\nBut fast forward many months, and the sister, being the sweet human being that she is, bestows a gift of Miette's chocolate sabl\u00e9s. They were hardly aesthetic wonders-- they couldn't control these little buggers from smearing moist, rich brown crumb all over the cello bag. Lose your appetite? That's okay; more cookies for me. These shortbread cookies are the end-all, be-all of chocolate baked goods. How Miette has managed to cram in so much butter and cocoa into these petite, still-delicate and subtly-sweet bites with the softest, rubble-y and sandy crumb, I'll never know. And while I usually furiously covet trade secrets of the things I love to eat in hopes of replicating them in the kitchen, as long as Miette promises to keep making these buttery sabl\u00e9s, I won't be foaming at the mouth for answers anytime soon.", "author": "Nuri K."}

The fleur de sel caramel just made it a little bit warmer.\n\nMmmmmmmmmm. If only you could taste that caramel. It was perfect. I have never tasted a caramel more delicious or divine than the one I bought at Miette Confiserie. It wasn't overly sweet. It wasn't too burnt. It wasn't too light or too dark brown. It was just perfect in every way. Plus it wasn't too chewy and it didn't even stick to my teeth. It gave my taste buds a reason to wake up. It even sent a few signals to my brain. The fleur de sel caramel was the caramel of all caramels. I kinda wish I had bought a few more pieces when I was in San Francisco. Oh well. Next trip.\n\nAs I said, a little bit goes a long way. I didn't buy a bag full of candy. I literally bought 4 pieces. Three pieces were Poco Dolce squares and the last was the fleur de sel caramel. Miette Confiserie is a self serve candy store. You can definitely fill a basket with boxes of chocolates, salt water taffy and caramels but you really don't have to. The beauty of Miette is that you can pick just a few pieces to taste the goodness of the overall whole. It's also expensive but worth every penny. The goods here are exquisite!\n\nThe store is beautiful. It's simple, old fashioned and elegant. Hell, I even ate my fleur de sel caramel in a dainty fashion. I nibbled. I didn't gorge, inhale and consume. I guarded the caramel in the paper wrapper it came in, I savored every bite and I licked the last taste of saltiness left on my lips.

There isn't really a word to describe it, other than \"CUTE.\"  The shop has tables of jars filled with candies and baked goods.  Everything is so colorful and so pretty.  \n\nI came in to pick up some gingersnap cookies for my mom, for Mother's Day.  She absolutely loves ginger-y cookies.  And when she tasted these, she agreed with my assessment, that these were \"as good as gingersnaps could be.\"  They are really quite ginger-y; so if you like ginger, then it's worth a try.  You get about a dozen cookies for $7.  \n\nThe service was helpful and quick.  I probably shouldn't be eating so many cookies, but I'm sure I'll be back soon.  I saw a sign that said that macaroons were only $1 from 5-7 (i think); so I'll have to follow up on that.\n\nNotes:\n-The gingersnap cookies are on the 7x7 list.\n-You can't buy only one cookie, but that's okay, you'll want to eat all of them anyway.\n-Parking in the area may be difficult, you just have to get lucky.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Crunchy exterior, chewy interior, and smooth, creamy filling. On top of that, the macarons came in splendidly exotic, floral flavors, like Rose Geranium. From then on, I was hooked [obsessed]. Since then, I've dabbled in macaronage in SF, NY, and Japan, and Miette remains one of my two favorite sources for macarons in the city.\n\nWhat makes Miette better than the rest?\n*The Triple Texture never fails! They are never stale like Bouchon's, and the cookies are sifted less finely than Chantal Guillon, so the slight graininess gives Miette's macarons the chewiness that Chantal's lack. (Plus, because of the textured appearance and lack of coloring, Miette's macarons come across as being very natural...almost healthy! A good excuse to eat them.)\n*They have floral flavors that are appropriately delicate in taste. Chantal Guillon's are overpowering in comparison, or even without comparison.\n*The prevailing filling is unique: Not just smooth and creamy, but also light and delicate! One previous reviewer mentioned that they use buttercream icing. I've never had this type of filling on a macaron anywhere else.\n*AMPLE filling. They may cost $1.75, vs. Chantal's $1.70 and Bouchon's $1.50, but you get more bang for your buck.\n*Wait, what's this, a Macaron Happy Hour, 5-7pm M-F? $1 per macaron for some of the best macarons in the city? Oh my. My inner goddess rejoices.\n*What they could do better: Give me your seasonal flavors year round! *love* Oh yes, and provide cute gift boxes, not Chinese take-out boxes. Please, I have enough of those already in my fridge.\n*Random storage tip: You may store boxed macarons for 1-2 days in the refrigerator.\n*More on Miette: By the way, you might want to check out Miette's ice cream sandwiches as well if you like flavors like Earl Grey. They also have candies in unusual floral flavors as well, such as lavender drops.\n\n[Stop 3 of 4 on my Macaron & Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream excursion in Hayes Valley.]", "author": "Fawn B."}

They are very limited with the customizing, since they don't have the staff to support a gigantic custom wedding cake order.  She gave me the option of doing a 3 tier cake with the disclaimer that it may be difficult to do but it's been done before.

The pastry chef emails me and and gives me her number.  I called her and left a message and emailed her the next day giving her my number.  Another week passes - I still haven't heard back from her.

Service was great and so were the macarons. \n\nSo the thing about the macarons is that they're a bit more rustic than others. That is, they're not perfectly smooth like many you see these days. Instead, they are uneven and have rough edges, and are fatter than most. In addition, the macarons are also a bit drier than normal, and very chewy. I loved the texture, though the flavors are pretty average.\n\nIf you want something a bit more perfect, try Chantal Guillon, which isn't too far from this shop. Their macarons aren't as dry or chewy, and don't have that rustic look. Also, their filling is very soft, which was something I didn't enjoy too much.

As a Candy lover I have to ask....... is it really worth it?\n\nFor me Martha and Miette have always been just a bit too perfect.  Candy is playful, colorful, messy, and fun. It should be a sweet, simple indulgence - not an expensive one. I love treats that take me back to my childhood and remind me of the many carefree and comical moments of my life. I don't remember pretty packaging or pastel pink paint - but I do remember painting my lips pink with lollipops. When it comes to sweets I have simpler tastes and a much smaller purse - I'll stick to the timeless treats I can afford to eat. I've found the Marina's Sweet Dish offers a much larger variety of treats at prices that can't be beat. Both are beautiful stores - but I love being able to pay less for more!\n\nMiette is beautiful - I admire and respect the owners for creating such a sophisticated and stylish store.

We made our way to Paulette Macaroons, Miette, and Patisserie Philippe. \n\nWe literally ordered almost every macaroon flavor each place had to offer (I've been happily munching on them since Saturday) - but we decided to base our macaroon showdown on 2 basic flavors (rose and chocolate) and 1 flavor that was special for that one location.\n\nResults?\n\nCan we say TOTAL KO.\n\nHands down, knock out. The chocolate was SO good at Miette. While Paulette and Philippe had very good chocolate macaroons too - it almost felt like their macaroons were for the milk chocolate lover while Miette had a  chocolate macaroon for a dark chocolate lover, and I am a dark chocolate lover.\n\nThe rose macaroon was another Miette knock out. The rose scent hits you right before you take a bite and there's this subtle rose flavor that's intense without being overpowering. (Philippe's rose macaroon tasted good too - but in a artificially flavored sort of way). \n \nThe special flavor? No need for one. Hands down winner.\n\nIf I HAD to be picky - maybe a few more flavors would be nice (5 flavors last Saturday) and another way to differentiate between all the macaroons would be nice too. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the \"no artificial flavoring' feeling since they don't color their macaroons - but the result is usually the macaroons are beige with the slightest tint of color. Good thing the rose macaroon was so fragrant because there was no way I was differentiating it from the pistachio one... lol. \n\nP.S. - the rose macaroon was my favorite macaroon of the day.\n\nOh, while I'm at it - try the CHAMPAGNE GUMMIES.

I just ate my chocolate cupcake with plain white buttercream frosting. It was likely the lamest cupcake I've ever paid for. First of all, the cupcakes there are very small in size. Second, the pile of frosting on top looks pretty in the display case but is not functional. It is piled way too high on top and not to the edge so it's pretty hard to get frosting in every bite (or you get only frosting bites) which I find very undesirable. Moving past appearance, let's talk about the actual taste: the cupcake was very dry with flaky crumbs and the frosting was one giant clump that just fell off after a couple of bites. Both of these things are cardinal signs of an OLD cupcake. I would guess it was at least 2 days old if not more. There was nothing moist about it whatsoever. The chocolate cake was drab and the buttercream was super bland and boring. It didn't even taste like vanilla. I am a fairly decent baker and I know I can make a better quality cupcake any day. Betty Crocker from a box is likely more appealing. You should be embarrassed, Miette, to sell these cupcakes in your fancy looking storefront.

The candy was all packaged cute, bit the macarons were nothing to write home about.

The transaction had actually been voided, but had not shown up on my account yet (it did, three days later).  \n\nAs for the poorly handled transaction, Crystal spoke to the owners and even to their credit card companies to create a new policy which protects eveyone (including honest customers). She was very kind and on top of it.  She even offered gifts to the kiddos if we would come back in (which we did not accept, but only because getting free stuff for complaining sounds like a bad example to set for the girls).\n\nI have to say I was impressed by how hard they worked to try and make up for our bad experience. I can't give them 5 stars because, well, they made my girl cry, but they were very decent about it afterward and ,really, the place does have some very tasty sweets.\n\n============================================\n\nHorrble horrible experience. I will never, EVER be back.\n\nSunday, the sales person at Miette made my four year old cry. I am not kidding.\n\nWe were vistiing my daughter's sweet little friend who lives in the neighborhood (and her lovely mom).  As a treat, we took them both, plus one other 4 year old in to buy candy and to order 10 cupcakes for a dinner party I was having that night.  The kiddos were very good and super excited to have the pretty little suckers they found. It was actually impressively sweet how good they were. They even waited patiently for 15 mintues while the lady behind the counter filled our cupcake order. \n\nWe got to the cash register and the lady ran my card and all was well...then (AFTER charging me) she asked me for my picture ID (something that had never been asked of me in the 3 or 4 trips there prior).  I looked for it and found that I had taken it out of my wallet (later to be found at home). Despite the fact that I had (1) been there several times before and waited on by that specific lady, (2)  I was with a woman from the neighborhood they knew, AND (3) I was with 3 pre-schoolers who had waited patiently for their chance to have their promised candy... she said \"Well, we have to be careful.\" and refused to sell to me.  \n\nWell, I shoudlnt' say refused to sell it to me. She refused to give me my purchase. She apparently had no problem charging me $40, as it showed up on my card the next day.  I called and they have yet to call me back to refund the money.\n\nMy daughter took it well, but on the way home teared up a bit she was so disappointed. I will never ever go in there again and encourage you to avoid it as well.  Any place that holds itself out as a happy place for  children but is willing to hurt their feelings in a way that flies so in the face of reason does not deserve your business.   \n\nGo to the Candy Store in Russian Hill or Sweetdish in the Marina.", "author": "Shannon W."}

Everything on display is so neatly organized and stacked that you don't want to touch it to mess it up. Many of their candies are in glass jars throughout the store. Since 'V' day is approaching, there's a huge section devoted to the holiday with all kinds of chocolate hearts, etc., The middle table has the exotic and hard to find chocolates, like Vosges 'Mo's Bacon Chocolate Bar' (which, by the way is pretty good)! \n\nMy favorite part of the store is actually the counter area, where all of the cupcakes, chocolate tortes and cakes are displayed. Additionally, there are jars of macarons on top of the counter - JACKPOT!\nOf course, I have no willpower, and bought a cupcake and macarons. The ginger spice cupcake was heavenly, as the cake was super moist, and the frosting was so rich and creamy! I have to say that this is in close competition with my beloved red velvet from Marita's as my all-time favorite cupcake. The macarons were absolutely divine, and are my SF favs! They have the perfect texture and sweetness level, and must buy at least 4 whenever I come here. A super friendly lady helped me and  recommended their special grapefruit flavor. I wasn't totally sold on it at first, as I usually stick to the caramel, hazelnut, coffee, or vanilla, but was open to trying something fruity. Man, I'm so glad I listened to her, as the grapefruit is now my fav! YUM! My worry is that I'll crave it now, and the next time I go there, it won't be available as a new special will take its place! *Did I mention the cute packaging and wrapping that this place has for all of their candy and baked sweets?

She was truly exited to tell me about all of her favorites and even shared some of the chocolate bar that she had just opened up.  She told me about how she travels the world looking for different chocolates to bring back. Talk about a sweet job!\n\nI picked out three of the ones she recommended:\n- Melkesjokolade (for milk chocolate lovers, this is wonderfully creamy)\n- Charles Chocolates Carmalized Crisped Rice in 41% Milk Chocolate (like Crunch bars?

Not only do they have lots and lots of vegan candy, the staff there are consistently helpful and even excited to help me look for tasty things that fit my vegan diet. They've had no problem with going in the back room to read ingredients lists for their bulk items, even on busy days. They're even going as far to start adding a \"vegan\" tag in their inventory database so they can help find things more quickly.\n\nThe owners of the shop have put a lot of love into their new business, and it shows. They're friends with the Blue Bottle crew, who have always helped vegans enjoy a gourmet experience, and they've clearly passed this sensibility along to their friends at Miette.\n\nAnyone who is \"boycotting\" Miette needs to go in and try it for themselves. Miette isn't a penny candy store - it's a gourmet candy shop, so if you don't like their prices, it's a fair criticism.

Sort of like I \"forget\" about the pack of grapefruit Mentos in my bag, or \"forget\" that I stashed a few Sea Salt Caramels in my car (for emergencies only, you understand).\n\nMiette has got to be the prettiest candy store in the world, at least, in the USA.  Everything is displayed just so, coordinated by type or color, and in picture perfect glass jars that just beg you to reach inside and pull out a treat.  Somehow everything matches the pretty vintage wallpaper (oh, if only you could lick it, like in Willy Wonka!)  It's like a movie about a candy store, only you're not watching it, you're starring in it!  \n\nAlong with some hard-to-find European candies, Miette is a must if you are into licorice - they have oodles of different kinds, from the cute to the hard-core.  They have these tiny licorice marshmallows that are very unusual - I love them, but you have to be seriously into licorice to appreciate them.  \n\nThe locally made caramels are now a bit of a legend, and in demand.  They come in regular, burnt caramel, sea salt caramel, and bergamot - all are buttery, smooth, and melt-in-your-mouth-good.  It's hard to know what will be available on a given day, but they try to have at least one variety in stock at all times.  \n\nI have always wondered who buys the enormous jawbreakers - if you have ever seen the movie \"Jawbreaker\", you will understand why I can no longer eat them - and I recently found out that it is the kids from the French-American school.  It's a total fad these days - who knew?\n\nIn addition to candy, the front case is filled with cakes and cupcakes, and my favorite guilty pleasure, macarons.  If you have never had a macaron from Miette, try one.  Even the most die-hard patisserie connoisseur would fall in love with these lovelies.\n\nThe staff has always been very helpful to me, offering tastes of new items or other candies in flavors that I like (a mix of grapefruit and plum Jelly Bellies - delicious).  They can also help you decide between the varieties of chocolate bars offered.\n\nIf you happen to run into me at Miette Confiserie, don't be alarmed if I act confused.

The girl who helped me on my intial shop visit patiently indulged my request for 3-4 pieces each of 10 varieties and this required she make use of the ladder several times. Of course if she were from Finland (thus taller) she wouldn't have needed the ladder and I would have paid for my goods and gotten out of the store a lot quicker. But as I did not mind the additional time spent loitering here I will not withhold another star.\n\nThe licorice, like most of the store's candy, is beautifully displayed in heavy-lidded, sculpted glass jars and arranged atop cabinetry and tiered shelving. \n\nA center table showcases the premium chocolate candy bars (one bar was described thus: \"It's like a Reeses peanut butter cup but ten times better\"; the description held) and all along the front of the service counter you'll find the retro packaged candies and bars. The back wall selection includes the gummy and sour candies. And the gumballs. I'm not a fan but bought a few anyway because I couldn't resist their distinctive colors combined with that smooth roundness. I'd be happy to keep them on display in a jar on a shelf in my own apartment . Ditto the pastel green, pink and yellow color-coated maltballs.\n\nSome reviewers refer to the store's \"whimsy\". While glances about the interior will reveal color and beauty, and produce definite smiles, the feel of the store is more fancy, less fanciful; less whimsical, more refined. \n\nThat's not Gene Wilder spinning madly at the cotton candy machine.

It has an array of original gourmet confections like candy and cookies and even cake!  There was a beautiful sparkly princess cake that looked like a snowball.  It would be perfect for my bday, as I am a princess.\n\nFor the holidays, I noticed some very cute partridge and pear cookies, a giant Christmas tree, as well as chocolate letters that spelled BRRR.\n\nEvery item here is individual and inspired.  You can tell a lot of creativity goes into the goods, which is why it is cool to browse.  It's almost like a museum de candy.  The decor is a gumdrop tree made of real gumdrops!  They had a Vosges chocolate bar with bacon as well as a lollipop that was inspired by said bar.\n\nThey also had a selection of macarons.  I tried the lemon one which had a lovely creamy filling and sweet outside.  I probably couldn't eat many of them, but they do look terribly cute!\n\nIt's great to browse around here and ogle at the wonderful sweets and treats.", "author": "apple r."}

The decor is right out of a vintage children's story book and the sweets range from Pop Rocks and Jelly Bellys to Vosge's Haut Couture chocolate and imported European candies.\n\nThey also have a delicious selection of baked goods. My favorite is the Old Fashion Cupcake because the boiled icing is divine. Light and fluffy, it's the perfect pairing with the moist chocolate cake. (Buttercreams can be a bit too rich for me.)\n\nMy only complaint is the inconsistency of their stock. I've been waiting for them to get more candy coated anise seeds. Apparently there's a hiccup with their distributor. And recently, I purchased a small box of sugar-free fruity hard candies from Switzerland (?) but when I went back again, they were no where to be found. What a tease!\n\nWell, I do have another complaint, but it's more of a request. I would like more fruit flavored/inspired candies. Nougat and chocolate is nice but yawn.\n\nRegardless, this place is still high on my guilty pleasures list. If not just because of the Old Fashion Cupcakes.

Ok, this new candy store is packed with so much fluff it looks like it came straight out of Main Street, Disneyland. If you're allergic to the color pink, do not go in there. I stopped by after hour #3 on opening day. There's so much sugar in the place I felt like my teeth were already starting to rot. But having been slapped with a $300 bill from the dentist recently I restrained myself from picking up every kind of candy there was. I couldn't help myself though, when I spotted my favorite chocolate, Tranquility (lavender milk chocolate) from NewTree, and thank god Miette carries the 3-pieces pack instead of the full bar. I also picked up a pack of Austrian hazelnut wafers and a piece of fig chocolate.\n\nNow, since it was opening day, none of the candies had any descriptions or price tags. There were also no plastic bags or containers to hold your selections. And since there were no price tags, it took the sales clerk a while to find my items in the computer to ring me up.

Like the sweetest stealer of innocence, Caitlin gently led me through the gamut of flavors and textures, starting me off slowly by sampling the milder pieces and building up to the ones that most would consider an acquired taste.  Needless to say, this former licorice hater is now a sugar addled fiend who devours half a pound a week.

I thought that maybe it was just me and perhaps something was amiss outside the store, but I kept smelling goat cheese the entire time I was there.  Weird, but there it was.\n\nI had high hopes for Miette- I had heard about how great the cupcakes were and how cute the place was.  Miette is cute, but very sterile and a little too precious- I didn't particularly feel comfortable browsing through the store and everything just kinda screamed \"Do not touch!\" at me.  Half the time, I couldn't tell whether the candies were for sale or whether they were decorative display.  I wanted to try one of their cupcakes, but they looked surprisingly plastic in the case, and honestly I just didn't feel like paying $3 for those dainty treats.  I did take a gamble on their chocolate fleur de sel caramels...I wanted the plain, but apparently, Easter had wiped out their stocks.  I also bought some Italian gianduja chocolates, which were really difficult to get out of their glass jars- I had to tip the heavy things over to get to them and I really got zero help from the salespeople.  \n\nOverall, Miette is a very grown-up candy store that just doesn't have the friendliness or coziness that I expected.  I liked that they had little tags throughout the star describing the different chocolates and candies, which helped me in my decision process.  3 stars for having some interesting candies, but I think they could do a lot more in helping customers feel comfortable and perhaps in expanding their stock.", "author": "Angela H."}

For ex) If you were to go back in time and take a glimpse into my room as a young'un, a week before Halloween, you'd easily find the previous year's Trick-or-Treat bag STILL chock-full of candy. I don't know what's wrong w/ me, but I tend to shy away from the sugar. However, this past weekend, my sweet tooth awoke w/ one bite of a Macademia Nut Macaroon!\n\nSeeing as how there's so much hype over Miette's coveted macaroons, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about and pick up a few since I was in the neighborhood. And to my surprise... I flipped my LID over these sweet lil' chewy treats! The sugar factor wasn't overwhelming and the Macademia Nut bits were a nice touch. I also tried their Chocolate Macaroons, which were just as satisfying. Now that I'm addicted, I couldn't be anymore thrilled to learn that they're taking over Moonstruck Chocolatier's space in the Marina. Now I can indulge in these puppies whenever I'm looking for a sugar fix!\n\nIf you're not into macaroons, then I'm sure you'll be won over by Miette's cakes. They look like a girl's dream cake! If I could, I'd buy one, set it in the middle of the dining room table, and gaze at it all day. Seriously. They're that adorable.\n\nExtra bonus points go to Miette for their cute & charming design. From the store to the stickers to the paper bags to the website, Miette conveys the fact that they're in the know about maintaining good brand identity.\n\n\nTIP: Stop by Miette if you're looking for something to top off your picnic lunch basket w/ (they've got cute, mini sized cake loaves and cupcakes!) or if you're putting together a gift basket.

You step in, and you're transported back to a delicate and charming childhood that you may never have experienced yourself.

If you're looking for a great hostess gift, try the gingersnaps, chocolate chip cookies, or one of the shortbreads (lemon, walnut, or lavender). At the counter, you'll find a line of nostalgic candies that no doubt get the most comments. My personal favorite is what lies behind the glass case (and in the glass jars): freshly baked cupcakes, mini cakes (like their signature old-fashioned and tomboys), and macarons. Those who like the traditional macaron a La Duree might not love Miette's take, but I prefer these over any other I've tried.

However, I came here on a mission today ~ to compare Miette's macarons with Paulette's side by side.\n\nThis was actually my first time trying the macarons at this location and I thought they were actually chewier than the ones at the Ferry Building = yummier macarons.\n\nNow, comparing them to Paulette's.  I like the chewier texture of Miette's macarons better.  Paulette's macarons crumble once you bite into them.  However, the flavors of the ganache inside Paulette's macarons are much more intense (see my review on Paulette's).\n\nSo whose macarons reign supreme?  Because my first macarons were from Miette (which led me to my obsession with them), they will probably always be my favorite.  Every time I bite into one of them, it feels like I'm transported to a different place...called Heaven *dreamy look on face*  Yummy yum yum!!", "author": "Katelynn L."}

They were actually pretty sour and the gummy part was very different from the usual sour patch. I will be back to stock up on those.

She said, \"You should call 2 days before and we can get it ready, \" as she was making the box to stick the cupcakes. She was totally giving me attitude.

These were much lighter and almost cakey in comparison with the ones from Paulette.

This has become an issue since Hayes Valley provides both Miette and Paulette's. I have come to the conclusion I like them both equally, and here is why I like Miette.\n\nI first fell in love with Miette before I moved to SF and would visit their counter in the Ferry Building. Their macarons are good, but I'm not sure if they are as good as Paulette's, but Miette gets my vote because they bake them in the City instead of having them shipped from Los Angeles like Paulette's. Also, Miette has a variety of other desserts to choose from, in case you aren't feeling the dainty macaron. But, really, go for the Chocolate Lavender and Hazelnut macarons.\n\nThe other thing I love about Miette is their decor. Whereas Paulette's has a decidedly modern approach, Miette makes me feel like I am in a little Parisian patisserie. The quaint and feminine decor is something I have come to value when it comes to my pastries.\n\nIt's not Paris, but Miette is a warm little reminder of that gorgeous city across the Atlantic.

Coincidentally, Saturday was the day I got a $5 allowance to do with as I wished.  Thus, Saturday became Candy Day.  Instead of dissuading me from my budding sugar-addiction, this hastened a binge mentality, and fostered six days of candy-fantasizing.  I grew up in the Mission,  a mere three blocks away from some decent old-fashioned candy at St. Francis ice cream parlor, not to mention the classy european sweets offered by the York Theater, and the usual assortment at a perfectly decent corner store (except the time the owner got shot) within a block.  But, my heart was fixed on a more distant goal: schoolyard legend Ratto's.  Ratto's was, upon surface inspection, just a large corner store near the loathsome El Faro Taqueria.  But any kid in the Mission District knew that Ratto's had EVERYTHING when it came to candy.  What seemed like two full aisles were stocked with all the usual suspects from M&M/Mars, Hershey and Willy Wonka, plus all the bizarre novelty candies (6ft tape gum, squeezy baby-bottle candy goo, candy skeletons) and ethnic delights a kid could want.  But it was just a little too far for me to walk by myself, and no parental figure (out of dozens -- f'n hippies!) around would willingly drive a fat child to buy candy, so... dream on, kiddo. \n\nCut to today, and my adult candy fantasyland, Miette Confiserie.  Now that I'm all growed up and every day is Candy Day, this is where I go to indulge in total sweet abundance.  So what if some of the more obscure and finer items are a little pricey...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-29", "description": "MACARONS!! Mi piace Macarons moltissimo!!\nOK, Macarons are NOT Macaroons. An \"o\" can change everything. Notice, they are completely different animals, or species. Like a cat is not at all like a catfish. One is a cat, another is a fish. Macarons are made with almond flour, powdered sugar, and egg white. And depends on the flavor, different things are added such as cacao powder, ground coffee, ground pistachio, etc. With the flavored italian buttercream in the middle, this delicate little treat is heavenly, if done perfectly perfect. The perfect texture should be lightly crunchy on the surface, because of the egg whites, chewy inside thanks to the sugar and ground almonds, then creamy in the middle from the buttercream. I'm not exaggerating, but I felt like a flower blooming when I take a bite of a perfect macaron. These heavenly treats originated in France I believe, but it's loved by many of the royal members in Europe. Macaroons are American treats that are made with coconut flakes. \n\nMy favorite flavors are pistachio, rose, chocolate lavender, and hazelnut. Sadly, rose and chocolate lavender are out of season now. Why are Macarons so expensive about everywhere that they are sold? Many say that they are extremely hard to make, because it requires the professional oven and tools. It is not entirely true because I made them in my college dorm kitchen and they turned out great. I did notice that they are extremely hard to keep in the perfect condition. Any change of temperature or humidity could damage the texture that they might turn into some marshmallows....well, not quite as bad. And they are expensive to make for sure.\n\nRemember Carry brought Miranda a bag of chocolate from Payard in Sex and the city? These macarons are MUCH better than the ones from Payard.\n\nI love miette, and if you are a girl, or have a sweet tooth, or have a nice childhood would love it too. It's a confiserie, which means, LOTS of candies!!! Most of the candies there are imported from European countries. And better yet, if it's not busy in the store, you can ask to sample almost all of them!! Get the rose water cotton candy, and they'll make it for you!! It's amazing. The violet drops are super too.\n\nYes it is a bit over priced. Especially a candy cane that costs $4. But it's a place that sells a dream, a feeling. Unlike Godiva or Starbucks, the things at Miette are with very high quality if not the highest. Godiva charges ridiculous amount for chocolate that I refuse to swallow, as well as Starbuck's coffee.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

The sales associate recommended buying their marshmallows (which were extremely soft and yes, i squeezed them) to make the best smores ever. That is a good idea for a simple dinner party dessert!\n\nAlso bought ginger snaps. Four stars instead of five comes from expecting the ginger snaps to be AMAZING. The texture threw me off a bit since I was expecting them to be crisp, but it may have been the half hour they were sitting in a warm car that affected the texture. \n\nI wish I bought some chocolate! Because of the unusually HOT weather in the city this week and flying back to San Diego today, I chose not to buy any chocolate that would probably melt during the trip. Chocolate lovers beware!

I went here to get macaroons since Paulette's macaroon shop wasn't open at the time.  I tried the chocolate orange, hazelnut, rose, and pistachio.  They were much thicker and denser than Paulette's and though they were still good, they were not as authentic as the ones I've had in France.", "author": "Grace M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-04", "description": "Before I write my little review, let me just say that hateful, slanderous, and personal attacks (like the one recently posted) don't belong here.  This is a place where \"useful,\" \"funny,\" and \"cool\" are the only comment options available short of full-on flagging (which this one probably deserves).  So.... If you have a personality conflict with someone maybe you should address it in an adult fashion (read: less cowardly) instead of libeling them in a public place where they have little or no recourse to defend themselves against what are obviously your personal issues.\n\nThat said....    [music shifts from sad cello solo to bubblegum pop]\n\nLa!\n\n    Well, I've been stopping by Miette (Confiserie) regularly since they opened to quell my addiction for all things sour and gummy - Sour Trout, Danish Sour Belts, Gummy Smurfs, Peaches, Root Beer barrels, Cherries, Colas....  need I go on?  Of course by now I have also managed to \"sample\" their fresh, local, and organic various macarons, old-fashioned cupcakes, lime tarts, fleur-de-sel and burnt caramels, absinthe lollipops, French nougat, cotton candy, fine dark chocolate tiles with burnt caramel and grey sea salt..... again - could go on.  Suffice it to say you won't be disappointed with the selection.  Quite honestly, anyone who doesn't feel lucky to have such a place in their neighborhood, nay, CITY - just doesn't know what's good for them. \n\n   Miette Confiserie is the Honest-to-God apotheosis of sweets. Which is to say they take their fare quite seriously (they make their own pastries, which are incredible), but they also understand that candy and cake is a fun, frivolous treat and should be an all-around lighthearted and wonderful experience.  So, for instance, not only do they carry an amazing range of exotic licorices  - they have an entire wall of it - but they have it beautifully displayed in old-fashioned glass jars along with a very thorough menu.  Having a hard time deciding?  Ask one of the  young ladies behind the counter (nicely) and they will gladly give you the Famed Licorice Tour, then personally wrap up whatever you decide you might like (even if it's just a little tiny bag).   Sound awful?  You really should go to Wal-Store instead.   Sound delightful?  You are correct - it sure is.   Not only is everything they carry high-quality, it is offered to you so beautifully and elegantly that you might actually have to pinch yourself.   Did I mention that your personal Candy Heaven is (of course) accompanied by young ladies who love candy and pastries maybe even more than you do (and therefore know a lot about it).  This is your chance to revisit your childhood, this time casting yourself in an elegant Parisian film, finally replacing your own local candy store where the old guy with the long dirty fingernails reached in and grabbed you a couple handfuls of Swedish fish.  \nYeah.  Really.       \nI know.\n\nCripes, this little place'll rock your candy-lovin' WORLD. \n\nP.S.  Please treat these ladies well, as they work extremely hard to keep this place so timelessly elegant and beautiful.  Again kids, this ain't Wal-Mart.  It's not what you're used to - it's better.", "author": "Sam W."}

Everything is cute, tidy, pastel and just simply adorable. They have all kinds of licorice, candy, chocolate... everything looks CUTE! i wanted to buy one of everything to try.\n\ni'm a french macaroon fan, so i was happy there were 6 flavors on display in the big glass jars looking oh-so-pretty.\nThat day they had: lemon, vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, and pistacio.\nI got the hazelnut, pistacio and lemon to try ... they were all good, so it's like asking me which one is my favorite child. but if i must choose, then my favorite is the pistacio, then lemon, then hazelnut.\n\njust as i was able to leave, next to a door i saw a container of chocolate 'candy's in colorful wrapping - the description says every candy comes with some text that's supposed to be a joke in it. kind of like bazooka joe gum, or the Baci dark italian chocolates. it's cute but the text is in french, and it's rather hard to translate the context of a joke... but the chocolate was yummy.\n\ni love Miette... the little store is so quaint i felt like i stepped into a storybook. a definite stop for the foodie and those with a sweet tooth.", "author": "amy c."}

For one second.  I mean, the presentation was just so ridiculous and pretentious and perfect it made me sick.  And all of the people who work there are perfectly coiffed with perfect skin, hair, uber hip etc.  Over it.  YET, if you dig a little deeper, there is so much more there and I have to berate myself for being so closed minded and judgmental.  \nI reliably and repeatedly buy the black licorice here.  What a selection.  Incredible.  I almost laughed at the one salesperson, who while helping me with the licorice, referred to one type as \"salt forward\".  Yet then I tried it, and guess what, it WAS.  So yes the black lic is fantastic fantastic and I love the salty and the sweet and that tasty chalk, yum.\nToday I went to buy a holiday present and I was blown away by all of the new candy.  Yes it's expensive, but my is it tasty.  The people who work there are so NICE, and well, I do love the place, even though I want to hate it.

She sure knew how to completely ignore me and talk to the only other bitch in the place about how they chose the wallpaper for the store and also, her flat redecoration plans with her lubby hubby.  Cute!  When i asked (very sweetly asked, I might add.  Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am super charming adorable on the outside and all hell hath no fury inside.  but i digress.), \"What's vegan?\" she told me they had some licorice.  that's it.  i then went on to inquire, \"are the dark chocolate malt balls vegan?\" and she answered, \"huh, i don't know.  they might say on the package in back.\"  AND THAT WAS THAT.  oh wait, no.  she told me that she was inclined to believe that they are vegan but wasn't sure.  she didn't offer to go look or extend any assistance in picking anything else out.  listen, bitch.  if you're going to sell this fat girl who is on a ridiculous candy time in candy town binge some powerfully overpriced sweets, you're gonna have to work a leeeeeetle harder.  And yes, I may be dressed like your friendly neighborhood bird lady but mama is packing a fire in her belly and some heat in her wallet.  and by fire, i mean an entire el farolito burrito and by heat, i mean a crisp ten dollar bill.  LET'S DO BUSINESS!  \n\nanyway, i ended up picking out some goodies for my parents because god knows, they could give a fuck if dead baby panda was in their candy.  I chose a scrumdidiliumptious Charles' Chocolate Bar for myself because I am familiar with it and know it's vegan.  and i only know that because the smart and lovely folks at Chocolate Covered on 24th st tell you what's what when it comes to vegan chocolate.  or any chocolate for that matter because they are true candy lovers and their selection is infinitely better as i'm sure is the case with many other chocolate/candy shops in the bay area i'm just not familiar with them so i can't give you any names and in conclusion, BACK OFF LEAVE ME ALONE.\n\ni would probably give this place two stars if it wasn't independently owned but i do have a soft spot for the little guy (or the waspy white lady, in this case) and i know it's expensive and very difficult to open a business so i really do hope they are able to stock their shelves with a bigger selection in the future and maybe employ some folks who are truly passionate about delicious candy.  at this point, i would only go back if i were in the neighborhood and in the mood to be ignored and um, wanted a piece of australian licorice.  that i can get at trader joe's for ten times cheaper.  \n\nalso, this might just be me and it probably is but i really don't like being sold candy by a skinny white b*tch...there is just something so false about it.  i want my candy lady to be plump, rosy cheeked and wearing a pink gingham apron.  call me a bigot but whatever.\n\nUpdate: fuck it, one star.  I was harassed by the owner's f*cktard boyfriend for my review...further proving that customer service and Miette, they don't go hand in hand.

Step inside Miette and you will feel like you've entered Willie Wonka's chocolate factory, only better since there are other options besides chocolate. Treats here range from candy in jars to cupcakes and cookies. Everything is insanely cute, and you will find many tiny goodies already packaged in delightful boxes. The counter is filled with the baked goods- cakes, cupcakes and my all time favorite macarons. Gen opted for the cupcakes, as these nearly rivaled Delessio in terms of creativity. One of the chocolate varieties came topped with a soft meringue.  I of course went for an assortment of macarons- chocolate, strawberry, hazelnut, almond, and pistachio. We carried our loot wrapped in cute green boxes over to a cafe across the street to enjoy along side a cup of my all time favorite blue bottle coffee (which you will find tucked away on Linden street). Not a bad way to spend a lazy warm afternoon.", "author": "Kate A."}

I spotted their display of gorgeous cupckaes amidst the maddening crowds at the Ferry Building market. That tasting experience blew away all NY cupcakery competitors to date. Near perfection, in fact. So, to discover their candy store in Ha(Yes!) Valley (sorry, couldn't resist poking fun at one of the worst n'hood tourism campaign slogans ever) was like stumbling upon a free discography of Iron Maiden LPs as a teenager... or something similarly sweet. Michelle M. had already tipped us off, praising their licorice collection. There was chocolate, hard candy, petite baked goods, gummies, nuts, etc. - everything a good confiserie should stock - and they really love their products. A very friendly and knowledgeable staffer gave us a lengthy tasting tour of all 18 varieties of licorice on the wall. That took 15 minutes alone. It was tempting to extend the tour to the next section of the store, but we decided not to take advantage. It was hard to leave... everyone in the joint was smiling ear to ear, including us. But we bought our bag of goodies and headed out into the real, slightly less sweet world beyond their doors.", "author": "Dan B."}

Then, you meet Miette, the sweet store promising the perfect blend of childhood sugar highs and mature, refined taste. You may be drawn by the confections from far away lands or the absolutely flawless, whispy yet substantially palette-pleasing shortbreads (as is for purists, or enhanced with walnuts, lavender, and other flavors for heathen) made fresh here. Either way, you know you'll be back, already rationalizing that the two-block walk to your car will burn off the indulgent calories.", "author": "Geo G."}

UltraMan status rich. thats rich, mind you. so cheesey but had JUST enough sweet to make it dessert level of cheese, feel it? cool.\nvery moist and very filling. it was so flavorful that it very much satisfied me once i was through. \nthe macaroons come in an assortment of flavors. soft texture after you get passed the harder exterior (which is not a bad thing though it may sound bad? hmm) ive had the pistachio, rose, chocolate, and orange Macs from this place. a litttllleee pricey again. but the quality is wonderful and the shop is  just like WOW like sooOOooO cute! eeee! haahhhh.\ncheck it out. \nhayes valley area is the b e s t.\nbring cash.", "author": "Spencer P."}

Macarons are supposed to light and soft, with a thin crispy shell and a slight amount of chewiness as you bite into the ganache filling.  These macarons are so chewy that it felt like I was biting into a candy bar.  The filling was also weak, which was very disappointing since I chose naturally strong flavors like grapefruit.", "author": "P B."}
