I wasn't suuuuper wowed by my food here - ordered the shakshuka even though their speciality is definitely the chicken and waffles. The shakshuka was tasty but definitely not the best I've had. It wasn't as stew-y as I would have liked and could definitely use some extra herbs and spices. I actually enjoyed the pita & hummus more so because like previous people have said, there seems to be lot of labor and love put into perfecting their hummus. There's so much flavor and the texture is just the right about of creaminess and smoothness. If I wasn't so full after eating so much pita, I would have eaten the hummus by the spoonful.. gotta better prioritize next time haha\n\nMy friend ordered the nasi goreng topped with fried chicken; she said that while she personally enjoyed the chicken and it lives up to its reputation, the rice was a little lacking in flavor. Next time, I think I'd definitely order one of their dishes with their chicken in it. \n\nService was pretty good. It definitely wasn't super busy on Friday afternoon so there was a lot of time for the employees to make their rounds and check in on us and making sure we were stocked up on pita (always appreciated!). We lucked on parking so definitely be prepared to circle around the block as it is a busy neighborhood to find a space.", "author": "Samantha C."}

Fried chicken is one of his favorites. He liked it with the fried rice. I thought the chicken was decent but not the best I've ever tasted. I had turkey bacon with a horrible tasting biscuit which was dry and weird. As if it was dipped in stale oil. My breakfast wasn't memorable.  \n\nThere wasn't a lot of customers in the place so it was quiet. A single unisex bathroom right in front of us .

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "I was extremely disappointed in this place. After reading such positive reviews and seeing pictures of the food, it looked like a solid choice for brunch on this beautiful Sunday. \n\nTHE WAIT: After joining the wait list on yelp and waiting for about an hour before we were seated, and when we were finally seated we found out we had to order at the counter. It took another 40 mins to get our food after ordering. \n\nFOOD: My party of 4 had the chicken and waffles, the chicken sandwich, Indonesian fried rice, and matcha French toast. I was shocked with the chicken and the French toast -- not in a good way. Though the chicken was cooked well and was nice and crispy, it hardly had any flavor. I'm not sure how they prepare the chicken but I really think it would benefit from a brine... whether it be buttermilk or otherwise and addition flavor on the reading. It wasn't salty enough and again, lacked flavor. With so many places in sf and in the greater Bay Area that serve chicken and waffles, I feel like they really missed the mark and missed an opportunity here. The waffle was okay, pretty dense-- if that's what you like, but nothing special. The syrup was standard as well. \n\nThe match French toast, I was really excited about, was poorly executed. It was soggy, also lacked flavor-- I couldn't taste any matcha. I feel like it would have benefited from sprinkling a matcha/powdered sugar on top or even doing a matcha whipped cream -- very easy things that would definitely elevate the dish. Also I believe choosing a thicker bread that holds would have been better. Again, it was really soggy... and then on top of that putting a runny whipped cream and macerated fruit (which included grapes... which I think is a weird choice since grapes are expensive and typically aren't good warm) made it even worse. The whipped cream looked and tasted like it was from the can... Also I think the fruit had some kind of herb? That definitely did not go with matcha.... though matcha French toast is unique, there are so many ways to execute it and get even more creative and this definitely was not it. It's obvious that it wasn't well thought out. \n\nThe chicken sandwich was also disappointing. The bun was average, but it looked flattened (probably when cooked) and the slaw was okay, but there was no sauce!!! Which was really strange to me... it's the same chicken as the chicken and waffles I believe and it again lacked flavor... they should include an aioli or something... again, I was disappointed and feel like not enough thought was put into this dish and the opportunity to elevate it wasn't taken advantage of. \n\nSERVICE: service was fine, nothing special. \n\nENVIRONMENT: it was a pretty small space and got pretty loud in there. Definitely felt crammed... but it didn't bother me. \n\nSUMMARY: overall there's a lot of areas of improvement... I was disappointed. There's so many cute places in the area... I'd go there instead.", "author": "Kaitlyn E."}

No line, the place had maybe 4 tables occupied maybe 7 as we left.\n\nThe food was DELICIOUS. we spilt the chicken/waffles and got a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. I am a new Englander so I always come prepared and BYOPMS (Bring My Own Pure Maple Syrup). But not necessary - not only do they serve it - they give you a BIG portion (unlike Plow sometimes).\n\nHere is the .5 star off reason.  I had a big brunch and wanted to use the bathroom, there was a guy taking his sweet time mopping the floor - with the bathroom door wide open to the restaurant. I swear he was doing it for over 20 mins. I finally left without getting to use it - but the table next to me also wanted to use it. Can't you get that done prior to open, or maybe at closing time the day before?", "author": "Amy W."}

A fairly new business so I won't ding stars just yet, but they do need to work on a few things...but first let me tell you the good.\n\nWe ordered the chicken and waffles - YUM, lemon ricotta pancakes - YUM, and the Nasi Goreng - YUM. The chicken was crispy on the outside with delicious spices and tender inside and boneless which I personally love. The pancake was nice and thick and you can taste the flavors which is always a plus. The Nasi Goreng has more crispy chicken but with an interesting rice to accompany it, super flavorful. Water was served right away as well as coffee.\n\nThings to work on - Waitlist, once this gets bad you probably shouldn't seat tables that don't have everyone in the party present yet. Refills on coffee, maybe more staff could help with this. Finally, I couldn't get over the order at the cashier and take a number and go back to your table protocol.

Arrived at a full site with happy customers. Husband and I knew immediately what we wanted since we were drooling over the menu yesterday. I got the shakshouka and he got the soujouk scramble.\n\nThe owners and staff are quite welcoming. We also received a complimentary hummus platter which was not only aesthetically pleasing with the essential hummus, oil, olives and a hot sauce but the taste was so addicting! As husband had put it, the hummus was not boring as most places make it but quite flavorful. I even ate the black and green olives and loved it! There were a few pita triangles that accompanied it-perhaps a few more would even out the delish hummus.\n\nAhh, the shakshouka! Cutely plated on its own porcelain skillet-with eggs, herbs and a few pita triangles. The only minus to this for me personally was that it was more soupy requiring a spoon rather than a stew or sauce with a fork. The taste otherwise was delicious! Quite hearty, flavorful and nicely textured chunkiness of tomatoes and onions. Just a tad too bit liquid-y for my fork.\n\nI also tasted the husband's soujouk scramble which was with scallions, tasty potatoes and pita triangles. It was a good mixture of sausage and egg proportion.\n\nI also had the fortune to have their iced green matcha tea which was really refreshing and something I would definitely try again.\n\nThe waffles and syrup looked and smelt so good!! We were teased by the waiter with it when he was looking for the customer who ordered it. The fried chicken looks really good as well. The person next to me had a Benedict with the fried chicken and said it was good but surprisingly spicy for her. I would probably try the Nasi goreng, fried chicken or waffles next time.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to coming here again. Really enjoyed the ambiance and space. In a nice trendy area with other interesting restaurants. As I look around, the restaurant keeps filling up with no empty seat! \n\nThank you, Cracked and Battered for entering the SF restaurant scene and for giving us awesome diverse dishes to happily consume!

Probably won't be back anytime soon.\n\n.....\nService:\nBoyfriend and I stood in line to order and when we were two customers away from the cashier, the waitress comes up to us to write our names down, saying we must wait outside and that she'll call our names. That was not the case for the people before us. Some of the people behind us grabbed a table before ordering but she didn't seem to notice them. \n\nWe waited attentively two feet from the entrance, expecting a short wait as we were first or second on the list. A few minutes later she called a name for a table of two--the couple she called actually stood behind us but we let it go. Then another two parties were welcomed in, and I see her crossing out names below ours. We confronted her and she was like 'oh yea I called your name...' (Not at all apologetic).\n\nMaybe she did call our names inside the restaurant but she definitely did NOT come outside to call our names. Clearly she didn't know what she was doing and was inconsistent with implementing her waiting system.\n\nGood to know she let a total of 7 people \"cut\" in front of us which resulted in us not being able to order the nitro matcha that ran out right before we ordered. Not a huge deal but it added to our already unpleasant experience. \n\nWe sat next to the couple who was after us and watched them finish their meals before we even got ours. \n........\nElse:\n\nThe menu was pretty unique, and the place has more seating than Plow. Pricey for a place that is pay up front. \n\nI would not recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes if you are looking for something fluffy, lemony, and ricotta-y. These pancakes were normal pancakes; the first three bites had a slight lemon aftertaste and the ricotta was very subtle if anything. The butter and syrup might have overpowered the flavors even more. \n\nWeightlifters Delight was ok. The egg white scramble was juicy which threw off the texture for me though I still enjoyed it. Lots of pepper and sausage chunks. Potatoes were pretty tasty with some fried onion bits thrown over it. Unsure what the four flimsy pita was for as there was no dip, no sauce, no hummus, and no flavor. \n\nNasi Goreng, or the cabbage fried rice with chicken was my favorite. It was also substantial. Pretty good flavors though it could have used more cabbage. The fried chicken was dry but well seasoned.", "author": "Lydia Z."}

I'm usually around the 743rd person to review a newish place because I just hate dealing with crowds, but this wasn't the case here as I happened to be traipsing in the 'hood and found this spot relatively empty on a weekday afternoon. It's on the corner of 18th and Connecticut where the usually bustling Aperto was. I had no idea Aperto shuttered its doors, but hell, I'm off pasta anyway.\n\nThey have quite an international array of menu items like the $14.50 Nasi Goreng, an Indonesian cabbage fried rice, and the $13 Moroccan favorite, Shakshouka. But the top line dish was obviously the $16 Chicken and Waffles which I saw on a couple of tables. Alas, I decided to focus on the Light Plated Stuff listed in the menu. I went with the $12 Fattoush Salad, a plate which mixed fresh elements such as kale, romaine, parsley, mint leaves, sumac, onion, tomatoes, olives, and cucumbers with toasted pita chips.\n\nThe problem with had with the dish was that it was absolutely drenched in a puckery oil-lemon vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/2v25Xmo). The flavor ended up overwhelming the salad, and I should have gone with my gut and ordered the dressing on the side. Just because I wanted something sweet as a contrast, I ordered the $4 Seasonal Fruit, which was a plate of just fresh blueberries infused with lemon rose water (photo: http://bit.ly/2v3CAAh). Simple but it worked. The service was certainly sincere, and I think I'll give them another try when I feel more calorically confident.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...nice try on the salad but ease off on the vinaigrette\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...less packed than it was as Aperto with rustic touches providing a hipster edge\nSERVICE - 4 stars...affable and attentive \nTOTAL - 3 stars...global brunch concept is appealing, I expect more menu choices after their soft opening phase\n\nRELATED - Collection of breakfast and brunch places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2At2LFz", "author": "Ed U."}

The matcha has no added sugar in it, which I love, but if you realize you don't actually like matcha then you better sweeten that sucker up or order something else.\n\nIt was near close and the chef sent over a house hummus- which was really delicious (and satisfied my craving because I was originally considering going Mediterranean for brunch). I am intrigued as to how the Middle Eastern cuisine is going to blend with what seems like a very typically American breakfast menu.\n\nChicken & Waffle - the chicken was super juicy, definitely used dark meat (smart choice). The waffle is on the fluffier side, which I typically like a thinner waffle personally (but like I said, soft opening, got to play around with it).

I don't want to be that \"person\" after all the great reviews and I understand that they're still new after all...\n\nFirst off, the wait was not too bad in the beginning. My fiance and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon at around 1pm and the wait was 15 minutes, give or take. We were seated and given the menus and had to go up to order and pay. I wanted lemon ricotta pancakes but also wanted chicken. The lady was nice enough to accommodate my wishes by making my dish like a chicken and waffles. My fiance got the regular chicken and waffles ($16). I was starving and borderline \"hangry\". The wait for food was around 20 minutes and I kept in mind that this was a soft opening so I tried not to get too agitated if the wait was a bit long but... When I got my food I was pretty disappointed.\n\nMy chicken had great texture, it was crispy and soft inside, but it had no flavor at all. I'm not sure if they forgot to season it because everything else was great (texture wise). My lemon ricotta was also pretty bland and was overtaken by the ricotta cheese over the sweetness and lemon flavor. The texture was also pretty great. Normally, when I eat food and I am super the hungry ... I would love the food. I was really disappointed in the lack of flavor considering this. \n\nOverall, the people were great, nice location, decent parking, but the food did not impress me.", "author": "Lyra C."}

Wait list: I used the yelp waitlist feature from my house. By the time I grabbed a lyft and arrived we we seated within 2 minutes. There were about 20 people in line. I hope more places use this feature since it felt good not to have to wait. \nEnvironment: Inside it was surprisingly small, but quaint and cute. We sat at a counter facing the street. Everyone was busy and tables were turning over fast. We ordered at the counter and got a number for our table. It worked because waiters weren't floating around asking if we were ready to order and we didn't have to wait around for our check after the meal.  Menu: interesting twists on favorites all around. I had Cabbage Fried Rice with Fried Chicken that came with 2 eggs over easy. My friend had the Ricotta Pancakes and a side of potatoes. She ate it all but complained the potatoes were SUPER spicy. I ate half my dish and wished i could take it home because it was so good. The fried chicken was spicy too. It's the same chicken they use for the Chicken and waffles so I would try that next time. I saw some paper signs mentioning mimosas but we resisted day drinking because we were planning a day of hiking. Nice addition to the brunch scene. I will be back.", "author": "Marcy H."}

It's a unique place that serves more than just your average white people breakfast foods, by incorporating dishes from Middle Eastern/Asian cultures along with your classic American brunch dishes like eggs benny, waffles, etc. Ok side rant but honestly people need to be more risky with trying new foods, because I sat by the window and saw so many people walk by, glance at the menu, probably saw the ~shockingly hard to pronounce~ names of ethnic dishes and keep walking. lmao ok but you just missed out on this amazing brunch place. \n\nIt's a laid-back cafe-style brunch place where you order at the counter and seat yourself. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and responsive. You can tell they care about every aspect of your experience here. They even gave us a hummus on the house.\n\nWe got the chicken & waffles (which is famous here) and the shakshouka. The shakshouka consisted of two poached eggs on a bed of sauce made of tomatoes and other veggies/herbs, and some pita slices. I normally don't get meatless dishes because I need my meat ficcs in order to feel satisfied but this dish was soooo satisfying. If you love tomatoes and eggs, you will love this dish, which is the most heavenly mixture of the two. \n\nThe chicken & waffles were also so good and holds up to the hype. The chicken is super crispy and perfectly salted, and the portions are very large. The waffle is also not overly buttered so it feels much lighter and less fatty, which I love.", "author": "Brittany H."}

I came on a slightly busy Sunday and thought it would benefit us by putting our name on the waitlist via yelp before We even came. We still ended up waiting for at least 45 minutes when there were several open tables inside. When we were finally seated, we had to get back up to order at the counter which is a little disappointing. Now on to the food - I ordered the chicken & waffle which could have been amazing had they not used chicken THIGHS! I mean yuck!! The chicken is seasoned and fried perfectly, but the meat inside is super gummy and I would prefer a breast. The waffle was alright. My partner ordered the burger which he liked but complained of how messy it was. We also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes which our baby loved! Pretty popular place but I say come and have your own experience. I won't be back", "author": "Ashley W."}

The chicken was absolutely delicious: crispy outside, well-seasoned, and perfect inside. My son had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were good but a bit heavy - a few more minutes on the griddle would have been good. I had the shakshouka, which was also delicious - perfect eggs, flavorful tomato sauce, and good pita. \n\nWhat was really outstanding was the service. Everyone we talked to was helpful & friendly, and whenever we needed anything they seemed to be right there. \n\nWhat was really above and beyond was this: my six year old does not like butter, I mean like really not at all. We didn't realize that the pancake would come with a big knob of butter on top, so as soon as I saw it, I lifted it up with my fork to keep it from melting into the hot pancake. Then I realized I had nowhere to put it... just as I was looking for a place to put it, one of the servers saw me looking around and came to the rescue. He was beyond gracious. It's a small thing, but it shows a level of commitment and attention that is not common and that I deeply appreciate.", "author": "Meghan C."}

The batter on the chicken was crispy and quite good, the waffle was flavorful (although I wish it was a little more crispy), and I liked the shashouka as well. Would definitely come again! Since it's still in soft opening mode there was no wait on a Saturday at 9:30.", "author": "Jen K."}

The cashier was picking his nose staring off into space when I walked up and didn't say anything.  Received my Midnight burger and it was soaked in grease and fell apart after the first bite.  Wife had the farmers breakfast - scrambled with turkey sausage but instead got an omelette with bacon.  There was three or four hairs my wife found in her food.  Used the rest room which they store their grease trap for the food in there with all of their their mops and extra cleaning supplies - they probably use the same mops in the kitchen.  Would not come back or recommend this place.", "author": "Leahcim S."}

I happen to stumble upon this one Sunday afternoon with some friends. We were seated and sort of waited around for like 5 minutes before they gave us a menu. No one told us that we ordered at the counter until another few minutes. I ordered the $16 Fried Chicken Benedict and was excited until I was given me my order. They ran out of potatoes so said, \"we ran out of potatoes so we GAVE you a salad.\" It would of been nice to be told that they ran out and given options of a replacement. It was definitely not worth the $16. Overall food is OK, but service definitely needs to be worked on.", "author": "Mayra A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-12", "description": "Went here today for breakfast and got the eggs benedict with fried chicken. It wasn't terrible, but there wasn't much flavor to the chicken or egg. For $16, you actually only get one egg to spread over both biscuits. This was pretty confusing given the cost and that the egg is the most important part of eggs Benedict. They are still in the opening phases though, so hopefully they refine some of these things in the future. I also think the price point is a little high (it's easily $50 for two people for breakfast) given that everything is self-serve here and you order at the counter.\n\nUpdate: the owner reached out and it sounds like they are working on some of these issues, which is great! Hope the kinks get worked out.", "author": "Amy B."}

The fried chicken on a biscuit with eggs Benedict on top served with potatoes was good although we thought the sauce was a little lemony. The Shakouka was awesome (we had to get extra pita as the sauce was so good ) the scramble was good, and the chicken and waffles were bangin'!  I wish it would have been full service.  All in all this is a great place with some unique spins on traditional breakfast food.  Highly reccomend!!!", "author": "Anthony D."}

The buckwheat pancake was mushy with dried fruit in it, super sour. The eggs were slimy. The turkey sausage tasted like store bought frozen links. The person next to us complained that the plates did not come out at the same time. When the waitress told the cook, he gave a nasty look. The person on the other side of us said that the food smelled like rubber. There was this strange order at the counter thing, which was awkward. Def not worth the price.", "author": "Michael R."}

I don't like chicken, however the chicken here was the best chicken I have had in a very long time. The chicken and waffle is an odd but an extremely complementary dish. My only complaint is that they took more than 30min to bring out our food. There was only one other group in the restaurant. I'm hoping this was just because it is new and still the soft opening. I wish this restaurant the best of luck!", "author": "Amelia S."}
