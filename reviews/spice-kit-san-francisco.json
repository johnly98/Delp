Spice Kit has a great central downtown SF location, so don't expect to find parking easily if you're driving into town.\n\nI've only gotten the Five-Spice Vietnamese bowls or Korean bowls; both are solid options. The food is very flavorful and healthy-ish - you won't find your meal swimming in excess oil like some other restaurants. I usually add a bit of Sriracha from the nearby cabinet for some extra kick \n(You'll find the nearby cabinet to hold more Sriracha in one spot than you've ever seen before). I do find the portions a bit small, though the food is fairly priced for downtown SF prices.\n\nThe lunch line can get very long around 12/12:30ish, but it moves pretty quickly. Overall, Spice Kit is a great spot to swing by for affordable tasty food!", "author": "Ganeev S."}

It's kind of like Chipotle, but with good Asian flavors!  Pick the form: sandwich, Korean Bowl, Viet Bowl, or Salad.  Pick a protein: Pork, Chicken, Beef --  all Asian-ish marinated.  \n\nI picked Korean Bowl with Chicken.  It was very tasty and juicy and a healthy, fresh portion of shredded zucchinis and bean sprouts.  The hubs got the sandwich.  He enjoyed it.  I thought the pickles in the sandwich felt a bit harsh (compared to what you get at other nearby Viet places).  I def enjoyed and preferred my Korean bowl.\n\nWe also got two pork bao cause I read good reviews for it.  The boas are kind of small, so 2 for $5 is reasonable.  I would have felt ripped off if I had gotten it at 1 for $3.75.  The meat is tasty & juicy in the bao and the seasoning was nice with two slices of pickles.  Chalk it up to: quality ingredients come at a price, I guess.\n\nOverall, a very solid lunch option in Soma.", "author": "Kathryn C."}

Despite being one of my go-to places, the quality of the food isn't spectacular. \n\nTypically I order their Korean bowl with lemongrass pork. The dish itself is usually a bit too oily and the pork had hints of the lemongrass smell but could really benefit from being marinated longer. The rest of the dish is complemented with assorted toppings like kind of julienned cucumbers, sesame oil tossed bean sprouts and some lettuce. These toppings are good to help soak up the oiliness of the lemongrass pork. Additionally this dish will usually have their kimchi rice included which also acts as another way to soak up the oily pork but helps provide a sweet sour contrast to the dish. \n\nThe main thing is the food is decent. The kimchi rice seems to be a little too soft, could really improve from using maybe a day old rice or even just popping it on a wok to crispen up. All in all, I tend to come back mostly because the prices hover around $10 range but would suggest other places if you don't like your food to be overly oily.", "author": "Ryan F."}

This is Chipotle-style Asian food, meaning you choose the method (sandwich, wrap, Vietnamese bowl, Korean bowl), you choose the protein (chicken, pork, beef, tofu), and you choose additions (sous-vide egg and pate). Our favorites? The wrap, which is a Vietnamese spring roll style rice wrap only burrito-sized, and the Korean bowl. The beef was by far the best protein.\n\nThe great thing about coming in the evening is that they're not very busy so you get very personal service. Here's where I give my shout-out to Jack (working the register 4/15/15 in the evening), who was so nice to us! He...\n- Was super cheerful and enthusiastic. Gave great recs.\n- Let me bring my bike in.\n- Gave us samples of the beef and tofu when we were wavering. \n- Comp'ed my meal because so many things I was asking for were out! (See my receipt: )\n- Had us sit when we ordered and brought our food out to us when it was ready.\n- Gave each of us a free box of ginger paste.\n- Let us hang out and talk way past closing time. \n\nThe downside to coming so late is that they end up being out of so many things. The breakfast items look fantastic but, obviously, they're only served in the morning. My friend got the last coconut juice (they buy 13 coconuts and make 8 cups a day, fresh!). They were out of lotus chips. \n\nMUST-HAVES: 1st choice on method: Korean Bowl. 2nd choice: Wrap. Beef is the best protein, tofu is pretty good too.

I'm always up for some Asian grub and when I heard it was the Korean style Chipotle, I was super excited!\n\nWhen you enter the joint, you get that modern feel. Concrete floors, minimal walls, exposed ceilings. The place gave off that industrial feel. When it came to ordering, there were 4 steps:\n\n1. Choose your style: Sandwich, Wrap, Salad, Korean Bowl or Vietnamese Bowl\n2. Choose your filling: Five Spice Chicken for $7.75, Kalbi Beef for $8.75, Lemongrass Pork for $8.25, or Chili Garlic Tofu for $7.25. At this step, you could also add an egg or pate. \n3. Choose your sides: upcharge of various items\n4. Choose your drinks: only if applicable\n\nFor lunch, I got the Kalbi beef Korean bowl with an extra side of chicken for an extra charge of $1.50, EXCEPT, when I got back to my desk, there was no chicken :( They forgot to add that into my bowl or gave me someone else's bowl. I was pretty livid but since it was about 4 blocks away, I wasn't gonna walk back just for $1.50. Based on what I did have, the bowl came with chunks of kalbi, julienne cucumbers, seasoned rice, kim chi, marinated bean sprouts and their signature sauce. The bowl was ok. I didn't care for the taste of the sprouts. It almost seemed like it sat out for a while.The kalbi had a nice flavor but was a bit dry. I liked the rice and the cucumbers brought a fresh flavor to the dish. \n\nOverall, the place was just ok. I'm sure I'll be back in the future but I wouldn't necessarily rate this at the top of my list.

In reality it's cubes of tofu cut smaller than dice and fried until they're the texture and taste of shoe leather. All you can taste is oil. The salad itself wasn't terrible, jicama was a nice crunch and the dressing was good. \n\nOnto the pork belly bun. If you've ever had one of these from the Chairman Bao truck you know what a delight it can be.. but that's another review. Spice Kit's buns are ghetto wrapped in aluminum foil like something forgotten in the back of my fridge. When I order pork belly I don't expect it to be light but got a hunk of 65% flavorless fat and 35% flavorless meat. Pork belly should be braised, instead this just had a smear of hoisin sauce on a stale bun. I tossed it after one bite.", "author": "Emily H."}

I would probably say that this place may be the Asian version of Chipotle, but probably takes a different route than what Starry Kitchen does down in Los Angeles.\n\nInstead of the usual vessels that was listed, I went with the Vietnamese bowl, and to be honest, I didn't read what the description said about the bowl, besides that a lot of vegetables was in this dish that wasn't a salad. For my protein, the default beef choice, which was Korean Beef BBQ. And after seeing so many people rave about the lotus chips, I decided to get an order, except they ran out that day and offered taro chips, which I said, why not?\n\nTo coin the term, \"Yelp Elite cult\" item, I would have to say the taro chips is probably a good definition of it; the taro chips reminded me of a potato chip, with an extra punch of earthiness, and not overall greasy that you would feel sick to your stomach eating more than one serving.\n\nThe Vietnamese bowl was a rice bowl, with a choice of pickled veggies, along with a thick fish sauce, kind of reminded me of a vermicelli style dish, except with rice. I give Spice Kit props for making the fish sauce correctly, and not skimping on the flavor. I do get that fish sauce is a bit intimating because of the salty fishy taste, Spice Kit carried that flavor by combing some sweet and spicy flavors to it, like the usual fish sauce you would get from Vietnamese places, except it's a bit more on the thicker side, which complements the rice bowl perfectly.\n\nProbably a go-to place for a quick bit to eat, and the entire meal costing me under $11 is always a plus.", "author": "Tom T."}

I was going to order my lunch at the JapaCurry truck across the street but the line was huge and  I was going to have a heavy dose of carb heavy rice plus pork tonkatsu plus curry poured on top.   Yeah very healthy...so Spice Kit across the street beckoned to me.   So I jaywalked across Howard St and went in.\n\nThe concept is very Chipotle-ish except that this place isn't fake Mexican food.  I decided to go healthy getting a salad with pork and then I splurged on getting a poached egg with my salad.  Yes salad...egg yolk on top of salad.    I'm usually the type of guy who orders his eggs scrambled for breakfast or gets an omelette.  Egg yolk is still something I'm getting used to.  But oddly enough, it worked.  It was like a supplemental dressing to go with the salad dressing.\n\nThe total damage came out to just over $9 which is about standard for any decent place in this area.  The salad was filling and the pork was tasty.  Another healthy eating temptation has been hurdled!\n\nI'll probably be seeing Spice Kit more often as my company will likely be moving closer to this intersection soon.

Price point is reasonable considering ingredient quality and the service has always been really friendly and helpful, even when there's a crowd.\n\nMy all-time favorite dish to order is the pork bun: fatty, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly with a pat of hoisin on a fluffy bun with a slice of pickled cucumber for the perfect acidic contrast.  This paired with the short rib rice bowl, lotus chips, and limeade is my favorite lunch combination. The kimchi rice has just the right amount of spice so it doesn't compete with the flavor of the meat, and the short ribs balance garlic and sweetness perfectly.\n\nThey also have a solid breakfast menu.  My favorite is the breakfast bun (bacon, spiced eggs, gingery hoisin), paired with turnip cake and poached eggs.\n\nOverall, Spice Kit is a great casual restaurant offering fast food that is actually well-balanced in flavor and uses high quality ingredients.

I tasted some pork by itself and it had some nice spices and flavor, but they were completely overpowered by the other ingredients. The pate also didn't seem worth it for the amount I got. \n\nThe overall flavor profile was way off. I've never complained of too many veggies in a banh mi before, but in hindsight I should have just ditched half or more of the veggies which probably would have helped the taste balance.\n\nThe iced coffee also disappointed First it was weak coffee and tasted watery. Second, if you're going to serve these things to go please mix in the condensed milk for me.

So excited I wasted little time and had lunch there on Tuesday.\n\nI managed to get in and get my food order in just before the afternoon lunch rush.  I wanted to try a little of everything so I ordered the Roasted Pork banh mi, a Steamed Pork (belly) Bun, Lotus Chips and a Calamansi Lime-ade.  The wait for food was actually surprisingly fast.\n\nThere is seating inside for about 20 with additional seating outside.  I grabbed an indoor seat and dug in.  I started with a sip of the Calamansi Lime-ade, and it was very refreshing.  It's taste was not very lime-like though, but it was definitely citrusy with just a tinge of tartness.\n\nThe Steamed Pork Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#jOb0-QlFTTW-R7RNKuuxVA) was very good.  I got two rather large pieces of pork belly in mine.  Thinly sliced cucumber, sweetened hoisin sauce and chopped green onion accompany the meat inside a steamed clamshell bun.  The pork belly was soft and tender and had very good flavor.  \n\nI liked the Lotus Chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#_mjb6qgySqyI3jUa3BBlcg) a lot.  I've often had lotus root in soups and stir-frys, but this was my first time experiencing it sliced and deep fried.  More accurately the lotus root is shaved super thin, deep-fried then lightly salted.  The result was super crispy chips that seemed very light even after the frying oil soaked into the root.\n\nThe portion of meat in the Roasted Pork Banh Mi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spice-kit-san-francisco#kAHTEjgTR6W8Imomg2dpAg) was very generous.  I ordered it with pate which costs extra.  This was definitely one of the pricier Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had, but aside from the cost I thought this was very good too.  I wasn't very fond of the drippy mayo, but the ingredients were very fresh.  The crunchy vegetables include pickled carrots and daikon, thinly sliced cucumber, jalapeno pepper slices and fresh cilantro.  I do wish there were more of the latter two ingredients especially the cilantro which they seemed to skimp on.  The pate was quite flavorful as was the roast pork which was moist and tender with nice charred spots on the outside.  The sandwich was served on a fresh, chewy roll that was nice and crusty.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try the beef short ribs and the five spice chicken.  Perhaps I'll even try a Korean wrap.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

An owner who was a disciple of Thomas Keller's at French Laundry and per se. A chef from the Ritz Carlton Dining Room. An effort to replicate an Asian street food stand that would make Anthony Bourdain proud. And it's really close to my workplace to boot. Damn. It was merely OK. Granted they're only three days into their operation, but damn.\n\nThe stepwise menu is short and sweet. You pick one of three forms - the tradtional Vietnamese bahn mi, a semi-transparent Korean-style wrap called a ssam, or a salad for the carb-averse. Then you choose one of five tantalizing fillings. Despite stiff compettion from personal favorites like the five-spice chicken and the grilled pork belly, I went for the braised beef short rib in a bahn mi for $7.95 (see photo). Jamie W. ordered the chicken in a ssam, also $7.95 (see photo).\n\nBoth of us received little cubes of marinated meat flecking the filling. Mine was a bit better since the flavor of the beef came though, but Jamie's was more like a burrito wanna-be with barely-there chicken ovewhelmed by the lettuce and rice. A good dousing of the bottled chili sauce helped flavor both up immeasurably. I also had the $1.95 Ginger-Peanut Slaw, which I liked since it had a heavy ginger taste counterbalanced by the crunch of the pulverized peanuts (see photo). Just wish the serving was a bit bigger for the price.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back because proximity is important to me, and the service was friendly. I went around 8:45PM this evening, so there was no line. I can well imagine waiting and meeting colleagues accidentally as I was thinking I was talking behind their backs. I hate when that happens. There isn't much seating in the place, a few tables for two on the side, a couple of counters in front, so expect to take it to go.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the right elements but not gelling yet...the bahn mi is too bready, the ssam too ricey...the stars will align of these days\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...honestly looks like a fro-yo shop rather than a street food stand\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and helpful\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'm pulling for this one to improve and work over time...I'm getting tired of Cafe Venue!", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-29", "description": "The food: the banh mi sandwich and the drinks get 4 stars, BUT the ssam and pork bun were a disappointment for me. I think ratings will vary depending on what u ordered, and how well the food is prepared. I expected better from former French Laundry and Ritz Carlton cooks.\n\nThis Asian (Viet-Korean-Chinese) concept is modeled after the Chipotle chain, but prices are slightly more expensive. They have a list of proteins (\"ingredients\" - chicken, beef, pork, tofu) that u can order as a ban mi sandwich, a Korean burrito, or a salad. Plus a few side dishes and asian drinks. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t6ad76DjjInmQAiMn_k0rQ/l\n\nThe Thai iced tea was perfect, not overly sweet, well made. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DMpFLDIqJNzp9bvMPO5vXw/l\n\nThe sandwich was good overall. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wD_zm-2p9aY3tUAUF0WZUA/l Good crunchy baguette bread, the pickled veggies were crunchy but a bit mild for me, and the meat was tender and flavorful. Only one of the basic banh mi ingredients was missing: the liver pate - it costs 75 cents EXTRA (nickel and dime schemes annoy me). I guess people who dislike pate won't mind this. Why short change customers? Most banh mi shops in SF include pate by default, no extra charges to jack up the price. Maybe they think that downtown office workers don't know any better.\n\nThis ssam was like a Korean burrito - Korean meat, kimchee, veggies and rice wrapped in Viet rice paper, http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/28nYWTQOqaKFDzQR3hYdfQ/l, though the one I got was very poorly wrapped. It was open on the bottom, almost fell apart as soon as I tried to lift it. You're supposed to eat ssam with your hands (real ssam is like the Chinese lettuce cups dish). Clearly the kitchen staff needs more practice or better training. There was a lot of kimchee, not enough meat, and the rice was a little overcooked. This was just their first week open. Not impressed. I suggest that they offer a rice plate option instead, it'd be easier for the kitchen staff to assemble.\n\nThe pork bun (2.95 or 2/$5) was another let down. The meat portion was minimal and that pork belly was soggy and thin. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-1w_AE5ViUPY5z5He_mqlA/l Hoisin sauce was fine, but the tiny portion looked really sad. It reminded me of that famous \"Where's the Beef?\" commercial. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug75diEyiA0 My suggestion to improve that: fry that pork belly (thicker cut, and careful not to overcook it), so u get a slightly crispy texture, saltiness, and better contrast. AND put more meat on that bun!!\n\nThis food concept has good potential, so I hope that this review is helpful in pointing out the issues that need to be addressed.\n\nOther side dishes on the menu are Lotus chips ($1.50, called \"renkon chips\" elsewhere) and a ginger-peanut slaw ($1.95).\n\nI did recognize that all the meats I sampled were very tender and moist. That's because this is the first quick service shop in SF that uses sous-vide techniques to slow-cook their meats in vacuum bags (normally only found at fine dining restaurants).\n\nNapkins, plastic utensils and sriracha hot sauce are available next to the soda machine.\n\nThis somewhat hidden shop is located on the open plaza of the Orrick Building. The outdoor tables are a nice dining option on sunny days. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0X--SN_XOmRAkljM1WZe3w/l\n\nHours: M-F 10:30am-8pm; Sat 10:30am-3pm\nClosed Sundays", "author": "Luis C."}

It's wrapped in soft rice paper and stuffed with a meat of your choice, kimchi, lettuce, sprouts and rice. I always ask for less rice and more lettuce/sprouts. The wrap is huge but with just a little bit of rice, I have no problem finishing the wrap and not falling into severe food coma. The vegetables are so fresh and the flavors in this are so good.\n\nLotus Chips: Makes me feel healthier because i'm eating \"lotus root\" but yeah, I know, it's just like potato chips. Really fresh, cripsy and good!\n\nFive Spice Chicken Salad: Their salads here are HUGE! I am always stuffed after finishing a whole salad. Portions are great, meats are seasoned well and toppings in the salad are plentiful and interesting.\n\nI highly recommend this place! There are only 4 or 5 tables, so I wouldn't recommend coming here for a sit down meal, although you could.

The only problem is that their wraps are really... not great.\n\nThe last time I came here, I ordered the beef wrap.  Think of a Vietnamese spring roll, but huge.  That's exactly what their wrap is.  It's a burrito with that see-through coating, which is quite a strange texture.\n\nThe wrap is quite easy to break.  The contents inside of my wrap started flying around everywhere as I was biting into it.  The meat inside was not really tender, or special.  Most of the times when I'm eating a wrap, I look forward to biting into the meat.  With this wrap, I kinda wanted to avoid it.\n\nOverall, come to this restaurant if you want something fast, but don't expect much.", "author": "Andrew H."}

You can taste the quality of their ingredients. However, there were sandwich construction issues.\n\nThe set up is reminiscent of Chipotle (probably not what they want you to think of) where you choose your protein and then the style (bowl, wrap/ssam or banh mi). They're very efficient, even faster than Chipotle. It took me 4 minutes to get my banh mi and that included toasting the baguette.\n\n* Roasted pork banh mi ($7.75): the toasted baguette is light, crispy, soft on the inside - very nice. The sandwich was stuffed with an ample amount of meat and veggies (so much so that it's hard to eat/things fall out). Big tender pork cubes were delicious and warm, with grilled flavor and some very enjoyable fatty bits. The pickled carrots and daikon were very tangy (I'd prefer them a bit sweeter) and the cucumbers were not crunchy (sliced too thin). The bread gets slightly soggy quickly. I added housemade pate which was good but bland. Mayo, jalapenos and cilantro were included.\n\nThe abundance of roasted pork and quality ingredients make this a better than average banh mi.", "author": "Lolia S."}

The beef short rib needed more beef for an 8 dollar sandwich and the meat needed to be hot. Flavor was okay, but nothing fantastic.\n\nThe pork bun was barely warm and disappointing. I am used to momofuku buns and I wasnt at all expecting this to be on that level. But lets be honest, the buns should be freshly steamed, otherwise they arent any good. The charm of the buns should be that they are fluffy when fresh, when they are pre-prepared and just sit there they become a little sad and stiff.\n\nAnd the meat itself was disappointing because its \"grilled\". For pork belly to really have that juiciness and tenderness it needs to be roasted. \n\nI realize its a lot of work (i make my own at home) but honestly you could roast them in advance in huge slabs and cut and reheat on a flat top and would be much better than what they are serving at spice kit.\n\nNot sure if i got them on a bad day, but it appeared that they sort of have an assembly line making the food so it got cold before it got to me.\n\nI'll update my review after i try them again.", "author": "Ken W."}

Yes, David Chang's version at Momofuki Ssam Bar is still tops in my book, but I'm pleased as punch that I can walk down the street from my office and get a damn good pork belly bun for less than $3.

Duh it's not authentic because they are trying to innovate!  And of course the price is higher because of more expensive rent, better culinary trained talent and higher quality ingredients than you'll find an ethnic ghetto!!!  But seriously, what other take away lunch joints are going to sell sous vide cooked then grilled short ribs?  No comparison to some $3 antibiotic-pumped caged chicken Vietnamese sandwich served with a side of crackhead.\n\nBeef Shortribs: This is the top item to try here.  Apparently they sous vide the shortrib for 24 hours to get it tender without losing flavor then they put it on the grill for smoky char.  You'll notice huge slabs being grilled when you walk in.  Tastes amazing, way more tender than typical kalbi.\n\nRoasted Pork: Soft and full of spices.  Way better than those cheap joints that just microwave some tough pork.\n\nSsam: Shouldn't this be called ssambap since there is rice inside?  A light lettuce wrap with your protein choice (pick shortribs), rice, kimchi and some other veggies all encompassed by a huge rice paper wrap.  I don't believe traditional ssams use rice paper, but this did help make it more manageable to eat at a desk.  Kind of like a super-sized summer roll.\n\nBanh Mi: I like that the baguette is closer to a baguette than most of those fat hoagie rolls around town.  However, I still feel Lee's has the best bread.  Could have been spicier.  The pickled veggies were standard.  The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was totally worth the 75 cent add-on since it was of French charcuterie plate quality as opposed to that cheap spread stuff you get in Little Saigon.\n\nPork Bun: It's great that places in San Francisco are catching on to the bun sandwich finally.  The pork belly was nice and tender with good glaze, but could have been crisped a bit more.  The pickled cucumber slices were a nice crunch contrast.  Kind of small though.\n\nLotus Chips: Yummy!  Cool to have chips with holes in them.  When deep fried, kind of tastes like any other tuber.  Definitely a more thematic side than curly fries.", "author": "Adam B."}

So reminds me of Chipotle when you walk in because of how the menu items are displayed. \n\nYou basically pick between a Bahn Mi, Wrap, Salad, then what type of meat you want- Five Spice Chicken, Short Ribs, or Pork.  They had fried chicken today for limited amount. \n\nI've only had the wrap here which is basically a big spring roll with rice, sprouts, meat, etc.  There is just way too much rice in it but the meat is always juicy. \n\nTried to be fancy today and asked for Bahn Mi contents in the wrap- not so good.

Banh Mi\n2. Pate(forgot it on my first order!)\n3. Short Ribs\n4. Vietnamese Iced Coffee\n-----------I DID TRY THESE AS WELL-----------\n5. Lotus Chips\n6. Pork Bun\n7. Thai Iced Tea\n\nCrazy delicious? -YESSIR\n\nThe number 18... I stared it down since that was my order number.  #18 just barely legal... I got 8 good minutes of staring it down before I heard her name called. Will the founder called her name and I took my walk up to the counter with her in my hand.\n\nWhen I traded my slip for my banh mi, I felt the warmth of the bread through the wrapper just like hitting to 2nd base with a warm apple pie!\n\nUnraveling the wrapper was more than a momentary experience, it was like I had a time-stop effect of opening a golden treasure chest.  The short rib literally smacked my eyes dead on like a sucker punch of meat.  It was packed with meat cubes, one even tried to run away from me, but I caught it and packed it back with the family using the age old 5-second rule.\n\nFirst bite... ~~~CRUNCH~~~ Wow! You know it is good when you make it out of the first bite with a cut to the gum, like when you throw a Dorito chip sideways and it hits the roof of your mouth!  Tears of joy hit me as I hit the soft moist succulent meat of the short rib pranced around my tongue.  The medium rare beef was perfect... not too red not too brown... medium pink? WoOoHoOo! I loved it just like how I love my burgers!\n\nThe Vietnamese Iced Coffee was great! I must first admit to the audience that I am not a coffee drinker... I do not live by the 3 cups per day code so take this part of the review with a grain of salt.  I felt the sweetness / bitterness was a perfect blend.  I am a sucker for condensed milk and I think that was in there, unless there is something else that reminds me of condensed milk.  I killed my drink so fast and so furious that it was gone in 60 seconds.  I made my co-worker that I dragged with me do a double-take.\n\nAnyways to conclude:\n-Ordered food at 11:08am, received food at 11:16am +||+AWESOME+||+\n-Cushy indoor seating with awesome possum outdoor view\n-Friendly cashier and staff\n-Awesome food and a very different banh-mi taste from all the other spots I have tried\n-Price is right for the FiDi, but I can only do this 2x a week max (baller on a budget), but definitely once a week!\n\nMy pro tip: 2 Pork buns are a great substitute for lunch as well! They are \"crazy delicious!\"\n\nNext time I will definitely try \"Ssam\" other item on the menu... like that Korean Wrap dealio.

I work right around the corner from Spice Kit, and also visit the chiropractor right across the street, so this is a once-a-month venture for me.  My favorite menu item is the beef short ribs in either the Ssam or salad.  When I'm feeling a cheat day, I'll go with the Ssam.  They load this thing with rice, and I usually resort to using a fork rather than dealing with rice spilling all over the place.  Not that this is a bad thing, it's just a lot for me.  In both the salad and Ssam situation, there is a less than desirable ratio of meat to rice (greens for the salad).  I only say this because I absolutely LOVE the flavors from the beef short ribs.  Absolutely incredible marinade and flavors that would be best magnified if the ratios were a little more reasonable.  In addition, this place gets sort of busy at lunch, so calling ahead of time helps you cut the line.  I've seen the line go out the door for Spice Kit, but as much as I like this, I'd rather go down the street and pick up something else rather than wait around.", "author": "Lisa I."}

The pork bun was similarly excellent. A gentleman behind the counter brought me over a free order of Lotus chips. They were good as well. It was all good.

I tried the Korean wrap, which turned out to be essentially a burrito-sized spring roll; having rice paper instead of torilla was both interesting and ultimately appealing. I was also very impressed by the lemongrass pork that filled my wrap; I want to try the other meat options now, also. Sadly, this tastiness was tainted by the disappointing Thai iced tea. Not only was it thin and lacking in spices, but it came pre-stirred... perhaps to hide the dearth of cream? Still, I was impressed by their environmental ethic - nearly every piece of cutlery, serving dishes, and other products are compostable in the clearly marked receptical. \n\nThe most pleasant surprise to discover, though, was the extremely comfortable, padded bar chairs for counter eating - far more appealing than the hard, bare wood banquette seats.

While he's arguably the best at what he does (playing basketball) he could truly be transcendental if he put his head down and put all of his energy into playing basketball (instead of trying to be Mr. Cool). \n\nAnyways, that's what I thought of SpiceKit (or as my friend cleverly called Kimchi-potle). Instead of going all the way and using robust Asian flavors, I feel like the flavors were rather subdued (in the same manner that Chipotle turns the volume down on Mexican flavors) in an effort to capture a broader audience. That is the Kimchi wasn't as bold or spicy enough; and the short ribs while tender weren't flavored enough. I tried the wrap which in my opinion lacked an element that should have unified all the ingredients. A fermented bean paste or gojujang would've really done it.\n\nIn the same manner that LeBron has fallen short of a championship, SpiceKit misses the mark. But like LeBron that doesn't mean it isn't good in its own way. It still brings a fresh taste and unique interpretation that has some universal appeal.\n\nBut for me, what could've (and should've) been great is only good.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

After much contemplation, I decided to go for a wrap with the vegetarian option (marinated tofu), and a pork belly bun.\n\nThe wrap was large, but it was overpowered by the kimchi.  My bites alternated between being too kimchi and too much rice, which dulled every other flavor.  TOO much rice, not enough tofu, which was very tasty.  I would've been pissed if I'd ordered it with the short ribs and then not gotten a decent amount in my wrap.\n\nThe pork belly bun was flavorful but at $2.95 for three small bites, definitely not worth it in my mind.

This is what Vietnamese coffee tastes like.  It is strong and sweet and full of flavor.  The bland, gray water you are slinging is offensive, and came out so fast that it must have been in a pitcher, not the traditional slow-drip brew that imparts so much richness and character.  Yours tastes like diner coffee.\n\nSecond, go to Muffins Muffins.  It's only a couple blocks away.  Their banh mi are better than yours.  They are also half the price.  Please notice how their pate does not cost extra, since it's a standard feature of Vietnamese sandwiches.  What you are doing is akin to charging extra for ketchup on a burger.  \n\nTheir pickled veg is also a more manageable size and shape, not the medusa hair you are slapping down, which is  pretty, but not functional. Your pickles are also too sweet.  I don't want dessert in my sandwich.  You might as well be using doughnuts instead of a baguette.  On that note, your baguette is particularly narrow and hard.  I thought your baguettes were supposed to be one of the ways you justified the high cost of your street food.  \n\nPlease do something about your peppers too.  I don't know if they are just extra small and spicy, or if it is a placement issue, or simply lack of abundance of all the other ingredient (kind of a skimpy sammie) to balance them out, but I was getting alternating bites of no spice, and too much spice. \n\nThe pork buns are spectacular and save you from a 1 star review!", "author": "Quinn S."}

My friend ordered some of their pork buns and I had one of those, as well as the Thai Iced Tea.\n\nThe Thai Tea was good, nothing extremely out of the ordinary - the only mild complaint was that it may be a tad sweeter than I'm used to.  The bun, small and compact, was about $2.00.  It was tasty (the pork belly was delish) but alas went by too quickly.  Luckily I already had half a sandwich before, so I wasn't relying on a small bun as my whole meal.\n\nOverall, I liked it.  The best in the world?  Mmm, not quite.  There are some kinks that they have to work on (the speed of fulfilling orders, for example -- they looked really stressed and there was a line despite the fact that it was after the lunch rush) and it'd be nice if portions were bigger.  \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend to at least stop and try the pork buns.", "author": "Shay F."}

Decide what vehicle you want for the meaty star of the show (options include the trappings of Korean burrito, Viet sandwich, salad, etc), choose your meat (chicken, pork, beef), and how clever is it that drinks and side are steps 3 and 4? Easily smoothing the process for you to pick up those extras and thus spend more. Combine the menu with the sleek aesthetic of the spacious, glass-walled interior, and Spice Kit reminds me a lot of another painfully hip and slightly overpriced FiDi lunch spot, Sushirrito. \n\nBut that's not to say that I don't like Spice Kit. In fact, I'm very fond of their fresh and eclectic ingredients. The Korean burrito is wrapped in clear rice paper, and the salad features minced jicama and mango. Their breakfast sandwiches are tiny, but the smoked bacon they use is so rich and juicy that I thought it was duck at first.

So come out and support Spice Kit; with growing support, Spice Kit can become the next (Asian-form of) Chipotle!?\n\nAs for their food, Spice Kit serves banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), ssam (Korean/Vietnamese wraps/spring rolls), and salads with your choice of Five Spice Chicken, Short Ribs, Roasted Pork, Vegetarian, or Roasted Pork Belly with their own respective prices $6-$8 (similar to Chipotle). They also have sides of lotus chips, slaw, and pork buns.\n\nWe had the roasted pork banh mi w/ extra pate (+$0.75), the short rib ssam, and the pork buns (2 for $5). They were sold out of the lotus chips :(\n\nThe banh mi (DISCLAIMER: I'm Vietnamese and can be a snob when it comes to Vietnamese food) was okay... the bread could have been a bit more toasted, the meat more flavorful, and the pate more complimenting (I would suggest passing on adding the pate, it doesn't add anything to the experience). I could have found yummier and cheaper else where but it was good for an Americanized attempt at authentic banh mi. \n\nThe ssam (traditionally a Korean Wrap of meat&kimchi in lettuce) reminded me of an Asian burrito with Korean and Vietnamese influences.. it was cucumber, red leaf lettuce, rice, choice of meat, bean sprouts, kimchi, and some sauce in rice paper.. it was pretty satisfying and I would definitely get it again.\n\nThe pork buns were reminiscent of pecking duck but with grilled pork belly (which was cooked perfectly and tasted great!) and cucumbers, scallions, and hoisin sauce. Definite yum!\n\nOVERALL, Spice Kit serves up great quality foods fast that cater to the 'American' palette, they're a great healthy alternative to your everyday McD's + associates, and you should come try them out/support them!", "author": "Lana N."}

After spending a year and half working in the culinary wasteland that is San Mateo, I was transferred to an office in the financial district.  My (lunch) future's so bright, I've gotta wear bibs!  \n\nSpice kit is a treasure.  Historically, I've passed on the Vietnamese sandwich.  I'm just not a big sandwich guy.  When you decrease the cleanliness factor and add some carrots and cucumbers as per the norm at most purveyors, my midday gusto becomes something akin to George Costanza after a cold swim.  (I was in the pool!)  Spice kit goes a different route, following a model reminiscent of chipotle.  You choose your meat from either Chicken, Short Rib, Pork or Veggie and then decide if you want a Bahn-mi (sandwich), ssam (wrap), bowl or salad.  There are couple other options, but they keep it pretty straightforward.  Thank you Chipotle model!  \n\nMy first encounter with the bahn-mi, was predominately shaped on recommendation.  It was a delicious French roll, topped w/ greens, sliced jalapeno, chicken, cucumber, carrots, cilantro and a little mayo.  I added the optional Pate.  I'm not even sure how to describe it.  Pure delicious.  The chicken is just the right warmth to slightly heat up the veggies so that everything is that perfect temp a sandwich should be and all the different flavors come together well.  I like adding a little sri-racha to kick things up a touch.\n\nThe real gem though is the ssam, which is the lovechild of a spring roll and a burrito.  Check it:   rice paper wrap, red leaf lettuce, kimchi, marinated sprouts, rice, cucumber and your choice of meat filling.  At first, I thought it sounded crazy, but it was so DAAAMNED good.  I will be returning for seconds shortly.  \n\nOh, and if you just want a delectable little taste - go for the pork bun which features a deliciously creamy piece of pork belly on a tasty bun.  Enjoy!!", "author": "Chad K."}

Softer baguettes and special meat do not justify spending $5 more than what I'd normally spend at a majority of other Vietnamese sandwiches I can get elsewhere (especially in the south bay).  Mentioning the meat, I got the short rib, which was tender, but not marinated enough to be special.  Also, with all the Vietnamese sandwiches I've eaten in my day, there's a lot more jalapenos (I had 1) and other produce, without the dousing of mayonnaise to compensate.  Now don't get me wrong..I love mayo, but feel it's not as necessary nor does it add a lot of value to a banh mi.  \n\nOh, and to add insult to injury, I also am compelled to pass along feedback that the wraps fell apart too easily and that it was difficult to eat.", "author": "Jeff N."}

The bun is SO soft, just as all steamed chinese-esque buns should be :). The pork belly is super tender and fatty, and the delicate flavors simply complement each other quite nicely. \n\nIt's a bit pricey for what it is...but, it's really tasty,  and I'm pretty impressed with the concept of selling it as a snack! So major props to the owners. \n\n2) Lotus chips ($1.50) - underwhelmed and disappointed by this one. They're just so thinly sliced, fried, and salted that there's just no flavor profile of the lotus present. It's just greasy shards of salt. Sadly, I did not finish my serving...I'd imagine it would be much more exciting if they tried deep frying thicker cuts to enhance what it is. Maybe like...Lotus fries! \n\n3) Vietnamese Coffee ($2.95) -- Authentically made, with the condensed milk and all :). TOTALLY a reward after the sweaty trek from work on a hot day! + The caffeine fix!\n\nALL in ALL: Get 2 pork belly bun (for $5) and a Vietnamese Coffee.

I don't know if it quite lived up to our expectations though.  \n\nLet me start by saying that the quality of the ingredients are really good.  I had the pork banh mi and the pork was well done, the vegetable fresh.  It has a lot of potential.  But maybe it was because we were here on the first day, but there was something missing from the finished product.   Had it been my first time trying pork banh mi, I might have loved it, but there was something missing in the overall flavoring of the sandwich.  Nevermind that at over $8 (got it with the pate), it is extremely expensive for mediocre sandwich.  Also, the pate kind of got lost in the sandwich.  Couldn't taste it at all.  \n\nI also tried the pork bun.  It was a little more impressed by it.  Though, it really didn't look like a pork bun.  I wasn't sure about cucumbers in it, but they actually tasted pretty good.  \n\nSo, overall this place didn't quite live up to its expectations.  I would give it a lower score, but I think there's a lot of potential for this place.  Like I said, the ingredients are fresh and delicious.  Also, everyone there was so nice and friendly.\n\nI'll probably give it another shot.  Everyone seems to be raving about the short ribs and ssam.

I'm glad we hit this place our first night, as it would become a go-to choice from the rest of the trip. The concept is simple: choose a sandwich, wrap, or salad as the platform and then choose a protein. We had two b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches, one with roasted pork and one with beef shortribs. This was my first foray into b\u00e1nh m\u00ec territory. It's a Vietnamese sandwich traditionally garnished with liver pate, mayonnaise, a slaw of pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, and cilantro. The shortribs weren't bad, but the roasted pork was perfect. The acid in the slaw cuts through the fat of the pate and pork and adds a nice, bright note. I have had dreams about that pork b\u00e1nh m\u00ec since then, and have already located a recipe for pate that I want to try making soon. If Out the Door didn't have proximity going for it, I suspect Spice Kit would have become our default choice for a quick meal.\n\nWe also ordered some steamed pork buns. My experience with the dish in the past has been a soft, pillowy dough which completely surrounded a chopped pork filling similar to what you might find in an egg roll, only a bit sweeter. The Spice Kit take on them is a grilled slab of pork belly basted with hoisin and some veggies. They were delicious, but I'll admit that I was far too enamored with the b\u00e1nh m\u00ec to get terribly excited about them. For those keeping score at home, roasted pork + pate is greater than pork belly alone.\n\nWe also got an order of the ginger peanut slaw to share. It was fine, though barely registered compared to pork buns and other porky goodness.", "author": "Ryan C."}

I noted that the rice bowl was heavy on the rice and light on everything else. But this review isn't so much about the food, but about the customer service.  \n\nOne day soon after my initial Spice Kit lunch test, I walked by there on the way to work and noticed that they had an open soda fountain with a water lever for water.  And I thought that maybe instead of asking the Peet's people to fill my water bottle could just fill it myself at the fountain.  So I walked up to the counter and asked if I could fill my water bottle.  The person I was directed to was the owner/manager, who said sure, with a smile.  So I stopped by a second time, maybe a few days later, on the way to work and asked the person at the register if I could fill my water bottle. She looked back at the owner, then nodded and said yes.  The third time I just kind of assumed it was okay, and said \"Hey, I'm just going to fill my water bottle\" and headed over to do that.  The fourth time (so this is maybe over the course of 3 weeks?) I just went straight to the fountain because I was thinking this wasn't an issue for them.  Bear in mind that I am your typical SOMA worker and look presentable, and on a good day fashionable--so I am neither a snob or a homeless person.  Anyway, the register person that day (someone I hadn't seen before) came over to the fountain and pretended to do something to the garbage can while I was filling my water bottle with water from the  fountain.  After she went back to the owner the owner walked over to me as I was leaving and said \"Please leave. And don't come back.\" And I said, \"But I thought filling my water bottle wasn't an issue.\" And he said again \"Please leave.\" And I said  \"But I don't understand where this is coming from--I've asked you before and you were okay with it.\" He basically denied this (so he's either crazy or has early onset Alzheimer's) and said again \"Please leave.\" So I did.

First time, I tried the sandwich with tofu and lotus chips. Sandwich - the flavors were nice but I felt the tofu was a bit too soft, would have liked a firmer texture so the tofu wouldn't mush out of the sandwich when I took a bite, also  to hold up to the crisp vegetables and bread. Another thought, it would have been nice if the bread had been toasted to give the sandwich some crunch to contrast with the other ingredients. The lotus chips are advertised as \"crispy\" but mine were a bit chewy. Is it that they were not freshly fried? I don't know. Not inspired to try them again since they also lacked flavor. Second trip I tried the wrap with beef. Again, flavors were good, however I found the wrap a bit unwieldy and eventually just had to use a fork because it was turning into a mess. I went with the wrap thinking I'd cut carbs but there was a lot of rice in there.

The bahn mi was good, it was a good size, the French roll has a crunchy crust and moist inside. I thought the pate was a little too thinly spread that I could barely taste it. The roast pork is good though, nice and tender and lots of flavor infused with lemongrass. I also enjoyed the lotus root chips.

Sure it's a little expensive, but so is just about everything else around there and they use pretty high quality ingredients.  So, in response to some yelpers,  you would pay this much for americanized-korean/vietnamese food because you:\n\n1. need a quick , yet satisfying lunch;\n2. can't go to those Vietnamese places you actually love (Ba Le in El Cerrito is my favorite!); and,\n3. are tired of eating salads and sandwiches. \n\nI have tried the beef shortribs, pork and tofu ssams (I haven't been able to bring myself to paying $7-$8 for a banh mi just yet), the salad with five-spice chicken, the pork buns and the lotus chips.  Here are my thoughts/opinions:\n\n1.Ssams: If you are trying to look at all dignified, I would recommend that you eat the ssam with a knife and fork rather than like a burrito because it always falls apart by the end (at least for me...perhaps there are more graceful eaters than I out there).  The beef shortribs were juicier and more flavorful than the pork.  The tofu seemed saltier than the meats.  You can also customize the ssam to ask for more/less veggies, rice or sauce.  Warning, the more veggies / sauce you put in and less rice, the more likely it is to fall apart.\n2. Salad with five-spice chicken: The salad was lightly dressed and the chicken chunks were very tender.  I wish there was less salt and more flavor on the chicken (salt doesn't equal flavor in my book).\n3. Pork buns: The pork buns were terrible.  The bun was dry and the cucumbers didn't taste properly pickled.  I definitely wouldn't get that again.  \n4. Lotus chips: The lotus chips were thinly sliced and crispy, but nothing special.  They tasted basically like lightly salted chips.  You should dip them in sriracha sauce if you're looking for a little more flavor.  \n\nThere are a few small tables outside and about 5 tables for 2 inside.

Since I found out about it approximately three weeks ago, I've been there about as many times.  I'm planning on getting lunch out tomorrow, and since I made that decision earlier today the angel on my shoulder has had a very hard time convincing the devil on my shoulder that I should try to eat someplace besides Spice Kit.\n\nI definitely wouldn't call Spice Kit authentic but I would call it fresh, tasty, made with love, and (if you play your cards right) healthy.  I would also call it fast, but only if you don't go during the lunchtime rush.  If you don't like waiting in line and you don't like eating a bit earlier or later than most, you might find a venture to Spice Kit quite hopeless.\n\nBut for those with iron wills and iron stomachs, Spice Kit serves up a mean sammich that, in my humble opinion, is  worth the wait.  I've only gotten the tofu banh mi because it's so good that I can't talk myself into getting anything else.  For the health-conscious: their tofu is organic, and BRAISED.  It looks fried, and it's tasty enough that if someone told me it was fried, I'd believe them.  But I checked - braised.  Go forth, ye paranoid of diet, and ingest.  I sure did.  As far as the other fixin's, the pickled veggies are delightfully tart, but balanced with a bit of mayo.  It's really quite artfully done, because you get the mayo's texture and softening qualities without really noticing that there's mayo all up in your sammich.  My one gripe is that I do wish they would distribute their hot peppers a little more evenly.  You can go for a few bites without getting any heat and then get a lot of it all at once.  I've also had a bite of the pork buns, as well as the short ribs, and both are excellent.  I think I could probably just make a meal of the pork belly buns, as the texture and flavor are both right on.\n\nWhat I really especially like is that both the owner and the head chef are always there cooking, bagging up the orders and (when they can) talking to people.  It strikes me as a business that's really trying in earnest to do well, and to do right by its customers.  While modernized, semi-gentrified Vietnamese food may not be earth-shattering or world-changing, it's still a good way to get some tasty food to the masses.  I heartily approve.

We stopped to check it out and decided to give it a shot.  Did not regret!\n\nI had the beef short rib sandwich with pate and she had the roasted pork wrap.  Both were damn good.  The beef was savory, tender, and plentiful.  Along with the crisp veggies and bread toasted to perfection, it took the Vietnamese sandwich to a whole new level.  The wrap was also amazing.  It was like a giant awesome spring roll filled with yummy goodness... the lady offered a bite and I almost refused to give it back.  Delicious.  If you live or work in SoMa, Spice Kit is DEFINITELY worth checking out.\n\nI read a couple of other reviews and think it's silly that people are comparing the sandwiches here to the Vietnamese sandwiches that typically sell for about $2.  Yeah those things are decent and cheap as hell, but Spice Kit is still a delicious, filling, healthy meal for under $10.", "author": "Will H."}

I'd like to go back & try their banh mi option though a part of me will have difficulty accepting paying over 3+ for a banh mi but I understand this is the FiDi afterall.

I ordered the vegetarian wrap which came with pickled veggies, some kind of spicy fried rice, tofu, lettuce and cucumbers all wrapped up in rice paper. While the vegetable to carb ratio was good, I had a little trouble eating my wrap. The rice paper was kind of sticky and hard to bite off (or cut with a fork and knife) and ended up tearing so it was leaking sauce. The taste was good; it was spicy but not overwhelmingly so, though it does have a very strong aftertaste (bring some quality gum or mints with you). I also don't think given the ingredients, that leftovers would keep well through the next day, so go when you're feeling hungry.", "author": "Priyam D."}

I work in the building so it's very convenient to have something so close besides Peet's and Venue so I finally tried it today.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian (tofu) sandwich (sans mayo), lotus chips, and thai iced tea. I can easily say that the thai iced tea was the worst I have ever tasted (and I drink a lot of thai iced tea). The tea itself was so over-brewed that the cream/milk didn't even add the sweetness thai iced tea is so well-known for.  The lotus chips were okay, greasy and beyond salty which would have been fine but they were overdone so the only flavor to them was the burnt crisp.  But the sandwich was by far the worst part of my lunch.  It started out fine, though the tofu was very bland, until I had a bite of tofu that was sort of peppery and way over-seasoned. It was so full of spices that it over-powed the rest of the sandwich, including the pickled veggies and jalepenos, and sent my tongue into a painful tingling. There was too much spice and no flavor at all in the sandwich.\n\nI would like to go back and give them a second chance, maybe try the wrap instead, but now I'm not sure that's a good idea.", "author": "Krissi P."}

Oh my.  Those shortribs... sooo delicious.  Very flavorful and tender.  It will be hard to resist the temptation to order them again next time instead of trying something new.  The kimchi was also very good.  My only complaint is that the rice paper on my Ssam fell apart halfway through eating and I had to switch to a fork and knife.  It didn't bother me that much, though -- the food totally makes up for it.\n\nLotus chips were awesome!  I didn't think I would love them, since I'm not a big fan of lotus, but I ordered them because of all the reviews here.  They were light, crispy, and perfectly salted.  Will definitely order again.\n\nThe iced coffee was brewed to a good strength.  I personally wish that it was a little bit sweeter, but I guess I could always ask next time for them to make it sweeter for me.  Everyone has different preferences...\n\nI will definitely be going back to try other menu items.  I think I will continue to go early (by 11:30) until they get some kinks worked out, but since I have yet to find food (esp Korean food) like this around where I work, it will be worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-03", "description": "I've been here twice and have been thoroughly underwhelmed both times.  \n\nThe first time, I had a wrap with the beef short ribs. It was a bland compilation of mush.\n\nPerhaps this was an unintended consequence of making exquisite sous-vide kalbi or perhaps I was just not perceptive enough to pick up subtle flavors.  So I decided to return to try their signature pork buns and a Vietnamese sandwich.\n \nThe pork belly buns were fine - but not spectacular.  The pork belly itself was tender, but again somewhat lacking in flavor. The bahn mi was a disaster - again, a rather bland compilation of mush on a soggy baguette.  \n\nGiven that the average price of banh mi is about $5 ($2.75 if you go to Lee's or Saigon Sandwiches), a $7.95 (or $8.70 with the pate) banh mi had better be exceptional.  This one fell far short.", "author": "Swissmister M."}

Yesterday I happened to be in the neighborhood again for work and the beef was so good I decided to try again. I had the Banh Mi this time a huge improvement.

Otherwise, I think I'll just get a bowl next time.\n\nRe the lotus chips: they're decorative, but we all agreed that they tasted like salt and pepper potato chips. Not too much of a difference. The peanut slaw was alright, but again, nothing special. My friends also got a pork bun each. They only commented that it was really fatty and that the sauce was something like oyster sauce.

I love the fact that Vietnamese sandwiches are no longer confined to \"a cheap alternative to a better meal\" status. \nThe quality of the ingredients is noticeably better than the standard Vietnamese sandwich shop, with the pork and pate combining well.  As an added bonus, the pork buns were an absolute revelation and I'd also recommend trying the lotus chips.\n\nObviously, if you're looking for the cheapest sandwich around, this isn't the place for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-31", "description": "So I've been thinking about trying Spice Kit since a few buddies raved about it a few weeks ago.  A French Laundry alum and a Ritz Carlton Dining Room alum doing Asian-inspired street food?  Sounds good to me.  \n\nMy favorites:\n- Short Rib Banh Mi - I think they sous vide the short rib because its SUPER tender and flavorful.  But its all the little things they get right that makes this sandwich.  The bread is perfectly soft yet crunchy.  The pickled veggies give great crunch and acid.  And that pate - well you've got to try it to understand.\n- Pork buns - like others have said, these things are super tasty.  Pork belly is cooked just perfect.  And the bun has that right hint of sweetness and chewiness.  Momofuku's got nothing on these guys.\n- Calamansi Lime-ade - Never had this before but I'm hooked now.  Everytime I go in now they have one ready for me.\n- Tofu Salad - okok, those that know me will find this surprising since I'm usually not a salad guy or a tofu guy.  But a friend convinced me it was worth trying and I gotta say, I'm a convert.  I probably wouldn't have gained those 20 pounds if salads tasted this good all the time.  And the tofu isn't plain white tofu.  Its the fried kind you get in Chinese claypots and its perfect in the salad.\n\nAlso the staff is super super friendly, the space is bright, clean and airy,  and they're pretty quick even during the lunch time rush.  \n\nOn a personal note, its a pet peeve of mine when people compare places like this to a $3 banh mi shop a la Saigon Sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, I love Saigon Sandwich and cheap taquerias too.  But they're not sous vide-ing top quality proteins, making homemade pate, or using super fresh organic veggies.  And Spice Kit's downtown, not in the Tenderloin or the Mission. \n\nBottom line, if you live or work in the area, try it and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Burkon W."}

Fast service and the ingredients always seem fresh, whether during the lunch rush or down time. They lose points for a limited menu and the inedible chicken. Menu allows you to customize in a sandwich, bowl, or \"wrap\".  Some of these combinations work. Others, not so much. Hot pork falls right through the wrap, which is much more suited to a summer roll.  Overall a fine choice for a little lunchtime variety.

Where else can you get awesome vietnamese sandwiches in the heart of the city?! Well, this is the place! First off, the menu is simple, and the ordering process mimics that of Chipotle - select the type of sandwich, the meat, any sides, and your drink - simple! I love their vietnamese sandwich - have it with the short ribs, the chicken, or pork - you just can't go wrong! For the sides, the lotus fries are incredible - sweet, refreshing, and not too oily at all - served in a perfect portion to complement your sandwich. The pork bun is a definite must too - that is, if you're not full already. For 2.95, it's definitely worth it. Keep in mind that this is a pork belly bun dish, so the oil with the pork is a must (if you don't like the fatty pork, this is not your dish); I however, love this dish and get it every time! All in all, you have to try this place; try and you will fall in love with it.
