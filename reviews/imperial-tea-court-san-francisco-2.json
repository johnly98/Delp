The service was very helpful as well.\n\nThe noodles (both the thinner and thicker noodles) were tasty, and the broth was also delicious. I ordered the thinner ones (think basic spaghetti noodles, and a LOT of them), but I liked the thick noodles best. The dumpling platter was also tasty, and the assorted dumplings came out hot and fresh! It was a great platter to share in addition to our soup (which can also easily be shared). I would skip the pork bun, however, and stick with the noodles. While the bun looked absolutely delicious, it wasn't anything special (I prefer the Costco microwave ones to this). \n\nEven though our friend called the soup pho like 500 times (she was clearly confused on the type of food we were eating), she seemed to fully enjoy her soup as well. \n\nOverall it was a good experience and an easy way to temporarily avoid the Saturday crowds.", "author": "Heather R."}

It feels a bit out of place compared to the rest of the shops in the Ferry Building but it's worth a visit if you like Chinese tea!\n\nThe prices are kind of high but I guess it's because of how expensive the rent is.

It's in the Ferry Building so it's totally understandable. They gotta pay their astronomical rent somehow right? \n\nIF I brought my Tiger mom here for their $15 Bowl of Noodle Soup, it would be akin to getting a 96% on a school exam. \n\n\"You got an 'A'?!...AIYA, what happened to A plus-y?!?\" \n\nI would be eating feathers for the week.... \n\nIf you grew up with a Tiger Mom too, you know what's up!\n\nMy boss loves this place and suggested it for a lunch with our old co-worker. It's a tea house and they have fancy tea service but we came for the food. The small menu has dim sum, steamed buns, noodle soups, curry, and cookies. No msg is used which I confirmed with our server.  \n\nAs we were perusing the menu, my old co-worker bought some steamed buns from their stand in front. The Cha Siu Bao ($3): http://bit.ly/2o676Zd was hot, fluffy, and chockful of savory sweet roasted pork. It was decent. While it's twice the cost of Chinese bakeries, keep in mind it's the Ferry Building so $3 is not too shabby for a snack. \n\nShe also bought a Pork Meatball Bao ($3) which was terrible. The dense filling tasted like old siu mai filling. \n\nWe all opted for the Prix-Fixe Lunch ($22): Choice of Entr\u00e9e, Spring Roll, Almond Cookies, and Tea (+$3 for Imperial Tea). \n\nMy boss raves about their noodle soup so I ordered the Hand-Stretched Noodle Soup w/ Braised Beef for my entr\u00e9e: http://bit.ly/2Asr8yw.\n\nThe hand stretched noodles were firm but lacked a chewy bite: http://bit.ly/2zcXMWX. The broth is available in mild, medium, and spicy. The medium was pretty spicy and overpowered the taste of the broth. We were told the broth is vegetable based so that may also be the reason why I couldn't taste any depth (if there was any). \n\nThe braised beef needed to be cooked at least another 45 minutes longer as the larger pieces were a bit tough.\n\nThe accompanying spring roll was horrific and was like eating toasted parchment paper. While I appreciate the healthy approach of baking instead of frying it, the wrapper was busted at the seams and the cabbage filling was completely flavorless. We asked for sweet & sour sauce which they didn't have but our server brought us their housemade hibiscus dipping sauce. It was bizarre...it was like eating pureed flowers and sugar. \n\nThe almond cookies were meh. I was expecting them to be like shortbread cookies but they weren't. They should just serve almond cookies from Twin Dragon (pink box). \n\nFor the tea, I choose the caffeine-free Prosperity Blend (hibiscus based). It was floral and a little too sweet for my liking. \n\nService was great. The young server with black hair and glasses was super friendly and there when we needed her. \n\nAside from their noodle soup, my boss loves this place because it's quiet and you can easily maintain a conversation compared to all the other places in the Ferry Building. He was right. There's only 6-7 four tops and there wasn't a crowd during primetime lunchtime. \n\nThe Ferry Building is fantastic and has lots of great stands and eateries like Acme, Cowgirl Creamery, Hog Island Oysters Co, Delica, etc. but this is not one of them. As much as my boss loves this place, the food at Imperial Tea is a very poor representation of Chinese food in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-12", "description": "After having a killer run on Embarcadero, we thought we deserved some hearty tasty dim sum! So we decided to check out Imperial Tea Court at the Ferry Building. I've always seen this place serving up steam buns at a stand directly outside the restaurant to attract the farmers market foot traffic inside the building. The dim sum menu seems promising and interesting/unique but overall after trying it, I have to say the food was lackluster and you can find better dim sum elsewhere.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n1) Shrimp Dumplings: While the filling in this was decently flavorful, the dumplings were so tiny and the dumpling skin was insanely thin. Every time we picked one up with our chopsticks, the skin would just fall apart and the filling would come out. Not a great experience.\n\n2) Dragon Well Dumplings: The skin on these was definitely better, but I found the filling to be bland and had to dip the dumpling in soy sauce and chili oil to taste something. I get the uniqueness of flavoring the filling with a tea seasoning, but I think there needs to be some other flavor component. \n\n3) Wontons in Jasmine Tea Broth: This dish sounded super unique, and it definitely was. I'll give the restaurant plus points for the size of this dish (I think there were 10-12 wontons). But, while the tea-infused broth gave it an interesting spin, the flavors weren't balanced. The jasmine tea from the broth combined with the peppercorn in the filling made the wontons bitter. This dish again needed something else to have complementing flavors (something salty, fatty, or sweet ideally). \n\nOverall, I think the food was just okay. It's not a bad place to come to if you're in the area craving dim sum, but it by no means comes close to solid dim sum spots around town.", "author": "Sabina S."}

Surely there were most people who had their tables; fortunately, a kind female server with glasses have found a table for me.  All she had to do was to clean the table for me and I'm seated.  This was my first time having lunch inside the open restaurant.  I wanted to talk to the other American version of Jimmy who owns the tea selection, but he wasn't here today.  I'll sometimes swing by his position during lunchtime and after work M-F to see how he's doing.  \n\nSince I had $25 with me, I ordered a curry vegan tofu with rice and a glass of hibiscus ice tea.  Despite much wait, my plate came to me at last.  Everything I've tasted on my plate was almost bland, but comfortable.  Not much I described about the firm tofu cubes and vegetables; one thing interested me more was the hibiscus ice tea.  Its cranberryish flavor is much better than the Hawaiian Punch.\n\nSince I couldn't have a dessert, I decided to pay.  Upon looking at my receipt, it showed me that I was in table 7.  Made me lucky since 7 was the lucky number!  What I'm lucky about was the total was ten cents less than my $20 bill!  I didn't need a change and I had to give a $1 tip to the female server.  That was a good experience; much better than any Chinese restaurants.  If I wanted a greater experience, an afternoon tea special was what I expected, but it's only M-F 3-6pm.

It was stuffed quite full with pork belly (not the absolute best I've had, but very good) and reminded me of TW rou burger and also of Chairman Bao, only more basic without the gimicky garnishes and in a more convenient hand-held pocket where the filling doesn't fall out. \n\nAlthough their stand is located outside their stall, you may sit in the tall majestic wooden chairs of the tea house--the ambiance brings you back a few centuries in zen-like peacefulness away from the hustle and bustle of the Ferry Building marketplace. \n\nStreet food for SF bourgeois.", "author": "Edna C."}

We passed by this tea shop, which had no line and advertised hand stretched noodles, so we decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised! We both ordered the hand drawn noodles with beef and it was very tasty. I got mild, which was still spicy. My husband ordered medium and he said it was a bit too spicy. The broth was flavorful, the noodles a good texture, and the beef was relatively good (although I got a couple of pieces that could have been more tender). This is clearly a place geared towards tourists. The decorations were nice, with cute tea sets everywhere. The prices were high, $16 for a bowl of beef noodle soup, but what do you expect from an eatery at the Ferry Building? The service was friendly, although they never refilled our water. I had also ordered the Dragonwell tea with roses and it was very aromatic and relatively strong. They wash the tea for you and then show you how to use a gaiwan to steep the tea before pouring it into your teacup. It was cute to try.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back!", "author": "Alice P."}

To featured Americanized stuff is never a terrible thing, so as long as it's done well. And that's primarily my problem with Imperial, nothing I've had here has lived up to the expectations, or the price tag.\n\nIt's easy to fall privy to this touristy spot, after all it is the Embarcadero after all. The allure of the antiquated Asian decor and signs of \"organic\" love for their samples and treats, is usually enough to compel a small crowd to come here. Rarely crowded, the wait time is typically nil.\n\nCurious to try their famous Teahouse spicy noodles ($12), we opted for the vegetarian version. The broth had some kick to it, but the noodles were a bit too chewy to enjoy. An order of their Dim Sum sampler ($13) was somewhat laughable, considering how poorly executed it all was. A mix of a spring roll, shao mai, a red bean bun, and shrimp dumplings, were dry, somewhat tasteless, and the texture for each was strange. If organic Dim Sum is supposed to be like this, then this is an experiment gone wrong.\n\nWe weren't going to give up so easily. We threw in an extra order of the dragon dumplings, which in spite of their initial clump appearance tasted solid. Not sure if they were worth the $6/7 for the plate, but it was easily the best thing I ate. Next up was wonton soup, with a jasmine tea base. While the broth was solid, the wontons were just a mess. The skin was falling apart and the shrimp was overcooked. Not ideal by any means.\n\nLast but not least, the extra star comes as a result of their tea tasting. There are some high quality leaves available here, but it all comes at a pretty price. Are there less spendy variations in Chinatown and The Richmond? Most likely yes. Are the less inhibited / more intimidated likely to choose price and convenience over the rest? Depends on which side of the Dim Sum coin you're on.", "author": "Jando S."}

It's a pretty tiny spot, but charming, so we stopped in for a bite. There was only one family eating so we had no problem getting a table.\n\nOur server was nice and it didn't take long for me to decide on what I wanted - I went with the spicy beef noodle soup with the house made noodles, which the waiter said are made fresh every morning. There are multiple heat levels to choose from so I went with \"spicy,\" which was one level below the highest heat. Service was fast and my bowl of soup came pretty quickly, and I knew I was in for a test when I saw how red the broth was.\n\nSure enough, that soup was HOT. The flavors of the broth were very good - luckily the soup wasn't so spicy that it lost any distinct  flavors - and the heat was the type that builds the more you eat it, but I had mixed feelings about the noodles. They weren't round, fat noodles like I've had at places like Shan Dong in Oakland, but were flat and looked like they'd been cut roughly and haphazardly. They were also not very tender, but a bit tough, and a lot of the chunks of meat were very fatty, though cooked perfectly otherwise.\n\nI wasn't as satisfied with my meal as I was hoping, given that for around $12 or $13 I got very few noodles that were tough and a lot of fatty meat. I thought everything tasted good overall, but it wasn't worth a special trip and I'm not dying to return. The iced jasmine tea was a bright spot in the meal, however, so I'd recommend getting one of those with your food, they're very refreshing. But otherwise, I probably wouldn't make the trek over here again anytime soon.", "author": "Angela M."}

This place knows their tea. We both got a pot (it's $3 extra if you want to share a pot but we decided to try two flavors) and some shu mai and shrimp dumplings as snacks.\n\nSo this place is not your typical tea place. They take their tea seriously. We got two pots because we thought we could just pour each other a cup of the other person's tea ... false. So your tea leaves are actually served in an individual cup. They do this whole fancy thing where they rinse out the first wash and then let you sniff your leaves so you can get the fragrance and everything. Then because my friend had a specialty tea and I had a green tea, we were given water of different temperatures as to not mess up the ... tea simmering process I guess. And then when you sip, you really have to sip. If you're a tea gulper, you'll struggle because basically you use the cup lid as a strainer for your tea. \n\nHow was my tea served at some very specific temperature? Good I guess. It was tea... and without really knowing tea, it's hard for me to tell you if it was good or bad. It was probably on the better side, or I hope it was because it was expensive???\n\nBasically what I'm saying is if you really understand tea, you might have a finer appreciation for this place. But my friend and I really do not know our stuff so we were plebians in this world. I literally didn't even know what green tea to order because they were all the same to me. If you gave me a blind taste test, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.\n\nThe appetizers were not terrible but definitely not worth the money. The shu mai was interesting because they had bamboo pieces inside it giving it some extra flavor to mix up the usual pork grind. Shrimp dumplings tasted close enough to authentic to me but clearly weren't. The sizes are also tiny!! i wish I had pictures but even though you're given six pieces, each bite is super super tiny. \n\nTotal for two pots of tea and two dim sum dishes was about $30. As my friend says, it's kind of one of those places that overcharges based on the premise of authenticity. The tea is probably super authentic, but the dim sum is alright but leaning to mediocre. Atmosphere is nice though and if you're looking for a place to sit and talk with a friend, I'd recommend it.\n\ntldr; good place to hang out and take a break if you're in the ferry building, but unless you have a huge appreciation/understanding for tea, it might be hard to fully appreciate this place", "author": "Jasmine X."}

You may want to consult the staff for a recommendation.  Oolong, dragon well and green tea are common selections.  However, the prices has increased and it becomes tedious trying to share even with the extra fee for doing so.  Therefore, the staff encourages that each person get a pot of tea that they barely finish unless you sit there for hours.  Unfortunately, it becomes arduous to pour the water into a bowl and then hold the cap while you pour the bowl into your cup.  \n\nThe food is okay.  Nothing special.  The best dish is their signature spicy noodle soup with the Niman ranch beef, which is a bit too lean for the flavor of the fat to meld with each bite.  The Beijing style braised beef, which lacks flavor, is again too lean and not tender enough.  \n\nService is slow and sometimes friendly.  The ambiance is a traditional tea house in terms of furniture, but the feel of a private tea place is missing.  Parking is tough on the street unless you find spots in nearby garages.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Their website says that their restaurant closes at 7 while kitchen closes at 6:30, so we made sure that we arrive around 6:10. However, even arriving at 6:10, the waiter was really reluctant to seat us, and was really pushing us on ordering fast. On to the food, they only had vegetable buns, so we got a couple of those, a couple of tea eggs, and tried out their beef noodle soup. I would pass on the tea eggs. They lack the \"tea\" flavor that's essential, and seemed like it was only being seeped for a short amount of time. I ordered my beef noodle soup on mild while my boyfriend got it with medium spicy. Let me say, they're definitely on the spicy side. So I would recommend lowering a level of spiciness if you're ordering. We got their hand cut noodle. Being Chinese and growing up with really good hand cut noodle, their noodle was not super great. The width of the noodles are very inconsistent, and the it's on the more dough-y side. Overall, 3/5, not super special.", "author": "Sharon L."}

Imperial Tea Court is where I headed one day I needed a slow pace to enjoy a nice cup of tea, to seek temporary respite from the insanity that is the year-end of a fiscal year, and to send off a close friend. The first mission was accomplished, while the last two were not entirely accomplished.\n\nWe asked for gong fu tea service, as we wanted to have a beautiful experience. The dining room is beautifully decorated, and the hustle and bustle of the Ferry Building seemed as if it were a block or two away, so my friend and I got to having the wonderful conversation that the place seemed to demand of us. When our server returned, he patiently described what he was doing and why (e.g. pouring hot water on the stoneware for two reasons: to warm it up so the tea would be warmer longer as a cold stoneware would \"steal\" heat from the water, and to wash it and sanitize it which was established by the ancient Chinese who did not have the luxury of our running water and/or dishwasher). The puerh tea had a very pleasant earthy flavor and my friend and I resumed our conversation while drinking our tea.\n\nHere is what irked us and simply prevented us from enjoying a leisurely t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: the other server seemed determined to turn us away ASAP. When our first pot was empty, he promised to bring us more hot water, which took at least ten minutes to arrive. Once he gave us our second pot of hot water, he asked us if we could pay our bill already because they were closing (this was around 5:45, 45 minutes before their advertised closing time of 6:30). It was abrupt and, quite frankly, rude, but no problem...we were not planning to add anything to our order, anyway. What truly got to us was being asked to leave at around 5:55 because they were closing. My friend and I were displeased. We thought we had another half an hour so we were delaying the goodbyes. Now we have five minutes to say our \"I will miss you's\" and let me tell you, that is not a very pleasant thing to do. There was another couple there in the restaurant eating their meal, and they were rushed as well.\n\nWhat became apparent to us was that this server seemed to be in a rush to go to a gig. There was a bass resting against the wall when we arrived that he was moving just as we stood up. Oh, and yes, we were told to be careful not to ruin his precious bass (admittedly, this could have been a failed attempt at humor but at this point we already considered him a rude server with minimal customer service skills, so really we are a bit biased already). \n\nI am not sure if I would go back. Maybe if I did, it would be to have some tea with no expectations of a pleasant time spent there.", "author": "Clarice O."}

Not only did our waitress disappear after serving our food, she had a piss-poor attitude the entire time she interacted with us. Our questions were met with a mixture of condescension and surliness, and I don't think she smiled once. I'm fine with this kind of attitude in real Chinese restaurants, where prices are dirt cheap and food is abundant. But not for a place like this, where a small platter of disgusting, barely warmed-over dim sum costs a whopping $12. Seriously--I tried one of Rachel's shu mais with the knowledge that it was filled with either pork or vegetables (she'd requested both), and I literally could not tell what the filling was made of. It was just greyish mush. You know it's bad when you can't tell if something is pork or veggies.\n\nMy order--the signature spicy noodles--was certainly better, but still unsatisfying for the price ($12). The noodles were slightly overcooked, the broth was a tad too salty, and the diced beef was surprisingly pungent (not a good thing). However, it was a bowl of hot noodles and soup, and on a chilly March afternoon, it more or less hit the spot. For tea, I got the Purple Bamboo green tea, which was bland and poorly steeped. If you're expected to pay $5-8 for a small cup of tea, I think you should have the option to steep your own tea. We were not given that choice, and our waitress clearly had no idea what she was doing.\n\nThe tea room/restaurant is rather nice-looking, with its dark, cherry wood, ornate carvings, shelves of shiny tea-ware and jars of loose leaf teas. Just don't look at anything too closely, otherwise you might notice all the dirty, exposed ceiling pipes, the chipped wood and the unclean floor. \n\nI don't doubt that there is some level of sincere tea love at Imperial Tea Court (the owner does, after all, sponsor the annual SF International Tea Festival). But to me, the whole place screams \"attempt to cash in on wealthy patrons who can afford to shop/dine at the Ferry Building but don't know enough about Chinese tea culture to tell the difference between Imperial's over-the-top, 'exotic' Chinese-ness and real Chinese tea rooms\". One need only look at the mediocre, overpriced food and bland, overpriced tea. I've been wondering why this place only has 3 stars on Yelp when it looks so good from the pictures.

We had been to the Imperial Tea Court in Berkeley before and really enjoyed our food, so we thought coming to this location would be a safe choice. However, we were disappointed to see that the dishes we had tried before at the other ITC were not listed on the menu since they only offer a limited selection.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n-Vegetarian teahouse spicy noodles ($12): shredded cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and noodles in spicy broth http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/imperial-tea-court-san-francisco-2?select=FnIwo4X2TGKbgpQq5xIS3g#a2Yq-Gi6dt2dhZn76qOQYA\n-Wontons in jasmine tea broth ($10): organic pork wontons in jasmine tea broth http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/imperial-tea-court-san-francisco-2?select=FnIwo4X2TGKbgpQq5xIS3g#lTtahp_xQKGrn91dnMpPtQ\n\nWe also picked up a passionfruit ginger ale drink right outside the storefront for $3 since they were selling them, but you can also order it off the menu after you sit down (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/imperial-tea-court-san-francisco-2?select=FnIwo4X2TGKbgpQq5xIS3g#FnIwo4X2TGKbgpQq5xIS3g). The ginger ale was amazing and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink ginger ale! The ginger flavor was subtle and not too strong while the passionfruit added a refreshingly fruity taste. \n\nI was surprised when the spicy noodles came out since the portion size was a good amount bigger than that of the wonton soup. The noodles and veggies were good, but the broth was VERY spicy and definitely was too much for me especially since the hotness of the soup also added to the spiciness. I didn't finish the broth, but the part I did drink actually made the top of my lips hurt a little after :( I heard that the wontons were tasty but that the jasmine broth was a bit light. This was fixed though by taking some of my spicy broth to give it more flavor.\n\nService was prettyyy slow too because there were only two women working. We must have waited 10 minutes for our check to be processed and it felt like we practically had to beg them to take our money! This was slightly annoying.

Now, I've been to China and Taiwan multiple times before, and while I've had \"bad service\", I've never had service as bad as what I got here.

We were not informed that the Tea Sampler came with only one cup of tea, and when we tried to ask for another cup so that you know, we could split the tea between the two of us, the waitress refused and said that the afternoon sampler only came with one cup. Umm...Okay. I don't see the big deal of giving another cup so that 2 people can share tea, unless you really expected one person to drink an entire teapot's worth of tea. Dimsum sampler tasted stale but authentic. Is that an oxymoron? The tea was good.\n\nWhen the waitress came out with our food, she immediately set down a bill on our table. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant like this that charged premium prices but was also rude enough to bring out the receipt so quickly. My friend and I took a look at the receipt though, and immediately noticed that it was not ours. We called over what seemed to be the head manager (white guy who worked more the store side), and he quickly fixed the mistake. Apparently it was meant for the lady at the table right next to us.

Everything sounded over-the-top fantastic on the menu.\n\nTake the Dragon Well dumplings for example.  The description on the menu: \"Handmade dumplings filled with Niman Ranch ground pork shoulder and infused with Imperial Tea court's dragon well green tea.\"  Wow.  Sounds amazing, right?  Well, these were just alright.  Plain ol' pork dumplings that were kinda small.  They were savory.  The skin wasn't that thick, but not thin enough that they fell apart.  Big whoop.  They didn't taste remarkably better than any other place.\n\nI had the Teahouse Spicy Noodles with pork. They were good. Satisfying if you want something warm.  The noodles were on the thin and soft side. The pork was ground up. Interestingly, the server offered me the option of \"spicy\" versus \"not-spicy\" for this dish.  Hmm... but it already says spicy in the name...?  Anyway, if you get it non-spicy, the broth is less oily.  I think they use chili oil to spice it up.  Overall a good dish, but not spectacular.  \n\nI suppose you'd be coming here for the tea, rather than the food.  There was quite a large selection of tea.  I got something with ginger and ginseng.  My partner got black lychee (which smelled way better than mine).  The tea is loose, and it comes in a little cup with a lid and a saucer.  There is a pot of hot water on the table. You're supposed to pour the water into this cup, wait for it to brew.  The difficult part comes when you're supposed to pour the tea from this cup into another cup for drinking.  The table just ends up getting wet.  Or you could just sip from the original cup.  \n\nI can't comment on the authenticity of this little tea ceremony.  I've never seen tea served this way in Chinese culture.  Or Japanese culture... or ... whatever.\nAnyway, this was a fun little experience.  Not for the food per se.  Maybe for the tea, but definitely for the lounging-factor and the people-watching.

They also serve food, so that you can have food with your tea.  For lunch, they have a handful of selections, and two are vegetarian, which made me glad.  I ordered the vegetarian curry tofu and was worried it would be spicy, but it wasn't.  It was overpriced, as most ferry building food is.  ($11.00 or $11.50 included tea, but the food itself was like the $4.95 lunch special at a cheap Thai place, so that's a $6 cup of tea if you subtract the difference.)  But I was pleased with it, and the tofu was surprisingly filling, or maybe just the tea made me not hungry later (I'm not used to having any caffeine).  \n\nThere were a billion kinds of tea to choose from.  Well, maybe like 35 kinds.  They had romantic sounding descriptions.  Mine was called Misty Island or something like that.  Instead of just slapping the tea down in front of us, we each got to look at our tea leaves, and the other's tea leaves, and then the waitress poured a little hot water, and we each got to sniff both.  I tried to drink the tea the way the waitress demonstrated, but it wasn't easy, felt awkward.  I definitely ate some tea leaves!  But that was cool.\n\nI think this is a good place if you want to have a long conversation with someone and linger (but not during the busy lunchtime).  I also think it's a good place to bring a tourist.  If you don't want a meal, you can have cookies.  Or just tea.  This is the kind of place I would rather go than a bar, because you can drink and talk and linger and stuff without the nasty smells and rude behaviors that bars have.  Of course, this is not a nightlife place but a daytime place.  It could also be cozier.  For two people to sit at a table, your companion is a bit far away, more so than usual.", "author": "Stacey B."}

The restaurant was small, maybe 3 tables had guests that already had food, yet our order took over half an hour to get, most of which we didn't even order. My friend has an aversion to mushrooms which is why we asked to substitute certain items from the dim sum sampler for more shrimp dumplings. The server seemed as if she understood, but when the food finally arrived it wasn't what we had ordered. It was double orders of the most mediocre and sorry dumplings and dim sum I've ever had the misfortune of having to eat. Her seemingly broken English, combined with her thievery, bamboozled my wallet. What should've been a $12 light lunch so we could go to other places to eat turned into a $40 crappy meal.

The ITC is a traditional tea house.  In the midst of the noisy, hyper busy Ferry Building they have somehow created an oasis.  Upon entering you feel and sense the calm.  The selection of teas and the attention to their care and service ranks among the best in the bay.  Rather than inundating the customer with a 100 item menu of so so fare, ITC features a small changing menu of carefully selected and well executed items that complement the teas.\n\nI can not find fault in their restaurant and left feeling that is was money and time well spent.", "author": "David A."}

I had it mild heat, which was perfect for me. I really enjoyed the dish but wished there were more vegetables in the dish. The amount of noodles was perfect & certainly filling. Also had some tea which was a unique experience.  They rinsed the leaves in the cup first to get rid of any contaminates, etc.  She added new water to the cup and explained the process of drinking the tea. You hold the saucer in your palm and with your other hand, hold the lid more perpendicular to the top of the water to hold back the free floating tea leaves so you don't accidentally gulp them down. I had gotten the imperial peony & rose tea. This tea was ok and not as robust as I had hoped for. It was on the light flavor side and probably would have required a very long steep period to be where I would have liked the taste to be. \nService was good- no complaints there.", "author": "Tara R."}

It is so relaxing to be in...a zen, calm environment in the heart of the Ferry Building. \n\nOk, so this is first and foremost a TEA place. And they do a pretty good job. The tea selection is amazing -- such an incredible variety of teas. I've been many times, so I've had the sen cha, earl grey, rose petal tea etc, all were very high standard. The presentation is a tradition Chinese gaiwan style, hence the separate tea for each drinker. Fun!You can also visit and just buy tea to have at home, and it seems like that's what a lot of people do. \n\nI would also recommend the food. The curry chicken is really something else... yum!

Sure, it's served with angel hair pasta and would be vastly enhanced if they used fresh Chinese noodles.  Let me tell you that I like this dish so much I really don't care that it's served with angel hair pasta.  They use tea oil, and I'm pretty sure a spicy bean sauce, and it's just so satisfying especially on a cold day.  It always comes out piping hot, even when it's a to go order (cravings).  They're thoughtful about how they put it in the bag, tell you to keep it upright so's you don't spill any.  \n\nThe other food I've had here has been good, but not spectacular.  Nothing I would come here for instead of somewhere else.  For example, if you're going to eat dim sum go somewhere where they'll give you more bang for your buck, and more selection.  It's a small place.  \n\nTea has always been good here.  If someone in your party's never been, they'll do a truncated version of kung fu cha, where they'll rinse your tea leaves with hot water and have you smell the tea before and after the water's added.  I kinda wish they provided strainer's though, because it's just your cup with a lid to stop you from gulping down tea leaves.

The place was almost empty; everyone else seemed to be at the wine bar next door ;-) \r\n\r\nThey have a nice selection of high quality teas, but not the huge number of teas on the tea tasting menu that Samovar has. The Imperial  doesn't seem to be as much of a scene as Samovar, probably due to its location in the Ferry Building and the fact that it closes at 6 pm. \r\n\r\nI had the orchid oolong, which I enjoyed very much in spite of not liking the gaiwan presentation.

You hold the saucer with the cup in it with your left hand, then with your right hand, employ the cup cover like a strainer to hold back the tea leaves while you sip the tea.

So I called on Imperial Tea Court to reserve their venue for the event. Was quoted pricing, discussed time and what I needed (for them to make some tea and otherwise leave the rest up to my family). Was told over the phone by a female representative that we were booked. I tried to give a credit card number to secure the reservation. None was needed, I was told. Just call a few weeks before the event to finalize the details. Fine. That was late last fall. \n\nFast forward three or four months. We happened to be near the ferry building. Oh, I say to fiance, let's go in and give them our money and decide how we want the place laid out for us. We meet a white dude with a mullet sort of haircut and I tell him of our reservation and desire to finalize plans. He starts talking about tables and food. No, I explain, chinese wedding tea ceremony involves us kneeling and serving tea in one spot, no food and no tables necessary. Continue to explain that we just need to pay a deposit and decide on the layout. He starts quoting different prices and I tell him what I got from the corporate rep over the phone. $8 for each person for tea only, $12 per person for tea and food. He adds it up and decides he needs to call the owner to confirm everything. Fine. Calls the owner and she is not fine with it, apparently they do not have my reservation on file AND they will \"lose too much money\" on us by charging us $8 a head for some tea for 35 people on Saturday afternoon. EXCUSE ME?! Plus the room fee of a couple hundred dollars mind you! They are telling me that this would lose them money, a large amount of money that would be had by entertaining regular patrons at this time instead of honoring the reservation I had already made and was ensured that it stood firm. I don't even need the staff to do anything except make tea, I even have my own tea set so I don't need them to use anything, serve anything, wash anything, and still they will not honor their word. Next come the audacious suggestion that I do it at a different time! It's my freaking WEDDING DAY, I don't have ANOTHER TIME available for god's sake! I tell mullet man point blank that they are now ruining my wedding day. This is how people become bridezillas. Grace, the owner, and mullet man still offer me nothing and are content with standing me up. I actually cannot believe that a business would conduct themselves this way. I even remember the woman on the phone I initially spoke with saying they had done such events before; so why don't they have this routine down? \n\nREALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. Let it be known people, $8 for cup of tea is too little for these people. I am not sure what they expect for pouring some hot water on top of some lotus seeds, but apparently over $500 for an hour of their time (and remember they wouldn't actually have to do anything during this hour) is far too little.", "author": "Thlel Yan D."}

The Imperial Tea Court is the gold standard by which I judge all other tea places, and one of the few places in the US where you can buy high-end and rare teas of international quality.  Some of the tea you can get here isn't available anywhere else, some of it will never be made again, and some of it will taste different with each season.  The teas (and fine collectible teaware) are hand selected by the proprietor, who is internationally known as a leading figure in western tea culture.  \n\nThis is a tea house, not a restaurant, adjust expectations accordingly.  Do not come here with gwai lo ignorance, scoff at the (reasonable) pricing and expect to be supersized.  Even when I'm hungry I have never found the portions to be too small, and as a vegetarian I think the selection is just fine.  The flavor is on the delicate side, but you don't want the food to overpower the tea.  And yes, you can get a huge cup of watered down, boiled-to-death tea from Peets for a dollar, but keep in mind that what they put in a tea bag is what they sweep off the floor of the tea processing plant.  \n\nIf you are open-minded and just learning or a more seasoned tea-o-phile this place is highly recommended.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-04-15", "description": "Where to start?\n\nI stopped in with my father for lunch.  I have a general rule about avoiding the overpriced businesses at the Ferry Plaza.  The food is typically overpriced and oversanitized to appease the delicate palates of the bridge and tunnel crowd.  This place did nothing to prove me wrong.\n\nI knew what I wanted, so I ordered (spicy noodles and some white tea).  My father was brave enough to try and solicit suggestions from the staff.  Ugh.\n\nThe tea was fine, the presentation was not.  Certainly not $5 worth of fine by any stretch of the imagination.  If I wanted high quality tea, I'd mail order it from Upton.  Hell, you can call them and they're happy to help you pick out teas you might like.  Here?  The waitress was extremely reluctant to recommend any sort of tea pairing to my father.  She was down right condescending to him.\n\nI'll agree 100% with the other posters who pointed out that you do not leave some tea to steep while you drink it.  Lots of English black teas can take it.  The more delicate green and white teas cannot.  Your tea will taste like stewed tea leaves.  That this place expects you to not remove your tea leave at all shows how little they know about tea.  That they explain different brewing temperatures for different teas is great.  But they only give you one pot of water.  So. Again.  Don't order green teas here lest you end up with a cup of stewed green tea.  For as much as they charge they ought to get these things right.\n\nSo, after that, I decided to dig into the noodles.  I opted for vegetarian (which is often a mistake in some restaurants, but I felt like something light) vs beef or pork.  These were not light.  Once I made my way through the huge mount of lettuce, I discovered that the noodles were, as other commenters pointed out, essentially what you'd buy at the store.  Maybe a step above the dry noodles in foam cups, but certainly no better than the perishable noodles.  For $12 I expected a helluva lot more from the noodles.\n\nBut hey, maybe the magic was in their hyped broth, right?  Nope.  As I splashed a few drops of broth while trying to dig through the mess of lettuce, the first thing I noticed was that it was that the broth was quite oily.  Okay.  Maybe that's because it's spicy, right?  Lots of places use chili oil to spice things up.  Wrong again.  It was not spicy.  Well, at least they balanced the delicate flavors in the broth with skill aplomb, right?  Nope.  The broth was a salty oily mess.  Yuck.\n\nSo what does one do with a salty oily mess in between sips of hot tea?  If you answered drink some ice cold water, you'd have read my mind.  Apparently they don't give water out by default.  That's fine.  We're in San Francisco.  We like to conserve water.  So I tried to pique the waitress' attention.  Every time I tried this, she'd smile at me and run away quickly.  At some point she finally acted like she was going to come over.  Then one of the 'regulars' came in and she became more interested in helping him.  For the life of me I could not get either of the waitresses to come over to the table.  Even when we were ready to leave (chopsticks laying across the bowl, full cup of tea pushed away from me, father's empty plate... nope.. that's not a sign we're done) they were insistent upon ignoring us.  I had to walk over and demand the cheque... and then demand that they give me change.\n\nWhy someone would bother coming here regularly is beyond me.

I came here for lunch with a friend and we waited 20 minutes for service even though the place was less than half full. Eventually, my friend had to flag down our very impatient, scowling waiter so we could order. I ordered the beef stew which was painfully subpar. It was a bowl of mostly rice, with a sprinkling of broccoli, and bland meat. Any place in Chinatown could've served the same thing  for $4 in 5 minutes, instead of $14.50 in another 20 minutes. \n\nMy tea leaves came in the tea cup with the teapot full of scalding water. The waiter wordlessly poured the water into my cup, put a lid on the cup, then left. No explanation as to how long I should let it steep or, most importantly, how to drink it. I've had English tea in plenty of places, and I've had tea in countless Chinatown dim sum places, but I've never seen it served like this. I noticed there was a strainer inside the teapot full of hot water so I dumped the tea in my cup into the teapot. Later when I asked our waiter about it, he told me the tea was supposed to be drunk with the cup loaded with leaves. The lid was supposed to be used as a strainer even though it was, in every possible way, just a lid. Anyway, after he saw the mistake I made FROM HIS LACK OF EXPLANATION, he stated,\"You'll just have to drink it like that now.\" Does it make logical sense to drink a scalding cup of tea leaves with the lid on? Perhaps they drink like this in China, but this pretentious time and money vacuum is in the Ferry Berry amidst many people who might not be familiar with the tea customs of China. Was a simple 1 or 2 sentence explanation too much to do?\n\nThis place robbed us of our precious money, time, and good mood.

We went to the counter to ask for a table and were greeted by a very unwelcoming waitress.  She barely spoke two words to us as she showed us to our table, and didn't get any more chatty as the meal went by.  We ordered a vegetarian bun and vegetarian egg rolls; while the buns  came in a timely manner, the egg rolls took FOREVER. When they came they were so molten that we burned our tongues scarfing them down because of our hunger.  In that respect it is impossible to know whether they actually tasted good or our tongues rendered them delicious because the taste buds were burnt beyond repair. Anyhow, beyond the egg rolls, the vegetarian buns were a complete disappointment.  They were filled with nasty, bitter cow cud-like greens, and opening them emitted a smell of death.  We ended up dumping the greens out and eating just the bun-- to the disapproval of rude waitress.  The only shining light in the end of this bleak tunnel was the tea, which appeared to be very high quality and delicious.  In addition to the made to order ones inside the restaurant, they also had bags for sale that looked good.

For example:\n\n- For the best flavor, the brewing vessel should be preheated by rinsing it with hot water.  This was not done.\n\n- The tea was brewed in a gaiwan (a cup with a lid), but no cup was supplied to pour the finished tea into after it had brewed.  Normally, tea is brewed in a gaiwan but then poured into a separate cup to drink.  This prevents the tea from brewing too long.  Although it's not unheard of to drink tea off the top of the leaves - \"grandpa style\" - it's what you would do at home with average quality tea, not what you expect when you go to a tea house.\n\n- The water wasn't hot enough.  With a pu-erh tea that needs nearly boiling water to get the best flavor, I was served warm water (say, 170 degrees).  The water might have been suited to a delicate green tea but not to a robust pu-erh tea.\n\nI strongly recommend that you avoid the Imperial Tea Court.", "author": "David W."}

There's no way to say this nicely.  The food left little to be desired.  I'm a big dim sum fan, and I've had far better elsewhere.

I love the wontons in jasmine tea broth.  I smell the jasmine as soon as the bowl arrives, but it doesn't taste too much like jasmine.  It's a very delicate flavor.  The service has been very friendly and pretty prompt.  It's a tea place, so if you are on your lunch hour and you are in need of lighting-fast service, this would not be the right place for you.  I think the quality of the food is very fresh too.", "author": "Kandi K."}

I had lunch there last week and today (prior to my humongo letdown at Miette - see other review) and had the red hibiscus iced tea both times.  Beautiful and yummy!  The spicy pork noodles are indeed spicy and delish and the tea-infused wanton soup was equally delish.  It's never crowded and you'll pay about the same as you would at Taylor's or any of the other Ferry Building spots but without the noise and with nicely prepared food (although I'm certainly not one to turn my nose up at sweet potato fries at Taylors).", "author": "Nicole B."}

The last time I went to this place, nearly two years ago, it was quite a pleasant experience. Today, not so much. \n\nThey were clearly understaffed and it took quite a long time to get our waiter's attention to order. When one of my friends requested the vegetarian version of the dim sum plate, she was asked \"Is shrimp OK?\" \n\nWe then waited quite a long time for our food. It didn't arrive, in fact, until we flagged down the other staffperson there and got him to check. \n\nAs for the food itself, it was just OK, not great, and nowhere near worth the $9/plate. The issue was not so much the flavor but the fact that the wrappers and even some of the fillings were somewhat dried out, indicating that the dim sum had been sitting out for a while. \n\nWorst of all, we figured out halfway through the meal that they had swapped orders, giving my friend the full-meat version instead of the vegetarian version she had requested. (Luckily, she's not hard-core about this, but for someone else, it would have been disastrous.)\n\nThe servers themselves seemed overworked and not particularly happy to be where they were... something of a downer as well.\n\nYes, the tea itself was lovely, but really not worth the hassle.\n\nI really hope that their management gets their act together and saves Imperial Tea Court; I know it's capable of serving up a better experience than this.", "author": "Katherine F."}

Funny low tables that anyone near 6'0 can't sit at. Whenever someone tries, the chairs go CLACK CLACK CLACK on the concrete floor. Not good for a soothing zen atmosphere but then you are in a mall. My black tea was good, mom's green tea was... an acquired taste. Very limited food menu so you better be into the tea. Curry stew is good though. Call it 2.5 stars.", "author": "Dave K."}

They were okay, but VERY over priced.  there's a tea store off clement street that has better tea for better prices.  This might be a good place to visit for tea in the shop, but I recommend that you buy your tea (to drink at home) elsewhere.", "author": "MyTwoCent s."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-04", "description": "This place set up a nice tea service in terms of having a variety of all the tea types (white/green/oolongs/ pu-er) if a little shallow in its depth of exploring the more unknown varieties of each. The tea was delicious. The snacks which accompanied were pretty mediocore.. The gal pushed heavily the green tea covered walnuts, which we got as part of the snack sampler, but i found them pretty sugary and processed and liked the almonds best, as i think my date would concur. I love the simple act of great coversation over strong lovely tea, so i can't go any lower than 3 stars as they provided this and the Ferry Building is one of my favorite SF instiutions, foodie that I am, but overall I think SF offers much better spots for tea service, from China town to the wonderful Samovar.. and the food here offered as snacks clearly came out of bags flown over from Beijing, which is kinda gross.. Plus, no soy milk was available to \"creamy\" up my tea.. I know, i should be more hard core, but sometimes i like my tea like a soft cloud.. Anyway, a great time due to the company and nice tea, but not necessarily added to the rotation.", "author": "Rachel S."}

I think it's better than A&Js (Cupertino / San Jose) because they don't overwhlem the soup with chilli oil or other flavors, but keep the beef soup flavor in tact.  You can ask for the chilli oil on the side if you want it spicier.  Cheap too for a filling bowl of noodles (the brisket is nice and soft).", "author": "Toto T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-24", "description": "The spicy beef teahouse noodles are so incredible.  I fantasize about them often.  Great tea selection and presentation.  One star down because they raised prices recently, and it wasn't super reasonable to begin with.  But great location and atmosphere.  Dim sum platter is just \"meh\" but I still get it every time because I like all the little treats.", "author": "audrey y."}

If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty of better options in the ferry building.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-31", "description": "the tea tasted ok (iced lichee green) but unforgivably- i sucked up a small piece of plastic through the straw, presumably from the pack of frozen litchees.  i don't have a problem of frozen lichees, but i do w/ swallowing plastic.  i spit it out.\nthe food was awful, the curry was tasteless (it really was- just bland), the dim sum all tasted the same- like steamed soggy warm dough packs.  the service was horrible - the hostess was annoyed and the waitress ignored my request for hot sauce.\ngiven these prices, the whole experience should be better, this is the type of place that gives chinese food a bad name.", "author": "Kim Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-02", "description": "We were attracted by the traditional Chinese look of this place. The tea is good, the beef stew is very nice, but the waiting time is definitely too long which took me 1 extra hour for my lunch break. If you are not in a hurry and into teas, then you can sit there enjoying teas. Not recommended for people who has a tight schedule. It always fun to explore a new place with the right person though.", "author": "David L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-26", "description": "I go here from time to time because I love the spicy noodles with beef, and it's close to my office.  The food is good, although at 11 bucks it's overpriced.  I suppose the main reason for my 2-star rating is the service.  Getting them to refill your drink is difficult--they don't check on you.  Also it's best to have cash that you can leave on the table when you're ready to go.  Even during lunchtime when you'd expect them to be used to turning over the tables quickly, you have to BEG for your check or get up and walk to the cashier to ask for it.  Tasty noodles though.", "author": "Jim D."}
