While the ready made multi item cafeteria style lunch (think Panda Express) is good, what I love is their cook to order dishes. In particular the fish with corn sauce and mapo tofu.\n\nI've gone here and ordered these dishes so often the cashier knows me already.  The lunch portion size is generous and price is good for a downtown SF lunch. \n\nBeware that dinner prices double though. For the same dishes  the price is double and doesn't come with rice like the lunch order does. \n\nNote the $10 minimum for credit card charges.", "author": "Joanne T."}

The food was rather oily, I felt it had the tell tale signs of MSG written all over it, and the customer service was typically what you would get at a Chinese restaurant - explicitly, you get treated like a number, not a customer. Tried their lunch combo, and the cashier charged an extra dollar because I paid by Debit card, and did not even bother asking me if I was okay with it (a note on the cashier machine says minimum of $10 for debit/credit cards, else there is a surcharge). \n\nHad read a lot of reviews before going here, expected a pleasant experience, but very much disappointed with quality of food, service and atmosphere. Likely never going to go again :-(", "author": "Raj D."}

I love and hate New Ming's all at the same time!  \n\nThe love is for the food - the food is phenominal.  I have never tried the Hofbr\u00e4u so I have no opinion on this however I always get the same thing as it is hard for me to embrace change.\n\nToday I was craving the house wonton noodle soup.  I get this EVERY TIME I order however today was different because I called-in my order rather than do my normal walk-in and order for takeout.\n\nToday, while at work, on a post-it, I wrote New Ming's telephone number and what I wanted to order: House Wonton Noodle Soup and Salt and Pepper Chicken wings (I originally wrote Korean but changed my mind).  I made the call; I looked at what I wrote on the post-it and ordered.  The nice woman who answered the call repeated my order and I said yes House Wonton Noodle soup.  What I did not realize is; she only registered and repeated Wor Wonton Soup even after I repeated HOUSE wonton noodle soup.  \n\nNeedless to say, I picked up my order ($26.75 + $2.25 tip pricey for two items).  I walked back to my office, placed the SOUP in a SOUP BOWL and then noticed the abundance of wontons and LACK of noodles in my NOODLE SOUP.  Huh?  Scratches head.  \n\nI rechecked my post-it and it had the correct name of the soup I wanted.  I then re-called New Ming's and explained that I did not get noodles in my soup and was met with \"that's because you order wonton soup, wor wonton soup.\"  I said, \"No. I know what I ordered and it was the HOUSE wonton noodle soup.\"  \n\nBut here is a conundrum and I have to ask:  Wouldn't it be expected that, if someone ordered HOUSE blahty blah blah soup, and there are only TWO HOUSE soups listed on New Ming's menu: House Wonton and House Udon soup, would it be reasonable to expect NOODLES of some kind in my order of the HOUSE soup?\n\nEvidently this assumption was completely missed by the nice woman who took my order.\n\nTo reconcile our differences, the nice woman on the phone suggested that I BRING EVERYTHING BACK and she will TAKE OUT some of the wontons and ADD the noodles.  I asked her to repeat this, she did, and I heard her correctly, BRING EVERYTHING BACK and she will TAKE OUT and ADD.  I said thank you and hung up the phone.\n\nUM.  For some people TIME IS MONEY and like these some people, losing my time equals losing my money.  Instead of taking the time to pour the soup back in to the plastic container and walking back over to New Ming's, I decided to chalk this experience up as a lesson.  No more calling my order in but if I do, I need to be VERY CLEAR in what they repeat back to me.  \n\nAs for the soup, it was good, but it lacked, well, you know, NOODLES.\n\nAs for the Salt & Pepper Chicken wings = Awesome and abundant (I wasn't expecting that many).\n\nAnd now for your viewing pleasure.", "author": "Cris B."}

You can go with their daily specials at the counter (you point, they scoop), but they also have a pretty sizable menu you can order from. \n\nThe lunch specials are large and quite affordable, but if you order items a la carte you could rack up the cost quickly. I ordered some Chong Qing wings as recommended by other places, as well as beef spare ribs with bell peppers over rice, a classic Hong Kong diner dish.\n\nThe wings came crispy, spicy, and delicious in all their greasy glory, but I think the recent craze of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) have moved my bar up. These compare well but aren't significantly better (read: if there's a KFC place nearby you don't need to come here). \n\nMeanwhile, the beef was a bit too tough, but the sauce was great.

I was in and out of there in about 5 minutes during lunch time.\n\nThey do have a full menu but for lunch, you really just want their $6-9 lunch specials, which comes with your choice of chow mein, fried rice, or steamed rice. And they probably expect you to order the lunch special too because as soon as you get to the counter, they point to the lunch special and ask if you want chow mein, fried rice, or steamed rice. Everything's really quick and you have to be on your toes so you don't hold up their line.\n\nYou get to choose up to 3 of their lunch items that they have out, so it's kinda like Panda Express. But better because I think it's more legit than Panda Express (the staff speaks full-on Cantonese or Mandarin). I got the Sesame Chicken and Mixed Veggies with my chow mein. There's a hint of honey mustard in the Sesame Chicken, which is interesting. So it doesn't super taste like sesame at all actually. But it's still yummy. The broccoli was crunchy, just the way I like it. The chow mein was kinda bland.\n\nThey do accept card but minimum $10.

Not spicy.\n\nChung King Wings: still my favorite version of this dish in the city. Salt, Red Chiles, Sichuan peppercorns\n\nSalt and Pepper Green Beans: a traditional Chinese favorite, here with Sichuan peppercorns\n\nHot and Numbing Spicy Fish Pot: there's two soups you want to order here, it's a bit easier to order from the big menu with the pictures so that you can tell the \"red\" from the \"clear\". This is the clear, served on a burner to keep it hot. Forget about ordering this one out. You have to eat this one in. Chief counsel at our company described the floral flavor of this dish as \"almost pretty\". Perhaps too much of a kick to be pretty?\n\nClay pot beef and bamboo shoot: More tendon than beef but who cares? Salty and sweet and rich, punctuated with bamboo shoots.

What's a pushup chicken? It looks like chicken lollipop. Let me explain. Separate the chicken wings by cutting between the drumette and wingette. For the drumette with the knife scrape the meat on the bottom to push the meat to the other side of the bone. For the wingette first cut off the wing tip. Then take off the smaller bone. With the remaining bone push the meat from one side of the bone to the other side. That's how dish is named as pushup chicken. With the gravy, sweet corn, and rice I referred this dish as the Chinese version of a country style fried chicken. The chickenjoy at Jollibee is similar to this dish except the pushup chicken uses only chicken wings. Due to the uniqueness and taste of the pushup chicken my boss and I would order this dish at the Old Ming's if we were craving for fried chicken. For a couple of years it seemed every other Friday I would go to the Old Ming's for pushup chicken. The Old Ming's has been closed for several years as most of the employees have moved to the New Ming's.\n\nAt the New Ming's I was sadly informed that the pushup chicken isn't on the menu anymore as the cook who used to cook this specific dish had retired. However one dish I used to order at the Old Ming's is at the New Ming's - fried flounder fish over steamed rice. What makes the fried founder fish special is the breading. It is heavily breaded that makes this dish very crispy. You would think heavy breading would make the dish heavy when it's fried but it's the total opposite. The heavily breaded flounder keeps the meat moist inside. The head, tail, and fun is so crispy you can eat them as fish chips due to the heavy breading. Since the flounder is heavily breaded the breading isn't soggy. The flounder isn't a thick fish but with this dish you can eat the bones inside the fish. The heavy breading is similar to fish and chips but instead of a filet fish you get a whole fish that's deep fried. \n\nWhen I come to the New Ming's the only dish I order is the fried flounder fish. I hope one of these days the pushup chicken is back on the menu.", "author": "Gerald R."}

I was stoked that they had hot oil at all the tables.  \n\nIn comparison to the fancier spots that you'll find Downtown this place doesn't stand a chance.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-03", "description": "New Ming's is my go to lunch spot. I could really eat here every day but I try to limit myself. A lot of people walk in and just see the lunch buffet where you can pick and choose what you want. To me this isn't Chinese food, but to each their own. But to be clear, I have actually never tried the buffet so I can comment on the quality.\n\nGrowing up going to Oakland Chinatown for dinner every week with my family to have authentic Chinese food I can definitely say I've been spoiled with some great Chinese food. It's really hard for me to find other Chinese restaurants that have that comfort food feeling every time I go back to Oakland but New Ming's definitely gives me this feeling. They have all of my favorite dishes growing up that I can rarely find elsewhere. I have yet to leave New Ming's unhappy.\n\nThe trick is to make sure that you order from the menu, not the buffet. There are a plethora of delicious dishes that most people over look or don't even know exist that you can order there and those are the best! They are made to order and come out of the kitchen piping hot! Also a requirement for me. I like my Chinese food super fresh.\n\nMy go to dish is rice cakes with minced pork. That is my childhood in a dish and it is delicious ever single time. My sister will actually take an uber to trek across town to have lunch with me here just for the rice cakes. We'll often share a plate of red chili oil wontons as well too. The wontons are absolutely perfect and the bowl of red chili oil is very deceiving. Since there is so much chili oil you assume that you are going to burn your mouth off but is actually very mild and the perfect kick. I'll even take some of that chili oil to put on my rice cakes!\n\nTheir wonton noodle soup is perfect for a rainy day or if you just need a bowl of soup. I love their black pepper beef when I am craving a rice dish with a kick of spice. Their dan dan noodles are great as well. Just make sure not to wear white that day because the chili oil splashes every where! I made that mistake once and learned my lesson within the first couple of bites. There is still so much I need to try there and I can't wait. Every time I walk in I see something else I want to try but it's hard to not get the rice cakes.\n\nIf you walk in and all the seats are taken don't turn around. There is a secret dining room downstairs that you can go down in eat in too!  This review should really be a 4.5 stars. I absolutely love this place but can't exactly give it 5 stars but it is so close! Overall, if you are looking for a quick lunch spot where you want to get some great Chinese food, I highly recommend New Ming's. And when you come in, don't be surprised when you find me downstairs noming on some rice cakes.", "author": "Sabrina D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-19", "description": "This review is purely on New Ming's poor business ethics, not on their food.  I have been ordering their food for takeout since I moved to the area mid August.  I like their food.  I started from ordering 6+ dishes each time a couple of times a week to now only 1-2 dishes per order once a week or 2 weeks due my suspicion of their intentional hidden overcharges.  After I confirmed today that they have been overcharging me by rounding up to the dollars without letting me know about it and they admitted that's their normal practice to round up the cents.  Ever since I noticed that I have been overcharged after my 4th large orders, I brought it to their attention and asked them why the total amounts are more and the tax percentage they are charging.  They told me they charge 8.75% which is normal.  At the time they told me that they charge 10 cents for each bag which is fine but I was still charged more than the # of bags.  I let it go at that time.  Most merchants ask in advance if we want bags before charging us for them.  They however advised me that I need to notify them in advance that I do not need bags.  Ever since I notify them in advance that I have my own bags and have been ordering one or just two items to test if the total amounts would be more accurate without the hidden overcharges.  That worked for a few orders with accurate total amount or just with a few cents round up by them which I don't think it's ethical.  Most ethical businesses would check with the customer if it's ok to round up the two cents.  If they don't want to check with the customer and don't want to deal with the pennies, they would round it down.  I have always paid with credit card which wouldn't cause them penny issues.  Not sure why they think it's ok to automatically charge their customers more.  But if just a few pennies, even though I don't appreciate them rounding up without my permission, I wouldn't bother bringing it up again to them and cause confrontation.  But they overcharged me again after I placed a larger order (only 3 items) today.  After I noticed that I have been overcharged, I have been calculating the exact total amount I should be charged for my orders before I go to the restaurant.  Today my order total should be $37.90 and the total they gave me was $38.  I asked her how did you come up with $38.  The accurate total amount should be $37.90.  She told me that \"no problem, we just round up the small numbers.  If the dish is $12.98, we round up to $13.  No problem.\".  I said to her, no problem for you but there's a big problem for me.  First of all, I do not like to be overcharged for the hidden price increase.  Second, it's unethical and deceptive for them to round up without their customers' knowledge.  The items from my order today were $12.95, $12.95, and $8.95.  I don't know how she rounded up to adding 10 cents more.  I also do not understand how they believe it's ok for them to round up from $12.95 to $13 at the time of payment without letting their customer know about it.  It's upsetting that they have been telling me one lie after another and they don't add up.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried to believe they made mistakes, but now knowing that they knowingly overcharge their customers without their customers' knowledge and believe there is no problem about it, that bothers me.  What else they have been stealing from their customers secretly?  It's unfortunate that I have to give up dining at this restaurant and no more takeouts from them.  I like their food so far.  \n\nI'm not sure if New Ming's owner is aware of this unethical overcharging behavior by their employee.  If New Ming's owner is not aware of it, then they should have a talk with their employees regarding this matter and find out who's been benefiting from all the overcharged amounts.  10 cents x 100 orders is $10 and my earlier larger orders were overcharged by dollars.  That's some bonus income someone's been benefiting from.", "author": "Gina W."}

Well, Old Ming couldn't have done any more mediocre job in the kitchen than New Ming. This is standard Chinese take-out food done up for the dinner crowd. And why would anyone come here when Henry' Hunan is just a block away? \n\nOh, I have the answer. A break in routine. Y'see, Jamie W. and I always go to Henry's for our Chinese quick fix, but after an evening of non-conformist art at MOMA, a change was in order. So we tried this place just as they were closing. They were rolling up the blinds on the back wall to expose the next day's lunch menu. I don't think they were happy to see us since a silent surliness was palpable in the air. We ordered quickly so as not to amass a tidal wave of resentment from the staff. \n\nWe ordered the $4.95 plate of six Potstickers (see photo). They were fine, just on the nondescript side. The $7.95 General Chicken was on the gelatinous side with the chicken flavor fairly minimal as it tasted a bit packaged (see photo). To their credit, there was lots of it, but it wasn't take-out-box-friendly. The best dish was probably the easiest one for them to prepare, the $7.95 Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, which were delicious with all the chopped chiles and grated peanuts on top (see photo).

No doubt a lot of their dishes are very oily (just like all the other Chinese fast food places), but if you're a spicy food lover like me, you'll love the Cumin Pork. It's a drier dish, mainly just heavily seasoned pork with bits of of celery bits and cilantro. The downside is that there's not much veggies. I usually just get a side of their mixed veggies (broccoli & cauliflower mix). Their mixed veggies are made pretty well, just steamed and lightly salted. Unless my meat dish is not that salted, then I would get the eggplant or string beans with meat. If you're planning to get their 1-item lunch special ($4.90 after tax), you would have to forgo the veggies.

There was nothing fried about it. \n\n- Orange chicken - Not bad, but overly crunchy, and a few pieces were actually burned.  The sauce was way too sweet.  I will give them credit for preparing the pieces smaller than most places do - they were truly bite sized.\n\n- Broccoli beef - Totally average steam table broccoli beef.\n\nOverall?  You will probably get better Chinese fast food at Panda Express.  \n\nNow, there were plenty of people in the restaurant eating food that looked SO much better, presumably ordered from the regular menu.  That's probably worth trying some day. \n\nOne thing to note:  they DO accept credit cards, but there is a $10 minimum.

At dinner, when the horde of people are not as visible, you get much more attentive care. Not surprisingly their prices also go up to about $10-$11 a plate at night.\n\nThe atmosphere feels more like a cafe or a fast food joint than a restaurant. Seats are limited during lunch and it gets crowded pretty fast but they do have a basement - which eerily looks and feels like a dungeon.\n\nMy opinion is this place is better than B&M (Mei Sing) but Mei Sing does have a better \"atmosphere\" and interior.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-15", "description": "For over 160 years, San Franciscans (or SasaFrassases as absolutely nobody calls them), have struggled to keep up with the daily arms race that is the downtown food scene. Every sunrise brings with it the renewed responsibility to hunt down better, healthier, or just plain different choices, crawling through offshoot alleys, hidden pop up restaurants, and even running after the occasional runaway food truck. \n\nI'd like to think this daily chore has annealed and readied us for life's more pressing challenges. When the big one hits, knowing about that secret getaway alley might come in handy. But mostly it's annoying.  It's nice to throw your hands up every once in a while, fall backwards, and let the hot, greasy wave of mediocre Chinese food carry you back to simpler times.  I hit that wall today, and took a short, contemplative walk to New Ming's. \n\nIn all honesty, I thought the food was pretty good. No matter what some folks say, this is certainly better than, say, Panda Express, or some other run of the mill fast food Chinese joint. Any place placarded with sheets of paper announcing daily specials in both chicken scratch English and Mandarin gets bonus points for authenticity.  That said, it's solidly middle of the road, so don't come expecting even slightly haute cuisine. It's not as fancy or adventurous as Fang, for instance. It's a solid, blue collar place, getting its work done without offense or frills. Those with cholesterol or heart issues (or hearts, for that matter) should avoid coming here on a regular basis, but it's a good choice on those days when the craving hits.

The chow mein wasn't anything spectacular, but the fried chicken pieces has the crispyness, and tenderness that you won't find in a good chicken! Not too much batter either, and not stringy. Get a side of sweet and sour and dip in there for the tangyness of the sauce with the crispyness of the chicken.\n\nThe braised beans could use more spice, but everything was good! really cheap too, under $7 bucks you get a meal and it's a good size helping", "author": "Christopher J."}

Sure, the atmosphere is quite lax/simple for this part of town, but it's a welcome respite in the midst of everything else. The food is basic American-Chinese food, but the service is wonderful once they warm up to you.\n\nWalk right on in, and you may probably wonder if you should just seat yourself or walk up to the counter to order (like at McDonald's). You can do either; generally, when I go here I walk up to the counter and order and just tell them that we're eating-in.\n\nI've been here several times now after returning from the gym; the staff recognizes me and my s.o. now and they always greet us with great service. They were even patient with us once when the rain was pouring down hard outside and we moved ourselves to a different table to avoid the draft that was coming in through the door.\n\nOverall, we go to New Ming's for the service, atmosphere, and reasonable prices.

With that as an intro, lets discuss New Ming's. After ordering off the \"pick three items\" buffet for a few months, I noticed the Chinese patrons lining up to the left, ordering off a menu and having the food delivered to their tables. So, I decided to give it a shot. WOW!!! How shocking to discover that this hole-in-the-wall, buffet-style restaurant is hiding one of the top 3 or 4 Chinese restaurants in SF! The food is outrageously good. And if you have the stomach for it, it is also the best spicy/hot Chinese food this side of Z&Y Lounge (without needing to schlep to C-Town for those of us stuck in SOMA). I have been numerous times with Chinese friends who are equally shocked. The fish and tofu in spicy sauce, the hot pots, the won-tons, EVERYTHING is sensational. Their chicken wings are also among the best (although chopped up into way too small pieces!). The only disappointment has been the stir-fried pork belly, which having ordered it twice, is not what is typically considered port-belly...it is lining or tripe...more like intestine. Tasty, but a bit gamier than I had expected. Otherwise, you can not go wrong. They recently installed a fish tank to display my future dinners....and I hope they don't go too upscale. In the meantime, though, it is an at-least 1X week stop for me. The heat can be intense, but as good spicy food goes, it does not last....Give New Mings a try...you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Brian B."}

I was a little hesitant to try the place because there is honestly no ambiance to speak of- just a steam table at the back of the restaurant and tables and chairs filled with hungry people eating gigantic mounds of food.  Though the prepared items did look tasty, I stuck to my original craving and got two orders of the chicken with cabbage chow mein.\n\nThey were able to whip up those two orders in record time- I was probably in and out in 5 minutes.  The total cost was $12 and there was more than enough chow mein to float a boat.  The chow mein was a little too soft for my taste, but the seasoning wasn't bad.  The chicken was tender and the cabbage was fairly fresh so overall, it made for some good eats.\n\nI'd be back to try the combination plates at lunch, which are very fairly priced at $3.95 for one item or $4.95 for two items.  I think thats cheaper than what you would pay at Panda Express over at the Westfield Mall.

Great service and great food!\n\nUPDATE: So I went to this place again with my friend that lives in the city. We ordered the hot and sour soup and it was so spicy!! The waitress said \"You should have told us you didn't want it that spicy.\" I said \"Last time we came here it wasn't that spicy!!\" and she wouldn't exchange it or give us a refund for it. Both me and my friend could not eat it at all. Lowering my rating from 5 stars to 3 for horrible service. Besides the soup I still like the food here.

This place is a mix between B&M's and the old Ming's - not exactly a hole in the wall, but not a medium size restaurant.  Yes, it is still pretty cheap, and they do take credit cards (yay!).  Good greasy comfort food.\n\nI personally don't worry too much about food quality/cleanliness as everything seems pretty well cooked, but once upon a time in the old Ming's, I saw them chop some broccoli and accidentally drop them on the floor and then pick up those bits and put them back in the pot.

I discovered this one afternoon when I was in and I whipped out my MC  and the lady rang up $10 on my $7.00 order. It never entered my mind as there is a credit card symbol prominently displayed on the front door.  When I questioned this she pointed to a hand written little sign near the cash register.
