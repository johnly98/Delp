Phill gave us the front half of the restaurant and dedicated wait staff to take care of our party of 40 people. The food was great, our glasses were never empty, and Phill was even kind enough to buy my husband a drink in celebration of our wedding. Phill and his staff were fantastic and the entire night went off without a hitch. \n\nBooking was also super easy, and Phill's response to my initial inquiry about holding our dinner at his restaurant was both professional by personable.", "author": "Stefanie P."}

In the case of the Brixton, there are many good things going for it. Nice ambience, decent music, wait wasn't too bad for Halloween weekend. Just one problem that, unfortunately, stood out like a sore thumb and completely put a dampening our evening...\n\nWe arrived at the bar on October 27th at 1:00 am after a Halloween boat cruise. I ordered 2 hendricks tonics and 4 vodka tonics. A few girls in our group also ordered some vodka cranberries. When we went to cheers, we all collectively agreed the bartender had not made us 2 hendricks tonics, 4 vodka tonics, and a couple vodka cranberry's. She had instead made us 6 waters and a couple cranberry juices. All of them, completely devoid of alcohol. Was it my bad tipping? I highly doubt it considering I tipped well over 50% to ensure she would prioritize me the next time I went up.\n\nI went up to the bar and told her we thought our drinks were too light. She immediately became defensive and insisted she had not \"poured us waters\". And like that, our problem was resolved. I was happy knowing that all 9 of us were the idiots. The bartender knew exactly what she was doing.", "author": "Nicolas T."}

The menu is pretty standard, apps, sandwiches, salads, burgers, etc. I ordered the Impossible Burger which I have had a few times at other restaurants. I would have to say, the Brixton prepared the burger patty SO closely to a beef burger patty. Same texture, same taste. At other restaurants, I noted that the impossible burger was good but had a distinct taste. The Brixton was different- so meat-like! Only recommendation including a vegan sauce- vegan mayo/aioli etc. The burger was very dry and needed SOMETHING. I got the half and half fries- tasty, enough for one hungry person, I wouldn't split. \n\nOther than that, pretty standard experience at the Brixton, would come here again.", "author": "Marcie A."}

Recently, I met up with some new friends I made through Bumble BFF to a Bumble-organized event at 7PM on a Saturday. Much to my surprise, the crowd was more relaxed than usually--a huge plus! But the later it got, the more the Brixton started to resemble a rowdy dance club with uncontrollable drunk patrons. Luckily, that night was casual enough to talk to my new friends, but lively enough to have a good time.\n\nThe food was solid, but the service was dicey. Around 9PM, I ordered a basket of sweet potato fries, which was accidentally given to the group next to us. I was suspicious, but didn't question it since they ate it...all of it. After 30 minutes of waiting, I flagged down the bartender (which took an additional 5 minutes), and he realized the mistake. Less than 10 minutes and one round later (over 45 total minutes of waiting), we finally got our sweet potato fries. They were more frantic than apologetic, trying to handle the crowd. I was too hangry to complain.\n\nOverall, I had a great time with my Bumble BFFs. The Brixton is a nice bar to start off the night.", "author": "Joanna S."}

It's purely American, with cool rock and roll music memorabilia on their wall, plenty of TVs spread throughout to watch the World Cup and massive space for seating. \n\nI've been here couple of times now and while my favorite is still their ALL DAY happy hour Tuesday, their brunch is killer. They can accommodate large parties with only a week notice, don't charge cake fee, have fantastic service (hard for a large group!) and amazing food. \n\nJust how amazing?! Pillowy soft pretzel knots with jalape\u00f1o cheese dip, crispy flatbread with a over easy egg on top, delicious beef enchiladas, wonderful roasted chicken breast salad and even decent steak and eggs. The star of the show? The Impossible Burger! \n\nWhat is that exactly? Would you believe this hardcore meatatarian, is now a convert to a burger that is 100% vegan, and yet, it tasted just like the real thing! Upon further research, I've found that the Impossible Burger is made with potatoes, wheat, soy and a molecule called \"heme\" which even gives the meat that bloody color. It's something that's straight out of the chemistry lab and this delights the scientist in me! This burger is topped with lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and mayo. I took a bite out of my husband's beef burger and I swear, I couldn't taste the difference!  If you don't leave satisfied after eating the vegan version of a burger, then stuff yourself silly with their perfectly crispy thin cut fries. \n\nOrder an Arnold Palmer or a brunch cocktail and your Sunday is complete. Now, if only Germany won that match against Mexico, then I wouldn't have a sulking husband at home.", "author": "Janice C."}

It goes until 7 so we got a table at 6:30.  The place is a little dark inside but it is trendy.  We enjoyed the ambience overall but it could have used a bit more lighting for grandma.\n\nWe had a party of three so we decided to share a bunch of the happy hour specials.  They have specials for $3,7,9.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nDemoned eggs $7 (deviled eggs with crab and bacon) without bacon.  The order comes with 4 pieces and they were very good. The crab on top had a bit of a vinaigrette in it and the flavors went well together.\n\nPretzel knots $7. The order comes with two bar pretzels with a side of honey mustard and their version of beer cheese. This was a table favorite and was gone in seconds.  The pretzel itself was hot and soft and could be eaten without the dip, but the dips made it that much better. I would definitely get this again.\n\nGiant meatball $7. This comes piping hot with one giant meatball surrounded with marinara, melted cheese, and 2 pieces of buttered bread. I ordered this because my wife does not eat meat and since we had a third party with us I was finally able to indulge. To be honest I do not feel the need to order this again but the flavors were decent. Our favorite part was actually dipping the bread into the sauce and melted cheese.  It was however a decent size for sharing an appetizer. \n\nFlatbread $9.  I believe that the toppings on this change once in a while but the special this night was sausage and pepperoni.  The flatbread itself was a decent size and the flavor was not bad.  \n\nWe actually ordered an order of fries $3 and broccolini $7 but since the 4 orders above came out well before them we were already stuffed and luckily we had time to cancel the last two items.  Between the 3 of us we had plenty of food and we liked everything overall.  I would come back for the pretzels and eggs for sure and the happy hour drink prices and possibly try some of the non happy hour entrees.", "author": "Danielle B."}

I was pleasantly surprised that the prices weren't astronomical being in this fancy pants neighborhood. It's a semi-loud, gastro pub-ish, but upscale at-the-same-time restaurant. A nice bar area to have drinks, with plenty of tables for both small and large groups. \n\nBeing that is was around 2pm on a Saturday, the menu was brunch. It had all the classic breakfast items you'd expect as well as salads and burgers etc. My wife and I ordered:\n\nGrilled Flatbread- House-made pizza dough, prosciutto, red onion, mozzarella, cage free egg, arugula. This was my favorite item, it was delicious. I actually wanted pizza with red sauce, but this flatbread with the Brie and egg was the greatest thing ever. Ever. Ever.\n\nThe Brixton Burger- Grass fed ground beef, Panorama burger bun, balsamic red onion, pickles, roma tomato, lettuce, sharp cheddar, plus I added Avocado for a buck fifty more. This was a good burger, but it was just that, a good burger. That flatbread pizza on the other hand...\n\nChorizo Breakfast Burrito- A flour tortilla with spicy Molinari chorizo, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and sharp cheddar cheese. This was my wife's order. She didn't like it. I tried it... I didn't like it. Pass on the burrito, you'll hate that you wasted calories on it. That flatbread pizza though is a different story...\n\nThe Impossible Burger- 100% plant-based burger. Served on Panorama bun, balsamic red onion, lettuce, roma tomatoes, pickles. My family that are vegans ordered this burger. They said it was good but I wouldn't know because real men eat meat. Real men also eat flatbread pizza...\n\nThe service was good and very friendly.

I didn't have them, but he ate the whole thing, so we'll add another enthusiastic thumbs up to those ratings!\n\nMy friend had the kale salad, which he said he really enjoyed; I had \"the impossible burger,\" which looks, smells and tastes like a beef burger, but has zero meat in it, and I loved it. I've been a vegetarian for six months now, and while I miss meat less often than I used to, this was a really fun surprise. Added cheese and avocado and side greens, and it was a perfect lunch (didn't have the bun so can't speak to the bread they used).\n\nThe server was super nice -- remembered my friend, who goes there pretty frequently, by name and by what he orders.

We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and brunch...\n\nAt the beginning of our being there and ordering drinks a waiter got pissed off and hella hyphy with the manager. At first it was awkward for him until we realized all of the waitstaff was on his side. Both my friend and I have worked in restaurants and I currently work for a winery so we understand the dynamic. At the same time the bar is not behind closed doors. You take that shit to the back not in front of all of the patrons. Although not gonna lie, I wanted some popcorn and for them to have microphones. \n\nFast forward past breakfast and the manager comes over and says she has to change the channel on our game to a different one because a different bigger party wanted the other one. The local niners team was on every other screen. Then she tried to say it came from the owners, like the owners are at the restaurant choosing the games on a Sunday and she kinda gave herself up earlier saying it was customers requesting it.

They will not accommodate. This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. This place is only good for alcohol and parties. Do not eat here. \n\nAfter making a reservation, we were told some of the tables were unavailable due to an \"accident.\" Then when we finally got to sit outside, multiple tables complained about the sun and asked if the canopy could be rolled out to provide some shade. They pulled it out half way which didn't help any table and said they couldn't open it any further because it would block the natural light inside. Finally, after complaining the manager they eventually opened the shade the entire way. \n\nNow to the food issue, they have a fried egg sandwich for $12 and it clearly states, \"additional $4 charge for a different sandwich\". This is served with hash browns or potatoes. As a vegetarian and gluten free, I asked for a lettuce bun and to have the impossible burger meat instead of the other meat I was told that the kitchen didn't have time to accommodate those changes. I counted and there were 7 tables in the entire restaurant with people... also, my friend was told her latte would take a min of 10 min because the server had to make it, which is weird because they should have the bar tender or barista helping the server, but whatever. \n\nAfter complaining to the manager about not being able to get my meal he agreed that this was also not okay for the kitchen to say it would take too long. He said let's just order you the impossible burger with the egg for the egg sandwich and you'll be fine. \n\nMy order came, no egg. Also, once the bill came, I was charged the impossible burger price of $18 vs $16 which is what the breakfast sandwich with a $4 charge should have been AND I was charged an additional $6 for hash browns...

The cabbage and pickles added just the right amount of contrast by cutting into the richness of those three ingredients. For the side, you can pick home fries or hash browns. I picked hash browns which ended up being the most comforting choice as they reminded me of a certain fast food chain's hash browns, which I adore. My girlfriend got the burger which she enjoyed.\n\nOur server was nice and attentive. My gf and I were talking a lot, so it took us a while to look at the menu and order. She was very patient. I did have to flag her down for water though as I was trying to rehydrate from the night before. So much so, that I didn't finish my glass of bubbly. Yes, this was one of the few times I left alcohol behind. I felt that delicate!\n\nI had a really nice brunch / lunch with my gf, but that hostess started off our meal with a really bad taste in my mouth. I don't know if she knew she was coming off as rude, so hopefully it wasn't intentional. Subtracting a star from my otherwise four star experience. There's no reason to begin a meal feeling that way.", "author": "Elena N."}

It was drinkable, but when you're buying a cocktail at a bar you want a good one! My friend and I disliked it so much we almost had them make us new drinks, but we aren't quitters. Long story short, don't try to be classy on Halloween and just order a plain margarita. Why change what's good already?\n\nI got the chicken salad. It was okay. Big portion but the size was mainly due to all the lettuce and less due to the other toppings (although there was a good amount of chicken). Chicken was fine but it was dry and lacking in flavor. Again, it's a salad so I really can't be too picky here.\n\nMy friend ordered the steak. If you order ANYTHING off this menu, get the steak. It tasted like French onion soup meats a juicy steak.

I think that's a cute idea for a party but for a bar where you are paying for the drink? That just feels lazy to me. \nMy husband enjoyed his French toast although the portion was large enough to feed all four of us! \nI got their signature breakfast of 3 eggs, chicken sausage and hashbrowns. I could not believe when it came out that the hash browns were just freezer McDonalds style!!

I had to mention that there was 10 of us, and we went back and fourth a few times. She had a puzzled face and found our reservation, and said sorry. She should of/could of review our reservation more clearly before making her dumb-ass comments. \n\nWhen my friends arrived, the same host walked us to our table and it was not ready so we ended up waiting around. Then, our waitress was so impatience about how many of us are showing up and gave us attitude. Due to traffic, my crew made it. Her entire era, face expression, body language and verbal skill were definitely not intact. It seems that she was not happy with her jobs and took it out us.\n\nAfter bunch, I was sitting right next to my birthday friend, the waitress had approached me saying [abruptly] , \"WE CHARGE A $2. cutting fee\", she could/should of went towards the end of the table to ask someone else. We don't mind the fees but it was how she said it. She came out with my friend's cake and our bi-rite cake was all melted. Plus, our waitress had a sour face expression, and made a hand gesture- waved [hurry up]. Next, they had sliced the cake and passed it without napkins or utensils.

Their menu looked okay, so I figured, why not!\n\nWe went during one of the NFL playoff games to a super packed restaurant full of fans watching the game on one of the many big screen TV's throughout the dining and bar areas.  When we arrived, I noticed it was super loud due to the restaurant nearly at capacity and with audio of the the game streaming through the speakers.  \n\nWhen the hostess returned to the stand, she told us our table wasn't ready, but the group sitting where we were supposed to dine was just waiting to pay their bill.  I didn't want to sit inside at all, so fortunately, they had a few tables readily available with heat lamps above us, so we were escorted back outside.\n\nService from our server was spotty since it was crowded and they were busy.  My husband ordered another round of the cocktail he enjoyed, but it took at least 20 minutes for it to come out.  I sipped on a Moscow mule that I wasn't in love with, so I didn't bother ordering another round.\n\nWe both started off with a cup of clam chowder and that was just okay.  It could have used a lot more flavor, I can't recall the last time I salted my food, but I caught myself salting the clam chowder of all things, lol.  We also ordered the Demoned Eggs served with aioli, shallots, celery and topped with fresh Dungeness crab and bacon bites.  This appetizer was delicious, one of the better deviled egg dishes I've had.  I think the combination of the crab and bacon topping won me over.\n\nOn Sundays, they have a prime rib dinner special with veggies and a loaded baked potato for only twenty bucks!  Since we got there at 5pm, our server had to check if it was ready (which is available starting at 5:30 on Sundays).  My husband opted for it and it was a good sized cut, he enjoyed it.  I ordered the cornmeal fried chicken salad.  It was good, but it was way too much salad for just one person to eat.  I loved the taste of the chicken and like that it was lightly breaded.  I thought I ate enough of this salad, but still left a lot of goodness behind since I got full off our appetizers.  I also ordered the combo of sweet potato and regular skinny fries, but hardly touched it.  I guess our eyes were bigger than our appetites during this visit, lol.  It was good, but just too much food for us to consume.\n\nOverall, The Brixton was good, but not great.  Service was slow, but that was because of the game being on and their restaurant completely full.

This review will specifically focus on brunch though.\n\nA must: Bloody Mary - delicious, generously sized, and a good variety of garnishes. yum! Get's two thumbs up on our roommate bloody mary tour of SF!\n\nMains: I'm a benedict fan for brunch, so I've tried two of theirs (they have an impressive 6 varieties of benedicts). The fried chicken benedict is good, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Definitely not a healthy choice, but great for an indulgence. The spinach and roma tomato florentine deserves a solid 4 stars - tasty, good portion sized, and fresh ingredients. I'd definitely get this again.\n\nSides: the home fries are super yum - I love that there is bell pepper and onions mixed in with the potato chunks. The hash browns are much less impressive, they look like they came out of a freezer box. I think they can do better here...\n\nSo in summary, my ideal brunch here looks like: Bloody Mary and an Eggs Florentine Bene w/home fries. \n\nService is great - very friendly and accomodating staff.", "author": "Krista S."}

She flatly refused to return my credit card, and denied service in a more rude and abrasive way than I've ever seen before. It was a pretty egregious. \n\nA different bartender, from whom I had ordered earlier in the night, finally came and tried to help in the respectable way that one would expect.

My party of 15 spent 3 hours of disappointment. #1 our server showed up only 3 times at our table & only refilling waters 2 times during our wait. She was also a know it all so when I suggested she take the order according to the groups paying together she dismissed it and said she would remember, but of course that wasn't the case at the end. & I'll explain further as you continue reading.\n #2. The kitchen took about an hour and 30 minutes to  push our food out.\n#3. The quality of our food was extremely disappointing (our server didn't come back to check if everything was okay) the fries where salty, the crab cakes where salty and everyone in the table had a complaint. Unfortunately what do you do when your whole party has already waited that long and they are starving ? It was then 9pm and everyone decided to just go along with it we had to be at the second part of the celebration by 10pm. \n#4. The server (African American female about 5'3 in her 20's) makes a disaster with the checks. Consumed another 30-40 minutes of our time because she didn't listen she ended up charging item by item and everything got extremely confusing. But it doesn't end there, I went up to where she was standing with her co worker and I voiced my unhappy time at the restaurant still letting her know I was understanding about the kitchen that's definitely not her fault and what do I get in return: a fake smile, excuses : our party is large and the restaurant is busy (do they not have assigned sections?), and her starring directly at me with her fake smile that let me know she didn't give a crap about my experience. I even explain that perhaps I should instead be voicing that to the manager And then her co worker (Caucasian female about 5'2 in her 20's) helps her with the excuses and also suggest that yes I should speak to the manager unfortunately the manager is also very busy at the moment. So I obviously get irritated and let the server know I don't like her attitude. I walked away before I had more to say.\n My group spend $500+ on basic food/ over salted + an included 20% tip that the the server DID NOT one single bit deserve.  to avoid more wait time wasted and dealing with more than what we had already experienced I didn't talk to the manager on the spot. For that amount of money I would of rather had my birthday at a fast food restaurant and I'm sure it would been a better experience. I don't know what the restaurant will do to recompense  that experience but I am planning to contact their owner or corporate office if they have one because that was unacceptable! Not ONE person in our table of 15 people have interest in coming back to this restaurant. It was a total embarrassment. The only person who deserved our tip was the bar that's the ONLY good thing we had for the dining experience. I really wish I would of never made a reservation here. It was a waste of everything !

It seemed okay - it didn't stand out in any particular way, but that's how I feel about most spinach and artichoke dips at restaurants. \n\nTHE BRIXTON CLAM CHOWDER with clams, white wine, herbs, russet potatoes, garlic, and cream...$4.00 for a cup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brixton-san-francisco#Y23n8v3j3QcxyW461YZQ9w)\nI can be a little tough when it comes to clam chowder, but this one made the cut.  The consistency may not have been perfect, but they made up for it in flavor and the amount of clams they threw in.\n\nGRILLED NIMAN RANCH PORK CHOP marinated in a hoisin ginger-lime sauce with bacon, Brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes...$21.00 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brixton-san-francisco#Ye-PtmMvu-fGSNY2c_zhLA)\nI'm conflicted.  The potatoes and Brussels sprouts were great, and I liked how the chop was largely moist despite its size.  And although it created a lot of charring, the flavor of the marinade wasn't bad.  However, it also made the dish seem so salty!  I don't know if it was just the marinade or the bacon/seasoning as well, but it's a good thing they came by with water as often as they did.\n\nConsidering they were able to accommodate our last minute reservations, and since our server was pretty awesome (and pretty hot), the staff at The Brixton was the highlight of the night.  I'd say their aggregate 3.5 rating is pretty accurate, and I would give the same if I could.  Sadly, despite the service/hot server, the salty and relatively pricey pork chop brings it down to a three.  Still, I wouldn't mind coming back to try other dishes, as well as their brunch menu!", "author": "Mike L."}

It took us about 20 minutes to get in.  Then It took another 15-20 minutes to get our drink orders taken - not a good start.\n\nThere were 8 of us, and after about 10 minutes one coffee showed up.  Then... nothing.  We asked about our drinks and eventually most of the others showed up.  40 minutes after we ordered I asked about my coffee again and finally got it.\n\nThen everyone got their meal except me.  They went to check on it, and it arrived 5-10 minutes after everyone else.  I got halfway through it and found a large black hair sitting on my egg and fruit salad.  After 5 minutes of looking for our server, I eventually had to get up and go find her and ask for a do-over.  \n\nOur friends' eggs were undercooked when they'd asked for them well done.  We ordered sausage patties and got sausage links.  We then ordered some more sausage links and got sausage patties.  Other food just never arrived, even though we asked about it.  The other food that did come was fine though.\n\nWe practically never saw our server, and got no apologies for the late food.  Once things really went off the rails with the bad food we did start getting apologies, and had our coffees and one juice taken off our bill.  But it was infuriating to never be able to find our server and to get such a weird uncaring attitude.  \n\nThe hygiene there was not up to scratch.  In addition to the hair on my food, I saw one person taking food out to tables just open coughing over the food continually.  The guy who brought our water out left smeared dirty fingerprints all over the glasses; I skipped drinking mine.\n\nSuper disappointing as the place has potential.  The menu is interesting, the food cooked properly was tasty, and the music was great (although a touch too loud for Sunday brunch).

Retrospectively, that should have been the first red flag.\n\nWe were seated quickly, which is probably the best thing I can say about the entire experience. We were soon greeted by a clearly brand new waiter who painstakingly wrote down each word from our order, very slowly, and then went back and forth to people out of order to check if they wanted options like home fries or hash browns, what kind of toast, etc.  It was confusing. To be fair, three of us did order a make-your-own scramble item, but that's how it's advertised -- create your own from a list of ingredients -- so they should be prepared to take a range of orders. Not super complicated. The computer where waiters enter their orders was right next to our table and we witnessed our waiter struggling there for about five minutes to put in the orders. Things didn't bode well for our rapidly increasing hunger.\n\nWe also ordered a few coffees and two bloody mary's. (Side note: The waiter asked those two if they wanted to go for bacon in their bloodies; they said yes, and the waiter did not inform them that they would be charged as if they ordered a SIDE of bacon, and they would only get about a quarter of an actual piece.) The coffee and two drinks (visible on the bar for about 10-15 minutes before they were moved to our table) came after the food arrived, and only after we asked about them. \n\nIt turns out that the waiter's painstaking note-taking of our orders didn't help. My scramble was missing two ingredients and I got hash browns instead of the home fries I asked for. My friend was missing one ingredient and another got sausage in her scramble instead of just the cheese she had asked for. My scramble was overcooked and tasteless while one of my friend's was underdone.  \n\nAlso, the \"hash browns\" are clearly reheated rectangular blocks of frozen potato. Not shredded, not fresh. Reminiscent of McDonald's except McD's hash browns are better. Our waiter recommended the hash browns. \n\nOur waiter did not return once to check on us, refill waters or coffee. Another waitress refilled coffees once. \n\nAll in all, one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I admit this is not a place known for its food, but it's a popular enough place on Union. I'd at least invest in making some fresh hash browns.", "author": "Elena K."}

We decided to end the night with some drinks down the street at BRIXTON. The vibes were positive, the ambience of the venue was just fabulous... FOR A WHOLE 2 MINUTES. We sat at the bar top, was getting settled in, and immediately JOE, who had introduced himself as so, tells us that the older woman a couple seats down from us had a ridiculous bar tab and hopes the young man she is with \"gets lucky\" implying that with the type of money she was spending he should be going home with her without a doubt. He prints out the tab, points at the total in disbelief and proceeds to act very nonchalantly of his actions and comments, crumples up the tab and proceeds to point out her new total as the night continues. What bartender/professional would ever do this??? Why would it be the business of any other patron in the establishment? The woman he spoke about bought rounds of drinks for different groups in the bar throughout the night. He made snarky remarks and even worse condescending comments about her to us, acting one way to her face - even calling her \"babe\" - then turning back to us thinking he was so cool to say such mean and harsh things about her, what a child. \n\nBottom line, he clearly took advantage of this woman. Her tab, as he heavily flaunted it, easily tripled in a matter of an hour. One charge specifically was a 127 count of $12!! There was food on the tab which was never rightfully requested as well. He closed out her tab, she signed for it and wasn't gunna mention a peep until my friend called him out on why her tab spiked into the THOUSANDS. He tried to defend himself by saying he didn't know, she ordered all those drinks for half the bar, then tried to blame it on a technical error, never apologized upfront to the woman until I called him out on it. All he did was try to cover his ass, even told her to cross out what she didn't order and give him a dollar amount that she were to pay! I told him no, coming from the business he should know to detect any outrageous charge before presenting to the customer, told him he was to void her closed out tab, split off the charges that did not belong to her, and reprint the tab - which seemed like a hard task for him to even do. He was sweating bullets, you could tell he knew he was in deep POO. He tried so hard to resolve what he thought he could get away with, his demeanor changed from the beginning of the night as an arrogant ape to a dog with his tail between his legs. Poor bartender girl tried getting involved where she clearly shouldn't have and tried blaming the customers for disrespecting her when they tried explaining what was going on. Joe even told her to stay out of it, she had no clue what was going on and butting into the situation making it worse causing more escalation to the defense of the woman that was being majorly screwed over! Only reason I could think of why this girl bartender was getting heated was because the supposed $500 tip was supposed to go in her pocket since Joe is a \"manager\" or something. Great scam guys. \n\nTo end this rant, JOE... you're a crook and a bad actor and a disgrace. BRIXTON, I would not recommend to anyone unless you constantly want to check your tab for discrepancies, this was the most uncomfortable experience and I would never ever ever ever return.", "author": "jessica w."}

So the assessment is quite limited.  But my pulled pork sandwich was DAMN GOOD, and that alone will draw me back in.  Overloaded with juicy pork, this was a winner.  Great, generous portion, and loaded with tasty crispy fries.  The items being dealt to tables around me were good, and the folks at the bar on this random mid-Friday afternoon looked plastered and happy.\n\nThe restaurant features a nice outdoor patio to go along with their spacious interior.  The motif is some sort of rock/musical theme- not quite the Hard-Rock style, I'd say more of a Fillmore Theater/Haight-Ashbury poster shop motif.

Last night, a Saturday, the bar was packed, as per usual and I bought myself a glass of wine and a cocktail for my friend. I made a HUGE mistake of leaving my tab open with them. After we finished our drinks, my friends and I decided we wanted to go somewhere a little quieter. I approached the bar and when I got one of the bartender's attention, I asked if I may please pay my bill. He told me he would be just a minute, which was absolutely fine with me. While I was waiting, a female (brunette, glasses, exercise clothes) was taking the order from a customer whose first language was clearly not English. The bartender asked him if he would like to keep his tab opened or closed. He either could not understand her or could not hear her over the music and other noise. He asked her to repeat herself and she snapped, \"Open or closed!?\" After he answered, she turned to the register's screen and loudly said to her coworker, \"Open or closed! How fucking stupid can you be that you don't know what the fuck that means?\" She said this loud enough that not only could I hear it, but the customer she was referring to could as well. \n\nA few minutes go by and I remind someone behind the bar that I would like to close my tab. He pulls up the open tabs on his screen and I see my name, and point to it. He clicked it, but never gave me my receipt and just walked away. Confused, I asked another bartender if I could please close my tab. Immediately combative and rude, he told me to check my purse because there was no way that he had my debit card. I told him that I just saw my name on the screen. He pulled it up and said very condescendingly, \"Oh really? Where? Check your purse.\" I explained that someone had clicked my tab but I never received my bill or my card back. He said, \"You know what? You're really being abrasive and I am not going to look for your card.\" I was stunned. At no point in this interaction had I been rude. Confused, I asked him what I had done and if I could please just have my card so I could leave. He refused to help me. Two girls who were standing next to me overheard our conversation and they told me that he was withholding their credit card as well. I truly believed I was going to have to cancel my debit card. I asked him again if he could please look for my card and he kept rudely dismissing me. I told him I would call the police if he wouldn't give my card back and he said, \"You're not going to threaten me in MY bar.\" Behind him, a different bartender lifted up my debit card, indicating that he had found it. No apologies. They ran the card but did not give me a receipt. I asked the rude bartender what his name was and he said, \"Jose.\" I did not trust that this was his actual name and I found a manager who told me that his name is actually Joe. This manager, Phil, was wonderful. I was so upset and confused by this bizarre power trip that Joe had taken more than one patron on a ride for. Phil was incredibly apologetic and told me he would look into it. I told him I wanted this to reach upper management and another employee said, \"Don't even bother. The management sucks here. They won't give a shit.\" \n\nThe moral of the story? This establishment does not deserve your money. Go elsewhere.", "author": "Kaili K."}

My fianc\u00e9 and I arrived around 430 so we missed the crazy brunch crowd and it wasn't too busy with dinner yet so we were able to get seats and immediately greeted by the friendly bartender to grab our drinks.  Reasonably priced for the area ($5-7 beers, $10+ glasses of wine and $12+ cocktails).  The fianc\u00e9 got a Lagunitas IPA and I got a Chardonnay.  I was surprised by the quality of this delicious Chardonnay, light, crisp, refreshing and just perfect on this rare hot Sunday in SF.

We showed up on Thursday and we're seated, then asked for the brunch menu to find out they don't serve it weekdays, we left very upset and it's unfortunate for such a yummy sounding brunch menu to only have it on weekends.

Our friend, a SF local recommended it as good food and a nice ambiance (he was with us). The staff were fast to attend to us (party of 3) and we were seated at the table we requested, by the open doors but not outside (semi al fresco).\n\nThe menu has everything! from eggs, to griddle, sandwiches, burgers, seafood.. as plates went by everything looked so good so we decided to go with a few items: lox and cream cheese pizza bread, crab cakes, spinach & artichoke dip, scrambled eggs, hash browns and... mimosas! The food was delicious! everything came out on time and we were very happy. The mimosa not so great.. the juice wasn't fresh and I was surprised that they didn't offer a weekend bottomless option.

My husband and I ordered a Caesar salad with avocado and eggs with bacon, hash browns and toast.  We got our drinks, but had to ask for sweetner.  Then we had to ask for teaspoons and a knife and napkins.  Forks were on the table.  I was served my toast first by a bewildered looking server and ten minutes later my entree, so by that time the toast was cold.  The  eggs were cold, the bacon barely cooked, and the hash browns looked like they came from McDonalds. My husband's salad consisted of limp romaine lettuce and completely devoid of avocado or dressing.  We waited for what seemed forever to flag down our server, but no one came around to check on us.  Finally, we got up and left.  The foods here is abysmal and the service even worse.  Avoid it at all costs.  There are better restaurants on this street in which to spend your money.", "author": "Karen N."}

We were seated as soon as we arrived.\n\nFOOD:\n*Demoned Eggs (4 pieces) - Pass.  Deviled eggs were topped with bacon bits that were a nice touch (since bacon makes everything better), but also topped with Dungeness crab which caused the eggs to have a fishy taste.\n\n*Fiery Mac & Cheese - Good.  Pieces of cheesy elbow macaroni were sprinkled with chili flakes that gave it a nice kick.  My only gripe?  I wish the dish was bigger.\n\n*French Onion Dip - Delicious and definitely a must try dish!  The dip was creamy and flavorful.  The accompanied housemade chips had a great crisp to them.\n\n*Brixton Burger - The burger was okay, but also not what I ordered.  I ordered a medium rare burger with swiss cheese and added bacon and avocado.  What I got was a medium rare burger with cheddar cheese and bacon.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare topped off with huge pieces of bacon, but I missed my swiss cheese and avocado pieces which usually gives a burger a less dry taste.  Accompanied with the burger, you have a choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or salad.  Get the sweet potato fries. They're cut thin and cooked to a perfect crisp.  Use the accompanying aioli sauce for both the fries and the burger.\n\nSERVICE:\nAlthough our waitress was nice, she was more than often MIA.  I tried to flag her down several times because all three of us who ordered the burger got the wrong order.  Finally I decided to just eat my burger and complain about it later.  She failed to refill our water bottle and had the manager end up coming over to get our bottle.  I mentioned that all our burgers were made wrong and he ended up getting us a round of mixed mystery shots.  Was it a nice gesture? Yes.  Did it really fix the situation? No.\n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking which can be difficult at times.  There is also a paid lot located on Union Street but is a bit pricey.", "author": "Nicole S."}

That morning, I was the first to arrive. I made reservations a week in advance through Open Table so checking in with the host was easy peasy.\n\nAfter waiting no more than 15 minutes, my group of girl friends arrived. We placed orders for their French toast, three different kinds of eggs Benedicts, Carnitas Hash, and a vegetarian burrito. Overall, the food was satisfying. My two favorites were the Carnitas Hash (super moist and savory) and their French toast (stuffed with Nutella and Bananas and coated in Chex Mix - crunchy!)\n\nHowever, I was a bit disappointed with my order, which was the eggs Benedict with fried chicken. The two pieces of chicken was dry and looked depressing sitting on top of two plain toasted English muffins. I think it would've tasted better if there was lettuce and tomato. I also swapped out the hash browns with fruit. C'mon... no strawberries? Instead, my fruit bowl consisted of squishy purple grapes, honeydew, and diced apples. I wasn't very happy about that.\n\nWhat was more disappointing was the disgruntled bus boys. They were rude and looked like they hated their job. I have never experienced such lousy service... one of them spilled liquid on the floor which smelled like vomit (blech) and a couple of them tried to clear our plates when we were clearly still eating.\n\nWould I be back? I don't think so.\n\nHowever, I do want to give a shout out to our wonderful waitress, Jenna.

Awful douchebagel dance music played too loudly. Lots of dumb restaurants confuse themselves with dance clubs theses days, I get it, these retard owners wish they were Vegas club moguls and decide to punish us with terrible music in a vain attempt to be relevant with the \"young people\". In this case however, the decor is a homage to great music. Tons of Clash posters along with lots of other great rock n roll memorabilia. Perhaps even the name is from \" Guns of Brixton\"? So, with great music being lionized on the walls, one question. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BLARING SHITTY, STUPID, FUCKED OUT EDM? Its not a SF ordinance! No one is going to accuse you of being out of touch with the \"youth\". I'm not thirty yet and I would have loved to hear some Clash during my visit.", "author": "Amy P."}

It was good, strong and piping hot.  \n\nStarted with the 'demoned' eggs - $6 - four halves, cage-free eggs plumped with yolks, fresh dungeness crab, bacon, aioli, shallots, celery, parsley & chives.

This was borderline of cold to warm, just odd in temperature.  It was ok,nothing special.\n\nHubby had the carnitas hash - $13 - beer braised pork shoulder sauteed with yukon gold potatoes topped with tortilla strips, avocado mousse, cilantro leaves and a poached egg.  This dish was warm so I'm convinced our waitress left our orders sat waiting for a while.  The poached egg is the best thing of this dish - perfectly cooked with the yolk running over the hash.

Went in for brunch with my family today, the server was new and very friendly. I ordered the breakfast sandwich was described as a fried egg, with cheddar cheese and bacon on an english muffin. What I got was a half cooked sunny up egg on top of the worlds smallest english muffin (about the size of the silver dollar pancakes, smaller than a Starbuck's breakfast sandwich) and a tiny half a piece of bacon hidden underneath the uncooked egg. We all got a great kick out of it, being that it was bite sized, and then called the server over. I apologized and said it was way to small to be $10, and that the egg white part of the egg was not cooked, she agreed and laughed at the size, told me to keep the fries and no charge. \nAbout 15 min. later the manager came over with the same sandwich in hand and showed it to us, asked me what the problem was and went to hand it back to me and told me to order another one if its not big enough! It was pretty rude and pathetic, we were all shocked, I told him I did not want it anymore everyone was finished eating and the egg wasn't even cooked. He got an attitude and then said fine, and asked for the fries back. I mentioned that the server said we could keep them and he just took them out of my hand and walked away. Sadly me, my friends and family will not be back. Some of the food is pretty good, the servers are nice, but the unfriendly, unprofessional and combative manager pretty much overshadows everything. It was prime time for brunch around 11:30 and the place was empty, reading the reviews on here it sounds like this place isn't doing so well, which is probably why it was so easy to get a table for six at 11 am on a Sunday. There are a lot of great places to eat on Union that appreciate their customers and have great food. It's too bad we used to love do brunch here on Sundays with large groups. I think they should just stick to drinks, and they could use a new manager who has a little more customer service experience. Good Luck!", "author": "Sarah A."}

Not just a bowl filled with onions (which I hate), sun dried tomatoes (which I love), and leaves. Not a pasta noodle in sight. I would have sent it back but that would've been my third re-order since the waitress had already messed up my order twice. The possibility of spit in my food was too high!\n\nSo in conclusion, I paid 25$ for a lunch and didn't even eat a whole bite. I took my \"pasta\" to go and gave it to the nearest bum on the street.

No, they do NOT serve brunch at that particular time on that particular day.  I expect servers to be welcoming.  I just DO.  Past that kerfuffle, I like the place.  The space has an air; spaciousness, dark wood,.. a pleasant personality that is matched by the chef's creativity.  As a budding vegan, I was thankful for a wider variety of vegan / veggie options than most establishments offer.  I chose the Ginger Vegetable Stir Fry (wow, that was a lot of ginger), and he selected the Cornmeal Fried Chicken Salad.  We were both quite satisfied.  I enjoyed my Pinot Noir - and again, was happy to have several options.\n\nThere are about five small tables outside and eight or so with sunny window views for people-watching.  I appreciated the convivial vibe, the coolish decor, lively conversation at the long bar, and attentive service.\n\nWe'll definitely stop in again as we're in the Marina often.", "author": "Liana R."}

Try to get a table by their cute fire place! Their happy hour menu has some solid options. \n\nIf you're a white wine fan: they have one of the best rieslings I've ever tasted on their happy hour menu. Kung Fu Girl for $7 a glass. Totally worth it. \n\nI also recommend their tacos... 4 mini tacos for $5! They switch it up weekly (I think?). I've had their beef and their pork tacos, with a side of guac and salsa. It's honestly great for the price and infinitely better than the crappy tacos down the street at Blue Light. Also you can't go wrong with their $3 basket of fries.

Well, makes sense - they probably though we weren't going to come back... but we DID! One  recommendation to the service people - be nice to people because some people will come back. 3 stars.\n\nOther than that, here's what I got at The Brixton:\n\nFOOD: One of the coolest thing is they served their food in cool little dishware. \n\n1. French onion dip with potato chips: the French onion dip came in a small little pot and homemade potato chips on the side. Delicious french dip, very thick in flavor and creamy! Lots of caramelized onions blended with cheese, and aioli. Works well with their homemade potato chips. $7 - 4 stars.\n\n2. 1/2 & 1/2: thin french fries and sweet potato fries with ketchup and aioli something like ranch). Sweet potato fries seemed a little burnt and french fries were soggy, but there were some crispy ones - and those were good. \n\n3. THE BRIXTON BURGER $14. Apparently, the it's grass fed burger? Burger is huge with red onions, tomato, lettuce - the usual stuff. We added avocado and bacon, which made our burger to be $17. For $17, it wasn't worth that much... I can probably get this burger for at least $10 else where and with the same quality. So, I'm sorry I have to give it a 3 stars, just because of that price - it made me sick to see a $17 where I can get it for least than 10 bucks.\n\n**OVERALL: I'm fan of this place, but the price is way to steep.. $17 burger?

The syrup didn't add anything to the dish and there was a slight after taste. I was very disappointed.\n\n2. Carnitas Hash - This was GOOD. This dish contained tender beer-braised pork shoulder sauteed with yukon gold potatoes, topped with crunchy tortilla strips, a silky avocado mousse, cilantro leaves, and a perfectly poached egg.

The music is already good, the booze is reasonably priced, and the hangover brunch is to die for. All we want is a proper dance floor to flail about.", "author": "Ellen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-24", "description": "We popped in here for Sunday brunch yesterday and had a pretty delicious meal.  We split some sort of bread to start that can best be described as a slice of sturdy bread pudding.  It was quite good and the three of us devoured it.  I had the hash, which was very good but did not sit well with me (and I have an iron stomach) - so immediate enjoyment was high; long-term was low.  Our waiter was nice and attentive; the decor was chic and attractive.  Crowd was young and good looking.  So why not four or five stars.  First, a definite half star deduction because the music (which was good) was insanely loud.  We literally had to yell and fake our way through conversations and we were just three people.  A slight decrease would've made all the difference.  But then, hey, maybe they want to create a natural cut-off mechanism for anyone over 30.\n\nThe second and serious deduction (almost bumped it to a two star rating) is for the busboy service.  I found three things totally unacceptable: first, when the busboy grabbed our bread plates before the entrees arrived, he picked up the plates and dumped the silverware off of them on to the table.  I'd never seen that nifty move before; really classy.  Second, as we were finishing up, he came over, said not a word and nabbed our bottle of water.  A good \"f*ck you!\" from him would've verbalized his actions.  Third, we were seated along the wall and I was facing out able to see the entire restaurant.  I was surprised to watch the buser setting up a table because he dumped the silverware onto the chair so carelessly that he had to stop it from going to the floor.  I thought, \"there's no way he'll put that on the tables,\" but sadly, I was wrong.  I know there is nothing unsanitary about silverware that sets on a chair used by a bunch of unrelated people, but it wasn't a very appealing thing to watch and wonder if that's what happened with my silverware.  It was especially unappealing because I had to clean my bench seat before sitting because it looked like a 2-year-old had just finished up brunch on it when we were sat.\n\nAnyhoo, I've never had a complaint about the bus service at a restaurant.  I think busboys have a really tough job with little thanks and always with a great attitude.  But watching the two busers at The Brixton convinced me that they might not all be so well trained for their job.", "author": "Kevin M."}

The salad was good, a decent amount of spinach, probably the only thing on the menu actually worth the price. \n\nOn my second visit, I dropped in and placed an order to go for the potato leek soup with the bartender. He charged me $9.00 for a bowl, I made the ridiculous assumption that it would be a large portion. Upon getting back to my office, I pulled out a plastic container with the same portioning of a cup of soup. The soup was an unappealing beige color, kinda like when you cut up potatoes and let them sit out for a few hours. There was no trace of any 'leek' in the soup what so ever. It was pureed into a runny mush and then topped with some green parsley. $9.00 for a super small cup of brown mush... and to top things off, the bartender forgot about me sitting right there and carried on his conversations with other staff. 10 minutes to pour some mush into a container?

Walls the color of used brick with a wood slat and Tim ceiling, nice hardwood floors, a fireplace and the back wall covered in a handsome black and white print, and vintage rock and roll posters with a 'U' shaped bar in the center.  Three deep, luxurious booths beckon guests toward the back of the room, and a 16 stool bar height Island acts as another space divider.\nI've been pointed toward the really comfy bar to get my between lunch and dinner burger fix and I'm a happy camper looking out all the windows and not long after ordering out comes a white oval platter with a beautiful open face burger, a three hole condiment container and a 4th with some house made pickle slices.  The show stopper on the plate is a small stainless French fry basket overflowing with fresh, hot fries.  Presentation is a scholarship winner and now let's talk burger.  The bun is fresh, lightly toasted, brushed gently with Olive Oil touched with a hint of garlic.  The excellent grass fed beef is cooked perfectly, the high quality Swiss is a melted blanket of goodness and I was bowled over by the Balsamic grilled onions, what a brilliant discovery.

The reason I'm writing the review is because I went there a couple fridays ago, and as a local, I knew Brixton would be super busy on a weekend night. However, I was very impressed with the service I received from my waitress, Brigit, and the busboy, Jose. They were so busy running around all night long, yet they did a great job checking in and making sure my friend and I were well taken care of. We never needed to wait long to order another round of drinks/food or stressing not able to locate the servers when we need her. Thumbs up!", "author": "Jenn M."}

We came here on a whim one Saturday for lunch.  Luckily, it wasn't crowded.  So we were seated right away.  I saw some other families here, so I thought it wasn't too bad of a family venue.  I was confirmed that it wasn't all that family friendly... or maybe not family familiar.  I should've just been thankful that they have high chairs.\n\nOur waitress took awhile to get to us, which I personally didn't like.  She didn't introduce herself.  We ordered when we got the chance, because I wasn't sure when she'd be back.  She didn't know if the sweet potato fries had any breading in it.  We ordered them anyways and hoped for no gluten.  I'm still not quite sure, but I thought this was something that as a waitress she should've known in case of allergies.  \n\nI ordered a chicken salad, which was alright.  They were trying to be creative with quinoa, which I think would've worked if everything wasn't so cold.  I was hoping that the chicken would be off the grill since this was a nice establishment.  But I think it came straight from the fridge, which I personally didn't like since it looks like leftover chicken.  The quinoa also could've been cooked awhile back.  I liked my husband's ahi salad better since I knew that one had to be cold.  Maybe I just chose wrong.\n\nThe blond waitress didn't come to check on us very much.  One redeeming quality about the staff was the one dirty blond guy w/ blue eyes who seemed to be hanging out w/ the staff, but I think he works there because he was helping the other servers move chairs around.  He noticed that we had a toddler, and he gave our boy some crayons to keep busy.  I know I can't expect every restaurant to be child-friendly, but if you've got crayons... just give them out!  I think the hostess and the waitress both just weren't familiar on what to do with a kid.  So I'm very thankful for this one guy, whom I think the management should promote as he seemed kind-hearted and observant of the guests.  When you're a parent of a toddler (even they're pretty awesome toddler), it's great if someone can help to keep the toddler occupied while eating.  It leaves a great impression on the parents that the servers and management care.", "author": "Kaela H."}

They have tall tables and stools closer by the bar area. \n\nI love the Obey wallpaper on the back wall, haha. \n\nThe food! Went with my boyfriend and his mom. We got the ribs, ahi tuna salad, burger, artichoke dip and 1/2 & 1/2 sweet potato fries & regular fries. The dip for the fries was crack. Kept dipping & dipping & dipping...\n\nThe artichoke dip was good too. We were able to share it among 3 people. It usually comes with toasted baguettes but we requested untoasted baguettes. \n\nMy boyfriend requested blue cheese for his burger. The cheese was pretty potent lol. Burger is a good size and comes with 3 dipping sauces for you to choose from. The ribs fell off the bone and it was served with a squash puree. My salad was pretty big although I would have liked a couple more pieces of seared tuna. It was a lot of salad to eat and I didn't end up finishing it & but I was still hungry.\n\nFree soda refills\n\nStays relatively busy all night long, even after happy hour. \n\nGood location.

We started out with the pretzel bread which came with cheese and mustard dipping sauce. Soft, chewy dough + sauce = YUM. As a slightly healthier option I went with the Cesar salad and onion soup for my main meal. The salad was fresh, well dressed and had crumbled croutons mixed throughout. I added the shredded chicken on top which was a nice bonus.

Nothing stand out here, but really, nothing that you could screw up either. I will say that the hash browns resembled those served at McDonald's; they came in patty form.\n\nFor dinner, we started with their spinach artichoke dip, which my whole party thought tasted like canned soup - watery and lacking in flavor. As my entree, I tried their angel hair with tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and chicken. I can't put my finger on what was off, but there seemed to be a trace of wine which did not mesh well with the dish. I also had a bite of my friend's fiery mac and cheese, which was overpowered by the taste of pickled jalape\u00f1os.\n\nOther than the food, 90s music was blaring through the speakers.

Well, they can't. \n\nThe manager - I believe his name is Anthony - is an utter failure. This is the 3rd time I've personally experienced the disdain he has for paying customers \n\nI ordered a drink and politely asked the bartender to please put on the Warriors game (local basketball team instead of what WAS on - the BUFFALO BILLS and MIAMI DOLPHINS on a Thursday night in San Francisco...) and he said he would twice but didn't. Finally he told me his manager wouldn't allow it. So I asked the manager (Anthony, I think). He told me they would put the Warriors game on after the football game was over. He told me the football game was \"almost over\" (there were 8 minutes left in the 4th quarter of an NFL game....) and pointed ambiguously at random guys in the restaurant saying \"uh he wanted it on\" when the guys he pointed at weren't looking at the TV in the slightest. In fact, NO ONE was looking at the TV, which is why I thought it would be no big deal to change the channel. \n\nAfter the manager (again, Anthony, I think) refused to turn the channel, I informed him that my party would likely need to go somewhere else as our plan was to watch the Warriors game. He cockily shrugged his shoulders and said something to the effect of \"fine by me\" as if our business didn't matter to him. \n\nClearly, he did not wish to change the channel because it was \"his bar\" and the wishes of a paying customer were secondary to his ego.\n\nEventually, he cowered and relinquished and turned the Warriors game on (there were still 3 minutes left in the football game, so clearly he was lying about the need to keep it on). But that was after he had already embarrassed himself by trying to be a tough guy and exert his *authority* as manager. It was brazenly obvious that he simply didn't want to do something because he was asked to do it. \n\nPretty pathetic operation.

The other night was a miserable meal at Ristorante Milano, we walked into Cafe Des Amis...the place reeking of bleach had us walking out and today we had lunch at The Brixton. What a mess.\n\nIf you haven't been, be prepared for a shriek-fest. All hard surfaces, huge volume and parallel walls means you have to scream across your table to be heard. Our waitress told us she lost her voice after working here three days. The loudest restaurant I've ever been to with the sole exception of the auditory hell that is Chez Papa at Mint Plaza. In the front of the restaurant is a large open area near the door. I believe it's open because the door offers a torrent of cold air which serves to keep the customers a bit iced. I was chilly the entire time I was there. As far as additional ambiance, I couldn't figure out if the place wanted to be Hard Rock Cafe or a sports bar. What it really was was a place for the Marina crowd to come and be *really happy* and show it. Lots and lots of shrieking girls. \n\nNow...the food. My burger was a generic burger with generic stuff. One bright spot was the sweet potato fries. Unfortunately they were so thin in the frigid air they got cold quickly and were...uhh...sub-optimal. The two gals at the table next to us were seated some time after we were but were served before us. I guess that speaks to service. \n\nAll in all, this place is a mess. I'm sure it's fine if you're a twenty-something in the Marina and want a place to come to be noticed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-26", "description": "The Brixton...an interesting choice of names to attract the gentile Cow Hollow crowd.   Do they even know where Brixton is?  London's answer to Southie Boston and NY Bronx, something named \"The Brixton\" would be better placed in the T-Loin.  Noted as the cannibis capital of London, the locale of a McD's murder, the Brixton Bombing, the Brixton riots, and even a nod from Monty Python, something doesn't quite add up. \n\nLikewise, the ambiance at the Brixton is lacking.  Like it is out of touch with its own identity.  On a torrential stormy afternoon, I walked into a collage of wet umbrellas in the hallway.  As I rustled the rain out of my hair, I was greeted by a Stepford smile and vacant stare.  \n\nPause.\n\nPause.\n\n\"Hi!  Um, there's two of us??\"  \n\n\"OK, where would you like to sit?,\" smiled Hostess Barbie.  OK, she was very nice, I'll admit.  Just out-of-it.\n\nThe choice of seats was a difficult one, as there were several equally tempting options.  The short bar tables near the window, the tall bar tables on the side, the bar itself, or the sexy leather banquettes- big enough to seat 6.  \n\nThe banquettes, it was.  Why not?  It was too early to be crowded, so we weren't wasting precious space for four more.  \n\nLike her hostess counterpart, Waitress Barbie was equally vacant.  And, yes, it's Waitress Barbie, not Server Barbie - that would be way too PC.  This is brash, bawdy Brixton anyway, not the mild-mannered Marina.  Isn't it??  Waitress Barbie was very sweet, but I cannot recall hearing more than one sentence from her in the 2 1/2 hours I warmed the banquette.  And she was never rude, and always attentive enough...just out-of-it.  \n\nNow, I can only write of the ambiance, not the food, as I opted for the liquid grape diet on this day.  And that did not disappoint.\n\nI scanned the room to see if maybe I was just being picky.  Everyone appeared to be having a good time.  The bar was just busy enough to be fun, but not overcrowded.  The short bar seats were scattered with a few couples here and there.  The banquette next to us was filled with a party of 6, hushed but enjoying themselves.  Maybe The Brixton was meant to be an evening affair, not a happy hour one.  \n\nI don't know what it was .  It reminded me of many an LA lounge - trendy,  beautiful, manicured, yet flat and one-dimensional.  Perhaps taking itself too seriously.  Or not taking itself at all.  And maybe that's the issue I have with it :  to be named after Brixton - so steeped in soul and history - I would expect the same of the restaurant.  So, I was left unfulfilled, underwhelmed.\n\nAs I strolled out of The Brixton, three Barbies graced the hostess stand.  In unison, they turned and smiled that gleaming Stepford smile.\n\n\"Bye! Thank you!,\" they chimed, adding their best pageant wave.\n\nI touched my arm to make sure it hadn't turned to polyethylene, and turned to my guest to make sure he hadn't changed his name to \"Ken\". \n\nNow, my point is not to slam The Brixton.  There are a lot of nice elements going on in there.  They just don't quite come together for me.  That being said, It is certainly worth checking out, and I will go back there to at least try the food and test the ambiance at a later hour.   \n\nI fished my umbrella from the pyramid, and exited The Brixton. The rainstorm waged on, and I was, for once, glad for it. 'Cause now I was out-of-it.   But the rain was real.  I closed my umbrella and let the cold droplets bring me back to life.", "author": "Monique B."}

It was topped with crab, some sort of bacon pieces and seasoned perfectly with lemon. I am soup person but not really a fan of clam chowder but everyone kept raving so I decided to try it. Delicious. Creamy, well seasoned, not to chunky not too thin soup. I am a convert, I like Clam Chowder. I saw shrimp cocktail going around and thought, eh always the same. Wrong again, the sauce stepped this up to an amazing appetizer with hints of sriracha in it. Yum. To top off the eating night we finished with ice cream that was specially made for Brixton. I think it was a bourbon, ginger snap vanilla goodness mixture. I am going to say it was the best ice cream I have ever had, no joke. I think the chef got in my head and made exactly what I wanted.  I can't wait to go back to try the French Dip, the brunch menu, and anything else on the menu. \n\nThe bar is great, with casually framed posters and pictures perched on the wall.

I'm sure that doesn't matter very much when it's packed with hotties cocktailing it up, but the space doesn't hold up to daylight very well.\n\nWe went for a late lunch on a Saturday.  It was between the lunch and dinner hour, and the spot we wanted (Rose's Cafe) wasn't open.  We were greeted promptly, and seated fairly quickly.  Our server was initially friendly.  The menu seemed a little strange: all soups & salads with some dip and a burger, but we were starving and pretty easy to please at that point.  \n\nOur food took too long, but not by much, and why quibble with a brand new restaurant?  The burgers were fine, but one was medium and the other well-done.  Both had been ordered mid-rare.  The hunger factor over-rode any will to get this fixed, and we didn't see anyone in time, anyway.  The dip that we ordered to share (spinach and artichoke) arrived after our entrees, and basically tasted like cheese.  The romaine salad with chicken & green goddess dressing might have been the best thing to eat on the table, but wasn't special enough to warrant a return trip.\n\nWhere we ran in to a problem was with paying the bill.  We asked to have it split three ways, and one of us had cash (o.k. I had cash).  Not only was our server unwilling to do this, suggesting that I just give each of my dining companions $20 (my third of the meal would have been $26+tip, not $40), when I asked her to please split it three ways, and offered to do the math, she just took the cash and cards and walked away.  She returned with the wrong amount on each of the cards and NO change.  The money isn't such a big deal among friends, but it just seemed stupid, in this day and age of POS systems, that you can't or won't split a check.  We gave up on trying to get her to make it right and just left.\n\nI won't be back, and I won't send friends.

Here is the deal; I work in the industry and had just gotten off work the Wednesday before thanksgiving and had some buddies hanging out there so I went to join them.  There were two men behind the bar one blonde guy (I never got his name), the bartender, he was amazing.  He was happy to make me a couple drinks and talk to me about the menu even thought the kitchen was closed.  Then there was Anthony the manager. Also AMAZING.  We talked about how we were from the same area and chatted a minute.  Really great guys.  Thats why I feel bad about giving one star. \n\nI had a couple drinks but my friends had quite a few and our tab was pretty high.  I noticed my friends getting pretty wasted and I requested the bill.  Turns out Anthony took care of it for us.  That was one of the nicest things and I in no way expected it.  So I slipped $30 to the bartender for taking are of us.  Right after that the owner, Hugo, who was wasted and smelled of booze was extremely rude to me.  Lets not forget that I was sober.  Well by this point I had had 2 drinks and was relaxing after work.  He made some slurring comments I couldn't make out.  I asked him to please let go of my shoulder.  At this point he asked me to leave.  I turned to tell my friends we were leaving when he mentioned that they were staying.  \n\nI have always hated being in the Marina not entirely sure of why.

We got a table for 6 immediately (unheard of at a new crowded place in the Marina). We got some drinks off the drink menu to start. I highly reccomend the peach martini and the whiskey/raspberry drink. You can tell whoever made the drink menu is a true mixologist. Original ingrediants yet very strong!\n\nWe shared the French onion dip, artichoke dip, pizza, fried chicken salad and pretzel bread. I thought everything was really tasty and reasonably priced. I highly reccomend the fried chicken salad (you can tell the chicken is brined and fried)- the meat is nice and juicy and all the salad ingrediants are fresh.\n\nI also loved the artichoke dip and the pretzel bread (think biscuits). They come with a delicious cheese dip that I couldnt help dipping my fries in- I am a total sauce girl. \n\nThe highlight was however, the dessert. They serve Humphrey Slocombe ice cream and if you've never tried it you absolutely need to. This isn't ordinary ice cream, and the owner informed us that Humphrey Slocombe made Brixton their very own flavor. \n\nDefinitely check this spot out whether its for drinks and apps or a stop on your Marina bar crawl at night time.

What started out as a small family dinner quickly grew into a group of 16, with 6 kids (ages 3 - 12), my 90 year old aunt, a diabetic, several visitors from Humboldt and a NY uncle.  So we were pretty much covering the dining spectrum.\n\nThe notes say the Brixton isn't good for kids, but I'd disagree.  We went early (5:30 pm) and maybe it gets a little louder and rougher at night, but they had a pretty good if standard kids menu (pizza, pasta, homemade chicken tenders) and even my picky eaters liked it.  If you have kids, you know that you like some noise in your restaurants so that your kids don't bother the other diners.  This more than worked for that need.\n\nAcross the table we had a number of good dishes. The half chicken was well prepared, the fried chicken salad was good (maybe a little heavy on the dressing), the short ribs were very tender, soup was delicious, etc.  The wine and beer list was extensive, the prices were pretty reasonable and the service was really outstanding.

Seeing they have around 15 tables open, I figured we'd be able to get a table right a way. It turns out I was wrong. Obviously if I have to wait to get a table somewhere, that's not a problem. The issue was the service we got. The hostess couldn't explain why we couldn't be seated right away. There were people sitting at the bar, but as per what she said, not all of them were waiting for a table. They would certainly have had seats for everybody. Well, I'm actually nine months pregnant and wouldn't mind waiting to order my food, as long as I could sit comfortably at a table while I wait.

We sat right by an open window and were greatly quickly by our extremely friendly waitress. She was so friendly, in fact, my father wanted to adopt her. Sorry I have enough sisters. \n\nBestie had the ahi salad that I snuck bites of. The Tuna was a little tough but the dressing and everything else was the right mix of sweet and tangy. \n\nDad had an open face tuna melt. I had a couple bites too. It was cooked to perfection and next time I am there I might need to order this for myself. \n\nAs for me I had the chicken salad sandwich. Shredded chicken mixed with avocado. I didn't even give anyone else a chance to have a bite. If you know me or have eaten with me then you know it is pretty damn good. \n\nWe all agreed the fries were to die for. Totally delicious. \n\nCocktails.

I have been to The Brixton twice now: once with my hubby and once  (today) alone. The first time I had their French Dip. It was THE BEST FRENCH DIP I have had in a long time. Today I had the tuna melt, in which they use a yellow mustard in the tuna salad. It was a little to mustardy for me. It kind of took away from the taste of the rest of the sandwich. The fries rocked, both times, but they also offer a side of mixed greens instead. They have both regular, lightly seasoned fries and the oh-so-popular sweet potato fries. You can also get a mix of both.\n\nMy tab today came to $22. That was for my tuna melt and a glass of Prosecco. But hey, I deserve a little self-pampering on Friday, right?", "author": "Kathryn M."}

Didn't even look at Yelp before coming. And we had a killer experience.\n\nFirst of all, the ambiance of the place is awesome. It has a feel of swanky british pub going on, but it's also comfortable. I feel like I could go in looking snazzy or just in jeans and sneakers and be fine either way. The bar looked pretty fun but small, but there were some long tables in the general bar vicinity where it would be fun to get drinks and possibly meet other people too. The whole restaurant has a very spacious feel to it. \n\nThe menu doesn't particularly wow, but the food is really delicious. I had the Pork Confit, and I have to say I have never had pork that way in my life. 3 pork medallions, completely tender but crispy on the outside...holy holy. My husband had the beef stew. It was delicious, but I mean beef stew is beef stew (I'm talking about when cooked properly, not out of the bloody Dinty Moore can). For apps we had the Pretzel Knots. They were ok, but the sauces they come with really make them - a homemade cheese sauce and a whole grain honey mustard. I had the Little Gems Caesar. It was perfectly dressed and had delicious crumbled croutons and shaved parm. Yummo. \n\nTheir drink selection is killer. Try the Ketel 1 Basil Cucumber Martini. You won't be sorry. And they don't give you pansy ass drink portions. It's a big martini glass filled to the point where you can drink it without spilling on your first sip. Yes, please.\n\nFinally, dessert. SAVE ROOM! They have Humphrey Slocombe ice creams and they are flipping ridonkulously good. We had the trio of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Creme Fraiche and The Brixton (maple bourbon goodness). I just about made a wet spot on their sweet little leather booth. Good god.\n\nDon't listen to what the haters say about the douchebaggery. Don't be a snob. Try this place.

The bartenders were really cool and tried to make sense of the chaotic-ness and made pretty decent drinks.  I had the bloody mary (yum) and peach ciroc with cranberry. But what made the best impression is their fries! Holy cow!!! They were the bestttt half fries half sweet potato. Even our bartender had a little nibble from our plate haha. Overall a great place and great vibe.", "author": "Ash P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-09", "description": "I went to The Brixton yesterday with a group of about 10 girlfriends to celebrate a birthday.  The birthday girl made a reservation for 11:15, and they gave us space at a huge table toward the back.  What I LOVED was that, in true San Francisco form, we all rolled in over about 45 minutes (we didn't all show up at 11:15 on the dot), and yet they seated us, which most restaurants in San Francisco won't do.  The food was quite delicious, and the portions were terrific for the price.  I shared a breakfast burrito, hash browns, and bacon with a friend, and it was perfect - maybe even a little too much.  The decor is fantastic, with a big bar in the center of the space.  My only complaint was with the bartender.  I needed quarters for the parking meter, and the waitress directed me to the bar.  At first the bartender was attentive and checked for quarters for me, but realized that he didn't have any in his drawer and would have to get some.  No biggie - I went back to our table (literally right next to the bar) so I wasn't standing there stalking him, since I had a few minutes until my meter ran out.  About five minutes later I went back to the bar, and now the bartender COMPLETELY ignores me.  What the...?!?!  Literally ignores me.  He even came over to the register at one point (I was standing at the end of the bar with the register), and didn't even look at me.  I was the ONLY person standing there.  Finally one of the customers at the other side of the bar, seeing my growing frustration, told the female bartender that I had been standing there, and she came over and gave me quarters.  It was genuinely bazaar, and where it not for the rest of the experience being so awesome, I would have given a 2 star rating.  It's a good thing the kitchen has it together!  I'll definitely go back, especially with a group.", "author": "Cori D."}

We ordered 3 entrees: Grilled American Kobe Top Sirloin Steak, Cabernet Braised Pork Short Ribs & Mushroom, Spinach, Tomato Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp. The pasta was not good. The noodles tasted like ramen for some strange reason. I'm a pasta girl but even I could not stomach this dish. The steak was chewy. The short ribs were passable. The standout dish was the sweet potato fries. They were so good that we got 3 orders. The demoned eggs were also tasty. The Cucumber Gimlet was tasty and refreshing.

Drinks, specialty ones, were fantastic and reasonably priced - $9/drink. This includes martinis.\n\nThe food is another story. I think they need to change the chef or step up the menu. The menu seemed too random. Is it upscale pub food? Or are you trying to be a gourmet place? Honestly, overpriced for what you get.\n\nThe skirt steak came out okay warm. It had three onion rings piled on top. No sides. $20. That is a little ridiculous unless you're at a well known 5 star place - like maybe Harris' Steak House. Then they had a $13 burger below. Some pasta dishes, and seafood? Weird.  The skirt steak had no taste, no seasoning.  Either use better cow, or season it. I put horseradish on it to add taste - and it was super hot. Beware of that one. But it was a bit better.\n\nMy advice to the new owners. Change your menu otherwise you're gonna loose business quickly. Small plates, cheaper prices.\n\nWait staff was nice though. Wonder how long that'll last. Seems like most of the marina places - wait staff think they own the world. We'll see. \n\nHoping this sticks around because it has a nice open bar scene which is awesome.", "author": "Lar P."}

Plus, the bar is really large, so despite being amazingly crowded, it wasn't impossible to get a drink.\n\nThe minuses: the acoustics - seriously, who thought that much wood paneling was a good idea?  You can barely hear anyone, but I guess that is part of the scene.  As others have said, it gets really crowded and really loud (we were there at around 10PM).  The other thing that was strange is that the bar area blends right into the dining area, so as the crowd gets bigger, people end up standing right next to all the tables - not a good place if you want to sit down and have dinner without people hovering over you.  Also, the hostesses were initially not very helpful, until the rest of our large party showed up.  They made up for it, but I thought it was a little annoying that it took a large group (and presumably large tab) to get their attention.\n\nI'd give it another shot once they have been around for a while, but it isn't in my neighborhood and I don't see myself making a special trip out there.", "author": "Marienna M."}

The service is initially friendly but not very competent.  For example, three people in my party ordered avocado on their burgers for an additional charge - the kitchen forgot to put them on.  By the time we got the attention of our server - we were half way through the meal.  About 5 - 7 minutes after we alerted the server, she brought out a plate with a sliced avocado - no apologies.  We were still of course charged the full price for the addition.  Unfortunately, this type of omission was a pattern - for example the kitchen forgot french fries and other sides.  Not a big deal by itself, but at the price point and given the options in the neighborhood - it just wasn't competitive.  As a side note, the atmosphere of the restaurant is incoherent.

He actually bitched about us while taking our order, too FOREVER to handle our bill and delivered food that did not reflect our requests.  There was another server (female) who actually compensated for some of his shortcomings, but it still kind of ruins your brunch when your waiter is bitching about your order or your attempt to see to it that the women's orders are taken first.\n\nFood:  We're talking about Eddie's cafe type fare, maybe not as good, at much higher prices.  Hash browns look like they're from Trader Joe's frozen aisle.  Ask for well done potatoes and they'll be nearly raw.  Ask for tapatio and your waiter will simply say 'No.'  Overall, the stuff is edible, but not worth the price (which isn't crazy expensive or anything).\n\nAtmosphere:  Not all that bad.  It's open to Union street, so there's plenty of people watching and it has a modern feel to it.

The drinks (strawberry don royale and vodka cucumber basil gimlet) were outstanding, and the dessert was pretty good but will pass on it next time.  The service we had that night was really attentive too.", "author": "Julie P."}

My true star rating is 3.5, but Yelp won't let me do that.\n\nI have been here several times, for brunch, lunch, happy hour time, and dinner.  As you can see, I really really want to like this place.  Sometimes I do, and then there are the other times... \n\nThe food is good (I mean who doesn't like pretzels and cheese dip), there is a variety of items to choose from, the aesthetic of the restaurant is gorgeous, the service sucks.  I mean really sucks.  Only one time have I had a decent server and I am pretty easy on servers.  The rest of the times it has taken me a VERY long time to get my food (even with a small party) and it was as though bringing my food to me was a favor that the server could not be bothered with.  One time we waited 15 minutes for water. No joke.  I hate the fact that the servers in this place live up to the snobby, too good for your reputation that the marina has because it could be soo good and you are giving us marina-ers such a bad reputation.  Change the servers and you get a solid 5 stars from me.", "author": "G A."}

I made a reservation here for 3 adults for brunch tomorrow.  I have twins that I could either have kept them in their stroller or but them in two high chairs next to one another.  The hostess called shortly after I made a reservation online and lectured me that I did not accurately make the reservation and that I should have said 5 people.  (I had explained the situation when I made the reservation).   I explained to her that I can put the stroller  (which is very compact) up to the table if needed.  She said that there were no tables in the entire restaurant that could accommodate us.  She had a really rude tone throughout our conversation.  We had to cancel the reservation.  Too bad we have eaten there before and people were kind and had no problem seating us.   We actually have sat at multiple tables with the stroller and there was no issues with room.  Our babies are accustomed to eating out as we do it quite often and are well behaved.   I feel completely discriminated against for having kids!  I used to recommend this restaurant to my friends with and without children.  Not ever again.   I will just take my business to the Elite caf\u00e9 or another place that has better customer service.

The drinks were very light, my vodka blueberry had to be made twice to get some vodka in it (for 10$ btw!!!). Also, the party was not really a party, b/c nobody dressed up and also the patrons could just walk in the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "I was really torn about whether or not to review The Brixton.  \n\n\nOn the one hand: \n\nThe Brixton seems like a venus fly trap for the people that I would prefer not to be enjoying a meal or drink with.  If it stays popular I will have the dual benefit of having an easier time getting in everywhere else and be able to enjoy those places without the crowd that I don't enjoy.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n1.  the food was below average -- this is, after all, the most important factor about a restaurant, right? I got a burger and fries.  I was excited that they were serving a grass fed burger.   Very average, though.  I can think of at least a half dozen places in Cow Hollow or Marina that have a better burger, including multiple within a few blocks of the Brixton (e.g., Roam, Gamine).  In fact, there are probably more than a half dozen better ones; any place that has a burger has a tastier one.\n\n2.  the prices for said average food were somewhat expensive.  $19 for a burger and a standard beer.  Remember those places that have better burgers in the area? They are also cheaper or equivalent prices.\n\n3.  the restaurant is louder than any restaurant in San Francisco .  By far.  Some nearby restaurants/bars are loud -- think Mamacita or Tipsy Pig -- but not like this.\n\n4.  worst crowd i've ever seen in a restaurant.  As I've told people before, the Marina and Cow Hollow aren't the same thing.  Forgetting that for the moment, the crowd that gives most \"Marina\" bars their bad reputation is largely people from outside the Marina that come over for evening.  The Brixton had the largest accumulation of this type of people that I've ever seen.  Whether they live nearby or other parts of the city, the restaurant is a magnet for some of the most ridiculous individuals I've seen.  Think a combination of leisure suits, Eminem wannabes, etc.  On top of that, the management appears to care less about how people behave.  At a nearby table a dude was standing next to his own table gesticulating wildly in conversation with his table for 45 minutes.  Why wasn't this stopped? Well, in part because, unlike other restaurants, most people had no clue it was going on because it was so loud (see #3).  But even the wait staff that saw just seemed like it didn't care -- perhaps this is common there.\n\n\nIn the end, I've decided to review it.  If I'm not going to review my least favorite dining experience I've had yet in the Cow Hollow/Marina area, when would I review something?  Plus, the Brixton is already at 3 stars (thanks a number of other bad reviews), so I might as well participate in its eventual slide below 3 stars.", "author": "Brett J."}

She then said we would have to guess where the other piercings were. SUPER CLASSY! Aside from being, um, special, she messed up one of the guy's orders by forgetting it completely. By the time we got our food and realized something was missing, our waiter came back, so we had to tell him that she messed up and then she came back and apologized a million times because she didn't want to screw his tip up.

The staff was friendly and assertive and the food was fresh. The restaurant wasn't to busy on that Saturday, but it was still early. I then decided to go back on a Friday night. Not such a great ideaI was first annoyed at the fact that when I called to say we were running late to make our reservation, no one answered and got a message machine. I knew why when we got there and I could barely even hear the hostess, and she could barely hear me. I just kept on thinking that it would get better when we sat down. Not the case..\n\nMy friend and I were practically yelling at one another to understand what the other was saying. With putting that aside we decided on sharing some dishes. We decided on the tacos of the day, the pretzel knots, and then the Miso Ahi Salad. The pretzel knots weren't anything out of this world, and didn't go into too much effort into making them that special. The taco of the day was a pork shoulder taco. The tacos were actually really good, and had a lot of flavor. It was a perfect dish to share. As for the Ahi Salad. The salad was really good, but they decided to go a little too heavy on the dressing, which made our plates laden with dressing and our salad wily. I guess we learned our lesson, and should have asked for either light dressing, or dressing on the side. The salad would have been much more enjoyable if it wasn't for the dressing situation.\n\nAll in all the food is just alright, and with it being so loud it just made it so much harder for me to enjoy my meal.

Our waitress was adorable; making conversation, never rushing us and giving helpful advice on what to order and how much.  We felt well taken care of.  The menu is definitely comfort bar food with a twist but not enough that is takes time to decipher the menu.  I ordered the demon eggs and they were delicious.  Served at the perfect temperature with a nice flavor of crab and a sprinkling of bacon.  My friend had the mixed greens which was the right size for a starter.  There were a lot of other apps that looked yummy that we would have loved to try.  Again, not wanting to think we both ordered the burger- served on a pain de mie bun that was tasty and cooked perfectly, on the side was a nice mixture of sweet and regular  potato fries.  A lot of food and if we were not such piggies, we could have split the entree and our waitress said the kitchen is happy to do that.  But my leftover burger destined for my husband was heartily enjoyed by my puppy because she got there first.  \nThe wine list was great.  Happy to see a Turley Cinsault on the menu and very reasonably priced, which the waitress let me taste before committing to a bottle.  Overall, it was exactly what we were looking for on a weeknight after a tough day at work.  I will go back.", "author": "M B."}

Loved the 'demoned' eggs (with dungeness!), just delicious.  The flatbread pizza was fantastic too and the apple pie dessert was the clincher, loved the maple bourbon icecream on the side, gotta figure out how to buy a pint of that to take home,amazing!  The prices are extremely reasonable, and you can definitely get well fed for around $20, which in this neighborhood isn't easy to find.  And the atmosphere is perfect, cool vibe with good neighborhood people having fun. Definitely a little noisy, but isn't that part of the fun of going out?  \n\nSeems like most of the negative reviews have to do with the so called 'd-bags' in the neighborhood, too funny.  Guess you should hang out in the hipster haight? or take a bullet in the mission?

Piping hot mac & cheese, and a burger. The burger was cooked to perfection. And Anthony even hung out with us while we ate and we had a great conversation. Super nice dude.

Employees were running around everywhere but we couldn't get water or a server to stop by. I actually held up my empty water glass until a busser noticed. When we finally did get our server he told us how busy he was. There are so many things wrong with that! Be professional!\nOur food took forever and our server never checked on us after we got our salads, which we obviously sitting for a long time because they were warm and wilted. \nWe had to ask for the check and then our server disapppered again! I asked another server for change so we could get out of there and he told me it wasn't his table and I should ask my server!! \nThe manager passed us multiple times but never looked our way and looked like he wanted to fight someone. \nCome here for drinks when you want a science. Otherwise stay away. There are too many good places in the City to waste your time and money here.", "author": "KTO B."}

Stayed away opening weekend because I figured it would be insane...but ventured forth this past weekend and I was really impressed.  They have done a great job on this space - I love the wood and the posters - and having the horseshoe shaped bar in the middle was a great move.  Plenty of room to meet for a drink and conversation if you're not into full on dining.  We did eat though - and I have to say the food was really good.  I figure some of the early reviews are maybe opening weekend working out the kinks kinda thing cause the deviled eggs ROCKED and the tuna was AMAZING.  This is definitely a destination and the people here (staff as well as customers) have a great energy.  So glad we have this place to go to in the neighborhood...we'll be back soon!", "author": "Emma L."}

I was underwhelmed to say the least...\n\nPROS\n- While waiting at the bar for our table I had the Bourbon Rasperry Splash, it was delicious and the bartender great. Definitely the best part of our evening\n\nCONS\n- Freezing inside the restaurant\n-Ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an app. Waitress brought out the wrong thing then started going on about how unorganized the kitchen is. When we finally got the right appetizer it was runny cheese with no flavor, added salt which helped some. Served with crostini so thin it broke when you tried to scoop anything.\n- I had the gnocchi which was served on a hot plate, yet the entree was cold. The gnocchi was rubbery and undercooked, awful presentation also. I am a pasta lover and for the first time in my life didn't finish a pasta dish!\n- My boyfriend ordered the burger medium rare, It came well done. He also found a decent sized bone...in a burger! I'm a vegetarian and don't know much about meat, but never in my life has someone bitten into a burger at a nice restaurant and pulled out a bone. He left about half of it uneaten\n-Review of clam chowder from bf: stick with Campbells\n-Waitress was overly flirtatious with my boyfriend, which i did not appreciate on our romantic night out. \n\nI will definitely not be returning to The Brixton. If crappy food and overly pretentious people are your thing, by all means, be my guest", "author": "Corina T."}

We were all just reading eachother's lips the entire time at the table. It's stuffed full of marina idiots and the food is definitely nothing spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-04", "description": "This is my first review, which I felt compelled to write after my experience at Brixton.\n\nI'm all for the great space, decor and lively environment - especially on Union.  It could be fun for drinks, as others have mentioned, because it's the happening spot now so it's drawing a good crowd.  All that said, my experience was frustrating and strange.\n\nI made a reservation for dinner on OpenTable over a week in advance.  I was meeting a friend on a Thursday night and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call that morning/afternoon confirming my reservation.  When I arrived, I checked in, gave my name and received what I thought was an acknowledgment of my reservation and said I would stop in the restroom until my friend arrived.  When we went back to check-in, I was very abruptly told that there was no reservation in my name.  I repeated my name and spelled it - nope, I was told again that it didn't exist.  Then I explained that I did it on OpenTable, so maybe that's why they weren't seeing it.  Didn't matter - she insisted I didn't have a reservation.  Finally, I told her I received a call earlier to confirm my reservation and to that she answered that she had been working all afternoon and no one made a call to me.  I was totally perplexed, turned off and yet somewhat amused if this was an attempt to be some sort of Manhatten \"it\" bar.  At that point another girl stepped in and offered another table that was open, even though I \"didn't have a reservation.\"  Wow.\n\nOnce seated, I proceeded to scream to my friend the rest of the evening.  MAJOR problem with the acoustics in there.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best.  I had the pear salad and spries.  The drink was good - Pisco Mule.  We left a generous tip since we hadn't ordered entrees, which was more than kind considering how we were treated.\n\nSo, if you're someone who likes to check out the new spots, like I do, then go for it - at the bar.  And be prepared to go hoarse trying to socialize.\n\nToo bad.  Hopefully they're taking these review to heart to make improvements so they stick around.  Like I said, they've got a great location and decor going for them.", "author": "Anonymous P."}

My fiance and I were among the fortunate ones, as our service was prompt and the food was delivered on time, at a good temperature, and tasted good.\nWe were seated right away, in the back, on a rainy Saturday afternoon around 2PM.  I will agree with the other reviews, the place is a bit noisy.  There were a few large groups dining around us, who seemed to be in competition with each other--trying to drown out each other with their high level obnoxious voices.  But once they left, everything turned pretty enjoyable.  We could even hear the music being played.\nA major highlight was when I asked for change for the meter.  With no change on hand within the restaurant, our waitress, Nicole, dipped into her purse and provided us $2 in change.  Wow!  To me, that definitely went above and beyond what I would expect.  Thank You very much.\nPerhaps our perspective on the restaurant was different than most on here.  As mentioned, we showed up at 2PM, and that was on purpose.  Both my fiance and I are not big fans of the crowd that frequents this establishment at night, so we felt 2PM would be a great time to avoid that particular crowd and experience this restaurant.  Luckily we were right.\nOverall I would say we would return, most likely around the same time for the same reasons.", "author": "K W."}

The service was awful. After seating us, the waitress didn't come back until she saw us standing up to leave (we decided we didn't really want to get drinks or food from them after sitting, with our menus closed, for around 20 minutes). During the time we were sitting there, we saw the waitress go around to other tables and check on them. We actually saw her go to one table, take drink orders from a bunch of people, then go to the bar, put in the drink orders, stand there for five minutes while the bartender was making the drinks, and then serve the drinks. We tried waving and making eye contact, but she never looked in our direction a single time.", "author": "Steve C."}

I met the bff for a quick dinner and she wanted to come here.  I love the atmosphere - what a change from the crappy Mexican place that it used to be!!  The inside was beautiful and swanky - and it was definitely a place to go even on a Wednesday night.  We started with the pretzel knots - amazing.  This is totally my style.  Julia ordered the onion soup and caesar salad - I decided to get the tacos of the day.  The tacos were good but Julia's salad was to die for.  The chicken on it was moist and delicious and the salad was unbelievably fresh.  As soon as I took a bite, I knew that I would have to come back to have one all to myself.  To top off the food, our waitress was on it and did a great job.  We were seated quickly, well taken care of and the food was good.  Who wants to go back with me?", "author": "Arica V."}

We were a few minutes late for our reservation but were seated right away. Yes it gets very loud, it's a bar, what else would you expect, so no loss of points for that. If you want a quiet, romantic meal just don't come here. Crowd was young and lively and mostly young professionals. I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool and something different for San Francisco. As for the food and service, good but not phenomenal. I definitely recommend getting some things to share. And also maybe stick to bar food type things. We got the spinach artichoke dip and cod tacos for apps. Major stars for the spinach artichoke dip, awesome and delish!! Cod tacos were OK, wouldn't order them again. Entrees we shared the chicken was was very solid and the pork spare ribs, also good. We didn't try any of the cocktails at this place as we settled for beer and wine but they looked really creative, solid. Prices were fairly reasonable. The service was average, waitress was very attentive but first round of drinks didn't come untll after our apps, despite being ordered a good 10 minutes before.....Overall a good place to go for some bar food, drinks, and mingling but if you want a knock-out meal probably not the place for you.

Their desserts were fab too! It screams Marina in the sense of the crowd, but beyond that it's really unique and a welcomed different approach to other typical Union Street antics. It adds a little class at an affordable price for the less in-the-know people. You know who I am talking about. I loved the service and the drinks were all poured well. Everything was reasonably priced and we ended up sitting at one of their outside tables for at least four hours! Haha day drinking at it's finest. Only in SF. It was a gorgeous Saturday day. You know how that goes. The three of us left paying a bill of $160, and I didn't feel bad about it one bit. I thought it was well worth the money. It's all the way across town for me, but I'll certainly make another trip over soon. I'm excited to try their new brunch menu.

Since The Brixton was new, we decided to give it a try....4 hours later we stumbled out. The owners have really turned the place into something beautiful. It is a huge space and they haven't jammed it full of tables, so it feels very open and there is a lot of room around the bar. Their cocktail menu has some interesting drinks and they make their margaritas right - no syrupy sweet and sour. I was sad we had just eaten, because their menu looks great - the pulled pork sandwich being devoured next to me smelled delicious. Next time I'm coming to eat (I want that gingerbread dessert), but definitely 5 stars for a great place to drink.", "author": "Kerry C."}

I booked a table on opentable.com and under \"Special Requests for the Maitre D\"  I typed a note that my friend wanted to bring her puppies so we would prefer to be sat outside.  I was unable to reach them on the phone to confirm this so in my notes I also wrote that if this was going to be a problem for a party of 5 to call me and I would have my friend leave her dogs at home.  No one called me so we assumed it was OK.  We arrived promptly at 11 for our reservation and the restaurant was nearly empty all except two tables who had just been sat outside.  Not leaving a table for my friends and I.  The host first looked up my notes, clearly for the first time, and said that I had requested inside because it was cold out.  I then showed her that she was looking at the wrong name.  She then read my notes and realized they had goofed and suggested that perhaps we could leave the puppies in the car.  Um, no.  She also offered to seat our party 1/2 outside and 1/2 in.  I then asked if we could add a small table to the other small one outside as there appeared to be room.  I thought this must be against the rules as she hadn't suggested it herself but as it turned out she said of course that should work and got a busser to help move the tables.  The fact that she hadn't offered that already was sort of lame to me.  I mean, if they had been busy or something, I'd get it - but it was empty!  So once we were sat we waited a few minutes and when our server came to take our drink order she realized we didn't have menus.  The host came over and apologized for not giving us menus the first time.  The host was nice but seriously needs more training or something as I didn't find her very helpful at all.\nOur server was good but she got slammed as suddenly the whole restaurant filled up at once.  My friends got their coffees that they ordered at 11:15 but I didn't get my mimosa until 11:50!!  Our server had apologized for the extreme wait and I have no doubt it was some sort of slammed bar error but still - that's crazy.  Overall I think I was just un-impressed with the way the service is run.  (Not with our server, with the system they seem to have or rather not have in place) \n\nThe breakdown: \n\nThe food was great.   Loved the Brixton Benedict and the Apple Buckwheat Pancakes\n\nThe experience was where they lost 2 stars:\nWe had reservations at 11, they didn't bother to read our open table notes, the host didn't offer a good solution and didn't give us menus, we ordered around 11:20 and didn't get our food until 12.. My drink alone took over 30 minutes, and my friends coffee cups were empty for way too long.. \n\nI'll try it again because like I said the food was great and I liked our server.  But overall this new spot has some work to do before it can offer a truly pleasurable dining experience.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

While the decor is classy and chic and the owners and service super friendly, the food...well, it just isn't good.  The blue cheese eggs benedict (I always order if an option on any menu) came out small, cold, and so hard on the bottom that I couldn't cut it.  The side of *fruit* was plopped in a cafeteria-looking cup and mediocre as well.  For $14 a benny, I expected more.  My friends' plates looked like something out of a 2am diner .  Don't get me wrong.  I love 2am breakfasts and I love diners.  But there's a time and a place and the impetus is usually a late-night out and a tight budget.  Our meal at The Brixton wasn't under those circumstances, but it sure seemed like it.

Also because last week was the first soft opening, people came into to drink and mingle not sit and eat a four course meal. This place is  such a turn around and improvement from the old restaurant it was before, what was it called again? It is a bar and restaurant.. take it for what it is, you can't go there expecting it to be fine dining because its clearly not and they don't make themselves to be that.
