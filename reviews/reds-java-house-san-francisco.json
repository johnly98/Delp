This place was pretty bad.\n\nThe $9 burger was a slab of meat on a hard french role. It was covered in pickles, and some type of dry sauce, and that's about it.  It was so bad.  It tasted dry and yucky!\n\nMy wife had fish and chips. The fries were quite good, but nothing special. The fish was edible and she did eat most of it.\n\nThe onion rings, about $6 were, clearly frozen.  They were not homemade, and certainly not worth $6.00.  \n\nThe tarter sauce had a dead mosquito, on the outside of the container, but didn't think of eating it.   \n\nThank God I didn't buy any overpriced drinks, hard or soft.

This is pretty near the parking at the AT & T Center where the SF Giants are playing. I stopped by at this dive where Anthony Bourdain stopped by many years ago. 3 guys who are the host, cook and the guy at the bar are gracious, hospitable.\nSo I ordered the chili cheeseburger and a can of coke. The service was pretty fast - I didn't expect to be less than 1 minute. I guess they knew customers were coming in before the game starts. So the chili cheeseburger is with a grilled toasted Wedenbecker's sourdough bun, hamburger and their signature red coffee chili with beans which had a tangy zing to it. It is kind of tasty and you want to eat more of it. It is served on a paper bowl which is pretty hard to eat it and chili is sloppy wet. No doubt the Wedenbecker's sourdough baguette is off the charts and really good. But the chili was very underwhelming and burger was so underwhelming. I am not impressed by it and was rather disappointed. \nThe crew here are working hard and serving a lot of their regular customers who watch baseball, and there are photographs from famous politicians, musicians who came from SF. This dive is pretty nostalgic in SF. This is probably a \"humble shack\" to enjoy food, drink and getting together for baseball fans and locals here. I would say the drinks and wine here are pretty cheap compared in the stadium.\nI like the ambiance at this dive. Pretty cool in SF and a part of history in SF.", "author": "Jade M."}

I'd never heard of Red's before and was surprised when I saw it. This is a humble-looking \"shack\" on some primo real estate in San Francisco. You can find it on Pier 30 on The Embarcadero. Red's back patio faces the Bay and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. It occupies a tiny corner of what looks like a giant, stadium-sized parking lot. I later learned that this is (or was) one of the potential sites for the Golden State Warriors' new arena. Jeez.\n\nRed's was originally known as Franco's Lunch in 1930. It was renamed Red's in 1955 and has been through multiple owners. How this small business has managed to stay open all these years - through a massive fire, earthquake, and, most of all, new city development - is beyond me. I think it's great they've managed to make it this long. Unfortunately, I can only see new construction, and the dollars associated with it, wiping this charming little place away. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nThe restaurant serves mostly unhealthy American breakfast and lunch foods like bacon, pancakes, burgers, hot dogs, and fries. They also have daily specials like corned beef sandwiches and fish and chips. For San Francisco, the prices are affordable with many plates under $10 each. My buddy likes their burgers (about $6-7) and their fish and chips (about $12) though he prefers onion rings with the fish instead of fries. Red's serves beer too. This is just a simple, very casual, comfort food/junk food, hangout type of joint.\n\nThe place is divey. The freestanding structure is old. The interior has creaky floors and is decorated with historic photographs and miscellaneous memorabilia. You can order food at the counter up front and alcohol from the bar in the back. The back of the building opens up to a chain-link-fence-enclosed uncovered patio. Most of the patio has a not-so-scenic view of the aforementioned parking lot. However, part of the patio has a view of the pier next door, Pier 28 (also not-so-scenic), parts of the Bay Bridge that peek over Pier 28, and a small part of the Bay itself. It's not a great view, but it is *a* view. The patio is lit with string lights at night and the tables have umbrellas. The covered portion in the back, where the bar is, has a TV used primarily for sports like Giants games.\n\nOverall, I think Red's is A-OK. It's a chill little place that's good for meeting up with people. Despite the size, they can handle large groups and are also available for private events.", "author": "Daniel B."}

We went here before the Giants game and it was relatively quiet, but I imagine it gets busier closer to game time. The cheeseburger on sourdough baguette is a must. Seriously. Don't even think about eating before you come here. It's a perfectly portioned single burger with cheese on a chewy, soury baguette. Onion rings are A+ too (and one order is enough to share between two people). I miss this meal already. And if it was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, you sure as hell know it's good enough for you.\n\n(The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because there were flies in the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-04", "description": "Accidentally ate here because my co-worker called Red's Java House instead of Java House for a pick up order. So we walked a bit further to Red's Java House and upon entering, we had to dodge flies like Kung Fu masters. (Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid should be hired there so that he can catch all the flies with his chopsticks.) Anyhow, we told the staff we were there to pick up our call in order. He said yeah yeah ok. Still nothing. So my coworker asked again and then he said they threw away our bacon cheeseburgers because we took too long. He said that they were going to make new burgers for us right now. I was excited thinking wow it must be great here, I've never eaten here but always see it and it's by the bridge and Anthony Bourdain ate here....we received our burgers and left the restaurant excited to see if maybe Red's Java House had better burgers than Java House, the location closer to our work that we meant to order from originally. We unwrapped our burgers to take a bite and... my coworker looked really depressed. I tried to make the best of it and enjoy the bacon and excess of pickles. The bread was hard, the meat very dry and there was only onions and pickles inside. She asked how can you be eating that? I said I'm trying to make the best of it and just eat the bacon and pickles....really a McDonald's cheeseburger is better than this which is sad to say. I tried to keep a positive attitude, but on the way walking back to work, we passed Java House. Not Red's Java House, just Java House, the one closer to ATT Park. My coworker was really depressed about the crappy burger that she paid for as a treat because usually she doesn't spend money eating out and today was happy cheeseburger day. She said she was gonna ask Java House for some lettuce and tomatoes and a real bun at least and that we would pay them. She explained our situation to the cooks there and they were accommodating even though they didn't have to. We explained that we meant to order from them and showed them the sad burgers that Red's Java House made. It was like looking at shriveled up dry mummified road kill. So they agreed to fix the burgers and give us lettuce, tomato, and bread you can actually bite into without breaking your teeth. Long story short, thankful that another restaurant tried to fix the sad burgers for us. Bottom line super dry and doesn't even feel like a real burger. Not sure why Red's Java House said they threw our pre-order burgers away, maybe the flies flew away with them or they were never made in the first place. I would rather bring a George Foreman Grill to work and make my own burger before EVER ordering from here again. Be careful when ordering over the phone, there is a Red's Java House and a Java House. Pick the one with the blue paint without the flies. Or if you want, I'll have my George Foreman Grill ready and will make juicy fresh hamburgers for you rather than some hard dried up meat that even your stomach knows isn't a real burger! Or eat here because it's closer to your work. I'm not here to control your life. I'm just saying.... big mistake to order from the wrong spot and to think it was a happy accident...felt punished by karma.

The restaurant is located along Embarcadero (in the shadow of the Bay Bridge) and just a short walk from AT&T Park. \n\nThis is a GREAT place to visit for breakfast and lunch. The food (burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, sides, etc.) is good in a \"the way diners used to be\" sort of way. It is simple and tasty. \n\nWhile the food is good, the views and ambiance is the real draw of this place. The views of the city, bay, Bay Bridge and AT&T Park are postcard worthy. You really \"feel\" the real Embarcadero here almost more than any other place. It is just slightly off the beaten (tourist) path elsewhere to make this place ooze with character and nostalgia. The food is really just a delightful plus! \n\nI'm happy that this place maintains the \"feel\" despite the fame that various TV shows and travel magazines have brought it. Fame hasn't changed the place at all. \n\nTIPS: Since you can bring food into AT&T Park for baseball games, this is a great place to great some food if you're not interested in the stadium's culinary offerings. \n\nParking is always at a premium in San Francisco, but there are usually some meter spots available along the Embarcadero (and I usually park in front of Pier 26 to Pier 28). \n\nRed's is also just a 15 minute walk from the CalTrain station at 4th and King.

I have no idea how long our food just sat at the counter before I finally went up and was able to get someone's attention to retrieve it for us.

Ultimately, your experience may be different than mine based upon your personal tastes.  YMMV.\n\nWith the reasonable proximity to my work, I decided to venture out to Pier 30 to try out this place for lunch.  When I arrived, there was a long line and many people were sitting outside by the water.  This gave me a good impression and things looked promising.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Basic, yet decent menu: they have hot dogs, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, french fries, garlic fries, fish and chips, breakfast, etc.  They also have a number of beverages, including craft beer, available.\n+ Great views of the water and the Bay Bridge\n+ Decent amount of indoor and outdoor seating\n\nCons:\n\n- Abundance of flies and even a few pigeons inside: somehow they managed to pass a health inspection with a score of 92 (per a sign on the wall), but this is still an issue that needs to be addressed.\n- My cheeseburger came out in pretty much one minute after I finished placing my order.  When I got back to my office and sat down to eat it, there was no flavor whatsoever.  The mustard, cheese, onions and sourdough bun did not do justice either.  I wasn't expecting some serious gourmet $#!%, but for $6.44 I don't think it's too much to ask that my burger has some flavor to it.\n- To further elucidate the above point, it appears that not everything is cooked to order here.  It seems as if they have a number of items already cooked up that they leave sitting on the grill to keep adequately warm.  Makes sense that my order was ready so quickly. \n- For some reason, they don't offer tomatoes or lettuce as topping options for their burgers.  Weird.\n\nMy experience was not terrible, but a lot was left to be desired.  I'm a big fan and admirer of Anthony Bourdain and I've heard that he swears that this place gets the job done.

But then I took my first bite:\n\nDouble Cheeseburger:  it's about a five inch double patty burger in sourdough bread with onions and pickles.  The burger comes out instantly since the turnover of burgers is non stop.  There's no asking for a medium rare burger here, they come out well done.  But after my first couple bites I realized something was missing.  The burger was lacking a certain flavor and texture.  That's when I realized that this burger had no lettuce or tomato.  I didn't understand till those components were gone how important they are.  Don't get me wrong, the patties/cheese were tasty, the sourdough bread was awesome.  I would say 3.5 stars but just those two items would have bumped it up to a 4 star experience easily.\n\nThe fries were whatever as well.  The service was fast food-ish.  Order, sit, eat, throw wrappers in trash can and keep it moving.  However the location is a million dollar view right below the Bay Bridge on Embarcadero.  A real iconic location for this burger joint.\n\nNever again will I under estimate the value of vegetables like lettuce and tomato.  Because you don't what you got till it's gone....

The cheese is a bright orange color. Combining these features doesn't make sense. But after eating this burger you understand why. Not only is the burger is delicious and light, but also this is a no nonsense burger in a no nonsense burger joint without the frills of some of these new eateries.

Patio umbrellas provided some shade but it was a warm day.  I entertained my self watching the seagulls and pigeons fight over food scraps and waited for my food to arrive.  \n\nFinally, with out any fanfare the unassuming burger was laid before me.  Not much to look at.  Condiments? Toppings??? Not much to speak of.  Mystery solved... Chopped onion, pickles and mustard.  Two large patties, shoved unceremoniously into a sourdough hoagie roll.  Experience??? Unforgettable!  Pure. Unpretentious.  Protein packed, delight!   Everything a man needs in a burger!!! I have found a place in California, where you will be slapped if you request guacamole on your burger. This is a haven for those, like me who can appreciate the simplicity of a few select items prepared from age old traditions of meat and fire!!! \n\nI was sure they must prepare the meat themselves.  I inquired of the cooks, if this was the case because the meat tasted so fresh.  In actuality they buy the patties off premise but fresh...not frozen and that is why they taste so good.\n\nBonuses: fries...extra crispy. Crowds... None.\n\nPrice... $13.... A little high but this is San Fran!  \n\nTry the fish and chips!!! I'll tell you about those later!", "author": "Lloyd H."}

This was one of those times that I feel like he knew better than me.  My first impression was that this place looked like a shack and I saw no lines out the door. I will have to admit that given the recent glut of burger bars, I was a bit dismayed at the lack of offerings. What do you mean, you guys have no truffle sauce or aioli mayo that I can put on my burger?\n\nBut this is where the ultimate joy of burger comes through.  I have to admit that I found a zen like experience in eating a burger with no special sauce or gimmick - just meat, cheese, pickles, onions on a sourdough bun.  Unpretentious and simple - what a burger used to be before the Foodie craze turned it into an overly flamboyant monstrosity.  Not that I don't like that at times. \n\nPaired with a beer, I felt the worries of the world melt away and imagined myself back in a time where men could freely watch tv while sticking one hand down the pants.

Thank you for that, Red's Java House! \n\nThis place is divey, and I don't mean that as an epithet. I say that with something akin to awe. Nowhere else in the Embarcadero Waterfront have I been to that is like Red's Java House. The menu is simple: burgers, fish-and-chips, tuna salad sandwich, and none of the fancy gourmet dishes San Francisco is known for (they do have veggie burgers, though, so yeah, they still give nod to SF's health nut side). \n\nMy lunch companion and I ordered fish-and-chips and decided to just share since neither of us were truly hungry yet. Did we get disapproving looks or raised eyebrows? Nope, the staff were as cool and pleasant as could be. The fish-and-chips was $9 and it was more than plenty for us (we didn't even finish the chips!). It may not be the best fish-and-chips I have had in San Francisco, but it was quite good.\n\nSince it was a glorious San Francisco day, we chose to situate ourselves in their outdoor seating area. The spectacular view of the Bay Bridge whilst watching the birds very closely to make sure they don't snatch our food kept the smiles on our faces. On the other side is a parking lot with nothing of interest to note of. There were business people in their spiffy attire, tourists with their huge cameras, hipsters with their fabulous tattoos, a family with a toddler, and goths with their dark clothing dining there as well. \n\nAt that very moment, I couldn't help but think: How very San Francisco!

It's been awhile since I had been, but I went yesterday with some friends. We had just missed the window for breakfast which was disappointing because  there was no one else in there and it would have been good customer service to accommodate our group of seven. In any case, we had to order lunch from a menu that only offered a hamburger, a hotdog or fish and chips. Talk about limited! I went with the fish and chips, my son ordered a hamburger and my daughter ordered a hotdog. The fish and chips were recommended, but unfortunately there was more bread than fish and there was very little flavor. Even the tartar sauce didn't have much flavor. My son's burger looked like a frozen patty and the ratio of bread to burger was 2:1. Being a nine year old boy he can normally eat a burger, no problem, but he disliked it so much, he didn't even finish it. I took a bite myself and the burger was tasteless. Lastly, my daughter orders a hotdog, which she liked and was ironically the best item on the menu, but for $5, it was a total rip off! I would have left immediately after realizing that breakfast was over, but we were with friends and we were trying to make the best of the situation. I honestly think everyone was disappointed with their meal, but I am only speaking for my self when I say that I won't ever be back! I called and spoke with the manager and although I told him this was the worse meal I've ever had in San Francisco all he had was excuses and didn't offer any kind of reimbursement in return.

It just looked like a cool place and it most definitely is.\n\nNo frills to this menu.  In fact it's pretty take it or leave it.  They have a sign that says NO LETTUCE AND TOMATO on our burgers.   Now I love my veggies on my burger, but I respect a place that has a my way or the highway mentality.  The only thing you'll be offered is pickles, onions, and mustard.  So I went with a double cheeseburger, which comes on their Sourdough bread roll.  You need the double to fill that sucker up as it's one solid piece of bread.  The burgers are on the thin side, so most definitely get the double.  Cheese content was very impressive.  Not sure how many slices of cheddar cheese were used, but it not only covered the burgers well but also any exposed parts of the bread.  Let's not fool ourselves the star of this sandwich is the bread.  The burgers?  Meh, just ok, not overly seasoned, or anything very remarkable about them.  But the bread is some great sourdough, and you throw any kind of hot meat patty and lots of melted cheese on it, it's going to be good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-java-house-san-francisco?select=Mn5Y7zMYZ7oKXkKLgpQ3yQ#VDtQn-MQXYAfpJa32pQujQ\n\nI also liked their fries in a McDonald's kind of way.  I'm stealing from another reviewer here that compared them to Macky D's, but sure enough that's what they look and taste like, except better - like the way McDonald's fries tasted 20 years ago.  \n\nI grabbed a hot dog as well.  It's topped the same way as their burgers, but this one was missing their great bread and was on a sesame seed bun.  It was nothing special and the dog got lost in all the cheese.  I'd skip this, and make sure anything you order comes on the sourdough bread.

There is a really large outdoor area which is great for big groups and you have the option of being in the shade or being in the beaming sunlight.\n\nThey have pretty standard beers on tap, Lagunitas IPA, Anchor Steam, Shock Top, etc - nothing fancy and their cocktails are ok.\n\nHonestly I only go because my co-workers like to check it out every now and then after work.

Just your basic greasy burger on a sourdough roll that provides the SF touch.  Burger was standard, nothing home to write about.  Inside it had cheese, mustard and pickles.  The sourdough roll portion was unique about this burger if anything.  The fries were nice and crispy.  You want mayo?  They have packets along with relish on their shelf of condiments if needed.  Great location right on the bay with the bridge lookin right at you.

There was no price on the sign out front but quickly found out a dbl cheese is $4.79 and $5.00 for an Anchor Steam.  \n\nThe burger is served on tasty SF sourdough and the burgers are probably the frozen variety with pickles, onions and mustard.  There is clearly a sign by the register that says no Lettuce or Tomatoes.  The problem with the burger is that bread is too big and chewy so when you bite on one side, the meat slips to the other and next thing you have a big mess and the thing is falling apart.  You will definitely need lots of napkins.  \n\nI would say the food and beer is average for a restaurant and we all need to help keep these historic places in business.  The view is fabulous and was a mix of tourist on bikes, a few locals in the bar area watching the 49ers.  The bar looks good and it's close to my house.

It's located on Pier 30, which almost right under a huge overpass bridge, and the \"pier\" itself is more of a parking lot, rather than an actual \"let's walk out and be close to the ocean\" pier; the view from both inside and outside seating areas of the restaurant is obstructed by either a building or other man-made structures so it's really hard to sit down and have a \"fisherman's wharf\" kinda experience here.\n\nSecond, although I like the no-nonsense menu and the prices, the food was really bland and uninspiring. I got the chili cheeseburger because both my friend and the guy working at the counter recommended it; the burger came in a sourdough bun with a small cheese-melted patty and lots of chili on top. Not to mention that it didn't help that I was lost as to how to get the soggy greasy solid concoction into my stomach, the only silverware they provide here are cheap plastic knives and forks which proved quite ineffective when it came to cutting through two layers of sourdough. When I finally did manage to cut through the sourdough with my plastic utensils, I accidentally cut through the cheap paper hotdog/fries container they served my burger on. Poo on me.\n\nI also don't know if I came on a bad day or not, but this place served me THE blandest chili I've ever tasted in my life. I seriously kid you not, the chili had less flavor than the vegan chili that comes in those green cans that you can buy from costco. So given the nature of chili to overpower any flavor it comes in contact with, my chili cheeseburger just tasted like one big bland chili with small chunks of meat and bread--if there was an accurate numeric system to rate how tastes blend together to create food orgy inside one's mouth ranging from a scale from 1-10, the burger gets a solid -99999999 from me.\n\nThe only thing that made my eating experience here remotely enjoyable was the fact that they had diet coke and the fact that I came here with good company; if I had come here alone after following the \"hype\" this place apparently gets, I most definitely would have given this place my first one star review.", "author": "Scott S."}

They've been slinging burgers to weary longshoremen since before Calvin Coolidge became the 30th President of the United States of America, and they've been fryin' up fish sticks to the masses along the Embarcadero since before Roy and Walt Disney formed The Walt Disney Company. With that being said, there are a few generations of families that don't know San Francisco without Red's, and for that, I have to tip my hat.\n\nBeing on Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' could prove to be one of the worst things that's ever happened to this place. OR, it could be the best. I suppose only time will tell. But what I've noticed since Tony profiled the joint is an increase in patrons and an overrated idea of what's to be expected. It's essentially a fast food joint on the water, and I can't help but believe people are expecting to sink their teeth into the greatest burger in history. That's the double-edged sword in this kind of publicity, as it was a  tad misrepresented, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThis place is an anomaly. If you scan the horizon around the water's edge, you'll notice high rises, yuppies jogging with their iPods, AT&T park, expensive looking condos, the Bay Bridge... and Red's. It sticks out like a sore thumb, it's beat up and sagging like an abandoned spider web... but that's the appeal more so than the food. It's the sole survivor in a sea of gentrification, and it's nice to support such an operation that's been grinding away or nearly 80 years without so much as a face lift along the way.\n\nIf you're a Giants fan, you'll have to wait until 2010, but this is one of the best pre-game spots in the area. PBRs are $1.75 and their other beer specials are smokin' as well. Head in an hour before the game, grab a bucket of Milwaukee's finest on the back patio, and get a serious buzz going for the same scratch you'd drop on one Bud Light inside AT&T Park.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

One bite would have a huge chunk of onion and another bite would have nothing.  It's just all over the place and the bread is too thick.  They use a sourdough roll instead and I appreciate the creativity but the patty gets lost.  It's also not flavored well so I used a lot of ketchup and Tapatio.  \n\nThe chili cheese fries came out while we were still paying.

I've driven by you a thousand times, seen you on Anthony Bourdain's show, and LOVE greasy-spoon/hole in the wall restaurants. Where did we go wrong? I overlooked when the guy taking orders was a little bit of a smart-a$$ to my gf (she wanted a meatball sandwich, and he said \"come back on Wednesday when it's actually our special\" quite rudely (a simple \"we don't have that today, sorry\" would of sufficed). I overlooked the pigeons walking around INSIDE the restaurant (and around the food service area), I even wanted to overlook the mediocre portions (my friends breakfast plate only had ONE pancake). At a certain point I decided to stop convincing myself this place was everything I wanted it to be and looked at the facts:\n\n*Paper plates and plastic silverware (I understand to-go, but for dine in as well? breakfast foods definitely suffer from being presented this way)\n*No tomatoes or lettuce offered for burgers (I thought this was America)\n*Small portions (pretty much all me and my friends were still hungry afterwards)\n*Pigeons, outside is cool, but inside the restaurant too? one flew over our table and almost hit my friend waiting in line for the bathroom.\n\nAnd lastly my biggest disappointment: the food.  When it comes down to it and you think about the money you shelled out, while definitely not expensive, the food does not stand up to expectations. I love divey places (see my review of Butter) but the bottom line is that the food did just not cut it here. I came with 7 hungover friends and all we wanted was some solid greasy breakfast (hard to mess up right?). I ordered the \"2 eggs and chili\" expecting something huevos rancheros-esque, when in reality it is exactly what the description says \"two eggs and chili\", basically a cooked tortilla (not fried or done up in any tasty way) with a bunch of chili (I suspect from a can) with two eggs and a dab of salsa on top. I asked for my eggs \"slightly runny\" what they gave me was barely cooked (I could still see a lot of clear fluid from the egg not being cooked thoroughly). My girlfriend got the chili burger with similar \"not slightly impressed\" reaction to it. Along with my friends small and unsatisfying breakfast plates, I don't think I could ever recommend this place as someplace to go for breakfast.\n\nFor the price, you are better off going to Delancey Street Restaurant a block down (or even a Denny's for that matter) OR stay at home and cook yourself (we didn't taste anything that we couldn't of made at home when we were half asleep). Sure, the place has great character, and I can see possibly coming here for mediocre fish and chips and a beer after a game, but aside from that I dont think I can see myself coming back any time soon.", "author": "Mathew C."}

Famous last words.\n\nWell for some odd reason the people at Red's are opposed to the idea of lettuce and tomato on a burger, and they make it a point to have a sign saying that they don't have it. Are you kidding me? I thought we were in America? That's like ordering spaghetti and meatballs without the sauce or cheese. It just doesn't make sense to me. Is this place just so cheap that they can't afford fresh Lettuce and Tomatoes or do they REALLY not want me to have it? Well, I didn't notice the sign until after I ordered, and was greeted with a snickering \"we don't have lettuce and tomato\" as if I was some sort of moron for requesting such commonplace items.\n\nSo I order the burger regardless, and only have the options of mustard, onions and pickles to put on my burger. Mustard is not for me and I like my pickles to the side, so I opt for just onions. I get a side of fries and a water and sit down.\n\nThe fries came up immediately, and were decent. They were a little greasy like McDonalds, but I can't complain. Easily the best part of my meal.\n\nSoon after that was the \"burger\", or lack there of. The first thing I noticed was that the burger was not on a bun, but on some sort of roll that you may get a sub or something on. It was so thick and doughy, it just DID NOT go with a burger. You need to have that light airiness, it's really essential to a good burger. It's all about the Brioche bun. \n\nThe actual meat patty was downright awful. I come from a place where the burgers are thick, juicy, and cooked to my liking. I want that burger moo-ing at me, and this just wasn't doing it. Cooked Medium-well, this burger was just devoid of any juice or flavor at all, and was about the thickness of a McDonalds beef patty. The \"bun\" itself was double the thickness of the burger, and for lack of a better term it was like \"throwing a hot dog down a hallway\".\n\nI wasn't expecting a gourmet medium rare burger, but I was expecting something that looked more appetizing than the Big Mac my dog wouldn't eat of the garbage.\n\nOverall, I was just completely unsatisfied and I will NOT be coming back here, for anything, ever. My co-worker had the fish and chips, and though it tasted fine and was nice and crunchy, I don't want to take the risk and let this place steal anymore of my money. Good riddance Reds.\n\nThanks for letting me down Bourdain. Get it right next time.", "author": "Bradley D."}

We walked along Embarcadero for what seemed like forever until we reached this famous quaint shack on the water. According to a message on the menu, breakfast ends at 11; while the long line crept forward, my heart pounded like a flimsy pancake.\n\n\"I do NOT want to eat a cheeseburger,\" I informed my boyfriend, as a greasy meal would not sit well with me. At 11:03, we reached the counter.\n\n\"You still serving breakfast?\" he inquired, knowing the answer would set the mood for the morning.\n\n\"Maybe,\" the staff member smiled.\n\n\"Good, that'll make her day,\" my beau sighed with relief, glancing toward me. We later learned Red's serves breakfast until 2 on the weekends. We both opted for the Pancake, Bacon and Egg Plate, a huge and cheap helping. A convoluted pile of sweet, crisp bacon made a mound at one edge of the plate, a mountain of scrambled eggs balancing it out on the other. The pizza-sized pancake came with plastic containers of butter and syrup, oozing into the eggs and bacon. \n\nThe food was nothing special, although the pigeons would've been glad for a bite. A sign in the bar even warns patrons of the birds' aggression. \n\nAs lunchtime approached, Giants fans flooded the back patio that overlooks the water. Clearly, the game day patronage and indoor decorations make up for what the food lacks. Historic city collages appear beneath the plastic table tops; red stools line those indoor  tables. A Giants baseball bat hangs over the entryway leading from the eating area to a photography-lined hall to the bar. \n\nMy simple breakfast and people-watching at Red's got me pumped for an afternoon at AT&T Park.", "author": "Bobbin W."}

The interior walls are decorated with old pictures, photos and posters from days long gone.  No frills with a counter of hot pots of coffee and hot water near the entrance and small tables/counters for the diners. In the rear deck are some tables and chairs for those who want to dine outdoors,  watch the boats,  listen to the spashing bay water and enjoy sunny days.  It's so rustic, you'd expect the fishermen to stomp in any second with their boots plastered in fish scales. \n\nSundays and Saturdays, the special is the corned beef hash with REAL chunks of fatty beef and potatoes, served with 2 eggs (any style) and 2 whole slices of bread (choice of excellent wheat,  very sour sourdough, white or rye) for $8.  Certainly, the corned beef hash was delicious but you could see the huge amount of oil at the bottom of the plate, hard to discern if the meat was that fat or they used too much oil to cook it.  Hubby's breakfast plate of 2 patties of sausage, 2 eggs, potatoes and bread was over $7.", "author": "Ry T."}

They said, if they make burger so well, this place would be so crowded that we would not be able to eat here.

They constantly have burgers cooking on their grill, so there is never a long wait. I would have loved to sit out back in the outdoor patio area, but there aren't a lot of tables, and each one was taken. So we had to sit inside. No biggie, though. There is plenty of San Francisco history and memorabilia on the walls to keep you entertained.\n\nAs for the food? I ordered a single cheeseburger with a side of onion rings, and the burger meat was fresh and perfectly cooked. A couple of my friends ordered the double cheeseburger, and it was a lot of meat.\n\nI took away one star because of the french role they use for buns. I would have preferred an actual hamburger bun. The french role was too tough for my liking and began hurting my teeth about half way through.\n\nThe onion rings weren't very good.

The great debate, my friends, is whether it deserves it. So let me tell you my story...\n\nI came here with some friends this past weekend to finally experience Red's. First thing I noticed? FREE PARKING LOT. That's worth like nine stars by itself in the city. We walk in and the guy at the counter starts making small talk. We mention that it's our friend's birthday today and he says that she deserves something: a free beer! Not too shabby. We order our food and I notice a \"question of the week\" written on a blackboard asking what movie this line is from: \"If it bleeds, we can kill it.\" Obviously, it's from the classic movie Predator featuring the Governator. I tell the guy my answer which earns me free french fries! High fives all around!\n\nNow comes the big test: the food. We ordered burgers, onion rings, and chili cheese fries. Annnnnd... it's kind of a letdown. The burgers come on sourdough bread which is cool, but they're pretty ordinary otherwise. They come with only mustard, onions, and pickles so there's not a ton of flavor and the meat isn't anything to write home about. The chili cheese fries weren't bad, but I've definitely had better. It also probably didn't help that it was about 55 degrees that day and the cold air coming in made the cheese a solid mass. Also, I'm not totally sure, but it seemed like the onion rings were lacking... onion. It tasted like it was just fried batter in the shape of a ring. So if you like fried batter in the shape of a ring, this is the spot for you.\n\nIn review, our trip to Red's went like this: free parking, one free beer, a free order of fries, and a free view of the bay. Not to mention the guys working here are all pretty nice and personable. But looking back on it now, if we hadn't received those things, my review for Red's would probably be lower.

You get to sit on the pier and just hang out.  There are chairs, tables and umbrellas.\n\nThere are drinks available, including $1.75 PBRs (every day) and a few deals on Corona, Anchor and some other beers.  These of course enhance the previous point.\n\nThe food (at least the burgers) are relatively average but they are made very fast.  Make sure you request a hamburger bun, I think by default they come on the rather unweildy sour dough roll.\n\nThe prices are very low.

It's essentially a mustard and pickle sandwich with no flavor other than the condiments. The coke cans we received with our order were hella dirty, and the onion rings were nothing more than previously frozen, deep fried batter. I could find no onion inside.

Last time I went in and ordered a burger with onion rings I got soggy refried onion rings that I watched them dump back into the fryer to warm up. They were the kind that seem strangely processed like they were extruded from some funky onion ring machine (like the kind that come at Burger King). Needless to say the onion rings came out tasting like sad, greasy oil biscuits.\n\nThen to make matters worse, I watched them put a burger that had been sitting on the backburner into my bun. It was really the saddest burger I've ever had. I'm never going back. Even their coffee tastes like Foldger's now. \n\n# # # \n\nIf you're looking for diner breakfast, it doesn't get any better than this. Red's has a limited menu, but its two egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns is the best in the city. THE BEST IN THE CITY!\n\nYou wanna know why? It's the hashbrowns and bacon, both of which are cooked to a perfect crispy, greasy perfection. The hashbrowns are fried *hard* on one side, flipped once and fried hard again allowing for one sheet of crispy, crunchy fried goodness that is lite and fluffy on the inside. Toast comes slathered in melted butter, and I always get my eggs over medium because once or twice I asked for over easy and sunny side up and got runny whites which is NOT OK.\n\nAnother reason why it's the best dinner breakfast in town is that Red's doesn't serve crappy dinner coffee! The coffee is ground fresh on location and is definitely NOT Foldgers. \n\nAnd lastly, it's the \"manbiance\" (like ambiance, but manlier). When I go in the morning, the place is full of manly, blue collar types: construction workers, police officers, firemen and dock workers, usually bearded and older. I like to sip my coffee as I wait patiently for my breakfast, listening to the oldies and imagine that I am a fisherman, headed out early for the morning's first catch. YEAH RIGHT.

Well, a few dozen vases of flowers, artificial candles, gold paper tablecloths, and a red carpet runner down the center of the outdoor patio, transformed this burger joint -- historically a hangout for longshoremen, politicians and journalists -- into a delightful wedding venue.  Owner Sean was warmly accommodating with our planning; friendly and fuss-free.  On the magical night of the wedding, the City was warm, the Bay Bridge lights were twinkling, little flower girls sprinkled fairy dust on a red carpet, the Giants were leading the Tigers in the third game -- we would not have traded the place for the Sistine Chapel.  Our English friend said the fish and chips were great, although the \"chips\" were quite different from what he experienced as a lad.  Food was delicious.

I generally trust him as Les Halles, the restaurant where he formally served as Executive Chef back in my old stomping grounds of NYC, had the greatest $20 plate of steak frites I've ever had. So when I saw him standing at the end of a long pier washing a greasy cheeseburger down with a cold Anchor Steam before my recent move to SF, I knew I had to check this place out once I moved here. \n\nIn terms of atmosphere and pricing, Reds doesn't disappoint. You can sit on their large outside deck right off the bay and get insanely cheap buckets of PBR's or pitchers of beer and munch on some greasy artery-cement without breaking the bank. I saw someone eating the fish and chips, served in a paper boat with plastic ramekins of tartar, and it looked deep-fried to a golden brown with meaty chunks of flaky white fish... kind of wish I would have gotten that. \n\nNow on to why I only rated Reds three stars. While the setting was stunning, the beer was ice cold, and it was a good experience overall, the burger sucked! I really couldn't believe how disappointing it was. It's not so much the sourdough bread serving as bun (although I am a traditionalist when it comes to burgers), my problem had more to do with the patty. Do their burgers come in frozen and individually sealed? It was the most flavorless, peculiarly bound hunk of beef I've ever had the misfortune of digesting. And while I love the idea of white onions, yellow mustard,and dill pickle as the sole garnishes, not even that could save this awful hunk of meat. I'm confident Bourdain wasn't crazy about this burger and pulled a Rachael Ray in his bullshit delivery on camera while washing it down with a beer, because this burger is not good by any stretch of the imagination.

Totally awesome, except for the Fabulous People with sunglasses on their heads and golf-course polos and the pigeons that jump up on the tables, steal food, walk around under your tables and fly within a foot of your head. The best improvement: women come here now, tough-looking hotties who can drain a longneck without asking for a glass.", "author": "jim b."}

Although in recent years it has gone relatively up-market with a flat screen TV and an outdoor bar out back it is still the same place my grandparents visited in the 1930s before grabbing a Pan Am Clipper Ship across the sea. Originally built to serve the local dock-workers, Red's continues to serve an incredibly diverse crowd ranging from investment bankers and wayward dot-commers high on caffeine to police and artists...providing a much needed waystation between Bart the ballpark (whatever it is called these days). \nAlthough prices have gone up quite substantially, it is one of the few places in the city where you can get a great hamburger on a sourdough bun with a coke and fries safely out the door for $5 or $6. Also not to be missed are is the bar out back, a great place to melt away the afternoon soaking in the view and defending your fries from the birds. \nDespite the name, Red's never seems to be as busy during the morning when they have yummy pancakes (with real maple syrup) and great egg dishes. \nMy only major complaint? They close quite early, something like 6p or 7p. Otherwise it would be a great place to hit up after work.

Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed.  The cheeseburger lacked flavor and was definitely on the dry side (though points should be given for using sour dough bread as the bun).  The french fries were, quite frankly, a little sad looking + soggy.  The ketchup tasted a bit funny too--almost like it was watered down.  However, what bothered me most wasn't the food but the FLIES!  OMG!  So many flies...  Also, let's not forget about our other friendly pests in the sky--the pigeons (also known as sky rats to some), two of which were brave enough to march into the kitchen and no one seemed to mind.  Am I weird for being a little weirded out?  For the first time in my life, I didn't finish my burger.  I literally lost my appetite as I was eating!  Sad :(", "author": "Sandy W."}

Red's was still full of working class folks in those days, dock workers construction tradesmen and the like. It changed ownership a handful of years ago and they expanded the kitchen and and added a bar and outdoor seating In the back with nice views of the bay, sea birds, and the bay bridge. Actually, in the old days, they didn't even have a fryer so you could only get your burger with chips because fries were not an option. They also used to have a small coffee roaster in the front dining room, but that has been removed. For the most part, the changes have been for the better and the food is still great. But it's not really a cheap working class spot anymore. It's also not nearly as packed at noon on a weekday as it used to be. I was there just yesterday at 11:45 and had a double chili dog. The service was fast, the food was great, but the place was a little desolate. The chilidog comes on a crusty sourdough roll and was heaping with chili. Impossible to eat with my hands, it was almost impossible to eat with the plastic utensils provided. But all in all, I enjoyed myself.

The bacon, sausage and eggs leave me wanting.  The eggs are usually Very cooked while I find the bacon to be generally undercooked (for my liking) and rather limp.  The bacon and sausage remind me a bit of something I would find on my McDonald's McSomethingforbreakfast.  Too put the breakfast in simplest terms...it's a great hangover breakfast joint.  The atmosphere seems pretty cool every time I am there.  It's laid back and yet not slow.  There's always an eclectic crowd.  You can find local construction workers grabbing coffee and a bite and business men in suits.  I've noticed the outdoor patio in the back and it looks like a great place to sit for a meal during the summer so I'd suggest trying it out if you eat your meal there.
