These are the important questions.\n\nUnfortunately, I have no answers.

(the movie), but that this is also her own personal speculation.\n\nBut anyway... to what actually matters in this review:\nWhenever I go to a new boba/pmt place, I always try the standard milk tea. The jasmine green milk tea here was decent-- not the best I've ever had, but not terrible either. I thought this was just my perception, but then I saw that another Yelper had mentioned this as well-- I felt like the sugar used in the drink tasted a bit like a sugar substitute instead of real sugar. \n\nThe boba/pearls themselves were also decent. They were the right amount of chewiness, so no complaints here.\n\nThe Pooh Bear drink is adorable to look at-- before it's mixed, there's a layer of red on top of the layer of yellow, just like good ol' Pooh Bear. \n\nRandom: Some advice from my E-Tea drink cup: Enjoy Tea. Enjoy Life. Enjoy E-tea in your life.\n\ntl;dr: Not the best milk tea I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.

Since E Tea shares the same storefront as my local-favorite, Super Pan, I had high hopes for their teas. I ordered the house black tea with milk and no boba for a friend and the mango slushie for myself.\n\nAt $4.50 for a pretty large size, it was a ok deal, but we really just wanted a regular 12oz cup so at least give us an option to go small! Service was mediocre -- points off because we got the mango slush a full 10 mins after we got the milk tea. They also mistakenly added boba but I think we can all overlook that because boba tea is called boba tea for a reason. On top of that, the lid wasnt sealed very well, causing the drink to leak out. \n\nThe taste was not worth $4.50. The milk tea tasted watered down and the mango chunks they put into the slushie was very sour. Tastes like how I would imagine cold mango-flavored syrup withsmall pieces or unripe mango cubes. I would price that at most at $3.00 flat. Wasn't worth the trip, we both didn't finish the massive starbucks venti-size cups of goop. I won't be back.", "author": "Nat E."}

I was first drawn in by the cute logo and cups. The fact that it's also next to Tea One and inside of Superpan gives this place business. \n\nAnyways, on to the drinks and the food. For any drinks, you could either choose a 20oz bottle for $4.50 or a 24oz cup for $3.99. My boyfriend and I ordered a Matcha Milk Tea that comes with pudding and red bean and a Thai Tea that comes with boba and grass jelly, and we ordered the popcorn chicken. We were told that they ran out of boba and asked us to choose something else to substitute, but we were fine with that. \n\nOur popcorn chicken was served in a tiny brown to go box. The most ripped off thing about it is that they only filled the box to half way up with chicken. For a moment, I thought it was left over chicken from the previous order. It was $6.99 and the fact that they gave such a small portion..???? Not worth it. The popcorn chicken wasn't bad tho, it was edible. I'd rather go get my popcorn chicken craving satisfied at Quickly's. \n\nThe drinks were really watered down and had a funny taste. I don't even know how to describe the taste of their Thai Tea, but yuck!

I got the jasmine milk tea here and the 25% sweetness was the perfect amount, allowing the tea flavor to really shine through and not be overpowered. \n\nAlso i dont know about you guys but i've got smaller than normal hands so the fact that these plastic cups are taller and skinnier is AMAZING.

We ordered the taro milk tea with boba and taro chunks and matcha milk tea. The flavor just wasn't there for both drinks. The boba balls were too soft and chewy. A few sips in and had to throw the rest away. \n\nThe default size is a glass milk jar with a plastic cup. The upgrade size is a gigantic cup like purple cow that won't fit in your car cup holder. The price is also a little heftier than most drinks in the city, probably to cover for the glass jars. Sorry ETea, hopefully this review can serve as a review for improvement. Good luck!", "author": "Amy T."}

It's got some stiff competition since it's so close to sharetea and infinitea. I think this place does offer some unique options and is worth at least a try. \n\nCoconut mango sago: 2.5/5: a bit overly sweet it had good coconut and mango flavor but the litchi jelly made this drink overly sweet. I did like the touch of coconut it made this drink slightly better. But in all honesty, if I were to get mango sago is probably stick with creations or itea, they do it better. \n\nAlmond queen: 4/5: I tried this recently and I actually really like the combination of almond and taro together they come together really nicely in this drink. Although a bit sweet the flavor together was great. You could still taste almond and taro it wasn't as if one overpowered the other. Of the two drinks this one is the winner to me. \n\nIf I'm not in the mood for sharetea, I would definitely stop by this place again for the almond queen. Also price is a bit high but that's because they use glass bottles, not sure if you get a discount for bringing them back.\n\nTotal for 1: $5", "author": "Stella J."}

Cool, now we can eat AND get boba at the same time. The guy working even told us that we can place an order from the boba counter and he'll bring over the drinks to our table at superpan once he's done! Neat. :)\n\nFirst of all, there was SOO many selections to choose from and they all looked and sounded so good!! I can barely choose! Finally, I opted for\nthe Chrysanthemum Honey Tea w/ aloe and berry. The friend ordered the Princess Rose Tea Creama w/ lychee. \n\nThe drinks came out in a TALL glass cup. Bigger than we thought! the Chrysanthemum Honey Tea was really refreshing and I loved the pairing of the red berries. I can also taste the tea flavor and the sweetness was perfect; not too little and def not too overbearing. My friends Princess Rose Tea was also really good too and refreshing to drink. Although she would prefer to have less creama cause her tea kinda turned into a milk tea after mixing the creama but it was still a great pair; just gotta let the barista know to add a little less next time! \n\nOverall, service wise was good! How often do you get your boba brought to you while you order food right next door! But since they're a restaurant/boba place now, people can either grab a boba drink and leave OR sit down to eat AND drink! ^__^ \n\nAnyhow, we were very pleased with our drinks. Our barista, Ben, was very accommodating and walked us through their selection of milk teas and fruit teas which led us to know what we want. Our drinks turned out better than expected. Def going to try the Almond Queen next !", "author": "Anissa D."}

I was originally going to get Sharetea, but was drawn in by the cute cow logo everywhere, especially the glass bottle that you get to keep. They seem to advertise the 10 or 15 main drinks pretty heavily, although it does seem that you can customize with the type of tea and toppings if you so choose. I got the hokkaido with 50% sweetness, which turned out to be close to ideal (maybe a bit less sweet than 50% at other places). All of their drinks come with several types of jelly, which might be good if you like variety. The milk tea tasted a bit watery, but otherwise it was fine. \n\nA couple points of improvement could be that the straw was a bit short (only a bit longer than the bottle itself), and the drink could've been colder before being served, since there is no ice in the drink.", "author": "Tony D."}

The bottle is honestly the reason why I wanted to check this place out. I expected a much smaller bottle for some reason however, I'm pretty damn glad that it wasn't. You might miss this place if you aren't looking hard enough. The upside is that Superpan is connected. So you could eat and have boba. Downside, if you come here just for boba. You will have to wait outside. the place by itself is very small. \n\nMoving on to the milk tea. The first time I went (last night) I expected this place to be bigger. I ordered the caramel milk slush with boba and pudding. I always try to order the same drink with pudding because I prefer pudding than boba. So anyways, I didnt get to drink the bottle for an hour. One big upside to a bottle is being able to refrigerate the milk tea easily. Once I opened it, gosh darn it was good. The caramel was a little too sweet but the boba and pudding were so soft (especially after refrigerating the slush). \n\nThis morning, I was craving boba as a pick me up. Sooo... boba it was. Honestly was the smartest choice I have ever made. It's so damn good. I got the ice cream milk tea with the hokkaido milk tea with coffe jelly, pudding, and boba! It's my all time favorite!

It just barely pokes out of the bottle as is so the height is a tad awkward. \n\nPrices were comparable to other boba places, and I think competitive if you think specifically of the places that give you glass bottles (Plentea, Bottles Zup.)\n\nService was good - our cashier gave us the sample of popcorn chicken even though we hadn't asked for it (saw the grand opening promo signs but had just eaten), so that was a nice gesture. \n\nOverall, I'll probably stop by in the future to try out a few of their other drinks, or maybe eat in next time!", "author": "Delia Z."}

We literally stood in between Sharetea and this new place, vacillating between the two options before deciding to try something new. E-tea is located in the same building as Super Pan.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nWe ordered the taro drink and the coconut drink. The taro drink was pretty good, with thick chunks of real taro and chewy boba. The boba was clearly fresh, so good! The drink itself tasted like fake taro, but some people are into that. The coconut drink tasted like shampoo smells....but in a pleasant way? The milk drinks were blended with ice, but so smoothly that they were not quite the consistency of a slushy. Both drinks were a little too sweet and I didn't see any options to cut down on sugar.  \n\nIn essence, this place is good for those diabetes-inducing drinks. It was late so I didn't want to order anything with caffeine, but I would come back and try something sort of milk tea to better judge this place. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nThe drinks start at around $4.50, which is steep in my opinion. However, after traipsing over to Sharetea, the prices are actually around the same, considering that Sharetea charges $.55 for each additional topping while E-Tea currently offers a free upgrade to Super size (32oz) and has two toppings built into each drink. I also saw tea-spressos for around $5.35, which seems utterly ridiculous. I guess the price of the glass bottle is built into the cost, but I don't need a glass bottle. If you get the free size upgrade, you don't get a nice glass bottle to keep.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe cashiers were super helpful and patient while my sister and I were deliberating over drinks. They answered our questions and gave suggestions. However, the drinks took a good 20 minutes to come out. We weren't in a hurry and didn't mind, but I can see how this could seriously irk people.\n\nBonus star because I might come back the next time I'm craving a taro slush. I would even want to try one of their tea drinks but only if that free size upgrade is still available.\n\nTL;DR: Pricier boba but comparable cost to Sharetea with the free upgrade and built-in toppings. On the sweeter side.", "author": "Abby W."}

This was when they didn't have the cup option, so I received their cute bottle which I still have! The mango sago was delicious - I would stay it's a tie between I-Tea's mango sago.\n\nThe second time, I got mango sago again but in their cup this time. The 24oz cup is more than I'm used to, but I managed to finish my drink besides some leftover mango chunks and boba! The shop next door charges as much as my mango sago and their oz is less. \n\nPlus, E Tea has a lot of drink options that already come with toppings at no extra cost. I am not sure if they charge for extra toppings - I saw a sheet on the counter with a variety of other toppings, but didn't catch a price. I feel like you get more for smaller price here than the one next door.\n\nI also like the variety of different drinks they have. My sis got the Winnie the Pooh one and she said it was really good. And the time we went, there was only one person making drinks (and maybe cooking food too??) for several other customers before us.

Aside from that, the cashier and employees were nice and informative of their menu.   Noticing the majority of the drinks included toppings, I inquired whether any toppings can be substituted.  \"Yes\", the cashier said.  Good to know in case you preferred your favorite topping instead of the already included one(s).  \n\nBoba: Black sesame milk tea.  It's definitely unique and tasty.  Like another reviewer commented, the drink tastes like a Chinese black sesame paste dessert.  The boba was good: soft & chewy, the way I like it.  Unlike other places that have squared-bottom bottles, the product comes in a glass bottle with a round bottom so it fits nicely in a cup holder.  One quibble is that 1/8\" of the straw peeks just over the lip of the bottle, making it a little challenging for drinkers to enjoy their beverage, unless one completely avoids the straw.  Other than that, I will make a return trip to try other flavors.  Hmm, I wonder if there's any discount for reusing the bottle?", "author": "Jessica S."}

It's kind of awkwardly placed, as you have to walk through E Tea to get to Super Pan. This creates a huge crowd in the E Tea space, waiting for their boba and/or waiting to get seated at Super Pan. As for the drinks at E Tea, my oolong milk tea with lychee jelly was good, but watching them make it was kind of disgusting. They use a very thick cream that settles on the top of the boba cup, even after they shake it up before giving it to you. They made our orders wrong by reversing the add-ins, so they remade mine and my fiance left his as is. They only have 20 oz and 24 oz sizes, and their add-ins menu is only available at the register, as far as I could tell. They have most of their other menu items posted around. I would go back, but I would not order a milk tea, since the cream was pretty gross looking and tasted a bit too rich.", "author": "Christina G."}

The space is small though shared with another business to the left (I'm not familiar with the area so I didn't really pay attention).\n\nI got a roasted milk tea with boba and grass jelly (they were out of pudding), and was satisfied with the prominence of tea flavor.

Popcorn chicken was seasoned and crispy.\n\nI think it's a pretty solid boba drink shop, great if you're in the area and looking to quench your thirst and don't feel like going to the ShareTea one or two doors down. Prices are a tad more expensive but I think it's an up charge for the glass bottles you get to keep. They're cute but I'm not really sure what the average Joe is going to do with them.

I don't think I've seen Super Pan packed so the use of the space on the right was a good move. It's the same owner and if you decide to dine at Super Pan, you can order a drink on the same bill (unlike Bottle Zup & Shabu House on Clement). This is the third boba spot in this area... Sharetea and InfiniTea share the same block. \n\nE Tea offers drinks in the bottle, just like Plentea and Bottles Zup. The only difference is that you do NOT get a discount for bringing it back. You simply get the bottle to keep... so if you're a huge fan of this place, you could rack up a good number of these bottles. The weird part is that if you opt out of the bottle, you get the typical plastic container cup. However, the size of this plastic cup is the size of Purple Kow's Super. Yet both drinks, regardless of size, are the same price. I'm pretty sure the bottle vs cup size has a noticeable difference in ounces. Drink prices range from $4.50 to $6.50 (Durian smoothie). \n\nThe customer service is very nice. They had misunderstood one of our drinks and gave us the mistake drink along with the correct drink. \n\nI got the earl grey fresh espresso... which is a tricky name as it does not contain coffee. It's different from other drinks and the creama ratio isn't perfected. It's good but the combination with Coffee Jelly and Boba don't particularly work. The boba is surprisingly good though, very soft and chewy. \n\nI think I'll come back and try one of their milk tea drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-28", "description": "I went to E Tea, about a week ago. My friend and I ordered our drinks and the wait for the tea was about 5-10 minutes. The tea itself was delicious, creamy, and sweet. The pricing is pretty normal for boba. The boba itself was decent, not exceptional or my favorite. The staff are extremely kind and friendly. Definitely not my favorite boba place in San Francisco, but in the top 3, no doubt. I would have rated E tea higher if it did not take so long to get our drinks, we were the only customers, at the location at the time.", "author": "Natalie N."}

I walked in and there was no line and the person ringing me up just looked at me and didn't greet me at all. But I was like whatever I'm just go ahead and gonna order my drinks. I ordered a house milk tea with boba and it had a strong bitter taste. I didn't taste anything sweet in it. The boba was okay though. I'll return if this place improves their drinks.", "author": "Cee H."}

The drinks for the most part range from $4.50-$5.25 or so and right now they are doing a promotion which they give you free popcorn chicken with purchase. It is a very limited selection of drinks but you can choose between milk tea, green/black tea, and fruit teas. They give you a small bag of popcorn chicken and even though it wasn't freshly made and cold it was actually not bad. Hope that actually gets added on their menu because I didn't see it anywhere on there. The drink itself was not bad we had the Princess Rose Tea Crema and I liked its flavor and it comes in a glass bottle similar to Plentea! Only difference is it is a round bottle on the bottom so it fits into your cup holder.", "author": "Angela S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-06", "description": "They also recently converted half the restaurant to E Tea, which has freshly brewed, creative boba drinks. I say creative because they do more toppings than just boba. I asked the barista what was most popular (because they know what's best), and I ended up with the princess rose tea crema with lychee jelly, light sweet. It was nothing like I've tried before, sweet, light, and refreshing. Not to mention, it came in a glass bottle! It's a quality bottle too with a secure cap, and the design was printed onto the bottle, not placed on a sticker and then on the bottle, like I've seen at other places. I'll definitely be reusing the bottle on regular occasions. Sharetea better watch itself, they got good competition ;)", "author": "Alice H."}

I believe San Francisco is inundated with boba shops, from Quickly, Infinitea, Sharetea, Boba Guys, BottleZup, PurpleCow, and what else... And now E Tea! \nThe menu is bright, colorful fruit decorations all \nover it.. So many choices, different from the other tea shops.. Hokkaido milk tea, Sa Wa Di Ka Thai iced tea, Princess Rose tea Creama with lychee jelly, all very interesting. Today I tried a Matcha milk tea with red beans, and add vanilla ice cream. Dessert in a bottle!! And did I mention the bottle has a cute cow logo on it?? \nThere is no charge for supersize it to 32 oz, the drink then comes in a plastic cup instead of the bottle with the cute cow logo. \nE Tea, my new to go to milk tea place...", "author": "lovetoeat a."}

I ordered a dark roasted oolong crema with no toppings and they made it with a lot of toppings. I think it may have been the Asian lady who came in to help half way when the guy was making my order. Instead of looking at what the order said and was special request was made, she just made it. I didn't realize it at the time. I'm disappointed in my experience. They get a 2 star because the milk tea was decent. I don't know about coming back. It is expensive and you are just pretty much paying for the glass.", "author": "Mirgan C."}
