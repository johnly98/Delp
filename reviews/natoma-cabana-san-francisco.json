I came on a Friday evening around prime Happy Hour time (6pm) and was surprised to find the atmosphere comparable to a frat party -- everything from the music, to getting spilled on my tipsy people, and even just to the general age range of the patrons reminded me of being in college again. \n\nDrinks are pretty strong and are an average price for SF although I wouldn't want to spend too much time around the bar as it gets cramped quickly. There's a sweet upstairs area you can check out but again, if there's too many people it can feel a bit stifling. \n\nOverall, a cute little spot to check out!

When I went to check for my review I realized I NEVER WROTE ONE! \n\nHmph... How could that happen? I'll blame the old fashioneds (with proper ice cubes and premium whiskey) and the awesome vibe in this bar that had a few of us staying way past everyone else! \n\nNatoma Cabana is at the end of a street/alley somewhere near FiDi, and I highly suggest you use Yelp maps to get you there. I think they qualify as a hidden gem because of the location, unique array of seating options, including some namesake cabanas, proper cocktails, and aforementioned premium selection of whiskeys! They also have a rad area upstairs too for big groups or private parties. \n\nFrom our experience this seems to be a popular spot for people visiting SF for work. We came as a big group and slammed the bar all at once, but right behind us was another group of colleagues, and behind them another! \n\nFour stars here simply because even before it got busy, the service was a little off. I know I was overlooked quite a few times and I don't really appreciate that, especially when you've given them every sign you want to order or pay.

The bartender alternately gave me a little attitude when I ordered a vodka soda (which I'll never understand, it may be basic as hell I'm giving you too much money for the easiest drink you could possibly make...which will help you with quick service, an apparent issue of yours), and ignored me in favor of the beautiful ladies in the area (which I absolutely understand, but don't really appreciate). \n\nThe cocktails are well made though; I liked the Goldfinger (like a Gold Rush, but with rye) and the Watchmen (whiskey, benedictine and fruitiness), even if they are a bit sweet, and the comfortable cabana seating makes for a nice spot to lounge around.

Though annoyed, I'm thankful the bartender ran our cards.\n\nWith that said, I haven't been to Natoma Cabana since a Yelp Elite event several years ago, so I'm happy that they are still up and running.  My friends and I were here on a hot Friday night, and it was crowded.  We found seating in the loft, but unfortunately that's where all the heat was accumulating.\n\nWe ordered two Caribbean Zones and one El Cholo.  The Caribbean Zone was good.  It had rum, lemon, and passion fruit.  Unfortunately, my friend who ordered the El Cholo could not drink it.  It had mezcal, pineppale, and mint, which sounded good to her, but I guess it wasn't executed properly.\n\nThe atmosphere is very loud.  It's a small venue, so the crowd plus the music drowns out everything.  Plus, there's currently a lot of construction outside due to the Salesforce, so it's just noisy all around.  The seating on the ground floor is cute with couches and cabanas, while the loft has one couch with wooden seating on the side.\n\nAll the cocktail drinks were $12, which makes picking a drink easier.

If I didn't have a large group to follow, I might not have found it as easily because it's tucked away in a street corner behind some building. \n\nNow, I'm a fan of tiki bars. Something about the tropical vibe, pretty string lights, and yummy drinks, just give me all the happy vibes. The minute you step into Natoma you're taken into a tropical oasis. There are paper lanterns and string lights hanging from the ceiling, big, cozy cabana lounge chairs throughout the whole lower level, and tropical cocktails to match. They also have an upstairs area, which apparently is really nice and much more spacious, but I never had the chance to check it out.  \n\nIt took a long time to order drinks and for them to show up, but hey, I'm giving the guy a break because he was by himself and just got hit with a 50-60 person rush.

The space is really cool and when we were there on Friday at around 8:30pm, it was buzzing but not packed. Most of the crowd appears to be from the offices around, notably LinkedIn. We definitely felt like the right demographic for the bar and felt comfortable though. We were a bit cold since the space is drafty and they leave the door open. It seems to be a converted storehouse with a loft area. Wicker furniture fills the space which feels pretty appropriate and adds to the tropical atmosphere.\n\nI ordered El Diablo and A had the Smokestack #2, both being $12 which is pretty standard. It took a bit of time to get served by a bartender when it wasn't extremely busy but the drinks take time to make so I get it. We got our drinks and sat on a couch for some people watching.  El Diablo was a tasty, light drink which I appreciated. It was refreshing but not too sweet. I would definitely order it again. The Smokestack #2 was very very strong and I personally hated it.

They don't serve food so I brought my own food from a local taqueria and Natoma Cabana was kind enough to supply us with a table to place the food on (if you do this the set up is out in the open, so you might get a couple of strangers nibbling on your food). There were 1-2 bartenders throughout our time there and the drink menu had a variety of different cocktails as well as house wines and some beers. Our group enjoyed the shang-a-lang and ordered it for several rounds. I really enjoyed the seasonal IPA they had, as well as a drink the bartender made when I asked for a spicy tequila drink. Upstairs looked really nice- perfect for private parties but unfortunately the minimum was a bit high for a small group like ours. I would definitely recommend it if you have a decent sized group or people coming throughout the night.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Basil Higgins and Caribbean Zone. Both drinks were quite delicious.

They must not have started the happy hour yet, because beers were regular priced (starting around $6) and all cocktails were a flat $12. The contrast on the menu design was a little intense, so I asked what was on tap and proceeded to go with a Guinness. \n\nA few observations:\n* Floor plan - Aside from the bar & the loft space above (which was being used for a private event), there's some really comfy looking furniture on both the left/right sides between the entrance and the bar in the back... this worked beautifully when there weren't that many people, but once people started pouring in after work, it absolutely killed the more relaxed vibe that we were enjoying. The seating looked really comfy, but we all quickly sinked into the seats a little too much and we all had to reach uncomfortably far to sit our drinks down on a small cylindrical piece of wood. It's one of those things you don't think about until you sit there for a while and realize you're slowly inching further and further out of your seat just so that you don't have to get up and grab your drink for a sip. \n\n* Noise level - Other Yelpers commented about the noise level, especially in the loft area. I've been to enough bars to understand that there's only so much control the owners have over the noise level... though my gripe was that before the crowd even get mildly loud, the guys at the bar seriously cranked up the hip hop on the speakers to the point where the I couldn't even hear my friend that was sitting right across from me.

On return visits though, it became apparent that the space isn't as well designed to handle the mass of humanity post work. \n\nDuring weekday happy hour, it gets really packed and the bar is just a cluster of a mess making it very difficult, and long, to get a drink. Having more defined spaces at the bar for orders might ease the confusion. They do have comfortable spaces to lounge on the main floor but those typically get taken up super early. Quite likely you might end up in the loft area but the problem with most loft areas, like the one at Limon in the Mission, is that it gets really loud with all the reverb being that close to the ceiling. \n\nNot completely writing off Natoma Cabana yet. I can see it working on the weekends when it's less hectic but I'm probably going to give it a skip after work when there are easier watering holes nearby to enjoy a drink.", "author": "Jon L."}

Decorated with Ian Ross' signature mural art and boasting a picturesque high ceiling nicely accentuated with simple yet charming lighting - the space is inviting and intimate. Like his much loved Sentinel and Golden West sandwich locations - Dennis Leary (with Eric Passetti) has created a straightforward space that those \"in the know\" gravitate to. Though the downstairs area did seem busy and the bar hard to get to - I really enjoyed kicking back in the stunning wood lined upstairs area which our group had reserved in advance. \n\nIf you're looking to host a private gathering in the Financial District during the weekday - I highly recommend reaching out to Natoma Cabana. I imagine that it must be more difficult to reserve space on the weekend - but for a small group their upstairs is lovely.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

It was a little crowded but not overwhelming.  I imagine it will get pretty crazy on a Friday post work hours.  It will be interesting to see how they handle the crowds then.  The noise level was tolerable, but again I wonder what it will be like when the place is cranking.\n\nWhen I was there it was still light out, so there was a nice glow of light from the windows in the ceiling.  What do you call them?  they aren't really skylights since its like half the ceiling.  anyway ... the loft area is is a nice touch.  It was there back in the JC days as a VIP area on busy nights, but never went up there then. \n\nI didn't try a cocktail, I was in a pint mood. That said, the selection of spirits looks reasonable - a decent mix of well and high end spirits without trying to have everyone imaginable.  The bartenders seemed fairly efficient with only a few \"where the heck is that\" moments.  And my pint was from a fresh keg.\n\nso overall pretty good.

UTTER MORONS!!!\n\nI ABSOLUTELY hated this place, so much so that I left the event there an hour early because it was so insufferable.\n\nI hope for Ian Ross' sake, someone paints over his exterior or it will drastically devalue his art if this idiotic place stays in business.", "author": "Marc C."}

I've been for a happy hour and we had part of the upper level reserved on a Friday early in the afternoon. I loved the atmosphere here; at least when I went it was not too loud so it was easy to chat. It got more crowded and loud as time went by.\nThe drinks are tasty and affordable. I did not explore the menu but it looked like they had a good selection of beers, too.\nI think it's a great place to try since it's located in a small alleyway so not many people coming in & out, and not much noise from the street. I recommend coming here early, though, because once I came by around 6pm on a Friday and it would have been impossible to sit or have a chat.", "author": "Dodi G."}

First off, the space itself is really cool and second, if you can snag a seat up front it's pretty spacious and comfy.  Only downside is that you have to bear the crowd to grab your drinks and then carry them all the way up front.  Cocktail service would have been nice where we were.  There may have been cocktail service but we were never approached about putting in an order.

I ordered a glass of wine which was $10. When I went home and checked my credit card online statement, I realized he charged me extra 50 cents on top of what I tipped him hoping that I would not notice. Our team goes there quite often because of the location and the vibe. So it is really disappointing to know that you can trust the place you go for HH all the time.  It is only 50 cents but I heard that's what those bartenders do so you wouldn't notice. I bet this guy does this all the time.

I had to plan a happy hour for a work event and emailed the coordinator at Natoma Cabana (which I believe turned out to be the owner or manager) to reserve the upstairs lounge. He was super nice and offered to waive the minimum since we'd be arriving before the Friday happy hour rush. Unfortunately, my boss's presentation went too late and we were about 30 minutes late to arrive. The contact emailed me asking if we were still planning on reserving the spot, I responded within 5 minutes confirming and apologizing for running late. When we arrived, they had already started to open the reserved section to other guests even though it wasn't busy. When checking-in with the contact, I asked if he received my reply and his response was \"I haven't checked my email\". Although the people were kind enough to move from our previously reserved section, he came back and said to not turn people away since we were late. There was no language in the original email correspondence stipulating that the reservation would be given up after a certain period of time. I fully understand their need to operate as a business, but seriously? This was not the customer service I expected by a venue, which has many private events. This was a few months ago and have since avoided this place until tonight. I went in for happy hour tonight because my friend wanted to go (only reason!). The owner/contact was at the bar and completely blackballed and refused to serve us. To the point he acknowledged my friend and turned the other way... Not to help serve someone else but to drink a glass of water! I refuse to come back.
