It's cheap, it's fast, it's conveniently located, and the food is pretty damn good. \n\nThe inside is nothing fancy. They only have 5 tables in the whole restaurant. But, the fast and friendly service makes up for the cramped vibe you may get while dining here.\n\nMy go-to is the curashi Dan sashimi combo, 17$. It is 12-15 slices of sashimi (depending on what fresh fish the chef's have available, and how thick the chef slices the fish), atop a bed of sushi rice with a side if seaweed salad and a cup of miso soup! My boyfriend and I have had several of the rolls on their menu, all if which have been pretty good. Their hand rolls (Maki) are an amazing value - usually 5-7$ and it's just as much fish as the regular rolls, just a little harder to eat. \n\nThe sake menu here is pretty great too - most of their sake bottles are between 10-15$ and you'll get 12-16 shots out of it! Their happy hour is okay - nothing special... But their wine is a little cheaper and there are a few appetizers included. \n\nWe will continue to eat here when we are craving sushi in North beach!", "author": "Taylor D."}

Even if it was $4.50, it would have been a really good deal. It was warm and soft enough to bite into it. The miso soup that came with my order was warm as well. My bento box was good and large. The tempura was very crunchy and consisted of yam (3 pieces), broccoli, and a carrot piece. \n\nMy friend was able to ask for extra wasabi for free. \n\nThe waiter checked in with us and asked if our food was good. \n\nI will say that both of our meals were a little bit on the expensive side. \n\nThe place can be a little loud.

This is one of those establishments. \n\nThe veggie tempura ramen I had was absolutely delectable--reminds me almost of the famous Ippudo in NYC. All the ramens have the option of spicy or not spicy, which is right up my alleyway since the spicier the better.  My mom typically prefers udon, but since this place only offers ramen noodles, she opted for that instead. She was definitely not disappointed as she was raving about about the grilled chicken ramen the entire time! \n\nWe were both very dehydrated after the meal though. The MSG level was probably off the charts, but treat yoself to a savory delight every once in a while. A little monosodium glutamate never killed nobody, (I hope.) \n\nTip: If you're using the groupon, the combos aren't valid with it.

The combination of inconsistent quality food and mediocre service are the reasons. \n\nWe had \n- the chashu ramen and that's ok. My older daughter liked this \n- the fried chicken ramen and the chicken tasted a bit sour.  I think it's just old.  We are now worried about food poisoning.   We told the waiter to tell the chef.  We didn't expect a refund just a comment as we ate the ramen and left most of the chicken.  He didn't know what to say. \n- dragon roll.  This was pretty good\n- Walu nigiri.  Fairly skim on the fish\n- hamachi Kama.  First time we had this was great.  This time it was undercooked and we had to ask them to go back and cook it more.  He did apologize but by this time we have lost our good impression of this place\n\nTo add on to this, service is lacking.  I had to ask for plates, bowls.  It's a Chinese run Japanese place and the waiter didn't speak much English.  I started to speak to him in mandarin. That helped a little. \n\nLastly, we were using a restaurant.com coupon.  We felt a little bit like a second class citizen as soon as he heard this.  \n\nImagine our whole family felt pretty unsatisfied with the meal and we paid $25 less than full price.

First off, parking is horrendous here.  I suggest getting an Uber/Lyft coming here.\nI ordered a Super California Roll and the Spicy Miso Ramen...my ramen took about 10-15 mins to come and the sushi came another 15 mins after that.  Finished my cup of water before the first batch of food came and never got my drink filled again.  Gotta tell you, it was quite the challenge to eat ramen and sushi (dipped in soy sauce & wasabi) without drinking anything! The next time I saw my waitress after serving my food was to hand me the bill.  Not one time did she asked me if I was okay, if I needed anything else, etc.  Paid in cash and the waitress never gave me my change.  Which was cool, I am not gonna make a big deal out of a few dollars, but the decision to tip was taken away from me, and on top of that, upon leaving, the waitress that \"helped\" me all night never thanked me in some form for my business! \n\nRamen was delicious, but the sushi was deep fried to death.\nGoes to show you that having the best food in town means absolutely nothing when you have staff that couldn't interact with customers to begin with! I wont necessarily stay away from this place, but I wouldn't jump through hoops and the traffic in the city to come here again. \n2/5 stars is generous in my book, considering the bad service and being dehydrated to an inch of my life after the long walk to my car for water.", "author": "Chris A."}

Sushi combo was not well made (pieces fell apart) and the rock n roll tasted funny, as if the eel was not fresh. This is mediocre food at best. Look elsewhere.", "author": "Steven H."}

I will say though we were thoroughly pleased with our visit. We arrived a few minutes before opening, and so we just walked around the block waiting for them to open. Once the doors were open, we went right in and were seated immediately. We both knew we wanted Ramen so I did the Pork Belly and Hubby did the Tonkatsu - both in spicy. For a chilly day in SF, it was PERFECT. The flavors were rich and intense and all in all - very delicious. We were pleased! Even though we were there during Happy Hour, we were not allowed Happy Hour prices due to the Groupon - no biggie. 2 Ramens ($10 each plus 1 large beer), ended up being about $33 out the door including tax and tip (so $20 on the groupon and $13 on the credit card). Not too bad for SF - plus a bonus they take Discover Card. We'd be back! The groupon sealed the deal :)", "author": "Vivian P."}

They try to charge as much as other high-quality sushi restaurants, so not only is it the food very mediocre, but the price is high as well. Definitely a hard pass on this restaurant.", "author": "Derrick W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-10", "description": "I came here on an early afternoon during the week, and the place was empty, but I assumed that was because they had just opened and it was a random Tuesday. The place was set up in a way that I can picture it being cute and intimate in the evening if it were busier, but this was not the case the time I went. \n\nI was casually greeted as I came in, solo, to grab a quick bite between meetings in the city, and seated at a booth in the back. The menu seemed to have a good number of things on it, and I settled on one of the sushi/sashimi combos (Combo F). I also redeemed a free miso soup by checking in on Yelp. \n\nNow the most important point of reviews is on the food and unfortunately, it was just OK for me.... the miso soup came out and it was rather bland and watered down, I feel that either there was not enough miso mixed in it, or it was just not seasoned well cause it didn't have the salty savory flavor that I was craving in a miso soup. The combo came out and the roll itself was good with an appropriate ratio of rice to other ingredients. I also thought the fish tasted fresh and was of good quality. However, the sashimi pieces that came with the combo were very thin and small slices. Not like the ones I see in the photos posted by other yelpers. Perhaps there was a new chef training or something, but I left feeling like I missed out on something. *In hindsight, I should have taken photos of what I got, but like the piglet I am, I just scarfed it down the moment it was placed in front of me.\n\nBottom line: The entire meal was exactly a 3-star \"just ok\" experience. I'd be interested in coming back again at a more busy time, to see if it is better that that, and if my first trip was a \"just opening up and getting started\" fluke, but with so many other food options in the area, I guess we'll see if that happens.", "author": "Jackie D."}

First it took forever for them to prepare the food, that caused a delay in the deliver; then when the food arrived: Sushi was soggy (california roll tasted like paste); the wasabi was bright green in color; Beef teriyaki was super salty and overcooked.  The only decent thing was the miso soup and salad.  They are charging $10 for that. WHAT!", "author": "Carina N."}

This is my second lunch order as the first was a bust from some place else. I ordered the shrimp tempura hand roll (shrimp NOT cooked!), you can see that it's clear and slimy which is not how cooked shrimp should look like! Second I ordered the veggie tempura roll which should have had sweet yam and potato. The veggies in here are orange. I'm assuming it's carrot because it's definitely not soft. It tastes like carrot. Where's the sweet yam and the potato?! Should have known better than to order from a restaurant on Broadway. I may have to stop ordering food from now on. Not cooked shrimp?!? That's outrageous!!", "author": "Sheena C."}

Hubby and sister-in-law were almost half done and I still haven't received my dinner.  It was obvious I was just sitting there and a server asked me what did I order.  She went to the back and a couple of minutes later came out with my food!  Who knows what happened but they need to time it so that all of the entrees come out the same time!

I even called the restaurant at 8:45 and the lady said oh we just sent the delivery guy out he should be there in 10 min which became 20min later... My order consisted of 2 bowls of ramen, one for me and one for a friend, 2 order of sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Seaweed salad was ok, but the rolls... $4 for one roll each and it was those hand rolls I one seaweed... Not a long one cut into pieces... They weren't that big either... What a rip off... Next up, the ramen... Ok ramen is better fresh and not delivered ok, but the soup didn't even have flavor and I asked for spicy on both and it wasn't even spicy. The noddles tasted like instant noodles and the texture felt like that too. It was all clumped up together even when I poured my soup in it... Bad delivery and estimated time and no flavor in the soup and what a rip off on the sushi", "author": "Emily S."}
