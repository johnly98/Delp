None the less, it had the best ratings out of the other Pho places so I thought I'll try it out. \n\nI can safely say their PHO is AMAZING!!!!! \n\nI ordered noodles with pho with rare beef and beef balls.

I was really worried that we wouldn't all fit into the restaurant based on the picture on Yelp. We got to Miss Saigon early in hopes to beat the lunch rush. We waited for a few minutes and was lead to the back of the restaurant and down a flight of stairs to a private room. We were all seated and served with water and menu and the interesting experience begins...\n\nOne of my coworker was looking for the restroom, about to go up the stairs she suddenly came to a halt at the staircase. I looked over and realized onions were rolling down the stairs. As we ordered our food we realized the lights were being dimmed... I mean... I guess its romantic to set to tone, but I was with my coworkers and I didn't want to eat up my nose in the dimmed lights. Then a waiter came in and turned on the karaoke machine! All of a sudden we had these karaoke songs playing in the background and random karaoke scenes on the TV. You'd think thats all but theres more! A few moments later the disco ball turned on and started spinning!!! A waiter came in and brought a fan to blow our way cause it was slightly warm in the room. At this point, we cannot even strike a conversation cause we are all so distracted and amusing by the surroundings. WOW Miss Saigon 6/5 on the experience, it is one I will never forget. \n\nThe Food:\n\nWe all ordered a variety of food, I ordered the lemongrass pork with an egg on top. The food was good but to be honest I have had better lemongrass pork. I think it is a general San Francisco thing where its really hard to find good Vietnamese food in downtown. I thought the egg was just slightly over fried and the pork was just slightly hard to cut at places. The pork was fairly thin but at sections there were some fat which made it hard to cut. For the price there was decent amount of meat and honestly it was kind of hard for me to finish all of it at the end. Overall, I give my dish a 3.5/5\n\nMany of my coworkers ordered Pho and they all seem to really like it and would give 4-4.5 stars. From what I heard the broth was really on point but the noodle and meat was ok. With that said the meat was very well cooked and easy to chew. \n\nWith all that said, I would give Miss Saigon an overall 4 star review and would definitely come back again. Whats really nice is that they are able to hold large parties. Maybe you can get the same unforgettable experience as we did.", "author": "Nina Y."}

After all, what could be more Vietnamese than eating your Pho while having Mamma Mia / Waterloo / Dancing Queen playing in the background?\n\nAlso jokes aside though, Miss SaiGon was in my experience the best pho I've had in San Francisco so far and second only to Madame Vo's in New York (although Miss SaiGon is substantially cheaper). \n\nPho is a relatively (composition speaking) simple dish. A simple clean broth paired with rice noodles and a protein of choice. Thai basil and bean sprouts can be added according to preference. That being said though, because Pho is such a simple dish, elevating it to a point where it makes a distinct impression requires a substantial amount of effort. \n\nThe first effort Miss SaiGon makes is to play Abba, which has been scientifically shown to elevate any dining experience by exactly 26.7% The second effort is to utilize good protein. Most pho places have a tendency to either skimp out on the meat that they use, or use poor quality meat. Another common mistake is to mistime the place of the undercooked filet into the broth, and plating up a borderline raw piece of meat.\n\nMiss SaiGon manages to avoid these classic mistakes by utilizing good quality beef and beef balls, as well as having a strong flavorful soup. Rice noodles can be difficult because although they have a fantastic texture, in terms of flavor they really don't have quite as strong of a starchy flavor. This works well with pho, because its meant to be such a clean dish, but it also forces restaurants to create broths that are both pure and impactful in terms of flavor. This is tremendously difficult to do, especially since creating a good broth requires substantial time and effort both in gently cooking the ingredients and skimming.\n\nThe short of it is that what Miss SaiGon doesn't lack in effort. And for a layman's dish such as pho, effort is what really shines here. Having the opportunity to eat here was really a tremendous experience. \n\n(-.5 stars for the slightly startling statue in the front though, although in retrospect is pairs well with the music they were playing.)", "author": "Samuel W."}

Yeah there's a lot of stuff you may not have eaten before, but be an adventurer! It's worth it.\n\nPortions are good. Better in person than take out. Service is fast and nice. You can also walk up to the counter to pay (efficiency ++).\n\nThe place closes at 9:30, but maybe it's not the best idea to wander around the tenderloin past then anyway.

I was feeling icky and luckily, my friends were amiable to my choice of lunch cuisine. Miss SaiGon was a close walk from my hotel, so we opted to eat here.\n\nEntering, it is definitely a typical run-of-the-mill Vietnamese restaurant. Nothing fancy. If anything, a little run down. But the servers are kind and the menu extensive.\n\nWhen I was here, we were able to check-in on Yelp to receive a free order of spring rolls, which were tasty! Nothing amazing, but I have had restaurants screw up spring rolls. These were definitely fresh and good quality.\n\nFor my main, I opted for the vermicelli noodle bowl with pork. I love pho, but that weekend was a hot spell and pho just wasn't gonna happen. For the price, the size of the bowl was huge! The meat wasn't the best I ever had, but the amount for the price made sense.\n\nThe waiter was great at refilling water and even gave us a free dessert which was delicious!

The egg rolls were good & crispy.  I had the veggie version, that has perhaps a bean filling that was a little strange to me. I think in the future I'd order the pork.  The crab wontons were my favorite part of this order!  So good & herby.  They were even good the next day, and I'm not much of a leftovers person.  The wings were also really good, and not overly spicy.  I was really looking forward to the pho, and the one I ordered sounded awesome reading other reviews. But unfortunately, it is not the right thing to order while staying at a hotel with no kitchen.  The meat arrived seeming more raw than rare to me.  I get it, the broth is probably supposed to help cook the meat...but by the time it was delivered to me, the broth had cooled.  Staying in a hotel, I had no way to reheat it.  I did taste the broth, and it was delicious! But unfortunately, I was too grossed out by the temperature of the meat to be able to eat it.

The seafood was ok, didnt use small baby shrimp, you can actually see the decent size shrimps. They raved about the soup being extra good.

I hadn't been back to this place for a few years, but when my dad was in town and we were craving some homey food, I immediately thought of this place. Service was very quick and attentive and food was delicious!\n\nBun Bo Hue (BBH)- Properly thick plump juicy rice noodle. It's a slight pet peeve of mine when restuarants use the thin kind of rice noodes, or worse (in my opinion), left over pho noodles at the end of the day. T__T But anyway! lol Miss Saigon does BBH well, with a decent amount of spice in the flavorful broth. There isn't huyet (blood cubes), but there is plenty meat!\n\nBun Cha Ha Noi- \"Cha\" to me usually refers to the steamed meatloaf that is typically finely processed pork/chicken...sometimes fish meat. But, because of the Northern VN dialect differences, I found out that in this case the \"cha\" was more like a softer version of grilled pork (thit nuong). All very tasty so I'm not complaining! The sweet juice works great poured over the side of thin noodles...you can even make a wrap with the accompanying side of salad, cilantro, sweet picked cabbage, and cucumber. \n\nSeafood eggroll- We got this appetizer as a togo snack... I don't recommend this method because of the rice paper they use as the wrap for the eggroll- storing it in a non-breathing container (like say....that plastic togo container) quickly turns the fried crunchiness into an unpleasantly tough/chewy consistancy. Taste is just fine though so if you're gonna get this, eat it asap!\n\nShrimp spring rolls- We also got this togo- pretty standard. Nothing standout, but still yummy with the peanut sauce. =]\n\nDefinitely will be back the next time I have a hankering for Viet while in the city!", "author": "Yen D."}

Spring rolls weren't bad but nothing special. \n\nMaybe we came on a bad night or at a bad time since it was later in the evening about an hour before closing time, but we still paid full price for our meals (not cheap by any means) and the staff gave no shits about our clear dissatisfaction. I had maybe two bites, and when our server asked us how the food was and we told him, he was just kind of like \"Oh\" and walked off. I understand that Asian restaurants tend to be much less philosophical about food and if you don't like what you're served, then it's a personal problem (none of that \"we take ~pride~ in our food\" sentiment), and that's fine.

However, we decided to go here because it was nearby. I ordered a rice dish with grilled pork and egg cake ($9.50), which I enjoyed although the egg cake wasn't quite what I expected. It was a darkish color and a bit dry too. I honestly couldn't tell there was egg in it. The fish sauce the dish came with was pretty tasty though. A bit more pungent than what I'm used to, but not in a bad way. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer ($7.75), which was tasty but for the cost and the portion size, I would probably pass.\n\nAs I wrote this review, Yelp informed me of their poor food safety score. Yikes! Although I can't say I'm surprised. The toilet had no handle (you had to pull some cord to flush it) and one of the people working there was sick, which makes me wonder if he handled my food because I'm actually sick right now.

Feeling a little under the weather, I opted for  Pho dac biet (beef combo), Goi du du bo (spicy papaya salad with beef jerky, peanut and basil), and kimchi. \n\nUsing the Eat24 app was quite simple, and I was able to put in my credit card number, and tip with ease. It also gave me an estimated time of arrival, which was pretty spot-on, as well as status updates when I checked as to when my order was being processed and when it went out. \n\nUpon receiving my order, some of the broth had made its way into the bag, which I wasn't shocked by, but maybe packing it a little bit better and providing napkins would be a good idea. Also would've loved to have a pho to-go spoon, since the soup spoon they provide doesn't really get much on it (so much as it gets on you), when eating pho in your bed watching Wheel of Fortune. \n\nThe pho was still a good temperature, with plenty of fixings to add. The taste of the broth was up to par with what I enjoy, but some of the meat was chewy and some parts were inedible. My favorite meat was the beef balls, so I'd suggest just getting that and the medium rare beef (I think) since it also worked well in the dish. \n\nThe kimchi was good. It wasn't super stinky like a few kimchis I've had in the past, so my roommate thanks you. The papaya salad was super meh. The papaya tasted fresh and had a nice crunch but the dish overall was pretty dry and the jerky didn't really add any complexity since it was just sprinkled on top. It says it's spicy, it was not so. \n\nI'd potentially order a different pho again from here if I was craving and really could not get myself out of my PJs, but maybe pack a big ol' spoon and maybe try some other dishes out.", "author": "Morgan F."}

Won Tons were pork only, but soft and juicy.\n\nCombination Pho: Good sized, and very flavorful broth with strong lemongrass flavor.  The only minor flaw was that it was on the oily side.  Had they skimmed off some of the oil, it would have been one of the better phos. Kudos to the waiter who asked whether we like tripe (we're not fans) - it was nicely missing from the dish.\n\nGrilled Pork Bun: This had surprisingly lots of noodles, way more than the sauce can handle!

The pieces of pork in the salad were good, but quite small, and any refined palate could easily tell that the shrimp were previously frozen - which is expected of this type of establishment.\n\nThe bill came and we both handed a credit card to waiter. He comes back a few moments later saying that he could only use 1 card, and has already charged my credit card without giving my table an opportunity to alter our preferred method of payment. \n\nAbsolutely unacceptable! I'd rather sacrifice my daughter to pagan gods before coming back here.", "author": "David D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "This 2-star review is mostly due to the customer service experience. Food at Miss SaiGon was about average for Vietnamese soup noodles, but the price was somewhat expensive for the portion size and the service was atrocious. Normally a large sized pho is big enough for me and my honey to share, but the bowl at Miss Saigon wasn't very large and didn't have enough noodles. I thought it was pretty pricey for $10. We also ordered the fried calamari but it wasn't crispy and battered enough.\n\nWe came with a party of 10 for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant was about half full, so not terribly busy, and there were about 4 servers who did not speak English very well. We placed our food and drink orders and the first thing that was brought out was a fresh coconut. \n\nThe server said 'coconut' and we all looked at each other confused. Then my friend said he ordered fresh lemonade, but the server kept pushing the coconut on him. Confused, my friend asked if the coconut was inside the lemonade and the server just said 'coconut'. So we just took the coconut and asked for another lemonade. \n\nThen I decided to order a Thai tea. After it was brought out, a different server then asked if I ordered a Vietnamese coffee. We were not falling for that trap again!\n\nThe food arrived at staggered times, most people ordered a pho, two ordered a rice plate, and one person ordered a bun bo hue (#27). Half way through eating, item #27 did not yet arrive. We inquired about it and the server said it was on the way. When we were almost done eating, the dish still hadn't arrived! It's one of the worst feelings being the only one not eating when everyone around you is chowing down and then when you are the only one eating, you can't enjoy the food because you're too busy worrying about making everyone wait because the food came so late. \n\nDefinitely not returning or recommending Miss SaiGon to anyone!", "author": "Adrienne K."}

I passed it 3 times looking for it in between Minna & Market. \n\nFor under $10.00 the vegetable soup is packed with roasted garlic & jalape\u00f1os , saut\u00e9ed green onion and an assortment of sliced zig-zag shaped carrots, zucchini, broccoli, bok choy and tofu.  There's even a nice little wedge of lime to spritz your soup when you're ready to mix. The only change I would make would be to cut the broccoli into bite size pieces. Otherwise it was exactly the flavor I was craving. If you're short on time and coming for lunch, you can expect to wait about 10 minutes for the soup. They package the noodles and vegetables separate from the broth. Not only does it make transport easy, it also allows you to control the portion of veggie/broth ratio. \n\nMiss SaiGon has an extensive menu and based on the crowd I saw inside, I'd bet there are many other options just as good as my soup.

Especially when I'm homesick and missing my mom's homemade Vietnamese cooking, you know homegirl will be running here with an appetite.\n\nWhile Miss Saigon is not exactly your hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant, it's also not your ritzy, fusion Vietnamese place either. It's kind of an in between place that's clean, consistent, authentic, and has good service. While the restaurant tends to be decently packed, I've never had to wait in line. I do need to commend Miss Saigon on their A+ effort to keep their restaurant well-decorated, especially during Christmas time, when they go all-out with winter decorations, making the ambiance super cozy and seasonal. I've had the Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Pancake), Pho (Noodle Soup), Bun (Vermicelli dish), Goi Du Du (Green Papaya Salad), Cha Gio Do Bien (Imperial Rolls), Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls), Cafe Sua Da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee). For the Banh Xeo and Cha Gio dishes, I generally have to ask for more lettuce, which the waiter is always super nice about replenishing (since you have to eat both the authentic way, using lettuce as a wrap before dipping in the fish sauce)! \n\nAlso, I usually come with my sister or her roommate, who comes pretty regularly, enough that the servers/owner recognizes him and always brings out a huge Che (Vietnamese coconut milk dessert) to share, on the house. I've never left Miss Saigon disappointed (besides the times I don't go with my sister's roommate and don't get the complementary dessert). \n\nI'll surely be back again when I'm craving Vietnamese food.", "author": "Christine T."}

Their filet mignon pho consists of a few pieces of meat and then a few sticks of noodle.  Seriously, I don't think it can fill up my six-yr-old nephew.  \n\nSecond, let's talk about the pho - is it good?  Sure.  But is it the best?  Not close.

The wait was 10 minutes for me because I was eating by myself. I noticed the whole restaurant was packed with people who worked around the area. \n\nThe customer service at the beginning was pretty bad, but I don't blame them because they have to serve the customers at the tables so they can turnover tables quicker. \n\nWhen I was seated, I spoke Vietnamese and asked what was the best soup the waiter recommended. He said bun bo hue. I chose that and I also ordered a thai dessert (Che). My bun Bo hue came out pretty quickly with veggies on the side. It was delicious, flavorful, great amount spiciness to it and had tons of meat. Even one of the waiters stopped by to ask if it was spicy enough for me and if I wanted more spicy sauce. I have never been asked that at any Vietnamese restaurants about the spice level so that's definitely a plus. And I have high standards for bun Bo hue. \n\nIt was also good customer service when a sweet old waiter stopped by to ask if I enjoyed my bun Bo hue to my liking when I was done with my soup. \n\nHowever, my Che thai took awhile. They were super busy serving other tables. I was patient enough to wait for it while eating my bun Bo hue. Waiter #1 was able to tell waiter #2 that my table needs Che thai now. So, they were able to notice that I was missing my drink without telling me, which is good. The Che was pretty mediocre. \n\nI'll be back for the bomb bun Bo hue!!", "author": "Kathleen U."}

Yay! \n\nA coworker and I have agreed to explore the literally crazy Tenderloins on our Friday lunches and I found this gem on Yelp. First thought when I entered was there are a good amount of Asian customers in here. Authenticity established. We were seated immediately even though the restaurant was pretty full. The staff was nice but it was a very rushed hello, come sit here, and set the menus on our table. I typically don't expect great customer service from any Asian restaurant. My only request is that my table is clean and I consume delicious food. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nSeafood pho with glass noodle (#22?) - the broth was on point! Everything else you can't really screw up. They delivered the sauce in a dish with the full bottles. We asked to split everything so they brought extra bowls and a ladle. I was excited about the ladle because I never got a ladle to split my meal. I felt a little giddy :) \n\nGrilled pork with imperial rolls over vermicelli - solid!! The meat was juicy and tender and full of flavor. Everything else you can't screw up. It came with a container of chili sauce on the side and fish sauce Perfect. I love chili sauce in my fish sauce stirred up. Try it. \n\nI also want to point out that there was a cucumber slice in our water. Freakin impressed and first time ever at a Vietnamese restaurant. Loved it! \n\nOverall, great food/ menu and friendly staff. I plan to come back to explore the rest of the menu. They even have bun bo hue and bun rieu, my favorite authentic home style dishes.

You get the traditional long noodles here, not the thin Pho noodles. It also had lime wedges, jalapenos, mint, basil, and slices of cabbage on the side. I asked for extra sate and they delivered.

I don't know if it's because of dinner hours, therefore more people and shortage of the prettier menus, but they hand out their boring, printed version of the menus instead (but with pictures, at least).\n\nAnyway, on to the food. I've tried some noodle bowls and entrees since my first visit. The pho ga (chicken soup with rice noodle) had a very generous amount of green onion, white and dark chicken shreds, and good-textured noodles. However, the chicken broth was extremely bland.\n\nThe pho dac biet (combo beef with rice noodle) comes with filet mignon, rare steak slices, beef balls, and tripe. The meat slices were good, not too chewy, but the meatballs were lacking, especially because they're sliced into thin sections so it looks like there's more. The beef broth lacked a bit of flavor, unfortunately.\n\nThe tiger prawns with garlic noodle is a small portion for the price paid (about $17). The noodles have a small hint of garlic, and overall didn't cut it for me. They just weren't garlicky enough. However, the star of this entree is the tiger prawns! They're huge, fresh, and covered in a crispy, delicious batter that's sweet and salty. The entree also comes with a small dish of garlic salt and pepper with lime.\n\nThe service is still very friendly and attentive.

It's okay, but could easily be much better. \n\nThe pho ga (chicken pho) is actually pretty damn decent. The meat portion is small, but the noodles are generous, and the broth has a nice solid depth. Tasty stuff. But the price is way high (something in the $9 range) for pho. The ca phe sua da is brewed a little weak on the coffee side (watery) but has plenty of condensed milk and is served up proper (mix at the table). Totally satisfied my craving. \n\nI'd come back for the pho but am not sure what else I'd try.

They ordered the standard beef pho, plus we had appetizers of spring rolls and chicken wings to share. \n\nI ordered the pho tofu/vegetable soup and happily as asked if I wanted a vegetarian broth instead of meat-based (I chose the former). Food came out pretty quick, actually overlapping the appetizers, but that was workable since we had a limited amount of time for lunch. \n\nI'm sad to say though that the vegetarian pho here is adequate at best. The broth was rather plain and weak and the main vegetables were large cuts of broccoli and bok choy, along with chunks of tofu.

If looking for good vegetarian/vegan pho or noodle soup, Ramen Underground or Loving Hut are two amazing options.\n\nI would go back here, as they have other vegetarian options in both noodle and rice dishes, and the spring rolls I had were *delicious*, but I'm sad about the pho.

We walked here in this sketchy neighbor, when Tien Tin was packed. Should have stayed there, but with a party of 11, Miss SaiGon could accommodate us, which was a plus. The restaurant is fairly large, so if you have a large party, this place is a plus. Guess I should bump them up a star for that. Oh well. Pho (#17), was ok. Broth was a little too sweet, and they served a lemon slice with it. Isn't it supposed to be lime? $10 for a bowl of Pho. A little on the pricier side, but it was OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. Shaken beef was tasty, but was $16. Again, on the sweeter side, but the potatoes and onions softened it up a bit. A little too sweet for my taste, and I like sweet. OK, but pricey for what you get (especially when I ordered it for a 6 yr old!). Also got said daughter the garlic butter noodles for $5. Thought that was a steal, but it was a pretty small plate with not much flavor or composition. Just a little pile of noodles. She didn't eat much, so $5 down the drain. Others seemed to like their entrees. Not a lot of Vietnamese people here as patrons. Bad on a Sat night. 11 people, tab came to $150 w/ tip. Actually not bad, considering most entrees were $10+.

Tonight she was working late at the new Federal Building on 7th Street and Mission.  I was hungry and wondered what was in the area, since I had parking.  She said she goes to Miss SaiGon for lunch and we could go there.\n\nMiss SaiGon is located right on the corner of 6th Street and Mission.  The neighborhood is not the best...so be smart and be aware of your surroundings.\n\nWe arrived and was seated, the place was a bit busy.  There were 3 workers at the front of the house, taking orders, serving and busing...sort of not efficient.\n\nFrom the time we were seated to when we had our order taken, was about 15 minutes...a bit long I would say.  The staff would walk by and look at us and then head off, each thinking the others were helping us.\n\nFor appetizer we ordered the small wonton soup #7 ($4.75).  You get 5 wontons in light broth with.  The broth is wonderful with some fried garlic....yummy.  The wontons were pork and shrimp...good size about the perfect size for the spoon.\n\nFor the main course she had the  Bun Rieu #28 ($9.50) - Minced crab meat in a tomato soup base with vermicelli noodles.  Nice flavor broth,,,slightly tart.  The minced crab meat appears to be suspended inside some light fish balls.  The only problem is that I do not taste any crab at all.  Should be called fish ball with vermicelli.\n\nI had the Com Suon Nuong #46 ($8.50 + $1.00 for a fried egg on top) - Crushed rice with pork chop.  First of all, I love the side veggies (pickled cabbage, shredded lettuce and carrots, sliced cucumber...all with the fish sauce poured over it).  Now for the bad news...it was not a pork chop...it was actually a single thin piece of pork (like the one they use for the grilled pork).  For $8.50, I expected at least a 1/4\" thick real pork chop or 2 of these 1/8\" thin sliced pork.\n\nBathroom time: there are a separate men's and women's room.  The men's room is only a single user one.  The room was well lit and basically clean except for the location of the trash can.  The trash can was next to the sink, which would be fine if the door was within reach.  The trash can had a lid, so people would was their hands, use the towel to dry their hands, then use the towel to unlock and open the door....now how to reach and step on the lever to left the lid of the trash can....not possible, so what would you do?

If pho is not a good litmus test for good Vietnamese, then a spring roll truly separates the men from the boys...it was decent though the rice paper was a bit chewier than I like.\n\nJamie had the $6.95 Com thit nuong bi cha, which was a couple of pieces of grilled pork, a big scoop of rice, a little zucchini and carrot salad, shredded pork and noodles, and a little egg cake (see my photo).

The restaurant is less busy around 2 PM, but patrons continue to trickle through the doors regularly.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  As soon as you are seated they bring you a slender glass of cucumber-infused ice water - so refreshing!  \n\nThe Cha Gio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kPRMsrxQhRC4NMX8Mord_A?select=w-coy2RetlBdhOzFwjPqWQ) arrived at my table no more than three minutes after the waitress had taken my order.  Accompanied by fresh lettuce, a sprig of basil, cilantro, cucumber slices and a dipping sauce the two egg rolls appeared to be pretty plump.  Wow!  These are some of the best crispy egg rolls I've had in a very long time, and surprisingly not greasy.  The rolls are overstuffed with a seasoned pork mixture, vermicelli, carrots and mushrooms.  I ate everything on the plate but the basil.  I'll be ordering this again in the future.\n\nThe Mi Xao Gion (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kPRMsrxQhRC4NMX8Mord_A?select=P2AzEPfEq6IeLCVYgW3AoQ) is loaded with tender slices of beef and chunks of chicken breast.  There were maybe four small shrimp mixed in with the broccoli, zucchini, straw mushrooms, Shanghai bok choy, carrots and snow peas served with a light sauce over a massive bed of crispy, thin, fried noodles.  Again with this dish there was surprisingly very little grease on the bottom of the plate.  The ingredients work well together and it is a very satisfying noodle dish that will leave you stuffed.\n\nI haven't tried the pho yet, but Miss SaiGon creates some excellent rice plates too.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

And by funny, I mean kinda awesome, in a really f*cked up, I wasn't even looking for awesome, awesome kind of way. \n\nMy best girlfriend got back from a recent trip to visit the man in another state and came back single. Me, being cut from the \"if she doesn't cry and doesn't broach the subject everything must be fine\" cloth, and her being from the \"don't show my feelings and pretend everything is fine cloth\", I figured we would go on as normal, pretending her four-year relationship hadn't just ended in the most mutual, heart crushing, we-really-love-each-other-but-neither-of-us-is-willing-to-leave-our-life kind of ways. \n\nBut she cried. Yeah ... the bitch went out and cried in front of me. She didn't mean to. And it wasn't really her fault. I mean, we walked into a place where \"I Remember You\" by Skid Row was playing. I mean, who could blame the little thing for letting wet stuff come out of her eyes? But me, being cut from the aforementioned cloth, panicked. \n\n\"LET ME BUY YOU DINNER!\" I screamed. \n\nI looked at her wide-eyed, silently begging her to stop with the emotions. \n\n**sniffle** \"What?\" \n\n\"LET ME BUY YOU FUCKING DINNER!\" **chicken dance chicken dance**\n\n\"Why are you doing that weird walking thing?\" **sniffle**\n\n\"I DON'T KNOW! YOU NEED FOOD! FOOD MAKES YOU HAPPY AND YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY AND I WANT TO BUY YOU HAPPY FOOD!\" **triumphant fist pump, ballerina spin**\n\n\"Uhhhh ... .okay. I mean, that sounds nice\". **wipes eyes**\n\nDid it sound nice? In retrospect, probably not. Mostly because I had just proved myself to be the creepiest of friends by squawking like an eagle and chicken dancing to make her feel better about her life. \n\nI'm fucking amazing under pressure. \n\nAnyway, we decided to try Tu Lan on 6th, as it's our favorite terrifying Asain restaurant, and we were both feeling like shoving a whole bunch of marinated meat into our mouths. So we packed our travel mugs full of wine, grabbed our cigarettes and jumped on the 9 off Potrero, headed for the TL...\n\n...Only to find Tu Lan was closed forever due to health violations, most notably the amount of \"roaches, rodents, flies and 'other animals'\" present at the famous hole-in-the-wall. \n\nI looked at my potential dinner date/hostage, \"So ... I'm cool with the first three offenders. But what in the FUCK is the 'other animals' part? I'm not cool with that. Other animals could literally be anything. I mean, is it the effing rodents of unusual size from The Princess Bride? Is it gun-wielding raccoons? We're on 6th and Market, it could seriously be winged crackheads with machetes\". \n\nShe agreed, and we walked up to a restaurant I had heard about, but had never visited due to its proximity to Tu Lan (because who gets near Tu Lan and goes somewhere else?). Turns out, this place rocks. And it's CLEAN! Like, really, creepily clean. I even braved the bathroom, folks. For real. And it was fine. \n\nWhat we got: \n\nSpring Rolls - filled to the brim with shrimp and pork\nImperial Rolls - light and flaky and almost as good as Tu Lan's\nChicken in Yellow Curry - The winner of the evening; I added broccoli to mine\nBeef with Basil and Ginger - Slightly sweet with a hint of spice; beef was excellent\n\nNOTES: \n\nThe food is all very good, and the ingredients are a step up from your normal, run-of-the-mill Vietnamese joint. But the portions are much smaller, which is to be expected, so prepare to order more than you're used to if you're looking for that family-style dinner. Also, many of the plates don't have veggies, so if you're a veggie-head like me, make sure to add some to your entree. The servers are a bit on the dick-ish side, but if you go often enough they'll eventually warm up a tiny bit, and by \"tiny bit\" I mean they might crack a smile.\n\nAnd the best part? This is one of those rare Asian cuisine joints where you don't have to wonder whether or not your immune system is going to be working overtime defending your body from food-borne illness. You know, unlike Tu Lan.", "author": "Mel H."}

Not too chewy with absolutely great flavor!  They utilized quality meat with great flavor.  The rice noodles were perfectly done.  I have to say that this is where many places go wrong; however Miss Saigon does it right!  The broth was the the best I have ever tasted, hands down.  The temperature was perfect and you can tell they know what they are doing because the taste was a perfect blend of Pho spices with the right bones for flavor.

And I even said I would like it spicy. Alas, this was not the case. My soup was like the antithesis of spicy and that was sad.\n\nHowever, I think our server noticed my frowny face because he asked if it was spicy enough for me, and when I said no he immediately brought me an assortment of goodies to throw in the bowl to up the spice ante.

What can I say, I'm daring. Came around 4pm and no one was in the restaurant, order the small 17b, which is pho with rare filet mignon, I asked for no onions, pho came out right away and the filet mignon wasn't rare which is great for me since I can't stand rare meat and I have to always let me pho sit for awhile. I also prefer the flat noodle but they only offer the rice noodle, shoot let's give it a whirl. I can say that the rice noodle was cooked nicely in this tasty broth and pho came out extra hot which instantly cooked my basil. It's Southern style pho and I was in pure bliss. And for everyone leaving remarks about coming to the TL, this isn't in the TL (Tenderloin) this is SOMA or as us people from SF like to use the OG name, South Of Market, 6th street wasn't even walkable in the day time 10 years ago.

He's recovering from a broken ankle and he was using a cane - clearly injured. There were two people working, a man and a lady, and the lady kind of ushered us in and gestured at all the empty tables - there were at least 15 open, towards the back of the restaurant. We made it halfway down the length of the restaurant - mind you, boyfriend limping and using cane - when the man rushed up and asked us to turn around, back up and sit at the table in the corner right next to the entrance, with a mannequin hovering over it. Like we had to move the table so that the mannequin's hand wasn't in between our faces. And the restaurant was empty, yet we were sitting at the table by the entrance, and every time somebody came in we got blasted with cold air and wind. The table by the entrance should only be taken as a last resort when the rest of the tables are full. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a Saigon beer and instead was brought an Export 33, which the guy argued had become the same company as Saigon or something. OK, fine. No big deal - even though you list them separately on your menu.. \n\nThe lady was very pushy. We weren't ready to order and she kept coming back to prod us and ask us to order. She also insisted I say the number of the dish. The conversation went something like this: \n-\"Can we have the summer rolls?\" \n-\"Yes, number two right?\" \n\"Yes, the summer rolls with pork.\" \n\"NUMBER TWO RIGHT?\"\n \"Um.. *flips menu back open to check on the number*\" \n\"IT'S NUMBER TWO. YOU WANT NUMBER TWO RIGHT?\" \n\"OKAY YES. NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU.\"\n\nWe got the summer rolls. They were incredibly disgusting. We both took one bite and had to stop. The sauce had no flavor, but the worst part was the meat inside. It was supposed to be shredded pork. My boyfriend asked me \"What is this supposed to be?\" He said it reminded him of dog food crumbles (we were both a little grumpy at this point).\n\nOur soup came. Boyfriend had pork wontons in his soup. Same problem with the awful \"shredded pork\". Mine was a traditional beef pho soup. The beef was old, dry, tasteless, and sometimes tasted just plain bad. I fished it all out of my soup and left it on a side plate. Couldn't eat it. The broth itself was good, so I slurped on that. Basically paid $9.50 for rice noodle soup with sprouts. \n\nAfter we'd finished, we sat for a really long time and never got the check. Finally I waved them down for the check. They brought it to us. My boyfriend put his card down. We sat for 10 minutes. They walked by our table a few times but didn't pick up the card. Finally he got up, with his cane, limped over to the counter, handed them the receipt, stood there while they ran the card, then limped back. \n\nUnbelievable. If you want Viet food in the area go to Tin's Vietnamese instead. I will never come back here.\n\nEDIT: BF woke up at 3:30 am with stabbing pains in his stomach. They're still not gone 6 hours later.", "author": "Sonya Z."}

The food here is genuinely good.  It is a little more expensive than other Vietnamese places (which is to say, it's still cheap compared with most other cuisines.  $8.25 for your typically large bowl of combination pho.)  But their broth is really good - it has that good, rich, umami flavor, that fundamental goodness that you recognize right away, with just a little bit of sweetness.  \n\nTheir pork vermicelli is really good too.  Thin slices of pork, highly seasoned and tender.  The fish sauce is properly balanced - just the right mix of salty and sweet.  \n\nAlso a fan of their shaken beef w/ garlic noodles.  Again, a little more than you'd expect to pay at a Vietnamese place ($14.95 according to their online menu, I somehow remember it as cheaper though...) but compare it to $22 at R&G $36 at Slanted Door.  Oh yes, don't mind if I do order one to go...\n\nThe cross street is seedy.  It's opposite a couple porn stores.  There's a reason why the curtains are always drawn and you kind of need to peer in to double check that they're open.  The interior is pleasant and simple.  I personally think the photos on Yelp makes it look fancier than my impression of the place, but the bias could be on my end (plus, who wants fancy here?).  Not a place to take a date you want to impress (unless being the stalwart guide between the crowds of homeless people is liable to impress them).

The law of averages dictates that some Yelpers are handing out 5 stars, which is not deserving of this place. The food is not completely dreadful, just not overwhelming. \n\nAfter maneuvering around all the drug dealers and vagrants down 6th Street, stopping only to talk to some pimps (you gotta stay up to date on the ho network; it's hard out there for a pimp) Miss Saigon appears on the corner of 6th and Mission. From the outside, it looks a little 'divey'. The interior is pretty nice although you are greeted by a mannequin (Miss Saigon, I presume) dressed in traditional Vietnamese garb (kinda freaky, maybe the mannequin is the restaurant's enforcer - this ho got this corner) \n\nFrom here is a slight downhill, between three friends, we ordered the pho ga, vermicelli bowl, seafood clay pot rice, bun rieu. I had a quick spoon of the pho broth and bun rieu and was already disappointed. Not authentic and lacking real Vietnamese flavor. My friends didn't seem to notice and were content with their soups. The vermicelli bowl is spot on; it's kinda hard to screw that up unless you undercook the noodles. The seafood clay pot rice was my dish and for the most part was pretty good. Rice was certainly crunchy from the clay pot and the amount of protein was good. My problems are the crab meat used was imitation crab and the dish was rather pricey. Considering everyone's dish was under $10, the seafood clay pot rice was $15. I was hoping that paying the premium price meant having fresh seafood. If the dish was $8, I wouldn't complain, but charging $15 is a bit much for fake crab. \n\nAll in all, not a terrible experience, but nothing to write home about either. Time to head up the Mission and set up appointments with Pimp Daddy Kane.\n\np.s. we paid cash for our bill, but noticed the waiter telling others that their Point Of Sale system was down and not taking credit cards.

How many crackheads did I pass? Don't know...lost count.\n\nOnce we got there, it was like a refuge from the craziness outside. Nicely decorated with shiny finished tables, crown moulding with a sky painted ceiling, and delicate little white porcelain pots for the soy sauce and chili. It was beautiful for a casual Vietnamese restaurant. And no smell! That was a plus.\n\nWe ordered the crab rangoon and crispy squid for appetizers. The server came out a few minutes later, said they ran out of squid and suggested we get the chicken wings, so we did. Crab rangoon was nice and crispy outside, super cheesy in the inside. It was delish! Another waiter took our appetizer plates, which threw me off because our chicken wings didn't come out yet. When our chicken wings came out, our waiter saw the puzzled look on our faces, and quickly got more plates. \n\nOur pho came out strategically right after we were done with the wings. My mom got the seafood combo with egg noodles, and my dad and I pretty much got the same thing: medium rare beef with beef balls. Simply delicious. Unlike other Pho places, they charge 6-7 dollars for a large bowl...flat rate, which I personally like. Get more bang for your buck that way. \n\nTheir cucumber water is refreshing.

Hehe.\n\nI have gone through all their soups - and with the exception of the crab meat in tomato soup base - I can vouch for all of them. When did I ever have a Pho in SF where the beef balls tasted like they were just fresh made?!\n\nSandwiches are a bargain, and almost all other dishes are absolutely excellent. You can taste the difference. I have yet to find a place that serves better dishes. To me, what Lers Ros is for Thai food in the city, Miss Saigon is for Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nJust so you're warned: Their service is slooooooooow. Even sandwiches take an eternity, and that even when the restaurant is empty. The food compensates easily for that though!\n\n\nAnd then finally (non-food related): What's up with their choice of music and TV selection?!\n\nI have seen anything like nature and wildlife documentaries, over Fiji-inspired ab workout videos, to Kung Fu Panda to a 9/11 report on their LCD screens while the background music ranges from light muzak, to karaoke arrangements or unbearable Vietnamese covers of western music. Crazy! Adds to the atmosphere? No idea. I have been shaking my head more than once in disbelief about their questionable taste while sitting there, waiting for my food. :-)\n\n(*) granted, I just looked it up, and Miss Saigon's inspection score of 69 on 03/19/2012 is not great.

I also spotted a crackhead presenting brand new high tops and DVDs to a chubby Godfather-meets-Samuel-L-Jackson-type on the street corner before getting his approval and entering his SRO together.  I also noticed some elderly Chinese ladies selling generic branded groceries they got for free (I know because I once volunteered at the food bank which packs those bags) to locals, undercutting the already cheap convenience stores.  The restaurant itself is many times nicer looking than Tu Lan, but doesn't rouse that same adventurous spirit of slumming it as duct tape covered bar stools.\n\nCha Gio: Forget all the vegetable crap in the Chinese and Thai versions of deep fried rolls, I'll stick with the meat intense Vietnamese versions.  Much larger than the mini rolls you tend to get at other Vietnamese joints, but smaller than the massive ones up the street at Tu Lan.\n\nWonton Soup: I was smooth talked into upgrading my meal into a combo which included this soup.  Looked Chinese, but had some Vietnamese aspects such as the inside of the wonton being reminiscent of the meatballs in pho.  I also appreciated the subtle black pepper broth even though I did eventually douse it with hot sauce.\n\nCrab Rangoon: They should just call this Rangoon, since I didn't notice any crab.  Still tasty since it's basically deep fried cream cheese.  Obviously inauthentic, but so are fortune cookies and I enjoy those!\n\nBo Luc Lac: The crown jewel of my meal here.  Not the filet mignon version, but still nice cuts seared on the outside and just the right amount of tenderness on the inside.  The fried potatoes were a nice a touch because when paired with the onions and excess sauce, it reminded me of my favorite Peruvian dish - lomo saltado.  Of course lomo saltado doesn't have the delicious lime, black pepper and fried garlic dipping sauce... but maybe it should?\n\nGarlic Noodle: I feel like garlic noodles is a comfort food akin to fried rice.

A while back I've got tickets to a show at the Orpheum and I've a mind to catch dinner beforehand, on the grounds that I've been told all my life that I have to eat at least semi-regularly if I don't want to die (technically, this remains untested conjecture in my particular case, but be that as it may). I have two standards: It should be cheap and non-toxic. Those are the same two standards I apply to everything, which I guess explains a lot about my life, but this really isn't the appropriate venue to interrogate that issue more closely, and besides you don't have all night. I get word that there's a really great Vietnamese place on this block. And it turns out there is: Tu Lan. But I get the directions scrambled and I end up at this *other* Vietnamese place, Miss Saigon, and assume it must be where we're looking for.\n\nA word about Sixth Street: I'm generally of the opinion that neighborhoods with bad reputations usually aren't so bad, and that their biggest crime is daring to have poor and/or non-white people living in them, thus making them less palatable to those whose picture of an ideal city looks like an issue of LIVING, but more outside. Even I know when I'm in over my head, though, and a trip down just one block of Sixth Street is enough to tell me that it's a perfectly fine and charming urban corridor for anyone who feels they've lived long enough without personal hazard already.\n\nGiven this, it's a wonder that there actually are quite a few good eateries here, and after a while I decided I'd figured out how they stay in business: When you find yourself walking down Sixth Street, your lower brain seizes your motor controls and makes it Priority Number Now to get anywhere else. The closest doorway possessing more illumination than a birthday candle becomes a very attractive destination and you're inside before your conscious mind even registers what's happened. At which point you might as well stop and have a bite to eat while you mentally reconnoiter where you are and, depending on how rough the trip was, who you are.\n\nAll this is just a preamble to letting you know that if you possess the five basic senses that are sufficient to keep most people far, far away from the 100 block of Sixth (lacking unusually pressing business and/or the reassuring accompaniment of a flamethrower), you're missing out. This little place has a nice staff, affordable prices (even for me, a man who is one tax bracket away from having to rent his pants on a week-to-week rate), and really, really tasty cuisine. I don't know how they do it. When we hear self-serving homilies about risk-taking entrepreneurs it's usually in reference to some kind of Wall Street hoodoo that magically turns someone else's foreclosure into your vacation in Dubai, but if you ask me the people behind Miss Saigon are the real courageous pioneers in this economy. Beautiful place. Hope we see more like it around here someday.", "author": "Tam Lin J."}

I stumbled upon Miss Saigon before a Yelp Elite event because I was too cold to walk elsewhere. \n\nFood was meh. I've definitely experienced better, but I was RAVENOUS, so it tasted like a 3-star at the time. It wasn't so terrible that I'd spit out my food, but I just wasn't very impressed.

I was debating (in my head, I swear.) spicy pho or vermicelli bowl, but it was kind of hot so I ordered (tried to) the vermicelli. I just said the number cause I can't pronounce any of that Vietnamese, and the guy said it back to me it sounded like the number... but then he asked me about the spiciness level and I should have asked about that because the vermicelli I ordered didn't have anything that typically is spicy. But whatever.  Anyway, what I got was a bowl of spicy seafood pho with egg noodles. I looked and was like... THIS IS FULL OF EVERYTHING I LOVE. HOW DID YOU KNOW?!! and dug in. It was so yummy. I didn't even know that was something I could order. I saw the spicy beef pho, but didn't know there was a seafood option. Also, I like egg noodles more than vermicelli. They basically pulled out the perfect dish for me despite myself.

No matter the time of day: at dawn, mid afternoon, or at any given hour in the middle of the night, you're likely to see several fine folks out for a pleasant stroll. This is where the elite of San Francisco society come to play. \n\nKidding!! Jokes aside, Miss SaiGon is in a very run down, depressing part of the city. It's more or less safe during the day, but at night things get a little seedier. There's always a number of characters milling about, but they pretty much ignore passersby, save for the occasional aggressive panhandler. If you're not overly sensitive to that kind of thing, though, what you'll get with Miss SaiGon is a decent little Vietnamese restaurant that has dozens and dozens of respectable dishes at affordable prices. The staff is friendly, the service is fast, and they do a good enough job of keeping things clean. The Pho is average to slightly above average, and in general, the ingredients they use for their dishes seem fresh and of moderately good quality.\n\nGo there if you're craving cheap Vietnamese food and you're not intimidated by the surroundings.", "author": "Don W."}

Everything was good, though my favorites were the chicken salad and tiger prawns.  \n\nService was surprisingly good for such a large group - my cucumber water was refilled in a timely manner, and the food kept coming and coming!", "author": "Cathy Y."}

I like the broth and the price is just right. I've tried other dishes here and they've been fairly good as well.\n\nLately, I've noticed that the quality of the beef in the Pho has gone down significantly. It used to be nice and tender. Now it's tough and chewy. I thought it was a fluke the first time, but it's been the norm the past few times I've tried it.\n\nAlso, the noodles aren't the same as they used to be. Before they were nice and soft, now they are too tough (almost al dente). This combined with the toughness of the meat makes for a very difficult chewing situation. My jaw started to hurt after a while :(\n\nI also want to ad that the spring rolls are a total ripoff. It's mostly lettuce and they slice the cooked shrimp so thin that you literally get one piece of shrimp thinly sliced across a very thick spring roll stuffed with lettuce.

For some reason the same dish of Shrimp with Asparagus in Chili sauce was very different than the one I had 4 days ago.  The previous dish had much more shrimp than the one tonight and was cheaper at $10.95 versus $11.95 tonight.  The most disappointing thing was the way they served the dish with the rice and 2 fried wontons(stuffed with ricotta cheese or something) on one plate versus the previous when they brought a whole dish of the stir fried shrimp and then the rice.  It just looked like a \"lunch special\" shrimp dish and at $11.95 it shouldn't. I am disappointed that they are going this route.  I know they have to make money, however before the dish looked very special like a true restaurant and meticulously prepared.  The one plate special tonight just gave me a very bad taste in my mouth.

When you order a certain type of soup or stew, they ask you if you'd like rice noodles or egg noodles. I chose egg noodles and it was magnificent! The broth was thick and dark. The meat falls right off the bone and you can tell that the stew has been simmering for SEVERAL hours and the meat just breaks down. Unfortunately, I don't think the cooker stirred the stew before putting it in my bowl because all I got was a few carrots and mostly fat. The meat fell off the bone and must be in the bottom of the pot. I also ordered Ca Phe Sua Da, and like all, or MOST Vietnamese restaurants, they hand it to you with a glass of ice (here, it's a wine glass) and a regular glass with condense milk at the bottom of the glass and the Phin with the Vietnamese/French roasted grinds and hot water. Let it drip, mix it up with the given spoon, and pour it over the ice. So elegant! On top of that, the Cha Gio was nice and crispy. You can tell it just came out of the fryer because of how flaky it was and crispiness. You get 2 with a side of fresh herbs and Nuoc Mam.

When you walk inside, you are surprised to find a pleasantly decorated restaurant that is nice and clean.  \n\nThe bf ordered a lunch special and I hadn't had pho in a while.  The menu is huge with a wide selection of items with photos.  It was disappointing to only find 3 different phos, when they were advertising pho on their awning outside.  I ordered the rare beef with meatballs.  First the broth wasn't hot enough to cook the bean sprouts.  The broth was nice and light, I think a little too diluted though.  The pho or noodles themselves were horrible, which is sad since I love my noodles.  They had a rough texture to it.  The meatballs were the authentic kind with the tendons and stuff in it.  What can I say, I'm an ABC I like it with just the meat.  \n\nThe BF wasn't impressed with his lunch either.  The lunch special comes with the soup of the day, which was hot and sour soup Vietnamese style, crab rangoon, and fried rice.  The soup was interesting, not spicy but sour like the Chinese hot and sour soup without the hot.  Anyways, it was OK.  The BF complained that the beef on the menu didn't specify what kind, which was short ribs that day.  He said that it was really fatty.\n\nI don't know what people were talking about cheap.  The prices were decent, but I wouldn't call them cheap.  I guess I'm use to eating in Chinatown where it's cheaper and a lot better.  Granted, they give you a nice big bowl, but it wasn't good enough to want to finish.  Overall, If I was in the area and I needed a place to eat, I might try it again (something different, the boba smoothies looked good) but I wouldn't go there to eat there.

And I just kept thinking about those issues, so had to write a review.  Oh, Yelp, let's you and I work this shit out... together.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, it ain't all problems--these folks have put together a clean and attractive place to eat.  The big windows fill the space with clean light, the glossy dark wood tables are attractive--it really does feel like you've stumbled through a wardrobe into a much better place than where you were before (i.e. shoving your way through crackheads, drug-dealers, and babbling psychotics).\n\nOh!  Their coffee was excellent.  And they do the condensed milk in a glass with the coffee dripping into it from the little suspended pot.  I fucking love that, and they are the only place I've been other than http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-84-oakland who does it.\n\nI had a bit of three different items.  Their chicken salad was just fine--nothing spectacular, just shredded cabbage and carrots and bean sprouts and some chicken in a thin, sweet sauce.  Haven't ever had bad chicken salad in a SE Asian joint, I don't think (the one at http://www.yelp.com/biz/phnom-penh-house-oakland-3#hrid:TGw0Re5m8c3LHn7PQ89DFQ/src:search/query:phnom%20phen is in a class of its own in awesomeness, however).\n\nMy lunch date, Jane C., got what I would have assumed was pho, except for the big, fat noodles they used.  They were indeed rice noodles, but they looked like fat spaghetti--not udon-size, but opaque, white noodles.  No translucency, no gloss, nothing like the usual glass-like vermicellli.  Maybe I'm just culturally retarded and Vietnamese connoisseurs are all about the fat noodles, but to me, that's \"incorrect.\"  And the broth... weak.  Salty enough, but a real pho broth is complex--we're talking 20 pound ox bones simmered for two days complex, like over at http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-anh-dao-oakland.  This could very well have been derived from boullion, and I *know* that's not traditional.\n\nAnd finally, this might seem like nit-picking, but we got the banana cake.\n\nNow, looking at the banana cake's photo on the menu, you see a very attractive, two-layer slice of cake, probably made of two cake rounds of angel food with a browned, glossy filling spread across the top and between the layers--and the spread has clearly defined slices of banana in it.  We weren't sure what to expect, after all it could just be angel food cake with some banana shit smeared on it, or there could be some kind of flavor marriage that would make us cream in our jeans, but that's what experimentation is all about, right?  It looked great, is the point.\n\nWhen the \"cake\" came out, however, it was this round, flat little brown and grey splatter of a confection.  I mean, it tasted okay (like sweetened and baked banana), but what made this a cake?  It was a baked smear!  Your food's gotta at least *resemble* the menu, I mean, come on.\n\nThere were some other disappointments (what was that shredded brown stuff with the soup?  my vote was oxidized radish--bleah), but you get the picture.\n\nReally, I think this was a two-star meal, but I've heard fair-to-good reviews from friends about this place, including from Jane C herself, and I'm open to visiting again--maybe a basic meat + rice dish will move them into my good graces.

Also, the portion size was a bit smaller than Perilla's pile of noodles, but I suppose I'm spoiled by their largesse.\n\nThe dish plus hot tea (teapot of Jasmine for $1) came to ~$20 - spendy given the neighborhood, but reasonable given the quality of my meal.

It was dry, hard, overly cooked and disgusting. Brisket was OK. That's a combo? Meatballs, shitty steak and brisket? What a ripoff. Now onto the broth. At first sip I thought ok, they get a 2. Then the more I ate, the more disgusting it got. The broth had no depth, no beef flavor, bland and not savory, rich and buttery at all. On top of that, they was way too much rock sugar and after a few bites, you feel like you're drinking sugar water.

AllSTAR has better pho, no contest.\n\nBut... I have to admit Miss SaiGon has grown on me. They have what basically every other TL/SoMa pho place lacks: some kind of atmosphere. It's all clean and stuff. And there's a little waterfall when you walk in. The TVs that constantly play that stupid penguin surfing movie (like penguins could surf, whatever,) I could do without, but at least they keep them muted and play nice music. Sort of melancholy music. I've heard Moon River like 4 times there.\n\nI like Miss SaiGon. You should go there. Especially before a movie, with a date who you don't really want to spend a lot of money on.\n\nUpdate: I added a star. Miss Saigon has really grown on me.\n\nUpdated again: I've been going here frequently for a year now and these guys are awesome. They're always super friendly and sometimes randomly give us free desserts. I want to add one more star, but honestly I get the same thing every time I go there (rare beef pho and a Tiger) so I can't really tell you if the whole menu lives up.

Definitely a safe haven from the derelict surroundings of 6th, and  just what you expect it to be, cheap, solid and delicious Vietnamese.\n\nThe owners have clearly put in a bit of effort in this place, (ok, so they couldn't resist the tacky chairs and mannequin at the entrance who I actually, genuinely no kidding-- thought was real from the outside) but its a cute set up, with plants and pictures and cartoons playing in the background and they've stuck little dried leaves and flowers in their plastic menus which I think is just so adorable. (Oh and the menu also has photos which ALWAYS help!)\n\nOur server was super attentive, friendly and we were always topped up with their cucumber water. We ordered fried rice, (wasn't feeling like pho) and stir fried green bean and egg. The rice was perfect, tasty, not too oily and good chunks of beef through it. The green bean-- delicious and I thought my mum's was good! To top it off, I asked for some chilly and low and behold our server brings out 3 different kinds of chilli-- now THAT'S what I call good service!\n\nOverall, super impressed, both meals were under $10 and even cheaper of you are here for lunch.

But seeing as she makes it like once every 4-5 months, I'm started on a mission to find decent and cheap pho places. \n\nAnd so it begins with Miss Saigon. Introduced to me by my co-workers (Hi Greg!) at exactly the wrong time (on a diet + 3 days before payday = no going out if I can help it), I reminded myself of the pho goal and how I haven't actually STARTED said goal. And that pho is generally cheap so I GUESS I can go.\n\nSo glad I did though. Large portions for cheap and happily clean and not scary for 6th street! The spring rolls had peanut sauce that I WANT TO BATHE IN so some of the awesomeness might rub off by osmosis. The pho was very good and now I feel like I have a solid baseline for what is acceptable when I go out. But never fear, I will be filling you in when I find one that is comparable to Hang's pho. \n\nOne warning I will give is that if you can't stand 80's easy listening, get your stuff to go if you can.

It's located on a semi-sketchy corner of SOMA/TL so I applaud the folks for opening up what looks to be a somewhat upscale Vietnamese restaurant.\n\nSo opening night, there were just 2 or 3 other occupied tables. Everything was brand spanking new. Plusher chairs, shellacked tables, and smell of new paint. High ceilings give this place a very airy bright feel, as does the panel of green wall. Not exactly an impressive space. More like a simple neighborhood eatery.\n\nSo we had the Spring Rolls (2 for $3.25). They were fresh but a little skimpy with just 1 shrimp and 1 slice of pork per roll.\n\nThen we had #25 Bun bo hue ($6.25) which had spicy beef and pork. It was peppery hot with a nice clear broth. What was different about this noodle soup was that it was served with more than just bean sprouts. The raw veggies were a combo basil, cabbage and sprouts. Different. My companion didn't think the Bun Bo Hue was authentic enough though, since it was missing pork blood and hock. (Honestly, I'm happy they left those parts out.)\n\nAlso tried the Bo Lu Lac ($7.95). Served with rice and a dry pepper salt dip. The beef was tender and interestingly served with little bits of potato and onion. It was good but I was craving a little more sauce to it.\n\nThe management was kind and gave us free dessert to complete the meal - Che Thai, which was a mix of fruits in coconut milk. Actually quite tasty and the green and white jello things gave chew to the dessert.\n\nSeems like if you live around the area, a great take out option.

As part of the ongoing gentrification of SOMA, I was actually surprised the owners agreed to take part in establishing their jewel in the heart of 6th Street.  Luckily, their vision seemed to have been carried out relatively well without cutting costs and/or lowering standards.  The interior is pleasant and the artwork is appealing in a conventional sense.\n\nOriginally I thought, \"oh hell yeah, a dive Pho place!\"  Little did I know that their menu extends well beyond the tried-and-true bowl of Pho Bo (beef noodle soup).  They have quite a selection of traditional and unique Viet dishes, most of which sound and look interesting (their menus have fun little pictures of them as well).\n\nThe service was extremely nice and attentive.  Unfortunately, they did not have the simple Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) which disappointed me.  The waiter told me they might have it in the future so I'll be waiting patiently.  I mean, sometimes you just want a nice big bowl of chicken noodle soup, y'know what I mean?  Shoot...\n\nTheir springs rolls were small and didn't have as much meat as I wanted to believe.  They were also filled with too much cabbage/lettuce and not enough vermicelli noodles.  Perhaps if the rolls were a bit bigger, I wouldn't have minded.\n\nA big problem that I've found in this city is that the Vietnamese restaurants don't stick to the more authentic recipes.  For example, I love my spicy Bun bo hue soups with AUTHENTIC pork blood and hock.  Damn, I miss those things... makes me want to go back to San Diego of all places.  I was really hoping Miss SaiGon's Bun bo hue would be different but alas, I should have given up hope before I ventured out north... sigh...\n\nThrough the thick of it all, I believe Miss SaiGon has the foundations for something special in this neighborhood -- MY neighborhood.  I'll definitely be going back on a weekly basis since it's so convenient now (I live on the same block -- no, NOT 6th street).\n\nCan't wait to try their other \"Dinner\" dishes.  Also looking forward to trying their interesting desserts.\n\nMiss SaiGon, I welcome you to SOMA!", "author": "Eric L."}

The decor inside helps out due to 6th street grungy run down look but the area has change lil by lil so this restaurant is a nice help to the area. The managers always have small chit chat with me each time I go there and extremely friendly and always offer me water and a dessert while I get my food to go. \n\nFood:\nSo I usually get one of the pho dishes or the vermicelli dishes here. The pho bowls are always hot and large so you'll leave full and the bowls are only about 7-8 bucks each which is the normal price in the city from what I've seen. The vermicelli dishes are great for when you want something light yet fulling. Especially for hot days and your not in the mood for a burger or pizza, this is a nice treat to cool you down. The food is always freshly prepared and its amazing how quick they get the food out to you.\n\nService:\nQuick and efficient. Staff is always observant making sure your not missing anything and dont roll their eyes if you need something like other restaurants and shops on 6th street. Staff actually smiles here and are sincere when they say thank you. Nice casual feel where you are there to enjoy your meal rather then stuff it down your throat, give them your money and leave. \n\nOverall: Love this place, I used to go 2 Tu Lan all the time and just tried to ignore the smell, bums, rude workers,  or view cause their pho was great and cheap! But now that Miss Saigon opened up, I can sit down and relax without being asked for a cigerette or a quarter. Great owner and staff. Fast food. And cheap!!!

The restaurant is spotless, service very friendly, and the food is delicious and fresh.  It's difficult with California ingredients to get most of the unique taste of the food I had in Vietnam a few years ago, but this comes close enough.  One thing to try is the salmon dinner plate, served with garlic noodles.  This is as good as anything served at the Slanted Door, where it would be twice the price.  Everything here compares well with Bodega Bistro, one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, although the style is quite different.\n\nThe downside is the neighborhood.  Some of the sights and smells on the street make you wonder about the place a few doors down selling hot dogs.  You don't walk out and take that leisurely stroll down the street to Muni, you move quickly and don't look around.  It's better at lunchtime, but it's still not a great location.  The location probably does help to keep the prices down.\n\nUpdate - Two more lunch visits and a dinner visit, this place is just as good as the first time.

The 3 1/2 stars on here at the time were enough for me to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.\n\nWhile the neighborhood isn't the friendliest, I was able to find parking right outside, and by the time I sat down I nearly forgot about the 3 dudes outside who looked like they were going to urinate on my ride (but I took a seat by the window just incase).\n\nFor better or worse, this place doesn't have much character, but I'm not sure I'd expect that from this type of a restaurant. It's clean, the food is great, and the service is nothing to complain about. They also seem to have quite the collection of popular 60's and 70's tunes recorded in cheap karaoke/muzak style. Mixed into our conversation throughout dinner was a little Name That Tune as we were shouting out \"Yesterday!\" \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin!\" \"Girl From Ipanema!\"", "author": "C P."}

It's really just 2 blocks away from the Westfield Shopping Center, but oh my, what a difference...I went there for lunch in daylight and was still a bit spooked. \n\nThe place was busy but not packed. I could have had a table if I wanted, but chose to order takeout instead. The staff is super friendly: took my order right away and gave me a glass of of water with a slice of cucumber to quench my thirst while I was waiting. I ordered #26, the crab noodle soup. It came bagged and ready to go in less than 5 minutes! \n\nI devoured the meal once I got back to the office. I was glad that they knew how to pack the noddles and soup so that it didn't spill and stayed hot. The soup had good flavor and the portion was generous. My tummy was satisfied. \n\nI'd go to Miss Saigon again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to dine there.", "author": "Ava C."}

I think it is the best Vietnamese food outside of Little Saigon, Turtle Tower to be specific. If you think about it in SOMA there isn't a place that is open at night, that serves Vietnamese food where you can get a lot of food for 22 bucks. \n\nI had the shaking beef with the garlic noodles for the first time tonight and yes I was impressed. I have had a number of different dishes from this fine establishment and I am a regular. I have been a regular for about a year now. \n\nIf you know anything about the immediate neighborhood where this place is located, then you will appreciate this story. This place is right smack in the middle of the SOMA-LOIN. The SOMA-LOIN is a very diverse and eclectic neighborhood. There are many entrepreneurs walking down the street. Some ask you for change, some ask you if you want a date (but a date means you have to have money) and some ask you if you would like to procure some crack rock. I would estimate that most in the neighborhood are self employed. \n\nMy wife is a small Asian girl from Taipei, Taiwan, who moved here about 4 years ago. If you've been to Taiwan then you know that places like the SOMA-LOIN don't really exist there. \n\nBack to the story. It was the first time we ordered there for take out. Parking is a bitch in that neighborhood so I double parked and she ran in to pick up the food and pay. I guess we were a little bit early because the food wasn't ready yet. While she was waiting a couple of entrepreneurs, (the kind that ask men for \"dates\") walked in and asked to use the bathroom. The proprietor said \"No. Bathrooms for customers only.\" The wonderful ladies shouted expletives and then proceeded to steal the jar of free candies, that are provided as an after dinner thank you for patrons, and ran off. Oh, and before they left they had enough class to return the candies by throwing them on the ground, they kept the jar though. \n\nBeing from Taipei my wife was a little shocked, as this type of behavior is not really feasible in Taiwan. If you have been, then you know what I'm talking about. The proprietor gave my wife our food after all this happened and my wife said \"Thank you. Do you deliver?\" To which proprietor said \"Yes, we will deliver for you.\" \n\nNow we are regulars. We have called since and asked for delivery but they always say they are too busy. They don't really deliver. I think the guy saw the expression on my wife's face after the above altercation and would have said anything at that time, for damage control. \n\nYou gotta like that about a business like this. Taking a part of the city that for so many is home for the American nightmare, and turning their little corner into their own part of the American dream.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

The pork was delicious and everything else was exactly what I would expect in a bun We also got the summer rolls with roast pork an shrimp. Yum. My Bf and I were fighting over the sauce. He also got the bun but with beef. It was good but he really wanted my egg rolls. I am a good boyfriend but it wasn't easy as those egg rolls were so good. They were a little to skimpy with the meat and egg rolls though.  What really makes for the experience is the owners. This was our first time here but we felt like regulars. The waiter/ owner  went out of his way to make conversation with everyone.  There were 5 tables around us and he had something different to say to each and every one of them. He was so nice.

The crab rangoon appetizer with spicy lemon dipping sauce is also fantastic, and the menu prices are way, way more than fair.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-26", "description": "This is a long story but indulge me, please. \n\nSo in planning our trip to San Francisco from NC, I was desperately seeking Vietnamese food. Dave K., my SF Yelp friend, steered me in the direction of several seemingly good choices. If we had had more time, I'm sure we would have tried more than one of his suggestions. But we didn't, so I had to choose. Once I finally figured out where we'd be located and how mass transit works in SF, I decided on Miss SaiGon, the one closest to where Dave lives. (I was looking for you, D.)\n\nTurns out, my idea for Vietnamese would happen with a group of 9 after our tour to Alcatraz on July 29. Two in the party (parents of our friends) were a bit nervous about it as they had seen plenty of greasy spoons in Chinatown and weren't up for that type of gastronomical experience. I tried to explain how different the cuisines were, but honestly, I had no idea if they would like it. \n\nWe ended up hopping on a bus to get us closer to SOMA. That's when things got crazy. An older Asian woman on the bus saw me analyzing the map trying to figure out where we were going and asked if she could help (which was very nice of her I might add). I told her we wanted to go to Miss Saigon on 6th Street, between Minna and Mission. She said, \"That's not a very good part of town.\" Well, Dave and the others warned me about the Tenderloin, but I've been in bad parts of town in DC, NY, London, Boston, Dallas and I wasn't all that worried. But the older couple overheard, and they WERE WORRIED. Terrified, is more like it. As we exited the bus and started walking toward the restaurant, they announced, \"we aren't going, we'll meet you later.\" Then my friend (their daughter) got all upset and said, \"I'll stay with you.\" Then her husband got ticked off and said, \"No way, we're not separating, we're all eating together.\" But the older couple was pretty adamant that they weren't going to eat bad food in a bad area where people are killing each other and who knows what else. \n\nWell I don't know how it happened but next thing you know they decide they'll take a look and if it looks \"OK\" they will stay. And wouldn't you know, we arrived at Miss SaiGon and found a lovely, clean restaurant with waiters happy to serve us. Everyone stayed.\n\nAnd I for one am glad they did. Not that I would have left, but the fact is EVERYONE was happy with the choice. Days later, the older couple kept telling me how good the food was and how funny it was that the lady on the bus didn't phase me because I was determined to get my food, blah, blah, blah.\n\nOkay, so the review. The restaurant is tastefully decorated in a contemporary motif - I enjoyed the video on the wall of whales and dolphins. The wait staff was attentive and helpful - they seemed genuinely delighted to serve us. (Not like a place across from Oriental Pearl that I don't know the name of but it was a dump and the wait staff stood around us watching us eat and made us very uncomfortable.)\n\nWe had a green papaya salad that was DELICIOUS. My kids got spring rolls and they were fresh and tasty. The pho was very good, not the best I've ever had but it hit the spot. I had a delicious barbecue pork Bun. Everything was fresh and well presented. Someone had shaking beef and was so impressed he was talking about trying to recreate it at home. \n\nOh, and as for the area, like I said, I know bad areas and this was not a bad area. Granted we were there before dark and left maybe before things go sour. I dunno. My husband, who was facing the door, said he saw a couple of guys smoke a doobie and saw a woman who looked like she was working the streets. Still, don't let that keep you away from good food.", "author": "Pamela D."}

This place is very good.  I've never left feeling anything but satisfied.  There tends to be a bit of a line a lunchtime, but once you get a table you'll find the staff is very efficient and the food choices are abundant.  My personal favorites are the egg and shrimp, the garlic noodles and the crab rangoon, but the Pho is popular as are other traditional Vietnamese dishes.\n\nThe owner, Chi, is at the restaurant all the time and is very gracious and welcoming.  The staff really make you feel at home.  Don't be turned off by the reviews that trash the neighborhood.  It's really not that bad.  And, in any case, the environment inside Miss Saigon is very pleasant.\n\nKeep up the great work, Miss Saigon!", "author": "Mike G."}

But I want the healthier alternative, so I take the punishment.\n\n2. The horrible music. They play some kind of muzak or something that is hideous.

So I wasn't feeling too well and I was craving for some beef stew with noodles for lunch. I happened to come across their menu at the http://eat24hour.com. I decided to submit an order and entered a pick up time at 2:10pm. The place is 10 mins walking distance and when I got to the place, I told them I'm picking up an order (gave them my name) lady just gave me a bag of food and say thank you. I almost walked away with the food and realize I have not paid and the food was too small for a soup. I turned back and made sure it was my food that Im taking with me and of course pay them since I entered on the computer I was paying cash.\n\nI told them this isn't my food and I haven't  paid yet. Now for some odd reason they keep asking me if I called them which I told her repeatedly I ordered online. I was starting to get annoying with the lady who keeps insisting that I called. I told the lady one last time I ordered my food online and I was picking up a beef stew.  Lady turned around and look in the pile of online orders that was in the sink ( I don't know why they would have their online orders on the sink....weird). Now the lady told me it wasn't ready and it will take a minute for them to make. I told them fine, but I was not to happy to be waiting since my order should have been ready.  I waited 10-15 min and which this is why I like ordering things before coming to a place when I'm on lunch. My whole order was $8 including tax and she decided to charge me $8 with another tax on top of it. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? DIDNT HAVE MY FOOD READY AND NOW YOUR OVER CHARGING ME?? Im not mad the fact she double tax me, its more like the princple of having my food ready and for me to enjoy my lunch.  I would not be ordering food from this place again.  My food was not even GOOD like what this people been raving ABOUT. I would give them 1 star, 1 star for their cloud ceiling!!!!!", "author": "Marie V."}

They've been saying that about 6th St since the day I moved here, and it still looks the same to me.  In fact, the only nabes that seem to change are the nice family-friendly, middle-class (for San Francisco, anyway) areas that grow ever more upscale--hello, West Noe (er, Portal).  Anyway, just a heads up that the aesthetically sensitive might want to approach this place via Mission St.\n\nOnce you're here, you'll find an improbably bright and clean interior, with improbably cheery, eager-to-please employees.  They're also going for broke price-wise--with the exception of the dinner specials, the numbers on the menu look very 5 years ago.  In short, they're doing everything they can to draw business in spite of the surroundings, and judging by the full tables, they're succeeding.  Of course, a true foodie will follow a good meal to the gates of...well, certainly a much worse place than 6th St.  The important question is, how's the food?  Aside from the Thai Iced Tea (serves me right for ordering it in a Vietnamese place), not bad at all, from the surprisingly large \"pancake\" appetizer (more omelet-like than the Korean variety) to the clay pot of sweetly succulent catfish.  I'll have to come back for the pho and dinner specials to truly judge it, though.  Hopefully they survive here long enough.

The first thing you notice is how clean the tables are, then the tall high ceiling, nice soothing music and the server(owner?) helping us with a big smile. We felt totally welcomed.  On top of that you can kinda see the kitchen, at least you can see what goes into your food.\nMy family all enjoyed their dish; except me, I had to change to a different dish that I ended up cleaning the plate.  They tend to not use breast white chicken meat, but dark meat, I think it is a cultural preference. \n\nI really like the little details, such water comes with cucumber, the menu has dried flowers underneath photo album. One of the soup comes with 3 quail eggs, not one. All the attention to detail made me fell for this place.  I only tried two dishes. Papaya salad comes with nice tofu. A bit sweet, you can ask them to make it less sweet. I had the soup with quail eggs, asked them to take out pork, and substitute tofu. They offered me more shrimp, I settle for more tofu as I was not craving so much meat. \n\nI will go back to try more.

I walked in at 11:50am right before it got crowded. There were three of the 2-seat tables available, but the lady told me to wait for 5~10 minutes because they were expecting people with reservations. So I sat myself at the counter and browsed the menu. When people started rolling in, they put two of the tables together to sit a 4-person group, and then 10 minutes later, they sat a guy at the remaining  table. Up to this point it was fine because I was assuming that they all \"reserved\" the tables. However, when one table opened up, they sat a couple that came in later than I did. Realizing this too late, and not wanting to go up to the already-seated customers and ask them to move, I decided to leave. They did take my order 10 minutes into my walk-in, but half an hour has already past at the point of my walk-out. And the food wasn't ready for me either.\n\nTo sum up: very clean, servers polite upfront, seems popular. But I did not appreciate how they ran their business.

I went to Miss Saigon for the first time on 10.20.08 despite of bad reviews from my Vietnamese friends.  The experience really confirms that VIETNAMESE PEOPLE ALWAYS COMPLAIN, NO MATTER WHAT!  You have to come to restaurant to see for yourself!  I really enjoyed my food at Miss Saigon.  The papaya salad with dried beef was excellent and authentic.  My broken rice dish with barbecued pork, shredded pork and egg cake was so delicious.  I will definitely come back and highly recommend the restaurant to all my friends.  Despite the location, the interior of the restaurant is the charming, clean and sweet with relaxing and nice decors.  The service is very attentive and sweet.  The price is totally affordable.  The tableware is so beautiful and elegant.  You can take your date here every day!", "author": "Sunny H."}

It's reasonably priced and has a very attentive staff. Last night we ordered a filet mignon dish that was absolutely delicious, and for lunch specials we always get pho and it's always great. One thing that we keep coming back for over and over and over: they have the BEST coconut smoothies in the world. Seriously. If you order it, first you get a glass of the coconut juice, and then you get the coconut meat in a separate glass, all blended into a smoothie. You can then drink them separately, or drink the coconut meat one and then slowly pour in the juice to mix them together. Either way, you get a whole coconut every time!

We eat Viet all the time, mostly in the South Bay at local Pho places, on the weekends at \"Kevins Noodle House, 1/2 block off of 19th avenue on Irving\" and sometimes for fancy Viet-fusion.  Trying to get as much in as possible before a first trip to Vietnam this December 2009.  \nOne of my offices is 5th &amp; Mission so it's an \"interesting\" walk up Mission to land at Miss Saigon, but worth the trip.\nMiss Saigon is a great lunch spot, with above average service, amenities and really good quality. The seafood pho I had today was much higher quality than our usual haunts.  My friend had a repeat lunch special, which looked like beef sirloin, crunch won-ton types and noodles, that came with a side soup.  We also shared the shrimp rolls (fresh, not fried) which were great.\nROI is good, about $8-10 for standard lunch. \nWill keep this on the list for lunch spots and it has risen in the queue now.", "author": "Nancy N."}

I got veggies and tofu.  The veggies were so freezer burned that the zuchinni was transparent and slimy, and the broccoli florets looked like melted plastic.  The tofu was cooked in rancid oil, I kid you not.  I was on lunch from work and needed fuel, so I dosed it up with hot sauce and lots of white rice and swallowed the tofu, but the veggies were just too gross to consume.  Never.

I'm not gonna lie, I didn't expect much based on the location alone.  However, after walking in I was pleasantly surprised.  The space itself is bright and clean (did not expect that on 6th street).  It was also packed!  So far, so good.  I had a hard time deciding between #26 (noodle soup with tofu and vegetables) and #61 (golden tofu with eggplant in black bean sauce).  Since it was kind of a cold, dreary day I went with the soup.  My boyfriend went with #55 which he called \"the best shit ever\".. and it is indeed some pretty good shit.  My soup was good.. filling and pretty tasty but needed a lot of sriracha for more flavor.  I would definitely go back for the dish my boyfriend got though.  As a vegetarian I feel that I usually find a lot of tofu dishes bland but this one definitely stood out.  Very flavorful and the tofu was perfect.  The service was okay.  Not horrible but not the best.  Overall I was pretty satisfied and will definitely go back.", "author": "Kristin P."}

Second, it's prepared with ingredients that you'd expect at a much more expensive restaurant, yet, somehow, they manage to keep their prices cheap.  Third, the portion sizes are large.

I had their Beef Short Rib Lunch Special which was around $9. It included soup, 2 Crab Rangoons, Kim Chi, Rice, and 3 pieces of the Beef Short Ribs.  It was all very delicious.  \n\nThe soup is similar to the Thai's Tom Yum Soup.  The Crab Rangoon is made with Won Ton wrapper stuffed with Cream Cheese and Crab Meat then deep fried.  The Short Ribs were very tasty and was cooked just right.  It was not tough.  It also came with a dipping sauce made of  sweet vinegar and fish sauce.  For dessert I had their Flan which was also delicious and reasonably priced at $3. For drinks I ordered the Jasmine Ice Tea for $1.  \n\nI will definitely be going back to try their Garlic Noodles and Shrimp stir fried in Butter, Garlic, and Eggs.    \n\nService was very good.  They made sure my water glass was full and they also refilled by Ice Tea.  They also wrapped the other 1/2 of my flan which I could not finish because I was stuffed.  \n\nI have only have one little complaint and that was the soup was not as hot as I would have liked it.   Other customers may find the soup hot enough for them.", "author": "R H."}

They don't throw in the sliced beef too late, the serving is generous and fragrant, and it isn't 3/4 soggy noodles.  It's the perfect contrast to Tu Lan down the street if you want a refuge from the 'hood rather than the full-on greasy spoon flavored-experience.  \n\nThe cheesy music and beauty-pageant tv programs they play may not be your thing, but I've come to see it as a part of my pho experience.

The soft green tones on the walls and the waterfall makes it refreshing right from the start.\nEven though they were busy for lunch, we had no trouble finding a table. We started with the pork spring rolls which were quite bountiful in their flavor and their freshness. The mint added the perfect touch to the spiciness of the tamarind sauce served on the side.\nWe followed that with the Pho Ga which is rice noodles with chunks of free range chicken. I have to admit the broth was way too plentiful, but the basil, bean sprouts, and the jalape\u00f1o peppers that come on the side made it more balanced and  fresh. The chicken was tender and the noodles were cooked just right.\nThe service was excellent and there was no worry about being rushed out of the place even though they were busy.

There's nothing especially inviting about the storefront to suggest otherwise (in fact, the mannequin lurking just inside the door is straight up freaky), so despite living less than a hundred feet away, I'd never really given Miss SaiGon the chance until about a month ago. I was as pleasantly surprised by the food as I was horrified by the atmosphere of the place. The Pho was tasty, cheap, and plentiful, but eating at Miss SaiGon feels like being stuck in an avant garde installation piece;  a handful of flatscreens looped videos of fish as keyboard constructed bossa nova Elvis covers drifted eerily through the restaurant. It was like I had been trapped in a circle of hell that served damn decent Vietnamese food, a contradiction that I've yet to come to terms with after repeated visits.", "author": "Cooper B."}

We were welcomed with a friendly staff and what appeared to be a nice ambiance of cleanliness and open tables which meant we beat the lunch crowd (we arrived before noon). I ordered the #17 on the menu which is rice noodles with medium rare beef and beef balls. The medium rare beef was way overdone and not sure if I had asked for it on the side would have even made a difference. It was beef like jerky by the time my bowl arrived and thought that I had more noodles than meat. All in all, the soup was tasty but the meat could have been more plentiful and less noodles would have up my star-factor. There are other pho places in the FiDi that is much closer so I'm not sure if I would be willing to walk down here again. Oh, one more thing.
