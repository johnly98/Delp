I got a set of pork siu Mai, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice with chicken, char siu Bao, custard bao & red bean puff and thousand egg puff for $16.6 total! What a great price.\nI love their siu mai and shrimp dumplings. Their char siu bao was huge but with little fillings. It's understandable given the price, but personally I would prefer having the size smaller so that the pork-bun ratio would be better.\nI was hungry so I started eating part of my take-away food in store. The staff was very nice that she came over to offer a better soy sauce and chatted with me. I told her I came from NY and she asked me about housing in NY. I complained about the Wall Street people pushing the rent & sale market high while she accused the local tech people for the same thing haha! It was such a fun and informative conversation. She was so friendly and considerate. Would love to come back!", "author": "Tian G."}

For only $10, I got a plate of shrimp dumplings, pork shumai, radish cakes, beef rice noodle rolls, and lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice. The service is super nice and fast, so even if there is a line, you will still get your food quickly. \n\nThe shrimp dumplings and pork shumai were packed with meat which surprised me because the price was so low. They were full of flavor, the meat was nice and juicy, and the wrapping was chewy and soft. The radish cakes were the best deal because they were cheap, huge, and extremely filling.\n\nThe beef rice noodle rolls were delicious and had a ton of flavor from the beef and green onion. The menu says one roll is $2 but the lady gave me three rolls, so I don't know but I'm not complaining. My favorite item was probably the lotus leaf sticky rice. There was so much stuff inside the sticky rice so it had a bunch of flavor. The lotus leaf added a nice floral tea flavor and smell. The sticky rice was soft and chewy which contrasted well with the texture from the meat inside. \n\nYou have to come and try this place if you like dim sum. It is actually the cheapest and one of the best dim sum places.", "author": "Shao-Lon Y."}

It's one of the few places that also accepts CC for a purchase, but you have to spend a Minimum $10. You pay the 2% CC fee (they use Square). Bring a bag if you plan on ordering a lot b/c they charge an extra fee if you want a bag to carry out your stuff. Which you most likely will have to b/c they have 1 table.  \n\n~~Parking:  Street parking b/c it's in Chinatown, but you've probably parked somewhere else already and you're just looking for a place to eat. \n\n~~Service: Ok. The man that was serving me and my fam was nice, but he handed us over to a woman that was NOT. She was the one ringing us up to and gave us the utensils and sauces. I had asked for forks and sauces, since the employees were eating their lunch/dinner at the one table inside the place and she provided enough forces for us but only 1 soy sauce and 1 chili sauce packet, sadness. \n\n~~Best Part: Their har Gao (shrimp dumpling) is pretty good along with their chive and shrimp dumpling. \n\n~~Worst Part: Service and some of the food. Would NOT recommend getting the Shanghai dumpling (if you've had really good ones before). The skin is hard and there's no \"soup\" inside. \n\n~~Tips: If you only have a CC and want dim sum, then go here. But there's a lot of ATMs around chinatown for a lot of banks. So I would recommend hitting up an ATM, getting cash, and actually going to Dim Sum Bistro (https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-bistro-san-francisco) which is just a couple of streets over. \n\n~~Return: prob not, just because there's so many other dim sum places around Chinatown and I prefer the Bistro's", "author": "Jean T."}

After trying another shop, we (ok, ME)wanted to try more to compare and really get our dim sum fill before returning home where dim sum options are almost non-existent.\n\nDelicious Dim Sum is located right across of the Gold Gate Fortune Cookie Company, so it's really convenient to just hop across the way and get your dim sum fix.  The shop is small, but surprisingly had a few tables inside.  It's also nice and clean and fortunately for us had no line at all when we came in.\n\nThe menu is printed on the cupboards and everything is priced so reasonably like many other places in Chinatown. Again, I got a pork dumpling, a BBQ pork bun, pan fried chives dumpling, & some others I don't remember. Too busy eating, I forgot to take photos. Hehe.  They did have some unique (to me) offerings like shark fin dumplings, but I'll have to try those on another trip.\n\nAnywho, the pork dumpling. Oh my yum! Their version edged out another establishments by just a smidgen. Flavors were similar, but this one didn't taste as \"porky\" and the filing was also generous. The pork bun was also pretty good & reminded me of our manapuas back home in Hawaii! All in all, their dim sum was indeed delicious and worth a stop if you're craving dim sum or looking for some cheap eats in SF.", "author": "Maria P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "Recommendation: Cash only, but a must visit. Really good Dim Sum, come as early in the day as you can for max selection, $20 can easily feed multiple people.\n\n\nIt's unbelievable that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This is one of the best Dim Sum places we've been to, and even got the stamp of approval from our friend who grew up in Hong Kong. We traveled with them to HK and also think it's the closest we've gotten to HK dim sum. \n\nThe same 3 people are almost always staffing the counter, with the same few cooks peeking out from the kitchen in the back. Good to see that these people are happy and sticking around, even over the few years we've been coming here. \n\nMuch of the food is hidden in steamers, so it's recommended that you look at pictures and know the names of what you want to get before going in. Once the line lets you get into the shop itself, you'll only have a minute or two to look before your order starts getting assembled. It's commonplace to order only a couple of many different things, so if you want to try 5 different dumplings, it's totally fine to order 1 or 2 of each different type. Note though that some items come in 2s or 3s, so if they give you extra it may be that it's their minimum order quantity. \n\nIt's not necessary to speak Chinese to go here, as you can just name the number of the menu item you want with the new menu on the back wall that they put up a couple months ago. Name what you want, they'll find it and ask you how many, and then you can tell them.\n\nIf you're going to eat on the go, don't forget to ask for chopsticks. Also, use the squeeze bottle and hot sauce bowl on the table in the back to  dress up your dumplings before heading out! The seasoning is essential to good dim sum.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned the lack of space: It's true, there's one 4 person table in the back and then 2 or 3 chairs meant for waiting for your order, and that's all the space and seating there is. That being said, there are locations nearby that are suitable for eating. Portsmouth Square, downhill and a block south from Delicious Dim Sum, has a bunch of benches that you could sit and eat at while watching the crowds go through. There's also the roof of The Punchline comedy club, which is open 7 days a week for free. The entrance is between Clay and Washington, on Battery Street. Again there are benches, but it's much more secluded and better if you don't like crowds. From that area, you can also take a pedestrian bridge over Clay Street into a public area in the base of Two Embarcadero Center: It's protected from the elements, there are bathrooms, and even tables! On your way there, you can also grab a $3 bubble tea from Quickly, down the hill from Delicious Dim Sum. \n\nAs for recommendations from the menu, we're pescatarian so we haven't tried any of the meat options. That said, we've had the following:\n\n- Turnip Cake: good if you can pick out the meat bits, we usually order 1\n- Shrimp Roll: long rice roll with large whole shrimp inside, served with sauce. We usually get 2 or 3, but they're bigger than most other items\n- Shrimp Dumplings: steamed dumplings with shrimp inside, we usually get a few since they're small\n- More (I'll update this list!)\n\nWe always try to guess how much we spent, and we almost always overestimate. We typically spend 10 to 15 dollars on Sunday mornings, and that's enough to hold the two of us over until dinner. \n\nAbsolutely love Delicious Dim Sum and I hope it stays this good for a long time to come!", "author": "John B."}

Thank you, Yelp community, for not letting us down.\n\nFirst off -- this is a SMALL and unassuming little shop. It's not a restaurant, really. Upon walking in, the counter takes up 3/4 of the interior, plus a 4-top table off to one corner. It's not immaculate. The walls are a bit stained and void of any art or elaborate decorations. The register and other machinery don't feature cutting-edge technology. The windows could use some cleaning. The food is prepared in a separate room. \n\nBut, honestly, the food makes up for the shop's appearance, and then some. The dim sum was, as promised, delicious. The prices are great -- we spent $16 on lunch for two. It is CASH ONLY, though, so keep that in mind before coming...\n\nWe ordered:\n\n- Pan Fried Chives & Shrimp Dumplings (3 per Order): Thick, filling, and perfectly crunchy. Heavy on the chives, so expect a strong taste.\n\n- Shrimp Dumplings (3 per Order): Steamed, thick wrap. Classic dim sum, and highly recommend.\n\n- Beef Dumplings (3 per Order): Steamed, thin wrap, juicy. Classic dim sum, and highly recommend.\n\n- Shrimp Noodle Roll: Comes with a sauce to soak the noodles in -- try to eat on-site for convenience. Generous amount of shrimp per noodle. Couple noodle rolls per order, cut for you.\n\n- Beef Noodle Roll: Comes with a sauce to soak the noodles in -- try to eat on-site for convenience. Beef was minced, and tasted much better than it looked. Noticeably more flavorful than others that I've tasted. Couple noodle rolls per order, cut for you.\n\n- Sticky Rice with Pork Wrapped in Lotus Leaf: One piece. Most of the rice stuck to the lotus leaf... seemed overcooked. I wouldn't order this particular item again.\n\nWe had the opportunity to eat on-site, but this is more of a takeout type of shop. They combine everything you order into one box, if possible. Service was quick and efficient -- don't expect pleasant small talk with the employees.\n\nWe needed a nap shortly after our meal here. For such seemingly little food, we were full!", "author": "Kathy Z."}

The customer service is typical for a Chinese restaurant which can be rude. I asked for 10 dumplings at the rate of $2.10/3 but the old lady kept insisting I buy 12 dumplings so she can calculate the price easier. When I refused, she still packaged 12 dumplings into the to-go box and said she'll sell it to me at the discounted price of $9.11. Confused at the math, I asked her to explain how was that a discount? She explained that including tax, the rate of the dumplings are $2.28/3. The discount she gave me was 1 cent. I wasn't about to start a scene over pennies and dimes but the whole situation was pretty insultingly humorous to me.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAsian ladies are strong headed and cheap when it comes to business.

But we're soo blessed because by the time it was our turn, the table had just become available, so we actually got to sit and enjoy our hot dim sum instead of having to take it to-go or eat it outside standing up, like other people did. \n\nYou're paying for the affordability factor, and the authenticity of dim sum in Chinatown, so don't expect frills here. They don't have noodles, chow mein, egg custard, or other things you might expect from larger dim sum places with a more extensive menu. \n\nThey do have your Siu mai, har gow, pork bun, dumplings, so there's definitely a lot to choose from and you will get full, but like I said don't expect your fancy schmancy desert or deep fried dim sum dishes. \n\nAll in all, definitely delicious.

And of course i had to check out what the nation's oldest and largest china town was all about. A little about me is that I'm obsessed with dimsum. When a dim sum craving hits I won't stop thinking about it till it's in my mouth. So of course one of my first days in SF I was rabidly scavenging through yelp for the perfect dim sum place...\n\nFood is as promising as the name seems! Me and my s.o. came here, luckily scored the 1 table, which we shared with a cute chinese grandma, and had a grand time. We went for one round of food, then another, all for $16 enough to make us feel supppper full. Just for reference he's 6'4 and me, well I'm just a fatty.

Usually I'd be upset by this but everything was so good and dim sum gets everyone in an adventurous mood sooo, why not!\n\nZE FOOD\n- We ate so many things but a quick review. The Turnip Cakes are meh, but still satisfy the craving. \n- The Beef Rolled Dumpling is so good here!

I'm obsessed with them so I still ordered them and stuffed myself. \n- Pork bun is also pretty good but it ain't no Tim Ho Wan. \n- Chive Dumpling was so so good here! Perfect crisp and texture and a lot of veggies yumyum\n\nOther things, i can't speak to but I will upload photos of so you can try and match them... lmao\n\nTIPS\n- Cash only\n- Take out (only 1 table)\n- You may get some random things, but they all taste great - promise :)\n- My fave dishes were mainly all the dumplings.

The har gow was the best tasting of the lot-they were large in size and had good flavor but could have been hotter temperature wise. The char siu bow had a relatively small amount of BBQ pork compared to the hefty amount of surrounding bun. Since the bun was a little dry, I discarded it once I finished the pork. The beef wrapped in rice noodle was tender, but, again, the carb exterior was overwhelming in quantity. I'd definitely go back for the har gow. Today, it was a bit better than Mong Kok. Yup, you better believe I tried the har gow at Mong Kok 15 minutes later.", "author": "Suzanna L."}

Most of the staff doesn't speak much English- which was no problem, pointing worked great. \n\nThe four of us grabbed the (only) small table in the corner and sat down, excited to eat! To our disappointment, the food was cold and greasy, another not so great combo. To its credit, it was flavorful and obviously made that morning, but a far cry from the steaming hot dim sum I'm used to.\n\nThe restaurant doesn't appear to be particularly clean, and mid-way through the meal, somebody knocked over a tray of dumplings - the metal pan hit the tiled floor with a jarring loud thud.

The dumplings such as the har gow, siu mai and Chao Zhou dumpling were a little oily. The Chao Zhou dumpling was large, though the skin of the dumpling was too thick.

However, the downside is that some pre-made items don't keep well when made in advance; the crispy stuff gets soft and the soup dumplings lose their soupiness.  Also, things can get difficult if trying to setup a dipping sauce while outside on a park bench.   There was no English menu in sight, just a bunch of Chinese written above the counter.  So look at the Yelp photos ahead of time to get the names of things that look good to you (or just call out your usual dim sum favorites).  All things considered, still a tasty and cheap lunch option if it's a nice enough day to enjoy some dumplings outside in Portsmouth Square Plaza.\n\nXiao Long Bao: Tasty and tender pork filling (much more so than the pork shumai), but no soup inside.  But that's what happens when your xiao long bao sits around for a bit.\n\nPan Fried Shrimp & Chive Dumpling: Tasty filling, but not the fried side was not that crispy.  Probably got soggy sitting around all its steamy neighbors.\n\nPork Shumai: A coarser mince than the pork in the xiao long bao.  One of them had an unpleasantly gristly component.\n\nSteamed Pork Bun: Tasty roast pork and sauce instead.  A little too much bread-to-meat for my tastes.\n\nShrimp Rice Noodle Roll: Bleh.  Too much rice noodle roll compared to filling.  In fact, the only filling consisted of 4 small shrimp.", "author": "Adam B."}

It's a tradition my wife and I started, and one adapted and carried on with a good Yelp friend a few years ago. This tradition has gotten so popular in fact that this year we attracted other awesome people from around the globe to share in the experience! This year we even found a sweet park where we could sit and enjoy them while watching morning Tai Chi!\n\nWe come to Delicious Dim Sum for dumplings. Steamed or fried. Rice skin or wheat dough. It doesn't matter as long as it's a dumpling. My favorites include thd shrimp and chive, hargow (shrimp in rice skin), beef shumai, shark fin (which I'm not sure actually has the namesake ingredient and is more pork and shrimp), and the smaller round ones filled with Chinese green vegetables. I always get enough to enjoy in the spot and then enough to bring home to share with the wife and freeze for a later date. You can get 1 of this and one of that, and it's so affordable it's a joke. About 40-50 pieces topped the charts at $32!\n\nTo the uninitiated, Chinese dumplings may all seem the same, and to be honest, I never really knew why these were the best either, but this year it all came together. I got my usual order, and then picked up some dumplings at another shop as well. Comparing the two was night and day. The skins on the dumplings at Delicious are so thin and delicate that you can see right through them. They're barely holding all of the delectable fillings in, which means with each bite you're tasting mainly what's inside. It also shows a level of skill in how they're made, which you can see if you glance into the kitchen. The ones from the other shop... thick, opaque, and definitely more chewy.\n\nNow one of my friends mentioned questionable food handling and holding they observed, specifically flies molesting some of the delicious buns. My response... Thats all part of the authentic Chinatown experience! Just glance around any of the small markets in the area and you'll see plenty of things that make you scratch your head, but It's the uncertainty and unknown aspects that make the experience! \n\nAnother friend mentioned a greasy red bean sesame ball. My response... PRO-TIP: Delicious Dim Sum is all about the dumplings. Steer clear of anything not in a steamer tray at this spot because better can be had very nearby. Even the \"potstickers\" are quite doughy and not that great, but when you go you'll notice they're not in the steamer ;) \n\nOverall, Delicious is still my spot and if you stick to my list and tips, you'll love it too. I highly recommend finding the park to sit in. It adds to the overall experience. Don't feed the pigeons though. It'll be like a scene out of a Hitchcock film.", "author": "Michael T."}

Unfortunately, during our most recent visit, I witnessed some incredibly worrisome ish there: fruit flies and houseflies. \n\nLike many other times, I watched the staff there load har gow, shu mai, shrimp and chive dumplings, and others into a tiny plastic container. After paying, I stepped to the left to watch my homie get his noms and noticed that the display of baked goods (like BBQ pork buns and whatnot) was inundated with fruit flies. Not one. Not two. But ten or twenty! (ICK!) Not to mention, there was an entire crate full of BBQ buns covered in flies underneath a table!

Just the right amount of filling and seasoned just right. Shrimp haw gow. So good! Shrimp was fresh, plump and tender. Shu Mai. Again, very good. It didn't even need any dipping sauce. It had a ton of flavor that we just ate ours without any soy sauce or hot mustard. The things that were just average were the xia long bao (soup dumplings) and the cha siu bao (bbq pork buns). There wasn't enough soup inside the dumplings and the skin was way too thick. As for the bbq pork buns, i found the whole thing to be too sweet.

Don't be shocked: it didn't turn out to be that much. The server was able to fit everything into two take out containers. All the items were jammed in there together willy-nilly, but I don't mind, it's the Chinese take out way. However, those two containers cost $35!! That's a lot of money for take out dim sum! I buy all the time from Oakland Chinatown and I know that same amount would not have not cost me more than $25 at my usual place in Oakland. I guess rent is more expensive in SF so...\n\nAfter arriving home, I was excited to give everything a try but first bite into the veggie rice roll (sorry, I don't know what the name is in English), I was immediately disappointed. The roll was mushy with no bounce-back or \"chewiness\" that a good roll should have. That was pretty evident when I saw it breaking apart as she was lifting it. The Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) was not bad. It was filled with actual chunks of shrimp instead of ground up or minced bits like other places so that made it a notch better than a lot of places.

Good sign.\n\nWe bought a surfeit of things, an embarrassment, really: 2 orders each ha gao, shrimp with chives, shrimp with veggies, 1 order each BBQ pork buns, shanghai dumplings and 2 sesame balls and 3 orders of shu mai and one of this gelatinous noodle thing which after one bite, I'm still not sure what it is and what it's filled with.\n\nThe unsmiling lady behind the counter produced her trusty, scotch-taped, broken screen calculator as I readied a couple of $20 bills. \n\nI was stunned when she said, \"$18.46.\"\n\nAre you KIDDING me? I was wondering if that little calculator was truly broken and not just suffering from a cracked screen. Less than $20 for all of that?\n\nSome wrappers -especially on the Shanghai dumplings - were a little thick and chewy, the BBQ pork puns (steamed only, no baked) the bun too sticky and flavorless but oh, the filling inside was savory and incredible. \n\nAll the flavors were fantastic and each dumpling, generously overstuffed with big chunks of shrimp, lots of spinach, heaping portions of of succulent minced pork and ginger. \n\nAnd the SIZE of these dumplings, oh my goodness! Any dim sum you've ever seen? Double the size. The sesame ball, for example, was nearly the size of a tennis ball (my little boy ate both, but I had a taste and it was fantastic).\n\nThere was no seating, just a utility table at the back of the place that appears to be used for packing up \"to-go\" orders. I thought seating was limited but no, it's non-existent.\n\nNo matter, we were just as happy headed home to tuck into our buffet of delicious dim sum. I'd definitely go back but not on market day.\n\nEven after we shared a generous plate with a neighbor, my little boy and I still have enough for a light lunch or dinner. \n\nI think this place might be cash only. \n\nFood: 3.75 stars\nValue: 5 stars\nService: 2.5 stars", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Expecting there to be a line, I called my order ahead. Now, when I ordered, I thought that saying 1 sui mai = 1 dumpling, and so on. Nope- if you look at more recent pictures of the menu (they have no website), a lot of the dumplings and stuff come in 3. \n\nSo I ended up with a ridiculous amount of dim sum-almost 3x what I was trying to order! But this place is so cheap that this crazy amoun of food (good enough for 3-4 meals probably) was about $20! Mind blown!\n\nRandom stuff: The crowd was actually not too crazy on a Saturday morning, so calling ahead didn't make a huge difference but I guess that on days it is busier, it's a good idea. You can eat there too as they have a few tables. It is cash only so make sure you stop at an ATM before hand. Parking is busy in the area, but not impossible. Cars seem to leave fairly often so you can find parking at a meter; I got parking pretty easily (just went around the block once and then found parking right out front).\n\nThe food? It is good- not the best dim sum I have had, but solid. The har gow, sui mai, and pork buns have very generous amounts of meat and shrimp in them which is awesome. They don't have the most extensive menu- I missed the rice noodles which are one of my favorite things to order in particular and not too many veggie options either. The baked pork buns were only ok- I like them to be a little crispier, but the filling was quite good. Out of the stuff I tried, the sui mai was probably my favorite. The taro cake (which I didn't originally order on the phone but added once I got to the store) was really great also.\n\nConsensus: Pretty good dim sum at an awesome price. No real waiter service or anything, and cash only, but I would definitely come back here in the future.", "author": "Seema U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-28", "description": "So here's the deal - my first exposure to Dim Sum was at the mecca of all that is dim sum in this word: Din Tai Fung (http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-seattle?hrid=Ztw__27dPCffBrItC2UWRg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). I'm a firm believer, having visited Din Tai Fung locations in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Seattle, that it will never be topped, but Delicious Dim Sum provides a (very) cheap and tasty alternative. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nNo frills here, let alone any chairs! English menu? Forget about it. Need some time to decide? Step aside friend there are hungry folks in line! My visit to Delicious Dim Sum was probably about as close as I've ever come to recreating my experiences during a stint in some seedy Shanghai dumpling establishments, but know that that's not necessarily a bad thing. Above all else, Delicious Dim Sum is authentic in their atmosphere, their pricing, and their product. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nGoodness me. To be honest? I have a suspicion that they make up their (very affordable) pricing on the fly. I opted for six pork dumplings and a bbq pork bun, and after a very quick evaluation, the woman behind the counter asked me for $5. Five dollars! This was at the very least a decent sized meal given the fact that dumplings expand after you've eaten them, and I couldn't believe it only cost me a fiver in San Francisco no less. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nWas it the best I've ever had? It wasn't, but it sure as heck wasn't bad. The pork dumplings were delicious, and while they lacked the soupy liquid that's common in XiaoLongBao elsewhere, the flavor was there, and it was good. The bbq pork bun was a bit subpar in that it was pretty dry and stuck to the rice paper to a degree that was a bit off-putting, but all in all this was good stuff. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nTypically I'd only dish out this star if this was top tier, which I'll argue that Delicious Dim Sum is not, but given the value here, the variety, and the acceptable quality, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't stop by daily if I could do. Star Granted. \n\nIf I could afford it? Yes - it's better than Blue Bell, and that's not something you hear often from someone who has spent any significant amount of time in Texas. Star Granted.", "author": "Paul V."}

The place is very small with only couple of small tables, but great to take  dim sum to go! Normally just get three of each: shrimp dumplings, pork sui mai, beef sui mai, chive dumplings, steamed BBQ pork buns, and tunip cakes are very good and my usuals. Honestly their Shanghai XLB and pot stickers are not great cuz the dough is just too thick and Shanghai XLB is not juicy. So I usually skip these and other places serve better XLB and pot stickers. My whole family loves it too and they usually get dim sum from here if they are around Chinatown. The price is much much cheaper than you would have gone to a regular restaurant for dim sum. So great place for a quick togo order! \n\nI happened to attend the Foodie Adventure by Chris Milano's tour and this is one of the spots they all go to on their North Beach Chinatown tour. Just on a side note, the tour is not worth it at all for the price paid ($85 per person) because you could totally explore Chinatown North Beach at your own pace and have all the foods they gave for $10 bucks.

I had it the last time I was in SF, and it was just a divine as I remembered!\n\nYou may know exactly what you want, but I don't really. Here's my go-to game plan, you can steal it if you need to:\n\n1. Say some words like \"pork & chives\" and \"shumai\" and then point at some other good looking things. The ladies will understand.\n2. Get way more than you think you should. Get that weird thing that you've never tried too. Get double of what you know you like.\n3. Pay $5-10 (if you got the more than you think you should amount)\n4. Try and squirt some of the sauce that's sitting on the only table into your styrofoam containers. \n5. Go somewhere nice, or literally stand in the street like I do, and eat those delicious morsels. \n\nSee? Simple. You don't get to sit down, the service is kind of crazy, the place is tiny, but it's a glorious 5 minute adventure that ends with you getting some amazing dim sum.

My friends and I had to grab a quick lunch before the Giants game on a Sunday and we were looking for a quick dim sum place. Delicious Dim Sum hit the spot. Even though they're not a sit down restaurant by any means, you can drop it, order (or point at what you want) and you're OTD (OUT THE DOOR) in like 5 minutes (depending on the crowd). There were a couple of ladies behind the counter both looking annoyed so we (non-Chinese) ordered quick and shy-ed away from being picky.  \n\nThe Har Gow, Siu Mai, shrimp rice noodles, BBQ pork bao and fried dumplings were all good.

She doesn't really speak english so I thought she gave me someone else's bag.  Well, as it turned out, the OTHER worker thought I walked out without paying!  I told her that the older woman who came running after me down the block was the one who rang me up not more than 10 min ago!!!  Really?  The woman couldn't confirm or remember that I paid her?

But I'm afraid this one fell short.\n\nI do love that you can order individual pieces so you can try a bunch of different kinds of dim sum, but the giant steamers did not easily reveal what was inside! I stated a few of my favourites and ended up with a nice little container filled with dim sum, all for $5! Bargain! \n\nI couldn't wait to try so I found a bench and got into it. The BBQ pork bun was ok, the dough was fluffy and sweet, but a little heavier than I like and the filling was minimal. Shrimp and chive dumplings are usually my favourite so I got two - unfortunately these were oily, chewy, and overloaded with chive and little balance. The har gow was easily my favourite as the shrimp was very tender and flavourful, however the wrapper was very thick so I ended up eating the filling right out of it. My sesame ball was very, very greasy (I always expect at least a little) so although the filling was tasty it was hard to appreciate because my mouth filled with grease on each bite.\n\nI can see that this would be fine for a grab and go if you're not too fussy, but perhaps I've been spoiled as this wasn't my favourite dim sum I've ever had, that's for sure!", "author": "Ayla C."}

You can see some of those workers. So this food is very fresh. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, beef roll, shrimp roll, sesame balls, steamed pork buns and a few other things that I don't know what they are. Everything was very good for a take-out dim sum place. We had three containers of food for only $30 which is really good price. \n\nThe food is great and there are a lot of Chinese locals getting food so it must be pretty good.

Normally, I would not walk into a place with such an Americanized name but the restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. Plus their dumplings looked amazing.\n\nThis restaurant was carryout only which greatly limited the amount of dumplings I ordered but ended up getting four har how, two shrimp and chive dumplings, two pork dumplings and one bbq pork bun. The had how was the best I've ever had. A thin and moist wrapper which pulled apart easily and was stuffed chock full o' scrimps. The BBQ pork bun was light and fluffy and had the perfect ratio of meat to carb. The pork dumping and chive dumpling was super tasty as well. \n\nThe total damage? $5.20.

So I yelped for a dim sum place to quench my craving.\n\nThis is what I got:\n1 beef churng fun - beef noodle roll\n1 regular churn fun - noodle roll with cilantro and dried shrimp\n2 har gow - shrimp dumpling\n4 gow choi gow - pan fried chive and shrimp dumpling\n2 fun go - minced meat dumpling with peanuts\n2 law bak go - turnip cake\nfor a total of $8.60\n\nDim sum is all about the filling and the wrapper.  \n\nbeef churng fun: The noodle portion was soft and smooth and not too thick.  The beef filling was fresh and tasty.  This was good. \n\nregular churng fun:  Same soft, fresh rice noodle.  The cilantro gave it lots of flavor but the dried shrimp was ok. It had a bunch of crunchy shrimp shell bits mixed in.  This was ok.\n\nhar gow: I'm not a har gow kinda girl but I ordered some based on the yelp reviews.  I agree.  They are very good.  The wrapper was perfect (not too thick and not too thin so the filling falls out). The filling is packed with fresh shrimp that was yummy and not overcooked.  The shrimp had that nice crunch to it.\n\ngow choi gow: This is one of my fave dim sum items to order.  The wrapper was nice and thin (easily torn).  The filling was packed with chives and had a decent piece of shrimp.  It was delicious.\n\nfun go:  This was bad.  The filling definitely tasted off like it was going bad.  Plus the wrapper was thick and the top of the dumpling hard, could not eat.\n\nlaw bak gow:  This tasted good.  The cake is soft. It didn't have much stuff in it except a few small pieces of Chinese sausage.  Plus you can tell it didn't have much turnip in it, mostly filler.\n\nI was happy to find this place.

Rather it is a take-out dim sum place with perhaps the best dim sum I've had in San Francisco.

While they will probably understand if you order in English, your best bets are to order in Chinese or by pointing and holding up your fingers.

It was seasoned well and was not gristley with cheap cuts of meat. \n\nMy all time favorite was the chive dumpling, filled with water crest and chives. The chives gave it a wonderful fresh taste and added some crisp to the dumpling. Giving it wonderful texture, it wasn't bland and was season well.\n\nThe shrimp noodle was mediocre. the noodle was thinker than I expected that made it a little hard to eat and not as silky as other ones I have had. It felt like it has been sitting out a little longer than the other dishes we had. It was still decent and I will try it again.\n\nThe bbq pork bao was also bland and not as big nor fluffy as Good Mong Kok.\n\nI would recommend this place for the sui mei and chive dumplings. I will go back and try other things they have. They def have more options than Good Mong Kok, but Good Mong Kok wins in the bao and haw gow category for me.", "author": "Vay V."}

I like that I can just come here and tell her I want the one with chives and she knows which one I'm referring to.\n\nThe prices fare about the same with other dim sum places in the area.

I was looking for a cheap to-go spot, and this fit the bill. Again, my fellow Yelpers did not disappoint!\n\nTips:\n- Know what you want to order before you get there. The menus are in Chinese and you can't see all the dim sum because they have it stacked in different steam pots. So browsing isn't really practical. Plus, there's the language barrier.\n\n- Dim sum is ordered by individual pieces. I made the mistake of saying \"two orders of pork and shrimp dumpling\" and she gave me two dumplings. So there you go.\n\n- Cash only\n\n- Dim sum is around 40 cents a piece and you only need about 6-8 dumplings to get full. They have one small table crammed in the back. So they automatically assume you're ordering to-go unless you tell them you're eating there.\n\nThe pork and shrimp dumpling turned out to be shu mai. It was very tasty, filling and not overly greasy. I also got the chive and shrimp dumplings, which turned out to be more chive than shrimp. Lots and lots of chives. Eek. Next time, I'll try the prawn style dumplings or the siu long bao. I finished off my order with a sesame ball for dessert. Tasty!\n\nGrand total: $4.40 for 8 dumplings and a sesame ball.

As a result, we basically paid for some flat hagow (which we had already ordered)... not to mention the food temp was just barely warm.\n\nTo top our experience off, the lady that worked the front was downright rude.  She rolled her eyes at us when we said that we were eating it there and she had already started putting our food in the clear, plastic to-go box.  I guess packaging costs are really that big of a deal to her.  Plus, she came to the table and took back our containers of soy sauce from our bag without saying a word to us (I'm guessing because they have a dispenser at the table... but at least SAY something!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-05", "description": "San Francisco is a great place for those hankering for dim sum without wanting to go to a sit down restaurant. After several searches on Yelp, I stopped by Delicious Dim Sum to see if they would live up to its name. This fast food joint is literally a narrow walkway without an ambiance and the interior is dependent on the natural lighting coming through its large storefront window to keep the place operative. They charge $1.10 on most dim sum items that comes in threes, and the long line out the door tells me something about their turnover rate when it comes to food and the possibility that their dim sum might just be legit.\n\nPork dumpling: This dumpling came with an exterior that reminded me of xiao long bao without the juicy interior. The thick and tender pork loin and minced scallions was smooth and easy to bite into. It was delicious but the meat was on the fatty side and could be leaner.\n\nShrimp dumpling: Plump and voluptuous dumpling with enough shrimps to please. It was good!\n\nShumai: The taste of pork is nicely seasoned without it being redundant from the pork dumpling. As a comparison, the pork had a stiff and chewy texture and it was pretty juicy with every bite. I liked it.\n\nTaro cake: The taro cake wasn't pan fried to render the desired crispy edges but there was a good soft texture that included sufficient amount of taro and pork. It was decent and not the best.\n\nSweet rice bun: The glutinous outer layer was perfect with a set of sticky rice that fell apart easily with a rich, infused pork flavor. This is a must get for those who are planning to visit.\n\nAll together, my dim sum brunch cost $3.60 and was enough to get me full while still have enough room for coffee afterwards. The three limitations I experienced was the poor service, a lack of a place to sit, and I believe their meat quality could be leaner. The older lady who helped me gave me the look of disbelief upon seeing the little food I ordered. I guess they're used to people buying in bulk but they also need to be sensitive and welcoming to those who are trying them for the first time. \n\nSecondly, unlike their other Chinatown fast food counterparts, this place does not have a place to sit. There is a little table in the back and while I was temporarily using the only set of condiments available on the table, an older White man stood nearby pointed to the table, asked and proceeded to teach me in an authoritative tone, \"You're going to clean that up right?\" He finger pointed to a small spill of red chili sauce on the table while I was half way done with the condiments. \"We are using this table just so you know,\" as he clarified to me in case I didn't speak English and made sure that I'm fully aware that I was invading his space. Through our exchange somehow he assumed that I was not decent enough to clean after myself while he felt within duty to put me into servitude. Although his behavior is not a reflection on the restaurant and its employees, it was still a part of my experience here that was demeaning as he was using his moral authority to subjugate me into a subordinate position. There is a long and rich history of social and economic struggle in San Francisco Chinatown and given the context I will not let someone like him to tell me that his quality of life is more urgent than mine. Trust me, I made sure that he felt embarrassed for what he did before walking out.\n\nFinally, although their dumplings are flavorful and delicious, the meat quality could still be leaner. I wish there are places like this nearby where I live since the price and level of convenience can't be beat. Despite the many bright spots, I still prefer You's Dim Sum on Broadway in Chinatown and Good Luck Dim Sum and Tao Yuen Pastry in other parts of the Bay Area. Without factor in the unexpected incident, 3.5 stars for the overall experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

This must be a good place since there were so many people waiting in line for it.

That's when I found Delicious Dim Sum.  It sounded generic enough and the sheer brilliance of the name was calling to a Gweilo like me.  \n\nAs I stepped in, I was saddened by the menu only being written in Chinese.  I wondered how can a shop with such a brilliant name have a menu in only Chinese?  Well, after trying my best to tell the lady I wanted Shu Mai, Har Gow and things that are similar, I relented and asked the lady behind the counter if she could show me what they had and I'd point to it.  After the awkward exchange, I ended up buying 3 days worth of Dim Sum for about $10.  Score!  The dim sum was actually good too, much better than what you can get at crummy dim sum places like Joy Luck Place for about a quarter of the cost.  \n\nMoral of the story I guess is, don't let the weird name fool you, the place is pretty good.

As far as the dim sum goes, Delicious has everything you need to satisfy your dim sum cravings, and delivers on both flavor and authenticity.  \n\nI ordered your standard items shui mai, har gow, and shrimp cheong fan, as well as a dumpling filled with shrimp pork and cilantro (def the best of the bunch if you ask me).  Everything was pretty good, with the shrimp pork and cilantro dumpling as the standout.  Make sure that you order this...\n\nOverall I would say that Delicious Dim Sum does in fact live up to its namesake.  No surprises.  Cheap, delicious, and right next door to Golden Gate Bakery, which is a big plus.  Make sure you stop by for some of their egg tarts!", "author": "Michael C."}

We ran out of our hotel without having breakfast and while hiking up the hill from Union Square to Chinatown, my fianc\u00e9 and I realized that both of us were starving. I did what I normally do while traveling... pulled up Yelp app on my iPhone and searched for nearby dim sum places. Delicious Dim Sum was close by and we decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhen we approached the place, we quickly realized it wasn't really a sit down restaurant, but rather a takeout place. That did not stop us... Lady working inside with very limited English almost did, but after utilizing key words like \"shrimp\", \"chicken\" and \"pork\", we managed to get a few item into a to go box for a quick snack.\n\nWe got shrimp steamed dumplings, some kind of pork baked dumplings and a sesame ball. Food tasted fresh, although wasn't very hot. Pork dumplings were my least favorite, but I'm just not a big fan of pork.\n\nThis place is good for take-out and a quick snack if you want to try some local food. It's realy cheap too, I believe we paid around $7, for 7 items.", "author": "Olga C."}

The menu items are all written in chinese, so I had no idea what any of it said, what they had, nor what price everything was. I just ordered what I usually do - 2 orders of the shrimp dumplings, pork sui mai, fried mince pork ball. I also ordered the shrimp and green onion dumplings.  Got all this for $9!\n\nAfter having been to mulitple dim sum places, I do have to say that this one is legit. The dumplings were very flavorful. I wish I had more of the shrimp dumpling orders!

It was the perfect food to eat after we got home from high school. Once we left for college, we stopped coming here until recently we would make the occasional trip here to get lo mai gai.  Not going to lie, the lo mai gai tasted just like I remembered it tasting. Super delicious and savory. Everything from the sticky rice to the ground meat to the sausage is damn amazing. The only thing I don't care for much is the little bit of hard boiled egg in it. To me, it doesn't really do much so without it I wouldn't miss it but I guess more protein can't hurt.

I dont know how we could have ate all the food we ordered while walking/standing around chinatown!! \n\nWe ordered $26 worth of dim sum! Call us crazy, I think the ladies at the counter thought we were buying out the entire store! We practically did. The dim sum is SOOO cheap here, we were surprised.\n\nWhat we didnt like: (maybe it was because we came so late in the day and all the foods left werent too fresh?)\n\n-pork buns (Char Sui Bao)- eh! not even that spectacular!\n-huge sesame balls - not too fancy :/\n-har gao - it wasnt that great! The skin was way too thick\n-chueng fun (shrimp rice noodle roll) - yuck! \n\nWhat we enjoyed:\n-shrimp & cilantro dumplings -  a bit on the greasy side though!\n-pork shu mai \n-potstickers\n\nWhen we said that we were eating it there and the lady serving us had already started putting our food in the pink to-go box, she was actually not annoyed like we had assumed she'd be. We were pretty complicated - not gonna lie. I bet she hated us secretly :) \n\nOverall, you get what you pay for! It's CHEAP! One thing to note is the lack of cleanliness. I was a bit disgusted sitting down at the table in te back and the walls, floor and table were gross and sticky. Oh yeah and CASH only and its best if you know how to say the things in cantonese!!

Manuvering through Chinatown while dodging the obnoxious dudes trying to shove flyers in my face, mega drained my politness reserves, and left me starving. Luckily, I found this place after asking a sweet lil chinese woman which restaurant she recommended. Judging by her roundness, I took her word as golden, and headed inside. \n            \n          Heads up, unless youre fluent in Chinese, there will be a language barrier! The only thing you'll understand on the menus are the prices, everything else is a \"excuse me can you repeat that\" or a ini-mini-minie-mo game. You can choose between shrimp or pork dim sum, fried shrimp and cilantro, tripe, and shrimp potstickers. Other menu items include 100 year old egg pastries(you heard me, 100!) sweet rice in banana plant leaves, and a tofu shaped dim sum with mystery contents. Oh and for about .25 to .60 per dim sum, you can load up on  a few of each for well under $5.00. Yeah son!\n    \n          Another disclosure, seating here is limited, and I mean limited to the one table inside the place with only 4 chairs, or to the table at your place. Back to the food...AMAZING!! The pork dim sum was complimented perfectly with green onions and peanuts, the shrimp was simple yet still flavorful, and all the ingredients were fresh.\n\n        After a long day of bumping my way through Chi town, Delicious Dim Sum was the perfect way to end my day.", "author": "Gabriella C."}

My friend and I stumbled upon this on yelp and decided to walk our disoriented bodies up the hill to the little shop that could.  There is a counter you stand and order from, one table in the place, and nothing in English.  But you just need to know the basic words and point.  It's really that simple!  \n\nI really wanted to do 5 but I had to drop it down 1 star because she didn't give me soy sauce nor chili after I asked politely a few times.  I'm just a sickler for details.  I have to say, this is by far the cheapest and one of the yummiest places for dim sum.  Variety is not as great as a big sit-in with the ladies rolling the carts but still delicious and the right amount of grease.  The two of us ate for $8.00 cash (with leftovers) and I even had a Diet Coke as a poor alternative for my Gatorade craving.  \n\nDefinitely try the chives shrimp dumpling and the basics - pork and shrimp dumpling.

I usually try to buy a huge box of food so I can eat dim sum for breakfast the entire week. Usually this comes out to around $10.00 for the whole week! I would suggest the chive dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and daikon cakes.\n\nSome downsides are that parking is absolutely horrible around here (like every other place in SF), they only take the cash money, and if you don't speak Cantonese, the lady behind the counter will probably grumpily serve you.

When I got there around 4pm on a friday there was barely anything left!!!\n\nI was kinda sad but I tried the har gow, shumai and turnip cake it tasted like shit. I know I came really late b/c dim sum is made in the mornings, but damn everything was straight up cold. The shrimp in the har gow tasted old and left a after taste in my mouth the shumai was chewy and the turnip tasted like it came from ranch 99 market . Everything was really cheap though 50 cent per piece.\n\nLets talk about the service it blows they lady who helped me looked like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. She didn't seem to appreciate our company very much and when I asked her for chili paste she pointed at the table in the back that had not thing on it. After blowing me off a few times she realized she placed the chili paste in the fridge thats why I didn't see it.

The chives and shrimp is also good but not as shrimp-y tasting obviously.  The reason this place is so good is because of the soft tapioca wrapping.  It's very soft and oily, not hard or thick like some other places.  For me that is what sets it apart from the others.  Also, the filling inside is very delicious, just like their name implies.  \n\nAs for knowing how to order, you can ask them what's underneath the top baskets.  They are nice and understand enough English to lift it up and show you what's there.  \n\nThis place is cash only.  Very cheap and very good.  Another thing is that they keep for a while.  I went this morning, brought some home and they are still good...I even just ate one.  I cannot eat enough of these!  I wish I had bought more =(    I have a plan for next time though...

Turnip cake is one of my favorite dishes so I had to try some...they were a little too thick and didn't have that brown, crunchy outer coating that I like. Not bad though. The chive dumplings were awesome...kinda greasy but so mouth watering! Lastly, the potstickers were ginormous!

The wrapping was just the right thickness, with lovely suppleness and slight translucence.  Probably the best dim sum dumpling I have ever had.\n\nMy guy loved the oversized, pan-fried pork potsticker as well.\n\nEverything was priced very reasonably (we got a large box-full for under $10), fresh (you can see ladies in the back making dumplings in their kitchen non-stop), and tasty.  We tried most of the shrimp and pork items, and there were no misses in the bunch.\n\nExpect to take your food to go -- as other reviewers noted, the whole place is practically one counter.\n\nFood was so good and such a good value that we actually had a huge box-full for breakfast and returned later that morning for more.  We still dream about dumplings from this place from Southern CA (where we are based).  Better than sit-down dim sum, even from fancier places.", "author": "ReviewChick A."}

If you don't know Chinese (like me) be prepared to be assertive- ask a lot of \"What are those?\" questions because most of these dim sum gems are tucked away.\n\nWe had ordered a total of 12 goodies + an Orange Crush soda which totaled a mere 7 bucks! What a steal! And our whole purchase did the job- split between me and my bf's monstrous appetite, we were both full once we chowed down on everything. \n\nThe Siu Mai is an absolute must-have. These are the best, no-skimp, meaty siu mais I've ever had. I later discovered my bff had bought me a few of these a year ago and even then I remember being just as impressed & satisfied by how tasty they were. The shrimp dumplings, pork buns, rice dumplings and chive dumplings were also big winners in my book. There's no need for soy sauce w/ any of these bad boys. They have enough flavor to stand on their own.\n\nGrab some Delicious Dim Sum and park your butt in Chinatown's social courtyard (only a block away) to do some people watching while getting your dim sum fix.

With knowing that San Francisco Bay area has the oldest Chinatown we opted for some really good Chinese food. After reading numerous reviews we decided to venture to Delicious Dim Sum. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with the way the place looked. It really is not a restaurant that is intended for \"a sit down service\". Rather, it is more like a Chinese bakery meant for carry out, ONLY. To back up my mention, the restaurant had only ONE-UNO table with a jar of hot sauce and a bottle of soy sauce. Nonetheless, my husband and I decided to not give into the stereotype of the exterior of Delicious Dim Sum and gave their food a try. \n\nThere was no serving dish; The lady who we ordered from piled our food on a plastic sheet, much like a plastic bag without an opening of a pocket. She gave us two paper trays & plastic forks to eat our dumplings with. With much anticipation of what we read on Yelp we sat down and dove into a variety of dim sum that we had ordered. EVERYTHING tasted DELICIOUS and neither of us was disappointed! The ingredients were fresh and the fillings of the dumplings were \"solid\", with no unnecessary starch. YUMMIE! We thought to ourselves. \n\nMy husband and I were glad that we didn't go eat elsewhere because of the \"look\" of the restaurant. The food was really tasty but, if one is searching for the ambiance as well as service, forget about it, you won't find it here. However, if one is looking for good food at a really cheap price, Delicious Dim Sum is a great place to pick up food for carryout!  \n\nOne advice with this place: Do not prejudge. \n\nRecommendations: Shrimp Dumplings, Pork Shumai, Shrimp Dumplings with Cilantro, Shrimp Dumplings with Chives, Steam Pork Dumplings. \n\nHappy Eating! ^_^", "author": "Jenny T."}

The 6 miles made me hungry, so I wandered up the hill to grab some dim sum. This place was empty but smelled good, so I went in.  Ordered 3 har gau, 2 bao, and a taro cake, all for 3 bucks.  The shrimp dumplings were the star, huge and delicious.  The bao were good, though could have used a bit more meat.  Good flavor though. I had never had the taro cake before, but liked it, not too greasy, which tends to happen  with its cousin the turnip cake.", "author": "Brian G."}

There's not really any good place to sit and eat in the surrounding area, as the closest park is pretty seedy and the rest of Chinatown is too busy to cop a squat in.

It's not that hard to provide some condiments on the side or have it there for request -- I did see the yelp picture with soy sauce on the side of dumplings/buns.
