That has been open for more than 40 years! 40 YEARS?!?! The interior can do a little work, but this is your neighborhood hole in the wall spot. I usually come in during lunch time. The mom usually does the servicing. While the dad is the master chef. They do have another waitress that comes in after 3pm. I perfer the Mom though. They hand make their own appetizers and the tasty chili sauce as well. On a few occasions I would buy a mason jar of chili sauce for the house. I have a handful of dishes I like here.\n\n- Pan Fried Noodles (crunchy small egg noodles with choice of meat/vegetables/gravy on top)\n- Chicken or Cod Fish Salt & Pepper\n- Wonton Soup (broth is really clear and they make it themselves)\n- Curry Chicken Basil Chow Fun or Fried Rice\n- Eggrolls or Potstickers\n\nThere's plenty more. \n\nI like how you can also replace the white rice with fried rice/chow mein/brown rice for an extra charge.\n\nIf your rice plate don't have vegetables. You can add broccoli/chinese broccoli/mixed vegetable for an extra charge as well.\n\nThey have a REALLY good selection of sodas/beers.\nI never walked into a chinese restaurant that has IPA/Stella/Blue Moon. Of course they have Tsing Tao/Heineken as well. \n\nGive this place a shot. You won't regret it!", "author": "A M."}

I ordered a dish named black pepper beef. It looked terrible and tasted terrible as well! Too salty!! The chef put too much salt inside, I couldn't bear. I talked this to the waitress, a Chinese lady who speaks Cantonese. She looked offended and upset. She argued: \"\u600e\u4e48\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u54b8\u5462\uff1f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u513f\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u5ba2\u4eba\u90fd\u6ca1\u8bf4\u8fc7\u54b8\uff01\"\uff08\"How come? No way it's too salty! No customer here complained it's salty ever!\") She even used a fork to try this dish by herself (with my permission), then still insisted that it's good, not salty at all. I took it as an indication that it was my problem, not theirs. \n\nI had to order another dish, orange chicken, hoping to have better luck this time. (I didn't walked away to try a different restaurant because it took me more than 5 minutes to find a parking lot along the street, i don't wanted to waste that effort and do the search again.) I also ordered a bowl of steamed rice, in case the taste of the second dish is heavy too. Fortunately, the orange chicken tasted OK. But I finally paid more than double as I expected, with the black pepper beef almost untouched. \n\nWhen I paid the bill, the waitress said sorry to me. She explained that she was not the boss of the restaurant,and therefore couldn't do much for me. I'm not angry with her emotionally. But still, a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. I won't recommend it to any of my friends at San Francisco.", "author": "Dapeng L."}

Across the street begin the skyscrapers of the Financial District.  Yelpers say that Young's Cafe gets busy during lunch, and due to its prime location, I believe it.\n\nFor its price, I'm surprised that it's a clean, well-done-up little restaurant.  I did not go downstairs, but there are plenty of signs saying that there's more room to sit down there.  My main thought:  A good place for a date, if your love doesn't insist on the Tadich Grill.\n\nI got spicy garlic chicken to go.  Lots of little chunks of chicken, and it was spicy indeed.  The garlic sauce was the highlight of the meal;  unfortunately, the chicken was almost tasteless.  Also came with soup and broccoli, I ate neither.\n\nGood place if you just need to pick up some cheap Chinese lunch quickly and don't need a high-quality taste.  I rushed in and rushed out, didn't look at much of the rest of the menu, so if you do have a date here, I hope that your food is as nice as the atmosphere.  Because, in this case, it wasn't.

We were walking toward R&G lounge and we saw the line out the door so we just went to the first place we saw. I didn't even check yelp for the ratings until after i ordered. \n\nI guess when people see a 3 star restaurant - its a toss up if they will go or not. Everyone wants to go to the highest rated place or the trendiest, but in reality yelp is 80% filled with 3 star restaurants. So this time i decided not to be a food snob, but a normal person who just wants to eat. \n\nWe sat down, the staff were extremely nice and polite and the food was cheap. Even tho it was cheap, the food tasted good. I guess my expectation for a 3 star restaurant is low, so i was pleasantly pleased. The food was fresh and not reheated and portions were just right. \n\nI think a lot of us overlook the 3 star restaurants and only go toward the 4+ stars even tho most of those places are over rated and all hype. i should make a yelp challenge to check out a 3star place that has less than 10 reviews.

They were friendly, but it still felt cold and to the point, as opposed to what I have been used to ever since I arrived in San Francisco. \n\nI sure will go back, and I really recommend this place to anyone who needs what I needed at that time or just walks into Chinatown and needs a decent meal for a good price. Don't force yourself to make the detour if you are really looking to experience the best Chinese cuisine San Francisco has to offer though, as there are better places around if you have some spare time.", "author": "Nicolas S."}

The servers were really nice and didn't seem rushed to get you in and out.  I got the beef chow fun and it came with a soup; both of which were delicious.  My friend got house fried rice and orange chicken which were also pretty good.  \n\nTo top it off, we got orange slices with our fortune cookies.  Orange slices! What a decadent surprise!", "author": "James C."}

The lunch specials are pretty amazing, $6.50 gets you a big plate of rice with your choice of chicken, prawns or pork. And you get a bowl of hot and sour soup, although this isn't that great.\n\nI've been there a couple of times already, it has always had a consistent crowd of people waiting to pick up orders and others eating. Nice place for quick and good HK-style Chinese.\n\nMy fortune was \"Do not dwelll on differences with a loved one. Try to compromise\" Well that doesn't make it very fun.", "author": "Joseph T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-14", "description": "i must say that this place is a victim of \"the universal rating system\" that i've mentioned before and infects many different rating schemes that you see.  where you have a Gary Danko or M. Mina as the 5 star restaurant and the Mickey D's or Popeye Chicken as the 1 star restaurant and where ever you fall in between those extremes is kind of what rating you get.  personally, i don't subscribe to that rating system.  i rate a place more on how it stacks up against your Expections!  or maybe better said: what it's trying to do... what it does versus what peer-group restaurants are doing, for example.  and i think in that category, this place is 5 stars! \n\nsure, first, it's chinese food... second, no white table clothes. ... no watiers in tuxedo's... no hot hostess in a cocktail dress that's just a little more revealing than your date's... shall i go on.  but none of these short-comings should prevent it from getting a 5 star rating because it's not trying for any of that nor would any reasonable person expect that stuff from a corner chinese local spot.  \n\nthese place gives you free soup when you walk in.  hello!  free soup.  lovin it so far.  they take custom orders.  sweet.  i don't even look at the menu, it's so confusing.  i just tell them what i want.  yeah know... \"um, can you do some chicken and brocolli with rice and make it a little spicy?\"  they just nod and don't even bother to say: \"hey that's not on the menu.\"  they just write it down and give it to you when they are done with it.  i don't even think they KNOW that what youv'e just ordered isn't on the menu.  i mean, it's not like the menu has special names: reading the menu is like this: \n\n- beef with asparagus and noodles.\n- pork with mixed vegetable and rice.... \n\netc... so you can pretty much order whatever you want and they write it down and give it to you.  plus free tea!  sweet!  and free cookies and oranges at the end.  ok, ok.  i know most chinese places give you all that stuff too. yes, this place is kinda liberal with the oil and therefore greasy but hey, comes with the territory.  never has let me down so far.  even people that would have never walked in this place had i not taken them here say that it was pretty good. so there ya go...", "author": "dan h."}

We came here by accident after our original destination was blocked by the Chinese New Year parade and were very surprised by how good the grubbage was. We sat downstairs with two children (4 and 1) and it was quiet and pleasant to eat in. The service was fast too. However, I also give this place 4 stars because the food is very Americanized and greasy and probably fatty (not for sure), and I LOVE that in my Chinese food!", "author": "Greg G."}

I set out from my office and popped into the first chinese place I saw.  Second big mistake.  It looked like a good value - entre plus rice plus soup for $6.50.  I ordered the Orange Chicken.  They don't take credit cards (all I had on me) for orders under $10 so I threw in an order of spring rolls.\n\nThe chicken was the strangest thing - dry and did not taste like orange at all, though it was colored a vibrant orange.  It tasted sickly sweet, like it was cooked with vanilla soda.  Served over rice - dry boring white rice. No sauce.  The spring rolls had to have been several days old - also dry, totally uninspiring.  Finally - to seal the deal as one of the worst meals I've had - 2 long black hairs in my rice.   ewwwww!", "author": "Cynthia S."}

Right.\n\nSo a friend and I go to Young's Caf\u00e9 because we were both craving Chinese food, had already planned to eat Chinese food for lunch, and it was fairly close to work. We got there at about 12:30 PM and on a Thursday, we still beat the rush--that is, if they get much of a rush. Young's Caf\u00e9 is a pretty small restaurant with probably 8 tables and a maximum occupancy of 30 people (I have no idea why I remember seeing that sign). They give you tea instead of water and they have a lot of lunch specials. We got orange chicken over rice and mongolian beef over rice. The specials also come with soup, which isn't bad. Remember how I said hole in the wall? Well, our food came in like 2 minutes--no joke. I was kind of nervous to eat it. Back to the food. Now I'm really no expert per se in the mongolian beef category, but I'm pretty sure it isn't drenched in sauce--DRENCHED. I was really excited for my mongolian beef, and was pretty disappointed when I got it. Let me clarify, I'm not a super saucey person. I don't like things like teriyaki chicken (unless it's REALLY good). So unless you really like saucey stuff, Young's Caf\u00e9 is not for you. The orange chicken wasn't bad. Good thing I was really hungry, otherwise, I probably wouldn't have eaten as much as I had.\n\nThe stars are really for speed and location, and maybe just a quarter of a star for the orange chicken.", "author": "Maureen B."}

Everyone in the place arrived after us, but got their food before us.  Was it because we ordered an appetizer?  Could be.
