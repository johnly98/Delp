They will run around all over the place and try to make things work, they might have a temper tantrum or 2 because they don't really grasp the concept of \"science\" and how everything works.

Unique & unforgettable (Tactile Dome details below). \n\n- Ambiance: Fun, exciting, playful, chill, people-oriented. Many come to hang out and grab a drink. \n\n-IG-worthy photo spots, visually stimulating & science-inspired artworks that are both fun & educational. \n\n- The best thing about Afterdark is that it's of a different theme each time. There is always something new & refreshing to experience. Also, the way they introduce independent artists behind each piece help encourage the community to support the talent. I've become fan to the artists whose works they've brought to the exhibit. \n\n-First-time trying the Tactile Dome. Had to say, it was a bit scary in an all-dark environment while having to figure your way out. No spoiler. Just tests the way you face the unseen & unknown. Also increases awareness of the 4 other senses, especially touch and sound. \n\n- Overall a very happy place!", "author": "Jess W."}

There is no specific parking lot/garage for this facility. So, being in San Fran, good luck. It took me about 10 min to find a parking garage with open spaces available and another 10-12 min to walk to the Exploratorium. I'd like to point out it was a Friday so I'm sure it was busier than during then Mon -Thur. Also, try to find the closest possible parking because after a very fun and tiring day here, the kids did not want to walk a good 10+ min when we left left. \n\nSo, for the Exploratorium itself. It is a little pricey but worth it! 30 for adults and 20 for kids. I paid 10 dollars more and got a season pass. It made sense for the amount of people I had with me. 3 and under are free!! The kids were so excited. The kids ages ranged from 2 to 11. There is SO... much to see and do there. We got there at 12ish and stayed until 5 and we didn't even finish the whole thing. (Good thing i got the season pass) it's even fun for adults. A great learning and hands on experience for all ages! We even got to see a cow eye ball Dissection. The facility is clean, and everything is kept up well. Also, make sure to go outside, there some fun stuff out there too! \n\nThe only bad thing I didn't like was the sea glass restaurant. All the staff there were not friendly especially the guy at the register! He didn't greet me, I asked where can I find a fork he pointed to the table to his left and then when he rang everything up he didn't even tell me my total! LEGIT didn't say one word to me! So rude! I later seen another staff member ask him if he was ok, like maybe he was having a bad day. BUT I'm sorry, that behavior was unacceptable! I watched him do it the almost 45min-to a hour that I was there to every customer! I paid almost 60.00 in food!! So overpriced, for blah food, and it's not even kid friendly! $9.00 for one hotdog! Next time, I'm bring lunch and eating outside! \n\nOverall, we had a good time! We intended on going to pier 39 after but honestly, we were all drained and didn't have the energy. It's a all day trip.

So now that I am an adult and not a scientist it's nice to know that I left my inner little child that I left child in the walls of these museums.\n\nThe place is not just a museum, it is an Interactive Art and Science imagination feeding, curiosity sparking, propelled perception of experiences that make you realize how little in life you actually know. \n\nThe Exploratorium now caters to everyone. On certain nights they have the Exploratorium after Dark, sometimes they show presentations and documentaries and also a older crowd is here just in case you're the type of person who does not really like children....

It's one of the best interactive museums for family or as a single person, or maybe even a date night.\n\nYou can get parking across the street I'm not too sure but maybe they do validate, if you visit the museum. At times the place can be overcrowded so plan accordingly to when you want to go. \n\nIf you are a teacher you can sign online and GET FREE entrance admission.

(There, that should secure my Elite status for next year, right Steph?)  My significant review is the most unusual major museum in San Francisco.\n\nThe Exploratorium is a \"please touch me\" museum, geared especially for upper elementary kids and suitable for all.  The ticket prices are in line with other museums in The City, and there are free days throughout the year.  Located a half mile up the waterfront from the Ferry Building.  Parking is a major issue, as is typical in SF.  It is absolutely fitting for an entire morning, afternoon, or even day, to center around a visit to the Exploratorium.\n\nScience is king here, and the Exploratorium shows the practical & fun side of science.  Kids see physics in action, natural demonstrations, psychological experiments, and musical interludes.  But no boring lectures, nosirree.  Here's a very small sample, based on what my daughter did:\n* Felt five different kinds of rain, from a light drizzle in San Francisco to a heavy downpour in Durban\n* Saw why you shouldn't always trust your feelings as we played a \"Let's Make A Deal\" game of which door the prize is behind\n* Learned exactly where to place the beach ball so that the air current keeps it in the air all the time\n* Heard how a musical score can tell a completely different story to a movie depending on its style\n* Created her own tornado\n* Shared an echo chamber with her dad;  she tweeted like a bird while I shouted Scripture\n* Laughed when (and because) she saw a video of other people laughing\n* Got a video of her expression when she was startled by a puff of air in her face\n* Stuck her finger in a machine that told of her emotional state when different questions were read\nBut wait, there's more - so much more!\n\nShe had been to the Exploratorium on a school field trip.  I last went to the Exploratorium when it was at the Palace of Fine Arts.  It was worth a second visit.  And would also be worth many more visits.

I didn't really think it would be particularly exciting to be honest. Some cool science things, maybe a couple of neat exhibits... probably something to run through in maybe 45-60minutes tops.\n\nWhat ensued was over three hours of fun, an unwillingness to leave, and an urge to go back again. This interactive museum, is it really a museum though?, provides for fun of all ages with really cool interactive ...well... everything. Learn about weather systems, learn about death, learn about lighting, learn about sound, learn how to walk quietly, learn about kinetic movement. Everywhere you go is an interactive learning experience that really immerses you in the entire experience.\n\nThe one complaint I had was that the kids would often just run over to a cool exhibit and just start to play around with it - the concept of lines seemed to escape many of them. And I get it, at the end of the day the museum is probably geared more towards kids but there were some really cool things that I wanted to try and do but so did a lot of kids and they kept rushing to the exhibit and pushing me out. It would not be becoming to push the kids out of the way in situations like this. So, if you're an adult, and going only with adults, I would recommend going on an \"Adult's Night\" or whatever equivalent event they may have (and if they don't have one, they need one!).\n\nOtherwise, I was seriously blown away and even though I spent several hours in the museum I feel like it was totally worth my time. Even if you're just visiting SF, for the first time or the one hundredth time, this is totally worth the stop, especially since it's right along the pier and you can get a great view of the city.\n\nEverything about this place is perfect and - if you're into Instagram or cool social media photos - you'll definitely manage to get many good ones here.", "author": "John T."}

In my mind, the Exploratorium is the perfect example of art + technology. A lot of the exhibits, while scientific, also have an artistic element to them. Plus there's something for everyone (assuming you like some form of science) - their exhibits cover topics from light, sound, social science, mechanics, physics, electronics, biology and geology.\n\nSome memorable exhibits (there's a ton of them) are the toilet fountain, the toothpick sculpture held together by glue, the monochromatic room, and the dry ice comets. One example of a great interactive exhibit is this booth where you have to step over gravel but make the least amount of noise (super hard). Another one has you play with an infared camera and a shadow box camera. It's all good, creative fun.\n\nThe location is also convenient. It's super easy to get to via public transportation - you can take the F line from Market St to get here. Or if you plan on parking, the Golden Gateway garage has a good rate of $8 for a whole weekend day (it's within walking distance). If you're looking for food, just walk along the pier towards the Ferry Plaza Market for lunch/dinner before or after!\n\nSure you may think admission is pricey, but I think you get your money's worth as there's more to do and it's (IMO) better than the California Academy of Sciences, the Tech Museum in San Jose, and the Pacific Science Center in Seattle (I'm a science museum nut). They have free days that are posted on their website as well as discounted Thursday nights for adults only. I can give a quick review on each of those visits:\n\n- After Dark (Thursday in August): For $15 on Thursday Evenings the Exploratorium is only open to adults - it's a hip and relaxing atmosphere. No kids to hog the exhibits and crowds of people to weave through. Literally got to spend some time playing with some of my fav exhibits. It's a great place to bring a date to, since there's a lot to see or do. Even if the date sucks you can at least have fun looking at things. They even serve alcohol, which in some cases makes the exhibits more entertaining.\n\n- Free Community Day (Sat in September): The weather was super nice, but there was a long line to get in. They limit the number of people in the building at once and would let people in as people left - luckily my sis and I only ended up standing outside for ~15-20 min, and this was when Pokemon Go was popular so we had something to do while waiting. =P The inside was REALLY crowded... it was little hard to get to play with any of the exhibits because the children took priority. Walking through the hall with all the electrical activities was difficult. Hell a fight almost broke out between a mom and a guy who pushed her kid off an exhibit.\n\n- Free Community Day (Sun in January): Weather was cold and rainy... unlike the last free day I went to, there was hardly a line to get in and it was much less crowded than the Sept visit. Guess Bay Area folks are afraid from the rain (but not this couple from Seattle!). Still a lot of people compared to the After Dark visit, but more manageable. I got to play with more of the exhibits too, though the kids were still obnoxious at times.\n\nIf you want to come here an have to the capability of going on a Thursday... do it. Great way to meet people. If you're a cheap ass like me and want to go on their Free Days, just be mentally prepared for the crowds. Otherwise I highly recommend people visit this museum - it's great.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

This was by far the best museum I've ever been too - it is completely different from a traditional museum, in that every exhibit has an interactive educational experience. This place is good for all ages. I could come here every week just to show different friends this cool experience. \n\nThis is also a great place for a date! You won't have awkward silences or get bored because of all the activities and people around you. This shoukd not only be a tourist spot, but also a local favorite. We are so lucky to have such a unique museum in the bay area!", "author": "Darrell T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "Love this museum! It's perfect for all ages, even younger kids. You can play and interact with all of the exhibits because there's no tape on the floor telling you to stay three feet away. Summers are always packed with people lining up to play with the exhibits. During the school day, classrooms from around the bay usually visit in groups. If you're looking to play with each of the exhibits, go on a weekday to avoid the crowd. \n\nThe museum is divided into different subjects, including a psychology, physics, art, vision, biology, and an observatory section. The view is amazing, especially from the observatory located in the back. There's a great view of the Bay bridge and downtown San Francisco. Watch the ocean for a bit and you will likely see some sea otters frolicking in the Bay. \n\nMy favorite part of the museum is the tinkering studio. I was able to make a toy and take it home. The explainers in the area walked me through how to make the toy. \n\nThe restaurant in the museum has good food, especially the ramen. It's pricey, but it's better than your average museum food. If you're looking to explore more of San Francisco, Pier 39 is a fifteen minute walk away along the pier or Embarcadero which is a ten minute walk. \n\nThis is also a great museum for adults, especially on Thursday nights where entrance is 18+, and drinks for 21+. The first Thursday of each month is also themed. \n\nThey also offer some free days throughout the year, so look out for those.\n\nTLDR; Go the Exploratorium, you won't regret it!!", "author": "Sophia L."}

I didn't know what to really expect from this place, but what I got was hours of fun--even for an adult!\n\n-- GETTING THERE --\nThe easiest way to get here is to catch the F bus to Pier 15, at the Ferry Station stop. Or you could walk 15-20 minutes from there to Pier 15.\n\n-- TIME NEEDED TO EXPLORE --\nI came around 4 pm on a Thursday. I was warned by the ticketing guy that they were closing at 5 for one hour and I should come back at 6 pm for the 18+ crowd which opens until 10 pm, because as he said, \"there is no way you will have time to do everything in one hour.\"\n\nI came back the next day instead around 5 pm, which would've given me at least five hours. The ticketing guy was right, you need at least, *at least*, three to four hours here to truly enjoy everything the Exploratorium has to offer.\n\n-- EXPLORING --\nI first walked in expecting museum exhibits of sorts. What this place is is a large collection of mini interactive exhibits that teaches you something about the world: about physics, science, art, math, nature, and other things. They teach you in a way that feels fresh, fun, and interactive. The exhibits themselves are created by hand in their workshop at the location.\n\nIt wasn't too crowded when I went so everyone was able to individually explore each piece until they were done; there was hardly any waiting as you could go interact with another exhibit while waiting on another.\nTheir special exhibit during this time was the \"Strandbeest.\" You may have seen these skeletal-like \"creatures\" moving on their own along the beach while being powered by the wind. Check out YouTube for videos. They had a large creature on display which moved around; this one was powered by pressured air.\n\n-- GIFT SHOP --\nThe gift shop has a large selection of toys, games, books, and other things to inspire art and science in a young or older mind. I got myself some lenticular postcards and some Bornite \"peacock\" rocks that give off an iridescent shimmer.\n\n-- SUMMARY --\nI think I went through and explored about 90% of the exhibits that interested me--and there are *a lot*. You will need time to explore all these things. You don't want to feel rushed so plan the time for it. I certainly took my time and thoroughly enjoyed experiencing all the wonders of the Exploratorium. Recommended for kids and adults.", "author": "Benjamin B."}

No way you can get through this place in one day, so don't even try. Time flies by quicker than you can imagine, before you know it 4 hours will have gone by in a flash.\n\nI can't imagine what this place is like on a weekend. My sister, dad and I went on a Monday afternoon and it was already pretty packed. Thankfully there's both a grab and go cafe and a sit-down restaurant if you get hungry or need a break from all that learning.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Get your exploring pants on, open your eyes and prepare your brain to absorb loads of information all while having a blast.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

It's not just a science museum, its exhibits cover a wide spectrum of topics ranging from human behavior to astronomy to languages to human anatomy...  Don't forget to get out onto the patio to tinker with more unusual musical instruments or go to the rooftop and look through the live camera of the harbor.  The breathtaking view of the harbor is enough to waste an afternoon on.

They have interactive stations everywhere that explore different topics. Although you could check out the stations as an adult, you have to keep in mind that the seats and stations are at a kid's eye-level and you'll have to crouch down for many of the activities. The topics are also fairly basic, but some are interesting!\n\nThe special exhibit, Strandbeest, was surprisingly really cool. I walked around the huge structures and read about how these \"animals\" move. There was also a live demonstration of one of the Strandbeests walking! Super cool!\n\nI came here because I got free admission, but I would say that it is overall not worth it for adults if you have to pay the $30 admission. I suggest the museum having some sort of discount for adults if they're just bringing in kids. Otherwise, if you're 18+ and want a chance to check out the stations without having kids swarming everywhere and cutting you in line, go to the Exploratorium After Dark on Thursday evenings instead.", "author": "Winnie Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-23", "description": "If you are into science and interactive exhibits, the Exploratorium will absolutely be HEAVEN for you. \n\nI've had the opportunity of visiting this SF museum twice during the past few years on their quarterly free days (they generally have 4 free days a year, including one that's always on pie day). Note that there's always going to be heavy traffic on such days and it will be slightly slower on normal days. \n\nWhen coming to the Exploratorium, I recommend coming on Sundays because meters do NOT charge you for parking on church days (lol). Though there's going to be more cars around, not paying anything beats paying like $5 an hour for parking right? \n\nIn normal museums, you can probably see every attraction and get tired within 2-3 hours. But here at the Exploratorium, you can literally spend the WHOLE DAY exploring (no pun intended) everything that this place has to offer. That's because each exhibit is 100% hands on and you will probably take 5 minutes at each place to 1. wait in line for your turn 2. experience the exhibit and 3. wrap your head around what's going on. That's like what, 12 exhibits in one section of the museum, multiplied by at least 5 or 6 different sections at Exploratorium. And that doesnt include the time you are going to spend playing snake for hours!\n\nSome of the really popular places at the Exploratrium in my opinion that you must see before its early closing time (5pm) include the tactile dome, optical allusion area, the stop motion section, as well as the \"sharing\" area. The last one in particular is pretty cool because there's this famous contraption where you get to explore the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nOverall, I guarantee that the Exploratorium is going to be a boatload of fun if you like touching things and learning about science. The price is $30 a person and I personally believe that's more than worth the experience you get here. In comparison, tickets for attractions such as the Monterey Aquarium can be $50 for an adult and I believe the experience is nothing like what you'd get at the Exploratorium. Also, if you are 21+, tickets are $15 for the After Dark exhibits.\n\ntl;dr If you are in SF, you must explore Exploratorium.", "author": "Bryan W."}

I know there's a lot of reviews already on this place so instead of telling you exactly what's inside let me summarize the parts I liked and didn't like and leave it up to you if you want to come explore.\n\nIn the plus column: \n-Not far of a walk from Ferry Bldg. If you can make your way to the Embarcadero Center, then your within walking distance of the Pier 15. It goes by fairly fast, but with little ones you might want to pay for bicycle taxi. Bring cash for that. Problem is they only seem to be around on weekends only. Bring snacks! If the kitchen is down at Exploratorium no food places until your back near Ferry Bldg.  Or your kid might not like what's offered at Exploratorium then that short walk back to Ferry Bldg. feels enormous with younger ones in tow.\n\n-Lots of interactive displays. Interesting for all ages. Maybe best 5+ years of age. Noise level high in the front, gets quieter the deeper into the museum you go.\n\n-You could spend a whole afternoon here. There is almost too much information to take in, in one trip. Membership is worth it if you plan to go 2-3 a year. Otherwise, once a year is enough for me, but there's also other cool museums to visit, so I don't know how often we'll be coming back. \n\nIn the negative column:\n\n-Extremely popular place. They seem to have no limit on how many people they let in. Try to not get offended when some rude kid hijacks your kids spot in front of a display. Parents these days seem to like to let there kids go free range, and not willing to teach their kids to wait their turn. Can be aggravating at times.  \n\n-It's kind of dark in certain spots in the museum to see certain displays better. However, the net effect is I felt very tired after 2 hours of straining my eyes.

Find out with a game that tests the phenomenon known as change blindness!\n\nGallery 2 - Tinkering:\nLearn about electricity and magnetism, and see how fast you can pedal a machine that powers various devices. Watch water freeze in a vacuum, and even float atop a column of air! Check out Rolling Through the Bay, a huge toothpick sculpture of many Bay Area landmarks.\n\nGallery 3 - Seeing and Listening:\nFool your sense of perception with the Ames Room. Try shooting hoops while wearing funky glasses that distort your vision. Hear sound through vibrations in a metal rod. Step into a room where everything appears monochromatic because certain wavelengths of light have been removed. Seeing is believing, but don't believe everything you see!\n\nGallery 4 - Living Systems:\nWatch as man-made geysers erupt, play a shell guessing game with a friend, watch a talk at the Explainer Station, and learn about plants and insects with natural exhibits.\n\nGallery 5 - Outdoor Exhibits:\nIt's easy to miss this gallery since it's outside. See models of Bay Area bridges, learn about tides, listen to a 27-foot harp strummed by wind, climb into a rickshaw camera obscura, and more.\n\nGallery 6 - Observing Landscapes:\nWatch as miniature sand dunes are shaped by wind in an aeolian landscape. Look at digital information including historic earthquake activity and population growth projected onto a relief map of the Bay Area. See a live view of the Bay Bridge projected onto a table via a camera obscura. The Fisher Bay Observatory on this level has a lot to offer for those interested in geology and ecology.\n\nHere are some logistics to help you plan your visit:\n* The Exploratorium website lists parking options, including validated parking\n* The closest BART station is Embarcadero, a 0.6 mile walk away\n* Lockers on site cost 50 cents to use, and are large enough to store a backpack\n* If you want a preview/reminder of what all the exhibits look like, the entire Exploratorium is viewable on Google Street View!\n\nYou can easily spend a whole day here and still not have time to interact with every exhibit. Best to come early, because the place gets way crowded in the afternoon. Have fun!", "author": "Anson W."}

I have very clouded memories of the original location when it was at the Palace of Fine Arts.  I was still in grade school, but I do remember having a blast and being so fascinated with all the exhibits.  Fast forward many years later to its move to Pier 15 which is a much larger venue and more easily accessible to reach since it's right on the Embarcadero.  When it finally re-opened, my inner-grade school-self really got excited about it.  Probably because I haven't gone back since that time.  Well, after being a member for the last few years since it reopened, it's become quite an interesting hangout for me.\n\nBecause I haven't visited the Exploratorium since I was back in grade school a lot of the exhibits all seemed brand new to me.  There's so much ground to cover!\n\nHere's a brief gallery of some of my favorite exhibits:\n\nThe Fog Bridge -- http://bit.ly/1KmyjFo\n\nThe Tinkering Clock -- http://bit.ly/1gqodvi\n\nIlluminated Fog -- http://bit.ly/1OXnQEw\n\nThe Kaleidescope -- http://bit.ly/1MbfOHD (photo credit to Danah W.)\n\nThe Concave Mirror -- http://bit.ly/1KpxgZB (photo credit to Danah W.)\n\nThe Toothpick Exhibit -- http://bit.ly/1igDobC\n\nOther cool exhibits to check out that I don't have pics of are the Tactile Dome, the Shadow Box, the Pressure Geysers, and Fog Ring Maker.  Of course, all of these are just a mini sample of exhibits that The Exploratorium.  \n\nBecause I'm a member, I like how I can always just drop by whenever and move at a slow pace with each exhibit.  There is definitely no possible way you'll be able to cover all the exhibits in one day, unless you're The Flash.  And Member Nights are awesome!  They're the least crowded of times and they have a lot of live exhibits, speakers, and sometimes they even have free food.  Another cool thing to note is that my membership is a Dual Explorer, so I can always bring a guest with me for free. It's been a great perk for me to bring people who've never experienced it before.  And they always seem to have great responses.\n\nThe Exploratorium is definitely a place you want to check out if whether you're visiting SF or even if for locals like me.  There are plenty of things to see and do here and you can spend a lot of time here.  And trust on this when I say that you'll feel like a kid again when tinkering with the exhibits.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Since we are a family of 5, I got the family membership for just $25ish more. I'm glad I did! We were there for about 3.5 hours and there was still so much to look at and do! Definitely recommend the museum - had a lot to keep kids of all ages and their parents busy! My kids are 9, 11, and 14 and all were engaged. Hubs and I had lots to check out too.

This isn't your father's Exploratorium!  \n\nMoving from the long time home and previous digs near the Palace of Fine Arts, the Exploratorium has settled in an expansive and brand spanking new space on Pier 15, just a short walking distance from the Ferry Building and the waterfront.  The gorgeous views of the Bay, the multi-level floors of activities and exhibits, and even the cafeteria represent an updated and modern museum experience that is probably unmatched elsewhere in the Bay Area.  \n\nWhile admissions prices are on the higher side and you would also have to compare with the also excellent Academy of Sciences, I'm not sure the two are even the same as I found the Exploratorium to be much more massive and to almost have an endless amount of exhibits.  The fact that each exhibit is based upon science is perhaps icing on the cake and the large space makes it seem that even on weekends there are definitely outdoor areas or upper floor areas that still don't feel that crowded especially compared to all the other Bay Area alternatives that most have gone too.  \n\nI'd say the perfect audience is probably for school age kids, but there's plenty of activities for those young at heart as well.  \n\nPerhaps the best part was after a busy morning and a plan to walk to the very crowded Ferry Building for lunch on a sunny weekend day, we stumbled upon the Exploratorium Cafe.  Yes, prices are a bit high.  But the variety of food (Humphry Slocombe!  Sashimi!  Mary's Chicken!  Udon!  Fish and Chips!) they served as well as the quality and convenience were all up there that I think it was the perfect match for the museum.  I like the Academy of Sciences but I think I was overall more impressed with the space and food here than I was over there.

It's a 330,000 sq ft. center located at Pier 15 at The Embarcadero.  \n\nWe got there two hours before closing time on Sunday and that wasn't nearly enough time to discover all the place had to offer.  We probably made it 1/4 of the way through. \n \nThe place is filled with science experiments.  As you walk through the space you can try, touch and fiddle with everything.  Most of the exhibits I saw were related to physics and kinematics.  There were toddlers, elementary aged children and teens; all of them were engaged in play...a lot of the parents were too.  \n\nI didn't see any information with the exhibits to explain how/why they worked.  The children were too busy exhibit hopping to read anyway.  A place like this sparks their curiosity about why things work instead of giving them textbook information.  If they think something is cool enough they'll probably be inspired to figure out the science behind it later.  \n  \nOne of the most popular displays was the water fountain near the entrance.  Yes, a water fountain.  It looked like a functioning commode.  You had to lean into the toilet bowl to take a drink.  Needless to say this was the big photo op.  \n\nMy favorite exhibit was the millisecond photography booth.  It let you photograph the moment when a drop of water fell into a puddle of water.  Setting and resetting the timer (in milliseconds) produced unique water splashes that looked like art.  You could see the resulting images on a TV screen and they were just beautiful!\n\nI didn't love everything.  I saw lots of hand to mouth coughing and nose wiping followed by exhibit play.  Naturally the youngest children have no concept of germs but it's still gross.  It would be great to see a few hand sanitizer stations set up throughout the space like they have on cruise ships since everyone touches the same exhibits.  \n\nThis would be the ultimate science field trip destination.  If I'd visited a place like this at an early age I might have gone the STEM route because I would have thought science was interesting and fun instead of a complete bore.  \n\nI would recommend this unique experience to anyone.

There are a ton of children and families when you first enter the museum so you have to constantly wait to see a display. If you start at the back, there are less people. \n- Almost every display is interactive in some way and it's just so much fun to actually do something hands-on in a museum. There's also an outdoor portion with equally fantastic and interactive displays! \n- The signs that explain the exhibits are very good at breaking down scientific concepts and walking you through how to work with said exhibit/display.

They had an exhibit where you can manipulate different variables to see what would happen if you stopped one wheel or try and stop both wheels.

It had been fun checking out all the hands on exhibits and invoked a certain nostalgia of school trips and a simpler time. Fast forward to the present day and it's new location at Pier 15 and not only are the tried and true original exhibits in play but there are also newer and more modern wonders to have fun with!\nThe new location is impressive and the spirit of learning and fun remains intact. Every little corner features a new hands-on discovery that both kids & adults will learn from and enjoy. One caveat to that is that it does get pretty crowded and some of the more popular exhibits have queues forming. The interactive nature of the Exploratorium requires patience as others are having their fun and some overall common courtesy to others around you. \nAt $30 a person it's an investment,  but worth visiting every few years to see what's new & have fun with old faves. If you don't mind walking, it's very easy to walk here from the BART Embarcardero station (20 minutes or less) and a scenic walk past the Ferry Building and waterfront. \nI'd like to check out the Exploratorium after Dark event where it is adults only-more play time for me!

Very hands-on museum!\n\nI took my friend here since I was given two free tickets. Admission usually would be $15. I parked across the building and came here After Dark hours which was after 6 pm. Luckily, I found a parking spot which offered only 25 cents / hour! It was near the news station building.\n\nIf you have any bags or items that you don't want to carry, the Exploratorium has lockers which you could rent out. The lockers are pretty big so don't worry about it.\n\nWhat's really cool with the Exploratorium is that you could drink while you go around the museum! The bartender makes some really good margaritas!\n\nMy favorite activity in this museum was the activity where you have to walk across pebbles and you have to do it as quiet as possible. Another notable activity was when you get to choose up to four colors and you move this table back and forth and it creates some really cool pictures.\n\nThis is a great place to take friends who don't live around the area and I highly suggest going!", "author": "Aj C."}

While you may think this is a place just for kids, we had a blast there, and we were so disappointed when they shut down the lights and all the exhibits at 5:00...we wanted to stay there longer!  \n\nInitially, we were a bit hesitant to go inside because it's $29.00/adult, which we thought was expensive at the moment.  We weren't sure if it was just for kids, especially with elementary school students stampeding out of the museum around 2:00.  However, we briefly looked at the yelp reviews and decided to just go for it.  We were both so glad we took a chance with this place!  \n\nTIP: If you're a student, it'll be $24/person.  If you can make it on a Thursday night, they have an awesome Night at the Exploratorium for $15/person from 6-10pm.  If I stayed on a Thursday, I would definitely go here at this time because it's such a great deal!\n\nFirst off, this place is hands-on for every exhibit.  While we felt like we had to wash our hands every few exhibits, this place is well-kept and very clean for the most part.  \n\nThe Exploratorium has six sections: (1) Human Phenomena (social behavior/psychology), (2) Tinkering (building things with your hands, (3) Seeing & Listening (light, vision, sound, and hearing), (4) Living Systems (organisms and ecosystems), (5) Outdoor Exhibits (winds, tides, and natural phenomena, and (6) Observing Landscapes.      \n\nIf you go with one other person, you can do activities with each other.  We did one where one person reads a card, and the other person has his/her hand in clip that detects if you're excited or not.  Our favorite room was in the human phenomena section where you go in a room and there's different changing lights that trace your body.  Definitely stayed in there for a long time acting silly lol.  We also enjoyed an exhibit where you try to walk across gravel and stay the quietest among your friends.  \n\nIf you want to take your time, go from open to close (10am-5pm), but I think we had more space and ability to play with the exhibits because we went on a weekday in the late afternoon so that the school children had already left at that point.  I would love to go back to this place.  I highly recommend spending an afternoon here with anyone of all ages!  I saw a cute family where a dad was teaching his daughter about science.  What a fun way to teach/learn and bond as a parent-child :)", "author": "Catherine K."}

My mom and my sister were walking the piers the day prior and planned to visit Exploratorium the following day without knowing it be free. That being said, I don't think this place advertises free days, for obvious reasons. I'd like to thank UNIQLO for sponsoring this free event. They really made my vacation to San Fran much better!\n\nDue to the fact that it was a free event, the place was so packed! I hardly was able to tinker with the little activities spread throughout the building because so many people were using them. Despite that, I still had a great time. \n\nThis was a place where adults, such as myself, are excused to act like little kids again. There were quite a few interesting things here that I learned or refreshed my memory on from my college days. You should really check out the Social Psychology section. There's a lot about us, humans, that you don't know -- or probably already do.\n\nThe attached store is full of interesting gadgets targeted toward children. Adults would find it cool, too, but can wind up as junk in the long haul. They do have some books there I wanted to purchase, but I knew I would not read them when I got home. If you have kids, you should definitely invest in some of their books here. I mean, you're kids will learn a lot if they're open to science. Nerds in the making.

He invited me to the Exploratorium's Member Holiday Party, and I jumped at the chance to see it at night.\n\nThe Exploratorium has a different vibe for nighttime activities.  First of all, there are generally more adults and fewer kids around.  That makes it a little quieter inside.  It's also much darker of course, but that makes any illumination really stand out.  There were two huge rhombus-shaped LED displays overhead which put on a colorful and festive show.\n\nI loved every moment of the party.  We grabbed some pretzel snacks and Clif bars on our way to a delicious chicken tinga bowl served with salad, rice, beans, and tortilla chips. Needless to say, the dining area was packed with guests.  My friends had been to member events before so they knew to make a beeline for the food.  I just followed their lead.\n\nIf you are at the back and head upstairs, you can see the lights of the Bay Bridge from the outside viewing platform.  That area was covered over with clear plastic tarps, so it's not as cold out there as you might think.  There was a nice woman softly playing the ukulele in the shadows.  I thought it made for excellent mood music.\n\nI like how restrooms are always nearby.  They are located at the front, middle and back of the Exploratorium, and there is one upstairs as well.

Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling that great, and we were on a schedule, so my son and I only stayed a couple of hours, and got to interact with maybe only 1/3 of the exhibits.  His favorite was the marble run, but sheer range of demonstrations of science is amazing. \n\nI didn't check out the menu at the cafe, so I don't know what the vegan options looked like (what I did see is some highly questionable hotdogs), but there's a great area outside with some exhibits and picnic benches if you bring your own lunch, which is probably recommended due to the likely food prices.  \n\nYou definitely need to go once, and go early.", "author": "Peter N."}

I highly suggest coming here when the doors open because this will be a full day trip! Now since this place is really popular, expect many many kids to be here as well as kids on a field trip also.\nNow the cool thing about this place is you CAN bring your own lunch so pack some goodies!\nThis place is divided in so many parts that you might get really overwhelmed with it!\nBefore you enter, to your right will be the gift shop and cafe. Gift shop is huge and full of cool things you can buy so perhaps it might be best to stop by that prior to going in the museum.\nNow as you enter you will see numerous interactive science exhibitions! Go ahead and play with them to your heart's content! The different areas they have here is science, sound, lights, sea, nature, illusions, mechanical exhibition.\nThe first area you see is where most of the people hang around and as you venture in further, the people seem to weed out.\nThe reason I say head in at 10AM because the hours seem to whizz by as you are trying different science projects! Be mindful though people, don't be a douche. There are people waiting to try exhibition so don't try and jump ahead of the line. ESPECIALLY you parents that let their kids run at the project when there are other people clearly waiting. So don't be THAT parent with THAT kid.\nAnyways the most popular exhibitions are the toilet water fountain, the tornado fog, the vapor , the upside down mirror, the small/large room, the two seat communicators, monochrome room, the light section, the metal needles, the whale tube, the color room, the engine starter. \nThose are just a few to name. There are much more exhibitions to see that it will be impossible to name all of them.\nIt's an amazing place to spend the day in. Just be weary that cool spherical exhibition where you can enter, charges about $10, so that will be an additional charge.\nThis is only good for a one time visit to be honest.

In fact, just drench your entire body in hand sanitizer ya filthy bastard. lol. jk. ;)\n\nMy most memorable activity was the cow eye dissection presentation. The volunteers conducting the demonstration were high schoolers, and I was quite impressed. They were very good -- informative, engaging, and even offered hands on activities to the younger spectators. I wish I had the opportunity to play and learn, or even teach eyeballs when I was at that age. I learned about the anatomy of the eye when I was in my twenties, and dissection of (animal) body parts slowly followed. I am a current healthcare provider, so I enjoyed watching \"future\" healthcare providers taking charge of their future -- or so I thought. Those teenie boopers, aren't even interested in the health field! Upon further discussion, I learned that they (yes, both of them) want to go into engineering! Bastards! lol. jk. It's okay though. Everyone goes into the health care, eventually. It's better to figure it out early on, but oh well. It will happen, and they will just have to learn the hard way. ;)\n\nOne thing I do want to note is the expensive entrance fee, and standard museum hours. If you plan to visit, plan accordingly. You don't want to pay a pretty penny, and not have enough time to thoroughly enjoy the museum.

Tons of information and ways to prove the information via interaction.  \n\nI LOVED the shadow room.  Actually my favorite although when I first walked in there I had no idea what it was about.  All of a sudden I see a timer counting down so I am looking at it to see what's going to happen and FLASH!! I'M BLIND FOREVER!! My goodness that was like the flash a camera taking a night picture of earth from out of space (outer space?) would need.  I responded with what I assume was a ridiculously funny face because everyone including my children were hysterically laughing at my reaction.  Well after that first introduction to this outer space flash I realized that you stand against the wall in whatever pose you want and wait for the flash.  Then you move out of the way to see your shadow on the wall.  Pretty darn cool and we spent some time in there making all kinds of interesting poses.  Many other rooms that worked with body movement and those were cool to me too.\n\nThey had a few things I never saw at the other place and one of the things I saw as we were ending our day there was this area with information about \"mental illness\".

So I ended a spectacular time there in tears but not all bad.\n\nWe also visited their little restaurant and I was really surprised because it was all gourmet food and everything was fresh and delicious.  Some of the staff there wasn't very friendly (that cashier) but the woman behind the salad counter (I believe she was a chef) was an absolute pleasure.  The one behind the pasta area was ok and so was the guy in the sushi area.  The food was not cheap but... when visiting these places I am way too familiar with getting a thing or two and paying big bucks.  The difference here was that it was quality food and so it was worth it.  \n\nI believe every child should experience this place at least once.  Every adult should too.  There is so much to learn but because of the way it's set up children just see the fun part without feeling they are being schooled.\n\n**FANTASTIC place for a child in the Autism spectrum that likes to touch things or see how things respond.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-29", "description": "Having been to several other science museums in SoCal and New York, I'd say this is my favorite one. It goes beyond kiddie stuff like \"what are waves\" and \"how do solar panels work\"; plenty of the material requires advanced understanding to fully appreciate, yet can nonetheless be enjoyed by young kids.\n\nFor example, one of the exhibits involves an inverted pendulum. At the right is an inverted pendulum which challenges the visitor to move it left and right, trying to keep it up. However, this is a very difficult task for a human to do. At the left, there is an inverted pendulum controlled by a robotic arm driven an AI algorithm. It is so good at what is does that even if the pendulum is allowed to fall (e.g. by a human pushing over the pendulum), it is able to swing it back into position. To a child, this is a cool robot trick. To someone who studied CS in college, this is an example of reinforcement learning. Actually, when taking CS 229 at Stanford, we wrote a Matlab program to solve this exact problem. Of course, we were only running it on a simulator and our algorithm did a lot worse than the one in the museum, but it's nice to see something you've learned put into practice.\n\nAnother example (albeit more high-school level) is a ramp where you can launch balls from various heights, and the distance traveled by the balls is the square root of the height from which they were launched. From high-school physics, we know that the trajectory of a ball in the air is a parabola, so the maximum height attained (which is equal to the height from which it was launched, minus negligible effects of friction and air resistance) is proportional to the square of the horizontal distance traveled.\n\nOther cool exhibits include a picture on a screen that changes in a subtle way every few seconds. Normally, our eyes detect such changes very easily, but when you insert a blank frame in between, it's hard to notice the difference unless you happened to be staring at the right spot at the right moment. There is also a station where you can listen to multiple recorded conversations at the same time, and most people realize that they can only pay attention to one conversation at a time. There is also an outside area with a rain generator.\n\nDespite its relatively small size, this museum has lots of things to do. (It's also surprisingly hard to navigate, even with a map.) Come with the whole family or solo or with friends. It'll be a blast.\n\n89/100", "author": "Tony J."}

The Exploratorium is now housed among the Piers along the Embarcadero Waterfront. Not only is this location in such a prime SF area with views casting out into the bay, parallel to the skyscrapers in the Financial District, but it's what's inside that truly is a marvel!\n\nThe scientific discoveries of the centuries have fascinated scientists and nerdlings alike, bringing together the most creative mindsets and sparking the scientific revolution. This has shaped our present and is rapidly taking us into the unknown and vast, cosmic future. \n\nThere have been so many interesting scientists and fictional characters that we associate with invention and revolution. Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, even Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde or the mad scientist who created Frankenstein. This allows a spark for curiosity and paves the way for great inventions. \n\nHere at the Exploratorium, you can view scientific accomplishments in action, you can test drive experiments for yourself, and you can also learn how these different scientific principles apply to our day to day lives. \n\nFor those of you still awake at this point, I shall continue. \n\nThe father of AC electricity, Nikola Tesla, was a Croatian inventor who moved to America in the late 19th century. He showed the world how AC electricity was the way of the future. The exhibit, \"The Electric Flame,\" here at the Exploratorium, demonstrates how electricity can jump from one electrical node to another, creating a bluish colored flame. This verrrry same style of flame was used when Frankenstein was created. \n\nZAAAP! It's ALIVE!!!\n\nYou are able to generate this flame for yourself at \"The Electric Flame\" exhibit. Fun tidbit: AC electricity also powers every house in America and worldwide. Think of all your electronic gizmos. \n\nAnother cool exhibit demonstrated how Aurora Borealis aka Northern Lights came to be. Definition: Auroras are created by charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, entering the atmosphere from above causing ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents, and consequent optical emissions. \n\nFor those of you who understood as much of that as I did, then a simpler definition is greatly needed. I shall attempt it. Soooo... small electrically charged thingys go high into the sky and collide with other electrically charged thingys and then KABLAM! Ooooh Ahhhh. Beautiful colors of green, blue, and sometimes red, light up the Alaskan skies. Thus, Aurora Borealis is born. \n\nIf that isn't cool, I don't know what is.\n\nSo yeah, the Exploratorium is such an uberly awesome possum place to be!

Am I right? A $300 million makeover on a previously dilapidated pier didn't sound all that promising to me since I was not a great student in Miss Bigelow's science class, especially when I had to dissect a frog or present a dead bug collection when half my bugs were still alive but comatose. Now it's over three times larger than the original location (photo: http://bit.ly/13IXQD1), and since the Exploratorium's big move from the Palace of Fine Arts in April, it has really turned the museum into quite the \"It\" spot.\n\nThe Embarcadero setting has a lot to do it, and it's certainly more convenient to take the F-line to get here. Regardless, I was amazed at how packed it was a couple of weeks ago when Jamie W. and I were swimming upstream against the crowds going the other way (photo: http://bit.ly/155V0vT). We were able to enjoy it much more back at the end of March when the museum had a series of members-only nights, and only a handful of people were roaming the cavernous place that stretched for over 330,000 square feet. Over 600 exhibits are on display at any given time, a full quarter of which were built specifically for the new location.\n\nClearly the most engaging ones are interactive but in ways that feel retro and wizardly rather than technological.

If you don't love walking around with sticky, slimy, children who like to touch everything and sneeze on your kneecaps, then this is not the place for you. However, we all must live our lives and not be complete germ-a-phobes, so I'd say suck it up, bring some hand sanitizer, and giggle along with the kids. \n\nIt's slightly hard to navigate, and there is a lot going on, so plan on being there for a solid 3 hours if you want to get the full experience. Grab a map and read the signs, you'll make it out alive if you just follow your inner compass--unless your inner polarity is jacked, then I got nothing for you except a solid \"good luck\". \n\nYou're going to leave with all of your senses being completely stimulated, not remembering how you ended up where you did--so take photos and VIDEOS. It'll be worth going back through and watching them again. And if you're with \"that guy\" who was so overwhelmed that you found him huddled in the fetal position on your way out, you can go through your photos with him later so he doesn't miss out entirely. \n\nTIPS & TRICKS: \n* If you want your children to know you're the cool parent, bring them along. They will be in heaven, and the best part is that they'll ask you questions like, \"Why is it doing this? How does the sand move? Why is your face large in that mirror?\" And you'll quickly read the explanation (because let's face it, you really didn't know what the heck was happening either) and tell them in your own words. It is at this time that they'll leave thinking you are all-knowing, and will never question you, ever again. \n* Drink from the toilet drinking fountain. It's weird.", "author": "Haley N."}

To lessen your exposure to kids running amok, go to an After Dark event on Thursdays where it's adults only.  Not to say you won't run into an adult that has the same behavior.  On other days, since there are field trips, a week day is not necessarily your saving grace.  Show up early or after 3 and crowds typically thin out.  Saturdays and holidays are the most packed.

I was scared the same would happen to the exploratorium, one of my favorite museums in the Bay Area. \n\nI turned out to be 100% wrong. \n\nI visited the exploratorium for the first time since it reopened and I absolutely loved it. First off, they had more exhibits. I loved the observatory. Also, they expanded that bio science area. While I loved the first one, the new one was even better. Also, I liked their outside exhibits with the mist and the rain (although no one will be out there when it actually rains). But overall, what I liked the most was that they kept all exhibits from the old location. \n\nNow onto my favorite (or should I say most distracting) exhibits. \n\n2nd best kept secret: this exhibit showing overfishing had you text \"fish\" to a number so your boat would survive but not texting \"fish\" too much or the fish would go extinct. I still have fun texting that (including while writing this review).\n\nBest kept secret: Daisy, an AI computer program like siri that you can type conversations with, the program mixes up the words you type and creates new sentences. I love getting her to talk about certain topics and seeing how she responds. For example, I talked about how much I love USC sports and she kept saying \"Go USC!\" I even put in some mean girls quotes to see what she would do. She took the bait and kept saying fetch, even after I told her at least ten times to stop trying to make fetch happen. \n\nOverall, it was such an amazing visit.

They also have some sushi and i think a bar on the other side of the sushi. They had some interesting drink selections including a specialty root beer and a few varieties of jarritos. The view was really amazing  near the windows, with views of the bay bridge and other parts of the bay.\n\n\nThe exhibits:\nThe exhibits are way more spaced out now than the old location. Wide aisles made it easy to push our side by side stroller around. We just parked our stroller in the middle of the place and started to go around. I also liked that there were plenty of benches inside. The exhibits themselves were a little old for my kids. They enjoyed some of the tactics ones, the bubbles, some of the different lights and a few of the sound ones. I think they are way to young. A lot of exhibits have instructions that help you to understand what's going on. At a minimum maybe first grade so that a kid could read the instructions and then work the apparatus.

I loved the exhibits - they were all very educational and so interactive. However, I'm leaving a low rating because of my experience here. \n\nThis place is PACKED with screaming, yelling, crying, misbehaved kids running all around you. It completely ruined my visit. I would say the ratio of kids and their parents to lone adults here would be 80% to 20%. The kids here were so rowdy and loud and didn't seem like their parents were really watching them or cared what they did - even if they disturbed other patrons. The kids swarm all of the interactive exhibits and while you patiently wait your turn to use a display, 10 additional kids jump in when its your turn and their parents don't seem to care that you're waiting. You can wait all you want, you're never going to be able to see that exhibit you've been patiently waiting to use. Once you actually find an open exhibit, it won't stay that way for long. A wandering child will come up to that same exhibit and start touching all the pieces and pestering you while you're still finishing up and their parents won't come collect them.\n\nI think part of the onus is on the museum to inform potential patrons what to expect. If I had known the atmosphere would be so hectic and that it would be impossible to see any of the exhibits, I wouldn't have come. The other part of the weight falls on the parents that visit here. Parents didn't seem to care at all if their kids disturbed other patrons or cut in line. I've never seen such a huge amount of misbehaved kids in one space. All I know is that my mother would never have let me get away with that behavior when I was a kid. \n\nConsidering admission is $30 for one adult to get in, it kind of sucks when you can't use or see any of the exhibits. I really felt like I was in a daycare center or one of those play places in the mall. Additionally the exhibits didn't seem to be properly maintained given that children manhandle them all day. For example, some exhibits used sand and there was maybe a couple tablespoons of sand left by the time I passed by, and I got here at 11 or 12 in the morning. \n\nI regret not coming during the nighttime, adult only admissions.", "author": "Johanna H."}

You can easily spend 3 hours here, and still not see everything this place has to offer.\n\nAs mentioned, great for ALL ages, young to adult to elders, and a great place to use up time before a later Giants ball game.\n\nNote 1:  if you live in the number of \"bay area\" counties (check their website for specific mapped areas), admission tickets will be cheaper than it was for us coming out of Sacramento.  Next time I may call up an SF friend to purchase our online tickets, and just email them to us, but even without a discount, I would not hesitate to say the price was worth all that there is to do here at the Exploratorium.\n\nNote 2:  It pays for you beforehand to bring some snacks and snack drinks (juice packs, etc.) to consume DURING your visit, to carry you over until a later meal, unless you are willing to spend on their pricey restaurant or caf\u00e9 menu items.  We didn't, and were starving after 2-1/2 hours here (keep in mind, we drove 1-1/2 hrs from Sac also), but ended up having soup and sandwiches at Panera Bread just one long city block from AT&T park a few hours before the game.", "author": "Darrin K."}

Just saying, lots of strobe light action. But on the other hand, couldn't help but think this must be quite a trip for those partaking in hallucinogens!  \n \n- Budget 4 hrs as the museum is quite massive. We spent about 5 hrs there and only saw about 60% (on a holiday).\n\n- No coat check but they offer convenient lockers for only 50 cent!\n\n- There is a restaurant, cafe and food carts on site but the Ferry Bldg is a 10 min walk down the Embarcadero for more tasty treats.", "author": "Jeff F."}

There are so many exhibits and tons of hands on for kids.\nNow located at Pier 15, the place is spacious and doesn't feel crowded.  \n\nThe exhibits are so much better too.  They have office spaces, research areas and a development studio where you can see them build things, but not on Sundays.\nThere are 2 levels but the bulk of the exhibits are downstairs. \n\nThe restaurant inside is overpriced.  $24 for a whole roast chicken?  A cheese sandwich is almost $10. I tried the Tcho chocolate ice cream bar and it was delicious.  Also tried the root beer which was good too (off brand).  The cafeteria dining area has great views of the bay - a million dollar view.  You can go out and walk around to see the back side and watch the boats, ferries zip by.  We even sat a boat with \"pilot\" on the side of the boat, speeding towards the GG Bridge, likely a bar pilot heading to a ship to pilot it into the bay.  \n\nPier 15 used to be where goods from Asia and Europe were delivered.  You can see the name of the company that used to be there and the various doors where the ships with berth with their deliveries.  \n\nI highly recommend visiting the Exploratorium if you've not been there.

Take the Bart to the Embarcadero stop.  Or you can take the train and hop on the muni rail across the street.  My point is you should take transit if your kids allow for you to.  Plus!  For tourists, download one of our transportation apps like: Sidecar or lyft, cheaper than a taxi.\n\nPrice, adults $29, youth $24, kids $19.  Is it worth the money?  I'd say yes, because you can spend hours here.  I wouldn't go all the time myself, but if you have kids, this is a great place to expand their minds.

No dinosaurs,  no submarines, no nanotechnology, no food science.

The idea of meeting friends and their kids here on a Saturday made me twitchy, so I prepared to pretend to enjoy myself. \n\nThe Exploratorium brings it, no pretending needed. I had such a fun time, I didn't really notice or care that the place was crawling with kids. We arrived early and when we left mid-afternoon, the place seemed quite crowded to me. Our friends said it was nothing, many times there are lines four deep at most displays, My advice is to go early and on a weekday if possible, it's more fun when you're not waiting in line or rushed to move along.\n\nBeing from Chicago, we have a lot of great museums, but nothing quite like this. Almost every feature at the Exploratorium is designed to be up close and hands on. It's the total opposite of museum trips I recall as child where my favorite part was the plasticy sculpture you could buy at a vending machine. Here, I was constantly engaged in different ways. We spent nearly four hours there and didn't see everything there was to offer.\n\nAside from the museum, I was hugely impressed with the restaurant - Sea Glass. I'm used to dull, depressing overpriced museum cafeterias with hot dogs, cheese burgers, vending machines and very few options for the non-meat eater. Sea Glass steps hit up a notch, a big notch; you can get entrees, sides, sushi and booze. My partner-in-crime and I split a generous side of roasted brussel sprouts and quinoa chili. The culinary staff tasted the dish before serving it and made a few tweaks to make sure it was up par. Prices aren't cheap, but compared to what I normally expect at a museum I didn't feel cheated.\n\nIf you're a local or a visitor, have kids, are a big kid, or have the slightest interest in science and discovery, I highly recommend a trip to to the Exploratorium.\n\nTIP: The Tactile Dome books fast, call ahead and reserve your spot.

I came here using the San Francisco City Pass, which I definitely recommend.

There is an amazing amount of stuff to do in this deceptively small-looking building.\n\nWe decided to tackle the Exploratorium in section number order, so after filling our water bottle from a toilet in the entranceway, we headed to section 1, a cool social area full of two-person exhibits.  Then we played in my favorite part of any science museum, the physics section (here sections 2 and 3), where we got to build things and play with neat contraptions.  I wasn't huge on the biology section (4) or the outdoor exhibits (5), which were notable mostly in how we couldn't figure out how to get to them, but the terrace (6) held our absolute favorite part of the museum, a giant pinhole camera that you could go inside to watch boats going by in the bay.  We spent a surprising amount of time just watching the boats, and then running inside for paper and pencils to trace the dockyards across the bay.\n\nThe camera may have been the best part also because that part of the museum was so quiet -- we came in at the same time as at least two different field trip groups and ended up missing out on a lot of the different exhibits on the main floor (even though we were there for hours!) because there was continually a line of small children ahead of us.

I responded that I was taking photos and I feel that people need to mind their own business. Good to know that the people at the Exploratorium are looking out for this sort of thing but I also feel like they should be more professional about it. \n\nI think one of the coolest things about this place is that they build the interactive displays themselves. I liked the old location but I am starting to get used to the new location. \n\nMembership gives you access to member only nights. No crowds at all and some fun additions, like free juice and book launch activities when they publish a new book.\n\nFun for children, fun for adults and fun for adults with children, the place is huge and you can hardly take part in all the displays and activities in a single day.", "author": "Ben M."}

We were visiting San Francisco for a few days in August and decided to do the Exploratorium on adult night. It was bigger than we expected! We thought we would spend 2 hours at most doing the things but ended up there for the entire 4 hours! My boyfriend and I are science geeks and noticed a lot of the activities were Quantum Mechanics based and things you learn in high school/college physics so we didn't really learn anything new. However, the activities were fun and if we lived in San Francisco, we'd totally have a membership to the Exploratorium because of how much there is to do there. We went to the California Academy of Science and thought the Exploratorium was way better!\n\nI highly recommend adults going to the adult night because you won't deal with bumping into little kids! Plus, they sell alcohol at adult night to make things fun (it is overpriced alcohol though).", "author": "Daphne L."}

Felt proud of myself!\n\nThen, while the 6-year-old public who was with me was methodically taking apart the marble race tracks other public had built on the peg wall, I was encouraged to use dangerously sharp instruments to make lightweight \"drifters\" that soared (or sank) in the updraft column of air in the flight cylinders. It was great fun and I didn't have to sign a liability waver. Other people were building elaborate circuits on a large table filled with circuit modules.

The specimens were all alive and my 6-year-old failed to take any of the apparatuses apart.\n\nThis public found the plate of (4) pulled pork tacos with beans to be the best deal in the more adult-oriented (meaning raw oysters & wine) Seaglass Restaurant.

This museum is filled with so much adventure for kids and adults alike. I went with my 12 year old brother, my grandparents, my boyfriend and his niece and a full day was not long enough to enjoy everything the museum has to offer. If I lived in the Bay Area I would certainly (without question) have a membership. How can this museum not inspire children to want to learn about science? about nature? About the Universe? About how things work in the world? Starting with the musical Lockers, the fog bridge, the color-wash (reminiscent of James Turrell's perceptual cell), the plethora of activities to partake in, both alone and in groups, with friends and strangers, the outdoor playground, the Cafe with a small yet excellent selection of foods for the whole family; from fresh rolled sushi and mahi mahi fish tacos with mango salsa to creamy mac n' cheese and roasted chicken. \n\nSo close to the Embarcadero you can stroll along the Piers and watch the sunset over the Bay. Exploratorium is the perfect name for this place, as it is most definitely a place of exploration through play.\n\nThe reason I give it four stars instead of five:\nIt is an experience that every child and adult should experience, and while I went on their website and saw that there are in fact free days for families who can't afford the steep $24 ticket price per person, there were certain class/social groups under-represented at the museum and having lower prices all year round, or offering more free days (than those shown on their website), would expose more groups of children from all diverse backgrounds to the wonders and magic of the Exploratorium.", "author": "Gabriela G."}

You don't need a jacket inside to enjoy even if the location is on the water.  The staff has really goes out of the way to make the new (old)  digs feel as new as possible.   To move so much in such a short amount of time while creating a better INSIDE experience speaks well of the team.  The overall atmosphere matches the spirit of the Exploratorium.\n\nWhile I like the Exploratorium itself, the loss of the park area surrounding the Exploratorium has sucked some soul out of the balance that was struck between tech, humanity, and life at the old location.  The inclusion of the outdoor area outside the rear eastern, and south sides of the new building does mitigate the problem somewhat. But only for those who love a cold concrete pier surface to go along with a water view.   But no ducks and swans for companions anymore.  Just gulls and air-rats ( pigeons).\n\nPublic transportation access has improved with the surface trains stopping right outside the building.  It's possible to reach the new building relatively quickly now via Muni + Caltrain / BART.  Definite improvement over the old site that was limited more or less to the Muni Busses for access.   Although I have to say i never took Muni to the old location. \n\nParking just sucks.  Even the metered parking is $2.50 to $3.00 PER HOUR adding at least $7.50 to $15.00 to the cost of visiting the Exploratorium.  NO FREE PARKING anywhere near the site as there was in the old location.  Since the new location is on the Embarcadero  getting there, and leaving later, is going to be a chore no matter if you drive or take public transit.  Give yourself an extra 20 minutes or more on the summer weekends above what you would normally plan for your travel.\n\nThe Exploratorium is still one of the best outings for tech head in the SF Bay Area.

After a bit of preplanning research, here are some tips for those with limited time: \n\n1. PARK AT THE EMBARCADERO CENTER (LOTS 1-4): If you're visiting from out of town and don't plan to take public transportation, finding parking can be tough in the city. We called ahead of time and learned that although the Exploratorium website advertises over 10 different parking lots, they will only validate for certain ones. We ended up parking at the Embarcadero Center and were able to get it validated by the museum;  with validation our parking was set at a $10 flat rate, which is pretty reasonable considering the outrageous parking prices in the area. The walk is roughly 10-15 minutes to the Exploratorium.\n\n2. BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE:  My party purchased tickets on our smartphones and even went paperless; they will scan your e-tickets on your phone! We knew we made the right decision to purchase ahead of time when we passed by the hugeeeeeeeeee mile long line of families with rowdy kids. Also, if you're a local to SF you can get a $7 discount! (i.e. $22 vs $29) \n\n3. CARVE OUT A FEW HOURS TO EXPLORE: If you're lucky to snag one of the lockers once you first enter the museum, get ready to play, activate that cerebal cortex, and explore.  Even with the hundreds of parents, children, and other museum goers present, it was easy to be constantly entertained by a new exhibit. Some of my favorites include the toilet drinking fountain (ew!?), the toothpick artchitectural SF masterpiece by Scott Weaver, the Central Galley which explores light and sound, and so much more! \n\nAlso on the second floor you'll find a beautiful Bay Observatory with glass windows and a great view of the newly remodeled Bay Bridge and water! \n\nMy inner science geek loved every \"ah-ha\" moment I had at the Exploratorium- bring your childhood curiousity and appetite for learning, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Leslie T."}

There is also a small upstairs portion towards the back that has a terrace area which offers a great views and picture opportunities. \n\nIf possible, try to come here on a weekday when it's likely to be far less crowded than on the weekends. Since the majority of the exhibits are hands-on, less people means a greater opportunity to try and play with everything!\n\nOne of these days we'll have to make it out on the first Thursday evening of the month for the After Dark event. Who wouldn't like to experience drinks AND science?!\n\nCons: It got exhausting about 3/4 of the way through the whole place. Reading each exhibit and the science behind them while trying to navigate around a forest of kids gets tiring.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-20", "description": "A wonderful place to explore science... exhibits are hands on and interactive, designed for you to touch, feel and explore.  You could spend all day tinkering with one or two activities, or you could walk around and explore a bunch of exhibits.  There are tons of things to do, will keep you (and the kids) occupied for the better part of a day.  Great for kids and families.\n\nThe Embarcadero location is fantastic and allows you to soak in incredible views of the bay and bay bridge.  You can enjoy the inside as well as the fabulous views of the outside.  \n\nWe have had a membership for the past few years (expired this year) -- and loved the museum in it's older location - right by Chrissy field in the Palace of Fine Arts.  Sticker shock when they moved to their new location. A visit to the exploratorium used to be a low key and affordable day.  The museum in it's new location is more glamorous and high profile and the prices reflect this.  Sticker shock the first time we went back.  More crowded and expensive.  It was over $30 to park our car, and lunch for 3 in he cafe set us back $60.  It's probably not a big deal for tourists, but the parking and food add up quickly if you are a regular visitor (with kids).  \n\n\nTips to help with the day:\n\n1. Take Public Transport if possible.....  If you drive and need to park, check out the parking lot across the street at Green and Embarcadero (the website will not direct you here).  The have good prices ($5 per hour), and always find you a spot.  Much more convenient than the lot in Levis Plaza that the exploratorium will suggest to you.\n\n2. Local Discount: Tickets are cheaper if you are a resident of the bay area.  Ask for the local discount.\n\n3.  Plan to spend at least 3 hours here.  There is a lot to experience.\n\n4. For tourists - keep in mind that this is a very popular destination for kids, and can get crowded.  It can get crowded, so get here early to avoid some of the kid traffic.\n\n5. Wear comfortable footwear!\n\n6.  Visit the tinkering center - the docents always have an interesting project to work on\n\n7. The observation deck is a great place to take a break\n\n8.  You don't need to do everything in one day!  Take time to experience and explore.\n\n9.  The docents are very helpful!  Don't hesitate to ask for assistance.  \n\n10. Lunch/ Food: The cafe is pretty, with a gourmet menu - organic, locally sourced food.   A little pricey, and no kid menu (they have PB sandwiches near the check out counter).  If you are on a budget (or have fussy kids) pack a lunch and eat on the benches outside the museum - the views are amazing.  They have lockers if you need to store your lunch while you explore.  Cafe gets really crowded from 12 - 1 - so eat before or after.  \n\n11.  Take advantage of the location - ferry building has lots of great food stalls, TCHO next door has great chocolate (and chocolate tasting), the embarcadero is a great place to walk.  \n\n\nHave fun!", "author": "Sunny C."}

It was kind of like a fun house with liquor though.  The atmosphere is definitely chaotic.  Thursday nights from 6-10, $15 bucks each I think.", "author": "Gabrielle M."}

One of my favorite places to explore. When a Groupon popped up that offered 50% off their annual membership, I jumped on it and have been there a handful of times since. This new location was so large (or maybe I was so enthralled by everything) that it took me two consecutive trips to see the entirety of the museum.\n\nIt's got a majority of the exhibits from the old location (the rainbow wall camera thing, the Tactile Dome, the spinning wheel, the dry ice exhibit, etc.), but there is a whole new arsenal of new exhibits to tickle your fancy and stretch your mind. One of my personal favorites was the slow motion camera. Create your own Pantene commercial! See the way your friends' faces move when you slap them. It's amazing.\n\nThere's a brand new (though temporary -- only on display until Spring 2014) exhibit on mental illness and the definition of normal that is heart-wrenching. This is the exhibit that stuck with me the most. It invites you to lay down in what looks like a cage that some mental institutions used to keep their patients isolated and theoretically calm. And the exhibits core is made up of personal belongings of past residents of the Willard Psychiatric Center in New York, found when the institution was closed. It's an exhibit that I would consider to be a little dark, compared to the other exhibits available, but definitely worth checking out.\n\nThere's also employees walking around, trying to engage people in more \"organic\" experiments. I had what looked like someone in an alien suit come up to me and make a series of gestures in front of me. Didn't speak, and I couldn't see their face, but after I mimicked their movements (because what else was I supposed to do?? I was so confused), they clapped and walked away. Not sure what the point was, but it was still a lot of fun and had me giggling really hard.\n\nI wish I had spent more time at the outdoor exhibits they have. I constantly remind myself that I work down the street; I should just go walk around the outside exhibits on my lunch, but the cold recently has kept me away. Maybe when the weather warms up, I'll mosey on over for an intellectual break.", "author": "Anna W."}

But most likely it is because those are the cooler ones, so its worth the wait. I spent a while in there and walked through the whole first floor....but since I only had one full day in SF we were kind of in a hurry to ge somewhere else....but we did spend a longer then expected... because everytime we want to leave the place, something cool pops up....which is like all over the place....(and yah i played with almost everything...thats why we walked through the whole floor)\nOnce we walked outside...i noticed a big hole next to the ocean...so i walked over and looked down...nothing...so i was really curious of why it was there...i mean it cant be for nothing!! And then i saw the sign....its a hole with two microphones on two ends....that records what went on...and plays back 12 hours later from under.....\"a message for the future\"...WOW...that's just so cool!!

Screw the tourist anyway I say and let them pay for the place. Remember, folks in Las Vegas pay no income tax because us tourist lose in their casinos. So, this place in as large or larger than the old place, way cleaner and with better lighting. Really a wonderful space put so nicely together by the designers and staff. They seemed to have kept all the old exhibits and added so many new ones. There are also some nice outdoor spaces and views of the bay. and a nice but pricey restaurant. Now, the old place did have the biting swans, by which I am sure must folks don't miss them but I liked my toes bitten by these creatures.\n\nSo, this is a place for a great date.

Personally one of my favorites of the cow eye because it teaches so much about my eye and how it works. Every time I'm at the Exploratorium I always learn something new.

So many things to touch, play with, tinker around with, explore, learn, everything. It was actually a little overwhelming. There was something to do or learn every two feet and they were randomly scattered all over the whole museum.\nI loved it, though, but I'm kind of a closet-science geek, even if I wasn't particularly good at it in school. Even if science isn't your thing, you'll most likely find at least a few exhibits that will blow your mind or leave you wondering and wanting to know more. The Exploratorium brings out the curiosity in all of us.\nFair warning: go on a weekday morning or afternoon (it's even advised by the museum website) and avoid weekends if you can, unless you don't mind being surrounded by hundreds of kids and toddlers and their parents.

The rather large and depressing display of old suitcases and their contents found in a mental health facility just seems out of place.  IMO they could find something (or a lot of things) more sciency and fun for kids than that.  \n\nParking would be much more of a PITA than at the Palace of Fine Arts location, but the new Exploratorium is easily BARTable.  About a 10-15 minute walk from the Embarcadero Station, with the opportunity to explore the Ferry Building on the way to or from.  Also just two piers from the America's Cup display.  If you have any more walking in you after the Exploratorium, it's worth it to check that out, even if you just sit on a bench and marvel at Larry Ellison's 4 story yacht for a few minutes.  \n\nThe restaurant at the Exporatorium requires you to officially leave the museum and get your hand stamped to return.  I do like the trend of improved food options a la the Academy of Sciences.  Kid opted for the sushi bar, but didn't get much at $8 for two pieces of nigiri.  I went for the filling and tasty pork tacos and topped off the kiddo with tempura green beans.  Sushi bar line short.  Taco line long and slow.", "author": "Linda M."}

Is it true the new location is a lot bigger, cleaner, and more hip? Sure...but man..the old location was so nostalgic to me. Those of you who were 80's babies and older remember going to the old exploratorium and spending time outside at the beautiful landscape watching swans fly around and what not. Remembering their crappy cafeteria food and what not, but you didn't care because it was a heck a lot better than what mommy packed for lunch.\n\nThose were the days! Sweet ol pre-puberty, hickies-infected, pokemon cards collecting, Tommy Hilfiger wearing days...\n\nBut I'm not going to knock the Exploratorium's hustle. Their lease was up and the show as they say it, must go on and Pier 15 was a great choice! The beautiful view of the water, the liveliness of the Embarcadero, and the polished architecture makes for a great step forward. \n\nThe premise is still there. It's a place for you to explore and let science take you by the hand. I can spend the whole day there. Like literally. All of the old exhibits that i remembered were brought over from the old location and a lot more additions were...well.. added. I'm not going to list you my favorites...because really you don't want to hear me geek out. So I will leave you with some tips..\n\nTip 1: Eat breakfast the day you are going. Or you know...you should eat breakfast everyday.\n\nTip 2: Use public transportation. the Embarcadero Bart stop is only half a mile away and on weekends...there is a street market for you to squander around as you make your way there. You are not going to find parking, trust me. \n\nTip 3: With Tip 2 being said, wear comfortable shoes! You are going to be on your feet most of the time, so treat your feet right. Ladies, don't wear heels or do..up to you. \n\nTip 4: Don't rush, pace yourself. There's always next time. Spend time at each exhibit. Take something away from it. Learn something. That's what makes this place so magical. \n\nUnofficial Tip 5: If you are like me...and must have Blue Bottle coffee on the way to Pier 15, don't go to the ones at the ferry station. There is a location closer to the Exploratorium with about 95% less of the crowd. You are certainly welcome! \n\nUnofficial Tip 6: There's really no good/cheap places to eat around here, don't be afraid to hop on Bart or Metro to go to a different neighborhood to enjoy something scrumptious. \n\nThat's it my breezies and brohans go out there and explore gosh darn it! \n\nLike Bill Nye said, \"Science is the key to our future!\"", "author": "Tung T."}

I could hardly walk down the center of the floor, it was literally shoulder-to-shoulder. Mind you, this was just for walking. Unfortunately there was someone on all the exhibits, so you had to also wait in line to even look at anything. They had 3 bars. We had to wait in line for a half an hour just to get ONE drink. They, of course, were insanely over priced for a tiny drink which was mostly ice. \n\nLastly, on the first Thursdays they have live entertainment. They had 2 showing times. The theater that they did this in was completely filled up well over a half an hour before show time. They don't even have room for a 10th of the people who bought tickets to this thing. Absolutely ridiculous. Oh! But they told us we could listen outside through some speakers they had piping. Really? I could just listen to it on YouTube and stay warm. \n\nThe one plus, which actually still has a con, is that the food in the restaurant was pretty tasty. They had a huge selection, oysters, sushi, ribs, tacos, dessert bar, plus a ton more. I was super happy about the quality of food. But, again, it was not worth $80 for 2 people.\n\nMoral of the story, you need the full 4 hours this event runs just to wait in line for everything. I will not be coming back to the first Thursday event. It was such a waste of time and money. More than one person was asking for a refund from the staff as they had felt exactly as I do.", "author": "Annette D."}

First off, there were two shows: one at 7PM and another at 9:30PM. When we first got to the Exploratorium at 6:50PM, we were horrified by the hundreds to thousands of people lined up to see the first show. \n\nThen, we were horrified even more to find that this line that extended into the first floor restaurant was the BACK of the line. The FRONT of the line was at the top on the second floor! And! these people got pushed back because the observation bay gallery, which the show was being held, was already packed and could only hold 150 people. These people who got pushed back started forming the new line for the second show at 7:00PM.  WHAT THE F@#$!!!. You charge the regular admission price and intentionally overbook the place for a very well-known performer who is a local. And because customers who cant see the first or second show are shut out, they're forced to get their money's worth by seeing the exhibits that weren't even  the planned attraction.\n\nIf we wanted to spend $15 per person to see the exhibits, then we would've....on a non-After Dark night.\n\n It was a ruined night.\n\nAfter Dark is a scam\n\nF____ this place", "author": "Christopher F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-18", "description": "I must admit, I miss the free and easy parking at the old Exploratorium site. I know that's a petty complaint to some, but I have two kids under the age of four and I'm usually hauling a camper full of conveniences with me wherever we go. It's not for me as much as it is for the general public. Trust me, you don't want to see me without a diaper bag in an emergency. \n\nAlthough the Exploratorium was the aim of this review, the parking was so difficult and expensive, it has become the focus of everything I remember from my first visit to Pier 15.  And if you've ever tried to travel anywhere longer than a mile with kids, you understand the trouble with taking Muni anywhere in the city for the following reasons:\n\n1) Stuff. Tons of stuff. Stuff for diaper blow outs. Stuff for soaked clothing caused by mysterious pools of water every child seems to easily find. Edible stuff for stuffing into hungry faces. Stuff for carrying the stuff.  Basically, all the stuff that doesn't fit neatly into a full Muni bus or train. \n\n2) People hate you on Muni. Yes, you with the adorable kids that do nothing wrong. All they need to do is take up space and breathe the same air as the passengers on Muni. They're deemed annoying without a fair trial. Anyone under the height of three feet is considered a possible threat to a peaceful transit ride in Muni world. Peter Dinklage barely sizes out of that category, and people LOVE Game of Thrones. \n\n3) It's gross. Muni is suffering from budget deficits, obviously, because they used to hose the busses out once in a while. Now, you're lucky if you get a bus that doesn't smell like a urinal. Your curious kid will be touching unknown ooze and then licking their fingers to see if it tastes like strawberry jam. Basically, it's the beginning of a terrifying, big budget movie about infectious monkeys. And by monkeys, I mean your kids. \n\n4) Getting children on and off a bus is not unlike wrestling crocodiles in a swamp full of Crisco while handcuffed to a chimpanzee in a roid rage. \n\nOther than the parking, it was a fun visit, albeit really confusing. We tried reading the signs but felt constantly lost. Larger signs or arrows on the floor might help people find their destinations. Trying to exit took ten minutes. We simply couldn't find the door easily because the signage was very hard to follow. And no, I'm not THAT sleep deprived and yes, I do have a college degree.\n\nIt's worth mentioning the food has vastly improved, but the high prices reflect the quality. One sushi roll was $8.00.  Delicious, but feeding two kids and two adults will set you back at least $40. I spent $53 because of drinks and side dishes. Ouch. \n\nIt's their first week, and I have faith they will make their adjustments and be running smoothly in a few months. But at $19 for a ticket (resident prices) this definitely won't be our weekly destination. I have the distinct impression residents are not their target, however. In other words, tourists will love it.\n\nP.S.  Dear Exploratorium,\n\nBecause I'm Korean and am required to taste test every non-Korean restaurant that serves it, I tried the \"kimchee\" in your food court.  Stop it.  Just stop.\n\nHugs,\nKristina", "author": "Kristina R."}

I was able to do a lot in 2 hours, but I wish I could have spent days exploring.\n\nThe ticket price for adults was $25 which I thought was fine given the experience, but if I was just going to entertain children I'd probably be annoyed at the price.

The power of sciences never ceases to amaze me.\n\nThe exploritorium is right along the embarcadero so you can drive there (only $5 parking) or easily walk 5-10 minutes from the BART station.  The staff is extremely friendly and there are many tutorials or demonstrations happening for everyone to see.  Compared to other museums or science exhibits, I'd say the exploratorium is definitely one of the best as it has something for everyone and has a multitude of stations to keep everyone interested and engaged.  Best of all, you can enjoy the views of the bay.\n\n**Pro tip: Keep an eye out for the FREE days that happen about 5 times a year.

About after lunch all the kids left and we got to play/learn all the different exhibits.  \nThe cafeteria wasn't that great.  I think they try to cook dishes that are really healthy or interesting.  For example, there was pulled pork on a cornmeal pancake, kale with pureed white bean sauce on pizza, i think a lamb sandwich.  They also had some more normal foods like sushi, margherita pizza, soup, salads.  Not sure if the kids like this food or not, but I would rate it as \"ok.\"  \nThe guides were not that helpful.  We watched one of the demonstrations and they had no luck turning a cup, magnet, and wire into a speaker.   \n\nSo I would dock half a star for the cafe and a whole star for the guides, but in the end the exploratorium has so many wonderful exhibits it totally makes up for the things it lacks.  \nAlso, it has a pretty cool location on the pier.", "author": "Jenni C."}

Unfortunately, very few parents showed the same courtesy and just let their kids camp out at some of the exhibits. A couple of them even barged their childREN in front of other people who were clearly waiting for their chILD to have a turn.

I love it so much that I bought a pass for myself and several as gifts. \n\nEach after dark event is themed and while there are a few that are just boring, the majority of them have been well thought out and interesting enough to keep me there buying $10 cocktails until close. \n\nI am knocking off a star for the spam. Like I said, I purchased passes for myself and some as gifts  for friends. We all started receiving identical spam and couldn't figure out where it came until I realized a few of our names were misspelled the same way they are on our Exploratorium After Dark passes. I tweeted about it and they apologized via tweets, email and phone calls but the damage was done. Once your information is sold there's no stopping it.\n\nAs someone who values privacy I will more than happy to pay cash for passes in the future but they will not receive anymore of my personal information.

My sister and I didn't make upstairs, so I will have to come back.  Being a member definitely has it perks.  There is also a lot of natural light and a beautiful view of the bay.  I've always been a fan of the Exploratorium and the new location definitely is a bonus.  Yes I will be back indeed.\n\nMy only negative comment, is the Priority Parking across the street located on Front @ Green.  My sister and I were told by the guy that parking is $5.00 per hour and they close at 6pm.  My sister told the guy, we will be gone about 3hrs.  The man had no pulse, not friendly but we figured $15.00 for 3hrs isn't too bad.  WELL - when we went to pick up our car we were charged a flat rate of $35.00.  My sister argued with the man, ( a different man) assisting her.  All he did was point to the flat rate when it specifically says $5.00 per hr for up to 4hrs.  We got ripped off.  I would recommend double checking with these guys, cause my sister and I were gone about 3hrs and 15mins, not close to 4hrs and we were charged an extra $20.00.  Unfortunately I cannot Yelp this parking lot since they are not on the yelp site but looking at their other locations a lot of people have given them 1-2 stars.  So folks, my recommendation to you is to PLEASE double check with these guys on the rate and beware to get your car no later than 3hrs hours otherwise you'll be paying $35.00 flat fee.  I'm very, upset that we had to pay that much for parking when we could have saved $20.00 and parked over at the Levi's parking lot.  Someone from the Exploratorium needs to check on these guys as well.  I don't believe not much can be done, but on the Exploratorium site is states that you can park for $5.00 per hour for up to 4hrs and my sister and I were parked less than 4hrs.  We were ripped off.  I don't think it is right so I want others to be cautious.  If Priority Parking has changed their limit of parking, then the Exploratorium needs to update their site.  You are better off parking at the Embarcadero Center where you car is more secure or taking BART.  My sister had to meet a client later which is the only reason why we drove rather than taking BART.", "author": "Liz D."}

We brought our triple date group for Thursday's After Dark event ($15/ticket) and found parking ($10 for 4 hours until 11pm) at the Levi's Center Garage a few blocks down - no problem.\n\nWhen we arrived, the line was incredibly long!  \n\nIs this where San Francisco nerds congregate?  I guess I fit right in.\n\nNo more than 10 minutes later, with our prepaid tickets in hand, we entered the museum...along with over 1000 other people!! Fortunately, even with the crowds, we were able to get through a little over half the museum during the 3 hours we were there.\n\nThe exhibits:  100% interactive!  Touching is believing, guys.  Let your inner child roam.  The variety of exhibits ranged from simple to simply astounding.  You can always expect to learn (or relearn) something new whenever you come to the Exploratorium from electromagnets to emotions to mental health to optical illusions to art displays. There is something for everyone and I mean it.  You will probably find members of your group drawn to various exhibits and wandering off in different directions!  My fave exhibit - the shadow wall.  Hands down.\n\nThe space:  Perhaps on a less crowded day, you will be able to hit everything without waiting in line for an exhibit.  I really didn't mind though - we had good company and moved leisurely through the museum.  The Exploratorium is a treat inside and out (child's playground outside and fog simulator!) from floor to ceiling.  Loved it.\n\nOverall, 3 hours in the museum left much to be desired esp because of the crowds.  We missed the concert and didn't check out the Bay viewing area or the restaurant or the gift store!  No time for drinks either...lines were really long.  I would still recommend the After Dark event to avoid overeager children during the day.

They had everything covered: sound, light, motion, biology, perception, psychology.  We got in around 3pm and it shut down at 5pm, but we easily could have taken another hour to finish wandering around.\n\nOne thing I want to point out is that the material and concepts the exploratorium covers are mature and assume you have more than just a basic understanding of the universe.  Kids will not understand or appreciate the exploratorium.  Unfortunately, when we were there the place was swarming with children.  In a children's museum this would be expected and fun but here it made it difficult to fully enjoy the experience.  Kids are curious, and all they want to do is touch things...great, but not when I'm sitting at an exhibit and a little boy comes up and starts playing with the tools provided at that exhibit.  So, parents...if you are planning on going, please, PLEASE leave your kids at home!\n\nHighly recommend.  Maybe scheduling a trip during the 18 and older times would be more enjoyable.

You would think that adults young and old would have more manners than their children, but you would be wrong. \n\nThe traffic you have to sit through is also no joke. We sat for over an hour on the same street just to get to the parking complex a couple miles down the road. In reading others' reviews I think that if I were a local or knew all of the ins and outs of public transportation, it may have been a little better, but everywhere was just so jam packed that it really took away from the experience. \n\nAll in all, if there was a time to go when there were not so many people, it would probably be much more enjoyable.

Packed to the gills!  We noticed that the place really cleared out quite a bit around 3:30ish.  Next time, I will go in the later afternoon, maybe after lunch time.

Assuming it was their lot, I drove in appreciating how close/easy parking was & thinking that my ticket would get validated. I waited in a short line where a man with an Italian accent came up to me and told me to get out. I wasn't expecting valet parking since there were no signs indicating it was valet parking only... but when I asked if they validated, he said, \"yes vallet.\" Uh.. By that time I felt like I couldn't change my mind since he had already taken my plates down w/o asking, but I was way too excited for the Exploratorium so I just got out of the car and walked away. When I paid for my entrance ticks, I asked about parking validation & the sweet lady who helped me told me the people across the street scam everybody! And that they don't even work with the Exploratorium... sketchy. She said they speak perfect English, but when anybody asks if they validate, they suddenly lose the ability to speak/understand you and just say, \"yes... vallet.\" On point with what happened to me.\n\nAnyway, 5 stars because the whole parking issue has nothing to do with this place and because it's awesomeeee. You'll definitely need to spend a good amount of time here if you want to go through all the exhibits. Also, beware: cute kids everywhere!

A lot of families with kids. We spent nearly 3 hours in there and still feel that we didn't try everything. \n\nA lot of reviews said there is a parking lot right across the exploratorium.

You can even make reservations through Exploratorium website and there is even discount offered. The reserve parking spaces are even more convenient and it's at the first level.

It definitely gives you mixed feelings before drinking water.

Having heard about their \"After Dark\" events, I was curious as to whether this option would be available on Thursday December 31, when my partner and I were visiting the city. I was excited to find that when I looked for tickets, the December 31st date was indeed available, and I booked our tickets right away. \nWe arrived in San Francisco over a month later, and on New Year's Eve were looking forward to experiencing this unique event. We got dressed, made our way down to the pier, and looked for the museum entrance, only to find all the doors locked, and several other people wandering in confusion. A young lady emerged and informed us that the museum was closed. When we (and several other individuals) informed her that we had tickets to the after dark event, she expressed her apologies, and told us there was no event that evening. My partner and I were left with no other choice than to head back to our hotel, which resulted in us wasting nearly an hour of commuting for nothing.\nI am frustrated and disappointed that 1) we were able to purchase tickets at all for this event, and 2) that the error wasn't recognized well before December 31. The fact that the tickets were errantly available for purchase is one thing, but the fact that the museum seemingly wasn't aware of these purchases, resulting in several individuals arriving to the museum with paid tickets for a non-existent event is inexcusable. We made phone calls to the museum regarding this error, and they still expressed surprise at our purchase, indicating that, had we not called, they would have kept our money, never aware of the error they had made. While they refunded our purchase price, the experience we had with the museum (or lack thereof), indicates a lack of professionalism and awareness of their own ticket-purchasing system. Should you choose to buy a ticket in advance to this museum, I recommend calling and explicitly verifying that they are indeed open during the time that you plan to visit,", "author": "Kristin J."}

I wish I can say 5 hours worth of compliments about the place, but I only had 3 hours of intense fun there!\n\nI've been to the Exploratorium many many times at the Palace of Fine Arts, but this is my first time being at the new location. I came here on a date so I'm writing in the POV of a young adult and not a parent. I got a student discount for $19. General Admission is $25. A great deal either way, but saving $6 was just the cherry on top for a fantastic day of exploration!\n\nEXHIBITS:\nThere are cool ones, scary ones, trippy ones, learning ones, interesting ones, boring ones, exciting ones, magical ones, unexpected ones, beautiful ones, amazing ones, fun ones, all under one roof! There will be kids (even older folks) that just take forever on an exhibit. Be patient, linger onto close-by ones and swoop in right after them. There are kids that straight up cut you while you are trying to figure out an exhibit. This would normally be fine because I am an adult and sure, I'll let you kids go. But it's still incredibly RUDE! Kids are only going to learn that it's ok to just cut people. And the parents that just let it happen, SHAME ON YOU. Teach your kids please! If they really want to play on it NOW, teach them to ask nicely. I've seen a mix of parents that will keep reminding their kids to wait and ones that let their kids just be a*holes. Sorry but not sorry. It's not like I'm gonna spend longer than a minute if there's a kid waiting on me. Some parents let the kids stay on one exhibit for an hour and just sleep on a nearby bench. Come on... I'm no parent, but I was never taught to just cut people in line. (ok, enough with my anger at horrible parenting)\n\nThe great thing about the exhibits are that they have some of the old ones that I remember so fondly from my childhood, and they also have a lot of great new ones! The exhibits are separated well into their scientific categories, so you kind of know the gist of the areas (better to make your choice of which ones to skip because of time constraints). Eg, pendulum area, I skipping half of them, after like \n7 pendulum exhibits, I just thought to myself, \"Ok, I get it...\"\n\n\nTIME:\nIt took me 3 hours, and I feel like I didn't even see half the exhibits. I skipped A LOT of them due to overcrowding and the fact that time was of the essence. Make sure you have enough time to really EXPLORE! Not just look at the exhibits, but really understand and learn it. So don't go in 30 mins before closing! :]\n\nFOOD: \nThank goodness I ate beforehand because food was EXPENSIVEEE\n\nPARKING:\nParking will be a pain. I found a parking meter 2 blocks away and it cost $15 for 3 hours. Usually a horrible price, but not bad for this tourist area.

If you're under 10 yeah maybe it's educational but I kept thinking the touted \"fun for all ages\" advertising was highly dubious. Maybe if you take your kids there it would be fun watching them learn but the science is definitely geared to kids, it's very basic and I'm someone who was bad at science at school and haven't progressed much since then. I saw adults wowing over fruit fly experiments we did at school at age 12. If adults without kids really get anything out of this place then I worry about the US education system. I'm not convinced that kids learn much either, mostly they ran from one piece to another pulling levers and making more noise than you'd expect in some war zones but didn't see many of them reading the \"why/what/how\" explanations. They were just banging things and inducing migraines. If you have kids take them but also take earplugs and plenty of aspirin and lots of money (the restaurant is super exy and my stomach still hasn't settled from the dodgy pulled pork), you'd be looking at $100 for a family and you'll likely wonder how many of the kids in there are being raised by wolves, lots of screaming little brats.", "author": "Ginny A."}

We were stopped by a guest services lady out front and I told her I needed to get my membership that I bought on Groupon.  She sent me to a line outside.  5 minutes later she told me to go inside to a different line.  I go inside and wait 15 more minutes in a line that 1 person is helping while two other employees sit doing nothing because they are on the side of the counter that says business guest or private guests or something to that extent.  I saw 1 food delivery guy approach them in 15 minutes and the 2 idiots couldn't even figure out where to send the guy to deliver the food!  I mean, they really couldn't lift a finger to help out with the line?!  Your employees should be trained in all guest service related matters.  There were also tons of people asking where to go to buy tickets, which was in a different area.  Everyone just looked confused when entering.\n\nWe finally got in and I was beyond disappointed at the exhibits.  I mean we live in SF....impress me!  These exhibits are geared toward 5-15 year olds.  Why are you charging adults so much more than children when there is nothing for them!  To top it all off I paid $8 for a cheese quesadilla (the only real kid friendly option) for the kids.  You have children's ticket prices...get a real children's menu.  \n\nLastly, I had to change a diaper in the restroom and there was no real changing table!  Just a vanity counter at the entrance to the restroom that everyone (men and women) could view.  The little girl I was changing freaked out when I tried to lay her on this counter, because she is used to the universal Koala changing tables, so I had to change her standing up.

Plus, with a hand stamp you can go in and out very easily. The outside space really makes this place so much better than the last one.\nSecond, the experiments are still so freaking cool. Some are from the old museum, but the laws of physics haven't changed so of course the experiments still work and teach. But there are are so many more new ones. It definitely feels fresh. If you walk around and notice the crowd, you'll see about 90% of the adults actively engaged in some way or another. The games, experiments, puzzles, etc. are great for all ages. My four year lasted nearly 4 hours there, I could have stayed longer. Oh and the cow eye dissection is still fantastic.\nThird, price. It's not free? Of course not, yes it cost money but if you think of it as a amusement park, it's way cheaper than anything else. Plus when you spend $9 per person for lunch the food is way higher in quality, not the junk served at places like amusement parks. Every piece of equipment in this building is CUSTOM. And these things take a beating. I'm surprised anything lasts more than a day without breaking. It takes a lot of skilled people to keep that place going. Kudos to the great staff.\nParking can be as cheap as $10 if you pick the right garage. They valid parking for specific garages. Call to get details. My family took BART and did the 10-15 min walk, easy.\n\nIf you go and plan to spend the day, pace yourself, take breaks (you can leave to walk the pier and come back), get focused on the activities, do the little tours they offer to get more depth out of the activities, and just have fun.

And sad.\n\nI was really excited to visit the new Exploratorium location on Piers 15/17 and finally had the chance to do so today! However, I do not think I will be returning for at least several years. In my opinion, the old location was SO MUCH better.\n\nWhile I realize this museum is probably intended for older children and adults, it used to be a place that even small children could enjoy. My husband and I took our 2 year old son a couple of years ago, and I have taken more than one kindergarten class on field trips. All trips were thoroughly enjoyable experiences, even with heavier crowds (like the ones on free days). \n\nToday we took my son (almost 5), and my daughter (2). The kids enjoyed the exhibits they could access.The outdoor spaces are very fun, and probably the highlight of our day. Overall, I think they had a good time, but it was just so crowded that it was difficult to access the exhibits and be able to spend any time \"playing\" with them, as there were people waiting and cutting in. As parents having to look after little ones, I will say it was a bit of a nightmare. VERY easy to lose a kid. I don't know what it is about the new location, but the feeling was different. Dark, low ceilings, just a weird ambiance. I just didn't like it. The old place felt friendlier, somehow. Because of the new location in a much more tourist-y area, I'm sure they will get much better attendance, but I think that is what took away from the overall experience. Just too many people. \n\nAnd the restaurants. Not impressed. At all. Expensive, few choices, crowded, and not very tasty. What's wrong with offering a place where you can get a simple turkey sandwich? Or PB & J for the kids. I'm all for offering more \"cultured\" options, but why throw out the \"old standards\" too? \n\nAdd to this paying $20 to park, and it's just not worth it for us to go back until our kids are much, much older. And for that, I'm pretty bummed. The Exploratorium used to be one of my favorite places. Kicking myself for not taking one last trip before the old place closed. :(", "author": "Amy R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-16", "description": "As outlined in my review of the California Academy of Sciences, my fiancee and I are very big science geeks. So when we looked at the what the CityPass included and noticed that there was an attraction right on the Embarcadero, we figured it was a no-brainer to buy and pay the Exploratorium a visit. \n\nOur original plan was to go on Monday, but when we arrived to purchase our CityPass we found out it was closed. No worries- we just spent the day in the area and rescheduled the visit. A few days later, we decided to head down to Pier 15 one more time to check out the Exploratorium. \n\nLike the CAS, the Exploratorium has exhibits from physics, geography and life sciences. I would say the biggest difference between the two is that the Exploratorium is MUCH more hands on. I loved how you could physically try out an attraction, then receive a brief but informative explanation as to what actually happened. This isn't your normal museum where you take in information. The Exploratorium is so much more, allowing you to actually experience the science for yourself, then learn the theory behind it. \n\nThe building itself is huge. There are 6 sections (I believe), and each one has a particular theme. They also have an upstairs section dedicated to weather, with an observation deck overlooking the bay. Even though it was a Wednesday afternoon, the place was absolutely packed, which meant a lot of patience was required to not only wait for exhibits to free up, but also kids running around and bumping into you accidentally. I'm fine with the latter, but if you're not particularly fond of children I suspect you need to visit right at opening, or on a weekday when school's back in session.\n\nOverall, my fiancee and I had a blast. We took our time (4 hours or so), and still missed out or sped through some of the really busy attractions.  My last comment is for the mainly volunteer workers scattered in the different sections offering more insight to the exhibits. I thought they were really engaging for both kids and adults, and they really looked and sounded like they loved being there. You could see the wonder and amazement in the childrens' faces when having something explained, and that sort of reaction is priceless for a place like the Exploratorium. Even the enthusiasm oozed in the gift shop. My one example was the following: as my fiancee and I were trying out an exhibit beside the gift shop, I suddenly heard a BOOM, followed by a rush of air. When I looked over, it was the cashier at the gift shop using an air cannon. He waved, then proceeded to shoot at my fiancee, who was startled to say the least. When I told her to look over, she laughed and we all waved at each other to say hello. \n\nIt's places like these that help develop a child's curiosity in the sciences which hopefully keeps them engaged when learning the dry material served up in schools nowadays. Along with the CAS, the Exploratorium is a must-visit if you have children in grade school. Even if they aren't terribly interested in the sciences, I guarantee that they will leave the place with a better appreciation for the world around them.", "author": "Vincent A."}

That was pretty awful.\n\nWe finally got a place to park, very close to the museum.  It was $30 to park on a Sunday.  OK, fine.  I coughed up the money, and we walked over to the museum.\n\nOnce inside, since we were locals, it was $35 for the two of us to enter.  Wasn't this place free at one time?  Anyway, the people at the front desk were very very nice, all the employees were very nice.  \n\nThe exhibits were what they always have been, but I guess in the years of seeing the same sorts of things a few times now, they weren't all that exciting.  We pretty much buzzed through them and were done with the place in about 2.5 hours.  We tried to see a lecture on lasers, but the pace of the presentation was so slow and over-detailed that we left after about half an hour of droning.\n\nWe ended up back at the restaurant that faces the bay for lunch.  the food was very good, but everything cost about $9, so it was also pricey, making for another $30 for the two of us to eat.  I suppose there might have been lower cost options tucked away someplace there, but they were not obvious.\n\nGiven all this, it was not too surprising that the museum was not very crowded at all.  That was quite pleasant for us, but probably not too good for the museum itself.  We could walk up to everything with no wait, and I think that helped contribute to us being able to get through the whole place so quickly.\n\nI think if you want to go to a science museum, you should go to the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.  That is a much better experience at a much more reasonable price point for what it is.  \n\nI can't really recommend the Exploratorium, unfortunately.  It's in a beautiful location, but it was difficult to get to, and over $100 for just two people for just a couple of hours.  They just recently had a layoff there due to crowds not being what they had hoped they'd be.  There's good reason for that.  It's just not worth the money or effort.", "author": "Jon N."}

On our trip to San Francisco, my boyfriend was excited to checkout the Exploratorium. We arrived on a Tuesday at 3PM. The place was a bit crowded at first but as it reached closing time at 5PM, there didn't seem to be too many groups left inside.\n\nWe purchased student tickets for $18 each. I showed them my student ID, however my boyfriend had left his at home. The cashier was very nice though and said she would still give him the student discount (:\n\nThe Exploratorium is essentially a very long room. You enter from the middle and can either go down to the right or left. There were so many different exhibits. Some were really cool, and though others weren't as interesting, everything was very informational and FUN. It can get a bit hectic with so many children running around. I bet this place can turn into a zoo on the weekends! But for a weekday, there were just enough people so that we never really had to wait to check out one of the displays.\n\nMy favorite exhibits were located on the lefthand side.\n\n- The Lego Batman strobelight show!\nYou might miss it because it's tucked away behind a corner so be on the lookout. A scene of lego toys is set up to appear as though they are moving with the help of a strobelight and spinning platform.\n\n- Camera + waterdrop\nA highspeed DSLR is positioned at a cup that contains water. The observer controls at what point a water droplet will fall as the camera takes a photo. You end up with really interesting shots of the droplet suspended in the air to the point where it makes a splash in the water. Very neat, especially if you love photography!\n\n- The very end of the lefthandside featured plantlife and information about the ocean, which was one of my favorite parts.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this is not just a place for kids to have fun! I saw young couples on dates and even elderly people on vacation enjoying all the fun the Exploratorium has to offer.", "author": "Courtney C."}

I'd been home for the opening weekend and thought ok, when we come up for Memorial Day weekend I'd pass the tradition onto  my little one.  \nWell I must say that the tradition stopped at the ticket line counter. Seriously almost $70 just for entry for the three of us??  Guess someone has to pay for the prime real estate, but given it's an educational and nonprofit, rather expensive to teach your kids about physics, and such.... oh but that's right someone has to pay for what our public education system stopped funding... but moving on...\nLike many other said, there were quite a few of the old, same old exhibits. Although the toilet bowl fountain was rather cool. \nIt certainly is huge. I did like the cool workshop with all the machinery that is now all replaced by automatics stuff in the the real world of factories.\nWe were there for about 3 hours. I didn't see the any advertisement for the cow eye dissecting exhibited and the big orange cone with the ball suspending in air.\nSurprisingly we went on the Saturday of Memorial weekend. The place itself was not crowded, but getting there was. As Bay Area native, we took the train over from the East Bay, and took the F trolley (ok so we had to wait for 4 since they were so packed)\nDid like the microscope exhibits, but how do you explain the bull sperm cell sample to the 6 year old. \nThere was a cool lab exhibit with a huge baleen piece.\nWe ended up a the Skybar for a light lunch.. Light it was, but not one the wallet.\nSushi bar was great because it was made to order.\nThe gyrojungle gym was the biggest hit.\nPlease be prepared, that now that it on the toursity section of SF, i,e on the way to Pier 39, Fishermans' Wharf, that the visitors aren't always the most polite folks, or teach their kids the etiquette of manners, ie not cutting in line to the exhibit, not hogging the exhibit, etc.\nBut it is a cool nostalgia for those of us who grew up in the Bay Area during that time of field trips, as well as getting to kids to stop xboxing, ipading, etc for a few hours.", "author": "N L."}

Yet it will be.\n\nUnlike the pretty Academy of Sciences where one can look at fish, sure, but has not much to *do*, there is so much to do here that at the end of the day you will wonder where the time went and it will be impossible to drag the kids out by the ankles.  \n\nAnd speaking of kids, don't even bring them. That is, they are not the main reason to go. I brought mine and they had a great time, but really there is so much to do and learn for  anyone.  If anything there are many more exhibits geared towards a kid of advanced age, and, at times one feels more like participating in some crazy conceptual art at MOMA.\n\nThe place stays true to it's original vision of not dumbing anything down, and really leaving the exhibits speak for itself, so you might actually need your 5 year old demonstrate how stuff works. \n\nThere will be some that will miss the village feel of the old Exploratorium, but that's like missing the Embarcadero Freeway.", "author": "Lucy Z."}

Growing up I've always remembered the iconic Exploratorium located in the Marina, next to the Palace of Fine Arts.  Since its move, the location is even more beautiful: located right near the bay, and public transit is very convenient.  The Exploratorium has its popular, crowd favorites (ex: shadow box, pillar illusion with the man silhouette in between pillars, bike wheel chair, mirror looking like you're cut off, cow's eye dissection presentation, etc.) and added many more \"experiments\" since its move.  One new crowd favorite is the toilet water fountain in which one looks like you're drinking \"toilet water\"; another is that in the shadow box visitors can use their flashlight apps on their smartphones to trace their own silhouette or draw something after their \"shadow\" has been taken.   There are many activities for all ages, though I'd probably take them at youngest 6 - 7 years. when they're old enough to understand at least how basic science works.  After your visit, take a casual walk or exercise along the Embarcadero, stop by a restaurant for coffee or a meal, or visit the Ferry Building's shops and eateries.

The exhibit where you look into some kind of 3d mirror shows you upside down, a really cool treat of a trick to experience. Consider this a rave review.", "author": "Barbara S."}

It's a great deal because prices to get in is slightly cheaper than a normal admission day. You get access to the whole museum and all the exhibits. I guess wherethey make their money is with the drinks and food. They are overpriced, but that's to be expected. They dont check bags, sooooooo you could potentially bring a bit of something something. I brought a sandwich I bought close to work. I've been to the academy of sciences nightlife and personally I like that the academy of sciences is nature concentrated. The exploritorium is more hands on with their exhibits and physics orientated. That is only one aspect that sets them a part from the academy of sciences. Overall I'm glad I came to experience after dark. I wish I went to more of their talks and if they were more frequent or even on a different day.

It was pretty overwhelming as there are sooo many things to do and see! Like we got there maybe 3 hours before closing and still didn't get to see everything even after skipping some parts of the exhibits due to things being occupied and such. I think I took the kids here at too young of an age (4 and 6) because there wasn't too many things they could do, things they didn't know what to do with or understand but they still had fun with all the buttons, levers, lights and all that. Definitely recommended for older elementary kids and up. \n\nI assume that it's less packed during the non-summer months but based on my experience -if you're planning to come out during the summer, plan to be in there for at least 4 hours if you'd like to see everything and take some quick breaks. And please parents, have your kids behave and/or beware if I'm in there because I almost went to whoop this one kid for purposely pushing the table where my niece and nephew were building towers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "Exploratorium, I missed you when you were gone. Now that you're back, I miss the old you. The new Exploratorium is dysfunctional and chaotic. \n\nI am a firm believer that form follows function. The new Exploratorium had a great opportunity to create the best experience in a great location in one of the best cities in the world. They used the best architects, project managers and consultants. They had access to great customer feedback. But they blew it! The museum succeeded merely at proving how poor design, drives customers away (and conversely, how great design is good for business).\n\nThe new Exploratorium looks nice from the outside but enter the doors and welcome to chaos. Once passing through the admission line you enter the exhibit area. The exhibit guide/map identifies distinct areas focusing on well-selected science and technology topics. But, as you wander through the museum, identifying which area you are in is impossible. The signage is very subtle and hardly existent and the boundaries between areas are ill-defined. There are lots of twists and turns in order to navigate the exhibits; a perfect way to lose your child. Although the museum claims to be bigger than the old museum near the Palace of Fine Arts, the ceilings are lower and the noise level is much higher. The result is a feeling of being closed in. Now add a mass of people, mostly kids of course, and you end up chasing your kids through crowds of other adults and kids equally trying to keep track of each other. I went to the museum with my wife, our 12 year old son, my brother, his three 11 year olds (yes, triplets) and my father (grandpa). We took the strategy of each adult being assigned to keep track of one kid. The crowds, the noise, the twists and turns made tracking just one kid feel like an endurance sport. I can't imagine having to keep track of two or more.\n\nAgain, the aesthetic is very nice but I am shocked that the fire department approved the design. From the western part of the exhibit floor you see a great big wall of glass between you and the entrance from the Embarcadero. The catch is that there is no door in the glass wall and the nearest exit is subtly placed off to the side. Imagine a frantic crowd in the face of emergency running toward the exit only to be blocked by a thick sheet of glass with no clear way out. This is yet another great example of form preceding function and a perfect formula for more chaos in the face of an emergency.\n\nSo, after 1-1/2 hours my son and his three cousin couldn't take any more of the crowds, the noise and the waiting to use the exhibits. The kids wanted to leave! My son used to spend 3-6 hours in the old Exploratorium at least a half dozen days each year. After his first visit to the new museum he stated that he is not interested in coming back; unfortunately, I am fine with his request.\n\nNow for the good things: \n- Individually, the exhibits are great; both the new and the old.\n- Enabling the visitors to see the machine shop in action was very smart. \n- Creating a net zero energy building is great. \n- Updating another SF pier is nice to see.\n\nMy dad is a scientist, my brother an engineer and program manager, my wife a designer and I'm a project manager and industrial designer. We all love great, thoughtful design, science and technology. I can't express how excited we were to explore the new museum and how disappointed we were after visiting. So good luck Exploratorium, my old friend. I wish you the best.", "author": "Phil A."}

They certainly did, until they just got tired. It is certainly a place that for children requires repeated, and probably shorter visits (not all day). As my grandsons and their family are moving overseas, I am sad that their repeat visits are not possible.\n\nBUT - FAMILIES - PLAN TO BROWN BAG  and eat outside on the Pier deck.  As the primary audience is for children, we were startled and dismayed by the menus offered by the Exploratorium partner-eateries on site, the Seaglass restaurant and Sonic Joint Cafe. They are run by the same business. Neither offered a child menu i.e. all offerings and prices are adult size. Also the food selections, while no doubt tasty, simply were not healthy, quick-meal, family-oriented.  We finally went outside and found one cart at the Pier that produced grilled cheese sandwiches but nothing else.  Those sandwiches were good but the predominant Exploratorium visitor base needs easy access to family-friendly eateries. \n\nI agree with a prior commenter that there is much here for adults of any age but don't expect to enjoy those exhibits if you have children with you.

Idk about taking children 5 and under to this place mainly because its more about learning reading and doing and also understanding the purpose of the experiment. I recommend taking hand sanitizer as everyone touches every experiment. There is children running everywhere and cutting in front of you while you do or see the experiment which sucks because your looking into it and whoosh comes a child and so rudely cuts you off.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "We went on PI day which is 3/14, and it was a free museum admission day.  My kids had the day off from school as it was a staff planing day so it made sense to do some fun interactive learning on their day off in the city.  We spent 5 hours there and sadly learned more about how crazy some people are than from their science exhibits.  I guess it was a lesson in social dynamics and how important crowd control could be if utilized effectively.  When we got in line to get our free tickets, they asked for a donation which we were happy to support them with.  However, now when I look back at today's experience, I think we should have gone on a regular admission day to pay the regular admission fee or better yet to become a member at the museum to avoid the hordes associated with \"free days.\"  Everyone and their mama's mama's mama come on these days and then some so a lot of waiting around to be skipped and pushed out of the way.  We had a few bad experiences with the ruckus crowd so we just chilled at the outside cafeteria and kid's play area for most of the day.  We'll wait for a less crowded day (hence not a free day), and when the kids are older to come back.\n\nOne much older girl felt the need to come from behind and push all the buttons on a display my daughter was trying to use.  It's like my little five year old girl had four arms working the four button controls.  Then when I politely asked the girl if she could wait her turn.  Honey Boo Boo's Mama yelled \"You idiot, don't talk to her.  She's just a child\" from another station.  She was not even at the same station we were at watching her child.  She was one of those long distance mamas.\n\nOh excuse me for telling someone to mind their manners.  So I just took my little girl to a different station not knowingly and unfortunately meeting Honey Boo Boo's other relative (a grown man) who was in the process of snatching a piece from my son's hand to make a lever contraption.  Again, I can not repeat how annoying it was to watch a grown man taking a piece of plastic block from my seven year old son's hand.  A lack of patience is served everywhere here so I recommend an older child who may be able to handle the disappointment of not being able to learn the science behind the exhibits due to rude and disrespectful kids and adults alike.\n\nBy this time, I just stood silent because I have ESP, and I just knew this was that type of hill billy moment when another hill billy would cause some ruckus.  Yes, these hill billies were all starting to stand out, and my bad that I bumped into the first hill billy's relatives or close friends/neighbors.\n\nSoon after Mama June #2 started yelling \"Oh this Mama hits kids\" repeatedly while staring at me.  I'm thinking \"WTF?!  Who are these people?  Do I know you?  Am I getting punked for the Hee Haw series at the Exploratorium?\"\n\nLater on I realized that the two Mama Junes knew each other as they were waddling together with a trailer park full of kids.  Gosh this free day at the museum let me down and these hill billies almost ruined it for us.  I really wanted to speed dial my buddy Roscoe P. Coltrane to sort this nonsense out, but I kept my cool.\n\nWe did see some friends and their kids.  We marched in the PI parade and got some delicious pie to eat to celebrate Albert Einstein's birthday.  We looked out for hill billies for the rest of the day by hiding outside in the sun and we survived.  Thank goodness we have some color to us so we didn't burn on that sunny day.\n\nAnyway, another Dad (who I shared this story with because he told some older kids not to skip his younger kids and my child) told me that he was surprised that I didn't hit one of those crazy LSD acid mushroom eating tripping mamas that day as they were so full of imagination.  I'm sure if those two mamas talked to another one of their mama friends then the story would have been translated into something like I had killed a kid and stuffed him/her in an exhibit at the Exploratorium.  Yeah, their telephone skills were not that great with their story changing along the way each time. Anyway, the other Dad (who I shared my story with) made me laugh when he jokingly said he would have hit somebody for all that nonsense.  Nice to know that not everyone has forgotten their manners or their voice to speak out for their younger kids.\n\nYes, we were the bigger persons for just ignoring the crazies, and I'm thinking somebody must have woken up on the wrong side of the barn or ate some day old plus roadkill or something.  A bad case of telephone or faulty mental reception from the 1st dopey mama reporting a fire to the 2nd loopy mama when it was just a firefly.\n\nSo you're welcome, you've been warned about these free museum days.  Go at your own and your kid(s) risk, but be forewarned that it's better to pay upfront or else you'll end up paying later.  So yeah, Happy Birthday Albert Einstein, but we'll be celebrating your birthday at home and not at the Exploratorium in the future.", "author": "Maggie L."}

Where's the Bill Nye type personable scientist blowing up things and talking about what made that happen? Where is the 3d printing machine and live demo and exhibition? Where is the well rounded guide through each theory? There is plenty to learn about science basics for a 8 yr old but you'd do better to set up experiments in your backyard from YouTube and save your family $100 for 4. If this place wants to truly define science exploration it needs bigger, badder exhibits that fully explore the past and future of technology. Otherwise the price needs to be $8... Because that's the roof of what this was worth.", "author": "Curtis M."}

Lots of new exhibits mixed in with the classics so there is much to do and see. Have been here twice, today with just my niece and once in June on a field trip with 300 middle school students. I am/was amazed that though so many people are in the Exploratorium, it does not feel overcrowded.  I am concerned that some parents do not supervise their children and allow them to run across the halls or on the stairs almost knocking over younger and older people alike. Kids will be kids, but why does a parent stand there and do/say nothing when their child shoves others out of their way because they cannot wait their turn? I also do not feel that it is staffed enough to provide supervision and safety for its guests. I see a lot of staff cleaning, but not many circulating encouraging children to interact with exhibits or to re-focus those disorderly children into more positive interaction. This is a great place for children to come and explore and get interested in science. Unfortunately, people should remember that it is also a shared space and should be respectful of all and their right to enjoy all the Exploratorium has to offer...we need to remember to take turns and not push others out of the way. Please, Thank You, and I'm Sorry goes a long way when so many diverse groups of people all converge into one venue.", "author": "Carrie W."}

We arrived at 11:15, found parking at Broadway & Embarcadero for $25 for the day ($20 if we had arrived before 11am), and walked the 2 minutes to the Exploratorium. Definitely like this location better. We saw a *long* line at the entrance for buying the tickets. We did a quick math and figured it works out cheaper to buy the family membership if we'd visit more than once next year, which we would, and took the shorter line to buy membership and enter. We got a cool messenger bag as a sign up gift - score!\n\nThe layout is lengthwise and not circular, and we immediately noticed that there was much more space around each exhibit, allowing us to watch better while waiting, which adds to the fun. There were many familiar exhibits and many new ones too. Though there were a lot of visitors today, we didn't have to wait at most exhibits. Somehow, even the familiar exhibits seemed a lot bigger, must be the new design. I won't go into the exhibits, but suffice to say that they were interesting to elementary school kids, high schoolers and adults. We were usually in the same area, but we each did what interested us the most, and grouped up whenever we ran into each other at an exhibit. We grossly underestimated the time we would need to visit all 600 exhibits. In the 5 hours we spent there, I doubt we even covered 25% between the four of us. We were really glad we bought the family membership, and realized we need more than 2 trips next year just to make sure we visited each exhibit at least once. \n\nIt closed at 5 sharp, wish it stayed open longer. We walked to the ferry building, got ourselves something warm (coffee, hot chocolate), and walked around sampling olive oil & variety cheese. We bought some bread to go with the oil and cheese we bought, pulled up some chairs and a table, and had a simple but satisfying dinner before walking back to our car. Again - love the new location! We'll be back before not too long!!!", "author": "Vidhya H."}

The old setting was pleasant if ugly, but quite appropriate to the level of quality of the educational \"technology\" deployed, which was always fairly poor, and these days is downright terrible. I'm an STEM informal science ed researcher, and have been going to the Exploratorium for 30 years, and it pretty much hasn't changed in all that time. I just assumed that they were too poor to create good teaching technologies, and were just stuck with what they could get starving artists to do. That would have been fine, and I support that. (It's also a science teacher training center, which is great, bcs I'm sure that their \"demos\" work must much better in a classroom guided discovery setting!)\n\nWell, apparently poor they aren't! But you'd think that being in the world center of science and technology, with some money, they'd have tracked the field, at least a little! But 30 years of advancement in informal science education research seems to have passed them by. All they did was add windows, and move to a high traffic, expensive parking zone. The new place seems FAR more claustrophobic than the old one did, and darker, mostly, I think, because it has low ceilings and tons of walls whereas the old place was essentially one huge room. At least the old one was enjoyable to walk around in. The new one you just want to get out of asap. So the \"pleasant\" part is completely gone!\n\nSo whereas it used to be a fun bad science museum in a pleasant setting, now it's just a bad science museum that you want to get out of asap (and feel bad for having wasted the time in traffic and all day parking price to just hate the experience). \n\n(I'm a member, and not planning to renew.)", "author": "Jeff S."}

My complaint is not with the content, just the price and enormity of the place. It seems impossible to hit every station in one day, plus after 3-4 hours you are just totally worn out and so are the kids. Would be cool if they could sell tickets based on area at a discounted price. So you could spend a few hours in the section you choose for that day and decide if and when you want to come back for the other areas. This would also make it affordable to those that may not have $48 for entrance for one adult and one child. Plus we spent $25 for parking for the day.", "author": "Joy G."}

It is definitely not geared for that age group (see also: Chabot Space & Science Center) but my 4 y.o. enjoyed flitting around touching stuff. The 2 y.o. was overstimulated literally within minutes (not to mentioned trampled); would not bring that age if I could do it over again. The outside exhibits (most or all of which are free?) were just as cool and not as mobbed as inside. As another parent said, \"There's almost TOO MUCH stuff here.\" Amen - the jam-packed set-up (hardly room to move between exhibits in some areas) and massive crowds lend themselves to a frenetic atmosphere that my little ones instantly hummed in frequency with (look at me, I'm all sciencey-metaphors now). Try not to bring a stroller inside, it's just too crowded to maneuver it. No kid-sized potties or sinks, and no quiet corners for nursing (or calming down an upset toddler... sigh). Bring your zen and snacks. I don't plan to return until my children can read and comprehend the signage, and even then I wouldn't advise less than a 1:1 parent-child ratio. On the plus side - THANK YOU for making inside bathrooms available before the place opens at 10. My 4 y.o. was not going to make it otherwise! P.S.

I think we would have had a lot more fun if we had kids to go with, but just as a couple, a lot of the exhibits were a little too immature for us. We also went as a big group wanting to have fun, so that may have been a fault in our planning. From what I could see though, lots of kids were having fun testing out the exhibits and figuring out what was going on. The fact that it's a hands-on museum was definitely a plus. Because we went on a free day, we didn't feel the pinch of it or feel like the trip wasn't worth it, but otherwise, we might have.

The new location is in a more crowded area and it is a way for them to add high parking fees to your visit.  Also they want to have your car keys, but we didn't let them have ours.  The food is new age, yuppie selections that are high priced and completely unappealing to kids, in a exhibit that is setup for kids that seems pretty stupid.  We actually had to give our daughter a chocolate chip cookie to tide her over because they had nothing that a normal kid would like.  Our son isn't as picky of an eater, but there was nothing that he liked either.  For that matter we were hard pressed to find something we would want.

Although as an adult you pretty much know the mechanics behind most of the science-experimenty stuff in the exploratorium, yet, looking at them, tinkering around with them, brings a child-like smile to your face. The place has a bunch of sciency awesomeness with magnets, gyroscopes, mirrors, pendulums, electrostatics, microscopic bacteria and even an live almost-born chicken embryo (it was really awesome to see the little embryo's heart beating through the microscope!). Situated at Pier 17, it's location is also pretty awesome. There is this small patio area that gives you some of the most stunning views of the city skyline and the bay bridge. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've been to better science exploratory museums in the country (like say the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago).

I parked in Embarcadero 4 parking lot and brought my ticket in for validation, and it ended up only costing $10 for the day.  It is an short walk to the Exploratorium, passed about 2 play structures on the way, breaking it up and having something to look forward to after leaving the museum.  Bring your own hand sanitizer, they don't have dispensers out and the displays are awesome, but hands on.  They hand stamp for for you leave and come back.  We ended up leaving for lunch and did a short walk to Pier 23 Cafe.  It is a lot bigger than it looks.  Wasn't fast and there was a wait for a table, but we dined outside on the patio with a beautiful view and the food was surprisingly good!  They did have a kids menu (hamburger, grilled, cheese, chicken stripes, etc for $8).  Thanks to the previous yelper that mentioned the AAA discount, and they also have a better one (maybe $5 off) for SF Bay Area resident (San Jose was accepted) and she said their teacher or adult student discount was even better (and she did not ask for school ID or any verifying proof).  Next time I will pack a backpack with water, snacks and maybe lunch that we can eat outside.  Glad we brought our jackets, the temperature changed a lot, depending on the sun/shade and wind.  There are lockers there and some of them required you to bring your own lock (or perhaps maybe those are for employees/volunteers?).    It was crowded on a Saturday (not a free day), but most displays we only had to wait after one child for our turn.
