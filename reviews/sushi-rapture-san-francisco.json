It's nothing fancy but you can definitely catch some colorful conversation at the bar between the family that runs the place.  \n\nHappy hour Tuesday - Friday from 4-7pm but it's nothing much to get excited about. $3 hand-rolls lime spicy tuna, salmon, or crab but I think they shrink them at happy hour. Chicken karaage is decent but the toragashi that they sprinkle on it is a little tart. I think you're probably better off ordering from the regular menu because happy hour portions are tiny.\n\nSushi Rapture is a decent spot.

Really surprised they do not have four stars - for an out of the way neighborhood sushi place, the quality and presentation is outstanding. I learned about this place from KQED's Check Please: http://bit.ly/2nmV2zZ (go to 18:05 for the Sushi Rapture segment).\n\nEverything seems super fresh. The first time we just told chef Sam (great guy!) to just hook us up \u00e0 la omakase. We started off with the breaded fried scallops - perfectly breaded and crispy, and moist inside. Then Sam brought us a sashimi sampler - hotate (scallops) were a standout, like butter!\n\nSubsequent visits we shared a lot of things - this time beef tataki with ponzu sauce, hoisin beef riblets, and a few of the rolls. All wonderful, with the hamachi toro and hotate (scallops) most outstanding. Again, this place serves it fresh.\n\nBento boxes for lunch are good, but I felt a little pricey - BUT, I do recall leaving with leftovers, so I guess I cannot complain.\n\nSo, a great place.

We ordered a couple of items to go and it was almost $48.00...gee\n\n1. chicken teriyaki noodle soup - any normal restaurant would separate the soup from the ramen to prevent the noodle from being too soggy. well, they didn't and by the time i got home, the noodle was not right and the chicken lost its flavor. most importantly, the broth was thin with no flavor. i suppose they did not know a good broth is the key of a great noodle soup. this dish did not meet expectations.\n\n2. gyoza - they were very small and lacked flavor. i could have gotten the ling ling potstickers from costco and call it a day.\n\n3. bento box with teriyaki chicken, salmon and tuna sashimi - they used your typical square clear plastic container which was so wrong. if they call it a bento box, for heaven's sake use something that remotely looks like a bento box. the quality of both sashimi were below average, let alone small. above all, it was way overpriced for what we got.\n\nthere are plenty of sushi place in town with better food and better prices. we certainly will not return for what they have to offer.", "author": "JC I."}

I promptly looked it up on Yelp (out of habit)- only 3.5 stars? I normally wouldn't eat anywhere with a less than 4 star rating, because life is too short to eat shitty food, but desperate times call for desperate measures. We were all famished, and 7:30 is two hours past when my usual dinner time is. Unfortch, we missed their happy hour by 30 minutes. Would've been nice to get $1 oysters.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny and the seating is arranged so compactly. I couldn't figure out where to put my yoga mat for it to not be in the way of others. I ordered the unagi don and subbed the miso soup for seaweed salad for a $4 charge. It seems like they arbitrarily assigned this cost when I asked for the substitution, but I love seaweed and would've been willing to pay full price for it anyway. It came out with cucumbers arranged around the dish, which is super weird. I hate cucumbers, so I gave them to my friends. \n\nOur server tried to serve me a chicken teriyaki bowl, which is when I realized that he put in the wrong order. He didn't admit his mistake, but I knew from the nervous look on his face that he knew he'd messed up. I made it a point to show my displeasure because I was HANGRY. Every time he walked by, I would stare him down. My friends got their food and finished every last bite. 35 minutes later, I finally got my unagi rice bowl. The manager/owner (?) apologized for the delay, but by this point I was like whatever, just leave me be to stuff my face. You really can't go wrong with unagi; it's just inherently delicious, but it's unreasonably marked up. A bowl of rice and eel for $16? \n\nOur server offered each of us a scoop of green tea ice cream as penance for the long wait, and of course we accepted. There was also an adorable pup chilling at the table next to me, so the meal ended on a high note despite the mishap.", "author": "Karen S."}

Horribly quality sushi that left a bad taste in my boyfriend and I's mouth for literally days after. Fish is of the lowest quality, and by that I mean you're chewing on the raw fish for longer than comfortable to break up the stringy texture. It doesn't help that it has that old, frozen, fishy flavor that lingers in your mouth. The rolls were over flavored with sauces, probably to mask the fish flavor but to no avail.

It's probably one of the best deals I've found in city yet, both in terms of price and options. It's a great neighborhood spot (we've been living in the area for years, and have heard so many great things from friends/neighbors), where the regulars are greeted by name by the staff. Their happy hour menu is rather generous and we basically ordered every item on the menu. The $1 oysters (only on Tuesdays) was by far the best deal, along with the $1 miso soup, $2 edamame, $2 hand rolls, and $2 beer. Seriously though, what more do you need?? The oysters were fantastic (super creamy), wonderful miso and edamame (better than at most places), and generously sized hand rolls (for the price). \n\nService was fast and friendly, and they were taking happy hour orders until the very last minute. We also ordered the 49er roll, the creamy roll, the bluefin tuna special, tomago nigiri, and uni. The 49er roll was one of the best rolls I've ever had (no exaggeration), but the creamy roll was really hard to eat (the pieces fell apart as soon as you picked them up). The fish tasted incredibly fresh, and we left feeling very full and satisfied. \n\nMy only complaint (and the reason for a 4/5 star review) is the space constraints. The restaurant is incredibly small, and they have far too many tables crammed inside. Perhaps if the tables were smaller it would be easier, but we were practically sitting on top of the people around us. The diners next to us actually had to pull the table from the wall to get out of their seats. Beyond the cramped space, which is probably due to their awesome happy hour, I would highly recommend this spot. Fresh, reliable sushi and great happy hour prices!", "author": "Regina L."}

Not the very best maki I've ever had, but certainly quite good. Comes down to -- how much more time do you want to spend hunting up something possibly, maybe a little better?\n\nDeliberately went a little Bay Area homage crazy with a Raider roll (Halibut, White Tuna), 49er roll (Scallop, Salmon, Lemon) and a Giants roll (Spicy Hamachi and Salmon) -- must have hit on a good night as all were quite fresh tasting and with interesting contrasts between the rolls.\n\nAlso helped that the edamame was not overcooked or over-salted. Yay!\n\nPrices were merely OK, but on the upside our order was ready in about 20 minutes. Walking up to the very small corner space we'd passed many times during the week it was clear that -- for us -- take out was the way to go on this night of big hunger and a short window. Like many sushi ops staffing seemed iffy, with one guy trying to both greet take-out orders and wrangle cold beers from the cooler. You admire the want-to and the smiles amid the chaos, but you know something could go sideways. \n\nNo matter.\n\nIf you believe in imperfect, neighborhood joints you'll hit up Sushi Rapture for take out or for a more leisurely sit-down meal. It won't be perfect -- just very, very good.", "author": "Jeff T."}

We were quickly seated in the tiny space, and we ordered the following:\n1) SPIDER RAINOW ROLL: \n2) SWAMP ROLL: Which I loved, but that's because I have a strange affinity to seaweed salad.\n3) SNAKE ROLL: Which was pretty good (despite the fact that I'm not a huge fan of cilantro -- but my friend ordered it, so we got that).\n4) (SOME SORT OF NOODLE DISH): I really can't remember what my friend got. She was indifferent about it).\n5) BREADED SCALLOPS: Um. Okay -- so here's a story.\n\nWe ordered the BREADED scallops. We even pointed to the front, which was an appetizer. For some reason, we got a miso soup and salad with the breaded scallops (appetizer) -- but we were like, \"maybe it's just really good service\". Then we get teh scallops, super duper huge. Again, we just thought it was the restaurant.\n\nOnce we get the bill, we realized that they had charged us for the DEEP-FRIED scallops -- an entr\u00e9e, which was $10 more. We tell them that they made a huge mistake. We ask if they can reduce the payment to $8 (which was how much it originally cost), and we'll just give them a bigger tip. They go back to ask, and tell us scallops are really expensive (which I understand), and said that they would give us a $2 discount. REALLY? A $2 DISCOUNT, when it was YOUR fault? Then we ask again if they can change it, since really - we had explicitly said breaded scallops. They come back out and said that they would give us a $5 discount and free ice cream (however, my friends didn't want ice cream). So in the end, the waiter that took our order had absorbed the cost of the scallops in total.\n\nI felt bad for the guy. However, it was a pretty big mistake on his end (or whoever's end). We were pretty upset. The sushi was meh. I think I would just get delivery from them, but don't think I would ever go there to grab food at the restaurant again.", "author": "Joanne W."}

So tall you might have to order from the waitress. There is garnish covering all the fish in the neta cases - which is really weird. The place gets roasting so they have to keep the front door propped open with a barstool. The window walls will ensure your back is on fire before you get your first piece of fish. \n\nThe beer selection is limited - kirin, sapporo, and asahi. No tap. The rice was low grade, old, and squeezed far too hard under the nigiri. No gently falling apart or accent of wasabi under the fish. I could literally bounce the rice ball off my plate and the form was unmodified. The uni was from Santa Barbara, but wasn't sweet so it must have been low grade or old - I'm guessing this is due to the low demand. The ikura was old, foggy, and salty. The nori was chewy and old. They didn't carry real wasabi. \n\nThere was a few good things. The chef was honest enough. The hamachi belly was fatty and good.

But they do have Sushi Rapture--and while it's the best of the ones I've tried (Naked Fish, Sushi Rock, so many more...), it's just ok.\n\nLet's start with the good stuff--the prices are pretty reasonable. Not a deal per se, but a buck or two less expensive than many places. They also have a reasonably deep menu including sukiyaki and teriyaki.\n\nBut at the end of the day their nigiri and maki are just ok. The spider roll was loaded with lots of great crab, but their california roll was terrible, filled with pungent mock crab meat. The ebi tempura was way over fried and the maguro and uni were pretty bland.\n\nI'm not going to hurt SR too much on this--but the delivery experience was bad. I'll mention this on Seamless too because they need to be aware of it. I tipped this guy $4 and he wouldn't even come to my apartment. He called me from his cell outside of my apartment and was like \"uh, there's no parking, can you come down?\" I was like \"dude, I just tipped you four bucks and you won't deliver this to my door?\"\n\nHe also forgot chopsticks which I intentionally called out on Seamless.", "author": "Paul C."}

I have never before encountered fried seaweed pieces, but they do it here! I also got a sweet potato or carrot (didn't eat it, couldn't tell what it was under that fried stuff), and a broccoli. The chicken katsu was extremely heavily breaded, so much so that it was slimy in the middle next to the chicken. They gave a very generous portion though and it had a nice crunch to it. It also came with miso soup (average), rice (nicely cooked), salad (strangely filled with cabbage and clumpy dressing), two pieces of fried gyoza (okay), and a slice of orange (good palate cleanser). But for $7.95, I thought this was a damn good deal. And it was filling to boot! I'd consider returning to try out their rolls.

I was struck by how much the place felt like a noisy sports bar with both the patrons and the guy behind the sushi counter using booming voices to express their thoughts and feelings regarding the game being shown on the flat screen TV. The sushi was decent on that trip but I was so annoyed with everything about the visit that I held off on writing my review in order to give the place another chance. I really wanted this restaurant to be good as I love sushi and other Japanese food and it's just blocks from my house.\n\nI gave Sushi Rapture a second chance this afternoon. Once again the guy behind the sushi counter was yelling at other patrons (this time regarding his love for the A's). I ordered the lunch special choosing chicken karaage and beef teriyaki. The chicken karaage was doughy and limp --- with none of the usual crispiness. The beef teriyaki was only slightly better though very fatty. My companion described the California roll as \"not great\" and felt the rice was dry. The best thing about our lunch was the green tea. \n\nIf you're looking for a \"Cheers\"-like atmosphere, don't mind shelling out for mediocre food and prefer to eat with lots of yelling and commotion going on around you --- Sushi Rapture is a winning choice.\n\nI, however, will be seeking out a new sushi spot in the 'hood.", "author": "Miriam W."}

After we hung up, we looked at each other in disbelief since we're about 15 mins. away by car even in the best road condition at the projected speediness (he was on speakerphone) and said, \"Did he say 25 mins.?!\"  Well, 30 mins. later, our food arrived, much to our delight (we forgave the 5 mins. tardiness :-))\n\nWe ordered the following: Gyoza, Oshitashi, Salmon sashimi, combination sashimi and 49er roll.  The items that stood out for us are: the combination sashimi, a rather generous order with 5 different types of very fresh-tasting fish and the Salmon sashimi, a skimpy portion of thinly cut fish.  The rest were just fine, we were happy.  But what made us the happiest was the quick delivery time!/  Please don't ever change!!", "author": "Yvette F."}

Came here with a couple of friends and I was not happy with my food at all. I ordered a bento box and the food that I had was just flavorless and the portions are really small. Okay so I ordered a bento box with Tempura, Chicken Kara Age, and Beef Teriyaki. The bento box includes rice, small salad, miso soup, and tea (the basics). The Tempura was not hot and crispy it was merely soft and barely crispy. On top of that the tempura sauce was flavorless, just tasted like dipping your tempura into water. The Chicken Kara Age was not even crispy, but more oily than anything else. The beef teriyaki was prolly the best of the two items, but it still lacked great flavor, probably cheap meat. \n\nOverall, the prices are a little steep for the portions you are getting and it is not justifiable to be paying that much for bland food.

The sushi rice was more disappointing -- it was a little hard and tasted like plain rice, not the delicately flavored rice bed you'd find at a top-notch sushi-ya.  On the plus side, the presentation was very nice.  Each item came on it's own uniquely shaped and sized dish, the sprouts, sauces, pickled vegetables, et cetera that accompanied each dish were artfully arranged and eye pleasing.\n\nAll in all, if you live nearby, it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't make a trek from the opposite side of the city.  If you do go, take mass transit as parking in this neighborhood is incredibly limited.", "author": "Tom Y."}

And this place did...\n\nI just moved two blocks from here, but in the vicinity of Polk street.  When I go out to eat it's normally in that direction, although I have noticed occasional small restaurants and cafe's dotted about the residential areas of Nob Hill and wondered if they'd be good.  So when I checked Yelp on my cell phone for a sushi restaurant in my neighborhood I couldn't resist trying Sushi Rapture out.\n\nThere were four of us and we entered a fairly quiet restaurant at 8:15pm (little did they know it was about to get significantly louder courtesy of the company I keep ;-0).  It's an intimate restaurant with an exciting menu and very friendly staff.  We started with some cold Saki and edamame.  I'm a fan of warm edamame and this was served cold, however that's the one and only complaint i have of this place.\n\nWith the aid of our server we ordered four different maki rolls.  The Snake Roll, combining salmon, spicy tuna and cilantro was delicious and fresh.  The creamy roll, pairing spicy tuna and scallops was a surprise recommendation.  As an Englishman in this fair land I sometimes take offense at the number of things that you people like to deep fry (see also: Paula Deen, urgh).  However, this roll is dropped in the fryer before being served to give it a crispy seaweed covered coating and it was fantastic!  The warmth just penetrates the skins and outer rice but leaves the fish cool and raw on the inside.  I would seriously order one of these at a ball game if they stuck it in a bun and called it a Tokyo Dog.\n\nAs well as our Maki, we ordered two of the Special Nigiri.  The United featured Hamachi wrapped around rice with Tobiko, Black Tobiko and Wasabi Tobiko on top.  The Pumpkin was Salmon with a Spicy Scallop dressing on top.  Both of these were amazing and unlike other sushi dishes I see in the majority of restaurants.  The flavor combinations are a mixture of the traditional and modern, which would certainly appeal to the neighborhood crowd and are perfectly executed every time.\n\nWe finished our meal with a couple of Mochi Ice Creams, mango and red bean.  The mango was wonderful palate cleanser and the red bean left a delicious chocolatey taste in my mouth for the short stroll home (downhill thankfully).\n\nThe bill came to $28 a head including tip which i think is extremely reasonable for such high quality, well presented sushi.  I will most certainly be returning, shortly I expect, and will be ordering a Tokyo Dog with a selection of the remaining Special Nigiris.", "author": "Nick S."}

I noticed that the prices on the web-site menu were a bit high, but I figured, what the hell, maybe it's worth it. IT'S NOT. \n\nI ordered steamed shrimp pot-stickers, a regular salmon w/avocado roll, a rainbow roll, a special roll that has yellowtail and tuna w/avocado, and a small green salad. The mixed green salad wasn't on the menu, but I had asked for it and figured it wouldn't be more than 5 bucks considering the prices of the other salads on the menu. I also guesstimated the price of the salmon and avocado roll at around $6.00 (on the high end). I said I would pay cash. \n\nWhen the delivery man arrived (with decent timing), he didn't have an itemized list for me to look at with prices, but turned out my total was about $45.00 (no receipt). But I was hungry and again, thought \"it might be worth it\". ITS NOT.  \n\nI called the restaurant to ask what the prices were for the items I ordered. Turned out, my salmon and avocado roll was $9.00!! That's crazy making. I told them that I thought it was high, and the lady on the phone told me to hold and basically put on another, much ruder, lady to let me know that they have \"always done it like that\". They were so unfriendly and obnoxious. I didnt expect them to change anything, but at least hear me out and maybe take into consideration that they are charging almost double of what all other sushi places are charging. \n\nAnyway, as for the food itself, I got it upstairs and this is what I found: \nOil drenched (not steamed) small meek little pot stickers - I think I could have had better from a frozen bag at TJ's. \nThree rolls that looked neatly made, but when I ate them realized that the fish was warm and mushy, as was the rice - not well seasoned at all and definitely over-cooked. \nTiny cabbage based salad - their house salad has a thick nasty mayo as the dressing. Its SO unimpressive. \n\nOverall, I give this place one lonesome star. If you're going to charge such high prices and think you're so swanky, have the food to back it up. I guess its back to Naked Fish for delivery...at least they're affordable and somewhat fresh.", "author": "Alisa M."}

Normally when I get saba gari maki at other places, the ginger is minimal so the taste is mainly mackerel.  At Sushi Rapture, it pretty much tastes like a ginger roll.  Mackerel has a really strong taste, so for the ginger to overpower it is pretty impressive.  Needless to say, because I don't like ginger, I don't think I'll be getting the saba gari maki again.\n\nHotategai nigiri (5.95$)  - I was kind of surprised.  Maybe I'm not sure what \"good\" scallops taste like, but the scallops here were literally tasteless and kind of soft.  A piece literally fell off as I was holding it.  I prefer more taste and more \"rubbery\" textured scallops.  Also kind of expensive.\n\nSaba nigiri (4.50$) - Good stuff.  Big, thick cuts.\n\nUnited \"Special nigiri\" (6.95$) - This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  Tobiko, black tobiko, and wasabi tobiko, sitting on a bed of rice, wrapped in hamachi.  It looked and tasted amazing.  If anything, it was almost tobiko overload because those suckers were seriously stuffed, but oh man, so so delicious.\n\nAdded some extremely poor-quality photos of my food.\n\nI saw a lot of orders being placed for delivery and take out and their to go menu claims free delivery, so if it weren't so criminally close, I would probably be taking advantage of that.  I sat at the bar, but the empty tables looked really close together and cramped, so I'm not sure what the atmosphere would be like with people actually sitting in them.\n\nI will be going back to this place as often as my checking account allows.", "author": "emilie k."}

Service is attentive, the menu is expansive and well priced, and the food is delicious. We had a shrimp scampi appetizer, tuna tataki and a rainbow roll, washed down with Asaki and Sapporo beers. We just missed happy hour, which is offered Thursday through Saturday until 6:30. The happy-hour specials looked great, so I'll be returning soon to check them out.", "author": "Jason B."}

I decided to order delivery, which came relatively quickly.  Upon opening the box, I recoiled.  The sushi was not fresh and all and had the disgusting overly fishy taste and odor.  I was horribly disappointed and ended up throwing half of it out.  The second time I ordered from them was even worse.  This sushi is terrible and anyone who loves fresh fish should not go here.  Word to the wise- Wasabi and Ginger delivers much better sushi.  Order from them and never, ever go here.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Instead I finished the side salad and any granule of rice not soaked with sauce (about a tablespoon worth).  Salty.  Better break out the high blood pressure tablets.  So not worth it.", "author": "K W."}

Friendly staff, affordable prices and the best list of sushi and rolls in town. Remember to check out the specials... they are always worth it. The only downside: it is closed on Monday nights.", "author": "Claudio B."}

I usually get my meals to go since it's so close to home.  Great neighborhood dining - it's about the size of my apartment, but makes for cozy and intimate dining.  \n\nI recommend trying items listed on their \"Specials\" board. The fresh Oyster variety of the day is a treat.  For the less adventurous, the Spider Rainbow Roll is delicious, and the Hamachi Kama is quite tasty.", "author": "Caryn L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-12", "description": "I live super close and go here at least once a month, I would go more if I could afford it. If you live in Nob Hill this should become a staple of your diet. If you like unagi the Cal Rock is awesome, I always get that and then ask Sam, the chef, what he recommends for the day. The cool thing about Sam is that he actually goes and buys the fish everyday so he knows what is really good and fresh for that particular day. Lesser chefs would probably recommend whatever they are trying to get rid of before it goes bad, but what he recommends is always really good and fresh and that keeps me coming back. The E-Rich roll is also awesome if you are a real glutton like myself.", "author": "Erich G."}

Not the best sushi bar I've ever been to, but worth a try.  Some dishes are a little better than others.  Interior decor is kind of hip.", "author": "Eric G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-29", "description": "We were excited about Sushi Rapture based on the reviews we had seen, but were sorely disappointed when we finally got to try it out. The edamame was cold and way overcooked (think floppy), the miso soup left much to be desired, and the sushi itself was merely okay, but nothing special. And to top it all off, the service was almost non-existent. Our friend did enjoy the vegetarian rolls, but that was the only highlight of our visit. Based on the other reviews, it seems that we got unlucky, but we won't be going back to Sushi Rapture because there are other, more satisfying options in the area.", "author": "Michael L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-28", "description": "Good sushi.  Nigiri and maki are fairly standard.  The \"special nigiri\" deserves recognition for being both different and delicious and many feature quail egg.  I'm a big fan of the \"United\" special nigiri.  The atmosphere is a bit cramped, but friendly and pleasant.  In addition, delivery to Nob Hill arrives in under 20 minutes.", "author": "Megan S."}

I am always skeptical of any first time at a sushi restaurant, but this was very fresh fish, presented nicely and extremely attentive, yet not annoying, good service. \n\nThe downside is that the place is so brightly lit, I am convinced they would double or triple their business if they just dimmed the lights a little..", "author": "Keith H."}

It's fast, friendly, and delicious. They have great deals, the bento boxes are rad. The girls who work there are all really pretty and helpful. I'm all about this place. Not too pricy either. It's a bit small inside so I wouldn't advise large groups.. great for take out though.", "author": "Katie M."}

The specials are excellent and the fish is fresh. I loved the rolls. We have always be able to get in quickly even on the weekends which makes it a great neighborhood place. The only think I would not recommend and why it lost 1 star is the chicken in the noodle soup, not so good. Thankfully the rest of our meal was outstanding.", "author": "Cbr A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-08-22", "description": "This place is pretty weak. I just went here for the second time today, sat down and asked for a cup of tea. A good first indicator as to the quality of a sushi restaurant is how they serve their tea. Well, the waitress brings out this huge glass cup with a stem - totally inappropriate for drinking a hot cup of tea with my sushi. It had a nasty bitterness to it as well. Ordered agedashi tofu as an appetizer which came quickly - the flavor was right but the texture was off. I got the sushi combo with 6 peices nigiri and a salmon roll. The pieces of fish were unimpressive and the taste was average at best. Not that it was totally unappetizing, but the fish just wasn't fresh enough for my taste. Total came to 22 dollars with tip. Skip this place, save up some money and go to okoze sushi a few blocks away on hyde.", "author": "Max L."}

Sammy (sushi chef) is extremely personable and speaks english really well (unlike many other asian owned/operated restaurants). i know he knows what i'm asking for and after going with all of his recommendations (esp the creamy roll!!!!), i know that what i order is going to be delish. and fresh. and fast, because naturally for this city it's small but never obnoxiously crowded.\n\nyummy....i'm getting hungry just thinking about it (the sushi, not the chicken...).", "author": "Claire M."}

Ask for Sammy when you go there, his taste and skill in fish is amazing (gets his fish every morning). Service is always super friendly! Be adventurous and try the Pumpkin roll and the United Nigiri...you will never find that anywhere else....well, I haven't. The Butterfish is no joke. A casual, friendly place where everybody knows your name.", "author": "DT l."}

The snake roll, United special nigiri, and pickle salad are perfection. Parking in the Nob Hill hood is a pain if you don't live nearby (we used to live down the block), but is worth the hike. Plus, it's fun to check out all the first-daters that come in...trying to impress each other with their chopstick skills.", "author": "Sarah Y."}
