At the peak lunch hour the place was completely packed with a long line (like every other place in SOMA). The good news is that the line moves fast. The menu is simple Vietnamese Banh Mi, Bowls or Rolls. I decided to get the Roasted Duck Banh Mi ($7) to-go.

The more detailed review is as follows: the duck meat was dry, but they tried to mask that with a lot of au jus, which simply made the sandwich wet, while not doing much for the meat. The French roll was way too crunchy for my liking and lastly a single sandwich would be sufficient only for a light meal.\n\nPrice wise it was about where other sandwiches, burgers and hot dogs are in the area. I can get a Banh Mi off a cart outside my office in FiDi for $4.50 so in that sense you are paying for the rent rather than the food.

Most of it is lettuce and vegetables, definitely not alot of rice noodle at all. I don't even remember eating rice noodles. The pork portion was surprisingly large, but the quality is extremely low. A lot of it is fat, and it's not the juicy, smoky, lemongrass pork you'd find at almost any other Vietnamese joints. I found the pork quite dry. Their sauce also left much to be desired. It's kind of bland rather than sweet and tangy. Overall, the most disappointing Vietnamese rice bowl you'll find in the city. Luckily didn't pay that much for it.

I'm here all the time in the city, and you can count on a few things including unpredictable weather and a mad lunch rush to every restaurant around. Not quite as dependable (but almost) is their ability to handle a rush, but happily that's not the case at DragonEats.\n\nWe mobbed the place just before noon and packed the line out the door. Ever drop a sugar-filled candy on the forest floor? Within seconds they swarm and overtake it. Like locusts in our own proverbial plague of hungry people, I was afraid we'd never get out of there with our food in the short time allotted for lunch.\n\nI'm happy to report that indeed, this SF lunch-focused eatery did not let me down. It was almost as though I didn't stop moving in the line, and submitted my order within a few minutes, then only waited a few for my food to be ready. The place cleared out in 15 minutes as seating is limited and many took their meals to go, but I ended up staying and sitting at the front window \"bar\" seating.\n\nI shared a few sandwiches. Their menu lists them as banh my, but I've always seen it banh mi, and I'm just not food savvy enough to know if that's a creative choice, a real thing, or even a typo. So let's just call it a Vietnamese sandwich. I sampled three: roasted pork, le sardine, and the duck. For me, the winner was the duck followed by the sardine. I loved the roasted pork but I wanted a little more punch in the flavor as it came off a little sweet. But I'd gladly eat any of them again.\n\nThe real kicker here is the price. I know banh mi are typically very affordable, but for this city you seem to end up paying more. Even so, the most expensive sandwich was $7, and seven bucks for ANY lunch is a smokin' deal. \n\nBeyond banh mi, they do a vermicelli bowl or soup, but when you have such an interesting variety of sandwiches in front of you, you dive into them and go for it. \n\nThis spot was definitely a Yelp app victory. Such tasty food served up in lightning speed (witchcraft?) at really affordable prices makes it a city lunch spot trifecta champion.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I ordered the teriyaki tofu bowl (which came with rice noodles, pickled celery, daikon, and carrots, cilantro [a little too much for me, but I'm one of \"those\" people], roasted peanuts, and crispy shallots) and a teriyaki tofu roll (which had rice noodles, red leaf lettuce, and mint) because I was unsure if either would be filling enough. Two things:\n1. There was plenty of food... the slabs of tofu are thick and hearty, and they don't skimp on the other ingredients either. Going back to paragraph one: I made it very clear that I wouldn't be sharing my rolls (since I never get to enjoy this kind of thing)... and in the end, I did, because there really was enough to go around (and vegetarians are nicer, anyway).\n2. Both items were DELICIOUS. And, somehow, despite being almost exactly the same thing (except one was deconstructed and one wasn't)... they actually tasted different! What kind of magic is that? Peanut sauce was delish, and don't forget to load up on sriracha!\n\nSure the queue can grow long, but it moves through quickly. Knowing all this, I will absolutely be making this a regular stop when I'm in San Francisco for work, and until then will pout as my little corner of the world doesn't have anything quite like this.

It wasn't as big as I was expecting, but it's still quite filling so I'm not complaining. They've got a good meat to veggie ratio, and the chicken had so much flavor I was surprised! The meat was tender, and the sauce accompanying the chicken complemented it really well. The veggies that they use have that pickled taste, and along with the cilantro, they balance out the rich flavor of the meat. The sandwich is filling, but not heavy, if that makes sense.

I would say based on the few places I've tried (disclaimer), that's true - based on the price and quality. Bun Mee is a little more expensive and the other place I like is Cafe Dolci. I've also heard good things about the quality of the vietnamese coffee - they have Cafe Du Monde all over the place. If you like Cafe Du Monde coffee, you're in for a treat. \n\nThe ratio of meat to bread was good. The five spice chicken is very flavorful, and they didn't overload on veggies. They also put pate in the sandwich, which made it extra delicious. The jalapenos were cut thin, so it wasn't overly spicy. Overall a pretty good banh mi sandwich.

When our order came up we popped open the wrappers and traded halves of each of our sandwiches so we could both experience the way of the Dragon. \n\nThe smells these sammie's were emitting were intoxicating.

They were also good but I think I will go back to our original choices when we first ventured in but I also won't hesitate to try other options on the menu such as the Fresh Rolls and Bowls. \n\nGreat friendly service, cool atmosphere and a tremendous value in this area of the FiDi / SOMA.

First of all, the price is right. Second of all, the fresh rolls are to die for. After I came here for the first time a couple of years ago, I couldn't help but come every day for lunch during the work week since it is a quick walk from my office, incredibly delicious and fast. I order the same thing every time- the shrimp rolls and the chicken avocado rolls. One order is never enough for me because they are just THAT GOOD. Toan is the owner/manager and he is the friendliest, nicest person and makes my lunch hour that much more enjoyable every single day. The other thing I love about DragonEats is how consistent it is. I never feel like I'm getting skimpy portions or that they have ever failed to deliver me exactly what I expect on a daily basis.", "author": "Natalie S."}

The huge lines should have led me to try it earlier, but it's weird location just doesn't lend itself to a casual walk by and discovery. Set across from the Mexican Consulate is one of the most legit Vietnamese lunch spots ever. While nothing state-side ever tastes exactly like what you would find in Vietnam do mainly to ingredient portion size, source and protein diet differences - this place not only comes close but is just incredibly tasty. I think their Banh Mi would beat out most in the city. What's even more impressive is what a machine their operation is all while maintaining great sandwich construction.

I had ordered the Garlic Butter chicken \"banh my\", and overall is was decent. The entire thing cost $7.34 including tax, which is not terrible, but the sandwich definitely could be bigger for the price. There was plenty of ingredients jammed packed into the sandwich, which was a highlight. The bread, pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalape\u00f1o were all delicious, but the chicken wasn't that great. It had the consistency of canned tuna, which I found off putting. The marinade was ok, but I probably wouldn't order again.\n\nI would like to try other things off of the menu, so I will definitely come back, and hopefully I can beat the line again. \n\nUpdate: I had the Pork bowl, and that was great!

When you're inside, it's probably close to 5-10 minutes. I don't know what kind of magic they use, but this place is a well-oiled machine.\n\nSandwiches are decently-sized. They're not huge, but they're not tiny - it's basically a \"healthy\" portion of sandwich, I guess. Not that I'm the person to ask for healthy, because tasty is better than healthy to me any day. Bread is crunchy on the outside, sandwiches are filled up on the inside. They scoop out the bread in the middle to stuff it with more non-bread stuff. I've had the pork and the garlic butter chicken, and I think the pork is my favorite, but I'd definitely eat either one.\n\nYes, you can definitely get cheaper banh mi at a Vietnamese restaurant somewhere in the middle of the city or in Little Saigon in San Jose, but this is my favorite lunch option on Fridays because no other place has banh mi of this deliciousness. I've never had a bad sandwich here, and somehow, I feel like it's healthier. It could also be wishful thinking, though. Plus, the carrots here are really good. Like, really weirdly good.

They serve very fresh Vietnamese bowls, banh mi, salads, and rolls (all $6). You can choose chicken, pork, or tofu as the protein in all of these. They operate in an open kitchen with a very quick production line; I literally waited less than a minute for my food, which is a good or bad thing.\n\nI opted for the 5-spice chicken bowl, which came with an assortment of veggies, peanuts, vermicelli noodles, and fish sauce. It was very refreshing, and a moderate value for the price. There really is nothing bad to say about DragonEats, but it is also unmemorable and the food is easy to piece together on your own. At $6, it's not a bad price for a light work lunch.", "author": "Jessica F."}

Great as a lunch option. \n\nIn the Embarcadero/SOMA part of town there really isn't much for lunch options.  So the whole office was very excited at the prospects of DragonEats opening up just 2 blocks away from us. \n\nThey offer some great Vietnamese staples; Bahn-Mi, Fresh Rolls, Vermicelli salads, all $6.50 each (plus taxes).   Compare to other lunch options such as Spice Kit, it taste and feels fresher and its cheaper too. \n\nThough there's not much waiting space and there's always some confusion about whether people are in line to order or in line waiting for their food.  Maybe instead of a number system they can do the buzzer thing, then we don't have to wait around the same area waiting for our food. \n\nAlso there's not much sitting room.  So take out is best. \n\nEither way, this is a solid lunch place.", "author": "Maggie F."}

Perfectly substantial \"light\" lunch for 6 bucks. You can't beat it. And I see some reviews mentioning small-ish portions -- if you need more food, order two dishes and it's still only $12... easy fix.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the customer service is beyond outstanding.

Shower chairs aren't exactly the most sanitary thing I could be touching before lunch so I really wanted to wash my hands before eating, not to mention that after a day of marathon home visits and meetings I needed to pee. I thought I could resolve all three of my issues easily by ducking in here for lunch. I order a 5-spice chicken banh mi (just ok, nothing to get excited about) and a coke. After paying and giving a 15% tip to a cafe with no table service I asked to use the bathroom. The woman behind the counter told me they do not have one and I should walk to the Starbucks on 2nd to use theirs. HOLD THE FREAKIN DOOR. Do you expect me to believe that you really have no bathroom for your paying customer? I call bullshit. And I called the Health Department.", "author": "Meagan M."}
