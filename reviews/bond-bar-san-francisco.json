A little more than half of the seats were taken at 9 pm when we came, but we were able to find three seats to sit together at the bar.\n\nTwo of us started off with the Hooch negroni and penicillin, and another one of us got a pisco drink off the menu. The negroni was just as expected and penicillin was good, but a little too sweet for my taste. Surprisingly, the one pisco drink we paid for in the round was the one that tasted the worst - it basically had no taste with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nThe next round was better for all of us; I got the tamarind margarita special and asked the bartender not to make it too sweet, so it was a good balance of sweetness and tartness. I can't remember what the rest of my party ordered, but it was all pretty good.\n\nThe bartenders were pretty nice and the vibe was cool.

When I'm socializing at a bar the last thing I want to do is say hold on, let me take down the name of this cocktail. I got a drink with egg white because egg whites make every drink creamy and delicious (seriously, I've never had a bad drink that contains egg white, but then again the bars that usually serve egg white drinks are usually into their craft. Ain't nobody got time for food poisoning if they do it wrong!) \n\nI also tried their spicy margarita. Mainly because I was socializing and wasn't going to take the time to pour over their drink menu again (which is worth pouring over if you have the time). Their spicy margarita is solid. It has the right amount of kick and this is coming from someone who hates spice.\n\nThe bartenders handle a large group well and it wasn't too busy for a Tuesday night. (I seriously don't understand how bars in San Francisco are busy on Tuesday nights, but that may be the old person Tampa Bay resident in me. Here, however, it wasn't packed until we showed up with a hoard of people).\n\nIt is a dark bar, but you can still see who you are talking to. There is a large space in the back with seating if you do come with a bigger group.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this place and would recommend it to someone looking for a low-key night of craft cocktail drinking.", "author": "Christina G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-21", "description": "If I were the owner, or even a bartender here, I'd kick anyone out that ordered a martini shaken, not stirred. For one, don't go for the obvious joke. If you want to reference James Bond movies that's fine, but at least show a little creativity, ya?\n\nThe real reason to kick them out, though, is these guys sling a nice enough cocktail that they don't need some knucklehead telling them how to make their drinks. Sure, you could probably order a martini but let them make it without you micromanaging. Trust they know their craft. Side note: I've always thought it's funny that Bond orders his martini shaken; sure it might have a smoother flavor, but he's all kinds of arrogant about having them shake it, which is only going to chip the ice and make it melt faster, thus watering down the drink faster.\n\nIt's a little dark, a little loud, but honestly, very tolerable in the volume and ambiance category. I'm not a drinker, so ambiance is especially important and when I need to go with a bunch of coworkers to a place, I'm very relieved when I don't have to shout. It wasn't the loudest here, so we could still have a conversation.\n\nThe report on the specialty cocktails is good. This being SF I always get a little sticker shock on craft cocktails, but it's perfectly in line with the city's prices. Plus you can ask about specials or see about well drinks and save a few nickels.\n\nFun visit, good convos, and I was able to duck out after a few and enjoy the rest of what the neighborhood had to offer.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I enjoyed a riff on a Manhattan that was damn good, and while I usually like those drinks up, this one was served over, and Bond gets bonus points for that being over a big ol' cube. \n\nThe fact that this is the default for so many SF bars still surprises me, but I guess it shouldn't. I mean, they all have a craft cocktail menu, their whiskey selections, while small, can certainly rival all I regularly encounter, and the staff always seems to know their stuff, which adds up to the fact that these are pretty legit bars with legit clientele who demand a certain standard.\n\nIt's pretty refreshing to see neighborhood bars NOT cutting corners in SF. If you're going to be paying the prices, you have a right to expect them to go the extra mile.\n\nBond did not disappoint at all.", "author": "Michael T."}

It was actually a hotel that was remade into a bar, which gives you that old SF vibe that we love so much.  Just be aware that the bar is pretty small, but it's not that crowded.  So you can't even tell that it's a small venue.  \n\nI would say the drink menu is pretty creative. They offer vodka, gin, tequila, mezcal, whiskey, rum, etc cocktails.  And they produce their own twist of the classic cocktails.  Whatever you're in the mood for, there's a drink for you.  They also incorporate fresh fruits/juices in the cocktail as well, which makes their drinks of high quality.  \n\nHere are a couple that I tried.  \nErin wonderland: refreshing and tart with the grapefruit flavor. The thyme adds a nice to balance the drink.\nValencia Martinez: it's like a gin Manhattan. Or you can think of if it as a lighter and less sweet version of a negroni. Pretty interesting combination and twist to the classic drinks.\n\nI'll be back whn I'm in the Mission district.", "author": "Shirley C."}

At first we were hesitant about Bond because it seemed too nice, but it turned out to be nice while remaining reasonably priced at $10 per cocktail.\n\n[THE CRAFTINESS]\n\nThere is a decent variety of cocktails, and they were well crafted. Bonus star for the extra flair in presentation: star anise frozen in an ice cube, a flamboyant twig of rosemary, a lemon slice of perfect radial symmetry, and an L-shaped floral sprig (though the L kept making me think that I was drinking a latte). \n\n[THE AMBIANCE]\n\nIt's hip without being too hip: a back area lit primarily by the glowing purple stained-glass tables, the spaciously minimalist arrangement that appears more like SJ than SF because you get too used to seeing densely packed layouts, and the large projector on the back wall which gives an overall lively feel (though I guess scenery isn't as hip as say, the black-and-white movie trailers projected at the Alchemist) \n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nI liked it! Bond is perhaps not as ratchet as what you'd come to the Mission for; rather it's more SoMA-esque (actually reminded me a lot of Singlebarrel in Downtown SJ). But then again, since it is located in the Mission you can sound ratchet in telling people you went to bars in the Mission, without having to deal with ratchet bars of the Mission. And yes, I hate the word ratchet too but it is just too fitting of a word choice.", "author": "Edna C."}

When you walk in, you have the entire bar to your right, and stools lined up. Towards the back, you have a few couches, and a large banquet table that divide the men and women's restrooms.\n\nWe went here with a few friends, grabbed a few seats at the couches. It wasn't too loud, so we were able to have conversation across without difficulty. The ambience is dark, moody, exactly how I like my cocktail lounges.

The designers did nice job, if a tad lacking in personality. \n\nDrink menu was mediocre at best, nothing I was dying to try and what we finally settled on was not memorable and mostly all ice in the glass, leaving not much drink.\n\nI recently wrote a friend who has been bartending for 20+ years in the city. He is the epitome of customer oriented, craft mixologist and knows his job inside and out. I was asking if he knew any great bartenders in need of a job, his response was:\n\n\"A lot of the young \"mixologists\" are too self important to be good bartenders. More emphasis on themselves than on customer service.\"\n\nThat explains Bond Bar's bartenders to a tee!! What has happened to customer service??\n\nWe went in around 8 on a Friday night, sat at bar and had THE WORST service I've ever gotten. Bartender was aloof, totally disinterested in answering questions about the cocktail list and then became condescending when she finally did answer. Bartenders stood around talking to one another rather than paying attention to guests. My date ordered a drink and I told bartender  I was going to try his first, to see if I wanted to order that, or something else. The moment he ordered she grabbed cocktail menu away. (? Um.. what about me?) His drink was boring, Ice packed and lacking in a balance if flavors. I definitely wanted something else but couldn't get a cocktail menu back to save my life. Nor could I get any service. The place had no more than 2 dozen patrons with 4 staff behind bar, yet none of them seemed to care less that I was trying to get service. Perfect opportunity to sell me something, even up sell me something, yet no one could be bothered. My date was so turned off by lack of service, lack of a decent drink and lack of an sort of interest or engagement from bar staff that he just wanted to leave. Thing is, we couldn't even get a check so we could leave! Finally, half hour to 45 minutes later we got a bartender, paid and left.\n\nHere's the thing Bond Bar, in the hour we were there you could of easily sold us 4 drinks, a good bottle of wine or champagne, made the house some money and yourself a sizable tip. My date and I both worked as bartenders/waiters for many years and overtip every time. Instead, you sold us a single drink, made next to nothing for the house, and even though we still tipped you generously, we won't be back.

The Oakland Sour I'm assuming is their unique twist on a Whiskey Sour which is why I went for it. Like I said, I was clearly not at all disappointed. My friend went for the Strawberry Gin Gimlet, which I can tell from Yelp seems like a top seller. And yeah...probably owns up to it. I can tell it's on the stronger side but not in a bad way-- my friend really enjoyed it. We only hoped the strawberry infused ice cube could melt quick enough to get those juicy strawberry slices but it didn't melt fast enough.\n\nSlick, simple ambiance. Great for long, intimate conversations and company. The bouncer saw us standing and offered to sit us on their large wrap around seating area in the front even though there were only 2 of us.

The decor is a little on the classy side, and though it does seem to attract a lot of the bourgeois crowd, I always bring my own group of friends rather than going there to meet new people.\n\nDid I mention that the bathrooms are clean?\n\nI appreciate how little an effort is made to be a pseudo-dive bar hipster destination. Sometimes you don't want your feet to stick to the floor when you walk into a bar. You want to feel like the place is cared about by the owners.\n\nAlso, clean bathrooms.\n\nI've had the strawberry gimlet that everyone seems to love, and it was good. There's also a drink I can't remember the name of where they plop a bunch of basil in, and it is refreshing and totally delicious. The Richmond is probably my favorite. I keep ordering it despite the high probability that it has been the primary cause of at least two mild hangovers. Every cocktail I've tried has been really good, and they have a great selection of top-shelf booze.\n\nAnd the bathrooms have always been clean ;).", "author": "Christopher L."}

The two of us were sitting at a side table along the wall, and people kept bumping into us, because the bar was too many people deep. How frustrating!\n\nPlus the drinks are not very strong, though I will admit that the bartenders are very attentive, even when there is a mob of people trying to get their attention.

I'm now going to write the review I wish I had read before going. I don't take this lightly, and I don't often post negative reviews (this is my first one-star review since joining Yelp in 2009), but the fact that the overall rating on Yelp currently stands at 4 stars and most of the reviews I've seen so far read like they're about a totally different bar than the one I visited has convinced me to take a trip to the dark side.\n\nBond is the bar equivalent of a Potemkin village. The location used to house a dive bar and it has since been bleached of all personality and turned into a charmless facsimile of a cocktail bar. It is prodigiously devoid of personality. \n\nThe space is poorly laid out: a bottleneck at the bar opens up to an expanse of, well, not much. The back of the bar is a white box with a few tables and chairs, and two doors at the back to the men's and ladies' rooms (which contain one toilet apiece, so queues stretch down the walls). The sole decoration eliciting any reaction from a visitor is the looping projection on the back wall. (Yes, the back wall is barren enough for a projection.) Bond feels empty even when it's crowded thanks to the large unornamented space above guests' heads.. \n\nThe drinks were mediocre. Although the bartender was attentive, she couldn't do anything to save the ill-conceived menu. I had a juniper pisco sour that tasted more like medicine than most things I consumed the last time I had a cold. For $10, it wasn't worth it.\n\nOn a Saturday night, the place was packed with badly dressed 23 year-olds. Which is fine, if that's your thing.

Totally wasn't expecting to see the game on when we walked into the bar.  Definitely will be here again. The only pain was the parking but it's the Mission but this location is so easy to get to via so that's an option.", "author": "Maria V."}

My wife liked her drink, was quite spicy but overall experience was crappy. Would recommend the other bars across the street more than this place. $10+ for a crappy cocktail is not worth it!", "author": "Michael L."}

And let's just say that if I have any more of these strawberry gimlets, I'm going to have to ask the strawberry suspended in the big cube to move in with me.", "author": "Justin S."}

If they would have live music or a dj and play sports it would be excellent. You can see the boring traffic report they call art from anyplace in the bar. Imagine if that were the Giants or warriors game...just go to skylark and wait in line for a better time.", "author": "Andrea G."}

It's calm and classy, and I really like the drink selection - the bold cuban is my favorite so far. The bartenders are super chill but still super efficient. On the weekends it's waaaaay too 'untz untz untz' for my taste and gets absolutely packed with kids in button downs and stilettos.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Flock wall paper and arch over the bar, fantastic.  Yesterday was my third visit and the tonic was flat in our G&Ts.  The bar man did replace but was all a bit of an effort.  All the tables at the back were 'reserved' forcing everyone to the front to make the place look busy at 5pm (a cheap trick?).  I know its the holiday season and the bar staff are tired and would rather be somewhere else, but do they have to show it.  Bit more interested in themselves than in the customers, was the impression I got.  Shame, as 'liked this bar very much.  Can't see it lasting with this amount of competition close by.", "author": "Michael D."}

The standard drinks are small and pack a very light punch.  I call a vodak soda or a gin and tonic- a regular drink.  I wont seek this out again, but give it a three because it's not offensive.", "author": "Rochelle K."}

It's a dim lit bad with big romantic velvet seats in the back with beautiful videos of San Francisco scenery playing in the background. Good mix of music too :). Bartender is awesome and he gave us drinks and talked with us.  Had a special drink with Bourbon, Ginger, Lime, and Mint!", "author": "Kristin C."}

Enter BOND,geez what a different atmosphere altogether. Swanky, dark,beautifully decorated. Great drink quality, my margarita was refreshing on a hot day. My friend got a Moscow Mule which looked very untraditional (i.e no copper mug),but he said it was really good. I definitely will be back ,be aware though it's on the expensive side.", "author": "Lauren V."}

Seems designed to siphon off bridge-and-tunnel traffic before it gets to Skylark or Blondies. Lounge-y, characterless. If a clean, cavernous space is what you seek, you'll do fine here.", "author": "Armin T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "The strawberry gimlet comes with a large ice cube with a frozen strawberry in it. The drink itself is tasty and refreshing, not too sweet. It's a little pricey for the quantity of beverage you get, but the strawberry ice cube is a gimmick I totally fall for. The night we went was fairly empty and we got a huge spacious booth in the back. Seems like a great place to take someone on a first date.", "author": "Amy Y."}

I enjoy this vibe too. Candle lit, sophisticated mission I would call it.  The bartenders are smart and engaging.  I love a dive as much as anyone but I can come here too meet some nice people and still enjoy the place with the nostalgia of its past.  Bathrooms are a lot better than  before, for those who remember the men's room of the prior bar.", "author": "Ryan M."}
