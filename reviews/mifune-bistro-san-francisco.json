I decided to ignore the alarm bells going off in my head, again due to my history with the establishment.  \n\nWe were seated immediately and waited 5 to 10 minutes for one of the two waitresses to come by and take our order.  We ordered 4 sushi rolls and one bowl of Nabeyaki udon.  The food came in a decent amount of time, although not all at once, which was fine.\n\nThe rolls - caterpillar, spider, rainbow and a shrimp tempura filled roll, were okay.  I've had better and I've had worse but I had no complaints about these.  However, the udon noodles were not good.  The noodles are not fresh but rehydrated.   It came with an egg, a shrimp tempura (was it frozen?), fish cake, chicken thigh meat and some vegetables.  The broth was extremely salty and I could not take more than a few sips of it.  I was so thirsty the evening and subsequent morning following this meal.  \n\nService was fine, as we did not experience any notable issues.  We received our water and tea as requested, but they were not refilled.  We could see the waitresses were swamped and didn't request refills.  I do wish I had seen all the warnings here of the added service charge but since I didn't pay the bill I cannot speak to it personally.\n\nMifune is not what it was (at least in my head).

I had to walk up to a worker again, just to get a refill of my water. When the other table asked for napkins, they got it instantly.

And this is where it starts to go downhill... We sat there for 10+ minutes, waiting for a server to come by or bring us water, and nada! After awhile, a group of Caucasian folks seated next to us, got their water immediately and ordered their food within 2 minutes. We had to flag down the waiter that helped the table next to us to order our own food! At this point, I was already irritated by their services and the wait. \n\nWe ordered fried soft shell crab for starters and I had the seafood ramen. I was a little disappointed with the soft shell crab, it only came with one, the decor around the crab looks better than the taste. My seafood ramen had no wow factor. The broth looked oily, dark, and the overall taste of my ramen was bland. After we finished, we sat there waiting another 10-15 minutes for someone to come by and check on us, still no one bothered stopping by. Once again we flagged down a random server to get us our check! He dropped off our check and disappeared again for another 5+ minutes!!! At this point, I was furious and almost tempted to walk out and ditch the bill. Once again, we flagged down the server to give him my card to pay the bill, we also made a verbal complaint that the services we had was terrible and unacceptable. The server didn't care to acknowledge our complaint. \n\nOverall, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!

We waited and waited and trying look for a waitress but most of them was too far to be called. so we just got up and paid at the cashier. I noticed that they automatically added 18% service charge for 4 people and when I asked them they said because they are so busy that they have to add the tip automatically. The truth was we went to this restaurant just because from that entire Japantown, they are the only one that doesn't have line of people waiting, the place was not even full and we got a table right away. In other words they are not that busy at all. The food was bad, the service was bad and they have a guts to charge us 18% service charge up front? WOW! No wonder people are giving them bad reviews... I will never come back to this place again.", "author": "Jennifer U."}

Now, I don't know if it's because of the sudden influx of customers due to the events or that they're just warming up for opening but it took them a good 15-20 minutes to get us our food on the table. The waitress mistakenly gave me the wrong ramen bowl. No one on our table ordered it but the correct order was promptly given soon after. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Ramen w/ broth soup and while the soup was good, I felt like it was nothing too special. I was able to finish it towards the end and enjoyed most of it. Lunch specials there were kind of pricey as well.\n\nService was below average. Water was brought to us once and they never came back. We had to flag them down and play the waiting game. Waitresses didn't look friendly, no smiles. Tip was already on the bill I believe (not too happy about that). Overall, it was a slow service and an average ramen restaurant.

Took a long time to get the order placed, even though the place wasn't busy. \nThe ramen and roll come out, followed by the gyoza appetizers about 8 minutes later. The gyozas were obviously frozen, slapped on the grill as a stack, grilled until they developed a blackened char on one side only, then served. The appearance was questionable, but we pressed on with eating it. Never would we send food back for replacement, so we left all but the 2 pieces we tried and when the check was brought (the next time we saw our waitress after having been served!) we advised of the issue and asked that they be removed from the bill due to the inedible nature of them. They provided us with a 10% discount instead, a whopping four and a half bucks, which was only half the price of the gyozas. \n\nOverall staff wasn't friendly and it wasn't clear why they're in business - it didn't seem to be to serve good food to satisfied customers. If I were a local, if not come back. Since I'm not, I caution you to find a friendlier place with better food.", "author": "John F."}

Alright, first off, I am assuming the reviews above two stars are only written because they've confused the BISTRO with other ramen houses in the area. This is honestly the worst place I have ever eaten. Just look at my reviews! I'm a pretty damn positive person, who has obviously worked in the service industry in the past....Not  that it qualifies me in anyway, but I do have compassion! The waiting list is a joke, and totally unorganized. They are constantly short staffed- if youre gonna work in Peace Plaza (its a bit more touristy than you think) you need a better game plan. \n\nAfter finally being seated, no one even acknowledge us after 15 minutes You bet I waited patiently-even after a few tables that had been seated after we were, had their orders taken. The food arrived in a timely matter, the only positive point I get to leave. \n\nThe food was horrible. Kebabs were alright, but even my six year old can dump a bottle of teriyaki on some burnt chicken thigh. The ramen was disgusting, with sloppy mushy noodles, The cuts of chicken, in the egg soup, and \"meat\" in the pork ramen were questionable, as were tastes. I found a total of three hairs (not from my head) near my seat alone. \n\nIts a pity, the atmosphere/ambiance is so nice, I wish they would take more pride in their cooking.

We ordered a chicken ramen and a curry pork katsu ramen. The chicken in the chicken ramen was a smoky and grilled, but had no seasonings whats so ever. The noodles were a little thin, not quite springy or chewy like good ramen. broth was decent. The pork katsu was the best thing, with a  good vinegary katsu sauce. The curry was watery, and far from spiced. \n\nService: pretty much the only reason this place gets their stars.

It wasn't too long a wait for our orders to be taken, but the wait for our food was ridiculous. Without exaggeration, I believe our wait to be near an hour for our food. Another family was seated next to us about 20 minutes after we arrived, and they received their food probably 15 minutes later. Um... seriously? Well, was the wait worth it? I guess. Or maybe I was too hungry to attempt to taste my food properly. Well, the gyoza was atrocious, anyway. We had fun chatting while waiting for our food, so the first experience wasn't horrible.\n\nSecond visit.\n\nI came with a party of about 8 people. The same waitress that took our orders as last time was our waitress again this time. I was sitting near the end of the table while she was on the opposite side, about 2 people between me and her. She was waiting for my friend next to her to order, and since he was still undecided, my friend beside me asked if he could order. This b*****, WOW. She gave him a dirty look, then pointed at my friend who was UNDECIDED on what to order, then went back to staring at my friend. WHAT. Can you be anymore rude to a paying customer? \nI ordered niku udon. Okay, so at the expense of sounding conceited, I can whip up a niku udon that actually tastes good. Well, not to say this was BAD, but there was something a bit... off about it. I can't quite remember what it was, since this was several weeks ago, but I really don't want to go back to try. \n\nThey separated all the checks for us, but I should've questioned mine, since it looked like it was about $3-4 more than what I ordered, but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I really regret leaving a tip as well. I will always leave tip, even for carryout if the employee is nice, but WHY I decided to leave a tip this time was beyond me. Maybe because the lady was standing there watching me write on the receipt to see if I'd leave tip or not. Whatever, I only left her a dollar. \n\nI HIGHLY suggest to STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT.

We decided to go there, and fill our bellies with tons of meat (and some veggies too).  It was a lot of fun, we all miss the shabu shabu in Japan, but this sufficed for the time being.  We got all you can eat beef, all kinds of veggies, rice, and edamame.  Awesome.\n\nIt was pretty decent, especially for only $25 a person.  I really liked how many other little things they gave you besides the beef and basic veggies.  I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Jenna L."}

The food I order is usually pretty good (not the best I've ever had, but it's solid). \n\nI usually order the same things -- ramen (spicy or miso), katsu curry, gyoza, or hiyayakko tofu. My favorite is the hiyayakko tofu. You get four cubes of cold tofu, two with chopped tuna and tomatoes and two with shiso paste and seaweed. \n\nI don't like the miso soup (they put carrot in it and it's kind of weirdly sweet) or the seaweed salad (too slimy). \n\nI've never had to wait for a table, there are partitions so you have plenty of space, and it's a large restaurant so it's good for groups. When friends come to visit me at work (I work in Japantown), I usually bring them here for lunch or dinner.", "author": "Annie K."}

Had their lunch special for $11.25 which came with a side that was Niku Don with my Chashu Ramen. My ramen was pretty typical, the egg had no flavor but was still filling. My sister had their beef shabu for lunch for $14.95 and it was basically an udon bowl with the beef already inside, which kinda ruins the fun of shabu where you cook it yourself. The soup base was really plain and my sister wasn't happy with it. If we were to ever come back, we will try something else but the ramen and beef shabu is a no for us. Otherwise, the staff is attentive and the restaurant is very spacious with our own booths, but the food isn't anything too special.", "author": "Amanda C."}

The bowl of ramen, not sooo much... The noodles were fine but the broth was swimming in MSG. The fish pieces were broken up. The squid was over cooked and rubbery. The shrimp were chewy.

I got the tempura don with came with vegetable tempura and two shrimp tempuras. I noticed that the tempura was not crispy and was actually quite soggy when I got it. And no, it's because I was on my phone. I always fidget with my phone after food! I tried it anyway and yes, definitely not crispy and wasn't the texture I like my tempura to be but the taste wasn't bad at all. It wasn't great either. My mom got the niku soba so we traded plates after eating half and I must say, I was very dissappointed at the niku soba. The noodles were overcooked and the taste of the broth was very bland. I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you have to but that's just me being that I'm a huge Japanese foodie and my family is Japanese.

When you're walking down the hallway the restaurants don't really distinguish themselves too much. We knew we didn't want Benihana because we can get decent Japanese steak house at home. \n\nWe weren't terribly disappointed, but the food didn't have a wow factor either. I will say that the service was fast and courteous. We don't live near any kind of ethnic restaurants whatsoever, so our experience with certain types of foods is somewhat limited. We had shabu once before in NYC where we prepared our own. Our 10yo was looking forward to having it again, specifically making it. However, she was disappointed when they brought it out fully prepared. It was flavorful, but again, not particularly exciting. \n\nOverall, not a horrible decision, but not anything that leaves me thinking \"I have to get back there.\"", "author": "pathic d."}

Both items were so bland if I closed my eyes I seriously wouldn't know what I ordered. Chicken/Pork/Beef? The curry could've been oatmeal for all I know. Just too top it off at the end when our bill came, I noticed the servers added a tip percent onto my total bill. It was hand-written to the total but that annoyed me even more since we waited so long to place our order. The table next to us got served before we did but we sat down earlier.

My friends and I ordered food coming to about thirty something dollars. We expected to pay our individual checks and didn't mind very much when only one check came. But then we saw final total of $43. Allow me to explain. They charged us $5 for gratuity (which I think should've been up for the customer to decide because I don't think that we should have had to give $5 for someone to bring over my food and refill my cup once.) Now here's the thing that pisses the hell off. So the $5 tip was ADDED to the total. AND THEN COMES THE TAX. THEY TAXED THE TIP. THE HELL. WHY ARE YOU TAXING THE TIP. THAT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE. Okay, so you're a restaurant restaurant and I've been to plenty of those. NONE OF THEM TAX MY TIP. WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT. YOU ARE CHEATING ME OF MY MONEY. WHAT EVEN. I'm never coming here again.\n\nAlso, there is no bathroom in the restaurant itself. You have to exit the restaurant, take a right, and use the public bathroom around the corner.
