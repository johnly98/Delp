Lima and Miami. When I knew they also had a location in SF, I knew I had to try it, and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe started off with a mixed ceviche in spicy red pepper cream, which was great. The seafood was fresh, and the entire dish was flavorful, refreshing, and actually spicy. Then my gf had the seafood cilantro fried rice w/ onion, ceviche juice & yellow pepper sauce; this dish was excellent. I had the saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, which was also excellent. The been was tender, juicy, and the rest of the dish complimented it well. My gf's daughter had the burger w/ egg & huacatay pepper cream, which was also very good; fresh and flavorful. We also had pisco punch & chicharita cocktails, which were both tasty and refreshing. We finished with a tres leches cake, which was the perfect way to end our meal.\n\nOne thing to note, this place is pricey, but I'm sure anyone considering coming here probably knows that already. Overall, I had a great lunch here. I would recommend it to anyone lookout for great Peruvian/fusion food in the bay area.", "author": "Renzo I."}

I'll get over it...I think...), but the food, service, and ambiance was still amazing!\n\nWe started off with the Empanada Tasting Sampler, which included: Mushroom, Chicken, Beef, and Choclo (Sweet Corn) and the Nikei Cebiche, which had Tuna, Avocado, Cucumber, Daikon, Onions, and Nori. The Empanadas were delicious, flaky, and perfectly cooked (not oily like some places). It was the perfect size for 2 hungry diners. My tastebuds were incredibly happy. My husband ate ALL of the Cebiche by himself, so that should tell you about how yummy that was! \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Arroz La Mar with all kinds of melt in your mouth seafood on top of arborio rice. The flavors were balanced and the portion size was larger than I thought it would be, so it was filling. My husband ordered the Arroz Negro that came with Halibut (catch of the day) on top of a black rice stew and it was presented beautifully. I had to try it and loved it as much as my dish with its meatiness and creaminess. \n\nOn to the dessert (with no candle...), we shared the Choco Maracuya with chocolate and passion fruit mousse on top of an almond praline. This was a bit too rich and decadent for me, but I was having a YOLO moment, so it was all good.", "author": "Lori C."}

It was a 'Thank You' for our efforts, and he even allowed us to choose a nice restaurant. After much menu browsing, careful deliberating, and painful eliminations, La Mar Cebicheria was crowned winner for our restaurant of choice.\n\nThe place is absolutely gorgeous. It's the kind of place that makes me feel like I'm on vacation, even with my work laptop humming in my backpack. We were very lucky to be seated at a table with a spectacular view of the San Francisco Bay, and the waters in the golden hour was simply too beautiful. But still, we were hesitant. With so many other restaurants on the Embarcadero, how were we to be sure that we had made the best choice of a restaurant? A restaurant that we expect to be SO good that it should alleviate our PTSD of sending 2358208 emails for that one single project. \n\nIt was at this moment of indecisiveness that a musically talented crab hopped onto our table. It was assumed that this creature must be part of the restaurant staff since he was wearing a tiny name tag that read - 'Sebastian'. Sebastian tapped his pincers onto my glass of Whiskey Smash and fashioned a lovely melody. As he prepared his vocals for the song, I began to recognize that the melody sounded a bit like... like.. 'Under the Sea'.\n\n(please sing along to the tune of Under the Sea, from The Little Mermaid)\n\nThe food always look so much better\nIn some other restaurant's plate\nYou talk about going elsewhere\nBut that is a big mistake\nJust look at La Mar around you\nRight here on the Waterfront!\nSuch wonderful things on the menu\nWhat more are you craving for? \n\nUnder the seaaaa\nUnder the seaaa\nCeviches are better\nFor appetizers \nPeruvian gleeee\nThis is an adventure for your taste\nOxtail and sauce in the croquette\nFocus on eating\nIn your work meeting\nUnder the sea!\n\nThe hour here is always happy\nOur love for the sour Piscos\nTuna, Veggie, and Calamari\nAll pretty in Ceviche bowl \nThe Prawn here thinks he a lucky fellow\nBut he in for a spicier fate\nServed with Aji Amarillo \nAnd rice on the Entr\u00e9e plate! \n\nUnder the sea\nUnder the sea\nEnjoy it with beer\nCebicheria \nSeafooood is meee!\nA glass of our local Chardonnay\nSourced from here, the beautiful Bay!\nWe got no trouble\nRose and Bubbles\nUnder the sea!\n\n**Sebastian points his pincer to our view of the Bay. A band of sea creatures shot out of the waters spinning, and suspended themselves in mid-air. There were clams, crustaceans, fishes, you name it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-16", "description": "I had the gift of taking one of the most special people in my life out for her birthday, so for several months I brainstormed \"most epic dinner ever\" and booked a reservation at La Mar Cebicher\u00eda Peruana. The result?\n\nGaston Acurio's San Francisco love child gave us one of my top dining experiences ever. And La Mar will give that to you, too. \n*****\nI. FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Upon entering, you'll notice the two-story high ceilings that fill with lively leg-shuffling music and decorated with vibrant colors reflective of the colors worn by Peru's mountain peoples. Chef Acurio's \"Peru: The Cookbook\" lines the wall on the right next to the host table. Get excited.\n\nII. ROOM SETUP: After you pass the host room, where the pristine bathrooms reside, you'll see the main dining room and then the kitchen to the left. They have a patio outside, which they often reserve for private parties. They dim the lights, making it a very intimate restaurant. \n\nWe sat next to the wall directly across from the kitchen. \n\nIII. FOOD & DRINK: In traditional Peruvian fashion, they offer salads, ceviche (basically Peruvian style hamachi, sashimi), and different large seafood plates and land animal & potato/ starch entrees. What we tried:\n\n*Cebiche 4 Estaciones: As the name implies, the appetizer arrived with four different ceviches.: \n- Halibut in artichoke leche de tigre.\n- Salmon in avocado leche de tigre.\n- Tombo tuna in aji Amarillo leche de tigre.\n- Ahi tuna in rocoto leche de tigre. \n\nWhat's not to like? Fresh fish, balanced out with different acid, spice, and textures. All delicious. \n\n*Pulpo Anticucho: We received this beautifully charred and thick octopus, which the chef paired placed on top of blanched piquillo pepper, a bed of potato, garlic, olive aioli, and arugula salad. The dish sits on the heartier side, despite the octopus being incredibly soft. \n\n*Chicken Empanada: Absolutely flaky with a fantastic meat to dough ratio. I dug the sauce, but it didn't serve as a highlight of the meal. Get it if you love empanadas. Peruvian empanadas are baked and delicate and these were solid. This wasn't the best dish of the night, but the sauce on the bottom helped add creaminess to the chicken inside the empanada. \n\n*Lomo Saltado: Imagine a Japanese marinated meat with fries. It works. And so does their rendition of Lomo Saltado. I admit, I thought they overcooked the beef a bit, but the sauce brought everything together. \n\n*Tres Leches: Best course of the night. Perfectly soaked with condensed milk. It's soft and luscious with each bite. It's okay to cry. Honestly, though, I haven't eaten a better one in my life.\n\nAll dishes came out immaculately plated. I also thought that despite the higher price point -- come on, it's SF and you're on the docks -- the amount of food one receives is generous. \n\nIV. SERVICE: Daniel served us. Despite a small blip, he immediately corrected it. I also thought they did well with the timing of each course. \n\nV. PRICES: Pricey. Definitely a business or special occasion type of place. \n\nVI. OVERALL: I've traveled to SFO many times in my life, and I have to say that La Mar ranks as the best dining experience I've ever had. But more importantly, as a person unfamiliar with Peru and its culture, I immediately fell in love with the cuisine and the country. \n\nThanks, Chef Acurio, for opening up my world view.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

Though I was initially very disappointed to hear that they didn't have a table for us when we arrived for the reservation. Luckily, they had this tall table near the entrance that was open and we didn't mind having lunch there.\n\nThe food here is amazing and made up for that initial disappointment. Definitely be wary of prices though. We spent a small portion on octopus thinking that the market price of the dish wouldn't be more than $40. Boy were we wrong. \n\nEverything was so flavorful. We ordered this crab sashimi and octopus from the recommendation card and a ceviche. \n\nThe chicha morado was refreshing especially since the octopus was a little spicy but a little too sweet for my taste.\n\nI will definitely be back.", "author": "Sophia L."}

Loud, packed with people (mostly corporate dinners) and classic rock blaring through the speakers (at a Peruvian place I would prefer music to match the cuisine). It was nighttime so not much to see on the water and we couldn't sit outside because it was reserved for a private event, but that wasn't the restaurant's fault.\n\nFood: 3/5 Some things were delicious, some were a disappointment. Everything was expensive. Presentation was lovely. Here's what we ordered.\n\n- tiradito verde (salmon): this was bad. I love raw salmon and this tasted like the farm-raised lox slices you get at Safeway. Skip.\n- oxtail croquettes: SO GOOD. This was one of our favorite dishes of the whole meal. definitely order. crispy croquette exterior with tons of oxtail meat inside. pro tip: goes great with the green sauce you get with the taro chips!\n- empanadas: we got the 4 empanada tasting for $26. Wayyy overpriced. The beef was really good but the others were not worth the price. I know I shouldn't be expecting south american prices but these things were tiny. skip. \n- pork shank entree: DELICIOUS. get this. the meat falls off the bone and is melt-in-your-mouth tasty. Also goes great with that green sauce.\n- lomo saltado: we got this because it's a traditional dish. great flavors but not nearly enough beef. More potatoes than anything, so keep that in mind when you order.\n- Prawn special: I wanted to like this dish of 5 huge prawns served in a squash but it fell short. It came out cold and the prawns were undercooked and we had to send it back. Instead of making a new dish for us, they reheated the one we had already taken bites out of (which I always find to be a tacky means of resolution). When it finally came back the prawns were overcooked this time and the squash was a bit bland. Wouldn't order a special like this again.\n\nBetween the apps and the entrees, our server disappeared and forgot to take our order. We waited for over 20 minutes until we were able to flag him down. He tried to make up for it with complimentary tres leches at the end, which was dry but appreciated.\n\nDon't think I'll be back.", "author": "Priyanka C."}

Sin exagerar. \n\nI've had La Mar on my radar for some time now. My family is Peruvian and we are big fans of Gaston Acurio- the chef who, quite simply, put Peruvian cuisine on the map. We own his cookbooks, and I've eaten at two of his restaurants in Peru (Cuzco and Lima). So, to say I was thrilled to be dining at La Mar as a surprise to celebrate my birthday while in SF would be a pretty substantial understatement. Someone knew me well when they planned this. *smile*\n\nOur server, Daniel, started the meal off with outgoing friendliness and recommendations that reminded me of the service standards offered at the top restaurants in the country. At some point we got served the wrong dish and he handled it swiftly and with grace. (Apologetic even though we were not bothered by it.)\n\nDishes:\nCebiche 4 Estaciones: side by side servings of Halibut in artichoke leche de tigre; Tombo tuna in aji Amarillo leche de tigre; Salmon in avocado leche de tigre; Ahi tuna in rocoto leche de tigre. Of all of these, the two of us had different favorites. It was really based on personal preference because each one was unique in flavor profile and the seafood was as fresh as it could be.\n\nPulpo Anticucho: Anticucho is a Peruvian skewered meat, but when this came out, it surprised me as there was no skewer. Regardless, the pulpo was thick, charred, and a great consistency that you always hope for with octopus. Besides the protein, the dish included piquillo pepper beautifully blanched and placed atop small dollops of potato, garlic, and olive aioli, and an arugula salad in the middle. The pepper was so luscious and delicate that it could have been a beautiful slice of fresh fish for all I knew looking at it. The potato was not quite mashed consistency, but instead textured with a graininess that somehow made it irresistible. Not a drop was left over.\n\nChicken Empanada: Peruvian empanadas are baked and delicate and these were solid. This wasn't the best dish of the night, but the sauce on the bottom helped add creaminess to the chicken inside the empanada. \n\nLomo Saltado: Traditional Peruvian style beef tenderloin, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, soy and oyster sauce, potatoes, and rice. This is historically my favorite Peruvian dish just for the explosion of flavors. The rice was served separately and the lomo sitting on a bed of the thick-cut fires and tomato/onion deliciousness. The beef was incredibly tender-- always a quick way to tell a good lomo saltado from a cheap one. I liked the dish a lot, but would have enjoyed a bit more sauce on the plate to soak up with the fries and rice. Still, one of the best I've had.\n\nTRES LECHES: Ok guys. Dessert is not usually the highlight of my meals, and I had some pretty outrageous dishes this night that blew me away. With that being said, I am a tres leches connoisseur and this is without a doubt the best tres leches slice I've ever had. It was rich, sweet, and moist all the way through. I don't know how I didn't get a picture of it, but I'm pretty sure I was in a sugar-anticipation trance. I highly recommend this dessert to finish off a fabulous Peruvian dinner.\n\nThe location is right on the water, with seating both inside and outside (with heaters) and you can see into the kitchen. It boasts a beautiful and clean aesthetic and the servers change your cutlery with every dish. \n\nOverall, this is the type of place that will end up on my list of top restaurants I've been to.

Reservations are recommended but if you do have to wait they have a beautiful full service bar with lots of character. They have both indoor and outdoor dining areas, along with two bars and a sushi bar. We of course chose to sit outside, weather wasn't too chilly and they have ample heat lamps. Our server was very profane friendly and was happy to give you any suggestions. Unfortunately they no longer have plantain chips, but they did replace them with fresh taro chips.... which I like better lol We tried to get a second order but they sold out. Now I know to order two. I had the Dungeness crab and avocado entree served over a potato pur\u00e9e. Delicious, there was so much crab. Next we have a steak dish (I unfortunately forgot the name) that they are known for. It was delicious! Seasoned so perfectly, along with roasted vegetables. I would definitely order that again. We also had some beef skewers. Their desserts were delicious. Their tres leches is better than any of the ones I've eaten in Central America. My dessert was more like a parfait with cotton candy on top.

Sadly in the end I left very disappointed, with a large bill to match. \n\nSo I will give the restaurant kudo's for aesthetics, nice open air feel with views of the bay (Sit outback if possible), the kitchen, and plenty of natural air to keep you cool. The staff was quite nice and helpful, but missing at times when needed even when it was not particularly that busy. The menu is pretty straightforward and easy to navigate with some tasty treats on it that could entice even the little ones if you happen to bring them along. They did offer some weekday specials that looked good, but I was ready for my favorite Peruvian dish (Lomo Saltado). The dish itself was not cheap, teetering on the $40 dollar range, but you should know this due to its location and being in SF anyways. The free plantains with a green chimichurri sauce was absolutely to die for, wish I could of just eaten that the whole time to tell you the truth. Once the main dish arrived, I was a tad confused as most of the veggies look barely cooked and more so on the underside of being cooked. Not much meat to go along with it as well, so you are basically paying for a limited amount of meat and more so of the grilled/cooked veggies. The whole plate was very bland, I am no expert of course, but have had my fair share of saltado's in my lifetime. I just really expected more for what I had paid for, but honestly I cheated myself as this restaurant as it prides itself in seafood hence \"La Mar\". I think next time if I revisit, I will give the seafood a shot to see if it was an indeed a better choice. \n\nFor the time being though, I am leaving it at a two star sadly.", "author": "Ryan A."}

Food was good but the pricing was rather high for the amount that was served.

I came around 12pm on a weekday to meet with a friend. Granted we had reservations but even without, I think we wouldn't have had to wait too long as restaurant wasn't overcrowded.\n\nWe ordered the choclo empanadas ($14), crab sanguche ($19.5), and the anticucho tasting *add pulpo ($49). Between the two of us, this was definitely more than enough food but even so, the portions seemed rather small for the price point. If you value freshness of the catch though, La Mar won't disappoint! All the seafood we tried was delicious. \n\nUltimately, I'd come back for a special occasion but probably not for a quick lunch.

Btw, we traveled to Peru 4 years ago and we did not have any food as delicious as it was here.\n\nMy husband and I went on a tour of Alcatraz, and we were done by 4pm. Our dinner reservations at La Mar were at 5:30, so we went to their bar and because we were hungry we also ordered some happy hour items. We ordered the classic ceviche, and a dish that had fried calamari, fish, and plantain chips. We so regret ordering this much because we wanted EVERYTHING on the dinner menu. Oh we also had the pisco sour and the mule. They tasted great! Be careful though, the pisco sour is super strong.\n\nFor dinner, we had a table outside by the water at the perfect time - just as the color in the skies change while the sun sets. They provide plantain chips and a spicy dip that's yummy. I had the Arroz La Mar, which is like Peruvian paella, and my husband, who was still full from happy hour, only got the cause tasting. Everything was SO DELICIOUS....We CAN'T wait to come back hungry AF and order so much more. Love the ambiance here, food is flavorful, interesting, and colorful, and the service was impeccable.

Full disclosure, my wife and I absolutely love Peruvian food and are always looking to enjoy new restaurants that provide Peruvian cuisine.\n\nWhen we arrived, we had hoped to be seated outside, but that is reserved for for guests who had made reservations previously. We were promptly seated and the restaurant wasn't quite busy for a Sunday night. I did get a chance to go on the outside area and although it was pretty chilly, they have heaters to keep guests warm.\n\nWhen we were seated and provided the menu. We were eager to try the ceviche, so went with the classic and although the portion appears small, it was shared and went good with the provided chips. The chips with the green sauce was amazing! For drinks, we had the Inka cola, which is a Peruvian soda that is extremely tasteful.\n\nI am a pretty huge Lomo Saltado fan, so I had to try it and boy was in it disappointed. The steak was delicious and the mixture of the sauce and vegetables truly made it savory! My wife opted for the shrimp dish pictured, cannot remember the name, but it was extremely bland and not as rich as we would've expected. She ended up notifying the waitress and ordered the Lomo Saltado instead and she was extremely pleased.\n\nOverall, this is the most we have paid for a Peruvian restaurant, but it was worth the visit. The proportions are definitely not as plentiful, but still filling.

The restaurant has a nice bar and a lot of people hang out there for the Happy Hour. The restaurant is big with a nice view of the pier. The decoration is contemporary and I love they have Latin music in the background. \nThe menu has ceviche, appetizers, anticuchos (small plates with skewers), desserts and delicious cocktails. \nI always start with a \"pisco sour\" a Typical peruvian drink, they make it delicious! They even offer flavored pisco sours, if you like citric you should try Maracuy\u00e1 (passion fruit) pisco sour. \nSomething I really like is that they bring you plantain and potatoes chips with a special home sauce to start. Yumm!!! I'm a big fan of plantains. \n\nFor appetizers you must have empanadas!! They make delicious empanadas! My favorite are the beef empanadas yummm!! \nI also like to start with some ceviche. You can't go wrong with any ceviche in this place. The fish is so refreshing I just love it! They make it with something they call tiger milk... yummmm \n\nFor main courses, I had the lomo saltado. If you feel on the mood for steak you can't go wrong with this plate! The steak is cooked on the most delicious and flavorful sauce. It comes with tomatoes, onions and fingerling potatoes. The plate also comes with a side of white rice.  This plate is delicious. \n\nIf you want to have something smaller and save room for dessert, you can always have an anticucho. I had the pescado anticucho and OMG!!! Delicious! They grill the catch of the day fish on a skewer. Mmmmm they put a sauce on it and it tastes so good! This plate comes with fried yuca and Peruvian corn... mmmmmm you can't get any better than that! \n\nIt took me 3 years to not over eat so that I could try their \"Tres Leches\" and it was so good! It was puffy, it had some strawberries and raspberries. Yummm delicious! I personally like it more wet but it was delicious. I had a bit of the apple quinoa dessert yumm!!

Not that it is relevant, but my friend is Indian and didn't understand a single word he said.\n\n2. The restroom was so disgusting that I could not get out of there fast enough. There was a brown ring around the toilet and the floor looked like it hasn't been mopped since opening day. The toilet seat covers were in the floor!

It is very citrusy but it didn't bother me. The different textures definitely complimented each other. My second was the Arroz Norteno. The rice is very heavy but the flavor was on point. The Salmon was only okay. For the price you pay, I would expect either quantity or quality and I didn't get either.

I had the Empanada ($15), Arroz Nortena ($45), a beer ($8), a dessert ($14), and passion fruit juice ($8) -- I'm all for paying for quality but at that price I basically expect perfection. Here are the issues:\n\n- The Arroz Nortena is just paella but very mushy with overcooked veggies. If you want something like this, go one block down to Coqueta\n\n- The service was terrible. Literally the guy said he would come back and explain the menu then he comes back and urgently asks what we want to order. Meanwhile I have no clue what the 6 sections on the menu even mean. That would have been tolerable but then after dinner they literally forgot we existed. We had to call him over 3 times post-dinner and this was on a Tuesday (many empty tables and free wait staff)\n\n- For a place that has a menu full of passion fruit stuff these were not real passion fruits in use. I'm from Tanzania and know what it tastes like. If this wasn't some kind of concentrate then they're sourcing some horrible passion fruits and should just stop\n\n- The best part was the dessert but at $14-17 they're all just as overpriced as the rest of the menu\n\nIf you want Peruvian food I would say skip this place that was full of jersey shore lookalikes and head to the much more reasonable and tasty Limon Rotisserie or Mochica. If you just want to be on Embarcadero then go to Coqueta. There are too many good restaurants in this city for this place to be as highly rated as it is", "author": "Neechi M."}

Really, all of the holiday lights in all of downtown is superb but we definitely appreciated the decorations walking in. I also loved the lighting at the bar area next to the kitchen when you walk in as well. And lastly, we sat outside (plenty of heat lamps...we were actually too hot, even) and you can't beat the view of the water. Great ambiance. \n\nAppetizers we ordered: cebiche tasting, all three of the causas (limena, nikei, vegetariana) and empanada tasting. I think most of the reviews rave about the cebiche, and I second that. Ahi tuna was by far the best, although $34 is super pricey for such small portions. The causas were super interesting: essentially it's that topping (crab, tuna, or veggies) on top of potatoes (almost like a mashed potato consistency). I absolutely loved all of the colors of the plate though. I think it's a dish to try, but I wouldn't care to order it again. And lastly, the empanadas. Think of a Peruvian hot pocket! Really can't go wrong here, unless you don't like hot pockets. But the beef was my favorite. So flavorful...mmmm.\n\nFour of us ordered the arroz norteno, a fried rice dish with huuuge portion. Unfortunately, none of us loved it. I didn't care for the flavor of the rice (and I think there was just so...much...rice...), although there's quite a lot going on in this dish with how many ingredients they add. We appreciated them not skimping out on the amount of shrimp in this dish.\n\nAnd one of my favorite parts of the meal, the dessert. I would definitely recommend the choco-maracuya if you like some chocolate and something fruity in the middle. The mousse texture......oh my. I'm drooling on my keyboard. \n\nI would come back just to get full off of their appetizers and dessert. Entree-wise though....I'd have to try something different.", "author": "Cathy C."}

It definitely didn't live up to the standards I have come to expect from Peru's top celebrity chef. \n\nThe pisco sours were good, and a decent price. If that's what you're after, then this is a reasonable option. \n\nThe ceviche on the other hand, was mediocre. Good ceviche should be made upon ordering. If not, it sits in the lime juice for too long and the texture is all wrong. The ceviche we had bore all the hallmarks of ceviche that was made in advance. \n\nThe bar area itself was also poorly presented.

La Mar is a Peruvian restaurant with both small plates for sharing and entrees if you're feeling hungry.\n\nThe layout of the place offers the option to dine in their main room which is HUGE or the outside area that is covered and has heaters. Service here is attentive from the moment you walk in to check in to when they give you the check. They have their normal lunch and dinner options but be sure to as your server about the specials of the day.\n\nFor lunch we opted for: \n\n+ California Cebiche ($19) - This was probably my favorite part of the meal. I'm a huge salmon and avocado fan so each bite was delicious! It's a great starter to share since it's light and refreshing.\n\n+Limena ($16) - This was also just as delicious! This is on the smaller side of portions so a couple of egg bites to share. The bites were coated with the right amount of sauce to ensure everything was mixed together without being too creamy. The salmon caviar was a nice touch and added a kick to each bite!\n\n+ Jalea ($24) - Although the Jalea is an entree it's definitely another dish that you should share. The dish comes with a mix of fried salmon, calamari, shrimp paired with plantain chips and avocado bites. If you're taking it on by yourself I would recommend ordering something to offset the oily-ness of this one because it is all fried. \n\nOverall, La Mar is a great place to try that's central to a lot of the tourist spots near the Embarcadero.

Located off Embarcadero, the restaurant has a great atmosphere inside and out. We were fortunate to get seated in the patio where we had a great view of the bay.  It was all of our first times so the staff were extremely patient with us, they save us great recommendations on wine and food items, and the service was just outstanding.  They came around regularly to check in with us, poured more wine and water if our glasses were near empty, promptly clean out the plates, and best of all, refilled our chip bowl.\n\nThis is a perfect place for any occasion. Date, family dinner, business dinner, our casual outing with friends. It was a little difficult to understand the menu, but don't get too intimidated, good ole Yelp! saved the day. Thanks to others who posted useful pictures, I was able to find what I want.  We let our guest of honor (sister the bachelorette) pick out a very good Spanish Chard recommended by our host. \n\nWe started with the Cebiche 4 estaciones:\n     -Halibut in artichoke leche de tigre\n    -Tombo tuna in aji Amarillo leche de tigre\n    -Salmon in avocado lech de tigre\n    -Ahi tuna in rocoto leche de tigre\nSo the fish in these dishes were super fresh and tasted amazing. The different sauces just really woke up my tastebuds. Highly recommend if you are looking for flavorful, yet not too heavy or filling starter. \n\nSecond appetizer was the Fritter Tasting.\n    -This came with a selection of empanadas and yuquitas. I have no idea what a yuquitas is but it was so good creamy. This is a perfect dish to sample a little bit of each. \n\nMain dishes:\nlomo saltado, traditional Peruvian style beef tenderloin with potatoes and rice.  Small portion of rice and meat. Was a bit disappointed with the portion, however the taste made up for it. It was good but I didn't get that \"wow\" factor. \n\nArroz la mar, basically your seafood paella with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari and catch of the day. So this one blew all paellas out of the water. This was simply one of the best tasting dish I've had in a long time. There was that perfect blend of spices and the arroz was cooked to a perfect texture.\n\nSince we were celebrating my sister's bachelorette, I secretly asked our server if he was able to make a special dessert or write a message for her.  He sure delivered! He presented a very good dessert dish with a candle and the plate said \"happy bachelorette\".

I came for a business lunch and though the food was pricey, I was impressed by the quality and execution of everything we tasted.\n\nAfter we ordered, the servers brought to the table a small canister of warm plantain and potato chips with the most delicious spicy dipping sauce! For our appetizers, we shared the clasico cebiche with the catch of the day (halibut), marinated in leche de tigre and paired with red onions, Peruvian corn, and sweet potato. This ceviche wasn't particularly strong in flavor but was refreshing and nicely tart. The nikei tiradito (Japanese sashimi Peruvian style) was made of thin slices of ahi tuna, along with an Asian-inspired passion fruit and honey marinade, sesame seeds, and bean sprouts--this was definitely one of the most delicious things we got! Finally, we had the quinoa salad with burrata, a simple mixture of greens, tomatoes, and quinoa. The salad was dressed in balsamic vinegar and had a great mixture of sweet and tart flavors.\n\nWe had to wait an eternity for the main dishes to come, but I loved the hefty, savory flavors of the lomo saltado--a tender, stir-fried beef tenderloin with tomatoes, peppers, cilantro, potatoes, and rice on the side. It was seasoned with more Asian-inspired ingredients like soy and oyster sauces, which added a great umaminess to the dish. We also had the salmon la mar, a simply-prepared salmon that was still rare in the middle, served over a black lentil cake with a spicy red sauce drizzled all over. The salmon seemed almost a little bit too rare to me, but everything about the dish was delicious!\n\nAnd finally, dessert--the choco-maracuya was a passion fruit mousse layered on chocolate mousse with almond praline on the bottom--the fruity passion fruit paired so nicely with the rich chocolate. The tres leche cake was perfectly soaked through and moist with the milk mixture and was served with fresh strawberries on the side! \n\nThough pricey, La Mar's beautiful, quality dishes make this restaurant worth the visit!

Made an opentable reservation a month ago and requested patio seating overlooking window. Arrived promptly but our party wasn't seated until 1.5 hours later! We were stuck at the bar drinking and waiting. Front desk was utterly disorganized. Even after 1.5 hours, we didn't even get the table we wanted. We got an inner table in the patio. Definitely felt like this restaurant was greedy in having 3 seatings when it could only accommodate 2 seatings unless you plan on enforcing a time limit which never happened. 3 out of 4 heaters were broken so we were freezing. They offered us one blanket in return. You would think this restaurant would fix the heaters in preparation for such a busy event!\n\nLong delay between appetizer and entree. We didn't receive our entree until the midnight fireworks show happened and everyone rushed in front of our table so we had to stand to avoid being blocked. By the time it was finished, our food was cold. Food was bland like cafeteria food and service was horrific. The entire restaurant only has 2 single bathrooms which was ridiculous since the lines to use it was almost 30 minutes! Not practical at all! I was so embarrassed for our guests and horrified by this experience. I'm only adding one star because we spoke to the manager who comped one dinner and a round of drinks for us. Considering this dinner cost $140 per person, we were utterly horrified and disappointed. Our guests were visiting from Europe and this left a bad impression. To make matters worse, my husband got food poisoning that night! We will never ever return.", "author": "Sara K."}

One of those rare instances where you are so genuinely pleased with service and have literally zero complaints. \n\nFood was really really good. It's best eaten family style - order a variety of items to share with the table. We came here after a huge lunch that day, so weren't able to try nearly as much of the menu as we would have liked to. Recommend coming here with a group of at least 4 or so, so that you can taste a bunch of different items and flavors!\n\nWe shared some ceviche dishes and skewers.

The moment we went in it felt so high class. I like the interior design of the restaurant, but the restrooms are a bit small and there is a lack of privacy. The doors to the bathroom stalls can seem revealing. There is a bar close to the entrance and then the indoor space and then the outdoor space. Went there for a birthday. Sat outside close to the water. The floors and tables were clean and tidy. While it started getting cold since it was nighttime, there was a heater on the ceiling that turned on, thank goodness. Though because I was sitting at the further side of the table I was still cold a little bit. The ceviches we ordered were fresh and delightful, the flavors were amazing, some sweet others more sour. \nMy main entree was the lomo saltado. The meat was cooked perfectly and i liked the sauce. Although the fact that it came with a side of white rice  was a little bit odd to me, I usually don't have potatoes and rice together, it's an interesting combination.

Previously, we had taken a larger group of family members here for dinner on a Saturday evening - also a great meal but VERY difficult to get reservations at that time.  Monday afternoon (not surprisingly) was much easier and just as enjoyable. \n\nAll of us ordered drinks (Pisco Sour, Pisco Punch, and a \"Prickly Pear Margarita\").  And all the drinks were fairly strong (a good thing in my book) Also, the Pisco Punch was sweet, which my wife liked.  Our waiter was good at suggesting things we might liked based on what we told him we were in the mood for.\n\nNone of us was particularly hungry so my wife and sister only ordered appetizers as their respective entrees (causa limena and California cebiche w/o salmon) and I ordered an entree (lomo saltado) but with no appetizer or other dish.

While waiting for the restaurant to open for dinner at 5pm, the friends and I squeezed into the pretty packed bar area to order some drinks and appetizers. They do have a happy hour menu - every day from 3pm to 6pm. To note: the empanadas on the HH menu - you only get one per serving. To drink, I opted for a Prickly Pear Margarita. It was maybe just a little too prickly (sour) for me. \n\nOnce they opened the main dining room for dinner, we were led through the expansive restaurant to a table on their gorgeous patio on the water. Wide open glass doors/windows give a nice, bright, open feel and view of the bay, even if sitting inside. I was very impressed that EVERY waiter or worker we walked past on our way outside actually greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant! Very pleasant, and our waiter was no exception. \n\nTo eat, I tried the Chicken Empanadas. Two decent sized empanadas, stuffed with savory pulled chicken. I got the Causas Lime\u00f1a for my meal. Aesthetically pleasing, Causas are lines of lavender-colored whipped potatoes, which you can top with a choice of seafood or veggie ingredients. The Lime\u00f1a option is Dungeness crab, avocado, slices of quail egg, drizzled with a creamy aji Amarillo sauce and dotted with salmon caviar on top. There was a distinct hint of lime I thought. Interesting blend of flavors. The seafood mixture was served cold and delicious. Although it did not look like a huge meal, I was actually full before I got half way through so did not try dessert. \n\nMy only \"thing\" about the experience was that when the waiter brought us one check and we asked to have it split, he seemed to grudgingly let us know it could be done \"but he would have to go find the manager and it may take a while\". Definitely got the impression it was not something he wanted to do. So we ended up leaving it as is.

However since this is a seafood restaurant, I would stick to the seafood dishes.\n\nLastly, while the place is nice it beginning to look a bit worn and could use a spruce up and new coat of paint. This is suppose to be a high-end restaurant and they should ensure even small details are up to par. Noticed the bathroom was old, with stains on the wall and doors.

She helped explain a few things on the menu and what people usually ordered the most.  \n\nWe all ordered the La Coqueta ($13) drink which was new to the menu and probably may not stay on for very long.  It had a rosemary infused pisco, lychee puree, white vermouth, luxardo bianco, orange bitters, and an expressed orange peel.  My friends ordered their food (I don't remember all of theirs so apologies for the unlabeled pictures) and I was pretty hungry so I ordered two things: the Fritter Sampler ($29) and the Lomo Saltado ($36).\n\nAfter a few minutes, our La Coqueta drinks came out.  It was good to me and I would recommend it if it was still on the menu in the future.  Our food came out all at once and since I ordered two, there was no room for everything.  The Fritter Sampler was good because there were a few different items on the dish.  The empanadas were delicious even though they were small to me, the croquettes were good and the yuquitas were not bad.  I would recommend the Fritter Sampler if you want more than empanadas to try.\n\nThe Lomo Saltado was good if you just eat the meat with A LITTLE sauce, onions, and potatoes.  I emphasized \"a little\" because the sauce was pretty salty to me.  There were a lot of onions too so I didn't finish all of that and there wasn't enough pieces of meat.  The rice that came with it was a good balance but still way too much salty sauce.  If you can get past the salty sauce, then the meat was the best part of the dish when combined with everything else.\n\nGood place to eat and I would recommend trying it!", "author": "Daniel H."}

With all these different dishes, I'm unable to really pick a favorite. All the raw seafood was really fresh, the empanadas were flaky and savory, and every sauce had bright, bold flavors. The meal was complemented by pisco sours that really balanced the acidity of the ceviches. I also could have eaten the entire cone of plantain chips all by myself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-19", "description": "I tried La Mar Cebicher\u00eda Peruana for lunch a couple of days ago on the recommendation of a friend who praised it a lot. It is located just ahead of the ferry building marketplace. It is a pretty large place with a bar section in the front a main dining area in the center and a patio on the pier outside. The hostess asked if I had a reservation but was cool when she heard that I had none. I was offered a seat in the empty main dining area but I asked to be seated on the patio outside as most of the people were dining there. While walking to the patio the hostess tried to make small talk by asking if I was visiting from outside. I wanted to say yeah from 4 blocks away but I just smiled. Awkward!\n\nAnyway, once seated, I was provided menus, a glass of water and was started off with a bowl of fried plantains and a dip. I decided to start with a soup whose name I don't recollect and went with the short ribs for the main section. The plantains were nicely fried and were not too oily. The dip (Peruvian salsa?) was mild but you could pick up complex flavors. The only thing lacking was a pinch of salt but I understand that the clientele that they are targeting would not appreciate that. The soup was very good. Again it did not have an intense taste but you know that it is well made. The short ribs were fall off the bone tender and did not even have a hint of chewiness. Overall it was pretty good. The only comment that I have about the food is that it felt batch prepared. I mean it felt like a large quality was produced in an industrial kitchen earlier from which different portions were being served. It lacked the finesse and attention to detail that you get when each dish is individually prepared. When entrees cost about 30 bucks a pop I definitely expect that. I'm not sure if I ordered what would be considered to be Peruvian classics so I may have just got something that is not their specialty.\n\nService was attentive and I was frequently checked up on; the busser, server, section head and manager all made it a point to stop by. It was like they were over-attentive. Don't get me wrong it was not that these folks would hover over you, something that I detest, but it felt like they were trying too hard. Price wise it is like a $$$ place so you should expect that it will blow a hole in your pocket (which it did even without drinks). As already stated earlier I felt that the food was good but it lacked the attention to detail that you expect at this price range. Overall I think La Mar Cebicher\u00eda Peruana is definitely better than an A-OK but I don't think it is in the Yeah I'm a fan category yet. In the absence of a 3.5 rating, I'll be generous and round that up to a 4.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

My Arroz la Mar, however, was inedible. It had so much salt that the dish was almost caustic on my tongue. The very small bay shrimp appeared to be frozen and tasted like it. The ratio of squid tenticle clusters to shellfish was about 6 to 1, like my paella was getting the left overs that could not be sold in other dishes. Not what I expect in a $35 rice dish. Capping off our evening, my last sip of granache was a full mouthful of black sediment.  Our bill came to $200 for two, it was always expensive, and we put up with it because the food was good and ambiance was nice. With the food having slipped so far, there is little left  to make me want to dine here.", "author": "Brad S."}

I had a Japanese smash and it was perfect, not too sweet, great whiskey flavor. My coworker had a cocktail that tasted fantastic as well. \n\nAppetizers:\nceviche sampler- definitely a good one to share, better tasting than I remembered 4 years ago.\nnikei causa- ahi tuna over some sweet potato, great presentation, tasty\nlimena causa- crab and avocado over yam I believe, also great flavor and pretty presentation.\n\nI think this is where everything sort of went downhill, for a Tuesday, they were fairly busy, but our waitress took awhile to come back for our orders, so by the time we ordered our entrees, we felt the wait was extremely long. Then the entrees were lackluster.\n\narroz norteno- basically shrimp risotto almost. definitely get lots of shrimp, but the dish was one dimensional, all smushy and one flavor. Almost like a paella too...but meh.\nlomo saltado- my coworker got this and now that I read some reviews, it's very true. super salty. we all had a taste of the beef, which was like FIVE pieces and the rest were potatoes. he actually had to send it back, and they were nice to comp it. \njalea- fried seafood platter basically as well. nicely fried but you can get this anywhere. it would have been nice to get a dipping sauce or something with this dish. luckily he just asked for more of the sauce they give with the plaintains.\n\nsooooo, definitely a place to impress dates and to take out clients if you aren't in a hurry and not hungry.

It was delicious and the fish tasted very fresh. The fish is actually cut into pretty big chunks, and there were a couple of yam pieces and nuts in there too. They gave us complimentary banana chips and potato chips which are house made I believe, along with a spicy green salsa. Also had the empanada sampler which includes all four on the menu - corn, mushroom, chicken, and beef. They were all amazing and bursting with flavor. They were nice and flaky, and my personal favorite was the corn! It was a sort of mashed texture inside and surprisingly very good. And of course we had to order the lomo saltado, which was excellent as well. The beef was tender, onions perfectly cooked, and the sauce just brought the whole dish together.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-15", "description": "This was my first time trying Peruvian food, and I immediately fell in love! I ordered mostly tasting dishes because I wanted to try as much as possible. The server was really kind to us and suggested a couple specials of the night: braised beef cheeks, grilled whole halibut, and steamed mussels. \n\nThe complementary fried plantain chips were crunchy and although there was no distinctive or savory taste, the dip, which tasted similar to guacamole, provided most of the flavors. The chips served as a nice table side snack. \n\nCausa tasting (9/10)\nThe causa tasting caught my attention as soon as it was served on the table. I expected a lot of colors on the dish, and the presentation was definitely up there. I didn't try all three samples because the plate was almost empty by the time I had a chance to grab a bite. However, I enjoyed what was left for me. I tried the lime\u00f1a. The whipped potatoes were creamy and mildly sweet, which complemented well with the fresh toppings. \n\nCeviche tasting (7/10)\nI was generally not impressed with their ceviche. Although I do love their different dressings, as they did not dominate the freshness and quality of the fish, each sample was generally consistent and bland. I wouldn't be willing to finish the whole dish. \n\nSteamed mussels (8/10)\nExceptional appetizer with appetizing presentation. Each mussel was huge and the portion was filling. The mussels were well cooked as they slipped off the shell immediately when lightly tapped by a fork. The meat was also cooked well and required no effort to chew. There were two slices of toasted bread to accompany the tomato pur\u00e9e. The bread was nice and crunchy while the tomato was not too acidic and tangy. I could eat straight from the skillet and finish it clean. \n\nAnticuchos tasting, added pulpo (8.5/10) \nThe tasting came with beef, chicken, and fish. We added octopus, and I am so glad we did. I did not try the beef, but I was able to try everything else. The chicken was tender and absolutely juicy. The fish, which I can almost confidently identify as halibut, was cooked well with a faint trace of pink in the middle. I had no trouble cutting the fish chunk off the skewer with just a fork because it slid right off. The octopus, which came as just a grilled leg, was cooked and seasoned to perfection. It was not overdone to taste rubbery. The peppery seasoning provided a smokey taste after grilled. I feel like the dish would still be outstanding even without the drizzled sauce because each meat had their own distinctive freshness and flavor.\n\nLomo saltado (10/10)\nI have never had Peruvian food, so I can't compare this traditional dish to other restaurants or even local Peru food stands. But I can guarantee that this will probably be one of the best beef you can get at this price. The portion was good and had a satisfying amount of beef. Each beef piece was juicy and soaked with flavorful seasoning. I never really liked beef and would opt for seafood over beef anyday, but this dish blew me away. \n\nGrilled whole halibut (9/10)\nI loved and hated how they took the fish head off the plate. Loved because it's easier to take a good shot without the dead eyes staring at you. Hated because I love the meat around the cheeks. The meat was tender and moist and slid right off the bones. The whole fish was accompanied by a house dressed salad and wok-fried quinoa. The salad was refreshing and balanced the lightly salted fish. The quinoa reminded me of my grandma's fried rice; I loved it. \n\nFor dessert, we had choco-maracuya, el mousse de chocolate, and maiz morado. \n\nChoco-maracuya (8/10)\nI figured any dessert with passion fruit and chocolate would be wonderful as the sour compote balances the heavy chocolate. You can't really go wrong with it, as long as this two main components are present. The two layers of mousse (passion fruit and chocolate) were smooth and worked in harmony when eaten together. The passion fruit stood out more than the chocolate as it had a dense creamy flavor. The outside chocolate rim and praline added a nice contrasting texture to the mousse. As expected, the dessert was similar to most passion fruit chocolate cakes in other patisseries. \n\nEl mousse de chocolate (7/10)\nI generally avoid chocolate desserts as they tend to be too sweet for me. This dish was an exception. The chocolate mousse was mildly bittersweet. The caramelized quinoa added a nice contrasting crunch to the silky smooth mousse. However, I gave it a 7/10 because it's too sweet and heavy for me to finish the whole plate. \n\nMaiz morado (9/10) \nI loved the irish coffee ice cream. While each component on the plate shared a mild and similar flavor, the whole dessert had a powerful kick to end off the evening. \n\nThe service was great and would definitely come back again to try their empanadas.", "author": "Michelle L."}

Our more recent outing involved trying the fritter sampler which included a selection of fried apps: empanadas, croquettes and yuquitas. They ranged in flavor, oily-ness and texture, but all were grounded in authenticity and deliciousness! I tend to be traditional when it comes to my main entree and order Arroz la Mar as my entree 99.9% of the time. I love how the bed of rice is always crunchy and evenly, yet lightly fried and how the selection of veggies seems to change each time. It's topped with the freshest seafood medley and I like to believe they stand out on the nearby pier and fish it out and then place it straight onto my plate. If you like seafood, I recommend this dish! My friend is similar in routine and goes for the Lomo Saltado and each time he reacts as if he'd never tried it before. The dish stand out compared to others we've had due to the perfect balance of flavors, adding an even amount of soy and oyster sauce and countering that saltiness with garlic and tomatoes which both cut through the sodium. They tend to cook the meat slightly different so that all of the juices from the meat are preserved, allowing the juices to soak into the potatoes and rice! Cocktails are fairly average, yet fresh and pair well wish dishes!\n\nService: Always personable, hospitable and friendly staff.\n\nPrice: Be ready to pay a pretty penny or two! I love that they maintain their prices, because I truly believe Latin food is stereotyped as needing to be cheap, but La Mar's high quality, authentic and consistently delicious dishes truly deserve their price point. \n\nAmbiance: Spacious, sophisticated, yet comforting atmosphere. I recommend asking them to seat you on the patio so that you can enjoy the waterfront!\n\nOverall: If my wallet allowed, I'd be here every weekend.

With a modest door store front, La Mar hides a gorgeous interior with plentiful indoor seating as well as comfortable outdoor seating with views of the boats along the docks.  \n\nA friend who is a Peruvian food aficionado directed me to La Mar and I'm glad he did.  He lived in Peru for over a year and was the first to introduce me to Limon as well as Mi Lindo Peru.  La Mar was the perfect spot to enjoy a more upscale ambiance yet still enjoy delicious Peruvian food.  Our order:\n\nFried Plantains - complimentary at every table and served with a mildly spicy dipping sauce.  A easy hit that goes well with the drinks.\n\nBeef Empanada - $15.  Quite simply, the best empanadas I've ever had.  I've had the El Porteno ones from the Ferry Building and also tried the similar Saltena from Nuri's Donut House in Redwood City.  Neither had as great a filling as these.  The price is a bit higher, but it's well reflected in higher beef quality using sliced cuts of beef instead of cheaper ground beef.  The sauce was fantastic and the crust was perfectly crispy on the ends but flaky and soft in the middle.  We got it with the sauce to the side and I enjoyed it even more.\n\nCerviche Mixto - $19.  One of the two most popular cerviche mixes here.   Plentiful fish, calamari, and shrimp with a creamy orange sauce that went well with the crunchy onions and peanuts.  The resulting mix is more creamy than more traditional cerviche I've had, but I enjoyed it.  Generous portion.\n\nAnticucho Pulpo - $24.  The grilled octopus was a large octopus leg grilled perfectly.  The meat was tender and succulent and the accompanying mashed potatoes and red peppers complimented the octopus meat nicely.  I was expecting small baby octopus but it was nice being served a large leg that was shareable like a good steak.\n\nAnticucho Corazon - $18.  Another winner.  I saw the beef hearts and knew I had to order.  Like the octopus, these are huge beef hearts sliced in half, grilled, and then served with a delicious red sauce that has a hint of spiciness.  Very beefy, flavorful and chewy like beef heart should be.  \n\nOverall, we had a great meal at La Mar Cebicheria.  I've walked by this area a million times and never knew there was a gem of Peruvian cuisine along this area.  The food was tasty and novel and the presentation was top notch.  Are prices a bit higher than your regular Peruvian spot?  Yes, but add the waterfront views, open air building, and the high quality ingredients and I think the value is there as well.\n\nLa Mar Cebicheria Peruana accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

Went to La Mar and this place is huge, especially for SF.  The inside seating area was spacious, but the outdoor patio area where I got to enjoy lunch had a great view of the Bay.  As you'd expect on a gorgeous SF day, the outdoor patio was packed, but who's complaining?  The restaurant has a good vibe to it and the decor is very nice.  \n\nWe were greeted very warmly and seated within seconds upon arriving and I'm sure it helped that we had reservations.  The service was very good and the staff were very attentive.  Our water glasses never had a chance to get half-full, since the staff were refilling our glasses like ninja's.  Our server delivered their plantain chips with salsa, which were highly addicting to start-off our meal.\n\nAs we surveyed the menu, I'd heard about the quality Cebiche, so we opted for the Cebiche Tasting, which is three of their top Cebiche's.  The first was their Clasico, which featured Halibut, red onions, habanero, corn, sweet potatoes in their classic leche de tigre.  Next was the Mixto, which featured Salmon, shrimp and calamari in rocoto leche de tigre.  Last was their Nikei, with Ahi Tuna, red onions, Japanese cucumber, daikon, avocado, nori, in a tamarind leche  de tigre.  All the fish were very fresh and paired with the various veggies and spices, these dishes danced inside my mouth.  \n\nMy friend had been here before and knew exactly what he wanted, so he asked our server if they had the Ahi Tuna collar.  Our server went to check to make sure the chef could make the dish, since when my friend first came here, it was a special of the day,  however, it wasn't on the menu the day we came.  To my friend's delight, the chef said he could make the dish, so I was even more excited.  As the Ahi Tuna collar was delivered, my first reaction was how HUGE it was.  I was expecting something a lot smaller.  The collar was seasoned with chimichuri spices and served with a quinoa salad and some greens, but I had my sights set on that collar.  If you've never had a collar before, so much of the juicy meat is located here.  It's literally some of the best tasting meat you'll find on a fish.  No knife needed here, as the meat was amazingly tender, flavorful and oh so delicious.  I found myself eating and not wanting to stop.  However,r we weren't able to finish the entire meal, but the server packed our leftovers in a to-go container, so I could enjoy some tasty leftovers.  I had an awesome meal, great service and awesome weather.", "author": "Lon H."}

We are always on the hunt for unique cuisines and this Japanese Peruvian restaurant is right up our alley. The restaurant itself is beautiful...right on the water! It was very busy on a Friday night but we were seated right away. Our server took the time to explain the menu to us since we had no idea what we were ordering. He suggested the ceviche tasting and the trio of sashimi. I didn't think it would be enough food but we were stuffed! The fish was so incredibly fresh and the different sauces that accompanied each fish were so unique. Their famous \"leche de tigre\" sauce is amazing. I've never had anything like it! Be advised that most of the sauces are pretty spicy. For dessert, we had the hazelnut passion fruit mousse. It was sooo good!!! Not too sweet and with a tang. \n\nOverall, this place is worth the money just because the fish is so fresh. The service is a bit slow, but it is a good way to relax and enjoy the food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-23", "description": "For a number of years, La Mar had been high on my list of restaurants to try.  I really enjoy Peruvian food, so the largely high praise I had heard about La Mar, as well as their mostly positive reviews on Yelp did nothing but stoke my desire to check them out.  Of course, it didn't hurt that they're also one of my friend's favorites spots to take his dates.  Man, if only getting those dates was as easy as coming here for them...\n\nConsidering how we didn't have a reservation, as well as how packed nearby Coqueta was (on a Thursday night!), my friend and I were pretty happy we were able to get seated at the bar/counter as soon as we walked in.  True to their name (\"the sea\", in Spanish), as well as their location on the Embarcadero, the menu leans heavily towards seafood (numerous cebiches are featured).  However, they still have plenty of non-seafood Peruvian staples as well, like Lomo Saltado, empanadas, anticuchos (skewers), and paella-like dishes.\n\n-- PLANTAIN CHIPS WITH DIPS...Free!\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-mar-cebicher%C3%ADa-peruana-san-francisco-4?select=3-IbOwO4EIT37EvG1deJ5g)\nWould it be bad to say this might have been the best thing I had here?  The chips weren't dried out, yet still really crispy, and had a good amount of plantain flavor.  Plus, the dips they were served with were great!  I don't know if we were ever told what they were, but both were delicious.\n\n-- MIXTO CEBICHE - Catch of the Day, Shrimp, Calamari, and Octopus in Rocoto Leche de Tigre...$19\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-mar-cebicher%C3%ADa-peruana-san-francisco-4?select=Wh89IZtoL6upuZiwZE40iQ)\nUnfortunately, I can't recall what the catch of the day was, but the dish, as a whole, wasn't bad.  All of the seafood was pretty fresh (including whatever fish that was...) and I liked the punch that the leche de tigre (sauce) packed.  That said, for whatever reason, the sheathes on the choclo (Peruvian corn) felt especially hard.\n\n-- LOMO SALTADO - Traditional Peruvian-style Beef Tenderloin, Tomatoes, Cilantro, Garlic, Soy and Oyster Sauces, Potatoes, and Rice....$34\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-mar-cebicher%C3%ADa-peruana-san-francisco-4?select=kbY7QUERVZskaSzp1Wf4JA)\nI couldn't resist trying their take on such a classic, but I should've listened to my wallet - not worth the money!  Although the beef was well cooked, it was overwhelmed by all of the veggies, which were cut fairly large (especially the tomatoes).  What really killed the dish though was how salty it was; whoever made this was definitely a little heavy handed with the soy/salt.\n\nAlthough their food may not have impressed like how I had hoped, La Mar does get high marks for their ambiance and decor.  In that regard, I can definitely see why my friend comes here so often for his dates.  Not only is the space fairly open and airy, but the back area of the dining room offers wonderful views of the bay.  For that reason, as well as the quality of the seafood, La Mar might still be worth a visit, but it comes at a literal price.  Then again, if you're here with an awesome date, who cares?", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-14", "description": "Location and ambiance trump a lot understandably, but I was underwhelmed with the cuisine as well as service at La Mar. \n\nI came here for a friend's birthday, and we had such a large party that it was recommended we reserve a \"private room\" for everyone. Just so we're clear, the \"room\" was not \"private,\" but rather a sectioned off area that was extremely loud and cramped so that our party of twenty people barely had room to turn around in our seats. Additionally, this prior booking required a fixed menu so that the kitchen could (again understandably) prepare for such a large party. But instead of portions for each guest, single-portion dishes were served with the idea that 3-4 people would be sharing. I don't see how this decision was practical or even conceivably understandable. It's San Francisco -- I get it, but the steep amount for a private room, service fees, and then minuscule portions all added up to a woefully disappointing experience. \n\nI have to give an honorable mention (the negative kind) to the hostess at the front, who could not have been more dismissive and nonchalant when our group walked in and asked about our reservation. She responded with an \"Oh\" and general wave of her hand for us to walk towards the back before looking straight through us to the next guest. Our servers were warmer and more helpful, although they did mess up the drink orders quite a few times. The busboys, though, were impressively prompt and tactful about swiping away empty glasses and refilling water cups. It was such a small space that I was mystified at how they managed to efficiently clear away plates and neatly place new ones.\n\nThe food was unmemorable as far as I remember, and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to snap any pictures. I do remember that the empanadas were mediocre, and I thought that the dough was overly thick and the filling dry. The ceviche was also just okay and I could have used a lot more acidity, although I liked the huge kernels of Peruvian corn mixed in. The sauteed beef with vegetables was overly salty and though the beef was fresh, it was noticeably overcooked and stringy. \n\nI think the strangest dishes of the night were definitely the Korean-esque bowls of mixed ingredients cooked in hot stone pots. I suppose the goal was to simulate a bibimbap kind of dish, but the tastes were rather bizarre and dissonant. There was a vegetarian version and a meat version, and both were unpalatable. I think I may almost prefer the vegetarian version with its quinoa and arugula mixture, but that in itself just sounds unappetizing. I'm not sure if these options are on the regular menu, but I wouldn't recommend them. \n\nThe other honorable mention (this time a positive one) goes to the desserts. The different kinds of sorbets were refreshing and had a good mixture of tart and sweet, although I really wished that our servers could have let us know a description of the flavors upon serving. There was also a rich chocolate mousse that was a tad sweet for my taste, but the texture was airy and pleasingly light. My favorite was the strawberries and cream dessert with a freshly-made tuile on top. This was the perfect balance of freshness and creaminess for me, and the tuile was fragrant with that just out of the oven freshness. I could have inhaled an entire portion by myself, but of course, these were all shared between 3-4 people. \n\nThe drinks were nice in taste but light on alcohol, which wasn't really an issue since this isn't the kind of venue to drink heavily. They also followed the overall trend of small portions for high prices, even taking the location and ambiance into consideration. I just can't justify it, especially as our per-person price was well above three figures each. \n\nI'm starting to notice a trend with my opinions of seemingly highly-rated, pricey, upscale restaurants in coveted areas. It might be a while before I try another, but chances are I won't be coming back to La Mar.", "author": "Maggie X."}

It was really a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe ordered two non-alcoholic drinks, the Pina Punch and the Lychee-Nada (I preferred this one), and he ordered the Carne Anticucho and I got the Ceviche Tasting.\n\nThe Carne Antichucho was a little on the smaller side, so if you're super hungry it may be too little food, but if you're just normal to kinda hungry, it seemed to be the right amount food. I tried a piece of the beef and I thought it was perfectly chewy and very flavorful.\n\nThe Ceviche Tasting seemed like it wasn't going to be enough, as each of the ceviches were in small-ish bowls, but it was plenty. I was definitely stuffed afterwards (the plantain chips helped with that too!). I forgot to ask what the catch of the day was, but it was some kind of white fish, maybe some kind of yellowtail. It was really tasty, with some pieces of roasted corn for some crunch. The Mixto was a little spicier (or maybe it was leftover flavors from the habanero in the Clasico), and was a mix of squid, shrimp, and octopus. Nikei had ahi tuna in it, topped with onions, daikon, and cucumber, with a sauce that tasted like light soy sauce with other citrus-y flavors in it. Overall, I really enjoyed the ceviche sampler, and if you're into raw fish/poke/ceviche, I think you'd really enjoy this.\n\nI thought we would get a dessert menu, but instead, Luis brought out a slice of tres leches cake with a candle, which was extra surprising after the flutes of champagne.\n\nHonestly, I was more inclined to give La Mar four stars because the boyfriend had a little trouble picking out his meal since he wasn't feeling seafood at the moment (there are only a handful of dishes that aren't seafood based), but the treatment we were given was just so fantastic and the food was very good, that I didn't think it would be fair to dock a star. I would definitely go back, especially for happy hour, and try to sit in the (currently covered for warmth) back patio. \n\ntl;dr La Mar is a fantastic place for a celebration, happy hour, or business meal.

The table mats were full of color and the tables were spacious enough for our party of 7. \n\nTo start dinner off, we were given two buckets of plantain chips with a green sauce.

However, I did not ($34)\n- 2x lomo saltado - traditional Peruvian style beef tenderloin, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, soy and oyster sauce, potatoes, and rice.

It tasted like a dish at a Chinese restaurant, so I wasn't too amazed by the taste.

I love Peruvian food so was well acquainted with most of the classics on the menu. Our table tried a few different things including the ceviche sampler plate, the ahi tuna with whipped potato and the yucca balls for appetizers. I wasn't too crazy about the tuna and the other japanese-esque ceviche but everything else was amazing. Chicha morada tasted great as well. For main course, I tried the octopus skewer and the catch of the day (swordfish)- both were cooked perfectly and went well with the side dishes/garnishes they came with. For dessert, we had the passionfruit chocolate mousse and it was fantastic: not too chocolatey, but a good amount of rich fruity flavor.\n\nLa Mar isn't cheap but would definitely come back for a nice dinner or occasion", "author": "Alka M."}

If you haven't been to this place before, you'd immediately be impressed with the space as the ceiling is vaulted and it sits in between a couple piers. Honestly, the atmosphere is a 10. \n\nThe place is owned by world renowned chef, Gaston Acurio who has more than 18 restaurants to his name spanning all over the globe. It's impressive. Last year, I saw a documentary (Finding Gaston) at the Sonoma Film Festival and was wowed by this man's commitment to his people of Peru and the sustainable approach he takes to sourcing his food for the restaurants. Basically, he's a stud. \n\nThe meal came in multiple courses and was super colorful. Each plate reminded me of spring time (see photos), as the edible flowers were a plenty. My favorites are listed below: \n\n1. Cebiche Clasico - as it sounds. Classicly delish. \n2. Chicken Empanada - flavorful and not dry. I could crush 10 of these in a single sitting. \n3. Thai Snapper (whole) - deboned, head on, and just heavenly. \n4. Beef Cheek - braised to perfection\n5. Mousse de chocolate fortunato - the crispy quinoa made this dish. \n\nA solid 5 stars.

Located on Pier 1 1/2, the restaurant boasts a fantastic view of the bay with its thankfully closed-in and heated patio. It has a sleek and modern yet still very comfortable atmosphere. It opened seven years ago with famed Peruvian chef Gast\u00f3n Acurio at the helm and after all these years, La Mar is still packing them in for those looking for a great Happy Hour with affordable piscos, not to mention tasty bites all at affordable prices. I've been here for lunch on weekdays and weekends and it never disappoints, with its unique style of cooking you can't find anyplace else. \n\nFor those of you looking to come when it is the wait is negligible, may I suggest you come in on a weekend in January as that was clearly the slowest month of the year at La Mar, I was able to come on a Saturday afternoon with my fellow Yelper in crime Christine because she had never been to La Mar before and she's always wanted to come because she's heard such good things about the place (and she's right)! Christine smartly thought we should enjoy a dish on their main patio until we waited for Happy Hour to kick in because at La Mar it is from 3-6pm in the bar area only and it's seven days a week, which for San Francisco is truly rare especially in a tourist haven like the Embarcadero. So we wisely waited it out while we got a great view of the bay and Treasure Island.\n\nWe wanted something that truly represented the cooking of Peru, while still not filling us up too much, we went with the Chaufa Aeropurto which was pork fried rice, vegetables, mushrooms, shrimp, egg tortilla topped with a spicy garlic sauce all mixed by our server in a cast iron bowl. We both thought it tasted really good, not too much kick but mixed with a wide variety of ingredients. At 27 dollars a dish, it was the perfect meal for two to share. We thought about getting more but then we realized we planned on getting more food in the bar an hour later, thankfully La Mar provides complimentary deep fried plantain chips with the tangiest aioli (also known as their Cebicheria sauce) that I've ever had and that easily filled me over until 3pm!\n\nWhich luckily wasn't too far off, as we easily found a round table in the bar area to sit and charge our phones while we sipped and dined! La Mar is truly one of the largest restaurants in the area. So many rooms, on top of their open kitchen to enjoy their expansive menu. Here's where the real deal at La Mar can be enjoyed. So many fine cocktails from Pisco Sours to Mai Tais at only 6-8 dollars respectively! This is one of the best deals to get your drink on in the city! To drink, Christine went with the Pisco Punch which came with pisco quebranta, house-made pineapple syrup and lemon, while I went with the with Passion Daiquiri which came with white rum, passion fruit and lime juice. Both drinks were meticulously prepared and a real steal at 6 dollars. Christine love mine so much she ordered her own for later. \n\nThe Happy Hour bites menu is filled with six distinctive bites that nicely represent the cuisine of Peru from two types of ceviche, deep fried seafood, yucca fries, various empanadas and their take on a quinoa burger. After careful consideration, we knew we were going with the jaleita, also known as fried seafood, mainly because it consisted of deep fried calamari, which is a must on any menu I come across; the mixed ceviche because like the it had a nice variety of seafood and we could get a nice contrast against the jaleita; and one of their signature empanadas, this time a beef one. We loved the jaleita with its mix of fish, calamari and shrimp alongside that tasty cebicheria sauce which provided that extra kick to it. The ceviche was solid and the empanada was juicy. All three dishes presented affordable deals and was solid against the piscos and sangria we happen to be enjoying on this Saturday afternoon. We were never rushed by the servers, as it was never quite full enough in the bar area again thanks to it being January, where we didn't feel overcrowded once. \n\nThankfully La Mar is thriving on San Francisco's main drag so they can share their modern take on Peruvian cuisine with the rest of us. They truly represent the best of the wide range of ethnic backgrounds that are found throughout that country, from Asian fusion to traditional Latin American cuisine, every dish here gives Peruvian food its unique edge and makes for some of the most imaginative dishes from around the world. And it is all found right here on the shores of San Francisco Bay.", "author": "Jason F."}

In comparison, the San Francisco location was a complete disappointment. There was nothing that resembled authentic Peru at this location. In fact, I was all together disappointed with the entire experience up until I had the anticuchos (beef heart.) The seasoning on the anticuchos was authentic, delicious, and clearly Peruvian. Those were the highlight of our meal. \n\nHowever, from an American perspective, it was an elegant classy restaurant. The service was polite and welcoming. The ambiance was elegant, but a little boring. It lacked theme and direction. \n\nWe ordered a series of cebiches and seafood entrees. None of them were memorable.

We also tried their empanada tasting menu at the bar, the empanadas were done perfectly Peruvian style --i know it sounds odd to rave about empanadas but when everyone  in the area claims to make Peruvian food including empanadas and they are not even close, you lose hope! \n\nWe checked in for our reservation and decided on the tasting menu, i honestly thought i would be left hungry as usually tasting menus are small bites but we were satisfied and super happy with the choice. ALL of the dishes including the variations of comida criolla and the fusions were spectacular and with such a perfect execution of the unique Peruvian taste.

As far as I can tell, this place is authentic compared to what I had while I stayed in Peru but the prices can be steep or reasonable depending on what you get. The service is also generally very nice. Out of the 4 servers/hosts I encountered over my two visits, 3 were absolutely phenomenal and went out of the way to make us feel welcome. I was a bit disappointed they randomly told us they were not offering the restaurant week menu today (despite it being mid-restaurant week) but I was relieved I didn't order it because the prices were ridiculous and basically rivaled getting the entire meal separately.\n\nDuring my first trip I got the Jalea (didn't see this on the menu this time around) and the Causa Lime\u00f1a. The Jalea had nice light breading that wasn't too oily. The portion was substantial for the price and the quality of the seafood was above average. The fish were flaky and moist and nothing was overly chewy. Overall the flavors weren't super interesting and it was basically a big bowl of calamari, but it was still tasty. (3.5/5)\n\nThe Causa Lime\u00f1a on my first trip was AMAZING. Everything balanced so so well and getting a evenly distributed bite was heaven. It was pricy for the portion but totally worth it. Unfortunately my friend's causa lime\u00f1a today was extremely disappointing and resembled a blob of mayo dressed crab over potatoes. The textures of both dishes were great but the second time had far less flavorful potatoes and crab. It was also short on the garnishes that helped balance out the dish like the tomatoes, quail egg, and microgreens. It was still edible but overall nothing special today. (4.5/5- First)(3/5- Second)\n\nDuring my first trip my friend got the empanada sampler. I only had a bite of each so I don't remember the dish extremely well but out of the four empanadas, two were perfect, one was dry, and one was not very memorable. I think the dry one was the beef but my friend ordered it today and said it was good. Although they look small the empanadas are quite heavy and the sampler can be eaten as a meal. \n\nOn my second trip here I ordered the Tiradito Sampler. This was definitely pricy. Anyone who knows me knows I have no problem dropping money on raw fish but I'm not quite sure the quality of this fish or the taste of the sauces really justified the cost. The cuts of the fish themselves were nice: not to thick or thin. None of the fish was very fatty or flavorful though and overall they acted more like a nicely textured vehicle for the sauce. The sauce also ranged between good and meh. In general they were nicely acidic (though I prefer even more acidity) but the spices/peppers weren't very prominent. I appreciated the maiz chulpe and quinoa they added for texture and the microgreens are always a nice touch. (3.5/5)\n\nHonestly my favorite part about this place besides the atmosphere and the service are the chips. I don't own a fryer and I haven't been able to find a market that sells the chips premade (or at least good ones) but I seriously bought bags and bags of yucca/plantain/cassava/etc. chips while I was in Peru and again when in I was in Guatemala and I swear I could eat the chips here forever. The sauces they come with are also delicious! (5/5)\n\nOverall, La Mar is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to food quality but the atmosphere and service (and the chips...) are consistently great", "author": "Vivian C."}

We shared an entire octopus entree between 3 people, enough to satisfy us deliciously. The server quoted it at $69 when providing the specials, but final bill showed $79. \nMy biggest critique is for the front bar. The bar staff didn't allow me to order a drink before happy hour ended for a friend who was on her way. Their policy is not to serve more than one drink per person. I find this highly limiting and a turn off to customers. The bar wasn't very busy on Monday evening, what did it hurt to add more drinks to the tab? It is HELPING YOUR BUSINESS. \nGenerally, the food is good but this restaurant is overpriced with unnecessary limitations.", "author": "Patty V."}

The price was right on par with what we'd expect here but just the wait made it a long dining experience. A few people left simply because they had waited long enough and still hadn't gotten any food. I would recommend this place to eat just make sure you have a reservation.

The restaurant is split into many sections, more than I was able to explore on this visit, but we were seated in what seemed to be the middle section- between the bar portion at the entrance and the seaside room at the very back. I liked it, the space was very open, full of bustling tables, but not too loud. \n\nService was speedy, not very warm but very efficient. The food was delicious!!! We tried all three samples- the cebiche, causas and empanadas. I'm a fresh food fanatic so the ceviche really struck me and I enjoyed this the most. The causes were totally beautiful but a little difficult to dissect the components. The empanadas were definitely the favorite for the rest of our party and I agree that they were delicious. \n\nThe meal opened with Yucca chips and sauces that were good but a little heavy to start with. \n\nDrinks: we tried the pisco sour and maracuya sour.

We approached the bartender (Miguel M) and asked for a Pisco Sour. Right away, he told us that the best pisco sours were done at the other bar located in front of La Mar.  Obviously, Manuel didn't want to make any pisco sours for us. The issue is that we didn't like the other bar and we just wanted to have one drink. We decided to stay even though Manuel didn't welcome us. So we ordered two pisco sours. He was obviously not very happy about this and in no time he had two pisco sours in front of us. I asked him if he had used a cocktail shaker and he said no. I was very surprised to hear this because I know the best pisco sours are done in a cocktail shaker. Anyway, we didn't say anything, we had the mediocre pisco sour, paid and drove home were we made our own pisco sour. A friend who used to work at Chez Panisse in Berkeley has been telling me for the longest time that La Mar was way overrated for food and drinks. He was right, so my suggestion for anyone who want to avoid Manuel, the mediocre service and not so good food is to go to SIDEBAR in Oakland for the best pisco sours in the Bay Area and to PUCQUIO also in Oakland for a great Peruvian meal.", "author": "Hector S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "I have never loved this place for some reason. I mean, it's good, but honestly not as good as other Peruvian restaurants. Especially considering the price to food quality ratio, you're really just paying extra to dine at a nice location on the Embarcadero. A good friend of mine used to work here, and even then I preferred to fulfill my Peruvian cravings elsewhere. When I met my bf and he said La Mar was his favorite restaurant, I was like grrrreat I guess I have no choice but to get over-acquainted with this place.\n\nTheir best dishes-- the cebiches. Cebiche clasico and cebiche mixto are the two that you see at most other restaurants, and La Mar does it well. I also really like the cebiche nikei, not just because Asian fusion is sort of my thang but also because Peru is such a melting pot of different cultures and it's great to see a restaurant exemplify that. The tuna is a nice contrast to the other cebiches they offer. They recently added a couple of new cebiches to the menu, and I was able to try the cebiche power in the chef's choice sampler. I was excited to to see a cebiche feature scallops, oysters, and Dungeness crab. It was good, but nothing spectacular and sounded better on paper. Honestly though, my favorite ceviches are at Lolinda... shhhh.....\n\nBf likes to get jalea. It's fried seafood, so not my thing but gringo thinks it's good. One of my favorite dishes amongst all types of food is LOMO SALTADO. Slices of filet mignon saut\u00e9ed with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic and soy sauce on a bed of french fries. It's so simple yet so delicious... just not at La Mar. It is at most average. I am repeatedly disappointed by the dish itself as well as paying $30+ for it when you can find it better and for half that price pretty much everywhere. My favorite lomo saltado is at Limon... shhhh.....\n\nI do, however, like their happy hour because the drinks are always solid. Pisco Sours are my drink of choice and I can down them the entire 3-6pm duration. Bf gets the caipirinha, and they do a good job at those too. Plantain chips used to be a given, but these past few times we've had to ask (once we even played along that we were special and no one else could have any). The sauces with it are solid as well.\n\nOther thoughts on dishes:\n-Lime\u00f1a causa - pretty much potato salad + mayo crab\n-Corazon anticucho - good charred flavor, but a bit chewy and could be more tender\n-Pulpo - the only thing that doesn't disappoint me besides the cebiches\n-Plancha marina - very tasty but IMO not worth $36\n\nI expected a lot more from a restaurant by Gaston Acurio, the chef who's famously credited for putting Peruvian cuisine on the map. Unfortunately, La Mar is only worth stopping by for small bites and drinks. It's really not the best, though they certainly charge like they are.", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

Flavors were good but not spectacular, especially for the price you pay. \n\nFREE PLANTAIN CHIPS W/ 2 SAUCES - 5 stars. I was addicted to these! Both sauces were delicious and the chips were a great supplement for our other appetizers. \n\nCEVICHE CLASSICO - 3.5 stars. Classic ceviche dish. Many yelpers said it was their favorite of the ceviches. It was good, right amount of sour and fresh. Good appetizer, though not sure if I would order it again, especially because $20. \n\nCAUSA LIMENA - 3 stars. Dungeness crab, avocado, and potatoes. It was a very creamy and good dish, but I would've wanted a kick or some texture added to give it that \"wow\" factor. I actually used the plantain chips they provided to add it myself. \n\nCAU CAU, SEARED SCALLOPS - 3.5 stars.  The scallops were seared nicely, though I think it could've gone cooked for an additional 30 seconds (I like my scallops a little more seared). They were over Aji Amarillo, peeled wheat (rice) and potato stew with turmeric and mint. This tasted very healthy, which is supposed to be good, but if the dish is going to be $30, I want it to taste amazing, rich, bomb, etc. as an unforgettable dish. However, I have to say it was good, but not spectacular. \n\nARROZ LA MAR - 3.5 stars. I only had a bite of this, and it's the same theme throughout the dinner. Good, but not spectacular or worth the price. \n\nMARACUYA SOUR - 5 stars. Delicious! Sweeter version of Pisco sour, since it is just Pisco sour with passion fruit. Yum, I would get this drink again. Dinner price it's $12 when I believe it's only $6 for HH. \n\nATMOSPHERE/DECOR - 4.5 stars. I must say though, this restaurant is beautiful! The bar especially impressed me. The restaurant is also huge. There's a HH area, lounge, sushi bar area, dining area, and outside patio that overlooks the bridge. Great for groups! \n\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, which is good, but a great server will know how to balance providing excellent service without being overbearing.  Our server was a bit overbearing and talked too much, which kind of interferes our experience a bit. You don't want the server to take over the dining experience. \n\nOVERALL - beautiful restaurant, nice view, good food and drinks, but too pricey with overbearing service. I didn't think the price was worth the taste and quality of the food, but I guess any restaurant on the Pier would be pricey. If I were to come back, it would be preferably for HH when expectations are lower.", "author": "Raquel Y."}

He was also honest w/ his recommendations,which is hard to find since no one wants to say what's good/not very good on their menu. When it came time to our entrees being served, he took the time to explain every detail of our plates & how to enjoy it best. He never stopped smiling & making us feel welcomed. This is what makes a dining experience - 5 stars. Now on to the food..\n\nFRIED PLANTAINS - complimentary & probably the most addicting, delicious fried plantains ever, so don't overstuff yourselves on these b/c they're that good\n \nCALIFORNIA CEBICHE (wild salmon, shrimps, avocado in creamy aji amarillo leche de tigre) - fish was fresh; leche de tigre was pretty spicy, but it added a nice kick. Creamier than traditional cebiches, but delicious nonethless. Recommend getting any of the cebiches as a refreshing starter\n\nANTICUCHO PULPO (octopus grilled skewer, potato, garlic, olive aioli, & piquillo pepper) - our waiter informed us that this is a Spanish octopus, so it has a larger leg than the Asian baby legs. The spanish octopus was absolutely amazing, grilled perfectly &almost tasted like a steak. Get this, & if you don't like fish, this really doesn't taste like one as it has a meatier taste to it, so get it!\n\nEMPANADA SAMPLER (shrimp, beef, chicken, mushroom) - if you're not sure which one to get, the sampler is the way to go! The fillings in each were so tender and flavorful, and the sauces that went w/them was minimal but perfect. The crust was perfectly crispy on the ends yet soft & flaky on the inside\n\nPERNIL CROCANTE (crispy skin pork hind shank, peruvian corn pudding, adobo w/ wheat & mint salad) - i'm not a big pork eater, but this meal made me a pork lover. The skin was perfectly crisp, not overcooked as the skin can get hard and impossible to chew, but they cooked it just right. The meat was  tender & braised to perfection,& w/ the peach adobo sauce, matchmade in heaven. The sides w/ the corn pudding, wheat & mint salad was a nice balance & refresher from the saltiness of the pork\n\nEL MOUSSE DE CHOCOLATE (peruvian choco mousse, caramelized quinoa meringue & lucuma ice cream) - never had any dessert like this. The caramelized quinoa was surprisingly really good, which tasted like cocoa rice krispy. W/ the choco mousse & ice cream, it complimented each other really well. Not a heavy dessert either, so that was great\n\nOverall, awesome awesome experience. I highly recommend checking this place out! Dine out, splurge, & enjoy w/ good company.

The salmon was so memorable last time but what happened! Seems like there were less veggies and the coconut curry sauce was more of a broth - liquidy and thin. As for the skewer tastings, we substituted the beef one for an extra Mahi Mahi skewer (so 2 fish and 1 chicken). The sauce that came on the chicken skewer was delicious and I loved the charred veggies on them but the fish and chicken themselves were nothing amazing.

It is true, a proper dinner setting would have been much nicer but sometimes it's also cool to just go with the flow.\n\nThe feel of the restaurant was energetic.  People looked happy.  Our waiter was very friendly and checked on us fairly often.  I don't remember having to ask for refills on my drinks.  Our food arrived nice and fresh with very little delay.  \n\nThe complimentary bucket of chips (plantain, sweet potato and potato) came with two dipping sauces.  They got a little kick to it.  I liked the plantain the most.  The rest of our food was delicious especially the Cebiche Carretillero which was very refreshing.  This dish was small.  We wanted more.  What I liked about the Empanada Criolla was its flaky crust.  The savory filling made it a very good appetizer.\n\nWe were skeptical about ordering Anticuchos de Pulpo initially.  Because if you don't cook the octopus right, it's like chewing on rubber tires.  However, these pulpo tentacles came out so tender every bite was flavorful.  I just wish they had put more on the plate!  I also adored the Anticuchos de Pollo.  The chicken was seasoned quite nicely as were the potatoes.  The sauces were tasty, too.  Unfortunately, there was a little bit of fat in the chicken bites that should have been easily cut out during food prep.  \n\nThis dinner at La Mar ended our evening in SF pleasantly.  We will definitely come again...with a reservation next time for sure.", "author": "Allen C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-28", "description": "TLDR - Ceviche was sadly disappointing, but octopus was amazing! Not really convinced to return though. Lively atmosphere but rather expensive and super slow service.\n\nThere's nothing I love more than raw seafood. Naturally, La Mar was always on my radar whenever I was considering places to eat, and my friend and I made a weeknight reservation to finally try this place recently. Unfortunately, the popular ceviches were pretty underwhelming..\n\nThe place is very lively and energetic. Good for dinner with friends or GNO. There's table and bar seating inside as well as patio seating outside on the waterfront.\n\nService is pretty slow here. It's definitely one of those restaurants where you order a few drinks and spend a long time chatting while waiting for food. My friend and I unfortunately had plans after dinner so weren't looking for an unusually long meal. We were seated around 7 and got our order taken maybe 20 minutes later. Our first dish, the Cebiche La Mar, came out almost immediately, but our Traditos and Pulpo took much longer to prepare. The Pulpo I can understand more since it's cooked, but I would've thought the Traditos could be prepared much more quickly. The server also forgot to bring us plantain chips until I asked for them. By the time our last dish came out, it was almost 8:30, and by the time we finally got our check and card back, it was almost 9. Basically, dinner somehow took 2 full hours for 3 dishes, all of which were actually appetizers.\n\nFood, overall, fell short of my expectations. Everything looked gorgeous and colorful, but taste didn't quite match up. Most notably, their ceviches are unbelievably sour. I'm used to some acidity in ceviches from other restaurants, but theirs was to an extreme.\n\n-CEBICHE SAMPLER - 3/5\nComes with a sample of 3 ceviches. I normally loveee ceviche. Raw fish/seafood is probably one of the best things on the planet, but their ceviche was honestly rather disappointing. The seafood itself was fresh and had great texture but the sauces made the ceviches overly acidic. At some point, my taste buds became so overwhelmed I couldn't tell if it was still too acidic or if it was becoming too salty as well.\n\n     -CLASICO [catch of the day in a classic leche de tigre w/ red onion, habanero, celery, choclo, cancha and camote] - honestly not very memorable, just the average ceviche but very acidic\n\n     -MIXTO [catch of the day, calamari, octopus and shrimp in a creamy rocoto leche de tigre w/ cancha, choclo and camote] - not particularly memorable either but I remember the calamari being pretty tender\n\n     -NIKEI [tuna, red onion, Japanese cucumber, daikon, avocado, nori and sesame in a tamarind leche de tigre] - reminded me of tuna poke at first, which I liked. but then the acidity kicked in\n\n-TIRADITOS SPECIAL - 3/5\nOne of the weekly specials. Honestly, I'm not sure how (or if) this was different from the ceviches. It seemed like more or less the same thing, except that the fish was sliced thinly like Japanese sashimi instead. It came with a sample of 3 tiraditos - tuna, salmon and something else (white tuna maybe?). Again, not very memorable in taste aside from an overload of acidity. Each came in a different sauce but they all tasted like the same sourness to me. The sashimi was definitely quality though. I ended up just scraping off as much of the sauce as I could to eat the sashimi as plain as possible instead.\n\n-PULPO - 5/5\n[grilled octopus, roasted chimichurri potatoes, garlic chips, botija olive aioli, piquillo pepper] \nDefinitely the highlight dish for me, even though I came here excited about the ceviche. The dish normally comes with 3 \"skewers\", but we added a fourth to make sharing easier. It smelled amazing the moment it was brought to our table! Super flavorful and had some smokiness to it. I could've done without the aioli though; I don't like aiolis in general and I thought the octopus was delicious enough without it. Texture was pretty good. One of the pieces I had was amazingly tender but the other had more of a chew to it. My friend said her pieces were nice and tender.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure La Mar would come to mind for dining out in the future. Definitely avoiding  their ceviches and ceviche-like dishes, but the other skewers and main courses might be worth a try.", "author": "Jessie L."}

We were incredibly disappointed, especially considering the dish was nearly $40 each and we had ordered two of them! We ended up having to ration out the small pieces of steak among the 7 of us so that each person got at least 1 piece of steak. How sad is that!\n\nNone of us felt full after the meal.

I loved all the decorations and thought the food was great although expensive! The service was friendly but super busy so they rarely checked in with us and the food came really late (almost 1.5 hour wait after ordering).\n\nThe best dish for me was the chaufa aeropuerto ($27) which was pork fried rice. It had both Peruvian and Asian flavors which was unique. It's served with this big fluffy egg on top that the server mixes in. I also loved the cebiche tasting ($34). It was fun to try the different types. My favorite was the mixto which had fish, shrimps, calamari, octopus in an amazing sauce. The lime\u00f1a causa ($16) was beautifully presented. It was so colorful! I had never had purple whipped potatoes before. The crab was fresh and tasty with the creamy sauce. The lomo saltado ($36) with big chunks of savory beef, potatoes, and onions was equally good. The fritter sampler of empanadas and croquettes ($29) was just okay. It might have been partly due to the dish coming out cold. I think the server had maybe forgotten to give it to us. The pulpo octopus skewer ($28) was cooked well although a little too pricey for what you get.\n\nLastly the dessert was incredible! We all loved the passion fruit & chocolate mousse dessert ($13) and tres leche cake. It was a great way to end the meal. Overall it might have been closer to a 5 star meal for some of the menu items but service was really spotty on our visit which doesn't really justify the prices.", "author": "Linda X."}

The food was truly excellent and the service impeccable but the portions were really small and the place was so noisy it was hard to hear each other talk.  Food and service alone rated a 5 but the $$$, tiny portions and noise level brought it down.  There are better values for that type of money.  I was still pretty hungry after my meal and I am not that big of an eater either.  And it wasn't because this is a tapas (small plates) type place, I've been to other tapas places and felt full and satisfied.

This is officially my first high end Peruvian restaurant and my experience was tremendous. The menu contains dishes that are originally from the old country with fresh ingredients and classic taste. La Mar is highly known for their award winning Cebiches. They serve about seven different kinds of cebiches including a mix of three different kinds. Each one is $19 and it's portions are enough IF eaten properly and taken time. \n\nI ordered their cebiche classic which is fresh slices of cubed halibut that is literally butter texture. There is slices of red onion, habanero, cancha & camote. This cebiche is super fresh with chunks of corn and crispy corn-nuts. I scooped it with La Mar's famous plantain chips! It's excellent in every aspect. To drink I had their chica morada which is Peru's traditional purple corn juice/tea with spices of cardamom & cinnamon.

If you are a lover of Peruvian food, then you all know that for some weird ass reason they are pricier than most restaurants.  This restaurant was wayyy overpriced and know that with that price you are pretty much just paying for the service and the ambient.  \n\nThe food wasn't bad, flavors were good but if you want fancy Peruvian restaurant I recommend Mochica instead, it's cheaper compared to Lamar.\nAlso their authentic peruvian menu is a little limited. You get your usual ceviche, empanadas and causas. Most of the main courses are a not really that impressive.  I came to a Peruvian restaurant for my platos tipicos (traditional dishes) and not some whatever main courses that I can get anytime at a lot of the latin restaurants or american restaurants.\n\nWe order their ceviche classico, came with big chunks of halibut and it definitely need more marinating, flavor was lacking.\nWe also got their causa limena, which was very tasty, flavor was spot on but the presentation needs improvement.  It was made of purple potato puree with crab fillings and top with ikura (not necessary at all).  Instead of your usual lasagna like build, they squeeze the potato puree through one of the round pastry tips and the crab salad was put on top of it.  The issue with it is that the potato puree look like turd.  I don't know who came up with that presentation idea but it was a FAIL. Besides that it was delicious. (The only dish that i really liked hence the 3 stars but fail due to presentation)\nThen we had a salmon dish and a paella-ish dish, they were nothing special.  Flavors were regular nothing really stood out.\n\nWon't be coming back unless you are really desperate for Peruvian food while walking by the piers, can't get to anywhere else AND have tons of money to burn.  Otherwise save your money and just go to a better and cheaper ones in the Mission like Mi Lindo Peru, Cholo Soy, El porteno and fancier peruvian Mochica.", "author": "Suzanne L."}

Place is nice and elegant gets busy around 5pm guessing people come here after work. Never really had Peruvian food, but my girl and I decided to give it a try. Seated right away service was nice and friendly. Food is mediocre nothing crazy or over the top. Empanadas are really good though worth a try. \nI got the arroz la mar the seafood mix it was enjoyable. Everything tasted fresh and good but a little bland but overall was a safe meal to pick. My girlfriend got the conchitas picante the scallops were good but the black lentils were really spicy kind of ruined the flow of the dish. Ordered the drinks. I got a el Classico idk this was not worth it in a small glass and didn't taste overly great where I can get one better someplace else for cheaper. My girlfriend got some wine not sure which one it was ok from her standpoint.\nReason for the 3 stars is place is overly price for the quality of the food. It's good portions and sharable. \nI know it's a fancy restaurant but overly my girlfriend and I cook and we know quality when we taste it. It was subpar on our standards. But we don't mind coming back for a empanada as a Togo snack.", "author": "Leonard I."}

A beautiful restaurant that sits on the embarcadero. The interior is gorgeous, with the bright blue and dark furniture, it makes your feel like your in the islands. \n\nWe attempted to Happy Hour but it was complete chaos in the small bar section they have. And since we couldn't get a table because it was busy or people holding seats, we were a little bummed out and just gave up. So unfortunately we didn't get a chance to order anything at happy hour.  \n\n Anyways we were here for dinner. La Mar is known for their Cebiches, so we started with the *Cebiche Nikei - It's basically Ahi Tuna, avocado, garnished with onions and other Japanese veggies. What stood out the most was how fresh the tuna was. The flavor with everything mixed in was refreshing. For $25, it's a little high, but it's good.\n*Plaintain Chips - house made and complementary to to the dinner service. I wasn't expecting the chips, but they were delicious. If they were sold in a store I would buy some. Some of the best house made chips I've ever had. The sauce they bring with it was also good. Great way to start to meal especially paired with their Cebiche.\n*Arroz La Mar - A rich flavorful rice dish with a plethora of seafood like Calamari, mussels, shrimp, clams, and a small piece of fish. The dish replicates Paella so I was looking forward to this. Everything about this dish lived up to my high expectations. The flavor of the dish was rich that had many enjoyable elements. It was hot but not too spicy, you can taste the different spices used, and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The surprising but most delightful part of the dish, was the small piece of halibut on top of the rice. I think I would love to order the fish by itself next time. For $34 I think this is a steal. Great Value.\n*Power Trio - weekly special of a Dungeness crab, uni, and scallop Cebiche. My mom decided to order this one. Overall I think it was underwhelming. It was 3 small dishes and small portions. I mean really small portions. The crab came with the shell, but 3 small piece of crab meat and the sauce was decent at best. The scallops were also cooked with a different sauce, it was soft but nothing stood out flavor-wise. The best of the the three was the uni which was serve with avocado. But it wasn't that special, I just thought it was good for not being a sushi place. But for $50 bucks... It's overpriced and didn't even taste better than the tuna we ordered previously. \n\nThe service was great, our server was Pedro, and he was both helpful and attentive throughout our dinner. Overall the food was good, but it's overpriced just be prepared to spend. I really wanted to try their empanadas but those prices are outrageous. Even a sampler for $26 dollars is a little much for a pastry. One of the reason why I wanted to start at Happy hour, but still would have been $9. Not sure if I would come back to try some other things since I think their food is on par with the Michelin Star restaurant La Viga in Redwood City but not nearly as expensive. Still, the atmosphere here is great and place I would recommend especially if you can get a spot at their happy hour.", "author": "Arron E."}

For such a beautiful restaurant in a hot location, La Mar failed to execute. \n\n- service was slow, had to ask 2-3 times for the same drink \n- nobody offered coat check \n- WORST OF ALL, came home from dinner not feeling too hot. At 1am, I started vomiting and I still don't feel good five hours later. Hence I'm up writing a damn Yelp review at 6am. We had the tuna ceviche, fish ceviche, chicken & shrimp empanadas, and the lomo saltado. Not sure which was the culprit, but after reading other reviewers who also experienced food poisoning, the trend seems to be the tuna. For a cebicheria, I would expect them to be especially cognizant of the quality of fish and cleanliness of preparation. Very disappointing. Food poisoning sucks. \n\n+ awesome waterfront location \n+ the pisco punch was TASTY. The dash of nutmeg on top makes the drink not your average cocktail. \n\nBut truly, the cons outweigh the pros.

Though we did get suckered into ordering an $80 appetizer, yes EIGHTY dollars for an appetizer!\nThis was their \"Appetizer Special\" I seriously think they should mention that their \"Special\" is going to be DOUBLE or TRIPPLE the price of a regular appetizer beforehand. Or maybe it brings them joy to see the shock on their customers face when the bill arrives. \n\nSo let this be your WARNING!\n\nAll in all, I don't think I would come back.

Apparently, straightening menus was far more important to her. \n\nWhen she finally finished straightening menus, she took us to the main dining area to sit us down. We then waited another 10 minutes, for service. What the hostess had failed to mention was that happy hour only took place in the front area and not in the main dining area. The very same ceviche that was served in the front area was double the price in the main area. The waitress refused to honor the happy hour prices, and refused to transfer us over to the front area as well. We ordered a $20 salad, deciding to eat it before moving to the happy hour area to take advantage of the more reasonable prices. The salad was completely underwhelming, small, lacking in flavor, and generally just overpriced. It also took nearly 20 minutes for the salad to actually show up.\n\nWhen we finally switched over to the front area, there was actually no waitress to be found. We were told she was on break. We then ordered at the bar, then had a second wait or come over and order with us, and then the waitress return from the break and took our order the third time. When she returned she actually told us that they were out of one of the ceviche's. Out of one of the ceviche?

Often restaurants in the states will alter to fit the taste of American palates and I feel that this is what happened here. I made sure to take some of the food home and have my mom try it (who lived in Peru for the first half of her life) to see what she thought. She definitely thought it was good but wouldn't say it is true Peruvian food. \n\nAmbiance: Very cute and fun! I absolutely love the d\u00e9cor and if you read my other reviews you can see if I'm very much into the aesthetics of a restaurant. I actually feel this restaurant has a similar feel and style that you might find in a nice restaurant in the Larcomar district of Lima, Peru or the Barranco district. \n\nFood: As far as it being 100% authentic Peruvian food, no it isn't. It is more along the lines of American-Peruvian fusion but I love it all the same. We ordered a yucca dish which is a Peruvian root cooked in a more American way. Still very good and it came with my favorite sauces: Huacatay and Huancaina. I can't comment on the cebiche but my friend enjoyed it. We also ordered empanadas and I was excited they had a vegetarian one! Its hard to find a Peruvian vegetarian empanada let alone a good one.\n\nThe vegetarian empanada here at La Mar was absolutely amazing!

The ceviche \"catch of the day\" was caught some other day and wasn't fresh, in fact it was fishy. Prices were high for the ceviche, but you get a lot of it. Too much in fact, we couldn't finish two orders (classic and mixto) between two of us. There was TONS of upsell: even though the waiter must've know the huge portions, when my friend said that the ceviche was enough for his light lunch the waiter insisted it was not, so not only could he not finish the ceviche but he did not finish the main course either.\n\nThe Classic ceviche was fine but uninspiring, I've had better from Fresca, the chunks of old fish were too big to be fully marinated, thus the off taste. The mixto had too much calamari, and the stingy shrimps were not fully marinated either, and hadn't turned all-white.\n\nThe main issue I had was the waiter suggesting the pasta special, which sounded good and I ordered. It was good but too salty, crab-spice-red based, and I couldn't finish it. The waiter did not inform me beforehand how much the special cost, so I assumed it was commensurate with the other entrees.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Silly me!\n\nThe pasta was $58.\n\nFIFTY-EIGHT DOLLARS\n(in case you think the numbers were a typo)\n\nfor pasta\n\nIt was worth $28 max, and being lunchtime should've been $18-20. OK, it's downtown on the Embarcadero, nice view of bobbing boats (so what), local ambiance etc, so I'll give it the $28.\n\nFIFTY-EIGHT DOLLARS\n\nWhich I was not informed of. One would think if there is a special that is literally double the price of everything else on the menu, the waiter would say so, every other place I've ever eaten at does.\n\n(I hardly think that's good enough, the box should have a big red label Warning: Lark's Vomit!)\n\nAdd to that the 4% Healthy SF F--- You Mandate, there's no reason to eat here.

Luckily I made reservations for this place for lunch because I would have missed out on the sweeping views of the bay on such a beautiful day in San Francisco if i came at night! I highly recommend coming during the day for sweeping views of the Bay!\n\nThe food and drinks were alright. I got the Cholito, listed as \"everyone's favorite\" so I had to get it. It sounded really refreshing with Porton Pisco, ginger, jalepeno, creme de cassis, lime and topped with ginger beer. I expected it to have that spicy kick and umph but none of that was present. We started off with the Cebich La Mar for $30 which is a selection of their 4 most popular cebiches (Clasico, Mixto, Chifa, and Nikei). All 4 had unique and different flavor profiles, a very good way to sample them. My favorite was the Chifa because of its strong sesame taste, so fragrant and delicious! Get this and it does not disappoint. \n\nWe also had their brussels sprouts salad with fried kale, cauliflower and bacon strips with a side small bowl of jalepeno goat cheese. It sounds healthy right? Nope! Its super greasy, probably from the bacon fat. I still enjoyed it, especially the jalepeno goat cheese.\n\nMy main dish was one of their daily specials. It was a mahi mahi stuffed with shrimp and oysters on a bed of greens and rice. I had no idea, but this dish tasted like Asian Stir Fry! It wasn't what I was expecting, a lot of their menu items have a lot of Asian influences. \n\nOur server was professional, and the table and chairs were comfortable.

Not here.\n\nI've been here twice so far, once for Happy Hour a while ago and once for their $25 lunch for restaurant week a couple of days ago. When I was here for happy hour, we ordered a ton of food and I noticed that while the prices seemed lower than the regular menu, the portions were even smaller. After doing to math, it is actually cheaper to buy the appetizer at full price than it is to buy the smaller version during happy hour which is pretty ridiculous. This was based on the empanada dish that I was able to count the number of pieces vs price but it's probably the same for everything else.\n\nWhen I was here for restaurant week, there was a lunch special where you get an appetizer, entree and your choice of tres leche or sorbet for dessert. I ordered the chicken skewer as an appetizer, the salmon as the entree and the tres leche cake for dessert. It was one small chicken skewer which I thought was ok as an app for lunch but when the entree came my jaw dropped. It was the tiniest piece of salmon that I have seen as an entree. I'm surprised that they weren't embarrassed to serve such a pathetic entree. Just to give you an idea of size since you can't really tell by the picture, it was the equivalent to 2 McDonald's chicken nugget in terms of thickness and length. You can get samples at Costco bigger than this.\n\nNeedless to say that I left hungry and no one should have a 3 course meal for lunch and leave a restaurant hungry. Even the dessert was tiny but at least it was bigger than the salmon.\n\nAs for service, it was pretty bad as well. Our waitress was also gone and hard to find. When she came to replace our silverware after the app, she brought me a knife and no fork and by the time I realized it, I was busy chatting with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while, she was no where to be found. It took me a while to get a fork. \n\nOverall, the space is nice and the only reason they are really still in business is because of all the tourists who don't know any better.

The waiters was very attentive and were willing to help you out with what ever you needed. But, it was pricey $$$.\n\nFast forward to February 2017 it all changed! \n\nI came back with the wife and ate the \"Nikei Cebiche\" it was excellent, outstanding taste. The music was a light Salsa which made it a romantic dinner. We get the Lomo Saltado, my wife tastes the meat and the soy or oyster was too salty for her. First time I came I tasted the saltyness but my wife confirmed it. We continued eating everything was \"chill\" and then came the dessert. :-)\n\nAs we waited for dessert I noticed they changed the music. It went from a light jazz, salsa, cultural music, to hard rock that just didn't fit the setting. \n\nWe ignored it until we were fed up with listening to loud rock BAR music. \n\nLook I like the rock don't get me wrong but being PERUVIAN and coming to a PERUVIAN restaurant I would expect you to keep consistent with the music. Sure its okay to change the music for a while but keeping it on just destroyed the mood, ruining the dinner. \n\nInstead of making me want to stay in the restaurant and talk more perhaps order something else I wanted to just pay and get out. It was a real turn off. Lomo was too pricey here and the quality of service was par. \n\nIf you ever go to Portland, OR go to Andina thats real and authentic, and everything felt great and they had live Latin Music.\n\nI was going to give a 3 but just writing this review got me thinking how PISSED OFF I got when you changed the mood. Oh and PLEASE LEARN WHAT \"AJI\" is LA MAR.", "author": "Anthony Q."}

The service is impeccable. Our server, Michael, was superb. Super attentive and fun. The place filled up quick, so come early or get reservations.\n\nThere were three of us at opening and we were promptly seated outside with an amazing view is the water . The wait staff were are super friendly and were quick with a smile and a \"Hello\". After being seated, they noticed our table was a bit wobbly and they were quick with shims to remedy the problem.\n\nMichael went over our menu in detail and I'm glad he did because there a ton to choose from. The cocktails are amazing! So make sure you get one. Also, if you have the opportunity to sit outside, do it. It's a true experience and the view is amazing.\n\nWe had a sampling of the ceviche and it was absolute fantastic. Amazingly fresh and tasty. We went on to have a couple other warm dishes, that were all very good, but the ceviche was the tops.\n\nDon't turn your nose up at it if you pass by thinking its all tourists, granted there were a lot of us, but the service and food are spectacular.

We were told earliest table we could get is 9pm but when we got there at 7 just to check in we were seated really quickly. Had a nice table by the waiting area which we didn't mind as it was quieter compared to packed main dining room.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the pulpo, salmon/shrimp cebiche, a sushi appetizer, empanadas. For entrees we ordered grilled seafood, leg of lamb, pork shoulder, grilled white fish, and another fish dish. Pricey but you get a lot of food compared to other upscale restaurants in sf where portions are tiny.", "author": "p f."}

The special has a scallop appetizer - three medium size (at best) scallops for $29!  Ceviche and skewers tasting items are too expensive for what you get.  Waiter is nice, but he seems to keep pushing for high-priced items on the menu.  We also asked for a window seat, but got seated by a post in between two large windows.

The empanadas are to die for (I like the corn and my sister like the beef, but I recommend the sampler) and all of the ceviche is very fresh and delicious.

There was also a scallop dish with delicious corn kernels. Next time, we'll likely just stick with the cebiche options.\n\nWe also decided to try the empanadas. All four were great! Crispy outside and really stuffed inside. Each had a different relish/topping to complement the stuffing. The sampler came with one each of mushroom, chicken, beef, and shrimp.\n\nTo finish, we shared a dish of a Asian-inspired beef. I don't recall its name. Onions, tomato, beef, a savory soy sauce base... Came with a bowl of rice with large corn kernels. \n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, but it might make its way too us next time.

The valentines menu was a set price of $75 each for a three course meal, appetizer, main entree and dessert. \n\nFood- \nAppetizer - our first choice was cebiche I love you, but they were out of it. \nInstead we got cause de amor \"king crab meat\" and anticucho \"grilled Spanish octopus\". Crab meat was tasty with a zesty lemon flavor. The octopus tasted like well marinated rubber. Really, the marinate was delicious. Octopus, I guess is really chewy. \n\nMain entree- \nWe both got El pescadito because they were out of our first choice-the shrimp plate. \nThe dish was served in a kind of stew that tasted like coconut milky curry. Different but good. \n\nDessert- \nIce cream. Honestly I don't even remember the flavors served. I was beyond upset that everything we wanted they were out of and by dessert time, we just got whatever was left in the kitchen. \n\nAmbiance- beautiful. They had tea light candles everywhere. Really set the mood. \n\nService - \nI had to ask twice for things from our waiter and even had to stop other waiters to get what I originally asked our waiter for and he forgot. \n\nOverall, I rate La mar 3 stars. The food was tasty but the overall experience really killed the special dine out night. \nWe mentioned our concerns to the manager and he did take some things off our bill. He also promised us champagne to erase the bad memories. Which unfortunately we waited for 20 minutes after finishing our ice cream dessert and never got.

This place targeted that craving and hooked us in. \n\nThe location is great being right on the embarcadero. That can be both a good thing and bad. Good area to explore but the parking... Yikes. Plus you have to pay on weekends now. So no reprieve there. There's bar area prior to entering the main restaurant. The host is cozied up along the side in the hall. Kind of confusing because it wasn't set up like a typical host booth. We got checked in just fine though. \n\nThe restaurant itself looks great. The color scheme had a sure beach color scheme going. Blues and whites and dark table settings. Modern styling. After ordering they provide fried potatoes, like thick potato chips, instead of bread. It comes with garlic aoili of course. We ordered the lomo saltado and the octopus. Both were very good and full of flavor. Portions are generous. Lomo saltado was plenty. My wife couldn't finish it on her own. Thick cuts of beef, tender, and full of flavor. The octopus, the tentacle to be exact, was thick and flavorful. Came with garnishes of potato stacked and decorated for appeal.

Appetizer portions are small so beware the price to quantity ratio. \nLastly, service was inconsistent. One bartender was friendly and the others either never acknowledge you or not very approachable.\nIn summary, NO GO!", "author": "David H."}

She gave me a heads up that while delicious, it would also be somewhat pricey. She was correct on both counts. \n\nThere was a lot on the menu to choose from, but we were seated at the bar so we took in pretty casually. Just ordering as we felt like it. The night started with two different kinds of ceviches- I ordered the classic and thought it was pretty good. Fishy, sour, and decent amount. My friend ordered another ceviche (I'm not sure which) and that was good too. We kept the orders up with some of the other dishes, including skewers. Pretty good!\n\nWe saw the bartender constantly pouring pisco sours for thirsty patrons and I can tell you that people have the right idea here. Those piscos were pretty good and went well with the food. The damage at the end was around $50 but well worth it.

I visited this restaurant with my family for Mother's Day and we were expecting to have a nice family dinner. We arrived at the restaurant and were sat in about 15 minutes. For arriving without a reservation and having 7 people in our party, this wasn't bad. The experience took a turn after we took our seats. Our waiter took about 20 minutes to greet us and when he finally did he said he'd give us time to browse the menu and decide on drinks and entrees. Another 20 minutes go by and he finally takes our order. About 45 minutes later he comes back and tells us that two of our orders can't be completed because \"they're out of salmon\". I came for the ceviche and unfortunately I never got to try it. I was shocked that it took the waiter this long to tell me my order couldn't be completed. I asked for a menu to decide on another item and had to wait another 10 min for his return, I actually ordered through another waiter who was in our area. I ordered the Mar y Monta\u00f1a. After waiting nearly 2 hours for our food to arrive I was greeted by a ridiculously baron plate. I had two laughable sizes of swordfish in my plate, no zucchini (which was included with the entree) and the fried egg which I specifically said I did not want. Thank goodness I'm not allergic to eggs or that'd be another hour of waiting. They also forgot one of our party members' ceviche, which quite frankly wasn't even worth the extra 15 minute wait, and we all basically ended up eating at different times. All in all the small portion of swordfish I did have was delicious I cannot lie, but the service was abysmal to say the least. I won't be returning here again and I advise you to stay away if you prefer a decent dining experience. One of the guests at our table left after the waiter came back and said his order of salmon could also not be completed. Apparently there's a good burger joint around the corner, you might want to give that a shot. You'll probably get better service at a fraction of the cost. \n\n**OVERALL: \nCeviche - Abysmal. Severely lacked lemon or any flavor, covered in onions and literally served with about 6 mediocre squared slices of fish. \n\nMar Y Monta\u00f1a - Two of the thinnest, and smallest slices of swordfish ever served, although the flavor was great. Claimed to have zucchini but it wasn't served with it, and the potato was ok. \n\nEmpanadas - Beef and Chicken. Awful. Let's just leave it at that. \n\nAnticuchos - Tried the chicken, steak and fish. They were honestly just ok. \n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE! WAY OVERPRICED AND FLAVORLESS.", "author": "Baby D."}

Some of the food was a 5 but majority of the meal was a 3. The service was a 4. The atmosphere was a 4. The cleanliness of the bathrooms was a 2. So it was a little bit all over the board. \n\nOur experiment started off great. We loved the atmosphere. From the decor to the setting to the location. It was great. My only complaint was that the chairs were uncomfortable. But I loved their color pallet. It was very fresh and clean feeling. That was until you got to the restrooms. It was toward the end of the night but the restrooms were pretty gross. There was rolls of toilet paper all over the floor. Their was a strange mildew odor on top of a port-a-potty smell. There were leaks of water on the ground. It was not well kept. \n\nAnyway, the food was more of a roller coaster. Some highs and some lows. I will say this, you could tell the exceptional quality of the products. All the ingredients were fresh and very high end. \n\nWe stared with a tuna dish (I forget what it's called). It was served on top of potatoes. It had some spicy sauce on the side. It was delicious. A 10 out of 5. It sort of reminded me of sushi flavors. We also ordered the cebiche mixto. Maybe it was simply the wrong choice (they offered like 7 different type of cebiche) but it was very bland. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor to the fish. The fish was very good quality. The calamari were soft and not chewy at all. But there just wasn't any real flavor. \n\nThe drinks were great. My moms drink was on the sweet/fruit side but really good. It was served in a chilled glass with flower peddles. I ordered the pisco punch. It had a great flavor. It was mixed nicely. I wasn't fond of the nutmeg but that was just personal preference. \n\nBased on many yelp recommendations we tried the empanadas Sampler. The shells were cooked very well. The dough must be made from scratch. It was cooked so well. Nice and crispy.  The filling however was just \"off\". We like a bold flavor to our food. We like a little spice but all the empanadas seemed to lack seasoning. We also tried a steak fish that was just ok.  \n\nI would definitely go back for the tuna fish and drinks. I would also give another cebiche a chance.", "author": "Jordan M."}

The happy hour has changed and so I am reviewing their new menu on this post.\n\nHappy hour is 3-6 pm. \n\nDrinks: if you want something authentic try a pisco sour. It is sour, very strong and has egg white foam (completely safe to eat). After 2 piscos you will certainly feel it. Cusquenas are the traditional beers in Peru. For $3 during happy hour, it's worth the try. The wine selection is okay...but seriously people don't come to La Mar for wine.\n\nHappy hour menu: my favorite ceviche is the ceviche Classico. It's fish and calamari and some habanero. The ceviche mixto (yellow) comes with the same thing as the Classico but they add shrimp. This one has no spice to it. I order both and then see which one deserves a second order. \n\nThe chips and plantains are no longer free during happy hour but for $4 it's worth the snack. They come with two delicious aji sauces. \n\nStill on the menu were the empanadas- beef, chicken or shrimp. We ordered one chicken. It was about 5 inches long and 4 inches wide for $6. I would rather order more ceviche. For us it wasn't worth it...I remember when they cost $3. \n\nNew on the menu is a pork (carnitas) taco. It's gluten free (lettuce wrap) and every bite was so delicious! The pork was tender and marinated with a sweet and sour sauce. Absolutely delicious! \n\nAlso new was a calamari dish topped with avocado. Doesn't come with a sauce and the batter was too salty. For $9 it certainly wasn't worth it. \n\nConclusion: the new menu is very small but has the old items that are always good and some new ones to try.

I read in another review that someone's husband got food poisoning while dining there on NYE and another source shared with me they also got sick after eating there on NYE. I've eaten here multiple times. The food had been good in the past and the ambiance beautiful, but the side effects were painful. I held a meeting in San Francisco and the only people who came down with the same violent symptoms at the same time were the four of us who ate at La Mar. I don't like to complain, but this is a health hazard. I want others to be aware of the possibility of getting sick. The dishes all four of us ate were the ceviche tasting and the paella.

If you've never tried Peruvian food or drinks the first thing that might come to your mind when you here \"Peru\" is probably Machu Picchu or Lamas, but I guarantee you that's going to change after you visit La Mar, especially if you try their Pisco Sour (All bets are off if you have more than three of these delicious cocktails since you will be likely to forget your address!). Any how, if you are visiting for the first time, try to order as many small plates as you can so that you get to sample a wider range of tastes. Order a couple Cebiches or Empanadas (the sampler is a good option). The salads are great (try anything with quinoa in it!). If after trying a few small plates you still have room (very unlikely scenario!), try any of the fish dishes for main course. For dessert ask for the specials. There is always something good on the menu for the day, but do not underestimate the quality of their coffee! I am not sure where they get the beans from, but it smells and tastes awesome!\n\nThe service is excellent. Every single time I have visited, I have received great service. The servers are always very knowledgeable and helpful if you need to know more about the items on the menu.\n\nAnd the view! If you make a reservation and it is a nice day, you probably want to sit in the back porch where you have a nice view of the bay. Gaston Acurio has aced this one!", "author": "Afshin A."}

Old Fashioneds were also served on the menu, and they're good, but if you've never tried a Pisco Sour, then definitely get that. It's Pisco (peruvian brandy), ice, lime juice, simple syrup, bitters, and beaten egg whites.

I'm sure there might be less expensive places to try, but because I was celebrating my birthday, I really wanted to come here. Also, I had given up eating any kind of red meat, (for Lent) so eating here would be no problem with the countless seafood dishes!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nCebiche mixto: \nSooo flavorful. Every bite was fantastic!\n\nCausa Nikei:\nI've never had a dish like this and I was not sure what to expect. As soon as I \"dived\" in with my spoon (didn't know how to eat it!) and tasted it, I was sooo happy. Everything about it was delicious. Even the tiny bits of nori made it so much tastier. \n\nAntichuco Pulpo:\nNever been someone to eat octopus. After eating this, I wanted to learn how to make it. (Of course it's never the same when you try to copy a restaurant dish.) The octopus so sooo tender and it had that grilled taste that I can never replicate. Delicious!! And served with whipped potatoes and those cute \"corn nuts\". \n\nAs for my main dish, I asked for some suggestions from our server and I probably should've went with my original choice. (Which my hubby ended up getting. Wouldn't wanna get the same dish as him anyway.) I got the Salmon Fusion aside from the salmon being cooked perfectly (with nice, crunchy edges) I thought it was just a \"basic\" thai-tasting dish. Meh. \nMy hubby's dish was a 10/10! Plancha De Mariscos!! Definitely a seafood lover's dream!!  The portion size did not disappoint! Large pieces of octopus!! \n\nAs for service, I hate to say it, it wasn't that great. Service was extremely slow that night. Our drinks came pretty late- into our second dish. Also, we were sitting there so long that I think an employee thought we just got there because he ended up giving us a 2nd helping of plantains. Fine by me. I loved all the dipping sauces. \n\nDepending in where u're sitting, you might as well be having conversations with your neighbors. I felt like we were super close to them.

Whenever anyone asked me for happy hour suggestions, La Mar was one of the first ones I spit out. But not anymore, and it truly breaks my heart to say that. I have so many great happy hour memories at La Mar. I'm sad that it won't be my go-to spot any longer. \n\nI came on a Saturday at about 3:30 PM with my husband about 5 weeks ago (a little late updating this review) and sat down to the only 2 empty seats at the bar. The spot we sat at was dirty, still uncleaned from the previous customers. Empty glasses, crumpled cocktail napkins and wetness. Not a huge deal- bars get busy. But after sitting there for 10 minutes and not being acknowledged, and not having the mess cleaned up, it was a little annoying. I grabbed a happy hour menu from the lady next to me only to see that the prices have really gone up on their happy hour. The little cebiches that used to be $6 are now $9. The pisco sours price went up as well. The causa limena, my favorite item on the HH menu was no longer there, nor was the chicharr\u00f3n de pollo, another one of my faves. It appeared that the HH menu got smaller and the prices got bigger. Irritated about the new, sad HH menu, I realized we had now sat at the dirty bar for 15 minutes still without acknowledgment. I should mention that the bartenders and bar backs weren't too busy. The bar was full but the staff seemed to be focused on doing the duties that typically take place before a bar opens or when no one is ordering anything, in addition to chatting with the servers at the pick up window. I had become well acquainted over the years with a few of the bartenders at La Mar and didn't see one of them. Maybe they all left for better pastures...\nI was pretty mad about my wonderland shitting on me, so I told my husband that I wasn't dealing with it, and we got up and left, still without even a look from the bar staff. I haven't been treated that shitty ANYWHERE in a really long time. I was simultaneously sad and angry. Despite this review, I actually plan on going back to La Mar for happy hour one more time, to see if maybe, MAYBE, I came on a day when the entire bar staff was new, and someone accidentally printed up a small overpriced menu. Because if you check their website, the causa limena and chicharr\u00f3n de pollo are still on the HH menu.

Unfortunately, the chicken and beef versions were okay in comparison - the chicken was dry and the sauce with the beef wasn't my favorite.  I also ate those after the octopus, so that could have been a significant source of bias. \n\nI also tried the chicha morada, a traditional purple corn drink.  It is essentially a juice with an interesting aftertaste; I liked it.  My date ordered a steak with grilled vegetable dish, the lomo saltado if I'm not mistaken.

The fish stare at you from displays, everything \"looks fresh\" and delicious....  But then you look around at the guests....these people do not look Peruvian (well, they look like folks on Peruvian tv). I  ordered razor clams out of nostalgia for my father who grew up eating them on a tiny island in Maine. I asked for a \"tiradito,\" which is a kind of cebiche in yellow causa sauce. They said they could only fry them in butter. Bad sign.  They did not say: these are frozen and cannot work in cebiche.  We ordered a basic cebiche de pescado.  It had that horrible ingredient that destroys your appendix by tenderizing it:  ajinomoto, or monosodium glutimate.  Cebiche only is delicious if the fish is exceptionally fresh.  We mistakenly ordered a jalea.  This is fish that has been breaded and deep fried.  It is where the fish goes that is the least fresh.  AVOID it like the plague.  Puerto Norte or la Choza Nautica--where the Peruvians eat cebiche--are MUCH BETTER. \n In the end nothing was fresh.  And we paid through the nose.  And we continued to pay all night long as we became sick from eating fish that was not fresh.", "author": "Loo L."}

The waitstaff was fantastic and very knowledgeable--he was able to give us some great suggestions. \n\nWe started with the Mixto Ceviche (yellowtail, calamari and shrimp), Causa Lime\u00f1a (whipped potato towers with dungeness crab and quail egg), and the Tiradito Passion (salmon sashimi with aji amarillo passion fruit). All of the appetizers were amazing . The ceviche and tiraditos were some of the best I've ever tasted--so fresh and so many different flavors and textures that all came together perfectly.\n\nFor my main course, I chose the Salmon La Mar, at our waiter's recommendation (I couldn't decide between that and the Pasta Criollo until he said the Salmon La Mar was his personal favorite dish). This dish was salmon, shrimp, broccoli, bok choi, cauliflower, mushrooms, peruvian red chiles, and coconut milk. It was SO GOOD I can't even describe the full deliciousness of this dish. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavors were out of this world. I can see why it was our waiter's favorite! Definitely one of the best seafood dishes I have ever eaten and like nothing I'd ever eaten before.\n\nAs if we hadn't already eaten enough amazing food, we just had to try some dessert. We chose the Choco-Maracuya (layered passion fruit mousse, raspberry compote, chocolate mousse, and almond praline). It was the perfect dessert, not overly sweet but very satisfying. The passion fruit mousse really added something to it that made it not your typical chocolate dessert. \n\nObviously, don't come here if you are looking for a cheap meal. This isn't a place we could eat at all the time, but its great for special occasions or that nice meal everyone once in a while. I hear they have a good Happy Hour which I would love to check out one day for some smaller, lower-priced bites.\n\nIf you are considering eating at La Mar, DO IT! You won't be disappointed :)", "author": "Erica M."}

To top it off, I also ordered an Inca cola, a kind of banana flavored soda. \n\nI was not surprised that most of the dishes featured potato and corn, staples of Peruvian cuisine. The corn kernels were very large, about the size of a nickel, and seemed to be imported (I have never seen them in the Bay Area before). They start you off with a mix of house made potato and banana chips with two dipping sauces, which were very rich. The causas were spectacular; the acidity was well-balanced with the creaminess of the crab and avocado. The cebiche was my favorite dish -- the onions and citrus complimenting the halibut tartar. The empanadas were crispy, but not outstanding compared to the previous two dishes. The carne was reverse-seared and was very tender.\n\nThis place had a great ambience featuring light blue accents and a view of the SF bay right from the embarcadero.

We had two kinds of causas, the cebiche clasico, anticucho de carne, salmon tiradito, lomo saltado and the halibut. With the exception of the salmon tiradito which was just about average and the lomo saltado which I found a tad on the small side given the price, the food tasted wonderful. All the flavors came together nicely and were exactly what I'd expect. I've eaten at some very fine Peruvian restaurants both in the states and in Peru and I can safely say that a few of La Mar's dishes ranked up there with the best.\n\nWith that said, the rest of the dining experience was a total miss in my book. In the bar which sits adjacent to the dining area, there was an extraordinarily loud party of sorts going on with a mariachi band and dancing. This would have been fine had there been a door between the bar and the restaurant, but there wasn't. I found myself having to yell to communicate with other people sitting at my table. Totally unacceptable and unprofessional in my book.\n\nSecond, the bathrooms. There are only two small ones near the entrance and they were absolutely repulsive. Also frankly quite unacceptable both in terms of size and cleanliness.\n\nThird, the wait staff. While the waiters and waitresses were all pleasant enough, nobody came to check in with us as to how the food was during the meal. On top of this, I would expect a bit more professionalism (opening doors for the ladies, letting guests walk through crowded areas first) from a wait staff at a restaurant that purports to be a fine dining establishment.\n\nI'd like to say I'd be coming back, but the experience didn't feel like it was worth the amount of money it costs to eat there.", "author": "Dev B."}

When I knew that I would be in San Francisco on business I made it an absolute must to come here. I'm a huge fan of Gaston Acurio and his cuisine. Being from South Florida my wife and I frequent the La Mar in Miami. \n\nWalking in I was surprised with how big the restaurant actually was. The one back home is small. The hostess was friendly and got us checked in quickly.\n\nWhile walking to the table I couldn't help but notice how nicely decorated the restaurant was. The restaurant was also very open which I like.\n\nThe menu is a good size with tons of options.\n\nRoberto our server came by quickly to take our drink order. After he took the drink order his service began to get super slow. I actually felt like I was back in Lima again lol.\n\nYucca chips and sweet potato chips along with two dipping sauces were brought to the table. One of the sauces was huanciana and I can't remember what the other one was. Back home we just get the yucca chips and the huanciana sauce. I always devour them as you can't eat just one. Everyone at the table enjoyed them and couldn't stop eating them.\n \n\nRoberto returned about 10 minutes later with the drinks. He went over a long list of specials and made recommendations. We ordered the empanadas de aji de gallina and the ensalada limena for the table to start with. For entrees two people had the Lomo Saltado and one had the Arroz La Mar.\n\nThe empanadas were awesome. They were lightly fried so they were chewy which I like. The sauce was good, however, I didn't find it to be spicy at all. Man the empanadas just melted in your mouth. \n\nThe ensalada limena was good. The produce was super fresh. The vinaigrette had such a great flavor to it.\n\nOne of my colleagues and I both needed another drink. Roberto didn't come back by until we finished the salad and the empanadas. He didn't even offer us another drink we had to ask him for one.\n\nThe drinks were delivered by someone else this time and was done so quickly. \n\nAs soon as the entrees were placed down on the table everyone got real quiet all of a sudden. The presentations were nice on the Lomo Saltados. The Arroz La Mar's presentation was beautiful though.\n\nMy Lomo Saltado was extremely bland and pretty much flavorless. I was disappointed with it.\n\nMy colleague loved her Lomo Saltado. I'm happier that hers was better than mine as it was her first experience with La Mar and Peruvian food.\n\nMy father absolutely loved the Arroz La Mar. He said that it was probably in the top 3 things that he had ever eaten. My father has been a foodie for a long time so that definitely means something.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Pineapple Coconut ice cream. All I can say is that it was awesome. Each flavor just came together so well. There was also something at the bottom of the cup that was like a happy ending lol. I have absolutely no idea what it was but it was a great way to end the dessert. \n\nAt the conclusion of our meal I had to flag Roberto down to request the check. It took a while for him to come back for the payment after he had dropped it off. In all honesty the service flow that he provided got to me. When I go out I want to enjoy myself and not be rushed, however, I certainly don't appreciate when the service is way too slow. This knocked a star off of my review. I deducted a half star for my entree being bland. I rounded up because the rest of the food was great. \n\nI found the prices to be very reasonable. We were out the door for under $100.00 a person\n\nI will definitely come back here on my next trip to San Francisco. I just hope that the service will be better. Based on my visit here I definitely prefer Diego Oka's cooking at the La Mar in Miami more. Sorry I couldn't resist throwing that in there!!!!\n\nI suggest that you stop by and try it for yourself.", "author": "Will G."}

You can usually tell the sign of a bad server when he or she immediately try to up sell you on everything. Straight to the most expensive ceviche sampler for $69. Then the two most expensive entrees each at $36 and $49. Unfortunately on this trip I fell for the up sell with the Plancha Marina dish with Prawns, calamari, catch of the day, seasonal vegetables, aji panca\rand lime for $36.

You have to pay 5 bucks for them during HH though.\n\nHappy Hour is the BEST + trumped both my meal experiences. We biked from Sausalito and were in dire need of a drink (or many) before hopping back on the train. Drinks are 6-7 and ceviche is 8 during HH, 3-6pm (every day!)\nWe tried the pisco punch, sangria, bourbon buzz, blue mule, and pisco sour. My favorite was the bourbon buzz but they're all very tasty and STRONG to boot! \nMy girl ordered the Cebiche Clasico and Chalaco and ate every last morsel of food from their endearing fish-decorated bowls.\n\nI wish they'd improve the restaurant week menu to include some of La Mar's popular items. Although getting a salad, entree, and dessert for $25 during lunch + $40 dinner is a good value, it doesn't make much sense if the food is not memorable. Some of the dishes from the normal menu are delicious but definitely overpriced. You're also paying for the sleek, spacious location on a beautiful waterfront.\n\nThat being said they do have amazing cebiche and happy hour, so that's what I'll be back for ;D", "author": "Jenny Q."}

Your food is completely imbalanced.  I ordered the salmon dish with avocado crema. Sent back.  Balance the goddamn citrus please.  I had instantaneous heartburn from the acidity.   It was replaced with some ahi tuna with taro or orange yuca or some starch nightmare. I ate the tuna (because well I was hungry)...the rest.  Well gross.\n \nHad some absurdly overpriced chef special main dish - apparently it's so good that they had to call it out as a specialty. Some river white fish. Such high expectations. They served it with a lime based broth horrific tasteless quinoa.  Inedible.  I had 2 bites and they had them take it away.  I paid nearly $60 for food that they told me was elevated street food.  And I ate 5 bites total. Food from the streets - albeit in Jamaica, MX, India or China - is known to be affordable. Of course in SF it was about 50x more than it should have been.  And not worth it. At. All. \n\nI ask you chef.  How would the street vendors in Peru feel about your 'elevated' food?  Insulted I'll say. You need to go back there and reflect on the true ways because your food is not reflective of the love, the passion the people and the knowledge of the sea or land...of family and of the indigenous culture. It celebrates nothing...not the air, the mountains...the diversity, nothing. \n\nAnd (I truly laugh out loud) when I ask about your 'elevated' prices.  Honestly, this food taste and price is nothing reflective of Peru. There is no \"taking it to the next level\".  Matsuhisa in LA kicks your fucking ass - and their ingredients deserve the price elevation...and they are ****!!!\n\nI was so upset and disappointed.  It actually hurts my feelings what happened tonight.  My takeaway: retrench.  Go back and learn your roots.  And reflect upon what \"elevate\" really means when it comes to the food of a great country. \n\nMy Best,\nS.M.", "author": "S M."}

Got to taste a variety of dishes and everything we had was delicious. I've been to the La Mar in Miami and this one seems to put more of a fusion twist on some of their dishes (probably because that's how SF is). I love Peruvian food and ever since I moved back from Miami, I haven't been able to find many good Peruvian restaurants in the Bay so I was happy to discover that the La Mar here is just as good as the one in Miami. \n\nThe purple potato causa was amazing and was my favorite out of the 3 appetizers (also had a ceviche and a tiradito). Out of all the dishes I tried here, I actually liked the ceviche the least (that just shows how good everything else is). I was surprised to find out that at this location they have nigiris, but instead of using wasabi, they use Peruvian sauces and seasoning instead. No joke, they melt in your mouth. We also got a grilled octopus that was out of this world. It was extremely tender and perfectly cooked. It was a little on the salty side but the potatoes on the plate helped. We finished off with a maracuya mousse which was light and fluffy and a great choice if you like fruit and chocolate. Even though the portions are on the smaller side, I was full by the end of the meal but didn't feel weighed down or sluggish at all (because the food is so light and fresh!).\n\nThe service was amazing and every server took the time to explain each dish including how it was cooked and what ingredients went into making it.

It's understandable because it's very close to the financial district where coworkers like to unwind with a glass of cold beer (can't blame them). I myself preferred the sangria and to my surprise it was very fruity, which I liked very much. I'm not much of a seasoned drinker, so I tend to prefer alcoholic beverages with minimal alcoholic taste. But what impressed me more was definitely the service. I have to say that the service was nonstop and I felt like it was better than some five star restaurants that I've been to. The waiter was new, but it seemed like he knew what he was doing and he was very good at it.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered calamari, ceviche, croquettes and a slider (patty made with quinoa). The best was the ceviche but it wasn't the best ceviche I've had. It's moderately tasty at best. The calamari tasted like most calamaris I've tasted but nothing special. The slider was $6, which I think was overpriced for the size. It was not that great so I'm glad we didn't get 2. Finally, the croquettes were not good at all (in my opinion). We didn't even finish it because it just tasted like potato dipped in tempura batter. There was no taste and it tasted overwhelmingly like potato. I didn't like how unhealthy I felt afterward. The final bill was $40 which was okay but I expected better from the food.\n\nAside from the service, the atmosphere was not that great either. The DJ played blaringly loud music right behind us. And there were way too many people for the space-- it felt like we were past maximum capacity and if there was a fire, we would all be screwed.

There was also the cebiche clasico, fresh fish soaked in a classic leche de tigre with red onion, habanero, celery, cilantro, chocio, and camote. Both appetizers were served on the same place and had tiny portion sizes.

The beef was mouth watering, the chicken was surprisingly flavorful, the mushroom had an overpowering taste, and the corn was just okay. \n\nThe entree was the concohos marineras, steamed mussels and clams in some delicious broth that came with a side of rice.

I went for lunch during restaurant week, and had a three course lunch for $25 without drinks, tax and tip. In the end, I spent closer to $45 because the service was great and I wanted a drink. \n\nI had an excellent meal in a drop dead gorgeous venue with attentive, informative and charming service. The general manager even stopped by to make sure we were happy. \n\nThe restaurant is right on the water and has an open air patio (protected from the wind/rain) in the back. It was a pretty chilly day, so we sat inside. There are heat lamps though, if you're more adventurous than we were and really want a view. Everything  is swanky/modern inside. The bar was backlit blue glass, the chairs were right out of Design Within Reach.....you get the idea. Nice.\n\nAnd the food. Wow the food. For my first course I had ceviche and it was delicious as well as beautifully presented. There was a lot of lime, a little habanero, red onions, and fresh fresh fresh fish, giant Peruvian nutty corn (both toasted and not) and cilantro.  It was a perfect start.\n\nNext, Lomo Saltado. It was a generous portion and paired with both rice  and potatoes. It was the sauce that really made this dish-it was similar to a demi-glace. Delicious and a great thing to get when you go out because it's too much work to make at home.\n\nDessert? There was a choice of either Tres Leches or housemade sorbet. I had the sorbet, but the cake looked great too. There were two sorbet flavors- mango/passionfruit and a purple Peruvian corn. I liked the purple corn one best. I ate all of the mango/passionfruit, but it was actually a little sour for me. The purple corn had a nice balance between sweet and sour and actually tasted like a fruit...just a fruit I had never tried before.\n\nRestaurant week is such a good thing!   I will definitely come back here for a special occasion meal knowing that I'll be paying much more. But it will be worth it. \n\nWhat a wonderful place!", "author": "El B."}

We shared the Ceviche Sampler which came with three different ones. The portions were a good size and nice for sharing. We then shared the Empanadas Sampler of one each of Shrimp, Mushroom, Chicken and Beef. We split those and I'd say it's good for three evenly cut pieces. The Chicken and Shrimp ones were the best of the four. The Beef one had raisins and to my surprise, it wasn't too sweet. For the main entree, we split the skewers platter of Chicken, Beef and their daily Fish. We added on the Grilled Octupus. There were single skewers but the pieces were enough to share but I think just for three people and the Octopus came add three portions so it was the perfect amount. Our server recommended the Octopus and it was delicious. The service was attentive though almost too much so. We were chatting, drinking and nibbling while the bussers came by a few times to try and take our plates away. They were friendly so it was fine but I really thought they should have paid attention to the fact that were still eating as one of us was always chewing or picking off the shared plates. The restroom situation is always a bummer with the single restrooms but at least we can go to the clean public restrooms outside that have plenty of available stalls. I will be back soon since the sun will be out later these days and you can enjoy the outdoor covered patio well into the evening. The Happy Hour and bar area looks like fun too.", "author": "Jen L."}

To me it felt kind of snug and packed, but it was on Valentine's day and the pier was booming.  When we arrived I had no idea that it was a Peruvian establishment until I seen the pisco sour drink a customer had ordered.  Then it all hit me, based off of the signs and drinks they had on hand I was extremely surprised that this type of bar existed in the location that we were in.  \n\nI feel as if the bar tender man was too busy to pay more attention to us, so I won't bash him however I didn't get a very personable feeling at this bar, it was more of like \"what do you want\" they made it, and on with the next type of feeling.  That's fine and all, however if it were more personable I feel as if this could have been a super special place.  They should build more rapport and know their surroundings to make suggestions to tourist like myself.  \n\nOther than that I give La Mar 4 stars and would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area that can appreciate specialty drinks.", "author": "Vaughn K."}

The plantain chips that come out as a starter are tasty and I enjoyed the dipping sauces. Next, my friend and I decided to try out various empanadas. They were decent, but my crazy aunt makes better ones and I didn't have to pay her an outrageous price for them. Next came a trio of ceviches. Again, they were good, but not great. Same with the causas. Same with the pisco sour. The seafood pasta was slightly better, but again it didn't wow me and at this price point, I want to be wowed.

The original rsvp was set for 8:45 pm but arrived early by 10 mins & was told to wait and ended up getting seated around 9pm. We were seated quickly & served these delicious plantains with 2 great sauces. We were very hungry so they were eaten quickly at our table. We all ordered our main dishes & one of my friends and I shared two empanadas. They charged $13 for 2 small thumb sized chicken & beef contained pastries. The main dish I ordered was a cheesy scallop & shrimp pasta for a whipping $30!! They have high prices for not such a great quality or amount of food. Service was okay, my personal opinion is that they could work on their service as our busser. Every 5 mins they would come around and pick up empty plates but yet were so slow to refill our water glasses. They were more in a rush to clean our dishes than serving us & making sure we were doing well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-01", "description": "There are so many wonderful restaurants along the pier.  La Mar is definitely one that stood out to me the most.  Perhaps it's the hues of blue, the beautiful d\u00e9cor, or the palm fronds that whisk me away to a subtropical paradise every time I step in.  Seated just a short distance from the Ferry Building, La Mar boasts bold flavors, a beautiful open space, delicious drinks, and excellent service.\n\nThe front portion of the restaurant is the bar where they have a great happy hour menu from 3-6pm everyday.  Drinks are $6 and appetizers range from $3-6.   \n\nHere's the best part:  PISCO SOURS!!!\n\nYou can easily spend hours sipping way (or pounding away) $6 pisco sours.  They are light, refreshing, and oh so addicting.  Try the passion fruit pisco sour too!  \n\nOther notable drinks: Prickly Pear Margarita and the Cucumber Gimlet.\n\nI love that the space is very accommodating to large groups.  We had a party of 6 and we were seated very comfortably in our booth.  Our waitress was attentive and very friendly.  She always made sure to check up on us without being overbearing.      \n\nThe food here is definitely a form of artwork.  Every plate that came out was artfully displayed with purpose and reason.  The Causa Tasting is highly recommended.  It's essentially whipped potatoes infused with flavor and topped with various seafood.  The Tasting comes with four small portions, each unique in taste and flavor.  It's a great way to get a small sample of each.  \n\nOf course, this review wouldn't be complete without a review of the cebiches.  If you are a fan of cebiche, I would highly recommend the Cebiche Tasting.  It's everything you expect from fresh and delicious cebiche plus the beautiful presentation.  It's pleasing to the eyes and to your taste buds.. no complaints there!\n\nFor my main entr\u00e9e, I got the Chorillana.  It is the catch of the day, which was seabass for us, with red onions, tomato, cilantro and mashed yucca in an aj\u00ed panca and tamarind sauce.  The flavors here were just perfect.  The fish was very fresh and the tamarind sauce added a nice kick to the overall dish.  \n\nOverall, the portions are quite small but surprisingly filling.  I would recommend making reservations before you go, especially on a Friday or Saturday.  If there's a wait, don't fret.  Just mosey on over to the bar and enjoy a pisco sour or two.  It will definitely quench your appetite as you prepare for a delightful Peruvian dining experience.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

I have a particular weakness for fusion food which is probably in my DNA. I was pleasantly surprised by the Asian influences in these South American dishes making a tasty and beautiful union.  The little place that opened my palate was Astrid y Gaston which was recommended to me by my boss, a Peruvian native.  This was a gastronomical BREAKTHROUGH experience for me! Everyone knows I've never been a huge sea food fan and I figured hey if I don't like it in Lima I won't like it anywhere....what an EYE and TASTE BUD opener! The three hour 15 course Tasting Menu with Wine Pairing rocked my LIFE VIEW on sea food!  I've been missing out on this ALL MY LIFE!?!?  Ok so my point here? Well I came to La Mar because it is the little SISTER restaurant to AyG.  Reservations recommended or try hitting the bar, we lucked out getting a table by a no show.  This place is classy beautiful at night with the lights on the water, almost enchanting.  Started with the ceviche sampler: Clasico: halibut in citrus marinade, red onion, habanero. Mixto: yellowtail, calamari, shrimp in yellow pepper citrus marinade with cilantro, red onion, habanero.  Nikei: tuna, red onion, Japanese Cucumber, daikon, avocado, nori, and sesame in a tamarind citrus marinade.  Chifa: yellowtail, peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots and daikon, habanero, wonton strips and cilantro in a sweet and sour sesame oil.  All were fresh and flavorful with quality fish.  This sampler is like a ceviche journey going from South America to Asia.  The Nikei being my favorite of the four.  Also tried the Empanadas sampler: chicken, beef, mushroom... Meh... Sorry not sorry, for such a traditional dish I was expecting more, I've had better, wouldn't recommend these.  But the barrel smoked octopus (pulpo) is another story!  You cannot leave this restaurant or Peru without trying this dish!  If you've never had octopus don't worry I was VERY skeptical too!  Live a little!! You MUST MUST TRY!! The octopus is flavorfully delicious and surprisingly TENDER!!  Also tried the causa tasting: lime\u00f1a, pulpo olivo, nikei, and vegetariana.  These reminded me very much of AyG on a lesser scale.  Enjoyed these all except the veggie which was less inspirational.  This place was an excellent experience overall and certainly is a nod to big sister in Lima.

The food was not as good as what I had had last time. The shrimp was tough and the fish was dry. One of the shrimp was just the head and legs with no body; is that on purpose.  The plate generally seemed overcooked.  They need to do better.", "author": "M. P."}

The place was bustling, busy and fun, but not overly loud or chaotic. Our server was very pleasant, attentive and efficient, even though it was obvious it was a really busy night for him. Food wise, we ordered a sampler of all the emapanadas, ceviche and tartare, as well as several main courses.  Standouts were the paella (each bite had some sort of delicious seafood in it, thick and hearty) and the lomo saltado (beef was perfectly cooked and seasoned, such a great flavor). Everything actually, was delicious!  The only criticism I had was that the cocktails I tried were syrupy sweet, which did not go with any of the food.\nFun place for a group of friends!", "author": "Kari L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "Review is based on service. In short - SKIP THIS PLACE. Especially if you get the bad draw and have SHANE as your server. This place could CARE LESS about you, your money, or your dining experience. \n\nThe one star is for the service, or lack there of, we received from Shane on the evening of 8/10/14. What a disappointment and at times infuriating. \n\nWe had an event at Exploratorium and came here for dinner after that. My fiance came here a few years ago and was excited to bring me during our visit to SF. The food was delicious, good drinks and wine list, but our server Shane was terrible and tainted the experience. \n\nI'm calling the restaurant directly to outline each and every incompetent action and not taking the time to write it all out here. Trust me, there were at least a dozen negative points involved. A few notables:\n\n- our table was not completely set when we sat down. It took until the first dishes arrived to notice that I was missing a fork and knife. we called our server and pointed this out. he looks right at me, doesn't even blink or apologize and ASKS me \"would you like some silverware?\" Um, YES!!! are you kidding me?? All this while our food is sitting at the table and I have to wait for him to DO HIS JOB so I can eat properly. At a RESTAURANT. \n\n- he did at least take time to ask us how we wanted our courses brought out BUT ONLY TO MESS IT ALL UP. Huge pet peeve, especially when we're mixing cold & hot dishes as well as ordering appropriate wines to pair. Throughout all this, not even an acknowledgement or apology as to how much of a nightmare this was turning out to be. What a joke. \n\n- we ask for the dessert menu and he brings it to the table. We decide what we're going to order and I get up to head to the ladies room. I come back thinking my fiance has ordered already but he tells me that he hasn't even seen our waiter. Hmm, what a surprise. So we wait. And we wait. And WE WAIT. nothing. I'm so fed up by this point that I sit up and wander around to look for our waiter and ask for our check. Without question, he brings the check to the table. I ask him, \"didn't you know that we were ordering dessert?\" And he responds - \"YES\" Then asks, at that point, would you like to order dessert? WTF!!! I say NO because we've been waiting for so long and just want the check now. His response: \"the check is right there.\" Again, no acknowledgement. no apology. nothing. OMG. Unbelievable...\n\nIt was clear that we were seated at the end of the night and the restaurant was closed by the time we left. Even if this had something to do with the disastrous service, why even sit us at a table? Just tell us that you're closed!  And it's not about the missing silverware, the food mishaps, or whether or not this guy actually forgot about us. Things happen. I can understand that. But when you're blatantly treating your patrons with a complete lack of respect: you have a problem.\n\nSkip this place if you're looking for a nice, enjoyable dinner. Not worth the chance of having to experience lame service from someone so careless. There are PLENTY of other worthwhile places in San Francisco that value their clientele. Shane's level of indifference is a clear indication that service and respect are not valued at this establishment.", "author": "Puny P."}

The Plancha Marina (Prawns, octopus, calamari, salmon, portobello mushrooms, aji panca, and pisco sauce) and the Ceviches were so good we had to order more. Everything was spectacular! If I have one minor complaint food wise I would cut the fish in the ceviches a a little smaller... just a personal preference... the flavors and freshness were spot on. \n\nI'm sad to say that the whole story doesn't end well. The service was spotty at best. Our server who said he had been there 3 years knew nothing of the beer selection. The draft beer was served in a plastic cup! At this level of dining THAT is unacceptable.  We continually had to ask the bus staff for things because our waiter was a rare sight. The worst thing was management's decision to cater to the super bowl crowd. They're \"usual specials\"... (I know that's an oxy moron... but the specials are painted on the wall!) were not available! No grilled octopus for me! They were replaced with a foolish \"Super Bowl\" menu featuring burgers and crap! That is some bad thinking.

The veggies are cooked just right - not overcooked and not too crisp.  The sauce, oh my THE SAUCE!

I was really hungry and decided to take a hike to find a dinner spot and happened upon La Mar with no knowledge of this place. \n\nWalking in, I was surprised at the size of the restaurant. Since, I had no reservation, I was given the \"snooty look\" hostesses are trained to give and asked to wait a few minutes. She came back and asked if I'd sit in the bar, and I declined holding out for a table. This was a lucky, but brilliant move, as the tables are quieter and the restaurant is really nice. \n\nI started with the Cebiche called \"Cebiche Carretillero\" which is chopped catch of the day- Yellow tail, octopus, calamari, shrimp, choclo, cancha, camote, celery, habanero, and cilantro in a classic leche de tigre. Excellent choice and a fairly large serving. Next, I had an Empandada called Empanadas De Lomo Saltado (Peruvian's favorite dish)  which is an empanada with beef, red onion and tomato in soy-oyster reduction, served with panchita sauce. This is an excellent preparation. \n\nI wasn't going to be able to do an entree after starting \"Big\", so I opted for an Anticucho called Pulpo, which is grilled octopus with anticuchera sauce, herbed mashed potatoes, crispy choclo, Peruvian botija olive aioli, finished with chalaca chimichurri.\n\nThis was the best item I had as the octopus was wonderful and the preparation was wonderful. \n\nThis will be a great spot to bring others as I will not attempt another solo feast.

Anticuchos were rubbery and not cooked consistently all the way thru and smothered in a red pepper based sauce.  Would have been much better with aj\u00ed.

Came here for lunch for Valentine's Day and sat on the patio outside. The restaurant is huge and on a nice day it's great to enjoy the fresh air!\n\nAsked the waiter if one of the drinks on the menu was sweet and that I didn't like sweet drinks. He said it was refreshing and that I will like it. Thank god I didn't get it, because my mom got it, and it was awfully sweet. Very strange recommendation.\n\nWe got the sampler- Cebiche la Mar and the Tiradito Passion. Then we ordered the catch of the day skewer(anticuchos). Just a warning this place is very carb heavy. Pretty much everything is made out of potatoes, so if you'd like something light, besides the ceviche, you can pretty much forget it! The ceviche was fresh and really tasty. It's a great way to try all of them. The salmon melted in your mouth. The catch of the day was one pleasant surprise and it came with small fried potatoes and Peruvian corn.\n\nAfter I ordered another Cosmo, I ordered a grilled octopus(pulpo) as our last dish. Waited. Finished the drink and my mom got another drink. Finished that one too. No food. Then the waiter comes with the check and I asked him what happened to our food? He had this blank look on his face like he had no idea. He then said sorry and gave us the check. Awful service. We just sat there waiting for our food for 30 minutes when it was never coming!

It was so good I actually left trying to figure out how I could come back tomorrow.\n\nI came based on the recommendation of a colleague and based on how good this was, will be trying all the restaurants she recommended.  Overall, great ingredients, very complex flavors, beautiful presentation and fantastic service.\n\nWe started with the causa limena, a peruvian potato appetizer topped with crab meat.  Hard to describe but very highly recommended, very complex flavors and not like anything I have tried before.\n\nMy friend and I shared two entrees (and our great waitress pushed us to share), the anitchuco mixto (mixed skewers) and lomo saltado.  The skewers (mahi-mahi, chicken and tenderloin) were the surprise hit.  Chicken was very tasty and tender, steak melted in my mouth and the mahi was so good I did not realize it was fish until I was finished.  The lomo saltado was also quite nice, again the beef was melt in your mouth and the sauce very tasty.\n\nOne side benefit is I remember when you really should not eat in the Embarcadero, it was full tourist traps of over-priced mediocre restaurants.  Places like La Mar are a very welcome change, you can get a great meal while still enjoying the views and location.", "author": "Lloyd M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-03", "description": "tl;dr - Peruvian food with slight Asian influence that's priced at a premium for the view of the SF Bay and ceviche spelled with a b. Try the scallops/octopus/calamari -- some of the most tender I've tried! The Alfajor and Maracuya were surprisingly good desserts. \n\nI had made dinner reservations for 5:30pm on a weekday specifically so we could get in on their happy hour deals. Unfortunately, happy hour food/drinks couldn't be brought into the dining room. You save about 50% on the drinks during happy hour, and I thought it was unnecessarily UPTIGHT of them to not allow us to bring drinks from the bar into the dining room. I've also never heard of happy hour deals not being allowed in the sit-down dining area. \n\nAnyway, on to the dining experience. I really liked the patio setting that had an atrium-like feel looking out over the Bay. When we first sat down, the heaters were going full blast, so it felt like it was really summer in Peru. However, as our meal went on, they turned off the heaters for some reason, and we definitely felt the CHILLY SF bay breeze. The menus were really big in comparison to the size of the tables, so careful not to knock anything over. When the patio area got crowded (around 6:30pm), the noise levels became really LOUD, making it hard to hear across the table.\n\nAs many reviewers have mentioned, the CHIPS and sauces to start were very much appreciated. There were three types of chips -- yucca (looked like vegetarian bacon), sweet potato, and potato chips. There were two sauces, one had a spicier taste and the other a creamier taste.. The flavors were not quite like anything I had tasted before. \n \nOn to the food/drinks. It seemed like several of the dishes had an Asian influence actually, so the food wasn't as authentic Peruvian as I had hoped. I think Lim\u00f3n over in the Mission area has more authentic Peruvian without the Asian influence (and at a lower cost). \n\n:: Pisco sour - seemed like this was the popular drink of the night. Refreshing drink that's great to start. It has a bit of a sweet and sour taste that reminded me of the Japanese Umeboshi plum. \n:: Cebiche sampler - If cebiche is in the name of the restaurant, you know you gotta try the cebiche. Especially if it's spelled with a 'b' instead of a 'v'. That must make it more authentic....right? Anyway, the cl\u00e1sico was my favorite. PERUVIAN CORN FTW! It's like corn nuts on crack...very flavorful. Loved the tender calamari in the cebiche mixto. There was also the cebiche nikei with sesame oil and nori seaweed that was very Japanese and cebiche chifa with peanuts, soy sauce, and picked carrots that was very Chinese. I would've preferred to try more traditional Peruvian cebiches. Come on...I can handle it! Don't tone down the dish by making it Asian fusion. \n:: Pulpo (octopus) - wins \"best presentation\" for the night. Came with potato chips, a olive aioli, and decorative dressings.\n:: Scallops on bed of red quinoa - scallops were cooked to perfection; slightly browned on the outside and tender on the inside. Like the touch of toasted quinoa sprinkled on the scallops.\n:: Causa lime\u00f1a - the dungeness crab was minced into very small pieces, so I couldn't really fully appreciate the flavors of the crab. It was quite light compared to the yellow potato it was served in top of. \n:: S\u00e1lmon Ayacuchano (D.A.T. menu only) - grilled to a nice crispness on the outside.\n:: Lomo Saltado - a very safe dish that you can't really go wrong with. Lots of starchy potatoes and rice though. Not sure if it was worth the price that they charged.\n:: Choco-maracuya - great dessert to end on! Loved the flavors of passion fruit, chocolate, raspberry, and almond praline/granola combined.\n:: Alfajor (D.A.T. menu only) - shortbread cookie filled with dulce de leche \nand drizzled with a dark chocolate syrup. This shortbread was the BEST I've ever tasted. All shortbread should be like this. Flaky and melt in your mouth!! So fresh and light, yet somewhat buttery. How?!\n\n\nWhew, a two hour meal later -- THE END. Congrats if you've read to this point!", "author": "Audrey L."}

The Dine About Town Menu included Causa Nikei, Cebiche Limeno, Arroz Norteno, and Seasonal Sorbets. We had made reservations in advance and were seated outside on the patio, which overlooked the bay. It was a really nice and warm day in San Francisco. \n\nPotato, Sweet Potato, and Plantain Chips - Complimentary. Very crispy and tasted just the way they were. Loved the sauces to dip in it. One sauce was creamier, while the other was spicier. ALSO, I loved their presentation of the chips. It looked like a bouquet! :)\n\nCausa Nikei - Tuna tartare and avocado puree on top of rocoto potato with creamy huancaina sauce, finished with nori. The potato part was quite interesting as you eat it with the tuna. The creamy sauce had a small kick to it to bump up its flavors. I really liked the tuna tartare. It tasted really fresh and was not chewy. \n\nCebiche Limeno - Not too acidy, just the way I like it. Fish tasted very fresh and was very refreshing. Comparable to other Peruvian restaurants.\n\nArroz Norteno - Rice with squid, shrimp, mussels and other ingredients. Seafood was very fresh. Mussel was a bit fishy though. Rice was a bit too soft and chewy to my liking, unfortunately. Otherwise, it was really good.\n\nStrawberry and Mango-Passion Fruit Sorbet - Really refreshing and perfect way to end a delicious meal. :)\n\nInca Kola - Not part of the Dine About Town menu. I've had my first Inca Kola at Fresca, but I think I prefer La Mar's any day. It kind of reminds me of a bubbly/cream soda. A bit sweet.

This is gonna be a perfect setting on a rare warm SF night\". I was immediately crushed when she turned around and told us that the table she had for us was taken by someone else wtf? Strike one. Oh well indoor seating it is. The inside space is pretty spacious though but because of the higher ceilings and wide open area it is kinda loud and it can be hard to hear your own conversations at times. We ordered a few appetizers and a few drinks to start it off. As we waited, one of the servers gave us the wrong beer. Strike two. Luckily the guy who took our order was on top of it and swapped it out. We soon received our first dish pretty quickly so we were pretty happy. I think we were just happy to eat so we dug in but we realized halfway through the dish that it wasn't anything we ordered lol. They accidentally gave us a skewer dish which was pretty damn good! I guess that's strike 3??? But we were able to keep the dish and just finish it so we got an extra dish in the end for free so that wipes out all the strikes in my book lol.

Situated along the Embarcadero Pier 1 1/2, this scenic restaurant serves up amazing ceviche (they spell it cebiche) that hits the spot every time!\n\nTip: Make a dinner reservation as this place is super packed! For dinner, you can find street parking across the street or just avoid the hassle and park in the Embarcadero parking garage.\n\nAmbience: Great spot for celebrations, business meetings, and date night. The interior is modern, colorful, and just bright and festive. Lots of seating and they even have outdoor dining that overlooking the Bay Bridge. \n\nHospitality: Great for the many times I've been there, so no complaints from me. \n\nFood: La Mar serves up complimentary plantain chips with a variety of dipping sauces that are just divine. Their ceviche and fresh fish dishes tastes as good as it looks! If you're a newcomer, order the ceviche tasting which comes with an assortment of 3 types of ceviche for you to try. My favorites are the ceviche cl\u00e1sico and the mixto since it gives you the right amount of acidity paired with some spicy habanero pepper flavor. I have tried their causas before, but I am not a fan of glamorized potato or starch dishes. I would, however, urge you to try the grilled meat skewers (anticuchos) of pulpo (octopus) or calamari because both are done extremely well. As for entrees, I always end up ordering the arroz la mar which I can only liken to a Peruvian version of paella since it comes with plenty of seafood mixed in with flavorful arborio rice. As for drinks, if it's available, I highly recommend the prickly pear margarita. So good and even prettier to admire for its magenta color.

The waiter explained every part of the dishes we were interested in to perfection. He made me want to order it! Thanks Mr. Hawaii! \nMy wife ordered the salmon la mar. It was also very good. We had the blue corn drink and the passion fruit, both non-alcoholic delights! \nThe only problem we had and I hate to be in it up... but when we arrived, there was a woman at the host stand who got the attention of all 5 hostesses while we waited. Not all of them were actually helping. We felt a little ignored. And it was my birthday. The hostess asked my wife if it was a special occasion and she said \"yes, it's my husbands birthday. To which the response was, \"oh that's nice!\" But our waiter wasn't told. I'm not sure if they do anything for special occasions or not, but I did see another woman get a small dessert with a candle across the room later in our meal. \nNot a deal breaker for me though.

But every course here was a home run. \n\nOur party of four was not familiar with many of the Peruvian style menu, so we created our own tapas menu. We started with the cebiche sampler, one halibut, one halibut, calimari and scallops, and one ahi tuna. We all could have made a meal of any of these alone. The first two had a kick while the ahi was sweeter. \n\nThe empanadas sampler was next. Chicken, beef, shrimp and vegetable (mushroom on this night). Once again, could have been a meal--perfectly done, with crazy flavors. \n\nBut man am I glad we shared to save room for the Arroz La Mar. Our two couples each ordered this dish and split. The flavors were--well, just unlike anything I have ever eaten. The bowls were cleaned and we just couldn't stop talking about what we had just eaten. \n\nThen dessert. Our traveling companions had a chocolate dish they wowed about but I could have cared less because our tres leeches cake was the single best dessert I have ever eaten. \n\nWhen traveling here again, I would normally hesitate to repeat in such a great food town, but not this one.

It is only applicable in the bar area. \n\nI got a blue mule and my boyfriend got a cucumber gimlet. They were delicious! For happy hour food I got the calamari appetizer and he got a chicken empanada. Because of the previous night's festivities (New Years Eve) They only had ceviches, the calamari, and empanadas for happy hour. The calamari was good, it came with plantain chips. I would have liked more sauce. I ate too much of this and felt nauseous from all of the fried pieces.\n\nWe had dinner in the main room a little while later. I liked that they offered complimentary plantain chips with dipping sauces but would've enjoyed the dinner part better if I didn't spoil my appetite during happy hour. We split a lomo saltado which was perfect for our appetite. We finished off with a sorbet trio. Looking back I wish I didn't eat so much calamari during happy hour but the meal was still delicious regardless.\n\nI will say that the server was a little unnecessarily touchy.

As a native peruvian and a fan of Gaston Acurio (the owner and main chef), take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nThe food here is delicious.  I'm not exactly a fan of the price, since I know for a fact that peruvian food uses mostly simple, fresh and inexpensive ingredients.  But I suppose location is everything.  And speaking of which, the location is beautiful.  The ambiance is open, bright and has a beautiful view of Pier 1 1/2.  \n\nI'll start backwards with dessert.\n\n-  The picarones (sweet pumpkin/squash fritters with a molasses-based syrup) is ALMOST as good as the street vendors would serve in Lima Peru.  For someone who has never had them, I would highly recommend this dessert if you want the classic peruvian experience. \nOverall grade: 7.5/10\n\n-  The lunch sampler: almuercito carretillero 15 (Mixed seafood cebiche, chicken stew and rice and yucca fries with huancaina sauce)\nFirst off, the cebiche was (personally) the main highlight of this dish.  Fresh seafood marinated in lime juice with mixed herbs, a dash of garlic and pepper include shrimp, calamari, yellowtail, mussels, red onion, cilantro and the classic (and authentic) sweet yam on the side.  Simply perfect.\nThe chicken stew with rice was not exactly authentic.  However, delicious in its own right.  \nThe fried yucca with huancaina sauce was also not the most authentic tasting.  I'm used to eating this dish with a little more kick.  This can be accomplished if you use the rocoto sauce (red spicy sauce) mixed in.  Again, while not exactly as mama made it, it's still quite yummy. \nOverall grade: 7/10\n\n- The appetizer: Anticuchos de Carne (grilled steak skewers)\nNormally this dish is served with beef heart marinated for several hours.  However, because I was sharing with a non-peruvian guest, I felt more comfortable ordering the skirt steak version of the dish.  By far, one of my favorite peruvian appetizers ever.  The taste was spot on.  Cooked medium-rare (as it should be) and with all of the respective dipping sauces included.  This was definitely a hit.  \nOverall grade: 9/10\n\n- The drink: Maracuya Sour (Passion Fruit Pisco Sour)\nExcellent.  It was hard not to order 10 more.  \n9.5/10\n\nOverall (TL;DR):\n\n- Location and ambiance are phenomenal\n- A bit pricey for my liking\n- Food is mostly authentic, fresh, and will leave you satisfied\n- Can't go wrong with anything from the cocktail menu\n- Great for lunch, a date, or a dinner setting", "author": "Denisse M."}

First off, the restaurant is HUGE and is right on the water...hence it being on pier 1.5. Secondly, you can't beat the atmosphere here. It's one of those restaurants that's a great place to have some drinks with a group of friends or a date. Kind of a sexy vibe in here. Third - the foooood! I love Peruvian food and while it's not THAT hard to find in LA, I haven't found a Peruvian restaurant that has the same vibe and as good of food. Most Peruvian restaurants here are tr\u00e8s casual.\n\nAnywho, onto the food!\n\n- Ceviche - If you haven't had Peruvian ceviche then you don't know what's up yet. Mexican ceviche is whack after having this. Fresh fish (or sometimes other sea creatures) mixed with yams, red onion, peruvian corn (choclo) and habanero. I literally think about this ceviche all the time so needless to say, it's a must order when I go to La Mar.\n- Lomo Saltado - I have to start off by saying that it's WAY WAY WAY overpriced here at $32. This is essentially street food consisting of sirloin, onion, tomatoes, rice & french fries in a soy sauce based sauce. You can't go wrong with that combo but again, you can find for less than $10 at a casual Peruvian restaurant that tastes very similar. I would order this if you've never had Peruvian food but if not, save it for a cheaper restaurant.\n- Plantain, potato & sweet potato chips - these puppies come to you once you're seated and they're quite addicting. They also come with a trio of salsa's that only enhance the flavor. They used to give you 3 sauces - yellow, orange & green but they seemed to get rid of the green recently. You can still ask for it though.\n\nDrinks are good here as well as they take their time making them. Pisco sours are a great one to try but I stuck to the prickly pear margarita on this trip. It was good but nothing spectacular.\n\nOn other trips I've tried various other dishes such as the empanadas, causas, etc. all of which are good. Come to think of it, I haven't really had anything that was so-so. Anything you order off the menu will likely be delicious.\n\nTip - park in the lot behind pier 3 (which is basically a parking lot on the water).

You can try their popular pisco sour and punch while waiting for dinner service to begin or a nice house sangria.\n\nPatio seating in the back of the restaurant is covered with a plastic barrier to shield from the chilly winds of the bay. Eating dinner out there is a great experience when the skies are clear and the weather is nice, but the breeze in the evenings can still be cold!\n\nThe waiter was super helpful right off the bat. We asked for suggestions and he, being Peruvian himself, steered us in the right direction. We ended up ordering way too much food (happens more often than not) because we just couldn't decide between so many awesome offerings. We also couldn't pass up the squid ink pasta special they had that day, too. So between the two of us, we had the plantain/sweet potato chips, causa sampler, cebiche, a skewer, AND two entrees. Yes, it was a lot of food. But we still even considered adding empa\u00f1adas to our feast.\n \nThey give you fried plantain and sweet potato chips while you're waiting for your food. Of course we had to go with a ceviche, so we went with the cebiche jalape\u00f1o with salmon and octopus. It was a fusion of tangy, spicy, slimy, and chewy all in a delightful bowl. Our favorite was definitely the causa tasting. All 4 of the causas (lime\u00f1a, nikei, pulpo olivo, and rusa) were delicious. If I had to pick, my favorite would likely be the nikei or pulpo olivo. Next time, I don't think we would mind ordering one for each of us. We went with the beef heart skewer because it was something out of the ordinary. It had tons of flavor and it was a little tougher and not as juicy as steak, but definitely not as strange as I had anticipated.\n\nMy family from Sacramento has been here before and keep wanting to come back.

I love peruvian food but I don't know much about it - I just eat what's set out in front of me. So it was perfect for me to see a parade of delectable shared dishes. My favorite is always the whipped potato dishes and the ceviches. There was one entree that caused much confusion because people couldn't figure out if it was beef, chicken, or fish (and we had some fish-only eaters in the group)... it was weird because even the waiter didn't seem super confident in what it was. I guess you could say that based on this this protein wasn't super flavorful and was probably a bit overcooked (at the end we decided it was in fact fish), but everything else during the dinner was wonderful, especially this stewed beef that seemed to melt in your mouth. \n\nI do remember the dessert felt like a bit of an afterthought, and I would have much rather used the calories up on more of the main courses.

It was garnished with a dash of nutmeg which made the drink remind me of Christmas morning. After getting through the nutmeg, you could really taste the pineapple and rum... Don't be fooled by the size of this petite drink...  Having one might leave you a little tipsy. \n\nService: We had a reservation at 8:15 and was brought to our table by 8:10.

The plating looks nice. \n\nBut that's about it. :[\n\nWho doesn't like a waterfront view? And inside this under-the-sea matchy matchy theme inside the restaurant? But that's really about it. Everything was pretty much average or sadly under expectations. \n\nI've been here twice. Once on a regular day for an early dinner on a weekend, another time on Christmas Eve.  The restaurant is big enough so even without a reservation, the wait shouldn't be that bad. There are both tables and bar seating, and bar tables up front.  Plenty of space.\n\nSo it's a cebicheria, let me follow suits and order a ceviche. Both times I came, I ordered ceviche. First time was why is this so citrusy and sour and what happened to my seafood? For the longest time I hated ceviche. Second time was about the same.  They put too much citrus juice in their ceviches, you cannot actually enjoy the seafood for it's own. It gets a bit overwhelming for me and my tastebuds. \n\nAlright, let's try other stuff. So we had the arroz de la mar, which resembles a paella without the pan. We had the quinoa salad, what I had might not be the same as yours, since its ingredients are very seasonal. Presentation of the salad was pretty.  Mine had a cylindrical shaped of some yam with avocado on top and spinach and arugula above it all. Then drizzled this mango-like sauce all along the plate and quinoa splattered around. Taste-wise, decent, but the quinoa was a bit undercooked. The rice had pretty good fish, cooked just right, not too tough from being overcooked. Clams were a bit on the bad side, had a strong rotten taste to it.  They didn't do too well masking that taste or the quality of their clams was just barely average. The overall flavors of the dish was a bit lacking. \n\nWhat was really bad was the time needed at the restaurant.  I told my server that I'll have the ceviche and the salad while my love orders the rice. It's terrible for me to get both my food before my date. He ended up picking at my ceviche too and munching on the free chips. I basically left my salad sitting there for 30-45 mins while waiting for his rice to come.  Our server didn't really take the initiative to check on our foods either.\n\nBut yea, all in all, I paid for my view. YAY!!!!!", "author": "Connie C."}

We made sure to tell the waiter tonight the list of ingredients that will elicit an allergic reaction from my daughter, but her entree still arrived with one of those ingredients! After waiting quite a while for a \"new\" dish, her meal arrived and she still found the offending ingredient - 1 pea! We became suspicious that her first dish was probably taken to the kitchen and someone sorted through it and still missed to get every one of the peas. Absolutely not okay; anaphylaxis is not a joke. The manager said that the kitchen would not have done that; that it could have been a cross contamination because it's a popular dish. All I know is that the waiter was informed when we ordered. This type of incident is how a customer like myself loses trust in restaurants. We were provided a gift card after I refused any adjustment on our bill, which was already paid before I spoke to the manager. Disappointing experience. For those with allergies, be very careful if you want to eat at this place. I'm not sure how conscientious the chef and assistants in the kitchen are in listening to their customers.

However, it wasn't until watching an episode of \"Unique Eats\" on the Cooking Channel and hearing about the Leche de Tigre (Tiger's Milk) and its \"healing\" effects did it quickly raise the ranks on my bookmark list. My friend also saw the same episode and brought it up in conversation, so we both decided it would be next on our hit list.\n\nOn Wednesday, 6.1.11, my friend and I arrived for our 7 PM reservations and were promptly seated. FYI, if you can't find a feasible day/time on OpenTable, call for reservations instead.\n\nFOOD\n*COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS  - Yam, Plantain & Potato Chips w/ 3 Housemade Dips: 5 STARS\n\nThe chips were perfectly fried to a light crispiness and were ADDICTING! The yam was my fav one as the sprinkle of salt brought out its natural sweetness. We liked the habanero dip the best as it was the most flavorful; savory and garlicky with a huge fiery kick. The other 2 sauce were too bland to even make out what they were.\n\n*CEBICHE TASTING ($31): 4 STARS\n1) Clasico (Halibut, Red Onion, Corn & Yam): The chunks of halibut were soft and moist and the tiger's milk gave it creamy tanginess without overpowering the delicate taste of the fish. The corn and yam were a nice addition giving it a hint of sweetness.\n\n2) Mixto (Yellowtail, Octopus, Cilantro, Habanero, Corn & Yam): Although the yellowtail and the octopus were super fresh and tender, this was our least fav cebiche as the chili based tiger's milk was too assertive and overpowered the seafood.\n\n3) Chorrillano (Yellowtail, Mussels, Calamari, Shrimp, Cancha & Celery):  This cebiche also had a chili based tiger's milk, however, the heat and tanginess was more subtle so it didn't hinder the natural sweetness of the seafood. I loved the cancha (toasted corn) which provided a nice crispy texture contrast.\n\n4) Nikei (Ahi Tuna, Red Onion, Avocado, Nori & Sesame): My fav cebiche as it was the perfect rendition of an Hawaiian Poke. The delicate chunks of ahi were dressed in a tamarind based tiger's milk which gave it a subtle sweet and sour flavor. The avocado added a layer of butteryness while the nori and sesame were the icing on the cake giving it that bite of nuttiness. \n\n*CAUSAS TASTING ($21): 4 STARS\n1) Lime\u00f1a (Crab, Avocado & Quail Egg): My Fav! Savory, creamy and sweet; it was like eating a crab salad sandwich with lightly whipped potatoes instead of the bread.\n\n2) Saltadito (Fish, Shrimp, Calamari w/ a Soy-Oyster Reduction): The soy-oyster reduction overpowered the delicate seafood making the causas too salty. \n\n3) Nikei (Ahi Tuna, Avocado & Nori): My 2nd Fav! The sweet tender ahi, buttery avocado and toasty nori along with the whipped potatoes was like taking a tuna tartare to a whole new level of creamy decadence.\n\n4) Casera (Artichokes, Asparagus, Avocado & Tomato Confit): Our least fav as it had an unappetizing tangy and bitterness. \n\n*LOMO SALTADO - Stir-fried Beef Tenderloin, Onions, Tomatoes, Soy, Garlic w/ Fries & Rice ($29) - 3 STARS\n\nRecommended by many Yelpers, this dish was OVERRATED! Lomo Saltado is like a Peruvian version of Vietnamese Shaking Beef with tomatoes and fries. My friend hit the nail on the head when she said this dish tasted too familiar. Although the beef was tender with a good balance of saltiness and tang, it was very forgettable. I had better \"shaking beef\" at Vietnamese Restaurants for 1/3 of the cost. \n\n*ESFERA DE CHOCOLATE - Chocolate Sphere w/ Lucuma Ice Cream, Vanilla Foam w/ Hot Chocolate Sauce ($12) - 5 STARS\n\nAs the hot chocolate sauce was poured tableside, it slightly melted the chocolate sphere which made it a touch oeeey goeey. The lucuma (tropical fruit) ice cream core was sweet and creamy and its taste resembled a pumpkin with a citrus twist. The layer between the chocolate sphere and ice cream core was the fluffly vanilla foam which helped lighten the dessert.\n\nSERVICE\nFriendly, knowledgeable, and attentive; however there was slight language barrier with one of the food runners. He also talked so fast that we couldn't understand him and when it came time to pack up our meal, he had thrown away our rice that came with our lomo saltado.  \n\nDishes were well-timed and water glasses were always filled which is always a plus.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR\nLa Mar is a HUGE restaurant that's perfect for large parties. There's a bar in the front, a lounge area, sushi bar-type seating, dining area seating and seating in the outer patio. The d\u00e9cor is crisp and simple; big open space, wooden floors and furnishings accented with bright ocean blue d\u00e9cor gives it that Miami Beach feel. \n\nPARKING\nEasy street parking before 5:45 PM. Parking lot across the street is $15.\n\nI didn't feel any \"healing\" effects of the Leche de Tigre, however, I'm glad this is what drew me into La Mar.

I asked our server if the dishes were served ala carte or individual style; he advised us it was individual style (wrong) and that they would be too small to share. Based on this advice, we ordered a cebiche, empanadas, a beef skewer and arroz jugoso. This was MORE than enough for 2 people and we had to pack food to take home. \n\nEverything was delicious. I could have skipped on the skewer but it was still tasty. \n\nMinus 1 star for the DIRTY, DISGUSTING bathrooms and minus another for the poor recommendations from our server.

The potato dishes were great, we got the taster and my favorite was the tuna tartare one. I also had the paella-like rice with seafood. I didn't enjoy it as much as the lomo saltado.

I opted for the non-vegetarian option this time....you can't expect me to the eat the same thing twice, especially if I have to pay $40 for it!\n\nOption 1 (non-veg) featured the following:\nCausa Limena - the fresh dungeness crab was delicious. It was finely shredded and placed atop a avocado puree which was to die for. The basil cilantro oil added just the right amount of kick to this dish.\n\nCebiche Mixto - the calamari was melt in your mouth amazing. The Peruvian corn was way more starchy than I expected....I think regular corn would have been better. However, overall, I thought the Cebiche was too acidic. I understand the concept of acid cooking, but this was too much in my opinion. I've had it more subtle and better elsewhere.\n\nLomo Saltado - the flat iron steak was done perfectly...my pieces were ultra tender. There were a crap ton of onions though, that kind of sucked. The fried potatoes were delicious though. It was served with rice that was mixed with some of the starchy corn - in this form, it tasted pretty good though. I was fairly tempted to ask for chopsticks at this point, but I didn't. But I have to say, eating rice sans chopsticks just felt wrong!\n\nPassion Fruit Tart - the menu says mousse tart...what they don't say is delivered frozen. But it was a delicious, totally refreshing end to a pretty satisfying meal. \n\nAll in all good, not as good as the first time, but my tastebuds are a little more experienced these days.

Dinner reservation was 6:30 PM. At 12:20 PM day of the event, I received a phone call that the restaurant needed to close due to lack of hot water. Needless to say, I was speechless. When did you discover this? Last night she said. Why didn't you call sooner?  We thought it could be fixed she said. \n\nThe event coordinator stated that she had emailed all event other coordinator's in the city to see if our party could be accommodated. When will you know?  Not sure she said. Nearing 2 PM, she called with a restaurant...JAPANESE! I love Japanese food but not even close to La Mar's menu. \n\nWe worked with the helpful concierge at the JW Marriott and found a restaurant. \n\nHere's the issue... Things happen that are out of our control but we do control how it's handled. \n\n#1. I should've been contacted immediately telling me about he possibility so that I can make other arrangements. 14 people in the city...yeah, that's easy.  \n\n#2. She should've been apologetic rather than sound annoyed when I stood frustrated about what I was hearing. \n\n#3. I signed a contract that guarantees a payment to the restaurant if not notified 7 to 3 days in advance depending on the situation. Obviously this is absolutely one-sided because I have received no compensation.\n\n\"Guest Count - La mar requires a guaranteed final guest count confirmation 3 business days prior the event. If your guests count is less than the number guaranteed you will still be charged for the guaranteed number. If we are not notified by email of your guaranteed count 3 business days prior to your event we will use your original guest count as the confirmed number, and you will be charged accordingly.\n \nService Charge, Tax and Payment - Events are subject to a 20% Service Charge, 4% SF Mandate and 8.75% California Sales Tax. La mar requires a signed credit card guarantee form to confirm a reservation. Payment is due upon conclusion of the event. We accept major credit cards, corporate checks and cash. La mar does not accept personal checks.\n \nCancellation - On reservations of 9 people and larger, there is a mandatory 7 business days prior notice required if you intend to cancel your reservation. If you cancel in less than 7 business days from the date of your reservation, or do not show up to fulfill the reservation date and time, there will be a $25 per person charge on the securing credit card for violation of the cancellation notice policy.\"\n\nFinally and most importantly, I never heard from anyone NOT even the event coordinator that I worked with originally. \n\nBeyond disappointing.", "author": "Sue H."}

Assuming the place was packed, I saw a group of people waiting to be seated. The experience started off with the hostess telling us the wait time was 15 minutes for a table so we complied and sat in the bar area to get some alcoholic drinks. We managed to find two seats and ordered the Pisco Sour, which was made pretty quick. The bartender was nice and genuine; he made up for the hostess's mediocre customer service. As soon as we were told there was a spot, we grabbed our drinks and walked to our table. Along the way, I wondered why the wait was 15 minutes if there were a lot of tables free? Nonetheless we got a really good spot outside to see the view... However, it was dark outside so the wait to an exceptional spot was pointless.\n\nI looked at the menu and was disappointed to not have found \"pescado a lo macho.\" If the place is a cebicheria then it should have that particular plate. Bummed out, I scanned the menu and ordered arroz con mariscos which was listed as something else. We ordered and out came complimentary plantains chips. \n\nOur dishes came; my friends ordered the Lomo Saltado and it smelled fantastic. My dish had saucy rice with fish, shrimp, squid and calamari and was garnished with parsley. The rice was good but compared to the authentic Peruvian food I have tried, this dish can't measure up.

Our table was set with these incredible sweet potato and plantain chips that we ate two baskets of while we waited for a cebiche sampler, which included every cebiche they had. Our favorites were the tuna cebiche, which was perfectly sweet and wonderfully garnished, and the white fish cebiche, which was accented perfectly with sweet red onions.\n\nFor my main course, I had arroz la mar, which came with shrimp, little octopi, a nice slice of white fish, clams, oysters and something our waiter called Peruvian corn. It was amazing, but I definitely couldn't finish it all on my own. Two of my coworkers had lomo saltado, which is beef tenderloin with tomatos and French fries, and they adored it as well.\n\nAnd of course, no meal is complete without some dessert to share, despite how full we were already. We got a plate of every dessert and shared, and they were all beautifully plated and delicious.

Usually that's a sign that they haven't maintained their quality. We were seated immediately despite the craziness of the pre super bowl 50th festivities. Staff was very nice and attentive. Our children were so hungry and grumpy we ordered their salmon entree plate immediately. It came out fast and hot. The food was so good. Extremely small piece of salmon but it was marinaded and cooked to perfection. No one likes a rubbery piece of fish. The quinoa was a creamy corn kind of consistency and my kids love corn so it was definitely a hit! I was so excited about the rest of the food we would order next. The cocktails came out first and they were really good. I ordered a jack and Coke and who ever messed that up should be stoned! Lol! But the pico sour  was just amazing. I've never had one before and I know it's a Peruvian liquor but it tastes to me like a clear whiskey. The froth with a perfectly amount of tart and sweetness was a define cocktail! The chips and plantains were perfect crunchy and salted... Went well with the cebiche. Cebiche from the lunch menu was interesting. Very different to those I've tried before. Very tart and it had a creamy turmeric/curry sauce over it. I didn't love it or hate it. It was different. Them the lomo Saltado came out and gosh... What a ginormous disappointment. Although it's a Peruvian seafood place... The lomo Saltado is a simple authentic dish gone so wrong here. Steak tasted like a cheap quality steak that was tenderized so the quality itself was way off. And then the flavor... Salty and a synthetic like gravy. Like pf changs of Chinese food. Although the there were bell peppers and onions in it the flavor weren't in the dish at all. It was strange. The chicken wing was super spicy which I love and super salty. That was it... Inedible and nothing in between. It tasted like bachelor food... Deep fried wings with lots of shiracha and table salt. Bleh!!! 4 of 7 of our guest at our table hated it... 3 were kids that didn't touch it. Lol! The mixed seafood sizzling platter tasted decent  which is why I gave them an extra star. The seafood was good. It was cooked to perfection and the parsley onion mixture on top was a great touch over it. The sauce was just not anything good which it why I can't call it a must have dish. It was very red so I expected spicy flavor but nothing that was spicy or garlicky, just rich in color but nothing. I think if there was garlic and something else along with the parsley salsa mixture it would've made it a 5 star alone. My gf ordered a burger and they didn't bring it out but since the rest of the non seafood dishes were so bad we packed up and left. There was some strange surcharge for the city on there also but expect a very high bill and not high quality food. Since it at a convenient location and a big venue to feed the hungry and larger quantity of people fast... Just stick to the seafood dishes. It's the safest bet.", "author": "Linh T."}

White and blues are my kinds of colors :) \n\nWe came here at lunch during Dine About Town. We made reservations but they have a really big space and there was a good amount of seating available, including a patio area with a view of the bay. There were two prie fixe menus, one with meat and one that was vegetarian. We decided to try one of each. They brought out some chips with dipping sauces before our first course, which I really enjoyed. The potato chips were good but I enjoyed the sweet potato ones more. They were cut pretty thin and weren't that oily so you could really taste the sweet potato. \n\nCausa Casera - Yellow potato was really good! Avocado was prominent but I wished I could have tasted a bit more of the artichoke flavors as well. \nEmpanada K'apchi - Super crispy and the mushrooms were delicious, I just wish there were even more of them!\nArroz Fusion - Good flavor. Not quite as exciting as the Arroz Norteno on the other menu since that had seafood, but it was still very tasty.\nMango Sorbet - The menu had a Peruvian purple corn sorbet listed, which I was excited to try, but I ended up lovinnnng the mango sorbet. I am quite picky about my fruit flavored desserts because I want them to be more tart than sweet... this mango sorbet was so tart and delicious!!! It is probably not for everyone though. \n\nThey also brought out some complimentary house made jellies at the end, I loved the blood orange sauce that was on the plate with the jellies.\n\nOverall a good dining experience! Would definitely recommend for Dine About Town as well because you get four courses for lunch instead of the usual three at other restaurant (yes, they are a bit small though) and a tasty freebie before and after your meal as well!", "author": "Sophie Y."}

This restaurant's ownership involves Peru's greatest known chef, a man who has probably done more than anyone else to expose Peru to the international culinary world (TV food shows help a lot with that effot). \n\nThe restaurant is sensitive to the unfamiliarity, and makes efforts to help diners interpret the large menu and make choices appropriate to their taste.  Out waiter was very professional, personally engaging, and effective.  Since we were there on a Tuesday, the restaurant was not completely full, but it had filled most tables.  The noise level was fine for talking, despite the fact that the space has a lot of \"hardscape.\"  It would be louder on weekends, of course.  \n\nThe food was excellent!  The Pisco Sours were excellent.  Of course, the fish is Sashimi Grade, so the freshness and flavors were what one should expect in cebiche.  I had one cebiche dish (not cooked with heat, cooked \"chemically\" by the acid in the lime juice) and one cooked dish, the Pulpo (octopus) skewer.  As I'd expect from a restaurant of this calibre, the pulpo was not rubbery, but was tender and flavorful.  My dining companion had a seafood salad, which she loved.  My cebiche was so flavorful that I ensured to get every last drop of the liquid, when I'd finished the fish.  That liquid, which they call \"Leche de Tigre\" (Tiger's milk -- but nothing to do with the beverage by that name) is so tasty they sell it by the shot, too, aside from its primary use in cebiche.\n\nIt was a nice touch when Enrique, the manager, came by to check on us to ensure that we were happy with everything.  We were!\n\nAs an interesting side note, our waiter told us that this restaurant sells more pisco than anywhere else.  They've created many cocktails using that liquor to showcase its versatility.  Of course, they have a full bar for those who want other drinks.\n\nEnough. Just go ahead and make that reservation.", "author": "Dick B."}

This was the most disappointing item we had last night.\n\nCorazon -- well cooked and tender, but rather flavorless.\n\nSopa seca -- the sauce was very watery, and not all the shellfish opened up (ie: they were dead prior to cooking).

Downside: They did not record our reservation and atop of that the waitress accommodated us but he was specific that we only had until 8:00 pm to eat because they had all sold out. That, in my opinion, is a huge lack of respect and no appreciation to the clients. We kind of felt discriminated. Better would be for them to tell us that there was no space to accommodate us than setting us a deadline for eating. \n\nWhat we really regret is that this was our second time in the place.

Being both a fan of seafood and good Peruvian food, I made a reservation for lunch with my friend's pre-birthday and our monthly lunch. We pick a new restaurant each time.\n\nToday was simply gorgeous, our current heat wave made me crave the sunshine and sitting on the bay. I simply couldn't sit inside. Since there was a wait, we went to the bar. I ordered a  Waikicha, a pisco drink with pomegranate, lemon and mint. \n\nWhen we were seated, the view and feel of the outdoor lounge made me feel like I was somewhere else. Watching the boats go by, sitting in the sun, perfection.  We ordered the: \n\n*Cebiche Classico: California Halibut and red onions in habanero pepper leche de tigre with Peruvian corn and yam. VERY GOOD, also No. 47 on the 7x7 Big Eat List. Checked off. :)\n*Rollo Encebichado: Shrimp, dungeness crab, cucumber and avocado roll topped with sliced ahi tuna and an aji amarillo jalape\u00f1o sauce. Really great~! \n* Lomo Saltado: Traditional Peruvian style stir-fry of saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, garlic and soy sauce, with fried potatoes and rice. Beef was so tender and good, I was really pleased with my order.\n*Sudado Mochica: Today's Special - Traditional Stew of the north with fresh shellfish of  the day, with Aji amarillo and yellow squash. So savory and good, the seafood was so fresh and delicious. \n\nJust looking back at the pictures I took, it makes me hungry and reminds me of what a great experience I had at Lar Mar today.

If I knew about the decor and prime location, I would've considered using it as a wedding reception venue.  The food could be better though.\n\nRollo Norteno - I'm not sure why we decided to get a Japanese sushi roll but it actually wasn't that bad considering that they were using really fresh and plump shrimp.  That really carried the roll, otherwise it wasn't that unique. I found it strange that the soy sauce was not very salty. \n\nEmpanadas de lomo saltado (Stuffed with beef tenderloin, red onions, and tomato) - Speaking of salty, the meat was too salty.  One order comes with two big pieces which are piping hot.  It came with a side of thinly slicked, pickled red onions.  The flavor of the meat and the texture of the pastry was really nice though.\n\nCebiche cl\u00e1sico (California Halibut in a classic leche de tigre, red onions, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam) - I was really disappointed in this mainly because most of the dish was lukewarm.  The juice was a murky white color.  The halibut were nice, big pieces but overall the flavor was a bit bland I couldn't even taste any lime.\n\nArroz norte\u00f1o (Cilantro fried rice with a seafood combination of mussels, shrimp, octopus, and Huanca\u00edna sauce) - This is one of those dishes that tastes better the day after as leftovers.  The flavors are able to seep into the rice a bit more because when I had this dish at the restaurant, it was a bit bland.\n\nOne big plus are the chips that you get in the beginning.  They're a combination of regular potato chips, sweet potato chips, and plantain chips with three dipping sauces that aren't too different from one another.

It also just didn't need to be that spicy. The desserts were delicious (carmelized quinoa dish and the tres leches), but for $13 each, were incredibly small. Great service at the table but very curt and unfriendly hostess at check-in. We had accidentally made the reservation for the next day and the reception to asking if we still might be able to sit outside was not warm. They still were able to seat us inside (it was Sunday evening, they weren't that busy) but the AC was on high and it was very cold.", "author": "Sophie R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "A few days ago for our trip to SF, one of the rare times we go, we were all out of ideas but remembered this place being crowded and being legit for Peruvian food since it has locations in Miami and in other parts of South America. This must be the real deal!\n\nWhen we arrived a little before 12 AM, nobody sat inside but everybody was outside enjoying the cool wind, nice sunlight, and beautiful ocean view. I was a bit confused that there was not really anyone since it was the ideal time to have lunch on a weekend but I soon realized that we arrived at opening time. We secured a spot and it came with the gorgeous view.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nPLANTAIN (BANANA), KETTLE, SWEET POTATO (ASSORTMENT) CHIPS: This was complimentary and it came with 2 supposedly spicy dipping sauces that tasted very similar. My favorite was the plantain (banana) chips because they were very unique and they didn't really taste like bananas since they weren't sweet at all. \n\nLOMITO SALTADO ($15): This was basically a sandwich served in acme bread with melted gouda cheese, avocado, and papas al hilo with a choice of fries or a salad. It was okay and nothing too special.\n\nCEBICHE CL\u00c1SICO ($18): This was a ceviche and had California halibut, red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn, and yam. It tasted clean, fresh, and was one of the best ceviches I've had.\n\nARROZ NEGRO ($28): This had grilled calamari and shrimp on top of squid ink arborio rice with ahi panca, aji amarillo, bell peppers, choclo and parmesan, garnished with rococo creamy chalaca. The calamari was particularly strong because it had a really good texture and \"chew\" to it. I liked how the grilled calamari and shrimp retained the grilled taste but was not burnt at all. \n\nHAMBURGUESA A LA POBRE ($17): This was a kobe beef burger served on acme bread accompanied with fried egg, banana, gouda cheese, tomato, jalape\u00f1o, and greens with a salsa criolla sauce. It came with sweet potato fries. This was one of the most interesting and best burgers I've had. It was sweet, spicy, salty, and savory. It had a good balance of flavors with nothing too overwhelming. Also, it was huge and could easily be split between 2 people unless you are a big eater.\n\nTOCINO DEL CIELO ($13): This was a coconut-crusted flan with pineapple and peach tartar, caramelized pineapple mousse, and garnished with tuple. It was pretty good and reminded me of one I had at Jaleo in Las Vegas. The flavors and the chew from the coconut-crust went well together. However, this is not worth $13. \n\nSERVICE: The service was nothing really special. He was nice and always made sure we were doing fine. When this other guy asked which dish goes to which person, I felt like they should have known especially for the price we were paying.\n\nDECOR: The place was quite pretty outside and nothing that special on the inside. Outside, you can soak up the sunlight and enjoy the gorgeous ocean and the waves. The view was really nice and yet we weren't getting burnt by the sun.\n\nWill I return? Yes, I would. I would go back for the burger and the ceviche. Most of the items we ordered were very strong and were overall just really well done. It was worth it for the price because even though it is expensive, you do get quality and quantity.", "author": "Jacquie H."}

So we were so happy to know that they have a restaurant in San Fran with a similar menu!  The location was perfect as its close to the ferry building and you can get a nice water view. They had yummy plantains for starters and their maracuya sour and pisco sour was refreshing. We also enjoyed their ceviche, plancha marina and empanadas.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-17", "description": "When I first heard the name, I thought it was one word and envisioned soul food by some dude named Lamar.  Upon actually eating here, I was impressed by the Peruvian food that outfancied Limon.  \n\nChips: I can't believe this is free!  Fried plantains, potatoes, yams, purple potatoes and other tubers served with three creamy dipping sauce options.  I could make a meal of these and a few piscos... dangerous!\n\nCebiche Mixto: A tad spicy, but in a good way.  Enjoyed the texture contrast between the soft mahi mahi and chewy octopus.\n\nCebiche Chifa: I am a huge fan of fried stuff contrasting ceviche.  The wonton strips against the Asian spices of sesame, cilantro, ginger and scallion was a perfect pairing.  Would have been nice if they ventured into other fish than the Mahi Mahi which seems to appear in every ceviche.\n\nCebiche Nikei: Tuna, red onion and avocado have been done together so many times.  It was the tamarind that added a nice sour kick to the classic flavor profile.  Nice, but not exotic enough for me.\n\nCebiche Clasico: I like the use of pasty yams amongst the halibut to add some substance to the typically light ceviche.  The fresh corn shavings were a good texture differentiator as well.  Overall, a bit milder than the others but still nice.\n\nCausa Limena: Very San Francisco with the dungeness crab and avocado.  Pretty bland against the whipped potato, though no single ingredient had a dominating personality.\n\nCausa Nikei: Also a little bland since tuna and avocado are pretty tame.  Felt nice and creamy when eating.\n\nCausa Casera: Veggie, but in a good way.  The asparagus added a nice crunch to the otherwise mushy texture profile.  The basil cilantro oil added a nice kick which probably should have been leveraged in some of the fish causas.\n\nCausa Criolla: I think this one was the one with a big piece of grilled fish on top.  The fish dominated the causa and made it feel like a bit of a fish entr\u00e9e which happened to be resting on mashed potatoes.  Could have used some more spices. \n\nLomo Saltado: Lomo Saltado is my favorite Peruvian dish so I must try it at any Peruvian restaurant I eat at.  I was a little put off that they charged $27 for a dish as simple and common as stir fried rice.  The fries, beef strips, tomato, red onion, cilantro and soy sauce based marinade were all on point.  Though I still didn't feel this was fancified enough to warrant the price inflation.\n\nTacu Tacu Norte\u00f1o: I'll be honest, I ordered this because I wanted to try the tacu tacu.  The canary beans were mashed into the rice in proper proportions.  They could have fried it a bit to make it crispy though.  The seafood on top was nice, but could have used more of the Huanca\u00edna sauce.", "author": "Adam B."}

It really is hard to enjoy a fine meal when you can't hear the other folks at your table.  We spoke with management about one particular party of 10 that was super loud.  The response was that they have a right to enjoy themselves. Sure, but excessive levels of noise causing everyone around them to not enjoy their meals is not equitable. This is a problem that has been happening all over town in the last few years and quite frankly it's the younger crowd that's responsible.\nOur experience caused us to finish our meal quickly leave for another restaurant for dessert. \nWe have been to La Mar many times in the past and we will come back for the piscos but only in the bar.

I made reservations for 4 at 8:15pm on a Friday thinking that there shouldn't be a lot of people to seat around then.  When we checked in at the front, they told us that our table would be awhile but that we could wait at the bar.  Not a big deal, so we headed into the bar.  We ordered a Pisco Punch, a Pisco Sour, a beer, and iced tea from the one waitress that was trying to serve everyone in the bar area.  20 minutes, we still had no drinks, and still were waiting for our table.  Ultimately, we got our drinks and our table around the same time.  The restaurant itself is huge, since it opens further in the back and even outside.  Our waiter was nice, but not very informative beyond rattling off the specials of the day.  Anyway, for the appetizers, we ordered the Cebiche Chifa and Cebiche Nikei.  The two dishes had the right amount to share among 4 people, especially when you factor in the delicious chips and savory dips they put on your table before your orders come out.  The two cebiches were delicious, but my favorite was the Chifa with the yellowtail  tuna with peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots and daikon, habanero, wonton strips and cilantro in a sweet and sour sesame oil.  For the mains, we had the following:\n\n- Arroz Jugoso: Prawns, clams, mussels, calamari, white fish and vegetables in rice with a blend of Peruvian sauces - served with rocoto aioli and toasted bread \n- Lomo Saltado: Your standard traditional Peruvian style stir fry beef tenderloin; saut\u00e9ed with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic with fried potatoes and rice\n- One of the specials on the menu, \"Paiche\":  Grilled Peruvian fish from the Amazon river, with wok saut\u00e9ed asparagus and mushrooms with onions, garlic, ginger and oyster sauce served with a side of quinoa chaufa\n\nGreg and I both had the Lomo Saltado since who can say no to a beef tenderloin?  Our server only came by once throughout the meal, and while the food was about 4 stars, the prices for it were comparable to a place I'd give 5 stars to.  My parents enjoyed both of their meals, which was the most important part of dinner, however I think La Mar would be a great place for happy hour or just drinks.  Out of everything, the ceviches were my favorite part of dinner, but since the service at the bar/reception was so-so and it was a pricey experience, I have to settle on this place being just OK.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I personally liked the veggie one the best, but they were all good. What fried food isn't good anyway? We also got the ahi sashimi which was very fresh. Of course, we had to try the signature cocktail, so we got the pisco sour. I'm not really too crazy about the raw egg white foam stuff, but it was alright. When in Peru....

I'm aware it is a family business and they have spent time and energy in building a name for themselves.  If you read many of the reviews, the poor ratings are often because of the service/wait staff.  This was exactly our experience. I seldom write poor reviews but feel I this was important to improve customer service.\n\nWe have been there previously last year, the service and food was great!  Unfortunately, that was not our experience last month with a party of 7.  To summarize, this was the first time for all but 2 of us and guests requested recommendations and explanations from our waitress.\nWhile in the midst of explaining the menu to one of the guest - she stops and says to him \"just a minute, I have to go and take care of the other table.\"  She proceeds to go over to the next table and take their orders.  It took some time for her to return, with no apology whatsoever.\nWhen asked why she left, there wasn't any valid explanation or remorse - with that we asked for the manager.  \n\nThe manager came over, slightly apologized and offered another server - said they'd take good care of us, but never saw him again. Our orders were taken, the food came - service was quite frankly below par.  As a matter of fact the two salads we ordered never got came and we eventually cancelled it after the entrees were served.  When the bill arrived - the salads were still charged, when mentioned there were jesters of acts of apology.  \n\nThe first waitress' action was inexcusable, the manager's lack of concern barely acceptable and the second waiter's inattentiveness and failing to remove the cost of dishes not served after it was pointed out, was too much in one evening to let it go unreported.  Sadly to say we wonder if this is a reflection on the management's lack of concern regarding customer service.  \n\nOne last point - several of the guest attempted to use the bathroom directly across from the reception desk - ALL were appalled at the condition of the bathroom at such an upscale restaurant, or for that matter any restaurant.  In fact, after opening the door and seeing the unkept bathroom, I immediately closed the door to find one that was more acceptable.\n\nI love peruvian cuisine - but sorry to say I will not be returning to La Mar until I read that the service has improved!", "author": "Cincia H."}

My husband and I received a gift card to this restaurant a few weeks ago. We were excited to try a nice restaurant in the city. We were able to make our appointment online, which was very much appreciated.\n\nWhen we got to the establishment, we were taken by the hostess to our table. This hostess zoomed past us with a pace close to jogging. We had to make sure we could see her to know where she turned.\n\nWe were seated and given the chips and dip. After looking over the menu briefly out waiter Shane came to the table. With a hard to understand hello, he just stood there with his pen ready in hand. I guess it was our job to greet him first. I ordered a drink, and my husband asked if we could see how much we had on our gift card, our second mistake of the night.He came back and notified us of how much was on the card. By that time we were ready to order, but were already turned off at the fact that Shane made it clear that he did not want to waiter our table. To put it nicely, he had a stick up his ass the whole time. \n\nWe received our food by Dustin, by far the most friendly person we had come in contact that night. Jose, I believe who was the busboy made our night. He went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of, very sweet man.\n\nWhat was extremely disturbing from our experience was that we were given less than mediocre service, perhaps based on the way we looked or simply because Shane assumed we did not deserve good service as a result of having a gift card. Shane made rounds to the neighboring tables refilling water asking how the food was. He walked passed our table, slightly paused and saw that our glasses were half full, yet continued to walk around us and asked to refill the water of the fancier looking couple across from us. \n\nShane had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, after really only visiting our table to get our order and to give us the check.\n\nWe spoke with the manager afterwards, expressing our complaint on what awful service we were given by Shane. She seemed sincere in her apology, and offered for us to come back to experience what the proper service of the establishment really was. As nice as the offer was, we have no desire to ever step into this stuck up, judgmental establishment again. \n\nFor the sake of the restaurant, I hope they retrain their staff on how to do their job right and to not be discriminatory towards its patrons.", "author": "Silvia C."}

It had been awhile since we were last here and somehow remembered it better (guess not, since we gave a 3 last time as well)\n\nWe had an order of chef option 1- octopus/black olive causa, ceviche mixto, seafood rice, purple corn sorbet and a main menu entree order of the chicharron pork belly sandwich\n\nFor a ceviche (or should we say cebiche) place, the dishes were surprisingly lacking in acid. The ceviche mixto was extremely disappointing- no acid, no salt, just kind of a bland mush of one shrimp, one piece of fish, and some calamari. The chicharron sandwich was crunchy, fatty, but also lacking salt and something to balance the meatiness. The lightly pickled red onion just didn't do it. We craved a slaw of some sort or at least a sauce to give the sandwich a kick. Funnily enough, the thing that had the most oomph and acid in the meal was the balsamic dressed side salad that came with the sandwich. The one plate we did like quite a lot was the octopus causa which was was flavorful, balanced, and quite interesting. \n\nThe complimentary potato, sweet potato, (and occasional) plantain chips are yummy though occasionally a bit over fried with choice of two sauces. The spicy orange one was fantastic- if you ask, they will bring you more and refill. We're excited they updated the dips since our last visit.\n\nOverall, not too expensive of a \"chef's tasting\" for $19.95 for lunch but not the exciting food we were looking for.

Me and my wife ordered 2 pisco sours and while the drinks were strong and not watered down, they still didnt taste as something unique. We also ordered the cebiche sampler that comes with regular, mixto and nikkei cebiches and while my wife loved all of them (she is from mexico) it wasnt that good for me except for the nikkei one. The fish was too soft to eat and the leche de tigre juice didnt have any rocoto at all ... and thats straight up murder on a cebiche plate. Finally we ordered a lomo saltado and a La Mar seafood rice. The lomo meat was tender but the cook used too many sauce in the whole plate making it feel like a stew which is not how a lomo saltado should be. It also was suuuuuuper salty. The seafood rice was also ok, but i didnt like that the rice itself was mushy and not grainy. Flavors were average as well. \nAs a restaurant that markets itself as a fancy peruvian option I wont recommend it. Its on the San Francisco pier, so of course its not going to be cheap, but as a peruvian I can say I have been to other less fancy places which offer better tasting dishes by a fraction of La Mar's prices.", "author": "George P."}

Our server was very friendly. He explained the menu since it was our first time eating there and gave his recommendations. We enjoyed everything we ordered, including the complimentary plantain chips and aoli dip. I ordered the prickly pear margarita to drink which was not as sweet as I anticipated so I really liked it. I had the lomo saltado per the server's recommendation. It was really good. I thought it would be a heavy dish because of the beef and potatoes and expected I would need to bring most of it home. I ended up eating most of it and didn't have enough to bring home after all. Though I practically finished the whole dish I surprisingly didn't feel like a blob or uncomfortably full at all. My bf ordered the plancha marina which he really enjoyed and he can be kind of a picky eater. We liked our server but he seemed to have gotten pretty busy towards the end, so it took a while for us to get our check and finally get out of there. The food was pricey, but very good. The service got a little slow at the end, but wasn't something I would raise a complaint about. The music choice that was playing in the restaurant was a little odd. Definitely heard 2 different songs from the movie Grease, among some other unexpected choices. The music did not match the vibe of the restaurant at all lol.

It depends greatly on what you order, but suffice to say a simple lunch could be anywhere from $20-50 a person.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "description": "I've been to La Mar a few times; the first two times with my Peruvian girls who took my Peruvian palate to another level here. \nThe first two times, we went there for dinner; made a reservation in advance and got a table next to the water. \nEach of us ordered Pisco Sour, Chicha drink, and Inca Cola. \nInca Cola was just like those canned ones you can pick up from Target, Chicha drink was not as impressive as the one I usually got from Destino but Pisco Sour here is the strongest I've ever had (amongst Destino, Pacific Catch, and Limon). \nFor food, we got Causa with crab meat, Ceviche Mixto, Ceviche Classic, and Lomo Saltado. \nA  delicate restaurant version of ceviche and lomo saltado is something I have been very familiar with and Lamar didn't disappoint me even for a tiny bit. Causa here looked pretty and far more appetizing than what my friends usually cooked for me but it was a shame that every causa I got from here was always too salty; probably from the brininess of the crab meat on top. \nThose first two times cost us quite around $200's which was a bit expensive for a party of three small girls of which stomachs were not even half full. \n\nSo a few days ago, I decided to go there again with my bf and my girl, both of whom have a very tiny appetite. We were there for a happy hour hangout.\nThis time we got 2 Cristal beer, 3 pisco sour, 1 pisco punch, 1 chicha cocktail, 1 prickly pear margarita. \nPisco sour was strong as usualy, pisco punch was wy too sweet, chicha cocktail was not as god as what I got from Destino, and the pear margarita was a bit too fruity for me. \nFor food, we basically ordered everything on the Happy Hour menu. \nCeviche were both good, as usual. Mussels were a bit bland, probably because the juice in ceviche was far stronger than that of the mussels dish. Causa was salty as usual. Mehhh! Fried Calamari was the star of the meal! Very very very good! My mouth is still drooling as I write this review. The pork Belly sandwich was very very good as well. The empanadas were average; I guess you can't really screw up empanadas. (Except one African restaurant in mission, which I I'll be writing about it later in upcoming reviews). \nAt the end of the meal, the magic piece of paper arrived with $123 written on it before tip. Given all the food and drinks us three got, it was a much better deal comparing to the price of my first two dinners with my girls. \nAll in all, if you wanna go try variety of peruvian bites and cheaper drink, Happy Hour is a way to go. However, if you think about taking a girl out on a date, make a reservation and go for a dinner with a romantic sunset view next to the window. Happy Hour there is always packed with drunk people who just get off from work in FiDi; more of a better scenario for a friend hangout or an old married couple who dont want to hear each other talking, and not a romantic first date.", "author": "Joelle K."}

Getting a table on the patio had to be reserved and requested weeks in advance, so we sat inside. I was a little disappointed (as I always am) by the casual nature of the patrons.  Men in shorts... at an expensive restaurant... on a Friday night. Why? I just don't get it. So that was annoying, though not the restaurant's fault.\n\nWe ordered 8 dishes (which we anticipated would be way too much food), all of them communal for the table.  75% of them were things I would not eat, however I tried not to look like a total weirdo in front of the boss and his wife, so I tried everything anyway. I kind of faked it -- I tried all the non-fishy things that were in the ceviches and the empanadas. It wasn't easy because there was a lot of squid, octopus, and other raw sea creatures hanging out in each bowl. That said, it all was freaking delicious.  The sauces were incredible. \n\nOf the items I ate in entirety, the chicken empanadas were soooooooooo good.  And the coconut salmon entree was superb.  My tablemates were wary about trying the more ordinary dishes (like salmon and chicken), but there were no regrets.  And there were no leftovers. That tells you something.\n\nOne more tidbit: the ladies' restroom is a historical landmark. Fancy that!", "author": "Love Z."}

You can imagine, based on my extensive knowledgable of the aforementioned subject, I was delighted to indulge luxuriously in some various delectable melodies fit for Inca kings. \n\nI enter this place and the foyer is confusing as shit with some sign that says \"Please wait to be seated\". Word? Why would I do that when I know exactly where I want to be seated, which is outback next to the bay. So I start walking back and some guy with spiky hair and orange suspenders stops me. Man, this dudes hair looked like it belonged on an 8thgraders head on yearbook picture day. The smell of this dudes hair was appalling. This dude probably gets his gel out of a gigantic blue vat that says  \"super-extra-all-day-strength-hold\" and has a picture of a parachute and skateboard on it. Then this mother fucker has the nerve to put on orange suspenders. Man, suspenders don't belong on a camel, let alone a man. Unless you're in some photo shoot for GQ and like 9 professional designer people are like \"Ey, where this shit.\", you should NEVER wear them shits. I almost had the girl I was with ask this dude to take off his suspenders and hand them to her so I could snatch them out of her hand and choke the shit out of him with his own bad decision. There should be a TV show called America's Top Fashion Police and its just me, Adriana Lima, and Bar Rafaeli shooting people with paintballs and rubber bullets who are wearing suspenders, top hats, and fingerless gloves. \n\nThe service at this place is whack. I asked to be put outside and then they said no and I immediately snarled and responded, \"The hell I ain't! Boss up!\" and THEN they put me outside. C'mon, man. You know I'm Mr. Banana hands M.D. don't make me ask twice, I will get mine, whatever I want, regardless! (Pro Tip: You can get anything you want if you just say, \"Fuck that, boss up!\" and clench your fists.)\n\nI ordered salmon and steak, which were $20 a piece, and was like, damn I feel like a king about to have a victory feast. But naw player. They served me my plates and the shits was just 6 pieces of meat on two different skewers served on top of hash browns. Now, I know they will deny that what you're eating is a hash brown but I've seen enough homeless people hit up the Mcdonalds breakfast menu and walk away with hash browns to know what they be. Man the small portion size for the price was just stupid-doo-doo-dumb. I don't give a damn about money, but when I spend it I better get what I expect. I spent $40 and this place hand delivered me something fit for a cat. In fact, I've seen my buddy feed his cat with larger portions than what this place was feeding me, and his fat pussy ate the whole damn thing. \n\n6pieces of meat!? Hair gel and suspenders!?

They have a new chef, and the manager listened to constructive feedback about the lousy job.  He said he would ask the chef (right..) and then disappeared.\n\nWhat has changed is a confusing mess.  The sauces now blend in non-Peruvian ingredients (Jalape\u00f1os? There's not enough peppers from Peru?)  --- the causas are piped on to a plate instead of being in traditional towers -- and the pollo saltado was heavy on vegetables and had precisely three nugget-sized pieces of chicken.\n\nI've visited Peru enough times (and stayed with Peruvians) -- there's so many amazing flavors and culture.  They aren't being represented here, and that's a shame.  Pottery from China for plates.  Uninspiring presentation with non-Peruvian garnish.  Cebiche with poor acidity.\n\nThis is Peruvian fusion.  If that's what you want to be, fine, but call it that and not something else.  It's apparent Gaston Acurio hasn't learned why his New York establishment closed.  Charging for upscale is fine.  Being something you aren't usually leads nowhere.\n\nWe didn't eat dessert.  We got stuck on the left side of the menu and couldn't make it to the right side.  Illy has been replaced with a North Bay tea and coffee company.  Again, where's the imagination?  You can get Peruvian coffees and teas?  (In full disclosure, that company does import a Peruvian coffee but they failed to mention it on the menu... Who knows what they serve.) \n\nYou can get more authentic Peruvian from one of the many smaller restaurants in North Bay (some in strip malls) run by families.  My advice:  go there first, then compare.\n\n(You could always tweet Gaston about the experience, has two in my party did-- but the person whom manages his social media account just blocks people that say anything constructive.)

Seeing as we came in without reservations, they were only able to seat us at the ceviche bar. Totally understandable, of course. The dining room looked gorgeous though!\n\nI'll preface this review by saying that all of my Peruvian food experiences prior to this one have been in small, mom-and-pop kind of environments. So it was definitely a change to see the cuisine dressed up all fancy, and not necessarily a good change. \n\nWe ordered the Causas sampler, which was something new for me. I thought they were all really tasty and very different from one another, but my favorite was the one topped with tuna. Not anything I'll be pining for again in the future, but I did thorougly enjoy it. \n\nCeviche Clasico - I'll always be happy when you put ceviche in front of me. That being said, the ceviche here was good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe also ordered the Lomo Saltado. Before coming to this restaurant, I already had a love for the lomo saltado I've had at the aforementioned mom-and-pop places in LA. So while I did think the Lomo Saltado here was excellent, I can't justify it's price. $32 for this dish? When I know I've had the same quality dish (in a less fancy environment) for a fraction of the price? If you've never had it and wanna try it here, you won't be disappointed. Your wallet might be though. \n\nWe also ordered a mixed seafood with rice dish, the name of which is escaping me. Also very good, but pricey.\n\nOverall, the food and ambiance would give this place a 4 star rating. However, with the sky high pricing on food I know I can get elsewhere for much cheaper knocks it down a star. For that reason alone I most likely won't be coming back.", "author": "Sally T."}

It's a fairly large menu which he did not explain to us at all, so we needed some time to review, and again he seemed irritated by that. \n\nI ordered the \"sushi rolls\" which were pretty good. The fish part was very good, but it came with what seemed to be thousand island on top which was not listed in the description and I scraped off.\n\nBack to the service, most of us ordered just 1 dish but one person ordered the tasting menu which was so badly timed it was almost comical. Granted it was not an ideal situation, but he finished his bite-sized first course while we were all just getting started on our food, and then didn't get his second course until well after we had all finished ours and two reminders to our waiter later.\n\nIt was reasonable for a \"fancy lunch\", about $20 per person, but I would not rush back given the service.

Loved this little appetizer. But I love crab & avocado so that made it really easy to like\nCebiche Mixto - Catch of the day, calamari and shrimp. It was reallllllllllly tangy. A little too tangy for my taste but if you're into that, you might like this. \nLomo Saltado - One of their popular dishes and this was probably my favorite.

And I wanted to have a great dinner in a recommended place as La Mar...but I ended up so disappointed of my choice! \n\nFirst, I have to say that every time that I look for a place to eat I use Yelp. Maybe I'm not doing reviews but I really trust in this website and previous experiences! And for La Mar I should trust more in those bad reviews because some of them are very accurate!\n\nNow I'll try to sum up the worst experience that I ever had in a restaurant since I moved to San Francisco:\n1- I did a reservation specifying that I wanted to be seated at the patio (waterfront). I also called to La Mar 2 days before to be very clear about this. What happened? We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, not the patio, and when I asked about my request, the hostess was very rude saying that there is no guarantee about that and if we want the patio we had to wait 45 min, So...Ok, we took the table inside.\n2- 5 minutes later they put us in a table at the patio and when we went outside they had so many reserved empty tables! I did a reservation too!!\n3- Besides this we wanted to have a great time so Ok, we ordered 2 pisco drinks and they NEVER came to our table. \n4- they never did the water refill to our glasses. \n5- They did a discount in our check, but...honestly, I was so disappointed of choosing that place to celebrate an important event that the discount is nothing compare to how embarrassed I was.\n\nThose 2 starts are just for the food, we had cebiche Classico, a Nikkei plate and a vegetarian causa and all of them were Amazing! Really really good! I think that they spend money in good chefs and not in good service.\n\nRemember, people go to your restaurant the first time because of the food, but they go back because of the hospitality!

A little too fast sometimes though, was still eating the corn off my plate, and had two wait staff ask if I was ready to take it away. They also cleaned off my area of the bar, and took my table cloth, even though I was still eating chips. Can't complain if that keeps the crowded restaurant clean though.\n\nit is on the pricey side, but for a waterfront restaurant, that's normal. And trust me, you don't want or need bigger portions.

It's a nice location, with interesting furniture, really cool flower displays, and superstar chef creations (at least to me).\nBut I have to say our recent visit to La Mar was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had.  Not just in SF, but across the globe.\n\nThe waiter was a big part of it.  He was disinterested, rude, and towards the end downright scary - like if I weren't already trapped in the restaurant for 3 hours, we would have spoken with the management if it seemed like it would have mattered.\nThe second thing that jumped out at me was the smell of fish at the main dining area (I'd recommend sitting outside).  You know how sometimes there is a good fish smell and a bad fish smell?  this was the bad side.\n\nThe graphic design of the menus was really cool - I loved the colors.  Pisco sours were also good - as was the steak option mixed with vegetables.  I wasn't a fan of the empanadas but I know that others in our group liked them.  Nothing jumped out as spectacular though - and you kind of think you'll get something like that with the location and prices being charged.\n\nThe dessert was the brightest spot for me.  We had the special which had a small bit of ice cream with a wafer and a few other interesting ingredients that were creatively placed on the plate.  I am a big fan of small plates and appropriately sized portions (many places have portions that are far too big).  But this was on the other end of the scale when price was taken into consideration.\n\nWhat I would tell friends about this place is that you'd probably be better off just about anywhere in the city.  If you want an intimate restaurant, wonderful view, good value, and friendly staff, this isn't the place.  \n\nOur experience at this restaurant, early in a week long trip to San Francisco, made me wonder if the time has come and gone for San Francisco restaurant scene.

I had the mixed ceviche and the yucca fries off the happy hour menu and the grilled octopus dinner.\n\nThe mixed ceviche was not a winner; the squid was OK but the shrimp was pasty and flavorless and the fish the bartender told me would be halibut was definitely not halibut. I think it was yellowtail, which is great but frankly the sauce and seasoning made it so I couldn't really taste the fish.\n\nThe yucca fries were very tasty at first but they weren't peeled enough and I got a mouthful of what tastes like floury dental floss with every bite. Not nice and I had to pick it out of my teeth at the bar. Glad I wasn't on a date.\n\nThe grilled octopus itself was very good. The texture was just right and the seasoning was great.\n\nOne thing I don't get is the hominy in everything. When it's just boiled and served cold, like it was in the ceviche it just tastes bland and once again, pasty. When they fry it they turn into hard oily plastic bits. I couldn't find a reason to eat them. I kept thinking I would never put something like that on a plate and expecting a guest to like it.\n\nI will say that despite being very crowded the service was generally fast and very nice. The bar tenders were running like crazy but managed to so with a smile. \n\nMy dinner cost $45 including tax and tip (no alcohol, salad or dessert) and while it was a bit pricey the location is perfect and the building is very nice.

A mid-week lunch becomes a Peruvian escape, especially when the sun peaks through the SF fog and shines its beams through the many windows and brightens up the entire place. I honestly did feel like my sense of well-being was restored. \n\nOn to the food. Let's start with the home-made chips. They are seasoned with crack I swear. There were different varieties of potatoes and plantains and 3 different dipping sauces that we couldn't stop munching on. \n\nWe started with the cebiche tasting.  Out of the 4, the Mixto (Mahi Mahi with squid and octopus) was our least favorite but it was still actually really good which tells you how much we enjoyed it. The standouts on the platter were the chifa (\"chinese\" style mahi mahi) and the cl\u00e1sico (halibut). The seafood was so fresh and the flavors were simply bright and delightful - absolute joy to eat. \n\nNext up were the empanada sampler and the causa sampler. Let's start with the empanadas. Wonderfully flaky pastry encasing delightful fillings. The chicken, beef, and seafood empanadas were delicious but wait till you bite into the one with the corn. Maybe it's the freshness of the produce but while it looks modest, it comes alive in your mouth. \n\nThe Causas were little pieces of art. I appreciated all the intricate work that went into each mound of whipped potatoes and the toppings. Unfortunately, it went in a hurry. 3 bites later and it was gone; hardly fair considering the amount of work that went into it. \n\nWash all this down with a Pisco sour and close your eyes for a second while the staff clear your plates and bring you the check in their heavy latin american accents.

It's one of the most delicious and versatile cuisines in the world offering something for everyone--the vegetarian, the meat and potatoes guy, the steak lover, the pescatarian, the spice lover, etc. I personally prefer more hole-in-the-wall Peruvian restaurants, but every once in a while, it's nice to dress up and go somewhere glamorous and upscale to get my ceviche and Pisco Sour fix. \n\nLa Mar is great for a date night or a night out with the girls. The menu offers some of the country's best and most well-known dishes, balanced out with more daring and inventive creations. As a general rule, I usually order the tried-and-true the first time I'm at a Peruvian restaurant because that's how I judge its quality and authenticity. \n\nMy Pisco Sour was frothy, sharp and delicious, but it could have been a bit sweeter (the Pisco Sours I had in Peru always had a sweet touch--usually the addition of nutmeg or cinnamon). My friend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes and ordered:\n\nAnticucho Carne - An oldie but a goodie. The meat was perfectly grilled and came out slightly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The seasoning was fantastic and the accompanying potatoes were delicious. A satisfying, hearty dish\n\nCeviche Clasico - Classic ceviche usually features an assortment of white fish (and sometimes other seafood), so I was a little disappointed that La Mar's only had one kind (halibut) at the shocking price of $17. It was done well and the cuts were generous, but I don't think it's a very good deal overall. The leche de tigre, while tangy, had far too much pepper (???) and not enough garlic\n\nMushroom Empanada - Crisp and delicious\n\nDungeness Crab Causas - The presentation was beautiful and the causas had just the right texture. However, I found the aji amarillo incredibly disappointing. It was missing that flavor kick I'm used to\n\nQueso Helado - Peru's answer to kulfi or gelato, this delicious, creamy dessert originating from Arequipa is one of my favorite kinds of ice-cream. La Mar's is quite good\n\nChoco-Maracuya - How can you resist edible 24K gold? This was very well made, but by this point, I was stuffed so my friend ended up finishing most of it. Worth ordering if you're going to split it with someone\n\nOverall, I think La Mar is a great place to go for Peruvian newbies and those less gastronomically adventurous.

It's a real Peruvian food heaven hidden from the stream of people going past the various piers. It is such an amazing food experience. I love everything about it... food, atmosphere, music, service, view, colors, presentation.\n\nThe menu is very  imaginative. La Mar is a little pricey for the portions but the flavors make up for it.  The plaintain chips with dipping sauce are a nice way to start your meal! Delicious!\n\nUsually my husband and I order few dishes to share and each time it's just amazing. You can't go wrong with anything there. But we really recommend to try empanada sampler ($19) and any of the cebiches ($12 - $15). Just yummy!\n\nThey also have an outstanding menu for cocktails. You always can ask a waiter for a special drink (alcoholic and non-alcoholic ) and they will create something interesting and unuusual out of their head. \n\nThe only negative thing about this place is that sometimes they bring the dishes not in order you ordered them which can be a little annoying. Last time we asked why it happens. Apperently some dishes are ready to go and some need more time for preperation so if you want your orders be delivered to your table in order ask the waiter to do so.\n\nAnd if you are a fan of sushi, you'll love it there even more! You just must try one of their rollitos (Japanese inspired sushi rolls made with Peru's finest ingredients ($12) ). Last time we tried rollitos with onion salad on top of it. Fantastic!\n\nCheck some photos on my blog: http://www.nadyassideoftheroad.com/2012/08/la-mar-peruvian-heaven.html", "author": "Nadya Z."}

We sat there with menus for 10 minutes while we watched tables all around being served. We were never greeted but the waiter who appeared that he might be our waiter said he'd be right with us when we motioned for help. He never introduced himself to us, never came to take our drink order, never apologized (that perhaps he was too busy with other tables) -- all the usual, customary things that one would expect from a waiter when dining out, we got the opposite of that. \n\nWe watched painfully as he worked the tables all around us, obviously ignoring us for whatever reason. Then it seemed like he was calling someone over -- that person came to our table and asked if he could take our drink order. We gave him our drink order and he went over to the table behind us to answer questions about the menu for 5 minutes or so. We motioned for him because, well, we might as well order appetizers while we were waiting. So we put in an order in for their famous Cebiche La Mar. At that point in time he said we'd have to remind him about our drink order because clearly he hadn't put the order in and had forgotten it while he waited on the table behind us.\n\nKeep in mind that no one has introduced themselves to us at any point in time. We should expect better service than this from Denny's.\n\nThe drinks and ceviche arrived but the ceviche was unacceptably bland. Normally, ceviche is marinated for some time. The highly touted Cebiche Lar Mar tasted like the fish was mixed in the marinade right before it was served.\n\nWe had already spoken to the maitre'd about this issue on the way out so this should not be any surprise.\n\nWe had already spent $66 on an appetizer and 2 drinks that were obviously not worth it.  We weren't going to spend anymore money at a restaurant that is unfamiliar with how to treat customers.", "author": "Spicy T."}

The space is definitely worthy of five stars as it has high ceilings, white walls and medium dark hardwood floors.   The setup is good for intimate conversation as nothing is crammed together.   We were seated adjacent to the open kitchen and enjoyed the view, both around the restaurant and across the table (at each other of course). \nI asked the bar tender to whip me up a non alcoholic cocktail that was flavorful.  \nThe Causa Tasting was too pretty to eat until our waiter showed us how to mash them for guilt free consumption. The vegetarian (Causa Rusa) was my favorite which is an added bonus considering meat is murder. That said,  we thoroughly enjoyed consuming fish (in our Cebiche) while it still exists in the oceans.  The Halibut  (Cebiche Clasico) was spot on. The Cebiche Chifa was a bit too spicy for me, but my date loved it.  Shy Northern European who loves spicy food? Spicy ethnic girl who wouldn't mind it slightly less so?   Go figure.\nWe walked around the Embarcadero, North Beach and FIDI for about an hour and half afterward.

You were the best.  You made it very clear that we were your favorite guests in the whole restaurant.  You made trip after trip to drop off appetizers, more appetizers, and more snackies during the cocktail party mixer we attended Aug 26.  You were tireless, witty, and fun.  You even did the legwork to make sure our table was ready when our reservation time came.  \n\nWe made a later reservation for the restaurant, to which we adjourned after leaving the mixer.  Nick turned us over to our new server, who was terrific, but wasn't Nick.\n\nNow for the food.  My friends think I'm the most amazing restaurant filter in California, and this place just blew them away.  Your menu and service made me look incredibly smart, educated, and refined.  In reality this is not necessarily the case - but you wouldn't know it by my choice of restaurants.\n\nWe shared ceviche, they had a couple of entrees, and we all had the wine and pisco sours.  The plantain & sweet potato chips were fantastic - a wonderful bit of starch to counter the pure protein of the ceviche.  The tiger milk sampler was really tasty, as were all the various ceviches in the sampler we shared.\n\nAll in all we had a terrific time.

Pisco Sour is good (but too pricey), i can make one even better (using the same Barsol pisco). Sweet potatos are insanely goooood. Lomo Saltado and pisco sour are the only things that can make you feel like eating in Peru, everything else is good in general but not as a real peruvian food.\n\nThe BAD: Pricey. If you are going just for Cebiche, there's other places where you can find it for less, more quantity and same quality.\n\nThe UGLY: Americanized peruvian food. Its so weird that a peruvian restaurant from the most famous peruvian chef (Gaston Acurio), doesn't have \"Aji de Gallina\" and other typical peruvian dishes in the menu. And i can`t believe that Dessert Menu (selected by Gaston's wife) does not included \"Suspiro Lime\u00f1o\"!! COME ON!!, instead you can have a Creme Brulee, which is really good, but is a americanized version because taste like Burnt Caramel (a flavor no so common in South American cuisine), other good ones are choco-maracuya (another not-peruvian dessert) and pannacotta.", "author": "Gio S."}

The ambience is very South American, with bright blue woven chairs and Latin music in the background. The tables outside have a gorgeous view of the ocean, but since we came at night we opted to sit inside. Our server was extremely helpful and knowledgable about what each sauce contained and how each dish was prepared, so don't be afraid to ask! The specialty appetizer, as the name might imply, is the ceviche, a classic Peruvian seafood dish served cold, and often with raw fish. We had the tuna ceviche with tamarind sauce, and I wish we had ordered another because it was so flavorful. For our dinner, we shared a grilled halibut fillet that came out on the bone, so we had to cut it out ourselves. The only precaution here is the small bones can get caught in your teeth so it's good to watch out for that. The fish was served with a really nice spicy sauce that added all the more flavor, as well as an absolutely mouthwatering quinoa. I don't know how they seasoned it, but the more you ate the more you wanted. The menu said the halibut was for 2 people, but we shared it amongst 3 and were full. We also ordered the empanada sampler (beef, chicken, shrimp, vegetarian) and those were so crisp and well cooked without a lot of oil. Definitely regret not taking any photos of the food because I completely forgot, but their presentation was nice and clean as well. Will definitely be back here as soon as I can!

Overall the meal was OK but the reason why I'm giving the extra star is for the fill-me-up-with-another empanadas. So delicious. But let's rewind.\n\nDate: Sunday - 1p - DAT\n\nOptions: 2 choices - Option 1 came with the cebiche mixto (yellowtail, calamari, shrimp in an aji amarillo leche de tigre with cilantro, red onion, habanero, peruvian corn and yam), carne (grilled skirt steak, potatoes, peruvian corn, spicy rocoto sauce), and the pie de limon (lime cream, lime mousse, lime sorbet, italian meringue w/ an almond crunch). Option 2 was the vegetarian option and had a basic green salad, quinoa stir fry and a duo of sorbets. The regular menu looked so delicious that we had to order a few more appetizers - cebiche nikei (Tombo Tuna, red onion, Japanese cucumber, daikon, and avocado in a tamarind leche de tigre) and de tamalito verde (sweet corn, cilantro, and queso fresco, salsa criolla and Huancaina Rocoto sauce). Instead of chips and salsa, there were yucca and fried plantains with two different sauces.\n\nRating: The empanada was the favourite thing we ate. I honestly would have been happy just having that for my DAT. Along with the yucca and fried plantain chips. Both cebiches were fresh and seasoned very well but the portions were very small and it didn't feel like we got a lot of the main proteins. The grilled skirt stake was a little overcooked but again still very well seasoned. The quinoa was tasty but I've had that prepared that exact way at another restaurant so not very original. \n\nService: Friendly and attentive. We never felt ignored and the waiter was helpful in answering our questions about portions and drinks.\n\nWith tip, DAT, additional appetizers, and 2 drinks, we spent ~$110. Yes, quite pricey for a Sunday lunch and for DAT where you're normally expecting not to spend very much. But, I'd honestly go back just to get my hands on more of the different types of empanadas. :)", "author": "Janelle C."}

Ordered 3 course menu for two people. Pros: the place has a nice interior and view of the pier, excellent serving, decent appetizer and very nice dessert. Cons: in open table it was advertised as romantic with price range $31 to $51, however the ambience is more like a bar, the seating for two is pretty separated, and we ended up paying $70 before tip per person. I guess I can understand the high price for special three course menu. However, the main entree is very, very disappointing. We ordered lomo saltado and sea bass special menu, the lomo saltado is way too salty, and the sea bass entree is just a piece of bland and tough fish meat with two piece of bokchoi. Finally, the restroom is a mess, it seems there is nobody taking care of that.", "author": "Yosia U."}

I probably wouldn't return here, but it is an experience, mainly for the causas and the waterfront environment. \n\n-Cebiche Mixto - Yellowtail, calamari and shrimp with peruvian corn and yam. I actually prefer more acidy ceviche, but this was solid with really good ingredients. \n\n- Causa Tasting - Comes with Limena(crab), Nikei(tuna), Vegetariana.  Crab and tuna were both really good, don't even bother with vegetarian unless you are actually vegetarian. \n\n- Lomo Saltado - Really really good, a bit on the salty side and definitely very expensive for a lomo saltado at $32. The meat was super soft and the fries are thick steak fries. While I enjoyed this, i actually prefer the cheaper version with cheap fries. \n\nThey have happy hour every day (even on weekends) which is good.

I loved that they never rush us to leave (we ended up staying there almost 3 hours!) \n\nWe started our afternoon with the signature Pisco Sour and my only suggestion is to not let it sit for too long. I nursed mine for the whole meal and the taste wasn't too good at the end. Then again, nothing really taste as good when sitting for too long.\n\nActually came here for Dine About Town, but did not order anything from the special menu since we didn't feel that the menu gave a good representation of the restaurant. We went along with the Cebiche Tasting and Causa Tasting for the dishes. It was actually very filling and took us the whole 2.5 hours to eat (we liked talking and distractions...) Both dishes were delicious. Cebiche was packed with flavor and I definitely appreciated our waiter's suggestion to use spoons. It was a completely different experience and I will use it for all cebiche tastings in the future. I love mashed potato, so the texture of the causas were good and tasty.\n\nWe ordered the Copon de Lychee and Sorbetes Caseros for dessert. I probably made a wrong choice in the lychee since they drenched my lychee sorbet under a big pile of fluffy pisco foam. Taste was interesting, but the fact that I was still nursing my pisco sour, it didn't mix too well and gave me slight shudders. The sorbets were ultra yummy though!\n\nOverall, I love this place!

I was excited to see that the civiche and pisco sour were on the 7 x 7 Big Eat!\n\nHere's what we had:\n\nChicha Morada: A purple drink made from corn, pineapple and spices (I could really taste the cinnamon).  Although it has pineapple which you think would give it a tropical twist, it was warm and spicy.

All were extremely fresh tasting and it seemed like a lot of thought went into which marinade paired with what fish.  The mixto was good, I just have to get past the octopus suction cups staring at me.  My least favorite was the chifa mainly because I am not fond of the Asian inspired marinade. \n\nCausa Casera: This is probably one of the coolest looking dished I've ever had. The presentation was great with the mashed purple potatoes topped with the lime green confit.  The texture of the potatoes did remind me of playdo...so it was a texture issue here.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=bqOYd2bDOTYucIGJL-6U1A\n\nAnticuchos de Pollo:  The chicken was phenomenal.  The sauce they marinade in it was reminiscent of an old school bbq sauce and I think there may have been smoked paprika in it.  The Peruvian corn kernels were massive!  Beware of the salsa panchita....its flaming hot!  I am typically not a wimp when it comes to spicy things, but I downed 4 glasses of water and my mouth still tingled. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=HIxEdElIk-n3ynI7tDxgOQ\n\nThe ambiance here is a little stark and cold...but the food far outweighs this negative.

The chifa was too spicy, it killed your palate for the other 3 cebiches.  The chifa in Peru, in contrast, is really mild, so I was surprised by the spice. \n\nThe Empanada Sampler:  4 of empanadas, really fresh, but pretty small ones (big enough for an entree for 1 person, or apps for 3/4).  I really liked the beef one.  The mushroom was unusual/not traditional, but still really good. \n\nMy friend loved the pescado nikei (sea bass with a side of fried rice), but I thought the fish was 30 seconds over cooked.  (A very minor point.)  \n\nThe only way they fell short was on the coffee and desserts.  I had a latte, which was served in a tall glass (unusual for coffee-centric SF).  We also had the picarones (skip the sauce that they pour on top because they become to sweet) and the chocomaracuya (passionfruit, chocolate mousse) which was good (but still a little too sweet for me, needs more tart to balance the flavors). \n\np.s. -- You can rent the patio as an event space!

Very spacious, and lots of blue and white colors to give it a nautical theme (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=u05xVIAb6Ky7aZaDomZt_A).\n\nWe were met by our waiter, Alejo, who gave a brief over view of the menu, and took our drink orders.  Soon after, another server served us a basket of fried plantains and dipping sauces:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=8esAZmuk2o8kXcQ3D4bNpQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=3SqSA1403hdWPK0eMFcI5Q\n\nOur Order:\n-CEBICHE TASTING (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=on5F44B_WKIF1LFFng56ug):\n--Cl\u00e1sico: Halibut in leche de tigre with red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam\n--Mixto: Yellowtail, calamari and shrimp in an aj\u00ed amarillo leche de tigre, cilantro, red onion, habanero with Peruvian corn and yam\n--Chalaco:  Yellowtail, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, red onion, cilantro and cancha in a rocoto leche de tigre topped with fried calamari\n--Nikei: Tombo Tuna, red onion, Japanese Cucumber, daikon, avocado, nori, and sesame in a tamarind leche de tigre\nThe fish was very fresh, and each cebiche was very refreshing.  Each had a unique taste with varying degrees of spicy boldness, or refreshing brightness of the citrus.  The Nikei had a very distinctive Asian taste to it, reminding me of poke.\n\n-CAUSA TASTING (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=SSmysmgWtTZLPHiO5i3Hwg):\n--Lime\u00f1a:  Dungeness Crab on top of a yellow potato with avocado pur\u00e9e, quail egg, cherry tomatoes, aj\u00ed amarillo Huanca\u00edna sauce and basil cilantro oil\n--Saltadito: fish, shrimp, calamari, red onion and tomatoes on top of purple potato with a soy-oyster reduction, lomo saltado aioli and crispy onion rings\n--Nikei: Ahi Tuna tartar and avocado pur\u00e9e on top of purple potato with rocoto Huanca\u00edna sauce topped with Japanese nori\n--Casera: Yellow potato, artichokes, asparagus, avocado and tomato confit with basil cilantro oil\nI was quite surprise how light and fluffy were the potatoes.  Not dense like mashed potatoes.  Very colorful presentation, and as with the cebiche sampler, each causa had its own unique taste and texture.\n\n-ENSALADA TIRADITO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=owE8cIb4zk7gIJCzsm04Lw): Thinly sliced Tombo Tuna with mixed greens, green papaya, cilantro, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, fried wontons and onions with a sesame passionfruit vinaigrette.  Nicely presented and colorful.  The vinaigrette was a nice complement to the tuna.\n\n-ARROZ JUGOSO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=T9Ke5Nm80ZL3B3jcmmHhQQ): Prawns, clams, mussels, calamari, octopus, white fish and vegetables in a juicy arborio rice with a blend of Peruvian ajis  served with rocoto aioli and toasted bread  A very hearty, rich, and bold rice dish.  Nicely spiced, but not overly spicy.  Aioli served on the side gave the dish a slightly creamy texture.\n\nToo full from desert, but we couldn't leave this place without having one.  We shared:\n-TAPIOCA de MARACUY\u00c0 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qbr2JG96K6d31NqqAUxf9g?select=jums33uR2nt7-hRMny5YkA): Chocolate mousse, coconut cream, passion fruit sorbet, coconut foam and\npassion fruit tapioca.  Tart, cool, creamy and refreshing.\n\nOur server was very knowledgeable of the menu, and the wine list, and recommended a nice glass of ameztoi txakolina to go with my arroz.  The wait and bus staff were very efficient serving our courses, and clearing the plates when done.\n\nWe may be a bit biased because we had a dinner date without the kids, but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and would be back again.", "author": "Steve L."}

For starters, make a reservation. It's highly recommended because it's packed every day of the week. I made my reservation about a month in advance - probably didn't need to make it that planned out but wanted to make sure I got the time I wanted. Also, if the weather is nice, sit outside. The first time I came here, it was one of those SF summer days, so our table outside was beautiful overlooking the water.\n\nFor drinks, we tried a bunch of signature cocktails on the menu, all highly recommended. I got the Capitan because I'm a gin fan- it was a bit small, but tasty. They make some tasty vodka gimlets too. Foodwise, we got the ceviche sample, the empanada sampler, and the grilled salmon. They also give complimentary chips and two sauces- the orange one was so yummy that was asked for more. All the food we got was great- everything was super shareable between the three of us. The only thing I didn't like was one of the empanadas - it was the one with mushrooms in it. It was too mushroomy and I just wasn't totally feelin it. \n\nThe atmosphere is very pretty- every table has bright tableclothes and I felt like I was under the sea or something! I feel like lots of business people come here for business dinners, so make sure you dress nicely. It's definitely pricey so be prepared to shell out some cash. For 6 drinks, the ceviche sampler, the empanada sampler, and the grilled salmon, our bill came out to $175 without tip. I'd totally go back again!!", "author": "Priya G."}

Given the situation (fire alarm and all), many patrons had already left, so I would have expected the restaurant to not be as busy, and much quicker to serve our food.  On top of that, they had gotten our order wrong, and had completely forgotten to put an order for a dish.  \n\nIn terms of the food, I was a big fan of the causa sampler..different types of seafood with whipped potato and sauces.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste was just as impressive.  We also tried the Cebiche sampler..I didn't get to try very much of it as it was split amongst 5 hungry girls, but the tuna poke that was in the dish was probably the best that I'd ever had.  I am sure that there are tons of other good dishes served here as well, but the Causa Sampler is something that I would recommend to get as an appetizer.  In addition to that, complimentary plaintain chips are served with two types of cheese sauces...the orange colored sauce is more spicy, while the yellow sauce was more cheesy.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was clean, spacious, and modern looking.  However, the number of bathrooms in the building is lacking.

Highly Recommended!\n\nThen we sampled all of their causas by ordering the causa tasting.\nMy favorite here was the causa camar\u00f3n, a sweet and spicy poached shrimp and fried onions on top of Rocoto potato with leche de tigre aioli. Great stuff!\n\nFor main dish we had the Grilled Fish Skewers with fried potatoes, Peruvian corn, \nspicy panchita and rocoto sauce. The fish was perfectly grilled.\n\nGreat food and excellent service. \nThanks to Tobias for all the recommendations!\n\nI have to visit the New York La Mar and compare the food.", "author": "Michael A."}

The bar could be a very fun place with good drinks; however, you should get there before the crowd (perhaps around 3:30 p.m.) and in time to take advantage of Happy Hour (4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m., I believe).  Of course, I usually never get here before the crowd, so I have managed to actually find a seat once.  I always miss Happy Hour, so my drinks are usually around $15.00 each (Margarita with Milagro tequila).  Finally, this place is really loud - so it is hard to have group conversations.  However, aside from the crowd, the noise, the inability to find a seat and the high priced drinks, they do make a great margarita and have wonderful ceviche.", "author": "Theresa C."}

Try saying La Mar fast, it sounds like an NBA player. I love ceviche and besides, it's one of the last things I'd want to eat before my death, according to my profile.\n\nParking is easy and there is a parking structure across the street. To keep their patrons busy from wondering where in the world the entrees are, they provide you complimentary plantains and chips with three different colored dips. This was fun to munch on but it didn't last long until we really started questioning where our server disappeared to. Hellooo out thereeeee?\n\nService is extremely slow. I wish I could blame it on Restaurant Week, but it was lunch and it didn't look THAT busy. I told my table I'd go back there and help them myself.  This lunch stretched out to another unnecessary hour and half or so. Need I remind you, time is parking and parking is money.\n\nBased on Restaurant Week's specials, we had a menu tasting, this included: lomo saltado, ceviche halibut, dessert in a bigger-than-average shot glass. The beef in the lomo saltado was dry and bland. For appetizers we ordered a few more seafood items to share, stir fry with calamari and shellfish, assorted cebiches and causas. The best items were the cebiches and causas, pretty presentation, tasty and fresh, but portions are small, we shared with a table of 5 people, I wanted more of this. \n\nCall me impatient but the food is not worth the wait, especially if there were only a couple stand-out items. I love the eye popping turquoise splashed all over the place. It's a spacious sunny restaurant with an unbeatable location, ON the Embarcadero, on the Pacific Ocean.

When I averaged it in I came up with a generous two.  We showed up long before start time and the best seat they'd give us was at the \"Cebiche\" bar. Apparently they were saving all those wonderful seats near the water for much more important people who never seemed to arrive.  We didn't really care about that, honestly, we always sit at the sushi bar,  but when you add very pricey poor quality food the weight of the whole experience grinds on you.  I had the \"White Tuna Tiradito.\"  I'm a big sashimi fan and I know my fish pretty well.  Supposedly La Mar White Tuna is \"Japanese Style,\" but I've never had my wonderful sashimi ruined by a thick, yellow, over flavored gooey sauce.  I checked out my wife's \"Cebiche\" which included salmon, shrimp and avocado.  Somehow they ruined that too. I prefer to call it \"Ceviche,\" and I've eaten it up and down the coastline cities of Peru.  It's always bathed in something light and lemony. It's not hard to prepare.  Fresh fish.  Throw in something citrusy, onions, whatever...keep it light, make it feel fresh...that's the way to go.  La Mar monkeys around with their \"cebiche\" making it something else.  It's all about the gooey, creamy sauce.  Yuk!  Even the yuca wasn't spared. It was splattered, once again, with some concoction that came out of some misguided belief that the chef can do better than nature.  Anyway, spare yourself the misery unless you enjoy being treated like second class citizens and fed excessively priced sauce covered fish.  When I leave a good sushi bar, or eaten some good ceviche, I walk away feeling good.  When my wife and I walked away from La Mar, we felt bloated, with acid in our throat, and it stuck with us a long time.", "author": "Tom S."}

We didn't get this vibe from anyone. The hostess was adorable and polite and seated us right away.\n\nWe arrived at 6:45 pm (we made reservations 3 weeks in advance) and were promptly seated.\n\nWe did not leave (or stop eating) until 9:30 pm and we were NEVER made to feel like we were taking too long, or using up space. \n\nIn talking with Alejo, we told him we were enjoying a child free date night and he just let us enjoy our food and time together.\n\nHe also REALLY knows his wines. Trust him and let him make some wine decisions for you.\n\nAnother amazing thing for us gluten free people, is since it's Peruvian, the carbs are mostly potato based vs. bread based so I could really eat EVERYTHING.\n\nThe sweet potato/potato/plantain chips and dips they bring out in the beginning are amazing! I had to stop myself so I could enjoy all the other amazing food we ordered.\n\nWe started with both the Cebiche tasting AND the Causas tasting. Both were so fresh and perfectly seasoned. I personally prefered the Causas mostly because it was so beautiful with the purple mashed potatoes.\n\nWe then shared the Solterito de Quinoa which was so light and fresh and something I'm hoping I can semi replicate at home.\n\nI decided to have the Lomo Saltado for my main course which is a beef tenderloin stir fry. I was torn because the fish was so amazing but I really wanted to try a red wine so I picked the beef. I wasn't disappointed with either the lomo saltado or the Flowers Pinot Noir Alejo brought me.\n\nMy husband ordered the Chorrillana (halibut) which was almost too beautiful too eat, but don't worry, we did...\n\nYou'd think we'd be done eating here, but we weren't. \n\nWe finished with and Espresso for the hubby and a Latte for me.

Citrusy. It was a great cebiche.\n\n**CAUSA LIMENA** Really good. Crab sitting atop a beautiful little potato. The sauces and purees were also great compliments. Get your own you won't want to share.\n\n**PANCITO CON CHICARON** This is a tough one for me. The pork belly was deep-fried, it was crispy on the outside and creamy rich on the inside, but the slice was too thick. The result was fat running down your hands and when you took a bit, and a fat coating your mouth. If there was any way for them to cut the pork belly thinner (1/4 to 1/2 the thickness), I think this would be a winner, but as it stands it was too rich, too indulgent, too fatty. We ended up dipping the sando in the remaining cebiche sauce to cut the richness of the pork belly.\n\n**FRIED CALAMARI** terrible. Fishy, and overcooked. Tough, dry, and the flavor was awful.\n\n**CHICHARRON DO POLLO ANTICUCHERO** Fried chicken thigh meat. It was good, not great. Sauces were lost on the fried coating, and their flavors were not strong enough to stand up to the breading.\n\nTHE DRINKS were the same. Some good, some ok.\n\n**PRICKLY PEAR MARGARITA** the winner of the bunch. Hands down.\n**PISCO PUNCH** good, very limey, but good.\n**PASSION DAIQUIRI** I really don't like maraschino (which is a key ingredient in daiquiris). It wasn't listed on the cocktail menu as an ingredient, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I am pretty sure there was maraschino, I should have known better.

I love cebiche, but the food was unremarkable, portions were stingy for the price, and service was slow and fumbled.\n\nWent for lunch with four co-workers. Seated immediately on the patio. Beautiful view of the bay, which may explain the price/portion ratio. We later joked that the portion sizes may be the price diners pay for the restaurant's high rent.\n\nEmpanada sampler: Three moderately sized empanada. Chicken, mushroom and, if memory serves, beef. The chicken one was good but... uninteresting. It was a nicely prepared pastry of spiced chicken. That's all I can say about it--and if that's all I can say, then that's not enough.\n\nCebiche sampler: You get four small plates for $30. We each got about three bites among five people total. It included two traditional Peruvian preparations, one Chinese and one Japanese. The dishes were good, but again, not remarkable. For a place that makes cebiche its headline dish, I was expecting a transcendent experience, but I've had better cebiche at both the West Portal and Noe Valley Frescas. I think my evaluation here would have been more generous if the portions were larger. But the cebiche platter reeked of \"we can charge this much because most of our clientele will be tourists who'll never return.\"\n\nCausa pulpo: Grilled octopus on a basil-spinach causa (potato puree). Good, not great. We had to order 2.5 orders to serve all five diners. Each causa had a single bite of octopus on top. Thomas Keller can get away with these kinds of portions, but nothing about the experience, service, and level of food innovation supports this pricing strategy for La Mar.\n\nSo those were the appetizers. We then waited almost 40 minutes for the main dishes to arrive. When they did, only three of us were served. My carne dish was cold on arrival. A co-worker also reported his food arrived cold. About 10-12 minutes later, our other two diners were finally served. They reported their food was warm. So that's a small victory.\n\nOK, slightly staggered serving isn't uncommon. But after one to two minutes, it's unacceptable. \n\nMy grilled flat iron steak with fried potatoes continued the theme: Good but completely unremarkable food in small portions. There was absolutely nothing about the steak (or any of the food) that made me feel, \"Wow, this was a total Peruvian experience!\" So disappointing because I was hoping La Mar would take everything I've eaten at the Frescas to a whole new level. \n\nI would only come back for cocktails.", "author": "Jon P."}

I particularly love the appetizers: the cebiche and the causa pollo, very light and refreshing! The complimentary fries were really good with the dipping sauce they provided. I wasn't very impressed with the entree, which tasted like curry flavor mussels and clams. Need to admit that the seafood was very fresh though.

We were given a seat out in the patio which was perfect.  It was warm, sunny, and breezy. \n\nWater is precious in California so if you do not want water, then please inform the waiter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-06", "description": "On our last night out in SF this Labor Day weekend, we went to dinner at La Mar. Located in Pier 1.5 (not sure what half a pier constitutes, but whatever), there's a small area in front of the main restaurant to wait / use the bathroom, as well as a bar off to the side. With reservations, getting in was a cinch - easy to glide in and take our seats. For some reason, even though we had called ahead and said we were a party of 6, we got seated at a table for 8. There's nothing wrong with extra real estate, but given the loudness (more on that later), as well as the fact we were sharing everything - it made it a bit inconvenient to eat dinner. Our waitress was a bit cold to us at the beginning, but after we started ordering food and appearing more grownup than our appearances may have made us seem, she took more of a liking and became quite helpful in explaining dishes and preferences. The atmosphere is really nice as well - you would have what I assume is a nice view of the bay with outdoor seating...except there was a DJ party that took up the entire outdoor seating area. Apparently, said DJ (who was not named) hosts a private party at this place once a month. I love house music as much as the next person, but when what was supposed to be a laid-back Sunday sunset dinner bayside is turned into indoor seating right next to the entrance of a club party - so you can hear the beats plenty loud enough - it's kind of annoying. What's more annoying is that this is a regular occurrence, so they could have told me this was happening when I specifically requested outdoor seating on OpenTable. Fail.\n\nAside from that little beef, I did really enjoy the food hear. I've never had Peruvian before, and my perception of South American food tends to be that it's more focused on meat than seafood - so it was cool to get a bunch of plates and sample a bit of everything. As a general comment, I really liked the sauces that the dishes came with for the most part - in particular, any that had a bit of kick or spice to it. My favorites were the causas with dungeness crab - it was really, really fresh crab, and avocado puree and quail egg, combined with the potato, give it a hearty, stern backing that makes each bite sumptuous. The arroz norteno reminded me very much of paella, except that the rice wasn't as crisp, and the base had a bit more of a punchy flavor to it due to the spice. The other highlight was the special tiradito - with scallops, razor clams, and mussels, bathed in a spicy sauce reminiscent of what you'd find in a lobster bisque, it had a really warm flavor that accentuated the flavors of the seafood.\n\nIn all, La Mar was a delicious meal that didn't leave me feeling stuffed, yet made me feel like I had experienced a very different kind of cuisine that I hadn't had before. I'd definitely recommend eating family-style so you can get a taste of everything, and if you're in the mood, grabbing some of their drink specials while you can - the standard cocktails and beers aren't the cheapest. A nice dining experience that I'd love to come back for again, maybe next time when there's not a party with loud music going on outside.", "author": "Asuka N."}

Usually a reservations are needed but you can try and make it through a walk in if you show up early enough. The chicha morada drink is delicious, along with the plantain and potato chips they serve with different sauces. The empanadas had great flavor, the crust just crunchy enough. Our ceviche was the right amount of tangy and the flavors of the sauces complimented the clear freshness of the seafood. Our waitress (unfortunately I didn't get her name) was beyond kind and so sweet, she made our experience really amazing. The only thing I could say is that I was a little bummed out that the restroom did not have a changing table for babies. I figured this was because it was a trendy restaurant with fine dining and it's not considered that many patrons will bring their children. I did see many patrons with their kids--it was a bummer to have to improvise one on the restroom ground. Maybe La Mar will consider installing one in the future. Other than that, this restaurant is a lovely place to have dinner especially when looking to treat your palate extra well and have a beautiful evening out in San Francisco.", "author": "D S."}

I agree it was packed but even the Cheesecake Factory hostesses put a better face and greeting then this. \n\nHeading over to the food, I have nothing wrong to say about it. It was great!

I was staying in the swanky Miraflores area of town on my way to Cuzco and Machu Picchu, and it was the one place I decided to drop some do-re-centimos before preparing for my spiritual journey on the Inca Trail. So imagine my surprise when I saw that they had opened a sister restaurant in San Francisco, and it's a lot more spacious than its Peruvian progenitor. Wait, how can a sister be a progenitor? That's sick. \n\nBut the place is nice with a patio and dining area. I have to admit I never got past the Pisco Bar & Lounge since my friend Rene and I were in the mood for the $23 Cebiche Sampler - a set of four dishes of fresh goodness (see my photo). The Mixto is the flagship cebiche dish with mahi mahi, calamari, octopus and habanero pepper in an aji amarillo leche de tigre with cilantro, red onion, corn and yam, while the Nikei was truly Japanese in flavor with ahi tuna, avocado and cucumber in a tamarind leche de tigre with red onion. Yellowtail tuna is never a misstep, and the Chifa has it topped with peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots, habanero pepper, wonton strips and cilantro in a sesame leche de tigre.\n\nBut my favorite was a switcheroo we made - the Crudo, a near-sushi-like creation with prawns, sea urchin and scallops swimming in a sea urchin leche de tigre. The combination of all four cebiches was quite a treat, and we washed them all down with a couple of Chicharritas, one of several pisco concoctions they make here, this one Drambuie, chicha morada, and orange juice. The homemade potato chips were a nice crunchy contrast and accompanied by three sauces of varying temperatures. I'll be back for a real Peruvian feast at some point. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...fresh cebiche (or ceviche...whatever) in many colors...like a Miss Universe swimsuit competition\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious and modern, a nice add to the waterfront \nSERVICE - 4 stars...polished like they've been well trained to be composed \nTOTAL - 4 stars...upscale Peruvian is getting to be as popular as upscale Vietnamese in this town", "author": "Ed U."}

The chimichurri sauce was bursting with flavor and the spoonful of mashed potatoes was a great compliment to the grilled octopus.

The beef tenderloins was the most tender and sauciest beef cubes I've ever tasted in any Lomo Saltado.  Only downer was that it was a tad bit too salty.   Its because they salt the fries and the soy sauce they use to marinate and cook the Lomo Saltado in is naturally salty - so its like a double dose of salt.   *Maybe next time, I can ask for them to go light on the salt?\n\nDisclaimer: \n(1) All descriptions of the dishes consumed were taken from their website.\n(2) Use the restroom in the main room and not the one in the waiting room. \nThere's a partition between the cafe and the main dining room.  I horrifically stumbled across a single unisex restroom in the waiting room.  Unlike normal single stall restrooms, there was a door partitioning the waiting room and the restroom itself.  As you walk in, you see a sink and a separate toilet partition (with which there was no lock).  As I entered the first door, a woman exited.  So by natural deduction, I assumed the restroom would be vacant, to my surprise there was a man with his drawers down - the oddest thing for me was that he seemed so causal about me walking in on.

We were seated outside, it was a beautiful day and we had a lovely view of the water and boats docked. Baller status! \n\nWe had a sampler appetizer with yummy ceviche, calamari, and an awesome whipped potato/seafood thingy. Yum, yum and yum. AND they serve you these plantain chips with delicious dipping sauces. I ordered the picu picu special of the day over a lima bean cake (!), which i wolved down with the ferocity of a sumo wrestler. I washed it all down with a traditional Peruvian drink, which was different - it had an cinammon/cumin flavor but was refreshingly good. Still eager for more deliciousness, we all split dessert - key lime pie and these chocolate beignets which squirted chocolate lava happiness. What an excellent meal! The ambiance, the food, the sheer excellence. It's pricey but worth it.", "author": "Hanan H."}

We came for lunch without reservations, and were seated in a nice quiet spot outside in the shade. I had the Cebiche Barrio, which has Condensed Milk, Haba\u00f1ero peppers, Cilantro, Lime, Red Onion, and a beautiful variety of succulent seafood: a HUGE scallop, Ahi Tuna, Prawns, and Squid. It was of course what seemed like a rather small portion, but the concentration of the flavors was so intense that it was thoroughly satisfying, especially when I dipped some fried Plantain Chips into it. \n\nMy one gripe with the restaurant was that I told the Waiter I needed Gluten-Free food, which he accommodated by giving me a Gluten-Free menu. However, he forgot to tell me that the dipping sauces for the Plantain Chips have crushed crackers in them. I did not appreciate this at ALL, but he made up for it somewhat by giving us a free dessert. The sorbet sampling was very satisfying, and I would likely come back again, but I would be more adamant in stating my Gluten-Free needs.", "author": "Cecilia F."}

I remembered going to La Mar for drinks after a friends Christmas work party a few years ago. When I suggested this place to her I knew right away it would be a good setting for us to meet for the first time.\n\nI got there really early , I had been pacing up and down the Wharf area because I was nervous as hell. Ended up being so hot and overheated on that rainy ass night my glasses were literally steamed up. Got there at 5:30, 15 minutes  early for my reservation. I enter and there is a group leaving. The front desk guys offered them a friendly farewell and thank you. I walk up to the desk. I'm standing there. These jerks barely look up from their silly little lists. I waited for them to acknowledge me so i can get to my table. Nothing. im feeling a smart ass remark on the tip of my tongue. Swiftly the Hostess intervenes, swoops in with a friendly greeting and takes me to the table.\n\n\n\nI sit at the table, i'm 30 minutes early. i'm burning up now. Thank god my waiter must see the panicked look on my face. He came by to get me a drink order and some water which was invaluable by now. I pound through like 2 huge glasses of ice water and a Peruvian beer in about 10 minutes and I finally got my nerves and everything chilled out so now im just waiting for her now.\n\nShe gets there at around 6pm. Looking amazing. The waiter promptly greets her and gets her a drink with a very subtle suggestion Pisco Sour without being pushy. \n\nWe were having a great time. The atmosphere is perfect inside this place. It puts me in a relaxed mood. The Menu was pretty huge. She wanted a Tuna Appetizer and I ordered the Beef Empanadas . The Tuna dish was a lot more simple and sparse then I expected.  The fact i'm a Chef myself I was really hoping to see some better presentation because the photography of the platings online was very colorful and impressive. Still with all that being said. Both appetizers were nice. The crust on the Empanadas is perfect with beef. When you take all things in to account: Location, Quality, Price, Style, Originality, Service I can't complain at all\n\nAt this point I've lost track of time. We were super deep in to conversation and the overall vibe. The Server kept the drinks coming. My date's second drink was some crazy Raspberry,Sparkling Wine, and booze cocktail. It's garnished with mint and is very pink. She thought it was the best \"fruity\" drink that she's ever had. I agreed with her that it was awesome but i wouldn't order it for myself because it wasn't macho.\n\n\nBy this time the tables on our right and left have turned over once each and new guests were seated. The waiter managed to convince us to get our meal. By this time i was not focused on food at all. I ordered the most expensive dish, I think $32  , it was Beef. It came out and was another underwhelming presentation but the food was quality. It came with some white rice that had a shellfish broth. Still definitely not bad at all. The couple next to us had a beautiful entree platter set on the table and my date and I were wishing we had ordered what they had. It was some kind of Seafood mix with rice. It kinda reminds me of Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura on top of Seafood Paella. Next Time!!!  \n\nWe finished up with some coffee and a desert that was like pumpkin and Cinnamon ice cream. It was awesome!! Get that. She loved that. It was a great way to finish up the dinner.\n\n\n\nNow here is the main reason why I give this place a solid 4 Stars. They didn't rush us at all. I sat down at the table at 5:30 pm and we left  La Mar at about 10:15 pm. That was the most obscenely long dinner for two i've ever heard of. I was shocked at how long I was in there. But this place was fun and I was in the groove. I had like 4 beers, She had 3 fancy cocktails, 2 appetizers, the most expensive Entree, Dessert and Coffee. The bill was only like $137. I tipped $60 because the service was awesome \" Other than the desk guys\" and they never tried to rush me out. Still I felt like I made out like a bandit  on that sale. She loved the place and night we had so that's what matters. I will definitely be back and recommend you take your date to La Mar. Literally about a 10 minute walk from the  Embarcadero BART Station. If you are from out of town and unfamiliar with most of SF this is super easy to find, get in and get out. I'll be back for sure!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nDon't underdress but at the same time be comfortable", "author": "Dan J."}

Considering we had reservations we were promptly seated by our host. Here is a quick review for our DINING experience only.\n\nHITS\n-- Appetizers : We had the Empanadas platter and the Ceviche Mixto. Both were well made and hit the spot with the correct balance of crispy-spice on the Empanadas and the fresh-tart on the Ceviche.\n\n--The complimentary Chips ( Combo of Plantain, Sweet Potato and Potato ) and sauce combo are perfect accompaniments to your cocktails.\n\n-- Drinks : We had the Pisco Sour, Spicy Mango , Bar Special and the Cholito. Each and every one of these cocktails were well made and are worth their price.\n\n-- Ambience: Located right next to the Pier 1 SF.. This is a prime location. The dining room is huge..The ambience is elegant and warm.. Perfect for Dinner.. though I am sure with huge French Doors in the Dining Area .. this is will be a good spot to grab lunch/brunch as well.\n\n-- Service: \nThe wait staff and our Host for the evening were both attentive and courteous. They make sure to check with you from time to time and make sure that you are well taken care of.\n\nMISSES\n-- Entrees\nWe had Loma Soltado, Anticucho Mixto and Arroz Negro. I don't know whether it was the fact that it took a long time to send our Entrees out OR something else but barring the Loma Soltado ; the remaining 2 Entrees simply failed to match up to the dishes that preceded it.\n\n\nOVERALL\n-- Good Ambience + Excellent Service\n-- Well made Appetizers and Cocktails.. \n-- This is a good place for Happy Hour in the Embarcadero Area considering Appetizers and Drinks are what stood out for me.\n-- This place is PRICEY considering a 3 course dinner with round of drinks easily set us back by 200+ $$.\n-- Personally I think Limon Rotisserie in the Mission is a much better bet  for Dinner / Lunch.", "author": "Abhishek R."}

The music was festive and it gave the restaurant a lively vibe, but romantic. Since my two fellow friends and I love Peruvian food, and my two friends have been to Peru, they wanted to eat here. It is true, you have heard right. This is the best Peruvian restaurant that we have eaten at.  The server recommended some cocktails for us. We had the punches and passion andina. Since it was so yummy and perfect for girls, we had another round. Potato chips with sauces were served instead of usual bread and butter. Gosh, I think I have died and gone to heaven. I love potato chips and I love dipping things into sauces. God has answered my prayers! My friends were laughing at me when I kept on munching on it with our drinks. Yum! The chips didn't go very far, it sat on the table right next to me. :P Next, we started off with the cebiche tasting since we couldn't decide which cebiche that we wanted to try. Hmmm...all the cebiches are delicious, but we had a favorite. Yes, we ordered another-our favorite cebiche. Our favorite was the cebiche mixto. It was perfect-especially with the cocktails. \n\nOur entrees were arroz norteno, arroz juguso (prawns, clams, mussels, calamari, octopus, white fish and vegetables in a juicy arborio rice with a blend of Peruvian ajis. Served with rocoto aioli and toasted bread), and a sero cordero (Braised lamb chank with baby carrots and peas served over cannellini bean tacu tacu.) We didn't finish everything of course! Gosh, the entrees were sooo good! ). We had to save room for our dessert. Who could turn down bunuelos de chocolate (Orange glazed chocolate beignets with banana and passion fruit ice cream?  It definitely was a treat for us to eat here. YUM! Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I know I'll come here within a heartbeat. :)", "author": "Jennifer G.H. W."}

Polite, humorous, courteous and very knowledgeable!\n\nWe started with the Cebiche La Mar which is a sampler of 4 of their best cebiches. The halibut and tuna cebiches were our favorite of the 4. Next up was the Causa Taster which serves 3 decadently whipped potatoes each with their own topping of crab, beets and spicy tuna. Each was delicious in their own rights! Then came the Passion Scallops, seared fresh scallops on a bed of passion fruit infused quinoa. Sweetness of scallops and the tangy flavors of the quinoa compliments the dish perfectly. Lastly, the best dish of the meal was the Pulpo, grilled octopus with mashed potatoes and salsa. Never have I eaten octopus so soft and masterfully prepared. \n\nMy girlfriend and I aren't very big dessert eaters, but considering it was Valentine's Day we ordered a dessert for the heck of it. I picked the Limon Pie, served in a cup with fluffy lemon meringue and custard on top of a pie crust bottom. A bit tart for my girlfriend, but I liked it. \n\nGreat place to take a date!", "author": "Philip K."}

The first two times I went (2 years ago), I was so impressed. The last several times, not so much. The portions are not worth the price (ex: lomo saltado = 4 pieces of meat in the entire dish) and the quality (beef empanadas with two bites of meat, one was straight gristle) has gone downhill. The service is really bad. As the daughter of a chef who owned his own restaurant, I know when the food arrives to your table LUKEWARM or COLD, it's the server, not the kitchen. \n\nI had dinner there this past week.

She had the utmost disturbed look on her face and said \"just so you know, almost half the bottle was gone BUT we'll still take it back and take if off your bill\".

Architecturally interesting, but it's a big cavernous space, filled with people and conversation on a busy night. I could barley hear my companion across the table.

Leche de tigre was fun, zesty sauces and different sea creatures in shot glasses.\n\nThe noise level is rough, hard surfaces and high ceilings do that.

The ceviche was really fresh and is easily some of the best I have had.  I would definitely go back to try more ceviche.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSince it was NYE and Embarcadero was full of pedestrians, someone decided it would be nice to let said pedestrians use the bathrooms near the hostess table and in the restaurant.  Nice? Sure, but not when you are a paying customer and have to deal with a line of 20 just to get to a stall.  Works out well since the waiter never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks...maybe he was just looking out for my bladder?\n\nThe Meh:\n\nI was told to try the Lomo Saltado, which is supposed to be one of their better dishes.  I could be mistaken, but I thought the menu said it was kobe beef.  In any event, it doesn't matter.  The dish was way too salty to taste the beef anyway.  It tasted like a stir fry that I used to make when I was young and single.  It was pretty underwhelming and I wish I had ordered something else. meh\n\nMaybe it was New Year's Eve, or maybe it was all the build-up of other people loving this place, but I only thought it was so-so.

For 2 at lunch on a Sun afternoon it was $52 + $4.42 tax = $56.42 Before Tip!  Can you say Sticker Shock!\n\nEat all the FREE chips/plantains - that's the Only way to fill up here.  3 sauces given - all pretty Bland!  Green sauce - bland, Yellow-bland, Orange-Bland!\n\nYou get tiny amounts of food people.  For a 1/2 order of Cebiche Clasico $9 you get maybe 4 tiny pieces of Calif. halibut w/ tiny slices of red onions & habanero pepper leche de tigre w/ Peruvian corn & yam.  Full portion is $15.  Drink the sauce - you paid for it & it was recommended.\n\nAnother dish we got: Cabiche chifa $9 - again that's a half order which had 4 tiny Yellowtail tuna w/ peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots & daikon, wonton strips & cilantro in sesame leche de tigre.  Drink the sauce since you paid for it & waitress recommends it.  Maybe so u can fill up too.\n\nSopa Parihuela -$11 - it's a Bland soup w/ mussels, calamari, clams, mahi mahi, ginger & red onion.  Tasted like tomato sauce w/ the seafood in it. Bland!\n\nArroz Norteno $19 - a bland rice dish w/ 2 mussels, some other seafood, yellow sauce, green rice.  \n\nOnly got 1 drink: Chicha Morada $5 on menu, but on Bill only $4.  Classic Peruvian refreshment made of maiz morado (purple corn).  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I liked it, but I also had it before in other Peruvian places way cheaper.\n\nIt's also Way Too Loud in there.  If you like to shout when you want to talk to your companions then come here.

We ordered 4 plates off the happy hour menu and a cocktail (at $6 a plate, sounds like a good deal right?). 3 ceviche dishes and a chicken dish. It was so gosh darn small! Like my ex-girlfriend would say about her new boyfriend.. when she unzips his... Anyway, the food was delish! Especially the chicken pieces, had a unique taste that my daughter loved! But the plates were so small and not filling. The cocktail was nice, a whiskey sour topped with egg white, good stuff!\n\nAt the end, I stared at the $45.00 bill while my stomach growled.

It was a great view of the waters.  The weather was not too bad since we had the heaters above us. \n\nThe server was super slow in taking our order and coming around to our table was almost non existence.  We ordered the empanada samplers to start.  However, based on the yelp reviews, I know the potato chips and different sauces to be an excellent start.  We had asked for our complimentary potato chips but they never arrived.  After about 20 minutes, a bus boy came to a table right next to us to wipe down and clean the table, we had asked if he could get some for us.

I was bothered that it was that easy and we were sitting here for 20 minutes waiting patiently. Strike one!\n\nAppetizers: Empanada Samplers - I had asked the server how I could identify which empanada samples were which.  His response was \"I don't know, I already placed the order.\" The empanada's arrived shortly afterwards.

Trust me, you cannot have just one. \n\nNext, instead of free bread, delivered to your table without you even asking are these amazing \"chips\" - a mix of sweet potato, banana, etc., with 3 different dipping sauces on the side. I love anything I can dip, so they had me at hello. \n\nMoving onto the cebiche. My favorite is the chifa. I've been known to literally drink the marinade (leche de tigra) directly from the bowl, it's *that* good. And don't forget the causas tasting. These fantastic little whipped potato \"rolls\", accented with different and creative toppings. Unique and perfectly flavorful. \n\nNow, picture yourself outside on a beautiful patio, overlooking the SF Bay, while enjoying all of the above, and more.

He pointed out that the specific difference between mexican ceviche and peruvian cebiche is that cebiche was not lounging around in lime, but it is freshly made to order.  It was clearly evident that wasn't the case when the cebiche arrived at our table. \n\nStrike two:  Busboys and their pretentious attitude.  I'm used to a little snootieness but the \"are you DONE with that yet?\" with a look and a head twist was a first for me.  Geez, you thought I stole the bartender from you at the Lookout or something...\n\nStrike three:  Five of our six mains come out.  Three to four minutes later, our server comes by and says \"oh it hasn't come out yet? let me go check.\"  Front of house manager walks by a few minutes later and looks at our table, says nothing, walks off.  Five minutes later the manager comes by and nonchalantly says \"we made a mistake, we'll have that right out.\"  \n\nBy that time we were all basically done eating.  \n\nAnother five minutes, and the manager delivers the plate, saying \"because we made the mistake it's on the house.\"  I appreciate that.  \n\nThe server comes by later to make us aware that it wasn't his fault - \"the kitchen has been screwing me all night - they did the same thing to the table next to you.\"  As if his explanation/excuse (I call it blame shifting) makes me feel better about this place.  \n\nAll of this may be forgiven if the food was amazing.  But it's not.  It's just okay. \n\nLook - if you're on an expense account and you want to wow your customers with a nicely located venue and \"exciting\" cuisine then go for it.  But if you're here to eat, there's nothing you couldn't find at a half decent Peruvian restaurant.  Save your dollars and frustration for other things.", "author": "Eddy L."}

From the moment we walked in all through dinner, dessert, and departure, I don't think we got a smile from any staff at any point. Host did not greet us upon arrival. When I said hi how are you? He said fine and did not ask me back how we were doing. I said we had reservations he said ok. After a short wait, we were seated. We received only one drink menu to peruse (party of 8). It took a minute for the waiter to get to our table and he did not prompt whether we wanted to just order drinks first or food as well. It was well past 8:30 so you know, our asses were gettin hangry. The restaurant was loud and the acoustics bad. Yet the waiter stood at the far end of the table to try to take my order. I had to ask him to come around cuz I wanted to ask a question about the menu and couldn't hear him for shit. They were out of about 5 different things we tried to order (both food and drink). Now why didn't U just say off the bat that certain menu items were out already when we first got the menu? I just spent 10 minutes deciding what I want and now I gotta decide on an alternate as you hover my shoulder? Shit is serious ok! Well he seemed indifferent answering question, also did not return to ask how things were going. So, yea, food is good but at this price point, I definitely expect better service. I mean, you got pork on the menu for $50! I'll pay that for a well handled cut of beef (hello house of prime rib) but sorry it ain't happening with pork.

Just not the type of place I want to go for a dinner.\n\nThe food itself was good not great. I've definitely had better peruvian food. For my first course I ordered a ceviche with octopus, cancha, red onion, and either jalapeno or habanero. I expect with either of those peppers the dish would have some spice. This was totally not the case. In fact, I'm pretty confident they just left the pepper out all together. The dish had nice flavors, but just left me disappointed.\n\nMy second dish was the causa lime\u00f1a. This was actually a very nice dish. The avocado puree and sauce complimented the crab so well. I was disappointed that the quail egg was cooked. Typically I have raw quail egg on sushi and it just gives it such a smooth texture. I was expecting the same thing with this dish. The potato causa was soft and full of flavor. I would highly recommend you try this.\n\nMy final course was the short ribs seco. The short ribs were cooked perfectly, they literally just fell apart at the touch of my fork. But the flavor was completely missing. They were supposed to have been braised with cilantro but I could not taste that at all. The rest of the dish was just average. It was a very filling and was very good for left over dinner.\n\nThe server was very nice but incredibly slow and not very attentive. He also tried to talk me out of ordering three courses. That just annoyed me. As a server you should be making recommendations not telling people they shouldn't order food. Overall, I would say if you're in the area you might enjoy this place.

Light, airy and spacious with bright blue seats easily reflecting the sea.  My expectation of grilled octopus was charred tentacles with a dipping sauce....could not be any further from the truth!  WOW.  They looked like lobster claws and were equally as tender.  But the show stopper was the olive aioli....a bottle to go, please!

VERY SMALL PORTIONS\n*************************************HUGE BILL! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!\n\n A GF and I wandered into LA MAR one Thursday on our way to The Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market.  The restaurant is very hard edged industrial, softened by interesting lighting fixtures. We decided to go back one day.\n\nONE DAY was YESTERDAY - 28 SEPTEMBER 2012.\n\nIt was Sixish and crowded with a private party going on to the left of the entrance.  IT WAS SUPER NOISY due to the Very High Ceilings, the20-30 something crowd is so loud wherever they gather.  It seems scream is what young women are supposed to do....UGH.\n\nWe were seated at a long bar just after the entrance.  We were looking a Bobble Heads as the the cooks and platers couldn't be seen unless we stood up a bit.DUMB IDEA not to make the divider a bit lower.  We missed the action and would have really enjoyed watching the action and the well plated food.\n\nWe were seated immediately.  The server was nice and brought us the delicious Terra Firma Chips....plaintains, sweet potatoes and yucca,,,,,,  truly addictive.  But, they seemed to forget to replace the salsas which were pureed ??. We would have truly enjoyed more salsas, weasked and it was delivered.\n\nService uneven but done by pleasant Latino homres.\n\nTHE FOOD::::::::::::\n\nWe tried an the Cebiche Sampler, 4 cebiches on a grand 4 section plate.  But, thst was it as the portions were so small.  The waiter told us that it was great TO SHARE....NOT TRUE. MyGF had to CUT the Lone Prawn in half!  The best tasting was the \"Chifa\" (means Chinese in Peru) but so tiny..... it was made with sesame oil, peanuts, blah, blah, blah.  There was one that was some sort of mushy white fish and I, THINK, Squid rings.  If I weren't with a friend, I would have stabbed her hand while she cut the LONE PRAWN......  No memorable at all.\n\nMy friend ordered the white fish entree with lima beans and a SUNNY SIDE UP FRIED EGG. Why on earth is a Fried Egg on a piece of fish???  I didn't know it was breaded and I prefer not to eat breaded fish..  The crust was beautifully golden but it was so thick that it was mushy and I didn't each much of it as PREFER NOT TO EAT breading.   I really do not like MUSHY\nBREADING. Basically, I ate a dish I DIDN'T CHOSE, DIDN'T LIKE and PAID FOR.IT!!!! MY GF Took it home and she got a free meal.\n\nNOTHING WAS ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFULLY PLATE.\n\nI drank a PISCO SOUR and a PISCO PUNCH,  The sour was so small it made me sour for $12.00.  The punch was much bigger and much better.  We both ENJOYED......... THE FREE CHIPS and Forgotten Salsas\n\nWE EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE!\n\nAfter dinner we both agreed that we would NOT GO BACK.  We can eat better\nceviche in the Mission!\n\n\n                     ##########TACKY, TACKY, TACKY##########\n\nI NEEDED TO GO TO THE LADIES ROOM......... \nIT IS ... IN THE RECEPTION AREA, RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE RECEPTION DESK....YUCK\n\nPLUS IT IS .......  UNISEX     INDUSTRIAL.... WITH A WHITE DOOR with THE UBIQUITOUS BLUE TRIANGLE with the Male-Female SIGN.  \nWHAT WERE THEY THINKING??????

My mother ordered the special, an Amazonian fish, and it came very salty (soy sauce and oyster sauce combo) ... she had it sent back but came back the same exact way; ended up getting something else but it said a little about the service here -- they were accommodating yes but did not hear our concern about the saltiness of the dish. I had the seafood fried rice, which was like a jambalaya. We all felt really thirsty after the meal as if there was MSG?\n\nAppetizers are what these pictures show; small but tasty.

My experience here a few weeks ago was sorely lacking. The prices seemed reasonable, until we got the dishes! This was because the portions are insanely small. The drinks are good and stiff, however. The waitress and manager were rude from the minute we walked in the door up until we paid. They added a 20% mandatory gratuity even though we were just three, and they also calculated the tip on top of the tax and sf health fee!

Yes, needless to say, I am not very pleased. \n\nI made reservations on Open Table a few days prior for Monday at 9pm. I was planning on calling to relay the fact that I chose La Mar for a special occasion birthday dinner. I called and spoke to a very polite young woman. I told her that it would be my first time visitng the restaurant and asked if she recommended a table inside or the patio. She recommened the patio and told me that she would note down it was my boyfriend's birthday. I specifically told her I suck at being sneaky and have failed horribly in the past with the whole Slyly-Let-Your-Server-Know-There's-A-Birthday situation, which is why I was calling in advance. She laughed and assured me again that she would make to make note of it. \n\nWe get to La Mar for our reservation, and had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be set up, which I didn't mind too much because we weren't in any rush. We're finally seated, not outside but inside. I kindly tell the host that I had called early and requested patio seating. So we wait about 5-ish more minutes for them to accomodate us to a table outside. \n\nOkay at this point I'm slightly annoyed, but I was in a great mood feeling extra fabulous and extra sexy in my brand new LBD from Zara. So okay, I can let things slide... I like to think of myself as an accomodating person. \n\nWe get to our table and frankly, I'm not impressed. The patio was loud and we were placed at an odd corner. At this point I'm sadly glancing inside with puppy eyes super disappointed because I was thinking that a table inside would have been much better (pero ya que!) I can't help but be a little upset at the lady who took my call earlier who RECOMMENDED the patio. Strike 1. \n\nSo i'm trying the make the best of the situation, and of course, I'm still feeling and looking fab in my LBD... so it's a little easier to let things go... \n\nFor drinks we start with 2 Pisco Punches (delish!) and we decide on and order the Empanada sampler as an appetizer. Our server comes back after a while of us enjoying our drinks and kindly lets us know that the kitchen is a bit backed up. So we place our dinner order. So we're enjoying our drinks when the ceviche we order comes out, FOLLOWED by the complimentary plaintain chips (which obviously should have been the first thing to come out, followed by our still missing appetizer). Strike 2.\n\nAt this point I'm peeved, trying to hide how annoyed I was at the situation. \n\nSo Strike 3, while the Boo slipped to the bathroom I figured I should double check with our server to make sure he knew about the birthday. Of course, he said he was not told and didn't know. Seriously??? I know it's not his fault the message wasn't passed down, but I was so disappointed. \n\nBut wait, what about the food you ask? Not like it even matters to me at this point since I'm highly unlikely to return. But, the empanadas are worth it to try and the Ceviche Clasico wasn't as tasty as the ceviche I had at Limon. The Lomo Saltado, however, I have to admit is hands down the best Lomo Saltado I've tried (definitely a must order). \n\nAnyways, moral of the story.. trying to plan the perfect birthday dinner is H-A-R-D. Quality restaurants should make the extra effort to have it go smooth, especially if you tell them (in advance!!!) that it's a special occasion.", "author": "Kay M."}

To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those @ La Mar's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in the United States! I will be returning to La Mar's  soon, hungry for more.", "author": "Juan R."}

And I was so excited when they chose to have dinner here.\n\nI like the place, very positive vibe.  Good lighting, very good ambiance. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation and we were told there will be a 2 hour wait to get a table if we didn't want to be at the bar.  For that we opted to sit at the bar.  We didn't want to bother waiting.\n\nWhile we look over the menu, they served us potato, banana and yam chips with 3 types of dipping sauces that goes from mild, medium and spicy. - - - Very Good!\n\nI got the Inca soda.  It tasted like bumble gum but I had to have it, it added to the whole Peru theme :) \n\nMe and my friend shared:\n1. Causa Tasting for our appetizer.  It was a platter of mashed potato or yam with different toppings, 2 were of fish and 2 were of vegetables, with four different sauces. - - - Very Good!\n\n2.  Arroz  Parihuela for our main dish.  This is like paella.  It was rice, mussels, octopus and shrimp.  This was really very tasty and spicy I can't stop digging in.  I wanted to close my eyes and savor the moment.  That's how delectable it was. - - - Very Good!\n\n3.  Crepe de chocolate and picarones for dessert.  The crepe was on a bed of orange sauce with ice cream on the side.  Wrapped inside was chocolate mousse.  Picarones was fritters that came with a honey sauce spiced with cinnamon or mint maybe?  It was a perfect way to end our meal.  Just divine. - - - Very Good!\n\nI liked how everything was very tasteful with the right amount of spiciness.  Our food was well portioned.  Although me and my friend shared, we were satisfied and did not feel like we didn't have enough.  \n\nOur server was awesome too, just awesome.  Of course I forgot to ask his name, but the Mexican guy deserves a BIG shout out.  Thanks for making our dining experience very pleasurable.  \n\n(Oh, that blonde girl who sits people gave my friend a look I didn't like when we entered the door.  I didn't appreciate that but I let it go.  Also, she wasn't that friendly when she was explaining our table situation.  Nevertheless, I'm not letting her take away the five stars).  \n\nBe ready to pay a lot.  This is expensive.  Our bill came up to $80 plus tip.  That's $40 per person.  But but but believe me when I say you will leave very happy and contented.", "author": "Pam S."}

The portions were a little small, but it was enough for us since we didn't want to fill up too much before dinner.

However, I've worked at a ton of restaurants before, and this will be my first 5 star =) Read on..\n\nThis place is absolutely gorgeous, from the bar, to the dining room, all the way to the back patio. The view is incredible by the patio on a sunny day, or you can people watch by the bar in front as well. \n\nService is excellent and tentative. Everyone is very knowledgeable about their dishes, and their wines :)\n\nLastly, the FOOD is obviously the best part! I can go on about the many dishes I've tried, but I think I'll stick with my all time favorites. \n\n- Cebiches are all amazing, but my favorite will go to the cebiche clasico. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water right now.\n\n- Causa limena is absolutely amazing, and although we order this as one of our appetizers every time, I would gladly eat all 3 pieces BY MYSELF =D\n\nThose 2 are my MUST-HAVES at La Mar, but the arroz norteno, pescado nikei, and lomo saltado are also extremely delicious. \n\nAnd I must not forget about dessert! The picarones are probably high on the list of heart-attack creators, but you will die a happy person. They are THE BOMB!\n\nThey have specials every week, so definitely inquire about those. And for 1st or 2nd timers, I'd definitely recommend ordering and sharing a BUNCH of small plates and ordering a couple of entrees for the full experience. The entrees are great, but the small plates are where it's at!\n\nTrust me, it's worth the pennies in your pocket.

The restaurant seemed so big with many sections and at first glance I thought it was empty. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation so we were at the mercy of the hostess. We were told the only available seating would be on the patio but were assured the heating lamps made the patio warm and toasty. We were escorted to the patio, a number of tables were filled so it was nice to not be the only outcasts :) \n\nAs we were seated I quickly discovered that there was no middle ground for the cold or heat. If you sat directly under the heat lamp it was too hot and if you weren't it was too cold, so I spent most of the night heating up and then cooling off. \n\nYou've probably read about the fried plantain and other chips with the dipping sauces they serve; and for good reason, they are delish! I have a thing for empanada so I just had to order the empanadas de lomo saltado (skirt steak). My date ordered the cebiche carretillero as well as a glass of Argentina Malbec wine that she thought was good but overpriced. We also ordered causa casera (vegetarian). BTW causa causa are whipped potatoes that look like mini cupcakes. \n\nI enjoyed my empanada dish. To me it's a dish that I like to call \"the perfection of average\" so simple in preparation and ingredients that if you can't make this good, what can you make good. My date didn't really enjoy her dish. After tasting it, I didn't like the citrus of the lemon combined with leche de tigre. \n\nThe causa causa looked like potato salad and had the consistency of potato salad but there were so many different tastes that my taste buds were confused after trying to process and make sense of how the different tastes were supposed to play off of each other. My date was my dessert so we didn't order any from the restaurant ;-)\n\nThere were some aspects of the restaurant that I really enjoyed and some that didn't move me. The server didn't reveal his name, but he was very nice and attentive. \n\nThe presentation of the food, I think was \"fluff\" I know they have to make it pretty but when I think of down home Peruvian food being prepared by a Mom or Grandmother, does it look the way it was served to me? \n\nGreat energy, good lighting and ambiance.

Despite being visibly pregnant, she did an absolutely excellent job of taking care of our party of 12. Super attentive and just incredibly sweet and receptive to drink orders. You know birthday parties can be a little demanding. I'd give five stars just for her if I could. \n\nThere were only two things I didn't really like about this restaurant:\n1. For large parties, the host is required to set a menu in advance. Though it was great to taste a large variety of what the restaurant offers, it also would have been great to have a little more choice, particularly because my boyfriend and I don't eat a ton of fish. That being said, the food was very good. \n2. The prices. Because we never saw a menu, we figured that dinner would be decently expensive but nothing over the top for a restaurant of that caliber. We were estimating the bill would come out to $60-75 per person, but it was more like $115. Given that the party was on a Sunday night and therefore nobody was really drinking heavily, we were needless to say a little surprised. \n\nFor more specifically on our experience, you can also check Alice P.'s review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-mar-cebicheria-peruana-san-francisco#hrid:gdPwCaBoUjIVjbl7kvi2kQ", "author": "Stephanie W."}

The waitress jumped the gun and brought us four seafoods, and when we pointed out that nobody had taken our order and that we had wanted to try some seafood options and some veggie options, she fought on us it, told us we had indeed ordered, and said if things were really serious she would have to get her manager to discuss.  What the hell?  We tried the tactful, \"there was a misunderstanding, we had actually wanted ___ ...\" approach, and were met with basically, 'you ordered what you ordered, I've done nothing wrong and if you have a serious problem here I can get the manager.'  So I guess four people all ordered, including ordering dishes they didn't want, and then we all forgot about it?  Come on.  We just took the seafoods because we didn't want the manager to come over and escalate things.  Still, there was a tension from the very start of the meal because the waitress did not like us and made that fact clear.  To her credit she came back later and offered mid-meal to switch us to what we had tried to order but really we just wanted to be out of there.\n\nNobody explained the dishes as they came out, our waitress would walk away in the middle of new drink orders (and when we'd ask her to come back she'd say, \"I'll be back in a minute\"), and so on.

They were savory and spiced, but IMO bloody marys at Epic Roasthouse are unbeatable (http://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-roasthouse-san-francisco).  How can La Mar's bacon or shrimp bloody mary compete with one boasting pork belly, prosciutto, salami, AND olives?  It doesn't--and that's why it's $3 less.\n\nI decided to order from the lunch menu because brunch is clearly an American concept (not a Peruvian one).  I had the almuercito chalaco (seafood cebiche, grilled skirt steak, and a corn empanada) on one sampler plate.  It was good and gluttonous--seafood, steak, and dessert for lunch FTW!  DF opted for brunch and ordered the Italian sausage and yucca fries topped with a poached egg.

It still manages to be a sexy, cozy space even with all that room. I started with an amazing easy-to-drink pisco cocktail. I have no idea what the name of it was, but all the cocktails seem to include pisco so you probably can't go wrong. If you pick one that comes in a martini glass and is purple you just might have gotten the one I ordered.\n\nOur group was a little on the larger side and so we shared a few things - ceviche tastings, empanada tastings, the whipped potato tastings. All of it was yum, but I could have eaten my own order of the corn empanada. Perhaps I will next go around. I also ordered the beef skewers, which were served with hominy. And it was quite delicious enough for me to eat it all.\n\nThe only downer? We were celebrating a birthday and the bartenders refused to make us chocolate cake shots. Who does that? Especially on a 30th birthday night? And to be clear they told us they had all the ingredients, they just didn't want to make them. Harrumph.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

Started with happy hour in the bar.  Seems like we always have Mr. Grouchy the bartender who always tells us how long he's been there that day and how frazzled his day is going.  Gee, sorry buddy but not the best way to great guests.  Anyway, we enjoyed a Blue Mule (or something like that), which the bartender fixed without any enthusiasm because he told us it was the thousandth time today.  I had a Peruvian beer, which I had tried last time and enjoyed it.  Beer was very cold and crispy and went down easily since it was so stinking hot in the City that day (90 plus).  For dinner, we asked for Nick but he no longer worked there.  So we had Breno, who was pretty good. We shared the causa limena and arroz la mar along with a very fine Spanish white wine (Pazo Senorans).  Very nice; the rice dish reminded me of paella and was probably not the right dish to have on such a hot day.  But, the seafood was really good especially the mussels.  Could have used more seafood, but not bad for the buck. No dessert this time.  One other comment is with regard to the host: Zack.  He was very friendly and helpful but disappeared about the time we were ready to eat.  Seems he got sidetracked by a table of VIPs that needed some special attention.  Anyway, he was good about it and seemed interested in seating us where we felt most comfortable.  Would again recommend this restaurant to locals and out of towners like us.", "author": "Greg C."}

Although I am unfamiliar with Peruvian food, the waiter gave a quick run down of the menu and even offered many suggestions, making my decision on what to order easy! Overall, the service was excellent--I never had to ask for refills on my water cup. \n\nWhile waiting for the entrees, they served unique chips of different kinds--potato chips, plantain chips and sweet potato chips--accompanied with three different dipping sauces. Do try the sweet potato chips (the dark orange chips) with all three sauces!\n\nFor my cebiche tasting, I got the day's special, Cebiche Chorillano, which was made up of mahi mahi, mussels, calamari, shrimp, cancha and celery in a creamy rocoto leche de tigre. This was DELICIOUS! Everything was extremely fresh. Be careful of the habanero chili as a garnish at the top! The dish is already sufficiently spicy (enough to make me drink water, but not too much that I am dripping sweat), and accidentally eating a habanero chili would be a tragedy, at least for me. \n\nBy suggestion of the waiter, I decided to also order the Lomo Saltado, Peruvian stir-fry beef tenderloins with fries and rice. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE ($28). It was basically an upscale version of Bo Luc Lac (Vietnamese shaken beef). It was bit on the salty side. I would have rather saved my money to try their potatoes which looked AMAZING. \n\nI'll return for the cebiche and happy hour!", "author": "Cindy N."}

It has a soft yellow-green lime color with 75% foam and looks absolutely refreshing. With your first taste you will realize it is powerful! So BEWARE. I had 1 1/2 and had a tum ache later in the evening. My suggestion is to go for happy hour, which is 4-6, because the drink is half off... only $5. And you can get by with ordering one glass. Get there early and you won't regret it.\n\nThey give you great chips to snack on while you wait... love the plantain!\n\nMy dinner entree was the asado de tira...aka the short ribs. The first half was great, the second half was not. When I pay $25 for short ribs I expect the selection of meat to be more lean than fatty, but half of my pieces were nothing but fat...a disappointment. The sauce and side (choclo pepian...a corn dish similar to polenta) were excellent. The greens were way too salty. I'd like a little more value for their prices.\n\nGreat busser / server assistant. The server took a long 10-15 minutes to greet us and was not around much. She was definitely in the weeds, so I'm glad the busser compensated.\n\nP.S. I thought it was weird that the bathroom is apparently a historical landmark. Can anyone explain this?

The fish was perfectly tender and the juice it was in had the perfect balance of acidity and savory flavors.\n\nCausa Casera - This was strange as I was expecting the dish to be hot given it's a whipped potato confit.

Extremely flavorful, the quinoa had a delightful texture with the perfect mixture of grain to vegetables.\n\nChorillana - The mashed yucca in this dish was very good but the fish was of uneven thickness. This caused the fish to be overcooked in some spots and undercooked in others.\n\nLomo Saltado - this stir-fried beef dish was one of my least favorites. Very one-noted on the salty side and lacked any character or big flavors.\n\nOverall, the service was excellent and the decor was modern without being trendy and open/airy.", "author": "Michael S."}

Since it's so hard to get a reservation here I figured it was a tiny restaurant with just a few tables. Um, wrong! It turns out to be one of (if not THE) largest restaurant I've dined at in SF.  It's just super busy because it's that delish.\n\nI had eaten way too much popcorn and cheese during happy hour at my beloved Press Club before dinner at La Mar so I wasn't as hungry as necessary to enjoy this delicious food. However, I found some room for complimentary chips (sweet potato chips!) and dipping sauces, empanada sampler (the de chocolo was heavenly) and a chicken skewer (yum).\n\nOthers at the table raved about the ceviche, martinis and pretty much everything else on the menu.  I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nOh, and they happen to have a lovely bathroom too. I should know because I spent the last hr of my meal in there after having an allergic reaction to something I ate. Turns out one of the sauces had soy in it (which I have an allergy to) so my throat closed up, which was no fun for me or any of my dining companions to watch.

Even better is the outside patio area facing the waterfront when it's warm and sunny outside.\n\nI took my parents here and it turned out it was Dine About Town week.  The DAT menu was actually pretty good here, so we went with that.  The Cebiche Mixto with yellowtail, calamari and shrimp was excellent (all there ceviches are, in fact).  The mixto version has a great aji amarillo leche de tigre sauce (basically hot yellow peppers in lime juice) that's a uniquely Peruvian flavor.  The Causa (yellow mashed potato) with Pulpo Olivo (chopped octopus tartare) also accompanied that first dish and was another well-executed dish.  By the way, that first plating was beautiful with its vibrant colors and delicate balance.\n\nFor the main, they had the Arroz Criollo Wok (similar to a seafood paella).  \n\nI actually went with the vegetarian DAT menu for comparison.  Instead of the ceviche, I had the Empanada de K'apchi (sauteed mushrooms).  Tasted heartier and was good ... but I preferred my parents' ceviche.  The vegetarian causa had beets instead of octopus and it paired very nicely.  The main was a Quinoa Chaufa Wok with fried rice version made with quinoa instead and topped with mushrooms, sprouts and fried noodles pieces.

We ordered items from the Dine About Town & regular menu.  La Mar's ambiance is awesome and location is prime, situated on the pier. We went today on a sunny San Francisco day during lunchtime and landed a patio seat.\n\nFood: 4.5 Stars\n\nWe first started with a complimentary fried plantains, white potato, and sweet potatoes with red salsa and  salsa criolla. These were either fried twice, or baked and fried because these had the perfect crunch and texture that you can only get doing it this way. The two salsas were very good but not overpowering. The salsa criolla was yellow and creamy from the cheese blended into the sauce. The second was more of a traditional salsa with a tomato and pepper base.\n\nOnto our menu items:\n\n1. Starter:  Cebiche Mixto Yellowtail from Mexico, calamari and shrimp in an aj\u00ed amarillo leche de tigre with cilantro, red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam. The ceviche was awesome-- not too sour from lime and just the right textures you want from seafood (which was very very fresh. One bite of the calamari and it just melted away).\n\n2.Starter:  Causa Pulpo Olivo Octopus tartare mixed with Peruvian black olives, red pepper and onions on top of yellow potato causa with avocado pur\u00e9e and finished with rocoto huancaina sauce. Very distinct taste of octopus, which was balanced well with the smooth starch of the puree. The sauce did not add much to the dish. \n\n3. Starter: Beef Empanada (Regular Menu)\nMy only complaint was the price of this dish. Empanadas are usually a cheap street food, usually $1 or $2, and is not a food to be served conventionally eaten with a knife and fork. I thought that the beef empanada should be less expensive but the dish itself was very very good. The pastry was crisp and yet fluffy on the inside--exactly what you want for a fried item. The filling was amazing--tomatoes, scallions and perfectly cooked but not overcooked ground beef.\n\n4.Main:  Arroz Criollo Wok sauteed rice with aji panca, choclo, shrimp, calamari and mussels garnished with salsa criolla and drizzed with aji amarillo sauce. \nVery similar to seafood paella. The seafood was cooked perfectly. The dish was a little bland, it left me wanting a bit more spices to the dish. But we still ate the whole thing up!\n\n\n5. Dessert:  Chicha Morada Sorbet Peruvian purple corn and rosemary sorbet. Perfect ending to the meal. Sweet and cold, but not so sweet to make our teeth ache. Very refreshing. \n\nOverall, there were some items that could've been less salty or more flavorful but the techniques used (sous vide, marinating raw fish to coax flavor), the portions, the textures were spot on.\n \n\nService: 5 Stars\nThe service was stupendous--quick and attentive but not overbearing. Our server, Manuel, was awesome and extremely helpful. And! he gave us an extra order of sorbet (we intended to share one) and a complimentary post-dessert (I'll keep what it is a secret so that you see for yourself ;) ).

I dont understand this since they weren't going to be able to sit a party after us AND the restaurant was not full that evening.  Another time (for a business dinner) they gave us grief because they said we had signed some sort of agreement.

If you aren't a regular, don't mind getting expensive, unimpressive and tasteless food or crappy service, then this should be the place for you! Hmmm...where to begin??\n\nFood:\n\nGAG! It's not authentic Peruvian food and portions are fit for the seagulls outside. My\ntraditional ceviche had halibut that tasted bland. My partner had the halibut that was rubbery which she finished a quarter of it. My lomo empanadas were the only good part of the meal. The wine we had was good and created a nice buzz for me and calmed my nerves. \n\nManagement:\n\nMy partner and I made a dinner reservation to celebrate our anniversary. The reservation specifically stated that so one would think we'd get a nice table. We arrived early and asked to be seated which he did. He gave us attitude for arriving early! The restaurant was empty for a Sunday evening. So...we were told, verbatim, \"Oh we'll seat you at a nice table in our outdoor, heated patio.\" Well if you think a small table by a column that doesn't fit the food and drinks we ordered, then it'd be a \"perfect\" table. The manager needs to take the stick out of his butt. \n\nServer:\n\nHow does this guy stay employed?!? Shane is the WORST server and probably doesn't even know how to give a genuine smile. His greeting sounded forced and he was already irritated with us for some weird reason before we even ordered our food. He never explained the menu, drinks or provided recommendations (more on this later). Shane needs some serious customer service training. If you get him as your server and not a regular or made of money, expect to get service from a ROBOT!  We had more interaction with the bussers who actually asked how we were doing. \n\nNow the table next to us was female and male. Apparently the guy was a regular, so Shane was, to put it lightly, KISSING his butt. He explained the menu, drinks and made recommendations and even the wine sommelier went to their table! This made me pissed! Shane never checked on us until he dropped the check. Even with that, he dropped us the WRONG check. We left him a less than average tip and I left a note for Shane. Management really really needs to train this guy more. \n\nConclusion:\n\nThis restaurant doesn't deserve all the merit its been receiving. Management and the servers all have snooty attitudes.

Small but interesting and unique drinks. After this, we got seated at a large table for 36 people. For appetizers, we had some amazing complementary crisps/chips with a serving of cheese and wasabi dip. These were some of the best crisps I've ever had in my life - so thin, crispy and flavorful but not overly greasy. The dip was amazing as well. Seriously great starter! After this, we had empanadas de k'apchi, which were incredible. The mushrooms were so juicy and tender, and the crust of the empanada was delightful. Afterwards for entrees, the quinoa chaufa (vegetarian) was solid. There were some Asian elements I enjoyed, with the addition of scallions, egg, soy sauce. It was an interesting fusion dish. For desert, we had an assortment, with a chocolate mousse, a cheesecake, and a tres leches dish. They were all delicious, but the tres leches really won me over.

First, I must say that those people who say this restaurant \"does not feel Peruvian\" probably mean this isn't some hole in the wall dump that they ate at either in Peru or in the Mission. The Peruvian cuisine has evolved and trendy restaurants like La Mar are the new rave all over Lima. Last summer I've went to Peru being a trendy tourist and eating at all these new age gourmet restaurants and I still gotta say La Mar is the BEST. BTW there is also a La Mar in Peru, same great taste as the one in SF with not so pretty views.\n\nEverything is tasty, amazing, and an orgasm for your mouth. Most def. Sidenote: I have difficulty reading reviews from people who never had Peruvian food criticizing the ceviche and the empanadas. Umm... have you EVER had Peruvian food? Cebiche is raw fish! It's suppose to be like that! My favorites are the jalea and the lomo saltado. you can't go to La Mar and NOT have some Lomo. To die for! Also you must try the causa sampler.

Beginning with the cold and ditsy service we got at the bar before our reservation. Our server seemed stoned and uninterested in helping us. She gave informative responses to our questions about pisco (which dominates the cocktail menu) but seemed to have nothing positive to say about the spirit her income was dependent on, and she portrayed the menu's many options as insignificant to people who are not connoisseurs.\n\n(Thought we were able to rise some human emotion out of her by ordering drinks she enjoyed.) \n\nThe drinks, when we got them, tasted great. But if the good-hearted people of Peru put any love and affection into the pisco they're making (assuming these were peruvian piscos...we're not connoisseurs so we didn't ask) it was lost on us because of our server's indifference. \n\nAfter the bar we moved to our table, where the service was friendly but spotty (I'm guessing our new server's section was way too large for him to cover by himself). \n\nThis purported ceviche establishment ran out of ceviche (or cebiche which is how they want to print it (maybe a Peruvian spelling?)). And that applied to ALL OF IT. An entire column of the menu--the one reason I think most people come here--was a non-starter. That's not a great situation for them to be in on a Friday night and a source of some pretty severe dissatisfaction for us. \n\nThe food we were able to order was a mixed bag. The empanadas were small, expensive and no where near as good as an empanada should be. There's no comparison between these and ones at Nopalito for example (Venga is still on my \"to try\" list). What was good was the beef heart skewer. Delicious! There's one bright spot on a generally poor meal. \n\nI know this is probably a good restaurant, but it's too expensive to chance again!", "author": "Luke M."}

My thoughts could be seen as incorrect by those that have not been to Peru. In my defense, I have been a couple of times to Chef Gaston Acurio's \"La Mar\" in New York City (La Mar-NY).  Today I went to \"La Mar \" in San Francisco (La Mar -SF) for the first time. These are my thoughts on what I had. \n-Pisco sour: Not sweet enough, but this could have been a mistake of the day. Otherwise the flavor was pretty good. \n\n-Sangria: Interesting use of Pisco and great flavor. Again, sangria was not sweet enough. \n\n-Sweet potato chips: They were good. What was special was the rocoto sauce (Peruvian red pepper) served on the side to dip; it was VERY good. \n\n-Empanada of aji de gallina: I did not like the aji de gallina filling. It lacked chicken and had a bland flavor. The dough that covers the empanada was quite disappointing\n\n-Empanada of lomo saltado: A bummer as the empanada above. I am sorry Chef Acurio, but this empanada was just slightly better than the empanadas of Publix by Brickell Avenue in Miami  :(\n\n-Causa limena: It might be expensive and small but dungeness crab speaks for itself. This is a touchdown for the chef. \n\n-Chicken chicharron: Decent flavor. \n\n-Cebiche chalaco: Tasted well. Nothing special.\n\nComparisons are often unpleasant, especially as I have only tried La Mar-SF once. I understand that there are limitations to Peruvian cuisine because of difficulty in getting the right produce.  I suspect La Mar-SF does not have access to the same produce as La Mar-NY. The latter was a much more pleasant experience.   \n\nFrom a business perspective. If Chef Gaston Acurio ever considers opening a La Mar in Miami, where MANY Peruvians live, he might have to plan it VERY well. If flavor is similar to La Mar-NY he has a real shot against Ceviche 105 and Francesco. If flavor is similar to the La Mar-SF that I had today, Chef Acurio might have a headache.", "author": "Luis A."}

Besides the colorful menus, there is no decoration or feel of Peru, but more a feel of down town.\n\nWe decided to order a variety of small pates to be able to try as many things as possible.  We ordered the cebiche classico, causa limena, anticucho de carne and the empanada sampler.  \n\nThe cebiche was good, classic but nothing out of the ordinary and the fish was chopped in really big pieces, nice for the portion but a bit awkward.  The causa was the real star to our meal, beautifully presented, unique flavors and ingredients put together for a great dish.  I would definitely come back for this one.  The skewers were nice but the meat was a bit chewy for our taste.  The sauces with the meat were great but the meat itself lacked a distinct flavor.  Lastly the empanadas were nice, but again nothing special in therms of the filling, and the dough could have been more delicate.\n\nThe service in this place was average at best, our waiter took our order, didn't have much to say about any recommendations or specials and he never came back to check in to see how our meal was going or if we needed more wine.  This is a nice place and the service should be far more professional if people are dropping $100+ dinner.  \n\nAll and all, I would come back for happy hour and a few other dishes to try but I have no major desire to try the entrees.

It's very classy, but still keeps a fun energy within its walls -- perfect for a Peruvian restaurant.\n\nThe food, however, wasn't as great as I expected for a place with such nice decor and with fairly steep prices. But before I get to the rest of the food, I'm going to start off with the main dish that my waiter (Jason K) suggested that I order. I asked him if I should get the Ma Po Tofu, since I was pretty intrigued to try out a Peruvian-influenced Chinese staple, but he STRONGLY suggested that I go for the Enoki Mushroom Clay Pot. I looked at him with a sense of uncertainty, but he was quite persuasive. Now, I've always had this slight paranoia that waiters are told to push certain items on the menu, not because they're actually delicious, but because they either have a high markup value or they're trying to get rid of it in the kitchen. After this Enoki Mushroom Clay Pot dish, I honestly believe that La Mar participates in that philosophy. \n\nI'm not saying that the dish was horrible, but for $25, it just really is not that good. Very faint flavors -- nothing really Peruvian at all about it. The two pieces of shrimp in there were pathetically small and overcooked. It's a dish that I would expect to be served at some cheap Chinese restaurant in Chinatown; not to be suggested so enthusiastically by our waiter. Yes, it's my fault for ordering it when my gut believed otherwise, but I just don't like it when I feel like waiters suggest a (unanimously-confirmed by our table of 7) lackluster dish, when there are so many other choices that are much better. It just ruins the experience and my trust in the establishment.\n\nCeviches (Ceviche Limena, Ceviche Clasico, Ceviche Mixto) = Each of them were okay. I've had much better ceviche at other SF restaurants like Fresca and Limon, but La Mar's weren't too bad. The Tuna Ceviche was my least favorite -- it didn't have much of a flavor and the tuna didn't seem fresh.\n\nEmpanada Sampler = Pretty damn good empanadas here, albeit a bit pricey at about $11 for two small pieces. I think they were a bit overly fried, but still tasty nonetheless.\n\nLomo Saltado = The steak was cooked a little too well done, so it lost some of the buttery flavor that Lomo Saltado should have. I also thought that it probably would have been better with less soy sauce.\n\nTallarin Saltado = Way too much soy sauce -- this dish was extremely salty. \n\nArroz Jugoso = I'd say this is probably the best dish of the night, although the mussels were a little overcooked. It definitely had a nice flavor though.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis review has been really tough to write, because I've heard amazing things about La Mar and I was pretty excited to eat there. Other than the waiter suggesting the Enoki Mushroom Clay Pot, I thought that the service was quite good. The venue is incredible and I'm sure the daytime views would be amazing. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was just disappointing, especially at such steep prices.", "author": "Roy C."}

It made it very hard to go back to work! \n\nOverall, food was delicious. We had the cebiche sampler, lomo saltado and corazon. My favorite was the lomo saltado, but the cebiche sampler was also a good choice since we got to try out all the different kinds. No complaints with the service either. It did end up being pretty pricy though... a little too pricy I thought. However, the food and overall experience was great so I wasn't too upset about it. \n\nI can't wait to go back to La Mar.

The dessert was purple yam sorbet, which was delicious and definitely sold me on the entire place, that and the service.\n\nAs for the ambiance, the place is really nice.

Either way the first time I ate here I was blown away by how good the Lomo Saltado was and how tender the meat was! It was like biting into a pillow! the Papa Rellena (appetizer)  was yummy too, kind of small tho (3 tiny papas) I don't remember trying anything else, when I like one thing I stick to it, except the dessert. Picarones here are so good. Personally that is like my ultimate Peruvian dessert. All in all I'd recommend it as a Peruvian Cuisine restaurant deff on the pricey side but worth it.\n\n**August 2017** Update, I came here last month for my brothers birthday and I was disappointed to see that several things were removed from the menu. One of them was the picarones that I raved about in my last post. Also there was a huge sampler plate that was recently removed (within the last year) and that was a big bummer. So disappointing to come back here and see that clearly the audience they are trying to reach is more of the \"american\" palette rather than focusing on serving authentic Peruvian food. Also they were out of plantain chips when we went which was annoying on top of finding out several things were removed from the menu. I might come back in a couple years to see if this place has changed but overall, I don't think its worth the price anymore.", "author": "Valeria S."}

There is also a (heated) outdoor deck which is a wonderful spot to enjoy a meal when the weather is appropriate. Really this is one of the more well-rounded dining experiences in the city without getting too 'formal' or too pricy (although its not cheap by any means).  My lunches average around $25/person, dinner around $35+, not including alcohol.  However there are many ways to mix and match the menu to get a great and affordable cross-section of dishes to maximize your experience!\n\nWhile there are other nice Peruvian dining experiences in SF, this is clearly the local benchmark.  La Mar is a well-known name with several locations in South America.  If you aren't familiar with Peruvian food, don't be intimidated- there are a wide variety of items to satisfy very mixed crowds- great vegetarian dishes as well. La Mar of course features a number of wonderful varieties of cebiche (raw/marinated seafood) featuring tuna, halibut, octopus, prawns, and other sea creatures.  They have very nice empanadas, causas, and grilled skewers- you can combine these items and have a great meal without delving into the main courses.  There are several delicious sandwiches which are great for lunch- including breaded fish, crispy pork belly, and grilled chicken.  Then of course there are a number of delicious main courses- risottos, tuna, and my personal favorite- a delicious traditional Peruvian steak dish called 'lomo saltado' featuring vegetables, fries, rice, and a touch of soy sauce- really fantastic.  Last but not least, the desserts are fabulous, in particular a warm pumpkin fritter dish I have enjoyed several times.\n\nThere is a paid parking lot across the street and sometimes street parking along the Embarcadero.   Reservations are recommended but not necessary, although most dinner times have been very busy when I have visited in the past.  I've never had a remotely negative experience at La Mar and place it as a consistent knock-out meal high atop my 'favorites' list.

The ambiance of this restaurant is really cute, the colors and the accents really make you feel as if you're on the beach in Peru.\n\nThe food was okay. The chips they served in the place of bread was very oily but the dipping sauces were good.  The food runner also let us know that one of the sauces were made with peanuts, which I appreciated, as a tree nut allergy sufferer. \n\nWe get the Pisco Sours to drink, which live up to their name.  It was sour alright and really strong.  Word on the street is that they use egg whites to make the foam. Interesting, but it reminded me of a margarita.\n\nWe got the sampler empanadas to start which came with a corn one (which was sweet), a seafood one, a chicken one and a beef one.  They were all pretty tasty but the beef one reminded me of an onion ring. The corn was the best and the dough surrounding the empanadas was a little oily but flaky at the same time.\n\nThere's a lot of options on the menu for dinner.  Two of my friends og the Cerbiche and the other got the spare ribs. They all said their meal was good. For my main course I got the stir-fry.  The rice came on the side, which I thought was a little weird, and in it was corn on steroids.  I've never seen corn that big! They had a weird taste too, not corn-like.  (I know what you're thinking, maybe it's not corn? but it was).  There were fries on top and chunkc of beef, which were a little over cooked to my liking, but they were flavorful.  There were onions and tomatoes in the gravy, which reminded me of a gumbo.  It had a lot of flavor, but was definitely not what I expected for a stir-fry (being an Asian and all).\n\nThe waitress wasn't very attentive and didn't seem to care very much about our table, which was another turn off.  \n\nThis was an interesting experience, but a little too pricey for what you get.", "author": "Marisa R."}

Make sure someone gets you the plantain chips.  Our friends bartender got them some, ours did not.  They and the sauces that accompany them were just what we needed to go with our alcohol.  I got the Ceviche Mixto (5 stars, i literally drank the sauce), the Pork Belly Tacos (not the best pork belly I've ever had, but once again, the sauce was crazy good), and the Chicken Empanada, which was very tasty.

It's not that I have any objection to expensive, per se, but the rating does reflect my impression that certain dishes were not merely expensive but overpriced.\n\nIt was really good.  The restaurant was clean and nicely designed.  Our server was upbeat, accommodating, helpful with menu choices and darn friendly.\n\nWe stopped by especially for their special Chinese New Year menu - not exactly what one associates with Peru, but they have a large Chinese immigrant community in Peru, and their own style of Chinese food, which we wanted to check out.\n\nAfter being greeted with an assortment of chips ( plantain, sweet potato, regular potato ) and a couple sauces, we started with the Cebiche sampler.  Four small plates of excellent cebiche in different styles for $34.  Fish was without exception fresh, though we did get a single very strongly flavored mussel in one dish.  I felt the Nikei was a bit sweet for my taste, but overall found it very pleasant.  We also ordered a full-size cebiche from the special Chinese menu, which was perhaps even more delicious than the sampler plate.\n\nFor our main course, we got a very saucy and slightly spicy rendition of Mapo Tofu and an Eggplant and Mushroom hot pot over noodles.  Both were nicely flavored, and an interesting departure from more familiar Chinese cuisine, but the star of the meal was definitely the cebiche.  One of the dishes was served with a small bowl of rice and giant corn on the side.\n\nWe finished with the special dessert - a parfait of fruits topped with a creme brulee flavored whipped cream in a martini glass.  It was an interesting, refreshing way to end the meal, but maybe not worth the $14 they charged.\n\nThe cocktail list here is interesting - they have many creative variations on Pisco drinks, including one flavored with beet juice.  The ones we tried tended more toward the sweet and fruity, and were fairly light on alcohol.  They also carry two Peruvian beers, Cusquena being the more flavorful.\n\nAfter a couple drinks each plus the afore-mentioned dishes, tax, tip and the Healthy SF charge, we finished somewhat north of $200.

If I could go back, I'd probably order two different types of ceviche, although they do have a sampler plate (I just felt the portions were too small to share with the hungry man I went with).  The one thing I ordered that I thought was just plain icky was their empanadas.  We ordered three different types, the corn, the chicken, the seafood, and beef.  The only one I liked was the empanada de choclo (corn).  The beef one had some strange spices that just didn't jive with my taste buds.  To be fair, however, it wasn't that they were cold, or stale, or tasted like they were of poor quality.  I simply didn't care for the taste.  \n\nThe menu has a good variety of food, and we sat at the bar, but I'd like to sit at a table next time.  The bar feels a bit out of the loop from the rest of the restaurant.  The other dish I really enjoyed was the causa limena.  The causas are small, but they're so delicious!  This would be my other suggestion after the ceviche.  I'd like to come back and give this place another chance and see if I can bump them up to four stars.  As for now, I'd say it's worth checking out.", "author": "Sarah B."}

Plenty of street parking - no reason to pay $10-$20 parking at Pier 3. \n\nThis dinner was fantastic (maybe one of the best I've ever had). Highlights included: the Ceviche tasting, causo, and an extremely friendly, knowledgable waiter.\n\nWe started off with cocktails (vamos pa' chicha for me, the special for my friend). My drink tasted sort of like fruit punch with a cinnamon undercurrent. Was delicious and medium-strong. Our waiter proceded to give a great overview of the entire menu and we decided to order the ceviche tasting, the causa limena, and the arroz jugoso. \n\nOur waiter mentioned to eat Peruvian food family style, and said he would bring our food in courses. (A nice touch, I like restaurants that don't try to rush customers). \n\nThe causa limena came out first - it was the first time I'd ever tried causa and it was amazing! Causas are combos of whipped potatoes with seafood/veggies on top - ours had crab, tomato, quail egg, and sweet sauce placed gently on top of the yellowy potato mash. The ceviche tasting was INCREDIBLE - I've been to Fresca and Limon in the city and La Mar has by far the best ceviche. There were four types in the tasting; I liked the Nikei and the Chalaco most. The Nikei had a strong Asian influence, with vinegar, sesame seeds, soy sauce, nori, and daikon added to the leche de tigre base. The Chalaco was slightly more traditional and had an orangey sauce with fried calamari on top. \n\nMy friend and I were curious about the ingedients in the ceviches (because they were DELICIOUS as I said before) and asked our waiter for more clarification. He brought out a sheet of paper with 20+ ingredients listed for each of the ceviches. Wow! I was impressed by the detailed, friendly service. \n\nThe arroz jugoso was just okay - a sweet tomato base with rice, white fish, and seafood, but I thought it was a bit bland. \n\nFor dessert, we finished off with the special dessert, pineapple carrot cake with a side of Peruvian ice cream. So good - a great end to a especially delicious meal in the city.", "author": "Melanie G."}

Look no further.\n\nThere is something very exciting about eating at La Mar. First of all, the restaurant is gorgeous - the ocean is clearly the inspiration for this clean white space with deep blue accents and of course, that is just amplified by views of the bay. The food? The plating is a sight to behold and particularly with tasting plates, each bite is like a completely new experience. I like everything about this restaurant... aside from perhaps the price. And knowing that there's a location in Lima makes it feel that much more authentic.\n\nThe tasting plates certainly seem like the way to go during your first visit and are fun for group dining, but now I just go with these top picks (also attempting to try something new each time):  \n*Cebiche - Cl\u00e1sico and/or NIkei\n*Causas -  Nikei (the standout) and/or Lime\u00f1a\n*Lomo saltada \n*Pisco sours !!!\n\nIt's a must-try for San Francisco residents and tourists alike (+perfect spot to take parents).

Since every Peruvian meal must begin with a drink, one of those unwritten rules according to my Peruvian princess, we decided to try the pisco mosto verde vice regular pisco sour.  It turned out to be an excellent choice as it resembled the pisco sour texture and taste along with the addition of passion fruit, lime juice, and triplesec.\n\nAppetizer time aka Cebiche time!  We dined on the cebiche chalaco and cebiche carretillero.  Both cebiche's included:\n* mussels\n* clams\n* shrimp\n* red onin\n* cilantro\n* cancha\n\nHowever, the chalaco also includes Yellowtail and fried calamari while the carretillero offers Yellowtail from Mexico, non-fried calamari, celery, Peruvian corn and yam.  Nontheless both were delicious.\n\nOur third appetizer was the anticuchos pollo (Grilled chicken, potatoes, Peruvian corn and salsa panchita).  Yummy for our tummies.\n\nMy Peruvian dined on the pollo anticuchero (Grilled chicken breast, avocado, lettuce, tomato, aioli, crispy sweet potatoes and gouda cheese with a creamy anticuchera sauce on an ACME roll).  I heard no compliants from her just plenty of compliments.  \n\nI ate the anticuchos coraz\u00f3n.  Hmm..grilled beef heart with potatoes, Peruvian corn and a spicy rocoto sauce.  Guess I have a heart to a heart especially since my entree was a surprise.  Once I bit into the beef I knew it was a heart as I've recalled the texture and taste from our DC Peruvian restaurant (Las Canteras).  My Peruvian Princess was amused by my reaction to say the least.  I have to admit it was tasty. \n\nIn summary, the food and environment was outstanding as La Mar foodies will enjoy the tastes of Peru while sitting outside pier 1.5.", "author": "Charles H."}

From the start, Fatima, the events coordinator, was on top of everything, answered all my questions, and really made me feel taken care of.  As the event date grew closer, Fatima assisted me with wine selections and also was extremely helpful with selecting the perfect menu.\n\nWe were seated on 'el patio al la mar' which is the outside seating area.  I initially thought this would be a problem because it is in fact outside, but it is completely enclosed and there are many heaters.  In fact, we had to ask the waiter to turn off/down the heater because it got too warm.  The table was perfectly set and there was a personalized menu with my wife's name at each setting. As soon as we sat down the wine began flowing and was paired by our waiter to the menu selections as they came out from the kitchen.\n\nWe started with cebiche mixto which is the catch of the day and La Mar's famous 'aji amarillo leche de tigre'.  This happened to be octopus and it was amazing.  Octopus, if not prepared carefully tends to get very chewy, but this was prepared perfectly.  Next we had the ensalada tiradito which is a salad prepared with thinly sliced tuna and papaya.  This was a very tasty salad but failed in comparison to the final of the first course.  The last salad, ensalada limena, was out of this world!  An arugula and spinach salad was served with queso fresco cherry tomatoes and dressed with the 'aji amarillo' vinaigrette.  This was by far the best salad and everyone at the table agreed.\n\nThe main courses included the chicken empanadas, which were very tasty but a bit on the dry side, arroz norteno, a seafood rice that left me desperately wanting more seafood, and finally La Mar's famous lomo saltado.  This is by far the best lomo saltado I've ever tried (yes better than Frescas and Limon's).  The sauce, soy sauce, garlic, and the 'aji amarillo' sauce, was absolutely fantastic.  The beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the fried potatoes were crisp and not soggy.\n\nSurprised at how full I was, I completely forgot about desert which I was not expecting to be as elegant and tasty as it was. For my wife a large puff pastry stuffed with ice cream along with a piece of chocolate cake was brought out.  For the table there were two selections, individualized chocolate ganache shots (served in a shot glass and small spoon) and raspberry sorbet served over a small piece of chocolate cake.  Both were excellent and gone within seconds from the entire table.\n\nOverall, celebrating my wife birthday here was an amazing experience and La Mar did a fantastic job with the details and making the night special.  From the small details of personalizing the menu to pairing the wines with the menu selections, it was all spot on.  The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable from start to finish.  The prices were all preset based on the menu selections and were fair.  My wife and I are already planning out next visit.", "author": "Matt J."}

We ordered some food, their ceviche mixto and a pork belly sandwich?  Well they were out of the pork belly sandwich even though it was still early.  The ceviche was very small, with one large shrimp, one small piece of fish, and lots of pickled red onion, big corn things and some calamari rings.  It was good and tangy.  \n\nThe service was bad.  I didn't understand it at all.  Bartender gave us the bill, I put my credit card in, and he just stared at it from a far.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-29", "description": "La Mar was very different than what I expected, in a good way.  For instance, I thought the cebbiche would be like poke.  I like sushi but I'm not that fond of poke.  But I like people who dismiss things without trying them even less than poke, so I tasted everything in the 4-cebbiche sampler and found it light, a little sweet and very delicious.  Especially the calamari, which was smooth and tender and extremely fresh.\n\nI was also wrong about the plantain chips.  A strip of dried banana-like crunchiness dunked in spicy sauce doesn't sound appealing at all, but it turned out to be very nice.  Fortunately more food arrived before I could gorge on these.\n\nI was proven wrong again on the empanadas; I figured they'd be a little greasy, since they're fried.  But they're not.  They're actually light and crisp and very tasty.  And I was wrong yet again about my entr\u00e9e, which sounded like your basic surf and turf, but as it turns out, both the surf and the turf were cut up and mixed together in a heavenly sauce along with some more of that awesome calamari, flanked by some very flavorful pozole and some delicious potato discs. \n\nI was very right regarding dessert.  I have this fetish for passion fruit, and the mousse dessert made me very happy.  It had chocolate on top, raspberry on the bottom, and a long stretch of creamy center that mixed very well with the passion fruit puree (after I ate all the chocolate first, so it wouldn't distract me from the passion fruit) (there was some raspberry stuff on the bottom but I was mainly interested in the passion fruit so ignored it).  My dinner buddy had the fritters, which looked exactly like donuts, with a nice chewy texture. \n\nEverything was light and fresh and tasty.  The waiter was friendly and the service was prompt. \n \nAnd finally, I'm a restaurant acoustics prima donna.  Nothing wrecks a meal like continually mishearing your dinner buddies while all the ambient noise bounces from one stark/chic flat reflective surface to the next and the annoying shrill nasal laugh of that diner seated 10 yards away sounds like it's aimed directly at your ear.  La Mar has a mostly-exposed kitchen, and I didn't even notice this fact until dessert time.  I'm sure the kitchen folks there are as prone to crashing pans around and cussing as they are in every other restaurant, but the fact that I didn't even hear them tells me La Mar is doing something very right as far as the sound level.  This is a large place, even a crowd-friendly place, but it's also a place where the ambient noise is well under control.", "author": "C D."}

We could see the lights from boats crossing by and feel a soft breeze. The space heaters kept the area warm so I was sitting comfortably. \n\nThe service was very slow.

My favorite is the ahi tuna and the halibut ceviche - they were elegantly seasoned with the right amount of lime and onion-y condiments.

Their restaurant was closed because we arrived too early, but when you are hungry - you are hungry. \n\nI ordered their Beet cocktail which was different, but nice and refreshing. I liked the caipirinha which was strong -- yes!! \n\nMy brother ordered a huge mix of dishes. Everything was delicious. I couldn't stop, but I had to. The food was very fresh. \n\nWe literally ordered almost everything from the bar menu I think.

She, in turn, was meeting up with an old college friend along with that friend's husband. The 4 of us were converging on La Mar Cebicheria Peruana for happy hour, meet & greet, catching up on old times & general joviality. For me, it was my first encounter with Peruvian food & drink.\n\nFrom the nearest BART station, it's not too long of a walk along a beautiful stretch of waterfront to the Pier 1 1/2 building in which La Mar is housed. Immediately turning right upon entering, I saw my party already seated at the nearby corner of the bar & saving me seat. Precious real estate considering how busy & full it was.\n \nThe bar area of La Mar is a modern & clean looking space employing a liberal amount of glass, steel & concrete in its design. With this sort of construction, acoustically, busy & full means loud. Even shouting conversation can't be heard more than 2 seats away. Being the last to arrive, I was the only one without cocktail. I decided to start off with one of the drinks from the Happy Hour menu, a Pisco Punch. So, if you don't already know, pisco is basically a Peruvian brandy. A Pisco Punch is: pisco, homemade pineapple syrup, lemon juice. This would be a fantastic drink on a really hot day. Though there has been a severe shortage of hot days this Summer, this drink was still enjoyable on a cold & windy evening in the city.\n\nTo help soak up our libations, we ordered a pair of Causa Tasting dishes (there's a comprehensive 'gastronomic dictionary' on the La Mar website for looking up Peruvian food terms, like 'causa') & a pair of Anticuchos de Pulpo (grilled octopus skewers). The Causa Tasting dish is a sampler of 4 causas & each had a different, distinct, delicate sauce. All were nicely tasty. The octopus skewers were tender & also covered in a tasty, delicate sauce. While chomping on the snacks, my drink ran dry.\n\nAs busy as it was, service from the bartenders was just a bit spotty for the next drink & the one after that. Trying some of the girlfriend's Pisco Sour & a couple other pisco cocktails, all the pisco drinks I had were pretty good & unlike other drinks I've had as pisco isn't exactly a common liquor. With our food & drinks down, we settled our tab & went for a short walk around the Pier 1 1/2 building. Being down by the water, La Mar is in a nice, scenic area.\n\nLa Mar is a good looking spot in a good looking part of the city. Happy hour deals are decent & bring in a lively crowd. The drinks & appetizers at La Mar were a welcome little introduction to the tastes of Peru.", "author": "John M."}

Thought the mushroom version was the best, followed by the corn & cheese, then the chicken.  The beef was pretty basic.  Not sure why they choose to fry them (vs. bake) because they were very bready and heavy.  The accompanying sauce was also heavy.  Opted not to finish all that fried food.\n\n- The Tallarin Saltado $21 (seafood noodle dish) was just OK.  It tasted more like an Asian black bean sauce than anything else.  All the fish was fried, which surprised both of us.  Swear the menu said that only the calamari were battered.  Yet, everything was fried and not saut\u00e9ed like the menu showed.  Again, it made for a heavy meal.\n\nCons:\n- We arrived in jeans and without reservations.  The hostess politely offered us the\"tall tables\", which shortly discovered are in far corner of the the Ceviche bar.  We were totally on our own like being in a restaurant that hadn't opened yet.  There were there no customers and no serving staff either.  NOTE:  As we left a comparably dressed couple was being offered our same lonely table.\n\n- The bathroom, which was a unisex room directed to by the hostess (directly across from her station) was FILTHY &  GROSS!  No one had done maintenance there for a least a day.  It was worse than a gas station bathroom.  Did not want to touch a thing.\n\nOverall:\nWe have never had Peruvian food before, so we cannot comment on authenticity like other Yelpers.  The flavors were different and fun.  But, it was pretty expensive $82 (without tip) for two drinks and small portions that were, for the most part, essentially basic.\n\nBut, maybe we ordered the wrong combinations?", "author": "Tony S."}

Unfortunately, La Mar does not do justice to Gaston Acurio's great reputation as the Ambassador of Peruvian Cuisine. \n\nWe were tourist dinning for lunch on 12/24/2011. I start with the positives; great location, adequate service, great Kobe Beef Tiradito and Causa sampler. We were a party of 4 and for one of my guests, this was a first-time experience with Peruvian Cuisine. The sampler empanada was quite bland, almost insipid.  The Cebiche Clasico was nothing to rave about and the Pan con Lomo Sandwich and the Pollo Anticuchero were sandwiches that I could have found at any sandwich shop. The Almuercito Chalaco was forgetable ...\n\nMy daughter and I had Pisco Sour cocktails, which by the time we were done with the meal I had a headache - cheap Pisco, perhaps? My daughter found a hair in her Lomo Sandwich, so they gave us a courtesy dessert sampler. When it arrived, it had lint on it, which the waitress herself first saw and was clearly enbarrassed. I declined further desserts. \n\nManagement conpensated us for the mistakes by taking the Pisco Sours off the bill, but those mistakes were not the worst part. Who hasn't found a hair in their meal, right? The worst part was the mediocre meal. It was far below our expectations for a restaurant of Gaston Acurio's reputation.", "author": "Charo g."}

Even the complimentary chips and the dipping sauces were equally tasty and unique. Every entree dish I tried was full of flavor. I felt like a pig since most people were ordering entree dishes and splitting them since the majority of the dishes are served tapas style. For our party of 5, we each ordered an entree for ourselves! But I'm glad I did, since my entree was delish and apparently everyone else was happy with eating a full plate too!\n\nService was friendly, attentive, patient and knowledgeable.

We dined in on Friday night, 13th of September 2014. \n\nWe had Empanada tasting, causa tasting, ceviche tasting, Short rib Seco. Chorillana with Cod, and Lomo Saltado.    \n\n Chorillana was good, but the fish was very fishy for what we liked, Ive had cod numerous times before and it wasn't this fishy.   \n\nThe tuna in the ceviche Neikkie was extremely FIshy. We couldn't eat it because of this.  Ive had ahi poke numerous times before which is typically the part of the ahi they don't use for sushi and filets and its never been this fishy.    \n The rest of the fish seabass yellow tail was great.   \n\ncausas all very good, but again the ahi was fishy.  \n\nIf I had to say though, I would say the Ceviche chino was the best, you could taste the ginger, daikon, and sesame, great texture and perfect balance of flavors. \n\nEmpanadas, were great. the huancaina, and rocotto huancaina were also great, very traditional. \n\nLomo saltado, very good. A little too much ginger for my taste but non the less good. \n\nSeco, incredible  very rich and filling, there was no way I was going to finish this dish.  I felt bad tossing it but my stomach was done.  \n\n4 stars to the chefs!!\n\nOur female server was great too.  she wasn't too intrusive and gave us plenty of time on the menu, and explained anything we needed.  I actually liked that she wasn't hovering over us the entire time. \n\nWe had a reservation for 4 at 9:15 under my name, I arrived at 9:25. This is why im giving them 3 stars.  the Hostess were not happy. they didn't smile. they had attitude.  I told the first host I had a reso, she said theyre still setting up our table and it would be a few minutes.  I had no problem with this and asked if I had enough time to grab a drink at the bar.  She said I shouldn't because the kitchen is closing soon. It was all in the tone, she seemed frustrated or bothered that I was there.   SO we sat down just inside the door on the couch. 5 minutes goes by which we could have had a drink and another tall host walks up to us and asks us if we have a reservation. wtf?  yes, Andrew for four. ok  give us a few minutes...... what???   the sat us right after that, but as we walked toward our table the original host was walking in the opposite way looked my girlfriend up and down and rolled her eyes.  anyway, I don't know what this was about, maybe she wasn't rolling her eyes at her but it sure seemed like it.  they both seemed like they didn't want to be there.", "author": "Andrew G."}

The ceviche is fresh and tasty and I LOVE the mix of like plantain chips and the yummy spicy dips. I'm giving three stars because once I dropped in and met two friends who were having dinner. I had already eaten, so I just had a cocktail (a jalape\u00f1o mango concoction). The restaurant was not full. My two friends ended up only ordering drinks and appetizers. I suppose for this sin, the waiter felt justified to be really rude and abrupt. He kept grabbing food and things off the table before we were done just to get us to leave. It was really sad watching him snatch away the chips and dip without a backward glance :(  On other occasions where I've ordered full dinner, this hasn't been a problem. Admittedly, if I were just having drinks and apps, I would chosen to sit at the bar. But my friends didn't do that, and that's no excuse to be rude. The people who order appetizers and drinks aren't necessarily going to spend less money than the people who order one entree.

We were seated in the outdoor patio which I loved. Secluded from the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. I loved the plantain chips that they serve in the place of bread. We shared the cebiche sampler, causas casera, anticucho de carne, and the empanada sampler. A hefty serving and all prepared to perfection. The cebiche was amazing. Trying each one is a must as you can see the differences between each one. The empanada was also pretty good. Wasn't a fan of the seafood but the rest were pretty tasty. For dessert we had the 3 milk strawberry shortcake. Different version from the standard shortcake, but edible. \n\nBest part of the night were the bathrooms. 2 of them, historic and co-ed.

I'd still recommend the place as a spot to have dinner after work or a place for drinks around the Ferry Building area.\n\nThe first time I visited La Mar I was looking for a place to have a drink and an appetizer. In our initial encounter with place, the hostess and the bar were rude to use, so we decided to leave. We decided to give the place another shot for a dinner with friends knowing that the first experience was circumstantial. Our experience the second time was in the main dining hall and it ended up being great. The food was good, but not spectacular, with the ceviche being the highlight. The drinks were good change of pace from the norm. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because I think there are some better peruvian places that offer a better bang for your buck (Limon in the Mission, and Fresca in Pac Heights). I guess that's the price you pay for a place right along the water.", "author": "Adrian G."}

His company has a list of restaurants where if we dine there, we get a free entree. It is a way for restaurants to encourage these big companies' employees to dine there. La Mar is one of them. (Regardless of the voucher, we were going to eat there any way).\n\nThe waiter confirmed that they do, so we gave him our orders. This was the first and last time we saw our waiter. No one came to refill our water. I wanted an extra drink; no waiter came by to ask if we wanted one. We had our appetizer and main course served, and no one even came by to ask if we wanted dessert.\n\nFinally, after FLAGGING down someone to get the check, I looked over and saw our waiter taking care of an EXTREMELY large party to our right. When he came over and dropped off our check (with no communication), we looked at it and saw that there is an 18% tapped on gratuity with the voucher.\n\nOkay, so you were getting tipped no matter what at our table.

This is partly true:  walking into the elegant interior really sets high expectations.  I would say the presentation is flawless and I almost feel like I can't eat the food because each plate is like an amazing work of art.  As usual, we had the cebiche la mar, plus the corazon skewers (I was able to override hubby's squeamishness and share these with our business partners from Beijing) and the grilled octopus.

The main course was arroz jugoso (prawns, clams, mussels, calamari, white fish and vegetables in a juicy arborio rice) which was my favorite dish of the night.  This is the first time I tried arborio rice which I thought was different from any other rice I've had before.  The sauce was very tasty and went well with the rice and seafood.  Delicious.\n\nEverything was good:   Service, food, and the atmosphere.  This satisfied my trifecta of what I look for in a restaurant.", "author": "Suzi K."}

Every course, and I mean EVERY course, was a disappointment. The scale to rate the tastiness of the food ranged from I-can-tolerate to I'd-rather-eat-at-Burger-King. It also wasn't just me but my entire table that felt the food was sorely out of line with the price.\n\nFirst off, the Inka Cola and Chicha Morada - both Peruvian non-alcoholic drinks - tasted like medicinal syrup than sweet drinks. The latter was worse because it contained star anisse. If you don't like yuca, stay far away from this place. I used to believe that any fried starch would taste good but I even left the yuca fries alone after one bite. The appetizers were a combination of fish and a mayo-like substance over yuca. Again, I left the yuca behind and regrettably swallowed the fish topping. Of the two entrees, the beef with potatoes was probably the best dish of the night. By best, I mean the one that I could eat more than one bite before stopping. We ended up leaving at least 65% of the dessert behind. We had a butterscotch-like substance that once again tasted like medicine.\n\nThe pros to La Mar are the service (we had a fantastic waiter) and the view of the Bay. Street parking is fairly easy after 7 pm. I am now $96 poorer and $95 hungrier.", "author": "Gwen L."}

Its a great splurge and I love the place!!  La Mar is located in Pier 1.5 (I think...), which means you're basically in a huge warehouse.  Its very upscale though and roomy.  The fixtures and basic architecture has to stay the same, because its a historical building, but it only enhances your dining experience.  You can also see the entire kitchen, if you'd like, and that makes it really cool!  \n\nWhat we had:\ncebiche nikei - made with Ahi Tuna and was really light and yummy! I loved the tuna!\n\ncebiche clasico - made with California Halibut. There was a lot of Halibut. For a second, it threw me off that it had so much Halibut, but I enjoyed it. Some other Cebiche's have tons of other stuff, but this was really just focused on the one seafood it advertises. \n\nchorillana - This is a roasted Thai fish, with mashed yucca.  Took a little bit to distinguish the fish from the yucca, but its really good.  They leave the skin on...\n\narroz norteno - Was like a fried rice. Pretty good, but it felt like an Asian fusion...or maybe its just me.\n\nensalada limena - arugula and spinach salad. Was very fresh. \n\nvegetales saltados - kind of like a veggie stir fry. Also good.\n\nI mean, seriously. Overall, for the price you're paying for all this food, its really good.  Because we went with a dinner combo, we got to try a lot of different stuff at once. Good, but it also made the price pretty high.  Our waitress was very friendly and came by frequently (but not incessantly) to make sure we were ok.  La mar also has room to fit a huge group (we had like, 15), but there were also smaller tables for more intimate settings.", "author": "Lily W."}

Sounds like a steal but if you read on, you might want to rethink getting happy hour food + drinks here. \n\nMy cousin told me that La Mar has locations all over the world and is mainstayed in Peru.  Upon going in and taking a look at the menu, I found out that the SF location is the only one in the U.S.  This added a heightened interest for my party and I as we decided to wait for tables to open up and perused the happy hour menu and decided to get drinks and a all the small cold plates to try.  \n\nFast forward 30 minutes later, we received our food but no drinks!  We were so disappointed in the portion sizes.  We realized that the plates were going to be small, but their definition of a small serving was for less than 1 person.  But I thought to myself, oh well.  Maybe America just has different ideas of what a small serving is compared to Peru.  The taste of the food was just ok, nothing to write home about- I've had better Peruvian food elsewhere.  I then proceeded to signal the waitress and ask her about the status of my drinks.  She apologized and told me that the bar is a little backed up.  I looked around and decided that yes, that was plausible since the bar was pretty crowded and there were a couple of people just standing and drinking.  However, I did notice that the table behind me who had arrived later had received their drinks first!  Because the plates were so tiny, my party and I finished our small plates in no time.  We added some chips and salsa + more drinks to our tab.  This second time around, the drinks came all in one shot, but we had to wait on the chips and salsa!  This was inacceptable given that at this time the crowd at La Mar had died down and there weren't as many people in the room.  We again told the waitress that we were waiting for our order, and she had to go into the kitchen to grab our order for us.  \n\nCONCLUSION TO LA MAR: **I don't know what was going on with La Mar that day, but I expected much better service.

I always enjoy making a dinner out of snacking and La Mar allows you to do so with delicious, seemingly healthful, sustainably farmed fish and other goodies.\n\nPisco sours were tasty but kinda small.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-27", "description": "Enjoyed a Christmas Eve lunch at La Mar with our family! The food was good but the portions were ridiculously tiny, especially the Causa. I'm from Lima and fanatical about food and in particular, Peruvian cuisine. Of the hundreds of Peruvian restaurants around the world I've personally have frequented, when we received the Causa, I sincerely thought it was a practical joke! I appreciate smaller portions at restaurants because it's quality not quantity I'm after but this Causa was not that great to be that small! For the pricing, the value for all of the food is simply not there. Granted the overhead for being located on the pier must be high but do not forget the fact that it is a restaurant and one goes there to eat not simply enjoy the atmosphere. \n\nThis brings me to my second discontent about such a celebrity chef as Gaston is around the world. I did not see one single Peruvian item on display. Peru has an extremely rich culture renowned around the world. For a Peruvian restaurant outside of Peru one would likely make an attempt to showcase something. I believe having some Peruvian items enhances the atmosphere and takes you closer to Peru and makes the entire experience more meaningful. In the Mexico City location in which I had a similar complaint, they at least had a picture of Machuu Picchu in the women's bathroom. At this location, even that small token item was MIA. I do not understand the logic and feel sad that a Peruvian of his stature feels his culture must be hidden in order to succeed in a foreign land. Should I have had the ability to be such a fine, renowned chef as Gaston, I would proudly display my culture especially outside Peru so that foreigners would see the marvels that are so treasured by Peruvians and world travelers as well and again something that enhances the entire experience at a restaurant.\n\nOne other item missing was the spicy Aji. Once again, while I concur that the general food dishes must be edible by all, a spicy Aji on the side for those if us that would like to feel the warm sensation of this fabulous tasting pepper as many in Peru would agree, should be a staple in any Peruvian restaurant. Finally, with the not so positive aspects, the wait for the Picarones would make one think they were coming form Lima and not the local kitchen. Once they arrived, I must admit they were very tasty! \n\nThe final pleasant item was our waitress who was knowledgeable and with a great demeanor that seemed uncommon to the many other wait staff.\n\nI give it 3 stars as the food was tasty! I hope he can be successful in San Francisco but I hope someone conveys some observations that I believe would enhance and grow his clientele.", "author": "George G."}

It is well ventilated with high ceilings and decor that makes you feel like you are on the beaches of Peru or somewhere beach like and Latin of course. I really love the ceviche , it had an amazing taste. There was no fishy after taste at all, and tons of zest. My overall meal was amazing but my only complaint was that our server took a long time to come take our order. It was during lunch, and my party was the only one sitting inside on a beautiful sunny day so maybe that contributed to the server forgetting about us. Most of the patrons were outside in the beautiful weather. I would  suggest this place to anyone who wants to go on a nice date or dinner with friends before hitting night spots downtown which isn't too far away from this venue. Overall, I LOVE this place and plan on returning.", "author": "Alex U."}

My heart is absolutely in love with this gorgeous city!  I've had a relationship with this gorgeous city since the young tender age of five.  I digress,  so last Monday was a very BIG birthday for me and we were blessed with fabulous socal weather.  \n\nSo to celebrate my birthday my lovely boss and co-worker/friend took me to La Mar to kick start my birthday week celebration!   This place is such a special treat.  The very minute I walked in, the place took my breath away.  Like Jessica said, this place has tons of open airy space a rare gem in this magnificent city of ours.  It was PERFECT for a nice sunny day.  I felt like I was stepping into a Carribean Island when I walked in.  \n\nWe decided to eat outside so we could enjoy the weather.  We had a gorgeous view of the SF bay..  awwww.. It was too gorgeous for words. \nWe ordered some appetizers, ceviche, tuna, some special rice which was mouthwateringly delish!  I had such a great experience here that I'm considering using the place for a work event.  Don't miss this place - you will absolutely fall in LOVE!  If you're a local and have friends visiting, you've got to take them here.  If you're going on a date and want to impress them, you MUST make a stop here.  Even for drinks. \n\nI will be back with my entourage of lovely ladies next time.", "author": "Christine P."}

The food was ok, not great and definitely not worth the price. When our orders were brought to us, many of the dishes were wrong. One person from my party ordered the fried rice and the server came by to stir the contents of the bowl. Then I see him use the same utensils on another person's bowl! Next the server took a drink order, never brought it, and claimed that he was not the person that took the order. Our $700 bill came which included 20% gratuity, tax and the SF mandated restaurant tax. Everyone chipped in and paid the bill in its entirety as well as leaving additional tip. Here's the worst part of the night... As we were saying our goodbyes outside the restaurant, our server, James C., came racing over to tell us we didn't leave enough money. Apparently he claimed we were short $50! That's impossible when we clearly left more money than required. Everyone at the table witnessed and counted the cash multiple times. Yet the server and the manager on site would not let us go unless we paid the additional $50! Well, now you have 10 disgruntled customers who will never ever want to come back. As a caution to for visitors, get witnesses if you plan on paying by cash. Or I suggest you count the cash in front of them. Something is definitely fishy with the sever... And the manager is also no help. Be warned future diners and keep your wallets safe!", "author": "R D."}

My good friend and I arrived early around 6pm so we sat at the bar area and ordered some drinks. When the drink arrived, I paid and closed out the tab. I ordered the chicha morada (purple corn drink) and it was very refreshing and tasted like pomegranate juice. Finally all my friends arrived and we were promptly seated at 6:30pm.   For appetizers we ordered the calamari, cebiche tasting, causa tasting and the ensalada nikei. The calamari is pretty tasty and crispy. The cebiche tasting consisted of mostly raw fish (mahi mahi, ahi tuna, scallop and halibut) and is pretty good. The causa tasting consisted of dungeness crab, ahi tuna and purple potatoe which is tasty. Also there is complimentary chips: plantain, sweet potato and regular potato. \n\nFor entrees five of us ordered the daily special which was steak, octopus, scallop and shrimp cooked with veggies in tomato sauce which was not bad except the steak was well done. My other girlfriend ordered the arroz norte\u00f1o (cilantro fried rice with shrimp, scallop, clam, mussel and octopus) and it was delicious. It tasted better than the paella with the added cilantro to give it more flavoring. \n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu (pretty good), bu\u00f1uelos de chocolate caliente (a deep fried dough that is stuff with dark chocolate--very yummy) and a complimentary picarones (sorted of like tempura sweet potato and pumpkin--too sweet and doughy.) \n\nThe price is not bad considering we all had one or two drinks and it came out to be $82.00 per person between the five of us since we are treating the birthday girl. This is where the problem is. Apparently they charged us for a few extra items such as three drinks. Apparently, the waitress at the bar ran did not close up my tab and tried to double charge us for the drink plus a glass of wine ($4.00+$5.00+14.00 =$22.00 extra). The server was very nice to talk to the manager for us and got those charges waive because I paid for the purple corn drink and beer at the bar and gave her $11.00 already. We felt that the waitress was trying to rip us off and was glad the whole issue got resolved.\n\nThe decor is very nice with a bar up in the front area and the nicely decorated and blue dining hall.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-02", "description": "Admittedly, I was there on a busy night (NYE), so in all fairness, I should give them a try on a less frenzied night, but here are my initial impressions.\n\nFirst of all, order the Peruvian Pimm's cocktail. Don't ask questions. Just do it. Truly a phenomenal drink...one of those dangerous ones that's easy to drink quickly because it's so refreshing BUT full of alcohol. We had to reign ourselves in after two!\n\nGiven all of the hype, I was expecting to be blown away by the food (especially the ceviche). While everything was good (including the ceviche and the kobe beef entree), the only thing that truly stood out was the octopus anticucho. That dish had a major wow factor between the sauce and the texture of the octopus. \n\nFinally, for a restaurant of that caliber, the service was disappointing. The table right next to us that was seated a full 30 minutes after we were was receiving their first courses before us. It took nearly three hours for us to get through a meal of two appetizers, entrees and dessert. (For the record, though, that actually ended up being a blessing rather than a curse because we were planning to just hang out there to watch the fireworks and enjoy the DJ afterward. But, if it had been any other occasion - especially if we had to be somewhere else afterward and were on a schedule - I would have been truly irked.)\n\nAll this said, I do think it's worth giving La Mar another go because it seems that the menu was limited for such a big dining night, so maybe I'll uncover those amazing dishes that everyone seems to be raving about. And, hopefully, they'll be served at a more regular pace.\n\nBut for now, I think I'll stick with the tried and true Limon in the Mission.", "author": "Rachel G."}

Maybe it was the awesome Pisco Sours, but this place is a fantastic bar stop. I went with two other people during an off hour right before dinner, so we almost had the entire bar to ourselves. The bar area was lit by the soft, filtered lighting of the late afternoon sun which was perfect since we were right on the water. (It sits on the Embarcadero.) They keep windows and doors open so you can smell the sea air which, as a native-San Franciscan-- is one of the most soothing scents to calm you down. \n\nThe bar was not loud and everyone could speak at a regular decibel to be heard and carry on a conversation without screaming. We ordered drinks and several appetizers. \n\nSince La Mar IS a cebicheria (ceviche), a lot of their appetizers include raw fish, but there are some non-seafood items like yucca chips, which are equally good. I ordered the causa (whipped potatoes) with raw tuna and yucca, sweet potato and platain chips. Drool worthy! Someone in my party order the Nikei Cebiche which she raved over. (I don't care for ceviche, but others in my party loved it.) All of the ceviches are apparently marinated in (wait for it) leche de tiger --translation: Tiger's Milk. WHAT?! Tiger's milk. As exotic as that sounds it's basically the fish run off (yup), lime, fresh peppers, onions, and salt. I think they figured Tiger's Milk sounded sexier than marinated in its own fish juice. (Yeah, that's how much I don't care for ceviche, but folks love it. God bless 'em.)\n\nI don't know if Pisco Sours are the official drink of Peru yet, but it should be. Be careful with this rummy tasting drink as it will hit you hard before you know it. If you're a beginner, just have one and see how you feel for fifteen minutes before ordering another one. It's a sneaky drink. The one made a La Mar is fresh and clean tasting and doesn't leave you with that headache feeling like tequila drinks. It's taste is similar to a Brazilian caipirinha except darker.", "author": "Adrienne A."}

Put on something bright and colorful, kick off the pumps and slip into some strappy sandals, ditch the Blackberry, and come away to a culinary paradise.\n\nLa Mar ain't no Lima shantytown.  Spacious and open, each room begets another until it leads you all the way to the water.  Bold blues and whites make up the room, and if you sit in the back the fire from the kitchen will imbue the room with an amazing amber color.\n\nDrinks are amazing...who doesn't love pisco? As others say, the passion fruit cocktail is delicious, as is the one with elderflower, which my dining companion ordered.  The touches are nice: zest tied to the straw, perfectly concocted, and the bar area makes waiting for your table pleasurable.\n\nIf it's your first time, as it was mine, I recommend the cebiche tasting, a sampling of their four cebiches: mixto, chifa, nikei, and clasico.  They're mostly perfect, chifa and nikei having Asian elements such as sesame, ginger, Japanese cucumber. The mixto and clasico are a bit milder...unless you bit into a habanero like I did. Yowsa. That merits another drink on its own.  House made chips of plantains and yucca come gratis with three great dipping sauces, very rich.  You must order the anticuchos de pulpo! Octopus grilled over some exceptional charcoal, served with herbed mashed potato with chimichurri sauce.  These little octopi pack a flavorful punch.\n\nMy companion and I are both love rice pudding, so when we saw rollitos de arroz con leche we became giddy.  Rice pudding spring roll topped with homemade aji amarillo and orange marmalade with passion fruit sorbet. Perfect light ending to an already light meal.  Each bite of every dish ordered was immaculate and unique.\n\nI feel like my tryst with La Mar is only beginning, because there is so much more to taste and savor, and if next tastings are anything like my first, we'll have a bright future together.", "author": "Joanna M."}

It's kinda all strange yet melds this SF hipster vibe together with South American food.  \n\nThe happy hour from 3-6 was packed.  $5 drink specials and I'm a new fan of pisco sour!!!  The caipirinha was ok...nothing like I got in Puerto Rico. \n\nOn to the food:  In honor of the Chinese vibe on the menu, our table split everything and turned this family style!  We got the cebiche tasting, causa tasting,  empanada sampler,  the corazon (grilled beef heart with fried potatos, Peruvian corn and a spicy panchita and rocoto sauce), the solterito de quino (quinoa salad, olives, lima beans , cilantro, bell peppers, queso fresco, and red onion in olive oil dressing), the lomo saltado (tradition Peruvian stir fry of beef tenderloin, onions, tomatos, cilantro, soy sauce, fried potatos) and the special fish dish of the day, California rock fish, fileted and deep fried with tamarind dressing, baby bok choy, and some other seasonings.  \n\nCan I say I'm in love with their cebiche nikei made with ahi tuna.  Very fresh, and light.  Not really a vegetarian, I don't particularly jump at trying vegetarian items, but the best causa of the night was the causa casera, it was light and refreshing!\n\nThe BEST dish of the evening was the California rock fish.  Although they did filet it, they still presented as a whole fish, in the traditional good luck style of Chinese influence, albeit, also a standard style of South American influence.  The tamarind added just that extra special hint of sweet yet tangyness to the freshly caught rock fish.  FAN!  \n\nAdded bonus, it's so close to BART that after X number of drinks, y'all don't have to worry about the drive home! Double fan!!!", "author": "Taylor Y."}

I only saw it in the light of day, so maybe its more appealing in the evening, but in the daylight, I wasn't particularly impressed overall.  I did like that the kitchen was open, but the counter is so high that you can't see anything interesting from the tables anyway.  I saw some beautiful pictures on here on Yelp, but I for one would rather the food taste good than look pretty, and overall La Mar drops the ball on this one.  \n\nThe coktails were pretty much spot on; the Pisco Sour was delicious, as was the cucumber habenaro cooler (I don't remember the precise name).  The potpourri chips (sweet potatoes, plantains and a variety of other tubers) was very pretty, but I really wanted the chips to be warm. I don't understand why this is such a problem in restaurants, get a damn heat lamp.  If you're going to go through the trouble of making homemade chips, then at least give me the impression that they're fresh! \n\nThe cebiches were all pretty tasty (we got the sampler), but the portions were really small, just one bite per person per sample (of which there were four).  \n\nWe ordered arroz con mariscos (a peruvian equivalent of paella), which was underwhelming.  The seafood was completely drowned out by the tomato paste, and overall it was too sweet.  It was the only reasonably filling dish served, so it had that going for it.  \n\nThe tacu-tacu (the evenings special) again was tasty, but considering it was basically a large plate of refried beans with a 1-2 ounce portion of fish on top, it wasn't exactly worth the $30 we paid for it.  \n\nThe broiled scallops were also tasty, but also not deserving of the $17 for four.  They literally opened some bay scallops and broiled them with parmesan cheese and worcestershire sauce, nothing more.  \n\nIn the end, we spent about $240 for four people and I left feeling hungry and without a buzz.  On top of the that, there wasn't a single dish that left me feeling impressed or wowed.

A lot of my friends and people who dine with me will say I remind them of the character Sally from How Harry met Sally.

My favorites were the cebiche nikei (ahi tuna, red onion, avocado, and Japanese cucumber in tamarind lecha de tigre) I'm usually hesitant to eat the raw stuff, but the ahi tuna just melted in my mouth.

This was my first time in the West Coast and in San Francisco and La Mar was very dissaponting. The presentation was really good, but the food was salty, way too spicy, it wasn't fresh and the service was slow and food overpriced. My mom ordered lomo saltado, but the beef was salty, the rice had to much salt and she always orders the fries aside and they were salty. They decided to cook it again for her, and this time was better, but this time the rice wasn't fully cooked. That was unbelievable! I ordered the chaufa and the taste seem odd, probably because of the salty rice and too much spicy sauce on it, but I had no patience to request it again. I can see the place has good reviews, but probably the chef and the crew were having a bad time and they really ruin our food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and waste your time and money.", "author": "Cisco F."}

Sadly, I just thought it was A-OK. \n\nThe hostess was nice enough to seat us about 30 minutes earlier than our original reservations were for. While we were seated next to the kitchen (something that I specified I did not want when I made the reservation), the restaurant itself was loud enough to drown out the noise of the open kitchen. Their ventilation must also be very good because I did not smell anything! \n\nWe started off with their complimentary chips of taro, yam, plantain and potato. The dipping sauces that accompanied them were pretty good. My favorite was the one that had a spicy kick to it. As I've never tried pisco before, I decided to go with the Waikicha, which has pomegranate puree in it. I enjoyed it a lot more than my friend's Pisco Punch. \n\nIt took the restaurant a really long time to finally get us our appetizer of Causas tasting. When it arrived, I was surprised at how cold the dish was. I thought perhaps they took so long because they were cooking it. The whole dish tasted like cold mashed potatoes with cold deli-toppings. My favorite of the trio was the Causas Nikei, which has spicy ahi-tuna on top. \n\nWhen we asked our waitress when our entrees would arrive, she said in a slightly condescending tone that appetizers are always served before entrees. Well, duh! I know that! But we left some of our appetizer untouched because it wasn't that good and we were looking forward to the entrees. She informed us that she would put in our order and that there would be an overlap between our dishes. I was confused because we were DONE with our appetizers so how could there be an overlap?! Regardless, my friend's Lomo Saltado was better than my Bass Nikei. Both dishes came with a bowl of rice (mine was \"fried\" rice while my friend's was rice rice). We were quite full and didn't touch most of the rice, but I will say that the Lomo Saltado needs the white rice because the sauce can get a tad salty. The crimini mushrooms that accompanied the bass wasn't very good. I would think that the restaurant would go something like shitake mushrooms. \n\nOverall, I was really disappointed because I had high expectations for the restaurant. Next time, maybe I'll come around for lunch, as my friend told me they have an excellent appetizer special then.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

We ducked into La Mar, and decided to have lunch at the front bar (I guess it's called Cafe La Mar).  The very friendly chef made us feel right at home, as he started us off with some amazing root vegetable chips with three (!) different dipping sauces.  The sauces were colorful, fun, and made from traditional Peruvian ingredients.  I don't know what exactly was in them, but they were unlike anything we had ever had.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered up some Pisco Sours (traditional Peruvian Cocktail) and a couple of the tuna sandwiches.  The sandwiches were delectable, and looked amazing as well!  Perfectly seared fresh ahi, served on the freshest bread imaginable, again with some magical sauce.\n\nI would have given this place 4 stars, but I have to throw in the extra because of the entertaining visual experience that we had as well.  Towards the end of our meal, another chef came out, set up shop behind the bar with a huge tub of Limes, and began cutting them up and juicing them for that night's ceviche, using a very specific technique.  It was nothing short of hypnotic, as he hummed along at lightning speed, slicing and squishing those limes in fluid motions.  He said that the technique was necessary to avoid using the more bitter juice from the cores of the limes.\n\nOverall, 5 stars for a delicious, unique, friendly, and entertaining trip to Cafe La Mar!!", "author": "Ellis H."}

But if you can't take spiciness, I'd advise against the chili salsa even though it's damn good, it's got a kick to it. \n\nPisco Sour. Pisco Quebranta, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, dash of Egg White and a drop of regional Bitter. This was pretty good, actually kind of reminded me a bit of a mojito without the mint, slightly more bitter and definitely more sour.\n\nInca Kola. Peruvian version of Cream Soda. This was pretty good, but definitely very sweet and creamier than normal A&W and even Schweppes.\n\nCebiche Tasting. (Clockwise from Top Left) \"Platter\" of various ceviches: Chalaco (Mussels, Scallops, Octopus, Calamari, Shrimp, and Red Onion in a Rocoto Leche De Tigre with Peruvian Corn and Yam), Mixto (Catch of the day, Calamari and Octopus in an Aj\u00ed Amarillo Leche De Tigre with Cilantro, Red Onion, Habanero with Peruvian Corn and Yam), Cl\u00e1sico (California Halibut in a classic Leche De Tigre with Red Onion, Habanero, Peruvian Corn and Yam), and Nikei (Ahi Tuna, Red Onion, Japanese Cucumber, Daikon, Avocado, Nori, and Sesame in a Tamarind leche de Tiger). \nThis was bomb as always. Probably because I love the different varieties of flavors and trying all of them. And also because I love the texture and nomminess of sashimi and this is pretty similar though the seafood is \"cooked\" with the acidity of the sauces.\n\nEmpanadas De Lomo Saltado. Skirt Steak, Red Onions and Tomato in a Soy and Oyster Sauce. These were bomb, definitely the best empanadas I've ever had. I loved the lomo saltado inside the empanada it was very tender and flavorful. I mainly tried this because I wanted to get a taste of lomo saltado, so the next time I come back to La Mar I'm definitely getting a whole plateful of the lomo!\n\nCausa Tasting. (From top to bottom) Selection of Causas: Sure\u00f1a (Orange Potato Causa with Panko Breaded Shrimp, Red Onion, Olives, Lima Beans, Queso Fresco and Ocopa sauce), Casera (Yellow Potato Causa, Artichokes, Asparagus, Avocado and Tomato Confit with Basil Cilantro Oil), Nikei (Ahi Tuna Tartare and Avocado Pur\u00e9e on top of Whipped Orange Potato with Creamy Rocoto Huanca\u00edna Sauce topped with Japanese Nori), Lime\u00f1a (Dungeness Crab on top of a Yellow Potato Causa with Avocado Pur\u00e9e, Quail Egg, Cherry Tomatoes, Aj\u00ed Amarillo Huanca\u00edna Sauce and Basil Cilantro Oil)\nThis, too, was bomb, as usual. My favorite is still the Limena, though the Nikei is pretty good as well. I just love me some seafood and I liked how the dungeness crab was really fresh and tasted oceany. I also liked the ahi tuna tartare a lot, definitely good quality tuna. NOMS.\n\nAnticuchos Pescado. Grilled Halibut with Fried Potatoes, Peruvian Corn, Spicy Panchita and Rocoto Sauce. This was delicious! The fish was grilled to a soft, almost pillowy texture and the flavors of the spices with the sauce was amazing. \n\nAnticuchos Coraz\u00f3n. Grilled Beef Heart with Fried Potatoes, Peruvian Corn and a Spicy Panchita and Rocoto Sauce. I'm usually a big fan of organ meats, especially hearts and kidneys, yes I am THAT Asian. And these were bomb, definitely the best beef hearts I've ever had and way better than that Brazilian BBQ place on Market. These were well flavored and delicious! FYI though, you can taste the metallic-ness of the blood when you bite into them, so if you're not a fan of that I wouldn't suggest it.\n\nPescado Nikei. Poached Sea Bass over Crimini Mushrooms, Ginger, Scallions, Bean Sprouts, Cilantro, and hot Sesame Oil served with a side of Chaufa Rice. This was bomb. Our server told us they cook it in plastic wrap so the fish stays moist and tender. Loved it! I would totally get this again, it was so good. I wish I could have eaten more of it but I was so full. \n\nChaufa Rice that came with the Pescado Nikei. This was bomb rice, even though I'm not really a fan of rice I liked it a lot. Nicely flavored yumminess.\n\nCr\u00eape De Chocolate. Chocolate Cr\u00eape filled with Lucuma Mousse and Chocolate Ganache, Meringue Ice Cream with Cointreau and fresh Orange Sauce. THIS WAS BOMB! I'm a major fan of lucuma and surprisingly its flavors mixed really well with the chocolate and orange. If you've never had lucuma before you should definitely try it, it's a fruit from Latin and South America and it has a really distinct taste that's reminiscent of maple, but it has a different sort of texture, more starchy than the typical fruit. LOVES!\n\nI wish I could give more than 5 stars because this place has REALLY good service and BOMB food. Our server made sure we were attended to and made sure the heaters outside weren't too warm nor too cold for us. \n\nI will be back soon La Mar!", "author": "Constance C."}

The server asked abruptly this question when he saw us reviewing the \"dine about town\" menu......\"are you guys here JUST for the dine about town?\"  The tone of this obnoxious waiter was telling us that we were cheap.  Within two minutes after our appetizers came, the entr\u00e9e arrived.  Looks like they were pre-cooked and that's why they came so quickly.  The beef tenderloin was so tough, salty and it was way overcooked.  The French fries were soggy and covered with sauces.  That was extremely gross.  To add insult to injury, the waiter gave us the bill without asking us what dessert we wanted.  This showed how bad the waiter's attitude was towards us just because he did not like us ordering the dine about town menu.

I'm so used to the tiny, narrow hidden spots - that when I enter a space like La Mar - I can't help but be wide-eyed.\n\nLocated on the Pier, La Mar is already buzzing with the who's who of San Francisco. Their bar area, even late at night is alive with eager people waiting for their table, and those dressed up in their finest \"business casual\" on the prowl for some good conversation. For those who find themselves waiting for their table - be sure to take full advantage of the outstanding drink menu at La Mar.  Their Cholopolitan, a cosmo with Pisco Acholado, is excellent and fruity - without being too sweet - and takes the edge off the wait nicely.\n\nSince we were at La Mar for a birthday dinner - we were a big group. Peering into the sprawling room, decorated with whites and popping brilliant blues, we kept on wondering where they'd seat us. Finally a host greeted us and led us to a private area, off of the main eating area in the back for the restaurant. It was perfect and secluded.  We could hear each other speak, with glimpses of the main restaurant, and with a gorgeous view of the water. As we peered out the window, we could see the outlines of an impressive patio deck with stacked chairs. I'm not sure if the patio is open yet, but it's sure to be one of the hottest spots in the city on a nice day (let's hope La Mar decides to serve brunch :) )\n\nOur server, was extremely well versed in the menu, and made sure to give us some superb recommendations when it came to ordering.  The cerviche sampler was fresh tasting and the flavors strong and different. It's a must try. I ordered the Halibut, which was cooked just right, and surrounded by an array of fresh vegetables. Absolutely delicious. Being that I eat every meal in a matter of seconds, it was no surprise that I was the first to finish, which allowed for sampling of the rest of table's meals. Each was outstanding. Every dish was unique, and distinct in flavor - a strong testament of the diversity and skill of La Mar's chefs.\n\nThe night was a huge success, and we all left with big satisfied stomachs, and smiles. If you're looking for a new \"scene\" in the city, and are interested in broadening your taste buds - make a reservation at La Mar. If you arrive, and find yourself with a wait,  take a deep breath and grab a drink at the bar. Prepare yourself for an electric night full of authentic beautifully prepared Peruvian dishes.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I have a real passion for peruvian food and, since I discovered it, few years ago, I must have it at least once a month. La Mar serves an upscale version of peruvian cuisine, and it has no rivals here in San Francisco. I went there last night with some friends and, as usual, everybody was impressed by the excellence of the food but, the real surprise of the night, was actually our server. He literally was icing on the cake!! First of all, he was a real peruvian, lovely accent and south american charm included! He wonderfully guided us through our dining experience, perfectly describing every dish and he even gave us a brief and funny history about food tradition in his country.  We let him order everything. First he brought us a ceviche sample, octopus appetizer and a crab potato tower (as he described the cause plate, :) ). My friends stopped talking. They were to busy savoring those delicacies and they couldn't believe their taste buds. Main course: our star of the night, brought out lomo saltado, a must-have classic, and 2 orders of lamb chops. I never had that dish before, I guess it was a special. It was simply perfect! I can't list recall all the ingredients, but I won't forget that flavor, divine! \nThank you La Mar for the usual amazing experience, and thank you lovely peruvian guy (sorry, I am terrible with names) who made our night even more spectacular.", "author": "Ashley W."}

The tuna appetizer was to die for, I couldn't get enough of it. It was chunks of raw tuna in like a sesame oil, with avocado and cucumber and just soooo delicious! The steak filled empanadas, just melted in your mouth, wow!

Ultimately, we decided to start off with the ceviche tasting which consisted of mahi mahi, calamari, and octopus in four different aji sauces, mixed with cilantro and onions.  I liked how each tasting was so fresh and lite. \n\nThe seco de cordero- braised lamb shank, served with smashed rice and bean with cilantro sauce was my favorite for the evening. Cooked to perfection, the meat was so tender it fell right off the bone.  We also had one of their regional rice dishes- the arroz norteno with calamari, mussels, clams and prawns with fried rice in a spicy aj\u00ed sauce.  So much seafood in one dish.......it was a mouthful! The chalanita came with a total of twelve tasting portions of potatoes (causas) pressed into bite size dumpling-like pieces.  Three pieces of each of the four types of causas were served: Lime\u00f1a, Criolla, Nikei and Vegetariana. I got bored of the consistency of the causas after just eating a few pieces. I probably wouldn't order this dish again. \n\nEven before finishing the main dishes, we had our eyes on the Picarones- a fried dough in a shape that resembled a doughnut, filled with pumpkin and spices, served with chancaca honey. Since it is one of the most favorite Peruvian desserts we had to try it, and it was not a disappointment at all. \n\nOverall, waiters were knowledgeable about the food, attentive service, lovely atmosphere.  The dishes had a Japanese/Asian influence....the raw fish, sesame, lots of onions, rice dishes. If you're a big seafood person, this place is worth a try! \n\nIf you read their menu, there seems to be so much history involved in Peruvian food...it makes you appreciate the food that much more knowing what and how the dishes came about.", "author": "Lisa C."}

The location, at Pier 1 1/2, just north of the Ferry Bldg, is gorgeous. You walk down the Embarcadero and enter the historic building, with a hopping Pisco bar just next to the greeting station. Through the doors is the main restaurant, with huge, high ceilings, open kitchen, and casual elegant seating. \n\nThe Pisco drink menu has a dozen variations on the Peruvian brandy. I had one made with chicha morada, an infusion of purple corn cooked with apples, cinnamon and other goodies. It was delicious, and strong!\n\nThe dinner menu has 5 pages of creations that could only come from Peru: ceviches in 7 different flavors, tiraditos (sashimi), causas (cold pureed potatoes topped with fish or vegetables), a dozen appetizers, soups, stews, rices, and entrees. The explanations on the menu are simple, fun, and full of Peruvian ingredients. \n\nLa Mar is more than a traditional cevicheria, as they also serve meat and vegetarian meals, taken, I understand it, from the menu of Astrid y Gaston's in Lima. So everyone can find something delicious, new and fun.\n\nWe tried a ceviche sampler and a causa sampler, both of which were exquisite. Many of the sauces are made with Peruvian peppers, and while they've toned it down for Americans, I discovered a small yellow chili that knocked my tastebuds for a loop. But I'm a wimp. Most people will love the spice and ask for more.\n\nWe also shared an entree called Sudado Limeno. This is a broth made from clams, mussels and a mild chili called amarillo, served in a clay pot. It is the perfect balance of sea and earth: the stock tastes of the ocean, swimming with salt and seafood, while the peppers and herbs keep the land in sight, so you float on the flavors, waves of taste washing over you. Paradise!\n\nSave room for dessert, too, because there's an entire page of treats, from picarones (pumpkin fritters) to creme caramels. We tried the Clasico Suspiro Limeno, a dulce de leche mousse that was like sipping a freshly made caramel, and the maiz morado, a creme brulee made with chicha morada (that purple corn & fruit compote).\n\nAlthough we couldn't have eaten another bite, the food was not heavy, just marvelously satisfying. And healthy.\n\nThe service was outstanding. We were greeted as new friends, and our waitress, Carlotta, was thrilled to be working in a restaurant of her home cuisine. She, and all of the staff, were excited to be ready for the opening. Since the kitchen is open, you can see what's happening. I was lucky enough to sit near it, and the energy was fabulous--at least 20 people were working fast and moving around each other, flames were shooting up from saute pans, sauces were poured, stock was stirred, plates were arranged--and not once in the hours I was there did anything seem amiss or even strained.\n\nEvery detail has been seen to well--the tables and chairs are perfectly balanced between casual and elegant, the table service is simple and beautiful, the staff are dressed so you can recognize their roles immediately (cooks with black hats, bussing staff in all black, table servers in white shirts with black vests). \n\nAll in all a fabulous experience, and since the menu is so large and varied, I'll be back many, many times, with many, many people.", "author": "Renee B."}

Yeah big dish worth the price\narroz jugoso - large jambalaya-like rice plate with shrimp, mussels, clams, and other seafood... very yummy and flavorfull, spicy but not \"hot\" spicy. \njalea- basically a different ceviche version of the appetizer. It was good, but no different really. \nchupe de camarones - beautiful soup... seriously. The look, the smell, the whole she-bang... beautiful soup. \n\nDessert - Picarones - warm doughnut-like \"fritters\" which tasted like plantains or bananas but they were made from pumpkin and yams I guess... hm, anyhow they were just right.

The only thing I would have liked was that there were a few more pieces of beef in the dish. The balance between the beef and veggies in the dish was skewed to the veggie side. My friend got a dish that was similar to a seafood paella. He loved it & ate it all up!\n\nThe chips and dipping sauce provided was very tasty.  We shared an appetizer - I believe it was the Causa limena (forgive my spelling)- basically dungeness crab on top of mashed potato pile with green and yellow sauces. I am not doing the description justice, but wow- it was gorgeous to look at and even better to eat. A mix of many flavors - so decadent. The food was so good, we had no room for dessert. Although, if they had had an alfajor on the dessert menu, I would have jumped at it. (For those who don't know what that it, it's a dulce de leche cookie which if made right, can be one of the most amazing off-the-hook desserts there is.... even better than chocolate & I'm a huge chocolate fan!) \n\nThe one thing that some folks may not like is if you have a small party of 2-4, like us (a party of 2), you tend to be right on top of your neighbors.

(Maybe I was blinded by the freakin' hot waiters!)\n\nBut let's get to the important stuff: Drinks at La Mar. Pisco sours. Pisco punch. Pisco anything. You heard it here first: Pisco is this year's mojito. So fresh and addictive. It's worth a trip to La Mar just to experience how it's supposed to taste. \n\nNow finally the food (you don't have all day). Delicious. Hard to describe because it's so unique but I'm sure the American palate will love it. All the cebiches I've tried are fantastic (Crudo is my favorite though) and the rice dishes are also terrific -- it's a hybrid of paellas and fried rice if you can imagine that -- and heaped with juicy mussles and clams (Arroz Norteno). And do not leave the building without trying the chocolate filled beignets. Imagine a doughnut hole filled with warm chocolate cake. Yeah, I know! Basically, the food is terrific. If you DON'T love the food? Then I have news for you: You're the final Cylon.", "author": "L. M."}

But I'm only knocking off one star for a reason... \n\nI arrived maybe 15 minutes after my reservation I made for my boyfriend's birthday. (Surprised him with some of his friends there. Yay. Hurrah. Hurrah. Anyways... haha jk.) We were seated promptly. We ordered our food, and it came out within maybe 10 minutes. Great. Had an overall good time, and paid then left. \n\nA few days after the meal (today), I check my bank statements, and I have an additional $95 PLUS my bill I payed for at La Mar. Um, wtf? Where did this $95 appear from? I don't think I ate THAT much food. And I certainly didn't give that big of a tip. \n\nI'm currently getting it situated, and hopefully it works out and they give me my money back or hell will break loose.

To me, it is the best because of:\n\n1. Authenticty - In which the way the food is prepared is truly focused on the traditional means of preparing and cooking the various foods. Peruvian food takes mastery to get the flavors just right when cooking and preparing, and La Mar Chefs have gotten this mastery down, which stems from years of experience of the head chef rooted in Lima.\n\n2. High quality level of ingredients,\nI cannot find another Peruvian restaurant which offers such a diversity in Peruvian ingredients. Quinoa, aji amarillo, miel de anis - these are just some of the items that can be found at La Mar. When tasting these dishes, it makes you seem as if you were in Peru. As we all know, the reason why its so hard to duplicate Peruvian dishes outside of Peru is due to the different varities of foods offered locally. The tastes of the natural raw ingredients coming from Peru's 3 Zones are simply unmatched when you leave the country, however that being said - La Mar Chef's have managed to do it!\n\n\n3. Ambience & location, \nJust to the left of the Historic Landmark Ferry Building at Pier 1 1/2, La Mar sits on the bay nestled in between 2 large piers. The cool colors and warm glows of the restaurant add to the chicness and moderness of the building. While the water is visible, it is not noted for a fantastic bayview, but rather focuses on the restaurant. The bar upon entering is almost its own mini restaurant with stool and couch seating available to order food. \n\nEither eating at the bar, stopping in for a Pisco Sour, or having a full fledged  menu in house - I reccommend this one of a kind San Francisco Peruvian Dining Experience.\n\nSome of my favs:\nLomo Saltado, Picarones, Ceviche's, Causa's, Aji De Gallina, Anticuchos, Pisco Sours", "author": "Bruce N."}

Even while entering early for our reservation, I got to enjoy the last few minutes of happy hour where I ordered myself a drink and just chilled by the bar.  Definitely enough to become cracking, but not overboard.  \n\nBy the time dinner started, we were given some sort of plantain chip that just went great with everything.  I almost wanted to eat everything with it, but caught myself in the process and immediately stopped.  \n\nDinner was delicious, except for the service.  I can understand when a restaurant gets busy and things take a little longer to happen, but my goodness, that shouldn't completely pause on your meal and delay you for 30+ mins.  Timing was not this place's strength, but foodwise, it is indeed good. \n\n-Causa - great.  The texture and flavor of the whipped potato is perfect.\n-Cerviche - so fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Shrimp was good too\n-Sea bass - well cooked with a half cooked center..just the way I like my fish.  \n-Allorz Limones - The paella like dish with plenty of flavor and zest and great seafood.  I'd go back just for this alone.", "author": "Vincent K."}

She is actually from Peru, and thus was familiar with all the styles of food we ordered. Right up until the main course, I left ordering in her hands, and we were not disappointed.\n\nThere were 8 of us who arrived on time, with one more person coming. As a result, we needed to wait a little longer for our actual restaurant table, but to be honest, it did not matter....we were seated in the lounge area, which was a lot of fun. \n\nWe ordered round after round of different kinds of cebiche, seafood, fish, etc with all different textures and flavors. I am a fan. Everything was incredibly fresh tasting, and very different.\n\nAfter many rounds of Pisco sours, a Peruvian drink made of brandy, lime juice, egg whites, simple syrup and regional bitters, I switched to margarita. Their drinks are tasty and well mixed.\n\nFinally we sat down to dinner. I was perfectly satisfied at that point, but ordered dinner anyway since everyone else was. Service remained good, and the espresso I had for dessert was fresh.", "author": "Jordan C."}

The fried potato & sweet potato chips + plantain chips were an awesome little bite to eat while we were desperately waiting for our waiter to come around to our table.  I had the traditional beef tenderloin mixed with french fries and this very light but flavorful sauce. It was sooo good! We had a few drinks, that were okay in my opinion. \n\nI loved the food, but the service was just out of place servers were bringing the wrong food to other tables. Our server accidentally broke a glass full of wine at another table. I think he just way to flustered with all the tables he was working. It seemed like they had 4 different women hostesses in the front who had no idea what they were really doing.

We ordered the Cappuccino de Tres Leches.

This was not too big of a deal, but what I didn't like was that we were then sat in one of those shared benches with a tiny table for two and I am bumping elbows with two strangers on either side of me.

It's seriously the whole package--venue, service, and of course food.  Just about everything I've had here is awesome.  \n\nYou'll start with a round of chips and three fantastic dips.  Seriously, these are free??  They're sooo good!  While this alone works as a great appetizer, you'll definitely want to try the cebiche.  If you've never had it or don't know which to get, just get the sampler.  It won't let you down and you'll find both the taste and presentation flawless.  For drinks you can't go wrong with the pisco sour or sangria.  Sadly they don't do pitchers of sangria, so glass is all you get.\n\nFor a main course I'd recommend either the empanadas or my favorite, the Arroz Norte\u00f1o.  A-freakin-mazing.  Fresh seafood, big portion, and sinfully delicious.\n\nThe venue itself is really nice--incredibly spacious and well designed.

Let's forget the awful \"white party\" that was going on on the deck where I'd hoped to sit, and the terrible dance music that was blasting into the restaurant every time the door opened. No, the issue was the manager's bizarre indifference to customer service: I gave him a chance to smooth over the party leaking into the restaurant (of which we were given no advance notification), but he just shrugged. I also gave him feedback on the way we were \"welcomed\" at the reservation desk, and that it too did not measure up to my previous experiences - he told me \"she did her job.\" When I then said it didn't seem like we'd be able to enjoy our meal and we were going to go somewhere else, he again shrugged and let us leave without making any effort to rectify the situation. Restaurateurs always complain that people leave negative yelp reviews without giving them feedback at the time, but most of the time it's futile like this, with even managers getting defensive about their own poor execution and behavior.", "author": "Gabriel D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-02", "description": "I came here with a large party for work and got to sit out on the patio to enjoy the unusual perfect sunny SF weather.  Our party of nine had to choose our menu ahead of time so we could be seated and ready to eat family-style.  I don't mind eating raw fish and I'm not picky about anything, but it's hard to find a good place that everyone will enjoy.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was how large the restaurant is.  The bar area at the entrance is really comfy and chic looking.  The second thing I noticed was the gigantic octopus in the window near the bar.  I didn't really think twice about it until I saw my coworker's horrified face.  I'm pretty sure they were all turned off right there.\n\nWe ordered the cebiche clasico and a lot of my coworkers had never eaten cebiche let alone anything raw but vegetables.  I swear I had that whole dish to myself and I thought it was excellent.  Not the best halibut I've had but the flavor was just right -  a tad of spice and the large peruvian corn.  Luckily, their salad was something everyone enjoyed.  We had the ensalada limena and boy I can still taste that one.  Perfect amount of sweetness to the salad, not too tart.  Probably a favorite for all of us.\n\nOur main dishes included risotto de calabaza, arroz norteno, and the lomo saltado.  Unfortunately for me, risotto and I sort of hate each other so I took the words of all my coworkers who ate it.  Sold.  They all loved it.   I can handle the raw, but can't handle the butta.  Anyway, I ended up eating the arroz norteno (again, my coworkers freaked out.  Lo and behold - the octopus shows up all over the rice).  I quietly swallowed all the octopus just so they wouldn't have to look at it.  Finally, the lomo saltado - a highlight, especially because it was the only dish with meat.  Unfortunately, I swear each plate had about 3 pieces of tenderloin buried under the french fries.  Definitely a delicious plate, but not enough meat for a large party.  Not everyone got to try it.  It was a great piece of meat though.\n\nFinally, dessert.  Cappuccino de tres leches.  Ah.  All I can say is 5 stars.  One of the best desserts I had an actually the only thing our group unanimously picked when we pre-ordered.  The perfect little dessert in a shot glass, just enough to make you say mmmm before it's devoured.  Sponge cake was excellent and coffee creme brulee?  Who can say no to that?  It came out chilled but my chocolate was melted.  I was tempted to eat another one because we had one extra but I really had to hold back.\n\nOverall, a great location, great food aside from the lack of meat.  At least it was something for everyone, even the ones afraid of seafood.  Service was good although on the slow side.  Definitely not a place to come if you are in a hurry.  Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Stacey C."}

I kept raving about them well after dinner because it was such a unique dish with such a sharp presentation.\n\nLa Mar is just exciting- the windows on the pier make it feel very light and fresh (which is how I feel about the food) and the colors really pop.

I recommend sharing it before having an entree. I'm not a big eater, but I left feeling a bit hungry. (Which ended up being fine- I had a nice big scoop of cinnimon caio bella gelato in the ferry building afterwards ;-) ) Had the peruvian punch: AMAZING! Also had a pisco sour.... it was small and definitely sour... kinda weird, but not bad. My boyfriend and dad ordered some kind of sandwich which looked really yummy.

The first time, I wasn't very impressed with anything but decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did. Our dinner on NYE was fantastic as was this past dinner. \n\nThe most recent dinner I had at La Mar began with my group asking to be moved inside, as the ambiance is a little better at night inside versus the big plastic covering they have when it's windy outside, in my opinion. They gladly and promptly found us a great alternative table. \n\nWe ordered some aperitifs and our food all together. The server was super friendly and helpful and he also told us what sort of order he had in mind for our different courses. I couldn't agree with his suggestions more. Although excellent in theory, the dishes did not come out in any such order. We didn't even get our before dinner drinks before the food :( \n\nWe ordered so much food that I won't get into the details of what came out when instead of when it was supposed to come out, but let's just say it was VERY backwards. However, the annoyance of the chaotic order dissipated with each delicious bite. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nCeviche Sampler \nCausa Limena \nEmpanada \nEnsalada Limena \nLomo Saltado \nBlackened Sea Bass (one of the specials) \nPicarones \nTapioca de Maracuya \n\nEverything was absolutely fantastic! It's hard to pick my favorites because everything was SO good, but I would have to say the causa limena, the beef empanada, the lomo saltado, and the tapioca de maracuya were at the top of my list.\n\nAll in all, great food & drinks, lovely ambiance, and friendly service.

My uncle who has traveled the world was thoroughly impressed by the originality and presentation. \n\nMy husband and I had something very similar at this place called Osaka in Buenos Aires, which is a very happening place filled with celebrities. They are also opening one in LA. Comparing the food, Osaka definitely has some high notes and low ones. The dishes in La Mar are all consistently good, but not as good as some of my favorites at Osaka. so I would give 4 to the food.\n\nOn to the service. We had 9 people, seated by the terrace in the back. The setting was great with heat lamps above us and also very private. My mother in law and grandmother asked for hot water, which made the bus boy confused and brought out way too many hot water cups and took away some water glasses that other people wanted. It was just very confusing overall for a long time. Since the portion were small, we asked for suggestions on how much to order. We ended up with way too much food and we actually didn't order as much as the waiter suggested. At the end, they charged us for my grandmother's birthday sorbet thing, which we thought would be on the house like most restaurants do. especially we made reservation and they knew it was for her birthday. \n\nthe last disappointment was an entire order of chicken skewer was missing from our take out box. the food was good, so I was looking forward to the take out box for lunch today. it's just rather disappointing to me that our food is not there.

This place was recommended by a friend so I over looked the poor ratings about service already on yelp and I overlooked the variable ratings on food quality. I wish I hadn't. The DMV and IRS provide exemplary service compared to this general manager and his hosts. Instead of listening to our issue, the Zoolander General Manager placed one hand on his hip and said \"I don't have to listen to this. The server did her job and explained the menu when she got here. You'll have to go somewhere else.\" He then took the menus from us and walked away. I am not joking or exaggerating. This is exactly what happened! \n\nZoolander actually did us a favor.

Slanted Door is a phenomenal place! \n\nChoose La Mar only if it's the last restaurant in the entire city, if you don't care about service and if you think you're lucky to get in the place as this is exactly how they will treat you.

If you don't believe me, look at the proportional representation of cuisines in the food section of any good bookstore, or count how many $$$$ restaurants are Chinese, Mexican or Indian in the Zagat's Guide.  Sorry, NYT's food critic - you got your review of this restaurant dead WRONG.  \n\nWe just got back from Peru two weeks ago, where we tried one of Gaston Acurio's other restaurants.We had dinner at LaMar last night and were not disappointed.  \n\nLaMar is located in a beautiful setting with a promenade leading to the seating area, gorgeous succulents, and great food. I ordered gluten-free and didn't feel deprived at all.   We topped off the meal with Lucuma Panna Cotta  which had a wonderful contrasting degrees of sweetness & textures.  (Lucuma is a fruit from the rainforest known as the \"Inca's last gold\").  \n\nAfterward, the young , charming, Japanese-Peruvian executive chef, Diego Oka, came out to chat with us about the food. Then we took the cable car home for the perfect San Francisco date.\n\nPeruvian food is a world class cuisine in it's own right - with amazing new flavors, textures, and combinations with novel ingredients. Peruvian cuisine has at least two advantages:\n\n1)   A lush, fertile environment where 28 of the world's 32 microclimates are represented leading to a tremendous BIODIVERSITY of edible plants and seafood available year around.  There are a wide range of peppers, potatoes, maize, fruits and shellfish (not commonly known in the US) from the Andes to the the rainforest to the coast where the cold Humboldt current meets the warm waters of El Nino. LaMar ships many of the special ingredients directly from Peru as they're not available here.\n\n2) The innovative fusion of traditional Andean cuisine with the food of later  immigrants -  Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.  - led to classic Peruvian dishes like ceviche (heavy Japanese influence) or lomo saltado (beef & red pepper stir fry with a Peruvian twist).\n\nEat here and decide for yourself.", "author": "Raine L."}

Everything we had was quite tasty and there are a lot of choices on the menu.\n\nThere were four of us and we started with two cebiches and one causa dish.  The cebiche carretillero (shrimp, octopus, calamari, mussels etc) and the cebiche nikei (predominantly ahi tuna with cucumber and avocado) were both light, fresh and quite nice!  We tried the causa tasting at the server's recommendation to try a few different tastes and this dish was a lot of fun.\n\nWe each then had our own entree - I tried the arroz jugoso which reminded me of seafood paella.  \n\nIn the end, I felt like everything I tried was delicious - there were so many things on the menu that looked great so I'll have to go back to try more.\n\nReason I wouldn't give 5 stars is the restaurant is quite large and can get hectic...we would lose our server sometimes and try to have another server get a message to him.  It didn't work out too efficiently.", "author": "Janelle C."}

He said he wanted to try something different.  I kept in mind the fact that he has recently acquired particular tastes over the last few years when it comes to food.  I figured we'd try something that even I haven't had yet, so I told him let's try Peruvian.  I turned to my first resource (Yelp! of course) and the reviews on here convinced me to make a reservation.\n\nBoy howdy, I am sure glad that we did.  The food here is fantastic!  Fresh, delectable, tasty...name just about any superlative and it pretty much applied.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and was more than a willing guide to us.  Unfortunately, we did not have dessert (it wasn't that we were super stuffed, however we were satisfied) because we all agreed to grab a couple of scoops at Humphry Slocomb, but the descriptions for their desserts did look quite good.  \n\nI will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Ree-och G."}

I ended up being very disappointed in the quality, variety, and flavor of the food, not to mention how the different items were timed with one another. \n\nOur entradas were all very good, and were on par with my previous experiences at La Mar. However, I was disappointed with both the main courses and the dessert. I was surprised that the Jelea was considered a main dish (from the description, it was not was I was expecting). It was overly fried, dry, and the tarter sauce, which was good, was barely enough to go with half of the plate. We had nearly two full plates left (out of three plates) of the Jelea at the end of our meal. Also, seemed very bizarre to me to deep fry clams and mussels (with their shells). \n\nThe sides also were also oddly timed with the meals. The ensalda limena (which came out with our mains) was no more then a simple mixed green salad, 2 cherry tomatoes, and some crumbled cheese. From the description, I was expecting something more. While the quinoa salad (which was very good) came out at the same time as the causas - which was odd given it was two items with quite a bit of potato (flipping when each of those were served would have made a lot more sense to me). \n\nLastly, the dessert was remarkably under whelming, and more honestly, was barely touched by the group. I've never had dessert at La Mar, so I don't have anything to compare it to.\n\nWhile I realize much of this was on me for not choosing the options well for the group, for a $65 menu, I would expect that all of the options would be on par with one another. \n\nI rarely complain, however bringing together  a group of international guests for this dinner, I was rather embarrassed by the quality/diversity of the food relative to the cost. \n\nHaving previously placed La Mar high on my list of where I take guests to when visiting San Francisco, I unfortunately don't expect to be back to La Mar in the future.", "author": "B M."}

I wanted Peruvian food and the fantastic flavours that were in my mind since I visted to La Mar in Santiago, Chile. This San Francisco's branch of La Mar didn't let me down. \n\nWe began with Pisco Sour (por supuesto!) and cheered to the taste of that heartwarming drink. Also ordered a Cebiche Mixto and Empanadas de Lomo Saltado as starters... the cebiche was fine, maybe a bit short on spices, but the empanadas were superb. The intense aroma of lomo saltado's sauce filling a very soft fried dough that perfectly paired with the tartness of the cebiche. Excellent way to begin. We were hungry so we accompanied the started with a complimentary basket of plantain and potato chips and a couple of sauces. By the time the entrees arrived we were kinda full, but that didn't stop us from enjoying almost all the delicious Salmon Fusion with coconut milk, shrimps and the mouthwatering taste of soy and oyster sauces, and the mix of seafood and sirloin in its lomo saltado sauce with a sort of risotto with beans on the bottom. Both dishes were succulent and large for having them after starters, but this was a special occasion so we enjoyed, and deal with it! To finish we only ordered espresso, however the server also brought complimentary small shots of arroz con leche. So nice and delicate detail!\n\nOverall, this restaurant worth the visit. Although a bit pricy, you get a good experience at dinner. There is a lot of space, nice decoration, high ceilings, an open kitchen (with view to the occasional flames from the stove!), and separate rooms for bar and dinning. The products are fresh and the dishes are an excellent version of modern Peruvian cuisine. Completely recommended!", "author": "Florencia G."}

The abundance of whitewashed surfaces give it a seaside feel, including the bathrooms.  They've also got a nice deck that overlooks the Bay which I'd imagine would be pleasant on a sun-filled afternoon.\n\nFOOD\nArt on a plate.

A delicious bed of arborio rice with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and fish with a surprising tangy spice.

The ceviche then was superb, in general the food at that time tasted so good that surpasses even authentic Peruvian food mainly due to the high quality of ingredients they used. E.g., magi mahi to make ceviche. During those first months La Mar employed sophisticated waitress and waiters that were Peruvian and took pride in explaining the guests the sophisticated ingredients involved in the preparation of Peruvian dishes. Regrettably Now I feel compelled to warn people to not go to this place expecting good Peruvian food anymore. Nowadays La Mar is not a good a place to eat good Peruvian food. The menu has been turned into some weird ethnic concoction that is not palatable e.g., Empanadas with \"guacamole !!!!\"  The pisco sour has hardly any pisco flavor because they put so much ice in it. It tastes like water with a gooey foam on top. The ceviche mixto has an orange color that is not discernible ! No, The food does not taste good. The portions are ridiculously small. The waiters are from different ethnicities and are not familiar with the ingredients or have even tasted the menu for what they say. I had to spell cancha and even explain what it was. I wonder if Gaston Acurio knows how bad things have become in this place. Today I felt  embarrassed to have insisted that some friends go and visit La Mar as a way to introduce them to what I thought was going to be a wonderful culinary experience . I give this place a 1 star only because of its location and ocean view. But ... Please by no means go to La Mar expecting to taste authentic  delicious Peruvian food. I hope they do something about it. It use to be a wonderful restaurant. Moreover, I visited La Mar last March for my birthday and I was so disappointed.  the food and also the drinks were terrible then , but I excused all thinking that it had to be an isolated incident . Today I have confirmed that this restaurant has lost all the stars they received in its beginnings for the quality of the food and service. C'mon ..... please do something about it.

My fianc\u00e9 is from Peru, so we thought to try La Mar since it's a famous Peruvian restaurant in the city.  We have tried plenty of other Peruvian restaurants in the city, such as Mi Lindo Peru, Limon, etc. We also heard La Mar is overpriced and not as authentic; hence haven't tried until now, but we thought to give it a try.\n\nWe got to the restaurant, the ambience was great, located at the Pier, nicely decorated and overseeing the bay.  First, we realized some of the special are not available during the weekend; we were sad, but realized it could be our timing.  My fianc\u00e9 works for Oracle and get an Oracle rewards card, which gives some incentives for different venues.  We looked online and saw that it gives a second entr\u00e9e for free after ordering the first entr\u00e9e at La Mar.  When we ordered, we asked the waitress, since we are ordering three entrees, does that mean we get the second entr\u00e9e for free OR if we order a forth entr\u00e9e, we also get that for free?  Without hesitation, she replied, \"I think you get the forth entr\u00e9e for free as well\".  So, we thought it would be a great opportunity for us to explore more entr\u00e9es and ordered the forth entr\u00e9e.  \n\nThe food was okay.  It was a fusion between Peruvian, Asian and American -- nothing special.  I've definitely had much better else where in the city.  But to our surprise, when the bill came, we were charged for the forth entr\u00e9e. We called the waitress over and explained our confusion.  Only to get the explanation, \"oh, I guess I was wrong\".  She didn't apologize at all for her mistake and told us we could speak to the manager if we wanted. So, we thought it could be a mistake, so we decided to speak to the manager.  The manager came over, stood over us with an intimating stance and asked us, \"is this the first time you used your Oracle card?\"  I was flabbergasted at how we were treated!  Not only did we not touched the forth dish, we ordered it under the assumption that it was complementary!  At this point, it was not about the money, it was about the principle that the waitress was the one who just flat out told us it was going to be complementary!  After a not so pleasant conversation with the buffoon of a manager about the situation, without a word, he simply took our forth entr\u00e9e away and then took it off the bill.  \n\nThe service was horrible!  We were treated as if we were the ones lying.  At no point did they apologize for misleading us.  They didn't care if we enjoyed the experience and the manager was clearly trying to just make us pay for something we didn't intend to order.  \n\nThere's much better Peruvian restaurants in the city.

I sampled the ceviches, causas (this is something new and unusual -- see the pictures to get an idea), empanadas, and lomo saltado, and I feel I got a decent chance at a variety of foods here.  The only surprising thing was the very tender lomo saltado (grilled beef with fried potatoes on top) -- mostly surprising because most other places use lesser quality cuts.\n\nPrices are also a bit high for what it is.

It was 2 blocks away from the Mira Flores motel I was staying. I stopped by for dinner one night and it was closed, undeterred, I went back next day for lunch and it turned out to be one of the best meals in Peru. I remember sitting there thinking how this place would totally work back home: the casual yet contemporary decor plus the fresh and tasty fare.\n\nFast forward, there it was. I have visited a couple times in the last couple of years and  enjoyed it on both occasions. Another bonus, now that the menu is in English, I don't have to guess what I am eating. (I had the 5 ceviche samples in Lima because that was all I could manage in Spanish.)\n\nThe azure themed decor was the same but definitely more upscale. The service was very friendly and once the manager came to say hi to every table (this being early evening on a week night, the place was not filled).\n\nI was more than happy to see the same chips and dips were served, because they were addictive!\n\nThe avocado and crab was fresh, light and delicious. The steak was nice medium rare as I liked, smothered with a flavourful sauce. The puprle potato, while tasting the same as the common variety to me, was a nice visual.\n\nI don't normally drink but the cocktail menu looked enticing, if a bit gimicky. Of course there was the pisco sour and it tasted great.\n\nIt's definitely authentic Peruvian food, except not having cuy or alpaca on the menu.", "author": "Cindy B."}

Sour and tasty, almost as good as a margarita! \n\nThey give complimentary chips as well, plantain chips (sliced really thin), sweet potato, and regular potato chips. Comes with three sauces: spicy, mustard, peanuts. Really liked the spicy. \n\nWe ordered the Causa tasting, it had three kinds: \n- causa lime\u00f1a: Dungeness Crab, avocado pur\u00e9e, quail egg, cherry tomatoes on top of yellow potato with aj\u00ed amarillo Huanca\u00edna sauce and basil cilantro oil\n*This was refreshing and light. The quail egg isn't raw, it's just hard boiled and a little slice of it. The crab was super fresh so it was delish! \n- causa nikei: Tombo Tuna tartar and avocado pur\u00e9e on top of whipped purple potato with creamy rocoto Huanca\u00edna sauce topped with Japanese nori\n*This was my favorite. It had a little kick to it. \n- causa casera: Artichokes, asparagus, avocado and tomato confit on top of yellow potato with basil cilantro oil\n*This was ok. I'm not a fan of just a veggie item, I like some kind of meat so it was ok. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the cebiche tasting, it had four kids: (*Beware the habenero, it's good in small doses but don't pop it into your mouth*)\n\n- cebiche cl\u00e1sico: California Halibut in a classic leche de tigre, red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam\n*This one was ok. I didn't care too much for it because it was so simple. It was very clean tasting and refreshing. Maybe I should have started off with this one... \n- cebiche chalaco: Yellowtail, mussels, clams, shrimp, red onion, cilantro and cancha in a rocoto leche de tigre topped with fried calamari\n* This really tasty. The fried calamari gave it a different pop with the cooked calamari. I didn't get any mussels or clams though... just the shrimp. Not a big thing to complain about but I know one of the girls I ate with did in her tasting dish. I was cheated... sorta. \n- cebiche mixto: Yellowtail from Mexico, calamari and shrimp in an aj\u00ed amarillo leche de tigre with cilantro, red onion, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam\n* The flavors weren't there for me. But the other girls liked it a lot.\n- cebiche nikei: Tombo Tuna, red onion, Japanese cucumber, daikon, and avocado in a tamarind leche de tigre\n*My favorite one.

My review is more about the overall experience and the value, rather than about the quality of the food. The quality is good. \n\nWe had a reservation for 5:30pm, but we were not allowed to sit near the windows (overlooking the bay) because they said that the window tables were only for parties of four. They also would not let us order anything off the happy hour menu and take it in the dining room, which is understandable--but at the same time they said that if we ordered something at the bar, then we would lose our table in the main dining room. Therefore, we ended up having to spend a lot more for the beer (at the table) than we could have by taking advantage of the happy hour, which lasts until 6pm. I thought they were really too controlling about that.\n\nSecondly, the waitress was kind of pushy about trying to get us to order drinks and cocktails even though I clearly stated that I only wanted water. It was annoying, since the food itself was plenty expensive for the portion size, and if I say I want water, then I actually do want water and not a pisco sour or a non alcoholic cocktail.\n\nThe portion sizes are small. The causas consist of two small potato cakes with some topping on them. At $10-12 per causa plate, you are essentially paying $5-6 for a large spoonful of mashed potatoes with a small amount of fish topping. Delicious, but super over priced.\n\nIf a restaurant is going to charge me $10-12 for mini appetizers, and $20-30 per plate, then I am at least going to want to have a good view and a superb waitstaff. The view from the middle of the dining room was not great, and no better than any other restaurant in SF. I would say go to the happy hour and save your money.

Our server was constantly MIA, several people actually got up to ask if there was service in the lounge. When she finally appeared, she ignored us completely. Our drinks sat in front of us, empty, for well over 10 minutes. When our food arrived, it cold and pretty obvious that it had been sitting in the kitchen long after it was prepared. The best part was her attitude - which you can probably guess wasn't apologetic...it had more of a \"what do you want now?\" tone to it. That's a winner. \n\nFor the caliber of the restaurant, the service falls painfully short.", "author": "Megan C."}

There are big glass windows opening up the view of the pier/bay/etc. The ceilings are high which make the place feel big (but it is actually big to begin with). There's a blue x hardwood theme going on here. \n\nOur waiter was not very attentive. I don't think he came to our table to check up on us once. I don't know why we still tipped at all (no service = no tip right?). \n\nNow onto the food! The give you complimentary dipping sauces and chips (banana chips, sweet potato chips and normal potato chips). Loved the banana and sweet potato chips and wished the whole basket was primarily these two (the basket was primarily potato chips which were still good). As a starter, we ordered the cebiche classico and I'm not really a fan of cebiche. My two coworkers loved it though so lets just take their word for it. Our entrees included the market fish, tallarin saltado, and lomo saltado. The fish was good and cooked just right. Flavorful and crunchy. My only gripe exists with the other two dishes. The tallarin saltado was far too salty. It felt like I was drinking soy sauce as I was eating this. The lomo saltado had amazing meat, but the \"fried potatoes\" are literally french fries. They felt and tasted like they were the premade/frozen french fries that you can get anywhere. I would think that at an establishment such as this, fried potatoes would be something more than just french fries. \n\nOverall the place is very pleasing to the eyes, but the food and service is lacking.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

And then this awesome genius added chiles, cilantro, onion and garlic. I bow down to you oh ceviche inventor. You are god-like. You make me want to go to Peru RIGHT NOW just for the ceviche. Bring me that halibut and squid ceviche with a side of plantain chips. To hell with Machu Pichu. I'll see it if I have time. \n\nIt seems so simple, and yet, so few restaurants can actually do justice to this magical food. Fresca is one such place. And now, so is La Mar. \n\nIncredible. This is one of the few times I wish there was a 6th star.  \n\nThe surroundings: Elegant, without a hint of pretension. Hip, without hipster. I love the vast, high ceiling thing, and the blue lit ceviche bar.\n\nThe food: We had the ceviche sampler and I fell in love with the mixto ceviche, which is mahi mahi and calamari. The spicy skirt steak skewer was also excellent, and the salad with papaya, j\u00edcama, pickled carrots and daikon, crunchy quinoa, and corn is making me hungry just writing the words. \n\nThe service: Even better than the food. As some of you know, I don't have a lot of patience for poor service. Said another way, I'm a demanding asshole.\n\nBut I could find nothing to bitch about. It was peak dining hour on a Saturday night, and the service was perfect. The waiter showed up to take drink orders within a couple of minutes. Just to go with the whole Peruvian theme, I tried to order a bottle of Peruvian wine. He was pretty wine knowledgeable, and politely talked me out of it, instead suggesting a Chilean wine if I really felt the need to keep with the South American thing. \n\nHe was there when we needed him throughout the evening, never trying to push too much food on us, and offering his opinion when asked. We ordered in stages, but it didn't disrupt the flow of our meal, and we never found ourselves wondering when the next course would arrive. \n\nI love the location too, right on the Embarcadero. After dinner we took a pedi-cab down to Pier 23 and saw a fun reggae band until it was time to stumble back to BART for the ride home. \n\nAwesome. I love you Oakland, but my new favorite restaurant is on the west side of the bridge.", "author": "Jay Z."}

The original La Mar in Lima is absolutely delicious and i was sure this was going to be the same.\n\nThe first time i went, when it first opened back in October 2008, it was all that i had hoped for.  Delicious food.  It was a bit of Per\u00fa in San Francisco and our peruvian palates as well as our hearts were completely satisfied.  Very pricey, but this wonderful journey to peruvian deliciousness was well worth it.\n\nMy last visit to La Mar, about a year ago, was a disappointment.  The cebiche was okay.  My favorite drink (Maricucha) was not made right.  The anticuchos were bad.  The lomo saltado was very good, fortunately.  The suspiro a la lime\u00f1a was okay.  But this is La Mar, this is Gast\u00f3n Acurio's restaurant, i am not paying for okay food, i am paying for excellent food.\n\n  I haven't gone back since.

I wish I could move into La Mar with it's huge windows and view of the water.... so upon walking in I reallly wanted to fall in love with this place.  Like most other times when I want to fall in love, it fell short of my expectations.\n\nFirst, the ceviches were really watery and although they listed a ton of ingredients, it seemed like all octopus.  The rest of the dishes were mediocre (had a special rib-eye steak that was overcooked and served with potatoes that were too hard to cut).  The winning dish (according to the bf) was the special coconut covered fried shrimp appetizer served with mashed yams.  That is unfortunate considering it was identical to any kind of coconut encrusted fried shrimp I have ever tasted.  The empanadas with tri-tip (I believe) were good, but only because of the accompanying dipping sauce or else it would have been bland alone.\n\nI do want to say, though, that dad was obsessed with the ceviche and the empanadas.

I am never displeased, disappointed or sad when I leave Pier 1 1/2.\n\nMy last and probably fondest memory of La Mar was a few weeks ago on a very rainy Sunday.  I went here on a whim, without having made any reservation in advance, and nervous that we might be turned away. \n\nTo my delight, my date and I were magically seated in the outdoor heated patio overlooking the exceptional waterfront views.  We passed our time with good conversation and amazing food and drink under the rain.  Our experience was bolstered by the friendly service and feeling of familiarity, almost intimacy that you receive when dining here.  \n\nFor starters we enjoyed the anticucho de pollo skewers with the heat of the salsa balanced by the sweetness of the corn and split the lomo saltado, which is just really hard to describe how good it is, as each of the unique flavors offer complements to one another.  After a few cocktails and a bottle of wine, we finished the evening off with the chocolate beignets.  If you are a chocolate lover, these truly are a must try.  I owe my co-worker for introducing me to these heavenly desserts.\n\nAs I ended my evening on that particular Sunday, we actually closed the restaurant down and left before they would have politely asked us to leave.  Perfect end to a perfect dinner, captured by a perfect night.\n\nDining at La Mar always provides an environment to create long lasting memories whether it is with friends, family or even dates.

I did like how they give you the mix of chips with the 3 different sauces to munch on though.\n\nService was a bit slow, but courteous when our server was present.

Fast forward to me being back in San Francisco and craving some tasty peruvian eats...\n\nLa Mar is the kind of restaurant that may be common in other cities but is sort of a rarity in SF.  The first thing you notice is that it's big.  Like really big.  There's bar seating, kitchen seating, a ton of tables in the middle area and then there's a separate chef's table for big parties that's off to the side.  It's loud, bustling and you almost feel like you could be in NYC or LA.  And maybe it's because the restauranteurs are international superstars who pull from a playbook that defies our hyper-local, micro-hood driven culture.  But whatever it is, just walking in the door, you know this is not your typical SF joint.  \n\nit's relatively posh but can totally deal with the San Francisco casual crowd as well.  I've been there a few times and have worn: \n- a short party dress with sky-high heels \n- my \"fancy\" jeans and a button down shirt\n- my \"unfancy\" jeans and a hoodie and my sauconys\n\nIt caters to downtown 9-5ers, marina daters, foodies, tourists, and people just looking for a quick tasty bite to line their bellies before enjoying the amazing passion fruit pisco sours.\n\nThe food is delicious - the specials change regularly but you can't go wrong with any of the ceviches, the lomo saltado, the empanadas, or any of the soups.  Everything has nice clean Peruvian flavors - good use of spices, but not overly spiced (if that makes sense).\n\nI have two relatively minor gripes: the prices.  It's a really expensive place to eat and it's not like you can order intelligently and make it cheaper.  If you come here, plan to drop some serious cash on dinner. \nSecond gripe is that the servers have a bit of attitude going.  Not sure what that's about but it reinforces that there's something decidedly un-SF about the place.  LA? NYC? Sure, I totally expect snotty service.  But in SF?  i'm just not feelin it.", "author": "Melissa Y."}

It's very spacious, with dark dark dark wood furniture with a very vibrant pop of blue on the chairs. It made me feel as though I was transported to a beachside restaurant in Latin America somewhere... Or maybe i've just got a great imagination. Anyhow, the interior made me think of the ocean, and being somewhere far away. I love love love the matching blue lighting underneath the bar as well. It is only turned on at night so I didn't get to see it the time I actually dined there.\nOkay, now on to my dining experience.\nEverybody orders this: causa tasting - limena, criolla, nikei, casera. It's the multicolored thing that keeps popping up in all the photos. To be honest, the best was the nikei one. It was yummmmy and had the most flavor out of all 4. Everything else? Flavor was lost in the mashed potato.\nBe sure to check with your server on the specials of the day (there's also a board so look for it!). I ordered: Cebiche criollo (special) - mahi mahi, Japanese octopus, calamari, celery, habanero, garlic, claims, ginger, red onion in classic leche de tigre and it was good, damn good. It gave Limon a run for its money.\nanticuocho de pulpo - grilled octopus skewers, herbed mashed potato w/ chimichurri sauce and aji panca was very very tender, like chicken! not chewy or rubbery at all pretty good\nanticuocho de carne - grilled skirt steak, potatoes, peruvian corn w/ spicy panchita & rocoto sauce was pretty tender, especially for skirt steak. Seriously DID NOT like that spicy panchita sauce though. It was all heat and no flavor.\nanticucho de corazon - grilled beef heart w/ potatoes, Peruvian corn, spicy panchita and rocoto sauce very good as well.\narroz norteno - N. Peruvian seafood combo w/ mussels, shrimp, octopus and fried rice w/ cilantro and Huancaina sauce VERY NASTY. this dish was recommended by our server and unfortunately, all three of us hated it. We eached spooned some into our plates and into our mouths. The rest went untouched. I also hate cilantro so I don't even know WHY I thought it would be acceptable, hahaha\nMy absolute favorite dish of the night was: asado de tira - short ribs marinated in red wine & chicha morada w/ aji panca sauce over choclo pepian & herb salads. So tender that the meat was falling apart before I could even lift my fork.  I must also state that I love chicha morada so I had very high hopes for this dish. It passed with flying colors.\nFor dessert: crepe de chocolate - with lucuma mousse (soo yum) & ganache meringue ice cream ice cream w/ cointreau and fresh orange sauce. The chocolate overpowers the lucuma mousse completely. The delicate, exotic flavor of that delicious Peruvian fruit is lost within the chocoate :( but the fresh orange sauce complimented the lucuma mousse beautifully on its own.\n\nLa Mar, i'm coming back with the boyfriend and I hope you impress him just as much as you did me. \n\nbesos!", "author": "Susy C."}

For instance, we had our dessert menus for 20 minutes (yes, I timed it because at this point, it was getting to be very annoying) before he came and took our order.  We sat with our empty entree plates for a half hour before he cleared them and asked if we wanted anything else.  But, enough about that...I would go back for the cebiche sampler, it was heaven.  We had a causa nikei (sp?) that was very good, and the quinoa/caprese salad with burrata cheese was to die for. Our entree was a steak dish whose name escapes me, which was fabulous, except it had a few too many onions. The tenderloin was melt in your mouth good.  For dessert we had the mousse cake sprinkled with 24k gold dust and it was gone in no time, it was delish!  I would like to come back and try the empanadas, we didn't get to those.

You freakin' RUN for it, fork in hand, like it was the Potato Famine with zombies at your heels! \n\nBack to reality and you find yourself on the Embarcadero for an evening of delicious Peruvian food at La Mar Cebicheria. 6 months and 450 Yelps after my first blissful encounter, I realized this \u00fcber reviewed place can be different depending on the fateful combo of who your server is and where you choose to sit. When you visit, my advice is to think about what mood best suits the occasion. There are 3 places to dine in, each one invoking a different feeling: the lounge with dark wood ranch style tables and square ottomans, the open and lively dining room and their heated outdoor area with a beautiful view of the Bay. My fave is the relaxing atmosphere of the lounge, but that's just me.\n\nIf there's one thing you should know about La Mar, they are ALL about the sauces. (And I am too!) So much so, that they outnumber the dishes by 3 to 1. The seared beef heart, the empanadas, grilled octopus and teque\u00f1os all came with a rainbow of savory dips. At one point we had 4 dishes, 12 little dipping sauces to sample and no table room to spare!\n\nSo now I have to geek out a little with a bit of dorkiness that you graphic designers reading this will understand. I would totally lay down some cash to take home one of their menus. And no, damn it, it wouldn't fit in my purse! A simple, elegant design that matches their blue and yellow square motif in the restaurant, matte with a small square of spot varnish over their logo. Ooh, just scrumptious! From the bright square ottomans to the criss-crossed backs of the chairs, it's just so brilliantly thought out that it makes me sigh in design ecstasy. Mmm, LOVE it.\n\nSo will I be back?

La Mar's got authentic Peruvian styles and flavors but it's quite dissimilar from \"typical\" Peruvian food. This is a good thing, as I found food in the nicer restaurants of Peru a bit heavy and one noted. La Mar utilizes a variety of non-traditional Peruvian cooking techniques while staying true to Peru.\n\nThe entire meal proceeded slowly -- a great thing if you want to savor the night, not so great if you're trying to watch the Bay Bridge Lights turn on. Overall, the meal took about two hours from the original time of our reservation.\n\nWe had: The cocktail special a Pisco drink similar to a Cosmo, with the Pisco flavor masked behind fruit flavors. Yummy if a bit weak. Cebiche Chifa (Chifa is Peruvian word for Chinese food.) The fish tasted wonderfully raw and slightly \"cooked\" by the acid on the outside. The \"Chinese\" flavors were bold, if a bit stereotypical (peanuts, ginger, deep fried noodles.) The slight acid was balanced nicely by the peanuts and deep fried noodles. Next was Corazon or beef heart. Beef heart tastes awesome, though the texture can be a bit difficult for people not used to it. I notice that La Mar tenderizes the beef hearts, making the outside texture similar to other beef, but the inside has the slight toughness of heart. We prefer the beef heart texture, but the tenderizing makes it more approachable. Next, we had the sous-vide squab stuffed with fluffed rice. Not bad, but unremarkable. The fluffed rice was interesting.\n\nFinally, we ended with a Lucuma Panna Cotta with chocolate foam and Queso Helado (4 milk ice cream.) Everything tasted excellent except the Panna Cotta. It was served as a roll rather than in a traditional glass -- the extra gelatin to help it keep shape made its texture unpleasant. The flavor also had more of a spiced flavor than a traditional butter scotch tasting Lucuma, which made it slightly unpleasant. Ask your server if they have Lucuma ice cream, which I hear is wonderful (though it's off the menu and they don't always have it.)\n\nSometimes a server makes a meal.

As you can imagine, I jumped all over the complimentary chips basket.\n\nIf it is your first time coming here to La Mar, be sure to order the causa sampler (which several Yelpers have so graciously provided pictures of).

We got the cebiche tasting (basically a sample of most of the cebiches).

DELICIOUS!\n\nJust heed this warning...if you order dessert, do NOT get the crepe. Drive somewhere else in SF to get one. Why? The crepe was the size of a wallet. A small Hello-Kitty sized wallet.

But with that said, still tasty. His favorite was the seafood or lomo saltado. The one with corn had really yellow sweet corn in it, which isn't actually the sort of corn typically found in Peru (there's is more big, white, and more starchy than sweet). Still tasty -- but almost dessert/baked good-y to me. \n\n\nDESSERT:\nPicarones (traditional warm pumpkin and sweet potato fritters with spiced Chancaca honey -- basically circle donut-shaped thick and fluffy funnel cake with a sauce that is NOT FROM EARTH!  This is seriously the best dessert I've had in a long time. \n\nBu\u00f1uelos de chocolate (Orange glazed chocolate beignets with banana and passion fruit ice cream -- basically little balls with some seriously rich chocolate gushing out, served with a baby amount of ice cream.) All that rich chocolate could have really used a lot more ice cream to help it out. Still quite tasty and if you're in a chocolate mood, this will definitely satisfy your craving.\n\nInka Cola (the perfect non-alcoholic soda to complement your cebiche!) \n\n\nAll in all this place is definitely worth a try.

We both had one of the rice dishes - me the one with every type of fish ever in in (starts with an M, mercona, mer something...) which was incredibly tasty and fresh, and him the norteno (?) which was absolutely excellent, and he said it was even better at 7am when he got up to shove the leftovers in his mouth sans fork. \n\nAtmosphere is great, I bet the view from the back is fantastic, and the food is wonderful.

Anyways, I came here one night for happy hour with my friends and we also wanted to have dinner here since the photos on yelp look delicious. However, the food did not exceed my expectations. I was hoping for something flavorful and yummy. I was left thirsty since my arroz lar mar dish was salty! Ahh. This sucks. Some of their dishes weren't on the menu anymore so that was a shame... Also, the cebiche were too sour for my liking. The squid was fishy and had a chewy texture. What made the rest of the night unpleasant was the fact that the waiter messed up splitting our bill when we wrote down how much to put on each card. He even said \"TIPS are not included!\" Rude much? We know how to read but the fact that he didn't split our bill accordingly and was rude about us tipping. Well, you shouldn't even deserve a tip since you weren't serving or checking up on us. Sheez.", "author": "Ann L."}

We got a reservation for 4 adults and 2 children and they sat us in back at a huge table near the bar.  It was nice to have the extra space, especially with the kids and the stroller.  We started off with the Pisco Sour and it was very tasty (I though the meringue was unique).  They brought a bucket of fried plantains and potatoes (potato chips).  They were thin and crispy...we polished one off and asked for another.  We ordered the cebiche which was a little different from ones I ate at other restaurants.  La Mar's version is less sour and the seafood was very fresh.  I think I could have just stuck to cebiche for dinner.  We ordered the empanadas and it came crispy and hot.  We got some other dishes but the gauge for Peruvian food is the Arroz Jugoso (called arroz con mariscos at other places).  This is a rice dish cooked with seafood.  It was very good but I have to say the Arroz Con Mariscos at Isabella's Restaurant in San Jose was better.  Overall, the service and the food was great at La Mar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-07", "description": "La Mar Cebicheria- Review\n\nExec Summary:  Very good food with some stand out dishes, but not the best Peruvian I've had.  I prefer La Costanera in Half Moon Bay and Isabella's in south bay for a more casual setting.  La Mar's ambiance is nice, especially on a sunny San Francisco day.  The service was excellent, drinks were average and it is a bit spendy.  I'd likely go back to sample some more dishes and recommend to friends or out of towners who want to sample some unique and tasty food. Parking wasn't bad; once I located the place- right on the Embarcadero b/t Broadway and Washington, I found parking on a side street.  There is paid parking close by and I think my friends only paid $10.  \n\nI met up with 5 of my girlfriends on Wednesday evening; we had a reservation and were seated immediately and without any issues.  A few of us had drinks and an appetizer at the bar; they have small plates around the $6 price range and drinks were around $6 dollars.  The prickly pear margarita was very pretty- it's bright pink- but I thought it could have used more tequila.  They had a decent wine list as well I was surprised that they didn't have a huge variety of salsas with our complementary plantain and sweet potato chips.  I've sampled many more Pervuian salsas and La Mar only brought out two kinds- the yellow huacaina and a red one; no green salsa that is very common in other Peruvian joints.   I didn't get around to trying their Pisco sour which was a miss on my part.   Next time!\n\nWe started with some appetizers; a tuna Ceviche Nikei; Causas and empanadas.  The ceviche was very similar to an ahi poke tuna you'd get at a Japanese restaurant; it had nice big chunks of tuna and was very fresh and flavorful.  One order of causas was super tiny and me not being a fan of potatoes, I didn't even bother trying them.  The empanadas had a thick, crunchy shell which was beautifully fried, but I had a hard time telling what the filling was because we ordered the variety plate.  I think the beef one would have been the right one to try.\nFor our entrees, we ordered a variety of things:  Lomo Saltado, Braised short ribs, a Sea Bass in a tamarind sauce and a seafood stew similar to a Cioppino but not as tomatoey.  And a vegetarian Quinoa Chaufa.   I've had better Lomo Saltado at the neighborhood Peruvian joint in South Bay; the beef was tender but they were a bit chunky; I prefer strips.  Interestingly, this didn't come with rice.  The braised short ribs were super moist and tasty.  This was my favorite dish; it was accompanied by a white bean and pea puree with some whole beans which was incredibly tasty.   When all the meat was gone, I cleaned that plate right up with the tasty sauce/accompaniment.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and a nice portion size.  I like the tamarind sauce very much- savory and not too sweet. It went really well with rice we received with our order of the seafood stew.  The mussels in the stew were huge and tasty and the broth was yummy.   It would have been nice to have some bread to soak up some of the extra sauce we had.  I'm a sauce girl!  Finally, the quinoa was amazing!  It was nothing like the boring quinoa that I make at home.  The grains were a little larger and super tasty fresh.  They had some crunchy lightly friend things on top which obviously gave the quinoa a nice crunch but made the dish even better.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the homemade ice cream with caramel marbled in with alforjores (the Peruvian cookie) which was the best one we ordered.  The ice cream was creamy and the marbled caramel and cookie combo was very tasty.  The fried plantains and sweet potato dessert with a caramel sauce wasn't as good; the crunch was off and they were a bit greasy, soggy and heavy.  We also had the panna cotta which was average.  The presentation was nice though.  \nThe total bill ended up being about $70 per person, which isn't too bad since we were all super full and had a couple drinks, appetizers, main courses and dessert.  I have been to other Peruvian joints- Andina in Portland which I would say is hands down the best- great ambiance (more cozy and fun), creative cocktails and very, very good food.  Isabella's in South Bay has great home cooked food in a more casual setting.   La Costanera in Half Moon Bay had slightly better food than La Mar and I like that is overlooks the ocean but their service was not as good.  \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with La Mar; I'd go back and try some of the other dishes and recommend it to friends as it was a nice experience with some unique food.", "author": "SanJoseSun D."}

The empanada sampler was also yummy as well, with one each of the four empanadas offered, a bit pricey though for empanadas.  I still don't know what the dipping sauce was, but it added a little kick to the taste which was great.  For the main dish, I had the lomo saltado, which was the beef tenderloin.  Although I am not a big beef person, it was delicious!  The beef was very tender, the meat separated easily with a few touches of the fork, and when coupled with the rice with the peruvian corn, it just made my meal.\n\nThe one thing that I did not think was great was the timing of the food.  We were not even done with the appetizers and the main dishes already showed up.  I felt like I was rushed to eat.

La Mar is hosting a Pisco Sour day on Feb. 4th and 5th in honor of the national holiday \"Pisco Sour Day\" in Peru. All pisco sour drinks are just $5. Only 2 of these little treats make me a drunken mess so its a great event to take a \"cheap\" date. \n\nMy love hate relationship began with pisco, not just pisco sours, on a trip to Peru in 2003. As I am always looking for a cheap alternative while backpacking, my friend and I decided to buy a bottle of Pisco from a corner store in Paracas to enjoy as we planned our tour of the Poor Man's Galapagos Islands otherwise known as Islas Balletas. Ironically, it really wasn't a bottle of pisco, but a Peruvian tradition of making your own homemade hooch and repackaging it in used water bottles. Clearly we should have stopped there, but what the hell we drank it. Never been sicker and never touched the stuff again for years. Sadly pisco was ranked with tequila as the devil's drink for about 3 years until I enjoyed one while in Mexico. Not officially a Peruvian pisco sour but not as bad (or may I say controversial) as the Chilean rip-off version. \n\nThe La Mar Pisco Sour is nothing like my little dirty corner store version. Me encanta! La Mar carefully crafts their delicious beverage treats using only the finest ingredients: Pisco Quebranta, lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, and regional bitters. Don't be thrown off by the egg white, it creates a cappuccino like frothy top that is so entertaining to scoop with your finger. Remember Pisco is a brandy distilled from grapes, so if brandy doesn't agree with you, likely Pisco won't either. But what the hell give it a try and come out to La Mar on the 4th or 5th to try one (or five).", "author": "Alice S."}

We wanted glasses of sparkling wine, but he told us they didn't have anything like that on the menu, which was odd because we noticed not one, but three other tables drinking sparkling. \n\nSince it was our first time, we weren't familiar with what most of the menu items meant, so we asked him to give us his favourite dish recommendations. He recommended something off the brunch menu, so I ordered the Causa lime\u00f1a:\n\nDungeness Crab on top of a yellow potato causa (whipped potatoes) with\navocado pur\u00e9e, quail egg, cherry tomatoes, aj\u00ed amarillo\nhuanca\u00edna sauce and basil cilantro oil. \n\nWhen it came out, my friends and I were all shocked - it was the smallest amount of food I'd ever seen on a plate. Like a tiny amuse bouche appetizer instead of a main meal. For example, the \"quail egg\" was literally 1/16 of an egg, there was barely a sliver on my plate. The \"cherry tomatoes\" was ONE cherry tomato cut in half. To be fair, we hadn't realized how small this dish would be, and we were starving, so to see something so small come out as our main meal was equally hilarious/sad. \n\nI kind of wished the server would have jumped in and said that the portion would be quite small (obviously we were clueless about the entire menu and needed his help to even choose a drink), but I think because he was so busy he wasn't that attentive. Although it was a tiny portion (and overpriced, in my opinion), it was a delicious two bites of food.", "author": "Jenna S."}

Service was attentive and the waiter knowledgeable and explained  everything you would want to know about the food and drink. Water glasses were always filled. General recommendation: go for Lunch and stick with the apps or small plates.\nThey  start with a cylinder bucket  full of Yam, Plantain & Potato Chips w/ 2 Housemade Dips, mild pepper based sauces one red  the other yellow. The pisco sour was a great drink to go with the chips,and it's the house specialty. Highly recommend this one.\nThe ceviche starters we  had were super and really we should have stayed with those and the empanada and the causas courses.  All of those  were outstanding, with unique flavors and fresh ingredients. They have a few treatments, one is the more typical Peruvian with some citrus type flavors and they also do a asian inspired  Nikei ceviche with  (Ahi Tuna, Red Onion, Avocado, Nori & Sesame) similar to a Hawaiian Poke. These were all really good and presented beautifully. The causas are a potato base  little cylinder topped with with seafood or  vegetables, these go down really smooth and creamy , great with a crisp white wine. Then the empenada or salads to finish off the meal, there you will get meat if desired or the freshness of the salads. That would have been plenty even though these courses tend to be small.\n\nI go their arroz norte\u00f1o , their version of Paella, and in retrospect I should have sent it back ,  it was  waay over salted . Not at all the caliber of the other dishes. We also got a sea bass entree and a salmon entree, which were  all  good just not as refined or exciting as the ceviche seemed to be.\n\nAs a lunch spot and especially for a visitor in town,  I would recommend this restaurant as \"excellent\" for their ceviche, and for their service. The atmosphere is also very inviting, right on the water, with the Bay and bridge in view.\n\nLa Mar is worth a visit, for a splurge as it will run you approx $ 40-50- pp. with  drinks and tip. The other features of La Mar  is the out door seating, which for lunch would be really an awesome lunch or snack spot, as well as the size of the place make it ideal for larger groups of 10 or more.", "author": "Aaron Z."}

I later found out from an article in Time that it is the brain child of Peruvian celebrity chef Gaston Acurio. So on this trip to SF, I made a point to go again, even though I was by myself. The challenge of eating by yourself is that you can't sample a lot of the delicious food. After much debate, I settled on the two Peruvian favorites: ceviche and anticucho de corazon (grilled cow's heart). \n\nTo start, I took the waiter's recommendation and went for ceviche de chifa. Wow, that was tasty! Mahi Mahi in sesame leche de tigre, with peanuts, Chinese onion and crispy wonton. The leche de tigre is made from 17 different ingredients. The mahi mahi was marinated in the sauce for just a couple of minutes before it is served. That is why the fish still has that sashimi freshness but also are extremely flavorful.I couldn't stop stuff it in my mouth. \n\nNext the anticucho de corzaon cooked to perfection. It is really easy to make it chewy, but here the heart pieces are tender but also has a bite to it. The spicy sauce they use also adds some additional kick. It is very satisfying and filling. \n\nI wish I had more room for other delicious food, but these two are certainly the must have in my opinion of La Mar.", "author": "Ally W."}

Absolutely divine. *Favorite along with the two aforementioned cebiche dishes deserves my 4 stars*\n\n-Anticuchos de pollo:Grilled chicken skewers, potatoes, peruvian corn, salsa panchita.

Pretty disappointed. Bar was like an oven, and they wouldn't let you move to patio or anywhere else until 5:30, so we baked and starved. Snacks were 1/2 price but they contained VERY little food. So-called sliders were tiny slices of bread with an even tinier sliver of meat and some shaved lettuce - really a bit of a joke. Ceviches were all tiny. Ended up spending a lot more than expected because we had multiple orders (guess that was the plan).\n\nAlso, I tried their Pisco Sour. I am a bit of a Pisco snob and know a great Pisco Sour when I taste it (try Fonda's in Berkeley- fantastic). This one wasn't. Not very sweet or sour and I think they used mediocre quality pisco. I never thought you could have a bad one, but this one verged on bad. Very frothy (too much egg white - cheaper than actual liquor, I guess), with little taste and pisco tasted on the edge of harsh.\n\nWent to the patio for dinner. Greeter was pretty unfriendly (bald young guy with glasses and an unfriendly look). Waiter was professional and nice, but food was overpriced and ridiculously small portion. I order Lomo Saltado ($34) and got about 4 small cubes of meat over some french fries. After eating still had a half a plate full of onions (most expensive onions I've had). Clearly they pile your plate will cheap stuff and give you rice and onion filler.

Ho-lee-shazbot this place rocked. I think since someone else picked up the tab I have no problem giving this restaurant 5 stars (otherwise the expense might have pushed me to give them 4 stars - I'm a cheap date).\n\nWe decided to make a go of trying a bunch of the different appetizer sized plates on the menu. We ordered a ceviche sampler plate, an empenada sampler plate and a causas sampler plate. We also ordered a few anticuchos (steak and mahi mahi). Everything was unbelievably delicious. Each of us had different favorites, but generally the anticuchos and the ceviche were the favorites of the table.\n\nWe also ordered some peruvian cocktails and beer. The two peruvian beers they have are pretty good and the cocktails they offer are amazing. The pisco sour is really, really good. And the pisco punch was also popular at the table. The beers (cusquena and cristal) went well with the food and we thought they were pretty decent.\n\nDesserts had to be ordered after a meal of such excellence. Their Bunuelos weren't quite beignets like any of us had seen before, but they were still delicious. The cappuccino de tres leches and the suspiro limeno were also really well liked with the suspiro limeno being my personal favorite.", "author": "Ahmad A."}

The location is waterfront and parking somewhat easy  (when meters are not being monitored) if you don't mind walking a bit.   \n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and we were seated promptly.  The decor to me seem a bit dated (reminded me of a cruise ship).  The service was average - nothing spectacular. The restaurant concept was upscale peruvian seafood.  We tried the causa casera: purple potato causa, artichokes, asparagus, avocado and tomato with basil cilantro oil.  The Ensalada Nikei (which didn't have half the vegetables it said on the menu). Anticucho De Carne grilled skirt steak, potatoes, peruvian corn, spicy rocoto sauce (mmm - meat on stick but very skimpy meat). And finally Jalea crispy mahi mahi, calamari and octopus with plantains, yucca, peruvian corn chalaca salsa and house made tartar sauce which we referred to as the \"Captain's fried platter.\"  \n\nThe food was A-OK.  Nothing to write home about....if it didn't have the peruvian names there wouldn't be anything peruvian about the food except for the causa.

The space itself is grand, and walking in with a friend from NYC, I thought, hey, my city's cleaning up nice for our out of town guest.\n\nTrouble is, the food is just not that great.  Perhaps it's a side effect of the gigantic menu or of the can't-fail location?  Either way, we wound up spending more than a hundred bucks for what amounted to a mediocre snack.  (Along with a decent amount of wine, admitted.)  Most importantly, some of my ceviche tasted less than fresh.  I felt fine afterwards, but when you're slurping down mostly raw things you don't want to have to question that for even a minute.  I'd suggest you do your slurping elsewhere, e.g. Limon in the Mission.", "author": "Elisabeth D."}

It was my first time and I've been wanting to dine for since they first opened. It's a bit confusing when you first walk in the doors. To your left is a bar. To your right is a one person restroom that EVERYONE including employees use and there's a line for it. \n\nAs you walk past this, there is yet another bar to your right. You pass that and in front of you is the dining area. To your right is ANOTHER bar. \n\nThis place is known for the Pisco drinks. I didn't try any but one friend from the group did and he liked it enough to buy another one.\n\nThey ordered a few ceviches and empanadas and we all shared it. Each dish I tried was really good!\n\nFor my entree I got the lomo saltado. It was strips of steak with onions and tomatoes. Fries were sitting on top. It came with a side bowl of white rice with garlic pieces in it. I mixed that in with the sauce and it was yummy!\n\nHubby got the chorillana (red snapper). There was a small mound of mashed potatoes next to it. This was pretty good too.\n\nCoworker that was leaving got the short ribs. This was the best dish this night. The meat was so tender and flavorful. \n\nFor dessert, we got the tres leches. This came in a champagne flute. I thought this was a bit on the pricey ($11) side. Reading the description on the menu, it was sponge cake with chocolate and creme brulee. I just imagined these layered together. \n\nWhat I didn't like was that the sponge cake was all mushy and soaked up all the liquid. Imagine throwing a piece of spongecake into the blender/food processor.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, it still tasted good. \n\nThis place is very spacious. You're not too close to the table next to you. I recommend sitting in a booth. Maybe that's just my preference.\n\nService was friendly and timely.\n\nParking- If you're lucky enough to find street parking (meter) make sure you have PLENTY of quarters. \n\nWe parked in the lot in the next building. They have valet and self park. It's a bit tight here. Don't get valet unless you're a terrible parker. We chose to park our car ourselves. You enter and the guy comes out and asks if you want valet. It's $5 an hour for self park and you pay upfront. You also lock up your car and keep your own keys. He gives you a receipt to put on your dshboard. I told him we would be there around 2 hours.\n\nIt's a good thing I looked at my receipt. It expired like 4 hours ago and was paid with a MC. I went to him and he played dumb and asked \"yes???\" I asked for another receipt and he says \"oh yea.....I gave you the wrong receipt. Here's your real receipt.\" Ummmm...... \n\nAnyways we went a lil over our two hours and they didn't charge us extra. Yay! \n\nNow....I have to go back with some gf's.", "author": "? ?."}

The mixto had Mahi Mahi, calamari and octopus in aj\u00ed amarillo leche de tigre with cilantro, red onion, habanero with Peruvian corn and yam.

Only I had dietary restrictions. Walked in at 7:30p and were told we would have to wait. I suggested we wait at the bar. Seemed like no one wanted to order drinks, so  I walked into the restaurant, found a table, went back to the hostess and informed her I saw an empty table & I have a back issue and wanted to be seated. She complied right away (after asking if all of our party was here - didn't she see us the first time?). After putting in drink orders, 2 Pisco Sours, 1 Passion Andrina, 1 Desayuno Peru, a server brought us a complimentary basket of sweet potato, potato and banana chips with 3 dips. The dips - ranging from hot, medium to mild spice - were delicious.  We ordered the following:\n\n1. Cebiche Tasting - J, E, Jo all enjoyed.\n2. Causa Tasting - scrumptious - must order. There is one vegetarian causa. I ordered an extra - costs $5.\n3. Empanada Sampler - 1 vegetarian empanada (corn). One extra cost $3. The corn empanada is sweet and perfectly fried. \n4. Seco Cordero - Lamb shank - meat so tender, falling off the bone - worth the long wait per my friends.\n5. Ant. Pulpo -  octopus on a skewer \n6.  Enormous plate of ahi tuna with sauce served at one point - compliments of the chef. \n\nBathroom was clean. Stark decor (black and white tiles). Restoration Hardware?\n\nI would give 2.5 stars for the service (seemed hurried & no one offered suggestions) and 4 stars for the food. Everyone at the table seemed happy with our choices. Delicious potatoes (causa) and corn (empanada).  Not many options for vegetarians, though I didn't try the quinoa entree or salads (I refuse to order salad when I eat it daily at home). At one point, before the main entree (took a LONG time for the lamb to arrive), the server brought cocktail menus, which I found amusing (I'm a teetotaller) since no one in our party was a big drinker.\n\nPortions were small. J & I ate beforehand, so we weren't hungry when we arrived and left feeling good.\n\nWe sat in an elevated booth (bench one side/ chairs the other side). \nCushioned bench comfortable.\n\nTotal tab for 4 people including 3 drinks & 18% tip = $206.61\n\nTip calculations (15%, 18%, 20%) printed on bill.

You dare me to come back and experience again your succulant flavors of aquatic life dining.  Is that laying it on a bit thick?....NO\n\nI brought my girlfriend here on her birthday and we were both pleasantly satisfied with our food experience.  For starters we had the Causa Limena (how do you put the thingy over the n?)  The presentation of the dish was clean and enticing.  The creamy avocado puree worked well with the dungeness crab and mixed with the basil cilantro oil to give a fresh, light even flavor. \n\nOur 2 main courses were the Atun (how do you accent the u? I am symbol illiterate, not to be confused with imbecile literate) and the Arroz Parihuela.  I just have to say, hands down, I should have just ordered 2 of the Arroz Parihuela.  The paella-esk dish was outstanding with it's rich mix of seafood amidst the aji panca and aji amarillo risotto.  It was a meal to warm the stomach with goodness and happy fuzziness.  Good call girlfriend!\n\nNot to dissuade you from ordering the Atun (damn yous accented u's!).  The ahi tuna was seared to perfection and the honey sesame sauce, along with the bok choy, gave it an asian fusion flavor.  However, because I had eaten so much tuna over the course of the week, I had overloaded my palate already with too much tekka.  Note to self, eating too much of something in a week is probably not a good idea, unless they're bananas. mmmmm....bananas, banana milkshake, banana fritters, banana cream pie, fried banana and coconut icecream...uh, excuse me, I digress.\n\nAs for drinks, I simply had sparkling water, since I am considered a non-alcoholic being.  My girlfriend had the Chicha Tu Sour...hee hee I said chicha.  Judging from her reaction, it was a splendid aperitif...see I can use big words too.\n\nNow, I do have to deduct one star for spotty service.  Our waiter was amicable enough, but he had a strange tendency to not address my girlfriend directly...that's a no no.  He also didn't pour my bottled sparkling water...not that I'm not strong enough to open my own bottle and heft it up to pour it (that's right, I lift some weights), but at an establishment like this, it's expected of the waiter.

There was a bit too much hype but the only reason why I gave it 5 stars was because it was super cheap! Compared to most other fancy date night type restaurants, this place is right on the ticket! I was so surprised by the check. I actually told my date that my parking ticket actually balanced out the evening. \n\nNow onto the restaurant. The setting is dead on. It was formal enough to be trendy but not super formal where you had to go all out. But that didn't stop my date and I from dressing to our nines and getting out the jean and tshirt rhythm of daily grad school life. We were seated right away even though we had a reservation the place was maybe about 75% capacity at around 9pm. Get street parking and don't bother with the $20 lot. \n\nThere are enough items on the menu to keep you coming back. For a simple elegant date night that's not going to be murder on your wallet gentlemen, this is a good spot.", "author": "Jon H."}

This is your typical, \"doesn't look like much on the outside but you enter a new world once you walk in\".  While the inside was pretty, the outside took my breath away.  You walk out to a pretty patio on the water and beautiful turquoise and green decor, including a nestled corner couch with pillows and low tables.  We sat in a somewhat private, protected area and it was beautiful (we had a table and chairs - no couch...there's only one section with the couch).  It was a sunny day in SF but not super warm.  The \nambience is lovely.  \n\nThere were 8 of us and the waiter suggested we order family style, which we did.  We decided how many of each type of item we wanted and requested that he pick for us.  i.e. - 3 cebiches, 2 empanada plates etc.  He was very helpful and professional but was tough to get a smile out of him.  When I ordered my wine he suggested I try another wine on the menu which was from Spain, and \"better\" than the Sauvignon Blanc I ordered - he was right!\n\nThe food was memorable but a little too adventurous for me.  I really enjoyed the cebiches we ordered, and the California roll type items (I can't remember what they're called) were very good.  You should really be a seafood fan if you choose this place (it'll hit ya in the face when you walk in), although there are many other options available on menu.\n\nFood I give a 3 1/2 and then another 1/2 for the pretty patio area.

We were walking past La Mar and decided to give it a try. \nWe walked in and were greeted with a \"yes?\" from the host. Uncomfortable. He then led us to a table on the covered patio without a word. No smile. Not even a \"welcome\" or \"thank you for joining us\" or even a \"hello\"\nWe felt this was rather odd and unfriendly but shrugged it off as we sat taking in the menu. It was later in the afternoon so it wasn't very busy, maybe six tables that we could see. Water arrived a short time after we sat but then that was it. We sat and watched a server serve and check on the tables around us for more than 15 minutes.  I am a patient person, but no one greeted us, smiled at us or even looked at us even though we were sitting in the middle of the patio, it was hard not to take it personally. There was a manager(?) standing in the doorway maybe 20 feet away who either didn't notice that we hadn't been helped or didn't care (also never smiled). Our server helped a guest seated after us before finally coming over to us. Maybe she didn't know we were her table? Even so, there was no apology or explanation as to why she walked past us for 15 minutes without stopping. \nWe were actually about to leave when she finally came by, I kind of wish we had. \nThe food was pretty good and the service (once we got started) was fine, but none of it was great nor could it make up for the cold greeting and neglect at the start. I don't really mind spending $100+ on a nice lunch but if I do, I expect an experience: fantastic food and service- at the very least I would expect to feel valued as a customer and taken care of. We felt from the start that no one cared if we chose to spend our money there and no one was interested in making our experience fun or enjoyable. \nI do agree with other reviewers that the food is overpriced but it was the cold shoulder we got from La Mar that irked us. It has been a few days since our visit and I purposely waited so I wouldn't write a review out of anger but I am still offended.", "author": "Kater C."}

I have dined at La Mar before and had a great experience.  But this time was very much different.  It took forever to order our drinks and never received the complementary chips.  Our server snapped at us several times during the meal and was once rather aggressive about it.  We had to clarify ingredients of a dish for one of the guests due to a food allergy.  We were informed that it did not contain the allergen but had requested for the sauce to be on the side nevertheless.  Once it arrived with the dish covered in the sauce the server was reminded we requested the sauce on the side.  He barked, \"I told you it didn't have it in there!\"  Left us all with a bad taste in our mouth.  However, The ceviche are very well done.

It's this delicious dish with onion and fries and beef. The sauce in the dish is so finger licking good. Goes well with the rice.

The waitress was curt with us for being late (yeah ok, rain does that sometimes), though having been late to a reservation before I find there have been much more pleasant ways to address us.  Especially when we get to our seats and find out that while the bar area was happening, there were plenty of open seats in the dining area.  \n\nThere are 2 bar areas - one to the side of the hostess table that looked like a perfect place to grab a drink after work and maybe a few apps.  Once you walk past the hostess table through the main doors, you'll find yourself in the main bar area which made me feel like you should be lounging poolside (teak looking benches) outside (windows on the ceiling) and listening to some spanish guitar under the lazy sun.  Makes for a perfect place to impress a date.\n\nOnce I walked past the main bar area I noticed that La Mar was by far the biggest restaurant I have ever been to in the city.  So that's a nice plus.  Despite our experience with the hostess, our waitress was very friendly and accommodating.  Now to the food.  The dishes were served at perfect intervals which I can always appreciate however I can't say my feelings toward the food were so warm.\n\nWe ordered the Halibut Cerviche, the risotto special (similar to the Arroz Jugoso dish that was on their main entrees menu), and then the Dulce de Luche for dessert.  The complimentary plantain appetizer was a treat.  I really enjoyed the spiciest of the sauces.  The other two were too sweet and didn't offset the flavor of the plantain chips as well as the spiciest sauce.  Although admittedly the sweeter sauces came in handy when I ate the habanero hiding out in the cerviche.   Beware!\n\nOther than its milky appearance, I didn't think there was anything special worth noting  about this halibut cerviche (Cerbiche Clasico).  The main entree I thought was way too dense and the heaviness of the rice did not match well with the heaviness of the seafood.  Not to mention there was very little flavor imparted from the actual dish.  The Dulce de Leche dessert is in liquid form (we should have read that) and honestly, was far too sweet.  It was almost like downing a cup of Hershey's caramel syrup.  I think had it been paired with some vanilla ice cream, it would have at least been tolerable.  We ended up sending our dessert back and the waitress was kind enough to exchange our dessert for the sorbet trio (reedemingly refreshing and ... delicious!).\n\nOur bill came out to $100 (including tax and tip) for the two of us for one appetizer, 2 main entrees, and one dessert - overpriced considering the iffiness of their food.

Because I'm a snooty food critic now.\n\n5 stars for the food: Delicious, refreshing, filling but leaves you weight-less. All the qualities of a restaurant that cooks its food perfectly and uses fresh, quality ingredients. A menu full of unique dishes and most is a-la-carte with good proportions, so it's a fun place to take a group of people.

It's a large restaurant.\n\n3 stars for service: There was really nothing wrong per say about the service, only that it was a bit confusing.

To the point where I actually wrote a thank you note when I signed my receipt.  Who does that?  (Definitely not me, prior to this day!)\n\nA good friend and I ate here on a whim.  Walking through the doors off the Embarcadero felt like stepping into a whole other world--a cool, breezy coastal one where time slowed down considerably.  We sat right up against a window with a view of the bay.  Since it was late afternoon, the restaurant was sprinkled with a few people, but not many--so the whole affair felt peacefully casual and service was spot-on.  Now for details...\n\nSetting: Spacious, airy, plantation-like beach villa. White walls, dark brown fixtures, bright splashes of turquoise and lime green on the backs of chairs and on top of tables. Big windows that let you swim in daylight.\n\nFirst up: Chips and a trio of sauces.  When I say chips, I mean tasty, paper-thin slices of potato, plantain, and yam that are lightly salted (with crack, I think, because I could have eaten those alone and been satisfied). The trio of sauces were a visual treat: bright orange, light yellow, pesto green. Per our waiter, they were arranged in order of spiciness and each highlighted a unique ingredient. \n\nAppetizer (to us, at least): we each requested a half order of cebiche--my friend the cebiche mixto, and me the cebiche chorillana. As a fervid fan of the stuff, I was completely enamored. The seafood (calamari, octopus, fish, shrimp, scallop) was soaking in an orange puddle of tart, lime-infused juice and the taste was simply amazing. Not to mention the texture!  When I finished (it was agonizing to see the plate empty) I took a spoon to the remaining juice and ate that too.  Not my finest moment, but it's behind me now.\n\nMain act: The sampler platter.  I don't remember what it was called, but to future diners, it was located in a box on the upper right side of the menu's second page.  It consisted of a skewer of mahi mahi on a bed of Peruvian corn; a serving of the ensalada limena; and a side plate of lightly-fried octopus and fish.  As a visual, it looked awesome.  I was compelled to take a photo.  And the taste...\n\nThe skewer of fish and vegetables was dripping in a bright red marinade, which offered a delicious chili pepper background to the dish.  The salad--soft spinach with baby tomatoes, queso fresco and a light, fresh dressing (that I would love the recipe for) demanded all of my attention.  And the fried seafood was a great crunchy complement to the rest of the plate.  I loved the combination of flavors, colors, textures...and amusingly enough, while my friend and I were ooh-ing and aah-ing over our food, two people came up to us and asked us what we were eating--then ordered it too. \n\nDessert: Rice pudding with butterscotch, chocolate and fresh strawberries. Mind you, I am a texture person and had deep reservations about rice pudding, which proved to be correct--so the restaurant is run by humans after all. But a few strawberry chunks in butterscotch sauce to cap off a fabulous meal still proved to be a great ending.\n\nAll in all, I didn't want to leave the place. You know when you spend an entire day at Disneyland and manage to see everything you wanted to see and you're left with that feeling of satisfied exhaustion?  That's how my tastebuds felt afterward.  Exhausted but in a crazy good addictive way. \n\nSo yeah.  When can I go back?", "author": "Shirin H."}

I mean, when is the last time we've had Peruvian fine dining?\n\nLa Mar is located at Pier 1 1/2. This reminds me of the scene in 'Being John Malcovich' where the elevator reaches a 1/2 level. From the outside La Mar doesn't look anything special. But once you go in you realize that it's a relaxed upscale dining restaurant with adjoining bar. They have a happy hour and from what I hear the drinks are really good. Later we had two Sangrias ($9) which were quite refreshing.\n\nI really like the interior design along with the colorful menus. It's minimally clean with color interspersed for interest. If you feel like taking a cerebral vacation from San Francisco without leaving it you should check this place out. The single person bathroom that I used was a bit claustrophobic.\n\nThe menu is somewhat perplexing. If you don't know Peruvian or its cuisine the ordering process can be a little intimidating. I'm sure La Mar gets a lot of its profit from confused patrons. We basically went with own waiter's recommendations, ordering three samplers, one appetizer, and three main dishes.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\nFree chips with three dipping sauces of differing spiciness\n-Great idea, yet I hate to start my meal on an empty stomach with oily fried chips and cream based dips. It makes my me bloated. Any bread?\n\nSTARTERS\n\nCebiche tasting 28\nMixto, Chifa, Nikei and Cl\u00e1sico\n-Quite disappointing. La Mar is supposed to be known for their cebiche. This is simply a case of too many ingredients. I couldn't even taste the fish. Everything was fresh and tasted good on its own, but together it was hard to distinguish a single balanced composition.\n\nCausa tasting 17\nSelection of four causas: Lime\u00f1a, Criolla, Nikei, Casera\n-I was puzzled by this. Maybe I'm just not used to cold potato appetizers. I'm not too fond of the texture.\n\nanticuchos de pulpo 16\nGrilled octopus skewers, herbed mashed potato\nwith chimichurri sauce and aj\u00ed panca\n-Tasty stuff. Eating some meaty octopus skewers was good.\n\nEmpanada sampler 18\nA tasting of all four empanadas\n-My favorite of the small dishes. The fried dough is as flavorful as the filling. I could have passed all other appetizers and had more of these. Frying makes everything better.\n\nMAIN\n\nCau cau 31\nRoasted scallops and clams, tiny potatoes, sweet pea and corn\nrisotto with an aji amarillo mint broth\n-The most popular of the night. Creamy and bright.\n\nLomo saltado 27\nTraditional Peruvian style stir-fry of saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, onions,\ntomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic with fried potatoes and rice\n-Underwhelming. While not entirely bad, it just reminded me of a dish from Carrows, not Peru.\n\nArroz norte\u00f1o 24\nNorth Peruvian seafood combination with mussels, shrimp, octopus,\nand fried rice with cilantro and Huanca\u00edna sauce\n-Interesting interpretation of fried rice. Maybe like two mussels, but a decent amount of octopus. Wouldn't get again.\n\nDessert\n\nSuspiro lime\u00f1o 10\nClassic dulce de leche mousse with port wine meringue\n-Waaaaay too sweet. Tastes more like a dipping sauce than a free standing dessert. I did like the sprinkling of cinnamon.\n\nDessert tasting, cakes and cream filled pastries\n-Alright but I think the flavors start to taste the same after awhile.\n\nCookie wafer crisp with whipped cream and caramel\n-Interesting and good texture. Not entirely fulfilling.\n\nIce cream puff, complimentary for birthdays\n-An off menu item that's actually really really good. Why don't they have this on their menu??\n\nAll of the dishes are beautifully presented. Any of the dishes could have been shot for a magazine opt. The ingredients were fresh and properly cooked.\n\nNow for the negative. I think that way too many of the dishes have too much hominy or Peruvian corn. It's just everywhere. Plus many of the dishes are overpowered by a sense of cream or an element of carbohydrate. While I was expecting a big punch of flavor, the fine dining atmosphere made me believe that there would be more subtlety. La Mar's dishes tend to be one-note. In the end it doesn't really add up to much unless you're looking at the bill.\n\nService is great. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. We had our dishes cleared out multiple times. My glass was refilled without asking once. I felt pampered.\n\n___\n\nA great location, interior, and staff. Even though the food is a complex arrangement of multiple ingredients, there isn't much depth. By the end of the night my stomach was uneasy. Just way too much oil, cream, and carbs. The desserts had way too much of the same caramel taste to it. I know caramel and butterscotch is supposed to be big in Peru, but give me different shades of the same color not the same thing over and over. Balance, balance, balance.

If you are looking for a meal, head someplace else.  The portions are tiny.  After $50 a head, we all left hungry.  We went for a birthday party and despite being seated in the corner between the kitchen and the back wall, the noise level was very high.  Conversation more than 2 seats away is nearly impossible.  The staff was attentive, but a little too aggressive at clearing the table when the group is clearly trying to take photos and be social.\n\nWe ordered about half of the menu and everything we ordered was excellent (and tiny).  The ceviches are all excellent, most especially the clasico version which uses very tender California halibut.  The chicken dishes are all great, and the beef heart was the best I've ever tasted hands down, anywhere, including in Peru itself.  They also serve the best Pisco Sour I've ever had.  The chicha morada left a lot to be desired.  Several of us ordered deserts in vain hopes of feeling full and found ourselves with about 2 cubic inches of desert and the tiniest ball of ice cream ever served.  Again the taste was great, but it was over too soon.\n\nLike everything in SF, it's parking jihad.  There is a paid lot across the street that's easy, and also you can get valet parking on Pier 3.  Otherwise its parking meter hell that charges 25 cents for every 7.5 minutes with a two hour maximum.  This isn't enough time to have a respectable meal here and then go out for another meal someplace else to finish filling yourself up.\n\nSo in summary, if you want to try Peruvian food that's so good it better than authentic, head here.  But I wouldn't make a habit of eating at La Mar on a regular basis.", "author": "Bobby K."}

And mind you, I love beef, but I was expected more flavor.  I did very much enjoy the bowl or rice that accompanied my meal.  I don't know why, maybe it's the Asian in me, but I definitely thought that was the best part of the dish.\n\nOverall the service was just ok...when we asked our server what the best way to order...they didn't really give us any direction and just said \"I'd order this\" and then proceeded to just list all of the sampler plates and all of the big ticket specials.\n\nThe boyfriend really enjoyed his dish.

I highly doubt it.  I am sure the hostess is just telling us that to sooth our hunger and growing displeasure.

Also, before we were sitted, a party of 6 came in and were immediately directed to a table. \n\nThis is highly unacceptable and a showing of poor poor customer service.  \n\nSo, by the time we sat down and ordered our food, it was close to 9:45pm.

Having said that, last night was my first visit there.  \n\nThe weather in San Francisco was exquisite.  A clear blue sunny day.  I arrived early and ordered a glass of wine from the bar.  At 5:45 pm, the bar was at capacity, so i entered into the restaurant area and sat at a quiet empty seating area.  I was joined by another woman waiting for her husband, and then another mother/daughter team awaiting their spouses.  Friendly people.  \n\nOnce our whole group arrived, we were seated. I found this to be the only downside to La Mar.  They do not seat you until your whole party is present. The place was not full at the time so it would have been nice to be seated.  There was no room to sit in the bar, so we crowded around the empty seating area and waited for 30 minutes.\n\nThe waiter was fantastic.  Authentic, knowledgeable, polite, attentive and all eight ladies at the table voted --- very cute!  He reviewed many of the menu items with us with beautiful detail.\n\nThe wine list is extensive with many imported wines.  We selected based on our own knowledge and then had more help from our waiter.  The choices were excellent.\n\nWe split the cebiche tasting and causa tasting plates.  WOW.  They were amazing.  All of the fish was very fresh.  The sauces were terrific.\n\nThe main course that I ordered was one of their specials.  It looked a bit like a stew upon arrival.  It was filled with beef, scallops, calamari, shrimp and bok choy over a mashed potato bed.  The sauce was heavenly.  All of us were very happy with our menu selections.\n\nWe celebrated 3 birthdays this week.  The staff brought out two plates of what looked to be donut holes (actually French benguits?  sp?  sorry, i am on my first cup of coffee) and fried donut fritters with a maple sauce.

We had reservations at 8:15, and were promply seated at a tiny table placed incredibly close to other tiny tables. If you're claustrophobic this is not the place for you. It felt like we were eating at the Cheesecake Factory, sitting elbow to elbow, hip to hip. Dinner conversations were reduced to shouting, and any attempt to try and tune out neighboring conversations was impossible. \n\nAmbiance aside, I was still ready to taste some eye-opening ceviche, and splurp down a few shots of leche de tigre. We ordered the ceviche tasting, leche de tigre tasting, and a empanada de aji de gallina.\n\nTo keep it short, the best part of the meal was the sorbet.\n\nCeviche's are supposed to be light and refreshing, what we got was creamy and heavy. It wasn't what we expected. The empanada was bland, and the accompanying sauce was not an aji I've ever tried before. It was thick and creamy, and tasted of butter. 4 out of 5 leche de tigre shots were creamy and thick. The ceviche mixto was the best. Sour, spicy, light, and refreshing. \n\nI knew the dinner bill would be expensive, but when I pay good money for food, I expect good food in return. Next time I'm craving Peruvian ceviche, I'll stop by Limon and Fresca instead.\n\nBoo-Yah bitches!", "author": "Robin K."}

There was no room inside so we sat on the patio, they had the heat lamps on and I was in a skirt and very comfortable on a chilly SF evening.\n\nThe food was amazing, we got the grilled octopus skewers and crab appetizer. The octopus was very tender and the grilled flavor was delicious. The crab was mixed with cream and served on potatoes and it was yummy. We shared a traditional Peruvian entre of seafood and rice which was also very good and reminiscent of Paella. I am originally from the Mediterranean and it reminded more of food from home - a very pleasent surprise since I expected something totally different. \n\nFor drinks I got something with ginger in it and my date got something with pommagranate, don't remember the names! But both very different and yummy. Although I did make him switch drinks with me, because I liked his a little better:)\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this place.

We were seated quickly, but after sitting down, we were left alone for almost 15 minutes with no one coming to check on us to ask about drinks or to bring out the banana chips (which are great). For appetizers we tried the cebiche and the chicken skewer, which were both very good. While we had ordered our drinks with the food, they didn't arrive until our entrees came out. For entrees we had the Lomo Saltado and the Salmon. The lomo saltado was delicious. The beef was cooked to perfection and the sauce went well with the rice and fries. The salmon was the most disappointing part of the experience. I thought the concept of SF restaurant week was to showcase restaurants by offering a nice meal at a lower price point than usual. It seems like this restaurant decided that if you're paying less, you should get less food as well. The serving size of salmon was minuscule. It was no bigger than the size of my thumb. Honestly it looked more like a sampler than a main course. After being disappointed with the salmon it was nice to see that dessert was included in meal, which was not mentioned on the menu. I tried the tres leches cake, which came with fresh strawberries and was nice and sweet. The service throughout the meal was very slow, from the employees leaving us waiting at the start to the delay in bringing out appetizers and beverages. They were exceptionally fast at charging my card after bringing out the check though. Overall I would say this restaurant is okay, but due to the mediocre service and extremely small sizes I would not come back again.", "author": "Phillip D."}

We all parked on the street.  If you have a late reservation, street parking is doable.  \n\nDecore: \nthe interior decorator failed at emulating an underwater experience.  The high ceiling, hard furniture, concrete floor, and close glass entryways made for terrible acoustics.   \n\nService: \nThe waiter was slow enough to have anemia.\n\nThe Food:\nFor starters we ordered cebiche chifa and cebiche cl\u00e1sico.\nBoth had sinewy fish.  This might be due to use of poor quality cuts of mahi mahi.  The chifa one has delicate flavor and included ingredients like ginger, pickled carrots and daikon, habaneros, wonton strips and cilantro.  The clasico contained the same low-grade mahi mahi and calamari, octopus and habaneros, cilantro, red onion, and corn.\n\nTenderloin empanadas: 3 dumplings on my appetizer-sized plate.  I was reminded of dim sum, at 3x the price.  The flavor and texture of the meat inside each of these bite-size morsels resembled simple stew meat.  The sauce around the meat was basically standard beef stew also.  The fried, layered dough wrap was the highlight.  Light, crunchy, and layered well.  But seriously, something out of chinese dim sum would have been as good.  \n\nThe Fish empanada had better flavor.  There was a sweetness in it from the added corn.  That means there really was very little fish used in these.\n\nThe calamari risotto was slightly, not extremely bland, but enough to take note.  \n\nThe only thing excellent on the menu did not come out of the sea and therefore defies the name of the restaurant.  It was a Lomo steak w/ french fries and a bowl of rice, but the price of this simple, lunch sized entree was nearly $30.\n\nThe wines were expensive, we ordered 2 bottles and there were a few single glasses dispersed about the table as well.  The carmenere was commendable in flavor and, as expected, had less tannin than a Cab.\n\nThis restaurant reminds me why locals should avoid touristy areas.

I will go back for this again (and maybe again).  The perfect blend of citrus and salt and spice.  Next time I plan to get a sampler, the hamachi we had was great and I can only imagine how the other fish tastes.\n\nThe empanadas also a real winner.  The filling was just the right amount to comliment the crispy outside.  Sometimes empanadas wind up either doughy and uncooked or dried out and tough but these little darlings left us wishing we had ordered more.\n\nThe only items not to my liking was the grilled octopus and the drinks we ordered.  I love me some octopus but it's got to be done right.  These were a little tough and by the time we got them a bit cold.

It wasn't showing up on my Yelp app map as we walked along the Embarcadero, but lucky for us, we stopped to check out the menu.\n\nStaff were very nice and attentive. Environment was agreeable in a historic building. You can sit at the bar, out in the main restaurant where the action is, or on the patio (which had heaters) where you can look at the water.\n\nGood, interesting selections on the menu. Kitchen is essentially in the main part of the restaurant so you can see the staff working on preparations. Everything looked great. The rollitos (sushi options) looked really good but we didn't try them.\n\nInstead of bread they bring you a basket of a mixture of chips: plantain, sweet potato, and regular potato chips with two sauces, one mild and one spicy. Found out later the mild one is from emulsified queso fresca and some kind of yellow chile (not hot). Sauces were very good with the chips.\n\nInteresting drink selection with a variety of beers & sakes (didn't look at the wine list but there was one). I tried one of their sakes for $11 a glass. It came in a cordial glass which is very small. I didn't expect that nor did it specify what a 'glass' was, but the sake was good. For anyone who likes warm sake, they don't carry any.\n\nWe each got a sandwich: one chicken, one roast beef. I tried both and they were very good, served on fresh baguette. The roast beef sandwich was a little light on meat though and is assembled in such a way that it slides apart (meat piled on top of lettuce & tomatoes = slip-slidin'-away). I had to restack things to make it easier to eat. The chicken sandwich gave you more substance. Both sandwiches have the choice of salad, or fries. Fries were good, generous portion. Salad dressing tasted like a light sesame oil asian-style dressing and was very good, but the salad was the size of a cup of soup.\n\nFor dessert we tried the tasting trio: 3 desserts served as mini versions of themselves, in shot glasses. One was a limon pie (very much like key lime pie, not too sweet which is the way I like it), a chocolate mousse creation with a touch of raspberry, and an arroz con leche dessert that is not featured by itself as a choice. It was a perfectly sized dessert for us - enough little spoonfuls for 2 people to get a variety of flavors without overindulging and feeling stuffed.\n\nI would definitely go here again - loved the service and saw lots of other things that looked great to try. Lunch for the 2 of us was $58 without tip.", "author": "Jody T."}

Good choice!! \n\nI made a reservation a couple of weeks ago through OpenTable so that was taken care of.  They don't seat you until your whole party has arrived though.  While you're waiting you can take a tour of the two contrasting bathrooms in the lobby area!  One is a \"Marked Historic Landmark\" while the other is a very modernly decorated one.  Just to, yknow, pass the time. \n\nThe decor is really nice and on a clear day the view is spectacular.  I love the shade of blue they use, it's unique and beautiful.  \n\nOur waiter was pretty helpful and very nice.  He was also incredibly handsome.\n\nI had my first Pisco Sour and it was quite strong but delicious!  Definitely recommended.  \n\nWe ordered the Cebice Tasting (4 Ceviches), Empanada Sampler (beef, seafood, corn, chicken), Una (cashew croquettes with crab and shrimp and chicken.. served on  bok choy), and the antichuco de corazon (beef hearts).  My brother ordered the steak entree.\n\nThe chips ARE good but the majority are potato chips which kinda sucks because the plantain ones and the sweet potato ones are so much better!  \n\nOkay.  So first comes this plate with what appears to be some meat salad atop 4 yellow and purple pieces of play dough.  Our server went to explain each of the toppings and we kind of just went at it.  For some reason we thought this was the ceviche.  After all, there were 4 things... but it was so small!  Later we found out, it was not.  They had given us the causas tasting instead.  (traditional Peruvian whipped potato with aj\u00ed amarillo and seafood or vegetarian toppings) Our waiter came by to tell us as we were digging at it, and our server later asked us why we didn't say anything.  WHOOPSIES!!  lol they gave it to us on the house but I do feel really bad about eating something that we didn't even order.  \n\nThen the ceviche came for real.  And it looked like what you would think it should look like.  My favorite was the Mixto.  The hailbut one (Clasico) was way too fishy/chunky for me.  I enjoyed the Ahi Tuna one (nikei) as well as the Chifa (mahi mahi).  Mmm so fresh and so yum yum!\n\nI'd never had beef hearts so I was a bit apprehensive, but it came with this amazingly spicy sauce that I had to try.  It's kinda more chewy than beef from other parts of the cow... but it has a very distinct flavor and texture.  I liked it a lot!  It was also served with huge corn kernels that were chewy and just interesting, as well as a couple of pieces of fried potato.\n\nThe una was cool.  Wetter than I imagined it would be.  By that point I was too buzzed/full to truly enjoy it, but my dad liked it a lot.  It looks like those crab croquettes you get at dimsum restaurants that are actually stuffed with shrimp meat.  Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeaaa those!\n\nBrother liked his beef entree a lot.  It was served with fries and a bowl of corn-infused rice.  I had a chunk of steak and it was divine.  Even the tomato was amazing.\n\nWhat a great dinner!  Wish I had had room for dessert.", "author": "Lydia W."}

My guess is: if you like cebiche, you'll probably like it here just fine. \n\nAs for the rest of it: service was a little too casual for my taste, and the waiter missed a couple things in our order. But it's an attractive, lively restaurant, the pisco sour was excellent, and it's a nice view out onto the water. \n\nAnd is it authentic Peruvian? I've been to Peru, and La Mar didn't taste anything like the sour alpaca steak with mushy potatoes and coca tea I got served multiple times.

The food was prepared well, but for the price and portion size, FORGET IT! We had one entree of los saltido (peruvian style beef tenderloin) to split amongst FOUR people. It was definitely not enough. We also had the squash risotto to split amongst 4 of us.\n\nIn the beginning there were some h'ors deurves being passed around in cute little spoons, but not enough to go around for everyone. I didn't even get to try the cebiche! \n\nThe wines they had for us were very good, crisp and fruity. Service was also just so-so. They went around asking what kind of coffee everyone wanted, however that wasn't covered as part of our group purchase...the waiter probably didn't know..but we all got hyped up about coffee until we learned we'd have to pay out of pocket for it.\n\nAnyway, based on this brief experience, I most probably will not be coming back here.

Maybe the waiters are still on unemployment...\n\nI went here with a colleague after a full day at the Fancy Food show so we were looking for a light dinner.  We were seated very quickly, but it took forever to actually get a waiter.  We got water quickly, but really it was like 20 minutes before we saw our waiter. We even had to ask for a waiter twice.  We should have just left then, but decided to stay.\n\nOnce we finally did get our waiter's attention, we decided to split the cebiche sampler as well as the empanada samplers.  After waiting so long for the initial visit, we weren't sure how long our food would take, but it was out in a matter of minutes.  The empanadas were tasty, but the cebiches were the star.  All four were great, although they were a little heavy on the red onions. And listen to them when they say avoid the piece of habanero chile on the top of the cebiche.\n\nSadly, we did not see our waiter once while we were eating and when we were finished, it was a complete repeat of the before food experience.

It wasn't crowded when we arrived, but by the time we left around 8p, it was BUMPIN'. We sat outside and it was SUCH a nice view with great food.  It was all the better b/c he paid (he owed me - BIG TIME); I savored. \n\nWhat we ate:  \n\ncebiche clasico - California Halibut in a classic leche de tigre, red onions, habanero, Peruvian corn and yam ($18)\n- tangy and just enough spicy to make you want more\n\nanticuchos de pulpo - Grilled octopus skewers, herbed mashed potato\nwith chimichurri sauce and aj\u00ed panca. ($16)\n- the octopus was unusually tender and the mashed potatoes complemented it v. well.\n\nempanadas de aji de gallina - stuffed with stewed chicken in an aji amarillo sauce ($10)\n- probably the best empanada i've ever had. had a buttery, flaky, crispy taste which made all the difference...\n\nlomo saltado - traditional Peruvian style stir-fry of saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, onions,tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic with fried potatoes and rice ($27)\n- just okay...i was expecting the flavors to explode in my mouth as it normally does at other peruvian restaurants where i've been. the beef, however, was ridiculously succulent. \n\nDrinks: \n- get the Cusquena beer, NOT the Cristal (beer, people, not the champagne - calm down).  I mean, both were good, but the Cusquena has more body.  ($4-5: not bad for imported Peruvian beer)\n\nDessert: \n- chocolate-filled beignets (more like little balls with semi-sweet chocolate) with passion-fruit ice-cream.  ($10?  BIGGEST disappointment of our whole meal. Sounds better than it tastes. Save your money and get dessert elsewhere!).  \n\nUnexpected treat: \n- home-made chip medley made from potatoes, sweet potatoes, plantains (on the house)\n\nI don't understand why people complain about the service.  Our waiters were awesome.  The only problem was that they cleared our plates too quickly.  My friend wanted more chips but they took it away before it was too late.

When we were first sat, we were given a basket of slim cut fried potato slices and plantains (platanos to my Latino peoples!), they were served w/ a trio of dipping sauces. Like the ceviches, one was sweet w/ a mild earthy flavor, another had a nutty flavor, and another was spicy w/ a bit of awesome sweetness. \n\nI wanted to try all the different ceviches, but didn't wanna stuff my face w/ nuthin' but ceviche. We ordered the sampler that came w/ four different ceviches, an ALL OF THEM WERE EXCELLENT! I forgot the names of the plates, but each had a distinct flavor to them. One was spicy, sweet, tangy, and a combination of them all. The ceviches were made w/ fresh ingredients which only added to the great flavor! \n\nWe wanted to try a bit of a few things, so instead we decided to share a couple of dishes. We ordered the beef empanadas, which were AWESOME, and a few other things... I apologize since I have been a way a bit I cannot give further accurate comments. I do plan on returning soon! \n\nBut I do remember one of the desserts we ordered... it was the binuelos, which was VERY GOOOODDD!

Saying this, I'm really glad that we did and we will certainly come back the next time we're in San Francisco.  \n\nFor starters, the staff were posh yet really friendly and provided excellent service.

Our daughter ended up enjoying the chips made of plantains, potatoes, etc. and the yummy dips (she REALLY enjoyed the creamy dips!).  So we're off to a great start!\n\nThen the cebiche came out and now I'm a huge fan of a Peruvian food.  As I am a sashimi lover and having disdain in the idea of cooking wonderfully fresh fish (i.e. the foodie in me says fresh fish must be raw!), I shamefully have to admit I never tried cebiche until now.  And now that I have tried it at La Mar, I have a sneaking suspicion that I will have to fly to Peru to get anything better (now, that's a great excuse to go to Peru but far outside the bounds of this review!).  \n\nAlready sated on the cebiche, the arroz dish came out and provided us a mixture of great seafood, rice, and wonderful flavors.

I was, as always, my own food critic, but I was even more interested to hear their opinion of the food since they are accustomed to true Peruvian cuisine.\n\nMy take on La Mar - \n\nRestaurant D\u00e9cor/Location: The restaurant itself was large and tastefully decorated. The best part is the outdoor seating (make sure to have a reservation to get outside) that overlooks a beautiful Bay view.  \n\nService: The service was slow but that didn't seem to affect my experience as I was enjoying the company that I was with - if I were on a time crunch, I may have been slightly annoyed. \n\nFood: Good - the classic ceviche was fabulous - the halibut was wonderful but the star was the liquid that it was \"cooked\" in - I'd get it again. We also tried the mahi mahi ceviche with habanero - it was good as well but was second to the classic in my opinion. The surprise star was the causa with the tuna tartar on top. It was a beautiful and unique dish that was really flavorful and well prepared. The free chips (plantain, sweet potato, potato) and three dips were a nice start to the meal and kept coming throughout).\n\nDrinks: The best reason to come to La Mar. I tried about 5 different drinks, all containing Pisco (no, I did not order 5 drinks for myself), and all were fabulous. The Saxon was my choice and was so refreshing with the basil and lemon flavors. At about $10 per cocktail, I'd say that's worth it.\n\nValue: For quality fish, the prices seem to be fair. It is a little expensive for a lunch meal (I'm not sure how dinner is) but the ceviche was quality so that's what you pay for (plus probably a little bit of a name and scene).\n\nOverall: I would go back and think the best way to experience this place is to go for drinks and accompany them with a bit of ceviche.\n\nPeruvian take - \n\nAuthentic. They said it tasted just as it does in Peru. There are a few Americanized items but the classic ceviche here = classic ceviche in Peru. They even asked for shot glasses to drink up the remaining liquid in the ceviche - a common habit in Peru I was told.", "author": "Katie S."}

BEWARE of the ceviche bar, you will have to flail your arms around just to get service. Once you do, however, the service is great and friendly. Wait, except for the guys that just serve you drinks. Don't even think about asking them for a food item because they get mad. They also don't even tell the right person for you...weird right? In fact, I'm going to deduct a star for that. Now they're down to 3!\nOk, onto the good part. Their food! Their ceviche is soooooo good. We got an extra spoon just to drink the sauce like soup. The causa with prawn was really good too. It was also really rich so be prepared for the filling whipped potato. The beef skewer wasn't so great. It was really over cooked and tough.

I probably would have given it four stars then because the food was unique and fairly good, not to mention the fact that it was all free.\n\nUnfortunately, I went back again, this time with a large group of 10 and they seated us in the \"Ceviche Room\".  FYI, do not be fooled. The Ceviche Room is actually the lobby, outside the bar and the restaurant.  You feel like you are sitting at some random communal hotel lobby where there is absolutely no ambiance and you are treated like an unwanted stepchild.  I don't know how to describe it but it was just embarrassing, especially if you are the one hosting the dinner because it looks like you couldn't even get a reservation at the restaurant and had to be seated in an outside bench.  \n\nThen comes the food.... I don't know what happens between the walk from the actual restaurant and this \"special\" room but everything was pretty crappy.  The lomo saltado was about 50% chunks of onions and 10% beef... and the portions are small to begin with!  The ceviche sampler was lacking except in the classic one.  The tallarin saltado was like burnt and super salty chow mein with large chunks of onion and minimal seafood.  Seriously, it's like they ran out of the anything good and dumped in a bunch of onion chunks with their fingers crossed that we woudln't notice.  I've eaten in the main dining room and it was much better so I can't explain it.  It was one thing if the food in the special room was discounted but actually no... there's an automatic 20% gratuity put in there because it''s in the \"special\" room.

I don't need to go back.  \nEverything was a visual masterpiece but sometimes the food played mind tricks on me.\n\nThings that looked like sushi (causa) tasted like potato salad.\nThings that look spice-less (no red chili or green habanero in sight) actually put my mouth on fire -- hey not fair (cebiche ciasco - the habanero was hiding).\n\nFirst -- I don't want to be ungrateful -- because I was just happy to have a restaurant open at 9:30 and still serving dinner.  My husband and I were staying at a nearby hotel and read all the impressive Yelp reviews so I feel bad giving only 3 stars.  \n\nIn the effort to be a bit adventurous, I ordered the beef heart.  I was expecting small Japanes-style skewers with tiny morsels of heart.  Well -- I was WRONG and got four LARGE medallions that put together equal the size of a steak.  So kudos for super sized portions -- but unless you want to make this organ your main course -- I recommend you be more gutsy about some other dish.  Heart just tastes like chewier steak.  The saving grace and bright bang to each dish are the dipping sauces (I preferred the yellow one to the red one).  \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the dessert:  lucuma served three ways (tiramisu, cannoli, chocolate coconut brownie with lucuma ice cream).   Lucuma is a Peruvian fruit that the waitress said tasted like caramel.  I agree.  The taste is similar to flan, the burnt sugar of a creme brulee or even a hint of pumpkin.  Each dessert had a different texture: creamy, crunchy or cold -- again, another adventure.  Be careful when eating the cannoli -- the candied sugar got jammed in my mouth the wrong way and I thought it was going to slice the roof of my mouth!

Me and my girlfriend dined here for our 1 year anniversary and we were looking to try something new. \n\n1. Pisco punch: Peruvian brandy with lime and pineapple juice. It was on point. Not too strong, but still taste that brandy, which is finished off with the citrus juices. \n\n2. Cebiche sampler: 4 different types of cebiche. One that stood out was their ahi tuna one. Just think Japanese style poke with the citrus and lime flavors. What i didn't know what how much Japanese cooking was inspired in some of the Peruvian dishes. It was definitely very appetizing and good. There was another cebiche that was very spicy, so be careful not to eat the slice of habanero that is on the plate. \n\n3. Arroz jugoso: Their version of paella, without the saffron. All the seafood, meat and rice all in one. It was flavorful, delicious and felt like comfort food. \n\n4. Crepa de chocolate: This was a crazy dessert! Our waiter Tobias explained to us the origin of the lucuma fruit that comes from the Andes region and that the dessert consists of the lucuma cooked through and made into a mousse and placed in a chocolate crepe. Anyways, what made the dessert crazy is that with all the flavors of the mousse, chocolate and orange, it tasted eerily like Thai tea. I kid you not. \n\nIt helped that our waiter Tobias was very accomodating and helpful when looking through the menu. He was very thorough and walked us through everything and was spot on with his suggestions.

Neither of us could stomach the shot, so we asked for a cocktail again, and hey, guess what, there is a cocktail menu after all... I order something else, and the frat boy bartender says hey, what he always did at the Sandy Marlin or whatever was hey, just pour the unwanted shot into the cocktail. Classy, bro. I mean, sure, that was the right thing to do, but at $12 a cocktail. \n\nI have to say, the bar didn't give off a very classy vibe, and that plus the aqua color scheme in the main restaurant, well... I guess \"cebiche\" just isn't my deal, although I do like good ceviche just fine.", "author": "Bowen D."}

This is also one of San Francisco's down fall. \n\nLa Mar had a spectacular atmosphere, and is a beautiful setting for a romantic evening or a special event. The service was prompt and attentive, and the food was tasty and enjoyable. But paying $27 for Loma Saltado was a hard pill to swallow, especially since you can go down to the market in the Mission and get it for about $10. It's Loma Saltado, it's steak with french fries. It's not a decadent dish. \n\nWe are fortunate to live in a city with extravagant restaurants, but my rule is if you can go down to the Mission and get it at a locals spot for a third of the price, and it tastes probably, even better, skip the white cloth napkins.", "author": "Kristin C."}

It has size, a great view, if you happen to be seated facing the right direction, and an undeniable corporate feel.  Service was modestly attentive but the meal was poorly paced.  A salad that was to come with my first course arrived between my first and last courses.  I suspect a problem in the kitchen.\n\nBeing of an age where family is not a distraction and generally dining alone, I have the time and inclination to research a place before I go.  To me the search said go with the smaller rather than the larger plates.  \n\nSo, to begin, I get the sampler of causas, which is comprised of four distinct varieties of seafood or veggies above whipped potatoes.  I enjoyed this plate a great deal as there were contrasts of crab or tuna with more or less assertively spiced sauces.  \n\nSalad nikei was a not especially interesting blend of mixed greens with less green papaya and jicama than I would have preferred.  OK but just a step above salad mixes you can get in the supermarket.  \n\nFinally, a tasting of their empanadas.  What makes these nice is that despite being fried they are not heavy.  I found that the beef and vegetarian (mainly sweet corn) empanadas stood up best to the fried casing whereas the chicken and seafood were overpowered.  Also, this plate was poorly presented: four empandas, side by side, over a few scraps of greens.  Some pickled vegetables or a small salad with vinaigrette would have provided some contrast to the empanadas.\n\nOne surprise was that two attractive, spanish-speaking lovelies seated next to me attracted more attention from the male staff than I.  Okay, they were very pretty and seemed very sweet so one can give the staff a bye on this one.", "author": "David D."}

Well, La Mar proved me wrong. The ambiance was lovely and the clientel was a very diverse mix. The food...here's the rundown:\n\nCebiche - you can really tell that the fish is VERY fresh and high quality. My only complaint about it was that it was a little bland and all you can really get out of it were the lime juice from the leche de tigre marinade.\n\nTried two of the anticuchos (the carne and the mahi mahi) and was most impressed by the Peruvian corn. It's definitely nothing like the corn you get out of a can or from a bag.\n\nArroz jugoso - was very impressed and was very much like a paella. Each bite had seafood in it and it was quite rich. \n\nArroz norteno - probably my favorite dish. Like the arroz jugoso, this dish was also bathed in seafood. The fried rice with cilantro and Huancaina sauce from this dish was DELICIOUS. \n\nOverall, the entire meal (and the company) was top-notch. However, it was all so filling that I couldn't finish my entire dish and I asked to have my leftovers doggie-bagged so I can enjoy the rest of it later.

Our waitress forgot about our requests (a few times) and she was trying to push extra orders down our throats (lady, we're sharing - it's called family style!  that's how Asians do it!)\n\nOh the cebiche, though!  Holy hot mother of God, I thought I'd died and gone to an underwater heaven.  The only way that tuna would have been fresher would be if it swam directly into my mouth.  Come here fishy fishy!  Get the cebiche nikei (the tuna one)..you'll be licking that bowl clean because the sauce is that delish.\n\nWhat was the best part?  My friends...it was the sauces.  The three sauces that came with your sweet potato chips and regular potato chips all had a unique and distinct flavor.  The hot one was my personal fav.    Then there's the sauces you get with your empanadas and salmon skewers.  All...perfecto.\n\nLoved the pops of color against the white furnishings.  A bit on the pricey side (lomo saltado was how much?  $27 for lunch and it wasn't that much better than Mario's!)  Overall experience was pleasant.  Nothing beats eating family style with your friends, enjoying the beauty of San Francisco. I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Alice Y."}

My only gripe is that I really don't feel like good Peruvian food should be this costly. The cost is justified by the freshness and the top notch service. The restaurant bar area feels very trendy and they offer happy hour. The portions for HH are tiny but amazing! I tried the causa lime\u00f1a, cebiche mixto, calamari and the lomo saltado empanada. All were delicious. The empanada and cebiche were my favorites.  I ended getting a seafood dish served over purple sweet potato ravioli in a sweet and spicy sauce! It reminded me of Italian butternut squash ravioli but better! The anticuchos de corazon were probably the best I've ever had. And now, for my favs...passion tiradito? OMG!!! I am going to dream of these for months until I am forced to come back. Choco maracuya dessert!  The best!  The passion fruit mousse was sweet, intense and so fluffy. The chocolate mousse was like cream that could float. It was served with raspberry puree and some fresh cream. I want 4 for myself next time I'm there!  The cost was a little over $200 for 2 people but it was worth every penny. This is coming from my fiancee that is Peruvian.", "author": "Marcia M."}

Restaurant was not full at 8:40pm on Friday night but we were seated outside. The area was almost full with some tables in mid meal and others were finishing. Two other couples were seated before us because they still had their menu's. It's been 10 minutes since we were seated and no one has said anything to us. Head waiter for our area was too busy to deal with us so he sent his backup after I tried to get his attention.  His backup took our drink order and then when on check on another table. Five minutes later and the backup is still talking to the other table. On his way past our table we ask for an appetizer (Ceviche La Mar) and he asks us to tell him what wines we wanted. Ugh. Bad service is getting worse. Wine arrives, still no one has followed up with us even though we still have menus. Ceviche arrives so we decided to put our menu's on the ground, hoping someone would notice. Head waiter walks by menus and says nothing. Bus boy walks by menus and asks if we still needed them. Meanwhile we're not happy with the ceviche, we've had better at Mochica in SF. The fish/seafood was bland. We decide that we don't want to order anymore so we waved the manager over and ask for the check. He asks if everything is ok and we tell him no and that we would be happy to explain out front. Head waiter comes to clear the appetizer plate and take our next order. Still hasn't introduced himself. We inform him that we are leaving. Paid the check and spoke with the manager, detailing our experience. Manager apologized and wants us to try them again. Told him we'll think about it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-28", "description": "First visit to this place - so based on the preview buzz I heard about it, I was really expecting to be wowed - and I was only pleased.  First let's talk about the restaurant itself...great location right on an Embarcadero Pier - but the insides are kind of plain.  The table we set at was on a covered part of the patio and table and chairs were almost cheap looking with nothing to write home about style-wise - a look into the main bar and restaurant, a little better, but still kind of bland.  Since you are going to pay some money to be here and with a prime location, the ambiance of this place was a little bit of a yawn.\nNow let's talk about the menu.  Okay - so this is Peruvian food - also a first, so I'll give my my take on it - seems to be inspired by the Paella and tapas of Spain meets the Chinese food of San Francisco Chinatown - several wok designed meals featuring Chow Mein noodles and bean sprouts in hot sesame oil.  The national dish of Peru is cebiches - made with 100% sustainable fish and shellfish - so I get it that the citrus acid \"cooks\" the fish, but I'm not a fan of raw anything, so I passed on these in favor or the safer salad - very fresh ingredients - really big kernels of sweet corn and a nice kick of cheese with a good oil/vinegar style dressing.  They also have some fancy cocktails, if you are into those that you may want to give one a try.\nEntree - my boss is from Peruvian ancestry and told me to try the other \"national dish\" which was called Lomo Saltado -  this is a stirfry of sauteed beef tenderlion, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic with fried potatoes and rice on the side (also with those wonderful giant kernels of sweet corn).  The fried potatoes kind of reminded me of the Pittsburgh way of serving fried on everything, so somehow, that has also made its way to Peru.  This was actually very tasty.  It had everything in it I liked.  I just thought for $32 it was a little cheap on the beef.  You also get the Peru version of Chips and Salsa, which is a mix of several types of chips and a couple of interesting dipping sauces.\nService was good here - waiter never was far from providing whatever we needed.  I'd eat here again and give something else on the menu a chance, but bring money, it's not a cheap date.", "author": "Steve A."}

I told him I was vegan, and he started talking about his vegan friends and being vegan in the Bay. He was so relaxed and kind, I felt like I was talking to an old friend. Then, he helped me tailor a dessert option that worked for my diet. It was a 3 layer sorbet topped with fresh fruit and it was fabulous. I would definitely order it again. He bent over backward to make sure I enjoyed my experience. Despite being busy on a Saturday, he took the time to talk to me and make sure my needs were taken care of.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-07", "description": "My first taste of Peruvian food was good, fresh, well seasoned, and flavorful - but I didn't find it especially inspiring as a cuisine. Everything tasted good, but the 'foundations' just didn't stir the stars. I didn't try the empanadas, but stuffed and fried dough is commonplace in all cuisines - my guess is that the empanadas (however common in Peru) add little design to the 'foundations' of this cuisine. Of course that would depend on the spicing of fillings - but given what I tasted, I doubt the spicing would be staggeringly original (see samosas as a contrast). Also, technically, what they're serving are empanadillas, not empanadas, which is traditionally (in Spain anyway) more of a pie - baked, not fried like dumplings.\n\nWikipedia reports that approximately 5% of Peru's population is Asian, which is the only explanation for the highly Asian flavors in the food I sampled. If I labeled the food, I would say Asian-fusion - so thick is the flavor profile - but fused with what, I don't know. There is the distant Spanish influence but Latin-American sometimes seems more like an afterthought, a garnish - a bright flavor, not a profound statement. A cynic might say it's only a few specific South-American ingredients that make this 'fusion' at all.\n\nBelow, what I sampled with comments in [brackets].\n\nChips - potato, other tubers, plantains, and 3 dipping sauces [Excellent - crisp, salty, and tasty dips - but chips are chips.]\n\nSangria [Okay, neither sweet nor expressive - but I prefer my wine as wine.]\n\ncebiche chifa: mahi mahi w/peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots/daikon, habanero, wonton strips, pineapple, and rocoto leche de tigre (lime juice and peppers) [Good. Barely tasted habanero and am not the biggest fan of mahi mahi, but it was bright, Asian, and seasoned well.]\n\ncausa casera: Peruvian whipped purple potato, artichokes, asparagus, avocado, tomato confit, basil cilantro oil [Cute little things and a clever little appetizer - nothing stunning, but tasty. Purple base potato mash in tubular form (Play-Doh like texture and color), topped with all the rest of the veg chopped and combined into a kind of Peruvian guacamole.]\n\nensalada nikei: mixed greens with papaya, jicama, soybeans, pickled carrots/daikon, crunchy quinoa, Peruvian purple corn, and rocoto dressing [Well, it is what it says it is - good flavor, Asian (except for the obvious ingredients) - but I found the dressing too sweet.]\n\nanticuchos de pollo: grilled chicken skewers marinated in anticuchon sauce, served with salsa criolla [Tasty. Didn't think Asian at all - which was good. They used chicken thigh too - a wise decision from the chef.]\n\nrisotto de calabaza: calabaza squash and aji amarillo risotto, with wild mushrooms saltado criollo [The least Asian and probably my favorite - the risotto was al dente and the flavors were wild, big, and fulfilling. There were more button mushrooms than wild mushrooms, but the dish was tasty.]\n\natun: seared Peruvian spiced ahi tuna, sesame sauce, purple mashed potatoes with nikei salad [Another favorite. This dish has been done to death by everyone but this was an excellent version. Perfectly prepared ahi - and again, Asian, with the purple mash and nikei salad as flavor repeats.]\n\nlomo saltado: Peruvian style stir fry of sauteed beef tenderloin, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, aji amarillo, and fried potatoes [I was surprised how much I liked this, but it reminded me of an Asian-flavored (yes, again) version of Jacques Pepin's 'instant' beef tenderloin stew, which also surprised me - the key, I suspect, is the originality of the use of tenderloin, which is my least favorite cut of beef. My only complaint with this Peruvian take was that the 'fried potatoes' on top looked and tasted like store-bought frozen fries.]\n\nvegetales saltados: fresh daily veg prepared saltado style with tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, and garlic [Tasted a lot like the previous dish - without the beef. So yes, it was Asian and yes it was well seasoned and yes it tasted good - but you know, so it goes.]\n\nService was a bit sloppy and inattentive at times, but good natured and fine - did not distract from the meal in any way.\n\nIn sum, I liked the food, thought all of it tasty; it just wasn't gutsy enough to move me in any direction, forward or back. This is good food for people who are not adventurous but would like to be adventurous - it is just exotic enough to get that far, but it would wilt in the face of something like Indian cuisine. I should also note - for the price you get high quality product - but I would not ordinarily pay so much for high quality product prepared just this way. I am happy I went, might go again, but life is short my people and the dollar is weak. \n\n3.5 rounded up.", "author": "Brski B."}

La Mar did not disappoint.  I finally had the opportunity to try it as one of my many birthday dinners this year, thanks to my sis to treating me and my cousins.  \n\nThe best way to go is family style.  Order up your favorite ceviches, skewers, causas, empanadas and maybe a main dish or two.  The ceviche sampler is a must have and gives you the chance to try the popular items.  If you're getting the causa, skip the sampler and order the crab or the tuna tartar versions.  The fried tuna and avocado causas that came with the sampler weren't that great compared the other two.  They have an pretty decent drink menu, but you really can't go wrong with the traditional pisco sour.  \n\nThe decor is great and they have an outside patio area which would been amazing to be seated at during the summer.  I definitely will be back for more.", "author": "Wei K."}

You have to get the cebiche (yep, it's in the name, otherwise known as ceviche). They have many exotic combinations with different fish, spices, other unexpected ingredients that all work. To start though, they always bring the equivalent of bread but theirs is much better-chips of sweet and white potatoes along with plantains and 2 sauces. This is an appetizer in and of itself. It doesn't matter if you gorge on them, trust me you'll still eat the rest of your food! The large menu has quite the variety, from  Empanadas to sushi-style fish combos and other ecclectic small plates, along with purple potatoes and other Peruvian staples that more make for an always-interesting, delicious meal. If it's a nice day, be sure to sit outside. I have never sat inside but it seems pretty noisy when the restaurant gets going.", "author": "Janice C."}

Her knowledge of Peruvian customs and cuisines even impressed my mother and aunt. \n\nOn this recent trip I had found that the menu had changed. The lunch menu is not as large as the dinner menu so for a party of 5 we were able to try several dishes. Needless to say the four picky Peruvians at the table were more than happy and approved with great fervor. \n\nIf you're not in the mood for dropping serious coin then definitely stop in for lunch. On those rare warm and sunny days I definitely recommend requesting a table outside.  And don't forget to order a south american white wine to cool you off, if you're in search of a good value. \n\nOn a disappointing note, the arroz con leche has been discontinued. Wtf.

Alas, I was disappointed in the food.  It was lacking the flavor and spices of authentic Peruvian food.  I remember my mouth burning after devouring the aji's at their restaurants in Peru but it was so worth it.  It's such a shame that they \"Americanized\" their dishes thinking that we can't handle the heat and flavors.  The aji's are nothing like the versions in Peru.  We also ordered 2 different ceviches and they both tasted the same except the tiger's milk was different colors.  In their versions in Peru, there were very distinct flavors among the different ceviches and the amarillo version was creamier (but not too heavy).  Also, the arroz de chifa we had in Peru did not have that thick creamy sauce that they stuck in the arroz dish I had here, which made it too heavy.\n\nThe complimentary sweet potato chips were a bit stale but still flavorful.  That and the lemon/lime pudding (tasted like a key lime pie) were the best things we ate.  I don't think I will be back knowing what the real deal in Peru tastes like.  I can't believe there are so many stellar reviews of this place.  Those people are missing out on how much better La Mar is in Peru.  Limon is a better alternative.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

There was nothing inherently wrong with the meal, but it just wasn't fantastic, novel, or unique. It was just okay. Maybe it was over-hyped.\n\nThree of us ended up here one night, and we raked in a pretty high bill, so I'm  certain that I got a good taste of the range of the menu. The ceviche sampler first, then. The Nikei and the Chifa were the better two of the four that came out. However, in the end, it all tasted a bit muddled to me. When I have ceviche, I like to taste the fish - here, the fish was almost always overpowered by the accompanying ingredients.\n\nActually... that was my main problem with everything we had. While the ideas behind each dish were good, the execution was lacking. Either the spices overpowered the main ingredient, or the balance of the ingredients was off.\n\nAnother example: the Causas Limena. Potatoes topped with Dungeness crab. Too much potato, not enough crab, too much mayo in the crab. I was really excited because I love crab, but I didn't even notice it was there in this particular dish.\n\nIn the end, I found the food to be pretty average. I give it a harsher critique than usual here because of the price tag that comes attached to the meal. It makes it to three stars because the cocktails are solid.", "author": "Amy C."}

I make a note that its our anniversary and I would like to sit some where nice and romantic. \n-We get to La Mar on time. We are seated by a table of 3 and a table of 9.

Excellent.

My boyfriend loved his dish!! He kept saying \"Oh my god, this is so good..\"\n\nArroz Norteno: Almost like a Paella. Mixed seafood in rice topped with two mussels. Delicious. highly recommended \n\n::DRINKS::\nPisco Sour: ..actually very sour. My boyfriend ordered this drink because Anthony Bordain was drinking pisco sour on his TV show \"No Reservations\"\n\nCholopolitan: Nothing special. Like a cosmopolitan but with passion fruit juice and pisco acholado instead of vodka.\n\nhierba buena: tasted like 7-up with alcohol. nothing special about this drink either..\n\n::SERVICE::\n-We were given food that we didn't order. Our food was taken to another table. We saw multiple tables being offered food but then taken back immediately because the server mixed up the table numbers or where the food goes.

But when I saw the Happy Hour menu inside the actual bar, I thought, \"Why the hell not?\"  \n\nUnfortunately I wasn't all that impressed with the menu.  For $120 (including tip) for four people at HH, I could have gotten much more elsewhere.  \n\n- The fried calamari was too crispy, almost burnt like.  Is that how Peruvians eat fried calamari?  My bad, if so.\n\n- Empanadas were good, but for $ 5 a piece, I wish they were just a tad bit bigger.  We tried the beef and chicken stew and in my opinion, the chicken had more flavor.  We ordered four pieces, so that was twenty bones on empanadas alone.\n\n- The yucca fritas were highly recommended by the non attentive, lackluster waitress.  But I didn't taste anything incredible.  They tasted like thick cut steak fries. \n\n- Of course, we had to try the ceviche, so we ordered both the ceviche classico and ceviche mixto.  For $6 a pop, I really expected more.  I've had much better ceviche at Cha Cha Cha and Mario's in LA.  I think I counted three pieces of fish in the classico ceviche.  \n\nMaybe one day I'll try the real menu on someone else's dime (aka, on a date).  Hopefully my review will be better then.  After we were done drinking and eating here, we went to Cha3 in the Mission.  The same four people spent $ 80 and the ceviche, sangria and calamari were way better there.  I know, I know.

Oddly, the waiter didn't seem to do anything to help us meet this goal.  While the service was not slow by a general standard, it was slow for a party with a deadline.\n\nThe food was good, but much of it was fried - not very healthy.  I had scallops with risotto as a main dish and it was very good.  A dulce de leche mousse was a big disappointment.  This dessert did not have the consistency of a mousse at all - just ducle de leche poured in a glass.  Boring. \n\nAs far as I could tell, there is only one bathroom.  It's a one person at a time, unisex bathroom.  It's gross enough using a public bathroom without dealing with the issues of having both genders use it.  And having just one isn't enough for a restaurant of this size.\n\nBut the main reason for only three stars is the seating.  We were at a table for six that had benches instead of chairs.  OK, but the benches were not as long as the table.  This is just stupid on the part of the restaurant.  Can you not see that the benches are shorter than the table?  This required everyone at the table to sit much closer together than was comfortable.  I was on the very edge of the bench and spent the entire meal feeling like I was going to fall off.\n\nThe bench had no cushion or padding, so after a while my legs hurt from lack of circulation.

Loved it for a group, but the one-on-one dining experience left a lot to be desired.  2.5 stars at best...I'm rounding down though to balance out my earlier 4 star.\n\nFor one the service was weak.  We were seated for about 10 minutes with absolutely zero attention paid to us.  Finally had to flag down a manager to put in a drink order and get water.  Then they messed up my drink...no sir, Rye and Bourbon are NOT the same thing.  They were sensible enough to comp my first Manhattan due to that...but still.\n\nThe basket of plantains and sweet potato chips with dipping sauces (the one in the middle was really good) arrived about 15 seconds before the cebiche sampler, and after we'd been seated for close to 30 minutes...weak point #3.\n\nThings went mostly smoothly after that.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.  We had the cebiche sampler (quite good, but very pricey...like $30 pricey) and the causa sampler (I enjoyed this more than the cebiche).  We both had the specials, sea bass with prawns for me and a seafood paella-like \"arroz con something\" for her.  Both solid but not fantastic, actually, now that I think about it the sea bass was a touch overdone.\n\nWeak point #4: Had to wave at our server a couple of times for the dessert menu (which we skipped) and then for the check.  He was too busy drying glassware 15 feet away from us.\n\nAs it was a school night (I long for the days when I assumed I'd never go to grad school and used the phrase facetiously)* we managed to limit ourselves to one bottle of wine in the $50 range, and even with the comped cocktail the damage still came to roughly $200 pre tip...2 cocktails, no dessert, no coffee.\n\nShort of tasting menus, there aren't many places in the city you CAN'T dine at at that price point and there are literally dozens I'd prefer.

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. Our waiter was nice and took our orders. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the food was only ok. I ordered the lomo saltado and my husband ordered a salad. The lomo saltado was a bit salty and it was drenched in sauce which made the fries soggy. Additionally we noticed that the other tables were getting a complimentary bucket of chips (or something similar) when they sat down. However, our waiter never brought us this. When I confirmed the reservation the day before I told the restaurant it was our 1-year wedding anniversary and the host told me he added the comment to the reservation but the restaurant didn't offer us anything special (no special dessert, no comment about it being our anniversary).", "author": "Kim N."}

I am a big fan of their Chicago restaurant Tanta - amazing from the space to the staff to the food to the drinks - so I was excited to try the sister restaurant in San Francisco. We did not have time for dinner so we stopped in for happy hour. (FYI: someone has put the fear of god into the staff regarding the times each menu can be used. Honestly - you can not hand me a happy hour menu until it starts? really? ESPECIALLY ANNOYING BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT THEN THE ONE ONLINE) The service at the bar was spotty and not very friendly. They did not seem that busy, but it took concerted effort to get anyone's attention. The drinks are something special. Loved the sangria, blue mule, and the one with raspberry and I think champagne - sorry forgot the name, but it was great! Food service took a while.  One dish came after about 10 minutes, but none of our other items showed up for over 25 minutes.  The servers that dropped off food had snippy remarks for the bartender in front of us. The cebichin mixto and clasico were both good and fresh, but I was not a huge fan of the yucca . I wanted to try their causitas as they are one of my favorites at Tanta (and on the online happy hour menu but not served anymore during happy hour)- will have to try dinner in the regular restaurant to see if it is better.  The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL and I hope to try a meal on their deck to see if I can up the star rating. Another star guaranteed if they import the verdura nikei dish from Tanta - romanesco broccoli, cauliflower, mushroom, spicy nikei sauce YUM!", "author": "J M."}

The food is filling and each bite is amazing. \n\nNow onto the decor. Anything on the Embarcadero is romantic. You have views of the water, and it truly makes your night feel special. The patio is perfect for a Sunday brunch, or a lunch on a sunny day. The main dining room is too large, and very loud. It reminds me of the buzz you hear at Town Hall.

It's unique, and sour (what girls like, right??)  The Pisco Punch sort of tastes like a normal bar drink, nothing special.  So, four drinks later, we waddled to the dining room for our reservation.\n\nSince it was our first time dining at La Mar, we opted for variety.  This included three samplers: Cebiche (It's actually spelled \"Cebiche\", not \"Ceviche\".  I thought it's a typo too), Causas, and Empanadas. \n\nAlthough they're samplers, everything was very small.  They're quite tasty and unique, so I'd recommend trying it all.  What one person likes, another might not.  For dinner drinks, we ordered the Santa Maria and the Passion Andina.  They definitely had a kick.  I was so happy from the drinks, that I ate two baskets of their chips (which included potato chips, banana chips, corn chips?? I don't know.)  \n\nBut yes, go to La Mar.

So we all shared the ceviche tasting which had 4 kinds- mixto (mahi mahi, calamari, octopus), Chifa (Mahi Mahi with peanuts!), Nikei (Ahi Tuna), and Clasico (Halibut).  I wish I could have tried all of them though.  My favorite was Chifa.  \n\nThe empanadas came up next, and of course we had the sampler plate.  I had to share.  Jeeeeez.  I had 1/4 of each one which equates to one bite.  So I had one bite of Chicken, Seafood, Corn, and Beef (chunks of Beef!).  My favorite was Beef.  Lastly we had the Lomo Saltado.  That was the bomb.  That was an eye popping $27.  \n\nSo we ordered desert, and then the waiter didn't come back anything we ordered.  Instead he came with other stuff because they didn't have what ordered.

It's green but tastes like bubblegum. Say whaaaat? But it was a nice touch that they carried it. The ceviche with \"leche de tigre\" was amazing. I wasn't sure if I liked mahi-mahi, but I think this cevhiche in particular convinced me. And the plantain and potato chip combo they served was a great improvement over bread. :) The three sauces were not amazing - except the so-called \"spicy\" sauce - which, while not spicy, was still flavorful and pretty darn good.\n\nThe Bad: The service was painfully slow. I know, we Americans like everything super-fast, and we should savor more. Fine...but the meal was just timed badly. It honestly shouldn't take that long to get Diet Coke or Inca Kola or whatever. There's a difference between savoring a dining experience and passing that point into sheer frustration. The waiter was nice enough, too. Of course, there was a lack of communication with the runners, as the two women next to my cousin and me got our two ceviches. (We also got the Japanese-themed ceviche [yeah, I forgot its name...], which fell short of expectations.) They were nice, so it wasn't awkward to finally interject when they kept wondering \"Hey, why do we have these two ceviche plates?\" Uh, maybe it's because the kitchen's probably-large profits can't buy a kitchen having its shit together. At least not that day. Jacob F and I both got dishes featuring red meat, and his was pretty tough.

Continuing my \"Day of Decadence\" after a morning of indulging on caviar and champagne at Tsar Nicoulai...uh, from two weekends ago (Yeah, yeah, I'm behind on writing reviews, ok, so sue me!). My friend and I decided that we had to try La Mar before leaving for our upcoming trip to Peru. We were hoping to see cuy (guinea pig) on the menu, but no such luck. Ok, I'm lying. My bad. I always scope out the menu online before I try a new restaurant. Anywho...\n\nWe started our fabulous meal with the Cebiche Tasting, which included Cebiche Mixto, Nikei, Chifa, and Clasico. Each cebiche was delicious and the portions were hearty. We could have started and ended our meal with this and would have been happy campers, but we were just whetting our appetites. The leche de tigre had just the right balance of acid and flavors from the rest of the ingredients, and after consuming all that leche, I sure felt potent (if you know what I mean). I stockpiled that natural Viagra, so I should be good for about another month.\n\nNext, we had the Causa Tasting, which included Limena, Criolla, Nikei, and Vegetariana. The presentation was beautiful with perfectly crafted masterpieces of whipped purple and yellow potatoes with different toppings, but none of the flavors really wowed me. They are not something I would try again only because I hate filling up on a lot of carbs or starches like bread or potatoes, but I'm glad I tried them.\n\nAs if Cebiche and Causas weren't enough, we decided to be bold and adventurous by trying the Anticuchos, beef hearts! You know what? It tastes just like chicken! Just kidding. Beef hearts actually taste just like beef. It was delicious and grilled perfectly. Give it a try, and you too, can have the manager personally deliver a plate of beef hearts to your table. I'm sure the staff is always curious to know who is adventurous enough to order them. We also had grilled octopus skewers on top of herbed mashed potatoes with chimichurri sauce and aji panca. The octopus was tender and delicious. My only complaint with the grilled food that was served is the obvious gas grill flavor that accompanied it. It was a little distracting from the true, natural flavors of the meat and seafood. \n\nBut wait, there's more...\n\nAfter loosening our belts and unbuttoning our pants as gracefully as we could underneath the table, we had to make room for dessert! We had the Bunuelos De Chocolate Caliente, warm chocolate filled \"beignets\" with banana and a passion fruit reduction. The round \"beignets\" were heavenly and the warm silky chocolate inside was soothing to the palate. Last but not least, we tried the Crema Volteada, a tasting of four cr\u00e8me caramels. The blending of flavors of both desserts was unique and complex. They were the best restaurant desserts I've had in a long time.  \n\nI'm hoping to make it to La Mar in Lima to compare the food, but if not, our server recommended Astrid y Gaston, one of Chef Gaston Acurio's many other popular restaurants. Overall, the food was delicious. The service was excellent. The ambiance was a bit noisy from the open floor plan and the open kitchen. Oh, and I forgot to mention the fried plantains and yucca chips they serve before the meal with three different dipping sauces. Fantastic! Also, if you're going to order a pisco sour, have it before your meal because it's very sweet and doesn't blend too well with the meal.\n\nAfter an indulgent day of caviar, champagne, seafood, and beef hearts...that concludes my \"Day of Decadence\" my friends.", "author": "Anastasia B."}

I highly recommend the Arroz Criollo and Cebiche Chalaco. \n\nWhile waiting for the food we asked our waiter for bread. He appeared to find this to be a strange request but nevertheless asked the kitchen. A couple of minutes later he returned with what appeared to be bread chips. The pieces of bread looked and tasted like croutons and were the size of silver dollars. We received four pieces. We all looked and wondered \"can they spare a little bread?\" so we asked for more.  We pointed out how small the \"bread\" was and our waiter brought more out. We received four more silver dollars. We were rather amused at this until we received our bill and noticed that they charged us a dollar for each round of bread. We found this tasteless, chintzy and sad.  I mean, the setting was nice, the food was pretty good and then you charge us two dollars for eight chips of bread.  To add insult to injury I asked to take half of my Arroz Criollo to go and somehow the folks who cleared our table lost my food.  \n\nThe saddest part came when it was time to leave a tip. We go out quite regularly and almost always leave twenty-percent whether it was earned or not because we understand that being a server can be arduous work. Last night we left 15% and complained (very little) on the way out.  Come on La Mar, your restaurant is expensive enough. Two bucks for eight chips of croutons, really?", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

(It was more of a birthday WEEKEND if you will)\n\nI have heard so much about La Mar and I was so excited to eat here.  Wow! I'm glad that my experience lived up to all the expectations!  As soon as you walk in, you feel like you're not in San Francisco.  It's more of a light...\"welcome to Miami\" feeling to me.  I loved it! \n\nWe started with the plantains and chips with three different sauces. They all had different levels of heat.  They were to die for!  I seriously wanted to stuff them in my purse and take them home!  Then we had the Ceviche Nikei.  It consisted of Ahi Tuna, red onion, Japanese cucumber, in tamarind leche de tigre with avocado. Super yummy! We also ordered the chicken epanadas which are my personal favorite and for our main course the arroz jugoso (Prawns, clams, mussels, calamari, octopus, white fish and vegetables in a juicy arborio rice with a blend of Peruvian ajis).  This resembled the classic Spanish paella but I honestly think it was BETTER!\n\nHoly cow everything was good!  The entire experience was five stars! Thank you Lily R and Renee for taking me.

I have been there a handful of times including during their transitional \"opening\" week when the service was horrible!! But they have since redeemed themselves! Thank God! because food is actually good and I am a big fan of the plantains and the dips.\n\n I would recommend La Mar to anyone looking for a chic and upscale place with some flare. The drinks are creative and delicious! I would recommend the chica morada (alcoholic version) any of the delicious appetizers and cheviches. Portions size run small and prices run BIG. Don't have reservations? Plan on waiting.\n\nIf you are looking for authentic and cultural...maybe not for you, but if you are looking for sophisticate, not-so-generic, chic and yummy...yes!\n\nI stick to the appetizers which are my favorites. The empanadas are great especially for those not brave enough to try the octopus or cow heart skewers (which are pretty good for being cooked in a restaurant) I've had both and they each that unique aji panca flavor. \n\nI would highly recommend the causa samplers. These are delicious little potatoes creations with a variety of fillings. Personally I like them spicy and would add more lime juice, but they are quite a starter. The lomo saltado is pretty good but not mind blowing... although I will admit this is a difficult recipe to pull off. The lomo meat should be quite soft and the french fries not too soggy but crisp enough to pair great with the meat and delicious pieces of onion. I would recommend most main dishes. I would not recommend the risotto only because you can get plenty of that in north beach at a much better price and plate.\n\nBest desert ever: Picarones - These are Peruvian donuts. Deep fried pieces of heaven! They are actually made from Camote (a common sweet potato used profusely throughout Peruvian cuisine)\n\nThe missing star is for the insane prices. This also where my mixed feelings come in. I don't believe the prices are reflective of the actual ambiance and level of service. Granted the service is great for the most part, but if it's more than $50 per person I need at least a gorgeous view, or an intimate setting with some first-class waiters or something else! (i dont consider this venue much of a view unless you are on the back patio getting blown away by the sea breeze or in the back near the windows) I would go back just for the plantains and dipping sauces anytime though!\n\nP.S. If you are looking for a smaller, more intimate setting with equally as delicious cheviches I would try Mochica in Soma.", "author": "Crystal D."}

The restaurant is an explosion of colors! Even the menus are colorful. The remodel of the pier was wonderfully done. Very modern, very spacious and very unique.\n\nFirst off, the chips - yumiliciousness! I could just eat that and I liked the plantain and sweet potatoes ones the most.  We shared the cebiche which came in a quad of plates. I liked the ahi the most out of the bunch, but all were good.  We then had the causa nikei - a purple potato with ahi on it - sooo good...those are definitely a must order.  \n\nI shared a salad with my bf and that was also very delicious. There was something in the salad that gave it a certain flavor, which kind of reminds me of the li hing mui dressing I had at Alan Wong's in Honolulu.  We then shared a chicken empaladas and a corvina fish.  The fish had a delicious tomato sauce and the fish was over more potatoes.\n\nFinally, we had a sorbet with two Peruvian flavors that I cannot remember, but one was white and the other was sort of sweet and sour.

To avoid the wait we opted to sit at a high top table in the bar.\n\nFood: 4/5\nWe split a half order of one of the cebiches (the classic halibut I believe) and each had the mahi mahi skewers. The cebiche was really good, flawless even. The mahi was good, but didn't blow me away, in fact we wound up talking more about how good the potatoes and corn that came on the side were. Don't get me wrong we enjoyed the meal very much, but I couldn't give the food 5 stars because the mahi wasn't 5 stars.\n\nDrinks: 5/5\nThere were so many things on the cocktail menu I wanted to try I wish we could have sat there all day, that being said what I did have was very good. The mojitos were on the mark, and the Peruvian beer I had was really quite good (I wish I could remember the name, there were only two on the menu and I didn't have the Crystal, so whatever the other one is).\n\nService: 3/5\nLook, it was the bar and there was no dedicated waitress for the high top tables so it was really two bartenders taking care of the whole thing - one working the well and the other taking care of the bar front and the tables in the bar. Therefore I can't blame the bartenders, I blame whatever manager is charged with the staff schedule and the server sections. There were enough tables in the bar to warrant a server section but alas, there was none. Basically this caused the service to be slow, it was good, just slow.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nIt's chic and modern with a light airy feel to it. Perfect for a relaxing lunch on a nice day which is exactly what we came for. I can't comment on the dining room since I didn't sit in it but from what I saw it looked more of the same. Atmosphere was casual, every having a good time and relaxing.\n\nValue:4/5\nIt's not a cheap place, but it's not overly expensive. I think the cocktails are marked up too much, most of the drinks are 9-10$ which I think is a bit steep for what this place is. $7-8 would be acceptable, 9-10 is high. The food price though is fair in my book, for the location, freshness and quality of the food I had no problem with the prices. I guess my take away point is check this place out, but don't have too many drinks unless you don't mind a large bill.", "author": "Chris E."}

We were giggly, silly, taking pics and making goofy requests.   He never once was rude or blinked an eye and didn't pawn our table off on to someone else.\n\nThe food matched the service and was EXCELLENT, however the soups (only two) and we got both, tasted the same except one was green and one was red.

I never got to the front of that line so i decided I would re-visit its restaurant. I was NOT expecting this gorgeous setting. The ambiance was very romantic chic. I mean who wouldn't love the pleasant company of the bay bridge as one of your dining companions. So definitely, the ambiance gets a 5 stars hands down! \n\nService: The wait staff was civil but definitely didn't make us feel completely welcomed. You know that stereotype of the upscale restaurant that has really attractive people working there but looks down on the common folk? Yea, definitely gave off that vibe. However, by the end of the night, they warmed up to us. \n\nFood: Mixed with hits and misses. A hit, deserving of 4 stars, was the mixto and classico ceviche. The mixto had a thicker feel but it was really yummy with squid. The classico was your typical ceviche but any ceviche purist would love it. There was a thai inspired ceviche (mahi mahi) and also a Japanese ceviche (tuna), which were misses and I was disappointed. The thai was yummy but the Japanese inspired ceviche was simply tuna tartare. In fact, very uninspired. \n\nWe also had the empanada sampler, which had a very amazing crust. Personal favorites were the veggie and the chicken was pretty yummy. The seafood empanada fell short. The beef empanada was standard and I think I've had better elsewhere. \n\nDrinks! were really yummy. First time I had pisco and my gosh that shit is strong! Or maybe I just can't handle my liquor anymore. The PIsco punch was so yummy. My santa maria tasted like a strong sex on the beach.  I'd love to come back and revisit for their happy hour! \n\nConclusion: I'm gonna leave La Mar an open book because I have yet to try their entrees and their causas, which looked amazing. Also, heard great things about their desserts. But so far, I like what I see. Although La Mar is more of Peruvian fusion rather than a traditional approach, it's got a whole lotta yummy.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Their LA style launch has definitely paid off. Unfortunately, the details of this restaurant is still being worked out. I'm glad to have experienced it so that I won't have to return.\n\nFood: 4 stars\nFor the price point, they give you a good size portion. The flavor of the food is pretty good. Cebiche tasting for $24 was a good value. (they spell it with a \"b\" instead of \"v\" that we are used to) The potato dish with quail egg, crab, avocado puree was very good. Lamb shank was delicious, especially the mashed rice and the sauce on the plate. Seafood empanadas were awful, unfortunately.\n\nBeverage Program: 3.5 stars\nGreat selection of wine at great prices. We opted for California vs Spain flights of albarino and tempranillo. It was a clever concept, but the California wine that's \"fighting\" against the Spanish just doesn't carry it. I would say choose all of the fabulous new world wines that they have (plenty!) instead of California bottles there. Usually, the \"cost performance\" of the new world wines are better than the old world's.\nMany spelling error on sake list. It was very weird. We didn't get to try the cocktails.\n\nService: 3 stars\nYou will wait for a long time to be noticed here, as the line of communication between the servers, runners and the bussers are still fragile here. The servers are \"too good\" to take empty plates off the tables or give you ice water. So that attitude, we thought, was very LA in a bad way (as we've seen it first hand in the industry back home). Don't let your server course the meals out, but ask him/her to bring whatever comes out first, if you go there hungry.\n\nDecor/Up Keep: 3.5 stars\nFunky fun color scheme. Beautiful semi-private bar area behind the host stand. \"Historical\" bathroom kind of dirty, but oh well enjoy the history. A huge minus for leaving a big tall ladder right by the back entrance.

He also kept pushing us to order cocktails, and when we finally ordered, he came back 20 minutes later telling us that the Sangrias we ordered was out. Again, he did not apologize.  Same with the dessert, he just handed us the dessert menu and left. He didn't say a word or made recommendations on anything. When we finished looking through the dessert menu and got excited about ordering the esfera de chocolate, he came back to tell us that the kitchen is out on all the desserts except the limon tart and sorbet. We got excited over nothing and wished he had told us in the beginning. **The restaurant should just hire a robot to serve customers instead of him!!**\n\nThe two of us ordered Chicha Morada, Causa tasting, Anticucho Corazon, Lomo Saltado, and Ceviche Clasico. I wished the Chicha drink was sweeter. Everything else taste great except for the Ceviche Clasico. I've had better Ceviches at other Peruvian restaurants.

The location is great and the atmosphere is open and filled with light.  Outdoor seating is available on the Bay which is a great spot on a sunny afternoon.  The place looks nice.\n\nWe started with the Cebiche Clasico which was Halibut in a wonderful lime and habanera marinade with red onion and corn.  My only complaint about this dish was that the halibut has a texture that is best served in small pieces or thin slices when raw.  This dish had hunks of halibut.  Nevertheless the fish was quality and the marinade was delicious.  We also had the empanadas del mar.  These were stuffed with shellfish and what seemed to be yellow cheese.  They were pretty good.  Next I had the grilled, skewered octopus on herbed mash potatoes.  Out of everything this was the best this we had.  The octopus was young, fresh and tender and well grilled.  The dishes my wife had were bland and not worth mention.\n\nThe prices were high and the service was very slow and forgetful.

We had everything served family style (I'm not sure if this is the case with everyone) and had a great variety of dishes.\n\nWe started off with plantain and potato chips with three different sauces and moved on to the cebiche classico for the appetizers. I had never had cebiche in such big chunks, but there was no loss of taste here.

We were treated to chorillana (roasted thai snapper), atun,  and lomo saltado (essentially steak and potatoes, one of the signatures of Peruvian cuisine). I must highlight all of these not only because they were main courses, but all the care and precision that was put into their production.\n\nThe snapper was perfectly cooked, not really fishy, nor seafood mush. Atun, La Mar's take on seared Ahi Tuna succeeded where so many others fail. The outer rim of the fish was perfectly seared with peppercorns, yet not overly gummy or (fill-in other searing mistake here). As for the lomo saltado, if you are messing up steak and potatoes, you just shouldn't have it on your menu.\n\nOne of the best dining experiences I've ever had.

First the Hostess was missing a lot and you would get straglers walking into the dining area, including us when we first walked in, looking lost as hell or just sitting anywhere they wanted. Once we were seated, the waitress took our order and was great, then as it got busier we were totally put to the backburner.   We wanted to try dessert but she never came back and so we just asked for the check, then she totally forgot and waited more tables, so I actually had to flag down the manager and have him get us the check.  If it wasn't for the food this place would get less stars.  \nI'd go back, and i'll give the service the benefit of the doubt. Chalk it up to an inexperienced waitress......", "author": "Charles M."}

Let's just say, I am very disappointed after my recent experience. The restaurant isn't what it used to be. I have a HUGE problem with the services- very inflexible. \n1) Small tables/crammed- host was not flexible and refused to  accommodate us to a normal sized table. \nWe made a reservation for Noon during a weekend (the very first reservation for lunch). The host sat us at a tiny little table.  For party of 2, we were used to be able to sit at a table large enough for 4 people. When I asked if we could switch to one of the large tables as all of the large tables were available at that time, I was told NO and these were reserved for larger party. \n\nOf course, the so-called larger party didn't arrive until 1 pm (we were about 2/3 done with our lunch) and there were plenty of other \"large tables\" available to accommodate these people. \n\nI don't understand why La Mar is so inflexible to  accommodate its customers, given the prices they charge and more importantly, restaurant is a commodity business and their customers have ZERO switching cost. I guess I should be happy that we weren't told to hurry up and finish our food like one of the other reviewers. \n\n2) Portion is becoming smaller and prices have gone up vs. 6 months ago. \n\nLike I said, I was a loyal customer for almost a year.. loyal enough for me to notice remarkable differences in portion and prices. For example, the size of the Ceviche Tasting is about 2/3 of what it used to be and $2 more. Yes, $2 is nothing, but $2+much smaller portion= not a happy customer.", "author": "Rong S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-16", "description": "Bloody Lorcho, how I miss you!!!! Other pisco cocktails will have to become my new best friends.\n\n*The Experience*:\nI generally come and sit in the bar area during the afternoons to grab a drink with friends, but it always ends up that by the time we finish two or three cocktails we are all ready to nosh. Even though you popped in for just one drink because you have plans later to eat at the Ferry Building, you'll end up ordering a few appetizers and ceviches. Unless you hate pisco, you can't help but have more than one $10ish cocktail. The drinks are wonderfully mixed, the bartenders friendly, the bar area is inviting with long tables, stools, tall windows with light streaming through, and the view of the city's buildings and people walking/running by...if you get bored of your friends, there will always be something to see at La Mar's bar (also try out their awesome historic restroom for a piece of SF history). I've only come here once for an actual sit-down-made-a-reservation-for-4-kind of dinner and felt that La Mar is more of a lazy afternoon kinda place for me and my crew where we can get some bites to eat to tie us over so that we aren't starving when we are waiting in line for dinner somewhere else. \n\nI've also called to see if I could hold a bridal shower here because the space and the views are impressive. The staff here are so friendly and willing to work with allergies, etc. that I was disappointed I didn't end up using their venue and chefs for the party. Perhaps another time when I want to plan a party to impress out-of-towners with the great views of San Francisco from La Mar, I will call them back again and wait for their promptly-returned and very professional call. \n\n*The Food*:\nAs I've written in another post, I'm a sucker for ceviche and La Mar's ceviche satisfies my ceviche-taste-buds. There are also these yummy causas...whipped potato thingies...In full honesty, I'm usually a little tipsy when the food comes so I can't really remember anything specific about the food except: (a) I inhale the ceviche because the seafood mix is so delightfully fresh and wonderful to my pisco-laden tongue, and; (b) the causas are the fanciest mash potatoes I've ever eaten while drunk. \n\nWhen I was here for dinner we ordered a whole mix of foods like beef, fish curry and the same drinking appetizers I always end up getting. I was surprised that some of the \"Peruvian\" dishes tasted like someone was experimenting with asian-fusion. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since Peru has had a large share of Asian immigrants, but in my drunken state it just didn't really hit the spot...was it Peruvian? Asian? Can I just get another drink?\n\n*Would I Eat Here Again?:\nWhen my beloved Bloody Lorcho was at this place, I would've said , \"Hell yea!\" But since the bar no longer makes that delicious, spicy, bloody mary with pisco and cut up baby octupus that is known as the Bloody Lorcho, I can't really say, \"Hell Yea!\" It's more of a \"Ok, sure!\" The feeling is I'm more than happy to go if friends make the suggestion, but wouldn't really think to suggest La Mar for a night out. I would take people from out of town for the views and use of space, but I would only think of it if we've exhausted other cuisines and restaurants in the city.", "author": "Patricia S."}

He was recently in Lima and attempted to go to the La Mar Cebicheria Peruana there, but said it was WAY too crowded and couldn't get in. He was elated to find out that we had the same restaurant here. And it would be interesting to compare the two places. \n\nWe arrived really early since everyone has said they had to wait so long for their food. The hostess gave us the \"We're clearing the tables now\" speech. Yeah right... So we went to the bar and grabbed a drink while waiting to be seated. I guess we were lucky since we only waited about 10 minutes for our table. But we were not seated by the window like I asked. Oh well. \n\nI started with the Scallops and octopus in aj\u00ed rocoto emulsion with cilantro and Peruvian corn. It was wonderful. The flavors went very well together and the corn was GREAT! For my entree I had the vegetarian risotto. The flavors were good, however this was not risotto and the rice was WAY undercooked. Couldn't finish it. My friend ordered the \"lomo saltodo\" which he says is his favorite peruvian dish. It's Traditional Peruvian style stir-fry of saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, aji amarillo with potato fries and rice. He took a few bites, but didn't like it. So I guess that was a miss too. Overall, he said the place in Lima was defintely better, but that was to be expected anyway.\n\nService wise. It's not bad, but there is still much left to be desired. Our server with pretty absent the entire time. \n\nThe space though large and beautiful, is a wide open, lightly decorated space therefore it is EXTREMELY LOUD inside. This is not a date place in ANY WAY. This is more of a business dinner location. \n\nI will be back, but next time I think I'll just sit at the cebiche bar.", "author": "Jen D."}

This didn't disappoint.  The pisco sour's are awesome, I had like 4 of them.  The bartender I talked with at the beginning knew nothing about the different types of pisco they offered and didn't understand me when I ordered a Pisco sour with a special type of Pisco, and gave it to me in a shot glass.  Once I explained it to him, he made it with the special type of pisco, but it came out to $14!  Wow.. a little bit overpriced so I stuck to the well pisco after which isn't as smooth but still good.  Next time, train your bartenders better if you are trying to open a Peruvian restaurant.  I also only met 1-2 peruvian people working there.  My waiter was from Venezuela and the bartender was American.  Not as traditional but they still do a good job.\n  \nThe Ceviche did not disappoint.  I got the Mixto.  It was tender and the sauce was perfect, but very spicy.  I loved the plantains they give you with the sauces at the beginning as well.  We also had the causa tasting which was really good but I didn't know if wouldn't be hot.  I told the waiter that my friend didn't like spicy foods and some of it was spicy as well.  Other than that the tuna one really shined!  DO NOT go to Limon or Fresca anymore, there is NO COMPARISON to the ceviche here.  Last time I went to those places, the ceviche was so chewy I couldn't even swallow it.  Here it is tender and cut perfectly.  The Octopus was some of the best I've ever had.

It's sits there  unassuming, next to the ferry building (in all its glory) with an inauspicious exterior.  The interior was quite chic with palette of teals and ocean blues. Textured against mango greens and Caribbean yellow hues.  \n\nThe restaurant is quite large for a restaurant in \"the city\" with a trendy bar which is next to a nicely open waiting area.  The ambiance was nice, unpretentious while remaining upscale and authentic.\n\n The food was great, I mean surprisingly good.  We had three kinds of cebiche; One was with Ahi Tuna and had Thai flavorings that had fantastic in flavor, another one was a cebiche classico, which was, normal, it was a classic cebiche.  It reminded me of going back to basics and executing something light, clean and delicious, then the third was by far the best tasting cebiche I have ever had.  It was made with halibut (considering the season just started, it was quite a beautiful quality).  This cebiche had flavors of grapefruit and lime, habanero chilis and sweet yam.  It was incredibly fresh and left me with a feeling of wanting more.  As if this wasn't enough they brought us fresh fried chips and plantains with three dipping sauces and some peruvian nuts that when paired with the liquid left over from the cebiche was texturally interesting while still emphasizing flavor.\n\n  Service was funny, kinda clumsy (wasn't sure if it was because they didn't speak English).  Perhaps its funny, because this place is eerily authentic.  I was completely satisfied with my experience and will be here again.\n\n5 stars!", "author": "Shaun C."}

And if you are Peruvian (like me) you should calm your nerves a little before going there and paying 10 times more for the smaller version of the same food you pay back in Peru. Now, with that said, La Mar is one of my favorite restaurant experiences in San Francisco. \n\nI have been there several times and even celebrated my birthday there with first time Peruvian eaters. The food tastes like your mom's food (at least like my Mama), the service is excellent (Pamela is always The Best) drinks are... well, after trying them all I still have to find one that I do not like. But the main reason for me to go back to this restaurant, is the variation and uniqueness of their menu. You can find the same dishes we (Peruvians) eat at special occasions as well as the corner food you eat after a night of drinks with friends. \n\nExcellent setting and on a sunny day I highly recommend eating on the waterfront part.  \n\nThe only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the size of their portions are too small for the price of their food.", "author": "Luis G."}

But first, I took a sharp turn into the bar, rowdy with beautiful people having a rollicking good time.\n\nI stepped into the chaos and ordered the Pisco Punch while I waited for the birthday girl and her entourage to arrive. Ummm... dangerous. Sweeter than a margarita and more drinkable, by the time our full dinner party had arrived, I was two sheets to the wind. Did that stop me from ordering a second drink? No. I tottered over to our table for 20, balancing my Cholo-politan carefully.\n\nAn intoxicating blend of pisco and passionfruit guava, it was the perfect palate prep for the smorgasbord of yellowtail, halibut, tuna and calamari ceviche. The octopus appetizer looked dubious, but it ended up being the stand-out dish of the night! Tender and breaded, it's the fried chicken of the sea. My ahi tuna entree was a worthy follow-up, too beautiful to eat, served on a bed of sweet potato and drizzled in a plate-licking-good sauce.\n\nI still can't decide whether I liked the cocktails or the food better.

We ordered the ceviche sampler, which was good, and the causas tasting menu, which looked beautiful but was surprisingly bland in taste--I wish we hadn't ordered it. We should have noticed when the server was less than enthusiastic when we ordered the causas but was very happy when we ordered the ceviche.\n\nThe ceviche and causas took so long that by the time we were done with them it was about 9:15. We had ordered entrees, and by the time it got to 9:50 we told our server to cancel our order and bring us the check unless we got them immediately. I mean, seriously, almost 2 hours to get to the entrees? Every stage of our dinner was slooooowwww, and when we suggested that the kitchen was off in their timing, our server seemed relieved that we realized it wasn't his fault and hinted that this wasn't an unusual occurrence.\n\nFrustratingly long service (really, 15 minutes for a cocktail? Almost 2 hours to get to the entree??) and just average food for a high-profile restaurant means that I will never return nor recommend this restaurant to anyone. I doubt it will be around in 2 years unless it can survive solely on non-repeat customers like tourists.\n\nI'm very disappointed because I have a business colleague who travels to Peru a lot, loves the food/drink there, and I was looking forward to taking him to La Mar.

However, I thought the Cebiche Tasting was a better \"starter\". \n\nAs for our meal, I got the Arroz Jugoso (seafood in juicy arborio rice) and my date had the Cordero (braised lamb shank). The Arroz Jugoso reminded me of a seafood paella but more soupy. The seafood again was fresh and really good. The arborio rice was cooked to perfection!

After a few minutes all the waiters and bartenders started arriving and the guy who was making our drinks i guess became the bus boy because two new guys took over. \n Everything started to go downhill from there.

What makes this a five-star place is the menu's finesse between tradition and sophistication.  The service was attentive and professional, the space was bright and inviting and well . . . the cocktails alone could have pushed this one to five-stars for me.\n\nWe stepped into the restaurant around the end of happy hour - right before the dinner rush on a Saturday.  We were seated right away at the cebiche bar.  Even with the rush of diners during our quick meal, the atmosphere and service did not suffer.\n\nI enjoyed the pisco sours in South America while I visited there a year or so ago, but the mixologists here were even better than the real thing.\n\nWe had the cebiche clasico and lomo saltado.  The balance of flavors and textures in the clasico made my day and the lomo sautee was just perfect, brought me right back to the Southern Hemisphere.  The fried plantains and sweet potatoes were ridiculously addictive and perfectly complimented by the sauces.  Portions were fair and the food in its quality is really quite a value.\n\nWe basically had to eat and run, and only realized it halfway through our meal.

Both restaurants in Lima served extremely good food, much better than the La Mar in SF.\n\nYesterday I went back to La Mar (the 3rd time) and I noticed that the food was not as good. The cebiches were ok, not great. I feel that the standard of cooking has gone down dramatically -- as if the kitchen is cutting corners rather severely. I think the original chef whom La Mar started with is gone? Is this correct? When they first opened, I would have given La Mar five stars. Now, only 3.\n\nThe prices are too high given what they are now serving so unfortunately I have to give this only 3 stars (the decor is superb and the pisco sour is still the best in SF). \n\nThe dining room is extremely noisy so if there are only two of you, better to sit at the cebicheria counter (which is like a sushi bar).", "author": "Esme V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-26", "description": "Establishing an upscale Latin restaurant (of any region) is a difficult task in and of itself. For the most part, you can get great Latin food (pupusas, tacos, ceviche, etc.) at many local hole in the wall places in SF at great bargain prices. To get people to pay a premium for items that they are not accustomed to paying is going to be difficult for customers to swallow (as evident in some of the reviews of people referencing portions and prices). On top of that, given the location (view along the water), you are going to pay another premium for the real estate lease (you should come to know this by now, if not, you have lots to learn).\n\nSecondly, the concept of tapa-style restraurants is still relatively new or hard to come by for many. For one, tapas bars/restaurants are pretty lively and noisy - it's all about the ambiance and the people you're with.  If you don't like noisy places and you used that in your justification of a low rating here, then it's you're fault for not conducting your proper due diligence. Portion sizes (by definition) are small - if you haven't grasped that by now, well your fault again. \n\nAll above mentioned info I just summed up for you should be common knowledge; if not, you'll sorely be disappointed all because of your lack of realistic expectations.\n\nNow on to my review. The place itself is huge - bar area in the front on the right is great for drinks and appetizers; ceviche bar (like a sushi bar) on the left past the bar is great for light meals and small groups; formal dining area in the back is great for a nice sit down style meal with that special someone or small group wishing for a little less noise and slightly more privacy; and lastly the outdoor deck on the water is perfect for those nice, warm days/evenings. With four different areas and all with their unique, decorative tastes, they manage to complement each other perfectly for almost any occasion/gathering. \n\nThe specialty drinks here are mostly pisco based and so if that's not your thing, there is a pretty extensive wine list from South America. I tried the chi-cha tu ma and it was great (pisco, chicha morada, triple sec and passion fruit shaken and served with an orange twist). I later learned that it's one of their most popular drinks and rightfully so - very smooth and full of flavor.\n\nAs for the food, I decided to go with one of the few beef-based items on the menu - rocoto relleno. A little spicy and a little sweet nonetheless, but bursting with so much flavor. A dish this size would usually leave me feeling hungry still, but not this time (quite a feat).\n\nYes, this place is the new, trendy 'it place' in SF (i.e. swanky blue/green lighting at the bars) but once all said and done, this place will continue to go strong and serve a greatly ignored niche in the SF restaurant scene - great-tasting, upscale Latin food in a classy,chic venue. The salsa music playing in the background is the perfect touch for a place like this.\n\nFyi, lines for the bathrooms can be long - two unisex bathrooms for a place as big as this is not enough.", "author": "E E."}

What good is a restaurant if it doesn't have character and good food to back it up?  La Mar had a wonderful menu and had more than just your average ceviche, which is what most people know about Peruvian cuisine.  \n\nI will confess that I don't know much about Peruvian Gastronomy other than my love for ceviche, which is why I had been wanting to try out this new spot.  We didn't count on experiencing getting an education while chowing down on a great meal.  \n\nThe menu was rather diverse and a lot of fun!  It was exciting to pick out some new items.  Though, be warned, the ceviche is not what we Americanos are used to!  Despite this, the food was lovely.  Even better, our server, Melissa, was very knowledgeable about the food.  She not only understood the food and perhaps what wine to pair it with, she also had an opinion!  Most servers are neutral and will almost agree with you on anything, but Melissa was refreshingly honest about what would excite our palates and create a lasting impression.  \n\nSo, let me wax a little more about our server because she really does deserve it!  I was getting a little impatient that our food was coming out quite slow (to the point that sauces congealed a little bit by the time they arrived at our table, which meant that they had been sitting out quite a bit overlong).  Melissa did take note of this and comp'd our dessert.  Not only did she notice and take action, she also made sure that the wine my boyfriend ordered was served by the glass even though a menu change had taken place and this particular label shouldn't have been available.  Wow!  Kudos to Melissa for being attentive and intuitive.  And, Kudos to the management for being savvy.  \n\nMmmm...dessert...amazing!  That's all I can say because I am daydreaming about how incredibly light, but still rich and gooey, the chocolate was from the beignets.   \n\nWe were also impressed with the wine list.  While we aren't too familiar with Torrontes or Albarinos, it was nice to see other labels being presented to consumers.  It shows risk taking and a thoughtfulness about pairing certain cuisine with its regional counterparts.  \n\nThe only reason I shy away from the 5 stars is because of slowness of food service.  I don't mind lingering over my meal, but I don't think it shows well for a restaurant when food  is prepared then sits too long at the counter waiting to be served.  \n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience.  I would love to go back!", "author": "Piat O."}

(They have an Opentable terminal but haven't put the restaurant up on the sytem yet.) And then, when we were finished, they comped us the meal, which the waiter said they were doing in compensation for us telling them what we thought. I'll get to that, but suffice it to say that this place has a great attitude toward customer service. \n\nAnd the food's really good too! I've only been to Peru once, so I can't attest to authenticity (but it feels good that there are already restaurants in Mexico and Costa Rica in addition to Peru). A whole section on ceviche; we each had a half order each of criollo and chifa, both excellent with distinct tastes. (Recommend trying as many as possible in the tasting version.) I had the sopa parihuela and the soup itself was rich and spicy and the fish done just right. We shared the ricoto relleno, which my lunch partner found too spicy (occasioning hickups!) but I found just right. He had the atun entree, spiced and seared tuna with purple corn sesame sauce and a pineapple chalaca salsa; his complaint - not enough salsa for the volume of tuna. \n\nSince they comped us the meal, I didn't get a price to compare to. But I'm going to make this one a regular on my foodie itinerary!\n\n2nd visit on 9/30: Popularity is the enemy of this restaurant. Our waiter was overwhelmed. Despite that, we didn't like him because he kept popping to tell us that he would be right with us and then didn't return. I actually went to the service bar to get my own glass of wine. Food was just as good as the first time (try the Lomo Saltado!), but service was the opposite: incompetent and inconsistent. Hope they figure out how to manage such a large restaurant soon.\n\nAlso: Note to the wise. It's a loud restaurant anyway, but don't sit near the front door if you don't want a squalling baby sound in the mix. The restaurant seems to park families with really loud babies at that one table inside the door. We thought we were saved from the first one when the family left, but the next family had an even louder baby.", "author": "Stewart A."}

Nothing I'd want to eat again.\n\nOrdering is a gamble. Beware! Some of the food  is waaaay too salty (Octopus skewers = salty like jerky, inedible and chewy) and barely palatable. The night that we went, the prawns were all \"turned\" and we had to return 3 of our dishes that contained the vinegary, rotten shrimp.

I went with a group of 6 people, so between us we all shared:\n\nMixto: OK - nice & fresh. The Mahi Mahi was actually pretty good.\nChifa: There was something funny about the sauce on this one. Curry??\nClasico: Again, not bad, but not great, either. Looks better in the photo.\nNikei (contained the rotten shrimp.) Sauce was hardcore teriyaki-tasting.\n\nNikei tiraditos: blah, more of that soy-drenched flavor. It sounds good on the menu, and supposedly has passion fruit and honey in it, but it really just tasted like teriyaki.\n\nCausa tasting: Yuck! Four beautiful little cupcake looking things made of a base of mashed purple or sweet potatoes and topped with either crab, asparagus, tuna, or other seafood. Bummer that they did not taste any different from the stuff we'd been eating all night. Bland - doesn't taste a fraction of how good it looks.\n\nEmpanadas: blargh, like eating a bouillion cube-stuffed fried pierogie.\n\nOctopus skewers: avoid at all costs. Burnt, dry, and SALLLLLTY!\n\nAlso, the dungeness crab stuffed with halibut and prawns was spoiled.\n\nThe dessert was equally bad: \nFried yam donut things that tasted like fish (fried in the same oil?) came with a Dr. Pepper-reduction flavored nasty dipping sauce. haha, funny, and fun playing \"guess that flavor,\" but disgusting.\n\nAnother dish had some kind of awful lemongrass and chile pepper yellow stuff on it that looked like deviled eggs.

What a beautiful space. I've been fortunate enough to be able to dine twice during the soft opening. The dishes I've tried are the various cebiche dishes, several tiraditos (thin slices of fish, similar to sashimi - no onions), the causa sampler, empanadas, norteno fried rice, the halibut entree, and the lamb entree. These dishes are so creative and so flavorful. The cebiche is bar none, the best I've ever had - these aren't too acidic, which I find a lot of cebiches to be.  I would have liked the fried rice dish to be spicier, but the mussel and clam in it just melts in your mouth...amazing. More mussels please!\n\nBasically, if the food is this good during the soft opening, you know it will only get better when it officially opens.\n\nAs far as alcohol, you can't go wrong with the pisco sour. YUMMY. Very refreshing and somewhat similar to a margarita - but way better. If I weren't such a lightweight, I could drink these all night. The other drink I tried is the pisco punch.

With that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe location is perfect, and the outdoor seating available makes it even a better choice on a beautiful day.  They have a small bar on the way in, and then a bar inside that wraps around the kitchen.  The restaurant is full of color and is very modern looking.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, making great recommendations for what we should try for our first experience.\n\nI started by ordering a Pisco Sour, the flagship drink of Peru, which to my surprise was made correctly and served in the right glass.  I knew the food was going to be amazing after this good start.  They came to the table with chips and dipping sauces.  My favorite was the papa a la huancaina sauce which was not to cheesy and also not to thick.\n\nWe started with a sampler of three cebiches (Mixto, Clasico, and Nikei).  The mixto and clasico were traditional chebiches you find in Peru.  Full of flavor and you could definitely feel the freshness of the products.  They had just the right spice to them, and the presentation was very nice.  The Nikei was made with tuna and avocado, a surprise combination for a Peruvian.  It was definitely something different, nothing you will find in a traditional Peruvian restaurant, but a good option to have something different.  My only complaint is that the portions were VERY small, but the price was not.\n\nAs my main course, I had a very traditional selection in Lomo Saltado.  The beef tenderloin was very soft and cooked to perfection!  The taste of the fresh cilantro, garlic, aji amarillo, and onions brought back many childhood memories of all the lomo saltado's I had with my grandmother at all the restaurants she use to take me to in Lima. \n\nOverall, lunch for two did come out to $100 and the portions of the food are a little small.  For us Peruvians who are use to eating big portions for less than $10 a plate, stay away from this place.

The service was very attentive and friendly, with great food and drink suggestions. \n\nThe menu was full of items that jumped off the page and I can't wait to go back and try more. The sampler cebiche is a must-try if you are new to cebiche or want to become familiar with La Mar's range in flavor. My favorite of the 4 types of ceviche that come with the sample dish was the Chifa, a chinese-style leche de tigre. The other flavors were fantastic too, this one just stood out as having the most texture and freshest taste.\n\nFor a main course I tried the seared ahi tuna (Atun), and my date had the Halibut. Both were brilliant in taste and presentation. During the second trip to La Mar, I was with a bigger group and was able to try several other main courses. The most notable was the beef dish, the Lomo Saltado.

We got the cebiche tasting (four different ceviche), the causa tasting (again, four different causa), the empanada sampler (four different empanadas...do you see a trend here?), the ensalada limena, and the lomo saltado, which is apparently both a Chinese stir-fry and a traditional dish of Peru! How odd!\n\nMy favorite was the cebiche clasico, although all the ceviche was really good. Yum yum! The causas were all my least favorite - somehow the concept of piling toppings on a dense cylinder of colored mashed potatoes just didn't work for me. \n\nLooking around the restaurant, the non-sampler portions of the ceviche looked fairly large, and if/when I return it'll be hard to decide whether to do the sampler again or just go for the cebiche clasico.\n\nMy friends got the bunuelos chocolate de caliente dessert, which turned out to be little round dough balls with melted chocolate in them, with ice cream. Wow! For chocolate lovers, I'd definitely recommend it, although the \"banana and passion fruit\" ice cream flavor only tasted like cinnamon to me.\n\nAs far as service goes, it was slow, but we didn't mind.

It has surpassed my expectations.\n\nGaston Acurio's high reputation restaurants in Lima and other South American countries presented a challenge for reproducing in SF. Certain traditional ingredients in the preparation of Peruvian food, such as, the tantalizing taste of its hot peppers and the diverse local sea food, which abounds in the coast of Peru, are not so easily available here. But Gaston and his dedicated team of food prepares and bartenders have proved that it is possible to succeed when pride for one's own food heritage exists. \n\nGaston's vision of making Peruvian culinary treats known in San Francisco coincides with the re-emergence of Pisco, Peruvian national drink, a tasty and clear brandy that is in high demand by mixologists because of its versatility in the preparation of delicious cocktails and punches. The pisco bar in La Mar is another treat for cocktails aficionados. \n\nDon't miss the pisco sours along the tasty cebiches, they will bring pleasure to your palate. \n\nCongratulations to the food managers for bringing to San Francisco a truly Peruvian fare..", "author": "teresa s."}

The bar did not match the other parts of the restaurant, but all in all they did a nice job. The place was really noisy, but you can't do much about that.  Note that I usually like noise, but I could not hear the person next to me, which would have been fine, if the food was all that. Unfortunately, it came a bit short. \n\nWe ordered most of the small plates and entrees that came recommended by the server. While there were some hits, most did not even come close. The cebiche sampler was interesting enough. There was another fish sampler appetizer that we ordered, with small pieces of fish almost in a sushi presentation.  It was decent but not great.\nI would stay away from the halibut entree, which was very uninspiring and bland.  The sea bass entree, which was a special, was almost like a Gordon's fish filet over a McDonalds hashbrown, topped with a fried egg.  While I think that is a cool concept, the textures were all very similar and the egg made both the fried filet and potato soggy(and not isn that good way eggs do your hasbrowns for breakfast).  They also had a fried banana on the side, which did not really mix well with the other flavors.   \n\nAll in all, probably a 3 experience, but when you pay as much as you do here, you need more than just average.

Even though it was crowded it felt pretty spacious.\n\nIn terms of food, everything was beautiful presented (which was nice since the food was a little on the pricey side), and very tasty.\n\nBased on reviews by other yelpers, we and our friends tried the cebiche tasting which came with 4 different cebiches.  My favorite among those was what i believe to be the cebiche nikei, which was japanese-influenced.  We also tried the lomo empanadas which were quite good.  We also got the causa tasting and those were all very good.  They are like little towers of stiff mashed potatoes topped with seafood.  My favorites were those topped with dungeness crab and ahi tuna \n\nFor dinner we had one of the specials (fish skewers), the lomo saltado (which was delicious), the chupe de campornes (a rich shrimp stew which was very tasty) and the cordero (braised lamb shank - was good but my least favorite of all the dishes.\n\nFor dessert we got the beignets, which were little chocolate doughnut balls, oozing hot chocolate with a little bit of vanilla ice cream.  They were out of this world.\n\nThis is a great restaurant to go with other people as you get to try more of the great food that way.\n\nWas a great dinner out, and we would definitely recommend to others!", "author": "Emily W."}

At first glance I wasn't sure if I would like anything. But our friends loved it when they tried it last year, so I thought why not give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress Tildy was awesome. She was very attentive and friendly. She made great recommendations and made sure the dish I ordered was made without the cilantro. The food was delicious. Every course was wonderful including the lime dessert Tildy recommended. My friend cannot eat gluten and they have a gluten-free menu that is pretty substantial. She loved her food as well. The ambiance is very \"Miami Beach\" but in a classy way. It's a nice change from a lot of the restaurants in the area. I'm excited to share La Mar with friends in the future.", "author": "Kelly B."}

However, I'm glad to report that this place changed my typical expectations of a high end dining establishment that seemingly uses an ethnic association as their \"thing\".\n\nFirst impressions can be misleading.  Had some drinks at the bar while waiting for the rest of my party.  They definitely went for a note of authenticity by having both Cristal and Cusquena available in bottles.  Unfortunately I didn't find either to be very good, but hey, when in Peru, drink as the Peruvians do.  Bar area is definitely nice and if beer isn't your thing, the samples I had of some of their Pisco drinks are quite delicious.\n\nThe plantain chips and dipping sauces are an excellent and unique starter.  The menu is pretty big and you'll probably find yourself faced with a fair amount of decisions.  I was tempted to overlook everything except the main courses (it's just my habit) but do yourself a favor and check out the whole menu.  You definitely can't go wrong with the ceviche flight.  Each one is pretty damn unique, not to mention tasty.  \n\nThe skewer selection is rather diverse as well.  I had the octopus skewers which were absolutely delicious.  They were cooked in a way that made their texture more meaty, although I do enjoy them raw too.\n\nFor a main course, I had the chicken stew, which wasn't mind blowing but it was still pretty damn good.  Some of my dining partners got the lamb and THAT was amazing.  Think of a huge piece of lamb, meat so tender it literally falls off the bone.  Luckily one of my dining partners got full and let me finish hers.\n\nEven if I didn't eat my friends' food, I was definitely full just from what I ordered.  Everything was delicious and a real sense of effort was instill in the cuisine that we received.  I am impressed and will come back here.", "author": "Steven R."}

We made a reservation for 1pm a couple of days ago but got there early and they were able to seat us right away. :) The ambiance was nice, the service was excellent (fast but not rushed and very polite without being stuffy) and the food was amazing! It is on the pricier side, but was oh so good! We were given a standard complimentary chips (potato, plantain and yam chips) and trio of dips starter that was pretty good, instead of the usual bread with butter and salsa that you get at most Peruvian places.\n\nWe ordered an Empanada sampler and the Cebiche Classico to share as appetizers. The emapanadas were really yummy - 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 seafood and 1 mushroom. Yummy! The cebiche was melt in your mouth amazing. It was fresh mahi mahi with the right amount of savory and tart flavors as well as delicate layers of jalapeno and other flavors with a little bite at the end. It was soooo good -- the best cebiche that I have had in ages! My brother and I each had an order of a combo plate called Almuercito Criollo which was a mahi mahi skewer, a mushroom empanada and mixed seafood cebiche. It was beautifully presented and tasted even more amazing. The fresh mahi mahi was perfectly cooked - moist, tender, buttery and really well marinated. The cebiche was amazing and the empanada was delish! My fiance and our visiting friend both had the Carne (beef) skewer dish. They both said it was fantastic. The beef was tender, well marinated and cooked to perfection -- medium rare and served with chunks of potato that was also delish. I also had my standard Inka Cola - good as always. \n\nSo for 4 entrees, two appetizers and a soda it came out to about $135 pre-tip. Not too bad, considering the quality of the food. Dinner there is pricier so I would recommend going there for lunch not only because it's easier to get in but also because of the price differential. Either way, I highly recommend trying this restaurant -- it is definitely worth it! I wish it was a bit more affordable for dinner though, as I would love to go there more regularly.

This past weekend, I had friends visiting from Alaska and Texas and suggested we grab a drink and some small plates at La Mar- terrible decision. We came into the lounge area and were the only ones- we ordered drinks and about 8 small plates to share between the 5 of us. Our drinks came out and about 20 minutes later, they brought our chips. A few more tables filled and we noticed they were getting food and ours still hadn't come. We ordered another round of drinks, asked about our food and were told it was on the way. About 20 more minutes went by and we got our drinks and 2 of the empanadas we ordered but nothing else. We noticed the table next to us that arrived way after us got a whole order that looked exactly like ours. We asked again about our food and they said it would be right out but they would bring more chips in the interim. Three orders of chips later, no food. Our waiter was very unaware of the fact that we didn't have food- kept telling us that \"of course\" it was coming and the manager was really flustered and not very apologetic nor accommodating- he blamed the printer the first time we asked and then blamed the new server who mixed up the table numbers. After about an hour and 15 minutes of waiting, I finally let him know he could cancel our food orders because we were tired of waiting. He just said fine and brought the check. He tried to explain they were really busy and he was sorry but at this point- we were really frustrated.

They are very good and you start thinking what kind of experience is coming ahead.\n\nWe then ordered our drinks: Chicha tu ma and Pisco Sour.  My wife loved the Chicha Tu Ma, made of pisco, lime, chicha morada and passion fruit juice. The pisco sour was a bit sweet for my taste. We shared a Cebiche Clasico and Cebiche Mixto, as appetizers.  The cebiches were delicious; fresh halibut fish with a very good balanced citrus flavor. For the main dish I ordered Rocoto Relleno, my wife ordered Jalea Mixta and my daughter ordered Pasta Criolla, and we all agree that each main dish was very good. Finally, for dessert we got Picarones and Tiramisu with Lucuma ice cream, they were okay.\n  \nThe only surprise from our whole experience for us was the portions; they were very, very small!  We felt silly because we ordered extra plates for sharing our food and realized the entrees, main dishes and desserts were so tiny that you cannot share it!  It seemed like they were worth just four tablespoons. In this economy, the owners should consider lowering the prices or increasing the portions.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal, but more expensive than it was worth.

Since we were drinking we also ordered the mead dish with fries. If you are expecting french fries or papas fritas do not order this dish because it's mostly all meat featured with a few pieces of fries.  I was all about this because the meat was tender and flavorful. It also comes with rice on the side.  \n\nThe service is great. The waiters are attentive and give honest opinions on what are the top picks.  The ambiance is great - beautiful bright, vibrant colors.  I would definitely dine here again.", "author": "Jenn R."}

We moved on to albarino, ceviche and causas. I died. Then we had empanadas, fish, lamb shank, and lomo. I loved the slight asian influence in the dishes.

There is even a patio where you can soak up the sun on those rare days on the bay, but be sure to have a reservation (we tried w/out one and were denied).\n\nStaff is a little awkward.  On our first trip we gave up trying to order a pre-dinner drink at the bar after about 10 minutes; there was also a very long wait between our order and the arrival of our ceviches, which was recognized by our server who comped us a delicious dessert.  Second time around, it seemed pretty dead at lunchtime on Saturday, but we were kept waiting for a while.  Our friends received not one but two wrong orders, and the server wasn't what I would call apologetic, he took the first dish back grudgingly, then told us to keep the second one for free.  \n\nAs for food, there are some hits and misses.  The grilled octopus is heavenly, most of the ceviche are good but the special ceviche a la chipotle is too saucy, which turned me off, though the taste was good.  Unfortunately the scallops were overcooked or undercooked but not right, somehow chewy.\n\nDesserts are good and worth trying.  The wine list is also affordable and interesting, as are the cocktails.\n\nI agree with many other reviewers in that they need to up their staff in terms of quantity and quality.", "author": "Aimee B."}

We had a reservation and had a to wait about five minutes before we could be seated, once we were seated we looked at the menu and decided on the drink and starters we would get. We waited, we waited and waited some more. After fifteen minutes the waiter finally came and seemed really bored, but oh well, lets order and not worry about him. Finally our drinks came which were ok. I had the pisco sour, which cost $13 and half of the drink was egg white foam which was annoying. Later in the meal we ordered another drink but when they came to us the drinks were the wrong ones. From that point on we really didn't see the waiter much. When he did come he grabbed my drink, which was still a quarter full and walked away. My wife and I looked at each thinking, wtf, did he really just do that. Overall the food was good but for the price you pay the service should really be on point.", "author": "Ryan G."}

The atmosphere is fresh, almost tropical, and inviting. In the very open space, it's as if La Mar created their own indoor super gentle breeze. \n\nThe space: There were several areas to choose from...\nBar ~ Roomy, good seating, big windows look out onto Embarc. Prolly really great at happy hour. Or, would be great to host a happy hour. Mixed cocktails were fruity. I wasn't a fan of the bar \"corn nuts\" though.\n\nLounge ~ Great teak cushioned furniture line an open space that lines the wall. It's perfect for a private, cozy dining, or for a casual bite. I would sit there for apps and drinks and/or dessert. \n\nSushi Bar ~ Parallel to the lounge is sushi bar-type seating. It seemed just fine, but the least interesting of all the seating options. \n\nRestaurant ~ The wide open dining space is New England meets Tropical, with its clean painted white and wood finishes, and bright aqua, lime, lemon, and fuschia accents. The views of the Bay anchor the setting.\n\nOutdoor ~ I didn't get a chance to go out there, but it seemed cool. You sit right out there on the pier.  \n\nThe food: We ordered several ceviches, sashimis, a vegetarian risotto, and the lamb shoulder. Overall everything was fresh and on par. No particular complaints. The food wasn't phenomenal, but just good, solid, and fresh. Must note - that the tiny alfajores (sandwich cookie with dulce de leche) that accompanies the coffee was perfect.\n\nDefinitely make reservations for din. I think this is a great working lunch spot!\n\nOverall, it's a solid dining experience. However, it has just a very tiny tendency to feel a little too contrived and almost commercial.

Since the weather has been so great, I've been walking along the Embarcadero everyday.  When I passed my La Mar, I immediately thought that someone finally named a place after my fabulous black gay alter-ego.   \n\nAfter a few days of walking, I got very curious about trying La Mar out.  So, when my friends wanted to take me out for a belated birthday, it was the perfect excuse to try this place out.  \n\nOn a Friday we ventured into the Lions' Den without a reservation.  The hostess coldly told us that the wait was an hour for a seat at a counter.   Hey, I didn't blame them since they knew they were holding keys to the hottest place in town.  Since some of us had not eaten all day, my ingenious friend had plan.  She asked politely for the manager.  She was told that Rodrigo was tending bar cause they were being slammed.  She marched right over and greeted him like they were BFFs.  Before you know it, the hostess says, \"I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were friends with Rodrigo.\"  and we were lead to a primo window seat.  Sweet.  See what a little moxie gets you?  No need to slip anyone some cash, just go in with confidence.\n\nI ordered a pisco sour which I discovered is really sweet.  I even ordered it light on the simple syrup!  \n\nThe service was a bit uneven.  They are really nice and accomodating but not very adroit when it is busy.  We had to ask a couple of times for the complimentary chips.  When they arrived, they became our favorite thing on the table.  I especially loved the plantain chips.  But since everyone is talking about dipping sauces, we didn't get any.  \n\nWe ordered the cebiche sampler.  I would have liked to see a bit more fish in the order.  I think each little plate had about two pieces of fish.  For $23, I could have gotten an entire fish.   \n\nThe empanada and tamalito were forgettable.  The Lomo Saltado was nice but reminded me a bit of Shaking Beef.  I'd take shaking beef any day.  \n\nThe desserts were odd.  We settled on the chocolate beignets because who doesn't like chocolate doughnuts?  They were okay which is strange because I've never met a deep-fried food I didn't love.  \n\nThe upside of this place is that it is gorgeous.  I like the original woodwork and the high ceilings.  \n\nI would go back with someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with Peruvian food and likes posh interiors.  \n\nOoops, I think that comment resembles me.", "author": "Monica L."}

It was too sour and I didn't really think there was a whole lot of alcohol in it.  Bummer.  Maybe I'm just partial to Piqueo's sangria.  In fact, Piqueo's (Cortland St in Bernal Heights) has stellar Peruvian food overall, and would hands down be my top pick if I was seeking Peruvian.\n\nSo overall, the bad fish thing put me off, but if it's nice out and I had guests in from out of town, I'd maybe sit on the outdoor patio for a drink.", "author": "Heather F."}

So when we arrived and realized it was in the nicest part of the waterfront, just a tad north of the Ferry Building and the front of the restaurant was hip with glass doors, I was relieved.\n\nFirst, you walk into an expansive area with the full bar to the right and then as you walk into the dining room with super high ceilings, you past a very serious counter/bar with all of the Peruvian seafood delicacies on full display, ala sushi bar style but with a Peruvian flare.\n\nDrinks are must and at $10 a pop you might as well go for the stylized drinks like the pisco sour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "\"Gaston Acurio is the most famous chef you've never heard of.\" -- San Francisco Magazine\n\n\nI'd been fascinated with the opening of La Mar, the first U.S. foothold in the formidable culinary empire of Peru's Gaston Acurio, ever since I first read about it a couple of years ago, primarily as a fun place to tie up a sailboat on the SF waterfront and enjoy a drink and food...something you generally have only been able to do in Sausalito or Tiburon.\n\nBut recently, since the opening, there's been a fair amount of rave reviews about the food, the vibe, the d\u00e9cor, the whole experience. It's become so popular that I didn't think we'd have any luck with a table but evidently the crowds are a dinner hour thing because when we walked in on Sunday at 1PM, there were only a few tables that had guests seated. Cool!\n\nThe colors in this place are the first wave of stimulation and seduction: brilliant, almost electric blues and yellow greens, contrasted with dark wood accents and bright white paint. The banquettes are a dusty blue and accented with muted orange pillows. The visual vibe is fun and has a way of creating a sense of anticipation for the food.\n\nWe had come to the waterfront for a cocktail, so now we had to figure out what said libation would be. I looked over the cocktail menu - all of the drinks sounded interesting, many if not all of the signature drinks feature Pisco, a Peruvian brandy - and had settled on \"Pisco Punch.\"  But our waitress Michelle made such a convincing case for the restaurant's signature Pisco Sour that I went for it instead. This was a decidedly good call. This drink is amazing...or as San Francisco Magazine put it, it's a \"zesty cocktail that's everything the margarita can only hope to be.\" Richard and I both agreed that the flavors in this drink matched the flavors in the food in a way that we've NEVER experienced outside of wine/food or beer/food pairing. You're going to have to taste it to know what I mean.\n\nThe Pisco Sour is the second act of seduction.\n\nFor the third, and your doorway to Pleasurable Delirium, start ordering ceviche. Oh, God.\n\nOrder at least two of them, maybe three. If you don't, you're crazy. If you don't want to spend a lot, go with the half-orders like we did. In addition to the great flavors, the ceviches are also the best showcase of the Asian-Peruvian fusion that is the hallmark of Acurio's food here.\n\nWe ordered two, the Clasico and the Chifa.\n\nBoth had moan-inducing, incredibly bright flavors. \n\nThe Clasico had more heat from habaneros. It features generous pieces of California halibut and red onions in habanero pepper \"leche de tigre\" marinade, with Peruvian corn and a cute chunk of marinated yam.\n\nThe Chifa has a decidedly Asian taste profile, with tender, sashimi-like yellowfin tuna, peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots and daikon, habanero pepper, wonton strips and cilantro in leche de tigre marinade.\n\nWe scarfed down the fish meat and vegetables with giddy abandon, leaving two dishes half-full of marinade that we loved so much that when Mario the wait assistant asked if he could get them out of our way we both whimpered, \"No!!!\"  When Michelle heard this she matter-of-factly offered to dispense the marinade into a couple of ...*shot glasses* for us. And she was actually serious. How freaking nice is that?\n\nIncidentally, here's something else remarkable about La Mar: the wait staff has obviously been extremely thoroughly coached to understand - and explain - the ins and outs of Peruvian cuisine. Michelle started out by asking us if we were familiar with Peruvian cuisine; take my advice and let the waiter walk you through the entire menu, it's incredibly helpful and interesting. And do go with their recommendations - the ones that she gave us proved to be unimpeachable.\n\nNext we shared the seafood empanadas: light, flaky pies stuffed with shrimp, vegetables and even a bit of hard-cooked quail egg. They were delightful.\n\nMario walked by as we were contemplating dessert, and we asked what he thought we should order. He didn't think twice before suggesting the picarones (God I hope I have -that name right...), light, deep-fried donuts of sweet potato batter served with a sweet molasses sauce. They were melt-in-your-mouth wonderful, to the point that I plated a bite size piece and passed it to our neighbors. They in turn offered a taste of their tiramisu with sorbet.\n\nOh, meanwhile, while I was at the other table, a staff member casually re-folded my cloth napkin for me into a tidy triangle. This could either be interpreted as obsessive-compulsive behavior, or extraordinary attentiveness. I'm going with the latter.\n\nWhenever Richard and I try a new restaurant, and it's a hit, one of us will invariably say \"I think we'll put this on the List.\" \n\nBut we both looked at each other at lunch today and realized, \"We gotta get a different list.\" This place is CRAZY good.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Gorgeous presentation and my favorite dish.  Dungeness is December is impossible to beat!\n\nLomo Saltado - beef stir fry with onion, tomato, cilantro, soy, garlic, and fried potatoes.  A unique and balanced combination (and not too salty, a common problem with beer and garlic/soy based stir fry).  Loved that what were essentially french fries were featured prominently in this dish!\n\nArrox Noreno - mussels, shrimp, octopus, calamari, and fried rice with clinatro and salsa criolla.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-06-10", "description": "This review is for individuals thinking of going to La Mar when hosting a large party or group event.  The experience we had with Mayra (La Mar's event planner) was so mediocre, non-engaging, and cold, I cancelled our reservation despite liking the food and venue.  The same day, we moved our business to Farina whose event coordinator Michael took care of us in no time flat!!   At Farina, Michael sat with us for 30 mins and we selected the set menu, wine, desert, decorations, got the private room for our event in 2 days time.  Simple, pleasant, and made my life easier!  \n\nBottom line with La Mar is that my fiance and I were looking to host a reception for family and friends after our city hall wedding.  After sending an email to Mayra explaining what we were looking for, I was sent a canned email from Mayra with the details and menu.  I was a little surprised since most other restaurants called me back to talk live (I had left her a message, but no call back), but hey, I guess if your restaurant is highly rated on Yelp, maybe you just think you can rely on the reputation of the restaurant versus providing good customer service?  Over the next few interactions, one word answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" were the norm in her emails.  No explanations of what the restaurant could offer, no suggestions to meet in person, just short and curt to the point I felt as though I was inconveniencing her.  If I'm about to drop $2K on a dinner, I'd expect a little more.  My fiance thought things did seem a little distant with her, but also thought maybe I was overreacting, but after he took over finalizing our details with her directly, he admitted he thought I was right and commented how she gave off the vibe she just wanted him off the phone.  (He actually thinks she's just in the wrong line of work and maybe just hates her job and takes it out on potential clients?

I liked the Pisco Sour but I felt myself making a pucker face which I knew looked funny so I stuck with my Pisco Punch, which I loved!  After about a 10 minute wait we got seated outside in the sun and it would have been okay if we had some sunglasses but it was way to bright, we couldn't even read the menu. Luckily we got switched over to a table in the shade but still looking out to the water so we got to keep our beautiful view =)\n\nWe ordered the Papa La Huancaina , Lomo Saltado and Anticuchos De Coraz\u00f3.  After we ordered they bought out yukon chips, plantains and sweet potato chips with 3 dipping sauces instead of your ordinary bread and butter.  My favorite was the fried plantains but by themselves, no sauce.  The Anticuchos De Coraz\u00f3 came out first and it was actually really good, the thought of eating beef heart is a little out of the ordinary but it was really good.  Just like really tender steak, I just wish they cooked it a little more so that it would have had a little crispiness to it.  The Papa La Huancaina was very good, I have never seen the purple potatoes before though and I thought the purple potatoes were a little harder than the other potatoes served in the dish.  And the Lomo Saltado was delicious but I really expected it to be.  If something was wrong with that dish I would be giving Lar Mar 1 star because the Lomo Saltado was what I was craving right when I walked in the door.  We were both very satisfied and both very full after our meal but when the waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu of course I said, \"Yes!\"  And then I ordered the Picarones which were a really great ending to our meal.  Now we were both satisfied but overly full :)\n\nSo the service at first was a little slow, I think because they had seated everyone around the same time, but after we ordered it started to pick up.\n\nI think Lar Mar was one of the places I felt I had to try at least once.

Having said that, La Mar has taken Peruvian food to a new level without losing it's \"soul\"  If we had been in San Francisco longer, I would have gone back to La Mar again.

Testing and sourcing the best ingredients,  intensive practice sessions before opening--repeated and refined when the kitchen was finished on site. Last evening we went to a soft opening dinner, and every single dish sang to us. Four of us tried cebiches, causas, sopas, entrees and desserts (oh, the pumpkin fritters with fig syrup, you would not believe!)--and reveled in the clean flavors, outstanding quality and generosity. The space is beautiful, our server was top-notch, friendly, informed and eloquently enthusiastic about the food. Did I mention unpretentious?  No wine until Monday's opening, but the Pisco based cocktails were strong and excellent. \n\nWatching the crew in my kitchen, I know that the cebiches start with such lovely things as freshly made lobster stock and fish stock, and indeed you can get shooters of the Leche de Tigre bases for the ceviches, which are each distinctive, delicate and appropriate to the fish they are paired with. When you are first seated, you get a basket of fresh, greaseless crisp fried plantain, yam and potato chips and three dips--based on the special chilies imported from Peru.\n\nThis is going to be one of the most popular restaurants in SF, with good reason.

The rice was just white rise ( 5 bucks for a side of white rice?,!!!) she kept rushing so I ordered our food. The waiter had a slight ironic personality and annoying at the same time. I asked her if she had any salsa to go with the rice, who would want to eat just plain white rice after all?  She gave me a look like if I asked the weirdest question.

They even put up with my annoying showoff foodie questions and knew exactly what was in each dish--\nMe: \"So, what's in this red sauce- is this aji amarillo?\"- \nWaiter: \"No, it is aji arnaucho. The yellow one is aji amarillo.\"\nMe:  \"Ok, so what makes it thick, cream? \nWaiter: \"Actually, we put a little crackers in it to thicken it.\"\nMe: \"So what's in this drink that makes it look like egg yolks?\"\nWaiter: ....\nIt continued like this all night long and they were totally cool about it!\n\n \nAlso, I asked whether the Chef was available and the waiter told me that he might come in later. We finished our dinner and on the way out the waiter ran over to tell us that the chef arrived so we could meet him. Awesome service!\n\nI liked the FOOD--La Mar's food really impressed me and I eat alot of peruvian food.  \n\nTo start with, they give you a basket of chips-I think they are plantain, potato and yam chips--they were delicious! And the 3 hot sauces (mild, medium, hot) they come with were to die for, especially the hot one-  you could dip a freakin sock in it and it would taste good..yumm...    \n\nThe ceviches were delicious! I had the ceviche tasting--four different types of ceviches--nikei (Japanese style ahi), chifa (yellowtail tuna with a Chinese style sweet and vinegary dressing), traditional and mixto (mahi mahi and octopus) . We also ordered the Causa tasting which was similarly presented and excellent. \n\nThe presentation of the food was beautiful (looks just like the pics here). If you are not into the foofy food thing then you might not really care...I admit I like foofy food and so for me the presentation was the icing on the cake!\n\nI liked the AMBIANCE--it is right on the waterfront so there is a beautiful view, and even the inside of the restaurant itself is very beautifully designed--high ceilings, nice open kitchen, modern but not sterile. \n\nI liked the CHEF- we met him and he was nice..not super special nice but nice enough. \n\nI liked the DRINKS- I hate sweet drinks--I never ever drink them--but I tried their pisco sour and some passionfruit umbrella-ish drink and I loooved them both. Amazing!\n\nI liked the LOCATION- right in my neighborhood and on the beautiful waterfront, just a couple steps away from Americano, Ozumo, and other pre/post-dinner drink spots.\n\n\nMe no likey? Me no likey the fact that my review and the other good reviews will make it harder for me to get a table at this already popular spot!

One word: underwhelming.\n\nWe ordered the entree with \"seared beef and catch of the day\", the better description should have been \" dried beef and catch of yesterday\". It consisted of cubes of old beef with not so fresh pieces of squid and some kind of fish. And it was incredibly salty. I guess it seems like they overdrenched it with soy sauce. You know, something that Chinatown restaurants do when they try to sell you yesterday's leftover food. But this is a waterfront restaurant. C'mon people! I think I consumed enough sodium for the whole year. The waiter never came around to refill the water until we were almost done with dinner. Here is the kicker..... we ordered 2 bowls of rice to help tone done the saltiness and they charged us $10 for the rice. Is there gold laced into the rice? WTF! When the waiter came around, we told him that the rice was the best part of the meal. He replied, that's what people come back for. Who ever pays $28 for old over salty meal and comes back again is a fr**king idiot. I truly can't believe how some businesses get away with this. I don't mind ponying up for good food BUT this is pure robbery. OVERPRICED subpar food!!!\n\nSo here is a recap:\n1) Nice ambience and waterfront location = 4 stars\n2) Waiter with an attitude = - 1 star\n3) Water not refilled until the end of dinner = 0 star\n4) Subpar over salty food at skyrocket prices = -1 star\n5) Waiter pushing this entree (when asked for recommendation) which litterly had 8 thin sliced pieces of fish. Everyone thought it was either a joke or the first of a 2 part entree. Nope = -1 star\n\nOverall = 1 star (and I'm being generous here)\n\nI really didn't want to give this place or any place such a low rating, but there were just too many negatives with this experience. For anyone planning to visit this place, there are a couple consistent themes that are on this and other reviews: \"pricey\", \"salty\", and questionable \"service\".", "author": "Anthony X."}

I have been dying to try this spot for quite awhile now and last Friday night seemed like the perfect time.  Arrived to a packed and jammed bar, not a bad sign.  Found a seat and settled in for a glass of vino and then some food.  First of all, the wine pours... what a joke!!!  I thought they ran out of one bottle and were heading back to grab another to top my $10 glass of wine off.  But alas no....  Hmmm....okay, then the food.  I think the food was good but it was covered so heavily in sauces I am not sure if the fish was tasty or if it was the sauce.  And very over priced for the portions. \n\nThe service was good but at the end of the night when the bill arrived, I noticed at the bottom the recommended tips were 18%, 20% and 25%. 25%... WTF??  Who sets these tipping parameters in this country, oh wait, let me guess, the food and beverage industry.  And to rub salt further into the wound followed by a drop of lemon juice, they calculated the tips on the total.  As if  I am supposed to tip the waitress on the sales tax AND the health care surcharge.  That would have been $5 more for her based on that theory.  Oh god help this city and this tipping culture.\n\nSo basically I walked out of La Mar sober, hungry and broke.   Not a winning recipe in my book for a Friday night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-09", "description": "Here's the thing: I'm not convinced that good food needs to be routinely expensive. \n\nLa Mar is beautifully and richly appointed in terms of decor and ambiance. Azul blue, glass and steel--it wouldn't be accurate to say it was warm, but it doesn't feel cold or uninviting; polished and sleek come to mind. The vibe was what one would expect after work near the Ferry Building: suits and pencil skirts actively buzzing with banter, unwinding over cocktails and ceviche.\n\nI sat at the bar, determined to try the Pisco Punch (an SF original), and realized there was no way I could pass up a food order. 2 appetizers seemed reasonable. I ordered the Cebiche Clasico (Halibut, habanero pepper, Peruvian corn and yam) and Causa Criolla (causa, according to their website is a \"cold dish made of cooked and pressed papa (potato), aj\u00ed (chili pepper), lim\u00f3n (lemon)...you fill it with different types of fillings such as vegetables, meat, fish and shellfish, as well as mayonnaise.\" Mine had Mahi Mahi, quail egg, avacado puree and Huancaina sauce). \n\nThe Cebiche was very good--the marinade was addictingly tangy and it was hard not to drink the remains of the juice afterward. The Causa was good, but with all of the \"exotic\" ingredients I was disappointed to find that it mostly tasted like very well seasoned balls of mashed potatoes. Good mashed potatoes, mind you, but not what I was hoping for.\n\nThe Pisco Punch was my first and while I liked the refreshing sangria-like taste, I'm not sure it  would become a staple order for me. Still, very well made.\n\nReally my biggest complaint was the drink and two appetizers came to nearly $50 ($48.95) including tip. The appetizer portions were relatively small and could hardly qualify as dinner and spending $50 on a pre-meal is a bit rich for my post-bailout blood.", "author": "Alexis W."}

About fifteen minutes after the reservation time, the hostess came by and asked for my  name and explained that she had been looking all over for me.  I was literally five feet from her the whole time.  I guess she didn't look very far.\n\nAs far as the drinks, I thought they were in the expensive range and the wine by the glass was about half the size it should have been for the price.  \n\nThe service was okay - nothing memorable, except there were a few mess ups that were just never commented on - like bringing us plates/silverware and then taking them away without saying anything.  \n\nWe got the embanadas, which were good, but nothing spectacular, and the peanut mahi mahi cebiche, which tasted like your run of the mill cebiche, but with peanuts.  I got the first rice dish on the menu and the way my waiter sold it I thought it would be amazing.  Instead it tasted like every paella I've ever gotten at a Spanish restaurant, which is fine, but don't sell it like it's something I've never experienced before.

If I had been more hungry, I would have drank the sauce out of the bowl (actually probably not, but it was definitely delicious).

My guests had the empanada sampler which included a corn, chicken, seafood and beef empanada. The corn one is almost sweet with a polenta like inside but all were tasty. I wouldn't recommend it as an entr\u00e9e though; it is only four empanadas so you might need to grab a salad too. The atun is an ahi tuna that was seared perfectly with a peppery sauce on top and purple potatoes. I would go back and get that and the lomo saltado again. Presentation was great too. I polished it off with a refreshing hierba Buena cocktail that has a rosemary infused pisco which was perfect for a warm night.\n\nValue:\nReasonable; entrees are between $19-$31, entr\u00e9e amounts are plentiful but I would still suggest getting an appetizer if you have guests so that everyone can sample everything. \n\nReturn:\nYes.

Couple different bar areas, one secluded from the restaurant area the other central in the entrance way to the main dinning area.  Both have a great, but different feel to them (nice to have the variety and choice).\n\nUpon being seated we were brought a basket of freshly made fried chips, plantains and dipping sauces - yummy.  We started with the Cebiche tasting dish. I had never experienced Peruvian food before and the flavors were nothing close to anything I had ever had - amazing, loved it!  We couldn't stop at one appetizer's also had the Causa tasting - again - excellent - very unique flavors and combinations of fish and potato.  For dinner I went with the Cordero -braised lamb shank.  It was pretty good, fell right off the bone.  I would recommend the dish, however, I have had better lamb dishes (the appetizers for me were definitely the highlight).\n\nFor dessert we had the Tiramisu - Excellent!!\n\nAs for drinks....we started with the Pisco Sour - perfect!  Then had a nice bottle of Malbec, recommended by the waiter.  However, we were slightly disappointed they did not have one Peruvian wine on the list.  After dinner drinks were another typical Peruvian drink - Chicha Morada a kind of sangria/tea like cold drink.\n\nAppetizers - AWESOME\nDinner - OKAY\nDrinks - EXCELLENT\n\nBathroom, very nice, but not at all impressed by only COLD water coming out of the hot tap!  Come-on-people  $30 for an entree - give me a little hot water to wash my hands!!", "author": "A W."}

They do have most of the traditional Peruvian foods, but it's more upscale and California, but still really good.\n\nFood was a bit pricey and the portions where small.

In fact I've been to La Mar three times in the past two weeks.\n\nThe reason for my bad review is that every time I've gone in the service was just awful.  The only people who were friendly however were the bartenders and busboys.  But the hostess was absolutely rude.  We had 5 minutes until official opening time and she rudely looked at her watch while letting out a sigh of exasperation then pointing to the bar saying sit over there.  I was with a group of sharp looking people so it was a little embarrassing since they were visiting me from out of town.  In fact they were so upset they wanted to go elsewhere from just that.  We then decided to go to the bar and the hell with everything, enjoy some damn good cebiche and drinks.  After having done so we then decided to go inside for an official sit down and were told by the manager of the establishment that perhaps our next order of drinks should be a glass of water.  My guests weren't from around here and perhaps were a little loud and boisterous but never in my life had I been so insulted.  This is San Francisco where you're supposed to enjoy yourself not a library.  \n\nSo to the owner of the establishment.  Please teach your GM and hostess some manners and tact.  I'll be going back due to my masochistic nature of being treated poorly I suppose but only, and I repeat only because of your great food and happy hour.", "author": "Carlos S."}

I thought it was all very tasty and filling.  The only downside is the expensive prices.  I do think it's a bit pricey for a casual night out -- with a few glasses of wine, and one cocktail it came to $55 a head.\n\nThe food, service, and ambience is good - but does not warrant the high prices.

I remembered that I've wanted to go here for some time & seeing that I had a sales managers expense account at my disposal I suggested Mar.\n\nI've got to say I'll probably agree with most of the negative menu responses in that they just tend to overpower the seafood selections with too much spice, citrus & salt.  Their basic ceviche, once stripped of it's various coatings is actually very fresh & refreshing.  The waiter must have thought I was just one of those guys who doesn't eat his veggies because that was all that was left of my plate when I was done.\n\nNow comes the really good part.  The bar.  Perhaps the Holy Grail of fresh fruit inspired  alcoholic concoctions.  Had to start with a pisco sour, tasty.  Then felt like a nice, tall shaken top shelf, fresh citrus only margarita which was a goooood call.  I don't make em' much better (or stronger) myself.  We then split a bottle of a killer Verdejo to end the afternoon sitting out watching the Bay & everybody scurrying to & from work while we discussed \"account strategy\" for the next half hour.  So yeah for two it was kinda pricey (about $165 I think) but we had the typical bar tab = twice the food tab thing going so I suppose if your a lightweight you could get away cheap.   \n\nBut why?", "author": "Bill T."}

Not true, since the other side of their table was completely free for that. As it turned out, I sat next to my date (both of us) on the bench and it was great, but I just was surprised to get busted for such an offense.\nI'd recommend asking at reservation time to sit in the patio section overlooking the bay or at the counter near the kitchen, where the noise level was less and you could hear the good music.\nFood-wise, it was quite enjoyable and the table service was fine.

We checked it out on a Saturday night and found that it attracts a big enough following to fill up the ample, buzzing dining room.\n\nI could go into the details of the delicious cerviches on offer, but instead would recommend the \"cebiche tasting\" which includes samples of mahi mahi, calamari, ahi tuna and halibut with accompaniments spanning  habanerao peppe, peanuts, pickled carrots and daikon, wonton strips and so many delicious flavors in the \"leche\".  All delicious - one was not enough for our group, so we managed a couple during an evening of laid-back tapas-style dining and conversation.\n\nBesides the ceviches we found room for some other appetizers - from the selection of anticuchos (traditional Peruvian skewers) the octopus with mashed potato and chimichurri sauce were sensational.  We also took a selection of \"causas\" - traditional Peruvian whipped potato with toppings including ahi tuna, Dungeness crab and artichoke which added further variety without being too filling.\n\nThe service is ok if a bit lackadaisical - if your server forgets to bring the fried plantain and potato chips with the dips, like ours did, then give them a prod.  They're too good to miss!  The wine list does pretty much what it needs to, but one doesn't come to a restaurant like this for an exalted oenological experience.

Lest I digress, Valet Parking Dude said, \"Well we park the cars there so ...\"  *wink wink*  So you CAN play free parking roulette but if it's too much of a distraction, yes there is very excellent valet parking for a very reasonable $10 because THEY THINK OF EVERYTHING at La Mar.  Peruvian Japanese!  Exquisite freshness, dazzling presentations, skillful spicing, impeccable preparation.   I love the Ferry Building area;  It's like OUR Pike's Market and like Pike's Market, La Mar really adds and enhances the all-around excellence that you frequently encounter in this delightful area.  \n\nHence DESTINATION which means, it's worth the trip, it's special, it's like meeting a babe and finding out she's wicked smart and everything she does is magic.

Our waiter that went by the name of Diego felt the need to wait 55 minute to put in my drink order and brought one of the four items that we ordered to the table every 45 minutes! \n\nDiego seemed to have several personal friends sitting in his area, which he decided to have long conversation with. The rest of us normal \"non personal friends\" of Diego's were felt to fend for ourselves, even when it comes to the request of water!\n\nLet's start to chat about Ben, the \"manager on duty\" that seems to not like to manage anything! Ben looked over at my table several times throughout my 3 hour dinner, noticing the look of frustration on my face. Guess what Ben did about this.... NOTHING!! Nothing at all!!\n\nBen asked several of the waiters who had table \"44\"... which he got a lot of responses of \"not I\"... well guess what Ben, of course you are not going to get a response of \"me, me, table 44 is mine\" when your server is off Chit Chatting with everyone and their mother!\n\nThe fact that Ben had to go out of his way several times to ask who's covering our table, but never once came to the table himself was horrible management skills. \n\nI have called the restaurant and asked to speak to Andrew the main guy , and was told that he was on the floor and only responds to email. After reading the other reviews about this place and reading that Andrew doesn't ever get back to anyone I will start to hold my breath on this matter. \n\nI am just very upset that what was supposed to be a great night, turned into a night that left both of us frustrated and in a bad mood!", "author": "Susan B."}

I showed up at 9.30PM on a Tuesday.\nNo host. I asked a busboy passing by \"can I still get food?\"...he said \"yes, the host will be here anytime\". I was waiting and waiting, some potential patrons walked in while I was waiting, looked around and left, probably thinking that the restaurant was already closing.\n10 minutes later the host shows up, and she makes me sit AT THE BAR! are you kidding me? I was by myself (after a long work day) but I did not ask for the bar. If I wanted the bar I had just gone straight there and not wait for the host.\n\nAnyway, I sit and go quickly through the menu. I'll just a have \"cebiche clasico\" and a pisco sour. I ordered the pisco sour and the cebiche from someone that was not my waiter because my waiter only showed up practically at the same time my pisco sour and cebiche  were brought to me saying \"Hi, I'm John your waiter, here's your blah blah, let me konw if you have any questions\". And by the way, I was expecting to have my drink while I waited for my food, not at the same time.\n\nAnyway, in one word, AWFUL SERVICE. And I am of the ones that do not care for a smile or fake royalty treatment, I just want quick service, salt, pepper, and my glass of water full.\n\nThe pisco sour was delicious, made the way it is supposed to be.\n\nNow, a cebiche is usually a pretty fulfilling meal. I could just have a cebiche and be done with my meal. Well, guess what? I think the cebiche consisted of 3 or 4 pieces of fish. It was good, not extraordinarily good, just good. But such a small portion for $18???? That was the second joke of the night.\n\nI was hungry. So I decided to go for one of the causas, that at any other Peruvian restaurant, it is also a pretty fulfilling appetizer. This was the biggest joke of the night. The $12 Nikei causa consisted of three tiny pieces of causa, each one the size of half a thumb. It was delicious. The ahi tuna on top (like 1 once total or less) was also good. But, man, the portion size was just ridiculous. I felt insulted.\n\nOf course, I was still hungry after the causa. But I was really afraid of ordering the nearly $30 lomo saltado.\n\nI had one beer to end the night.\n\nMy tab was close to $70. And I was still hungry.\n\nFor those prices and portion size I would expect much much more. At least some good service (the service was terrible) and outstanding food! (the food was just good)\n\nThe next day I went to Limon in South Van Ness, the cebiche was DELICIOUS (so much better than La Mar's). We also got lomo saltado, anticuchos (cow heart) and a quarter chicken, yuquitas fritas and cancha plus 6 drinks. All for $75 for two people.\n\nGo to La Mar to pretend to be fancy and be ripped off.

I've gone there twice already, and could easily see myself returning for a third visit.

I even took my Peruvian friend there to verify authenticity :)\nGreat cocktails: amazing Pisco sours, actually pretty much every cocktail I drank there was amazing\nExcellent (and authentic) service: charming hosts and servers provide added depth to the menu\nBeautiful location/view: I didn't get seated near the window, but the location on the water makes this place that much more appealing\n\nHere's to going a third time!", "author": "Keyvan R."}

We made reservations on opentable to make sure we got a seat. and used our $20 opentable certificate! SCORE! :) That's one free appetizer for us! \n\nWe ordered the Pisco Sour to start. It's frothy, then icy then juice, in that order.. if you look at the glass you can see that layer. It's not sweet enough for me.. I like things SUPER sweet so I'm a bad judge for that.. but the BF liked it. \n\nOn to the meals. We didn't get a main course.. we stuck with the samplers.. \n\nWe had the following:\n\nCebiche Tasting: (Mixto, Chifa, Nikei and Cl\u00e1sico) CLASICO is the BEST!!! OMG!!! Will definitely order that by itself.. the other ones were good.. but nothing as awesome as the Clasico! \n\nCausa Tasting: (Lime\u00f1a, Criolla, Nikei, Casera) NIKEI rocks!! It's the perfect combo of texture, flavor, and spiciness for a kick. The other ones were decent.. but the crab one I liked the least... it actually reminded us of TUNA! from the can.. :( sorry\n\nAnticucho de Coraz\u00f3n (Grilled beef heart with potatoes, Peruvian corn and a spicy rocoto sauce) This one was interesting. Never had heart before but if I had to compare, it's texture is somewhat comparable to Chicken gizzards. The potato was basically a slice of potato that was fried.. like a potato wedge.. nothing spectacular. I think I'd want to try the Octopus one next time. \n\nEmpanada Sampler: We only tried the beef and seafood.. seafood one is good :) we were too full to finish the other two. But I think we would probably pass this next time and go for something in the main course section. \n\nsoOOoo overall a wonderful experience.. but next time the MUST GETS will be the: Causa Nikei and the Cl\u00e1sico Cebiche!!!", "author": "Kristina L."}

On the day of our reservation, and too late to get a table anywhere else, I heard from a co-worker that both she and a friend had gotten sick after eating there.  (Not mere stomach ache, but work-leavingly violently ill).  They had been there on separate occasions, but she said that they both got the tuna entree.  She said I would probably be okay if I stayed away from that dish.  \n\nStupidly, I went to dinner anyways.  We ordered the cebiche tasting, beef empanada, mahi mahi skewer, and lamb shank.  It was all delicious... until I woke up at two am throwing up and didn't stop until 8.   \n\nOf course, I realize that raw fish is always a bit of a gamble.  However, I eat sushi several times a month and have had cebiche (or ceviche) more times than I can count.  I've eaten street food in foreign countries with no problem.  Additionally, two other separate reports of food poisoning seems like more than a coincidence.

With a true Latin decor complimented by rhythmic beats, the upscale setting is inviting and upbeat. The staff is friendly, good looking and well educated on the cuisine and libations; necessary when venturing into the land of Octopus skewers and cocktails of the week like the \"Hechizo.\" The general manager and managing partner of the restaurant even made time to say hello and make sure we were enjoying our time.\n\nThe only thing that beats the friendly staff and true Latin setting is the fresh and delicious food. I highly recommend the cebiche sampler and the causa limena. All the rice dishes are delicious as well. Not only is the food great, but the presentation and abundance of different sauces provide the proverbial icing on the cake. \n\nDon't forget to try the Peruvian staple of the Pisco Sour, but also check out the reasonably priced wine menu, the rice beer or one of the many custom cocktails. Grab a cab because the bartenders aren't afraid to give you money's worth of booze.\n\nI've been to La Mar three times so far and have never been disappointed.

I may have found my new favorite spot in the city.\n\nWe were a group of about 14 and the buzz around the table was positive throughout our meal.  The restaurant is stunning, a very large space, with a modern, open, airy feel.  The bar to the side seemed to have great lighting and I could definitely picture stopping in to hang at the bar as well.\n\nI had a minor panic attack at first as they led us to the outside patio.  It's November and it's freaking COLD at night.  I am particularly sensitive to the cold.  I thought I'd have to keep my wool coat on all night and worried that I would be uncomfortable.  But NO, they have a great set up out on the patio with super powerful heat lamps that penetrate from above.  Towards the end of the night, I wished I had worn a sleeveless blouse instead of a sweater, I was that toasty.  Kinda fun to comfortably dine outdoors next to the water in November!\n\nThe food is fabulous.  My only beef is that reading the menu got a bit confusing... it was really difficult to tell which items were starter size and which were entree size.  Luckily our server was a great help.  Although he did make us believe the starters were teensy tinsy..... don't believe them, they are pretty decent size for starters.  I shared a halibut cebiche and a kampachi tiradito and had a scallop dish for my main entree.  The cebiche was good, but the tiradito was incredible.  My mouth is watering as I recall the buttery fish soaked in a succulent sauce (not sure exactly what it was).  I enjoyed the scallops just fine, but I got a taste of a pal's seared ahi dish and wished I'd ordered that dish.  I have never tasted an ahi dish that was so meaty, it felt almost like eating steak.  \n\nI don't know much about authentic peruvian cuisine, but it certainly felt authentic.  They start the meal off with a basket of fried plantains & potatoes (I think) with three tasty sauces to dip them in.  The sauces were all very unique, one was made with black beans, another had more of a tomato-creamy taste and the last tasted like an aioli of sorts.  I could have eaten a whole basket of those suckers (I think I may have actually!)\n\nThe service was very attentive.

My favorite was the cebiche nikei with ahi tuna with it's gorgeous tamarind sauce. I went to Peru for a few weeks so had high expectations for the cebiche, I was not disappointed. We followed by a nikei salad and sea bass nikei. The sea bass was beautiful cooked and served on a bed of scallions and beansprouts. The sauce was very yummy. Instead of the rice, we asked the bartender for an alternative, he suggested the quinoa. It came with beautiful beans (the name I cannot remember).

I did not care for the cebiche all that much. For me it was too raw. It seemed like they did not let it marinate long enough. It was more of a sushi type dish with a citrus taste to it. The causas were good. I guess I hyped it up to much from all the rave reviews. The dish looked amazing and it tasted pretty good. I wasn't wowed with the taste like I was with the presentation. The empanadas were probably the best tasting thing I ate there. But, I feel like i can get a good tasting empanadas some other place that is cheaper. \nThe service was kind of slow but we were in no hurry to go anywhere so it did not bother us.

It's a great place to get a variety of dishes to share and the staff is always willing to recommend things.  There's a chip appetizer that comes with a good variety of dipping sauces and isn't too filling for a group of people.\nThey have great service that isn't overbearing.

They have a great amount of space so it's not difficult to get a good reservation or even drop in.  When it's nice outside, lunch out back by the boats is paradise.

I did not really venture out on the drinks and stuck with vodka and tonic. \n\nThe bar and the restaurant are very nice. The space is large and has a Miami vibe to it. We were seated close the window and seated right on top of the water. We ordered the ceviche tasting and all four had their own unique flavors. From citrus to sweet, tangy and spicy. All four were very good. Limon needs to step up, it has more to compete with. We also ordered a special of the night - Lomo saltado spring rolls. Sounds weird, but they were exceptional. Very tasty, although the sauce to dip they served with it should have been the spicier one that was served with the chips they serve to all tables. The sauce was a little too mild - lacking a strong flavor. Despite this, the rolls had great flavor and did not necessarily need any sauce for dipping. \n\nThe octopus skewers, ehhh, not too much flavor for me. I like octopus but these were a little off the mark - I was hoping for a sweet flavor. \n\nThe dessert - wow, deep fried pastries balls filled with melted chocolate and scoop of ice cream.

With that background, I can state that, in my personal opinion, La Mar is definitely a solid, upscale Peruvian restaurant.  But five stars?  As much as I enjoyed my recent visit, I can't go quite that far.\n\nI went to La Mar recently for lunch, and I took my Peruvian parents who were visiting from SoCal along with me.  We've been to all of the Peruvian restaurants in San Francisco, since I treat them to Peruvian food whenever they visit.  This was our first time visiting La Mar, however.  My parents have been to the original La Mar restaurant in Lima, which they regard highly, so our combined expectations were high - particularly, once we saw the prices.\n\nWe all loved the atmosphere and decor.  It's young and trendy, but not obnoxious.  The bartender was also terrific.  Our pisco sours were outstanding.  We would have ordered a second round, but none of us wanted to sleep away the entire afternoon. The service was also professional and friendly.  My parents were happy that they could order in spanish for a change at an upscale San Francisco restaurant.\n\nThe food was fresh and flavorful, but we all agreed that it didn't \"wow\" us, like we expected from the five star reviews that this restaurant has received.  Mom had the lomo saltado, which is her favorite dish.  She orders it everywhere she can find it, but this version of traditional Peruvian comfort food was so refined that it lost some of its authenticity in the presentation and flavor.   Dad had the anticuchos, which were well-seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked.  He ate everyting on the plate.  The picarones (peruvian donuts) were also outstanding.   The fresh, outstanding seafood is the real star here, however.  (Not a surprise, given the name of the restaurant.)   Perhaps the seafood dishes are so superb that the other choices on the menu just seemed a slight bit lackluster in comparison?  Seafood certainly lends itself to refinement, but Peruvian comfort food, less so.         \n\nIn sum, we enjoyed our visit, and will probably go back again.  But we couldn't help feeling that the prices were quite steep, particularly given that we've had other terrific Peruvian meals in San Francisco (e.g., Fresca, Mi Lindo Peru, Limon), for far less.

The cebiche was very good, with a piquant tiger's milk, sweet potatoes and the big peruvian choclo I love so much. Though it was not the most nuanced cebiche EVER, this was pretty damn good, and the quality of the fish was tops.\nThe standouts were the causas. You get three in a sampler, and they were so good, we got another order! They are little cylinders of vibrantly colored mashed potatoes with various toppings (tuna, asparagus and crab). Sounds not-so-exciting, until the party starts in yo mouth! For reals, they really are delicious.\nThe pisco drinks are gorgeous, btw. Chicha tu sour and pisco punch are socks-rockin.

Dined here 3x prior, and was subsequently converted into a spectacular hyperbolic promoter of this restaurant. The food here felt like a better version of the Peruvian originals where gaston's team would experiment just a bit with new flavors without flying the coop and leaving traditional recipes behind. This place was perfect and I tried to design business trips to allow for this meal. Suffice to say, this restaurant was incredibly important and special to me.  So why the past tense?\n\nWhat happened:\nI ordered empanada sampler - delicious, although I couldn't enjoy their deliciousness 100% because these puppies were fried and hey, I should be making smarter choices.  Then leches de tigre - phenomenal. And finally anticucho de pulpo - three deliciously charred octopus skewers. I was already devoted to these things from prior visits. And I was in a great mood because I had just purchased two pounds of fresh morels too. Life was really good. 1st skewer delicious.  2nd skewer even better. 3rd skewer, woops! It launches right off of the bamboo skewer like a coiled spring, ricocheting off my suit leaving a trail of red sauce in its wake and landing on the floor. I was stunned as if I had just been sucker-punched.  Was the skewer faulty or, egads, was it the user? Despite the fact that I was expensing this meal, I also contemplated what a financial ruin this was as 1/3 of the dish equated to $5.33, setting aside the food waste especially given how many homeless I encountered on my walk to this restaurant. The waiter then appeared and displayed an expression of unmitigated empathy as if to say, hey man I've been there.  This left me no doubt we were on the same page.  The waiter then picked up the defunct octopus from the ground and left my table. Several minutes elapsed. As time continued to pass and I saw my waiter tend to other tables and make visits to the bar and then the kitchen, my visions that my octopus portion would be restored to its original went from fait accompli to fait 'no way'.  \n\nWhat I need from you:\nI recognize that I am abjectly imperfect and my expectations may have been unreasonable. However, I would greatly appreciate a second opinion.  In full disclosure, one detail, albeit likely irrelevant, omitted from the above narrative was that two pisco sours were consumed in between my courses which potentially may have compromised my manual dexterity.", "author": "curtis k."}

On their menu, we kept seeing the words \"leche de tigre\" and the waiter explained that it was some fish juice with lime, garlic, spices - it sounded so intriguing we ordered an entire flight of leche de tigre shots.

They try to trick you on that, those darn Peruvians!!! Someone else wrote that the ceviche was just lime and onion. Well quite frankly the MAIN ingredients of ceviche are the fish and a LOT of lime, there is usually some more spices that make it nice and hot, but the flavor of their ceviche is really AWESOME! \n\nOk I can gush more and more but I would say....try it yourself and you will be pleased! \n\nAnd don't skip out on the dessert.

Sorta expensive for the portions, but comparable for the area and not exorbitant.\n\nI did not drink. However, I did try an Inca Kola. It's the Coke of Peru! You will only like it if you are a kid because it tastes like bubble gum. However, they have an exhaustive wine list and an impressive drink menu.

I really just ate the chips though; I kinda hate condiments.\n\nI had the iradito nikei which is translated as \"Ahi tuna that is better than the best %$#@ maguro sashimi that you have ever had....EVER.

(Or maybe too much that has made you crazy enough NOT to....).\n\nWhen the dessert menu showed up, hot guy behind counter suggested that I get the bignets with the oozing chocolate in them served with a carameley sauce and banana passion fruit ice cream (as in two flavors combined in the same ice cream...not two different ice creams) because it was his favorite. I was torn between that and the sweet potato fritters...but I figured hot guy may have good taste. I totally know why freakos love those deep-fried Snickers at the fair! Have you ever had hot, soft, fried dough encapsulating a hot, gooey, chocolately surprise of a center?!?!?!? No???? It's amazing! The coolness of the ice cream totally compliments the hot surprise of the chocolate. I recommend breaking the bignets in half, putting a scoop of ice cream inside, and then taking a bit. ZOMG. Amazing. Also, because hot guy felt like he had too much influence on my choice, he showed up to my seat with a sample of the sweet potato fritter. That too was amazing. \n\nI will be back.

Arrived just after 8 pm on a Sunday it took over ten minutes before anyone knew we were alive. The anticucho we ordered was cold (obviously it sat) and the place wasn't busy at all (can you imagine how bad service would get when they are busy?) The ceviche while tasty had a creamy texture about it (this is the first for me) the \"lomo saltado\" was prepared with the wrong onions (they used white & green onions, should be red onions), the meat was tender but had no flavor and the sauce had to much soy sauce (can't understand why soy sauce), the white beans were a bit undercooked, again the short rib was tender but again no taste and then came the dessert, we ordered the \"picarones\" only 3 small thin rings that obviously were probably cooked in very hot oil and came undercooked inside and overcooked outside, it was a sad site to look at, the plate was half empty. Beware of the drinks, they fill the small glasses with ice and there are no refills, not even for their \"Chicha morada\" which is a VERY inexpensive to make and it is made in large quantities. \nSeemed that their staff is not in sync, we had a busboy, and three other people delivering our food at different times, asking if we ordered something else, our waiter could have been present during the delivery of the food. On top of it we were sat outside in their patio, (even though there were plenty of empty tables inside) and before we were done the space heaters were turned off leaving us cold and making us feel unwelcome. \nOverall not a good choice, money not well spent.

The ceviche was extremely fresh, there was a lot of variety of different fishes, scallops, octopus. Really was the best ceviche I've ever had anywhere. It just melts in your mouth. The causas were also really good, bite sized rolls in different flavors and colors. The empanadas were really flavorful, are a good change in texture, fried and warm versus the melt in your mouth, cool refreshing ceviche. The next thing I had were the skewered pulpo - grilled octopus. the octopus was sweet and fresh and cooked just enough that it was not chewy. very well flavored.\nI would love to come back for happy hour and just have the ceviche and chips.

I would say that the only thing missing from this picture is a budding young sociopath, but the menu here is as manically superficial as Patrick Bateman and the service is one grade north of the American Psycho's gruesomest fantasies.\n\nTourists and local idiots can experience an abundance of Peruvian flavor here, as long as they are willing to pay a hefty fee for an array of minuscule amuse-bouche that will leave you anything but amused, let alone satisfied.  All this packaged in a frigid d\u00e9cor done up in the same cold, institutional style as the mental ward at SF General.\n\nThis is precisely where our waitstaff must have stumbled out of.  To begin, our courses were presented completely differently than how were they described on the menu.  By magic, Huanca\u00edna sauce with basil cilantro oil became \"a kind of mayonnaise with aioli.\"  Our table would have loved to pair this with a dry Riesling, only our water and wine glasses remained unattended by the staff the entire evening.  No worries, we sipped on the rain water that was splashing onto our table and drank from the torrent that was flowing over our lady friends' toe-less shoes underneath.\n\nHalf an hour separated our third and fourth courses, in the meantime we collectively shifted our fifteen person table three feet with not even a suggestion of help from the utterly and inexcusably inattentive staff.  The manager who appeared (once one of us decided that even in this moment of celebration it was appropriate to complain) looked like a hobo who had just been hit in the face with a frying pan.  He was just as helpful.  When asked to describe the concept of La Mar he replied \"It's Peruvian,\" and when we wondered aloud why half an hour had elapsed in between courses he answered \"it's real busy in there.\"\n\nAn hour later and after a promise of a free round of cocktails that was never satisfied he re-emerged with a half-witted smirk and tried to present us with his business card so that we would come back.  I've met Asberger's sufferers who can better attend to social cues; the sound my jaw made when it smacked the table in response to this restaurant's total ineptitude in the areas of food service and management was quickly echoed by my fourteen companions' shrieks at the bill.\n\nAfter being rained on, presented with measly portions that wouldn't have fed Kate Moss, waiting thirty minutes between said \"courses,\" having empty glasses on the table at all times, and never being asked if we wanted coffee or digestifs, we were expected to cough up more than $1700.  Apparently, the management didn't see fit to offer so much as a single free dessert.\n\nThe bottom line is in this economy service like this will sink a restaurant, regardless of its chef's star power.  By the end of a three-hour dinner, we left hungry, broke, and resolved to never return.", "author": "Kevin B."}

I had never heard of that fusion before so it was an interesting exxperience for me.  We had a really late reservation.. and still had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.  I did enjoy the ambience-- very modern and chic feeling.  I also liked that they gave us a round table in the corner of the restaurant so we could all see each other.   I wasn't lucky enough to try the ceviche, however, from what I heard they were pretty delicious.  We did family style for the food as suggested by the waiter.  We were all hungry and the complimentary sweetpotato,plantain and potato chips were an excellent substitute to bread.. I wish there were more plantains though.. there were plenty of potato chips and the dipping sauces were very creamy and flavorful.  We tried the fritters as well.  I liked the lomo saltado ones but the chicken ones were too dry.  It was also quite pricy for 2 spring rolls and 2 little fried fritters.. ($16?).. For the entrees (in the $20+ range) we tried the lomo saltado, arroz jugoso (paella/rissoto) and tallarin saltado (chow mein noodles with seafood).  The entrees were all OK.  The lomo saltado flavor was good.. but really just reminded me of chinese stirfry.  THe filet in the lomo saltado saved it.. but the rice with corn was not tasty.  I liked the paella more-- it was creamy and more latin flavors.  Had a good amount of seafood in it as well.. but again portion was tiny.   The tallarin saltado was the most interesting dish of th enight.. chow mein with fried calamari, fish and mussels.. it was all tossed with a soy sauce.  I think a little spice may have kicked it up a notch.. This dish was tasty but a little on the greasy side.. but what chinese food isn't greasy?  Didn't get to try drinks or desserts.. next time !

She was a bit over the top with her cheeriness and slightly condescending (was dining with my boyfriend and we were both in jeans - but so were most of the other patrons since, despite being expensive, this place is not fancy) but she was prompt with our waters and drink orders, and explained the menu to us.\n\nThe turning point was when she came to check on us as we were eating our entree.  We assured her that everything was great and she responded with \"It's yummy isn't it? Mmmmm!\"  in much the same tone one would use with a picky two year old.  As she walked away I asked bf in disbelief, \"did that just happen?\" and we both laughed.\n\nPerhaps she heard us?  Service completely ended from that point on.  A busboy gave us dessert menus when he took our plates away and after making eye contact with our initial server and others several times to no avail, we eventually flagged down a busboy to ask him to tell Debi we wanted to order dessert.  During this time she had gone to every single table around us and it seemed to be a deliberate slight.  After speaking to the busboy, she eventually came over to where we were sitting at the ceviche bar and STILL did not acknowledge us.  Instead, she asked the couple beside us, who had already received their check and were taking care of it, if she could get them anything else.  Then she finally turned to us and served us in the same over-cheerful, condescending manner, ignoring our obvious irritation.  We practically had to beg for the check and had the credit card ready so she couldn't leave us sitting there for another 20 minutes.  She referred to us as \"kids\" - a bit of a stretch and certainly rude.\n\nWe complained to the hostess on the way out but after reading other Yelp reviews for this place it doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. We will not go back to La Mar.", "author": "Jane F."}

(of course they're not entirely fooling me--i noticed the cocktail glasses got smaller, so you are actually getting a bit less than the $9 drink, but for $5 it's still substantial enuf and a much better deal.) plus they have a red and a white for $5 and beers for $3 i think. \n\nthe pisco sours are super-fino here. if you don't already know--pisco is peru's national liquor and it's basically unaged bourbon. this drink is light and refreshing, but be careful not to drink too many cause it's a lil sweet and probably would give you a nasty hangover. \n\nwe shared a couple empanadas, the chicken and the corn--both were delicious--tho still a lil pricey at $4 each, i think in buenos aires they're like $2 each and three times as big, but hey, this is SF. and we also had a ceviche with very asian influences that was awesome. i want to try a few other things on this menu and i think HH is the way to go. \n\nfyi--i love the decor here. a palette of crisp clean white, brown wood and vibrant teal feels sleek, fresh and sexy. but the dining room is a lil too mega restaurant for me. i like to sit in the bar towards the front.", "author": "rachel p."}

First, while two of us waited for the 2 parking, they took away one place setting, even though they confirmed there were 4 on our reservation. Then, they failed to bring a fourth menu. When we couldn't get anyone's attention, our guest got up and found a waiter that gave him one, but it turned out to be an old menu. Eventually the waiter realized it was old, and replaced it.  Then they brought us appetizers and one was not what we ordered.  They eventually brought the correct one.\n\nWorst of all, they failed to bring one entr\u00e9e and told us they thought our male guest was sharing it with my husband!!  I still haven't figured out why they thought he would share with someone other than his wife, if he intended to share with anyone!!  So my husband and I, and his wife almost finished our dinners before his entr\u00e9e came. The waiter said it was the kitchen's mistake, but we heard another waiter tell him he only ordered 3 entrees.\n\nNothing was provided complimentary to make up for all of this and no manager came to our table to address the many mistakes.  So, embarrassed and frustrated, my husband sought out the manager on duty.  She never came to the table to apologize to our guest.  She did follow up with an email to me, but after I explained all this to her again, she didn't bother to respond!  I wish someone - anyone - had made an effort to make it right.  It was a big disappointment. There are hundreds of very good restaurants in SF, so we won't go back to La Mar.", "author": "Von H."}

Good food (highlights: free plaintain chips w/dip and the chocolate donut ball dessert), but kind of pricey.  Service is spotty but not horrendous.\n\nThere are several seating areas:\n-Bar at the front.  Loud, crowded at happy hour.  Convivial. \n-Hallway-ish lounge area between the bar and dining room.  A bit more mellow.  Has coffee table-type seating.  \n-Bar counter in the dining room.  Good option if you don't have rezzies for dining room, but you may be staring at octopus or fish heads as you eat.\n-Dining room.  Airy, spacious!  Based on some reviews, I thought it would be much noisier than it was.  Didn't feel like I needed to shout or speak louder than normal.\n-Outdoor patio. Not sure how the seating here works.  It looked like only half the patio was open for seating.\n\nFood: \n-Everyone here is right to rave about the free plaintain chips they serve.  And the three dipping sauces, yum!  I could eat those all day.\n-We spit 4 appetizers and 2 desserts:\n1. Cebiche classico-- delicious.  The other ones seemed a bit funky.  We wanted the straight up good stuff.  Plus, we tasted this at the SF Street Food festival.  The sauce that the fish is marinated in is perfectly sour/spicy.  The fish could have used a bit more time sitting in the marinade.\n2. Grilled Octopus skewers-- Tender, delicious.  Like some sort of a rub on it, so good. So flavorful.  Got this b/c of the yelp reviews and it did not dissappoint.  Dining companion likened this to something that would come out of Bobby Flay's kitchen.  Three skewers to an order.\n3. Causa - crab.  This was just ok. Basically it's like a golf ball of crab mix (a bit creamy for my taste) on top of a cylyndrical mashed potatos.  The dish is very mushy--could have used some textural variation.  Also, with all the potato, it's on the heavier side.  Three to an order.  This was probably the least favorite thing I ate.\n4. Chicken Empanadas.  Delicious.  Seemed lightly fried, not too heavy on the carb wrapper like some places.  Two empahanadas to an order.\n5. Chocolate donuts balls.  If you love chocolate, you must get this!  Four little dough balls filled with warm gooey chocolate.  Like a chocolate explosion in your mouth.  \n6. Lucuma Tiramisu w/lucuma ice cream - Not too sweet.  An interesting take on tiramisu.  balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate donuts.  Seemed lighter, but I am sure it was not.\n\nOverall, food was delicious.  I want to try other things on the menu.\n\nService: spotty, as reviewers have noted.  We had to ask the server to bring out the plaintains/dips, and it arrived after the cebiche.  We also had to ask a couple times for water.\n\nIf you get a chance, go outside and walk around the place-- you can walk right by the kitchen which has an open window and watch the chefs at work.", "author": "Caroline I."}

The total was $75 for just lunch and we had no alcohol or dessert. \nIf the food was excellent I wouldn't complain about spending the money but it was just OK. I had to ask for hot sauce to put on everything which made it taste 100% better. The best part of the meal was the FREE basket of chips (yucca, plaintain, potato). \nI don't think I'll go back for lunch or dinner but I'll probably go back for drinks on a beautiful sunny day.

Sitting outside on a nice day is great fun.  I don't know how they do it, but there are no issues with sea gulls as is the case at the ferry building just a couple blocks away.  The cebiche is excellent - always refreshing.  Another \"I don't know how they do it\"... the calamari in the cebiche is always extremely tender.  They used to include a slice of habanero on the cebiche, but no longer.  I enjoy that heat with the acid of the cebiche and they are happy to bring some habanero on request. Yum!  Only 4 stars vs 5 as the service is sometimes uneven.  Don't try to press lunch into an hour - although there have been times when the service was excellent.  The best service I have had at lunch was by a new server.  There was also excellent service one day when Gaston Acurio was there.  Some of the menu changes over the past year or so are odd.  They used to do two sizes of cebiche and the larger size was excellent for a full lunch.  Now its only one size offered and its more of an app size.  The chip basket is now served with only two sauces - the third, spiciest, is gone.  (is this a theme...is it whimpy SF gringos and 'tourists in tennis shoes' complaining about the spice of the habanero and the now missing sauce?...could be, but its unfortunate.)    Also, the arrzo noteno is no longer on the lunch menu.  :( it was my favorite.  I hope La Mar reads this and considers bringing it back.  \nBottom line,  amazing, fresh seafood.  You won't be disappointed in the food and don't be in a hurry - enjoy the beautiful surroundings inside or out.  And, I don't find lunch to be expensive. Considering the quality of the ingredients in all La Mar's dishes, I think its an amazing value.", "author": "R Y."}

We showed up, said we were here to dine in the cafe, and were informed that, well, \"the cafe guy is in Seattle,\" or something like that, and that the cafe, per se, was no longer open.  The hostess, who seemed confused at best, then waved us into the front bar and suggested we order off the \"cafe\" menu.  We sat at a table in the bar and it went downhill quickly.  The hostess curtly delivered the menus and told us we'd have to order at the bar.   Ok, odd, but fine, we said.  Then, incredibly, she made a point of removing--rudely--each PAPER place mat on the table--from beneath our elbows--and every napkin and piece of silverware and plate.  I laughed and asked, \"Will we be able to eat off of plates?\"  She said something on the order of, \"This is how we keep our costs down.\"  Really, I'm not making this up.  Little did I know how serious she was...\n\nI ordered a sandwich and a salad and two chicha moradas and some chips.  We waited, expecting at least our drinks to arrive.  Eventually, the bartender showed up at the table with our drinks in to-go cups and a bag containing our boxed food.  We were surprised, expecting the food to be served on plates.  I proceeded to take the food from the bag, but the bartender approached again, discontented, and said the tables were only for food ordered off \"the menu,\" meaning, I suppose, the full restaurant menu.  I could not believe this was happening.  Need I point out that there were only 2 other customers in the bar so it wasn't like they needed the table.  \n\nFed up, we left and ate at tables nearer the Ferry Building.\n\nIt seems, in retrospect, that while the hostess led us to believe we were ordering from the \"cafe\" menu, apparently we were ordering from the to-go menu.  For some reason, it appears to be restaurant policy that staff is to spare no effort to prevent customers from eating to-go orders on-site, in a practically empty restaurant, even when they were led to believe they were ordering from the \"cafe\" menu (and even if it means abusing them).\n\nIn the spirit of full disclosure:  (1) The food was good, once we pried it out of the plastic to go containers (I've always liked the food there)(and it was good despite the bitter taste the experience left in our mouths); (2) the restaurant apologized, after the fact, by email, but never explained how a restaurant of its caliber could treat paying customers so poorly.", "author": "Keith J."}

I never really think of places on the Embarcadero for events and usually don't head down that way when I'm looking for a more dressy spot, but after being steered here, we were definitely steered in the right direction.\n\nWe booked La Mar about 2 months in advance for a May afternoon.  We knew with the weather it might be tricky but we decided to go for the patio area.   Which was perfect since it became sunny at mid-60's! The area was set up with beautiful colors and multiple tables.  It was perfect for what we were looking for.  Overlooking the bay, very relaxed.  \n\nWe had two great servers who walked around with trays of red and white wine that we had chosen for our guests.  It was the perfect touch for our event and really classed it up for a nice afternoon party.\n\nThe food was amazing and everyone seemed to love it.  The event planner there was helpful in setting up the menu so that it was something for everyone and featured dishes that would suite all tastes and eating styles (vegetarians, vegans, meat eaters...).\n\nI only have two real complaints about La Mar.  The first is when we got there we were told the room would be ready for us to set up at 11am and they weren't set up for us until nearly 11:45am.  It was aggrivating since we had favors, a slide show, cake, gifts, etc...and we needed to do it before the bride arrived.  When I spoke with the event manager she was really rather blaise about it and it didn't seem like she really cared.  The second complaint is that the white wine we contracted for was not available and the white they substituted ended up costing us more money.  We were frustrated that they didn't tell us this ahead of time and charged us for the bottles.  When we asked about the price the event manager reminded us that we were getting other items \"on the house\" (also in the contract).  Essentially, I felt like they were trying to make up for the money they were losing on the complimentary items they had given us for free.  \n\nOverall, The things I liked FAR outweighed the annoyances.  I would just caution anyone who is planning an event there to really watch the event planning and double check the contract to ensure you get what you agreed too!!", "author": "Jennifer C."}

La Mar fit the bill. A high energy sprawling environment on the waterfront in Pier 1 1/2, with high ceilings and giant windows (excellent views during the day...) we were immediately invigorated upon entry with smells, sounds and visuals of a happening popular restaurant. For drinks we started with a FINE glass of Malbec and a FAIR pisco sour. (Destino on Market does better. Less eggy froth and tart-er citrus.) We decided on a meal of small plates though their entrees looked good too. We thought \"Why waste time on a single set of flavors when we can travel a long list of multiple flavors?\" After noshing on the ADDICTIVE free basket of fried plantain, potato and yam chips with a trio of dipping sauces (DELISH), all three!) and consulting with our pleasant waitperson (delivering decent, competent service throughout,) we began with a traditional cebiche the Cebiche Nikle, an ahi tuna based dish that was more like Hawaiian poke but it was the only one not containing habenero in the marinade. EXCELLENT. The others cebiches looked good too, so will have to wait when I come back with someone who likes hot...) Then a list of mind blowing empanadas. Where to start? Got the phenomenal empanadas sampler of veggie, chicken, steak and seafood. Delivered hot from the fryer, each mixture was encased in a perfectly crispy fried pocket. SAVORY PERFECTION. Next up, street food style skewers. We got the beef. Three large chunks tender (skirt?) beef, perfectly flavored by the grill and marinade, a touch salty sweet. CARNIVORE DELIGHT! The only disappointment: STEER CLEAR of their house salad which have a tamarind based dressing that was so sweet it was like eating a candy salad. Uuugh. We skipped dessert after the run in with the aforementioned sweet salad. Thought the other tables ordered some fried dough option with dipping sauces I believe. Too much. We headed home. Satiated and successfully transitioning from our hell week to an indulgent and promising weekend. We'll be back to La Mar. \n\n(Kevin, you asked for it, so here it is...a positive review.)", "author": "Alexander G."}

Promises of pisco sours, the company of two very adored girlfriends, and of course, much coveted reservations at a restaurant which I've been dying to try. So I bundled up, put on my boots, and grabbed an umbrella. \n\nThe spacious waterfront building has been done up in lively bold colors. White beams and accents are a sharp contrast and make you feel as if you're in a beachfront restaurant rather than the foggy city. Even on a Monday night, the dining room was full and there were still quite a few groups at the bar area in front. Amongst all this, within five minutes of walking in, I felt much warmer and almost forgot about the rain and gloom outside.\n\nOur server was friendly and quite helpful. She was able to make some recommendations as to which dishes were must-try's and which ones we could have passed on. We decided on two main dishes, the lomo saltado, and a chicken stew, one ceviche, and the causas sampler. The loma saltado was well flavored, similar to a stir fry of beef strips, french fries, green onions, and more. Nancy rightly assesed that I would prefer the chicken stew over the chicken w/cilantro rice, noting my affinity for creamy sauces and such dishes as butter chicken, alfredo sauce, and so on. She was right. The stew was prepared with white meat only, laddled on top of tender slices of potatoes, topped with a few olives and a quail egg. For dessert, the beignets were just too irresistable to pass up. Fried balls filled with a warm gooey chocolate center, glazed with orange sauce, and served with a scoop of passionfruit-banana ice cream. It was good, but would have been better had they served it with another scoop of ice cream.\n\nThe food is on the heavier side, and like the restaurant, a little bit showy, but thats pretty much expected for a prime waterfront property. For the most part, I enjoyed my dinner and will probably return once I work off the five extra pounds gained.", "author": "helen l."}

I Highly recommend for a fun night out! :)", "author": "elle c."}

I came in jet lagged and battered and sat at the bar to be entertained with company and pisco by Jared, hands down one of the quickest, wittiest, most talented bar tenders I've encountered, maybe ever? 5 drinks deep i was contemplating why i had taken a vacation in the first place- the best drinks and service was right under my nose this whole time! \nafter the pisco sours were flowing through my veins  i started craving tobacco when JARED informed me that out back lies a patio where i can smoke what i want?! ??! i stumble out back to find a water front terrace- i felt like swimming but refrained, sf is chilly a sobering reminder I'm not in turkey anymore :(\nAs I left that evening i couldn't help but wonder whether the pisco sours and my arroz norte\u00f1o (a dish filled with mussels, shrimp, octopus, and fried rice which puts world class spanish paellas to shame!) were what I was high on or the idea of my new friendship/ bromance with Jared? With the most adorable little martini tattooed on his forearm i started becoming worried that there was more in the pisco sours than i was prepared to handle, emotionally and physically- talk about an aphrodisiac.. \nI recommend checking this place out on Sundays for the mere fact that Jared is guaranteed to be there, a little eye candle with your ceviche never hurt anyone", "author": "michael L."}

The meat was high quality and then broth/sauce was spot on. The causa was dope (we ordered two different kinds). My only complaint was that they don't have papas a la huancaina, which is a staple of most places. Other than that tiny infraction, this place was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-22", "description": "I dined here yesterday with my mom, older brother, and younger sister as an early celebration of my birthday, which happens to be today. I had read the Yelp reviews and was very excited to eat here- neither I nor my family has had the pleasure of enjoying much Peruvian food, so it was nice to try something new.\n\nWe started out with a round of Pisco sours (naturally), the cebicha chifa, the anticuchos de pollo (grilled chicken skewers), and the empanadas de aji de gallina, which were filled with creamy chicken in a delicately spiced aji sauce.\n\nThis first course was all very satisfying- from the complimentary fried plantain and homemade potato chips, served with three different aiolis (going from mild to medium in spiciness, but not quite reaching hot), to the last bite of the wonderfully-seasoned and fresh cebicha (indeed, the chifa did remind me of a Chinese chicken salad minus the chicken, as one reviewer noted). The grilled chicken skewers (anticuchos de pollo) had a nice kick, having been marinated in aji panca (Peruvian red pepper, and were served with a nicely spiced rocoto salsa and the largest variety of corn I have ever witnessed. Seriously, these Peruvian corn kernels are huge, and kind of starchy- and like all good starches, were very addicting. As for the empanadas, our order came with two, so we split them four-ways and enjoyed the extra-fried crispiness of the outer shells and the perfectly savory creaminess of the filling. Very nice.\n\nWe then moved on to our salad course, in which the four of us split the two different dinner salads offered that evening per our kind* waiter's recommendation (both vegetarian- the Ensalada Nikei with green papaya, j\u00edcama, soybeans, pickled carrots and daikon, crunchy quinoa, Peruvian purple corn and rocoto dressing was my favorite, but the other one on spinach with fresh white corn and a light vinaigrette was very crisp and refreshing as well). I appreciated the fact that our waiter helped us not order too much salad, and suggested we split the two different varieties. The salad portions are huge, so it was perfect.\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the chupa andino (creamy chicken soup with a delicious soft quail egg and potatoes), my mom ordered the lomo saltado (beef tenderloin strips in rich dark sauce served with fries, onions, and corn rice), my brother ordered the arroz norteno (a mixture of seafood on top of seasoned rice), and my sister ordered an entree of some sort of fish fillet served in a rich broth with vegetables and corn rice (the name escapes me now!). Everything looked and smelled amazing, and we all devoured as much of our plates as we could. Contrary to other reviews, I must say, I found the portion sizes to be generous and sizable. Nothing excessive, a la Cheesecake Factory, but nothing tiny, as well.\n\nWe were full and content and would have ordered dessert, except that the restaurant got a little busier by the time we finished our meal, and our waiter was distracted by another table that had just filled up. Despite this, he was still very pleasant and quick to serve us through the whole meal; we did not lack for anything, and felt better leaving without dessert anyhow (I know, I know it was my birthday celebration, but I'm more into savory than sweet, anyhow!)\n\nI loved coming here; beautiful view of the water on a lovely day (Sunday, June 21, 2009 = beautiful, awesome sunny weather), good cocktails, yummy food, friendly service, and laid-back environment. What was not to love?\n\n*handsome, too :)", "author": "Anna S."}

So when I finally went to was Wednesday night the second till last full day I was in San Francisco, and I needed to go out to eat anyways am I remember what my Spanish professor had told me about, my final exams were done, I had a couple papers left but again I needed somewhere to eat, the bus trip took a long time but I finally made out there, and I finally found the place and I kind of knew what was going on that it would be somewhat expensive when I stepped foot into the place, but by that time it was getting late and I had taken a long time to get there so I just decided all well whatever I'll stay fortunately, I still had some money in the bank and enough to eat there the food seem pretty good if it was the food alone this place would probably get a four stars from me, but despite the good food price was a little steep for it, I really enjoyed that interesting taste and I never received bad service mentioned by some other reviews, and so I cannot complain about that, the food seemed fresh enough and well-made and well, I guess it is pretty hard to mess up deep fried fish, I had the calamari the ceviche I had seemed tiny but really good at the same time, the vegetable or fruit juice I had seemed quite decent and the rice paper ice cream I had also seemed really good would I come back here? Maybe?

We were seated by a snarly hostess to a table under the glare of the skylight.  When we requested to sit outside, she said everything was reserved (it was half empty at 1pm).  We had to wait to place our order, and after we did, the waiter returned 15 minutes later to say they were out of the kind of fish we ordered.  It took 45 minutes to get our order, and the waiter forgot to bring the salad, which we eventually told him to forget it.  Our water glasses were never refilled, and the waiter only returned when I requested the check.  The restaurant was not crowded. As far as the food, the first time I thought things were great; now extremely medicore, compounded by the rotten service.", "author": "WK C."}

Was considering just one star, but my pisco sour was very good, and I suspect the bar experience might be fun on its own. \nBut if you're looking for a happy customer, this isn't me. You may be surprised - the restaurant is beautiful, the location by the water is stunning, and we did sit on the patio after all. And if the aforementioned pisco sour was indeed awesome, why am I complaining? \nBecause of dinner, that's why. Our reservation was for 8, yet for some inexplicable reason, our party of 10 was made to wait until 8:45, as our hostess said, \"over there by the tree.\" The tree she was referring to was a large potted something or other by the door. I felt like an errant child sent to bed without chocolate milk. \nThe manager finally seated us, but without an apology for the wait. I decided to give the place a second chance, but had to quickly revise that opinion while biting into a completely tasteless causa. The ceviche looked pretty good, but the empanadas were not a hit. The best things on the table were really the free chips and dips. \nAnd I had to get plenty familiar with the chips, cos my main course never arrived. Nope, never. Not with the rest of the table, not 10 minutes later, not when everyone was done. Our server offered many variations on his apology, but that still didn't put food on the table. Finally, we decided to move on to dessert and ordered three to share. The tiramisu and beignets were fine. But when the bill arrived, I was shocked to see that the only reimbursement we had been offered for my not getting an entree was one free dessert. I think these guys may need a lesson (or two) in good sense.", "author": "Purnima M."}

The bar was buzzing with beautiful people and the decor was very cool. We started off with one of the Pisco cocktails and I WISH I could remember which one because it was delicious! It was like a margarita but even more refreshing (plus, the waiter verified it was 46% alcohol! Now that's worth your $$). Usually in places like these, you get small portions for big prices, but I think the portions and quality were well worth the prices. First, they serve you free plantain and potato chips with 3 types of dipping sauce. We then ordered the sampler empanada plate - delicious! We also ordered the mahi mahi skewer: the sauce was delectable and the portion was huge! We probably should have stopped there, but we wanted to try more so we ordered the lamb shank entree. It was falling off the bone and very savory. I wanted dessert but unfortunately, no room in my belly! The service was great and overall an almost perfect experience. I would say perfect except for the fact that I ordered the unfiltered sake and for $12, I got it in a glass that was MAYBE 2 ozs at the most.

All the fish dishes are great though, including ahi tuna and red snapper. For starters, they give you plantain and sweet potato chips with three diff sauces, which are all very flavorful.\n\nFor drinks, the pisco sour is an authentic drink from Peru...It is very sweet though, so I usually have to share.

I also noted that this place has a huge staff.  \n\nFrom there, it goes downhill unfortunately.  There was a distinct note of sweetness in nearly all of the dishes and certainly in the cocktails as well.  The cebiche crudo was OK, but trying to eat the large slices of raw onions was simply impossilbe without the (sweet) cebiche liquid flying everywhere.  Like some other places I can think of (Anchor & Hope and Slanted Door as examples), the space here is big, bright and very Spartan (and there is nothing good about that).  When subjected to tables so cramped that I fear my buttocks may swipe the plates from the next table when I get up, then there simply is not enough space!\n\nSo, altogether not a terrible experience, but simply one I would not wish to repeat.  Also, I have to question the economics of their business model since the customer traffic required to support the service staff they have means that every night probably has to be a blow out.  My guess is that they don't have what it takes to produce that sort of customer traffic on a consistent basis.", "author": "Richard P."}

There's a separate bar in the front and outdoor dining space right on the water. Definitely a place for seafood lovers...not so much vegan-friendly. Not sure if it's the most authentic Peruvian place but given it's proximity to Slanted Door (it's right next door), I think it's more like an upscale Peruvian fusion place. Upscale [insert ethnic cuisine] fusion is a very San Franciscan treat. When done well, this kind of food is a spendy but worthy treat and when done poorly it's a big waste of money and you might as well go to the authentic hole-in-the wall corner joint, but  I'd say that La Mar does a good job... and I'll definitely come back  here when I am craving some cebiche.", "author": "Kimi W."}

Flavor is awesome, great creations, and of course pricy.  This is a great place to bring first timers and taste the different Peruvian flavors in a supposedly luxurious, high class atmosphere. The decor is plain simple, the dark wood bar section is awesome, the group section is chic w/sofas.  What you are gonna eat, or i should say \"taste\" is great refine food by the spoon. Very, very small portions. Remember the ceviche sampler at Limon(4small plates w/small ceviche portions) well, take half from each plate, thats what u will get.  Same for the main dishes ($20-25) worth about 4 big table spoons of food (Lomo Saltado: 4oz of rice, 3-4 strips of beef & sauce). Need to remember you are going for the \" taste\" not to get full.  And the menu tells u, it reads: the sampler dishes are for sharing(2people); the rest: appetizers and main dishes are NOT!. Cause it's funny seeing couples who order a main dish ($25) w/ an extra plate for sharing and realize the main dish is sooo diminutive, you cannot share it, and if u do, people are gonna stare at u and ....you know :)\n*If you believe in the force like I do, Obi Wan Kenobi would definitely remind u: \"Do NOT ask for an extra plate!\" Concentrate & remember that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, had a blast flavoring 3 dishes, the ceviche sampler ($25), jalea ($15) and pisco sour! ($9), and dessert ($10).  People you will enconter next to u, metrosexualmen from across the embarcadero center/enterpreneurs/venture capitalists and the innocent ones who are in for a portion surprise.\n\nOh, La Mar in Lima, Peru is way different, pretty much the same prices, but because of el Nino, Peru is so abundant with fish and variety that the dishes over there are 10 times bigger.  Yes, lots of people in Peru are monetarily incapacitated, poor, but they dont worry about food, the basic need.  Now if u still hungry and notice that the bill it's easily and quickly hittin $100, u can always ask for a refill of the Peruvian chips w/ the 3 dipping sauces(huancaina(yellow), rocoto(red), and mani(peanut based)  that are complementary served when you first sit down.  Remember where u are, don't eat the chips as fast as u do at Chevys, have some class damn it :)  It's hard, i had to stop and freeze with my mouth open and realize what I was doing.  They are so delicious that immediatly u realize what an experience this is going to be.\n\nMy ranking for Peruvian restaurants in SF:\n\n1) La Mar (very special ocassions, or last dinner before jumpin the GGB)\n2) Mochica (amazing fresh seafood, Jalea!, top class)\n3)Fresca (anyday stop for the prices, ceviche and Pollo a la Brasa)\n4)Toro Loco in Pacifica ( only for the Anticuchos-heartbeef, just like Lima)\n5)El Perol inside Mission Market(only for Papa a la Huancaina, authentic)\n6)and Lemon (closed due to fire, now on S.VanNess and 22nd) Lemon for...dunno what for, rather go to Mochica. \n\nI cant wait to go back to La Mar and try the rest of the desserts, Peruvian cocktails, and the rest of the appetizers.

I forgot the dessert we had but we ordered two of them and they topped the meal!\n\nThe only reason I would hesitate to go back to La Mar Cebicheria is because there aren't enough water closets and they were not clean at all. \n\nOverall, this place gets 2.5 stars!", "author": "JL V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-02", "description": "Sad to say it, but we were disappointed.\nI'll start with the pisco sour, which is what we all started with.  My folks thought they were too heavy on the egg-white (which there was indeed a lot of), and I thought the white should have been a creamier foam.  I think they're better at Pisco lounge.\nThen we'll get to the service.  Actually, I think the servers are doing as good a job as they can, but I think they're way under staffed (or someone called in sick last minute).  There was one waiter for our entire (large) section, so we saw very little of him.  To make up for that, though, damn do things show up fast after you order them!  That was really impressive.\nWhile trying to flag down our waiter to order some wine, we got to spend a fair amount of time looking at the space.  It's white.  And remarkably bland.  There's a big open kitchen in the back (you can tell when there's a big flare-up every few minutes) but most of the seating is organized such that you can't really see it well.  Honestly, it's a pretty boring space.  Maybe they were going for the simplicity of a Peruvian cebicheria, but that just makes the $20 entrees seem ridiculous, so maybe it's better if they just weren't creative?\nFinally, the food.  It was good.  That's about it.  I've had better ceviche multiple places in the city - Destino most recently.  The chunks of mahi mahi in it, aside from being a poor choice environmentally, were tough and slightly fishy.  The 3 chile sauces with the house-made plantain chips were tasty, and the empanadas were also quite tasty (though again, I think Destino's are better).  Neither of the 2 rice dishes my folks got were great - one had so much more rice than seafood it felt like an excavation to find the fish.  The other was much more balanced, and had an interesting sort of smoky flavor, but certainly wasn't a standout.  I think I got the best of the 3, a roasted corvina over beans.  The fish was excellent, and the beans (while very filling) were a good match with it.\n\nSo yes, the physical location on the water is great, but the space itself is quite uninspired, the food is only average, and the price is high.  Unless I hear they've improved, I doubt I'll bother returning.", "author": "Don H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-29", "description": "Saturday was date night with my husband and we had 9 o'clock dinner reservations at La Mar Cebicheria, Gast\u00f3n Acurio's first San Francisco project at Pier 1 1/2 next to the Ferry Building.  I had read about Acurio, he is a heavy hitter in Peruvian cuisine.  He owns many restaurants, has published cookbooks and is a celebrity TV chef.   Beyond that, I didn't know what to expect. \n\nWe took a cab to the Embarcadero and were immediately drawn into the spacious, vibrant space, accented in blue, green and burnt orange hues.  We were a tad early so hubby and I sidled up to the bar and grabbed a Cristal Peruvian beer ($5) and pisco sour ($10), respectively.  My cocktail, made from distilled grapes with lime juice, simple syrup, egg whites and bitters was so refreshing.  It was a perfect combo of tart, sweet, bitter and creamy.  We decided to share the empanadas de aj\u00ed de gallina ($10) while we waited. Two big, savory pockets filled with tender hen arrived with a small salad tossed in a sweet vinaigrette.  It was delish!  We were really excited about the rest of the meal.\n\nAs soon as we were done, the hostess led us past the bustling lounge and raw bar showcasing beautiful, fresh octopus, and into the main dining room where my seat offered a good view of the open kitchen.  We shared a bunch of things, starting with the cebiche sampler.  It consisted of four plates of fish briefly marinated in different types of \"leche de tigre,\" or chili peppers and lime juice.  The cl\u00e1sico featured California halibut and red onions in habanero pepper leche de tigre with Peruvian corn and yam.  In the mixto, there was Mahi Mahi, calamari, octopus and habanero pepper in aj\u00ed amarillo leche de tigre, with cilantro and red onion.  In the nikei, ahi tuna was the star, with red onion and Japanese cucumber, in tamarind leche de tigre with avocado.  Finally, the chifa consisted of Mahi Mahi with peanuts, scallions, ginger, pickled carrots, daikon, habanero pepper, wonton strips and cilantro with sesame leche de tigre.  As many of you know by now, I don't do peanuts, so I had the chifa without, but it was still excellent.  We enjoyed each kind immensely, and my husband says it was the best cebiche he has ever tasted.  The fish was incredibly fresh and the flavors really popped.  Just beware of those thin slices of habanero pepper hiding beneath the cilantro leaves, unless you like setting your tongue on fire.\n\nThe anticuchos de pulpo ($13), or grilled octopus skewers with herbed mashed potato with chimichurri sauce and aj\u00ed panca, is a must.  It's amazing.  You get large pieces of tender octopus boasting a nice smokey flavor with a slightly sweet hint. \n\nThe causa lime\u00f1a ($12) came out next.  It had whipped potato with Dungeness crab, avocado puree, quail egg, cherry tomatoes, aj\u00ed amarillo Huancaina sauce with basil cilantro oil.  It was like a dressed up crab salad, tasty and creamy, but didn't wow us as much as the other items we sampled. \n\nOur server was so enthusiastic about the anticuchos de coraz\u00f3n ($11), or grilled beef heart skewers, which he claimed were so reminiscent of the ones he found while traveling in Peru, that we had to give them a shot.  We did this, despite our misgivings, having recently eaten duck heart elsewhere that was really tough and tasted like iron.  Well, right on, Nick, you called it!  It was surprisingly good, with a texture somewhat similar to a filet.  The red rocoto sauce packed a lot of heat, wow!  But fortunately, it was on the side so we could use as much or little as we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary basket of potato, sweet potato and plantain chips was good which is a testament to how well food is seasoned and prepared here.  My husband isn't a big fan of potatoes, but he actually liked the potato chips the best.  The chips were crispy, perfectly salted, cut on the thicker side and not all greasy.  They came with three sauces:  huanca\u00edna with aj\u00ed amarillo, rocoto, and ocopa with peanuts.  To boot, my husband also enjoyed the potatoes prepared in different ways in the rest of the dishes; what a nice surprise.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but next time, I may save room for the rollitos de arroz con leche ($10), a rice pudding spring roll topped with homemade aj\u00ed amarillo and orange marmalade with passion fruit sorbet.  We'll see, because first, I want to try  other items including tiraditos, sopas, salads, rice plates and main entrees.  They also have an interesting wine list with varieties from South America, Spain and California which needs exploring.  \n\nOur hostess and server were very friendly and attentive, and we appreciated it when the manager stopped by our table to see how we were doing.  We loved the airy space and lively atmosphere, it felt celebratory.  It would be great to return to La Mar during the day to take in the Bay view on their 80-seat patio.", "author": "Dina B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-05", "description": "Surely the best Peruvian restaurant in California, and quite likely, in the US.  Went for lunch today, with high expectations.  The location can't be beat.  Patio dining (by the sea!) will be offered starting next week.  The indoor space is ample, airy, modern, and sophisticated.  You'll recognize the colors, furniture, and even waitstaff uniforms from the original La Mar, in Lima (this is a franchise, after all).  Don't go expecting a traditional Peruvian cevicher\u00eda, \"huarique\"-style.  If you have ever heard of Gast\u00f3n Acurio, you will know that he has worked hard at bringing Peruvian cuisine up to international standards.  Don't get me wrong.  Peruvian food, per se, is delicious.  But where, until recently, could you find such care in the presentation, such innovation in the dishes prepared, besides the most tried and true of Peruvian ceviches, rice dishes, and stews?  Enter Gast\u00f3n.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  La Mar-San Francisco's menu is still limited when compared to the original's.  On to the food.\n\nOur choice of drinks: Chicha tu ma, Pisco Punch, and Pisco Sour.  Loved the Pisco Punch!  Curiously, this drink originated in San Francisco.  It is fruity: pisco, lime and pineapple juices.  We shared a ceviche chifa, a tiradito cl\u00e1sico, a causa criolla, and the anticuchos, as appetizers.  I had the arroz norte\u00f1o for an entree.  My husband tried the tuna special.  The two other people in our party went for the pescado a lo pobre and the arroz criollo (better known as arroz con mariscos).  The best appetizer was the anticuchos: grilled aj\u00ed panca-marinated octopus (with chimichurri, chopped herbs in oil) over mashed potato with herbs.  Aj\u00ed panca (on anticuchos at least) is rarely hot.  It is similar to paprika in taste.  The octopus was tender, tasty.  I can't imagine a better way to cook it than in the grill.  My arroz norte\u00f1o was also delicious.  The rice itself was \"atamalado,\" moist and plump.  Have you tried arroz con pollo or arroz con pato?  Well, I had the seafood version.  The predominant flavor (other than cilantro, of course) was the char from the wok!  It was served with huanca\u00edna sauce (I still had to ask for some aj\u00ed amarillo sauce for that extra spice).  Loved it.  For dessert, we ordered picarones and l\u00facuma tiramis\u00fa.  Those picarones!  Just like in Peru!  The zapallo (squash) taste shone through.  They were deep-fried to perfection and served (as tradition dictates) with chancaca honey.  Wary of getting lost in translation?  A glossary is provided in the menu.  I am not a fan of l\u00facuma, but my husband is.  He loved the l\u00facuma ice cream accompanying the tiramisu.  D'onofrio fans, you may be disappointed!  This is fresh l\u00facuma through and through.  I hear you can also find it in Mitchell's (in San Francisco), but La Mar's is way better, gelato-like creamy and with a very concentrated flavor.  I had tea; everyone else had coffee drinks.  No, you won't find your favorite (ok, mine) mate here, but the usual selection of jasmine, green, etc.  A good choice of dessert wines too!\n\nAs for the prices, appetizers range between $8-$15 (approximately).  Do go for the half orders of ceviche (and taste more!).  The price of entr\u00e9es is in the low to mid 20s.  I was a guest this time (thus, my lack of precision).  Service was attentive and friendly.  We saw quite a few Peruvian families in attendance.  I hear that weekdays tend to attract more of a business crowd.  The full menu is available at the bar between lunch and dinner hours.    \n\nSouthern Californians, rejoice!  La Mar is coming to San Diego next year.", "author": "Vanessa S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-19", "description": "I had dinner on a Saturday evening at La Mar and felt compelled to join yelp and write my first review after eating here.  \n\nTruthfully, I have been searching for a Peruvian restaurant that can do both the traditional Peruvian dishes and the more modern/fusion interpreted Peruvian dishes as well.  This combination is rare.  I am happy to say I found both at La Mar. If it is of any measure, my family is Peruvian and I have tried a number of Peruvian restaurants in the SF area (Limon, Fresca and Mi Lindo Peru) within the last year and felt that two of the three restaurants were good but not authentic enough for me.  The space of the restaurant is great (high ceilings, bright blue lights, on the water); the vibe, upscale but somewhat laid back.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.  \n\nI went into the dinner somewhat skeptical about the authenticity and how overdone the food might be and came out a fan.  After dinner, I called my family to rave about having found a Peruvian restaurant that is worthy to take them to when they visit.  \n\nTo start, we had \"chalaca\", the ceviche starter, and \"Tiradito cl\u00e1sico\".   \"Chalaca\" or \"choros a la chalaca\"  are mussels topped with lime juice, diced fresh tomatoes and onions.  This appetizer you can eat just about anywhere in Peru but really I have memories of having them on a hot day at the beach in the middle of the afternoon.  The \"choros\" were as fresh as I have had them.  We tried 4 different kinds of ceviche (ceviche cl\u00e1sico, ceviche mixto, Japanese influenced ceviche, Chinese influenced ceviche).  The choice of fish, the cut or presentation and sauce for each version of the ceviche was interesting.   The ceviche was served in small tapas like plates with medium sized cubes halibut, Mahi-Mahi, Yellow Tail and Ahi (depending on the ceviche you ordered).   The ceviche clasico was soaked in the lime based  \"leche de tigre\" sauce with thinly sliced onions, and some kernels of white corn (the corn that peruvians are oh so proud of).  The Japanese ceviche had cubes of Ahi with some tiny specks of seaweed on top. The mixto had more of the yellow chili pepper lime sauce and the Chinese influenced ceviche had an air of sesame in its sauce.   The Tiradito was served in thinly sliced leaf-like cuts with a leaf of cilantro and tiny piece of \"rocoto\" (chili pepper) resting on top.  It was very delicate.  \n\nAs our main, we shared \"Seco de Cordero\", a extremely tender lamb shank dressed in a cilantro based stew with with carrots and peas, and the classic Peruvian soup \"Chupe de Camarones\".  The lamb in the \"Seco\" was extremely tender served on the bone on top of a hash brown like potato mash with light cheese in the middle.  The lamb was not too gamy.  My only complaint is that despite having the carrots and few peas, it needed a little more of the cilantro stew served with it.    \n\nThe \"Chupe\" I had at La Mar was as traditional as it gets and I was very pleased with it.   As usual, it had a variety of ingredients. This \"Chupe\" has a milky soup base with shrimp, Aji, chopped onions, garlic, rice, potatoes, peas, and a poached egg in it.  It was savory and delicious albeit a tad salty.  I left that night happy that I could taste something like my grandmother's \"Chupe\" here so far away from Peru.", "author": "M H."}

It has no business being almost $30 unless it is big enough for two and I'm sure it is not. \n\nPeople who have read my previous reviews know that I respect only restaurants who can fairly price their menus based on quality and quantity. I would take slightly less swanky decorations for honest food. Like I said, the cebiches are well worth it, but La Mar has priced out some would-be regulars. One day, perhaps I'll be back to try a plato de fondo.", "author": "Maria Y."}

The chips with the three sauces that they bring to your table were great. We followed that with the traditional ceviche. Also very nice: very fresh halibut and an unusual but delicious leche de tigre. The portion was so small that we asked ourselves if we had ordered the half portion by mistake instead of the full portion. We followed that with the tamale and  the jalea (octopus and tuna). The tamale was excellent (but agan - very small portion). The jalea was really nothing special... the breading was falling apart and the tuna was a little fishy.\n\nDesert was ok and we had chicha morada to drink (a little too watery and too spicy).\n\nOverall a decent but expensive lunch. We may have enjoyed it more if we had made better menu selections. I guess we'll have to go back and see!", "author": "Pablo P."}

Once the sun is shining, I have a real problem eating anything but ceviche, tuna tartare or sushi.  I ate at one of Gaston's restaurants (Lima) a couple of years ago and loved it.  So I assumed La Mar would be gastronomically correct and on the higher end price-wise.  Surprise, I was right.  \nYou have to really know Peruvian food to understand what's going on here.  If you do, then you know that the preparation at La Mar is superb.  The food was phenomenal.  And expensive.  Normally such an over the top cost turns me off with what could be considered \"simpler\" food, but the plates here are prepared to perfection.  I thought about each thing I ate and looked at the check and thought...\"was it worth it\"?  Two for Lunch, no alcohol, two 1/2 ceviches, two entrees, shared dessert = $92 not including tip.  Yea, that's STEEP.  I hover between 3 $$$ and 4 $$$$ for this place.  Had we ordered drinks it would have been in the 4-$$$$ range for sure.  I almost choked when I saw the $27 lomo saltado on the menu.  Really?  As in for real?  I mean it's lomo saltado for God's sake.  Let's put it this way, it's the most typical (read \"basic\", \"common\" or \"country\") dish of Peru.  It would be like paying $27 for fried chicken or spaghetti at LUNCH.  But, that dang lomo saltado was the BEST lomo saltado I have ever had, and it might have been the best beef dish I have ever had.  Tastiest, tenderest beef ever.  Wow.  Well done.  And the ceviches are superb, as well as all the chifa-inspired dishes.  So the answer to the question \"was it worth it\" as I eyed the bill, is Yes.\nOh yeah, add in friendly wait-staff, a wonderful location, and a super patio.  Convenient street or lot parking along embarcadero.  This is one of those \"you get what you pay for\"s.  Save your pennies and go.", "author": "Isa L."}

I was a little nervous about the location in a heavy populated tourist area, but once we walked inside my fears subsided. This place is huge, with most likely some of the best views during the day. Peruvian food all dressed up and updated. We went to try this restaurant based on a recommendation from someone in our party. There is a full bar up in front, a raw bar just past the entrance and then the formal dining room. We chose to sit in the formal dining room and have dinner. We started the dinner off with an aperitif....a round of pisco sours which is a light drink made with egg whites. I can't remember the last time I had a pisco sour, but this one was served just right. I ordered a bottle of malbec from Mendoza for our meal. We just came from a long day of enjoying the abnormal warm weather for the city on Pier 23. Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go with the tasting of ceviches, and the tasting of empanadas. The ceviche tasting included 4 styles: Claisico, Mixto, Chalaco, and Nikei. Both appies were pleasing and the dipping sauces were a mix of savory and spicy. The tasting of empanadas included 1 of each: Lomo Saltado, Camarones, Chicken, and corn filled. I am a big fan of empanadas, historically always grabbing some in the Lower East Side. Our appies were accompanied by plantain chips and a trio of dipping sauces. For our main courses we ordered the Lomo Saltado, the Bass Nikei, Arroz Limeno, and the Pescado skewers. The real winner here was the Lomo Saltado, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth like butter. The Sea bass was a close second and a much lighter dish, but I think the traditional Lomo Saltado outshined the rest. Our server was informative and attentive and the food was excellent, albeit a little pricey for traditional peruvian food but you can't really beat the quality of the food. We ended the night with a dessert wine and went home satisfied. I will definitely make a repeat visit. Limon now has serious competition.", "author": "Anthony V."}

It's like a tangier margarita, and totally creeps up on you. The scallop risotto was to die for, and we had a beef dish with fries on top, that resembled a deconstructed pot-roast. The guys loved it needless to say! I would definitely rec commend this place for another group meeting. The only reason I am taking away one star, is because the picnic-table esque seating was a bit small for our group.

Thank goodness it was an unusually warm SF night since we were way outside of the heated area, right next to the outdoor lounge seating and the water.  I'm not sure if they usually have these tables here, but I can imagine it being a problem since it's not covered or heated and can be annoying with the lounge people right next to you getting drunk and yelling.  Anyhow, this place is beautiful, walking to the patio we got to see all the different seating area, the kitchen, and prep counters....and they did a  great job with the building.\n\nAfter sitting down it was a good few minutes before our waitress introduced herself, she then asked what kind of water we would like and told us that chips would be arriving soon.  Fifteen minutes later no water or chips came and we had to ask for them, which was answered with a generic \"it's coming\" response.  Finally, after 20 minutes we had water, 5+ more minutes and chips came out accompanied with three sauces.  Note that this is more than 30 minutes after we first sat down!!!  \n\nThankfully the food didn't take quite as long (but water refills were few and far in between.)  We ordered the Cebiche Tasting which had the Mixto, Chifa, Nikei and Cl\u00e1sico Cebiches.  The Chifa was interesting because it tasted like a generic Chinese Chicken Salad, but with fish, even had the stereotypical crispy wonton strips.  Overall these were pretty good and a generous portion.  Next up was the Causa Tasting with Lime\u00f1a, Criolla, Nikei, Casera varieties.  I thought the Causa Casera (vegetarian) was actually the best of these, the causa lime\u00f1a (crab) was a huge fishy tasting disappointment.  We also ordered the Tiradito Nikei, aji tuna in a sweet sauce that tastes like teriyaki, not in a good way, but at least the aji was good.  For something hot we ordered the Empanadas Tasting (yeah yeah, we couldn't decide on anything so went with the all encompassing samplers when it was available).  I like most of these empanadas, with the exception of the one that was filled with what tasted like creamed corn.  \n\nTo finish the meal we had the rollitos de arroz con leche dessert.  That's rice pudding stuffed into a fried egg roll and served with the sourest ice cream ever.  (Is passion fruit ice cream a Peruvian thing??)  Delicious without the ice cream, a wake up call if with.  \n\nThrough the night I realized that the entire patio had about four wait staff, but only one busboy and two runners.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume a busboy called in sick on the night that we went in, because there is no other way so many people could have liked this place with the level of service we received at La Mar.  Even with better service there are much better Peruvian food choices in the City at Fresca and Limon.

Ceviche was edible, but worse than the inexpensive Soy Cholo:  a miserable two small pieces of fish served with what seemed to be mashed potatoes shaped into a nice small smokestack.  The clams were the size of a pea (where did they find them that small?) swimming in a salty broth(that was the only spice in that broth).  Sorbet was OK, but our grocery store has better.  The atmosphere:  cafeteria, but nicely located near water.  Service:  waitress grabbed a glass of beer while passing by without asking if it was finished (it was not).

Great Flavors, Great Selection, Amazing Service, Yummy Drinks and a Beautiful Design.\n\n   Let me start out by saying I have never been compelled to stay in a restaurant for the sheer purpose of soaking up the atmosphere. Lar Mar rocks this aspect. From the moment I walked in I was taken by the colors of the restaurant. High ceilings, Deep brown furniture with bright turquoise fabrics, and a view of the bay. Even though it was raining I felt as if I had left SF. Truly an experience.\n  As soon as my Coworker and I entered the restaurant, we saw a plate of causas pass by. We were so obviously stricken by the site of them that the server stopped to tell us what he had on the plate. We immediately decided that we had to order that whether or not our client wanted them LOL. The causas are mashed potato pillows made with vibrant purple and yellow potatoes and topped with either crab and avocado, mahi mahi, tuna, or asparagus and artichoke. As they pass through the restaurant they are like purple beacons of happiness calling out to be ordered. Really it's as much art as it is food. Awesome.\n  I could honestly go on and on but everything was full of flavor and on par. I will say that I got the seafood soup for my entree which featured a poached egg. At first I was apprehensive about a yoke running amok in my soup, but they masterfully cook the egg to the right consistency so that when you break the yoke it doesn't bleed throughout your soup! They definitely scored on the technical side with that one. \n  In short if you enjoy seafood and Latin flavors, you must visit La Mar.

I was told someone would get back to me. 5 days later a woman called to say they could do the party of 9 but we had to do a set menu. She told me no exceptions and was very impatient with me. So instead of making us feel like we were special, they made us feel irritated. Since we did not want a set menu, one person agreed not to come. When I called back to make the reservation for 8 people, the next woman I spoke to was as terse as the first. Just not very customer friendly. \n\nSo we arrive *early* for out table for 8 at 8:30. At 8:29 I reconfirm with the hostess that we are all here and ready to be seated. She tells us to keep waiting in the bar. No explanation, no further information.

I had read about the opening of this Peruvian eatery and its founding famous Peruvian chef Gaston Acurio about a year before we finally got here for lunch earlier this month on our semiannual visit to San Francisco.  We are both big ceviche fans and have located the best Los Angeles Peruvian restaurants, including El Pollo Inka (23705\nHawthorne Blvd. Torrance, CA), Mario's Peruvian & Seafood (5786 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, CA) and right up the street from Mario's in Hollywood, Los Balcones del Peru (1360 Vine St. Hollywood, CA)--all more modest establishments which are affordable and serve up wonderfully fresh Peruvian cuisine, from ceviches to Lomo Saltado and many more authentic dishes.  Plus, at San Francisco's more upscale Fresca (2114 Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA), we have always had consistently mind-blowing ceviches, their fantastic lomo saltado and perfectly grilled rib eye steaks. \n\nAt La Mar, we ordered the ceviche mixto ($16) and--in a moment of reckless abandon--also ordered the ceviche chipotle ($18). While we waited, the busboy delivered a bowl of thick potato and platano chips, and three kinds of dipping sauce, warning us that the red one was spicy. The chips were fine, but not only was the red sauce not spicy, it hardly had any noticeable flavor. Then we tried the green sauce.  At least the green dipping sauce had some flavor of some cilantro and onion which was at best a pale imitation of the green table aji hot sauce--a staple at most of the aforementioned LA Peruvian restaurants we frequent. We tried the yellow sauce which was the most bland and flavorless of all. Our two ceviches arrived shortly thereafter and, sadly, based on visual first impressions, we were already disappointed.  We were anticipating a pile of fresh mixed fish, shrimp, octopus, and calamari with a mound of thinly sliced purple raw onions and a small teaspoon of aji amarillo chili salsa on top to mix in, with the usual large Peruvian corn and a couple chunks of sweet and white potato on the side.  Instead, in both ceviches, the seafood itself--which should be the showcase of any ceviche--was barely visible, submerged in a thick creamy-looking sauce.  The ceviche mixto was obscured in a bright yellow sauce, which presumably had the crucial Peruvian aji pepper in it but again the distinct aji flavor was barely discernable. Plus there was no brightness from citrus as there usually is from the taste of the fresh lime and/or lemon juice the ceviche is marinated in, normally enhanced with the crunchy onions, and a little chopped celery.  The ceviche chipotle had the same creamy appearance as the mixto, except it looked and tasted not unlike like Campbell's tomato soup--before you dilute it with water. \n\nEven with our own additions of lemon and lime juice, which we had to flag the busboy down for as our server was nowhere to be seen, the ceviche was not salvageable whatsoever. We had ordered one other entr\u00e9e from the menu, the grilled octopus with the chimichurri sauce, served with mashed potatoes, which we hoped, based on the reviews we'd read, might redeem our dining experience. Alas, it was not to be: the busboy brought us new plates and placed the entr\u00e9e ($16) in front of us.  On the plate at two-inch intervals were three small brazil-nut shaped and sized rations of mashed potatoes, each with a small piece of grilled octopus draped, packing mule-style, over each potato ration.  While the octopus was cooked properly and tasted good, coming on the wake of the ceviche experience and at a tad more than $5.00 a bite, it was hard to stomach. \n\nIt's sad that with its beautiful mod d\u00e9cor and prime location, this will be what many diners take away as Peruvian cuisine.  It's overpriced and it just isn't good.  San Franciscans:  Head to Fresca on Fillmore!

It is good to combine having dinner here and also visiting the nearby Ferry Building for pre-dinner snacks and shopping.   The hostess was very professional and accommodated us coming it a little early.  First we visited the bar, since we wanted to try one of their Pisco drinks on their cocktail menu.  I had the pisco punch and my wife had the pisco sour.  They were both delicious.  We were inspired to pick up some pisco at BevMo to make some drinks with it at home.  If you haven't had pisco, this is a restaurant to sample it.  We came to this restaurant primarily for the cebiches - we had the cebiche clasico and cebiche mixto.  Both were excellent.  If you like habanero, then you can add a bit of this too every bite for a spicy experience.  If you don't like it hot, be sure to pick it out.   Dinners come with fried plantain  chips with three sauces (mild, medium and hot).  The plantains are fried up crispy like a potato chip, so not oily or soggy.  One could probably just do 2 cibiches and plantains for a lite dinner, but we had the arroz criollo and the pescado nikei, both were excellent.", "author": "John H."}

We came here because my coworker's boy toy man plaything is one of the chef's here.  And am I ever glad that we did.  \n\nAs you first walk in, you enter a wide foyer with a bar to your right and a huge open dining area with high ceilings.  Throughout the dining room, there's a mixture of brightly colored cushions and pillows in some of the loungey seating areas along with the dark woods of the tables and bar area.  The look has a very modern feel and that is both welcoming and fun.  Since all tables were already packed for lunch this Friday afternoon, we decided to eat at the dining bar (which is separate from the alcohol bar to the right of the foyer).\n\nThe food here is amazing.  As we sat down, we were greeted with sweet potato, plantain and some other root chips along with 3 dipping sauces of increasing spiciness.  The mild sauce was a little lackluster, but the medium and spicy sauces were fantastic, as were the chips.  We ordered three ceviches, the classico, crudo and nikei to share while I ordered the braised lamb shank for an entree.  My other coworkers ordered the pan seared grouper and a spicy soup with various shellfish and seafood.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The ceviches were all very fresh, with a great balance of acidity and sweetness of each seafood.  The lamb shank was absolutely fork tender with the meat falling off the bone.  The curry sauce that accompanied it was also good, if a little heavy on the salt.  My coworkers dishes were similarly good and judgeing by how clean our plates were, you'd say we were more than satisfied.  \n\nThe service here was quick and responsive.  Our waters were kept full and finished plates were removed promptly despite the fact that the restaurant was bustling with patrons.  This definitely is not your bargain lunch as between the three of us we racked up a $130 tab including tip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-27", "description": "Let's get this out of the way first: La Mar is expensive. Like, prohibitively, embarrassingly, everyone's-looking-around-the-table-nervously expensive. For $15-20 appetizers (and up, for main courses) I was a little embarrassed about taking my family here. This restaurant is incredibly spacious, which for some reason always sends up a little red flag for me. It usually means that the restaurant is expensive or gimmicky, and in this cases, both. It's all very nicely decorated and such, but the table was set with paper placemats. Really? \n\nA lot of the dishes need some explanation/translation if you're not familiar with Peruvian food. It's loud inside, and if you have a big table and a petite waitress, a lot gets lost in translation. The appetizers are broken down into ceviches, mashed potatoes with various toppings, soups, and things on sticks. Entrees fall into the rice category, or something fancier. \n\nNevertheless, we were all pretty adventurous eaters and ended up getting quite a few appetizers and 2 entrees to share, which I think was the best way to go (and I would recommend it for large parties). The ceviche was, as expected, very good. Large pieces of fresh fish and seafood in a tangy and refreshing \"tiger milk\" marinade. There was a crab claw filled with shrimp and surrounded by bok choy, that could have come out of a very fancy dim sum joint. The skewered beef heart with potatoes and a mysterious spicy red dipping sauce was my favorite. Lomo saltado was alright, but I balked at the $30 price tag for what is essentially beef stir-fry on top of french fries. Overall, the food was good. However, one area where they could use some work is their dessert menu. The bread pudding was soggy, sloppy and bland, and none of the flavors of the creme caramel were jiving. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't come here again unless I had an insatiable craving for top quality ceviche and didn't mind paying the price. My recommendation if you want to try out La Mar is to treat it like tapas. Or just sit at the bar and get drinks. Share a couple of appetizers family style; it will fill you up just enough, and your wallet will thank you.", "author": "Tammy C."}

I ordered an entree called  \"chupe de camarones\", a traditional Peruvian prawn soup with potatoes, aj\u00ed panca, peas, rice and poached egg. It was quite tasty, reminded me of comfort food.  Overall a very good dining experience, lots of tasty dishes and excellent desserts. A bit pricey  because of the location.", "author": "vinh t."}

The view is charming--with a Miami feel to it.  The food is extremely flavorful and very well prepared.  We ordered a rice seafood dish, and requested it to be extra-spicy (which it was indeed).  The basket of house-made \"chips\" with the three accompanying sauces were delicious.  The crab causa was unremarkable.  The grilled octopus appetizer was also unremarkable. The pisco-sour was artistically done and not overly sweet.  The service was attentive but not intrusive.  \n\nFor dinner, depending on the weather, patio dining may not be as pleasurable, due to the fog rolling in and the ocean breeze.  The heaters and plastic barriers do little to cut the chill.\n\nFor happy hour, drinks are very reasonably priced, and the bar is packed.  It is a high energy place for a fun drink.\n\nThose not acquainted with Peruvian cuisine might find the description of the items on the menu to be confusing or too brief.

Being in a converted pier, the high ceilings, white painted wall, peacock blue chairs and expanses of windows give the space a light and airy feel. Given the design and nature of the space, the noise level is surprisingly low.  As for the food, well, let's just say it was  some of the best and freshest sashimi-grade fish I've ever had. It was exquisitely presented, and the sauces and seasonings provided perfect complements. Our waiter suggested several options from the different categories of tpas-like small plates on the menu and helped my dining companion and myself put together a balanced meal.  It may not be the most traditional Peruvian food I've ever had, but who cares?  It was wonderful!

Overall, it was a very so-so experience and I would not return.\n\nI'll start with the food. The menu seemed very appealing and so we ordered a lot of small plates and one large. Unfortunately, I was unable to partake in their famous cevche, so I can not comment here. However, we did try the sampling of everything else, the empanadas, the kebabs, the potato dishes etc. Everything has an ok flavor but absolutely nothing we ate screamed out at us as really good or exceptional. The one thing that did come to mind, and I hate to say this is 'production line cuisine'. First, most things did not taste as if they had been carried out fresh, it seemed as if they had sat for awhile under a heat lamp or just sat on a cart. The octopus kebab-great flavor but definitely had been sitting for awhile. Same with the small plate sampling of the potato dishes. It really came across like a restaurant that was too big and too full for its own good. The empenadas-they were brought out on time although 25 minutes after the other small dishes- and they were just so so. We finished our meal with the lomo saltada which I had high expectations for. It was good, but not as good as the Peruvian restaurant Fresca or as good as our friend makes at home. A little over salted and gravied.\n\nOn the service side, our server was extremely nice, and from Peru which was nice as well, however the service was slow and getting our first drink took more than 20 minutes. When we came in, the front of the house had not taken my reservation correctly and luckily we were able to be seated-phew!. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed although I still enjoyed myself. It unfortunately, is tourist level food. I remember getting the same feeling when I have eaten at an Asia de cuba restaurant-great ratings but hotel worthy restaurant! If you do go, request a seat on the outdoor patio, the interior is very crowded and loud and outside is quite nice. The one thing that stood out-the freshly made chips and dips they bring out at the beginning.", "author": "pamela h."}

It was a refreshing change from my constant california cuisine (but don't get me wrong, I love Californian/Americanish..whatever... good food).  We ordered 4 or 5 things; one from each section of the menu and they were prepared well and the seafood was fresh. The chips and dips were pretty yummy too. I filled myself up on the dips and added them to almost every plate that came out. \nI'd probably come again if I was in the mood for seafood or happened to be downtown because it's convenient.

I'll never go back since their are plenty of restaurants in the city that do great food and guest service.  My party arrived on time but the La Mar hostess refused to seat us because one of our guests was running late.  If you know La Mar you know it's never full ( the dining room is massive) so I have no idea why they have this policy which justifiably has a place at smaller restaurants.  Because our late guest showed up 20 minutes late, La Mar cancelled our reservation even though the hostess knew we were waiting to be seated (and therefore I didn't receive opentable credit which was an annoying capper to the whole situation).  Sure enough when we were finally seated, there were a slew of empty tables of all sizes - plenty of two and four tops remained open through out our entire lunch.  Overall, stupid and pretentious policy is enough of a turn off never to go back to this otherwise mediocre restaurant.  Oh, and the snarky hostess at 12pm on 9/20 should be fired - there are plenty of people who need a job who know how to treat a customer right.  And yes, I'm sure she was just following management policy (which is why I'll never return) but customer service is all about delivery.

I had asked to talk to a manager (which I told was Andrew) but due to the party located in the back he was unable to make a timely appearance at which point I decided I had wasted enough of my weekend at la mar.\n\nI even took the time to draft an email to the restaurant and never heard a peep....due to the misleading star rating I'm giving it a one to hopefully keep the overall rating at somewhere near actual expectations.", "author": "Jay K."}

I have had lunch here 3 times and evening drinks 1 time, and each visit has been fabulous!\n\nMy first visit was with my 2 favorite co-workers, and the main reason we came was to visit my co-worker's boyfriend, who is a ceviche chef at La Mar.  We ate the ceviche bar and were able to watch the chefs construct these beautiful plates of ceviches and other appetizers.  One of my favorite things about La Mar is the root vegetable and fried plantain chips they serve along with 3 creamy and spicy sauces.  We ordered three ceviches to share among us:  the classico (halibut), crudo (scallops and uni) and nikei (ahi and avocado).  For our main courses were roasted grouper with manila clams, calamari, aj\u00ed panca stew and green tamale cream; a braised lamb shank, mashed rice and bean tacu tacu, cilantro sauce; and Parihuela (soup with mussels, calamari, clams and mahi mahi, fermented peruvian corn cider chicha de jora, ginger and red onion).\n\nVisit #2: I also came here with another co-worker and our boss for a holiday/celebratory lunch.  This time we ordered from the \"Express Lunch Prix Fixe\" menu.  There were 3 courses: appetizer, main course, and dessert, with 3 items to choose from each course.  Since there was 3 of us, we ordered one of each item on the prix fixe menu.  Everything was fabulous!  The appetizers were the ceviche mixto (mahi mahi/calamari/octapus), dungeoness crab causa (crab salad on a whipped potato), and Aguadito (calamari, mussels and manila clam soup with cilantro, yellow potato, rice and Peruvian aj\u00eds).  The main courses were a arroz criollo (similar to a paella but without the saffron); a pan-fried sea bass with mashed yucca, tamarind, red onion and tomato sauce; and saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, aji amarillo with potato fries and rice (which reminded me of a Chinese-styled beef and tomato stir-fry).  The desserts were: Picarones (pumpkin and sweet potato fritters with fig syrup, like beignets); grape granite with pisco sour foam; tiramisu with butterscotch ice cream.  We washed everything down with pisco sour cocktails.\n\nVisit #3:  Drinks with my coworker and her aforementioned chef boyfriend and my husband at the bar.  It was my hubby's bday, so chef friend ordered a pisco sour for him, and the bartender gave us all pisco shots.  Pisco, if you get over the way it burns your throat, has a very floral aroma to it.  We also snacked on these right-out-of-the-fryer salted \"corn nuts.\"\n\nVisit #4:  Lunch with husband and friends.  Pre-lunch, husband and I had some delicious cocktails at the bar:  1) a pisco-based cocktail with prickly pear juice and 2) a brandy and Grand Marnier concoction with passion fruit juice.\n\nThe ambiance and decor is lovely, very turquoise blue and nautical.

Unfortunately, for La Mar, it's the latter.  We arrived shortly after 9PM on a Friday evening hoping to sit at the cool blue-lit bar...only to be told rather brusquely that the bar section was closing and that we would have to be seated elsewhere (more than an hour later the bar hadn't closed).  The table we were given at the edge of the main dining room was so dimly lit (with no table lighting either) that it noticable detracted from the dining experience.  The dishes (ceviche sample, tuna and a chocolate dessert), seemed much like the service - superficial - a desultory effort  - not objectionable to be sure, but perfunctory and pretenious.   We had an ever changing cast of servers some of whom were attentive and other not at all...and we finally had to conspiucously flag one of them down after a lengthy wait to just get our check.   I had seen some glowing reviews of La Mar and was looking forward to a great dining experience, but it fell short pretty much across the board.  It wasn't quite as bad as a one star experience, but I feel like I'm being generous by giving it two.

I knew she had probably sampled La Mar's food many times at the Mexico City outpost of the Peruvian restaurant group.  With her stamp of approval and a list of recommendations, I arranged to meet a few girlfriends for lunch.  I love ceviche and consider San Francisco a reputable provider of fresh seafood thanks to its geographic location.  On this dining occasion, my memory has almost entirely failed me, but I recall adoring the food.  All the dishes we tasted (three ceviches and one causa) were clean in an almost Japanese-like presentation, flavorful, well balanced, and creative.  I really enjoy the use of hot peppers with raw fish and shellfish.  (It hasn't taken hold in sushi joints in North America, but I assure you that a sliver of jalape\u00f1o pepper soaked in soy sauce on top of sushi is explosive pleasure.)  Several of La Mar's dishes included haba\u00f1ero pepper, whose heat opens up the flavors of the fish and gives otherwise mild flavors a boost.  Another common ingredient in our ceviches was Peruvian Corn, which is fatter than American corn, similar to hominy, and provides a great bite of starchiness and texture.  My favorite dish was a causa called Lime\u00f1a - a capsule of potato pur\u00e9e filled with Dungeness Crab, avocado pur\u00e9e, cherry tomatoes, yellow chili pepper sauce and basil cilantro oil.", "author": "T.

We had a party of around 9 and we shared the 3-salmon skewer appetizers (~$13), the ceviche sampler (~$22) and the causa sampler. The salmon skewers were well cooked but not worth what we paid: we got 3 bite-sized portions of salmon on top of a dab of mashed potatoes. The ceviches were all tasty, I especially liked the halibut and the tuna. The causas were just ok, they are rolls of potato mash (sort of like a large tater tot but less deep fried) topped with fish of some kind. But they were also very small portions, each one is about the size of a large marshmellow (the kind used for s'mores...yum!) and I would definitely not recommend getting those. \n\nThe entrees were extremely well prepared. My bf had a beef dish with french fries and rice (~$27) and the beef was the best I've had in a long time, very tender and flavorful. The sauce used for the dish was wonderful, I kept stealing his french fries to dip in the beef juice. I got the cau cau (~$31), which are 3 large scallops on top of risotto and topped with arugula. The scallops were perfectly cooked, slightly grilled on the outside and tender on the inside. It tasted really fresh and the scallops were slightly sweet. The risotto was too undercooked for my taste. Instead of bread at the table, they had a basket of potato, sweet potato and plaintain crisps with very yummy salsas. \n\nOverall the food was excellent though pricy, and the service was decent. We were seated outside and there were mega strong heaters, and we had to ask repeatedly for them to be turned off before they were. And there were some mix-ups with the  drinks and the wait staff were slow to to take our orders and bring the food. But they did pretty well considering we had 9 in our group.

And the fact that the highlight of my meal was a bite of a sushi roll that we happened to order is not really a good sign. This is a South American restaurant, not a Japanese one. It was good, don't get me wrong. However, I won't be searching it out again. I don't plan on being back.", "author": "Amanda S."}

The food was pretty tasty and interesting, but the service was not great - inattentive and not particularly friendly. Example, I ordered the San Martin cocktail. I was surprised when a beer (St. Martin, as it turns out) was dropped off in front of me. Ok, these things happen - the names are very similar. When I mention the error to the guy who delivered the beer, he glanced at me, then proceeded to walk away. um, ok... When our waiter came back, I noted the drink error. I did get the cocktail...20 minutes later. On to the food: We ordered the causa tasting. Favorites were the ones with crab and tuna. The one w/ fried fish was just not good at all and the avocado causa was pretty boring. We also ordered the cebiche tasting. High points were tuna and hamachi. Didn't care for the squid or octopus versions. Other menu highlights: Crab meatballs were spicy and delicious. Empanadas sampler was fantastic. Beef skeeters were ok - nothing special. For dessert, we sampled the chocolate beignets, which were scrumptious!.  Overall, the plates are beautiful to look at, the food is mostly quite good, and the space is fun. So, despite the service, I'd still come back here.", "author": "Eme L."}

Although I didn't specifically remember the hostess or server, it didn't stick out in my mind as being uptight or snobby. I took a new client to lunch there this past Saturday and although I found our server to be nice, the hostess was incredibly snooty. Not friendly or hospitable, two requirements I would think are necessary when meeting and greeting customers. When we shown to our table, we asked to be seated in the shade. Again, I felt we were met with attitude and the three of us were left standing in the middle of the patio while she 'checked' if this was possible. Bear in mind, there was about 20 tables on the patio and four were occupied at the time  I understand that there's a system in place and that servers have their sections but being friendly would go a LONG way in a situation like this.  My clients and I just felt totally uncomfortable standing there like idiots.  You would think we'd asked the lady to empty out the entire patio for us! We had a seriously long wait between our starters and our main course but the server was apologetic about that and I'm sure it was a screw up in the kitchen. These things happen. The food was nice some of the portions were very small. Next time, I'd eat a protein bar before coming here!  I typically don't write bad reviews on Yelp but for a restaurant that has terrific views and a beautiful setting, I think you'd over come the price point if you felt a bit more welcomed by the staff.", "author": "Clare C."}

I really liked the decor of the place as it's very modern and simple. The food was very tasty. We shared 3 plates and started off with cebiche mixto. Seafood was fresh and marinated just right. We then had the empanada sampler. These were very good, fried perfectly and didn't have a greasy feel. I enjoyed all except the empanada de tamalito. I think that's because the others had better flavor and texture. That one just seemed like mushed vegetables. Our last dish, which was the best dish of all was the lomo saltado. I've had this in other peruvian restaurants but this is by far the best place. The meat was soft and tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The sauce had just the right amount of saltiness to it. It was to die for! One thing I didn't like so much was that the place was very loud.

It is full of nteresting selections from Spain and South America. The food is great. Of the 6 dishes we had, I would come back to eat 4 of them again. The civiche is fantastic as are the empenadas. We had a fried fish dish- like a mix of fish and calamari in a frito misto style that was so good. \nThe problem was the server, who I swear must have left for 45 minutes. A manager ended up taking over our table for a period of time, but we had to reorder things from him. We asked the food runner for an additional appetizer, but he said he couldn't help us. Our server had abandoned us and we were out of wine. One of our courses was delivered without silverware. We had to flag someone to ask for it. Most of these things are forgivable in a casual restaurant. But when you pay $250 for three people better service is a must. \nThe weird thing is that the waitress showed up again at the very end of the meal like she had never left. On the bottom of the check is a gratuity suggestion, listing the amount for 18%, 20% and 25%!!!!!\nSince when was 25% standard? I found this to be so offensive. I always tip 20%, but when the service here deserved half of that, they were suggesting a higher amount. Ballsey, no?\nI might come back, but I doubt it.", "author": "Christy F."}

Now, come on! If your policy is not to seat incomplete parties, that's fine, but lets call it what it is, and say 'sorry, that's our policy', but instead to pretend like you're doing it for ME? really? you're doing ME a favor? puhleeze.

We swapped it out with the table next to us once they left.\n\nWe ordered dinner and appetizers and wine.  After our first round of appetizers we finished our wine and the waiter took the bottle (never asked if we wanted any more wine/drinks).  Our second round of appetizers came at the same time as our entrees and only after asking and talking with a manager did they ask if we wanted more wine (which we did).  There were also many times our waters were empty and we had to ask for these to be refilled.\n\nTwo of the dinners came to the table cold and we had to return them - they arrived after the other two of us were already done with our meals.\n\nI did talk with the management team and they did appreciate the feedback.  However the service did not get any better even after that interaction with the management team.\n\nThe cost was over $500 for four and in reality could have been higher with additional wine if they were paying any attention or offering what you would expect in service for the price/positioning of this restaurant (high end Peruvian).\n\nI will again say the food is very good and that is the only reason I would consider going back but the service really needs to be improved quite a bit.

The Rocoto Relleno was as good or better than I had when I visited Arequipa Peru (where Rocoto Relleno is a specialty of the region).  The Lomo Saltado was some of the best I have ever eaten.  Spices were perfect and food arrived piping hot.  \n\nMy husband had the corazon anticuchos (shish-kebabs of beef heart) as an appetizer and Cordero (lamb shank) for his main dish.  I'm not a fan of eating organ meats, but I had a bite of his anticuchos and have to admit it was wonderful and the giant choclo (corn) with the anticuchos was fabulous.  The Cordero was also very good with the tacu tacu which was served with it.  The pisco drinks are fantastic, but pricy.\n\nThe only food disappointment was the picarones for dessert.  (kind of a donut made of sweet potato batter with a molasses-like syrup).  The taste was fine, but it took a while from the time we ordered them to the time we were served - the picarones were pretty much cold instead of being hot like they should have been served.  I would have sent them back, but it was getting late and our waiter was no where to be found.

It was amazing...and in turn, so is La Mar. Ceviches are rich and tasty. If you are into authenticity, try all but the Tuna, as that has more of Japanese \"Poke-esque\" flavor. The Anticuchos appetizer is way out of left field (muy diferente, if unusual) from the real thing, but damn it tastes great!  \nLomo Saltado...number 1 place for Lomo Saltado...I would like more on my plate...(-1 star for the quantity only). Drinks are tremendously good...Pisco Sour is as tasty as I had in Peru. Not too sweet and not too tart...just a great balance. Chicha Tu Ma! is a great drink too and cannot be missed for the Chicha Morada fans. All I can say is Peruvian's everywhere should be proud of getting the Gringo's out to try such a wonderful cuisine that is unique to Peru.", "author": "Ramon B."}

If you want to come here and get cocktails I recommend only ordering 1 or 2 and not 5!  Each drink is $10.  The santa maria was good.  Nice and pink.  I lost one of my fat balls that night.  Everyone and their fatty mothers ordered the pisco sour.  I was at the bar for about 4-5 hours.  I was Dr. Fatty Phil after the 4th hour.  Some random couple sitting next to me asked me to be a neutral party in their relationship problems.  I sat there for about 20 minutes pretending to be a therapist.  I guess they have sex all the time even though they aren't officially a couple.  The guy broke up with her 6 months ago.  They work together.  They then have sex on a  work trip 6 months later.  They talk about getting back together.  The chick has the guys email password.  The guy emailed a stripper and told her to meet him in SF while he tell this girl he wants to get with her.  So they wanted to ask me who is the fucked up one out of the two of them.  The guy says she shouldn't be in his email.  The girl says he shouldn't be inviting strippers to visit him while they are trying to get back together.  I say just have sex with each other until the guy gets bored then call up the stripper to join in.  The End.  Every other drink made was a pisco sour.  They put some cool drops to give the drink a nice smell.  I kept taking the bottle and smelling it.  I bet I got everyone that ordered that drink germs.  I thought the drink itself was ok.  The bartender also made a special girl drink for me.  I then lost my other ball.  After the 5th hour I was hungry.  I ordered some flank steak dish with potatoes and a sunny side egg.  It was pretty good.  But I dunno if it was $30 good.  This is high end Peruvian food.", "author": "Fatty A."}

After a mediocre meal (great ceviches, very weak main dishes) with all around inattentive and blas\u00e9 service, my friend left a 10 percent tip on his portion of the check.  As we're walking out the entry, our waiter, who until this point did not pay us very much attention, comes bounding after us and grabs my friend by the shoulder.  Fuming, he confronted my friend about the fact that  he only left a 10 percent tip and was very belligerent.  The manager came out and heard both sides of the story.  My friend explained that the service was very inattentive all night, and that it took us about 3-4 tries to get any assistance regarding wine, etc., and that the 10 percent was commiserate with the level of service and that this was a way of letting the waiter know that the service was not up to par.  At this point, we turned around and left.   \n\nIn the restaurant's defense, the manager came running out after we left the restaurant and apologized for the waiter's behavior.  The manager's entirely appropriate handling of the situation made us feel better; however, the waiter!  I sincerely hope that man takes anger management classes and leaves the service industry immediately.  As for the food, the namesake ceviches were great (the uni with sea scallops were amazing); the main dishes were mediocre (pork was very very dry; rice dishes were okay; the braised lamb was good, but nothing to write home about).  But I don't go to restaurants to first be ignored by then almost come fist to cuffs with the waiter.  LOTS of wrinkles to be ironed out here. \n\nBottom line:  The food isn't good enough to warrant a visit; the space is too large and feels a bit chain-restaurant-y. I  predict that this will very soon be relegated to the tourists willing to shill out for a mediocre experience and an Embarcadero address.  The locals will stay clear of this place after the hype/publicity dies down.", "author": "JY Y."}

The food was delicious and the wait staff was great. We had a reservation and arrived on-time but did have to wait 20 minutes while our table was prepared (we had a group of 8). To thank us for waiting the waiter brought a round of gratis Pisco Sours to ease us into our meal. We threw ourselves at the mercy of our waiter and he led us on a journey across the menu.

We said that was fine and told him we would sit in the bar and wait. He reminded us again that it would be an hour, apparently he thought it was not clear the first time. We asked to put our name in and he dismissed us and told us that he would find us with a dismissive tone. After more than an hour catching up with friends in the bar he came over and told us that someone was a no show and he would take us early (Hour and 15 min in). No complaints about the wait, which we expected, but when we got out to the large patio it was almost completely empty. The restaurant was maybe half full as well.

It doesn't matter if the restaurant is empty or packed, you're going to be waiting at every step of the meal, from getting seated and having your order taken, to getting drinks refilled and your check at the end.  The waitstaff is pleasant, and doesn't seem to be doing anything wrong per se, but the place still has some room for organizational improvement.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-23", "description": "This place is absolutely astonishing!\n\nI went here with my Dad shortly afer their grand opening.  I'm a self proclaimed restaurant snob, so coming from me, this means a lot.  \n\nWe were warmly welcomed by more than one hostess.  We were asked whether we would like to be seated immediately (though we were there 20 minutes early) or enjoy the bar for a drink, until our designated reservation time.  I love to experience all aspects of a restaurant, and chose to further explore the bar.  The bar is bright and tropical and seems to cater to single customers upon group wine tastings, as well.\nThough it took the bar tender a few minutes to break away from what he was currently doing, he anxiously greeted us to take our drink order.  He kindly suggested a red wine for my dad, as I studied the very unusual Peruvian drink menu.  I like to custom-order drinks, so I asked the bartender for something spicy.  Although a little taken a back (as most people would be about such a request), he quickly brainstormed to make me exactly what I wanted.  \nHere's what he concocted: muddled cilantro, lime juice, cachaca (I believe it was this Brazilian alcohol), agave nectar, habanero, and blue corn.  I kid you not, this drink was literally breath taking.  I took a sip and my jaw dropped!  I've never tasted something so charismatic!  It was similar to drinking (pleasantly so) liquid salsa.  It was impeccably created.  Jose, I believe his name was, told me to name it, since it was a spur of the moment creation.  I told I would return back when I'd thought of something clever.\n\nSeated promptly at our reservation time, we walked through the vast space this restaurant encompasses towards the main dining section, overlooking the water.  Beautifully decorated and meticulously designed, there is nothing about this restaurant that wouldn't captures one's attention.\nSeated at a nice two-some table near the open kitchen, we were thoroughly explained the menu by our waiter.  We were also tended to quite regularly by not only our waiter, but two very kind bussers.  The gathering of people in this large and spacious main dining area seemed to be business people mixed with couples and those who were in open and upbeat moods.  Everyone appreared to enjoy the gorgeous view and incredibly unique food.  \n\nThe food is so well thought out.  It would take far too much time to describe all that we had, but in short, it was perfectly displayed, prepared and tasting.  The fish is extremely fresh, the concept is near sushi-like with a strong Peruvian influence.  The portions are just right, not too small, not too large.  I would highly recommend sharing starters and/or entrees since there is so much to choose from! \n\nThe staff seemed proud to be a part of this establishment and were well informed.\n\nI rave to everyone about my recent experience here, and push for all to embark upon their own outtings .  I am very much anticipating my own return and highly recommend everyone to pop in for a drink, dinner or both.\n\np.s. I did go back to the bar to name the drink: Cilantro Fuego...if they are not familiar, at least you have a list of the ingredients to experience this utterly fabulous drink yourself!", "author": "Erika S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-14", "description": "A long-time friend of my wife's took us out to dinner on Tuesday 12th May 2009. We had reservations and so were seated by 6.40PM. After a few minutes we were brought water and fried potato/sweet potato/plantain slices to nibble on with three excellent sauce dips. We ordered cocktails: pisco sour and pisco punch and these were 'tasteee' (I'm a beer drinker so this was a sort of step into the dark trying 'hard' liquor so to speak). My wife ordered the non-alcoholic chiche morada. Her first glass was slightly disappointing but her refill (maybe, or simply a repeat order - we weren't paying so I didn't see the bill) was much better. My American wife is of Peruvian descent and so this was going to be a true test of everything everybody's raved about this 'new' restaurant. The three of us chose two cerbiches (they spell 'cerviche' 'cerbiche' at La Mar - I don't know why?) and one grilled mahi mahi skewer starter. The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly - melt in your mouth quality. Top marks to the grilling skills there. The cerbiche dishes were the 'mixto' from the menu (which obviously contained  various fish and a pleasantly seasoned citrus 'cooking' juice) and the other choice was one of the three daily specials: a mix of sliced octupus, fresh sea urchin (which I'd never eaten before and was divine in texture and very pleasing to the palette), scallops, thinly sliced onions, a dash of sliced habanero (which could be left to the side depending on one's tolerance for heat in cerbiche) and maybe a few extra ingredients which escape my memory at the moment, along with a yellow citrus 'cooking' juice. A wonderful start I have to honestly say.\n\nThe three entrees we chose were: leg of duck with 'green' rice (best description there is as it's identical to the excellent creation my mother-in-law cooks and I've yet to master myself), a seafood mixture with the same rice, and the lomo soltado (which every Peruvian restaurant on earth will have by the way). The duck was cooked to perfection. Quite unbelievably perfect I have to say. I have never sampled duck served in a restaurant that was so perfectly prepared. I'm still amazed with its quality two days later. The seafood dish was very generous and all the seafood items were once again individually cooked extremely well. Delicious. And a large serving as well. Surprised there a bit. For instance, entrees at First Crush on Cyril Magnon are tiny in comparison - the quality of cooking is excellent there though. Can't knock that place on those grounds. Finally the 'lomo' as it's casually known  [yes, there is pollo (chicken) soltado, and fish soltado, but, as it's known as the national dish of Peru, lomo (beef strips, made with at least sirloin cut quality) soltado is commonly abbreviated as just 'lomo']. La Mar uses a tenderloin cut served with a decent quantity of 'seasoning gravy' to accompany the excellent French fries and 'eighthed' sliced tomatoes, with cilantro garnishing and plain white rice. Extremely well made and a meritorious display of culinary expertise by the kitchen. Now, raving at what my brother-in-law says are simply 'standard' dishes may sound odd to him, but as a decent home cook myself I was honestly impressed with every dish. I wish I could create these dishes as well at home. Good seasoning balance and perfect texture to the cooked meat and fish. We were full and didn't sample a dessert so if I ever return I'll skip the starter maybe and sample one of the wonderful creations the praised pastry/desert chef makes. \n\nOther reviews have savaged the place on its service. We enjoyed pretty decent friendly service. It is a busy place probably every day of the week. If you are considering going I'd assume a reservation is a no-brainer, and it's possibly a place where if it does get really busy then some slight delays could occur. We didn't suffer any problems in that regard. My brother-in-law would never give anywhere 5 stars, but as I don't consider him much of a cook at all his opinion is unrealistic to me. To me this is a 5-star place. Yes he's Peruvian, but I consider my judge of properly cooked (to restaurant standard level) meat and fish to be more objective. \n\nThis is a superb friendly restaurant and one SF should be rightly proud of. \n\nFinally, you're going here because it has earned a fine rating through its reviews. Yes, it comes with 3 '$\"s as a price rating (definitelyy 4 if the excellent cocktails are sampled, the most expensive menu items are chosen along with dessert as well), and there's imported beer alternatives as well, but they're standard fare really. If you're bothered about the price then don't come. Eat at three ordinary places instead. Or, save up and have a real treat. The food is certainly kid-friendly if any 'hot' garnishes are ignored, and the generous entrees mean you'd have a great 'doggy-bag' to go home with!\n\nI don't think I give many 5 star ratings out  (Colibri, Helmand Palace) so this place has something let me tell you.", "author": "Ian W."}

As it turns out there were no kinks whatsoever.  We walk in to a beautifully designed area.  There is a Pisco bar to your right, straight ahead is the ceviche bar (like a sushi bar) and continuing on is the dining room.  After we were seated the waitress brought us three dipping sauces and very unique chips made of dried potatoes, tomatoes and what had to be bananas.  This was delicious.  We ordered drinks, a Pisco Sour and a Tumi (like a cosmo but with Pisco, prickely pear).  As noted in another review the Pisco will be the new hot drink.  The specialty drink menu is very long, think Pisco twist on normal drinks and you will have a good idea.  We ordered the Cebiche Nikei (ahi tuna with avocado in a ceviche).  It was also amazing.  There is a lot of Asian influenced dishes on the menu.  For the main course we had the lomo saltado (filet mignon strips with onions and french fries) and the halibut.  Again both were delicious.

For a Tuesday, the place was pleasantly crowded (always a good sign) so I sat at the front bar to try out some food and have a little drink. The guys at the bar were nothing but super friendly, suggesting choice dishes and making conversation. Though the menu is pretty expansive with their Peruvian specialties, I came for one reason and that being the cebiche. By recommendation of the bartender, I decided to go over the Cebiche Tasting which included four different types of marinated fish. Though the portions were small - four small bowls with about 5 pieces of fish each - the taste was terrific. The fish was melt-in-your mouth fresh and the marinades were not over-powering. My two favorites were the spicy lime marinade and a Thai-inspired one. The only downside, as mentioned before, the portions of the fish are small, so my suggestion is to order something else more hearty or several appetizers from the menu as well. Try the Anticuchos, the grill-roasted octopus on a skewer over mashed potato and Chimichurri sauce - it's tender and delicious!", "author": "Cynthia G."}

There is valet parking for $20 (versus $2 for 4-hour street parking). Hostess suggested that just think of the ~$50 parking ticket as a very expensive cocktail drink??

This area was empty but the hostess constrained us to sit at one area because we'd be better served on that side...but that took away being able to look out the window onto the Bay.  This is a pretty big place, and it's just west of the Ferry Building.  First, those chips are amazing - they are freshly made daily.  The waitress gave us a good education about the ins & outs of Peruvian food.  We tried the samplers and had the steak as a main entree.  The highlight for me was the octopus on a skewer.  Wow!  All were just fine.  We also had Pisco Sours and a \"madaline?\" and I was happy with them.  They only disappointment was Tres Leches dessert - it was not impressive.  I had the Tres Leches at the Peruvian place on Fillmore in Pac Heights last week and it was in a whole different league.

Since there were a few of us, we were able to order the sample cebiche as well as the sample empanadas.  The cebiche consisted of 4 different types of fish (halibut, ahi, bass and one other) marinated different styles and it was quite tasty.  The empanada sampler consisted of 4 small empanadas, similar to the size of a fried dumpling.  Again, very tasty, $18 is too much for the portion.  My entree was exceptionally tasty- the arroz jugoso.  The seafood was so fresh and it is cooked in the clay dish, similar to a cippino sauce.  I think I had the best dish out of the group of friends.  The friends ordered the lomo saltado which is like beef tenderloin simmered with french fries.  Although I didn't taste the dish, they seemed to enjoy it.  All in all, I would definitely go back and order the arroz jugoso again.  I hear they have happy hour where the appetizers are much cheaper so that's probably a better deal.

I have to admit the menu looked amazing, there was a dictionary page to help the customer understand the different dishes which helped out tremendously. The drinks were delicious and very potent... I ordered Pisco Sour, Chucha tu Ma, and about 2 more ... I was going down the list, I was in liquor heaven. We then moved on to the appetizers, which were very small but delicious. We started off with the Cebiche Tasting platter, I have to admit it was excellent BUT SMALL... not enought for 6 people. We moved on to the Anticucho, delicious BUT SMALL. There were only 4 pieces, not enough for 6 people, so we all took a bite and passed it on. There were chips made of Yucca, banana and sweet potato with dipping sauces which were amazing. I've never had anything like it before. I ordered the Lomo Saltado as the entree (5 STARS) and great portion.  By the time we left (around 7:30 pm) the whole place was packed. The restaurant is located in a great location, it's very large with great views, there is parking located adjacent to the restaurant which made it very convenient.

After a day of movie watching and pupusa eating we had time to kill waiting for our ferry. We decided to look for a place near the embarcadero to have a cocktail at. I remembered that I had walked by this place at lunch on a weekday and thought, 'very pretty, must come back' so we decided to mosey up to the bar. Oh and so glad we did, we first decided to try a couple of Pisco drinks, since its the Peruvian liquor and this is a Peruvian restaurant. We had a Monje verde and a Pisco sour both were good but not great to our liking so we decided to switch to Tequila. And OMG what an extensive list of tequila do they have, they had 7 Leguas which is my recent discovery and had shots of that. The bartenders were so attentive and nice. The gave us 'leftover' pisco sours for free and let us try the chicha something other for free too, which of course they make themselves, sorry to say I didn't like it because it's infused with cloves but my cousin loved it. The bartenders simply rocked. They were so nice and chit chatted about our movie with us and were at all times anxious to get us whatever we needed.

I'm unsure about parking but we parked in a meter across the street, which was difficult to determine monitored times. Whatever, it worked...Upon walking in, it seemed like the place was filled with financial district, new money snobs. We were minutes late for our reservation and told it would be a little bit of time by the seemingly cold ladies at the host stand. We went to the bar area and the host came back and was suddenly quite friendly and informing us that our table was nearly ready. Great. The dining room is large and very, VERY pretty. I loved it. Medium brown wood floors, white trim, skylights, pretty lights, GREAT views of the water, and pops of blue everywhere. Very nice! The starter plantain chips came with a trio of sauces--one seemed like psiracha, one of cilantro and another one, which I couldn't determine the main flavor. Very good. We then got the cebiche mixo consisting of white fish, calamari, octopus, habanero, giant corn, cilantro. It was fantastic and I was happy with the assistant took the bowl away bc I kept trying to find things to drink up the broth/citrus sauce. YUM. 9/10. We then had the empanada sampler which consisted of four different flavors--steak, mushroom, seafood and chicken. By looks, the chicken would be my least favorite but it ended up the opposite. 8/10. We then had the carne skewers with fried potatoes, huge corn and sauce. YUM-O. The steak and potatoes were fantastic!! 10/10. Last, we had the lomo saltado, beef tenderloin, sauced veggies and some rice/corn with butter. While very good, I think we overdid the steak dishes at that point and were quite satisfied. Good, but I'd try another of the mains next time. 7/10. For dessert we have the orange glaze beignet with a chocolate, almost melty Nutella sauce inside and subbed out the lemongrass ice cream with the mango sorbet. YUM but again over indulgence. 8/10.

The fish was very fresh, but unfortunately, underflavored.  A good ceviche soaks in the leche de tigre, and the fish then tastes salty, sour, just like the leche.\nBut the major disappointments as in the beginning is still the service.  We went with friends, and the waitress spilled a bottle full beer which she'd just served us.  It should have been replaced (no offer) or she should have left it off the check.  No.  We had to ask her to.\nThe last time we went, we waited 15 min. before we finally signalled someone for service.  Because the 2 or 3 servers that were walking around, hadn't \"NOTICED\" us.  And the service afterwards was uneven, some dishes came fairly promptly, others no.  \nGood, attentive service has been an issue with La Mar since the beginning, and they've had enough time to get organized.

Most entrees were about $29.  I got the risotto for $19, and although it tasted very good, it really was just a plate of rice.

I found the potatoes to be a bit too sour for my taste.  Dessert was the best part.  We got the chocolate beignets.  I just realized that they were supposed to be coated with an orange flavor, but I didn't taste any orange.  They were chocolatey good though.  Also, I often judge a restaurant by their coffee.  I thought that for the prices La Mar was charging, the coffee was some of the worst--very sour/acidic and they gave me what seemed to be skim milk.

Why would I rate a star? Here it is, the use of the peruvian sauces \" Huancaina \" it gets used for everything almost, our bill came out to $135 I was surprise but I didn't mind since it is our wedding anniversary, and plus we had more plans after so I tip our server $7 dollars so as we walking out, I was confronted by our server about my tip, he demanded more money, he claimed that for the tip I left to him it is like he paid for us to sit at our table, I told him thats not right and offered to give a good comment if there was a comment box and he replied if there was one to dropped money in there instead. He was angry, disrespectful and ungrateful.

The hostess is disorganized and even when slow there's a long wait to be seated;  the waiter, while pleasant, does nothing to ensure your food is good or timely; 35 minutes for a (cold appetizer);  no one to stop by to see if your food is to your liking--which should happen at these prices--and a horrendous wait for the check until you virtually shriek for help.  Avoid it until they work out the kinks, then go back for the nice setting and the interesting menu.", "author": "lynne h."}

Sadly, each time I return the service and food become progressively disappointing. Last visit (June 2009) we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation time, with not much care from the hostesses. Then 2 of our 3 dishes came out wrong from the kitchen (that doesn't look like octopus). And everyone I know who's been there has experienced the same dish mix up. I love the decor, whether inside, outside or just at the bar, but I think the staff  has been unable to manage the large volume of diners. If you're looking for a wonderful ceviche experience, but without the bay view, try Fresca.", "author": "Tracy P."}

It starts with being told that we only had 2 hours for our reservation. It was then followed by extremely tardy service - food took extremely long to come, drinks we had to ask for 3 times. - it took over an hour to get them. The kicker was when the two hours were up and our dinner was just removed because of the poor service, our check was placed in the middle of the table without asking. We gathered telling us not-so-subtly to leave. This was before we were asked if we cared for any dessert. It was followed by the manager had asking us to leave when we requested dessert menus. While they did make good once we explained the situation, it never should have happened. On the good side the food was very good and the atmosphere was too.", "author": "Robin C."}

I was really fascinated with the color scheme in the restaurant.  Most of the walls were white and brown, but the table mats, plates and chairs were all bright, fluorescent colors, making everything stand out.  Liked the daily specials written on the chalkboard at the top of the ceviche bar.  We started off with some pisco drinks, which were both very tasty.  The plantain and potato chips and dipping sauces continued the \"colorful\" theme and were very tasty, each providing something different.  We started with the ceviche tasting.  Each had its own unique taste; I especially liked the mixto, which had the perfect blend of everything.  We also had the causa sampler, which again was very colorfully presented.  All three were very good as well, although a little salty for my taste.  Finally, we shared the arroz norteno which was out of this world!!   I could definitely have that everyday; a perfect mix of spices/herbs, seafood and rice.  We ended the meal with some very good sangria.  The setting is beautiful right on the waterfront.  My only complaint; the service was a little slow as the place got busy.  But the food is awesome.", "author": "Keith M."}

The lamb shank is just okay.  The crusted ahi tuna is amazing, the hamachi version of sashimi was skimpy and flavorless.  The atmosphere is great and it's a great place for groups.  As far as desserts go, the sorbet is fantastic, the chocolate.

All their variations are pretty amazing.  I'm a BIG fan of ceviche, both the Mexican style, chopped up with cilantro, onions, lime, etc, and the Peruvian version with the solid filet of fish and big corn.  BIG fan of both.  The stuff from La Mar is seriously in another level.  You're basically having sashimi with a Peruvian twist.  Amazing!  Nikkei is my personal favorite, but try the Cebiche Mixto on your first visit so you can pick your own reson-for-living. The grilled octopus (anticucho de pulpo) is another fenomenal dish.  Potato dishes, another winner.  The lomo saltado is just \"ok\" defintely not the reason to come here.   Stick with the seafood dishes, like all of the aforemetioned, or something like the  Arroz Norte\u00f1o (seafood rice similar to Paella) and you will no doubt be a regular here.  ...and OH, Pisco Sours are dangerously good.  I prefer mine with no egg.  Given that I'm not training for a boxing match, I order an eggless version, which the call a \"gimlet\".  Uh, ok, sure.  They can call it \"stanley\" if they want, just get a couple in front of me.", "author": "Moz R."}

As for Peruvian food, if you really never taste Peruvian food, you would know that the food had nothing of Peruvian taste!!!!!!!Very disappointing. It was all looks, no real Peruvian food. It has been prepared so different than the original recipes, that it really didn't seem to me that I was tasting  Peruvian food. Besides that the waitress was very inattentive and offer very poor service. We had to remind her so many times of what we had order........... . We waited around 35 minutes to be served, I ordered a Cusquena and the server didn't even remember that i had order it. When asked she mentioned that they were out of Cusquena's.......\nMy overall experience was disappointing, I thought I would find better food, nicer service, for that price!!!!!!

The restaurant definitely has a great vibe and the close seating encourages you to chat with fellow patrons.   We started off with tiradito chifa- very refreshing and decent sized portion of yellowtail tuna, my favorite dish by far.  Followed by empanada de choclo also tasty and anticuchos served with the red \"rocoto\" sauce (just the right amount of heat).  This sauce was amazing and we ordered more of it for our dishes that followed.  If you don't order anticuchos or ask for it you will miss out!  We then had causa de ahi also amazing, and then split the seabass which was underwhelming after all the delicious apps.  Service was friendly, and quick.  We'll be flying from SD to SF more often just to come back to La Mar.  And don't forget to order the pisco sours, by far the best pisco sours outside of Peru.", "author": "Gabriela M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-31", "description": "La Mar is the latest import from Lima, Peru offering contemporary Peruvian ceviche with local and Japanese. A very high-end take on what was historically a low-end fisherman's food, La Mar is situated on the Embaracadero waterfront in a hip, modern (and blue) space to thoroughly enjoy sipping Pisco sours while dining on fresh seafood. \n\nNow I could run  through all the items I've personally had, but to save time, I'll summaries it as follows: (1) This is obvious, but for first timers, order the cebiche tasting. You'll get 4 ceviches to try. I'm a fan of the nikei and mixto.  Additionally, if you want just the singles, I also like the crudo (the shellfish ceviche; (2) You may want to pass on the menu or just ask the server for his best suggestion. Generally, I wasn't too impressed with non-ceviche items. I suppose dishes like the camarones grillado or lamb shank were pretty good. I'd probably recommend you take this opportunity to down a few more pisco sours, to build up my courage, and order off the various specials they may have; Lastly, (3) Unless you have a Peruvian friend, it may be tough to figure out what's good/bad. So be adventurous. Or ask me and I'll refer you to one - they're such nice people and would love to try to convince you the food is appropriately priced. =) Oh, and be wary of the bar tab. It's rather easy to drop $200 on food while another $200 on pisco sours. \n\nParking, like all restaurants on the waterfront, is a drag. Be prepared to pay for $20 parking next to the restaurant (through the causeway) or on the street followed by a brisk walk. Reservations are highly recommended if you want to get out of the bar area (although you can order food at the bar as well).\n\nService is such a stickler for me. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the staff here does not seem fully up to speed on the menu (or the drinks). My Peruvian had to correct the server a couple of times during my initial visit. On subsequent visits, I've noticed servers giving contradictory information. It's a fairly new restaurant, so I'll cut them some slack, but I think this should be solved by now, no? \n\nAll in all, an upscale dining experience. A good \"take your date and impress her\" place.", "author": "George K."}

My party literally had to guide the bar service staff through each mini-step of the table service of six or seven small plates.  By the fourth plate and ware change the busser sort of had the hang of it.  Having visited Peru multiple times for month's on end I can say the dishes most closely resembling \"tipical\" were the best.  \"Causas\" are downright bad which is surprising considering how naturally tasty Peruvian yellow potatoes are.  Only the Ceviche clasico was rewarding and I found myself literally drinking the extra sauce which was complex, spicy and refreshing.  The crab stuffed empanadas with quail egg and leche de tigre were also great with the classic pastry shape and fried texture exactly like those experienced in Empanada-City B.A. (don't believe the weaker baked version touted by Chilenos).  Also remarkable; the Pulpo antichuchos.  Everything else was a redundancy and dissapointing.  The exterior of the restaurant, waterside, fits perfectly with the Embarcadero's brass and concret.  As the moon rose above the Pier in the purple dusk light and oily boat swells lapped the pylons I felt another Cusqueno backed by another Sour were in order.

It's close to our condo, we've been watching the build-out of this beautiful location, and we love cebiche. However, although the cebiche is pretty good, it's just not great. I've had much better at many seafood stands and restaurants in Mexico and Costa Rica and at far less than half the price. I know my ceviche and  make a much better version myself frankly.\nAs far as experience, we received a call yesterday morning at 9, warning us that they were 100% booked and that if we were 15 minutes late, we'd lose our reservation. This was a pre-theatre reservation, which I related to the hostess, letting her know we'd be on time and would not linger as I thought this would be useful to their table planning on a busy night. We arrived at 5:15 and checked in before heading for the bar (we knew they wouldn't start serving until 5:30 but that the bar was open). Good pisco sours. Then another. Still no table until 5:50, so much for timing. The hostesses and bartenders, and the wait and table staff couldn't have been nicer, though the waiter was a bit verbose (to his credit though, many people may not know about Peruvian food, and he was just very thorough with his explanations and likes-and-dislikes). \nFood portions are very small for the price... and the cebiches have very few pieces of fish. Also, the beef dish is really good but again, not much steak in the portion. The braised lamb shank was a normal-sized portion, but really really mushy and not that flavorful (yes, it's braised, but nothing was done to make it savory, just a dash of broiling or glazing after the braise would have done wonders). I had starters for dinner and the octopus skewers and empanadas were the best things our party of 4 ordered. We had the creme brulee taster for dessert, it was okay.\nThey've got a good/reasonable wine list with some of our favorite Malbecs and Chards, some which we've only found in Argentina. \nThe room is beautiful, though they could use some art on the walls. \nBottom line, the food was good but not that great. I think food-wise, Limon is better unless all you're after is ceviche, really small portions of very watery ceviche.  This will be a go-to place for us for a drink and appetizer, especially next spring once the deck opens up, but won't be rushing there for dinner.", "author": "Rose A."}

I heard the food was a bit overpriced, but that it was a good place to grab a drink before dinner.  Unfortunately, I may have received some bad advice as the bar is actually just a tiny room facing the street instead of the water.  The bar room was packed at 6pm although the ceviche bar and dining area were pretty empty.  Since there was not a single place to sit, I asked the hostess if we could order a drink and sit in the ceviche bar/lounge area which was huge and empty.  She said that she could only sit us there if we were having food.  So we stood in a corner next to where they pile glasses and left as soon as we finished one pisco sour.

Now I have a completely different view of La Mar and will not be back.  They make you go through their event planner and pick a set menu for parties of 8 or more.  That's expected for parties of 12, 15, 20 but since when is 8 a large party?  Think it's a tactic to mark up their prices.  In addition, their event planner, Mayra, is mean and unhelpful.  And they make you sit in their lounge, which is a table near the bar that has no view.  We could have been in an airport restaurant.  I'd think a restaurant that gets a party of 8 on a slow night would give at least good service but we actually got worse service than if we'd been a party of 3.
