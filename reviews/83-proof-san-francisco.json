My friend and I weren't sure what we felt like drinking, so he asked us a bunch of questions on what we liked and concocted two different cocktails for each of us. My friend had an egg white with gin and cracked pepper (a lot more I can't even name) and I had a refreshing gin cocktail with cucumber. We loved our first drink so much we stayed for a second, which he again, made on a whim and we were watching him make each one with love and care. The second round was also delicious, my friend having another vodka/rum cocktail with this caraway flavor (amazing) and mine was a peachy/refreshing drink. Must say this was one of the few times I was so impressed with the bartender and his level of interest in his customers and mastery of bartending. Highly recommend if you're looking to talk to some friends and have some quality drinks.", "author": "Alice K."}

But that's something that I love about it! I pass by it almost everyday on the way to grab lunch and I didn't even know it was a bar until some friends I met there for happy hour drinks one day.\n\nIn terms of happy hour, I'd say 83 Proof is one of my favorites in the area for cheap drinks and fast service. My go-to well drink is a gin & tonic and I got 2 for $10 (because their credit card minimum is $10). Hey, not complaining about that at all! \n\nThe beers are also generous portions and my friends enjoyed theirs. We came on a Thursday early evening and it wasn't too crowded although the bar was definitely lively. It wasn't too loud either so you could have a conversation without screaming at each other.\n\nThe only thing is that the space is a little small so I'm sure it could get stuffy on days/times that are more popular for drinking. Definitely an amazing happy hour spot though. I can't wait to come back!", "author": "Christine W."}

Yet he made it with bourbon...usually fine as the two are often interchanged, but the final product was sadly watered down even from the very first sip.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, definitely try and find a spot upstairs as the main bar is very busy and noisy enough to almost have to shout to have a conversation.\n\nFor the atmosphere and price point, I have to be completely honest and say that there are better options in the area.", "author": "Eric F."}

My friend's Bourbon was smooth as ice.

The typical crowd is in their late 20s to late 30s of professionals from the financial district. There's 2 TV's to watch ball games (or whatever) and a well stocked bar with an excellent whiskey selection (almost entirely from America). \n\nI've come here several times in the past and had good experiences until now. Typically, the bartenders are pretty personable and well skilled. Unfortunately, this time I was served by a bartender that practically treated me like I was in a dive bar. Not that there's anything wrong with dives but we, as patrons, pay a premium to go to nicer bars with better service.\n\nFirst off, this dude gave me some attitude when I couldn't hear what he was saying (it's pretty loud inside). Secondly, he scoffed a little at my typical one-off drink- Sazerac, half cognac, half rye. I've never been rude to a bartender before but he was kind of pushing it. I mean.. I'm ordering a solid whiskey drink with a unique twist. Don't knock it til you try it bruh. \n\nMy reasoning behind giving this usually 4 establishment 2 stars is that I could go to one of the other dozen bars plus in the area.

This is what happened, but it apparently violates Yelp policy to punish a business for their Yelp info being incorrect. That actually seems fair, in general, because these mistakes happen. Except that 83 Proof's Yelp hours match their website, so they're not incorrect on Yelp. And neither their Facebook page nor their Twitter mentioned this closure. \n\nFine, maybe that review wasn't fair and Yelp was within their rights to remove it, so I'll leave a less emotional, more balanced review in hopes that it'll be allowed to stand:\n\nFirst off, I've been here before and the bartenders are great. So great that I've brought at least 15 people here who'd never heard of it, and all of them loved it. My favorite part of coming here is that you can chat with a bartender about what you like, and they'll make a very thoughtful suggestion. It's nice if you don't know your way around a cocktail bar. Then they'll make the drink, and make it very well. The atmosphere is nice too.\n\nNow that I've been fair and said what is good, I'll express annoyance at a business practice of theirs: closing for private events. This bar will be closed sometimes because they rent themselves out for private events. Obviously this is their prerogative, but I, personally, don't want to patronize a business that does this because I don't want to have to check their Facebook and Twitter every time I plan to visit.

They simply asked if we were feeling like having \"strong & boozy\" or \"light & citrus-y\" drinks and off they went!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-27", "description": "From the look of it, 83 Proof is just another FiDi bar watering hole for the after work crowd. But upon closer inspection, it isn't just that, it offers a little more, and can be a later night drop in joint, especially if you like creative drinks and personal service. \n\nThey have a huge collection of spirits on the wall behind the bar. If it isn't too crowded and crazy, you can talk to the bartenders and tell them what kind of things you like as far as taste, and then they will concoct a special drink to match your taste. \n\nSo it is sort of like Omakase Sushi meets FiDi Spirits Mixologist. Like in Omakase sushi, you trust the sushi chef to prepare something delectable, and the same goes here. The bartenders are very knowledgable and customize your drink.\n\nThis is great for the SF drinking crowd of today, many of which are self proclaimed foodies who desire a personalized custom experience with their food and their drinks, and because the trend is you have to try special drink concoctions like you have to try specially prepared dishes. Only difference here is there isn't necessarily  a Pris Fixed tasting menu here like your foodie chic resto. Maybe that is the next trend?\n\nI found that this trend is popular especially with the young ladies, so that they have ample fodder to share on FB to their friends to show they have discerning taste and know how to get around town and have a good time. And of course, where the ladies go, the men will follow, so this place should keep doing well, despite being inauspicious from the street in signage and detail. \n\n83 proof is known by the Dot Com techy types that now populate a large part of FiDi and who replaced the Insurance and Financial suits in many places, so the vibe is a little more casual then 25 years ago when 3 piece Suits and 3 martini expense account lunches predominated, especially the later in the evening you drop in. \n\nThey are well known for their Basil Gimlet, but don't stop there on your Social Lubrication Safari. \n\nTry an Omakase with the sushi chef, er I mean, Personalized Spirit with your Spirits Mixologist.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

I'm often in this neighborhood and always looking for good bars. I pulled up yelp and was surprised to have never found this spot before. \n\nAfter walking in and noticing no sign outside, and a nice dark interior I was taken aback by the selection of whiskey especially bourbon, this was a winner. We started off with a couple beers, they have some good options on tap. I had some type of tasty Pilsner, but I forget the brand. \n\nWhile we were putting back our second beer I noticed the bartender making some very interesting bourbon based concoction, and began asking questions about it. It had a name, which eludes me, but it had some type of blood orange liquor, bitters, something else bitter, and bourbon with a lemon peel in it. It was an interesting and tasty cocktail.

Somewhat of a challenge finding it since their sign isn't very big, so unfortunately my group and I passed it while looking for it, but noticed quickly and came back.

Just what we were looking for!\n\nThe bartender was extremely friendly, made us some tasty beverages, and even talked to us for a little bit since we mentioned we were all relatively new to the area. They also have a wheelchair accessible bar counter at the end of the bar, which was really awesome considering our friend was in one. They have a full bar, great beer on tap, and I would highly recommend trying out their blackberry whiskey sour. Unique and delicious!

They make excellent and strong cocktails and are always friendly. \n\nAll the drinks are reasonably priced and the whiskey selection is out of this world. In addition to their fantastic old fashioned cocktail, I always have an Old Speckled Hen beer with an Old Potrero. \n\nOverall a great place to grab a stiff, hand crafted cocktail at a reasonable price.", "author": "Matt J."}

I went by Thursday night around 8, and it was easy to get a seat at the bar, though it did get a bit more crowded by 9. The bartenders were what made they experience; they were friendly, responsive, and full of recommendations. I had a basil gimlet and something similar made with lemon, honey, and gin. Both were phenomenal. They actually don't have a cocktail menu but make you something based on your preferences. I will definitely return, thanks for such a fun time!", "author": "Sydney L."}

I mean, if I ever come back to 83 Proof a nice rack and a vagina are the only things that are gonna help me get a damn beer in under 10 minutes. What? I could skip the procedures and just not come back? Well I guess that could work too.. *cancels newly booked surgeries*\n\nSeriously you broseph bartenders, I know you saw me. You walked over twice to shuffle around some dirty glasses, then went right back to the same two giggly chicks. They had drinks already. Which they were drinking. You can get me a beer and THEN go back to flexing your biceps oh so obviously while crossing your arms across your chest. Or maybe some slicked back hair, a striped button up shirt, and some BMW car keys conveniently placed on the bar for all to see might work?\n\nDamn shame too, I really liked the whole setup. Dimly lit, very nice lounge feel upstairs looking down on the bar. Decent beer selection too once I got one. Finally, thank the lord and his unicorns a third bartender or possibly manager showed up and I gave him the \"what the fuck dude\" look and he jumped into action and was quite polite. Too bad I'd been standing there forever already.\n\nI could possibly be back some day if people make me come here, I'm just going to ask a female sidekick to snag the drinks.

I am not sure if they do table service but it is fit for it.. All the yelpers were in that area which made it easy to mingle!  It overlooked the rest of the bar.

I really enjoyed the vibe of the place as well as the crowd that it attracted- mostly young working professionals. We had the pleasure of getting our drinks from a bartender, i think his name was Mark- he was AWESOME. He was more so a mixologist rather than a bartender though, he mixed us some of the most amazing drinks I've had just based on us telling him what we liked. I normally don't like fruity drinks, but he made the most amazing drink for me with raspberry, vodka, egg whites, and some other ingredients that I didn't quite catch. \n\nOverall a very talented bar staff, and a great place to unwind after a day's work.", "author": "lauren j."}

First, this is a sort of ugly section of 1st Street in a spot of the city that I find a little iffy to begin with. The door is also hard to find (that can be cool if you're going for the hidden club feel, but here it was just annoying). Inside you find a pretty average sort of tiny bar.  The chandelier and the balcony are a nice touch but overall I wasn't sure what this bar was going for.  Dive bar? Cocktail lounge?  I don't know. It got average looking bar down though.\n\nThe other thing was that something about the acoustics of this place just felt off too me.  There weren't that many people but it still felt too loud somehow.  \n\nMaybe I expected too much or came on the wrong night or just wasn't into it.\n\nOh, the drinks were okay though.  I just had a beer because I had to \nwork the next day.\n\nIt didn't do it for me.

It was a crowded, hot, sweaty, fancy drink and fine scotch sort of event, at a bar that was able to maintain its classy Fidi ambiance by throwing us degenerates into the mezzanine upstairs (which you can reserve no matter what your drinking habits, and which comes in handy between the hours of 5-8 when this place is so packed you can hardly lift your glass to your mouth). \n\nIf 83 Proof can handle us then they definitely get a thumbs up from me.

They also gave us a tall table toward the back to put some snacks on. I was appreciative they gave us these options with no problems and were really helpful setting up.\n\nOriginally a DJ was provided for the night, but two days before they called and canceled that. It was a little frustrating, but luckily we had a friend that agreed to set up that night and used the upstairs balcony area which was perfect! As long as the minimum is met you don't have to pay anything extra except for a tip if you decide to. So essentially you get the bar and service for free which is great. \n\nI would highly recommend 83 Proof for any bash you want to throw. The interior is clean, with comfy couches and nice tables along the wall. Great service and not too high of a minimum so its doable with a big group of friends... and what a motley crew we had!", "author": "Natalie N."}

Finally I spot the glow of lights coming from 83 Proof and I run across the street. And boy was I shocked as to what I found!!!! \n\n83 Proof is honestly one of the coolest bars I have ever been to. AMAZING selection at the bar. One of my friends is actually a bartender and he was astonished at both the selection and the care the bartenders had when mixing their drinks.

I've ended up talking to Sky the last couple of times I've been here -- youngish bartender, fully tatooed arms -- and just started telling him to make me something random.  This evening I got a pisco-campari-lime cocktail and a jalepeno-lemon-rum cocktail.   Both were super-interesting and well balanced.  There is no menu and no names for them since they like improvising for what each customer wants.  The decor is classy but understated (in a good way).  There is often a piano player, which is also awesome.\n\nThe one problem with 83 proof is its own success: it gets crazy crowded and loud from the FiDi happy hour set.

And it was only $8.  Which may seem expensive to some (cheap asses), but for the amount that went in and the location of the bar, it was extremely reasonable.  Suffice it to say that I switched to some rum lime rickey/fizz thing later, because I wanted to avoid any major embarassment (although I was a champ at the minor).\n\nI love love love the decor of this place, and their booze selection wows even me (when you work at a casino, you see more booze than you ever thought possible).  There were also some really hot guys there who somehow failed to notice my super hot red shoes.  How, I don't know, but when I'm in the mood for some banker love, I'm coming here.\n\nNext time I'm taking over the upstairs, though.

Ah, the dear Sky. Who doesnt' love him? The pretty boy-next-door type and one of the nicest people you'll ever met. turns out Sky is in fact straight because yes, some drunk girl asked.

Definitely a place to check out with a small group of friends or on a date...it's low key enough that you can hold a conversation without yelling over the crowd and/or music.", "author": "Melanie N."}

You give them a liquor, any liquor, and they make a drink.  You might get something tasty and you might get something that makes you throw up in your mouth. If you say you'd like something with gin in it they will offer several kinds of gin and make you something tasty.  However, if you say you'd like to try a drink with butterscotch rum you'll probably end up with something that tastes like cough syrup and bitters.

Bright, classy (maybe a bit art deco?), with a kind of balcony level with seating overlooking the bar.  We ordered Manhattans to start -- and wow!  Not only were they fantastic, but we caught the bartender furtively watching to see how we reacted to our first sips, and he gave us a questioning look until we gave him the thumbs up, which made him smile.  Yay for bartenders who care whether people like their drinks, even on a super-busy Friday night!\n\nI can't remember everything I had or tried there, but I do remember being particularly impressed by the mojitos, and I have rather a high bar for mojitos.  A perfect balance of rum, sugar, lime, and super-fresh mint.  It was so good I had another. :)\n\nWe went again a few months later -- the mojitos were still super tasty, and when I was feeling uninspired by my usual go-to cocktails, the bartender was happy to take a stab at making me something fun and tasty based on a few well-chosen questions about my cocktail / spirits preferences.\n\nBig fan.

But instead of expecting to pay an arm and a leg, the drinks are reasonably priced and reasonably potent.\n\nThe fact that the owners are bartenders make them even more dedicated to their drinks and their customers. Last night, my roommate and I stopped by in order to just grab a quick drink before heading to another party. They had two large parties and the place was packed. Even with so much business, The bartenders took the time to talk to their regulars between orders.\n\nThanks for making me feel at home, guys.", "author": "Abhay K."}

I know I definitely had a great time because time passed super quick -- or maybe that was a result of the good drinks?  ;)\n\nI will start off by saying our experience was made really great by the fact that we chose to go on a Saturday and it was much, much less crowded than a weekday evening. My group of 40 pretty much had the place to ourselves for about half of the night.\n\nWhy did we love this place?\n\n1. Bartenders -- the two guys on duty that night were awesome! Super friendly! They made us some fantastic drinks, including Manhattans that matched up to Bourbon and Branch and also coming up with a twist on a Kamikaze that almost everyone ended up ordering throughout the night!\n\n2. Ambiance -- the high ceilings make the place feel bigger than it is. Most of all, I love how it's not pretentious, but still really modern. I feel at home here! Smaller groups will appreciate the loft seating upstairs -- it seats about 12-15 people.\n\n3. Prices -- even without the weekday happy hour specials, my bar tab was super reasonable. And it's not like the drinks are watered down. My Manhattans were STRONG! It's nice to be at a placle that isn't looking to gouge customers. \n\nI'll be looking to come back here again very soon!", "author": "Mel M."}

(i think that was the name of it) It was the type of bar you would try to walk past really fast if not cross over to the other side of the street. But.. now, the neew owners have done a really great job at opening making the space warm and welcome. I love that it's a block away from where I work, and that it is part of the new 2nd-1st street triangle. I love it... Working at Kates, it's always great when new bars open cause it brings more people into the neighborhood. And this area is fast becoming the new bar hopping mecca. I say NEW cause we all already know about the Mission, and North Beach (before it became ghetto fab), and \"sigh\" yes, the Marina. \nNow... for happy hour or after dinner you can go to John Colins, Zebulon, 83 Proof, Harlot, Rickenbacher, Steffs, Kates... etc :) \nAnyways... enough blabbering and back to 83.

Walking in, the space is very high, with some classic gilt chandeliers and matching wall lamps.  As others have mentioned, it's a nearly perfect amount of lighting - not too bright, not too dark - for a comfortable, relaxed, classy bar.  Only the 2 flat-screen TVs in front detract from the ambiance.  Everything's a shade of brown or tan, and a bar nearly the length of the room fills one wall, fronting an enchantingly large selection of top-shelf beverages, and a reasonable beer selection too.  \nClearly, the bartenders here enjoy their alcohol, and being prepared to make anything you could think of.\nNot only that, but they're expert at it!  I can personally attest to an extremely well made Manhattan (in the old style, with both sweet & dry vermouth, and a twist as well as 2 real cherries) and Mojito, and a well made Old Fashioned (I would have gone with less fruit).  The 'tenders are also very friendly, proud of their mixology, and want to make sure you enjoy their creations.  I was pleasantly surprised when they checked to make sure the Manhattan and Old Fashioned were to my liking.  That's class, folks, and I love it.  Prices are shockingly reasonable too, especially considering the amount of TLC that goes into making those drinks.\n\nThere's also a balcony in back with a great view of the bar and a bunch of couches for more relaxed drinking.

Love the clean swanky decor. You can tell that the crowd that night were regulars, but the tattooed bartender broke away from conversation right away to greet us warmly and serve us newbies a drink.  I will definitely go back.  My only regret is the TV in the corner playing  sports.  I felt it took away from the atmosphere and opportunities to have great conversations with some of the amazing people in the room.", "author": "Lisa R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-11", "description": "Just Eh... we went here on the friday night of opening week around 5:30 PM.  You would think, hey, opening week, let's try to impress -  but, no, all they were striving for was a whole lot of MEDICROTY...drink \"specials\" included $5 semi-weak coctails (read: mostly ice and mixer in small glasses)  $4 beer on tap is okay, but they had a very small selection.  The decor was nothing to write home about either.  The place is small to medium sized, and there are tables, but by the time we got there at 5:30 it was 75% full and standing room only - to be honest, though, I think once the hype of the \"newness\" dies down and the reality of mediocrity sets in, you'll be able to get a seat.   On the plus side, there is a large window in the front that opens with a few tables in front for those rare warm SF nights.  There is also a cute little loft section above which would be great for a group of 15 or so if you get claim it early enough; it would be even better if they had a  little bar up there, but you can't have everything I guess.  Really, I'd give this place a 2.5 star rating if it was possible.  If you have the choice, I'd say avoid this place since there are a lot of better bars that are pretty close by.", "author": "Simmi M."}

One of the owners, Sky (Skye?) was really nice. I sat w/ a guy and we commented on the scenery/wildlife and had a drink together.  Reasonably priced, not a very intriguing beer selection for a beer drinker like me but I had a Chamuco tequila and sipped it and just took it all in.  I used to come here back in the day when it was the Leopard.  It has high ceiling now, knocked the false ceiling out.  Could use some artwork on the walls...maybe a flatscreen so I can watch some basketball.  But overall happy to see this location in action again and kudos to the ownership for opening a hopping new downtown watering hole that is pretty much no frills but w/ premium booze and already packing them in two or three weeks after opening (...not at all unusual for SF, everyone wants to go to the new \"hot spot\")\nI shall return!", "author": "Tom M."}

Decor is nice, not pretentious. It's one long bar and tables on the right. It has a good amount of people and it's definitely lively but yet I don't have to scream to hear my friends talk. They also have a comfy looking loft area to lounge if you go early enough to snatch it up. The drinks are delicious and strong. Not too sweet. I went for the highly recommended basil gimlet by fellow yelpers and also the cucumber  gimlet too. I like both! Two was all it took for the perfect buzz for the rest of the night.

Drafts were cheap (I paid $3 for a Hefeweizen) but all the other drinks were regular price (~8 for a martini).  The bartenders were all very nice and attentive.

It was kind of early (9:30) and it was still really quiet in here.  Thankfully, this allowed us to spend some time chatting with the mix-masters about their kick-ass booze selection and cool accessories such as a glass \"Absinthe Fountain\" used during the consumption of absinthe in the traditional manner (a.k.a. \"the cool heroin-like way\").  Someone in our group tried the house specialty \"Cucumber Gimlet\" - which was awesome.  And by the time we finished our first round, more people started to trickle in.  Ended up being a pretty chill evening at the bar (still plenty of standing room) but apparently it can get quite crowded here during weekday happy hour and some Saturday nights.
