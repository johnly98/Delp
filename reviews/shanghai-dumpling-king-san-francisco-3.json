This location is noisy because of the low ceilings, the other location had real high ceilings so the sound didn't seem as bad. Okay here's the good and not so good's, this restaurant still has XLB on the menu but the number is less, the skin is still pretty good but the stuffing is different, it does not seem to have as much vegetables in the mixture. The vinegar is different, the vinegar they use is a milder vinegar and it's a little sweeter. We also ordered the won ton soup, it's rather generic with no greens or vegetables in it. Also ordered was the pea shoots. It's woked with garlic and the nice thing about this dish is they did not add a lot of salt so you can season it to your own liking.

But this time, it was just abysmal and that was pretty sad to see.\n\nWe began our meal with the green onion pancake. Instead of being multi-layered with just a bit of elasticity in the bite, it was as crisp as a cracker and dry. It also had a really weird aftertaste. It's never a good sign when you crave green onion pancakes from the frozen aisle over this version. Next up was the dumplings in seafood soup. This was actually pretty decent - shrimp, calamari, bamboo shoots, shitake mushrooms and a fair number of dumplings made up this soup.\n\nNext came the dan dan noodles which were an absolute travesty. The noodles were so thin and essentially weighted down by the sauce which didn't impart the delicious spicy/nutty flavors that you would expect. Overall, the dish was just gummy and not appealing. As for the stir-fried rice cakes, there wasn't enough oil in my opinion. The rice cakes suck together in towers. Also, instead of using napa, they used green cabbage which definitely made a difference as well.\n\nLuckily, our last two dishes did provide a bit of redemption. The XLB was still good and the potstickers were also pretty decent in my opinion.\n\nI almost feel like it'll have to be a pretty dire day before I choose to return any time soon.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-11", "description": "We came here to grab a quick bite before heading off to the airport and back east. Although we wanted to go to our long-time favorite (Kingdom of Dumpling), it opened a little later and would have made it tough for us - so we decided to check out a new spot instead. We got here about 10 minutes after opening time on Sunday morning, and getting a seat was a cinch - there were maybe 5 other tables taken at most. The interior decor isn't anything to write home about, but at the least it doesn't feel as cramped as many a Chinese restaurant that might have a hole-in-the-wall feel to it do. Service was what I would expect - not too personable, but with quick delivery of food - so that was a-okay by me.\n\nThat said, even though this too is a restaurant that claims to be dumpling royalty, I was not as blown away by the Chinese food here as I have been elsewhere in SF. The soup dumplings, while sizable and having skin that holds together well, has broth that is a bit on the sweeter side, as well as pork that was a bit too soft to my liking. The skin was also on the thicker side, and there was less soup in the dumplings than I had expected. The lion's head meatballs - which were listed as a 'casserole' on the menu but came served in a giant pot that more closely-resembled soup - was a bit better, although it also had pork that almost had an undercooked texture to it (even though the flavor was fine). That said, I did enjoy the warmth of the broth, but there were too few noodles and a lot of filler (namely cabbage) floating around in it. The vermicelli noodles were probably the only dish that I enjoyed - it had a little bit of heat to it, and although it was vegetarian, it was nice and refreshing compared to much of the other items we had. The only other dumpling course we got were the spicy wontons, and I'm not quite sure what the preparation was based on...it had a heavily peanut-based sauce that made it taste more like Thai / South Asian, and the wonton skin was very thick (perhaps overcooked) relative to the vast majority of wontons (standalone, in soup, or otherwise) that I have had.\n\nEverything here just kind of checks off the box, but when it came to execution, I didn't really think that this self-proclaimed dumpling king did the dumplings - or any of our other food - particularly well. I might go back to try out some other items (it's a big menu, and perhaps we didn't pick well), but given the large selection of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, I would probably check out somewhere else first - or go back to Chinese restaurants I have been to that I know will be very good.", "author": "Asuka N."}

When she told me about Shanghai Dumpling King, she was super excited and told me I have to go here. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went this past weekend for an early anniversary date. We had trouble finding parking but eventually parked in a one-hour parking limit zone. We came around the time the restaurant opened for dinner time so we were able to get seated immediately and it was not packed.  \n\nWe ordered only dumplings:\n(#4) Shanghai Steamed Dumpling - $7.95\n(#5) Hung Zhou Crab and Pork Steamed Dumpling - $9.95\n(#18) Spicy Chives and Shrimp Dumpling - $10.95\n\nThe Shanghai dumpling and the Hung Zhou dumpling are both soup dumplings. My boyfriend and I felt that the soup in the Shanghai dumpling was better than the other one (although both very delicious). The meat was very savoury. It was so good we decided to get another order of the Shanghai dumplings. \n\nThe spicy shrimp dumpling was delicious as well. I'm not the type of person who can really handle spice, but these dumplings were at the perfect level for me. It wasn't too spicy where you focused more on the heat and getting water. The spice added just the right amount of kick and flavour to the dumplings. Plus, I am a huge fan of shrimp. If you prefer to have more spice, you can request that. \n\nThe man who served us suggested us many things to help us make our choices when we were deciding what to order. When I went to the bathroom, I noticed someone vandalized the mirror to say \"worst customer service\" which made me kinda sad since the employees were friendly and were never an issue from my personal experience. \n\nI am surprised that the other location closed and that there aren't more positive reviews for this location. Although it is kind of pricey for dumplings, I definitely feel like it was worth it. On the car ride home, my boyfriend couldn't stop obsessing over the dumplings and was so happy that I took him there!

I came with a group of three other friends and we were in the neighborhood, craving XLB and rice cakes. We were seated immediately by the friendly servers. From my experience the food could have been better. The soup in the XLB was lacking, and if you know XLB, soup makes the dumpling amaaaazing. Not all dumplings had soup, so they def missed their mark last night. We ordered pork XLB and crab. I liked the crab a lot more than the pork, but the pork filled me up. The crab was more flavorful and filling than the pork. We also tried their spicy bacon rice cakes which was a special on the whiteboard. My friends and I were confused why they used bacon considering not a lot of chinese dishes include bacon... but we tried it anyway. The spice level was good and the dish was well seasoned, it was a little too salty for me though.

The skin looked a little thick, but it was actually not too bad. The xlbs were the only things I really enjoyed. The chili wontons were laying over mixture of a spicy sauce and peanut sauce or sesame sauce. I didn't really like how it tasted.. too peanut-y for me. I was hoping for something more spicy.

When we walked in, my husband was excited based on the mixed makeup of the people eating at 12:30 on a Saturday. There were Chinese families both speaking Cantonese and not, as well as non-Asians. The lack of decor, variety of simple tables, and Costco fold up chairs at some of the tables added to his excitement because he thought it meant they focused more on the food than how the place looked. He was right! The Spicy Won Ton was my favorite with the peanut sauce and hot oil. The Green Onion Pancake was really good dipped in the peanut sauce. The pancake wasn't too thick or thin and had a good semi flaky texture. It wasn't dense. Steve enjoyed the Shanghai Xiao Long Bao Dumplings with the soup inside and we both liked the Spicy Chives and Shrimp Dumplings. The spicy hot oil was tasty and the filling was very flavorful. We didn't care for their Hot & Sour Soup because it was too thin and lacked a certain something in the usual complex flavor of the soup but it didn't taste bad. They get 4 stars for food and service. We were immediately greeted when we stepped into the restaurant and they brought us water when asked which gets them extra stars as a Chinese restaurant. Our server entertained my husband's Cantonese so that's a plus. The women's restroom was also clean and well stocked and there was lots of street parking. We will be back to try other dishes.

My first time there for a sit-down experience, I noticed that one half of the restaurant had a long line for UberEats drivers to hang out and a stack of dumpling orders in to go boxes waiting to be delivered. Since they have partnered up with UberEats and Caviar, their website actually has a very nice menu layout where you can see the prices and pictures of each item. Much more useful in helping me determine what to order if I can see what it will look like.\n\nMy favorites are the spicy wontons. If you're getting their spicy wonton or their spicy dumplings, you don't need to dip it in any additional soy sauce or dipping sauce. Why? Because the dumplings are already SAUCY. They're so saucy that they're straight up sassing you in the face. \n\nSPICY WONTON\nExtra saucy. A spicy sauce with a deep peanut sauce taste embedded. Wrapped in thin wonton skin. Could probably eat two orders of this.\n\nSPICY CHIVES AND PORK DUMPLING\nWrapped in a thicker dumpling skin.

Overall it's our first trip to the West Coast and first time going to California as a whole so I guess we took full advantage of it! In the simplistic of terms it's more about quality than quantity! I say this because when u order a specific dish they really don't give u that much but that's okay because it's better for them to give u a small amount than in one huge enormous dish when you would think that you won't be able to finish it! So what my family did when we went here we order 2 of those small dishes instead of 1 cuz we knew they wouldn't give us one big dish in case we couldn't finish it!

The service is always friendly and unless they're hosting some sort of huge event, it can be pretty fast to get a table. The stand out items are the shanghai style Stirfried noodles, the chicken fried rice, the XLB, the spicy wontons, and the garlic pea shoots.  It's really hard to find a dish that doesn't just knock your socks off. All of the dumplings are great and their noodles are really good too. \n\nI've only ever had one dish there that was bad and that was the Dan Dan noodles. I ordered them a long time ago and forgot how much I didn't like them and then made the mistake of ordering them again tonight. In an effort to try to be tactful in my description let's just say that if you Google what Dan Dan noodles look like and see the minced meat topping that comes over the noodles and imagine if you were dining with a child, what the child might say that topping looks like... Do you get my drift? Well let's just say that it smells like that too...the noodles also have a strange smell and an unappealing texture and flavor. The stir fried rice cakes were also kind of a fail, it was too much rice cake and not enough of anything else (sauce, mix-ins)", "author": "Emma H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-29", "description": "Here is an extremely honest review. I hate to have to give these guys 2 stars but this is why I am.\n\nThe prices are overinflated to an unacceptable level. $10 for pea shoots, which are good, but a smallish portion, is not cool. They are delicious, but that only goes so far. \n\n$10 for \"special shrimp chive dumplings\". Once again, this is not ok. They're tasty, but the ones at Dragon Beaux (a 5-star dim sum experience) are much better, and, unbelievably, cheaper. WAY overpriced here for a handful of dumplings made from Restaurant Depot ingredients.\n\nBut here's the real kicker, and it's tempting to give an honest 1-star review for this- the hot and sour soup. I've eaten at this place at least half a dozen times because of convenience and the tasty aforementioned pea shoots and shrimp dumplings (despite the unfairly high prices of those items) and I've never had better than a semi-decent hot and sour soup. But today's soup is so insultingly unacceptable it actually hurts my feelings.\n\nIt's obscenely vinegar-y and otherwise as flavorless as you could possibly make a soup. It doesn't just taste like, but rather IS A FACT that they just threw water, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, and canned bamboo shoots in a pot with some egg beaten in and a few chunks of tofu. It honestly tastes HORRIBLE, too horrible to eat. It's sour, bland, and probably the most disappointing thing I've ever gotten from a restaurant aside from something that's given me food poisoning. \n\nI just gave these guys $45 for a walk-in take-out order (because I tipped $4 to be nice) and got what amounts to two appetizers and a terrible soup. \n\nI'm changing the rating to one star honestly. This is so disappointing.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is nobody should ever serve a fake soup that's this shitty, and if you do, there's going to be consequences, which in this case is my honest, heavy-hearted 1-star review.", "author": "Grizzle J."}

Not as good as my favorite option in the city but a very, very solid alternative for me, especially considering the closer proximity and shorter drive.\n\nBeef stew claypot - Just OK.

In the midst of deciding whether to go right or left, my friend put the pressure on me and I'm afraid I failed. We ended up here and while the food wasn't necessary inedible, it didn't quite hit the three star mark. \n\nLet's start with the Hangzhou pork and crab soup dumplings. Right when we sat down, they started giving us ginger and soy sauce so I was hyped for some dumplings already. They arrived steaming hot but when I looked inside, half the soup had already spilled out into the basket. The half I did get to eat was okay, although it had a good amount of filling. Up next was the spicy fish filet that really was more like fried orange fish filets. The dish wasn't spicy and has absolutely no peppers! We even asked if it was the right dish we ordered and the owner said yes. Lastly, got a vegetable dish and hot and sour soup. The soup didn't have any meat! So I counted that as two vegetable dishes for the day. That's supposed to be good for health and stuff right?\n\nIf you're a woman or girl, beware of the restroom.

As of now, I have yet to try a true soup-filled dumpling at this place.\n\nThe other food on the menu is mediocre at best. Most tasty option is probably the pork potstickers. I've also ordered the pan fried buns and stir fried string beans, both of which could be greatly improved - pan fried buns needed more meat and less dough; string beans were just not spicy/authentically Szechuan at all.\n\nHopefully, I'll eventually have an experience here like my roommate with deliciously soupy dumplings...", "author": "Sheila D."}

SF is 90% of the time ideal weather for steamy dumpling comfort food, and Shanghai Dumpling King hits the spot. Although the restaurant is most well known for its XLB, I much preferred everything else.\n\n(-) XLB ($7/10): Really dry and deflated... which is quite blasphemous for XLB which are supposed to be filled with broth.\n\n(++) Hung Zhou Crab & Pork Dumplings ($10/8): The highlight of the meal! Could use more crab, but the blend was quite tasty and juicy.\n\n(+/-) Beijing Style Boiled Chives Dumplings ($6.50/10): The skin is doughy and overwhelms the skimpy pork filling. I think House of Pancake and King of Doodle have better basic dumplings.\n\n(++) Spicy Wonton ($6.50/10): Very different from the traditional Taiwanese spicy wonton I was expecting. It was hardly spicy at all, instead quite peanut butter-y, which actually turned out to pair well with the meaty wonton.\n\nOverall, the dumplings were satisfying (good enough to have dumplings monotherapy for dinner!). The skins tended to be thick, and it's rather mediocre when you employ standard XLB/dumpling standards. However I do appreciate Shanghai Dumpling King for its home cooking style and associated idiosyncrasies, for better or for worse. I.e. you get interesting novelties like crab dumplings and wonton with peanut sauce, but also laughing stock matters such as dehydrated XLB and non-spicy spicy wonton.\n\nOther notes:\n*Ambiance is simple and cozy.\n*Street parking only, not too difficult compared to the rest of SF.\n*Location is a bit random in the Outer Mission.\n*Service is efficient and the food came out quickly, though it seemed lukewarm (that, or I spent too much time taking food pictures :X)", "author": "Edna C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-04", "description": "I would give 0 stars if I can. Now if someone ask me where is the worst Shanghainese/Chinese restaurant you know, it would definitely be this one. \n\nMy girlfriend and I walked into Shanghai Dumpling King thinking that this place probably specializes Shanghainese food. As a Shanghainese, I ordered 4 very Shanghainese dishes, expecting them to nail it since I thought they specialize Shanghainese food. \n\nFirst up, Shanghai drunken Chicken as appetizer. This is probably the only edible dish i ordered, which I finished 1/3 of it. Although, the taste is definitely not genuine Shanghai drunken chicken, it's still edible.\n\nSecond, Soy-brazed lion head meatballs. Oh boy... I can write an essay on how bad this tasted. To keep things short, meatballs had no flavor, super blend. It doesn't even taste like fresh meat. Meat wasn't fully grind, I literally bit onto a chunk of fat. To make matters worst, the meatballs weren't even round in shape. I took two bites hoping that something was wrong with my tastebuds on the first bite. Can't even describe how much I regret the second bite, spitted out immediately.\n\nShanghai Vegetable delight. First of all, they got 50% of the ingredients right for this dish. The vinegar taste to this dish just threw my appetite. Traditional Shanghai vegetable delight is not suppose to have vinegar taste to it, but if you're going to add vinegar to it at least make it tasty and appetizing. That vinegar taste destroyed it.\n\nLast up. The all famous shanghai Xiao long Bao. After the first 3 dishes, I was ready to get my check and leave. But seeing that every table had Xiao long Bao, I still had a slight of hope that Xiao long Bao could be the saving grace. Guess what? Not!!!!! Please please please don't say this is Shanghai Xiao long Bao. Shanghainese people love sweet taste of things, but dude Xiao long Bao is not suppose to be that sweet. That Xiao long Bao ruins the expectation of Shanghainese culture. I had freaking tears in my heart when I had Xiao long Bao taste like that.\n\nAll in all, my girl friend and I ate less than 1/4 of our food. We got the check and left in less than 15 minutes. Yes, it was that bad. We didn't even bother about the wasted food or money, we just wanted to make sure we didn't throw up. On the upside, the waiter took off the charge for lion head because I expressed how bad it tasted. Ironically, the waiter told me that they soy braised the lion head meatballs the whole day....So in my mind, I really wanted to ask if they are using fake soy sauce or what?\n\nIn summation, I rarely post things on yelp if any. But I had to do this because this restaurant literally just helped me understand a new level of bad Shanghainese/Chinese food. \n\nSome advice for owner. Please either take off the \"Shanghainese\" brand or fire your chef. Clearly, all the traditional shanghainese food I ordered tasted nothing like Shanghainese, so just call it a Chinese takeout if you specialize broccoli beef/chicken, general tso stuff.", "author": "Jimmy L."}

And with so many experts in the field residing locally, I prefer to let them decide for me. But for my money, it doesn't get much better than Shanghai Dumpling King. \n\nI was having a terrible day before I arrived to SDK. I just had the worst flight ever home from Atlanta (sitting bitch on a 5 hour flight = never again). Some jackhole called me a bitch in the crosswalk for no reason. Then I couldn't find parking at or near SDK. In other words, my fuse was LIT. Once I found parking, I debated turning around and returning home, as I was already 0 for 3. It didn't seem like a good plan to test the universe when it was so clearly working against me that day. But I'm so glad I did not! SDK really turned the day around for me. \n\nWe walked in and were sat and served on the quick, which is my favorite. I had a beer in hand in the blink of an eye, which is also my favorite. \n\nWe looked at the menu and made some fast dumpling decisions. When our server arrived to take our order, we told her what we wanted and she made some great recommendations. We ordered the wontons (which are not really a wonton), Shanghai steamed dumplings, spicy Chive and shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and veggies with tofu. Our server rubber stamped all of those wonderful choices. We were going to get the pork and Chive dumplings as well, but thank goodness she talked us out of it. Friends, it was a lot of food for two people, and we ate ALL OF IT. It was all so deliciously filling. \n\nOur selections arrived to our table faster than immediately, which we were stoked about. I ate the majority of the BBQ Pork Buns. I love the texture of those things - it's like eating a little cloud with a yummy pork surprise inside. The wontons (which are not your traditional wontons) were served in an excellent peanut sauce. Our server said everyone loved them, and you can see why- very flavorful. The shrimp and spicy Chive dumplings were excellent, and I loved the texture. SDK's namesake, the Shanghai dumpling, likewise did not disappoint, even though I will cop to eating them incorrectly. I cut it them in half, which you aren't supposed to do since the broth will spill out of the dumpling. Whoops! My only complaint was that everything was so good, I couldn't stop eating even though the dumplings were hot as balls, temperature wise.  I burnt the roof of my mouth more than once. \n\nThe prices are dirt for San Francisco. All of those delicious delectables and beers were $50 and change. At any other full service restaurant in this city, you would likely leave hungry. \n\nI was so enthused I ordered SDK for delivery last Sunday off of the OrderAhead app (less than a week after my first visit), and my order arrived quickly-still hot and delicious. \n\nThe ambiance is unremarkable. You won't care. I know I didn't. The crowd was great and relaxed. You can definitely wear your yoga pants to SDK without incident. The buzz from the SF Weekly's review has maybe died down, although I hear the SDK on Balboa usually has a long wait. \n\nI recommend the chili sauce on the table. It is not as oily as most. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. The service is warm and friendly. The dumplings are delicious. What more could you want? Yet another reason to love Glen Park.

They placed the soup on the OPPOSITE end of the turning/serving table of where the bowls were set at.. then just left it there.  So my family and I awkwardly had to move the soup bowls closer to where the soup was then had to scoop it into the bowls ourselves.  Odd.  Only experienced that when it's like a party of 2 or 3.  Not a party of 7 though.  \n\nThe order of the food that came out was also very odd.  First was the vegetables... what? And my family and I let it sit there for a good 5 minutes until a meat dish came out to compliment the vegetables.. Am I missing something or is this a new style of serving food...\n\nUgh honestly I was so upset with everything that it pretty much ruined the vibe for me and my family's meal.  We ordered about 9-10 dishes and weren't even full off of it, what the hell.  So my dad even ordered an extra chow mein to make sure everyone had an efficient amount of food in the end.  Lame. \n\nI also noticed they seemed to have focused more on their to-go meals.  It also seems they are tailoring their dishes more to their non-Asian guests.  \n\nI really hate writing bad reviews but this one was just so terrible.  Never going to return.", "author": "Tiffany Z."}

We got, of course, the dumplings.  Unfortunately I really couldn't tell you what they were since the waitress pretty much put in he order for us.

Prices were really reasonable for the amount of food as well.\n\n* SHANGHAI STEAMED DUMPLING ($6.95, 10pcs) - 4/5\nThe pork filling was tender, juicy and flavorful, but some of the dumplings were lacking in soupiness. The dumpling skin was thicker than DTF and a little mushy/doughy, but surprisingly capable of holding the dumpling together.\n\n* SPICY CHIVES & PORK DUMPLING ($6.50, 10pcs) - 4/5\nTasty filling as well and same doughy skin.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-25", "description": "This casual restaurant is a nice quiet family run place that has a really great variety of the type of Chinese food dishes I enjoy.  It was a quiet Sunday afternoon (late lunch) so the waitress had time to make recommendations based on our traditional beef chow mein order, and suggested the Shanghai styled noodles.  She also recommended the Thai ice tea.  Their waiter was quick to serve us with water, tea, and our drink orders.  We ordered the spicy chicken wings, XLB, green onion pancakes, and spicy wonton dumplings (plus she didn't judge the 2 of us for ordering so many dishes!).\n\nOur dishes:\n\nThai iced tea 3/5: Really sweet, even though I'm a sweet tooth, it was much too milky, and I could barely taste the tea.  I even avoided stirring the milk in further, but the tea was already compromised.  \n\nShanghai noodles with beef 5/5:  I expected this dish to leave the noodles basking in oil, but it was less greasy while still maintaining the flavor.  I love thick noodles and the beef was really tender and not tough or chewy.  The sauce was appropriately salty, and the spinach and lettuce really helped to mop up some of the extra sauce and balance out the savory carb-y and meat-y dish.\n\nSpicy chicken wings 3.5/5: I'm a big fan of Korean style spicy chicken wings, and this Chinese sauce was a bit thick, sort of like gelatin.  It was somewhat flavorful, but not spicy enough for my boyfriend's tastebuds, but the meat was tender, probably locked in by the jelly sauce.\n\nXLB 4.5/5: While others have complained about the thick skin, I found the skin/meat ratio to be good. I do generally enjoy a slightly chewier skin so it might just be my personal preference, so I'll just affirm that this skin was thicker than the XLBs at Koi Palace and Din Tai Fung.  The meat inside was really fresh and obviously used fresh pink meat instead of the dried out previously frozen grayer meat that you sometimes see in dumpling innards, and the soup was flavorful, so this definitely met my expectations.\n\nGreen onion pancakes 4/5: These pancakes had a unique texture, and were crispier in a more uniform way than the usual stereotypical green onion pancake.  These are more crispy without being flaky, and the batter is cooked a lot more uniformly than usual.  This was also less oily and greasy than the usual pancake, but also less doughy (and I prefer the doughier texture) and was adorned with sesame seeds on top.  I would prefer the typical green onion pancake, but this was still worth trying.\n\nSpicy wonton dumplings 4/5: This dish was again, not too spicy, but the meat was really juicy.  For those who enjoy a thinner skin that's not chewy doughy, this is the appropriate dish for you.\n\nThis was a worthwhile experience even though we'd made a trek all the way from downtown SF to satisfy our dumpling cravings so I'll be back.", "author": "Kathy T."}

We ordered the XLBs (of course), spicy wontons, dan dan mien, and spicy eggplant. The eggplant was surprisingly very good! Not too oily, but very spicy. The XLBs were juicy and flavorful - you can never go wrong. The dan dan mien was extra nutty (loaded up with peanuts) and the spicy XLBs was more on the tangier spicy than a ka-pow! hit you in the throat spicy. Needless to say, there were no leftovers.", "author": "Annie S."}

However, I must say the dumplings are good, but not as good. Maybe it's been a while since I've been to the SDK in outer richmond, but I remembers the XLBs to be a lot soupier. We ordered 2 orders at this restaurant (20 total) and none of them contained soup :(\n\nPrice wise, it's the same as the original location.

Heard it was pretty good, so why not give it a shot? The service was good, so let's just get down to the food.\n\nXiaolong Bao: Decided on this over regular dumplings. It does take some skill to make these and much like the next couple dishes, I use it to gauge how good their food is. These came out with barely any soup inside, but the flavors were there. Nothing that would get me to tell my friends about.\n\nSpicy Beef Stew Noodle: This was very much like a regular beef stew noodle at any other Chinese restaurant. I suppose I was expecting a Taiwanese version. This wasn't spicy, the noodles were on the brink of being mushy and the tendon pieces were completely stiff - they did not cook it long enough to soften it. On top of this, they didn't cut the beef across the grain, so coupling that with the short cook time, it was tough.\n\nDan Dan Noodles: Wife had this. She thought this other joint in the Sunset district was better, which I've tried before and that was just okay.\n\nBeef Chow Fun: I always order this dish whenever it's a new restaurant. This is not an easy dish to make right and shows the skill level of the cook. The cook isn't that skilled. The noodles didn't have the right brown color to indicate how much soy sauce was used. Wasn't dry enough, but rather greasy, so too much oil was used and the wok wasn't hot enough. Other things noted were that the dish itself was quite small and they used sugar which has no place in this dish.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 2.5 as it is so very average compared with all these dumpling joints that sprung up in the city in the last couple years. I would only visit this place if I lived nearby, which I don't. Won Kok next door has much better food, but cost twice as much. Slim pickings in this area.", "author": "Bor C."}

Did she really just talk to me like that? There was no need to be rude and talk to me in that tone when I was only trying to make things easier for her.

Since I've never really drove through the city streets I took my sweet time and I mean, it was crazy hilly. I was absolutely not used to it. \n\nWhile trying to get to my destination, I was raving about how I wanted dumplings but that Shanghai Dumpling Shop in Millbrae was too far for that. So here I am driving and pulling up to this red light, AND BAM! \n\nDUMPLINGS were in my face, well it was the corner restaurant with the sign that said Shanghai Dumpling King and I took a hard right turn and then pulled over right so I could park. Tip: It's a one way so you can just turn right and cut left and park on the left side because it's residential parking and FREE! Anyways, it was around 315PM so I wasn't sure if they were opened or if they were closed. Took a chance, walked in AND YES! Even though it was that lunch break, they were opened the doors were opened and they were VERY welcoming to have diners come in. \n\nI was quickly seated and handed menus. They're your typical Chinese dumpling shop with a couple of specialities and the rest is just your regular Chinese dining menu with stir fry, rice and noodles, vegetables, and so forth. I was just really there for the dumplings so I ordered: \n\nShanghai Steamed Dumpling (10) for (5.95) - Very soupy and was filled with meat! I really enjoyed this and I was genuinely surprised about how much I liked these xlb dumplings. There were ten pieces AND under 6 dollars. I mean, that's cheap AND delicious.\n\nBeijing Style Boiled Chives Dumplings (10) for (5.50)- The skin was super doughy and I think they might have over-boiled it, but it didn't take away from the flavors. My other half who doesn't enjoy chives actually really liked these dumplings. I didn't pick the spicy one since I knew it was just the same thing but with sauce drizzle.  You get 10 very filling dumplings for an absolute steal! \n\nSweet Bun Deep Fried (4) for (2.25)- They made this perfect!!! I mean, it was super sweet and crunchy and deep fried on the outside, while the inside was so moist just like asian bread. The four pieces were huge, almost the size of a young child's fist. I guess that's not a very good comparison but it was a good size. Plus, the condense milk was REAL not watered down, but thick and syrupy, melting with the heat of the fried buns. Even better than Shanghai Dumpling Shop.\n\nI ordered the same things as I usually would at the SDS, but I enjoyed Shanghai Dumpling King a whole lot. I mean my entire meal plus tip was all under twenty dollars! So unreal I don't eat that cheap but man, was that well worth every bite and every cent was well spent. The staff is super nice. The restaurant was decently clean and the bathrooms by SF standards was really clean for what I've seen. \n\nI highly suggest this location and I think it's a lot less busy than the one on Balboa, which is an extra plus. They are both the same so why not pick the better of the two and one with better parking access. If for some reason I ever drove into and through the city like I did, definitely would come back and settle in myself with two orders of those Shanghai Steamed Dumplings. So cheap, so delicious and flavorful and better than my originally favorite location. Oh how such a simple experience can change my entire foodie world.", "author": "Winnie G."}

The pork meat was moist and juicy. But the soup was oily, bland, and not seasoned enough. I had to douse the dumpling in the ginger-soy sauce mixture to get some flavor.\n\nThe vegetable and pork dumplings were pretty good. They were large and meaty, with a generous amount of filling, majority being the pork and not the green onion.\n\nThe vegetarian goose, which is vegetables (typically mushrooms) wrapped with bean curd, was very salty. There was barely any mushrooms, so the whole dish consisted mainly of the bean curd. Don't get me wrong -- I like bean curd, but the proportions were really off in this appetizer, so it was disappointing.\n\nSince Shanghai Dumpling King is relatively new (opened early April 2013), their prices are still pretty low, compared to other Shanghainese restaurants that have been around longer.

Maybe they went back to how they made things when I was obsessed with this place.\" And lo and behold, it did! I was ecstatic that their XLB was flavorful as always, and their spicy wonton wasn't completely made out of the skin wrapping anymore. *tears of joy* And possibly, they tweaked the sauce to the spicy wontons a bit and I actually like it a bit more.\n\nI'll once again crave Shanghai dumpling king :) Happy face.", "author": "Harriet W."}

It's my go to restaurant for valentine's day and anniversaries. \n\nI've been a patron at the Balboa location for sometime and finally decided to try this location. Here's my thoughts: \n1. Parking - Way easier than Balboa. Parking at some points of time probably could be challenging, but there were a lot more options and the area was not very congested. \n2. Wait Time - No wait time when I came on a Saturday at lunch time \n3. Flavor Profile - After ordering the green beans and XLB - same taste as the Balboa location\n\nFor just the above items, it deserved 5 stars. \n\nNow I was torn between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. As many other yelpers have indicated, probability of getting a XLB with soup in it is pretty slim. In about an order of 10, you will have maybe 2 that have soup in it while all others have leaked out. At that point you might as well just get regular dumplings.\n\nOverall this is a good place if you want to trick yourself into eating XLB and also enjoy some tasty chinese food. However, check out other locations if you actually want to eat soup dumplings.", "author": "Keri N."}

The cooks seem to be a lot better at making the XLBs here. It's not as thick as the Balboa location, dumplings are meatier and extra juicy. Skip the dan dan mein, it was terrible. The leftovers are still sitting in my fridge and will most likely just end up in compost. The noodles were garbage. It tasted like they weren't even rinsed after being boiled.\nWaiter was able to make some great recommendations to my siblings. We went with the honey beef filet.

This is directly due to 2 factors: 1. They have to steam the dumplings, which is a slower method of cooking.\n\nThe restaurant is lackluster, with enough niceties to let you know you aren't eating at your own house. The real big ticket experience here is large party, Chinese dumplings. You get 10 standard dumplings for $5.50. That equals 100 for $55. There's nowhere you can get that volume of food, family style, with this good of quality. Beers are about $3, tea is free, and all the other dim sum style food is 4-7$ per plate of 3-10.\n\nThere are more expensive dishes, served as single meals. These aren't worth nearly the deal the dumplings are, unless you come for lunch. The lunch special is a smoking hot deal.\n\nAll in all, there are a few things that can make every trip completely perfect.

The Shanghai Dumpling King because... you eat lots of 'em?... You rule a kingdom of little dumpling citizens? You make the best Shanghai dumplings? Which one is it? \n\nI had to ask because your name is very inconsistent with your product.  Your XLB aka Xiao Long Bao aka Shanghai dumpling is, quite frankly, disappointing. So I'll have to exercise my power in the Kingdom of Yelp n \"rule\" out the false impression that you make the best Shanghai dumplings... You should give up your title as King, hand over your crown, n relieve the throne for your own good.\n\nYour XLB is rather stingy on that treasure chest of juicy soupy goodness.  The bao that holds the meat n soup doesn't hold up very well also, causing the soup to leak creating little moats on my plate.  It makes me cry.  I guess it would make sense if those moats were meant to protect the dumpling n its inhabitants from being eaten.  The bao is most often times soggy and lack that light enjoyable chew.  Everything about a great XLB is nonexistent here.\n\nAlthough XLBs are usually precious little bites that define the greatness of a dumpling empire for me, here it only confuses me because their XLBs don't reflect their title.  Their other dishes are pretty good... Just not the Shanghai XLB dumplings.  You can never go wrong with their traditional Shanghai style stir fried thick noodles or their Dan Dan Noodles smothered in a soy flavored spicy sauce with ground pork.  Their thinly sliced spicy beef tendons are quite an appetizing treat that's a must for all you Asian foodies.  I'm also a sucker for their fish fillets in a tongue numbing spicy oil.  \n\nThe owner is always friendly n serves with a smile while accommodating to a guest's every request.  You just can't go wrong with a quick bite here.  \n\nThe name Shanghai Dumpling King might not be fitting here while their XLB is Suh King but coming for a taste of Shanghai should nonetheless get your savory lips Smaa King.", "author": "Colin M."}

Being *not too* hungry when we got there, I drank tea and listened to my friend vent about the girl who recently cut his heart out and crushed it in front of him with another guy. Poor thing. Then our bean sprouts arrived and I decided to eat a few. \n\nSlightly crunchy, garlicky goodness overwhelmed me and I had a new take on the situation. As I added garlic pepper sauce to my greens, the advice began to flow. Then came the Pork / Chive Dumplings which are amazing in and of themselves. Spicy, oily, red sauce and lots of garlic and chives. \n\nOne basket of XLB came out and I taught my (unexperienced) friends how to scoop the little steamed dumplings into their spoon, drizzle vinegar sauce over them and take them in all at once. Hot, plump, flavorful, spoonfuls of goodness right there. The steamed pork buns came out next and they were perfect to break up the savory dishes. Slightly sweet exterior was matched with a juicy pork dumpling inside. If I had to do it again (which I plan to) I would probably throw some beef in those. We were definitely on a pork overload and even more so when the second basket of XLB  arrived.\n\nWe chatted, sipped tea, and polished off our dinner as we waited for the Fried Egg Doughnuts with Sugar to come out. Pure bliss. We each had one, and my friend desperately wanted to order more to take home, and let me just say that the Chinese are doing it right: one waiter came out with a tray full of fresh, hot doughnuts asking if anyone had ordered them, prompting two tables to ask what those were and then opted for a plate. Nicely done. \n\nSuch a declious dinner and good talk sesh, we all felt content and cleansed of bad juju after we finished.

But that was for the Outer Richmond location. When I found out there was another location in the less trendy Sunnyside district, I figured I'd give it a try. Here's what to know if you decide to do the same: \n\n* There is never a wait here! Well, maybe once when I was already seated (immediately) on a weekend night, a short queue had begun to build up by the time I was eating. But in general, you and your group can get a table at this location quickly.\n* The xiao long bao, the soup dumplings from Shanghai that the restaurant references in its name, are hit or miss. In the handful of times I've been here, I'd say only 1 in every 4 dumplings is filled with enough soup to sip on. With every subsequent visit, I'll admit it has been sort of a bummer to get my hopes up (\"THIS time, I'm SURE the dumplings will ALL be oozing with that deliciously savory broth!\"). I give it a solid 1 in 4. At best.\n* You may be thinking, wait, seriously? How you gonna name yourself after Shanghai dumplings (the King of them, no less) and your XLB is NOT on point?? I can understand that rationale, but also, there are a lot of other really tasty dishes here worth trying that nearly make up for the faux pas of the place's namesake. The spicy dumplings, covered in sesame/peanut sauce, is one. The minced pork noodles are another. Most of the daily specials are usually pretty good, too.\n* The prices are extremely reasonable. The last time I feasted here (I left super, duper stuffed), it was still less than $15 per person. \n* I find the service here to be very nice and friendly. For this reason I feel bad not giving them more than 3 stars. But that means I'm totally open to a future update.\n\nAll things considered, I enjoy coming to this Shanghai Dumpling King. It's become my go-to when I can't think of anywhere else to eat. At least I know what I'm getting whenever I go (1 in 4, for now).", "author": "Kate V."}

My grandparents and aunt & uncle love coming here because they swear it's one of the best Xiao Long Baos you can get in the city. I wouldn't really agree on that. Their Xiao Long Baos are good, but there are definitely other places that serve better ones.\n\nThe dinner food they serve here is very homey and tasty. I don't know what they're called since my family orders in Chinese, so I'll just go with the description. The fat noodles with beef and some greens, that are chopped up into coins tastes amazing, one of their better dishes. I love eating this one, since it's not a dish my family can make at home.\n\nI love the clay pot rice too. It's a different style from Cantonese clay pot, being that it's Shanghainese, so the meat is thinner sliced and has a different flavor. The bowl is also a huge thin silver pot, versus the thick black one you may usually get at a Chinese restaurant. The rice just has a different flavor to it, probably from the meat. \n\nI also like the soup because it has a stronger chicken flavor than other places. It's definitely well flavored, probably from the salt. It comes with bok choy, some meat, and the noodle that comes in a knot.\n\nThe service is a little frustrating, but what do you expect from a dirty chinese restaurant? They accidentally billed us for 2 of the same dish. Also, another one didn't come out until we asked about it, so it seemed like they forgot about it. Lastly, we brought wine (because my fam loves to drink) but they didn't have wine glasses. So tip, BYOWG. They do have a wine opener though!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

The shop is divey with the sticky tables and chairs and fairly bare decor.\n\nOur order:\nSweet Soy Bean Milk: ($1.50) served hot (Dau Zoeng)\nThai Iced Tea: ($1.75) \nPan Fried Chives & Meat Pastries: ($5.25) 3pcs\nGreen Onion Pancake: ($5.25) Chewy, flaky, and savory pan-fried bread (Chong Yao Beng)\nShanghai Steamed Dumpling: ($5.95) 10pc of soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao - XLB)\n\nThe sweet soy bean milk was lightly sweetened in a glass. A bit surprised because I was expecting it in a bowl. I typically like to drink my hot sweet soy bean milk with youtiao (a Chinese cruller) in a bowl but they don't have any! =/\n\nThe Pan Fried Chives & Meat Pastries was more of a pan-fried dumpling and not a pastry. The skin was similar to a thin pot-sticker. I personally would've liked it more if it was served with a thick Taiwanese pancake-like pastry instead.\n\nThe green onion pancake was very thin and crunchy (like a cracker) unlike the menu's description of the item. It's not what I'm used to so I was very disappointed. I like my green onion pancake with lots of light flaky layers and thicker.\n\nThe XLB didn't have too thick of a skin and had just enough soup inside. The skin was also moist enough where it actually didn't stick to the steamer (which is one of my pet peeves). My friend never had it before and completely inhaled the dish and wanted to order more even though we still had several dishes to finish. ^^;;\n\nService was ok as they cleared our plates when the dishes became empty.

Although I like Chinese food and dumplings I am not a Shanghai Steam Dumpling connoisseur.They put small slices of fresh ginger in the soy sauce when you eat at the restaurant but not in the to go soy sauce (fresh ginger makes a difference). The Spicy Deep Fried Chicken Wings are good too. I also recommend the Sugar Egg Puffs for desert (order them early if you don't want to wait because they do take some time to make).  The puffs are good with the warm soybean drink (it is on the menu) but half the time they do not have it. Overall the price is a good value for the portions. It is probably best to come with at least four people so you can try the different dishes. They have a few big tables with a lazy Susan that is good for bigger groups.  The service is fast with no frills. The restaurant and restroom is fairly clean. It is a casual dinning experience. \n\nI frequent the Monterey Blvd location Shanghai Dumpling King regularly.  I have been here at least 30+ times since they opened and have never had to wait to be seated. No wait is awesome when you just want to get in and out. There is only street parking here but it should not be too hard to find compared to the other location.  They prefer cash for orders smaller than $15 (but willing to take my credit card the few times I showed up without cash). I sometimes will order online and pick up the order.  I find it easier than calling in the order. They do deliver for orders of $30+.\n\nRandom observation...\n\nThe curtains here are orange. Usually most Chinese restaurants have red curtains or motif because it a good luck color. I wonder if the orange was for the SF Giants or if the orange curtains were a better deal than the red.

You know what I'm talking about, XLB fans! Worry not, the XLB here are sturdy enough to withstand a few seconds of transportation from bamboo steamer to spoon to mouth, so far with a 100% success (though I still hold my breath every time). \n\nThey're bigger than most XLB I've had, and the wrapper is thicker, too... Which may contribute to its success. The inner broth is fantastic --- complex and well-seasoned --- definitely worth the anxiety and trepidation that prefaces each dumpling. $5.95 gets you 10 of these puppies.\n\nAlso tried the \"spicy\" chicken wings --- fried and doused in a sweet-savory sauce.

At $8.95/8 wings, I'll be heading over to San Tung for my next chicken wing craving.\n\nHow 'bout the appetizer of \"spicy\" \"bok choy\"? FYI: it is neither spicy nor bok choy. Whomp whomp whomp...

Stopping by earlier in the week to pick up a takeout menu (they close on Tuesdays so I stopped in Wednesday afternoon), I studied their menu and stopped Thursday for a lunch takeout for the office.\nAfter calling in my order, the waiter told me that my food would be ready in ten minutes.  I ordered two items, finishing one and munching on the other.\nThe beef stew sai fun (clear cellophane noodles) was my main meal.  They separated the noodles in a small paper box while the broth and meat were in a plastic soup container.  This was just okay as the soup, unlike Milpitas' Darda and Clement St. Taste of Formosa, lacked those deep herb flavors (cinnamon stick or star anise), and the dominant flavor came from sliced red peppers.  The noodles dissolved well in the broth and meshed with the soup well.\nThe other order was their famed Xiao Lung Bao.  One order is comprised of ten medium sized dumplings with nice 'not-to-thick' skins.  The only disappointment was that the soup content was not very high (not due to broken skins) and the flavor was a bit one dimensional... meaty.  There are ten to each order (held back, eating three).\nTheir original Balboa Street was in my family's Saturday dinner rotation for many years in the early 2000's.  When the founding owners sold the business and moved to Millbrae, the food quality suffered a bit, making the trek to the Richmond District a little less attractive.  As mentioned in other reviews, they are renovating the Balboa location.  While waiting for my food, I asked the waiter who confirmed that this location is not temporary and will serve as their second permanent location.\nThe meal was just okay; the staff were all Cantonese speaking which makes one question the authenticity of the Shanghai cuisine here.  Perhaps, they are still working out the opening kinks and hopefully the food quality will kick up as they adjust to their new environs.", "author": "Mike C."}

I've been to the original location a couple times and decided to try the new one since I'm pretty close by. I was never a huge fan of SDK, and it's pretty much the same story here.\n\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup - The broth had a good depth with various spices to highlight the flavor. I could tell that there was some ginger and cloves to give it some layers of complexity. I actually found a piece of dried shrimp in the broth, and that probably helps add some savoriness to the soup. Smart stuff. With the tasty broth, the beef brisket and tendons had good flavor as well, but some pieces could have been more tender. I was not a fan of the noodles though. They were thin like Cantonese egg noodles, but the texture and taste were really odd. The noodles had a strange soft doughiness. It wasn't springy and firm like Cantonese egg noodles or chewy like hand pulled noodles. It was just kind of soft and mushy. I really didn't like that.\n\nXLB - The skin was nice and thin, but it didn't break apart smoothly when I bit into it. The skin had this weird elasticity that made it kind of stretch when I tried to open it up and slurp the broth. It was kind of the same issue I had with Benu's XLB, but at least these are a lot cheaper so it's much more forgivable. Inside, there's a generous amount of pork stuffing, and the broth was pretty much just pure grease. Some people might not appreciate such a heavy handed approach, but it didn't really bother me. What bothered me was the flavor of the broth and pork, which was pretty one dimensional. There wasn't much to balance out the richness and saltiness. It really lacked the aromatic spices like ginger and green onions to cut through the heaviness. The aromatics also give the broth and stuffing a bolder punch of flavor. Without those components, the XLB didn't really stand out.\n\nStir Fried Green Beans - I thought this was probably the best dish of the night. The green beans had a firm wrinkly exterior while the center was tender and smooth. Garlic, onions, and some fried cured meat stuff added a lot of flavor and crunchy texture to the green beans. It was well seasoned, and the stir frying added that wok hei intensity to the flavor. \n\nSugar Coated Chinese Doughnuts (Sah Yong) - They came completely cold and not fresh. I didn't like that the sugar was just lazily dumped on top. It should be evenly coated all around the doughnut. I told a waiter about our lackluster doughnuts, and he had some explanation and comped it for us which was a nice gesture. I still think that if the doughnuts had just been sitting there or if the cook was off, then they shouldn't serve them. In their defense, freshly made Sah Yong isn't that common around here. Even venerable Koi Palace can be inconsistent with theirs. I feel like people treat SDK like it's the only place in the city that has good Sah Yong, but I've never had a good one here or at the Richmond location. Am I missing something?\n\nThe food hasn't changed with the new location so if you're a fan of SDK, I'm sure you'll still love the food here.", "author": "Nei N."}

Kind of doughy though.\n\n*Stir Fried Noodles Shanghai Style - All food should be Shanghai style!\n\n*The fact that you can spend $26 on a satisfying meal for three people (!!!)\n\nMy only gripe is they wouldn't do anything for my friend's birthday. How hard is it to stick a candle in an egg puff?", "author": "Dyanna Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-22", "description": "I'd love to give this place 3 & 1/2 stars, but I can't, of course.\n\nPlusses:\n1.  They have excellent XLB- xiao long bao, which they are famous for.  For those that do not know, XLB is a tiny soup dumpling, traditionally with pork inside and a bit of broth that oozes or squirts out as you bite into it.  Here, the dumplings (#4-Shanghai Steamed Dumpling) are bigger than normal. The skin is very light and thin, which is desirable for any above-average XLB.  The filling is delectable - moist & tender, and the soup inside is very flavorful.\n2.  Their (#34-cucumber salad) is light and crunchy.  It's not overpowering in either saltiness or sweetness.  It also has just the right amount of garlic.  Yum!\n3.  (#54-stir fried rice cakes) This dish is really good.  The sauce is nice, without drenching the contents and has some green veggies, which I'd have liked more of.  It has pork too.  My companion noted that some of the noodles stuck to each other didn't have sauce.  Boo.  \nA minus for that. ^\nMinuses:\n1.  (#55-stir fried noodles Shanghai style) I am biased because I don't like this dish to begin with, but gave it a try.  The Chinese ham in it was too salty and there was SO much of it.  And like I said, I'm not partial to it as it is.\n2.   Service was pretty slow.  Also, we did not have anyone offer to refill tea or water.  No one even checked if we were needing anything else.  Also, we had to flag down people for the check and a box for take-home.  Yes, I'm aware it's Chinese and service is not expected to be stellar.  But still!\n\nAll in all, good food but I'll only go back for XLB and cucumbers if I'm in the area.", "author": "Natalie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-17", "description": "Very striking name. At first glance, I was expecting a regular Chinese restaurant. Turns out I was half correct. While this place does have many traditional Chinese dishes, their main specialty is steamed food and this also included dumplings. \n\nWe started off with two different types of dumplings, the one with crab and a traditional style dumpling with a pork filling. We also ordered a spicy beef dish and two sides of rice. Like many contemporary Chinese restaurants, they charge by the bowl when it comes to rice so no starch overload here, which can be good and bad.\n\nBoth the dumplings were excellent! I haven't had too many soup dumplings in the past so I can't really compare them to any other ones besides the ones that cone in bags for hot pot and the ones over at some buffets. By far, they're the best I've ever had keeping that in mind. The spicy beef was a nice addition to the meal because those dumplings are small and won't fill you up completely.\n\nIt's a shame that my family doesn't like just having soup dumplings for dinner, otherwise I'd definitely bring them here. Until they covert their traditional ways, I can always bring friends along with me here.", "author": "George Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-19", "description": "As much as I really want to love this place, it disappoints me that it isn't quite as good as other dumpling places in the city. The food here just doesn't have the same flavor or \"punch\" to it. \n\nI think the thing that irks me about this place is the skin of the dumplings. How a restaurant makes their dumpling skins plays a pretty integral role in how great the restaurant is, and here, the skin is always just too thick. It ends up taking away from the actual meat and soup inside because of how much you have to chew on the skin. This is particularly true for the pan fried buns. This is typically my favorite dish to order at Shanghainese restaurants, but here, the skins on them are so incredibly thick and doughy it ends up feeling like you're eating the skin of a pork bun. This isn't how it should be. The noodle dishes are alright (I usually get the Shanghai noodles) in flavor and taste. The portion size could be a bit bigger though.\n\nAll in all, this place is a sufficient place to stop by if you're hungry and are craving dumplings. But if given the choice, I would highly recommend going to Dumpling Kitchen or Kingdom of Dumpling instead.", "author": "Aaron W."}

Had the most delicious crab dumplings that have the soup in it (sorry, I don't know what it's formally called). Very delicious and with so much flavor. I totally recommend getting these! \n\nI was also very impressed with their Fish Fillet with pepper salt. The fish fillet was fried in this tempura batter that was well seasoned with the pepper salt. Every time I took a bite I always had this light and airy crunch, which is what you would similarly get from anything beer-battered, while the meat in the inside was perfectly cooked and as soft as tofu. That's the thing that amazes me with the fish fillet dishes from Chinese restaurants...they always cook the fish in such a way that it comes out tender, juicy, and absolutely decadent. I was definitely impressed with this dish. \n\nOther things I tried was the sweet soy milk, the mapo tofu, onion pancake, and the sugar donut. The sweet soy milk was absolutely delicious. I chose to have it warm and it totally soothed my soul :). Now, their SUGAR DONUT was TO DIE FOR! I hear they come out randomly whenever they make them and serve them out fresh and THAT'S IT. Luckily, they came out when I was there! It came out fresh outta the oven and sprinkled with like a teaspoon of sugar. As I tore it apart, it actually was a hollow donut, but SO FLUFFY. It was like an empty cream puff donut. But, oh wow...the inside was glimmering with shine of freshly baked egg and this soft and moist consistency throughout, unlike a cream puff which has a more rough and tough exterior. It was so good, I actually ate two! The sweetness definitely comes from the sugar, but it's the texture that you just fall in love with. Whatever you do, DON'T HESITATE to pass these up. When you see them being served, get them because that may probably be your only chance. As for the mapo tofu and onion pancake, these were both OK. The mapo tofu was good, but I wasn't too impressed with it. The onion pancake was not impressive either. I didn't like how dry and crispy the pancake was, and I was assuming it was going to be flakey and moist. \n\nI love Chinese food and this place rocks!!!

I was craving for some light Chinese food. The restaurant was quite empty when we were there. \n\nWe ordered Shanghai steamed dumplings (xiao long bao), braised beef in an iron pot, vegetable rice (cai fan), and some stir-fried green leave vegetable with bean curd. Their xiao long bao was pretty sad for a place that's supposed to specialize in Shanghai dumplings. I suspect they made their xiao long bao with those wonton skins bought from supermarkets instead of making their own dumpling skin (the xiao long bao skin tasted very much like rubber). And when the dumplings were served, almost all them them had broken skins which means the precious soup inside the dumplings all leaked. Then the dipping sauce that came with xiao long bao contained coarsely diced ginger instead of fine Julienned ginger, which was a big red light for me.\n\nThe vegetable rice was alright, slightly on the greasy side. Stirred fright vegetables with bean curd was very bland. I give them an extra star for the braised beef, which was probably the highlight of our dinner.\n\nAfterwards I talked to some Shanghainese friends of mine about our dinner experience, and it turned out they all think this place (and its two other sister restaurants with the same name in the bay area) was pretty crappy too.", "author": "Christine C."}

It was predetermined the night before when we were at our third bar and like 12 drinks deep that we were going to have soup dumplings the next day for lunch. We got there right when it opened so we were seated right away. \n\nAtmosphere:\n\nYour typical family owned, semi hole-in-the-wall kind of place. Decor is blah. But keep in mind that this is just the temporary location until their original one is done remodeling. So don't put too much emphasis on the look of this place. \n\nFood: \n\nPretty good! We got three orders of the Shanghai Steamed Dumplings, one order of the Pan Fried Pork Bun, Braised String Beans and Shanghai Style Soup. It was all pretty good. The steamed dumplings (soup dumplings) weren't bad. The first batch we got was pretty weak - most of the dumplings were flat so they lacked the steaming hot delicious soup inside. The second and third batches were rad. I think my favorite thing here were the Braised Strings Beans. SO GOOD! They top it of with a ton of sauteed garlic and onions - flavor burst for sure!\n\nService:\n\nNot great, not bad. Just your typical family owned Chinese restaurant. If you're Chinese, like I am, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Ha!\n\nIf you're in the mood for soup dumplings, check this place out. You won't be disappointed but at the same time, you won't be blown away. If you've ever had the soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung in SoCal (Arcadia) or even in Taipei, Taiwan then you've had the best - every other place comes second!!!", "author": "Bruce C."}

And when I saw that this place sold it for just under $7, I had to check it out.  When I arrived it was around 4:30 pm on a Sunday.  Naturally it was pretty empty but the decor seemed nice enough for a hole in the wall place like this.  The tea was very good and the waiter was polite.  I waited a little longer for my food than most other places I've been but that wasn't terribly upsetting.  The xiao long bao was very soupy, which is good in my opinion.  The broth, however, was a bit too sweet for me and the dough was a little too sticky.  And unfortunately, I didn't care for their vinegar ginger sauce. I also tried the spicy wontons and they were quite good.  Everything was exceptionally average.  But you can't beat the price I suppose.", "author": "Kyle T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-23", "description": "I've been here before and thought it was mediocre. Ive been through my fair share of shanghai dumpling places to give a fair review... i walked in and there was a lady who was on the phone whose screaming and yelling. we waited for a few moments before she spotted us and then angrily directed one of her staff (i assume she is the owner) to get us seated. \n\nThe wait wasn't long, granted there were only three tables occupied in there, and that was the only good thing.\n\nFirst off, eating soup dumplings require both ginger and vinegar. But what they provided us were these few small pieces of ginger, (more like 1/5 the size of an m&m) that was dipped in an inch of vinegar. it got so bad that my dad and i made a competition out of who could get the first piece of vinegar into their dumpling...no one won.\n\nthe soup dumplings were terrible. The dumplings that were made to have soup in them...HAD NO SOUP. all of them were poked through and all the soup was gone...so the dough ended up being very dry and sticky. Not one of them had the SOUP in the soup dumplings, which is the most important part of any xiao long bao. The meat was falling apart inside the dumpling that was mostly fat by the way. It  tasted really frozen. and i know enough that shanghai dumplings are supposed to be frozen because thats how you can get the congealed soup inside a closed dumpling. but me and my dad, right off the bat, knew that it was frozen for a very long time.\n\nthe shanghai noodles had a bitter aftertaste and its probably from th spinach or the cabbage. They doused so much soy sauce into the dish that it was hard to enjoy. this is considerably one of the hardest dishes to make because its so simple and restaurants seem to overcomplicate it..and I've yet to find a place that makes it easy to eat.. this restaurant tried o pack it with so much flavor that it became overwhelming.\n\nand next..the fried dumplings...\n\noh gosh. my first bite was weird..for some reason, i just knew that the meat was possibly spoiled. it had such a weird aftertaste that i felt compelled to take another bite...my dad and i looked at each other and then finished off the dumpling..and then ate another. \n\nit was just so weird... my dad didn't think it was spoiled and insisted that it was just how it was suppose to taste so we finished off the plate. but i had a gut feeling that it really was a weird taste for a dumpling.\n\nBAD DECISION.\n\non the way home, about ten minutes after the meal, i get hit with the biggest pains in my stomach. it was torture. i don't know if its was the spoiled food or dirty water from the tea or the tap water they gave me but i was sure that this was the restaurant that did this. i didn't eat breakfast that day and it had been like 15 hours of no food in my system until i ate here. \n\ni think its safe to say that I will never come here to eat again. food that isn't up to par, flavor isn't good, and o-kay service is one thing, but for food to not be clean?? for there to possibly be a dirty kitchen in the back of the place is another thing that is just BAD!\n\nyou do realize that you guys are putting food into people's mouths?? \n\nABSOLTELY TERRIBLE. perhaps its a case-by-case thing and I'm the only one dealing with this. but my dad is now having stomach aches and diarrhea as well. \n\nthis restaurant is terrible and i urge you all to go the the other dumpling store that is right across from the street. their shanghai dumplings are amazing and they're BOGO. much better than this place.\n\ndon't ever come here.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

But I'll try to be positive and offer the good along with the bad. So lets get this baby started.\n\nThe Good:\nI've been to their original location on Balboa many many times and I have always appreciated their food.  The cleanliness of the restaurant, not so much but I over looked it.  As long as they didn't sit me by the restrooms, I was ok. I am in love with Shanghai Soup dumplings. Coming from NYC where we have Joe's Shanghai and Nan Xiang Dumpling House (delish) I am always in the quest for shanghai soup dumplings.  This resto (along with a few unnamed others that I have found) offer me a good choice for when the soup dumpling hunger pangs strike.  The food is of decent to good quality. Soup dumpling can be hit or miss depending on the visit.  A good restaurant should always have high quality food anytime you visit. That's what sets it apart from its competitors. Lions head meatballs. Yummy! I like the one with the gravy. They have a soup one but I've never tried it.\n\nThis bad review is for their new relocated restaurant on Monterey Blvd. Visit 4/28/13 12:15pm\nThe Bad:\nOMG. Cleanliness is such issue with this place.  I don't care myself since I grew up in NYC and always eat at a wide variety of establishments.  I eat at food trucks, food stalls, I visit food market in asia. I don't care and i understand not everyone is super clean. I get it. But my dining companion was really irritated with their unsanitary habits that it ruined his dining experience.\n\nExamples from my notes:\n1) tables were wipes down with a damp rag (dirty) then left to air dry while still wet. The dirty rag was then put into a pile to be reused by the other wait staff to wipe down other patrons tables. This dirty pile was never washed nor taken away to washed.\n2) the servers who used their hand to pick up the dirty wet rag and wipe the tables did not wash or disinfect their hands afterwards and continued to handle customers dishes, utensils, drinks, food, and money.\n3) utensils and napkins had food particles remaining on surfaces.\n4) \"Jerry\" (employee/boss) would shake customers hands on 3 separate occasions and proceed to work handling items mentioned above without hand washing/disinfecting.\n5) Dining companion could not find health inspection score card posted conspicuously on the premises within customers view.\n\nSo you take this review for what it is. Would I still eat here? Of course! I'm not anal about this stuff. Can I recommend them to my friends and family? Only to those who aren't squeamish about cleanliness.\n\nThe service is as attentive as it should be for a chinese establishment (brief and concise) The food tastes decent.

I shared two dishes with a friend of mine, the shanghai dumplings and the spicy chives and pork dumpling. Each dish came with 10 dumplings for $5.50 each. Not bad of a price especially for my super bad craving of shanghai dumplings. The shanghai dumpling had soup, and it didn't pop when you picked it up compared to other places which is a plus. Some of the dumpling were more of a sticky consistency where the skin isn't as soft but overall it's alright. For the price, can't really go wrong. As for the spicy chives and pork dumpling, it's okay. Not too spicy and the hot sauce is mixed with oil. They add sesame seeds on top to give it more flavor. This was also okay. Can't say much about the other food since I haven't tried it but I'd be back for a shanghai dumpling fix only.", "author": "Julian Y."}

My mom loves Shanghai cuisine and wanted to give this restaurant a try.\n\nThe waitress came over and we made small talks with her. Two sentences later, we realized none of the people working there came from Shanghai. My husband expressed we were looking for an authentic Shanghai restaurant. The waitress named Cindy responded by saying they had been in business for more than 10 years. She then walked away suddenly and told us she is too busy to talk to us at all if we weren't ordering. We couldn't say anything because she simply left our table.  A few minutes later she came back but left us again without saying a thing this time. Finally she came back and I told her what I and my daughter would like to order immediately lest she leaves again. My mom told her what she wanted to order but Cindy asked her to be quiet because she could only take order from one person -that's me.  We found that to be very strange and rude but didn't say anything. My mom did order for herself...and asked Cindy if they have delivery service. Cindy asked her not to ask other questions as she is too busy writing the order.  She became increasingly rude, and never responded my mom with an answer.\n\nSince we hadn't been there before, after we ordered a bunch of dishes, my last question to Cindy was if we had ordered enough. She responded there was no way to tell.  Our family dine out a lot and has never encountered wait staff unable to answer this question if they purport to be in business for a long time.\n\nOur dishes came and everything tasted the same, and everything had added sugar so the food were all too sweet. Nothing tasted good or authentic. We asked the manager/owner to come over as we planned to talk to him about our experience. He signaled us to wait, but he never came over for the next 50 minutes we were there. We told another waiter our experience. Then Cindy came back again. This time she was extremely polite to my mom and was so fake that she made my mom uncomfortable. She told me the restaurant caters to white people because they have no idea what's authentic or good. At the minimum she had a response to our question before we ordered. \n\nMaybe that's why she felt that she didn't have to be respectful to elders such as my mom. She knew we weren't going to return and thus didn't care.  But this is no way to operate a reputable business in a competitive and culturally diverse market.", "author": "Amanfly p."}

For under $30 my girlfriend and I can order enough food for 2 meals. Almost everything I have tried here is great, the staff is attentive and friendly, and parking can normally be found nearby.\n\nMy only complaint is that the restaurant is cold and when the door are opened the tables in front of the door can get a strong breeze. Try to sit away from the door and to the side.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nThe thing everyone goes for is the XLB, steamed pork dumplings with a chicken/pork broth inside which is full of flavor. A good XLB needs to have a good wrapper/skin, it needs to be thick enough to hold the broth and not ripped when picked up; but it also needs to be thin enough to not be overly chewy. The flavor is obviously the most important and these are well seasoned, so not overly salted but enough to bring out the flavor of the filling and broth.\n\nMy second go to item is the Lions Head Meatball (not int he soup). These are three massive meatballs serve on top of spinach with a sauce, which If i had to guest would say it is a oyster sauce base. The meatballs are delicious with the sauce, and the spinach is great for mopping up the remaining sauce.\n\nI normally also get their warm sweetened soy milk, mainly because the restaurant is pretty cold. Maybe the owner likes it cold to encourage people to order more dumplings.\n\nI know there will always be people that will say Din Tai Fung is better, and i agree, DTF is a very well known franchise from Taiwan which is famous for their XLB, with locations in LA and rumored to be opening a location in the Bay Area.

Really bad customer service! \nBtw, my friend is a native Shanghainese, and he said the dumpling in this restaurant is not a shanghainese traditional style dumpling, it's more like a Cantonese style there.", "author": "John F."}

They were wonderful. \n\nShanghai style noodles (stir fry): Greasy, but what is chinese food without the grease? They were very yummy and full of flavor. Comes in a rather big portion. \n\nSpicy Chives and Pork Dumpling: Although it says spicy, it is not very spicy at all. It has a little kick but very mild. Dumplings are definitely homemade which is nice that they dont give you some store bought stuff. \n\nPan Fried Pork Buns: By the time this came out, we were all stuffed but we had to fit fit this one in. Eight buns comes in one order. They are nice and crunchy on the bottom. They are also good leftovers. \n\nSugar Egg Puffs: We did not order this dish but the lady came by and said it was delicious so we caved. We were so full when we got to this.
