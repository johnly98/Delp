But they don't open till noon. So is it really brunch? Anyways they serve \"brunch\" from noon to 3pm. When we went around 1:30pm on a weekend, there was only one dude/bartender working in the whole place (well besides the kitchen staff). But that seems tough. We kinda walked and sat down before he waved us over to the bar to order since he was the only one there. They offer a small menu for brunch - maybe 5 items or so. Which is nice - not too hard to choose. I got the breakfast pizza and my bf got the breakfast quesadilla. All the items are vegetarian and around $10-12. You can could add meat for a little extra. And we added sausage to the quesadilla. Also we got our first round of mimosas when we ordered. Mimosas were good. Found when I got my second and third refills that it's premade and in a pitcher so maybe not the freshest mimosas. Food came out a little while later and both dishes were great. The birdnest pizza is thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, potatoes, cheese and eggs. I wish the eggs were more runny when it came out bit they were pretty cooked. Still very delicious. The breakydilla had eggs, pepperjack cheese, potatoes and sundried tomatoes in a tortilla. And we added sausage to it. The cheese made it slightly spicy but they had scoops of guac and sour cream on the side to help. My bf liked both dishes as well and said he would come back. Not sure if the groupon is actually a deal. I would think the cost of the groupon us about what I would expect to pay normally. But glad I got to try this place. And they have a bunch of beers on tap so I'll prob be back also.", "author": "Alison W."}

It was a toss up between the baked brie and the chicken skewers. I opted for the chicken because it described a peanut sauce. When it came out, it was actually much more than I assumed. Usually when you get them at a Thai restaurant, there's 4 skewers, as that is what I had in mind. There were at least 8 skewers I'd say and my assumption about them being like a dish at a Thai restaurant was way off. It didn't have the taste of your typical chicken with peanut sauce, the chicken had seasoning and the peanut sauce wasn't as smooth as it typically is at a Thai restaurant. It was definitely not a disappointment though, I easily polished it off! It came on a bed of greens which had been tossed in a nice light dressing. \n\nOur waitress noticed it was my birthday and offered up a round of sake bombs for my friend and I.

I love going back to a place I already had a good feeling at, but didn't get to try much of the food options. Fly Bar has a lot of great options, so I was very happy to go back on Friday and try it out.\n\nMy friend just got a raise so she was out celebrating at Fly Bar. Some of my friends and I headed over to join around 8PM and the place was starting to fill in. We said our hellos at the pool table and snagged a spot for two at the bar. My friend bartends there so she came over quickly to say hello and took our order of Chicken Nachos with extra jalape\u00f1os. The food took a while to come out, so we worked on our beers and chatted. \n\nThe Nachos were seriously bomb. SO MANY EXTRA jalape\u00f1os! I was amazed, but I also did a little schmoozing at the kitchen window while I waited for the bathroom, speaking in broken Spanglish to the chef to please add mas mas! Everything was hot, both temp wise and spiciness, and extremely cheesy so we were very happy. We also got a cup of sour cream, guac, and Pico de Gallo on the side. My other friends came over to eat some nachos with us and also ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza. \n\nLove the food and beer options and the friendly staff.

They're quite delish and refreshing.  But if that doesn't work for you, there's always the sangria or beer...and do they have a full bar in addition to this? I wouldn't know, I've never ordered anything other than a sake cocktail.  \n\nHappy Hour is also pretty sweet here if you're looking for an early dinner.  Individual pizzas for half off?  Don't mind if I do.  It may be a block away from Little Star, so why come here instead?  Well if you like individual sized, thin crust pizzas with fresh ingredients and good flavors for a much lower price point, then that's why you'd come here.  Also tried the Nick's salad, which is ginormous!  And tasty.  And reasonably priced.  And makes for a full lunch the next day from the leftovers.  \n\nThis is a fun place.  They have a good mix of food and drinks and you can sit towards the windows in the front for a brighter experience, or towards the back in the booth or at the tables for a darker (more romantic?) ambiance.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

Very low-key vibe (no chance of this place feeling like a \"scene,\" I don't think) and friendly cocktail waitress. We stayed for the remaining hours of happy hour (which goes from 12 pm to 6:30 pm and includes $6 pizzas, $3 sangria, $3 sake and $1 off drafts) and enjoyed several Crispin ciders, sake bombs and $6 personal pizzas.  Drinks were cold and pizza was delish (I had the shroom pizza w/ pesto)! All in all, a good and relatively cheap (considering how much we consumed) night.\n\nHOWEVER, it should be noted that FLY does NOT have Sake or Soju cocktails as their website claims they do.  They have beer, wine, sangria and sake.  Dat's it. Minus one star, because I really wanted a sake cocktail and was disappointed.\n\nOther than that, Fly is a perfectly viable and tasty happy hour spot.

Unfortunately for me, I'm not and finding parking in this neighborhood isn't the easiest feat so this is a treat I can retreat to once in awhile. I kept hearing about sake bar this and awesome menu that so of course I had to come and check the place out.\n\nI'm more of a foodie than a drunk so I ransacked the menu as soon as I got greeted and sat. Nachos and pineapple juice for me while I waited for my girlfriend and while I waited, I stared at the weird artwork on the wall. Don't get me wrong, there's a really beautiful painting behind the pool table but the smaller ones looked like someone's child did it. And if someone's child did do it, well then that just makes sense.\n\nThe nachos here are fantastic. And yes, nachos are bar food and everyone does bar food but these guys know how to pile on the cheese and make sure it gets baked in good between all the chips. I especially love a place that adds black beans to the mix since there was no chicken option. And shamefully, I ate the whole dish before my friend even got there. But thankfully, she doesn't read Yelp reviews and will never know of my private shame. \n\nShe did arrive (30 minutes later) and promptly dove into the Sake Breeze which consisted of sake, cranberry juice, and pineapple juice. I took a sip and if it weren't for the fact that I get a case of the \"asian red, \" I would have helped her out with it a little more. It was sweet, balanced and had just a subtle undertone of sake. Darn my \"asian red\"...\n\nTogether we ordered a margherita pizza and hummus plate while we critiqued the odd artwork on the walls and whether it could really be called \"artwork.\" Our hummus plate arrived shortly after the first round of drinks and it certainly did impress us both. The pita was warm and fluffy, the dip creamy and smooth. It was the perfect giant snack for the perfect drink. I can't comment on the margherita pizza however 'cause once the hummus plate was done, so was I. \n\nOverall, the drinks were great, the food was better and our server Holly did everything she could to ensure we had a great time.

I had the margherita pizza which I found to be delightful, thin crust with a healthy topping of cheese, tomatoes and basil.

Both items were fantastic.\n\nI wasn't feeling the soju drinks much, so my waitress was kind enough to take it back and replace with wine. She was the best waitress I have had in like..years. Always making sure no one was standing in the door/aisle area..always making sure everyone had a place to sit, always there when I needed her.\n\nMusic ranged from indie to rap... something about 'Straight Outta Compton' being on and watching city folks walk against violent wind was super entertaining.\n\nHad a great time here, would most definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a good place with great art and ambiance.", "author": "T C."}

The vibe is pretty cool, although there were a few times where it seemed to be amateur night and all about  the students and youngins. \n\nYou can't go wrong with the reasonably priced-food (from the apps to the salads to the sammies). I am a cheesy gal, so one of my fav apps is the baked brie. It's served warm, and spreads so smoothly on the baguette. The garlic isn't overpowering either. Oh, and as a cheese lover, I heart the grilled cheese sammie. Hello, it's on sourdough, my most fav bread! Oh, and it's somewhat healthy since there's tomato! Ok, so if you want the real healthy stuff, go for the salads, with super fresh and crisp lettuce, and are ginormous! My fav is the fruit to nuts. \n\nTime for me to fly over to FLY (hopefully, soon!)", "author": "Gill C."}

Of course being on that certain stretch of Divis, by default hard liquor was unavailable. We ordered the sangria, which is stroooong.

I explain the 5, 21, and 71 buses will go right there.  He responds to say \"I'm sorry, you must have me confused with Ms. Rosa Parks, God rest her soul.   I'll be taking a taxi\".   Actually, he ended up taking the N and walking through the Haight, which led to his funny complaints about how it was much worse than walking through the Tenderloin, because the TL bums only smell like pee, and Haight bums actually manage to smell like poo.  I countered by saying it could just be dog shit drifting over from the panhandle, but had to admit the Haight really does top them all when it comes to nastiness.  The TL bums can always head down to the fountain on Market to shower off, but over here, we just have to wait for the rain.  And it had been a pretty dry month overall...\n\nAnyway, I was too lazy to head in to the Castro and none of use felt like dealing with the Haight, so we decided to explore NOPA.  Fly Bar was the second of three stops, and overall, easily our favorite.   The interior decor is pleasant and semi-romantic, but also hip, and the bartender was very attentive and wore a very short jean skirt.  And yes, the bartender was a girl, much to Nick's dismay.  Although he likes handsome boys and is bored with fairies and queens.   We all liked the beer selection, and while no food was sampled, it certainly looked and smelled good.

It's never too crowded and you can almost always get a table. \n\nThe best time to go, however, is during Happy Hour, which operates daily from 3:30-6:30 pm. Pizzas are offered at half price.

For an extra bonus, I add prosciutto for an extra $1.... heaven. \n\nI also highly recommend the la tortilla salad and the chicken & goat cheese quesadilla. Really though, I have never ordered anything from the menu that I didn't love.\n\nThe atmosphere at Fly Bar is extremely relaxing. The bar acts as a gallery for local artists and it always switching up the artwork and installations hanging on the walls. I have yet to buy a piece, but I have my eye on a piece from the current installation of wax and watercolor art. Fabulous. There is also a pool table in the back of the bar, and people are always willing to team up or start a tournament. \n\nI only have one problem with the bar, but it's a big enough problem to take one star down from the rating: there is no hard alcohol.

That's pretty fly.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it was here that I learned that I get much better at pool the more sangria I consume.  Here is how you can tell:\r\n\r\n0-1 drinks - Balls will be flying off the table.  You will see my friends on the floor.  They are down there because they are laughing at me.  Laughing so hard they can't stand up.  \r\n1-2 drinks - Friends are upright.  Balls are on the table, but may not necessarily be going into holes. \r\n2-3 drinks - I become focused.  Friends aren't laughing.  Balls start going into holes.\r\n3-4 drinks - I'm the zen master of the pool table.  Balls are whizzing into holes all over the place.

The decor has always been a bit strange for me and most recently got even stranger. I know they tried to fancy it up by removing the chalk board and stuff, but now with all the crazy shaped mirrors and bright concrete bar I kinda feel like I should light some incense and wear my sarong. Besides that though, I do like the crowd that comes into the Fly. The bartenders are also very, very nice people and pretty attentive when you need a refill--even when it's crowded. The Fly also has a great happy hour deal on their pizzas at four bucks a pop until 6:30. I can't tell you how many times this has saved me when I've been dirt poor or trying to entertain out of town friends on a budget. \n\nI often find myself wandering into the Fly as my last stop of the evening, which can sometimes be absolutely dangerous! Just a week ago, after a night of bar hopping to 4 different bars all over the city, my friend texted me to meet him there for a drink. I was already buzzed so I was only planning on having one and going home but noooooo, that did not happen. After the bar closed, I had the bright idea of running to the liquor store, getting some tall boys and drinking them in alamo square park until the butt crack of dawn. And the next morning???? Or should I say afternoon, I felt like death was coming to get me. But that's why I love the Fly. at my old age, it's rare I do that kind of thing anymore, but that sangria has something in it to keep me going!", "author": "Jade L."}

They are good, don't get me wrong, but nothing beats that crisp yumminess that is a vodka martini and if you are looking for that, don't come here.\n\nAs the other reviews explain, this is a beer and soju bar for the most part.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-16", "description": "It's a rare bar that gets a five-star rating in my book, as this 'particular' patron can usually find something wrong with just about any establishment. Annoying patrons, crappy beer/wine list, bad neighborhood, ugly bartender...you name it. Yet Fly has surpassed even this critic's sharpest eye and come out on top. Bravo, Fly, you've topped my list. 'Why?' you ask?\n\nFor one, they serve Poppy Jasper. For those of you not in the know, this is hands down the tastiest microbrew around, yet can only be found at a few establishments (Zeitgeist for one) in town. This was the original reason I kept coming back time and again...that, and the fact it's two blocks from my house. But I digress. Poppy Jasper accounts for at least ONE of these stars.\n\nThen there's the menu. I've yet to order anything I don't like (and at this point, I've pretty much made it through the whole menu). The Black Forest Ham and Brie sandwich is a delight, as are these \"salads on top of pizzas\" whatever-they-call-'ems. YUM. That's star TWO.\n\nDecor adds the third star; I believe this is owned by the same people that own Solstice and Brick, yet any and all possible pretension is removed leaving behind a cozy, neighborhood feel. The series of paintings hung high on the wall are unique and eye-catching, and the hanging paper lanterns over the pool table (always in use, but somehow unobtrusive) create a warm, inviting light to the venue. \n\nAt this point you'd start looking for flaws and might turn to the service to find one, except this is NOT the case. The bartenders are prompt, attentive and friendly despite usually being slammed, and the servers demonstrate the same attention to their customers. Even on nights when there's a waiting list for seating, they are patient and kind and when you DO get seated, will make sure that you always have a full beer and aren't lacking for grub. The fourth star is well-deserved for this.\n\nAs for star five, I'll admit it: it's the location. One block down from The Independent (and two from my house), it's many a night when I walk in and see friends among the many patrons at Fly. In fact, it's become our local watering hole, mainly for the reasons listed above but also for that genuine feel of camaraderie and the fact that, after a long night and a full tummy, we can stumble home easily without incident. While \"Cheers\" is a fictional concept, it's not too far off from the affection that I feel for this locale.

The music was \"eclectic\", 80's and 90's dance mostly.

That's some smart math there friends.  \nI can't knock the crowd here because no one has fought me or thrown up on me and that's my standard- pool table is generally available and far enough out of the way so you don't have to say \"mind your nuts\" every time you want to make a shot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-20", "description": "Although I am definitely not a hipster (mental note: the first sign of being a hipster is denying that you are one), I must admit that I do tend to avoid the kinds of bars that Robert Lanham lists in his priceless expose of hipsteria (\"The Hipster'ss Handbook\", 2002).  Let me quote the pearls of wisdom that you will find on page 35.\n\nHipsters despise these kinds of bars:\n\n-Sports Bar (those attended by \"jocks who wear numbered jerseys or white baseball caps\")\n\n-Bars with Dartboards (because \"they tend to attract the same crowds found at sports bars\")\n\n- Bars with Blended Drinks (because \"these bars draw in boys who like Jimmy Buffett and the type of women one sees on E! channel\")\n\n- Cigar Bars (because \"they are frequented by creepy CEOs and Wall Street types who shred questionable accounting documents and cheat on their wives with hookers\")\n\n- High Profile Bars and Clubs (because \"bars with beefy bouncers and stretch limos parked outside are midtown. They attract the fashion-deprived elite and are almost always tourist traps for the hipster wanna-bes, guys with ponytails, and tassels with flubber\")\n\nNow, I would add to this list that generic bars with television hanged on the wall - and usually tuned to some sport event - should also be banned for life. Pubs too are evil. too. I mean, they serve beer and greasy fries! How dare they?\n\nAnd yet, occasionally it's refreshing to see that there's life beyond the wine bar ghetto. Amelie is addictive, but an overdose of Bordeaux is to be avoided. At all costs.\n\nThe good news is that among the bars that you'll find on that fascinating street that is Divisadero - so charismatic that celebrated author Michael Ondaatje used for the title of a novel (which I have not read, therefore I am fully entitled to mention and even recommend) - Fly Bar is the king of the hill. \n\nYes, there is a television set perpetually tuned to some boring sport event above the entrance (sigh). \n\nAnd yes, it features not one, not two, but three pool tables, another cardinal sin because pool tables are magnets that attract \"jocks who wear numbered jerseys or white baseball caps\".\n\nBut still, bear with me.\n\nFly Bar makes outstanding soujou and sake drinks.\n\nThe fact that these drinks are affordable is a bonus, especially in harsh economic times like these when even shopping at entry-level drugstores like Whole Foods can become a nuisance. \n\nI would recommend Soujou Nectar (soujou and Pineapple Juice). (tip: all considerate men should drink pineapple juice on a date. Trust me on that). \n\nFly Bar is conveniently located a block away from club formerly known as Justice League, aka The Independent, making it the perfect spot for a pre-concert  refill. \n\nHappy hour is every hour. The staff is generally good but changes constantly (quality of service varies from really good to really bad - which makes a visit always exciting - \"What's gonna be this time? \"Will I fight with the bartender? Will I fall in love with the waitress?\" suspense! suspense!).\n\nHence the four stars.\n\nWithout the TV set and the pool tables, I would crank it up to six.", "author": "Matt B."}

She just doesn't - know this and you'll be all the wiser...\n\nHaving said that, a chill evening here on a random weekday is well-advised - get here before 6:30, and enjoy the happy hour in which you can enjoy their quality pizzas at half price.

The windows are dark, the sign looks like it was xeroxed and the paint seems a lil chipped.  Inside, though, the place is dive-y cute.  \nSmall tables, and a few large booths.  A pool table.  A bar.  And a kitchen hidden somewhere.\n\nWe had some beers, one of their soju-cocktails (saki-infused since they can't serve hard liquor) and few pitchers of sangria.  The sangria was delicious, and a half pitcher fills 4 sizeable glasses.  The soju-cocktail was alright - nothing all that exciting.  And I assume the beer was good.  Our server was a sweet lil lass, who was great about being there exactly when we needed her.\n\nWe didn't order food, but I saw several plates being delivered and I gotta say - that grub looked GOOD.  I wasn't hungry, but I was seriously considering eating anyway.

Unfortunately, they'd stopped serving food, but our sweet server-type told us we were welcome to bring food in from wherever we wanted (which we did).  There was no line for the pool table (which is always a plus), and we enjoye a riotous, if terribly amateur, game of pool.\n\nSo, yeah - good service, yummy looking food, delcious sangria, and a nice, laid-back vibe.

Also for a local bar, their selection of both bottled & draught beers is awesome.\n\nOnly a few things I would change to make this place a perfect 5:\n1) Serve food later (c'mon, kitchen closes at 10pm when neighboring restaurant are all open till 1am?!)\n2) Extend the happy hour past 6:30 so I can partake!\n3) add some hard-A to the menu.

They have great food at great prices and great cocktails and a great beer selection. It is a great happy hour spot. If I'm not mistaken the pizza (which are really good) are only $6 during happy hour. A total steal! The people are a mixed bag. You will see some true locals, some transplanted locals and a small but steady stream of Lower Pac Heights folks come on in. \n\nThe seating doesn't really lend itself towards group mingling and the seats are kind uncomfortable. It is however a great place to come with one or two friends to get some drinks. It's a good starting point to the evening but not a destination spot.\n\nCome here.

So much whining. Goodness gracious. I'm rolling my eyes. Anyway...\n\nThe interior is dark and feels like a padded cell. There is a revolving art show on the walls of local artists. There is one pool table cramped in the back. There is a good selection of beers on tap although to see PBR was a shock. The food is larger portions and I would classify it as neveau pub fare.\n\nI had the meatloaf sandwich this last time. It was called the \"Ain't Yo Mama's Meatloaf Sandwich\" and for good reason. This was actually better than your mama's meatloaf. Well, my mama's meatloaf at least. I don't know what your mama's meatloaf tastes like. And much love to my mama but this meatloaf was better.\n\nI've had the nachos before and other pizzas like the Marguerite. Everything is generously proportioned and fairly priced. Fly doesn't have a hard liqueur license so all the drinks are mixed with sake or soju.\n\nNow here's the kicker. I work for the Solstice/Fly/Brick empire and although I rarely go into Fly I still got great service... at 6:00PM. The price was right too (wink, wink).\n\n***Update Feb 9 2008; Over the Christmas break Fly got a little face lift. It's a little roomier with a newly designed bar. New beers include Anderson Valley's Brother David's Double and Speakeasy's Hunter's Point Porter.

I immediately like the decor of the place-really unique artworks and cool color scheme. There are these cool mirrors of all shapes and sizes above the bar. I've been on weekday night and it was very relaxing and comfy. I recently went on a Sat night; it was pretty crowded, but not elbow-to-elbow proximity and my friend and I snagged stools at the bar right away. The bartender was an interesting fellow and gave us his attention pretty soon. I have to agree the array of cocktail selection was dizzying. I ended up picking the Mangorita, a soju cocktail with mango, lime, cranberry, and some other fruity combination. Man it was really good and refreshing. And it was only $5! Excellent deal. \n\nUnfortunately I was close to maxing out my drink limit prior to coming so I couldn't finish my Mangorita. Plus the bartender was screaming \"last call\" at the top of his lungs at 1:24 am, and continued to do so every 5 minutes after that to get people to finish their drinks, close tabs, and get the hell out. He did it in a playful manner, of course. Otherwise I'd be like, \"dude, chill out, I still got till 2 am to finish this fabulous cocktail.\" If I lived or worked closer to Fly I would come more often and try the happy hour specials yelpers have been raving about. This place could also be great for an Independent pre-concert drink.

Probably not a regular problem but one that is not rare.\n-Understand megan w.'s review about 48 licenses (it's expensive too) however other places in the adjcent hood have them, and I don't believe a soju cocktail or a cheap pizza makes up for this deficiency, especially in a city like San Francisco where other options abound.  \n\nOverall could have been a good spot to visit once in awhile but the service was a huge turn off.

Comfy booths await your tushy if you get there in time to nab one-- this place fills up pretty quick and doesn't tend to die down until last call.  You can sit at the bar or at tables along the wall as well.  In the back of the bar there's a pool table- a slight minus is that it's a bit askew.  So, if you suck at pool like me you can at least blame it on the pool table being uneven.\n\nThe music is always great here and a different genre every time I go in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-12", "description": "The other night, my boyfriend said, \"How are you gonna write a review of the Fly Bar? You just sat in the booth and tried not to fall asleep. Nothing even happened there.\"\n\nOh, sweet, sweet, simple man... You are so wrong. Not only am I going to write a review of the Fly Bar, I'm going to dedicate my 200TH REVIEW to it. And here goes...\n\nI've never liked the Fly Bar. Hence why I was totally zoned out on my most recent visit. For some reason, people think entering it makes them \"fly\" and there are always stupid girls bumping and grinding around the bar like the fly girls, only they are NOT as fabulous as J. Lo and their booties are NOT as scrumptious. \n\nThere's a two-inch step up to the tables immediately to the right of the door, which has caused me to almost fall on my ass WHILE SOBER so many times in that bar... There's just NO REASON FOR THE STEP TO EXIST. No reason. And NO REASON I need to fall down while sober. I mean, I've faceplanted PLENTY of times in this city. But I PREFER to have a good excuse:\n\n-- My big angry Irish friend and I were celebrating Christmas with a vodka-drinking contest at Murio's Trophy Room (we are classy shit!).\n\n-- It was my roommate's 30th birthday and I HAD to out-drink her. And the doorman. And all the metal dudes hitting on us. At Annie's Social Club.\n\nEtc, etc. \n\nI can recover from such spills just fine. Sober spills -- fxxx that. NOT fly.\n\nWeekend nights here are crowded and service is slow. Also not fly. In general, this is just another bar that's not made for me. Which is fine. I am who I am. I'm a lush, I like cheap booze, chill crowds, good music (meaning the music that I LIKE -- duh), unpretentious people and unpretentious surroundings. I like things the way they are where I come from -- Detroit. The Fly Bar doesn't fit that bill, and that's okay. For the most part, I just avoid it and places like it and everyone stays happy.\n\nBut I was there last weekend. The company I was with likes it, and I'm not that big of a brat, okay?\n\n(Even though Waziema is right down the street! Right down the street!)\n\nAnd I've decided, for my 200th review, that I'm going to give it three stars instead of two. Because had I not gone there on Friday night, I wouldn't have seen, as I was approaching, Starla D. and amir a. standing outside smoking cigarettes. And I wouldn't have been forced to make nice with Amir after a little tiff we had. \n\nBriefly, it went something like this...\n\nAmir and I were going to mock meat restaurants to eat about once a week for a while there trying a different one as often as possible and we really wanted to try Layonna Vege on Clement but the time we tried it was closed and then the next time he asked me to go I said I couldn't because it was the night before I was moving (hello!) and then I find out the next week via this yelp review -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/WDHpY_FcUAJjUm-YQW2xrw#hrid:xa089lzcfcZFsGrgs5ebww -- that he had gone there with other people and I was hurt okay? and I sent him a compliment that basically said \"fxxx you our ritual is DONE\" because come on! you guys couldn't have gone to a different restaurant? you couldn't have waited until AFTER I was settled or something? sheesh but oh well and I really wasn't THAT mad but I just wanted him to know that I was really enjoying our little ritual because I love Amir and I was a little bummed about that and then I don't hear from him for like THREE WEEKS I mean I even got an ROTD and he didn't even compliment me WTF? THESE THINGS MATTER! so I email him \"amir you can't be mad at me because I said I was mad at you that's lame come on let's just get over this speak to me damnit\" or something like that and he just emailed me back \"what are you wearing\" WTF? so I email him back \"jeans a tank top and a bandage on my new tattoo sexy shit\" or something and then another week goes by no word from  him and I email him again \"SERIOUSLY are you never going to speak to me again?\" and he emails me back \"what are you talking about! I asked you what you were wearing!\" or something and then I see him at my roommate's birthday at Inner Mission Tavern and he looks all depressy and I don't talk to him because I think things are still weird and then the next time I see him is at Fly Bar and Starla is like \"you guys talk! please!\" and we do and Amir  is like \"I was afraid of you!\" or something and I'm like \"WTF! this is so dumb! I love you! can we just be friends now! AND WHY ARE YOU SMOKING YOU SHOULD QUIT BECAUSE I'M QUITTING AND QUITTING SUCKS AND MISERY LOVES COMPANY!\"\n\nAnd all this was relived/resolved/happened outside the Fly Bar. And the bouncer was very entertained by our drama. He seemed like a cool dude.\n\nExtra star, The End.", "author": "Lisa T."}

There's something of a hipster Cheers feel to the bar, since you always run into someone you know here. They serve some solid food, great pizzas for sharing, and they pour a nice Guinness, and also carry Poppy Jasper (one of my favorite beers of all time, next to Racer 5 IPA). If I had to file a complaint, it's just that they don't serve hard liquor, but you find a way to get by anyhow. My friend Michelle just started doing some curation for them as well, so if you see some stunning art on the walls, that's her influence. Fly's a great spot to meet if you're on the way to a show at the Independent, or even before or after dinner at Little Star, but it's also just a great place to meet up and share good times and bad with old and new friends.", "author": "Nish N."}

I called ahead of time to let them know that about 30-40 people would be coming in and out of the bar for birthday drinks, etc.  I wasn't sure how they wanted to handle a group that size, but said it would be informal, people coming in for drinks at their leisure.  The woman on the phone asked if people would be eating and I told her that some likely would while others would just be there for drinks.  She said that would be fine and that she could let us use half of the back tables.  She further took my name and phone number and said that she would be talking with the bar manager and if they needed to discuss anything further, they would call me.  \n\nWhen my birthday evening came and people started to arrive, apparently the waitress was dismayed as she said she was expecting 10 people.  I was a bit confused as I clearly said 30-40 and wanted to warn them that a larger party was expected.  After she refused to come to the table to take drink orders, and people started going to the bar to get drinks, she complained to one of my guests that people weren't ordering from her.  I tried to encourage people to order from her, at which time she cornered me (in front of NUMEROUS people) to say that she was in fact the one who talked to me on the phone and that the whole event was not going as we had discussed.  She complained that people wanted separate checks and asked how I proposed that people pay for their drinks.  I asked her how she normally had people pay for drinks at the bar and she said \"CASH!\" to which I said \"okay.\"  Anyhow, after that she refused to serve me, so anytime someone at a table wanted to get service from her, I had to get up and leave.  Another guest had a long conversation with the bartender about the whole scenario and all I know is that drinks were kept in my hand for the rest of the evening.\n\nSo, while the bitchy waitress just about ruined the entire evening, the bartenders managed to salvage things making it into a funny anecdote rather than a bit of a tragedy.\n\nMoral of the story - the place is okay if you sit at the bar.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

And at $3 a pint during happy hour how can you wrong (this just gave you all an extra star--it saved yo' ass! for mediocre-dom)? I also dig the pudgy kid artwork and the fact they have a pool table.

The three of them had beers and I slammed down a saketini and a sangria. We all complimented our drinks with the personal pizzas. Although I enjoyed the drinks and the food, we ended up in the dump spot - the one by the kitchen walkway - which apparently is the spot you're seated at in any restaurant when the servers never  want to see you again.

The pizza was OK, nothing fabulous.  But our WAITRESS....could not have been more surly.  We arrived with 3 friends from out of town hoping to show them a good time.  We were seated right away and given menus, those 2 things composing the best of the service we received that night.  \nAfter we got our drinks---P.S. the sangria is CRAP in a GLASS--we were essentially ignored until our food came.  We were on a time schedule (nothing outlandish or demanding, mind you), and waited politely for our bill to arrive for 20 minutes after we had finished eating and our plates were cleared (not by our original waitress).  After discovering that we might not see her unless we made the effort to track her down ourselves, I decided to be the bill-getter of the party.\nI found our server up at the bar, leaning against it, very casually chatting up a guy and batting her eyelashes at him.  I asked for the bill and she was totally INCENSED that I had interrupted them.  To prove her point and be a complete bitch, she looked right at our table as she continued to chat and laugh and throw her head back as though her gigolo for the night was the most entertaining person in the world.  This lasted about another 10 minutes, at which point we were ready to hit our last resort--- the \"hog-and-jog\".  Perhaps she read our minds because just as we had decided collectively to leave (waiting 35+ minutes for a bill should never happen), she materialized with our bill. \nAs someone who has been a server many years of her life, I know a tip is a PRIVILEGE, not a RIGHT.  We declined to tip this waitress (something I haven't done in 7 years) for her hostile, inappropriate attitude, after which, she chased us down the front sidewalk demanding something be left for her.  She had zero class, zero dignity, and no clue.  I'd be embarrased for myself if I was stiffed and would never make an ass out of myself trying to chase down an unearned tip!!  I'd try it again if I could be reassured this person was no longer an employee, but til then...\nNEVER AGAIN!!!", "author": "Lea N."}

The very San Franciscan interior is a blend of vintage Victorian and neo-modern art - a perfect place for the proverbial artist in angst struggling to make a trendy living. The dark burgundy walls, artwork by unknown artists, funky mirrors, and paper lantern lamps (that give off very little light) all combine to further the cozy and trendy San Franciscan aura. There's a pool table in the back, but according to the pool mavens, the space is too cramped to be acceptable. The pool table suited me just fine, although apparently I have a lot to learn about playing pool.

After living a year in the Western Addition I figure I should check out some places in my hood.  He suggested \"Fly Bar\" and I said, \"perfect\".\n\nIt is a comfortable place. Dark, candle lit with art on the walls and music in the room makes you feel at ease the minute you walk in. This of course helped along by the fact that we easily found a table as it was late on a week night. I imagine if it were crowded and you were hungry it could be a different story. The place looked familiar and I might have gone there before I had moved to SF on a visit but I wasn't sure. My friend ordered the \"poor boy\" special to drink which left our waitress perplexed and agitated. She responded with a couple head shakes, eye squints and \"WHAT?\" 's. He responded with, \"you know what, um never mind...I'll have what she's having a...cab...\"\n\nApparently I had been there before just I had suspected. The place had been remodeled, the poor boy special was taken out and new paint was put on the walls. The place was looking good. Before we had even looked at the menu our waitress asked for our order. We asked for a minute to decide. We decided and then we talked about the place, the pool table, the art, the interesting people at the bar, the interesting people in our lives, interesting people in general but we hadn't talked about the food yet as the minute we asked for extended for quite some time. Our waitress may have forgotten about us. Or possibly was ignoring the person I was with for offending her by ordering something she had never heard of. I'll blame him because she was noticebly nicer to me. Finally we asked another server working if we could put an order in which she sweetly responded, \"yeah, no problem...sorry she's been busy today\" \n\nWe ordered the Chicken and goat cheese quesadilla and Thai Basil Chicken Pizzeta and the food was delicious and at the end of the night I was a happy girl.\n\nI would definitely go here again. Although our waitress was absent minded (even when we would try to engage in conversation or make her laugh it seemed to go right over her head) the food and atmosphere made up for it. \n\nI hope when I do go to Fly for dinner again (which I will) that I get the same server I'd like to believe she just had a bad day, or not.", "author": "kristen s."}

I've been back a few times since I and like what they've done to the place.  They have a cool concrete bar now, they got rid of the big silly fake cocktail menu on the wall, the music is better, the bartenders are great, AND they've added Hunter's Point Porter and Brother David's Double to the list of taps.

The crowd used to be more your fun locals, but now, though I still pop in about once every couple weeks for a beer and a bite, the scene has totally changed as they tried to make it swankier, the people are those boring cookie-cutter types who troll in from the Marina, from bridges, through tunnels, out of outer Sunset manholes. The kind of people who remind you of the people you were trying to never see again when you chose to move to San Francisco, (unless you were born here making you the only one ever). Guys who say bro, have matching colored shoes and shoelaces, tuck their t-shirts in, and probably tell girls they're 'producers,' cuz they recorded their friend's shitty hip-hop record on ProTools. Girls in slightly sideways baseball caps, probably own a small useless dogs, mouth the words to horseshit like Jay-Z and think they're slumming it at the Fly Bar.
