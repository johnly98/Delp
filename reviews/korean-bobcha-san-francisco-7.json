I ordered the BIBIMBOP with BULGOGI. It was huge! Lots of rice topped with shredded veggies, generous heaping of meat, and a fried egg (no extra cost). After tax it was only $12 and it was basically two portions. No extra cost unless you want to add Korean Fried Chicken as you protein (extra $1). Bulgogi meat was tender and well marinated. I loaded up on their orange sauce and a little red sauce.\n\nMy friends ordered the TOTS -- both Cali version and truffle bacon version.

Even though there were many people in line, they worked very efficiently and got the food out quickly. The lady who was taking orders was also calling our numbers for pickup, and she was a rockstar. We had a choice of three items and we could choose from three different proteins - bulgogi beef, spicy pork, sweet soy chicken. \n\nCup Bob - zucchini, lettuce, garlic and magic sauces over steamed rice\nBob Burrito - bacon kimchi fried rice, pineapple, sweet sour cream, lettuce, magic sauce\nBibim Bob - mushrooms, beansprouts, zucchini, red cabbage, carrots, and lettuce over steamed rice with fried egg on top and magic sauce\n\nConsensus was that the bulgogi meat was the tastiest, and the Bob Burrito was the favorite. The spiciness of the kimchi fried rice complemented the sweetness of the bulgogi, and the sweet sour cream they put in was a perfect addition that wasn't too tart like usual sour cream. Korean fusion and \"Korean Mexican\" isn't a new thing, but Korean Bobcha does it very well and we really enjoyed our lunch today. As this was a promotional event, I don't know what the normal price is for these items, but I would definitely choose this truck again if cost was reasonable.", "author": "Nicole M."}

Which is odd, since it doesn't seem like it's been all that long, but it kind of makes sense at the same time.  Now that I think about it, it does seem like it's been a while since I hunted down a truck to try.  I mean, it's not like there are places where food trucks congregate everyday.\n\nOh wait...\n\nAfter finally checking out SoMa StrEat Park (sidenote: my autocorrect is now forever ruined), I was eager to see what variety of trucks awaited us.  Unfortunately though, not many were still open when we arrived (it was only 8pm!), so our choice was essentially made for us.  However, even if that wasn't the case, we likely would have ended up at Bobcha anyways.  While the menu may be standard for a Korean food truck (Korean burritos, tacos, nachos, etc.), it was also the most appealing out of everything we saw.\n\n-- NACHOS - Bulgogi Beef, Kimchi, Lettuce, and Cheese on Tortilla Chips with Hot and Magic Sauces\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobcha-south-san-francisco?select=tuXgn9UbtKttgTgQGzK8eg)\nThis was one good looking order - a bed of tortilla chips covered with a generous mound of meat and cheese.  The bulgogi was juicy and tender and I liked the combination of the two sauces.  However, I wasn't a fan of the chips; the taste was mostly fine, but I wish they had been thicker, as it didn't take long for them to become soggy/flimsy.\n\n-- BOB BURRITO - Bacon Spicy Fried Rice, Lettuce, and a Choice of Meat (Bulgogi) with Magic Sauce\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobcha-south-san-francisco?select=WI6-2BkRMvSlgElGzmdGZg)\nIn hindsight, I should've tried another meat, but more of the bulgogi suited my taste buds just fine!  I liked the meaty, saltiness of the bacon as well, though the fried rice wasn't as spicy as I had hoped.  Still, everything was pretty good.  Just make sure to add kimchi (+$1)!  Sadly, I forgot to with mine and it really could've used that pungent acidity to balance out the flavors.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of Korean/Asian Fusion food trucks around the Bay Area, Bobcha is a pretty solid entry, albeit not super unique.  There may not be one signature dish or element to their food, but I thought the food was pretty solid overall, even if the chips still kind of bug me  In the end though, the most important thing is that, despite how they were one of the only available options available to us, they didn't let us down!", "author": "Mike L."}

Bobcha is one of the more satisfying options at SoMa StrEat, so I kept going back. \nUtilizing Korean ingredients in some type of burrito or taco is becoming ubiquitous, but this type of Asian fusion never appealed to me. Their menu options resembled that of a Mexican eatery, since most of the items include the same ingredients, just constructed in different ways. Same filling, w/ or w/o tortilla, you choose a meat option, pay an extra couple of bucks to add an egg. It didn't sound too exciting to me. Then I realized Bobcha serves food that just grows on you, like how some people can eat an entire bag of chips without even thinking about it. You may not love chips, but you keep going back.\nMr. Joy goes for Bobcha whenever we're at SoMa StrEat. No surprise there, he usually downs a bag of chips in one sitting too.\n\nBob Burrito w/ Bulgogi Beef - bacon spicy fried rice, lettuce, magic sauce:\nI tried a bite, not bad. Then another, pretty good. Would I get this again? Yes. A little spicy.\nI don't know what's in the magic sauce, but it is pretty sweet. Either that or it was just the bulgogi that was sweet. Bacon fried rice doesn't sound so exciting. I mean, I put bacon in my fried rice all the time, but it is pretty tasty too. I just didn't like the soggy lettuce in the burrito. The burrito just worked because the ingredients were seasoned well and full of flavor. Although I wouldn't mind if they took it down a notch with the sugar. \n\nCup Bob - lettuce over steamed rice, magic sauce:\nIt's what you'd expect, pretty much the same thing as the burrito sans tortilla. It's nice to order something from a food truck you can eat with a fork and spoon.\n\nKimchi Fries - bulgogi beef, kimchi, lettuce, melted cheese, magic & hot sauce over fries:\nMessy & gooey. You kind of need a fork for these, to be able to try the different ingredients in one bite. It was fun to try, but I wouldn't order it again. The spicy flavor and the tanginess of the kimchi kind of made the mixture taste a little like Frank's hot sauce. Does anyone else feel that way? Nope? Just me? Ok.\n\nSo it's pretty good for street food. I won't develop cravings for bulgogi beef in tortillas anytime soon, but the burritos are tasty. Not a bad price at around $9.

Every bite was full of bulgogi chicken and spicy bacon fried rice.   No fillers.  I'm definitely coming back for more of these!\n\nI'm glad to see that Bobcha has made these additions to their menu.  It may be jumping the shark a little bit, but their flavors still very unique to differentiate themselves from all the other Asian fusion food trucks out there.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Bobcha fulfills that concept with their Korean-style tacos and burritos. But they also offer burgers, nachos, fries, and the more conservative and traditional bibimbap.\n\nUnfortunately, if the \"Bob Burrito\" is reflective of the quality of Bobacha's other menu items, then I doubt I'd revisit this food truck any time soon. For nearly $11, the Bob Burrito contains spicy bacon fried rice, lettuce, and a choice of meat. I chose beef bulgogi for my meat and added a fried egg for an additional $1. The egg was decent, but cooked to a medium-well. The bulgogi was tasty, but salty and extremely greasy. And the spicy bacon fried rice added just a mild kick, though I wish there were more bacon pieces. The \"magic sauce\" they slathered all over the meat in the burrito made the entire meal ridiculously greasy and heavy. I ended up tossing the tortilla wrap because it was saturated with so much oil.\n\nI feel like Bobcha lost all aspects of Korean food by drenching everything with their magic sauce. It was quite disappointing, as I thought I'd really enjoy their food.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I was actually surprised at how much they gave us! For 10$, you do get your money's worth from the large portion size. Unfortunately though, the kimchee just didn't mix well with the fries. All the sauces together gave this interesting sweet flavor to the fries that just didn't taste like a natural kimchee sauce. It wasn't spicy nor was it flavorful. However, I did like the meat alongside the crispy fries but I probably wouldn't waste my time waiting in line for Bobcha.\n\nJust a sidenote, I like how they tried adding \"Bob\" to all their dishes, but they could totally be more creative (like Bobrito), but who am I to judge?\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I kind of stumbled across Bobcha by accident one day as I was heading to do an errand.  As I came across UN Plaza Off the Grid, I decided to do a bit of looking.  The line for Bobcha was short.  As it happened, I had tried Korean tacos recently for the first time at SAM's on Market.  Love the flavor.  Love Bulgogi.  Love whatever the crazy Korean Hot Sauce is.  (We'll come back to that.)  So, why not get some more K-Tacos.  I gave it a whirl, and it was one of those Magic moments where you take a bite of food and just say, \"****.  That was good.\"  They offer three choices of meat:  Ground Angus Bulgogi Beef, Pork and Chicken.  The tacos are corn, with a little rice, meat, cabbage, onion and a spicy sauce.  The order comes with two for $6.50, and you can add a third for $2 more (Do it).  If you have three, it's filling.  Now, the flavors are good - particularly the meat.  But, here is the kicker:  Magic Sauce.  It's Magic.  I'm not sure exactly what is in it - it's spicy and sweet.  I surmise that it is a combination of Sirancha and Hoisan Sauce.  But, it is a flavor explosion.  The Magic Sauce is the bomb.\n\nI've also tried the Bulgogi burger, which is a Bulgogi-marinated Patty with cheese, lettuce, onion and Magic Sauce.  I added the egg.  Very good, and for as much as it was dripping with flavor, it was surprisingly manageable  in a food truck setting.  (Note to Food Trucks:  Whatever kind of sandwich you serve, put it on bread/bun that is big enough to eat without the filling falling out and making a mess.)  \n\nThere are some other good things on the menu.  I hate to go back to work in the afternoon with an impending food-coma, but they also have delicious looking Bobcha Burritos - and I really want to try one with Kimchi and an Egg added.  Gotta head over to the weekend setup at SOMA Stre-eat Food Park.  \n\nMy one admonition:  Repeat factor.  Had Bobcha for the third time today.  It was still very good, but some of the luster came off knowing just how tasty it was going to be.  I'll also add that I can see how people could find the Magic Sauce a bit cloying, if the sweet/spicy thing isn't their thing.  That said, I think Bobcha delivers good food, reasonable prices for what you get, and I really think the service and staff are terrific.  Super nice.\n\nLiving in SF, I've had occasion to try a lot of good food - and a lot of good Asian food, in particular.  I won't lie, I'm not an expert.  5-Stars may be pushing it a little based on the lack of range I've had with Korean food.  That said, Bobcha gets to keep 5-Stars from me until I find the next level.  We'll see if it stays at 5-Stars.", "author": "Adam S."}

You just don't. Korean seemed a safe enough choice, so I made a snap decision. Dire hunger trumped my burgeoning Yelp snobbery (a.k.a. always consult Yelp before ordering). \n\nBobcha serves up Korean fusion fare in the form of burritos, burgers, tacos and rice bowls. I had the spicy pork bobcha tacos which came with spicy fried rice and shredded lettuce on a flour tortilla. The pork was tender and seasoned well, although maybe a tad too sweet for my liking. It certainly looked festive. The rice and spicy sauce blazed orange, the lettuce lent its happy green, and I had myself a Korean fiesta with every bite. Not too shabby for an impulse choice. Next time, I'm going for the bibim bob or maybe the bulgogi burger.", "author": "Racquel N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-27", "description": "I'm always open to trying new trucks and Bobcha seemed like a good bet at last night's OTG: North Beach. The Korean-inspired truck infuses their signature recipes to create such items as their bulgogi burger, as well as their own versions of burritos, tacos, and nachos. For most of their items, you pick your protein from a list including bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, spicy chicken and spicy pork. Bulgogi is a Korean sauce that tends to be on the sweet side.\n\nI know there's no such thing as eating healthy at OTG. Nevertheless I felt getting a Bobcha bowl might be a better choice than a sandwich from Five Ten Burger. The Cup Bob allows you to pick two proteins, which are then served with steamed rice and lettuce with their magic sauce. I chose the bulgogi beef and spicy chicken and paid the $1 surcharge for brown rice for a total of $8.75. Drinks were $1.50.\n\nA few minutes later, I got my box of food, which did look appetizing especially with their magic sauce. I was incredibly disappointed when I realized that half the box was filed with ground beef and not BBQ beef. The chicken was delicious. The beef I was not a fan of and ended up dumping out. I'm simply not a fan of ground beef. Once you get through your protein, you're rewarded with the steamed rice (brown rice in my case) and the lettuce.\n\nIt wasn't the best experience nor was it terrible. It's in the middle. I quickly ate through the delicious spicy chicken and brown rice, but the lettuce didn't add much to the overall box and felt like filler just to add volume. And for $8.75 I was left hungry and was back in line, but this time at Five Ten Burger.", "author": "Alexander E."}

Pretty standard prices, but I LOVED how big the portions was. You will be getting your money's worth. \n\nI had the Bob Burrito, bacon Korean fired rice, choice of meat, and lettuce. Let's just say you should be ready to eat because it was huge!  I added the egg and the kimchi to get the whole experience. Definitely recommend to spend the extra on the egg and the kimchi. As far as the rice, I thought it was a let down and over hyped. I felt that it was just rice that was tossed in the House sauce that's on the meat. \nThe flavors are well balanced thanks to the sourness of the kimchi and the richness with the egg, everything just complements each other. Personally with out the kimchi and egg, it would be too boring because all you taste is the Korean sauce (the Korean ketchup).\n\nPro- great deal/big portion, solid Korean flavors.\n\nCon- nothing stands out as far as Special bacon Korean Fried Rice. The three meats all taste the same. \n\nFood -3/5\nService - 5/5\nOverall - 4/5 \n\nIf you are hungry and want a well rounded Korean burrito, I would come here in a heartbeat.

NorCal first had its taste at the newfound fusion delicacy with the Bulgogi truck; however now that the Bulgogi truck vanished in nothingness and MogoBBQ 's popularity declining we feel like the days of the Korean Mexican fusion are gone with the wind.  Here's where Bobcha came in - rather than approaching the scene with a \"cool/hype\" vibe, Bobcha presents itself as a Mom + Pop Korean Fusion truck.  While MogoBBQ relied much on image and \"hit and miss\" menu items, Bobcha lets its items do the talking.   I tried the beef and the pork burritos and both of them were excellent!
