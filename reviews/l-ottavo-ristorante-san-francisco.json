On a Saturday night when the place was hot and crowded, service was accurate and reasonably attentive, but you could tell they were rushed.\n\nI had a caprese salad with thin, somewhat anemic looking tomato slices, though I liked getting a few thin rings of red onion and two anchovies. \n\nThe veal Marsala with mushrooms had what I'm fairly sure were canned mushrooms and a sweet sauce that tasted more like the brown sauce from a Chinese restaurant than a decent Marsala sauce. There's no way they use any actual real Marsala wine. \n\nThe wines I ordered, a vermentino and a barbera, were poor examples of both, and overpriced for the quality and the size of the pours. \n\nThe dish of vanilla gelato for dessert was the best part of the meal. \n\nThe place was crowded and apparently popular, which I'm afraid I can't account for. I figured San Franciscans had better taste in restaurants. I suspect it's a lot of tourists -- I notice that most of the reviews here are from out of towners.", "author": "Steve S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-11", "description": "This is probably one of the finest Italian restaurants we have been so far. We went there for a dinner and had a great time, of course at the cost of a big hole in our pocket. \n\nFood:\nWe had Bruschetta, Ravioli Di Spinachi, a classic Tiramisu and the Dessert of the day (Cannoli) and none of them disappointed. Bruschetta were good - nothing too facy or overdone but just right. Ravioli Di Spinachi was amazing. Filling was good and the parmesan sauce was brilliant. What blew away our mind was Tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. It is a must try and a disappointment if you're planning Italian desserts and not ordering Tiramisu. Cannoli was good but not so much that it goes into the list of Dessert of the Day. \nOverall, the food was quite above the benchmark but it is quite heavily priced too, so be ready to sign a big check at the end. \n\nAmbiance: \nThe place is a little dark. Perhaps a little more bright light will give it a better feeling. Not much cramped and very comfortable seating - more like restaurants which are meant for fine dining. Given that we went on a weekday night, it wasn't much crowded. \n\nService:\nThe service was good and quick. The food took reasonable time to come. But if you're in a rush, this restaurant is not for you. The staff is good overall - no bad experience as such. \n\nOverall, if you're in San Francisco, this restaurant is a must try if you want to taste some real good Italian.", "author": "Jay M."}

The food is always guaranteed to be delicious and the service is always on point as well.

They'll even play around with the menu to cater to what you're craving.. one time I couldn't decide between the Chicken Marsala or a noodle dish, so they created a mixture of the two for me! \nThere's really something to be said for authenticity, and L'Ottavo has it. Their food is very classic Italian food, like an old style Italian family type restaurant. \nThey also have super authentic desserts that are PERFECTION. Their gelato is seriously so good and well balanced (proportion and flavor profile), and their cannoli special.. not on the regular menu, but it's a dessert special they always run.. super authentic, my favorite cannolis in town! \nHonestly, I regularly think about coming here just to eat cannolis and have a glass of wine.", "author": "Traci A."}

I had a chance to try a few dishes: the Beef Carpaccio, Mixed Salad and the Lasagna Bolognese. All were great. My wife loved her Minestrone soup and for dessert, we enjoyed 3 scoops of Gelato. \n\nThere is another reason that I gave five stars: my wife is sensitive to gluten, which makes it very difficult to eat at Italian restaurants. At this restaurant they offer most pasta dishes with gluten free pasta. The minestrone was sans gluten as well, which was great for my wife. \n\nLastly, I'm not sure why so many people gave bad reviews, but our experience was great overall.", "author": "Paz E."}

All other waitstaff I observed seemed to know what they were doing and able to convey information to the customers. I'm giving this a 4 star review purely for the restaurant.

Maybe the food is better if you eat it on location?\n\nFor the pasta we ordered the Fettuccine Special and Bolognese. I'll start by saying this was probably hands down, the worst pasta we'd ever eaten. It was horrifically overcooked to mush and the sauce on both dishes were broken.\n\nThe fettuccine sauce was completely separated and had a mealy texture, I have no idea how this could have been considered alfredo. It also said it was made with prosciutto but it honestly had the flavor of a dry aged salami. The bolognese barely had any meat in the little sauce that was with pasta. It lacked seasoning, was very bland and acidic.\n\nAlong with the pasta we ordered the Bruschetta and Caprese salad. Bruschetta actually wasn't too bad. By far, the best dish of the entire order. The caprese was just, so-so. The cheese had a strange texture and the tomatoes tasted a bit old, they were soft and mealy.\n\nDefinitely a pass on this for us next time, at least with delivery. We chose this place specifically because it had so many decent reviews, I wish we'd have gotten to try their food.\n\n$96.00 on 4 menu items for delivery. Fuck that.", "author": "Seth H."}

I didn't need my knife at all. The pasta on the side was also perfectly cooked. Very good marinara too! They said their dessert special was cannolis so I gave it a shot.

Now I was with a friend so this dinner was by no means supposed to be romantic but it ruined the atmosphere. For this, I blame the staff for not correcting the disgusting party of 6 before they received their $275 bill....hmmmm, maybe that had something to do with it. \n\nAnyway, the food was good, but nothing to write home about.

Reading through the reviews we were expecting more.  The food was nice enough, but nothing really special, and, the wine & beer choices were not the greatest.   We arrived at 6:00 PM with Open Table reservations, and were directed to a table in the back by the kitchen door.  The restaurant was quite full with the exception of two large tables being held for large parties of 8 - 10.  We therefore opted to sit at their small bar that had five bar stools.  Incidentally I would like to mention that the two large empty tables remained empty until we left.  In all fairness, I will say that the spinach salad was quite good.  I had pasta, and my husband had the grilled chicken breast.  It was just a bit weird to us that not one of the waitpersons was Italian.  Too bad, it was a cute restaurant.", "author": "MandL C."}

Then the special Lasagna Bolognese, amazing!  My daughter had the bruchetta, excellent, and the prawns and scallops in an herbed white wine sauce with vegetables - also amazing!  And finally, the Tiramisu which is made here - wow!  We shared but I could have had one of my own for sure.  Portions are good sized, not too much, not too little.  Prices are fair for SF.  All in all, a great dinner and we're both looking forward to going back.\n\nI don't know what some of these people who gave it less than 3 stars were expecting, the setting is charming, the service is acceptable, and the food was really delicious.

Well all the brothers can be a bit much to feed so we didn't want to go anywhere with million dollar micro plates. We decided to go for a walk. \n\nThe concierge directed us to a fairly stark chinese restaurant. We all stared at the blindingly bright interior and decided it was not going to host the family dinner we were after. So we turned around a bit, saw some twinkley lights and walked towards them. \n\nOur group of 7 was promptly seated and a round of drinks ensued. We got some bread and beers. Not bad, not bad. Ordered some appetizers. The bruschettas were yummy. We really enjoyed the clams and mussels special. Lots of mussels and a nice, light tomato garlic sauce which was awesome with the bread. \n\nThe menu was pretty straight forward. I ended up getting the chicken bruna. It is basically chicken marsala but the sauce was reduced to a glazed and tasted better than any of my attempts at home. The lobster ravioli was a hit, 3 people at our table got it. Pops got the lasagna and he was a happy man. \n\nThe food is good. Not phenomenal but not offensive. The service was fine for us and our waiter made sure we were well supplied. They kept the beers coming and were good about picking up the many dishes we generated. The carafe of water was left at the table which, as wasteful as it is, I like because I am a big girl and can pour my own water when I am thirsty. I drink a lot of water so perhaps this is not a quality that others will appreciate. I did. We lingered over dinner and it did take a bit to get the entrees but with good company who really cares? \n\nI don't think I would make a special trip over to the madness of Union Square just for this place but I will keep it on the radar for other visitors.", "author": "colleen b."}

Repeat customers are few and far between, no doubt, so your server isn't going to give two shits, I assure you.\n\nIt took a good 15 minutes for anyone to greet us despite the fact that the place was virtually empty. When he did arrive all he muttered was, \"ready to order?\" I got a chicken dish with what he called \"potatoes and vegetables\" (no more specific than that), and the boyfriend got seafood pasta. The food was serviceable, but horribly overpriced. I got, literally, one and a half small new potatoes and a pittance of carrots and peppers.

The linguine pescatore was served with a generous helping of mussels, clams, prawns, and salmon in a white wine marinara sauce. Both the seafood and the pasta were cooked perfectly, and weren't overpowered by garlic, as seems to be the trend these days.\n\nThe spinach salad was also good.

That seems like a huge difference, you say! No... no, it isn't. Not at L'Ottavo. There's garlic hanging from the ceiling, dim lighting that is suspiciously fluorescent, austerely rustic decor, and (usually) few diners. It's half creepy, half authentic. I still can't decide. \n\nI do recommend it for groups of three and up... It seems like a restaurant where you have to bring the party, and they'll just serve the scrumptiousness. I don't think I would come here on a date or with just one other person, unless you're hoping to bore them right into their spaghetti -- although it certainly gives the opposite impression from the outside.\n\nTo be honest, it's been a while, so I don't remember what the service was like: I am a huge customer service freak, though, and I don't particularly recall feeling disgruntled after my visit, so I assume it wasn't too bad. I do, however, fondly remember the satiated feeling with which I walked out! I believe some of the favorites amongst my party were the Linguine Carbonara, Insalata Capricciosa, Fettuccine con Gambari, and the home-made tiramisu for dessert.\n\nIf you live in the area, I suggest you give this place a shot -- it has enough potential to pleasantly surprise you. If you're just passing by the neighborhood or are a tourist, however, I think there are plenty of safer bets to be made elsewhere in the area.", "author": "G. J."}

Well, we used it Saturday night and in a few words: Place was pretty empty for a Saturday night - bad sign. Then when I saw them carrying a big bag of bagged lettuce to the front - where someone was prepping salads I knew we had a problem....The good news - they grill seafood okay. No seasoning but seemingly fresh and grilled fine. The salad was heavily overdressed ($12-14), the bread on the table - pedestrian, and the entrees - bland at best - old school grilled steak with too much mushroom sauce - the quality of the steak was so-so (for $30+ dollars) and the Grilled seafood (also close to $30) - pretty plain with boring sauteed veggies on both plates - identical ! We avoided carbs so not sure what the pasta tastes like. Dessert (so much for those carbs) was tiramasu ($8) - and it was actually the highlight of the meal. No one asked if we wanted coffeee and I took that to mean - pass on it. All and all - hardly worth the $40 we paid (plus 18% tip enforced through Bloomspot purchase). We won't return and I suggest that you seriously consider avoiding this joint as well. Plenty of better places in the city.

I stopped in with my Fiancee and future Mother in Law on her visit.  I don't think any of us were especially hungry, it was more of a formality, last meal to see her off, we all pretty much went with soups and salads.\n\nThe soups were good from what I gathered, the salads were mediocre, the killer was the shoddy portions and exorbitant prices for what you get.  I was in a seafood mood, and since I wasn't paying, I couldn't bring myself to order anything off the menu other than a salad with prices all at a minimum of $22 an entree.  The Seafood salad sounded fancy enough on the menu, but what I got was barely appetizing, and almost had to force it down, the shrimp was obviously of the frozen variety, rubbery and tasteless, dressing was unmemorable.\n\nI couldn't recommend it unless you wanted to pay too much for lesser quality, I hope there are better options for Italian than this in San Francisco.

The lights are low, tables are spaced well, the prices are reasonable and the service just right.\r\n\r\nI almost always order off their specials menu. Which, seems to feature the same specials every time. Start off with the Crab Bisque. It's creamy and actually has good amount of shredded crab. If you're picky about presentation, close your eyes and have a friend spoonfeed you.\r\n\r\nNow move on to the Capresse salad. It's a simple salad that is difficult, but not impossible, to screw up. L'Ottavo makes a fine one. Good sized, properly proportioned serving. You'll have to request anchovies, which i believe are crucial, otherwise their left off.\r\n\r\nFor the entree, I usually order the Red Snapper special. Served in a well balanced white wine lemon butter sauce, side of roasted veggies and yummy mashed potatoes.

Well, the salads are small for the price, but sufficient. The bruschetta might be good for someone who really loves garlic, but a tad heavy on the garlic for my liking. The Pescatorre Linguini was nothing to brag about, sauce was rather bland, and I felt as if I could have made something much better at home in a 15 minutes and for a tiny fraction of the price.

I'm sorry to say that I was rather disappointed.  They could've had an off night...maybe our waiter had just broken up with his girlfriend...I dunno...but I don't think it's worthy of 4 stars.\n\nFirst, we got there right as the place opened on Saturday evening (5 p.m.).  No, I'm not 80 years old and no, I was not looking for the early bird special...my mom, my sisters and I had just caught a matinee performance of \"Jersey Boys\" (which I HIGHLY recommend, by the way) and decided to get an early dinner.\n\nThey seated us, no problem.  They handed us our menus, no problem.  Then we waited...and waited...until they finally came to take our order 15 minutes later.  We ordered 4 salads and 2 pasta dishes to split.  Plus, I ordered a glass of wine.\n\nWe got: 2 salads split 4 ways (which makes for an incredibly small salad) and my wine never showed up.  I had to ask for it again right before our pasta came.\n\nThe salad (though minuscule in size) was tasty.  The pasta (I think it was fettuccine with chicken and eggplant) tasted like something I had whipped up on a Wednesday night after a long day at work.  In other words, it was nothing special.\n\nSo, by this time, we had eaten a handful of spinach and a handful of pasta and were still feeling rather peckish, so we ordered dessert.  It was a chocolate torte-ice cream-thing and was, by far, the only redeeming aspect of our dinner.\n\nSorry L'Ottavo...but your sucky service overshadowed your yummy dessert so I have to give you 2 stars.", "author": "Piper H."}

They had no problem taking a group on a friday night although it's a small place. We had 10 people and it was great. Everyone enjoyed their dinners- 4 of us had the spinach ravioli, which was super yummy! We had the different types of bruschetta (some were on the specials menu) and also got some good wine. Perfect if you are looking for an intimate setting with affordable prices and quality Italian food.", "author": "Iguana G."}

The bad news is there is a reason why :-) I've eaten here a number of times (usually last minute when there are lines at other Union Square eateries) because honestly, it is not bad. It's a decent place. And I continue to return because it is good - again, not great. Service is OK, but not great by SF standards. The food is OK , but not great by SF standards. Do I sound confused? I guess I am but trust me, the three stars is deserved. If it's a first date or an important dinner meeting go somewhere else. If it's a few casual friends or a family night night out you'll be fine and won't be disappointed.", "author": "M D."}

The young woman serving is charming but she simply can't handle the volume (this was a Sunday night). The guy behind the bar is a surly jerk (ignores customers, never smiles, refused to send the check). I suppose he thinks everyone's a tourist so why bother being nice as they'll never come back. Too bad for him, as we are locals and we were a group of eight - but after the lousy service (and his rudeness) we won't come back. There are plenty of places to have good and authentic Italian food - and places that make you feel welcome. This guy ruins it for me.", "author": "Jessica V."}

We were greeted with buona sera and immediately seated at a perfect table for two. The place was lovely. Lighting perfect. A very clean feel. Service great. Our server was very personable and professional. Our salads were served with gorganzola ( this was not represented on the menu) which would cause my husband horrific problems. When this was brought to her attention she immediately corrected the problem but also asked what other cheese may be a problem.  We had the house white wine which was delightful. I ordered the penne special: sundried tomatoes, broccoli, italian sausage. It was perfect. My husband had the homemade cannelloni with spinach. Again delicious. The soft crusty bread was served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar but the addition of sundried tomatoes plus other seasonings was a treat. We are looking forward to a second visit.", "author": "Marlene M."}

We had to wait about 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table to say hello, longer until bread was given. There were only 2 or 3 other couples in the whole restaurant, which was otherwise eerily empty, so it's not like the servers had anything else to do. I asked the waiter for some recommendations, for what's fresh and special, and he was dumbfounded by the question, and flipped it back to me saying I should just order what I want to eat. So, I ordered \"home made\" linguini with a tomato-anchovy sauce. The tomatoes were from a can, the olives also were old and cheap, and there were no anchovies discernible anywhere on the dish. The pasta didn't taste fresh or home made. The plate was a bunch of dead, worn out ingredients with no flavor or vibrancy whatsoever. The wine list, also, was tired and uninspiring. I did have a crab bisque that was not terrible, but far from noteworthy. And, for this, it was way, way, way overpriced. There is simply no reason for this place to exist and even more, no reason for anyone to waste money and time going to this crap-hole when there are so many special places to try in San Francisco.", "author": "Eater S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-22", "description": "The description of the two star is pretty much dead on while describing this place... \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  It took a while to be greeted and get a table when we walked in, and even longer for someone to actually take our order.  I ordered the bruchetta for a starter, and the spinach salad for dinner (I wasn't really feeling all that hungry).  My husband ordered the special pasta.  Well, when we got our food (finally) he was given his overly greasy pasta with little flavor, and I was given my salad.  Apparently they had forgotten the bruchetta... since I wasn't that hungry anyway, I canceled it.  Well, since they had already made it, they gave it to me for free..... but it was awful.  It was hot (which really takes away from the \"fresh\" feeling of the bruchetta), was overwhelmed with raw garlic, and was SPICY.  There was nothing to indicate this on the menu, and I can't eat spicy food.  SO glad I didn't have to pay for that.  My salad was good but needed something... perhaps blue cheese or feta, something with a little more flavor.  \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't come back unless someone else really wanted to eat there and I was along for the ride.", "author": "Jo P."}

This place is a solid 3.5 but I'm in a decent mood, so I've rounded up.  I came here last weekend for a friend's birthday party and they were very accomodating with our large group of 12.  I ordered the linguine carbonara which was rich and creamy and quite good.  I also shared part of a veal dish with capers and butter sauce.  The veal was pretty forgettable.  All I could taste was the acidity of the capers and not much else.  It could've used a little more salt or butter to balance it out a bit more.  While I didn't partake in the desserts, it seemed most everyone that did was pleased with their offerings.  The service was pretty smooth.   Our waitor was attentive, waters kept full and food arrived promptly and hot.  I don't know if I would ever make a trip out here specifically, but I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here again if I were in the neighborhood.", "author": "Gary L."}

Sadly, I was not there on a date, but with a group of 10.  We ended up over here after a couple of tropical drinks at the Fairmont.  We were hungry.  At first we couldn't decide and stood outside the door debating whether we wanted to go in here, or somewhere else, but finally took the plunge.  We had to wait a little bit for our table to be set up, but that's no problem and to be expected.  Our waiter was very nice.  The bread and oil was delicious, and my spinach ravioli very tasty.  I think everyone enjoyed their dishes.  I left before dessert and coffee, but it was the sort of place where you could linger and chat and nobody made you feel rushed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-20", "description": "My husband and I were in the area for a show and we decided to try Fino.  Unfortunately we couldn't get in until 8:30 and the show started at 8.  I usually rely heavily on yelp, but we decided to stroll and just find a place in the neighborhood.  We stumble on L'Ottavo, and we were initially hesitant because at 6:30 on a Sat. there were maybe two people dining.  But we wanted Italian and decided to try it.  We weren't disappointed.  Our waitress was super nice and when we asked for recommendations she told us which dishes had house made pasta and told us what we could swap out if we were interested in other sides.  She seemed reasonable and accomodating.  I wanted about 12 items but settled on the lasagna.  I also had the salad misto.  My husband ordered a chicken special with penne in a cream sauce and the minestrone.  The salad was good and it had a bit of gorgonzola, so it was exactly what I wanted.  We both loved the minestrone.  It was more of a stew than a soup, chock full of perfectly cooked fresh vegetables and a chunk of cheese in the center.  The portion was also huge and really could have been a meal in and of itself.  They also served a fantastic warm bread incredibly crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The dipping sauce was oil, balsamic vinegar, sundried tomatoes, and spices.  As for entrees they were both great but the lasagna was the clear winner.  I have never had better in a restaurant.  Neither of us managed to finish our entrees, so I thought everything was more than adequately portioned, though I guess our chains have got us expecting about three meals worth of italian on one plate.  The prices seemed reasonable for the area, quality of food, and portion size and I think they were slightly cheaper than Fino.  I don't think any entree went above $26, including seafood, veal, and steak.  I didn't see the wine list but my husband ordered a lovely Barbera and the price seemed reasonable for the bottle.  As for the decor, to each his own.  It felt quaint and romantic to me and reminded me of some very cute, authentic restaurants we have gone to in NYC.  By the time we left the place had filled up and there appeared to be a waiting list, so apparently we had just gotten lucky in our timing.", "author": "Jennifer C."}
