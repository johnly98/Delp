This place is a testament to the barista. \n\nThe cafe doubles as a ratty motorcycle repair shop or personal collection of vintage bikes. Having a similar attraction to broke down things that I will hopefully one day repair I wouldn't be surprised if the owner found the 2 group Vega machine he uses on craigslist for $100 along with the osteria grinder and brought them back to life to create this delicious nectar.\n\nHonestly the first time I got a cappuccino I didn't check out his gear and left thinking, \"oh well he's probably got a La Marzocco Linea or something. I mean how else could you get a shot so pure, not sour, not bitter.\" And that's because I'm an ignorant idiot. Judging a shop by it's machine is like, well, judging anything by how much money they spend on their crap. Doesn't automatically equate to quality. \n\n2nd time around I was surprised to see the tools matched the decor. I then bowed down and realized how shallow I had become in my coffee snobbery. Granted something has to work properly to create good things but that doesn't mean you need the latest and greatest. This is a true testament to the artist and not the tool. Like when you look at a wonderful photo your friend took and exclaim, \"dude that Canon 5D is amazing.\"\n\nLet this be a lesson to all of us. Go here. Get some coffee. Let the man do his job and remember it's not the tools that do the job it's the artist.\n\nOh yeah and what people say is somewhat true though, he doesn't chit chat really.

The menu is short and sweet and the decor is pretty cool- who doesn't like vespas? Being from out-of-town, I'm accustomed to everywhere taking Visa or debit, so it was kind of a shock for me to order a latte, have it served, and then realize that I had no cash and couldn't pay! Shoot.\n\nHowever, the guy who made my latte said \"pay for it tomorrow!\" and I think I looked at him like he had ten eyeballs. He was trusting a total stranger. That is so surreal.\n\nI did come back the next day, cash in tow to pay my debt, and got another amazing, perfectly-poured latte. There is something about the magic of 'blue bottle coffee' that makes me want to live in SF forever. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because their hours are a bit limited- 7:30am till 4pm on weekdays and 10am to 3pm on Saturdays.", "author": "stephanie v."}
