It would be a great place for someone with experience to open a restaurant. From my vantage point, what's needed is good management and an effort to create some ambiance. There's absolutely no reason to stop there for drinks, although they offer a beautiful outdoor seating area that is heated on chilly San Francisco days, there's no music or personality to the space. And, the service staff seldom works to sell anything, but rather acts only as order-takers. You're likely to hear \"Are you ready?' instead of 'Hi, I'm Troy. I'll be your server. We have a vegetable soup today and a special crepe. But before you decide on what you would like to eat, would you like me to bring you something to drink?\"\n\nEverything wrong about this place could easily be repaired by good governance and management. \n\nThe French fries that accompany the tuna or salmon sandwiches are, despite everything else, super tasty and worth a try.", "author": "Scott A."}

I would suggest if the cook can use something to soak up the water before it's served that's ideal. Otherwise using all fresh ingredients would be definitely recommended.

They have a reasonably large breakfast menu full of scrambles, omelettes, benedicts and of course, crepes. We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning after walking by it every day for the last month. It was reasonably busy each time so we figured it couldn't be bad. The space is big with a really nice back patio. You place orders at the counter and then your food is brought out to you as it's ready.\n\nI ordered the Baja scramble without cheese which came with a side of wheat toast and subbed fruit for the potatoes with a coffee to drink. My boyfriend ordered the Barcelona crepe which came with a side salad and a side of potatoes. Both were close to $15 with a side of fruit being an extra $1 and coffee $2.50. The food took about 10-15 minutes which was very reasonable. The coffee was brought to me pretty fast and the staff was very good on keeping my coffee refilled which I appreciated.\n\nThe food itself was okay. The portions were MASSIVE. My scramble was pretty greasy and I really felt like it needed the cheese to cut through the grease. The sub of fruit was a fair value for the $1 but compared to the portions you get on the potatoes, it seems a little skimpy. The Barcelona Crepe was pretty good so I probably would go with a crepe next time. The salad that came with it was adequate and the potatoes were okay, nothing special.\n\nOverall, I would come back but I can't say it would be my first choice. The patio is beautiful and the menu is varied and reasonable. For a treat, I want to come back and try one of their dessert crepes which look heavenly.", "author": "Carrie W."}

And the food quality--never even--has become mediocre. The whole feel became \"we don't care.\" \n\nBut now it has new owners and table service is back. The menu has changed to be about burgers and similar lunch fare, less about breakfast and brunch. On the weekends, brunch is still on. There are still some of the old egg and crepe menu items from before, and the decor is nicer. But the food remains mediocre, sometimes bad. Egg dishes seem the iffiest; today, a friend's crab cake Benedict came with the egg whites uncooked and the crab cake burned on one side. All our hash browns were very undercoooked and flavorless; I suspect they were microwaved. The crepes were OK, but just that. The scramble was also OK. The fruit cup was all unripe fruit. Flavor is lacking all around.\n\nIt's clear the new owners are trying to recover from years of neglect. It's also clear that the cooking remains weak. For a restaurant, that's unacceptable.\n\nFortunately, there are several other good places in the area like Novy to try instead.", "author": "Galen G."}

We've heard a lot of good things from whom we spoke personally with friends that actually ate there.  Well, it was our turn and we weren't disappointed. \n\nWe were greeted and seated in a more quiet section in front of the restaurant. Menus were delivered and there is a good variety of options.  I chose from the dinner special:  Hanger Steak that came with two sides of my choice, which I chose the Caesar Salad and Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  That with a glass of wine.  \n\nThe salad came first and was fresh and large, nicely tossed with fresh cheese garnish. Sometimes you take a chance at ordering steak but this was really good.  Cooked medium as I like, the meat was actually very tender and quite tasty and the sauce that complimented the meat was not overpowering.  The mashed potatoes are from fresh potatoes I think since the freshness and texture of the potatoes were evident. \n\nThe other order is the Sonoma, a grilled chicken sandwich on a bun.  The chicken was tender and it was served with a side of fries . . . long big fries unlike McD's. \n\nOverall the experience was great:  good food, good service. Unhurried and relaxed.

They slathered the same color of bright off white paint over every wall and the ceiling without any thought to ambiance or design.    It felt cold and uninviting.

The food is mostly still of the same quality, but this whole order-at-the-counter-and-take-a-number thing takes it from a nice sit-down breakfast/lunch place to a low-brow cafeteria.  Unfortunately, the prices did not adjust accordingly, and asking me about a tip before the food even arrives is just not a good idea.\n\nSorry Savor.  I *heart* you and I miss you, but I'm just going to say \"no\" to this change.  If cash flow was a problem, I wish you had opted instead to raise your food prices to keep the servers.

It was a great choice! Great service, great atmosphere and great food. I had a chicken breast sandwich with Brie, arugula and apples. It came with a side of fries ( best fries I have ever had, crispy, golden and fried to perfection!) I normally control myself ( trying to keep the weight down) and I indulged and ate ALL the fries. The salad the sandwiches come with-YES you get a salad AND fries ( I'm used to places making you choose between one and the other) was amazing. The homemade house dressing is spectacular. I was happy to be 35,000 feet in the air enjoying the other half of my sandwich since j ate all the salad and fries with half my sandwich at lunch and was content.\n\nIt's a great place for kids with a great menu ( breakfast and lunch items: scrambled eggs, pancakes, Mac n cheese, grilled cheese, ect )\n\nYou can bring your fur babies here too because there is a back patio that is covered.

We ordered at the same time, however her food came out a full 5 minutes before mine. She ordered off the breakfast menu, I got a sandwich. While I was waiting i decided to order a drink so I had to leave the table and go back and stand in line. My food finally arrived and my french fries were cold. Since there was no server to check on the meal I just didn't eat most of them. I did flag down a server to ask for a straw for my drink and rather than an actual straw she brought me 3 skinny cocktail straws. \n\nI am so disappointed.

They do have a New Orleans (benedict with crab cakes) that I've seen my friends order and be satisfied with it. All their breakfast specialties come with a little cup of fruit and potatoes which is nice. If you aren't feeling their breakfast specialties, they have your usual omelettes, scrambles, french toast, sandwiches, and alcoholic beverages like bloody marys or mimosas.\n\nOverall, I haven't found this place somewhere I would frequent often or go out of my way for because to me, their food is sort of average and something I can find at other brunch places. Be prepared to also spend a little more than $15 if you want something good here. What I do like about this place is that they have outdoor patio seating (which is nice!) and so far I haven't had to wait very long to get seated.

I learned later that Savor and Crepevine are owned by the same family/management; while Crepevine's food has never been up to par for me, I have to say Savor was far more impressive in both their dishes and ambiance. \n\nMy friend and I tried the Noe Valley sandwich (grilled chicken breast, arugula, apples, brie, sundried tomato aioli on a dutch crunch roll; served with a side of thick fries) and the Santorini crepe (walnuts, pistachios, brown sugar, coconut, cinnamon and mascarpone). \n\nThe sandwich was pretty decent - while the filling was quite rich and the apples & brie paired together nicely, the dutch crunch was not heated properly and ended up being cold. The side of fries was fantastic - thick cut, hot, Goldilocks-approved salt content. The sweet crepe was a little TOO sweet for my liking. \n\nMy favorite part about Savor is the adorable backdoor covered patio - on a warm day, it's a perfect way to relax and mingle.

A lot of the previous wait staff had been there for years and always greeted us and all the other familiar faces with warmth. And the service was always fine, since everybody on the floor backed one another up - meaning us diners would always get any needs met quickly even if the place was packed.\n\nHowever, since the menu looked largely the same, and I understand the financial pressure on restaurants these days - especially affordable and dependable ones - we just followed the new protocol and ordered.\n\nThe bean chili has always provided a delicious alternative to heavier fare - and we each got a cup of that and split a turkey sandwich. Sadly, the chili was without any flavor at all - just a little bit of heat. Salt did nothing to brighten it up. The sandwich was also lower in grade. There was a deli-level over-abundance of sliced turkey - which I guess is fine if you like deli food - and there the tomato slices (one full slice of a small tomato accompanied by a quarter-slice of another) were a bit beyond skimpy.\n\nThe french fries that come with the sandwich are now beer-battered, and that created an OK crunch - but did nothing to spark up the flavor.\n\nAfter the food was delivered, follow-up service was non-existent.\n\nOn leaving, we both agreed we probably won't return unless we hear that things have improved.", "author": "Ben B."}

Definitely a couple of notches above a Crepevine, Savor is exactly the kind of cozy neighborhood place you want to have as your go-to place when your parents unexpectedly drop by from, say, Los Banos. No, it's not a cutting-edge culinary destination for your hipster pals who want to head downtown afterward and go clubbing. I don't live in Noe Valley, so I didn't know it was already a brunch staple. Jamie W. and I headed here for dinner after inadvertently catching the J train in search of dinner on a weeknight. It turned out to be an unassuming winner.\n\nWe started with sharing a $9 Spanakopita that came accompanied with quite a serving of hummus, pickled vegetables, cubes of feta cheese, and a big round of pita (see photos). The spanakopita was really well put together, all crispy and savory, and the hummus was very fresh with a swirl of virgin olive oil on top. Show-off that he is, Jamie went lighter than me on his entree with the $11.50 Tuscan Chicken, which came already sliced with fries and a side salad (see photo). It was flavorful, filling stuff.\n\nAt the same time, I'm still glad I went with the $18 Hangar Steak, medium rare and hearty-good with a mushroom au jus ladled all over it. As unadventurous as Savor is, the creamy mashed potatoes and mixed vegetable medley were just what I wanted that evening (see photo). Service was attentive, and Diet Coke refills came without provocation. They serve good stuff here, unexpectedly solid for a longtime place with such a low profile elsewhere in the city. Their brunch may be more famous, but dinner is definitely worth a try here.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid Mediterranean and American plates for the hearty appetite\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...on the dark side but the noise level ain't bad\nSERVICE - 4 stars...good people doing their job well\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a neighborhood place worth a cross-town visit", "author": "Ed U."}

They are the first and last impression of your restaurant. Each time I walk in I have to greet the hostess, they don't greet me. As a hostess you need to be confident and know what's going on in the restaurant. \nToday I watched a guest have to run around the restaurant to get a time estimate for an indoor table. The guest should not be doing the grunt work, they're here for a relaxing experience. \nToday the hostess walked us back to our table and failed to even hold the heavy door leading out to the back patio and so the door flung back on me as she rushed through it.

Do not go if you believe you deserve some respect from management in a restaurant. Manager at Savor is nice on the outside but a huge Jerk in reality. This is down the street from me and I enjoyed the food here for years, not amazing but pretty good, but had a horrible experience on my last visit for takeout on an evening in December. I was asking the hostess, who was about to process my payment, if there were any good condiments that go well with the crepes. She didnt seem to speak perfect English and didnt seem to understand (Nothing against her, she seemed nice), so I rephrased and still didnt seem to process. I tried to explain 1 last time, simply asking if they recommend any sauces that could accompany the crepes, and was gonna leave it alone, when suddenly the Manager (please don't say this isn't pc.. but he was Middle Eastern looking guy with longish hair), ran up aggressively yelling at me that I need to leave and stop giving his employees a hard time, that Im always causing trouble.. on and on.. I was dumbfounded, embarrassed and felt terrible. (Over the past year or so had some iffy experiences where for instance my wife and I ordered in dinner and when I came 35 min later to pick it up it appeared the host didnt input my order and forgot what it was, and had to start from scratch. Was late and we were so hungry, but they just shrugged it off, and I didn't even make a big fuss less a brief dialogue that I was not happy about it. Any good restaurant would have recognized that screw up and would care more about pleasing the customer... and a couple times there were minor things like we were overcharged, or they took the order down wrong). Seems the manager had a selective memory and probably associated my face as someone who \"caused problems,\" when in reality the faults were not mine! I had a friend who used to work there and I don't want to say anything bad about the staff, however it has really felt like a lack of courteousness and accountability. And lets just say hypothetically, even if I had \"caused some trouble,\" whatever that could mean, how can the manager verbally attack a paying customer like that. There are no 2 ways around it, he was rude and out of line, and didn't even apologize after he realized all I was asking for was a condiment. I hope the owner reads this and the manager has some accountability for his actions. Its a shame but I will NOT go back there without a sincere apology at the least. Worst restaurant experience of my life.\n\n**Additional note- Read another review where another long time Noe Valley resident, who loved to come here, also had the displeasure of encountering the manager's disrespect when he asked him and his family to vacate the table because there was a big party waiting. \n\nNo restaurant should tolerate any staff, especially management, to treat paying customers so poorly and with such blatant disregard.", "author": "Mark K."}

I hadn't touched any of the food except to cut the egg. He argued with me about it which is BS. What's he going to do, ask for a scientific examination of the egg and the runniness of the yolk (which was like water.) Afterward he and a coworker kept staring at us and being obnoxious. FFS!

Yesterday was the cherry on top, and we may not be going there any more. \n\nWe were greeted by an extremely snooty Caucasian hostess. She had short brown hair with short bangs. Because it was cold and rainy my husband, who is Filipino, asked if we could be seated as close as possible to the fireplace, the hostess rolled her eyes at him and told us only parties of more than 3 could be seated in the back(something we had never heard before) and seated us in the front. We then waited for ever. No one brought us water or checked in to take our order for drinks or food, Eventually after about 15 minutes we left.

Upon our arrival, we were initially told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table of 2 to become available.  So as I put our names down, I look around a bit and can clearly see that about 80% of the restaurant has open seats available.. hmm really?!, so I am thinking at this point that they are probably just a bit understaffed this morning which accounts for the exaggerated wait times.\n\nA few others are slowly and steadily trickling in.. and somewhere in the transition they started seated about 3 other parties before we are attended to. Upon our inquiry, the host was completely rude and unapologetic in his forray, claiming that our names were called and that there isn't much he can do besides putting our names down again.. but he wasn't even accommodating enough to have slipped us in before the later guests who have just arrived. \n\nIT WAS COMPLETE ATTITUDE,   \nand a bit of an irritation, but we were seated about 15 minutes later than we should have.  So, this left somewhat of a sour tinge in my mouth.. but at least the food was descent.\n\nWe each othered 1 dish to go halfies on, and then switched:\n\n-Blackstone Eggs Benedict with crab was good, I liked that I was given a choice of doneness to how I wanted my eggs poached.  I opted for runny, and it was impeccibly so.. complimented nicely by the nice crisp potatoes.\n \n-I had a bellini to sip on throughout my meal, but you could tell it was very low grade prosecco which usually would be fine if it were mixed with fresh fruit/puree.  But it just tasted like a cheap quick syrup.\n\n-The Chicken Club sancwich was simple, but tasted really comforting.  Especially with the thick and crispy fries on the side.  The aioli tasted a bit more like a slightly dilluted mayonaisse.  \n\nI would honestly give this place another shot, but it was really discouraging to have had such rude service.", "author": "Ty T."}

I went here last weekend 4/18 no line out the door, hmmmm.\nShould of been the first clue. \n\nCame in and there were plenty of empty tables but the hostess took our name and made us stand there for ten minutes. \nThat was strange. \n\nServer came over and took our order and seemed a bit off like she just popped some downers. Again that was strange.\n\nDrinks came about 15 minutes after giving our order, lame. And note the place was not that busy. \n\nWhile waiting one of the cooks was cursing in Spanish. Not cool. \n\nSome of the food came but not all that we ordered. I hate that because I wait to eat until all in the party has their food. \n\nWhen it all finally showed up my meal was cold and the bacon was so over cooked it literally exploded when I took a bite. Pieces of the bacon went flying all over the place. I didn't order bacon bits I ordered bacon. \n\nWhile we were eating are less than desirable meal the hostess kept staring at us because she knew the food was less then perfect and that's putting it lightly. \n\nThere was some kind of irritation between the hostess and a manager ( I'm assuming she was a manager ) and that made for an awkward vibe. \n\nWe won't be going back. \nSorry your loss.\n\nOn a brighter note. The big guy that works there and has been there for a few years is a very nice gentlemen. He's the only positive to the place. \nI give him 5 stars.", "author": "Tom B."}

The quality was not that great and portions weren't big either.\n\nThe Hanger steak salad that I ordered off the Specials Menu (I always get tricked into ordering things off Specials Menus even though I know it's usually food that restaurants are trying to get rid of)...was soo nothing special - it was just a small bowl of chopped Romaine lettuce, a few soft kernels of corn and strips of red onion, and five strips of Hanger steak (though I have to say that the steak was juicy and flavorful). This salad reminded me even more of why I hate ordering salads at restaurants! My bad.\n\nMy friend's Corned Beef and Eggs was decent, there wasn't much corned beef though. The few fried potato pieces were a bit hard. The bagel it comes with is the kind I like though...small, dense, and chewy.\n\nOur server was really friendly and provided great service, and he refilled my friend's coffee and our water like 5 times. \n\nI conclude that the food here falls below my future-housewife-cooking-skills status, and I probably wouldn't come back here unless it was to try one of their sweet crepes.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Even though it is nestled on the main strip of Noe Valley's most popular street, we didn't know it was there.  As such, we weren't looking for it when we found it.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We popped in for a quick lunch and ended up being seated outside on the back patio.  It was busy!  There were a bunch of different parties back there (families, couples, people on their lunch breaks, and of course -- us, two law students with time to kill).  It was as basic as any American-esque restaurant might be, with plenty of room, clean tables, and comfortable surroundings.  \n\nService:  The guy that helped us was pretty knowledgable; he was nice, joked innocently with us and made recommendations from the menu.  I don't remember him exactly or the quality of his service beyond that -- but I do remember that the experience wasn't a bad one, so he folds into the mix as being part of the pleasant experience.\n\nFood:  It was good.  I had one of their sandwiches paired with fries and was pretty much a happy camper. Still, like Maya S., it didn't make me salivate.  Nor was it incredible.  It was a good deal better than something that was horrible, meaning that it was actually quite good, but with every new place I'm hoping for something that stands out as unique.  I didn't really get that from this place.  I'd go back, and for a quick tip to others I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it for a good place to go on a whim, but I wonder if there's anyone on the menu that is unique enough to draw in a repeat business clientele?

I've only been here for brunch a few times, so can't speak for their lunch or dinner menus. \n\nI love the fact that I can come here on a weekend and not have to wait more than 5 minutes before being seated. The outside patio is cute and pretty interesting since it's surrounded by the back doors of other local businesses.\n\nThey have a HUGE SELECTION of brunch items (WOOHOO - something for everyone). My friends and I like doing family style at these places, so that we can get a taste of everything. I love their Baja scramble (healthy too!) and their pancakes are delicious! We got the pumpkin pancakes to share and they were huge! Fluffy and comes with whip cream! Their savory crepes are good too (tried the Santa Fe and Tuscany), but I was not a huge fan of their crab benedict. Felt like there was more filler than crab, so wasn't really worth the money. If you need more food, you can always splurge on the cornbread! YUM. Overall, their portions are very generous and who doesn't like leftovers?! \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, ranging between $9-13, but the portions speak for itself. The service is alright. Not the most attentive, but they haven't messed up on our orders and waiting for coffee refills haven't been too terrible, so no biggie. The waiters are nice and probably just too busy, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nLooking forward to coming back to try the other things on the menu!", "author": "Ellen N."}

We have always enjoyed the food and have eaten there for many years.\n\nWe arrived around 6:30 pm. Though the place was not crowded, the service was extremely slow. From the time we sat down, we waited over 15 minutes just to have a server approach our table. After we ordered and had waited over 30 minutes for our food to arrive, the server apologized for the delay. She apologized several more times over the next 30 minutes and each time told us it would just be a few more moments and the kitchen was really busy. Everyone who had been seated well after us had been served their food before us.\n\nFinally, more than an hour after ordering, my 6-year old got a plate of chicken nuggets -- they just required re-heating, I'm sure -- but nothing else came. Then after about 15 more minutes, the server brought our food but had the wrong plate for me. Luckily, she only grabbed the wrong plate and the kitchen had actually made my plate. At that point, I don't remember whether we liked the food because we ate it so fast. It was almost a 2 hour experience and one which I don't plan to repeat.\n\nAlso, as an apology, the server offered us $5 off our meal.

It was the first time I had seen him LOVE the food in a place that didn't cost over $190 for 2 (ahem Bouchon and Foreign Cinema I love you but you are pricey).\n\nI LOVED my Tuscany crepe and it came with a salad (i had them switch with cesar and beer battered french fries instead of home potatoes. The fries were super tasty, not too greasy, fresh, a crisp on the outside that gave way to a soft middle. Perfection.\nThe Tuscany was HUGE (i couldn't finish it) and I had help (tee hee). Generous and. tasty salad. My OJ is the best restaurant oj i've ever had, wasn't too expensive was delicious (i think fresh pressed) and HUGE. The crepe was generously stuffed with a lovely fusion of flavors (see below) and was on par of the quality of France's dinner crepes but far far more generously stuffed. Maybe even tastier?\n\nTuscany - $12.50 (Served with home potatoes and mixed greens)\nSaut\u00e9ed chicken breast, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic, \nroasted almonds, feta and provolone with pesto\n\nThe service was friendly and super great. The advice was honest and helpful. The food made my boyfriend smile in a way that I hadn't seen in a long time. When I asked if I could substitute home potatoes for fries and mixed green for caesar salad she was super nice about it (some places aren't). \n\nDesert:\nThe sweet crepes are served with chantilly and a very large very tasty scoop of vanilla  ice cream - $6.95. \n\nI had the Jamaican: Pan fried bananas with a caramel rum sauce and it was lovely, so soothing reminded me of childhood memories of France and my mother's fried bananas.\n\nHe had the La Bellav Seasonal berries and Nutella. I don't like Nutella but he LOVED it. \n\nBottom line go here for sure, order the crepes dinner and dessert and be happy!", "author": "Parpar M."}

Served with rosemary potatoes and toast.\n\nI don't usually go for fake meat, but that soy bean chorizo is SO good. My mom and I are both completely addicted to that omelet. \n\nAnother Great Choice:\n+ Cote D'azur Benedict - Smoked salmon on english muffin with poached eggs, spinach, and diced red onions, topped with hollandaise. \n\nSmoked salmon isn't your thing? They have several other benedict options (crab cakes, grilled tomatoes, spinach and onions, and corned beef hash). Oddly, no traditional eggs benedict with ham. I'd choose the Arizona Omelet over the Benedicts any day though.\n\nI've also tried the Haifa French Toast, made with challah and topped with apple pie filling.

The one-person bathroom is sometimes clean, sometimes not, and if the restaurant is crowded, there's a line for the bathroom. \n\nThe last time I went was with two eight-year old girls, who were given kidddie menus. I asked for ice water without lemon, and was given ice water with lemon. One of the girls asked for Swedish pancakes, and held her hands in a circle, to indicate the size of the (small) pancakes she wanted. She was given the adult portion. When I asked a passing waitress if she could get our waitress, she said sure, and I then watched her walk over to a fellow employee and stand there chatting with him. I finally asked another waitress to get our waitress, and when she arrived, I told her the kid had wanted the pancakes on the kiddie menu, is there any way she could exchange them? \n\nThe waitress got VERY defensive, insisting the kid asked for \"Swedish pancakes\" so that's what she got, and the small pancakes on the kiddie menu are not Swedish. I think the waitress should have clarified if what the kid indicated didn't match what she was saying. I mean, the kid ordered an orange juice too, and was given that in a kiddie cup rather than a glass. So the waitress just picked and chose which items she'd serve off the kiddie menu? Twice I had to urge the waitress to move forward towards resolving the problem by asking, \"So can this be solved by getting her an order of kiddie pancakes?\" She kept wanting to prove the mistake wasn't her fault. \n\nAlso, I asked for my potatoes and bacon to be extra crispy, and they were practically raw. Over 15 minutes passed without the new pancakes coming out. Finally the waitress came by, asked if the kid had them, and when I said no, she went and got them. \n\nIn the future, we'll just go to Joe's 24th St. Cafe when we want brunch in that neighborhood.\n\nIt was a really shitty experience, because of the attitude.

Savor was a place we'd heard of but had never gone to. \n\nLike many SF places on a Sunday early afternoon, Savor was crowded.  There was a line out the door about a dozen long.  The place can seat about 60 indoors and another 40 or so in backyard covered patio area.  They had a few heatlamps in the back to make it comfortable in the slightly chill after the rain.\n\nBased on Yelp reviews, this place is all about omelettes and crepes.  My friend ordered an SF crepe with salmon and dijon on the side.  She enjoyed it and was only able to finish half.  She happily took the rest home for tomorrow's lunch at work.  I had a Mazatlan crepe (see photo) and added chicken.  It was very good but in retrospect I should have gotten something less familiar, because it seemed like a quesadilla.  This isn't a bad thing, but like I said I should have tried something unfamiliar.  The home fries were good and crispy and not overly seasoned.

Sometimes a girl just needs to be a little high maintenance and our server was so accommodating to my every specific request: Soy Hazelnut Extra Foam Latte, Scrambled Eggs \"medium\" (whatever that means), and French Toast with Strawberries AND Bananas- yes all for ME!  \n\nThe weather was perfect and I could have sat in that outdoor patio all day but we got our (bounty of) food pretty quickly. Only issue was my bananas were missing. I wasn't going to say anything but they asked if everything was ok, and I had to be honest! A minute later the bananas arrived, and two minutes after that the guy that had dropped off our food came back to make sure I had gotten them. But he asked so nicely, as if he was making sure I was taken care of!!! Being the (pmsing) sucker that I am, I stopped eating as he walked away, said aww, put my hand over my heart and nearly shed a tear. I felt the love. \n\nAll of the servers are so nice and genuine. As we were walking out EVERYONE said \"bye, have a nice day\" to us and for a second I wondered what they were on! :) Savor is super kid friendly, my goddaughter loved her crayons. They even brought her a balloon and walked around her as she decided to explore a little. \n\nOverall, a great place with delicious food and amazing service!", "author": "Valerie A."}

I went in a couple of weeks ago with a friend and ordered a basic breakfast, Eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. My friend ordered the waffle.\nWhen our food was delivered, not by our waitress, I could immediately see the soggy steamed potatoes, the overcooked (rendered) bacon, my three eggs and toast.  I looked at my friend and he immediately knew that this was bad. The butter on his waffle was stone cold and hadn't melted, which was suspect. His Waffle was also cold!\nI knew at that moment I would not eat nor pay for the bacon or potatoes as that quality of food should not come out of a kitchen for that price. The waitress finally came back around and asked if everything was alright. By that time I was already done with my toast and eggs. I shook my head no and immediately told her that the bacon was overcooked and the potatoes were soggy. She asked if I wanted a replacement and I told her no, that I am done eating and I will not pay for that.  She then tried to shift the blame asking why I didn't tell her when she came to check on us. Interesting because this was her first visit back to the table and when I told her that she denied it.  She told me she will have to talk to the manager. She came back like 10 minutes later and abruptly said you will pay for the eggs and toast.\n\nAt that point I was like whatever, and she didn't even address my friend's cold waffle. Breakfast ingredients are *cheap* and easy to prepare properly if you care about your business. You are delivering crap to your patrons and then making them feel bad to complain. That's just not cool in my book.", "author": "Nick R."}

We were seated in the lovely, spacious patio area out back.  A huge fan of outdoor seating, I was really excited to have found another cute brunch place for the warmer months!  \n\nWe ordered the Arizona omelette with soy rizo (think Southwest flavors) and the challah french toast with apple pie filling to share.\n\nWe loved the omelette!  The soyrizo was absolutely delicious and complemented the other flavors quite well.  I would absolutely order it again and recommend it to other soyrizo fiends.\n\nDidn't love the french toast because it was a little egg-y for my taste.  I like more toast and less egg in my french toast.  Also, the apple pie filling tastes kind of like it comes from a can, and since it comes on the side, it is not really integrated well into the dish.  I would have preferred if the french toast was topped with the filling.  Would not get this again.\n\nNext time, we will most likely order the Arizona omelette and a sweet crepe to share (the flavors looks awesome!).  Can't wait!", "author": "Julie S."}

I opted to try out something under the \"Benedictions\" section -- corned beef hash. And, omg, I was glad I did. The corned beef wasn't diced or all smushed -- it was actually more like pulled pork; sort of shredded. It was cooked with diced onions that were perfectly carmelized, diced potatoes that has a pleasant hint of garlic to them, and cheddar cheese. Wait, I'm ruining it. The set up went: potatoes on the bottom, covered in cheddar, then the meat and onions, and finally, two eggs over easy on top. Perfection. A bagel and cup of fresh fruit came along with it, and they were very nice as well. \n\nI also noticed their brunch-y cocktail menu, which had Bloody Marys, Mimosas, and Bellinis for $5.

Though our waitress was friendly, she got my order wrong. Mistakes happen but when a bug flew into my wine glass and I informed her, she removed my glass but returned with only the amount that had remained minus the bug. Did she scoop out the bug and give me the wine back? I highly doubt it, but she should have poured a new, full glass to alleviate any uncertainty and as a gesture. Poor form.\n\nThe biggest problem were the flies. Why were there a ton of fruit flies buzzing around us inside the restaurant? That grossed me out and to have one fly into my glass of wine added insult to injury. \n\nThis restaurant has identity issues. The space has a broken layout with most of the restaurant in the back outside mall area in the middle of the block under an awning. They have heaters but only one was turned on so we ate inside.  \n\nThe fact that there are two menus with different designs and layout made me feel like there were two different restaurants in the same space.

We arrived at 9:30 - it was almost empty. Maybe 5 or 6 tables were occupied. We figured we'd be in and out. Fairly quickly, our server came to take our order. Drinks came, then we waited. And waited. 10:06 - still no food. 10:20 - the place is now packed and my husband and son receive their order. She got our son's wrong. Instead of a short stack with a side of fruit, she gave him a full order of coconut banana pancakes. He took 3 bites then was finished. My husband said his crepe and potatoes were cold. My order - eggs, sausage and toast (a seriously no-brainer breakfast that should have come out in 15 minutes vs. close to an hour) finally arrived. Toast isn't toasted, eggs look gray, sausage and potatoes look fine. We talked about sending our son's breakfast back, but he said he just wanted to get the check and leave. Our server comes by to check on us once and before my husband has a chance to order a mimosa she walks away. 10:49 - we flag down another waiter to ask for our check. Our server was polite and nice, but service was horrible. There is no reason that eggs, a crepe and two pancakes should take over an hour in a basically empty restaurant.

On that occasional warm San Francisco day having brunch on their patio with a nice mimosa is a great way to start (or end) a relaxing weekend.  (They also have outdoor heaters for the patio.)\n\nTheir breakfast crepes and omelletes are hefty (3 eggs at their fluffiest) and they are more than willing to turn crepes into omelettes if you're looking for ways to lower your simple-carb intake.  They'll also sub mixed greens for potatoes without batting an eye.  My favorite crepe/omelette option is the San Franciscan because of the salmon (or lox -- your call) and the spinach.  The Santa Fe, which has chicken-apple sausage, is another good choice. And the raisin bread is almost worth the carbs.  \n\nI typically come here for brunch but recently revisited this place for dinner.   I had the hanger steak, served with a wine and mushroom sauce and was very pleasantly surprised.  I ordered sweet potato fries and sauteed spinach as my sides.   If you get the fries, ask for them on a separate plate to avoid the sog factor, but, sogginess aside, both sides were still yummy. \n\nThe wine list is decent with a lot of options from Argentina and other up-and-comers in the wine world.  And the dessert crepes are pretty hard to resist (darn the makers of Nutella).\n\nService is mostly good.  My favorite waiter calls everyone \"hon\" and wears shorts on even the coldest days.

I've gotten the Milano this way and it is DELICIOUS!  I don't care for their home fries/rosemary potatoes so I order their french fries and mixed green salad instead.  Their beer-battered fries are killer.  Nothing overly special put on them but they're crispy on the outside and nice and warm/soft on the inside, and not greasy!  Perfection as far as I'm concerned. \n\nPortions are also very generous.  You will seriously either leave completely stuffed or comfortable and have lunch for the next day.  \n\nOther notable menu items:\n- Swedish pancakes.  Totally not a pancake fan but these oatmeal pancakes are seriously heaven.  It comes with a fruit compote (and butter) that goes perfectly with them.  It's a huge meal or a nice appetizer for everyone at the table ; )\n- the Carolina.  BBQ pulled pork.  'Nuff said.  Comes with fries & salad.\n- the Arizona Omelette w/meat chorizo (with fries and salad of course, per my request)\n- the Blackstone Benedict (with ham added)\n- Nicoise salad (w/grilled salmon - only b'c I'm pregnant and tuna is off limits for now - but it's cooked perfectly.. very tender and not dried out)\n- Chicken Marsala w/their garlic mashed potatoes & seasonal veggies (mashed potatoes are so creamy!)\n\nAnyway, you should try and see for yourself.  The staff are also great - friendly, accommodating, personable, and perfectly attentive.", "author": "Arlie A."}

There's a reason they serve breakfast all day. \n\nNow as for dinner, do yourself a favor and order breakfast food if you ever find yourself here around that time. \n\nDinner appetizer portions are huge, big enough to fit two people, or one person as a main dish, but flavors aren't that strong. Baked brie in philo dough with walnuts and their house jalapeno jelly not as flavorful as baked brie dishes need to be (the jelly just didn't give it enough tang) and the baked mushrooms in cheese with crostini was very soupy tasted like plain, unseasoned sauteed mushrooms with cheese on bread. \n\nDinner entrees too lacked flavor, as the shrimp fettucine was basically pasta with a little bit of lemon juice squeezed atop it. Risotto ratatouille was their strongest dish, warm, chewy, but needed just a little more something, some crunch, extra sauce, something to push it into good territory.\n\nAll in all, breakfast is good, as has been reiterated many times by other Yelpers, but dinner is bland.", "author": "David G."}

It's a bit spicy so be careful if you're sensitive to spicy foods. My initial thought on seeing chicken on the menu was \"How boring\". But the person next to me ordered it and it looked delicious.  So get it if you're in a chicken mood. Fairly large portions, but it better be for the price.

I took a fork full of the salad, and everything looked and tasted ok, until I noticed someting moving on top of one of the salad leaves on my plate.

Right away I told one of the waiters what was going on and to my shock I was tod to wait for my waitress. Here I was sitting staring at this disgusting creature, wondering how in the world did it get there and why was my waitress taking such a long time to come and deal with this. I could not wait any longer so I took this almost untouched, contaminated plate of food right to her. I told her about the larvae on my salad and to my great surprise she asked if I would like to order anthing else. I was so disgusted and afraid my next choice from the menu would reveal another live surprise, that I told her I was no longer hungry. The waitress apologized and told me she was taking my order off the total bill, thats all she said.\n\nI left thinking that I would never return there again. This is most disturbing and disgusting.

He made good pancakes.  I think I make pretty good pancakes as well, but Savor's pancakes are better.  They are big and fluffy with a little bit of goo in the middle (perfection really).  Add bananas to the pancake batter and then bananas and coconut to the top and you have one fantastic dish.

There is always a line on weekends around Brunch time.  \n\nI prefer to hit Savor in the off hours for dine-in, mainly because  I'm partial to their lunch options over the breakfast itmes.  Some of my favorites include the Kyoto Crepe with tofu, shitake mushrooms and peanut sauce; the Sonoma and Petaluma sandwiches and the Bangkok Salad.  The portions are huge and will easily sustain you for two meals.  Sanwiches come with both potatos and a heaping side of mixed greens.\n\nIt's not a cheap eat, but the space makes up for it.  I love Savor's back patio and the comfy indoor seating.  Come here on a cold evening for some chow and they even have a little fireplace going.", "author": "Kerry D."}

Mix of various American standard items, some influenced by other cuisines, but really not being much of one or the other.  Chances are that you order anything at Savor, it won't be authentic anything but authentic San Francisco.\n\nI've been here twice, most recently for the post-bookclub-dinner.  I ordered the eggs benedict with salmon (I believe it was called Cote d'Azur...this is what I mean, the pretensions to cuisine influence from elsewhere but really, it's just eggs benedict with salmon).  In my opinion, it's preferable to have something on the salty side topping your eggs benedict because the hollandaise sauce and the eggs are so mild.  So, I would have liked the salmon to be smoked salmon...but alas, it was rather bland salmon.  \n\nAs other people have noted, portions are very very large here.  All of our plates were plenty full.\n\nI do give them kudos for serving breakfast til closing time (I love being able to order breakfast any time of the day).  And our waitress seemed friendly enough.  But both times, there's been nothing that struck me as particularly special about the place.  Good neighborhood joint, and a decent enough place if you are looking for a place to eat in Noe Valley...but not a destination spot by any means.", "author": "Sooj O."}

Before ordering our meals we get the Spicy Cornbread with Jalapeno Jelly.  On their menu, it is described as \"a must\" and this is so true.  There are 2 slices of cornbread served with an orange colored marmalade with minced jalapenos.  The jelly is sweet with a hint of spicy - very unique and tasty.\n\nI ordered the Provence Egg Scramble, which is served with salmon, spinach, onions and goat cheese.  This scramble is on the rich side (the way I like it) and is very delicious.  With it, I had their roasted rosemary potatoes and sourdough toast.  I only ate half my potatoes since the scramble was large in portion.  The sourdough toast is a thicker slice of bread best enjoyed with their raspberry jelly.\n\nMy husband ordered the Tuscany Crepe with chicken, mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes, pesto, almonds and Parmesan cheese.  With his crepe, he gets rosemary potatoes and a salad.  The crepe is a pretty good size and very flavorful - a favorite of his!\n\nFor drinks, we both ordered mango iced teas.  This is a very good tea which is light and refreshing.  Since it's flavored, no sugar is needed.  All waitstaff are very friendly and casual which is a big plus!\n\nAt Savor, you have a choice of dining indoors or dining on the patio.  A couple of tips:\n1.  The place can be busy during brunch hours.  For those that like to avoid larger crowds, the place relaxes after 2PM.\n2.  Noe Valley parking is a bear!

OK, that last statement was a little strong, but I was wrong about Savor, so let me elaborate.\n\nIt's not like Crepevine at all.  It's an actual sit-down restaurant, which it doesn't look like it will be from the outside.  (OK, so I missed the gigantic PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED sign.)  There are some nice tables inside, but the best ones are in the little patio out back.  The service was attentive, and the menu is pretty extensive.\n\nI had the Kyoto crepe, and it was really good.  What I was really impressed by, though, was the size of the crepe and the amount of salad and home fries that came with it.  My mom's French dip was also pretty substantial.\n\nSo it's not overpriced at all, and I felt like I was actually getting a deal--something that rarely happens at a non-taqueria in San Francisco.", "author": "John S."}

I'm always up for new and improved ways to enjoy breakfast foods, and Savor was able to deliver just that.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive, but not overwhelmingly so.

I went once with my sister in-law and she had eggs benedict with crab cakes and said they were delicious indeed!\n\nTwo crepes in my opinion stand out above the rest: the Tuscan Crepe (a delicious combination of pesto, diced chicken breast, sun-dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and toasted pine nuts makes for a PERFECT combination in your mouth).  The crunch that the nuts provide put this dish over the top.  The second crepe to bare mention is the Crepe Le Delice (a gooey mixture of cheddar cheeses with simple yet amazingly delicious caramelized onions is pure bliss in a bite).  Crepes are also served with golden brown country potatoes and a side salad (and interesting addition to breakfast, but one that has turned out to be quite tasty).\n\nAlthough there are crowds often waiting outside for a table, if your party is smaller than 3 you often never have to wait for a table.

The menu is so similar I could be at either place. Costa del sol Benedict? Tuscany Crepe? Jamaican sweet crepe with bananas and caramel rum sauce? \n\nUnfortunately overall I didn't like this place quite as much as Crepevine. \n\nFor starters the potatoes were not very flavorful, they seemed to be boiled and lightly fried They were not burnt (which is good) and were soft (also good), but had almost no flavor. \n\nI liked the salad, it was on par and quite similar to crepevine. Leafy greens and a nice dressing that isn't too heavy. \n\nThe Crepe (Tuscany) was good, it had lots of chicken and a good blend of the pesto, Parmesan and almonds. \n\nThe Jamaican crepe was way below Crepevine though, weak sauce. \n\nThe burger was tasty, I forget what it was called, but it was loaded with avocado, mushrooms, cheese and a fat patty. \n\nBottom line: \nI wouldn't protest going back again, but I also wouldn't seek it out for another meal.", "author": "Stephen H."}

The Cote d'Azur (2 poached eggs, smoked salmon) and green tea hit the spot. My server, David K, was awesome -- exactly the right level of attentiveness.

They were in town from the Midwest, and while we'd taken them to S.F. many times before, we'd never shown them the Noe Valley neighborhood.  Rather than doing the usual Fisherman's Wharf/China Town/Union Square route, we headed straight for 24th St.\n\nThis was our first experience with Savor, and I was a bit apprehensive after my first glance at the menu - Omelettes, Egg Scrambles, Benedictions - Oy.  Looks like I'm getting eggs...  Wait!  There are crepes and sandwiches, too!  \n\nI decided on a sandwich - the \"El Dorado\" (1/2 lb of ground chunk with red onions, tomatoes lettuce and mayonnaise on a bun) - a.k.a., \"hamburger.\"  I was very pleased with my burger, but I was actually most pleased with the sides.  The platter-sized plate came with the burger and a generous helping of a mixed green salad with a deliciously light and complimentary dressing and Savor's \"home potatoes.\"  I really must stop for a moment and reminisce about these potatoes, as they blew the doors off any I've ever previously tasted.  Crispy and flavorful potato skins with appropriately fluffy centers - perfect!  Not too salty, not too bland.  \n\nEveryone else at the table essentially cleaned their plates, so I assume they shared my enjoyment of their respective menu selections (a Barcelona crepe, a Baja scramble, and a Pacific sandwich).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-01", "description": "Myself and Savor got of to a shaky start not long after I moved here.  I was out prowling the area for early-morning grub with one of my equally un-refined buddies, and our quest took us to Savor.  Once seated, we nervously eyeballed the menu, searching in vain for the meat-and-two-eggs basics....which were nowhere to be found.  Two minutes later we were out the door heading up the street to Herb's Fine Foods ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/m9HHJIey0gqfw2fQesa3bw?hrid=yDRBHQWycb8-FYjgY-pHPg ).  Throughout the dot-com boom I'd see a wretched array of cyber-refugees from San Jose, Cupertino, and Sunnyvale line up 30 minutes deep to get in here on the weekends.  For several years, I equated Savor with needless hassle and pretentious chic...\r\n\r\nFour years later my sidekick Tassie dragged me here kicking and screaming...and to my surprise, the post-breakfast version of Savor turned out to be a pretty cool and laid-back place! Specializing in crepes, I found the entrees to be pleasantly uncomplicated, well presented, very tasty, and surprisingly affordable!\r\n\r\nBreakfast wise, Savor hasn't changed since the day it sent me running for cover at Herb's.  Creative Omelets, innovative \"Egg Scrambles\", and specially flavored pancakes sum up  the main attractions. Further down the menu are their innovative looking breakfast specialties...Creative dishes for those seeking morning chow that's off the beaten-path.  Noticeably absent are the gut-busting truck-stop specials.\r\n\r\nCome lunchtime, the \"Savory Crepes\" come into the picture.  Call me a culinary idiot, but for ages I balked at this part of the menu, thinking that crepes were exclusively a desert item.  My usual choice in this department is their \"Tuscany\",a chicken filled crepe with mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes, and and cheese.  Also included for about ten bucks is a mixed-greens salad and a healthy-sized serving of home-fried potatoes.  I've had this about a dozen times...it's never missed the mark.\r\n\r\nWhen dinnertime rolls around, crepes still dominate the menu, but an interesting number of specials and dinner plates creep into the mix.  Tassie used to get one of these all the time...and always gave it two thumbs up.  I always stuck with my tried-and-true Tuscany crepe.\r\n\r\nService is about optimal for a place of this type....brief, somewhat hurried, but polite and efficient.  Several good beers are on tap, and the wine selection isn't half bad either!\r\n\r\nPeak times bring lines to Savor over the weekends.  During the week, seating is rarely if ever a problem.  A line of tables perpendicular to 24th Street goes from the reception area and past the kitchen.  Better seating (in my opinion) is available after the L-Shaped seating area makes a 90 degree turn to the right, leading to a back area that looks out over an open patio.  If possible, snag a table by the window.  Finally there's an outdoor  brick patio that's surrounded on one side by the restaurant, two sides by fences, and the back side by small shops. Ample trees and greenery make this an awesome lunch spot on a nice day.  Try to get seated in the patio if weather permits....it's what everyone else seem to do.  Come the sunshine, indoor seating at Savor usually goes begging....\r\n\r\nI give this place two thumbs up.  The King and Queen of Jordan ate here once in the summer of 2000 ( http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/2000/July-August/king.html ) and they thought it was pretty good too!  So if you're looking for a casual place to enjoy quality food in a 24th-and-Sanchez atmosphere at 16th-and-Mission prices, follow my lead and give this place a checking out....", "author": "Mike W."}

We ordered 3 savory crepes  for dinner: Milano, Tuscany and Santa Fe. Each crepe came with a side of sauteed potatoes and tossed green salad. The salad is very simple, with almost too little dressing. There are some bitter greens which highlighted the salad very well. \n\nThe potatoes are uneven. Some pieces are crispy, which I prefer, but some are mushy. They are perfumed with rosemary, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nFinally, I really enjoy my Tuscany crepe. The filling of chicken, mushroom and pesto worked really well. The only complain is the dressing is a little too oily. \n\nThe crepe themselves are very thin, but have dried up a little during the cooking process.

We had a small table in the back, smooshed into the corner, so much so that someone at the table next to us had to get up so that we could be seated.  Service was a bit slow, but the waitress was nice and obviously being overworked.  \n\nWe each got different egg dishes - I'm a sucker for scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and their version definitely met my expectations.  Coffee was hot and bitter, just the way I love it.  And the decor of the restaurant was warm and welcoming, but still a bit hip.  \n\nBut to be honest, I don't know if I'd go back.  Maybe for dinner, but I just don't like knowing that I'll have to wait for breakfast foods.", "author": "Tina H."}

Every time I've had salmon here on my salad, it's fresh and delish. I highly recommend the Granada salad with salmon. \n\nOr, if you're in the mood for brunch foods at any time of day, stop by Savor for some savory crepes, eggs, omelets, pancakes, and more.

We enjoyed our meal- not too bad, but not as good as Chloe's down the street.  The 3-egg omelets were cooked well and they weren't stingy with the fillings.

Scrambles, pancakes, french toast, crepes (savory and sweet), eggs benedict, salads and sandwiches.  Kinda hard to go wrong with all the choices...which might be one of the only problems.  Too many choices.  It can be hard to pick sometimes but I have sampled most of the items on the menu and you will likely not go wrong.  \n\nMy favorites include all of the Eggs Benedicts as they do an excellent job.  Probably my favorite in the city.  The scrambles and the crepes are well worth the effort.

This is important to me so it has the biggest impact on my rating. \n\nI think the food is certainly overpriced, there are better brunch options in SF so not my first choice. Example of overpriced, my friend didn't want the toast or homefries with her omelette, she asked for a side of fruit instead (so they were breaking even if anything), our waiter said it would cost extra, it turned out to be $3.50 extra and I kid you not contained 5 small slices of fruit in a tiny ramekin. My iced soy chai was watered down and gross (& overpriced of course).\n\nIt took us 15 minutes to flag down our server for the check when we were ready to go. He completely ignored us the whole time (didn't bring us the food someone else ran it out, never asked how it was, never refilled our water or asked if we wanted anything else). The ONLY time he came by was about 5 minutes prior to us finishing up. He went to grab my plate before we had finished our food. I asked him politely to please not to take them just yet, we needed a minute, so then I think he decided to give us PLENTY of time (even though others were waiting for an outdoor patio table on the beautiful sunny Sunday last weekend) then took 20 more minutes to not come back to take our table to provide change or if it was a card to run it through we had to take it up to the host station to take care of, which is not normally how things run there from what I understood from the apologetic host.\n\nThat was the final straw for making this barely a 1 star review.

Then couple months later, I came here and had the oatmeal pancakes. Gross! They tasted like cardboard and were just a cakey gluey mass like what you get from the cafeteria as a kid. But thicker. I did not want to go again, but the other day my friends really wanted to go and I got tired of being the bitchy naysayer so I finally relented and let us come here. My friend got the buttermilk pancakes, with strawberries and chocolate chips, and it tasted like..see my description above. They were so bad that he wanted to exchange them. But the waitress, who jumped on us literally the second we were seated, abandoned us the whole meal after our food came. My other friend and I were done with our meals before she even came over, asking if we're done, when he was able to tell her what happened and ask for something different. I didn't ask for something different, but mine was also bad. I got the crabcake egg special. It's a poached egg on top of a crab cake on top of an English muffin, with sauce over it all. I always love, or at least like, crab things. This crabcake was bleh. Was I eating catfood? The fruit that came with it was pretty good. The homefries were boring and I had just two bites. The English muffin was kinda soggy but really, that crabcake. I ate one and a half of the two and my stomach hurt the entire day, night and into the next day. Was the meal all bad? No. the corn bread is pretty tasty, we all enjoyed it. The sangria was good too. It comes by the glass and is actually more of a sake drink rather than a real sangria, pretty strong, but tasty. The other friend liked his hash dish well enough and the savory crepe that replaced the bad pancakes wasn't anything special but it wasn't bad. The good thing is, after this time, these friends said I don't have to come back. Yippee!

It was HUGE (I was happy), and I didn't finish it all, my dad had to help me eat it. My dad ordered the salmon crepe, and I only had a few bites of it, but it was amazing. I wish I had some more. \n\nSurprisingly, out of all the restaurants we visited during our time in San Francisco, this was definetely my favorite. Their portions were really generous, and the prices seemed low for how much food they were giving you. The crepes are definetely the best though.

I have been going to Savor off and on for a few years now! \n\n+1 Yummy crepes and flexible about changing the menu.

In the past it was sort of on and off but our server last night was very sweet and attentive. \n+1 Parking - In spite of people complaining that there is no parking in Noe valley, I always find a spot within 5 minutes every time - most likely because it is not one of the trendier areas to hang out in by comparison, and I hope it stays that way! \n\nAside from chains like Squat and Gobble or Crepes a gogo I haven't had much to compare to crepe-wise in SF. This is a cozy little eatery that is perfect for a foggy evening, especially if you are seated near the fire! They also have a big patio for one of those rare warm sunny days! I recommend.

Bill Burr said it best; brunch is the biggest scam...you pay $20 for eggs and toast. The highlight of my visits here are the cornbread and jalapeno jelly. There's a good selection of omlettes and crepes here in addition to the standard brunch sandwiches. Try the san francisco crepe with salmon (i switch mine to the smoked variety), spinach and havarti. It's really tasty and i convince myself that the spinach makes up for the cheese.\n\nOther good choices are the coronado omlette with bold soutwestern flavours that can make you forget you're eating eggs and the cote d'azur with delicate silky hollandaise sauce.\n\nI would give this place another half star if they had fresh squeezed orange juice. What kind of self respecting brunch spot tries to compete in the big leagues without your basic fresh squeezed OJ? The Odwalla is hardly a worthy substitute but it beats the concentrate.

First, the fork was obviously dirty and I noticed this even before I sat down in the patio area in the back. I asked the waitress for a new one, but she forgot, and by the time my food came, I had to go to inside the restaurant and find one off an empty set table.

I live in the neighborhood of strollers, families, and dogs), I was stoked to find that I was walking distance from several eateries and didn't have to dive into my car anymore for a bite to eat.\n\nOn my first morning in my new digs, I did a search for breakfast places in Noe Valley. I came across this place. SWEET! Yet another crepe place. They can either be really, really good, or.. mediocre. I decided to give it a shot.\n\nMy first time at Savor was satisfactory. I was seated quickly, even though they were busy. The only thing I really had to complain about was their  \"spicy bloody mary\". It was.. can I say it? TOO SPICY. I fully expect my Bloody Marys to have a kick, but this thing was pure spice and no flavor. I left half of it on the table, and abusing alcohol in that sense is typically OUT OF THE QUESTION for me.\n\nMy second time there, I took my parents, who were in town for the day. They seated us right away, but after serving us our drinks, they decided to move us to a different table because a couple of lonely housewives were complaining behind us about their own table \"not being in the right location\". I found it offensive that, instead of telling them to wait for a new table to open up, they decided to just move us poor little innocents to appease these women. We were pretty nonplussed, but trudged on and ordered anyway. Both of my parents' crepes were good, but my scramble left something to be desired. The eggs were overdone, the ingredients poorly paired. It was bland, even with copious amounts of salt and pepper added. I ended up leaving half of that on my plate.\n\nMy third time there, I was seated quickly again. After 20 minutes of waiting for so little as a nod of acknowledgment from the waitstaff (to no avail), I walked out. The place was empty. There was no reason for the lack of attention.\n\nSo, Savor, you had my hopes up for a while, but seeing as how your service has gotten increasingly worse every time I've been there.. I give up the ghost.  You've made me commit three of my biggest taboos -- alcohol abuse, food abuse, and walking out of a restaurant.\n\nNo more!", "author": "Kym L."}

I have never been disappointed, not even close, at Savor. The food and service have been consistently excellent since my first visit back in 2003 (always have gone for breakfast/lunch/brunch.) And that consistency is probably what makes Savor so good. \n\nAnyway, the Bangkok Salad is insane, and while I'll scan the menu every time I go, it's usually this salad for me. In terms of breakfast/brunch, the Corned Beef Hash here is equally insane. The last time I was there (just a couple of weeks ago), they had a nice mango jam which was really tasty - perfect with my marble rye toast! I've had a few of the crepes which have been nice...and the different eggs benedict are also good stuff. \n\nIt's pretty simple for me...the food and service are both equally and consistently excellent-that's kind of hard to find. Yes, the weekend waits can suck, but if you're not in a rush, it's worth it. And if you can't stand the wait, check it out during the week.", "author": "Carmine D."}

It looks like a great place and the menu held a great deal of promise, our server was wonderful everyone very helpful but the food was slightly lacking.  I was expecting more.  We ordered the cornbread of course; the Baja [(Spicy) chicken apple sausage, mushrooms, spinach onions, chipotle peppers with roasted jalapeno, cheddar cheese and salsa fresca in a crepe form[; Santa Fe [grilled chicken apple sausage, with scrambled eggs, green onions, provolone and salsa fresca]; and finally the New Orleans [crab cakes on english muffin with poached eggs topped with spicy cajun hollandaise].  The dishes for all of their seemingly amazing ingredients were just OK.  The Baja wasn't spicy at all, I didn't taste the chipolte or the jalepeno.  The Santa Fe was descent.  But the Crab cakes were OK but I was missing crab flavor and was getting only bread crumbs.  Cajun sauce really tasted more like regular hollandaise to me personally, and my co-diner.  The rosemary potatoes were tasty though.  But all in all, I wouldn't travel back there for breakfast.  If I lived in the area I would probably eat there a little more often but as it is now I only go in when I am in the area, and someone wants to go.", "author": "Sarah O."}

And yes, that was a really long aside.  I apologize.  I cannot help where my brain goes and I also WILL NOT EDIT MYSELF OR MY FEELINGS FOR ANY MAN OR WEBSITE!\n\nAnyway, they'll wait days for standard brunch food alongside a couple of odd items like an egg scramble with tofu in it?

Oh, they will make you a makeshift tofu-sans-egg scramble with SOYRIZO (!!!) which is good but somehow...lacking.  I dunno.  I just never really have an outstanding meal at Savor.  Oh and they give you a fuck ton of food and this is coming from a fattie so you know they mean business.

My husband and I wandered up to Savor for brunch, as we've done for many, many Sundays for five years now.  It's always been fantastic- service, food, atmosphere were always 5 stars.  It was the only place we went for brunch.  David, the manager, was consistently friendly and courteous, even when they were slammed (which is all the time).  Today was different.  There's a new manager now (named Zaid, FYI), who apparently is the cousin of the owner.  According to our waitress, David has been demoted to just \"waiter\".  \nThey messed up my order by giving me an omelette instead of a scramble.  I wasn't going to say anything, but then I noticed onions, which I specifically asked them to leave out.  When I sent it back, the waitress apologized and took it to the cook.  Two minutes later, Zaid brought my original plate back to me, claiming that I was wrong- although it was obviously an omelette, he basically said I was crazy and that it was a scramble (even though my husband was actually eating a scramble and it looked completely different).  It was totally humiliating that he brought my plate back and tried to tell me I was wrong.  At that point I my appetite had left me, so I told our waitress to just cancel my order.  In the meantime, Zaid came back with a scramble and he and my husband got into it.  My husband told him we had been loyal customers for years and had never been treated that way.  Zaid shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  As we left, my husband saw him again, and said, \"I hope you're happy- you just lost two loyal customers.\"  Zaid yelled after us, \"Yes, I AM happy!\" Yikes, crazy!", "author": "Elena W."}

The salmon was in 1-inch chunks, not little slivers like smoked salmon would be, but it was flavorful and not at all dry.  I'm quite picky about home fries, and these were good--small enough chunks so that they're not all dry and flavorless in the middle, a good golden crunchiness but not burned, etc.  They didn't taste aMAZing but they were a damn sight better than the usual huge herbed-up burned chunks that you find in most crepe places.  \n\nThe salad on the side was just OK, nothing super special, just a plain vinaigrette-type dressing on some mixed greens. \n\nThe coffee was delicious!\n\nOverall, I'd say that Savor is a good place to eat, a decent value for the neighborhood, and a lovely outdoor place to bring friends, especially out-of-town guests on a sunny day.

Yes.. that many choices. I was pretty torn on what to get, but decided on the Cinnamon walnut french toast! It came with 6 slices, huge! The bread was really delicious, with tiny bits of walnuts, so you get the right amount of crunch and flavor. I'm coming back for sure soon!", "author": "Denise L."}

Food was o.k. but once cute back patio has been 'de-flowered' and looks a little depressing with its faded plastic seats. Where did all the pretty plants go?\n\nAlso I agree with Monkey S. that the surcharge is bullshit. If you're going to make a 'protest' then let me know before I sit down to eat. I've never heard of a business trying to foist off the expenses of a basic human right \nand then make the consumer feel guilty about the ambush. Providing healthcare should be an employers responsibility not foisted onto the consumer. Presenting this in the guise of a 'protest ' is even worse.  If that means increasing prices go ahead and if I can't afford to eat there I wont. \n\nCongratulations Savor in extorting your 'protest' from me. Pay your own bills from now on and don't expect me or any other consumer to pity you. That's the last dollar you'll get from me.", "author": "james P."}

I've become biased and critical in my search for a great breakfast joint - and this place is the reason why! No other place in town can hold a torch against this one and I can honestly say that I have not been able to find another brakfast place that surpasses this. Some places run a close second, but this place is by far TOPS! I'll even surrender myself to it by rolling out of the house on a weekend afternoon, still half asleep and slightly hung over wearing no makeup at all (gasp!)and dark sunglasses to hide my bloodshot eyes with a desperate need of changing that dry, parched, ashtray taste in my mouth, I acquired from my previous night's mistakes and disguising it with something more savoring (no pun intended) and flavorful knowing that there will most likely be a minimum 20 minute wait for a table (sometimes the wait is not that long). But I know that the wait is worth it, at least I know that I can depend on the complimentary coffee waiting for me at the door to sustain my patience and waken my tastebuds. And to top it all off, there is one of the cutest little patios around town. So.... about the food:\n\nAwesome breakfast! Savor makes the best breakfast scrambles, omelets and crepes in town, all of which are hefty in portion and are served with either a salad or rosemary potatoes - and let me tell you, they do have the BEST rosemary potatoes! They've truly got it down and just know how to roast them the right way (better made than some other breakfast joints i have gone to, which shall remain nameless at least for the purpose of this review) and would make Emerill Lagazzi take note. You'll also find a good selection of sandwiches and large salads as well which are also very tasty; along with fresh squeezed orange juice, mimosas and good coffee. In short, the menu is very extensive and items such as The Baja, The Tsunami, The Barcelona, The Tuscany provide unique tastes that will satisfy any taste or craving you may have.\n\n If you are having breakfast, forget about the bacon, you won't find it here, so get over it! who needs bacon anyway when your served hearty and flavorful portions to chow down on?!", "author": "NirvAnna M."}

It would be nicer if the cozy patio were private. The brunch crowd stands out on the sidewalk in front waiting to get in... it's a popular place on weekends, and just like all good places in the city, ya often gotta wait. Also, the bathroom door opens up uncomfortably in the middle of the restaurant, so I always feel paranoid that I need to check and double-check the lock, so that nobody opens up the door on me -- giving a site to a big crowd!\nBut I don't want to end on that note. I'm giving this place five stars because it consistently holds up as a high-quality neighborhood restaurant, providing yummy food, nice atmosphere and friendly folks.", "author": "Zoe H."}

When you go, expect to pay at least $10 - $15 for your lunch because it is quite up there in price if you are on a tight budget (like I am) but it is definitely worth it. Among the group of people I was with, most people did not finish their meals because they were quite large in proportion to their body size. I decided to join in and take some of their meals altogether. For my meal, I got the crepe with chocolate which was indeed a nice choice because it was filled with many dessert flavors such as whipped-cream and vanilla ice cream on the side, a perfect meal for a nice summer afternoon. Out of the other eighteen people that went, I happen to try the eggs benedict which had a nice and delightful taste, but I felt that I had to add tabasco sauce to complete the meal.

If you get a whole one you may need to take some home.  There is a great range of these as well.  The service is usually good and the food is consistently excellent and reasonably priced.

We are all very fair, so I requested an outdoor table, if it was in the shade. Otherwise I expressed that inside would be fine.\nThe host assured me that all the outside tables were in the shade.\nWhile I was waiting, 3 other parties came in;  one pair, a family with a stroller and a couple with a dog.\nThe pair and the dog party were addressed went off to the outside.  Another employee asked if I had been assisted.  I told him that I had checked in with the host, but he had gone to seat others who had come after me.This employee immediately took us outside to a table, which unfortunately was in the sun!\nThere was another empty table in the shade, and I asked if we could sit there.  I was told that the party with the stroller would have to sit there.  He pointed out another table that was being cleared.  I am handicapped, so standing and waiting was a stretch, but we did.\n\nWhen we walked over to the table, the party with the dog said that that table had been promised to them.  I then told the employee I would like to sit inside, as there were a number of empty tables there.\nGraciously, the dog party took the table in the sun (at their suggestion) and we were seated in the shade. Once seated the service was very good and the food consistant as ever! The crab was fresh and the waiter attentive.\nSOOO..on my next visit I may have to bring my dog or a stroller!

And for a tater girl, that is definitely worth an extra star. \n\nI usually always go for the salads--fresh and flavorful and not too drowned down by dressing. But this afternoon I had the Seal Rock (smoked salmon on a bagel). It was my first sandwich there so I can't speak for the rest of the sammies, but I think the crepes and salads are more their forte. The BF had a chicken kabob sandwich that looked mighty tasty tho. Dad had the chicken shwarma special--I stole a bite and it was better than my dish.

The restaurant was not crazy busy but there was several seats taken inside to the rear so we opted to sit outside where there were only two other tables being used. As we settled in the menu came out quickly but no drink order requested, no water brought. We sat there for 25 mins. and there was not 1 glance 1 acknowledgement from the two waitress that came out a total of 9 times between them to attend to the other two tables. I am blown away by this service or lack there of since I have been a loyal customer for the past 5 years. This 1 bad experience will keep me away from patronizing this establishment. We never got water, we never were waited on and as we walked out there was barely a glance in our direction.

You don't have to wait long for a table, perhaps 10-15 minutes during peak Sunday brunch.  Coffee and tea are available free of charge for those who are waiting.  Service can be inconsistent - sometimes I've had very prompt and friendly service, other times I'm flagging down the waiter.  It's not too loud nor too quiet and is particularly good for families in the outdoor patio area.  The outside noise is perfect for letting the kids run around and is successful at reducing the crying baby noise the next table over.  Usually, the menus of brunch spots can overwhelm you with the number of options on hand - this place does a great job at having the right amount of the right type of food for everyone.  It strikes a good balance - not too California-fusion-breakfast-y nor too Denny's-greasy-ish.  My favorite items on the menu are the Provence Egg Scramble, the Bodega Bay Tuna Melt, and the generously sized mimosas.  The food is consistent, can be overwhelming (recommend sharing if possible), and worth the price.  Strengths: good breakfast food at good prices, great outdoor patio on a bright SF day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-01", "description": "This has always been one of our go to places when going into to the city and not wanting to spend a lot on a decent meal.  We have not been in for several months, but we both know what we like so we barely looked at the menu.  My husband didn't even open his at all.  \n\nSo our food came, it was nice, nothing spectacular, the home fries a little dry and tasted like they gave me the scrapings at the bottom of the pan. The crepes were good as usual. \n\nAnd then the bill came.  And then we noticed the $1 SF Health Fee for each of us.  Having moved away from San Francisco last year we were unaware of this new issue going on in the city recently.  When we asked our waitress she \"educated\" us by implying the law that was passed was for this charge on our bill.  I had to keep probing her to finally determine that the law has nothing to do with the $1 charge on our bill.  The law is about the employer's responsibility to pay health care for their employees depending on the amount of people they employ.  She kept implying though that this charge WAS the law.  I asked her if we could dispute it and she said no we could not because it is on the menu.  I could have pointed out that as regular (and used to be loyal...sorry savor you lost us...) we don't really scrutinize the menu at all and never saw it and therefore should not have to pay it, but I didn't.  \n\nInstead we deducted the amount from our server's tip. I know you are all going to tell me how unfair this is and that she shouldn't be penalized for this, but I don't feel the customers should be penalized for a health fee that the employer is obligated to pay for.   It especially irked me because just that day I had mailed off my own health insurance payment for several hundred dollars that I pay for entirely myself without any employer contribution at all. So not only did I have to pay for my health insurance, I had to contribute to my server's insurance.  \n\nI am all for giving people access to health insurance at reasonable fees, but this is just not the way to go about it.  Especially because it is such an unfair fee.  If the city wants to roll it into a local income tax apportioned according to income, that is fair, but to charge me a $1 when a $1 means a whole lot these days and also charge the millionaire sitting next to me the same $1 which probably doesn't hurt his pocketbook as much does not make sense.  I am especially upset that we are not even residents of San Francisco anymore and we made the very long and with gas prices these days, expensive, drive into the city just to patronize this restaurant.\n\nMy hope is that the servers will push back at their employers because they are getting short changed in their tips and the employers will reconsider this ridiculous surcharge.  \n\nAt any rate,  we will definitely think very hard next time about coming into the city to eat at any of the restaurants that charge this fee in any form.", "author": "mariana c."}

We ordered and asked if we could get cheese on half of the potatoes.  Her response was she could bring some cheese and we could put it on half.  When our order came, she brought a pile of dry cheddar of pre-shredded cheese from a bag on  a side plate.  It was the most unappetizing, most ridiculous situation.  Plus our food tasted like it had sat awhile and our potatoes weren't hot.  After we were finished we sat there for twenty minutes with dirty dishes in front of us waiting for our check.
