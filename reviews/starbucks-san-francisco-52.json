If you know me or have followed me on yelp long enough, you'd know that I'm obsessed with Starbucks. This Castro location is definitely one of my favorites.\n\nCastro Starbucks is no different than the other ones in terms of their drinks. It's your standard frappuccinos, lattes, and teas. The service here has always been friendly when I've been here. Some employees are also eye candies, so that helps. Though, on occasion I do get the \"sassy gay\" who has no R-E-S-P-E-C-T. You better listen to Aretha.\n\nI think for the most part, the location of this Starbucks is why it's my favorite. I mean, it's in the heart of Castro District! The view is amazing. Overlooking the rainbow colors and different people walking by. On a good sunny day I enjoy getting a cold drink and walking around the area with my boyfriend. Or even at night, seeing all the people party it up! \n\nThe layout is a little too small, but everyone seems to be on-the-go nowadays, so it doesn't really matter. \n\nI can't really tell anyone to go to Castro just for a damn latte, but it's definitely a great location for a Starbucks. More than anything, I love this place because it's in the Castro District. Basic, standard Starbucks, with a great and historical front yard!\n\nAgain, my name is Oliver, and I am a Starbucks addict.", "author": "Oliver B."}

You'd think the first thing out of my mouth would have been a phrase of acknowledgment, but instead I said, \"Please, don't hate me.\"\n\nWhile the #unicorn phenom is currently taking Instagram by storm (because you know, #eatingfortheinsta), Starbucks was smart to bank in on it. Of course, the demographic is primarily young girls. Imagine the barista's surprise when a 30-year-old, brown, round, woman with grey hairs ordered up this limited edition sugary drink. I watched while the pissed off barista started on the Unicorn. It was a lot less involved than I anticipated. A little bit of milk, some raspberry-colored powder, some pumps of flavoring, a long squirt of blue gunk on the inside rim of the cup, a blitz in the Vitamix, topped with whipped cream and a sprinkling of fairy dust. Boom. I opted for the small. But, the obviously unteenaged dude behind me, went balls out and ordered a large. I was impressed.\n\nAnd sugary it was. I only lasted five sips of this skittles-flavored concoction before I passed out in my GTI from a diabetic coma. When I came to, I puked a rainbow on the sidewalk.", "author": "Illyanna M."}

Because it's 4 blocks from my house, and the people who work here are really nice!  And they caught on to the fact that I get a grande coffee every time I go in (though I do switch up whether I do the light or dark roast)... So they are ready to execute as soon as they see me!\n\nBut, if I were to really, truly compare this to other Starbucks, how does it do?  Pretty good.  Because the line's never very long (they have 5 people working there in the morning!), they almost almost always have something besides Pike Place roast on drip (I can't stand Pike Place), and it's usually clean.\n\nWhich Starbucks are better?  The one on Bryant in Inner Mission is really nice... the people are friendly there too, there's a ton of space to sit, and they have a Clover machine!!  With all the Starbucks Reserve coffees!!  Oh, how much I love Starbucks Reserve...\n\nWhich Starbucks are worse?  The one on Fulton in Western Addition.  They once had only Pike Place on drip and the dude serving me REFUSED to to a single-brew of it because he personally despised that brewing technique (note: Every other Starbucks I've been to has happily made single-cups).  And the one on Market in the Safeway complex, in Castro.  That place is so friggen dirty all the time, the staff is mean, and they suck at making coffee.  I don't know how they suck at it, it seems pretty easy, but they're often out of things and other times their coffee isn't quite right.\n\nOK, very long-winded review of just ONE Starbucks... but again, 18th St Starbucks is great, I'm really happy to have it in my neighborhood.", "author": "Jon E."}

The majority of cafes tend to overlook the chocolate drinks and water them down. What the hell? If I wanted watery hot cocoa, I'd dump a teaspoon of Hershey's syrup into a cup of hot water and call it a day. (Peet's I am looking at you!) \n\nStarbucks knows what it's doing with the hot cocoa. I don't care if their coffee is over-roasted or if they're a great example of commercialism running amok. What I DO care about is that they took my favorite drink and turned the amplifier up to 11. Their hot chocolate is good, but their seasonal Signature Hot Chocolate....omg. Let me die happy in chocolaty orgasmic bliss now. \n\nAn analogy: \n\nA good guy is one that is tall, handsome, funny, treats his girl well, has no serious issues, and is decent in bed. \n\nA great guy is one that your friends tell you to shut up because no they don't care that he has a dimple only on one side of his face and that he plans on being a millionaire by 30 but only after spending three years working in a non profit saving little babies and they really don't want to hear about that night in the hotel room with the removable shower head. \n\nI have found my perfect hot cocoa, and I get my fix from Starbies frequently because of it. Perfect guy? Definitely not at this location, though if I were 20 years older and 200 lbs heavier not to mention a dude, I'd be on the right track.

And since he's a beard-clad, hairy \"daddy\" bear, this makes things a bit awkard. Whenever I'm there with him, I always get the, \"Oh honey, is this gorgeous man your father? I wish he was MY daddy\" \n\nand of course I smile, laugh and take large gulps of my Carmel Apple Spice, trying to scald the awkward weird visions of my father and his suitors from my brain.
