I ordered me and my boyfriends go to meal, from our go to Chiness Food Restaurant. Sweet and Sour Pork, BBQ Pork Chow Mein, and Mu Shu Pork. It's common knowledge that you include Mu Shu Sauce when you order Mu Shu... like come on it's in the name. It's just a huge disappointment, and ruined the night. The food came really really early, like way earlier than usual, which is generally a great thing, but now I feel like it was a bad thing because obviously they rushed and forgot stuff. They didn't even include any fortune cookies they rushed so much. I didn't even notice it was missing the Mu Shu Sauce until it was too late because my boyfriend wasn't even home yet. Seriously how can you forget the Mu Shu Sauce... because of this restaurants negligence I came off as a bad girlfriend because I didn't specify that they need to include the Mu Shu Sauce with the Mu Shu Pork... it's like serving a corn dog with no breading on it, it's not a corn dog anymore, it's just a hot dog.. it's not Mu Shu with no Mu Shu Sauce. I'll still give it three stars because my past experiences were fine, but still nothing spectacular. I really hope they lose this negligence, and realize that most people will prefer to have thier orders be correct and not lacking key components rather than it arriving early.", "author": "Genevieve S."}

My husband and I love to try new places and decided to take our chances on this restaurant. We ordered take out from Bamboo, a large variety of items in the dinner menu. Probably the best hot and sour soup we've ever had. The sad part (and the reason I'm writing this review) was that we found a dead/cooked cockroach in the chowmein. We were so worried there would be more bugs in the other dishes we'd ordered, we had to throw everything out. Not to mention the nausea we felt, knowing we had already finished the soup.

Our first red flag was it was completely empty. The server immediately brought us a pot of hot tea, which was complementary.\n\nWe had a vegetable pot stickers, veggie chow mein , and a generals meatless chicken with rice. \n\nThe pot stickers were delicious! The sauce they came with seemed like soy sauce plus extra seasoning. I dabbed a bit of Sriracha on it and wow! They were devoured and made me anticipate our entr\u00e9es more.\n\nThe chow mein was an immediate disappointment with the first bite. I added some soy sauce and Sriracha (fixer of all things) in attempts to salvage the dish because I was starving. A couple more bites and I couldn't do it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 liked the meatless chicken dish. I had a bite and really liked it too until I kept chewing and all of a sudden the flavor was gone and all I could taste was old oil. \n\nI couldn't finish my meal beyond the few bites I had.

The overall takeaway is still disappointing. \n\nCalled in a to-go order which to their credit was ready in under 15 mins. The appetizer platter was decent -  fried spring rolls, fried chicken wings, fried crab Rangoon, and pot stickers. It's hard to fault fried food. Oddly though, the shrimp crackers were stale. \n\nOrdered a typically pretty insider-Chinese dish - salted fish and chicken fried rice. I was hoping the quality would be better given its niche appeal. I knew it was wrong the moment I opened the box. The fried rice was brown which meant they fried it with soy sauce. It was just salt overload when combined with the salted fish. Instead of little bits of salted fish throughout, they had huge chunks of it in there. To make things worse, huge fish bones that they don't bother to pull out. \n\nOverall just sloppy preparation and there's just better Chinese food to be had in the vicinity.", "author": "Jon L."}

The main reason is that the owner and hands-on manager, Eddie, will do whatever it takes to please his customers. Every human being makes mistakes, with me at the head of that very long line; but when Bamboo makes the occasional mistake, they do not act like Donald God's-Gift-to-the-Rest-of-Us-Shmoos Trump, but they do their very best first off to acknowledge that mistake, sincerely apologize for it, and then go on to correct their infrequent mistake by going the extra mile to make sure you get more than originally ordered FOR FREE! These folks at Bamboo are really authentic and empathetic human beings who have your best interests at heart as their valued customers.

I asked for freaking Orange Chicken not BBQ Chicken),and not even spicy as their advertisement suggests. What happened to the red peppers I remembered from before??? None.

The menu is extensive, so it goes beyond the usual culprits (i.e., mushu, broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork, etc.). I've been coming here for the past 10 years, and have probably tried at least 1/3 of the menu. Everything is solid, not great, but then again no one wins Michelin stars for American Chinese. What is important is that I've always had a good meal at a reasonable price, without the not so mysterious post-meal MSG stomach ache. \n\nSecond, the service: it's owner operated, and unlike many other similar establishments, the owner isn't cantankerous to customers. Service is fast, they follow up on water refills, etc. I'd compare service to a well-run Denny's or IHOP - and I mean that in the best possible way. \n\nThird, the ambiance: clean place for being in the not yet completely gentrified part of Polk Street. Certainly better decorated and cleaner than most \"mom and pop\" Chinese restaurants. Also, they usually play classical music in the background. It's random, not too loud, and overall pleasant. \n\nOverall, great place to get some Chinese food without dropping $100 for molecular gastronomy pork with godknowswhat sauce and an hour line to sit on a barstool.\n\n(From the viewpoint of someone who has waited an hour to sit down on multiple occasions and spent way too much on fancy-a$$ food.)", "author": "Oleg A."}

At 7:50, I thought it was strange that the food hadn't arrived because Bamboo is usually fast so I called to check on the stud of my order.  I was told that the driver left 20 minutes ago.  At 8:15, the food still had not arrived so I called again.  I was told again that the food was already on the way.  At 830, I picked up my phone to cancel the order when I received a call from the driver.  \n\nI opened my door and nobody was there.  I walked out to the street and looked around for a few minutes.  Finally, I saw him get out of his car with the food.  How hard is it to ring the doorbell and meet me at the door like a decent delivery driver?  He handed me the food and immediately demanded a tip.  I told him no.  He started yelling in broken English that I was was wasting his money and said multiple times that I shouldn't order anymore.\n\nAfter this experience, he won't need to worry about that.  That delivery driver just lost Bamboo all my future business.  I had some food delivery jobs when I was younger and am normally a heavy tipper because I understand how it is.

Hard to find in the city, especially since it's not the most authentic thing you could order.\n\nWent into the restaurant to order take out and they served hot green tea while the food was being prepared. They have a turtle in an aquarium but it's really shy so I didn't bug it too much. A few homeless people walked in too, so they provided some entertainment as well. \n\nKung Pao Chicken was delish!

However, after I yelped this place and read the mixed reviews, I decided to take the risk and go with it since I was near the area and really in for some Chinese.\n\nThe waitress was extremely welcoming and sat me down with a menu and hot tea in a very prompt manner. As I was waiting for the order, the owner Eddy came out and greeted me with a very unforgettable laugh. He began conversing with me about the restaurant and its origin of 20 years, and he was very social and comfortable to speak with. The interior of the restaurant was also extremely warm and inviting, a bit small, but cozy nonetheless. I loved watching the turtles they had, bobbing their heads as slow as, well, turtles (ha). I ordered the Eggplant in Plum Sauce and was delighted to find that it suited my taste-buds just dandy. The eggplant was cooked perfectly with a crisp edge, drenched in a sticky, gooey, plum sauce. My wallet did not suffer with the large portions they cooked for me. \n\nIf I'm ever in the area, I will definitely pay Eddy another visit. I'm compelled to give this business four stars because not only is the atmosphere inviting, the food I was served was definitely spot on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-26", "description": "It was Christmas Night and all through the city, not a restaurant was open, not even Grubstake. So I ended up at this little Chinese restaurant on Polk Street. I would have been better off starving. \n\nSo I went in with my brother and my boyfriend, who ordered some pork dish, while my brother ordered kung pao chicken, and I ordered a mock meat dish, which the waitress compared to kung pao chicken. \n\nOur appetizers -- they got pork potstickers and I got vegetarian potstickers and green onion pancakes -- were OK; they liked theirs and I liked the potstickers, but wasn't crazy about the pancakes. They were too much like crispy tortillas with very little filling and smothered in a peanut sauce, which would have been OK on its own, but it was just too overwhelming for the flimsy pancakes. \n\nThen our entrees came. The waitress brought me the \"meatless chicken\" dish and I verified with her that it was indeed that. She said \"yes.\" Then my brother got his \"chicken\" dish and my boyfriend his pork dish. \n\nMy boyfriend spent half the time frustratingly picking the onions and bell peppers off his dish, while my brother and I dug into our dishes. Or I should say, I did. My brother was just not into his dish, but I was eating mine. I kept saying how even though it's been 20 years since I've eaten chicken, my dish really tasted like it. But I've had a lot of mock meat that does, so it wasn't too surprising. \n\nFinally I asked my boyfriend and brother to taste it to see how amazing it is, and they were like, \"We think that's chicken.\" My brother was then convinced that the reason he didn't like his dish was because it isn't. \n\nSo I called the waitress and asked her if my dish is indeed chicken or not and somehow the story changed and she said it's not. I asked her why she said something different when she initially placed it in front of me. She said she needed to call another waitress to help me. \n\nWhen the other waitress came, I explained that not only do I not eat meat, but also being Jewish, I was extra annoyed, because it was non-kosher meat (as if she knows what that means!). All she said was that the chef must have mixed up the orders. She then just tried to switch our plates (as if we couldn't do that on our own). I just told her to take my plate away, of which I only ate 1/5, and to just take it off the bill. She took it away and said, \"OK.\" \n\nOf course when we got the bill the dish was still on it. We asked the waitress about it and she said that I had eaten a lot of it (not true), so that's why we're being charged for it. I said that's unacceptable and she said she'd talk to her boss. Finally she came back and it was taken off. That was little compensation. A simple apology would have gone a lot further for me. \n\nI'm not one of those vegetarians who freaks out about stuff like this and whines that I now have a graveyard in my stomach or need to throw up for three days to get the chicken out of my system.  I have perspective. But I am someone who had an annoying experience, who feels that people should make up for their mistakes -- at bare minimum with an apology.", "author": "Josh R."}

It's a clean, nicely decorated restaurant located on the same block as Victor's Pizza and directly across the street from the Titanium training center.  With the cold and wet weather we've been having lately I was looking forward to some spicy Hunan cuisine to warm me up.\n\nI got in before 5 PM which meant I could still order from the lunch menu.  I liked their \"Create Your Own Lunch Combo\" which allows the diner to select two items from a select list, along with either white rice, brown rice or egg fried rice plus an egg roll for $6.75.  I chose the Mongolian Beef and the Ma Po Tofu with brown rice.\n\nMy meal started with a pot of hot tea and a hot bowl of soup.  In a lightly seasoned clear broth were cabbage, carrots, broccoli and tofu.  It was quite tasty and a good starter to the meal.  My menu choice was ready soon after, and I was surprised by the large portion on a round serving plate.  \n\nThe Mongolian Beef had lots of beef slices, white onion, green onions and scallions in a spicy brown sauce.  I liked the fact that very little (if any) tenderizer ingredient was used on the beef allowing me to get the full beef texture and flavor.  Some restaurants use tons of baking soda on their meats to tenderize it, but I didn't seem to get that here.  The Ma Po Tofu was just okay with tofu (medium firm), green onion, peas and carrots in a brown sauce.  The sauce was not as spicy as I would have liked, and the slight sweetness was a bit awkward.  The monster portion of the brown rice was terrific mixed in with the spice from the Mongolian Beef.  \n\nThe egg roll was pretty blah with a fairly bland filling of unseasoned cabbage.

We were going to order three entrees, when the waiter suggested that three entrees would be a lot of food. It was great to hear that this restaurant wasn't trying to push sales on us, and was willing to help us out.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\nhot and sour soup\nsesame chicken\nwalnut prawns\n\nI was not a fan of the hot and sour soup. It was overall, too spicy for my taste. S enjoyed it though! The sesame chicken and walnut prawns were both great. \n\nTo be clear, this is takeout Chinese food, and I have to say it is reliably tasty, not as greasy as most places, and also has good delivery services.\n\nAfter the first dine-in experience, we have been mainly getting takeout from them, and they are quick everytime! Online ordering also makes things very easy.", "author": "Alison C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-16", "description": "This was the most disappointing Chinese food experience I have ever had.  I am not a negative yelp reviewer but with this low of quality people should be warned.  My roommates and I decided to order some of the most basic items that cannot be messed up by even the most elementary Chinese restaurant.  To start the cream cheese wontons that we ordered were horrific.  The texture of the wonton itself was not crispy nor soft, just a leathery texture that left me with cuts and disdain in my mouth that I still can't shake.  A wonton is supposed to be crispy, simple as that.  Then instead of cream cheese, it was a minuscule piece of minced meat, it was unidentifiable and resembled what I would assume rat tastes like.  Then move to the fried rice.  I mean fried rice is a staple of many Asian meals and one of the easiest things to prepare, but somehow Bamboo messed it up.  The rice felt like I was putting spoonfuls of sand in to my mouth.  After I added a healthy amount of soy sauce I was able to choke down the \"fried rice soy sauce soup\".  Possibly od-ed in salt after this meal just so I could taste something pleasant.  We did not even receive our chow mein that we ordered which was probably a blessing in disguise because of the low caliber of the rest of the meal.  The sesame chicken was soaked in sauce and hard to chew so I assume that this was also labeled chicken but really some type of rodent.  I could keep going but you get the point.  \n\nActually my favorite part of it all was the fact that the delivery guy had the nerve to call my roommate and demand her to walk out to his car.  Talk about service, its 2013 bud, get off your ass and do your job.  Delivery means to our doorstep.  \n\nRun Run Run away from Bamboo as fast as possible.", "author": "Patrice K."}

A friend had said several times that we'd check it out and I finally dragged a friend to it when looking for dinner Friday night. Despite it being 8 pm or so on a Friday, it wasn't busy at all. We were able to grab a seat quickly and get our food delivered toot sweet.\n\nPros: extremely affordable prices ($24 for two of us and we both ordered a cup of hot and sour soup plus an entree each), extremely fast service, friendly and courteous wait staff (our waters were refilled often), complimentary tea, and fake meat options for the vegetarians (this is one of the things that *really* makes me happy with Chinese food restaurants, and it isn't as common to get as one would think!)\n\nCons: the interior of the restaurant is pretty small, tables are almost side by side. Makes it a wee bit difficult for conversations that you don't want to share with the general public other than your dinner companions. Also, the menu seems to be a little bit mislabeled. I ordered the General Meatless Chicken and there were no chili pepper markers on it (which indicate spicy). My first bite had me coughing from the overwhelming vinegar and spiciness of it. It wasn't over-the-top spicy that I couldn't eat it, but it definitely wasn't mild in the least. As it hadn't been marked, I was a bit unprepared for the heat. \n\nI would happily go back here and think I might make this my general goto place for delivery from now on as it's just right around the corner. While the hot and sour soup isn't the best I've had, it's pretty damn good in general, and with the fake meat dishes, I'd be more than happy to try it again.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The food was awful and I will never eat here again.\n\nOrdered black beans & chicken over rice.  Got a plate of chicken, squash, carrots and bell peppers (nothing really Chinese about that) covered in a dark and thick soy based sauce with no evidence of black beans in it.  The sauce in this dish is typically light because the black beans provide the flavor.  The rice also seemed to have been reheated because it was hard.  The meal included a fried egg roll and a wedge of orange plus a bowl of soup.  The egg roll and orange were ok but there was nothing Chinese about the soup -- it was  basically chicken broth w/a few veggies in it -- broccoli and cabbage.\n\nThe meal was cheap ($5.65) but had nothing else going for it.

Both were quick, large portions, and tasty! I have had orange chicken, general cho's chicken, and hunan beef. They were all delicious, had tons of sauce (which I love so I can mix it with my rice), and had good spice to them. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the 2 chickens, but at least they were good! \n\nThe restaurant itself is actually really cute. It is on Polk street right across from the Polk street gym. The restaurant has plants, nice fabric on the ceiling, and a great background music that actually sounds authentic. As soon as you sit, they bring you a teapot. There was only one other table when I was there because we were there between 4 and 5 which is obviously a very odd time. However, it was good for us because we still got there in time for the lunch special. For less than 6 dollars you get a meat choice, rice, and egg roll or for less than 8 dollars you get 2 meat choices, rice, and egg roll. \n\nThe one complaint I have on this place is the egg roll. Neither me or the guest I went with liked the egg roll.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-14", "description": "I'm so sad. I normally do a ton of reading/research on yelp before going to a doctor or eating from a restaurant. What's horrible is that I spent about 20 minutes reading 2 pages of lengthy reviews for Bamboo and even though 1/2 were horrible 1 star reviews, I took a chance anyway since there were a few 4 star reviews and I wanted to try something different. I had hopes that I would agree with those few people who actually liked it. It was late and I was ordering online--I was feeling spontaneous! :(\n\nI used to LOVE Yum Yum House which closed down---and I hear Big Lantern is the same owner but I don't think it's as good. Jasmine Tea House is ok too but I was curious to try a new 'General Tso Meatless Chicken\" since veggie Chinese chicken is always good (or so I thought) and I actually figured most places used the same stuff (I think a lot of places use Leona's). I mean, how can you go wrong with deep fried soy protein balls covered in a sweet and spicy sauce? YUCK! \n\nI read another review which said they felt bad throwing away the food they just spent money on. I ordered:\n\nGeneral Tso Meatless Chicken\nVegetable Chow Mein\nWhite Rice\n\nThe veggie chicken looked amazing, but I took one bite and immediately spit it out. It had an awful rubbery-bouncy texture (not like other soy chickens I've had that shreds more) that I could barely chew and bland sauce. There were ZERO vegetables (lots of places serve this with at least a good serving of crisp green broccoli) and I couldn't even eat ONE piece...and I NEVER throw food out...I love food and am not picky. I enjoy delicious fresh organic food but will enjoy an occasional crappy piece of frozen pizza or chinese food any day.\n\nI added the veggie chow mein even though it'd be too much food, because I needed to meet the $15 minimum for delivery (i love eat24hours.com) and figured that would be hard to screw up. The chow mein was so bland that even when I re-sauteed it with garlic , onion and shoyu it was still bleh. I liked that it had a lot of bright crisp veggies though, I'll give them that.\n\nSomeone said they screwed up the white rice. My rice was actually perfect. It was soft and steaming when I opened it. Too bad I didn't have anything to eat it with :( I was excited to eat the fortune cookie but noticed it had hydrogenated cottonseed oil which I couldn't bring myself to eat (if hydrogenated oil wasn't bad enough--cottonseed is the most toxic!) \n\nI just wasted $20. I should've just ordered from Big Lantern and saved on the gas emissions from him coming from Polk st (I'm in the Mission). \n\nOh, and when the delivery guy came, he told me I owed him money even though I paid online with my credit card 30 minutes ago. He tried to check his phone and finally believed me when I told him I paid through eat24hours.com.", "author": "katherine m."}

The advertised time is 45 minutes and they got here in just over 20.  Granted, I do live in Nob Hill, 0.5 miles away.\n\nThe vegetable egg rolls aren't the most flavorful I've had, but they are definitely made with fresh vegetables--there was an unmistakable cabbage crunch in every bite.\nThe egg flower with sweet corn soup was also kind of bland, but that's what it's always like, right?  It's filled with sweet corn, carrots and peas that are also quite fresh and surprisingly really crunchy.\nSesame chicken is one of my favorites and it's listed under Chef's Recommendations, so I had to try it out here and I am not disappointed.  The chicken isn't overwhelmingly battered--those tiny pieces scattered around aren't bits of batter, they are actually chicken!  It has a rich flavor and delightfully light crunch.\n\nOrdering online was a breeze, but I had to switch browsers because zonic ordering isn't well-supported on Google Chrome.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-17", "description": "Let's start this review with a story.\n\nMy friend, whom we will call \"Norman\" for the duration of the review (name changed to protect the ..critic), is extremely picky and often not willing to try new places.  \"Norman\" is also the one who bitched and moaned about going to Loving Cup because it wasn't his beloved tried-and-true Tuttimelon, and then ended up falling in lurrve with Loving Cup and went there four days in a row after his first time.\n\n\"Norman\" is kind of a night owl, and when we hang out to have dinner, it's usually past 9 or 10 PM.  Yesterday, I was the one who had to work late, so I picked him up around 10:15 and faced the dilemma of finding a place nearby (Polk St.) to eat.  \"Norman\" was dismayed to find that Tai Chi, one of his favorite shrimp war wonton soup joints, was closed already, and as we headed up Polk, he found out that the Vietnamese place a few blocks up was also closed.  Since I'd snagged a spot in front of Bamboo, I quickly Yelped it on my iPhone and saw that it had 3 stars.\n\nA quick peek inside showed zero people eating, but the \"OPEN\" sign was still lit.  When \"Norman\" looked inside and pointed to the door, the waitstaff motioned for us to come on in, and after deliberating for a few seconds (\"There's no one inside!\" \"Well maybe because it's 10:30 already and the majority of the Bay Area is done eating dinner?\"), we walked in and were seated.\n\nIt's a tiny restaurant that's relatively clean.  No hours are posted, but I think they close at 11 PM.  It doesn't seem very \"Chinese\" because the menu only had items written in English.  Weird, right?\n\nSo we sat and ordered: green onion pancakes with peanut sauce (what?? peanut sauce?), and \"Norman\" had the bamboo war wonton soup, and I just had the regular wonton soup.  They have either a small or large size, and I asked how many wontons were in the small bowl.  The waiter said 4, so I told him that I wanted the large bowl.\n\nThe green onion pancakes were kind of really crispy, not quite what I'm used to at other Chinese restaurants.  There was an unsweetened peanut sauce spread on top (think old-fashioned, salted peanut butter, not the Jif kind), and I have to admit, it tasted kind of good with the peanut sauce.  I tried licking all the peanut sauce off and then tasting the pancake, but the peanut sauce definitely gave it a different kind of taste and texture that I preferred.\n\nThe wonton soup actually really sucked.  Majorly.  On a scale of 1 to 10, \"Norman\" and I decided that it was either at a 3 or 4.  It had a tiny fingernail-sized lump of pork with ginger, and it was completely enveloped in a thicker wonton skin.  The broth was mostly flavorless, but had some sweetness to it.  Not even soy sauce and gratuituous amounts of salt could save my soup, so I sucked it up and ate my wontons, making a mental note to never come back.\n\nAfter dinner, \"Norman,\" who knows I Yelp a lot, told me that I needed to review it stat. So, kudos for accepting credit cards, staying open late and being clean.  After we started eating a few more couples came in and ate well past their open sign turning off, and no one rushed them or acted pissed off that they were staying past closing.\n\n$18ish before tip.  $22 total for a completely unsatisfying meal.  I wonder how the rest of their food tastes, since apparently Wilhelm Y. liked their Mongolian Beef.  Maybe I'll stop by sometime when it's lunchtime, so the prices are cheaper.", "author": "Tori S."}

I would even order it for lunch delivery in the Financial District during wet weather and everyone at work would regret not ordering with me when I asked them if they were in or not.\n\nHere's what is still delicious about the Wor Wonton soup:\n1. can replace beef with decent quality chicken\n2. contains juicy shrimp, although in smaller quantities\n3. has baby bok choy\n3. same amazing ginger with green onion broth.\n\nHALLOWEEN COMES EARLY\nHere's what has changed for the worse:\nA. Replaced wontons filled with pork and chives/green onions with some kind of mystery meat that tastes gross.\n\nMYSTERY MEAT - WHOSE MURDER IS IT?\nI don't eat mystery meat if I can tell it's mystery meat.  Ground meat at a restaurant is considered mystery meat in my eyes.  I don't like meat scrapings.  No hot dogs from the non-licensed vendor on the corner of Mission and whatever for me.  No hand rolls using scraped fish pieces because who knows what type of fish I'm really getting.  And definitely no packaged ground meat from the local grocery store.  I'd rather eat vegetarian food.  Now, I'm not saying that there's not some savvy food entrepreneur who hasn't sold me a false bill of goods, telling me that I'm eating a certain animal or animal part when it's (fill in unappetizing flesh here).  But I go out of my way to avoid mystery meat and do whatever I can to know what I'm eating, ever since some fly-over-state coworkers thought they'd try to pull one over me by having me try Rocky Mountain Oysters which have NOTHING to do with Oysters - luckily the waiter took pity on me and warned me off the Rocky Mountain Oysters.\n\nThe reason why I say that the wontons are filled with mystery meat is because it's ground meat, ground so fine it's impossible to tell what it was unless you send it for analysis at a lab.  And it doesn't taste like the pork that I'm used to eating at Chinese restaurants, but maybe that's because I DON'T ORDER GROUND PORK at Chinese restaurants.\n\nMYSTERY MEAT HELPS CONTROL PORTION SIZE IN TIME FOR HOLIDAY DIETING\nI was greedy and I had ordered two Wor Wonton Soups for two separate meals.  It was so bad that both soups turned into 4 meals even after I had picked out all the wontons out of the soup since they just grossed me out so much.\n\nTURNING JAPANESE\nIt will be a while before I go out to try a wor wonton soup anywhere.  for now, I think I will stick to the chicken and veggie and egg udon soup at one local japanese restaurant or the veggie soba soup at another as that's what I've been using to cleanse my palate for the last two days since you know what.", "author": "Geeta S."}

The infection is believed to have started at a local Chinese restaurant named Bamboo off of Polk and California. Witnesses state that the first \"Infected\", as they are now being called, burst through the door of the restaurant and immediately began attacking men, women, and children, anybody in possession of water, juice, or a sports drink. Scientists state that MSG Rage causes \"extreme swelling of the brain, numbness of extremities, and a vicious, unquenchable thirst.\"\n\nA local man, Sam Kingsworth, was the only person at the restaurant to have escaped infection. \"It was horrible\" he sputtered out, in between tears and gasping breaths. \"We had come here for lunch, you know me and some coworkers. I had just taken a bite of the fried rice, and it was horrible, just absolutely horrible. It tasted like Pez, you know those little candies, like some one crushed em up. Fried rice isn't supposed to taste like Pez! Oh God!\"\n\nHis hands shook as he recalled the terrible events that were about to unfold. \"And then Jimmy\" he continued \"and then Jimmy started eating his sweet and sour pork, and all of a sudden he starts twitching and shaking and slobbering out his mouth. And then he grabs my glass of water and drinks it, drinks the whole damn thing. And I say \"Jimmy you son of a bitch\", cuz you know we would call each other sons of bitches and what not, and I say \"That's my goddamn water Jimmy\" and he throws the glass across the room and looks me in the eye and hisses \"Whhhhaaaahhhhtttteer! Waater\" And I'm lookin him in the eyes and I know that Jimmy ain't there no more.\"\n\nKingsworth states that soon after, his other two coworkers started exhibiting the same symptoms. \"Then Mike and Larry are shaking and screaming, and they start fighting each other over the last glass of water. Larry smashes the glass over Mike's head, and kills him, and there's no more water. Then Larry starts looking at me and I know what he's thinking, because Larry's always talking about this survival course he took a few years back in Michigan, and how they said if you are ever dying of dehydration to eat the eyeballs of whatever you kill, because it's got a lot of electrolytes. \"I'd do it, you bet your ass I would!\" he would always say. And I yell \"You ain't eating my eyeballs you crazy son of a bitch!\" and stab him in the neck with my chopstick.\"\n\nReports cite that a man, later identified as Jim Wellswal, ran out of the restaurant with hands full of sweet and sour pork, stuffing it down the mouths of whomever he could catch, infecting them.

I love the fact that they offer fluffy brown rice as an alternative to white rice and they serve free soup and salad at dinnertime. The soup is a simple veggie broth with assorted vegetables. Some people may find it bland, but I find it comforting and warming on a cold San Francisco night. The salad consists of shredded purple cabbage with a sesame dressing. Am I the only person who loves cabbage? It seems I'm the only one who chows on this salad. \n\nI often ask the staff to make me custom dishes.

Sure their food is tasty but it's because of all the soy sauce they put in their food.  But the more dishes you order the more they kinda taste the same.  It's as if they've made a vat of one particular sauce and use it for all their dishes.  \n\nHOWEVER-- I would have to say that the General Chao's chicken is quite the delicious treat.  Deep fried goodness with  flavorful seasonings.  \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'll still order from here because they can deliver my food in about about 15 minutes (it comes in handy when I get so busy at my desk that I forget to eat lunch and I look at my clock to realize it's already 3:30pm--yeah happens a lot).\n\nSo 1 star for the fast delivery.  2 stars for the general chao's chicken.

The mu-shu pork was perfectly fine (just what I was craving ~ yummy Sino-American junk food), and the pork pot stickers had a delicious filling (lots of ginger) but wrappers that didn't benefit from their travels through the streets.  The shrimp spring rolls were also solidly good, but unfortunately, \"shrimp\" refers to both the marine food inside and their Billy Barty-esque size.  However, I delighted in each stature-challenged bite.\n\nOnline ordering is available through Delivery.com at no additional charge, $15 minimum, plus you can write comments for each item.  If you like your food extra hot, tell them.  Want 25 extra pancakes?  You got it (for 50 cents each).   I find that ordering online is the surest way to make sure that nothing gets lost in translation, plus you can order on the DL at work and request a future delivery time so that you can chow down soon after getting home.  Bamboo delivers to 94102-05, 94107-09, 94111, 94117, and 94133.\n\nAnd yes, yes, they have a really lousy Health Department rating (41).  But, they were last visited over a year ago, and I prefer to bask in the optimistic hope that they've rocketed up to 51 or 52 by now.

It was at that point I rummaged through my collection of take out menus and settled on Bamboo.\n\nThe fact that I can't note anything particularly good or bad about this place sure speaks to its blandness. The food arrived after a decent wait (about 30 minutes) and was hot, so at least they passed the first test. However, none of the dishes had a distinct spice or flavor.

Seeing the place from the street actually drew me and my dining companion in; we're not from the neighborhood and could be easily seduced by a perceived ambiance (since we had no clue where to eat around here).  \n\nAnd I found the service on this Sunday night to be helpful and efficient; the water and tea never stopped flowing, dirty and done dishes cleared away effortlessly.  The place was mostly empty, but there was definitely a constant flow of sit-down diners and a constant flow of take-out over the time we were there.  They seem to be doing fine.  The food is tasty, but note that part of that is due to the massive amounts of sauce on the veggie dishes; that may or maynot be your style.

But, this experience was not a good one and the food is not good.  Really.\n\nI ordered the chef recommendation: portabello mushroom and shrimp with bok choy.  It was bland.  I was expecting a really nice flavor.  Wasn't there. Nope.  \n\nI also had a side of rice.  I believe the first time in my life when ordering Chinese, I received the rice undercooked and slightly hard.  This is what ruined the dinner.  \n\nDisappointing.\n\nBland flavor and hard rice, NO NO NO...\n\nHowever, I did like:  the very nice employee I ordered from, the delivery itself was said to be 30-40 minutes, but was not even 15 minutes!  That was nice, b/c I was starving!  And finally, the green tea ice cream was full of YUMMMMM...\n\nI won't give them another try.   The uncooked rice really doesn't stick well!!", "author": "Kat M."}

I ordered the shrimp rolls as an appetizer and they were ok, it was mostly filled with the vermicelli noodles and no shrimp!

I mean, if they held back some of it, this place could be bombing!  So my friend and I got there at around 10ish, and stayed pretty much close to closing time.  They had 3-4 tables occupied, which is decent.  One couple behind us were drunk already, and cussing up a storm, but they were funny.  Talking with different accents will always entertain me, since I love to do it myself.  So the menu is your typical huge Chinese menu.  We ordered their popular, semi spicy sesame chicken and tofu with eggplant.  They first served us a cabbage tofu soup.  Packed full of natural cabbage flavor, but bummer. . . .too salty.  They also provided us a plate of shredded lettuce, saturated with some type of creamy mayo glaze. . .. too sweet.  Then the tofu and eggplant came.  The texture of the fried tofu was amazingly fresh and crisp, but the plum sauce. . . .to sweet.  Then the sesame chicken came and it was similar to Panda Express' orange chicken, but  it was. . . . too salty.  Finally, they provided us rice (which wasn't free) and even the damn rice was sweet.  Someone needs to slap that chef's hand whenever he digs his hand into that salt or sugar bucket.  Hold it back dude, or you're gonna ruin the food.  It all tasted amazing, but just too much.  It might save ya some dough if you held back.  So let's hope they read this post and take it into consideration, cuz then this place would be really good and fun to stop by before hitting the bars on Polk.", "author": "Janice F."}

However, I was completely floored at the quality of thier dishes, thier fried rice in particular. I ordered a lunch special with fried rice and can not even begin to describe the poor quality of the rice. I mean it's fried rice, who doesn't know how to make a decent fried rice? All it needs are eggs, rice and some grease. I walked in and ordered before three other parties had come in but they still were served before me! (Huge pet peeve) esp b/c I only get an hour for lunch. Awful meal, really ruined my day. I'll give Bamboo the benefit of the doubt, they might have just had an off day, but I won't take my chances by giving it another shot.", "author": "Han L."}

I was battling hangover central and figured some broth was about the only thing that would soothe the insides.  And I figured Chinese would be really quick delivery.  WRONG.  It took them a fucking hour to get to my house.  And they're five blocks away!!!!!!  The wonton soup itself was fine.  I would have liked more broth and less wontons, but that's just my wrecked digestive system talking.  But I also ordered some General Tso's. Why, I have no idea.  Granted, I think most Chinese food is gross, but this stuff SUCKED.  Like, it was really nasty.  Way too gloopy and sweet.  Ugh.  It is making me physically ill as I type this.

The decor is a couple of notches above what you usually see at cheap Chinese food restaurants... I am Chinese and I am loud (although I really disagree with the stereotype- I just happen to fit both)... I am just trying to explain that I do have cultural understanding as well as a tolerance for talking in a really really loud voice. Howwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwever the waitress who served me YELLED AT ME in a hostile-ish tone without the hostile-ish posturing every time she spoke with me and that was a little, well... very perturbing to me....

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-05-23", "description": "This was my first experience at Bamboo, and all I have to say is that I'm probably not going back. Do not order the wonton soup -- no flavor in the soup at all (it's just water, oil, and green onions) and their wontons were too gingery with no other flavors at all. It was a total waste of calories. The lunch specials seem decently priced but the portions consist mostly of rice. I got the salmon and asparagus with black bean sauce. It was fairly tasty, but there was too little of it. Also, the fried spring roll was all cabbage -- no meat whatsoever. I don't know, but maybe their dinner portions are bigger. It's kind of a cute place though, and the waiter was nice, but I don't think it's worth it to go back there. It's back to the Carousel on Pine and Franklin for me, when I'm at work and want chinese food.", "author": "Samantha H."}

Although this may be bad for someone who has claustrophobia.  We thought it was cute.\nWe shared the meatless General Mao's and Fried Tofu with Green String Beans (has a nice touch of roasted sea salt and pepper). Tofu was nice and crispy on the outside and firm/soft inside.\nThe only thing was that there was a piece of glass boyfriend discovered in his beer. Unfortunately they didn't seem concerned, they did give him a fresh glass but not the rest of his beer, which was a bit annoying. \nNow this is a definite concern because boyfriend needs his voice to sing (a musician) but he was very pleasant about it, just shrugged it off because he's done his share of working in the same industry.

I just get the usual, gen chicken, pot stickers, stuff like that.  It may be my imagination but the food seems better after 5pm.  I often try to order chinese for delivery at work and have yet to find a place that delivers edible food. So I'll have to try bamboo.  I  go to Bamboo cuz Polk is where i got my first apt after high school and the neighborhood is still special to me.

After finding this gem of a Mandarin & Hunan restaurant here on Yelp and visiting their web site, I could hardly wait to give it a try.!  Cantonese is my first love, but I have been on a northern Chinese high and this among other places satisfies it.!  The service is very friendly and attentive and the prices reasonable.  I love the color scheme of a red ceiling and orange walls with wood trim to give it a traditional Chinese look.!  The pot stickers are crispy golden which is just the way I like them with a wonderful ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling; perfect with the vinegar on top.  The onion cakes with peanut sauce are crispy, greasless thin triangular morsels of bliss with a peanut sauce that is not too peanuty and not too thick or runny; perfect topped over the pancake as opposed to dipping.  The Red China prawns are succulent with a sweet and spicy red sauce with fresh green beans, onions, and vegetables.  The sesame chicken is crispy and greasless coated with sesame seeds in a sweet and spicy sauce that is tongue tingling and a bit sinus clearing yet not going to cause you to break out in a sweat.  The brown rice is nutty and firm, not soggy.  Round it off with a cold Tsing Tao and wonderful tea and you will not be disappointed.  So, for excellent Mandarin & Hunan cuisine at reasonable prices in a traditional atmosphere, Bamboo Restaurant cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
