Like not even just this OG, most of the ones that we've been to are slow. We been to this one, the one in Sac, and the one is Hayward; and service is like always slow for some reason!? Like I'm sure the pasta and sauce is already made so idk what be takin hella long.\n\nAnyways, last week My partner and I were able to sneak out of the house for dinner while the baby slept.  We were on a time limit because the babysitter needed to leave by 10, so we were hesitant to come here. We were helped by this nice gentleman but then passed off to Gloria who was amazing. She was fast and efficient and got us out of there in 40 min! Thank you Gloria for your wonderful service which let us enjoy dinner at one of my favorite places!", "author": "Melissa P."}

I don't visit this Olive Garden branch often but I used to live in the Sunset district and would occasionally venture out here.\n\nService:\nLet me just say that our server was a delight. She was sweet, relatively attentive, and wasn't hesitant to admit any of her flaws if she knew something was wrong. She was very knowledgeable about food and gave us pretty good recommendations. She is the reason I give two stars instead of one. Kudos to her. It was hard sometimes to get a server or food runners attention. We had no plates to eat off of for a bit. Even though our sever was great, it was hard getting her attention sometimes. \n\nFood:\nThe food quality is absolutely unsatisfying and kind of gross. We ordered the appetizer trio sampler with stuffed mushroom, mozzarella sticks, and zucchini bites. The main course of pasta with sausage. And for something that tasted so bleh, I'm surprised that our food took so long to get to us. It seemed like a rushed job the way it was presented but all of the food was cold, and the fried food was soggy. \n\nStuffed mushrooms - was the worst thing we ate. You can definitely tell (especially with this dish) that it has been frozen for a while and then popped in the microwave. The mushrooms itself tasted like soggy mush. There's a heap of water at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nMozzarella sticks - not bad. The server recommended it and it was quite pleat. Could have been heated up more to have that gooyness that comes with cheese. \n\nZucchini bites - one of the worst things we had. Soggy and such a weird taste. Nothing was crispy or even warm in the middle.   \n\nBuild your own pasta - it was so sad. Seasonless sauce, no variety, and the presentation was pretty bad. It looked like someone just threw up a bunch of pasta on a plate. \n\nOverall, really bad food quality. I hope to see some improvements soon.", "author": "Leya S."}

The server dropped off a bread basket right away. Unfortunately, the bread was way too salty, even if very soft and chewy. \n\nFor entree selections, everyone has the option of unlimited soup or bread. I always opt for the zuppa toscana soup, which is delicious. There was ample potato chunks, sausage, and kale that formed a light, creamy soup. Following that, I received my main, the seafood alfredo. The dish was very rich and creamy, especially topped off with a tad of cheese. The scallops and shrimp are on the firmer side and very tasty. All in all, a yummy dish that left me very full. \n\nMy one complaint is that the entrees took their sweet time to arrive, but this is understandable as the entire restaurant was quite full. In terms of service, our waiter didn't mince words, but was very efficient in terms of checking up on us, asking if we needed anything, and letting us know that our entrees were on the way. \n\nPaying for the bill is also made simply by their Ziosk machine, which lets you pay with credit card and print the receipt at the table itself.", "author": "Karen Y."}

We came at around 11:49am. It was my girls first time and my third I believe. We ordered the tour of Italy which consist of a chicken parmigiana, lasagna classico and their signature fettuccine alfredo for $22.99. We also created our own sampler Italiano. We decided to get 2 choices and chose the calamari and stuff mushrooms(with clams) for $11.99. \n\nThe first to arrive was the salad bowl. It was Caesar salad and it was a pretty big bowl and was more than enough to feed 2 people. We also got breadsticks. There is a bit so salt on the top but it tasted good and different than other places that served bread. Both the tour and sampler came out and the tour of Italy looked great. Our waiter also offered if we wanted cheese on our tour of Italy and of course we gladly said yes. I've ordered this before but haven't had it in years. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The lasagna was okay and the Alfredo was good but not really different than other places. The stuff mushrooms were different due to it having clams but I gotta say it was a pretty good combination. Also, the calamari was a good snack on the side. There are also dipping sauces that came with the sampler. Overall, it was a good experience. Food tasted good and filled us up and staff were great.", "author": "Mark D."}

OK whatever, she's a great girl and invited me to dinner. We arrived around 4 on a week night, it was quiet but were told we'd have to wait 20 minutes, no biggie, I wanted to have a cocktail before dinner anyway. We go to the bar and there are only two other people sitting there. We sit down, the bartender, who's showing off about his \"body art\" to the only other 2 people in the bar looks at us, doesn't say hello or acknowledge us, and proceeds to keep control talking this poor couple at the bar about his tats. Finally, I had to say rather loudly \"Excuse me, we're ready to order our drinks, please... again, no hi or hello... rather, it was \"What do you want\"... not like what would you like to drink tonight... puts our drinks in front of us, we say thank you, he doesn't say you're welcome or enjoy but walked away pissed off that he had to do his very easy at the moment job. Needless to say, he was paid in small bills and lots of change, no tip, because in the hospitality business you have to show at least a little ability to be friendly and helpful. Next, our hostess seated us. There were quite a few empty clean tables but she took us to a dirty table with used cups, crumpled napkins, dirty utensils and food smeared on the table. I said is someone going to clean this table before we sit down, or if we can have an already clean table that would work even better. She said, oh sorry, picked up every thing but left the table dirty, I had to say would someone please wipe it down too... yikes! She was perfectly nice but you could tell, not trained at all. My sister was there for advertised season items ( Black cherry coke with Makers Mark and Pumpkin Chunk cheese cake ) but the waitress (who was awesome, BTW ) was not aware of these specials but did her best to accommodate. My sister ended up with a rum and coke with a sad wilted cherry on top and a piece of black and white cheesecake. Needless to say, between the bartender's dismissive can't be bothered attitude, the hostess not having the common sense to not seat people at a table full of the last party's garbage and the heavily advertised seasonal specials not available we will not be going back, ever. The waitress was the only bright spot, hope she does not stay there long because she's better than that place, for sure! Epic fail, OG!!!", "author": "Cool B."}

While I was dining in the other night I peeked from the corner two rats playing tag under some of the tables. Nobody seemed to notice, however.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-11", "description": "My family and I were in San Francisco on Saturday to spend some time with my mom who lives there. When asked what she wanted to eat for dinner she responds with \"Olive Garden\" only I think it was a ruse because she wanted me to go to Sephora with her...lol! \n\nThe Olive Garden we chose is in the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall which is a hop and a skip around the corner from SFSU. So the fact that it was located in a mall means ample parking. We arrived at about 4:30 and didn't take too long to find parking, within decent walking distance of the front door of the restaurant. \n\nFor a party of 8, Olive Garden gave me an estimated wait time of 20 minutes, not too shabby, especially for dinner time on a Saturday. Although I think there wasn't much of a wait because everyone seemed to be next door at Marugame Udon and maybe part of it has to do with the reason I could only muster 2 stars for this review.  Marugame Udon had the line snaked in front and then even had to split it into two because of how long the line was. I of course made a mental note that will need to try it next time. It was like that when we left Olive Garden and when we finally left the mall at 8PM.\n\nSo the hostess at Olive Garden was pleasant and didn't ask how to spell my name (America), you have no idea how many people ask. Our party was then called and we were escorted to the back in what seemed to be a more private room. Come to find out it's where they stick the families with the crying babies...lol! Didn't bother us too much because we are kind of a loud speaking family so we may have had the crying babies beat by a few octaves. \n\nOur server was prompt with our bread and took our drink orders. While everyone ordered their arnold palmer's and water, I also ordered their special: Blackberry Watermelon Margarita. When it came, it tasted like Minute Maid juice slushy in a salt rimmed glass, not even a hint of alcohol. Bleh and disappointing! She brought us our drinks and then took our appetizer and dinner orders. The appetizers came (fried mozzerella and calamari) and when I asked her to take the wine glasses on the table as we would not be ordering any wine, she forgot to take them when she set our appetizers down. The table was kind of small for our party of 8 and I was trying to make good use of the room we had and remove any superfluous items i.e them wine glasses! I hadn't realize how small the portion size was for the appetizers and we only ordered 2 because it's all that tempted us. Only our waitress did not come back until she had our dinner's ready but I put in another order of calamari anyway since my mom enjoyed it. \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp and chicken carbonara's, a pasta chips nachos, 2 shrimp scampi, spaghetti, shrimp alfredo and salmon with broccoli. My husband tends to gauge all his meals against my cooking and he was NOT happy with his shrimp and chicken carbonara. He had me taste it and the chicken had a weird texture to it as if it had been previously frozen after being lightly breaded (almost the same consistency of a McDonald's chicken nugget if you take the breading off) and the shrimp was gummy. My salmon and broccoli were delicious. My son ordered the shrimp scampi and was unimpressed because the asparagus that came in the dish was raw and hard. My mother's boyfriend ordered the pasta chips nachos and he said he was a fan. The chips seemed to be a fried won ton consistency and held up against the meat mixture they topped it with. \n\nOur bill came out to be $230 and I would not have flinched at that price had we had a more attentive waitress and the quality of food was better. I know it's Olive Garden and not some world renowned Italian restaurant but come on, people work hard for their money and make contingencies to enjoy a meal away from home. This was not our first time here and my mom was just here for Mother's Day with my sister and brother and she said the service and food was the same then, but she wanted to give it another try. I don't give 2 star reviews, I really try to give establishments the benefit of the doubt because I get there are off days. I unfortunately could not take that approach this time and I think it should be duly noted that Olive Garden you are a pretty well known restaurant and there has to be some sort of second look of your quality control standards and maybe someone should watch to see how often your servers are checking in on the patrons. When I spend money and take the time to travel and decide on where I want to spend my hard earned money I want it to be at a place that takes pride in their name and food and are attentive to my needs.", "author": "AmErica A."}

It's like nachos, but w fried pasta...it it quick though, as it can get a bit soggy after a while.\n\nSome people had the shrimp scampi, a dish definitely more fitted for somebody who trying to carbo-load before a marathon than an actual meal.  I don't think they even made it through half of the noodles, so if you're hungry, this is probably a good dish for you.\n\nThe braised beef Bolognese was pretty amazing, but I think it is only a temporary special.  Lots of meat and a very generous portion.\n\nFor my meal, I had the tour of Italy. Lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and chicken parmigiana.

The night ACTUALLY started out okay though. The best part was the FIRST part which included the breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup. They were just as I remember and worth eating and ordering over and over again. Breadsticks were soft and warm, lightly brushed with melted butter on top. We ordered the zuppa toscana soup and it was creamy and spicy with kale and Italian sausage bits. I really liked the soup and would recommend others to try it if you can handle spicy. Famous house salad was good too, as expected! The pepperocinis were a nice twist. The breadsticks, unlimited salad, and soup was what drew us here, and all that was delicious! Everything else though was disappointing and the night went downhill from here. \n\nService was either MIA or fleeting.  Our table didn't even have utensils. Server didn't notice, neither did the host. We were served our salad and soup but couldn't enjoy anything until we had to flag a staff member down. Would've told our server, but she wasn't around! She barely came by to check on us, also forgot about our appetizer until we asked her about it, and that was 10 mins after when we were already finished the salad, soup, and breadsticks. So everything was really slow. I could tell she was stressed. \n\nThe appetizers and entrees lacked flavor or had TOO MUCH seasoning. We ordered a three sampler appetizer - stuffed mushrooms, fried mozzarella, and parmesan crusted zucchini. Zucchini had too much salt, didn't finish. Stuffed mushrooms were meh. Didn't finish either. Best appetizer of the three was the fried mozzarella. As for the entrees, my bf ordered a create your own -- grilled chicken, angel hair pasta, and asiago garlic alfredo sauce. I ordered a shrimp scampi. My bf's create your own pasta was dull and did not have enough sauce. His angel hair pasta was dry af. The grilled chicken was good, but he couldn't finish the pasta. My shrimp scampi was meh. Compared to my bf's, the shrimp scampi had too much sauce to the point the noodles were soggy. I was disappointed because the presentation definitely did not look like their advertised photo on the menu. There were more than 3 shrimps though! I ate it but probably should've ordered something else on the menu.\n\nIt's been years since I've eaten at Olive Garden and this recent experience delays me from wanting to come back. Both food and service needs improvement. \n\nALSO... they should remove the self-order game machine. It's deceiving and charges $1.99 for just touching the thing.

You probably won't go wrong but you won't be blown away either.\n\nThe last time we went here was this past Saturday night. My little love turned 6 that day, and her special birthday request was a trip to the zoo and then dinner at the Olive Garden. Awww, so cute.

All in all, it was pretty decent as it usually is this past Saturday night.\n\nBut beware - the later into the dinner hour you head over, the longer the wait. The wait can be anywhere from 15 minutes if you're super lucky to over an hour if you're super unlucky. Heads up, they don't take reservations and that's why the wait is so long.

I truly recommend this place for nice date with your honey. \nNormally my fiance and I go for soup, salad and bread sticks. I think it is pricey. But having 4 different soups to choose makes it nice. And I like my salad with extra black olive. They were more than willing to accommodate me. \nNow my fiance was wanting to try one of their fruity drinks. Moscato Citrus Berry Cocktail. It was quite tasty. Only bad thing I had empty some the ice to get to the blue berries. And she absolutely loves them. Something about anti-oxidants but then I went blank. LOL. \nDavid was our server. Truly this guy went above and beyond. As I made the mistake of ordering the wrong soup, I did not have look like that customer searching the Serengeti for waiter. He had 4 tables but still kept an eye on us. Like a stalker but one you want. LOL.\nOver all we truly had an enjoyable time. I did not get any pics. Sorry about that but I say come check it out.

Brendan,the bartender, saw us approaching the bar, but did not acknowledge us at all--he was too involved in his conversation with a customer about tattoo artistry!!! We sat on the right end of the bar and he was in the middle of the bar carrying on his conversation FULLY aware of our presence. We quietly and very patiently waited and he took his sweet time with his conversation and completely ignored us. So at 5:23 pm after 5 minutes, my sister very politely asked him if he could serve us. He was bothered because we interrupted his conversation and asked us what we wanted in an unfriendly fashion. My sister told him we wanted wine and I proceeded to show him my buzzer so that we would get the discount on our wine--he was annoyed and kind of snapped -oh I see that. I wanted to get a manager- I was so angry and upset, but my sister wanted no drama and advised me to contact corporate directly. It was a very, very disheartening experience--it was and is his job to be friendly and to provide us decent service in a timely manner and not be discussing tattooing techniques with a random patron. Otherwise the service we had at dinner was excellent. Our server Anna was super friendly and sweet. She went above and beyond the call of duty in her service to us. She was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I went to redeem my birthday dessert coupon and she brought out a piece of black tie cheesecake with a candle and 2 other servers and they all proceeded to sing Happy Birthday to me. It really made me smile. I hope this review is helpful", "author": "alexandria s."}

Not the usually creamy texture that an Alfredo is supposed to be. Had sent it back and asked for a different pasta.\n\nChanged my order to the Shrimp and Chicken carbonara. The sauce was much better and not too salty. Although I had to wait a while for the order to come after asking a female shift manager the status of my order , the shift manager - Carlos brought out my order. He apologized for the long wait and mistake with my first orders and it's remake. \n\nThe chicken and gnocchi soup wasn't like it used to be. The soup seemed to be broken and a tad on the salted side. The breadsticks were salted a little more then usual. Had to wipe the excess salt off with the napkin before eating it  \n\nAppetizer: stuffed mushrooms. \nIt seemed as though it wasn't cooked all the way. The top where it was stuffed but towards the cap it seems a little cold. \n\nBreadsticks:\nI love the breadsticks and would usually ask for 2-3 baskets and some to go home. However, we barely got through the first basket, leaving only 3 left due to the salt on top. I had to wipe it off before eating it. \n\nThe tablet devices on the table should make this a little easier by ordering and calling the server but the call server button doesn't seem to be as efficient as it should. It just flashes and the patrons would have to turn the flashing red light off. \n\nMost of us order refillable drinks, not once did the waitress come and offered a refill. \n\nThe shift manager - Carlos was very friendly and helped take care of our table and he even went after us after we left the restaurant to once again apologize for the service and food and gave us a $15 gift card to come back. \n\nNot sure if I will come back in the near future since it seems like their food quality has become salty.

I'm sure we all know that whether we hear the name, see it across the street or dine in. Walking through their door and sitting down for a meal, please don't expect chef Mario Batali in the back making fresh pasta from scratch or expecting sauces and soups simmering for hours. \n\nThis is the place when I want a hearty meal! The price can't be beat with all of their deals that seem to be constantly going on, in addition to their unlimited soups (zuppa toscana!!!), salad (I actually really love their salad, despite having excessive dressing on my last visit here), and the famous breadsticks (buttery, garlicky goodness!). The dish that I always get is the five cheese ziti al forno (which is the dish that my bff introduced to me back when I was literally 15 years old and still to this day, is the same dish that I always get! Don't forget to mix the dish so that all of the cheese can be incorporated!). What I usually do is get full off of the soup, salad and breadsticks, and take the majority of my entree home =)\n\nService is always friendly, but.... unfortunately, always slow.

When I came back from using the restroom (like 5 mins), my family was already seated at a table.\n\n-They now have touch screens on each table, so it makes ordering from the menu or paying for the tab easier and more efficient. \n\n-Since the entrees come with unlimited breadsticks or unlimited salad, I expected our server to serve us slower. But, he was actually really speedy and didn't seem so judgmental on the fact that we were asking for refills! \n\nI really enjoyed eating at Olive Garden, surprisingly. My family and I came around early 6PM so the setting was really calm and quiet. When it gets later, I know that the restaurant gets packed and noisy.

She asked how many and told us it would take 15-20 minutes, no problem, my friend and I got a drink from the mall and came back. When we returned there was some people still waiting in their area and we were called to our table, walking through the restaurant was so confusing--there were empty tables everywhere! Why was there a wait? At first I assumed it was because they were short staffed but near the bar and the front desk area, employees stood around and talked so I doubt that was the issue.\n\nWhen we were brought to our table it honestly was family sized--giant table for two people--it was confusing and awkward to sit across from a really big table. We asked to be moved to a more intimate table (there were many that were empty) they told us no...ok...fine... Our waiter came and immediately asked us if we were ready to order, before he even asked us if we wanted drinks. Friend ordered pasta with soup and I had their unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks deal. My first bowl of soup came cold, his was luke warm. I returned my bowl and the waiter apologized. The bowls after were fine but the soups were more bland than I remember. My friend's pasta was cold, the cheese on top was melted but hard and when he cut it with his fork, the whole thing of cheese that was \"melted\" on slid off. His ravioli was cold in the middle. For a restaurant that has premade food, you'd think they would at least know how to heat it properly? \n\nOur waiter was honestly a nice guy so I can't say too much. By far not the best service I've received but he himself wasn't bad at all--I think he was just overwhelmed ? Felt like it was his first day on the job and frankly I care more about the food anyways.

When the server pour the wine, I thought my husband ordered a bottle because she only pour half a glass. When we question our server about it, she said it's a standard 6 oz pour and that's what she learned at training. She's obviously new. So she doubled checked with her manager and came back to say she's not wrong. We order wine all the time and we know it wasn't 6oz. We were with our family and didn't want to make a big fuss about it but we used my baby's milk bottle to measure the amount of wine after. It was merely 4 oz. Anyone who worked at a restaurant business would know, if your customer is questioning your pour, no matter what it is, you pour a little more. \n\n\nOh, the hostess at the front also rolled her eyes and look like she didn't want to be there when we checked in. \n\nSadly we will not be back at other Olive Garden any time soon.

It's cool tech and all, but I think I'd rather go old fashion and interact with a waiter.  Maybe down the road if I come back to visit I'll give it a try.\n\nService was really good!

So upon deciding where, we ended up at the OLIVE GARDEN. \n\nIt was pretty packed when we got there. Was told it would be a 20 minute wait. The girls were anxious to get this party started, so we went straight to the bar and had shots of Patron. Ouch....I know. But we had a DD.\nWithin ten minutes our buzzer went off, and our Table was ready. Whew! \n\nOnce seated, our waiter introduced himself as Anthony, we all ordered a Frozen Margarita.  Looking over the menu, there was so much to choose from.  I settled for the salad (instead)  of the all-you-can-eat soup, with of course, the signature garlic, warm bread sticks, that are so freaking addicting!  Couple of the gals opted for the soup and said it was wonderful. For my main, it was a no brainier, I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara with a creamy Alfredo sauce. It was DELICIOUS!!\nThe gals all ordered different dishes & were pleased. We also had Chardonnay with dinner.\nFor dessert, we all forced ourselves to have the Tiramisu.  No words. Yum!\n\nOur waiter, Anthony, was truly polite and friendly. Not just specifically our waiter, but looking around, I noticed all the waiters and/or waitresses we're polite and engaging with the customers in a happy fashion. It was a nice vibe.\n\nNo complaints from me for this Olive Garden. The whole experience was great, and it definitely took me back to the day when I took my Mom there to eat. I use to eat at the OG way more often then. \n\nFood and service was spot on. And that's pretty much, all that matters anyway. \n.", "author": "Janet T."}

I am happy I was talked out of appetizers as they just aren't needed with the normal extras. We got the chicky chicky parm parm (chicken parmigiana) which was pretty nice but a bit squishy, fettuccini alfredo which I was expecting to be too oily/creamy but it too was pretty nice. We also got the \"take home\" spaghetti with meat sauce, love that part of the meal is a take home meal, it fed the daughter and me for dinner so worked out well!\n\nService was good, never had to strain the neck looking for our server. Price was about $50 all up for 2 of us (and a toddler who just ate breadsticks), definitely didn't go home hungry and had our take home spaghetti (plus some extra soup) for later. Still pricey for fairly standard meals but have to experience Olive Garden occasionally.\n\nA few other things I have learnt:\n- Always say \"yes\" to complimentary wine tastings even though you know you aren't going to order the chianti\n- The Killers hit \"Mr Brightside\" was covered by Paul Anka in a swing/Sinatra style\n- The bathrooms in Olive Garden play covers of The Killers hit \"Mr Brightside\"", "author": "Tristan L."}

We noticed that some of the menu items were only available during the week, not on a Sunday. \n\nThe table was not clean; had plates and bowls still there. Floors were dirty; food bits and a fork behind my chair. Table was sticky and so was the little gaming console. It was a table for two, which meant that there were only two chairs there. We had to rearrange the condiments and drinks to all four corners of table for the food to fit in the center. We also had to move the gaming center to the floor. I saw unseated booths. \n\nOrdered the green apple Moscato sangria. That was delicious. We got the unlimited salad and breadsticks, Artichoke dip to start with. Entr\u00e9es were stuffed chicken marsala, spaghetti, chicken piccata with minestrone soup. Everything tasted okay, we were starving. No complaints. Our server was friendly so we gave her a big tip. \n\nAs we were leaving, a male server, walked past us in the hallway and said he needed to go on a break because he needed to use the bathroom.

Yes, it is a chain, but one of the better ones.  We only had a 15 minute wait & the hostas & our servers, Alexis & Jessica were wonderful, very attentive & not leaving anything to chance.  I love the warm bread sticks; very soft & the parmasan & butter baked in yum.  The salad is pretty good; I generally will not eat iceberg lettuce, but this is pretty good with pepperincinis, olives, tomatos, crutons, & parmasan in a wonderful dressing.  The chicken giardino is wonderful, only 500 calories, but full of flavor with aldentae pasta, tender chicken, brocolli, & peas in a lemon sauce.  For dessert, you have to get their terimisu which is lite, smooth, & creamy with marscapone, a little espresso, & moist lady fingers.  Next time, I hope to try the Italian donuts & apple crestata.  Round it off with a cold Peroni & you will not be disappointed.  Everyone in their party loved their food.  Since my mother was able to get the Buy one get one free deal, she took me home the five cheese zeti with wonderful aldentae tubes of pasta, parmasan, racata, & other cheeses in a lite marinara sauce; it definitely went well with some frozen meat balls..

Now I know better than to go near this place at dinner time or when SFSU students are moving in but sometimes I really question this business. Their food isn't really Italian but honestly I'm lazy and the best part of their food is always the breadsticks. So I place an online order to pick up after work and it's like $35 cause your girl likes to eat. I walk in to pick it up and of course it isn't ready yet but the bar staff is always hella nice. So I'm waiting and didn't you know that this woman walks up to me with my order and says directly to my face \"so we're actually out of breadsticks today, you're total is $35\" and keep in mind half of my order is breadsticks I literally order a shitty entree so I get 6 for free and order an extra half dozen to warm up and take to work the next day. So I literally start laughing and tell her she has to take off the breadsticks from my order and the extra sauce I added to my meal and she says \"idk if I can do that but I'll ask\" um bitch you better, what the hell am I gonna do with a \"boat of alfredo\" like its literally butter I will not put that on perfectly good pasta I would have to make myself at home. So they end up taking off the breadsticks but because I've already touched the alfredo I have to keep it. So great, now I'm stuck with just the shitty food and not the good part. Put a sign outside if you're completely sold out so people know not to come in damn. But I went there again like 2 days ago and the staff was wonderful as usual and the food was way better but these idiots gave me a boat of ranch dressing instead of alfredo.

Olive Garden is more of a walk-in restaurant so no reservations. They have a nice seating area for maybe about 10 people to sit.\n\nService: When we got seated, our waiter was very friendly. He has the voice of an announcer which was pretty cool. He came by asking if we wanted to start off with drinks or appetizers (standard procedure at any restaurant) and he came back to check in if we were ready to order. During our meals, he would check in if we needed anything else and if we were satisfied with our food. Overall: service was great.\n\nFood: Breadsticks were good. I honestly don't see what the rave is about. I eat a lot of bread and this just wasn't to die for IMO. Probably because I had high expectations and it just didn't meet it. The salad was standard. Didn't expect much but they did give a big bowl of it.\n\nI got the Strawberry-Passion Fruit Limonata $3.50 and I really liked it. It might be a little too sweet for others but I think it was just perfect for me. It was a nice blend of strawberry and limonade.\n\nWe ordered an Italiano Sampler $12.99 for 3 choices. We got Calamari, Fried Mozzarella, and Toasted beef and pork ravioli. When we got our appetizer, it was not what we ordered. When I told our waiter, he went to check and brought out what we actually ordered. He asked if we wanted to keep or not. I bargained that if it was free, we'll keep it and he said sure! Awesome free apps! I loved the calamari and the ravioli. Really nice frying.\n\nFor my main entree, I got the Tour of Italy $17.99 which comes with Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna Classico and our signature Fettuccine Alfredo. This dish was great because I got to try a couple of items rather than just one. The Alfredo was good. The fettuccine was still a little hard but the alfredo was tasty. The Chicken parm was delicious. And the lasagna.. was not lasagna. I don't eat Italian often but I thought lasagna was not in shapes of dumplings... I think I got trolled and noticed just now as I write my review LOL. Was too hungry to care. If I come back, I would probably just stick to the Chicken parm since it was my favorite of this dish.\n\nOverall I had a nice experience. Got trolled twice in one visit but I won't ding any stars.

Perhaps because it's conveniently located on the outside of the stylish Stonestown Galleria where you can dine and shop at the same time! What's not to love? \n\nThe real reason my family and I always go is because of the \"Buy One Take One\" Deal that always seems to come around every four months or so. I can honestly tell you the deal is so worth it. In fact, it really is the only reason to go to \"The OG\" as I call it. Look the place isn't perfect, It's large, loud, service is decent if somewhat lacking because they're always so busy, and the food is well at its Olive Garden best.\n\nI only go to the OG when there is a \"Buy One Take One\" deal because not only is it a ton of food to eat while you are there, but you get to take a full dish home. You start with the all you can eat soup and salad with a side of breadsticks. Then you pick between four pasta dishes or three meat and/or shrimp dishes for an additional sum.\n\nBut since this meal deal also comes with the all you can eat soup and salad, you know what I plan on feasting on while I'm actually dining at the OG. First off my top priority is to enjoy all the soup and salad and breadsticks you can, and have a few bites of your pasta that your dinner plan actually consists of, and then get a to go box to take that one home on top of the one you order to take home. That's what I did and I'm not ashamed! \n\nI start off with the Zuppa Toscana soup which is a wonderful creamy hearty soup with plenty of sausage, kale and potatoes. And then I move onto the Minestrone which is decent if not remarkable, and then I finish with the Chicken & Gnocchi soup which is so hearty I don't have any room for anything else. It helps that my fellow diners get salad because they don't like soup, so I happily sponged off a few bites of their all-you-can eat salad. Clearly I have no shame!\n\nI found the pastas the OG is offering BOGO taste decent, but not great. Sauce was lacking on my Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo, and the newest pastas they offer with this meal deal, the Penne with Basil Garlic Marinara tasted rather unremarkable. I also remembered to sign up for the Olive Garden Eclub, in which you get emailed a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. (Which our server had to ask his manager if it was allowed with the Buy One Take One Meal Deal, thankfully it was!) So we started with the trio sample appetizer with fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and toasted ravioli. They were okay, but nothing I would order on their own. \n\nAt the end of our meal despite being stuffed, we decided to try a dessert. We agreed on the Zeppoli, which are the Italian doughnuts. To my amazement, the doughnuts tasted delicious. They were light and sugary and perfect when paired with the chocolate dipping sauce. It was the perfect end to an overstuffed meal.\n\nOlive Garden is not like eating in Rome or even San Francisco's North Beach, and it's no were near the quality or overall deal that Maggiano's has to offer. But it's a decent place with affordable prices that does tend to get really crowded on weekends for dinner. But that's what still makes the place so amazing: the fact that people still enjoy this place after so many years. I know I do.", "author": "Jason F."}

We finally got our order and when we got home, the pasta was so dry because they didn't give much sauce. We ate what pasta we can that had sauce but not much of it because there was so little sauce in the entree. We were so disappointed.\n\nI called OG and I spoke to Gary, who was the manager on duty, who was super kind. He was very understanding as I voiced my frustration. As a result he sent me a OG gift card and offered to deliver another set of meal to us. I think he said he would deliver it personally or something like that.

They hearken to a cheap smokey diner off the Vegas strip that contrasts with the 'classier' decor branding of Olive Garden franchise locations. The soft glow ever so persistently demanding attention from conversation every few minutes when the ad flickers - we just flipped the thing backwards and butted it up against the wall. This culminates in the ever so awkward pay-your-bill moment while the server uncomfortable shifts their weight from foot to foot lingering behind to show patrons how paying with it works, while the patron uncomfortable slides the tip scale up and down. I'd recommend either removing the terminals completely, or having them default to a black-screen when not interacted with. \n\nThe food is another opportunity for improvement at this location. It tasted fine, but the visual presentation needs immediate attention. What was served at the table looked nothing like the menu or OliveGarden website photos we reviewed before placing orders. This is something I've not noticed before at other franchise locations, albeit its been some years since I've visited an OliveGarden. I suspect it's most likely this particular location in need of some retooling but who knows. If instead lies with supply available to the kitchen the speaks to a bigger problem. Regardless, may be a good exercise to occasionally compare orders coming out to photos presented to customers as a quality control check. If it's an unattainable standard, perhaps the photos should be replaced with ones that better resembles what comes out.", "author": "David G."}

I guess because every time I'm ready to give up, I randomly get good service. Which leads to my main issue: the service is constantly terrible and disappointing. I'm only going to focus on my visit tonight because no need to bring up the past. Anyway, we're sitting there for 25 minutes with just our glasses of water (which I've learned that you don't want to rush and drink because you'll never see a refill), no bread, no sign of the waitress. She finally comes back to the table after I ask another waitress to get her. I ask her about an item on the menu, she says \"you can read the description in the menu\" I kindly inform her that it's actually not a description in the menu but more of a statement about it being a classic dish. Then she actually answered the question that I asked. Later on I feel like our request were pretty standard: refills, more cheese, etc. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but every time we asked for something there was huffing and puffing and neck and eye rolling. Eventually, I asked her if we were asking her for too much because it seemed like we were. She said no she's fine and she apologized. All of a sudden we have a new server who says that the first one \"got really busy\"... The restaurant is half empty but sure. This new lady was unprepared and seemed like she actually was busy considering the amount of things she was carrying in her hand... Anyways, I say they need to do a much better job either with prescreening or with training their servers.", "author": "Kenia J."}

Understandable because it's lunch hour. Where we sat. On my side. The seat was in bad shape. Saw a doodle from a child on the wall. I can understand why. A long wait to place an order. I thought their side dishes was a one person meal. Nope. Way too much amount. Too much that it's better to eat with a family or party of 4 or more than couple. Food was some good. Nice waiter too.

Then we should came back we started to order only to be told that they were out of everything we wanted to order. 6 out of 6. Then we tried to order something else to be told they were out of that as well. They were out of all steak and beef. The waitress told us that they always run out on Sundays. She should have us right off the bat that they did not have certain items! Or maybe they should say something before making us wait 50 minutes!

The seats are comfortable. The staff is very friendly. You can reserve a dining room if you plan to eat with a big group. The food is alright. \nYes, there is usually a ridiculously long line that makes me question some people's priorities. But then I remember why there's a wait. A lot of people shop at Stonestown with their friends and families. All of whom roll up in their extra large vans, minivans, SUVs, tour busses, what have you, and they all seem to want to eat in a sit-down restaurant with waiter service, because the food court just won't cut it. A lot of the younger crowd from several neighboring schools have appetites and time to spare. Then there are the out-of-towners who don't have an Olive Garden in their local neighborhood. I'm assuming most of them arrived just after watching a hunger-inducing Olive Garden commercial.\n \nSo you see, there's no reason to get mad at Olive Garden for having a long wait time. Well, sometimes I do notice that they quote an insane 45min -1hr estimate when there are empty tables. I don't know what's up with that. Poor communication? *Shrugs* I don't know.\n\nThe menu offers the usual Italian dishes - pastas & pizzas, and other typical mainstream dishes that chain restaurants offer. What do you expect? Chain restaurants cater to the masses and stick to the familiar, comfort dishes that most people have heard of. It's not meant to be innovative and exciting.\n\nOk, to be honest, the only things I like here are the breadsticks and the zuppa toscana soup. \n\nBreadsticks come warm and wrapped in a napkin. They're buttery soft and salty. Don't take breadsticks home. They always harden up like a rock. It's never fun trying to revive hard bread.\n\nZuppa Toscana Soup is spicy and creamy, with pieces of kale that give it a good texture, minced spicy Italian sausage, and potatoes that soak up the broth. Yum. Can I just order this to go?\n\nIf you've never had Italian food before (and I'm pretty sure most people have), then try the...\nTour of Italy - includes Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, Fettucine Alfredo. \na taste of all 3 for under $20. All of them are okay.\n\nBut you have had Italian food before? Then skip it. Most of the dishes are typically around the same caliber. Just get the zuppa toscana soup and enjoy your seat with wheels and the villa-esque ambience as you gaze out the window into a view of the parking lot.\n\nI've been here once or twice during the off-peak times and it was quite alright. I don't think it's worth anyone's time to clutch a cumbersome square beeper and wait around an hour for the food here though. Every so often, they bring back the Never Ending Pasta promotion, which is only a good deal if you can eat more than two bowls of pasta.", "author": "Joy W."}

The Hostess was being Extremely unreasonable. She told we have to wait an extra 15 minutes even though there were a numbers of open tables. She continue to be unreasonable due to the fact we requested a table for four by the window. In that very same section of the restaurant there were people seated and was eating their food in that section of the restaurant. We ended up taking the table way close to the front door.

Constantly,  every 2-3 minutes,  you see one of the receptionists, including the manager himself,  standing over our table and announcing into their microphone \" 703 is turning\" \"702 is moving\" ... how annoying!

I asked for hot water,  the answer was \" I'm waiting for the kitchen\". It took me 15 minutes to get my hot water with a reminder to him.  But the table next to me also asked for hot water and they got a carafe of hot water in 1 minute!  When it finally came,  the water is lukewarm and served in a coffee stained cup! My soup was served cold with almost just clear broth.  I have to ask and wait for the cheese on top.  When we were done,  we were given container to doggie box our food while you looked around,  all the other table,  other waitresses boxing the food for the customers.

My family and I went here on Thursday night for dinner. Our waitress was delightful and very sweet. We asked a lot of questions and asked her for a lot of refills for the sides (breadstick, soup, salad), and she didn't mind at all. She deserved a great tip! \n\nI thought the food was delicious and too filling. For appetizer we got a sampler, two items which consist of calamari style rings and toasted beef and pork ravioli. The calmari rings were small pieces but good! The ravioli is square shaped and I tasted more of the beef than the pork. \nWe ordered two entrees: sausage stuffed giant rigatoni and baked tilapia with shrimp\n- sausage stuffed giant rigatoni: it's a lot of food. Some pasta wasn't really cooked cause it's hard in some areas, that's ok cause it wasn't that noticable. There's a lot of sausage pieces, my favorite! The sauce is amazeballs and so cheesy! I thought this entree was rich and very delicious.\n- baked tilapia with shrimp: shrimp was tasty, yet small. The tilapia was something I could've made easily and also small. This plate did not please me. I feel like their seafood entrees aren't as great either. There's way too much broccoli too, but the portion size for the broccoli and fish was even.\nFor dessert we got chocolate mousse cake. WOW I LOVED IT!

I love dipping the breadsticks into the soup.... mmm. I finished that bowl off and then we ordered a bowl of zuppa toscana, which was really good as well. You can really taste the sausage and I love the kale in it! FYI you can always mix and match your soup if you finish your first bowl and want another kind for the next bowl. I didn't even know you could do that until my last visit here.\n\nFor our entree, we ordered the smoked mozzarella chicken and were both pleasantly surprised!!! I didn't expect the chicken to be so well cooked (honestly, I kinda expect dry/overcooked chicken anywhere hahaha), and the sauce was really flavorful. The \"take home\" entree you get is actually cold when they give it to you at the end of your meal, and they give you reheating instructions too.\n\nThe main standout thing about today's experience was definitely the service!! Our waiter was a young man named Anthony and his customer service was amazing. I was seriously so surprised at this because last time I was here, our waitress was a girl that was not in a very good mood... And was often no where to be found.

For the chicken parm I barely ate any of it because it was so dry and the fried part just made me nauseous. Just overall this dish was bad. It wasn't even because it tasted bad but because it was cold and some of the food wasn't cooked all the way. The bread was okay I imagined it being way better like maybe cheese cake factory level at least. What I liked the most was the salad which funny thing is came free with the meal. In the end me and my friend ordered one of the cheesecakes. I was excited because I have been craving cheese cake but this cheese cake was so frozen it almost broke the fork I was eating with. I gave up trying to eat it half way because it wasn't worth the hassle. \n\nFor drinks: me and my friend ordered the Italian margarita and we had high expectations since it was the most expensive one and it said Italian...but yet again we were disappointed. My friend even said I honestly just felt full and didn't feel that margarita after drinking it. \n\nFor the service: our first server seemed a bit unprofessional because the way he talked was so abrupt. He didn't really offer us bread which surprised me at first so I had to request it. We didn't even know that they changed our server until after they changed to a new guy. They actually didn't even say anything at all. The new server was at least nicer and more attentive that's why I give it two stars but besides that I don't think I'll ever come here again because my food turned out to be $30+ which I don't think is worth it for a dry, cold, uncooked plate of food.", "author": "Leslie F."}

Sometimes the service is amazing; attentive and pleasant. But when you're placed into that little hidden room they sometimes open (the one that's usually bare w/windows facing Sports Authority), you are often overlooked. \n\nThe 2 times I've dined in the section of the restaurant were terrible. Service was sub par, we were extremely overlooked (you would have to hound people to get their attention), and the food was more than disappointing. Now I've been guilty of dining here countless times b/c of convenience and I love their peach teas, but this experience was so especially bad, I felt I had to leave a review.\n\nBesides the uneccesary slow service, our food that came out was horrendous. I ordered chicken alfredo and bf ordered spaghetti w/some kind of tomato sauce and meatballs. Mind you, we also ordered an appetizer of calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and fried ravioli that came out literally 5 min before our entrees. After the fact we had waited forever and had finished our bread sticks and had 2 refills of zuppa toscana. \n\nAs you'll see in my pictures, my chicken was clearly burnt and when chicken is cooked to ashes, it becomes dry and inedible. The meatballs were unappealingly gray. To serve those dishes out...my goodness..yes it's a chain, but jeez, have some standards and respect for your food! \n\nThis experience was truly disappointing. Look at your food carefully as well, there were numerous times where OG had to comp my meals and my roommates' meals b/c their dishes included hairy situations..", "author": "Emily M."}

Today, a friend of mine had this coupon for $5.99 unlimited salad, soup, and breadstick meal. I didn't really care for it even at a nice prince. In the past when they would advertise unlimited soup or salad, the wait in between to get the next batch can be hour. I which case, \"unlimited soup\" can just be two bowls, because you get tired of waiting for the next bowl to arrive. Takes the waiter forever to come to your table so you can ask them for the next bowl, and it'll take them forever to come out with the next bowl. You think all it would take is for them to just go in the kitchen, ladle in another bowl and take it right back out. Yet if feels like there's going out to buy stock and bring it back to start cooking that one bowl of soup from scratch. \n\nToday was worse. We had coupons. When we got there, we asked the seater name caller ID we can use these coupons for the few of us. She said \"sure, just let the waiter know am they'll deduct the discount off your total\". When our name was called, there was a different person that lead us to our seat. Once we seated, we asked her \"we have a few of these $5.99 coupons, can we use them for the each of us? This other person also say \"yes, just let the waiter know and they'll adjust your total for the coupon.\" Then the waiter comes and hands us a menu. Asked us what we liked to drink and we just said ice water all around. Came back with water and left. Few minutes later, comes back and ready to talk our order. We talk him we have a few of these coupons for the each of us, can we use them. Immediately he says \"that deal is over, it's regular price now. We asked, are you sure? Because the coupon has today's date as the last day of expiration. The waiter takes a look at the coupon and says only one per table. We asked, \"are you sure? The coupon reads just one per person.\" He takes another look at the coupons and changes his response. Then says \"it's one coupon per email. So your first order would be the discount and the others would be full price.\" I take a look at the coupon and no where does it print any email or barcodes or serial numbers. I asked again, are you sure? And he starts taking about some kind of email program. Then I tell him we need a few more minutes. \n\nHe left, and I tell my friends \"classics bait and switch. No wonder there's hardly any customers in here\". Let's leave. \n\nWhile we were leaving, another waitress saw us and asked what's wrong. We explained the coupon and how it made us decide to eat at Olive garden. But the waiter said no to us. She said \"let me ask the manager if it's okay to give you that deal. We told her, that's absolutely okay. The only reason we decided to come here was because of the coupon. If we weren't honored it from the beginning, than that means either it's a Bait and Switch, of the customer is always wrong. \n\nAnd so we left and ate elsewhere. \n\nI would have rated this a negative star if possible. Wasted our time going there and going to another restaurant. Never again. \n\nTrust me, there must be a reason that this Olive Garden has gone from a large location to a smaller one. Give it time and it'll close down.", "author": "Jack L."}

We basically ordered lunch-dinner during brunch. We also got to sample a lot of wine though my brother picked out one of the white ones. \n\nPretty accommodating, as a party of 7 we were seated at a large table in the middle of the place but it was tucked away like it was a private little party. Isolating but okay. Staff was patient with us and were pretty good about making sure we were okay throughout our stay. \n\nWe all shared stuffed mushrooms and calamari as appetizers. Calamari is a safe choice for appetizers since it's pretty juicy and consistently good. I usually douse it in lemon. The mushrooms are generally inconsistently made but okay this time around. Tasted better when I ate it with the sauce provided for the calamari. \n\nI ordered one of the newer dishes, the Salmon Bruschetta at $20.99. Pretty good, salmon wasn't dry. The risotto...lol the cheese was in a chunk in the middle under the plate and I needed to mix it with everything for it to be juicy and evenly distributed. I'm not sure if they did it like that on purpose or not. I was full by the time I ate half my dish.\n\nShared a Seasonal Berry cake with my sister. The wait time to get it took maybe like 10 minutes and I assume it's because they needed to wait for it to thaw in time. It was still partially frozen when we got it and I'm not convinced that the berries on top of it are all berries. \n\nOlive Garden is Olive Garden.", "author": "Sofia R."}

Now it's sort of the opposite.\n\nI walked in here for lunch with my cousin and mom. The hostess that was working the table looked bored and didn't even offer me a smile or a \"hi, welcome to Olive Garden!\" Nope. She looked at me like she was going to fall asleep in a second. Okay, fine. Wait service will probably be better, right?\n\nService was bleh at best. Sure, the waiter was nice, but he wasn't really that attentive. Was it 'cause he was shy? Nope, can't be because we saw him conversing with a table across from us a lot. Even when he was packaging our leftovers, he would walk over to the other peoples' table and talk. Uh, okay. And when it came time to give us the check, he didn't even give it to us personally and thank us for being there. Someone else had to deliver it. \n\nFood was mediocre. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it came out in a dark brown color meaning it was deep fried too long. You couldn't even tell the calamari pieces from the pepper pieces. And what's worse? Dipping it in sauce didn't even help. We ended up taking 95% of it home and it was like eating crunchy potato chips. Ugh.\nMy mom's chicken alfredo lacked a lot of sauce and the chicken was dry. My cousin seemed to enjoy her dish, but then dessert came and it all went downhill again. We got 2 of the dolcinis - arametto tiramisu and limoncello.

We then chatted with another family who were waiting in the crowded waiting area.\n\nWe then were escorted to our table by our server. She took our appetizer and drinks orders pleasantly enough. We trusted that she wrote everything down correctly. Calamari/fried mozzarella sticks combo to share; minestrone soup for Hubby, who ordered an entree.\n\nFifteen minutes later, drinks came.  The appetizer combination was wrong: mushroom came instead of the mozzarella sticks. Server takes back appetizer. Minestrone did not appear.

The endless salad was drenched in dressing and I picked out all of the blatantly rotten tomatoes. I got the \"tour of Italy\"-three pastas for $12.99. The pastas were sitting in what looked like tomato runoff water but the tops were hard from the heat lamps they had probably been under for the entire 45 minutes we waited for our food. \n\nThe service was pretty bad. Honestly it does not take 45 minutes to open a can of tomato sauce and cook pasta, which is what we got. Our waitress was nice and looked busy but most of the waitstaff was standing around behind the bar and doing nothing. Literally nothing. A staff member was talking very loudly next to our table about how she wanted to take a cigarette break and did not care whether she got in trouble. \n\nIt's dirty, put nicely. Granted, we were there around 8 pm (maybe it is better in the morning) but the floors and the whole place really smells like it has been wiped by the same dirty mop for the last decade. I walked out feeling dirty from having eaten there. \n\nWe came here for cheap Italian food. However this place is not cheaper than most of the much nicer Italian restaurants in the city.

And why did they feel the need to add breaded chicken pieces in this dish? It's not like it wasn't rich enough. Grilled slices of chicken would've somewhat redeemed the dish, at least to make up for the separated sauce.\n\nThe marinara on my little boy's pasta was the standout, chunky with a rich, deep tomato flavor. The accompanying dinner salad was also alright.\n\nService? Well, all I can say is it's the \"B\" team with haphazard timing (could be the kitchen), switching servers mid-stream who promised diners one table behind us they'd \"get out of their hair\" now that they'd ordered/had their food delivered/another round of water poured.\n\n(I don't know about you but eating and hearing \"get out of your hair\" made my stomach turn after the fourth time I'd heard it). \n\nOur server tried and he did accommodate the comped children's meal that I'd earned after giving up my email address to Darden Corporation (that owns Olive Garden) though I couldn't find the discount code. \n\nI tipped generously because I felt the badly timed service (drink took 20 minutes to make, arrived with the main and my entree arrived two minutes after my salad which he tried to immediately whisk away, huh?) was the fault of the bartender and kitchen.\n\nThe server was harried but nice enough, he did try and after all, it's Christmas. \n\nWould I go back?

We went in with our small service dog which was a miniature poodle and told them that he is a service dog.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive. While we were starting to eat, a middle age man who was most likely the manager came to our table with his long, sour face and said to me in a very cold tone that if he ever heard the dog bark then he would kick us out the restaurant in a superior tone ! He was standing there for minutes and repeated again and again about his statement until I said to him \"Sir, you don't need to repeat this as we were not deaf people\". He left after scoffing at us. This really spoiled our mood to enjoy the meal as the price for the food was quite expensive to us!!! We decided to leave at half way of eating since we were feeling really bad. This guy may be a manager but he was so rude and had absolutely no manners and was low class. I am afraid that my spiritual service dog would bark at him since this guy had very negative energy !!! The waitress was very nice and polite young girl with good manners. She even apologized for this happening to us and said that she has a dog and she loves and understands dog feelings. Our service dog is very sweet and special! We felt this guy should be removed from his position because he has zero warming feelings towards to customers! We believe that he really damages this business and sets a bad name and impression for this restaurant!

My family loved going to Olive Garden because it was affordable to have a good quality Italian meal with fast friendly customer service. Since we live about 30 minutes from this location (which is the closest to us), we usually pick up and take out our dinner when coming through on 19th from the airport. But the last few times we would get home and open everything up to eat and have one of those \"we spent $50 for this?\" moments. Everything was eatable, but the quality and value is not there like it used to be. On top of that, we received an emailed survey about our experience and let them know our thoughts. We were connected via email by the manager the next day, but told we should call him to discuss the issues even though we gave plenty of details via email. What more is there to say and who has time to do that? It's much easier for me to go elsewhere. You'd think they would try a bit harder to make loyal customers remain as such.

I had dined at this location several times throughout the years and never really had many complaints about my experiences. Well, Saturday night was different story. We were seated 15-20 minutes after arriving; which wasn't too bad but we seemed to be virtually invisible as we sat at our table waiting for service. A kind server; who wasn't our server was very polite in checking on us and was very surprised our server hadn't approached us even though 10 minutes had gone by. So he brought us a sample of their wine for that night as well as breadsticks. After 20 minutes and countless servers passing us by I waved down another server and explained our dilemma. This server was also surprised at how we had been ignored and offered to take our order. Upon taking our order he came back to our table and informed us who our server was and said that they had been really busy. There were many servers  several empty tables and it was 9:40pm. Honestly I'm inclined to believe the color of our skin had much to do with our invisibility that night. I told the server he could go ahead and cancel our orders because we would be taking our patronage elsewhere. He tried to convince us to stay, apologized on behalf of the staff and offered us a discount on our meals. But why would we choose to spend our money at a restaurant that doesn't want to serve us, that treats us as if we don't exist.

I went in for lunch and ordered the unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks.  It was $11.00.  There are four choices for soup but I can't eat that much and I choose the creamy chicken soup.  It was ok, nothing special but tasty.  The salad was a huge bowl of house iceberg salad (but I like that) and four bread sticks that I could not finish either.  For the price point, it was filling and the food was hard to screw up.  The reason I give it a 5 star was my waitress Brenda, what a welcome relief from the usual snotty twerps in the food and beverage industry.  Brenda was polite, fast, friendly but not overly so, attentive and smiled.  This made my day as I played the little trivia game they have for you at the table, ate my soup and salad and was waited on by a nice person.

Not sure why there were that many people at the front desk when it was not so busy.\n\nThe server was friendly and efficient.  So we've no complaints with our service.\n\nFirstly we ordered drinks:  Cocktail and wine.  The cocktail hardly contained any amount of alcohol, but at least it was refreshing.  Wine was a pinot grigio which was ok.\n\nAs for appetizers, I'm not sure why they serve mussels that comes with alot of sauce but with no spoons nor any bowl for the shells.  Had to request these which was no problem, but they ought to be standard.  As for the mussels, well, many were closed.  And those that were opened were the smallest ever & also were overcooked so most were shriveled up.  \n\nMains were the pastas.  One included the mussels and prawns, the other was pesto with saut\u00e9ed shrimp.  The former tasted well according to my dining partner.  Mine, however, was awfully bland.  And loaded with oil.  The shrimp were as tiny as bay shrimp.  Needless to say I could not finish my meal & just boxed it to take away.  I even ended up putting spoonsful of the marinara sauce from the mussels appetizer onto the pasta.  Anything for some flavor!\n\nCould not believe the tiramisu was a tiny piece for the price ($8+).  Strangely they serve Irish coffee but with the whiskey on the side.  Never experienced this until now.\n\nAll in all, it's a place that's good for a quick meal (if you are there at non-peak times).  Truly I would not waste time and money to wait and wait to dine here; one is better off going to an authentic Italian restaurant instead.  Also I feel that their prices are quite high for the non-stellar food they offer.  They need to improve on this if they insist on charging these sorts of prices for a chain even.

The front desk began to call my name but they could not pronounce it correctly Paul was pronounced Paw Ki for table of 3. I went up to the counter and said I am Paul C we have a table for three we were not given a pager and it was written down. He shows me on screen and says are you sure this is you I said yes it must be us I'm pretty sure my name is spelled correctly but the last name and initial is incorrect I told her it's Paul last name initial C like cat. There was major confusion between the employees if they had the right person to sit down. After five minutes of scratching their head they gave us a seat. Once we were seated our waitress came and took our orders for drinks and appetizers. We asked for soup but when the soup was brought to our table there was only broth and the bowl was only filled up one third of the way. She said they're out of soup and they're making more. The appetizers then came out but the meatball pizza appetizers we're cold and disgusting. The food finally came out which was not the same as I had ordered before in the past. They have a problem with changing the recipe and maintaining consistency. Also there was no Parmesan cheese offered. Our waitress finally came back and left us with bread sticks halfway through our meal and tried to give us parmesan cheese but the grinder was broken she said she would be back and never returned. A relief waiter presented himself and said your waitresses is on break. Ask them if you can get us two to go boxes and the bill. He came back with the bill and boxes but never return to collect the tab. I had to use the table automated device to page our waiter. Once he came back he asked if I would like change, yes I would like change I told him. 15 minutes later he comes back and tell's me that I cannot ring up the bill because your waitresses is on break and my manager is taking care of it now. Once the manager came back and gave us our change he quickly tried to walk away. I called him back to our table and said I would like to give you some feedback. I explain basically what I did to you above he tried to offer me a gift certificate. This was offered three times in the past. This time I didn't want nothing from them but for them to hear my feedback and maybe do something about it next time in the future. Of course this manager was the one that was bald headed one who ignored me before which I blatantly pointed out to him when I asked him if he could provide a seat for the senior citizen who could barely stand. Also one thing that has disappointed my family for the past two years is that this place is called the Olive Garden but most of the time they don't have any olives not even to give you on your salad. If you are lucky you will find one to two olives in your salad which feeds 3 people.", "author": "yelp m."}

We went in August for my niece's birthday because she loves it there and likes the parmesan cheese. I don't know what it is about this little 4 year old and her cheese, but she always wants it on a plate to eat separately from bread and pasta. The server that time was really bad. She never checked on us and was too focused on one table in our area. It was such a bad experience.\n\nFast forward to this past week when I get a text from my bro-in-law asking if I wanted to go grab dinner with our family at Olive Garden. We got there and had to wait about 10-15 minutes since we had a group of 7. Cameron was our server and he was excellent, deserving of 5 stars. He was patient with our family which included a couple a kids and my older parents. He was very attentive and added personality to the service. I enjoyed that he joked with all of us and with the never ending pasta bowl in season, he was on top of our orders including refilling our soup. I think I'm addicted to the zuppa toscana.\n\nWhen you go to Olive Garden, you know what to expect when it comes to the food. We are talking breadsticks, salad, soup and pasta afterall.

I came here for a friends birthday and wow were we impressed. I been here multiple times and this time had to be the best experience. \n\nFirst thing is we were told wait time was 30 minutes but that was a given. since it was dinner time. We got seated half the time so that was nice.\n\nSecond, We were greeted by our server James. He gave us the specials and since it was a birthday, he recommended wine and gave birthday boy a glass on the house. Although we ended up purchasing the bottle anyway, it was a very nice gesture.\n\nThird, our order was taken right when the last person put their menu down. It was as if he was watching us but obviously it was just perfect timing. But I'd like to think he was on top of his game. After he took our orders, he brought bread and was constantly on top of serving us. Filling our glass with either wine or water. \n\nBirthday boy dinner came out last and it wasn't that great so James took it back and got another similar dinner that was recommended by the chief. Food came out hot and James actually came out with the chief. We were so surprised that she made sure the birthday boy liked his food.\n\nSo by this time, obviously we ate and got merry. the check came out and we noticed birthday boy meal wasn't even included so we asked if it was correct. They gave him the meal on the house. Say Whaaaaaat?!?! OK, now that is what I call superb service right there.\n\nWe obviously gave James a big tip which included the cost of birthday boys meal only because we know how difficult it can be to make a dime now a days. \n\nThank you Olive Garden staff for the great experience.", "author": "Julie B C."}

Yes it's a chain and some of the dishes here are pretty decent but the overall experience at Olive Garden is nothing to celebrate.\n\nIf it wasn't for the unlimited breadsticks (which I personally love and can never eat enough of), and the unlimited soup, which you have three choices of. There's really no reason to rejoice. Olive Garden has a pretty solid menu when it comes to options for Italian cuisine. They recently have changed their menu to showcase some of the newer flavors and taste to the consumers but overall most of the dishes are lackluster and nothing too special. Yes it's a chain restaurants so most people ask what what do you expect? But I've been to a few chain restaurants were at least they had a few dishes that stood out from the rest.\n\nHowever the seafood Alfredo, in my opinion is pretty tasty. The scallops and shrimp are sweet and savory and it's close to Freshness you can get at this Resturant.  Unfortunately especially at this location the waiting time between courses is generally 20 to 30 minutes, and in my opinion unacceptable. The Decor is worn out and outdated and can definitely be touched up for a more classier modern look. The utensils even have a beat up worn out look and feel to them and I have found them to be dirty 80% of the time that I've been here.\n\nUltimately it comes down to the customers choice whether or not to continue to come here. Yes it could definitely be a hit or miss but if you want a Italian food without paying high Italian prices. That's especially at restaurants in or around the North Beach area or even downtown San Francisco, then why not stop at the Olive Garden. Just don't get your hopes up too high and expect to be blown away by anything and that's including the service.", "author": "Donald W."}

We walked in about 5:30 is last night on Sun...We were told it was about 20-25 m in wait and we wandered in the bar area?? Opps I should have said \"other dining room\".. There were 4 stand up bar tables, three other tables and about 6 places at the bar on stools..... There was NO place to sit an enjoy a before dinner beverage as EVERY SEAT was taken by people eating!!! What happened to a nice area to enjoy an adult beverage or what ever before dinner...??? we were called to our table by one of the lighted vibrating thingies...we were given menus and asked if we wanted a mother drink or some other kind of beverage. My partner ordered a drink and I had my seltzer water. We were brought our salad and bread sticks, They were the best of the whole dinner, Salad was nice and flavorful. Dinner came and bit disappointed. My partner had the eggplant parmigian  with a side of spaghetti with a runny plain tomato sauce... Chef Boardi would have been better... I had the stuffed shells and they were almost decent.. By the time I had way through they was cold...\nOur salad plates and the salad bowl and plates that was pushed out of the way sat on the table for the entire meal... and we had to ask for it to be taken away. My partner had asked for water and the waiter brought one only and never asked if I wanted some too??We ordered dessert, with the other plates and everything still sitting on the table...We were never asked if we wanted coffee or anything else for that matter.. At one point I had to go the the mens room... What a mess.  towels all over the floor and we will NOT discuss what else was not the floor...I had to have a word with the manager... We had a gift card and and the bill was still above $50. above the $25. gift card... We were sorely disappointed in the service and the food at best was really no even marginal.... We made our last trip to this establishment. It was very expensive for the lack of good service and frankly, lousy food.. Clean up your act people!!\nStefn W", "author": "Stephen W."}

Unfortunately, each time we go back we grow further and further disappointed. The long wait times for a table don't help, either.\n\nOur last trip to Olive Garden nearly a year ago will probably be our last for a long time.\n\nOur Chicken & Gnocchi soup(s) had a combined total of 1 piece of gnocchi across two bowls. Really, it was just chicken soup. And they weren't even generous with the chicken. The salad was mostly iceberg.. disappointing, though understandably a decision that the powers that be probably thought smart budget-wise. At least before more of the American public decided to educate themselves about healthier eating habits. We've tried a number of entrees, most of which were just OK. \n\nThe garlic bread is still delicious, of course... but can you really justify going to a restaurant just for the garlic bread?\n\nI'll probably be back again at some point over the next two years, if only because it's often one of the most convenient and reliable options when you're in suburbia.", "author": "Asha S."}

And MORE shame on you, Olive Garden. Our party of 6 did not enjoy our service tonight.. Nor the food. 4 people in our party arrived earlier than the BF and I, so since we were running late, I told them to order first. They ordered appetizer and 2 entrees to share. When I arrived, the appetizer came and we were out of breadsticks. I was deciding on what to order and asked for a refill and the waiter gave me hella attitude and said he was waiting for me to order first. The other couple in my party asked about the status of their order and he gave hella attitude and said they told him to wait for the rest of the party to arrive. How are you going to tell your customers they said that when they didn't? And on top of that, you'll keep insisting and arguing about it? This guy needs to take some Waiter 101 courses. \n\nNext, the food. The salad was salty as hell. The food just looked like a blob. Ordered the Tour of Italy and it was horrible.

I feel like I really don't even have to describe the food - I can make better at home. So I'll just tell you about the farce they refer to as \"good\" service.\n\nYesterday, we called to make a reservation for 10. We were told that Olive Garden doesn't take reservations and that we had to wait like everyone else. When we eventually got the manager on the line and let him know that we had no problems taking our service elsewhere, he was more than ready to oblige and ensure that we would have a table.\n\nTonight, when we arrived, it took nearly 10 minutes to get the waitress to acknowledge my existence. Honestly, if you are unable to do your job, let us know so that we can form a line behind the guy that is doing his job. When we finally checked in, we were asked to follow one of the waitresses to the back. Our table wasn't set up yet, which was fine, there was a large empty space to the side (probably from the tables they moved to form our long table) and we all stood there being conscientious of other customers. However, the waitress who was setting up was definitely less than friendly. Different people in our party heard phrases like \"can you not stand there, you are in my way\" (we really weren't) in addition to \"orientals can never follow directions\" (you're just full of sunshine, aren't you).\n\nWhen we got around to ordering, we were serviced by a waiter who clearly had some odd stereotype about Asians and how we share food. Instead of making his way around the table and asking what each person wanted, he stood at the head of the table and asked \"anything else?\" after each entree was ordered...um, okay? Not only did everyone at our table order their own entree, but we also ordered a few sampler appetizers as well as specialty drinks. Don't sort us into the same group with your stereotypical cheap Asian families. \n\nThe only redeeming factor for most of this night was our server Dale, who was highly attentive of how filled our water glasses were and if we ever wanted additional cheese on our dishes.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-31", "description": "I went here for lunch today and ordered the Chicken Parmigiana Breadstick Sandwich.\n\nOlive Garden is known for offering unlimited breadsticks and soup or salad with its entr\u00e9es. I picked the salad and was given an enormous bowl of salad and three breadsticks to eat. Being the type of person who feels compelled to eat everything I'm given, I was still eating the salad (hadn't gotten to the breadsticks yet) when my entr\u00e9e was brought out. Now, I recalled that Starboard Value released a famous PowerPoint presentation that led to Olive Garden's parent company replacing its entire board of directors. In the presentation, they argued that the default portion sizes for the salad and breadsticks were too large, leading to food waste. They recommended that servers bring out a breadstick for each person at the table plus one additional breadstick. This rule was not followed, since I was given three breadsticks instead of two. I agree that this felt like an enormous amount of food before I even got to my entr\u00e9e.\n\nI searched \"Olive Garden\" on Google News to see how their business is doing since it seemed that they had not made all the recommended changes. I learned that an Olive Garden restaurant in New York is charging $400 for dinner tonight because they have a view of the New Year's Eve ball on Times Square. Well, I got lunch on New Year's Eve for about $15 including tip at this restaurant in suburban California.\n\nThe sandwich I ordered is interesting. It's chicken parmigiana, which is basically breaded chicken breast, served sandwiched inside a wider-than-standard breadstick. It comes with a side of fries. It almost looks like fries and a hot dog when you look at it. I'm not sure I really needed the fries after eating an enormous amount of salad and three breadsticks, and I'm not sure I really needed the sandwich bread after eating three breadsticks. If I go back, I will probably order a more traditional menu item.\n\nOne thing that was kind of peculiar is that there was a tablet-like device at my table for ordering food. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use it to order or if I was going to have a waiter. I was trying to figure out how to order a Dr. Pepper when a waitress came to take my order. A little bit awkward :). The only thing we ended up using it for was for the waitress to run my credit card at the end. She stood there while I picked how much to tip using the device after it presented me with a default, which was also a little awkward.\n\nOverall, I think the food is a good value here, especially for lunch. Unfortunately, I don't go to Olive Garden very often because between the salad, breadsticks, and entr\u00e9e, even without an appetizer, if you eat here often, you will probably get very fat.", "author": "Ryan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-14", "description": "Generally, we like the Olive Garden.  However, this last time - we had a horrible experience!  We arrived and were told we had a 30 minute wait.  We patiently waited, longer than 30 minutes.  When I inquired, I overheard the THREE hostesses talking about how they accidentally sat another party at the table that was meant for us.  Obviously, not pleased.  I then looked at the bar area and asked if we could sit there.  \"No problem\" was the response I received.  So away we went.  Since we had been waiting 40 minutes, we all were hungry and knew exactly what we wanted.  I waited patiently for a server - probably 5 minutes and I saw her walking towards us, or so I thought.  I politely said, \"excuse me\" and not only did she not stop walking, she put up the HAND (talk to the hand gesture)!  WOW.  SO, I go back to the THREE hostesses who are doing nothing and I asked if we were going to get served since the  server told me to talk to her hand.  They then collaborated with the manager, discussing moving the people who they accidentally sat!  At this point, the bar server comes back and says, \"I'm extremely busy so maybe you should sit somewhere else because I can't help you\".  WHAT?  Keep in mind, the manager is now witnessing all of this, but proceeds to look perplexed.  We get up and go back to the waiting area and they end up moving the other guests..wow.  SO, we FINALLY sit (close to an hour, it is about 10pm now) and the manager comes over and says, I'm sorry.  THAT's it. I was kinda hoping the server would come?  Finally, she comes and is a nice lady.  We tell her we are ready to order, place our order.  She comes back with the breadsticks - we are a party of 6, she brings 4 - FAIL.  She brings our salad and guess what, NO DRESSING on the salad - FAIL.  Oh, we also have NO SILVERWARE so I have to ask for that as well.  Finally, dressing comes (after the meal has been served) - FAIL.  We obviously skip dessert at this point.  The bills are now viewable online and I had my daughter take care of it (the tablet was closest to her).  I ask for a copy of the bill, only to realize they OVERCHARGED us for an item.  So, again, waiting game for the server.  I show her the error and she says she will fix it.  She comes back with a gift card for the difference!  Are you kidding me?  I don't want a gift card, I would like my credit card refunded for the over charge.  AGAIN, I have to wait for it to be done.  I will likely not go to this particular Olive Garden again, or at least until I can be less upset about it.  \n\nThe most disappointing thing is that the manager was aware of all of our issues and he did nothing, except the obligatory, \"sorry about that\" and then disappeared.", "author": "Cathy W."}

What we got was pretty disgusting.  Almost everything served was warmed  up canned products, lumped together with a dash of dried oregano.  \n\nMinestrone Soup:  canned beans, canned tomatoes, a little pasta, and two tablespoons of broth, no seasonings = no flavor.  All the kitchen did was to dump the cans into a pot and warm. No actual cooking. \n\nEggplant Parmesan with Spaghetti:  Sauce consisted of canned diced tomatoes with some dried oregano. It still had that canned tin taste because it wasn't simmered/cooked.  Just dumped into a pot and warmed up.  The eggplant was sliced paper thin, overly breaded and had absorbed a ton of oil = very greasy.  \n\nBreadsticks:  The usual tasteless warmed up bread.\n\nRoasted Asparagus:  Not roasted, blanched.  It was served with jar mayonnaise that had a hint of garlic.  Not the citrus aioli described on the  menu.\n\nI'm second generation Italian and grew up eating the real deal cooked by my parents.  I don't expect an American chain restaurant to serve anything close to authentic Italian cuisine, but I do expect more than warmed up canned foods. Weekday lunch for two with tip was $42. \n\nThe food was much better a few years back.  Now, the only tasks required of the kitchen staff is opening cans and frying. \n\nMy server was nice but only came to the table to take the order and drop off the food and bill, which he delivered at the same time.  We were very rushed.  \n \nWe should have stayed inside the mall and eaten Panda.

After letting go of the fact that our appetizer dish was enough to feed a bunch of elves on the North Pole, I noticed that my sister's pasta dish was barely half full and my other sister's chicken marsala pieces were soooo tiny.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-02", "description": "I am humiliated and OUTRAGED by how I was treated when I went to the Olive Garden\u200b at Stonestown Mall last week!  It's not because I am Mexican.  And it's not because I am female but because I am a mother with a newborn baby.  I am Completely SHOCKED by how this restaurant treats families, especially new mothers!  I experienced a new form of SEGREGATION and DISCRIMINATION and I am calling it out: Olive Garden subjects new mothers to PARENTAL DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION!  \n\nAfter finally getting a day out to shop and run errands, I needed a place to change my baby, feed her and get some food for myself.  Being such a fan, I figured that Olive Garden would be the perfect, family friendly establishment.  I never thought that having a baby would entitle me to being treated differently and segregated from the other patrons.\n\nI walked into Olive Garden and the hostess (who's name is Sterling) decided to profile me as a disturbance to the other patrons and completely wrote me off.  She didn't greet me and was utterly rude.  I asked if I could sit in a booth (because it's much cozier and puts baby in a safe location where she's not blocking traffic.)  Sterling said with such annoyance and distain, \"Sorry, we can't put that 'thing' in a booth.\"  I was so appalled that it caused me to speak up and I said, \"This thing is called a stroller.\"  She rolled her eyes and turned around to seat me.  I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because having a baby is new even to me and to be honest, I didn't understand how difficult having a baby is until I had one myself.  Plus, I really wanted breadsticks and baby was getting hungry so I followed her.  We walked past a slew of empty tables in the main dining hall and I started to get concerned as to where she was taking me.  As we got closer, I realized that she was putting me in a room all by ourselves, that was way in the back.  It was almost like a banquet room that had double doors that closed the room off from the main dining room.  It made me feel very uncomfortable because there was no one else in the room and I realized that she was segregating me from the other patrons just because I had a baby.  Phoenix (my baby) is a newborn and sleeps most of the time.  Especially after being fed.   Why would she put me in a dangerous situation where we were isolated from everyone else?  This was a total safety concern.  Being so humiliated really gives you the courage to defend yourself, or maybe it's the momma bear instincts but I said, \"Wait a minute, why are you segregating us from everyone else?  We haven't shown you any sign of being a disturbance.\"  She said that it was because they were opening up for dinner but there were more than enough tables in the main dining room.  Not only that, but it was only about 2 PM!  I asked to speak with the manager and she rolled her eyes and walked away.\n\nThe manager came of course and was very nice about the situation.  She gave me a fantastic server (Jim or maybe Tim) who was upbeat and friendly.  I was so upset that I couldn't enjoy my meal.  I suddenly felt rushed, stressed and uncomfortable.  I had to stay put for a bit because I had just given Phoenix her bottle.  It's better to be safe in a restaurant than in the car or outside.  As calm as I try to be, I am always on edge that Phoenix will wake up and start crying, which would indeed disturb other people and I am aware of that.  It has never happened, but the last thing I want is to feel more stressed because people are now looking at me and annoyed.  It's a shame that people find babies to be a disturbance and inconvenience.  Especially in public.  I never realized how parents must feel until I had a baby of my own.  Am I not supposed to go out and enjoy life?  Am I just supposed to stay holed up until my baby is no longer considered a nuisance to the world?  On that note, why am I confined to places that are \"family friendly\" just because babies are obviously not accepted in all public places?\n\nI am ashamed at the fact that I have brought my beautiful baby girl into a world that has not learned their lesson from 50 years ago.  Religious segregation, racial segregation, sexual orientation prejudice, gender discrimination and now parental segregation.  We have all experienced some form of intense segregation and prejudice but I never realized that parents are still experiencing segregation and having no choice but to accept it.  No one calls it out because I don't think they realize how terribly society treats them.  Most places don't even having changing tables.  Where am I supposed to change my baby?  Am I not supposed to enjoy these places like everyone else just because I have a baby?  Ashton Kutcher was right to petition more changing tables in men's restrooms but believe it or not, there are hardly any in women's restrooms either!\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. would be ashamed at the lack of progress that Olive Garden displays!", "author": "Victoria C."}

The woman told us to wait a moment and ran off to check before we had a chance to say that we didn't mind sitting at a table if there was a wait for a booth. While she was gone, another host politely took us.

We explained that we didn't mind a table and she scoffed before walking off and letting the other host seating us. \n\nWaited ten minutes for our server, Matt, to finally come by. We were all ready to order by the time he came.

And no sign of bread sticks... Finally I asked him if there were still serving the bread sticks and he explained that they came out when the salad did. Okay cool, another fifteen minutes of waiting. However, the table next to us got their breadsticks when their water came out. \n\nThe food eventually came out, and the pasta was bland. Not nearly enough sauce so it was really stiff.

We got a tall table to ourselves in the bar area, where it was a little quieter and the clientele was slightly older, while everyone else had to wait half an hour for their tables.\n\nRoommate's frozen margarita was very, very strong and worth the $5. My cranberry-orange wine spritzer was much less so, but since I was designated driver, I was glad that it wasn't very strong. And for $4, what more could you ask for? Our food arrived quickly (REALLY quickly), the breadsticks were burning hot and delicious, the portions were large, and our server (Michael D, according to our receipts) was wonderfully attentive.\n\nI mean... I've had better (and less salty) food. Who hasn't? But this Olive Garden delivered well tonight, and I might not wait another 15 years before coming back.", "author": "Sharon L."}

So on a rainy night when we decided to go to Olive Garden for dinner, I was extremely excited! However, what I didn't know was my excitement was soon to be killed by the waitress...\n\nThe Wait:\nWe arrived at around 9:05pm on a rainy Saturday night. The place was still very much happening. The host told us the wait should be around 25 minutes. However, after 40 minutes, we were still waiting. So we decided that since we have already been waiting for so long, let's wait a bit more to get a better table at the inner section of the restaurant.\n\nThis may have been the wrong move because we were literally the last people to be seated in the restaurant! There were other people who came after us but were able to get a table before us in the section we requested. After about an hour wait, we finally got a table...(sigh)\n\nThe \"Diet Coke\" Incident:\nAs soon as we sat down, the waitress came to our table with a bottle of wine and put it on our table and proceeded to ask if we wanted any drinks. We thought it was weird to bring a bottle of wine for no reason but we gave her our drink order of one diet coke (bf) and one Strawberry Fresco ($7.75).\n\nWhen the drink came, my Strawberry Fresco looked nothing like the one in the menu's picture but, I know, the picture is always better so no surprise there. \n\nMy bf took a sip of the coke and asked \"Is this diet (he ordered a diet)?.\" The waitress replied, \"No, it should be regular. Let me check.\" She went back and returned with a new coke. My bf took another sip and said \"it's still regular coke\" but before we were able to say anything, the waitress had left. \n\nWhen the waitress returned with salad and bread sticks, my bf said, \"I would like a diet coke and these two are both regular.\" The waitress then said, \"oh! I thought you wanted regular. Let me go get a diet one.\" So now we have 2 cokes on the side of the table, which we didn't know why she didn't take them away with her.\n\nAs we waited, a waiter came to us holding a new coke and asked, \"you want regular, right?\" My bf and I both laughed and didn't understand why they couldn't get a simple order right. So the waiter went back and finally got a diet coke and asked if we wanted to keep the regular cokes. We said no of course and for some reason, our waitress was no where to be found...\n\nThe \"Water\" Incident\nSo we also ordered water from our waitress. Another waiter came and he actually didn't know where the water was for. So he asked a table and they said no. The waiter then asked a guy behind us who was just about to sit down. He said \"I just got here; I didn't ordered it. It must be for them (pointing at us).\" Guess what happened next? The waiter didn't believe the guy so he puts down the water at his table and RAN away! The guy and us were laughing and brought the water to our table.\n\nThe Food\nTo be honest, the food was mediocre at best. I had Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara ($18.50) and bf had Stuffed Chicken Marsala ($17.50). I know they are not known for their food but we could totally had a better time and food at I Luv Teriyaki (please go read that review). \n\nThe best part of the entire meal was the bread stick and salad...\n\nThe Service (need I say more?)\nWhile we were eating, we found out the reason why our waitress brought the wine bottle to our table. Apparently, she was supposed to ask us if we wanted to try it on the house. We learned this by watching the waiter who brought us the correct coke asking people at his table. So yeah, our waitress just decided not to do any of that stuff with us...\n\nBy the way, we were both really nice through out this ordeal. We never got angry or raised voices. Basically I think the waitress ruined my very first Olive Garden experience.\n\nThe only way I would go back to this place is 1) not getting the same waitress (even that, I would choose another restaurant first) or 2) being blindfolded and taken to this place without my consent.  \n\nAm I being too harsh? I don't think so. I was a waitress once and when you make mistakes, you drop everything and you fix it--not sending another waiter to fix it. Additionally, you should never assume because we all know it will only make an ass out of you and me!", "author": "Alice L."}

Now I guess some would think it's unfair to compare authentic pasta to Olive Garden and maybe it is but since my palette has been upgraded, I find it that the restaurant I once thought of as \"fancy cuisine\" is now more of a last resort. Where do I begin though? The pasta is a bit too salty as I usually order the creamy pasta and I can honestly say that I enjoy their Zuppa Toscana over anything else.  The breading on the calamari didn't have flavor their sirloin pasta was less than average. Actually, the sirloin was the only enjoyable part of the meal.

We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table. Once we were seated our waiter quickly comes by and asks us if we would like to sample their house wine, and after we agree he then cards us. I feel he should have asked if we were of age then ask for the sample. I don't understand that train of questions that he chose with the wine.....anyways, the wine was nasty! I've had better wine  elsewhere. The wine was very very warm and I just didn't like how it tasted. \n\nMy friend and I came because I wanted to try the special three course dinner for $13, but apparently that promotion ended. We chose the dinner for two special for $25 instead. The deal comes with EITHER appetizer OR dessert, and the choice of two entrees including the unlimited soup or salad and breadsticks. My friend and I chose the garlic chicken and the shrimp visuvio. I would say the chicken Alfredo was the best dish of the night. The chicken was the best part! The noodles...we're good but I felt the cream sauce was a little on the salty side. The shrimp visuvio was alright, nothing special.  You get a lot of little shrimps which was not too bad. The pasta noodles were a mystery though, they were like regular spaghetti noodles with striations on them. They were a little strange to me.....and the waiter said the shrimp dish was spicy, which I was excited to hear because I love spicy food. When I ate though, I was not feeling any sweat at all. Very disappointing. \n\nOnto the dessert now. I had asked the waiter what the triple chocolate strata was and he did not know so he went to the back to ask. He came back with the description of a cake that can be bought anywhere! A chocolate cake with frosting? Really? Can you not at least sell the product? When I see triple chocolate, I want to hear that it's made with fudge or with dark chocolate mixed with a German chocolate filling or something! Not just a chocolate cake with frosting.....my friend and I went with the tiramisu after hearing that lame excuse of a triple chocolate cake. BAD CHOICE. The tiramisu was probably a frozen cake from Costco cut into a 3x3 cake. It was not rock hard but it was pretty icy when my friend and I ate it. I would have preferred to just get it from Costco if I knew I was going to be eating Costco tiramisu. \n\nI was overall, not satisfied at all with my visit.

The reason I'm leaving a review today is because at this particular Olive Garden my kid left her brand new hoodie and was devastated (we live 2 hours away) I called when we got home and the assistant manager Gary told me he would \"guard it with his life\" until we were able to make the trip back to get it. 3 weeks later we showed up, Gary wasn't there but had left the hoodie in the capable hands of another manager Mike who returned the hoodie to my kid. Not many restaurants would do this in my opinion so thank you SO MUCH Gary & Mike for being awesome people!", "author": "Jessica C."}

We were seated and served by Josh. He was efficient, friendly and attentive. We went with the special (2 for $25.00) The wife had the breaded chicken and I had the chicken alfredo. We started out with the salad (I like ranch dressing which was served on the side) and limitless bread sticks. The entries came out after our second helping of salad. The dishes were flavorful. We opted for tiramisu for dessert which was served cold which I like/\nThe service was fantastic and I tipped 20% which was not bad since the bill was only $39.00.\nIn the old days, I did not like coming here because the food sucked and there were no specials but now things have changed so I am back.\nAfter we left the wait was an hour and 20 minutes so I would strongly recommend coming out before 5:00PM.", "author": "jack d."}

We ordered the 4 courses fiesta italiana, it was me and my husband, and my little daugther, husband food he says was ok, but mine was just HORRIBLE! im sorry,  BUT THATS THE CORRECT WORD TO DESCRIBE MY FOOD!  I ask sor the rissotto bites. And they came in a dirty sauce plate, they were cold and I cant taken with the fork, was too hard to chewed too, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! Then my entree was the fettuchine alfredo with chicken, that was even worse! It came a small portion of the pasta and three freaking slices of chicken, without salt and NO flavor! When I used to came here I always ordered the same thing and was delicious, creamy, and with a lot of flavor, thi one was dry, and it looks that they did it well but probably they leave it a long time waiting to ba served and they arrive to my table cold, but thats not all, even my little one who loves pizza, doesnt like the pizza because same thing, was cold and hard, she can chew it, ( she's 2), and plus of that our server, ESME looks like she was rushing us to eat and pay faster, of course I never came back after this terrible experience!", "author": "Marissa F."}

After enduring a hard day first day back at work upon \"feeling better\", I must have been delirious when I told my husband I was craving OG's Zuppa Toscana for dinner. Surprised, he asked if I was sure if we wanted to go all the way out there. I confirmed \"yes, I'm sure. I'm craving hot soup\". I also needed a gift for a friend so it was convenient we were heading out towards the mall. \n\nThe wait was about 20-30 min so we opted to sit at the bar area. But we saw that a table was opened. Score! Those waiting for seats sorta gave us the stink eye because we had just arrived and already snagged table seating. Sorry you snooze, you lose.\n\nWe probably had the worst meal of 2011 thus far. We shared The Tour of Italy and it was dry, lacked flavor and there were what looked to be burned marks on our food as it seemed the plate was microwaved a full minute too long. The garlic bread sticks were also flavorless. One would think garlic breadsticks should have a somewhat of a garlicky flavor to them. \n\nI hadn't been to an OG in a long time and I don't recall their food tasting this terrible! Prices have noticeably shot up and you would think higher prices equal better quality. Wrong. Quality seemed to have changed for the worse. The ONLY decent thing we consumed was the bowl of Zuppa Toscana. But the bowl was piping hot and hit the spot just right for my nasty cold.\n\nHubs vowed that we wont ever step foot into an OG again. I told him I may have to come back for their soup but hopefully I won't get sick for a long while so we won't have to endure their lackluster food anytime soon.", "author": "Esther A."}

Breadsticks, a great salad, and maybe a passable (but filling) entree of some sort. The breadsticks, salad and soup combo is probably the best reason to go there as adults.\n\nHOWEVER, something I have learned in recent years is that this is a *great* place to have a reasonable sit-down dinner with kids. At least at this particular OG, the wait staff are very friendly to the kids. They're cognizant of bringing entrees faster and handling special orders for kids' dishes. Every time we go, the kids have a great time, I get to have that delicious salad, and the whole experience might cost $35.", "author": "Chris T."}

Let me break it down for y'all here:\n\nOur group: 7 people including the birthday girl, gave the host plenty of notice that we were coming and waited patiently to be seated when we got there which we were, Thank goodness. Our 7th person was a half hour late in joining us, knowing this information I assumed this may be the reason that our waiter did not show up to say hello or offer us water, etc. we just WAITED there starving and thirsty. \n\nThe service: Once our 7th person did arrive we finally got a waiter, the usual hustle and bustle of getting us water and, after requesting it 5 times, finally got ONE basket of bread sticks(OH YEAH, I know horrible first world problems right there). Got our orders in, I must say you can always rely on the unlimited soup and salad there. Except on this particular, special visit our salad had no dressing on it. WTF people? I ordered soup and SALAD not soup with lettuce and some veggies with cheese! The rest of our group that ordered entrees did not get their food until AN HOUR later. The waiter decided to voice his personal problems as to why his service was not up to par and OMG TMI DUDE. You need more help? I'm looking for a job like 1,000 others here in the city! I'll start right now! Psssh, please. \n\nThe overall, get-to-the point summary: Go to f***** Chili's for Christ's sake. If you're going to pay money to be waited on, this place will disappoint you. \"When you're here, you're family\"? HA! I've gotten better treatment at motha-f*ckin' McDonald's I'M LOVIN IT!!!\n\nBut hey, if you love their breadsticks, unlimited soup and salad knock yourself out.

Ok, it's not like Olive Garden was ever a five star creme de la creme dining establishment, but I used to enjoy the occasional visit for the Neverending Pasta Bowl (literally the only time of year I'd visit).  However, yesterday's slow as molasses service combined with the less than mediocre food was just plain bad.\n\nI get it.  Neverending Pasta Bowl, and the crowds flock like it's free.  But this isn't the first time you've offered this event.  Shouldn't you staff your employees accordingly?  Shouldn't you be able to churn out breadstick baskets, bowls of soup and salad, and plates of pasta like a well oiled machine?  One would think.\n\nTook FOREVER for our food to come.  Definitely NOT efficiency at its finest.  We ordered our soup/salad and pasta at the same time, yet waited forever for the soup (how difficult could it be to ladle some soup from a giant pot?), then again forever for the pasta (it's not like they're in the back making each dish from scratch).  And the noodles were barely doused in sauce - what, were they worried they'd run out?  Or how about when I asked for chili flakes and was given a 95% EMPTY shaker?  Even the waiter had a sheepish look on his face when he handed it over (you couldn't take the extra minute to just fill it before passing it to me?) and then said he'd return with more (really, are you surprised he didn't return??).\n\nBad.  Maybe the painstakingly slow service is a tactic for diners to lose their appetites, so they don't go buckwild with the endless pasta.  Regardless, Neverending Pasta Bowl, you just ain't cutting it anymore.", "author": "Mel T."}

Anyhow, the service was great -- the waitress that served us was super amazing in terms of just helping me select my wine. \n\nThen we ordered an entirely unnecessary amount of appetizers (calamari and stuffed mushrooms) because we were hungry, it was lunch and we forgot the delicious salad and bread sticks that came with it. Of course, when the entree arrived we were entirely too full so we had to take it home. Rookie mistake so I advise you NOT to do that. Put all your hunger into the bread sticks and/or salad basket.\n\nAnyhow, I had the Seafood Brodetto and my BF had the Seafood Alfredo. Grant it we didn't taste these parts of the meal till dinner, they were still pretty good.

Our server was Sydney? and she was probably the best server I've ever had at an establishment as busy as Olive Garden when the never ending pasta bowl is the special they're running. \n\nShe had everything to the table in no time... had our plates freshened and our bellies full. \n\nHaving been a waitress for a few years, I know how annoying it is to have a table of 11 request split tabs - but not for Sydney - apparently she wrote down everyone's orders according to numbers and just paired up the couples and had the tabs ready in 2 minutes. Pretty awesome in my book... \n\nWe were told that we were going to have two waitresses as our party was 11 people, (8 adults & 3 kids) but the other girl didn't help do anything but bring random information and stories... lol sorry, no offense. Anywho - Sydney was TOP NOTCH and I hope they post this in their kitchen so that all the other servers can pick up a thing or two from her. \n\nThe food was delish - of course... you can never go wrong with the never ending pasta bowl... however, I was not a fan of the sausage that I ordered with the pasta .... they don't offer chicken anymore with the never ending pasta bowl... so i tried the sausage - not a fan. \n\nOverall it was great.... really happy to see the new remodeled place. \n\nCan't wait to go back.", "author": "Cat G."}

It is so delicious and doesn't taste like alcohol at all yet gives a nice buzz. I hate the taste of alcohol (bad college adventures) but love getting drunk. If all the drinks at bars and clubs tasted like Olive Garden cocktails I would frequent them a lot more. In fact, I've suggested going to Olive Garden to pregame. Ha! Can you imagine a bunch of skimpy clad girls entering a family friendly chain restaurant at 9 pm?\n\nAnyway, back to their food. The entrees at Olive Garden are alright. Their alfredo cream sauce is usually too heavy for my taste. But anything chicken or steak is usually juicy and well cooked. \n\nThe atmosphere is very comfortable.

I'm not going to rant and rave about how fantastic this place was, because it was just some place that wasn't McDonald's or Chevy's. The food tasted like any other Olive Garden however I found the bread sticks were really hard and not enjoyable to eat. The service was moderate although I did see this one server completely ignore some customers to go talk to some female customers and chat it up with them.\n\nI highly doubt I am ever coming back to this place.

The salad bowls, not plates were piping hot, must have came out of the dishwasher, so we had hot salad.  The entrees finally arrived and they were aweful!

Olive Garden still has their unbelievable tasty breadsticks that you can get unlimited refills for. Their food looks gorgeous as always, although the taste isn't necessarily superb. \n\nOne thing I do truly appreciate here is the quality of their service. Even though you almost always find yourself waiting to be seated, once you're in, they make sure to treat you well. The moment you're almost out of water or soda, they immediately appear to replenish your drink so you're never left feeling thirsty. So while I personally recommend checking out a local hole-in-the-wall instead of going to this chain, you can't go wrong with this place if you feel like playing it safe.", "author": "Gajan K."}

One bad thing is that the wait can be pretty long on a busy night (weekends mostly). Their appetizers are okay, just satisfactory since their calamari was mostly batter and not much calamari. Their meals are pretty good. I was super full from the breadsticks and salad + the meal itself. It was definitely a lot of food. I would suggest to come with a lot of people so you can get a bunch of different things to share. One plate is definitely good enough for 2 people. It was super filling since what we got had a lot of cheese. The service was alright. The lady that served us wasn't in the best mood that night, probably because it was busy. It was eh. But if you're in the mood for moderate price Italian food, and also get full, this is the place for you. The ambiance is pretty nice too.

It was very disheartening but I ordered something \"healthy\" Grilled Chicken Spiedini (Skewered chicken marinated in Italian herbs and extra-virgin olive oil. Served with Tuscan potatoes and grilled vegetables.) 12.75 It was not good! The chicken was gross. I can make better potatoes and no wonder white people don't like veggies!

It's a chain and the quality of the food is on par with most chain restaurants out there. There is absolutely nothing innovative or creative about the dishes served here. What they do do decently is churn out dishes that are catered to the American palate, meaning that some dishes could've used just a little less salt or a little less oil. \n\nThe service here is great. The unlimited refills on breadsticks, salad, and soup is perfect for my cheapo Chinese family. I know everyone raves about their breadsticks but I personally found them a little too salty. I like that they come out hot and it's so soft but I could taste the sodium creeping into my body. The salad is just a bland garden salad. Yawn. The soup was surprisingly good though. I had the creamy chicken soup. \n\nFor my entree, I had the fettuccine alfredo. Fettuccine alfredo is such a basic dish that it's hard to get wrong, right? Well, Olive Garden did not pass the test. The sauce had a weird texture to it. It wasn't creamy enough and it was kind of gritty and not very flavorful. Very disappointing. I've had other dishes here that were pretty good though, so it just depends on how you luck out with your order. \n\nFor the prices that they charge, I'd say that the dishes are slightly overpriced. But if you're at Stonestown and you want a place to sit down and enjoy dinner, this is not a bad option.

We wait and wait and wait while countless parties get seated.  Then I began to notice that people who I thought came after us were being seated first.  I chalked it up to different party sizes.  40 minutes came and went.  Now I hate bugging the hostesses because I know what time is always an estimate, and I'm sure they hate when people ask for a status update.  But this time, I just had to do it.  With an attitude, the hostess looked up our name and sassily said, well I paged for you a few times.  I told her that I was seated right in front of her and it didnt go off.  She took the pager from me and tested it, and low and behold it didnt work!  AHhh, I was not happy.

I had personally never been to one and during the course of walking the mall front to back, I got nothing but silly questions like, \"How have you never been to an Olive Garden?\" \"What do you eat?\" and \"You're kidding, right?\" Apparently, most of the country has already been to Olive Garden so many times it's been compared to the McDonald's as the fast food for Italian. I dunno-every place deserves one chance. \n\nThe dress was aptly compared to McDonald's and as soon as we stepped in, I realized why. There's nothing wrong with the decor as it is a corporate restaurant and that's just the way it looks. The host seemed unsure of himself and stuttered as we stood there. He seemed nervous when explaining our options, \"Um, it'll be like a 10-15 minute wait unless you want to sit at the bar. They cut a bunch of servers and we filled up all of a sudden.\" I really didn't need all of that information and just smiled and said, \"we'll wait over there on the bench.\" \n\nWe were promptly sat in the quoted time and had the misfortune of getting sat with one of the rudest, surliest servers I've ever had. He couldn't remember what drinks we had ordered, made a snide comment when I asked for a water, and apparently was so busy talking to other tables, he had other servers drop off drinks and bread. We all ordered salad and somehow, at 2 p.m. they also ran out of ranch on top of common courtesy. \n\nThe food isn't anything spectacular but it's decent to say the least. After the terrific service given by every staff member we encountered, I wasn't expecting better from the food but food is the one thing that stays consistent at corporate restaurants. I enjoyed my alfredo pasta and chicken parmigiana while my lunch companions continued razzing me about never having eaten at an Olive Garden. Again and again and again. \n\nI'd probably never come back to an Olive Garden again judging by the high price point for noodles and sub par service but at least I can say I've eaten here once.", "author": "Jessica K."}

She prefers Macaroni Grill, but when we tried the Olive Garden at Stonestown, I though that they were the superior of the two.\n\nLet me say first that my rating for this place is for what it is and what it tries to do.  I know that no Italian joint like this is going to be serving primo food, but we go to places like this for mid-level, moderately-priced pasta and sides.  If I want this kind of food, I prefer the Olive Garden because of the proportion of food as opposed to the other places I have been to.  Last time I went here, I got pasta with three BIG Italian sausage links and unlimited salad.  For my buck, this offered me a ton more tasty food than the other Italian places I've been to. That's the difference here.  Add on top of that a pleasant ambiance and good service, and that makes for a great eating experience.\n\nOf all of the Italian-type chains around (excluding pizza, which is another category altogether), Olive Garden is the front runner for me.

The eggplant is breaded so last time it was crispy where as this time, it was as little soggy. I also had a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert valued at $10. Got the Sampler and just paid the difference. The sampler consists of calamari and stuffed mushrooms. I usually HATE mushrooms but I have always been a huge fan of their stuffed mushrooms.

We even pressed the \"call server\" button on the tablet, which blinked for a few minutes and then shut off. There were other servers in our section, none of whom ever acknowledged our presence. Finally, with no service apparent  in the near future and no appropriate meal choices, we left. We will not return.", "author": "Denise R."}

I have never had a bad meal and the service is always attentive and the waitstaff is very friendly and helpful. I usually order the \"create your own pasta/sauce\" dish. I order the wine sauce usually and recommend that as though I love tomatoes, I can't eat too much, and this sauce doesn't bother me. This is a great place to dine if you are craving Italian and don't want to eat in the noisy food court area in the mall. This place offers peace an quiet.

Not about his grandmother's cooking, but if it's truly as amazing as how he makes it out to be, invite me to your next family dinner!!!\n\nI looovvee Italian food, but this place is such a downer. :(\n\nTo me, Olive garden is just some plain average meal. It's comparable to those microwave foods that you find in the frozen food aisle. Sounds harsh, but it's true. Twice, I ordered different alfredo dishes, the last time I went I ordered the one with steak. Thei pasta is just... meh. Nothing special, or rather not a really good combination of flavor. I don't really know how to explain it, but one thing I do know is that I didn't give me usual \"hmmmm\" orgasm sound in the first bite. lol It was also pretty salty, I probably filled my stomach with mostly water or iced tea. Even with the steak, there was no pizazz.\n\nI doubt I'll be coming to this place willingly. Probably only if my friends outvote me into coming here for food. I hope not though.\n\nBut seriously, if you guys want some more authentic, or must plain BETTER Italian food, I suggest going to restaurants around Northbeach area.

I offered to dine at Olive Garden seeing as how she's a huge fan of pasta and pasta and sauce virtually runs in her blood.\n\nWe arrived and asked for a table with an estimated wait time of 15-20 minutes. We were starving so we decided to bypass the long wait for a table and opt for self seating by the bar in hopes of being served faster. \n\nBig time mistake. \n\nIn our quest for a quick bite to eat, the first 30 minutes turned into a nightmare. We sat at our table hoping for a waiter to take our order. For the first 15 minutes nobody came to our rescue and we sat there helplessly seeing other people who arrived after us getting served at a quicker rate while nobody bothered to check up on us. Several people recieved their appetizers while we waited just to have our drink order taken.\n\nTo our rescue came the bartender to provide us our drinks. My girlfriend order the Pink-Mango Lemonade and I opted for a Blue Moon, but sadly, they run out of my choice, so I opted for a 20oz Sam Adams drink, which I would regret as the lunch went on. \n\nWe thought our bartender had saved us and help was surely to come, but for another 15-20 minutes all waiters did were check on the other customers and not once bother to ask if we had been served. Even at one point, one waiter \"accidentaly\" brought someone else's order to our table and served as a tease and a slap in the face for the type of service we were receiving. \n\nSo we waited helplessly again, slowly becoming agitated at the long wait we were subjected to. Again, roughly 30-35 minutes of just waiting there the bartender once again came to the rescue to save us making sure one of the waiters in the area paid attention and took our orders. The waiter, whose name was Anthony, quickly took our order and apologized for the wait. From then on, we received all our food FAST.\n\nA bad start to lunch ended good thanks to the two individuals who saved us. Overall, a crappy start to a so-so start to a great ending.

Seating host wasn't very cooperative not very nice. She said the wait of about 30 minutes, it is what it is, so I felt offended. Second, we were placed in the back room where they had a wedding dinner, big tables with more than 30 people and half of them are screaming kids. Enough said. The waitress seemed tired and out of the mood, so smiling wasn't an option and I felt like I am begging when I ask for something. Salad and Bread, and appetizers came at the same time with the food, whats the point ?\nHalf of the food came cold, so I guess while some food was being cooked, the other dished were waiting under the heat lamp. \nBottom line, wasn't a pleasant experience, but might visit if I see improvements in the future.", "author": "Shadi K."}

Was quite disappointed for the price that I paid. It was not bad, but not as good as my expectation. Service was fast and nice for a takeout service. It tastes ok, however the fettuccine is slightly overcooked and wet for my taste. They also forgot to gave me additional cheese that i asked for. They also did not have pepper, really?? Which for me is a must to eat with any italian dish. Overall, i think i can find many other better italian places around the city, i would not waste an hour to wait to eat here.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

My friends set a reservation and the wait was almost an hour; the place was packed. This was my first time coming here (along with Vivian L. and a few others). We got to our seats and ordered from the 3-course 12.95$ meal. Our server was named Joshua and he was really nice and polite. He forgot to give us an extra utensil set and water refill though, but that is forgiven since there's many other tables to care for. In the restroom as I finished washing my hands, I waited for a fat lady with a gold sequin beret to move so I can get paper towels. She didn't move so I reached over her to get it myself and she screams \"EXCUSE ME, there's another one over there\". Like B*TCH, MOVE THE F OUT. How was I supposed to know there was another paper towel dispenser. I noticed she was picking up paper towels left by the sink, so I believe she was a janitor whom dressed fancy. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this place needs to fire this lady and hire a real janitor who isn't so rude. \n\n1.) Soup: Chicken and gnocchi - I had it with some cheese and I thought it was creamy, but not too thick, and delicious. It had little wonton balls, some green vege, tiny carrots, etc. After the soup, I felt kind of full.\n2.) Entree: Asiago and roasted garlic tortellini with grilled sausage - This was something new for me to try. It's similar to ravioli where there's cheese inside. They topped this with chopped tomato and some marinara sauce. It was okay. I felt so full after eating this. A bit too full.. even though I thought I would kill the food like nothing since it looked like a small portion.\n3.) Dessert: Amaretto tiramisu - This had some cookie crumbs on it and it came in a super tiny cup. It was delicious but sadly I couldn't finish it because I was too full :(\n\nEverything was good except for the dumb janitor.", "author": "Julian Y."}

They are located near SF state and in Stonestown mall. An area full of college students who usually don't have the money to spend on Olive Garden. I also believe it's in a bad location just because it's in San Francisco. There are wayyyyy better Italian places in San Francisco and even near by. \n\nIf you want actual italian food, head down to north beach aka little italy. Olive garden cannot even compare to any restaurants there. If you don't want to head that far, then make your way over to West Portal Paradise Pizza and Pasta where the italian is waayyy better for the same price. \n\nThe food and service here isn't that great. It's always a hit and miss with me. Sometimes you get really good service and sometimes you get service that you just want to get up and walk out. \n\nThe food is usually pretty consistent. I guess there's not much you can mess up on right? Just cook the pasta and pour the sauce and meat over it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-15", "description": "I'm born and raised in San Francisco.  I share the same default reaction to roll my eyes at chain restaurants as other \"sophisticated\" diners in this great city.   \n\nI went to Olive Garden, however, before I became a food snob and knew about the local versus chain distinction.  And I'll be honest:  I had a lot of good times here, as it is the only one in the city.  I have come here during very different stages of life, and I can appreciate it in a different light now, in the sense that it is family and kid-friendly(has changing station in restroom, kid's menu, etc.).\n\nI won't bother comparing this to \"authentic\" Italian cuisine since I have been to many Italian restaurants but never one in Italy.  I think I know what Italian food tastes like.  But here's what you'll get when you come here:  a wait, nice ambiance, pretty good service, tasty food, a full stomach, and an above average price for the check.\n\nWaiting:  They don't take reservations, so if you are coming on a weekend, either come really early(and still have to hang out nearby for 20 or so minutes), or expect to wait for an hour or more during peak dining hours.  I am a fan of their seating, as the booths and tables have adequate space within themselves and between each other.  Their sangria is always good.\n\nAmbiance:  Modern, spacious, clean, including the restrooms.  It feels comfortable without being pretentious here, and because tables are spaced fairly evenly apart, I would not consider the noise levels to be loud.\n\nService:  The servers are usually friendly and helpful, and they will have others assist them as needed for larger parties.  Think clearly of what you need and ask for it when your server is here, because on a busy night they may not be able to check on you that frequently.\n\nThe food:  you need to go in with a good plan.  Certain things you should avoid: \n\n-Skip the appetizers unless you have a large group and want everyone to be able to try a little something to accompany the bread and salad.\n-The Tour of Italy will leave you greased out and loathing anything Italian for days because it's just too heavy.  I advise skipping it along with most other lasagna-like dishes.  My advice instead is to stick with a simple entree because you will not be left hungry from the unlimited bread sticks and salad/soup included with your meal.  \n-Chicken Marsala over the stuffed version.  There isn't that big of a difference between the two.  Since this is a chain, the menu also points out how many calories are in each order.  That will be helpful to at least some in making a decision.  \n-They also have great after dinner mints that comes with the check and are fairly generous with them.  Take them home if you're too full!\n\nPrice:  \n-Spaghetti with meatballs costs $15, and the one without meatballs is among the cheapest items on the menu. Sounds expensive, I know, but the meatballs are huge.  \n-The herb-grilled salmon costs $20.\n-Even a slice of heavy lemon cream cake will cost around $8--not cheap.\nPeople will complain about the cost because it isn't cheap, but I think that between the generous portions, the free accompaniments, and the nice atmosphere, it's worth it.  Remember that the prices include all the freebies, of which I am a fan.  It'd be hard to get out of there without paying at least $25 per person for an entree, drink, and splitting a dessert(you will only need a single slice for two people).\n\nAside:\n-The reviews for the unlimited pasta/soup lunches that occur seasonally should be taken into context:  those will not necessarily translate to an equivalent dinner experience because it is a very different setting and menu.  Try for yourself--I think chances are you'll have a good time here :)", "author": "Stephen N."}

Then, when we were still waiting, another waiter named DECORIUS B came up and asked if our orders were took and when we said no, he was kind enough to take our orders....or so I thought....THEN, he came back with our soups and he forgot to put a spoon on my plate. I understand if it were too busy or it was the end of his shift and he was tired, but it was really slow and it doesn't take that long to run to the back to get something as simple as a spoon. and he then proceeded to go to another table and take their order and took about 20 minutes to get my spoon, who knows how long he would've taken if we hadn't reminded him multiple times. When we finally got our main dish, he didn't even bother to come back to our table and ask us how our food was once and didn't even ask us for a refill on our drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-18", "description": "I go to Olive Garden now and then, once in a few months maybe longer.  However quite recently I've been returning continuously - and at one point went twice in one day (crazy, right?).\n\nFrom that short span of time, I have tried a few things, and others I ordered automatically.  And I figured, I might as well share this with you from what I have noticed.\n\nThe first few times I've been to Olive Garden, I experienced a wide range of horrible to incredible service.  Most of which were horrible or barely adequate.  However, I keep coming back because I admit I love the bread sticks and the darn zuppa toscana.  The salad - it depends on who made it that day.\n\nThe food also has its own range, and I'll just list the ones that I can remember:\n\nAppetizers:\nGrilled Chicken Flatbread - Do not order at any expense! We had it as a dinner appetizer and it was not worth it.  The chicken tasted too bland, the cheese tasted disgusting and dull, and the flatbread it came on was... a bit soggy.  \n\nStuffed Mushroom - I've had wonderful stuffed mushrooms in the past, none of which were priced this extraordinarily high.  Is it worth it? Not on your life.  It was just as they described it - Mushrooms that were stuffed.  In the way that you wanted it?  No.  It was just Mushrooms that were not baked correctly, and then stuffed with breaded cheese.  I suppose it was cheese that was mixed with bread crumbs?\n\nLasagna Fritta - Something that I admit, I have grown addicted to.  It really is a good piece in my opinion.  If you must order an appetizer, I highly recommend it if you love cheese and you love marinara sauce.  On the plus side, it's a great appetizer to share for a group of 6.  Or a group of 3.\n\nClassic Recipes:\nLinguine alla Marinara - I used to order this in the past.  You can never go wrong with it, if you want a pasta but don't desire to have any heavy meet sauce over your noodles.  I do admit to it being overpriced for a linguine...\n\nCapellini Pomodoro - Another good pasta that I have experienced, and like the linguine, overpriced.  But it's pretty decent and I love the garlic and the basil that comes with this dish.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana - I haven't had it yet, but my mother had.  It seems that it has become her favorite dish by far.  She loves eggplant, she loves pasta.  It's a good combination. No complaints from her - and she is a picky eater...\n\nChicken\n\nStuffed Chicken Marsala all the way! Every bite is so good that you can't help but want more even though you're bursting by the seams.  At least, that's what I thought when I tried it - it was only one time and I haven't ordered it again.  But there are times that I am tempted to just go ahead and order it. ... \n\nBeef & Pork:\nChianti Braised Short Ribs:  My new favorite.  When I tasted it, I just wanted to horde it all for myself.  No, seriously, it's THAT good.  The ribs were cooked so perfectly that it felt like they could melt in your mouth. The chianti wine sauce it came with drizzled to perfection that it makes your mouth water.  The only complaint that I had were the risotto. But I can ignore that so long as I had my ribs.  (Too bad that I couldn't finish it in the end and packed it for home.  What's wrong with that?  Well... it's because the next day someone ate it in the middle of the night.)\n\nFilled Pasta:\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni: Good beef, almost as good the chianti short ribs, but I suppose beef is harder to cook because the braised beef was slightly harder to chew in comparison to the ribs.  The tortelloni were okay, In my opinion, the pasta was slightly too limp for my liking.  \n\nRavioli di Portobello:  Super good.  Who needs stuffed mushrooms in Olive Garden when you can have ravioli di portobello?\n\nManicotti Formaggio: Tastes about as good as the fritta - like seriously! We ordered the fritta for an appetizer and then I had the manicotti - it was too much cheese for my liking. But it was SO good.  \n\nDessert:\nTorta di Chocolate - love chocolate?  Hello Torta! However, I will say this:  it won't always be as perfect as you hope it to be.  I had it a few times, and it always either became the absolute perfection as it is in the picture, or it wasn't cooked correctly and when you cut into it, the chocolate did not ooze out.  And you have to wonder, where's the chocolate filling?\n\nTiramisu: C'mon you're in an Italian restaurant...!  It's creamy custard with lady fingers.  It's bound to be good.\n\nAnd lastly some last minute advice that I found interesting during all my trips to Olive Garden:  \nIf you're in a small group of 3-4 or less, go ahead and sit in the Cafe if you manage to get there early enough.  You won't be disappointed - at least I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is faster, and it's like the waiters can read your mind.  Whereas when I sit in the booth, they take longer and they are not as personable.", "author": "Nina M."}

We got there and got seated in about 5 minutes. So far so good. We were seated in the booth- which seemed like it was a conscious decision made by the people seating us. (Later on I commented on how there were lots of other seats available elsewhere in the restaurant- I physically got up to look around- but we were placed in the booth. Seemed like it was a place for younger folks or people with kids or I might even dare say \"minorities\").\n\nAnywho, our waiter came to get our order and he did not seem too happy but that's okay I guess the only bad part was that I felt extremely rushed. We ordered our food; the food came. The toscana soup tasted great like always but it seemed like it was poured messily into my bowl- there was soup everywhere around the edge of the bowl. The breadsticks- which I LOVED (note past tense)- were horrible! They tasted like cardboard and felt like they were once frozen. (I LOVE CARBS but those breadsticks made me sad...)\n\nOur dishes were disappointing too. We ordered the chicken parmigiana and something else I didn't bother to remember. The portions were extremely small! I could've sworn it used to be bigger. The parmigiana came with only one small piece of chicken breast and the tiniest bit of pasta and the other dish was all thin pasta with red sauce over it. We could've made these at home and it would've turned out much better.\n\nFood usually makes me a happy lady, but the food here and part of the service just made me become one pissed-off lady. I left the place wondering about how the seatings are arranged, angry, and very unsatisfied. I didn't even want to take the leftover pasta dish home but I didn't want to waste food. My boyfriend left and felt sick afterwards- he blamed it on the salad.

So WHY would one go here, you ask...\n\nI have no idea.  I used to go to the Olive Garden when I lived in rural North Carolina and there weren't really a lot of options that weren't Applebee's, Chick-Fil-A, or a steak house.  I love Italian food, grew up in an area of the North East where most restaurants serve really fabulous Italian food made by actual Italian people, and so once lost deep in the South, I was left craving the food I grew up on...but none was to be found!!  So I went to the Olive Garden.  I'm not proud of that.  I probably wouldn't admit it in mixed company at a party.  But, my dear Yelpers, I will readily admit it here so that you know without a doubt, I have PLENTY of experience with this chain.\n\nIt sucks everywhere.  Trust me.  On both coasts, the North and the South, it's all the same:  true, unadulterated shlock.  The breadsticks taste like the ones in the Pillsbury cans (with some garlic powder sprinkled on top, of course!), the salad is \"pre-mixed\" (be afraid, be very afraid!), and all of their food is pre-prepared in some way, so that if you have allergies, this restaurant simply cannot accomodate them!\n\nSo....\n\nGARLIC ALERT:  If you are allergic to garlic, you really cannot eat here, unless you are fine eating loads of salad without any dressing or some of the gross, fried, over-priced appetizers they offer.  Everything else already has garlic in it, and unlike other restaurants, this one doesn't feature actual chefs who might be capable of using fresh ingredients to create something garlic-free to appease your systemic intolerance of the single most over-used ingredient in modern American cooking.  This also applies to other allergens:  this restaurant chain is pretty inflexible because they aren't making your items 100% fresh with your order; they are simply reheating, or assembling items that have already been prepped.\n\nWhy didn't I give them only 1 star then?  Well, the staff here is extremely polite (especially for being located in a shopping mall!), the dining rooms are spacious and clean, and the restaurant is WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE.  So, if you must eat here, at least it won't be a horrid experience.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are so many fabulous Italian restaurants in San Francisco, there's no reason to waste your time, money, and palette here...unless you fully understand that this isn't real Italian food, aren't allergic to garlic, and consider this a guilty pleasure.  That's totally cool.   We all have our fast food fetishes.  But for the prices they charge, you can get a much better quality meal in any of a thousand other restaurants, including really excellent Italian joints all over San Francisco!", "author": "Amy L."}

The food is mediocre at best, very bland and salty. I could make something better microwavable. The desserts are overly sweet and taste oddly artificial. Plus if I'm  paying $25 for a meal I expect to be served much better food. The cheese ravioli was average, the fettucine alfredo was basically just pasta and overabundance of salt.

Slow paced - I went here for Sunday late lunch at 1:30 and got seated at 2:25!  It wasn't a holiday, just a regular Sunday.  Ok, I thought maybe the long wait was just for the seating, but no, the servers take their sweet time to bring us our order.  In fact, the food was delivered to our table at 3:30.  I decided against ordering a dessert for fear that it might reach our table at 6pm.\n\n2. Small portions - I ordered a 3-item sampler and was surprised when I saw the amount of food!  It was not even enough for 2 people (not heavy eaters, may I say) to share.  For the high prices of the food lists on their menu, I was expecting a big portion, but again, I was dismayed by the very little food on my plate.  I could've gone to other restaurants with cheaper prices and bigger sizes.  Oh and the taste is not that great either, just so-so, average food.\n\n3. Service sucks -  Our server put away our salad bowl and didn't even ask us if we wanted a refill.  He proceeded to get our salad plates etc.  So I asked for another serving of the salad.  And there it was, just the salad!  No salad plates, nothing!  I asked for plates and up to the time we finished the salad (we just used our entree plates), no salad plate came.  Also, the waiter won't ask you what kind of dressing you'd like, he just served the salad and that's it.  He was asking us if we wanted a refill for the breadsticks though.  I don't know if he was even looking at our table because he could've seen that we were overflowing with their plain old breadsticks!

Unless you split the check with everyone there, the total for each meal is roughly going to be $15-20 each which seems a little pricy in my own opinion. But people do get a good amount of food, not including breadsticks and soup or salad.\nSeating around dinner is usually heavy as the waits do take roughly 20 minutes to get a seat. But fairly sad marks go to waiting services, as they seem scattered around the entire restaurant instead of having their particular waitress-ing sections all together. It takes roughly 5, 10, 20 minutes in-between visits the waitress made to the table during the entire course. As much as she was going well to try and please. My biggest WTF of the meal involved one particular dish that one person in my company decided to get for their dinner. The  Grilled Pork Veneto had an interesting taste with the roasted garlic tomato sauce that was poured over the raviolis. To be honest, it tastes like chunky salsa on some pasta that seemed too bizarre! As much as I tried to hold onto my food, it still because a pricy meal with an odd taste left in my mouth and stomach.", "author": "A. R. G."}

I like soup, he loves soup.  I love salad, he likes salad.  We both eat a lot, so unlimited portions of each sounded like a good deal.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, I had been to an Olive Garden.  \nIt was a funny story in that many people from my family had gotten together to help a relative move, and *I* was insistent that we should all head to Olive Garden because the commercials made the pasta look good.  *I* convinced the whole lot of us to go. It would require four cars packed full and a 10 minute drive but everyone agreed to go;  I was happy.  Later,  they all climbed into the cars to head to the restaurant, and took off before I had gotten out of the house.  Seriously - they left me behind because they forgot about me.  I sat by the garage in disbelief for 20 minutes - which was exactly how long it took them to get to the restaurant and realize I was missing.  Yeah, the family had a great laugh at my expense and still talk about the event, \"Remember when we left Grace behind?\"  \n\nYeah - very funny.\n\nAnyhow, back to the food.  I believe I had a fettuccine alfredo on that day when I finally got picked up to go to the restaurant, and it was just okay.   I mean - I obviously never returned again for 12 years, so it couldn't have been that good.\n\nIn any case, one evening several months ago, we headed to OG, again based on advertising. \n\nAt this particular location, service was a mixed bag.  Some servers were outstanding, others walked around with a sign on their forehead that read: 'Nobody Home\".  We sat in a typical OG booth and perused the menu to see what was offered.  \n\nThere was only one kind of salad, but about five soups offered.\n\nLet me put it this way.\nNever before or since have I had a salad this boring.  BORING.\nEach soup we tried was begging for a quick death.  It's hard to make all five soups bad, but somehow, OG managed to do just that.  Even accidentally, one of five soups should have been decent at least, but nope, they beat all the odds!\n\nWhen a restaurant offers \"unlimited\" anything, one of the main concerns may be that people with enormous appetites will come and eat them out of house and home.  Well, OG has figured out the quickest way to make sure that not only do people not request seconds - they don't even make a second visit!\n\nWe looked at each other across the table and agreed that this was a good effort at eating cheap and eating healthy, but nope - this would not suffice.  Not for us.\n\nNot in this lifetime.\nWe went home utterly dissatisfied and made instant noodles.\n\nThe upside, though, is that at least this time, I wasn't left behind.", "author": "Grace K."}

I never once adhered to the propaganda that Olive Garden was anything close to that.\nIf the Zuppa Toscana wasn't so freakin' addicting, I'd never eat here. I actually am not very fond of anything else Olive Garden has to offer - whether it's the giant bowl of formed salt and water [olives and non nutrient dense iceberg lettuce], the mediocre pasta that they dry to cover with heaps of shredded sodium and saturated fat so you don't notice, or the phallic shaped rods of tasteless, oily, and sometimes even burned, carbohydrates they call \"bread sticks.\" Doesn't matter. The Zuppa Toscana [a sausage, bacon, and potato soup that is the only thing that can soak kale or Swiss chard into deliciousness] usually makes up for everything else.\nNot this last time. Customer service was so bad it prompted the necessity for a review. \nI came in for lunch with my usual lunch date on a lovely Tuesday afternoon last week. Our waiter, [I wish I remembered his name but he never introduced himself so I didn't even bother] was a monotonous and fidgety fellow whose only joy in life was to keep moving. *Think UPS Delivery guy skits from MadTV, but with a little more creepy eagerness and a lot less enthusiasm.* \nAnyway, he only seemed to feel his most purposeful when returning to our table to pick up ... God knows what ... a fork one minute... another fork another minute... an olive on the table... a plate here...  a plate there -- you get the picture.

Evidently - since I am not a glutton and decided four bread sticks was a little much for me and didn't plan on getting more than what was in the basket - giving my bread sticks to my lunch date \"voided\" the \"unlimited\"-ness. That's fine. I get it. But the waiter didn't tell us - until he cleared everything but the soup bowl from the table and we asked for a refill of the soup. \"Oh I'm sorry,\" he said to the room, \"You shared. According to policy, I have to charge you for another 'unlimited soup, salad, & breadsticks' deal.\" No, thanks.\nHaha. No words, just disgust at the phenomenally disgraceful customer service. \nI mean, I wouldn't have minded had we gotten the warning before ordering or if he was a little nicer about it.. less creepy... anything. Eh. \nI am in disbelief because my last couple of soup quests were better than this. I gotta learn how to make it at home because I am never going back. While I do that, maybe Olive Garden can me a favor and get their employees some human interaction skills... or maybe just that one guy.\n\nThanks, creepy waiter asshole!", "author": "Rosavida C."}

Not the greatest pasta place but it's not cafeteria style tomato sauce over noodles that other cheap places call pasta. It's good, but nothing to drive far for. Coupled with drinks with free refills, this place can be a great value.

Best bet is just hang out by the bar area and swoop in quickly when someone leaves. Unfortunately those bar tables only seat like 3... maybe 4 if you really squeeze. \n\nI always order the Raspberry lemonade which apparently Olive Garden has spent years trying unsuccessfully to get the right mixture for... it's always either way too sweet or watered down.

They really should just assume people are going to be constantly needing refills since that's a main draw this place. And what's with servers sometimes not bringing cheese for soup and pasta?

We were seated in a nice booth and I advised the hostess that it was my mom's birthday and if she could alert the server.   \n\nOur server greeted us and said Happy Birthday to my mother, teased her about being 21 - she was humored (she's 81)...he was very nice.  We started with the Fonduta appetizer- which was YUMMY-- melted cheese blend (fondue) to spread on little slices of assorted bread.  Very, very good!   My husband had the garden salad and my mom and I both tried different soups- she had the chicken gnocchi soup and I had the potato soup- both very good.  The potato soup had a kick- but very good.\n\nFor our entrees- I couldn't decide, so I got the Taste of Italy- a small portion of chicken parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna.  I ate bits of all of it- think I liked the chicken best.  The leftovers will come in handy for lunch tomorrow.    But it was all very good.  Hubby had the mixed grill- skewers of chicken, beef and veggies- pretty much cleaned his plate.  Mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs- well it came as spaghetti and meat sauce.  We advised the server (who was not the one who took the order) and they brought out a side of meatballs very quickly.   Mom is a small eater, she said it was very good and now has 2-3 more meals from the leftovers. \n\nWe were asked if we wanted to order dessert- which we said yes and I purposely spoke loudly around the server to my mom- saying \"you want a scoop of ice cream on your birthday don't you?\"- again trying to remind the server that we had a birthday.   We ordered our desserts and they were delivered- without any birthday celebration...perhaps they don't do that there?  I don't know.

I think that was the case in our case because the place was packed and everyone was ordering some combo meal or something. I had some kind of chicken dish and the serving of chicken breast on my plate was laughable. Even the person serving me the dish seem embarrassed about it.", "author": "Some D."}

Thus our thought was hummm why not the Olive Garden, the commercials seem pretty nice, and people have said they taste good.  OK off we go!\n\nWhen we arrived, it had a nice ambiance, a good flavor to the restaurant.  We were seated and once the waiter came, he asked if we would like to sample the wine of the day . . . (as he shows the bottle).  Umm . . . once we saw that the wine was a \"SCREW TOP\" there was no way I was going for it.  My fiance and I looked at each other and said \"no thanks!\"\n\nWell maybe my expectation were too high, but when I asked if there were any daily specials our waiter was dumbfounded!  He was like \"um . . . we don't really have any specials but we have this pasta bowl all you can eat . . . \"  Wow, I would expect you to at least have some sort of answer.  Then I asked about the board in the front, and he said that they just randomly placed one of the dishes up and he would go check what was up there.  MAN he didn't even know what was on the board!\n\nWell my fiance ordered Chicken & Gnocchi soup with a Berry Acqua Fresca drink and I tried the pasta bowl special.  As an appetizer we went with a sampler of Calamari and Stuffed Mushrooms.  As we waited for our food, we looked at the decor, which wasn't bad expect for our chairs.  The were cushioned chairs with wheels attached to it.  We felt as if we were sitting in a nursing home chair!!!!\n\nWhen her soup came, so did the bread sticks and salad.  For this being my first time, they gave me the whole salad bowl and looked like we were to mix it ourselves.  Wait, isn't that what I am paying for?!?!?!?  My fiances soup was salty, but adding a little pepper helped (a little!).  The gnocchi was very grainy and it tasted like it was frozen and not fresh.  They plopped two large chunks of chicken into the soup as if it was just cut and dropped in.  Ughhh . . .  not good so far.  As for the bread sticks, we were laughing that they were a dinner roll basted with olive oil on top.  \n\nWow so far everything we could have done at home, and made taste better.\n\nMy pasta arrived at the same time as our appetizers.  (I ordered the whole wheat linguine with creamy portabella mushroom) Oh my gosh . . . BLAH.  The pasta was way over cooked and the mushy.  I couldn't even eat more than two bites.  It tasted like it was microwaved!  It was like the pasta was to match the chairs, I was really in a NURSING HOME!!!!  I asked for another pasta bowl, fearful of its taste geting the orecchiette with the three meat sauce.  This bowl was at least edible, with the sauce being decent.  The pasta this time was not over cooked but I could tell they were not fresh because of most of it being stuck together.  That saved my dinner, sort of =P\n\nOur appetizers didn't help the situation because of the calamari.  I love fried calamari, one of my favorite dishes, even if the batter isn't great, most of the time I can forgive it but these were grainy and not very fresh.  There was no chewiness to it and just kinda broke apart in your mouth!  The mushrooms at least had a little better flavor, but still not a fan favorite, but by far the best dish eaten during the night.  Oh and not to forget our Berry Fresca Aquga, it well, tasted like Robitussin cough!   BLAHHHHH.\n\nMy recomondation, not for me, even though it seemed as if many people enjoy it, not for me.  This experience has shyed me away from any Olive garden EVER AGAIN", "author": "Tung L."}

For this who have never been, expect great salad and bread sticks mixed with okay pasta. The Alfredo is really good, for example, but the marinara sauce is...well its kind of bland like a normal tomato sauce.\n\nThe price is also a little high, but to be fair each dish comes with soup/salad and bread sticks. The best time to go however, and when we timed our second trip, is during the never ending pasta bowl. Oddly enough, the never ending pasta is just around $9, so its cheaper than a single, normal pasta dish.\n\nAs for the service, it is generally good. First time we went was okay, but the second time was probably some of the best service we have had (server Josh, who deserves the praise). One problem with this particular location, though, is that it's almost always packed. Its very rare that one will come to this location without a long wait before getting a table.\n\nAll in all, its a decent location. Ever so often one just gets a craving for Olive Garden salad and bread sticks, and although there are better Italian options this one will still probably be exercised from time to time.", "author": "Sami R."}

It will get you by in terms of eating \"Italian\" food but it's as non authentic as possible. Just look at this way. Would a Mexican say Taco Bell is authentic?

The wait was about an hour for a party of 2 so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. \n\nOnce seated we had to wait 3-4 mins before even being offered drinks. Waiter/waitress carrying wine as a form of marketing? LAME!! The first impression i got when my waitress came over holding half a bottle of wine was that she just finish bussing a table and was too lazy to put leftovers away. Unclassy and kind of ruins the dining experience. We ordered the sampler platter with calamari, fried zucchini, and stuffed mushrooms for appetizer. For Entree we had the braised beef tortelloni and ravioli de portebello. \n\nFOOD IS ABYSMAL! Salad and breadsticks were average, nothing as special as some of the other yelper's reviews states. Starting with the appetizers: calamari - soft and mediocre, stuffed mushrooms - chopped up random crap stuff into a mushroom, fried zucchini - over breaded. Their pasta was the worst pasta i have ever eaten in my life. We would've been better off buying a box of pasta from costco. The noodles were so dried out from sitting in the freezer that they were practically cardboard. YES! I AM 100% SURE THESE RAVIOLIS AND TORTELLONI ARE FROZEN!! It is NOT possible that fresh noodles taste this sh*tty. The Braised beef was the thinker of the night. There's tender beef and then there's Olive Garden beef. I'm curious what kind of chemicals they put in there to make the beef that soft. \n\nOverall I will NEVER be back and YOU SHOULD NEVER COME HERE EVER!!!

To Russians, a names day is like a birthday.  It's a saint's day on the religious calendar, and everyone named after the saint gets a party.  Four saints are observed today:  Vera, Nadejda, Lubova, and Sophia.  Translated:  Faith, Hope, Love, and Wisdom.  \n\nThat's a lot of names, and they are popular.  Back in Shanghai, in the 1930s, half the Russian population would celebrate on this day.  \n\nMom asked me out to lunch to celebrate her names day.  OK, why not?  She picked me up, and I took a very interesting ride to the Olive Garden.  Have you ever ridden shotgun with an 81-year-old driver?  It isn't pretty.  \n\nI had doubts about the Olive Garden.  It's a large-corporation chain, after all, and an intrusion of suburbia upon the city.  But it was her names day, and the honoree gets whatever she wants.  \n\nThere are usually long lines and a 1-hour wait at this Olive Garden.  Today, at 1 pm, the wait was 5 minutes.  Numerous dining areas wrap around the entrance, and we found ourselves in a little 12-table alcove decorated in an Etruscan style, with pictures of Rome on the walls.  It turned out we had both been to Italy, so the conversation became a pleasant comparison of notes.  \n\nThe waitress introduced herself, and the magic began.  The first thing I noticed was that the staff was polite to everyone.  From babies to great-grandparents with walkers, they had light banter and suggestions appropriate for all.  Our suggestion was to start with a Riesling and a sampler appetizer of stuffed mushrooms and chicken fingers.  The mushrooms were stuffed with clam meat, among other things, and the \"fingers\" were about 1\" x 7\", much more than I expected.  \n\nWhen Mom asked for a salad and I didn't, the waitress brought two sets of plates and flatware, and there was still salad left over in the mixing bowl when we were both satisfied.  \n\nMom ordered the seafood portofino, hold the mussels, and the waitress said that would be no problem.  I chose braised beef and tortelloni.  The seafood was on a bed of capellini, and Mom had a smile on her face all the way through the meal.  The braised beef tips were medium-rare, maybe marinaded, and totally blew my mind!   Tender, and tasty, the beef was top quality.  Although I haven't been in one for 10 years, I fell in love with the Olive Garden all over again with that dish!  The tortelloni had asiago in it, and of course I ate it all.  \n\nI had told the waitress it was Mom's birthday, and they did up a special presentation for dessert:  a black bowtie cake for Mom, and tiramisu for me.  Not a North Beach tiramisu, more like a Ben & Jerry's tiramisu, but it went great with my cappuccino.  \n\nMom swooped down on the check like a falcon on a field mouse, so I didn't get to see what the total was.  I'm guessing, from crib notes, that it was around $80.  But for me, it was free! \n\nBeing kind to your relatives can pay back immediately.  And, as the afternoon food coma sunk in, I realized Mom had succeeded.  My original plan for the day had been sidetracked, and she got her celebration for her names day.", "author": "David D."}

Cori, our server came by a couple of times and seemed irritated that we were still not ready. Lady, calm down. We finally ordered our food and enjoyed our selves while chatting.

The last time I ate at Olive Garden was probably before a high school dance, and I honestly assumed there wasn't one to be found in the city limits. I was wrong!\n\nI went to Stonestown this weekend (long story) and lo and behold, this is where San Francisco is hiding its Olive Garden. I know we have a choice of award-winning cuisines at our fingertips... but I'm genetically incapable of letting a gift card \"go to waste.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the experience was predictably horrible. The dishes were all disgustingly huge and cheesy, my napkin had crusted bits of food on it, and about halfway through my soggy Caesar salad, the man in the booth across from me kicked off his church shoes and let them scoot out into the aisle. On top of all this, the prices were absolutely outrageous. What makes a mediocre chain Italian restaurant think it can charge $15.95 for anything?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-09-27", "description": "It pains me to give this place just two stars when I have had such great memories here.  This review pertains to my last few visits and is indicative of a trend I noticed with the food quality here.  \n\nI've been coming here since the late 90's and have always enjoyed their Chicken Parm and Tour of Italy, as well as trying their season specials and occasionally wandering outside of my comfort zone and trying something new.  The soup, salad, and bread sticks are consistently great and I love coming here for that.  Their entrees are a little on the salty side but I can't blame them for that since most American pallets enjoy saltier tastes as opposed to bland.  \n\nThe wait here is probably one of the biggest complaints here, but I did not factor that into my number of stars.  When I come here, I expect the wait and I plan around it so it doesn't bother me anymore.\n\nI came here last year during their never ending pasta bowl special and was extremely disappointed with the pasta and sauces.  The pasta was either undercooked or overcooked and after sending two orders back because they were literally inedible in addition to the watery sauce, we just gave up coming here.  \nA year later, I thought I would give them another try for my birthday.  As usual, the soup, salad, and bread sticks were all excellent.  When my Tour of Italy arrived, the Fettuccine Alfredo was severely undercooked.  Al Dente was the understatement of the century!  It was so hard to the point where I could have broken a tooth if I tried eating it.  I notified the waitress of the situation and she immediately took it back to the kitchen.  About 10 minutes later, she comes back out with a bowl of new Fettuccine and this time is is less undercooked, but what I would still consider very poor quality food for a restaurant under the Darden Brand and I am shocked that it was allowed to leave the kitchen at all.  About a third of the noodles were too hard to eat. When the waitress asked how the new batch was, I told her that it was still undercooked, but it was fine.  I felt bad enough for her already having to send one order back.  She said that due to the never ending pasta bowl promotion which was going on at the time, pasta quality may not be at its best.  I understand this, but quality should not have to suffer as a result of quantity.  \n\nBecause of this declining quality, I'm unlikely to return here in the immediate future.  If I do decide to come back after awhile, I will not be dining here while the never ending pasta bowl promotion is going on.  This used to be my go-to place in the past and I am sad to see how far food quality has declined in that time.", "author": "Chris L."}

No offense to any of you all here but I hate the people that go into these fast food joints or chain restaurants and bash them for having lackluster food or not providing that five-star, six diamond Zagat-rated, hullabaloo. For me, I know what I'm going into. If I'm going to a place that has cute candle-lit dinners and a bit more pricey plates, I expect it as long as they are attentive but leave me alone a little bit with the good company and fantastic food. When I go to McDonald's, I expect the food to be made quick, taste the same as when I had it last time, and be in and out by someone that knows what I'm ordering, what I ordered, and how to swipe my card. I don't confuse these two scenarios. It's why I don't mind giving bad reviews to that candle-lit restaurant when I feel like I'm at McDonald's or giving a five star review to a McDonald's that treats me like I'm at a fabulous place.\n\nThe Olive Garden at Stonestown, however, really sucks. I used to come here a lot when I was in high school just because it was close by, I love (American) Italian, and it was consistent. I knew what I wanted, I knew it'd be good, and I knew what to expect. My favorites used to be the fettuccine alfredo with some chicken, one bowl too many of the zuppa toscana, and mountains of bread sticks. The price would be good, the family (or friends) would be content, and the service would be just right and attentive. Everyone was happy and I would have happily given this place a four-star review.\n\nI recently came here and noticed that a lot of the prices have changed. Now I'm used to things being priced a bit more, especially if it's worth it. However, this place has really changed for the worst!

I continue to eat at Olive Garden frequently (even though people laugh at me for it) for the following reasons:\n\n1) Great service. Mostly young people work here (late teens to early twenties), so maybe that's not what you'd be expecting. But I've never had a rude waiter or waitress here. They've always been super friendly and attentive.\n\n2) Great food. Though, to be fair, I have an unhealthy love of pasta and I'm not terribly picky. But I've never hated or even disliked anything I've ordered. Never even had a \"eh\" reaction. There are always a few things I want to order from the menu, and I'm always satisfied with what I end up with. Plus, the waiters/waitresses ask you if you want to add cheese to all your dishes: your soup, your salad, your already generously cheese-y pasta dish. As a lover of cheese, I approve.\n\n3) Decent prices. My friend and I ate here all the time when we were jobless and living off our parents. Are you jobless and living off your parents? You can afford to eat here. Most meals are about $10-$15 each.\n\n4) Convenient location. It's right next to the mall, San Francisco State University, the Muni Metro, and several bus lines.\n\nThe only thing about Olive Garden I'm not so crazy about it, is if you go there on a Friday or Saturday night, and you have like a 45 minute wait. Luckily the mall is next door, and there should be enough to amuse you there for 45 minutes.\n\nEDIT: Went there earlier this week... Finally encountered two less than friendly employees. One was, I think, a food runner. The other person was covering our table while the original server went on break. They weren't rude per se, but it felt like they just wanted to get our table over with. A HUGE difference from the usually chummy and sociable waiters and waitresses I've gotten in the past. And they ran out of gnocchi at lunch time. :(\n\nAlso, the prices seem to have gone up.

We were completely absurdly dressed given the venue (but we totally fit in at Decomp!!) and starving, me and Elyssa having been up for about 36 hours, of which all but 10 of them were exceptionally inebriated.\n\nWe got seated pretty quick, and then the fun began. Long story short (if you don't know the Olive Garden's menu, then sod off and die, it's just the same basic crap as any semi-Italian-ish place) we ordered quickly, and then waited. About 30 minutes later, no entrees. WTF???\n\nI don't like waiting. I am not a patient person. I bitch to the manager. Instantly, all of our entrees appear, and they are now free. And if you know anything, it's that free food always tastes better (on a tangent, free drinks always get you drunker, but that's a different law of life).\n\nSo, kudos to you, Olive Garden. You have proven to me that customer service and a desire for customer satisfaction does indeed still exist. And for that, I give you 4 stars (and also the wine tasting...that was a neat touch).", "author": "Irene F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-24", "description": "We were told it would be a 25-30 minutes wait. The guy took my name down and handed me a pager. We walked over to Borders which was right across the street. We browsed around the store a bit. The pager started to play a tune. We walked back to check on our status. We were told that when we were \"out of range\" it would play a tune. Then we were told we had 15 minutes left.\n\nWe walked inside Stonestown to pass some time. The pager lit up and started vibrating. We walked back to the restaurant but before we got there, the pager stopped vibrating. I hand my pager over to the hostess Tina. She looks at the pager with a puzzled look then looks at me. I told her it was vibrating but it just stopped. She looks at the sheet of paper with everyone's names on it. She said \"I'll give you the next available table.\" The next table? Why were we paged then?\n\nI gave my friend an irritated look. Tina or her co-worker gave our table away! We couldn't believe it. We sat down to wait for our table.\n\nThe host escorted two separate couples who arrived AFTER us to their tables. My friend went up to Tina to ask her when we were getting our tables because we were there before those other two couples. Tina said \"I have to tell my co-worker that you're next. He doesn't know about you guys.\"\nWhat?!?!? Isn't that why I along with everyone else give the host or hostess our names? Isn't that why they write it down?\n\nAnother hostess walks over to a woman next to us who just arrived and sat down. She asked her was she next. She said no and looks over at us. My friend and I exchanged looks. The hostess asked herself out loud \"who's next?\" I couldn't believe it! She looked at the paper of names. I walked up to her and informed her that we were next. She was very rude to me. She said \"where's your pager?\" I told her I gave it to the other hostess and I point to her. She asks again in a louder and meaner tone \"where's your pager?\" I also raise my voice slightly and said \"I handed it to her already.\" She asks me \"what's your pager number?\" What?!?! Why would I look for the number on my pager? I told her that I don't know the number on my pager.\n\nTina then decided to speak up. She said to the other hostess \"Yes she is next.\" The hostess walks us to our table and in a very fake voice says \"Your server will be right with you. Enjoy your meal.\"\n\nWe waited for about 8 minutes before our server greeted us. She was really nice. She was the best employee that we came across that day. We both ordered a pizza because it comes with unlimited soup or salad. We both love the Zuppa Tuscona soup. I got the Italian soda with Vanilla. My friend got the Italian soda with caramel. While looking at the drinks part of the menu, I noticed that it didn't have any prices listed. That's something I didn't like.\n\nThe pizza was very good. The crust was soft and not dry like most pizzas. There were only a little toppings on the pizza. And I do mean a little. In my opinion, that is not enough. The drink was good. They put too much ice cubes in it though. Yes I know that is how they make money.\n\n20 minutes into our meal, I heard the hostess call my name. I was shocked! To think if I didn't say anything, we would still be waiting for a table. They truly lack communication here. I don't know how they keep this restaurant running.\n\nI saw a group of 5 hosts and hostesses study the paper with everyone's names for quite a long time. They never called the next waiting customers and walked away. A few minutes later, a different group of hosts and hostesses went to look at the paper for a long time. They also didn't call anyone's name off it and walked away. I'd like to think they were all new employees. Sadly, it is not the case. I have seen most of them the last time we ate there and this was well over 2 years ago.\n\nI overheard an employee say to her co-worker \"today was a good day.\" Today was defined as \"good\"? I don't want to know what a bad day looks like.\n\nEach table was spaced apart nicely. The chairs were comfy and rolled easily. Which made getting out of the chair a breeze. They give you an Andes mint with your bill. I love these mints! It sure beats the regualr red and white \"star\" mints you get at other restaurants.\n\nWould I dine here again? I'd say that I would only for the food but not the service. The servers all seemed friendly and knew what they were doing. It was all the hosts and hostesses that were completely lost and clueless when it came to taking and dealing with reservations. I think they need a better system and definitely more training.", "author": "? ?."}

They have a decent variety of Italian cuisine and wine but the main problem is how crowded this place gets. If you get here during dinner time rush hour, your party will be stuck in waiting for your table traffic for at least 45 minutes.

It is just Olive Garden... come on... don't hate so much... don't tell me you went in thinking it was going to be a trip back to Italy... of course not... it is a chain and as such... you need to rate it as such.  Not in comparison to a fine authentic Italian Ristorante.  \n\nSo, that said... this is a review for the Chain known as Olive Garden.  We all have moments where we just are plain hungry and if you happen to be at the mall... hey, you just might stroll in.  Yes, the wait is ridiculous at times, but they don't hold a gun to you to stay... there is always the other chain across the way. :)\n\nLet's see... the one thing you will find at this place is that since everything is pretty much done cookie cut... you will pretty much always get the same thing... it is consistent... unless someone dropped a salt shaker in the pot or something.  \n\nWhat do I like getting here... well, I am a simple gal... and one dish I enjoy here is the capellini pomodoro... simple angel hair pasta with lots of tomatoes.... can't go wrong with that... on a good day I will order chicken with it... they charge you a little extra... but no biggie.  then there are those bread sticks that are made with some crack on top because I am telling ya... you have one... and next thing you know... you had about 4!  Yeah... I am pretty sure it is some form of crack... then you have the salad... I like their dressing... a little on the salty end... so, I can't have too much before I feel like I need to swallow a gallon of water, but that is ok... I have plenty of refills on my ice tea... which I do not sweeten... I never do... their tea is pretty good... doesn't have the over brewed flavor that some other places tend to have.  So, again... I do not complain.  \n\nAnd after shopping all day... I will actually contemplate ordering an appetizer.  You ca never go wrong with the stuffed mushrooms... hey... they are cheesy!  And also... they have a Mozzarella Fondue of sorts with bread... yummy... cheesy, cheesy!  \n\nSo... that is about it... this place is what it is... and for the amount of food my friends and I manage to eat and take in to-go containers... it is not a bad deal... \n\nSo, if you are looking for a romantic Italian Restaurant to propose to someone at... of course this in NOT the place... but if for some reason you think it is... hey... nothing wrong with that... you do your thing... remember... at the Olive Garden... we are all Famiglia!\n\nMinus 1 star is for the service.... very hit or miss... you can be left out there in the cold for quite some time... bring your own bottled water to save you from getting the Heimlick Maneuver done while eating your food with my drink to wash it down... hey... you never know... you might save someones life!", "author": "Amelia M."}

My dude had the Chicken Parmigiana and he was supposed to get two pieces of chicken, it wasn't the first time we've gotten it and it's supposed to come with two pieces. Two, not one. Rip off. I've had three separate bad experiences at this establishment. I swear the first time it was the chicken piece gone M.I.A. the second was during their never ending pasta bowl. There was nothing never endind about that. They trick you with givin you the first bowl in a HUGE plate then totally downsizing on the next time around. We wanted to try all the combination and our waitress didn't seem too happy with that. The meatballs we added came as followed, 3 on the first serving, 2 on the second and I believe half on the third. The last time we went we had the two appetizer which consisted of the stuffed mushroom and the pork stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was super hard lol hella over fried. Frozen taste to me. The mushrooms were fine I give you that, but definitely a little on the greasy side. And dudes chicken Alfredo was like kid sized hahahaha it sucked for him but luckily I never finish all my meal since I fill up on bread which this time was only like brought out once! What the hell happened to the unlimited soup and salad, WTF, I know it;s a fucking recession but fuck you aint gotta be so cheap! Blargh.the food wasn't the business I regretted going back a third time and our waiter the last time actually stopped me in the middle of my order to go talk to an annoying random dude who was behind a glass window next to us waving at him!

We don't go here often (my 3rd time ever).  But we were treated and I figured I would order safely and not all Indiana Jones.\n\nThe cool part about waiting is that you get a vibrator, er, pager that vibrates.  You can take it with you to Border's across the street while you wait.  Time was well spent as I perused through Skin Art and other flesh bearing mags.\n\nThe srever was prompt to greet us.  He brought our drinks came rather quickly.  He was attentive all night and he gets 5 stars.  The salad is probably the most popular feature.  It is crispy with a  robust dressing.  I had two and a half servings.\n\nMy entree was the braised beef & tortelloni.  Tortelloni's are a bigger tortellini.  It consists of sliced short ribs & portobello shrooms.  The tortelloni's are filled w/asiago.  Yes, its heavy but it was damn good.  I was in shock that I found a dish that would make me want to come back again & again.\n\nNever thought I'd rate OG so high.  Bonus for treating the kiddies well, too.  Although the wait was spent flippin' pages next door it is still brutally long.  Minus a star for that.  Otherwise, my experience was a success.", "author": "Pete M."}

I'm a sucker for pasta and there's something about the Olive Garden that brings out the midwestern PWT side of me. The BF always thinks I'm joking when I suggest eating here, but no, I don't joke about pasta. Somehow I manage to be super picky about upscale restaurants but still manage to forgive a multitude of sins when it comes to crappy chain restaurants. Oh well, such is the duality of life...\n\nThe only dishes I ever order here are the chicken alfredo or the garlic herb chicken con broccoli. Does anyone else think it's retarded that the only \"Italian\" word in that is \"con\", why not just say with? I guess it ups the authenticity, no? \n\nI also think it's hilarious that they, on occasion, serve complimentary wine samples. Especially since all the wine here is TERRIBLE. It's all so sweet and syrupy *disgusted shudder*. Of course I always take advantage of the free wine, since I'm a wino, but I don't enjoy it.\n\nThere isn't really anything else I can say that hasn't been said...Avoid the breadsticks (not tasty and supposedly 140 calories apiece!) get your salad tossin' on and save half your entree for later.", "author": "Melanie V."}

The reason why is because.. well they have UNLIMITED BREADSTICKS, which is FREE =) anything free is good for me. The only bad part about olive garden is all the trouble of parking and waiting to get seated. Because its next to stonestown, you'll be compteting with shoppers for parking spots. Also, because of its popularity, the wait is usually about 50 mins long on a busy night.\n\nOther than that, the food is off the heezy my neezy! Me and my girlfriend always get the same dish because it never gets old to us and we're too scared to spend money on something else and possibly not like it! I dont remember exactly what its called, but the chicken con brocoli is really good. The salad is good because the dressings not too heavy and it fills you pretty good. The zuppa toscana is really good and the free breadsticks compliment it very well. \n\nBy the time the entre arrives, we barely have room in our stomachs to finish half of it! But we dont mind brining it home to eat later on. Any place that can fill our stomachs really good BEFORE we get our appetizing entrees is a good place to us. Olive Garden deserves 5 stars! \n\nWe dont recoomend getting orange juice because it does not come with ice, the peach ice tea is really good though - aimFee", "author": "AimFee G."}

Service was so slow, I would have walked out on any other occasion. The food was bland and tasteless. I forced my date not to even finish his so I could just take it home and season it.

The waiter took 5-10 mins to come over after we were seated and asked  \"do we know what you want?\". He was in a hurry. Here's the really bad part - we added an extra order of all the shrimp you can eat for $4.35 extra.  It was a terrible deal. The first serving sprinkled on the pasta was not much, some small breaded pieces half an inch. When we asked for a second helping of shrimp since its advertised as all you can eat, we got a one inch tube with four tiny breaded shrimp. It fitted on a tablespoon.  So we asked for more. Along came another four small shrimp another tablespoon. Olive Garden should be embarrassed to do this!!!  Its shameful to call it a serving!  The soup comes in a half filled bowl. They really are scrimping.  It was low quality stuff and plain. BS advertising. Each serving needed a long wait for the waiter to show up and what came along wasn't worth the wait.  This was our dining experience on Saturday evening. Oh and when we asked for tomatoes instead of more salad, we got a few small slices I'd say half a tiny tomato.  We gave the waiter a good tip still because its probably the restaurants fault and not his on serving four shrimps and half a tomatoe as \"all you can eat\".", "author": "Jane S."}

So, I decided I should meet her and the kids there so that she could try these \"Rollatini\".  \n\nThe service was fine and the food was what I expected, sort of middle of the road - not bad, but not particularly memorable either.  One thing I found kind of odd was the children's menu.  They have given all of the food names and characters - Bene Breadstick, Ricky Ravioli, etc.  So after her older kid orders, we are presented with a basket of well, Bene Breadsticks.  So, I say to her - \"Would you like to eat Bene the Breadstick now that you have read about his travels?\"  Luckily, she's smart and right on the border of getting the adult menu, so she got the joke.

God forbid that someone else should bring over your DEMANDED items. It shocks me that some of you who are OBVIOUSLY impossible to please are surprised when a server looses patience with you and gives up.

When I went there with my brother last Wednesday, I ordered the parmesan crusted talapia which was pretty decent; my main complaint would be that the amount of angel hair pasta they gave me was a joke. My brother ordered a tortellini dish with steak and boy were the tortellinis in the dish horrible. They were overly salty and bleeeeh. The soups and breadsticks are consistently good. I wouldn't really reccomend this place for it's entrees though. \n\nOh yeah, HORRIBLE wait times.", "author": "Julie L."}

So we hit up the Olive Garden by Stonestown awhile back.  \n\nHonestly I'm not going to comment on the food.  Its not worth my energy.  The service was above and beyond what I would expect at an Olive Garden.  We walk in and there's a 20 minute wait, no biggie.  I would've waited for 20 minutes regardless.  However, there was a little platter of breadsticks and smoothies waiting for us.  Such a nice touch.  The staff at the hostess table were really friendly  \n\nOur waiter had a glass of wine waiting for us when we got to the table.  Granted the wine was nasty and he prob just wanted to sell us more stuff, it was a nice touch.  He gave us opinions of the menu and suggestions of what to order.  And they weren't even the highest price items.  He offered friendly conversation and a smile.  \n\nI wish they had better food because I would come back again just for the service.

I said \"YO do i look like an guy who will be satisfied with 4 pieces\"? (note question mark after closing quote) She even said its alot and worth it.   Hmmmm   I told her I wasn't into appetizers.  Secretly I was gonna fight her and not eat anyway appetizers just to see if the 4 pieces was enough to satisfy me.   So i said OK lets do it.

The soup was really good and went well with the complimentary breadsticks. Joshua informed us that there was unlimited soup and we could try other soups or salad off the $12.95 menu too but I passed because I wanted to save my stomach for the entree. The entree was far from the picture and I thought the portion was small. I ended up having to almost force the food down. I thought the entree was too condensed and tasted a little too fattening. The dessert was comical because it was so tiny. I didn't really care for the dessert because I was already pretty full but I wanted something sweet to end the night. All in all, a great night.

But this last time I went with my roommate it was just a big disappointment. We went in the afternoon this past Tuesday, and got Adam as our waiter after waiting for him to show up to our table for 10 minutes. Once he did show up, he informed us that they were out of Peach Bellini Iced Tea, which was a bummer since that's one of the things we go for! I mean come on, isn't is one of their primary iced teas? Oh well on that, can't complain too much.\nWhat I can complain about is the rest of our service. We each ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. We've gone for this a few times before and didn't really have a problem. But this time it was bad, and it wasn't just the food.\nWe each got the Zuppa Toscana soup first. Our salad and breadsticks came to us about ten minutes later, and about 15 MINUTES AFTER that, our soup FINALLY arrived. Our salad bowl was empty by this time, and Adam didn't even offer to get us another refill of it (um, hello, unlimited salad where???). The soup was obviously the bottom of the bowl stuff. There were just tiny bits of potato in the soup, about one tiny thing of greens, and little to no sausage. I felt like I was eating salty, semi-chunky water. After we finished those soups we had to wait for about another ten minutes before we saw our waiter again, who came up to us with the look of \"so, are you done, or what?\" Rude. So without being asked \"if we would like anything else\", we each ordered the Chicken Gnocchi soup.  Ten minutes later our soup shows up. Right when he placed it in front of me I was relieved because it seemed to be nice and freshly hot. Boy was I wrong about the fresh part. The last few times I've gotten this soup there is plenty of Gnocchi and very good chicken in it. This time, I move my spoon around, and had ONE Gnocchi. My roommate looked at me and I could tell hers wasn't the best either...she didn't have ANY Gnocchi in hers. Even worse, the chicken was so gooey and mushy it dissolved in your mouth like an overcooked potato. We thought about saying something, but figured by the time we even saw our waiter again, and got another fresh thing of soup that WASN'T from the very bottom of the barrel, we'd miss our next class which didn't even start for 45 minutes. \nWhen Adam showed up again, he didn't ask how anything was or if we would like anything else; just gave us our check...with broken Andes Mints :( \nI have thought about calling them and letting them know I wasn't happy with my service. Maybe Adam was having a bad day, or maybe he's always like this, and that needs to change.\nI will go back, but be sure to request that I don't have Adam, and hope I get some good Gnocchi soup next time.", "author": "Kelsey A."}

The first time was at this particular location, like today. I was fourteen and it was my first date. I remember telling people where we ate and even in pre-hipster, pre-StuffWhitePeopleLike 1994; people would roll their eyes and scoff at how inauthentic the OG is.  I always kinda suspected that they were just being jaded. I mean, duh, it's a chain. Pasta Pomodoro's a chain and so is Macaroni Grill. I like eating at those places. But this place is is ridiculous. Most overpriced restaurant ever. We wanted something inexpensive, specifically the soup + bread + salad thing, but they don't do that on Sundays apparently. We ended up getting soup and salad anyway and at full price. We should have just gone to the food court for that, I know. I liked the Zuppa Toscana, but it was really salty. The Grilled Chicken Caesar was gross. Iceberg lettuce, I couldn't taste anchovy or garlic. They just dump some supermarket crap dressing from a bottle all over it. And the croutons were stale. \nOh, and our waiter decided to end his shift mid-meal. We thought he got sick or somebody died. Nope, he just felt like it, according to our new server. Who even does that? And then this new server started griping about her job to us and how he does that all the time, and how \"shady\" he is, and how shady she's not, etc. Then she starts bitching about the aluminum takeout containers and how small they are, and in Seattle, where she's from they actually have styrofoam. Lots of unsolicited information from that one. At least she was attentive. She also hooked us up with that salty soup. Lots of it. So that one star on my review is for homegirl from Seattle.

Recently, during a lunch break from my job at my mom's dental office in the medical building, a fellow employee and good friend of mine and I decided to have lunch at Olive Garden. The restaurant was barely occupied, yet the service level represented an overly crowded restaurant. As mentioned before, the food is not the problem with Olive Garden. At the end of lunch, we were in a rush to head back to work, yet out waiter was nowhere to be found when we needed the check, and once we finally got it and were in need of change, we had to find another waiter to give us our change.

I am writing this right after i left this place not too long ago. I arrived here not even 9:00 and was waiting for a seat for three. The hostess said the wait would be only 15 minutes or less. I waited for 30 minutes till I was seated. \nI notified the host that I would have a third person joining, she informed me that they had to arrive inside before 10:00 pm. It was understandable, however it was minorly ridiculous that we wasted an extra 15 minutes of dwaddle. I was also seated next to the door. It was freezing with wind, is it truly a good idea to seat people next to the door, when there were clearly at least 7 tables available from the entrance to the corner of my seat? \nFine. We decided to just eat as soon as possible and leave before this \"door close\". We waited for about 5 minutes until the server came. I straight up politely explained my situation to her about my third party member. She explained that once it becomes 10:00, no one can come in nor out. So, does that mean we must all leave before 10? Or are we locked up. Exaggerated, but that was a poor explanation. \nWe decided to leave, as our patience wore. What triggered me the most to write this, was the moment we said \"Nevermind, thank you.\" the waitress (By the name of \"Sherry\", excuse me if that is the incorrect way to spell it) scampered off to another co-worker and I could instantly tell she was, as people say, \"talking smack\" about our departure. How do I know? The facial expressions, constant look backs with the co-worker (whom was A white male), and the eyes. Those gestures Can only be one thing.\nI understand the customer is never 100% correct. However, that was the most rude moment of the night. I know very well waitresses and all employees would put up a mask to serve just for the tips and job keeping. Do you honestly believe they work to serve? No, all employees work for money. If you decide to \"talk smack\", at least be discreet about it. \nSherry, if you are reading this, be more discreet about your smack talking. You were rude, fake, and it was pure disrespect. We had no disrespect in leaving, as we left quietly with no complaint. However your atrocious behavior was disrespectful. I don't know how long you've been at food services, but girl you need to step up your game. Maybe even not work for it, regardless of pay.\nI hope the management sees this as not a rant about the closing time an rules. But rather a notification about some of their employees and their lack of respect for others. This could've been avoided easily if Sherry didn't be so obvious as to being a smack talker. Who knows who more of your employees are like that? \nI won't be returning to this Olive Garden anymore, as their employees can't even keep their facade of \"I'm here to serve you\". The worst kind of customer service.", "author": "Iris L."}

The salad, the breadsticks, you have heard it all before.  I have been to many different locations of this chain in several states and always enjoyed myself.\n\nIt has been a few years since I had been here and unfortunately it was a big let down.\n\nThe salad was not properly dressed.  There wasn't enough.  Yet some how it was still wilted and soggy.  Also, thank you for the two tomato slices that came in our salad for four.  I am sure everyone can attest that half a tomato in your salad is adequate!\n\nThe breadsticks looked beautiful in the basket.  The smell was great (yah carbs!), but were really salty.   And I mean, I like salty.  If you are going out to gorge on endless salad and breadsticks AND have dinner, you typically aren't worried about salt content.  But this was too much.  My guess is the used salted butter and put a salad/seasoning mixture on top.  My lips are still dehydrated.\n\nI got the Eggplant Parmigana.  The taste was pretty good.  It is hard to make a fried dish not taste greasy so I take no points away for that.  I do however wonder why I got the world's smallest slice of eggplant known to man and how they were able to 1) cut it that thin 2) cook something that thin 3) why the heck was it that thin?  They either need to give you a thicker piece or lower the price a couple of bucks.  \n\nAlong side the eggplant was a side of pasta.  The sauce seemed \"homemade\".  The tomatoes in the sauce were sweet and flavorful.  Too bad someone forgot to put other herbs in the sauce though.  That was kind of weird.  I wasn't aware that basil or oregano was too expensive for an Italian restaurant to have.  Hmm.  And while I am on my high horse of complaints let me say the noodles were overcooked.  I am not a one year old in danger of choking on al dente pasta.  I can handle it.\n\nLet's not kid ourselves, it's the Olive Garden.

But in a different location than this one, I'd had pleasant experiences with medicore faux Italian food.  And because I'd been craving such a thing, and my boyfriend and I wanted something a little \"different\" from our most often visited eating establishments, we decided to make the trip.. \n\nSo we take the sexy Muni trip with all the sexy people on the train, because they are always so repulsive and disturbing, (sorry.. ..  well, not really).  We finally arrive and are sent to wait, which we had expected, and are fine with.  We're seated, and excited to get to eat those breadsticks that you have to eat with alfredo sauce because the artificial garlic sprinkles they put on it are the only flavor you will get from the bread itself.  \n\nI have soup, Minestrone, that comes with little broth, three shell noodles, and enough beans to make me full.  My main entree, Herb Crusted Chicken w/ Broccoli, or something along those lines, which comes with \"creamy\" garlic sauce.  Our entrees comes out.  Mine is severly lacking sauce, I taste it, and taste nothing but pasta, there's an underlying layer of what looks like water, olive oil, and maybe, just maybe garlic, so I ask the waitress if it is possible to get more sauce, she takes my plate, and the waiting begins.  I know it takes a bit of time to make sauce, but not as long as before I get my entree back.\n\nI get it back, a much more healthy amount of sauce, but..  runny.  I am dissapointed.  My noodles are cold, my plate is hot, my sauce is lukewarm, more flavorful, but lacking the correct texture.  If you're going to list this dish as coming with \"creamy\" garlic sauce, make the sauce creamy, it is not impossible.  Later when my complaints start to irritate my boyfriend, he asks the waitress about it, and she gives some answer about how since it is garlic sauce, it will naturally not be creamy, even despite the \"creamy\" description in the menu.  I'm not an idiot, I can make sauces myself, garlic sauce doesn't have to be runny.  I am not hungry anyway, since I ate breadsticks and soup.\n\nOn top of the lacking food, I believe our waitress was the least fake nice.  I need everyone to pretend like I am important and loathe me when I am not paying attention.  I want my drinks refilled immediately when they are low.  I should not have to ask for a refill.  \n\nIt made better leftovers, but still, not so great.", "author": "Karissa B."}

The food was like fresh from a costco bag to our table. We arrive at 8:30 pm. Number one the girl told was that will be 45 minutes for a table or we can go to the bar that was full too. Waiting by the bar 5 minutes later a table for two came up. We wait and ask another waiter if we could sit, she answer first came first serve, so I m glad we were at the right place at the right time otherwise the 45 minutes will be. We wait for ten minutes to be help while sitting in the table, the table was still dirty. When the guy stop at our table he told us that the bus boy was doing a horroble job, 5 minutes later we found out that he was the bus boy. When the server stop by to help us out, they never wipe the table so I had to had dinner with left overs from the last party. Order a soup, chicken and gnocchi. When they brought it up, was a mix of alfredo sauce ,water and vegetables, very unfortunate I only found 2 pieces of chicken and NOT 1 piece of gnocchi for my entertainment. Went for my chicken parmegiana. Wasnt bad at all. Crispy chicken with good marinara sauce on top and a small crust of cheese. Nothing bad there. The bar have 6 stools, so when we finish our dinner a couple left the bar. So the restaurant was still full, 4 seats of the bar full of 6 in the bar. All of a sudden the bartender start turning off the lights of the bar in a completly mood: \" I have to go home\". At that point we had already order the check, which was taking too long but we realize that places like this we dont need in San Srancisco.

There is almost ALWAYS a pretty long wait and if you sit in the \"patio\" section you won't get as great of service as you would at a normal table. Here are the good parts: Staff is usually friendly, you typically get your food in a timely manner, and (if you order soup-salad-breadsticks like I always do) it is pretty inexpensive and tastes AMAZING. The bad: We once ate in the patio section and it appears we were being waited on by the bartender guy with the longggg black hair. We were seated at a normal table and it seemed like he was more interested in chatting it up with the people at the bar. We waited for 20 minutes for him to finally come back to bring us refills, and ultimately just asked a passing waiter if they could bring it to us since he wasn't paying attention to us. We were there for like an hour and he only came to our table twice: once to get the order and once to bring our food. To top it off, there was a LONG BLACK COURSE hair in my food.... hmmm, my hair is light colored so it couldnt have been mine. He took the bowl back and asked if I wanted another one... Ya, no thanks. We left soon after. Just beware of this server's loose hairs and your food! One server who was amazing was Lou (?) I believe. He is young (maybe early 20s?) and was very attentive and fun! Got our food super quick, always had a full drink, and he went beyond the normal job requirements and asked us our plans for the day and even wrote us a little card to say thank you and to enjoy the rest of our day.

When I was in high school though (and even when I was at CCSF), Olive Garden was about as high class of a restaurant that I would ever go to.  The bf at the time and I used to go here ALL THE TIME.  Now I go maybe once a year - with family.  Because when you're here, you're family!  So I went this past Friday night with my parents for a quick meal.  The wait was 60 minutes (!!).  They gave us the little vibrating pager thing so we walked around the mall.  When you get too far from the restaurant, the thing starts playing music.  Really loudly.  And it's like it knows when you're in a quiet store because it seemed like it only played music when we were in a store versus out in the mall area.  So embarassing!  We finally just went back to the restaurant and only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  I do like their chairs with the wheels.  Those are kind of fun to wheel around in for a while.  I ordered the chianti braised short ribs.  Maybe it's because I had such low expectations but my food was good!  My short ribs were super tender and the risotto was really good!  I only ate about half of my meal because I stuffed myself with salad and breadsticks already, but I took the rest home to eat for dinner the next night.  Two meals in one!

Service was kind of slow .. took them forever to get a to-go box and the check . The to-go box was cute though . It's those aluminum thingys you use to make chicken pies . The atmosphere is nice .. not too overdone , makes me feel at home in a way . Btw , if you plan on visiting .. be sure to come here ahead of time because like The Cheesecake Factory and Buca di Beppo , you have to wait a long time . I think this place takes reservations though . The good thing is that you can shop while you wait .. but be sure not to go too far because the thing they give you  goes off on the second floor of Stonestown .", "author": "Eileen L."}

The waiters are outgoing and active. The free breadsticks are alright, but isn't all that great. My mom can make better, haha.", "author": "Michelle J."}

The waitress who waited on our table  was not customer oriented,  she should not have been hired to work there at all.   For one, our breadsticks never came.  Everytime when we were able to get her attention, her excuse was they ran out of breadsticks and are baking more.  What was strange we noticed all the other tables had breadsticks brought to them by their server.  And how can a restaurant who advertised  themselves as an all you can eat breadsticks, soup and salad joint, run out of breadsticks.  Finally about an hour later, our breadsticks arrived.   There were only 4 sticks in the basket when we had a party of 5.  She was the Olive Garden idiot.    I was so frustrated that evening I wrote to their corporation complaining about the waitress.  Corporation sent me a $35.00 gift certificate to return to Olive Garden.  I just passed the card on to a needy person.", "author": "Eatalot Y."}

I do like the food and atmosphere though.  The breaksticks and salad are good; the pasta isn't bad but not the best.  The service is inconsistent.  They try to sell you the wine all the time.  I like the ravioli.", "author": "Amy V."}

But i was surprised to find that you can now add unlimited meatballs and sausage to your bowls for only $2 more. and they don't skimp on the meat (2 huge sausages per bowl). i also liked that they had one whole wheat pasta option, so there's my fiber. and if you really wanna take advantage, order another bowl, take a couple bites, and box it for a midnight snack. 3 stars cause their food still doesn't taste Italian.", "author": "Douglas F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-26", "description": "Seriously, the OG is what it is. This is not a fine dining restaurant so don't expect too much people. I actually used to work at this OG a few years back. And although i left on somewhat bad terms, i would STILL dine here. I guess i have somewhat of an upperhand since 1) ive tasted every single thing on the menu and 2) i know how they operate. I know when the best times to go are. And a little secret to share with you all, if you come in on a weekend for dinner and its super crowded, sit at the bartop or anywhere in the cafe. There is no wait to sit there but you get the same service and food. The only negative aspect of this place is that sometimes you get stuck with a shitty server. Oh and another tip, this place is big on customer service. Complain to the manager and 9 out of 10 times, whatever your complaint is about, you get comped. Unless you complain about your drink or entree that is halfway consumed lol. All in all, i love the OG food and their peach bellini iced tea. Great place to go for a cheap date or to pig out.", "author": "Liss E."}

So after the gym, we decided we were starving. I mentioned Olive Garden, but these guys were iffy due to their reputation. But, I insisted and so we went. The wait was 1 hour and 30 minutes.. WTF? Though I could not pass up all you can eat pasta for $8.99. Luckily, Stonestown Galleria was still open. Hour and a half later we ordered the all you can eat (+$1.99) if you want meat, but I don't recommend it. The meal came with endless salad, soup, and breadsticks. We decided to leave the breadsticks alone and save our stomach for the pasta. The all you can eat pasta deal consisted of 5 different pastas and 5 different sauces. You can mix and match as you like. Surprisingly, OG offered whole wheat as one the pastas. Anyways, 4-5 orders later we were STUFFED!. Will I do it again? In a heartbeat.. even though the pasta was mediorce at best... Oh.. and the waiter was super attentive on this busy night.", "author": "Simon S."}
