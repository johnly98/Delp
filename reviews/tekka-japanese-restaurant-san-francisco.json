The first and the last time.\n\nThe cast of characters in line waited with great anticipation. One of which, was a repeat customer. His advice to me...\"try to eat the Uni in one bite\" as if I needed an etiquette lesson on how to eat sushi. Thanks man! Only later did I realize that only a whale could eat the nigiri portions here in one bite. \n \nOnce seated, the broadway show began with great fanfare and the old sushi chef played his role by preparing sashimi, nigiri, and sushi rolls while dramatic music played in the background. \n\nAfter an enjoyable shishito peper appetizer and a very large serving of the sashimi combo arrived, I realized I may not survive the night with a few other orders on their way. The nigiri and sushi that followed were massive yet very underwhelming in appearance and taste. I won't even discuss the quality of the sushi rice.\n\nBottom line - If you are crazy enough to wait in line, then order the hot plates and maybe the sashimi.  If, however, you have the appetite of a whale without a discerning sushi palate then maybe you will enjoy your nigiri pieces 5 inches long and messy spicy tuna rolls prepared with Siracha sauce. \n\nThe show ended and I went on my way, leaving this place to the \"foodie\" yelpers who love it.", "author": "Gregory C."}

Nobu San and Yoshimi San are the humans of San Francisco.\nThey opened Tekka since 1980s, and remains the style for years and years. \nTekka only opens Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 6:00 pm- 9:00 pm.

I've heard from so many of my friends that you have to wait at 4:30PM even though the first seating starts at 7PM (Nobu and Yoshimi come in earlier to begin the prep, but you cannot go in yet - so wait!). We lined up on a Monday evening at 4:30PM (group of 4) and we were the first ones in line until about 5:45PM when a couple lines up behind us. Since the restaurant only seats about 10-11 people (7-8 people on the counter and 2-3 people on the small table near the window), we played it safe. \n\nMy friends and I got seated at the bar up close and personal with Nobu preparing all the amazing sashimi orders, hand rolls and nigiri! My bf & i ordered the sashimi combo ($58 for 2 orders - so worth!!!) which contains 2 sashimis of 7 different fish. It was amazing and very fresh! I also got to try the soft shell crab (~$14) and their uni (~$9) so delicioussssssss. The soft shell crab was perfectly crisped. I also must say that for anyone that hates uni for the ocean-y taste, you MUST get the uni here at Tekka because the uni texture is so perfect and the taste is very faint. Everything is comparable to Japan :)\n\nI would definitely come back here if I was in the area and there was no wait... It does take some effort to coordinate when you go! There are only 2 seatings (7PM and 9PM) and they're only open Monday thru Friday so plan accordingly. Also it is important to make sure that they are not on vacation! So check their calendar when you plan your visit.\n\nI highly recommend waiting around 5PM from Mon-Wed but for Thurs-Fri you might have to play it safe and line up earlier! There is street parking, but parking is only free after 6PM.", "author": "Nicole C."}

It's a hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss, run by a sweet Japanese couple. I lived nearby for a few years and walked by it without realizing it was a restaurant! I got there around 5pm, and the woman in front of me was there since 4:30pm. She was a part of a family of four and wanted to make sure her whole family was seated. If you want to get in on the first seating, wear layers because it may get cold and windy while you're waiting (SF weather is so unpredictable) and make sure your phone is charged to pass the time or you can talk to the other people waiting in line! It's always luck as to how many people will be in front of you and whether or not the owners have seats reserved for their friends/family. \n\nAs for the food, we got the Sashimi combo for one person. It was probably the best quality sashimi for the cheapest price in the city (only $34)! The other sushi places I've been to are more expensive for the quantity and quality you receive. (The fish was so fresh!) The sashimi combo for one was enough for my boyfriend and I since we got other food as well. We also got the Hamachi Kama (collar of Yellowtail fish) and Salmon Skin, which were both nice and crispy. I got to try uni (sea urchin) for the first time and got my favorite - unagi (eel) nigiri! Let me tell you, these nigiri are no joke! They were the size of my hand! If you don't believe me, you should go check it out for yourself!\n\nLong story short - be prepared to wait in line, bring enough cash, and enjoy!!

Quality is still on point, and lives up to its reputation whenever I bring my good friends here.\n\nA new update about their menu! It used to be that warm izakaya dishes were ordered by word of mouth. As in there used to not be a menu for anything other than sushi, you had to know what to order from your experience visiting here or politely ask about what was offered that day.\n\nI was surprised that this time they had a small izakaya menu, where most items on it was available on the regular menu. We were so excited and ordered some new dishes!\n\nMiso glazed black cod: sooo amazing there. The flesh of the fish is so fresh and literally melts in your mouth. I love the the fish was so easy to eat, very little bones and each piece came right off. Great quality, very fresh! \n\nSoft shell crab tempura: also very superb. The tempura batter was very light and airy, unlike most places in America. It reminded me of the amazing tempura in Japan. The crab was succulent, perfectly seasoned and wonderfully light and crispy on the outside. I'd definitely get this again.\n\nHamachi kama: was offered in 2 sizes! Small or large. Since we were sharing, we got the large, which was amazing as usual. Perfectly grilled with a wonderful crust for skin, fresh flavor and juicy hamachi flesh.

The sashimi plate is a must- HUGE portion of delicious fresh fish (not fishy at all). I'm super sensitive to fishy flavors and frequently find sushi to taste off? but every piece of fish on the plate was top notch. \n\nNobu created a salmon skin app for each party as an amuse bouche and that is one of my favorite items on the menu. It's salty and crunchy with lots of tasty salmon still left on the skins. \n\nThey've also started printing Yoshimi's Izakaya menu which used to be only known by the locals or those who were bold enough to ask. I think this will go a long way in making people feel welcome even if they're not regulars. I highly recommend ordering a few of her creations for your group.

We were lucky enough to come in on a Monday night and got seated right away, probably due to the rainy stormy weather.\n\nMy friend and I each ordered the sashimi combo, which includes seaweed salad, scallop, octopus, tuna, yellowtail, yellowtail belly (I think), salmon , albacore, and strip bass (I think). We also ordered scallop nigiri (not knowing there was scallop in the sashimi combo), and uni, which we were told came from Washington (yummy sweet uni!). \n\nThe restaurant had a lot of personality to it, and while we were waiting for our food, my friend and I couldn't help but look at all the things they had up on the restaurant walls and shelves. We also couldn't stop watching as Nobu-san was preparing our sashimi. This is an art, I tell you. \n\nThis is a small and cute mom and pop sushi place. We didn't have to wait, but after trying it, I would say it is definitely worth the wait!", "author": "Jia Mei F."}

The first time we went, the couple was closed for vacation but the second time we arrived shortly after 4:30pm and there was no line. They were only hosting 8 people that day because they reserved 2 spots for friends. The 8 spots filled up before 5pm so I would recommend getting there before 5 to have a better chance of securing seats. It is also a good idea to ask the people who are in line how many people are in their party.\n \nI've read that the couple are inconsistent with what time they start letting people into the restaurant, usually between 6:30 to 7:00 pm. Luckily, after a freezing 2 hour wait and dire need for a restroom, they let us in promptly at 6:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant is very small and you're almost shoulder to shoulder with the people next to you. We ordered two of the sashimi combo which is a very generous portion for $28 each. We also got the uni, salmon and eel nigiri. Of the three, I would definitely recommend the the sashimi combo and the eel nigiri which melts in your mouth! \n\nWe had so much food, I had trouble walking to the car. The other mind blowing part was our whole meal came out to $89 which I consider very reasonable for quality sashimi. Oh, remember to bring cash because they do not accept card.\n\nThe experience was very interesting because you get to see everything cut and made in front of you. Next time I come back, I will bring warmer or extra clothes, a fully charged phone and something to do for the next two hour!", "author": "Linda H."}

While the outside is really unassuming, the experience we had inside was so warm and unique - highly recommended to anyone who is a fan of sushi and cute old people!\n\nIt is a bit tricky to get a seat and definitely takes either a bit of luck or a long wait, but there are two seating times, one at 7:00PM and another at around 8:30PM (or whenever the first group finishes). I believe in the past they may have opened at 6:30PM but the past two times I tried, they opened at 7:00PM.\n\nThe first time we came with 3 people on a Monday, we ended up only waiting for about 20-30 minutes until 7:00PM and there was still two spots left when it opened! The second time I tried and when we came at 6:06PM on a Monday there was already too many people in line waiting :( \n\nThe inside only seats 9 people, and once seated we were immediately greeted with warm towels for our hands and hot tea by the wife. The menu is full of spelling errors but I think it really adds to the charm of the place! Here is what we ordered:\n\nSashimi plate - $28/per person - this was an insanely full plate of fish, cute super thick. If you are not a fan of sashimi, I would actually not recommend this as it is an intense amount of fish without much to season beyond wasabi and soy sauce. As we were all big sashimi lovers, this was just heaven for us. Everything tasted fresh!\nUnagi nigiri - We ordered like 8 of these, they are just SO GOOD. And huge! The unagi was juicy and just melts in your mouth. Also, when is it not fun to eat super-sized food?\nScallop nigiri - I ordered two of these and the scallop was really soft and tender. They follow the Japanese tradition of including a little bit of wasabi in each nigiri (besides the unagi) so just a heads up! \nHamachi collar (half order) - My two friends were really REALLY into this. It is grilled so that the skin is extra crispy, like a chip, but the inside is still really tender and flavorful. I personally thought parts of it was a little too dry but still good!\n\nOverall, the meal ended up being pretty expensive, but you do get a large quantity of fresh fish. It is cash only and getting a seat is a challenge by itself, but I think the experience is just so special and on top of that, you get a killer meal of sushi. I'd take this any day over a fancy omakase in downtown SF!", "author": "Jingxi Z."}

Luckily, we had a brave trooper who was able to go straight from work to secure the first spot in line at 5PM! The doors opened around 6:35 and we started to eat at around 7:00. The restaurant is teeny tiny with Diana Ross in concert as a secondary entertainment to Nobu-San's art of slicing sashimi!\n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered:\n\n+ 4 sashimi platters: Definitely could've done with 2 or 3 orders only. The sashimi were sliced thick and super fresh! I personally prefer a thinner slice, but I still enjoyed the sashimi platter.\n+ Unagi: A MUST if you love unagi! You will not regret it. Just like the sashimi, the unagi portions are very generous!\n+ Mushroom baked in ponzu and butter: Yum! Ordered this off the izakaya menu and really enjoyed it. You can really taste the buttah!\n\n- Uni: I love love love uni and appreciated that Nobu-San served it to us with fresh wasabi. However, I've definitely had better and would probably pass on it next time.\n- Hamachi Kama: I'm not usually a fan of hamachi kama and that was true even at Tekka. \n- Ikura with quail egg: It looked much better than it actually tasted. I'd pass unless you absolutely must have ikura. \n\nDining at Tekka requires quite a bit of planning, especially if you want to dine during the first sitting. Last night they seated only 10 people during each sitting, but it sounds like from my fellow Yelpers that sometimes they'll seat up to 11. \n\nHere are a couple of helpful tips for your visit to Tekka.\n\n- Bring a jacket! You're waiting in SF and the fog will absolutely roll in, don't be a fool. \n- CASH ONLY. Bring more cash than what you anticipate to spend. You don't want to be caught in an awkward situation where you don't have enough cash.\n- Don't be rude to Nobu-San and his wife. They have strict seating rules to uphold the integrity of the desired dining experience. If you're rude to them, it only makes sense that they'll be rude back!\n- Don't let your hungry stomach fool you into ordering too much. Their portions are HUGE!\n\nI don't think I have the appetite to come back for a while after last night's hearty sashimi meal, but I would definitely come back again for another Tekka experience!", "author": "Tiffany U."}

One of the easiest five star reviews I've ever handed out!  And an even easier choice for my 900th review, though I was seriously tempted to switch this after my dinner at Liholiho Yacht Club this past weekend...\n\nNow, if there was ever a quintessential \"hole in the wall\", Tekka might be it.  Really, I'm only half joking when I say that you could walk by without noticing it.  At most, the restaurant seats about eleven - maybe seven at the sushi bar and another four by the door.  At the same time, it's about right, given how the place is run by a cute, elderly couple, Nobu-San and his wife.\n\nLike the rest of the restaurant, Tekka's menu is simple and modest, though the quality of the food is off the charts.  Don't come here looking for bento boxes and the like though.  While there are some hot dishes offered, it's all about the sushi here.  Or more specifically, given their more traditional nature, sashimi and nigiri (as opposed to rolls).\n\n-- SASHIMI COMBO - Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi, Albacore, Scallop, Octopus, Squid...$60\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tekka-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco#W3ZB7qTSKXMqUcgh2hGejg)\nI don't know if we actually got extra like they said (since we were sharing), but even if we didn't, the portion was still HUGE!  Not only was everything exceptionally fresh, but the cuts were sizable as well.  Although they were all great, the stand outs for me were the salmon, octopus, and scallops - silky smooth and delicious.\n\n-- LARGE HAMACHI KAMA...$18.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tekka-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco#ASXKPlqb92XwM86QhuHbIw)\nOn the one hand, given the sashimi, a large order was unnecessary.  On the other, this was so good, we easily could have finished a larger piece.  One of the best renditions I've had - lightly fried and crispy on the outside, tender and buttery on the inside.  Every piece was just a mouthful of deliciousness.  \n\nGiven Tekka's limited seating, arriving early for one of their two dinner seatings would be highly recommended (~7pm and ~9:30pm, though it doesn't seem set).  While there isn't always a wait (my friend and I walked right in this time), there's a decent line more often than not (my friend and I were turned away once when the couple in front of us snagged the last two seats).  In the event you do get rejected though, do come back.  Even with all the hype, Tekka will not disappoint!\n\nCASH ONLY.", "author": "Mike L."}

It took me back to Memory Lane in Shinjuku. I love that the space is small and you're so close to watching the sushi master at work. It's run by his wife and him and everything was so delicious. The sashimi platter was $30 and portions were generous. It is NOT omakase. \n\nI also immensely enjoyed the hamachi and the uni was sooo good. Also, order the agedashi tofu! It's quite tasty.\n\nPerhaps I was lucky, but I went on a Monday and even though I waited in line for an hour, there was no need!

I looked it up and behold! Tekka! (I later found that they only put their sign up when they're open.)\n\nIt took a while for me to visit since it's a CASH ONLY joint and the hours are only during the work week. When I was finally able to visit, I decided to come and treat the BF out to a nice dinner. We ordered the sashimi combo, salmon kama,  soft shell crab, yellowtail, tuna, and scallop nigiri. \n\nVerdict: The scallops were amazing. They were so creamy! I also really liked the salmon kama and soft shell crab. They were very well seasoned. I actually saved them for last to keep them as the last flavors that I would have in my mouth. They were that good. TIP: All of their portions are HUGE, so don't order too much. It'll turn your lovely dinner into you trying to stuff your face with the things you can't finish. I did this and at the end... I felt like I was going to burst. Luckily, I had someone to help me finish the meal. \n\nThe restaurant: What's great about this place is that it's very private and you can enjoy Nobu's show and see how skilled he is with the knife. You can see your dishes come together before you.  It's a real treat. The restaurant is also very unassuming, a gem.\n\nAll in all: Great experience and I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Lyra C."}

I was hoping to give this place an easy 5 star but ended up giving them a 4 and possibly even 3.  I am not sure if they were just having an off night or what but the experienced we received was not 5 star.  I was deeply disappointed, especially when I was informed there is no uni, amaebi, or otoro.\nWe ordered:\nSashimi platter and shared it.  big fresh pieces of sashimi (albacore, octopus, salmon, scallops, squid, seaweed salad.  All were very good and fresh.\nNigiri: Yellowtail, Scallops, Salmon, and Albacore.  Again very fresh and tasty, and huge generous pieces.\nSoftshell crab which was probably one of the best soft-shell crabs I have ever had.\n\nPros:\nThe sushi and sashimi is really fresh and tasty.  The Nigiri are the biggest nigiri I have ever had.  \nBest softshell crab.\nIts pretty cheap for the quality and quantity.  For everything we ordered our bill was only $65.\n\nCons:\nThe wife makes it very clear that you are not take pictures so you must sneak your pictures.\nAs soon as you get seated be prepared to order right away.  The wife was getting really irritated with us because we had to change our game plan when we found out there was no omakase.\nNot sure if Nobu didn't like our table or what, but he didn't say a word to us, and when our table tried to talk to him he either smiled or pretended like he didn't hear.\nVery small restaurant and kind of dirty.\nNo Omakase, no amaebi, no otoro, no uni when we went.\nSashimi and sushi is limited to the fish they have on hand.  When we went they only had (salmon, albacore, octopus, yellowtail, scallops, squid).\nBe prepared to get scolded if you order too much.  The wife will tell you if you are ordering too much, even though you have a fast metabolism and can just eat a lot.\n\nOverall:\nI would come back here in a heart beat IF I don't have to wait 2 hours.  The sushi and sashimi is great, but is very limited.  I feel that in order to get the most out of your experience you need to order sashimi plate.  Just be prepared to go with the flow, because it seems that everyday the fish he has on hand varies from day to day, and don't expect friendly service.", "author": "Blair K."}

Its run by an elderly Japanese couple, where the Chef stands at the counter slicing fish and making the sashimi and nigiri portions, while the wife is in the kitchen making the hamachi kama and saute items in the kitchen. Very mom and pop. \n\nThe owner is a self-taught chef, incredible story of the love for his craft. Ordinary elderly guy who turned his cooking hobby into a small hole in the wall spot that everyone raves about on social media, including Yelp.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-05", "description": "So looking on different review sites and other public review posts, people generally say that this place is small, get here early for seating but also expect huge portions....\nTrue, True and True.....I got here at 5:00pm and they don't really open the doors for you till 7pm. And that's granted if they owners didn't decide to take a vacation and not leave a sign for you to read.\n\nThere are a few key things to note when you decide to come here.\n1.Parking Sucks Donkey Dong...\n2. Cash only.\n3.No parties of 4 or bigger (The sign says 5 but 4 is already pushing it because this place is the size of 3 maybe 4  Airplane Bathrooms for customers.)\n4.No Complaining and No To-Go\n\nAnd also, what in my opinion is important. No Special Rolls. (ie:Dragon, dynamite, lion king, golden rainbow, GGB etc...you know, the stuff that looks good on the plate cause of the pretty colors)\n\nFood and Service :\n\nThe sashimi combo here that's offered is given in huge chunks, like cow tongue chunks. but what you don't know ahead of time at first visit is that even tho its listed solely as \"Sashimi Combo\" on the wall, you need to specify if its for 1 person or 2 people. The lady who takes the orders will not specify for you as she will just assume it's for 1. (My fault for not knowing ahead of time)\n\nThe scallop pieces in the Sashimi has a fresher taste and texture than the nigiri order. My best way of describing it is, the sashimi taste like what you would expect in a japanese serving at any reasonable sushi place while the Scallop nigiri taste like chilled saran wrap.....(-1)\n\nThe Tuna Nigiri came one piece per order as expected, but holy crap, the piece was bigger than my tongue. Portion wise its worth the price by no comparison but what came through in the taste for both the sashimi pieces as well as the nigiri order was the crunchy feel of butting through frozen fish on ice....that was the unpleasant part of the evening. (-1)\n\nThe best parts of the meal were as follows.\nScallop pieces in the sashimi, the Salmon cuts given in the combo, the Hamachi Kama that a fellow patron next to us shared was pretty dam moist, but also their hot tea that holds up pretty well overtime and doesn't get cold so fast like the teas served at chinese restaurants\n\nNow keep in mind, this place is primarily for sashimi lovers with a more limited palette. Not to say people don't have a taste, but depending on what you are used too, if you just want straight fish but from a smaller pool to choose from, this will be your spot and frankly one of the more upper-middle tier selections within the area in terms of how much you get\n\nBut if you're like me who wants a lil flavor and modernized technique in how a different selection of fish is prepped and served... I would usually refer people to Sushi Ran in Sausalito...\n\nBoth places can be pricy..but it just depends what you want.....\nIf you want Hamachi Kama + Simple selection of fish, then come to Tekka.\nIf you wanna see whats new in the in the kitchen with a wider range of fish choices, then Sushi Ran may be more appeasing for you..but either way...your wallet will burn...\n\nAs a reference point for tekka: Sashimi Combo for 1 Person is already  30 Dollars before tax and Tip....(Sash Comb- Octopus, salmon, tuna, scallop, maguro and toro)\n No reservations allowed...\n\nIt's not really a place to be wowed at, but if you wanna go just to compare than i guess why not...

One piece was almost as long as my iPhone! I wouldn't bother trying to use chopsticks to eat these. It's perfectly acceptable to eat them with your hands. Don't try to dip it in soy sauce either. Just carefully pour a drop on top of the fish, and shove it in your mouth. The person sitting next to me was fumbling around with chopsticks, and it didn't look pretty. The rice and fish just got everywhere, so save yourself the trouble. \n\nThe selection of fish was pretty limited, and it's mostly regular stuff like maguro, hamachi, and salmon. It was all fine, but I can't really say that their fish tasted noticeably better than other respectable sushi joints. It's just more of it. The best one was probably the plump, sweet, and succulent scallop. They also had ikura that night, so we also got that with a quail egg. I think this is where I thought the quality could've been better. Maybe the ikura wasn't brined or cured long enough or something, but they tasted pretty fishy. Similarly, the saba was also slightly on the fishy side. For the wait we endured, I was kinda hoping that it'd be pretty much perfect. I wish I could comment on the rice, but I honestly don't remember what it was like. \n\nIt's not a bad place, but I think the wait and hype set our expectations too high. I still have to admit that we did get a lot of food for the money.", "author": "Nei N."}

As many have said before, come in on a night you have time to kill waiting in line. Line up at 5:30 to secure a spot. BE WARNED: this place has an occupancy limit of 11 people, and parties can and WILL save up to four people in a party. Meaning if you have one person ahead of you, expect their 3 friends to show up later.\n\nBe friendly with the other few people you're sharing this experience with. It's a homey place. Ask them how many people they have in their party so no one needs to waste their time. I've seen it happen before. \n\nIf you get in, which you will if you're there at 5:30, you're in for a treat. It really felt like I hired my own personal, traditional Japanese chef. He basically cuts and prepares everything in front of you. Order the sashimi combo, unagi nigiri, and enjoy the fresh fish and simple atmosphere that you can't get anywhere else. All I can say is prepare to be amazed.", "author": "Dominic E."}

Tekka, the legendary no name sushi joint that sits 10, came to me in so many different ways. Evening strolls and I became curious over the years and wondered who this older man was behind the counter and what this restaurant was about. Stories from T. He had been here once, with a female friend of his. Then he came alone and got turned away. Stories from M. He had been wondering about this joint. Unbeknown to me, he had been living in this neighborhood, or as he'd call it, \"the other neighborhood\", and he'd wanted to come here, but was afraid of being seen with me, alright then, I don't know how to take that one but whatever. \"It looked interesting.\" M would tell me. I know that! colleague H, who's moved to 4th and Cabrillo, told me about the self induced intimidation he once received while dining alone, and he did not have cash so he ran out of the door and ever since then, he had wanted to return but was too afraid. And finally Colleague K, who had been coming here with his girlfriend for years,  raved about this place. I had almost made into this restaurant one evening but got a bit intimidated for fearing of rejection. That was over six months ago. I never wanted something this bad. \n\nBut was it worth it?\n\nLike going for my very first fight in the ring at a boxing match, my coach, aka Colleague K reminded me to remember to read and memorize the rules. But one rule not posted but should be followed is to never step inside of the restaurant. She will come out and fetch you when she's ready. Alright. Check. And he said, \"rRemember to show up for the second seating, better chance.\"  \"And,\" he added, \"bring cash. Remember to start with the sashimi combo.\"\n\nEquipped with his tips and knowledge, I felt that I was finally ready. Showed up at 7:40 for 8:30 seating. We were the first ones. But within minutes, a northern European showed up. He giddily took photos and informed us that this is the best place in town and totally worth the wait. \"You wait this long for breakfast in this town.\"I recall Zazie experience, it was 1.45 hour on a Sunday. He's right. Another couple. A new threesome. Between 7:45 to 8:30. We were still the first. And everyone should be able to get in. Then.. the European gets three cohorts to join. Starting to feel sorry for the last three. They did not give up. They should have. Because when the second seating door swung open, she greeted us and gave us the best seats of the house (presumably due to the fact I waited outside and never opened the door like an outsider), and she told the last three, \"sorry.\" Apparently there were two seats left for a regular. It marked reserved. Thus, pushing the last three out of running.\n\nI'm at the finish line and I felt hungry. A bit dizzy, in fact. Sashimi combo. Hamachi  kama. Unagi as dessert. Two pieces of nigiri. Oh, a large Sapporo. \n\nApparently everyone started with the sashimi special. It was more than a feast. It's a food vs. man battle. Man almost lost. It's good, fresh and HUGE.\n\nKama was delicious and came next.\n\nUnagi nigiri was insanely huge and tasted delicious. A great dessert item.\n\nAll that anticipation. All those rules. One hour wait time. Assuming you are lucky and showed up on a right night. Insane amount of food and incredibly inexpensive for what you get: extremely fresh fish.\n\nThe only complaint was that it could stand to reduce the fish size. I feel bad for the owner for giving us so much food to eat at such a reasonable price with such a high quality. Is he actually making money? I wonder.\n\nI contemplated about writing about this restaurant. I fear letting the word out for this one. I think this place is already hyped up, and hard to get in... do they really need another raving review? And for selfish reasons, this is the very first time I truly want to write a negative review, just to deter people from going there. \n\nI fought hard to earn a seating time. It was as good as it gets. Possibly the best in this town. Not everyone likes their rules. Perhaps those last three who got turned away would write a nasty review. Perhaps people will be equally discouraged with my review and would give up coming in.\n\nNow I've found this spot and got in, Perhaps perhaps I could keep this place to myself, just for a bit longer.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Since they were early they were nice enough to wait in line until I showed up after work. This was a Monday night and people started showing up 2 hours before they opened, however yelp said 6:30pm but they didn't open until 7pm. When you arrive you should ask the people in front of you how many are in their party so you can gauge if you can make the first seating or not. When we went I saw 10 seats total inside, 7 at the bar and 3 at a side table. Yes it's a tiny place....luckily the 2 girls behind us were lucky enough to get an extra stool squeezed into the Bar Area therefore a total of 11 people were served in the first seating. Second seating is around 8-830 (we didn't see anyone waiting when we were leaving).\n\nNow when ordering, leave your thoughts of the regular portions ordered at other restaurants at the door. The portions and order sizes are huge. An order of hotate (scallop nigiri) usually comes in 2 nigiri pieces but here it's by 1 cause it's HUGE. The scallop on 1 scallop nigiri can be used to make 2 pieces of nigiri elsewhere. Same with ikura (salmon roe) it actually comes in a small martini like glass. Let's just say we definitely over ordered on the nigiri! We also ordered a sashimi combo for 2. Again huge portions, a plate full of fresh seafood (assorted fish, scallop, squid, octopus) if we knew the combo had scallop we wouldn't have ordered 4 scallop nigiris lol \n\nIt's run by little old chef Nobu and his wife and that's it. Not kitchen staff or additional waitresses. Definitely not a place to be loud and rowdy.\n\nMy only complaint is some of the sushi rice was very vinegary. It was pretty potent in a few bites. I seemed to be the only one who caught the vinegar condensed bites tho. \n\nAll in all its a good spot for good quality sushi for a good price. \n\nGood for those days when you have the free time to wait in line and want some sushi or want to try with friends for a special occasion, I'd say check it out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-15", "description": "We had a really phenomenal experience here, so until some other place proves me wrong, Tekka is the best sushi restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nWe arrived at 5:45 on a Monday night and there was already a party of four in line. They are supposed to open at 7, but Nobu's wife came out at 6:30 and let the nine of us in early, thankfully. We seated ourselves around the bar and were served tea before she took our orders. She was very reserved, but not rude by any stretch of the word, as some of the reviewers here have mentioned; she gave us as much time as we needed to decide, and recommended that we wait before ordering more. \n\nNobu came out quietly shortly thereafter, popped in a BeeGees DVD, and went right to work. Even though he was quiet, he smiled at all of us, especially when he saw we were taking pictures or video. He did not mind at all that I was basically dangling my phone above him and his knife, trying to get the best angle possible. His wife was in the kitchen preparing the cooked dishes, periodically coming around to refill our tea cups even though each of the three parties had a tea pot in front of us.\n\nWhat really stuck out to us was the freshness of the fish and how large every piece was, from the sashimi to the nigiri. The salmon was buttery smooth and literally melted in my mouth. You definitely get your money's worth here, so just as Yoshimi suggested that we hold off on ordering too much right off the bat, I would advise you do the same. As for the freshness and quality, Nobu told us that he buys everything wholesale, imported from Japan. At the end of our meal, Nobu made small talk with us, and he and Yoshimi both came out to say goodbye and thanked us for coming. \n\n***TIPS:\n1. Cash only. Bring a lot of it.\n2. When you first get in line, talk to the people in front of you to figure out whether you will get into the 7pm seating (there are only 10 seats to be claimed). There were people waiting in the car in front of the restaurant, hoping those of us in line would give up on the wait, thus making room for their party. On some nights, there are only six seats available if Nobu and Yoshimi have special guests. If you miss the first seating, you can try your luck again at 9:30. \n3. If you're hungry before dinner, have a small snack beforehand; between waiting in line and watching Nobu slowly and purposefully prepare our dishes, we were famished by the time our first dish arrived (Nobu prepares each sashimi combo systematically, going fish by fish, and each party is served their platter at the same time). \n4. They don't do rolls. Or tempura. Or bento boxes. This is as authentic of a Japanese restaurant as you can get, like the tiny ones you would find in a nondescript alleyway in Tokyo. If you don't like raw fish (and tons of it), you are definitely in the wrong place. \n5. The sashimi combo for two ($29/person) is a huge platter of generously cut pieces, and practically speaking, is not meant for two people to share. The three of us were barely able to finish it.\n7. Order the Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar); at $18 for a small portion, I have absolutely no regrets and would order it again in a heartbeat. \n8. Follow the house rules. If you do, you should have a great time just like we did.", "author": "Olivia V."}

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and we ran into some traffic and didn't there until about 6pm. From all the other reviews, 6pm is considered \"late\" if you wanna make the 7:15pm seating, so I started getting nervous that we wouldn't make it. When we got there, there was no one there, and there was still no line even at 6:45pm, so I started to think it was closed for the day since I also read that they like to close randomly without notification. People walked up and mumbled that it was closed, and the two girls that showed up in line were also convinced they wouldn't open. We waited until 7:20pm, and right when we were about to leave, a car pulled up, and it was Nobu & his cute little wife! We got in at about 7:45pm and were seated in front of his work station. There were about 8 of us total. Soon after we got seated, we were served green tea, and his wife took our orders.\n\nWe ordered:\nSashimi combo\nAgedashi tofu\nHamachi kama\n2 unagi nigiri (1 piece per order)\n2 uni\n2 scallop nigiri\n\nTheir nigiri is HUGE--about half the size of my chopsticks. The sashimi combo came with easily 48 pieces of extremely fresh sashimi that Nobu cuts in front of you. I liked how the agedashi tofu came with a mountain of bonito flakes, but the sauce was kindof thick, like a teriyaki sauce. The hamachi kama--GET IT. IT IS AMAZING. The meat is so moist and the crust is crispy, salty, and lemony. GET IT.\n\nOverall, we over-ordered. A group of 2 people next to us left spending about $75, and we left spending ~$115 after tip and tax (oh yeah, CASH ONLY). Tekka is definitely on the low spectrum of $$$ because you're getting a LOT more than what you would at any other restaurant for the same price. And--Nobu and his wife are so cute! When we left, they stopped what they were doing, smiled, and yelled \"arigato!\" The wait is worth it, especially with their extremely reasonable prices and high quality of food.

If you don't follow their rules, you might get a cold stare or two, but I got to see a really cute and adorable side of the chef that melted my heart the way the albacore melted in my mouth. We were treated some of Tina Turner's best songs while we spent 2 hours eating and enjoying the company of other patrons. At one point, Chef Nobu saw me jiving to the song \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and he softly sang a line while preparing the uni.\n\nI was lucky enough to get a seat on my first try and I have no qualms about lining up for 2+ hours for delicious sushi. Parking was easy (if you're willing to feed the meters until 6PM) on Balboa. Me and my partner-in-crime (PIC) came prepared with reading material and were the only ones in line for about 10 minutes. Around 5PM, another person came and said she was saving a spot for herself and one friend. So that makes 4 spots out of the available 11 taken. Around 5:40, a group of 5 people came (they later split into groups of 2 and 3 to avoid being turned away). At some point, I went to the restroom at a nearby Safeway and upon my return, I saw 2 more people. So by the time it was 6:15, all 11 spots were claimed. Apparently, in my absence, a couple more people came by and realized there were no more spots so they left.\n\nWe went inside the restaurant at 7:18 or so and started eating before 8PM. We ordered the sashimi combo, a large hamachi kama, and 6 pieces of nigiri to start. Yoshimi told us we probably ordered enough food so we stopped. Anyway, watching Chef Nobu skillfully prepare our meal was really entertaining. I sat and stared in awe as he took knife to fish and divided all the different goodies into thick, generous pieces. I started getting worried that I wouldn't have room for the yellowtail collar after I finish my half of the sashimi combo. Once I took my first bite of sashimi, I knew I was going to be OK Everything was fresh and tasty. The pieces were intimidating, but you really get more bang for your buck here at Tekka. I thought the sushi rice was a little too mushy for me though.\n\nI paced myself and was able to finish my fair share of the food, but I started feeling really stuffed after downing some hot green tea. I called it quits close to 8:30PM while my PIC ordered 2 more pieces of nigiri. Our neighbors said they were impressed by the amount of food we could eat. This seems to be a common comment/compliment we get whenever we go.\n\nAround 8:55, a couple of eager patrons walked into the restaurant and were promptly pointed to step outside. So please remember to abide by the rules that are posted on the picture section. I did notice that Tekka now takes reservations again. \n\nOh yeah, please bring CASH! They do not take credit card and you'll be left looking like a fool if you don't remember this very important rule. Also note that they don't allow you to take food home. Whatever you don't finish gets tossed out at the end of the night. \n\nSo if you plan on visiting Tekka, be sure to bring a jacket, maybe some water, cash, and be ready to wait. If you're anything like me and need to use the restroom frequently, the nearby Safeway's restroom is on the second floor by the meat section. :)", "author": "May W."}

Expect to spend about two hours waiting outside its closed doors to save your spot for the 7pm seating. Tekka only seats up to 11 people and if you're the 12th person to arrive, better start thinking of an alternative dinner because that front door locks the moment its filled and it won't open again until 9:30pm. It seems so exclusive but it's one of those rare, rare places that are worth the wait and this is the first time I've ever said that.\n\nCASH ONLY -- CASH ONLY -- CASH ONLY\nI cannot say this enough. We ordered a bit more than anticipated and was short $10 so I had to drive to an ATM while my friend had the awkward situation of waiting at the restaurant for my return of some cold hard cash.\n\nI made it to Tekka around 5:30pm on a Tuesday and lucky me, there was a parking spot right in front. I was about ready to feed a dollar to the meter when I noticed my friend was 3rd in line. As he waited in line in the cold, I was in my parked car waiting for 6 o'clock to hit before joining him in line.\n\nWhen we finally got to go inside, we were greeted with a warm, intimate seating arrangement (a bar that snugly sits 8 and a table that seats up to 3).\n\nSASHIMI COMBO:\nNeedless to say, everrrrybody ordered this. If you're coming to Tekka, you're getting sashimi, period. It's recommended to be shared between two people. It's a big plate with large slices of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore tuna, scallop, octopus and seaweed salad. I'm tellin ya, it's the ocean on a plate! My favorites were the albacore and yellowtail ...and salmon and tuna and scallop... haha, refer to house rule #1: everything is good, everything is fresh. Everything IS good and everything IS fresh. The albacore darn-right melted in my mouth! Everything was soft and simply delicious.\n\nHAMACHI KAMA (cooked yellowtail):\nYummmmm! I've only had yellowtail in sashimi/nigiri form (and love it) and having it cooked this way is just as wonderful. It is subtly seasoned and jam-packed with flavor.\n\nHAMACHI NIGIRI (yellowtail):\nOh my goodness, it's huuuuuuge! My friend tried to pick it up with his chopsticks and it simply flipped over because it was top-heavy from the huge slab of yellowtail on there. You don't even see the rice! It was a beautifully-colored large, thick slice and it was delicious. Kudos to you if you could eat this with everything intact.\n\nUNAGI NIGIRI (eel):\nUnagi is what (eventually) brought me into the world of sushi. This was very good unagi but I must admit, I enjoyed the hamachi more. I was able to eat this without it falling apart so yay! Haha\n\nUNI (sea urchin):\nThis tasted like the ocean, literally. I've only had uni once before and I enjoyed it so I figured, \"Why not?\" Then I tasted GOOD uni and realized I don't really like it... Hahah It tasted TOO much like ocean for me. Perhaps it's an acquired taste and maybe it'll grow on me in the future.\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable dinner experience. I will definitely be back for more, especially since I'm the short one who got stuck with the bar wall and didn't get to see the chef at work ):", "author": "Sandy T."}

It's a traditional Japanese restaurant; no tempura or teriyaki. They no longer offer omakase.\n2. It's the size of 1.5 office cubicles.\n3. Only 11 seats are available.\n4. They're closed on weekends.\n5. There are 2 seatings: 7 pm and 9:30 pm. On Fridays, there's only a 7 pm seating. The 9:30 pm seating is reserved for \"special guests\".\n6. Get there NO later than 6 pm for the 7 pm seating (tell lagger friend(s) to come at 5 pm :X).\n7. Parties 4 or more will NOT be seated.\n8. If the owners/couple decide to bring their friends that night, the last 3-4 people in line will be out of luck. So make sure you're one of the first six in line by coming early.\n9. Expect to spend at least 3.5 hours for dinner including wait time (last night, we arrived at 5:40 pm and left at 9:40 pm). \n10. CASH ONLY.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n1. At around 6:30 pm - 6:45 pm, the couple will arrive with their ice box of ingredients for the night.\n2. The restaurant will open on their own terms, so they may open on time at 7 pm or later.\n3. When you're finally let in and seated, Nobu, the owner/sushi chef will start prepping the fish.\n4. Once he's done prepping, you'll be able to order at around 7:30 pm.\n5. Nobu makes similar orders at once. First, the sashimi, next, the nigiri and then, the rolls.\n6. Though it's fun and interesting to watch Nobu slice the sashimi and make the sushi, he does it in a snail pace so we didn't start eating until 8 pm.\n7. Everything starts wrapping up at around 9:20 pm to prepare for the next/last seating at 9:30 pm.\n\nF O O D\n*SASHIMI COMBO (Feeds 2): A mixture of the freshest catch of the day - Salmon, Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Yellowtail, Scallop, and Octopus.\n\nEverything was super fresh with a delicate melt-in-your-mouth softness except for the octopus which was a little chewy. If you appreciate fresh out of the ocean and high quality sashimi, this is a MUST order. \n\n*NIGIRI: Salmon, Scallop and Unagi ($3.50 each) - Huge slabs of salmon, scallop and unagi topped the perfectly al-dente vinegared rice. \n\nThe fresh butteryness of the salmon and scallop paired perfectly with the blank canvas of rice. Topped with a savory sweet sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, the warm unagi was luxuriously rich and fatty with a subtle nuttiness from the sesame seeds. \n\nWe also ordered the following Hot Plates:\n\n*AGEDASHI TOFU\n*STEWED EGGPLANT\nServed together, these dishes were mediocre. The tofu was more firm than silken and lacked the sticky gelatinous pull from agedashi tofu that I'm used to. The eggplant was soft and tender but nothing to write home about. Both shared a savory sweet sauce which had a weird gloppy texture. \n\n*HAMACHI KAMA\nLightly salted, the hamachi collar was also mediocre. Normally, the collar meat is much more creamy and buttery in texture but this one just tasted like regular fish flesh. \n\n*TUNA TATAKI\nLightly seared to a rare, the tuna was then sliced and topped with scallions and a ponzu sauce. Though the tuna was very tender, the ponzu sauce was too salty and overpowered the tuna.\n\nIN SHORT, stick with the sashimi and sushi and skip the hot plates.\n\nS E R V I C E\nNot the Japanese hospitality we expected from a small, authentic Mom and Pop Japanese restaurant.\n\nNobu was very quiet and cordial. He did what he did best and artfully sliced, rolled, and assembled the sashimi platters, nigiri and rolls.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife, Yoshimi was stern and made us feel unwelcome from the get-go. She took orders and prepared the hot plates for the night. \n\nWhen ordering, we had asked her what was on the hot plate menu because it was written in Japanese. She told us there was Agedashi Tofu, Eggplant, Mushrooms and Steamed Clams. This didn't seem right as we saw more than 4 items listed on the Japanese menu.\n\nWe later saw Tuna Tataki and Hamachi Kama was also on the menu because a Chinese/Japanese speaking patron had ordered it. When we tried to order these two items, Yoshimi responded with, \"You have enough, wait later\" and walked away. When we tried to ask for more cold sake and tea, she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her.  \n\nSO WAS OUR MEAL AT TEKKA WORTH 4 HOURS OF MY LIFE? NO.\n\nAlthough the sashimi and sushi were amazingly fresh, the hot plates were mediocre. \n\nAs far as service, I understand people have their bad days but Yoshimi's cold, disinterested, and rude behavior left a sour taste in my mouth especially after having spent $75/person.\n\nI rather go to Okina (similar authentic Mom and Pop sushi restaurant) instead where they take reservations and the service represents what true Japanese hospitality should be. \n\n3.5 STARS rounded to a generous 4 STARS. \n\nTIP: Bring a brown bagged a bottle of sake and drink in line.

Caste system for customers: if you're not a regular, you can't order anything regulars get and you get pushed to the back of the line (or can't get in). Sashimi and eel you could purchase yourself. Rice that was sour (too much vinegar) and mushy (overcooked). NOT worth the wait and NEVER going back.\n\n\nMy friend and I arrived at 7:20pm on a Friday night. We asked if there would be second seating and Yoshimi said yes, either at 8:30 or 9pm. The wait was fine because it was expected. A couple showed up a bit later and said they didn't make the first seating (even though they got there at 4:30pm) because people in front of them were saving extra spaces and some regulars made a 6 person reservation.\n\nNOTE: You cannot make reservations unless you are a regular.\n\nAround 8:30pm, a man showed up, waved Yoshimi over, and whispered something to her. He then proceeded to tell us every detail of what happens at Tekka, attempted to school us on sushi, and told us that you won't find ANY experience like Tekka. We soon understood why he said that.\n\nYoshimi came to do the door around 9pm, called him and his THREE friends in to sit at \"reserved\" seats. Then she came around to take our orders. I asked if there was omakase and she said no. My friend and I ordered the sashimi combo for two, negi hama roll, and two eel nigiri. The only other things on the menu were two other rolls, tuna, salmon, albacore, scallop, and mackerel nigiri.\n\nThen that regular and his friends were served two off menu appetizers. If there's no omakase, where did that come from?\n\nNOTE: You cannot order food off menu unless you are regular.\n\nThe sashimi platter finally made its way out after ~15 minutes. The portions were massive - 4 pieces each of tuna, salmon, albacore, and yellowtail, 2 pieces each of octopus, mackerel, and scallop PER PERSON - and each piece was huge. The fish quality was mediocre. By the time my friend and I were about half way done, we didn't want to see sashimi for weeks. It was a disgusting amount of food, but we finished it all.\n\nThe eel nigiri came out - I don't know how a previous reviewer could say it was \"orgasmic\" - and the skin was super chewy, they hadn't cut or cooked it properly and I'm pretty sure it was just a frozen packet. Ugh. And the rice was mushy and sour, Nobu couldn't even take the time to wrap the seaweed all the way around the nigiri! And the negi hama was horrible. Loosely wrapped, falling apart, even lower quality yellowtail than the sashimi, with frail, old green onions.\n\nBy this time, the other party had another two appetizers off menu as well as whatever sashimi they ordered. Then Nobu said \"KAMPAI!\" and cheers... JUST THE PARTY OF FOUR REGULARS. He ignored the rest of us.\n\nNOTE: You will be treated as second class customers unless you are a regular.\n\nWhen the other party of two asked Yoshimi what the regulars were eating, she said, \"oh, something special,\" and when they asked Yoshimi if they could order that, Yoshimi said, \"oh, no, because we already know what they like.\" Uhhh, okay.\n\nWhen my friend and I got up to leave, Nobu finally acknowledged us and said all cheerily, \"ARIGATO GOZAIMASU! GOODNIGHT!\" Too late. We're never going back. Why spend a bunch of money on mediocre fish, when you could just go buy your own and make higher quality rice yourself?\n\n\nMore on that regular: when we walked inside he cheerily said, \"Oh! You made it in!\" Ok yeah buddy, no thanks to you and cutting in front of us with your three guests - don't patronize us. He talked loudly about his friend working on big budget movies - we don't care dude. It was obvious he likes Tekka because he wants to feel special. And if this is the type of person that Nobu and Yoshimi cater to, well, that definitely makes me never want to go back.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Simple, fresh, and not a single \"signature roll\" drenched in a thousand mayonnaise-based sauces to be found.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday with a couple of friends- four of us total. Two of our party  were able to secure our spot several hours before the first seating, which turned out to be crucial as there are only 10 spots per seating (and in the entire restaurant in general). \n\n4 stars is because the quality of the fish, the portions, and the price are all amazing. \n\nDownsides are as follows:\n\n-Stick to only two people per party. We were able to sit comfortably with 4 people, but because of how small the restaurant is (it really is like sitting in someone's kitchen, but with a bar and a BeeGees VHS playing on a TV suspended from the ceiling) it felt uncomfortable talking above a very polite 'inside voice'. \n\n-Regulars are definitely given preferential treatment. We were there with another party of four who clearly came almost every week and knew the owners well. The owner/chef chatted with them for the majority of the meal which, combined with the size and feel of the space, felt like we were intruding on a family dinner.

Hmmmm.. yes and no.\n\nI hate waiting, and I WAS warned that Tekka is a wait. After a failed attempt  where we arrived at 6:15pm (which resulted with us both stomping away repeatedly dropping F bombs all night long as we dined elsewhere) for the 7:30pm seating we both resolved to arrive earlier.\n\n2 seatings a night : 7:30pm and 9:30pm. Each seating is 11 people.\n\nIf you want to make the 7:30pm seating, haul ass from work and make sure you're in line well before 6pm. Actually, plan on getting there between 5:30-5:45pm. Reason why I say this is because although you may see only 1 or 2 people in line, they're holding spots for numerous others. Once that 11th spot is filled, you will be told so by others in line. Don't even insist on standing around waiting because you won't get seated. Come back later. \n\nAlthough 7:30pm is the 1st seating, you technically won't eat until probably 8pm. Nobusan arrived somewhere around 7:15, let us in around 7:30pm and then he had to prep his fish. \n\nI stood in line from 5:45pm and didn't eat until 8pm. Prior to that, I hadn't eaten since noon. I was FAMISHED. How do you remedy this? Carry a fcking protein bar in your purse or some shit! Brown bag it too, because it can be cold and windy in the Richmond (duh).\n\nWhen you do order, know that there is no real menu. You can order from whatever he has that day. You will note it on a whiteboard.

The thing about Tekka is... HUGE CUTS. Is it worth your money? Yes. But this also makes it harder to eat. I really didn't like how huge the cuts are (yes I am complaining and yes I am Chinese) regardless of how fresh the fish was because nigiri is meant to be small and bite sized. These nigiri are like the length of your iphone and half the width.

Did I wait 1 1/2 hours to get in? Yes. Was it worth every minute? YES!!!!\n\nThere is almost a cultish following for this place where only 11 seats are available per sitting. The owner walks up the line and count 1, 2, 3, ...11, and no more! I fortunately was number 11! I felt like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory when he won his golden ticket! The faces of the people who waited 1 1/4 hours was so depressing. It was as if someone told them that there was no more fish in the world when the owner tells them to come back at 9:30 or another day. \n\nI think they generally seat at 7:00pm but they opened late and we were seated at 7:30pm. \n\nWhen people say don't come with a group bigger than 3 people you should listen. They only have 1 side table that can fit 3 people and the bar sits the other 8. \n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Sashimi Combo - The only thing you really need to order. A giant giant platter of ridiculously fresh sashimi cut and prepared right in front of you. They are GENEROUS... VERY VERY GENEROUS. Ideally I would have had them cut the pieces into smaller slices since it's sort of hard to eat but I was able to break it apart with my chopsticks so not too bad. The platter is $48 and any other place this should have been well over $100. When I say big i mean BIG pieces.\n\n\n2. Hamachi Kama (try to get the big one if you can. they tend to sell out of those quickly).\n\n3. They have an assortment of rolls that I tried. They were good but since I couldn't take a  photo I don't even remember. They were affordable around $10 each. I'm not that big of a roll person so it wasn't really for me.\n\n4. They have separate nagiri pieces and I got the albacore tuna and another fish that I can't recall the name of -- GIANT GIANT GIANT pieces. I even wished I had a little bit of more rice to offset the fish. I can't complain though because each order came with 2 giant pieces and it was less than $10 each. YUMMMY!!!!\n\n5. Fresh wasabi! Definitely not the stuff that comes in jars or tubes you buy at home. It didn't feel like as spicy as the regular stuff which was a nice compliment. Loved it!\n\n\nKeep drinkg tea. I drank probably a whole pot by myself. The waitress or wife came out filling up tea cups and checking up on us. \n\n\nI think on top of the amazing food the most mesmerizing part of the meal was just watching the chef take out giant fish filet, measure it, cut it, and his attention to detail and making sure everything is uniform. An extra piece of tuna that didn't match the other slices wasn't just thrown onto a place but thrown away and another filer was brought out to make sure a new piece could be cut. I spent 2 hours in that restaurant and I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nSo, long story short, go to Tekka if it's the last meal you have in the city. Definitely a sushi lovers paradise (if you can get in).", "author": "Linda L."}

Remember to dress warm because c'mon now, it's night-time in SF, charge your phone so you'll have something to do while waiting an hour+ in line, chit-chat with some friends or make friends in line and then before you know it, it'll be time to get seated!\n\nBecause we were a party of three and everyone else was only in twos, we were directed to sit on the separate table in the little corner instead of at the bar. I was a bit sad because I wanted to watch Nobu work his magic. Oh well, there's always next time! At first I was a bit intimidated by the wife (who is always the waitress) as she seemed cold and not too friendly, but for most cases, when you are kind to people, they become kind to you as well, so after a few \"thank you\"'s and smiles, she definitely warmed up and became more friendly. \n\nIt was good that one of my friends had been here before or else we might've ended up ordering too much food. We (almost) had the perfect amount.\n\nThe three of us shared the sashimi combo (~$40). \nOh this is definitely a must get. It comes with about eight different types of fish and five+ slices for each. Just this order alone almost filled me up and it was split between the three of us. Very good price for the quantity AND quality. My favorites were the albacore, scallop, and hamachi. \n\nWe also each ordered four different nigiris.\nI had the scallop, salmon, albacore, and tuna.

I almost couldn't eat my last nigiri because I was so full already. \n\nThe scallop deserves its own little section. OMGOSH. Get the scallop nigiri. It's already included in the sashimi combo plate but it's so worth it to get the nigiri too. The scallop was definitely the star of the night for me. Yum!! I would come back just for it hehe.\n\nThe food at Tekka deserves five stars, but I subtracted one because I feel that it's just a big hassle to eat here. It's not somewhere you can just decide to go eat at on a whim. You have to get there early, bring tons of cash, and obey their rules. If you're down for all that though, I highly recommend this place. It's a place that all sashimi lovers should try at least once.", "author": "Judith L."}

It was absolutely DELICIOUS. It has A LOT of fish and they were all fresh and came in thick cuts. The best part is watching him cut the fish in front of you.\n\n-Hamachi kama (small size). It was really good, perfectly seasoned. We saw another customer order the large size and it was HUGE. ($14.50)\n\n-Lastly we got 2pc hamachi nigiri and 2pc salmon nigiri. They're 3.50 EACH PC, but they are really big. They come in really thick cuts so it's pretty worth it.

Sushi is never a cheap meal. That means you're walking around SF with a wad of cash in your pocket. Not the brightest idea.\n-This is not traditional sushi. The sashimi is not cut into perfect, even slices; in fact it's a bit too thick. The nigiri is humongous and can easily be 3-4 bites when nigiri should be only one bite. The rolls are not rolled with a bamboo sheet so they fall apart when you pick up a piece with your chopsticks. \n\nBut I have to give this place 4 stars because we had an enjoyable meal.

Ton of fish and not that much rice. \n\nLikeI mentioned, the experience makes te food so much better. The wait leads to Nobu-san's almost celebrity-like appearance at 6:50pm.

Our party of 3 arrived at around 5:30pm for their first seating, but there was already a good 11 people ahead of us (some even brought their own lawn chairs to sit on) so we ended up waiting in the cold for 3 hours or so for their second seating which was around 9pm. I was getting a bit irritated and wanted to suggest finding another place to eat, but I'm so glad I didn't!\n\nSERVICE was great! When we got seated, the chef's wife immediately brought us hot hand towels and green tea to drink. We were a bit intimidated by the atmosphere at first (felt like we were at our grandparent's house and had to be on our best behavior), but the chef and his wife were actually very sweet and nice. \n\nFOOD we ordered:\nSashimi Combo for 3\nNegihama roll\nSalmon nigiri\nScallop nigiri\nEel nigiri\n(There's a $20 minimum for each person).\n\nThe portion sizes were very generous; we almost got full off the sashimi combo. You can taste how fresh all the cuts of sashimi were because there was no fishy taste to it at all. Usually I don't like eating tako or ikura because of the tough and rubbery texture, but these actually tasted tender. The scallops were also very sweet and were melt-in-your-mouth goodness. AND THE EEL NIGIRI WAS JUST ORGASMIC.\n\nSince we were the last party we got to talk to the couple more about how we found out about their place and why we were here. When we were paying for our bill I was pleasantly surprised when they dimmed the lights and came out with a platter of cantaloupe with a candle singing me happy birthday.\n\nOverall, it was one of the best dinner experiences I've ever had. You can tell they put in a lot of effort to run such a notable restaurant. The amount of food and quality is definitely worth the price. Don't feel intimidated like we did!

My brother-in-law and I have tried to book some time to go for a while, and the time finally arrived.  There's always a line of people outside who must wait at least an hour before the open in order to get a seat.  When we arrived an hour early, there was already a line forming, and a sign outside that said there would only be 6 seats available for the evening's service.  Luckily we made it in under the wire and managed to get a coveted seat at the bar.\n\nWe decided to kick things off with a big bear and sake while we waited for our 1.5 orders of sashimi to be prepared.  The owner meticulously prepares each type of dish at the same time and it was about 45 minutes into the service that we finally got to enjoy the sashimi.  The pieces of fish were cut nice and thick, and were fresh as can be.  Each bite was divine!  Sadly he was out of uni for the evening, but even so, we absolutely enjoyed every bite of fish.  We followed the sashimi with a large order of their spectacular hamachi-kama, the grilled yellowtail collarbone.  Dusted with just the right amount of fine salt, the grilled tuna was unbelievable.  I've had this dish at many places, abut it was easily the best here.  It must be the salt or preparation technique, but it was simply awesome.  We decided to wrap up our meal with a few pieces of nigiri: yellowtail, salmon, and unagi.  Tekka's is known for their novelty-sized nigiri, and these were no exception.  I knew there was rice under the fish, but it was almost invisible because the slices of fish were so large.  However, each bite was memorable and delicious.\n\nBy the end of the meal, my bro-in-law and I were stuffed.  Service was very friendly and the experience was wonderful.  With everything included, the bill came out to about $75/person (cash only), which was pretty reasonable considering what a wonderful meal it was.

Hands down THE BEST Sushi I've had in my life thus far. If you want the freshest sushi on this side of the coast...you want to come check this spot out. It puts other sushi spots to shame. This is the epitome of what sushi should be. Portions are humungous, and literally melts in your mouth.

I waited about three hours (was planning on going later but didn't have anything better to do and I was advised to get there early). The restaurant has two seatings, one at 730 and one at 930. The place only fits about 15 people so if you aren't in line early enough, you won't get in.\n\nPRO TIP/ BIGGEST CON: THEY ONLY TAKE CASH (i'd recommend at least bringing 50$/person unless you are getting omakase which is 80$/person and minimum of 3 people) \nfurther tips: Come at least 2 hours ahead if you want guaranteed seating, if you are too lazy, try at least an hour beforehand\n\nanother tip: Also, they only seat a max party of 4 i believe unless memory mistakes me\n\nanyways, I was absolutely mind blown by the size of the sashimi there. I ordered the SASHIMI PLATTER (24$ a person) and the sushi was the size of an iphone and a copious amount, way more than any restaurant i've ever been to so far would give. It is basically a chef selection of sashimi (we got albacore tuna, squid, scallop, salmon, yellow tail, and mackerel along with delicious seaweed). All it tasted fresh and the flavor was exquisite. The squid had very nice texture and was my favorite part of the platter followed by the scallop.  For the price, this place is an absolute steal! You have to get this if you go here\n\nSecondly, I'd recommend getting individual sashimi depending on what they have. I've tried the uni, hotate, and unagi and I'd recommend all three if you can get them at any time (unagi and hotate are 3.50 each and the uni is 7 when they have it). The uni was rich and creamy, just how i like my uni. The unagi was deliciously salty and flavorful. The hotate has the nice sweet flavor I look for in scallop and the texture was nice.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this place. This has to be my favorite sushi spot now.", "author": "Dylan T."}

I was SO excited to finally try this place after hearing a bunch from my brother.\n\nThings I've heard prior to going: Cash only, 2 seatings on Mon-Thurs (7pm / 9:30pm), Fri I believe there's only 1 seating, no parties over 4, don't have time constraints, and you usually need to arrive by 6pm to secure your seat for the 7pm seating. If you arrive and count that there'd be more than 11ppl total, forget about it and try again next time.\n\nSo here's how things went down: Dropped off the bf at 6:30pm this past Wednesday (1/18/12) while I scrambled to try to find a parking spot. I was SO sure we wouldn't get in, but I receive a call from the bf saying there were only 4 ppl in line. Score! Oh boy, but parking was a pain in the *bleep* so get here a bit early! When I got to the restaurant, the place was pitch black since the owners had yet to arrive. I wanted to make sure we had a seat, so I asked each of the parties ahead of us how many they had in their party. Turns out there were only 8, so we'd be 10... YAY! WE WERE IN.\n\nThe owners arrived at 6:50pm and let us in at 7pm. Naturally, the other parties scrambled to sit at the bar since you get to be right in the action of fresh fish slicing and preparation. But whatever, we were happy to be there and settled for the side table they had. The menus are on the wall and basically just list the main fish they sell. BUT, there is a secret menu that you can probably find in other yelp reviews or through friends that have gone. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n- Sashimi Combo ($35): SO MUCH FRESH FISH! There were about 6-8 different types of fish on this plate and about 3-5 pieces of each one! Ones I remember were scallop, tuna, salmon, hamachi, squid, and a couple others. Everything was super fresh... most memorable ones being the scallop, tuna, and salmon. Yum!\n\n- Clam Miso Soup (not on the menu!): This was DELISH. Super fresh clams (there were about like 8 of them!) within refreshing miso soup. Perfect for the cold day we went on.\n\n- Variety of Nigiri (most cost $3.50, but uni was $5): OMGeeeez. Each nigiri slice is almost the size of a small asian girl's hand. How would I know? Cause I'm a small asian girl. But for a piece of fish, if you can't imagine, it's HUGE. We ordered 2 scallops, 1 unagi, 1 salmon, 1 hamachi, and 1 uni. The unagi was AMAZING. Uni was surprisingly good considering I don't usually like uni. Everything else we had already eaten on the sashimi combo plate, but it was still delicious. (TIP: The sashimi combo platter includes almost all, if not all, of the nigiri they sell individually. We did not know this. So there's no need to order extra nigiri unless you just really loved a particular fish.)\n\nEverything considered plus tip, we came out paying $85 for 2 people and left around 9:00pm. But we definitely were n00bs and WAY OVER-ORDERED. I felt so bad because we weren't able to finish every single piece of sashimi we ordered... unlike the other patrons who clearly looked like Tekka veterans and cleaned off every single thing on their plates. We definitely could've been really full and done with just the sashimi combo + miso soup.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience here, and everything was super fresh and a great deal. I only give 4-stars because certain fishes were better than others (hamachi, usually my fave fish, was not the best I've had), and it's kinda stressful/tiring having to ensure you get here super early to secure your spot. But next time I come here, I'm not going to over order like a n00b and I'll probably just get some delicious tuna, salmon, scallop, UNAGI, and clam miso soup.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I luckily stumbled upon it halloween night and no one was in there except one other couple. i was actually planning to go to Sushi Bistro down the block when I found parking right in front of Tekka. I heard great things and with no wait I thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm very glad I did. What a little neighborhood gem =O)\n\nFirst, so there is no surprises, don't expect a menu. There is just a chalkboard with the sushi of the day, and some items written in Japanese that is more of the cooked traditional stuff that the wifey makes in the back. The husband, who apparently loves 80's music and Tina Turner, is the one and only sushi chef. His wife is the cook/waitress. With just the two of them I see why they only have such limited seating... the two of them as the restaurants manpower and dining area equivalent to the size of my living room.\n\nBut with all that aside... what we are all after is the quality of food. And I must say it does not disappoint! All the fish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The portions of the fish were huge!! Probably the hugest I've ever seen... and best part, it was oh so fresh. Melt in your mouth fresh!! \n\nFrom chatting with the owner... there are two rounds of seatings. one around 7 and one around 9. The menu is made to be small and half of it is written in japanese. His reason? Because it creates a fun dining atmosphere, creating a friendy conversation starter with the patrons next to you. Because the restaurant is actually so small, the success comes from word of mouth advertising. People love to discuss what are the \"hot items\" to order with each other. That was apparent as I made friends with the couple next to us. I guess that's a part of the Tekka experience!\n\nI want to give Tekka a 5 stars overall but just because it has the weirdest hours, finding a time to eat here is a challenge... and because of that I give it a 4-1/2.\n\nPS.

Chef Nobu where's his kimono and bandana, his sushi case seems to be made of it of either wood or bamboo unlike glass like all the other ones I've seen.  They don't hand you any menus.  The menus are on a board against the wall.  I felt like I was in a house in a Japanese village, when I was really in a highly populated major city.  \nI LOVED IT!\n\nRESTAURANT RULES:\n\n1) No reservations.\n\n2) Cash only\n\n3) Closed on Weekends\n\n4) There are 2 seatings at 7PM and 9:30PM\n\n5) On Friday there the second seating is already reserved, so don't bother going if you miss the 7PM seating.\n\n6) For the first seating they're scheduled to open at 7PM, but they might open as late as 7:30PM\n\n7) They seat 11 people, and do not allow groups of 4 or more.\n\n8) If the sign says \"Sorry, only 6 seats available tonight\" then that means that Nobu invited 6 of his friends, so be sure to be one of the first 5 to get in otherwise they won't let you in.  If you see other people in line then ask them how many people are in their party just in case they are holding spots for others.  You can see a photo of that sign at:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tekka-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?filter_by_userid=True&select=a4PGxgM61WoX0Vaav8wurQ&userid=xYgBSUvVSU4RQlwqMtr6cA#a4PGxgM61WoX0Vaav8wurQ\n\n9) They give omakase only to the first 4 customers (or at least when I was there), but only order it if you're very hungry because it was way too much food for me, and I'm a big man with a big appetite too.  I must have eaten about 2 pounds of fish, and there is no take out over there, so they expect you to finish it all.\n\n\nMY SUGGESTIONS:\n\n1) Show up AT LEAST 1 hour early to make sure you get a spot.  I showed up at 5:35PM and I noticed that people started showing up at 6PM.\n\n2)  If  there are already people there before then ask them if there is anyone else in their party because they could be looking for parking or be running late.\n\n3)  There is nowhere to sit, so I hope you don't mind standing the whole time, or maybe bring something small and soft to sit on the concrete floor with.\n\n4) Remember this is OLD FASHIONED AUTHENTIC SUSHI AND JAPANESE HOT PLATE FOOD.  That means NO TERIYAKI, NO SPECIALTY ROLLS SUCH AS DRAGON ROLL, SPIDER ROLL, RAINBOW ROLL, CALIFORNIA ROLL, ETC.  If you do want all that variety then I would suggest going to Yuubi on 501 Balboa (about 9 doors down).\n\n5) You can look at their house rules ahead of time at:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tekka-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=ZaaZ6LwEAjwI-3BvuKqkUw#3LBWgm5nmOPRibDLIwYlWw\n\n6) Tekka might be difficult to locate because it's more hidden out.

Two seatings only (6:30/8:30pm, 10 each), unless you're first in line, make sure you ask the people in front of you if they are holding spots for others. Try to make the first seating so you don't have to chance running out of anything they have. So many caveats to this place right? Oh yes and minimum of $20-25pp?? Their sushi combo is big and can be shared, they can also scale it for the number of people in your party so you don't have two huge orders. Bring cash, good company, and an appetite.

It's the experience that makes this place somewhat magical. \n\nBy experience, I don't mean attentive customer service (actually quite the opposite sometimes) or a luxurious meal.  What makes this place special is the atmosphere. It's cozy. A one man and wife operation. Seated at the bar, you get to watch in anticipation as the chef starts to prep your meal. \n\nGenerally the customers are friendly. It's especially fun when you get to talk to some of the kooky regulars who have been coming for years.   \n\nSome pro tips: \n1. They only seat twice a day Monday-Thursday (apparently Fridays are for regulars or private parties only), once at 7PM and once at 9PM. There are only 10-12 seats available per seating so go EARLY. I recommend getting there by 6 to get 7 PM seating. I've had less trouble getting in for the 9PM seating. Usually getting there by 8:40 will guarantee you a seat. \n2. They will not seat a party larger than 4. I recommend going with just 1 or 2 friends anyways. It's more of an intimate experience anyways. \n3. Order the sashimi platter. It's big enough to feed two people. Add a nigiri or two and some other small dishes and you should be very full. \n4. The fish on the nigiri are HUGE. The size of your iphone - no, I'm not exaggerating.  \n5. Be social! The friendly regulars usually get some extra special love and dishes from the chef, and they are sometimes happy to share if you strike-up a good conversation.  \n6.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-21", "description": "I have been to Tekka 3 times now and can say with absolute certainty that it is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city. \n\nTekka is a no bells and whistles sushi place-- no fancy atmosphere, no pseudo-modern fusion rolls, no questions. It only seats 10 people, one group at 7pm and one group at 9:30. If you're late for the 7pm seating, don't hover by the window waiting to get seated before 9, it's not going to happen.\n\nThe place is run by a sweet old Japanese couple who do what they love and don't need customers or disgruntled Yelpers telling them how to do it; hence the sushi-nazi reputation. Order the sashimi combo (you only need 1, it probably feeds 3 people) and eat what's put in front of you. The sheer amount of food is the only inauthentic thing about this place; I've never seen a Japanese restaurant so willing to serve such huge portions of quality fish. You are guaranteed to pay a lot more and receive a lot less at other sushi restaurants, so really take your time and savor the amount of food that you're getting. \n\nDefinitely order the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar). She'll ask you if you want a small or a large-- get the small, it's enough for 2 people. It's cooked to perfection and it's not too oily or salty. Sprinkle a bit of lemon on top, it doesn't really need soy sauce.\n\nOther things I've tried that are good are the shiitake mushrooms with asparagus and shishito peppers. The negi hama (green onion and yellowtail) and the spicy tuna rolls are also good, but really are quite large and more filling because they use a lot of rice, so be warned if you order the sashimi combo that you'll probably only need one more roll after that.\n\nA Tina Turner or Neil Diamond concert DVD will probably be on the TV behind the bar, so that's basically a guarantee that you'll be eating in an interesting atmosphere. Sit back, chat with the 8 other people in the restaurant, and bask in the relaxing and extremely fulfilling experience that is eating at Tekka.", "author": "Kate M."}

We happened to have time to kill the next day and we showed up at 6pm. I will say, we lucked out and waited in line with a couple who considered themselves \"almost\" regulars. \n\nThere was a sign that said \"Only 6 seats. Thank you.\" and we were #3 &4. We joined the couple for some wine outside and chatted about the place. At 7pm they husband and wife showed. Everyone is really on point about the husband chef being a jolly kind man and the wife very blunt and rather sour. Honestly, I have family like her, she just a no-fuss lady, but she is sweet. Their guests showed at 7:05ish and we were all let in. \n\nThe very nice couple suggested we get the asparagus with bonito flakes. We ordered that, with a side of grilled veggies and one sashimi plate. \n\nThe fish cuts were huge!!! My favorite was the scallop, I thought I had eaten fresh scallop before, but eating their proved me wrong. It tasted so fresh, clean, and damn near melted in my mouth. \n\neveryone's advice is on point: show up between 5-6pm (honestly don't bother for 9pm unless you're willing to stroll by and check), the wife is just no-fuss, she's not mean, but she is quick so try not to get flustered. Be willing to drop $50 per person, min. \n\nOur meal, with a bottle of sake came to $110(?) I think. \n\nIt's deff an experence to do!!!", "author": "Hisaye K."}

The night I finally went to Tekka, I was the last person to be let in, after waiting for 45 minutes outside.\n\nThey were out of omakase by the time the owner got to our table, which turned out to be just fine.  We ordered an agedashi tofu, a platter of sashimi, an order of hamachi nigiri and one of sake nigiri, and two large sakes.  The total tab came to $84, which was exceptionally fair, considering the cut and quality of fish we received.\n\nThe female owner was very sweet and attentive, and the male sushi chef was quite a character.  I didn't hear him utter a word throughout the entire dinner, but he had on a video of a live Neil Diamond performance in Vegas, and occasionally he would glance back at the TV for a few moments and smile.\n\nI've eaten plenty of sushi in my day, and before this dinner, Blue Ribbon was my favorite sushi restaurant.  Tekka has effortlessly usurped that title.  Each piece of sashimi was at least three bites worth, and the nigiri about four bites.  Did I mention how fabulously FRESH it all was? I've never used so little soy sauce (its just not necessary at Tekka) and only once before have I gotten to the point where I absolutely could not have another bite of sushi.  \n\nIf you're patient and have good restaurant manners, go to Tekka.  It's worth the wait and the hype.", "author": "Nicole J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-07", "description": "First thing I have to say about Tekka sushi is that it is not actually $$$. I don't know why yelp says this, but it is definitely cheaply priced for sushi, especially because the portions are HUGE. \n\nMy girlfriend and I got there at like 6pm, but this was way too late to arrive for the 7:30 seating. We managed to kill time at safeway and got back in line right at 7:30. We were the only two people who got seated that night because the Chef has a usual group of people who go every Friday night.\n\nWe ordered the sashimi combo and the spicy tuna roll. The sashimi combo was SOO good. Every fish was great quality and tasted delicious! The salmon, however, was really disappointing, but all the other fish made up for it.\n\nSpicy tuna roll was not that great, but still good. It looked like he just added sriracha sauce to pieces of tuna. He also does not use a bamboo roller -- he just rolls it up himself. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for good, cheap sushi with an intimate and authentic atmosphere, then Tekka is the place to go. Here are some takeaways:\n\n1) Be prepped for a 2 hour wait. If you want to go to the 7:30 seating, get there by 5:30. If your'e going to 9:30, I think ~8pm is fine. 9:30 seating on Friday is already half reserved, so you better be the first in line if you want to eat that night.\n\n2) Sashimi combo is the most popular dish. \n\n3)The Omakase (chef's choice) wasn't available when I went, but I'm pretty sure you need to call in advance if you want to order that dish. It's like 3 or 4 dishes from what I saw from the other people in the restaurant - 1) asparagus with some sort of dippign sauce, 2)some pork dish, 3) mini sashimi combo dish, 4) baked salmon. \n\n4) Be prepped for an intimate setting. You're more than likely to talk to the other people in the restaurant.\n\n5) Cash only. Sucks, but it is what it is. \n\n6) Just one of my own notes: I think the Chef isn't doing this for crazy profits or to make a name for himself. He's doing it because he loves the craft of making sushi.", "author": "Robert Y."}

Yes, we're admitting defeat. I'm sure your sushi is, in fact, wonderful. And I have put up with some ridiculousness to eat good sushi. But all I can say in your case is wow, I'm almost impressed. \n\n1st try -- OK, so we ever so stupidly strolled in on a Friday at the time we wanted to eat because we didn't yet know your rules. Our bad! It was dead silent and your diners stared at us because they knew we had done wrong. Someone leaned over and whispered, \"they are all full.\" At first I thought we were getting snotty looks, but my friend said she felt like everyone just looked scared for us. Someone came out behind the counter and told us to come back after 9:30 pm.\n\nWe're suckers. We were intrigued. We also found all the rules on the wall pretty amusing. No forks and no weekends! No cash! No fun! (ok, I'm the one who added that last one) We decided to walk to one of the many other sushi restaurants within the same two blocks, eat a little bit and then come back. \n\n2nd try -- We again, ever so stupidly, returned around 9:30, when we were told to come back. Yes, I know now, we should have showed up about an hour before. And we also should have known that (according to Yelp reviews) the late night seating is reserved for a mysterious group of guests deemed special enough to eat at that time. Upon arriving, we saw the whole new group of people filling the restaurant (who were these people?). We stood outside and giggled at our misfortune without even going in. More stares (either scared or snobby, we're still not sure) at us from inside.\n\nWe returned to my house, a few blocks away, to tell my husband the story. He promptly made fun of us for our determination to go back. I'm not sure if our next attempt counts as a full try but we planned another Friday to go. But then we read that only special people get to do the late night seating and, since we obviously don't fit in that category and couldn't make it for the early seating that day, we made plans to try again.\n\n3rd (and final) try -- We were ready. We had read up and were prepared. We planned to go to the late night seating on Wednesday night and even had some snacks and wine before hand so we would be comfortable during the wait. We arrived by 8:30 and no one was outside. But it wasn't closed -- there were people in there still eating from the first seating. We were first in line! Success! No. No. We were wrong.\n\nSomeone came out with a big smile on their face and said, \"no 9:30 seating, people are coming back.\" People are coming back? Really? What does that mean? No, don't tell me. It means we're not welcome. I get it. Me, a journalist and former food reviewer and my friend, a scientist who works on curing neurodegenerative diseases, are pretty shifty looking.\n\nDefeated. We went to Sushi Bistro. Those nerds actually let us in AND served us sushi (same star rating as Tekka, by the way) AND were happy to take our money.\n\nSo there you go. Tekka, you are just too good for us. People who have eaten at Tekka -- be proud of yourself. You must have something we don't. Class, you are thinking? Yes, that's probably what you are thinking.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe peasants who attempted to enter your restaurant", "author": "Fanny S."}

No signs, no biz hours... This is insane!  I was determined to try this reclusive neighborhood gem!  I made sure I got there way before the seating time of 7:30.  The sign of \"only 6 seats\" on the door didn't matter since I was the first one there!  Yes!! Luckily Nobu san showed up on time and we were seated promptly before 7:30.  Indeed, his guests arrived out of nowhere as soon as he opened the restaurant to occupy the rest of the tiny space that seats only 11!\n\nDarn, no omakase was offered on Friday. Sadness...but ordered the usual that other yelpers recommended: sashimi combo, uni, scallop, hamachi kama.  Sashimi combo consisted of thick various cuts that were fresh.  Scallop just melts in your mouth.  Uni with a bit of soy sauce was heaven!  For the amount of food, I think the price is within range.  I walked away feeling very satisfied.  \n\nIt's a five star food-wise but given how much you may have to wait, I would have to deduct one.  And it seems like Friday may not be a great day to come as he may have more of his own \"guests\" and omakase may not be offered.   I wouldn't attempt to try 9:30 seating since that seems a bit too late to be a proper dinner time, but maybe you'll have a slightly better luck with seating.  Make sure to have ample amount of cash.  Otherwise, you can get some out at a nearby Safeway.  It's definitely a neat place to try at least once if you're in the area!

The Unagi pieces were HUGE as well and well worth the price you pay for one piece. it was the size of a phone literally. The Negri Hama roll was also great along with any roll that's made. The rice to fish combo is not something that's common. You get much more fish than rice. Monk Fish Liver was also super fresh and tender. Everything you can tell was made fresh that day as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-01", "description": "After hearing all the rave and reading thru the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Tekka a try.  Prior to it, our favorite sushi joint has been Yume in Alameda.\n\nSince we had a friend from Sacto joining us, we wanted to make sure we get seating.  Therefore, we arrived early around 5:45 PM on monday per advise of fellow yelpers.  Needless to say, we were the first in line and thus GUARANTEED seating. By 6:30, the line was long enough that some of the people who showed up later left knowing that they will not get a seat.  The owners arrived early but did not open the door til 7 PM.  We had a somewhat of an expectations after reading rave reviews and having tried one of the best sushi in Yume.\n\nWe ordered Sashimi Combo, Hamachi Kama, Salmon & Hamachi Nigri, Salmon skin handroll, seared Tuna and 2 bottles of Sapporo.  The sashimi combo was a mixture of Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi, Scallop, Mackerel, and Squid.  All were pretty fresh and pretty good ... but nothing to rave about.  We then had Hamachi Kama ... which was DELICIOUS ... probably the best dish of the night.  It was juicy, tasty and crunchy.  It was followed by the nigiris that we ordered (salmon and tuna).  The pieces were indeed HUGE.  Each piece is $3.50 but was well worth it.  It is probably comparable to about 3 pieces of normal nigiris.  Aside from being HUGE pieces, the taste of the sushi were good but nothing that will make me say wow.  \n\nWe were then served seared Tuna ... it was BLAHHHH.  The seared tuna \"looked\" good as it was slightly seared with shreds of onions and ponzu sauce over it.  It took my wife one bite before she deferred the rest to us.  The taste was bland and the fish itself was \"stringy\" due to the veins.  I don't normally leave sashimi leftover ... but we were just unable to finish the plate.  It was that BLAND ...  We then had salmon skin hand rolls ... and it was another BLAH (less HHH).  Not much of a taste in it ... I think I make better and tastier salmon skin hand rolls.\n\nNow for the total price ... for 3 of us comes to about $180 (include tax and tips) which average to $60 per person.  In my opinion, the price wasn't bad at all for the amount of food that we got. BTW, it's CASH ONLY !!!\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed.  We drove from East Bay (one from Sacto) and waited close to 1.5 hr to try this supposedly \"awesome\" sushi/sashimi only to leave with such a forgetable impression.  There was nothing special about the choices of fish, nothing special about the taste nor the experience.  The only thing that sticks to me is the HUGE size of the fish.  I feel that any other \"normal\" sushi joint I've been to taste the same as the sushi here ... BUT without the 1.5 hr of wait.  \n\nDEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE DRIVE NOR THE WAIT to taste something that is so ordinary.  Nothing against fellow yelpers but those who have given this place a 5 stars definitely don't know what's a good sushi is ... I suggest they give YUME in Alameda a try ... and I assure you that you  would not come back to Tekka again.", "author": "Sam T."}

After all my expeditions to Urasawa (LA) and Sawa (Sunnyvale), how in the world did this place slip through my fingers? First I must say it was a pretty epic experience, and although I recall using the word epic in my last review, I must say if there is an appropriate time to use it, it would be here.\n\nThis place opens at 7:00 PM, it's only Monday through Friday and if you want the omakase menu you must order at LEAST 10 days in advance. You can only call during business hours i.e. 7 pm and on week nights only to make reservations AND if you get there at 7:05, be forewarned .... you will not get in. \n\nThis place literally seats 10 people, no more and no less (as it is *always* packed) and has two \"sessions\" servings, one at 7:00 PM, and one at approximately 9:15-9:30 PM depending on when the first \"session\" finishes. If you get here around 6:30, yes there will be a 30 minute wait but at least you will get in. As you probably guessed, I got there at 7:05. And no, I did not get into the 7:00 PM serving and I am MORE than happy that this occurred by pure coincidence of major traffic to SF today .... because ... lets just say that the late crowd definitely has more fun. This is not an early bird event folks. \n\nSo basically ... killed 2 hours around the city, starving to death waiting for the 9:00 PM to roll around. Finally the last couple from the 7:00 PM session left and we were seated, casually, around 9:15 PM. I knew this was going to be a long meal but writing this review at 1:43 AM you know this *was* definitely. a long meal. This was no kick out at 9:30, this was the real deal. \n\nAt the beginning, I felt awkward, everyone else, and literally all 8 other people in the restaurant were friends of Noburu (sushi chef) whose face initially is a little intimidating when he does not smile (but little do you know he's the jolliest man ever!).

This is the kind of place I want in my neighborhood because I would TOTALLY come here on a weekly basis, if only to hear about stories of Japan and listen to Noburu's personal experiences. I'm not saying its better than an experience you would get at Urasawa or Sawa, but its definitely different, and definitely differently good. \n\nRecommended: \nAnkimo - made in-house each night\nEel - anything with eel in it here is just delicious from nigiri to rolls\nSashimi Combo - talk about Costco sized value for money\n\nand anything the chef will throw at you.

What can I say that the other Yelp reviewers haven't already said? Here are the basics:\n\nSeating/The wait: Used to fit 11, but now seems to seat only 10 (at most). It's close quarters but in a warm/friendly way, not a crammed into a Muni bus with smellies kind of way. No reservations obviously, but give yourself an hour and you'll probably get in.\n\nSushi: \n- Sashimi combo platter: good bang for your buck. Get tons of fresh sashimi for $35.\n- The Yellowtail nigiri was huge (iPhone-sized). \n- Spicy tuna roll: Now this is what I call a tuna roll. It was enormous and spicy - more reminiscent of Sriracha sauce than other spicy tuna rolls.\n- Eel + avocado roll: I didn't get this but looked a-ma-zing. Will get next time.\n\nHot plates:\n- Mushrooms with tofu - This was divine. Really scrumptious and light-tasting while flavorful.\n- Fried salmon skin - Eh this was OK. Tasty, but I'd pass next time.\n- Fried oysters - I didn't get this but will get next time! Won't be on the menu but you can ask for it.\n\nAsk them if they have anything fresh in the back and the hostess will tell you if there's anything new/seasonal you can order. \n\nIf you're looking for delicious creative rolls, don't come to Tekka. Go to Chin's on California and 7th. If you're craving sashimi, look no further.\n\nThe food is worth 5 stars but I'm giving the place 4 because the wait/difficulty of getting in + no credit cards is a pain in the ass.", "author": "Nami S."}

Personally, I'm turned off by over sized cuts of sashimi because I feel it takes away from the delicate nature of sashimi and the balance is overwhelmed by a filet mignon sized slab of fish that takes like 4 bites and ton of chewing to eat. \n\nI compare this place to Tomoe in NYC and if you like over sized cuts of fish, waiting for a long time and feeling like you got a good deal on sashimi, then you will like this place.", "author": "Alex P."}

Bf decided to take me here on a random monday night. No signs, no menu, no soda. Complete silence, only the conversation of the other couple next to us. We waited for 10 minutes without any service. hrm... no action in the kitchen too. Only the chef cutting the fins off the freshly bought tuna, and slowly wrapping them in paper wrappers for the rest of the day. \nThe finally hot tea came out. waited another 20 minutes, finally took our order. waited another 45 minutes, finally the food came out. (there were only 2 other customers with us at this time). \nFinally the wait is worthwhile. it is sashimi glaore.  I can tell you this, very fresh sashimi, steroid size portions.. (think 1 nigiri = 3 regular sashimi sizes), limited selection of fishes. \n\nAtmosphere: old, quiet, small, 10 seating, door opens at 7 pm ( at 7 the chef starts preparing the fish), ordering starts around 7:20-7:30. \n\nTiming: I would come here if you got a lot of time on your hands and dont mind getting served at snail pace, and eating at snail pace. \n\nFood: sashimi was very very fresh. Holy moly, why is the size so huge?! Each sashimi slice is the size of my palm alone. The hit of the night was the Eel nigiri. $3.00-$3.50 per one piece of nigiri. We ordered 5 nirgir per person, and the Eel/avacado roll,and that was enough to stuff us out of our minds! I actually recommend 3 nigiri per person and 1 roll to share, for 2 people to be sufficient. \n\nThe bill came out to be $50 ish for 2 people. Not bad, considering we were so full. Good place! definitely want to come back for the Uni.\n\ntip:  I have to say though, i dont think you want to bring your first date here. it's rather an odd atmosphere to be in silence for a good 1 hr and 15 minutes before you get any food served...", "author": "Juan C."}

I'm ok with that, it's just that the lady would get mad and irritated if I asked for something that they didn't have it. If they didn't want people to keep asking if they had this or that, then they should just write it down on their white board menu so they wouldn't be irritated. \n-their servings for sashimi and nigiri are FREAKING HUMUNGO- it's huge like the size of my hand.

Together we ordered sashimi platter (big enough for 2 people), and about 12 pieces of nigiri. I was only going to eat the sashimi so I asked for a bowl of rice to come with my order.

They were perfectly fried. Not (too) oily. Crispy on the outside, soft and tasty in the inside. The oysters didn't have the too strong of flavor that raw oysters tend to have, but still have oyster flavor. So the fried oysters are a great dish for the uninitiated.

And on the top of his list of things to eat (because that is how I plan trips, none of this touristy shit) was Tekka. And I'm glad I Yelp-stalked the place beforehand because there is no sign and it is a very unassuming storefront.\n\nWe arrived at 5:30pm, only because we caught an earlier bus than we were planning. Thank God we did. My friend and I walked over to the restaurant and the guy standing in front of us said that we were 9 and 10. (But wait, why are there only two other people in line?). The gal in the front of the line was saving spots for six people. The guy was saving a spot for his wife.\n\nSide note: I'm kind of a jerk, but I'm not an asshole. Saving a spot for one person, fine. For six? That seems ridiculous. Why don't you just say you're saving the whole restaurant and everyone else should come back after 9? That is moving beyond jerk territory. This isn't 3rd grade, don't save an entire row of seats at the lunch table for your BFFs.\n\n/endrant\n\nTwo people showed up behind us, theoretically 11 and 12... oh, wait, they wouldn't be able to get in because they were beyond #11. They argued with the gal who was saving seats for a busload of people. I feared for my life, the gal was very aggressive. I thought there was going to be a throwdown over the opportunity for some sashimi. The couple waited in line after us anyway, in the event that angryface's group didn't show up. During the wait, the guy of #11 and 12 went to the liquor store and returned with several small bottles of cheap wine. They proceeded to share said bottles of wine with my friend and I and I instantly converted to team #11 and 12 in the seating battle. They were rad folks. \n\nAround 7 or so, the owners pulled up and spent another 30 minutes prepping before we got let in. Angryface's group never showed so #11 and 12 got let in. I'm glad. We sat next to them and bonded over the fact that the sake carafe looks like a water bong.\n\nIn the restaurant it really is like sitting in this man's kitchen. Or kitchen closet. I think I have closets larger than the restaurant space. And it was very quiet except for our hushed chattering. But you get to watch him make everything right in front of you (literally), one by one.\n\nThe food, in summary, was the best fresh fish I've ever had. Fresh seafood in general. The octopus was outstanding. Fried salmon skin, A+. Scallops were bigger than half dollar coins. The nigiri was bigger than my palm. And the sashimi combo (duh, you should certainly get that) was fantastic. Everything on it, half of which I didn't even recognize. Nothing was the least bit fishy and everything was butter-smooth. Even the maki were amazing. Hands down best unagi/avacado roll. And the negi hama roll was something I've never experienced, but unbelievably amazing. Just... wow.\n\nFor two of us, we had a few drinks, a sashimi combo, two rolls, and three pieces of nigiri. We'd have been perfect without the nigiri. We were overly stuffed and left a few bites to spare. Stuffed to the gills, if we had any. The total was $90, which if you think about the sheer quantity of food we had, is totally affordable. And I'm a cheapass grad student, so affordable is my middle name (no, actually its cheapass). It was easily two meals worth of food for both of us. But hey, we didn't need breakfast the next morning.\n\nOh, and we didn't get out of there until 10pm. So... my advice? Go. Go early. Bring a Kindle or some cheap wine. Brown bag it. And go hungry. And... block out the rest of your evening for eating and then the illustrious food coma.", "author": "Kate C."}

There's no signage, no lights, nothing. Nobu brings fresh sashimi in every day, and will only serve fish he gets the same day. He arrives with his wife about 10 minutes prior to open to unload the sashimi and produce for the evening, and once he sells out, he sells out. There's usually only ONE hamachi and salmon kama each evening, so if you want it, get there early.\n\n Expect to wait a while if you don't get in when their doors first open. Tekka literally has 11 chairs to seat diners, and once the seats are all taken, Nobu will ask you to come back around 9pm. I suggest getting there about 20 minutes early just to secure your spot inside. \n\nEach order of nigiri is one piece, but if you compare it to your average japanese restaurant, its probably the equivalent of three... nigiri on steroids have never looked more appetizing, and sashimi has never tasted this good. \n\nDefinitely making reservations for omakase next time.", "author": "Judy L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-27", "description": "Hands down the best sashimi around....boom... there I said it!   Of all the sushi places I've been in my life, Tekka is really doing something different.  Their sashimi is so fresh and flavorful.  It looks so simple, but tastes so complex and that takes some serious skill.  They say the best test of a chef is to cook the perfect egg.  I think the best test of a sushi chef is in the preparation of sashimi.  It takes so much skill and care in securing the best possible ingredients, preparing and butchering them right and the courage and confidence to serve it naked on a plate. \n\nLOCATION\n\nTekka is almost impossible to find if you don't know what to look for.  Honestly, the first time I went there I couldn't find the place.  Before the restaurant opens, it is a blank looking storefront.  Once the restaurant opens the owner hangs the curtains (I know there is probably a name for it but I have no idea) over the front door to signify that its open.  Another thing to note about the restaurant is how small the place is.  They seat a dozen or so people and do a seating when they open and then another seating at 9ish... thats it!  Thats also why you really do need to line up if you want to get in during that first sitting.  Every time I've eaten here I have lined up at least 30-45 mins before the opening and I've never been the first one there!  Because of this you actually kind of bond with the other people in line (because there really isn't anything else to do).  The last time I was there I met a very nice couple from New York who also brought a large bottle of sake which they shared with everyone during dinner.  It was really nice and very much the vibe of the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE\n\nThere is a real charm to the restaurant.  It is run by a husband and wife team who really love what they do and it shows.  There is no set menu, just a chalk board with whatever they have to serve.  The husband is in front doing the sushi and the wife is in the back making everything else.  They are both super friendly and happy.  A couple times, the wife dropped off a dish or two you didn't order just because they want you to try it.  Also note that, neither of them is in a real hurry... about anything.  They only do two sittings for a reason, service isn't bad, but know that things come out at a measured pace.\n\nOVERALL \n\nWhen I think sashimi and hole in the wall I think Tekka.  While it isn't the best place for every occasion, whenever I want to treat myself to something special... Tekka is almost always at the top of my list.", "author": "Rob P."}

Yes, we are dedicated hardcore foodies. But we weren't the only ones who showed up early to wait! \n\nThe food was well worth it. Watching Nobu-san prep the sashimi platters was a mouthwateringly torturous process made tolerable by the fact that he is quite generous. The nigiri are huge (even a bit TOO big imho), and even the cooked foods were amazing.

In a nutshell:\n-Old Japanese couple are the only people who work here\n-Literally a HOLE in the wall - restaurant seats 7 people at the bar, and another table on the side for 2-3. Don't even think of coming here with a party bigger than 4.\n-Two seating times: 7 and 9pm. I've heard Friday nights are nearly impossible, so try to come in on any other weeknight if possible.\n-They serve very traditional, home-style Japanese cooking so don't come in here looking for crazy rolls and fusion dishes\n\nI can see how this experience can be a little off-putting and unexpected for some, but if you've come here to eat, it's probably because you've heard of it and have been forewarned on the etiquette here. I personally loved the whole experience of sitting in this cozy restaurant and having a kind of exclusive, personalized dining experience. It feels like sitting in your own home kitchen and having someone cook and serve you.\n\nI don't mean to echo what everyone else says about the cuts of fish here, but it is probably the thickest, freshest, tastiest cuts of fish I have ever had (I hate myself right now for typing this out at 2am, starving). If you find yourself confused and looking at a menu full of Japanese characters when you go inside, just trust me and order the sashimi combo - ours came with sake, maguro, scallop, HAMACHI AND TORO. There's enough fish for 2-3 people to share. \n\nOther items to order: unfortunately the hamachi kama was out that night, so she recommended the salmon collar kama which was also very tasty if you're looking for a hot dish. Their hot sake is also very good and strong.\n\nOne last note, for those of you who don't know, the restaurant actually does have a sign on their door that says \"tekka\", you just have to be able to read Japanese to know that. :)", "author": "Yuree N."}

No, you're not getting the upscale ambiance, but you're also not getting the ass-kissing and pretentiousness associated with nice restaurants.

I thought about giving them 4 Stars based on the food, but I decided to give them 5 Stars based on my fun experience there.  It's such a unique place where the chef and customers all come together in a small confined space and enjoy the evening together.  Also, Tekka is NOT for everyone, so think twice before heading over there.\n- Don't go there with more than 3 people.\n- Don't go to Tekka as your entry into Japanese food.\n\nI heard so much about Tekka (both from Yelpers and non-Yelpers) that I had to try it for myself, even though it's in the wrong side of the town for me.  Having heard about Tekka's '10 House Rules', I expected a mean 'oyaji (grumpy old man)' who will punish you if you don't finish your dishes.  Boy was I wrong --- place is run by a very nice couple.  Husband, who makes the sushi, wasn't strict at all.  In fact, he told me that a customer made the House Rules and gave it to the restaurant as a gift!  \n\nMENU: You are not handed a menu as the only menu in the restaurant is the white board on the wall.  Top half is the list of sushi items written only in English.  Bottom half is izakaya style 'bar food' written only in Japanese and no prices.  He told me he doesn't write it in English because 'it's troublesome.'  That's quite interesting, because it's not like this restaurant is filled with all Japanese customers.  He went on that most of the customers who frequent Tekka knows Japanese food and has no problems ordering even though they cannot read the menu.\n\nFOOD:  I hope the owners don't read this, because they are such nice people, but I have to be honest in Yelp.  Food here fits the place really well in that it enhances the fun experience here, but it's not super gourmet.  I could understand why someone would call Tekka their  'Favorite Japanese Restaurant in SF', but I cannot agree that Tekka offers the 'Best Japanese Food in SF.'  Tekka does not offer any interesting food or dishes offered only by a skilled chef with years of shugyo (rigorous spiritual discipline).  Most of their menu items are basic simple food, which they execute well.  I think they do this by design.  Restaurant is operated by wife and husband, so they don't want to offer complex dishes that requires lots of preparation time.  They want to carry a limited number of simple items and do them well --- which is a smart strategic decision.  Grilled shishito ($6) and grilled egg plant ($6) were both served in the proper way.  Hamachi-kama ($13.75) was salted just right and juicy.  Geso-hichimi (squid legs in spice) ($6.75) was made from good quality squid and seasoned perfectly.  Tuna yamakake ($8) used fresh tuna.    \n\nSUSHI:  Great value, because pieces are huge, which Chef admits as American Style.  Fish was fresh and tasty.  However, good nigiri is about balance, so if you want authentic Japanese style sushi, go to Ino Sushi(http://www.yelp.com/biz/dvpXnUsP0Gl0EYGtV_HcLQ) or Okina(http://www.yelp.com/biz/DpZYSh3CLj2A1B5jCVXvfw) instead.

We totally lucked out because the place only seats 11 people. \n\nThank goodness the people ahead of us knew what to ask for so we could listen in. If not for that, we wouldn't have known that there are hot dishes you could order from that's not written on the menu on the wall. There's stuff in Japanese below the English, but we never asked what it said. \n\nThe hot dishes we got: 1.Clams in hot sake - amazing, the clams were so good, and the broth was refreshing and nice. 2. Agedashi Eggplant - so freaking awesome. I would get this every time. The eggplant was cooked to a soft perfection and the thought of it now is totally making my mouth water...over a vegetable!\n\nMy husband and I also shared the Sashimi Combo which was intensely, eye-poppingly huge. The pieces he cuts are so big, and you get so much.  One order is enough for 2 people. The dish comes with a seaweed salad which I found soooo good. The best I've ever had in fact. \n\nWe also got a spicy tuna roll. I seem to always order this when I go to sushi restaurants and a majority of the time I always regret ordering it because it's so bad. But not this time. I should have watched what he was doing (but I was too busy eating) because this roll was sooo good and the pieces of spicy tuna were also huge. Every piece of fish just melts in your mouth and everything is so freakin fresh. \n\nWe were going to call that enough when we saw him making nigiri for the group of 4 next to us. HOLY CRAP they were the biggest pieces of nigiri I have ever seen. For $3.50 each, you can get a piece that's basically equivalent to 2 pieces. Pretty awesome and crazy when you see it and if you're like us, you end up ordering some more. We got 2 more nigiri pieces of salmon and one piece hamachi and 2 pieces of unagi. Hands down this is the best unagi ever and for sure when I come back I'll be getting more for sure.\n\nTekka is for sure the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to and I am a big sushi snob (I'm not afraid to admit it).

You can tell they hand-picked everything piece by piece, be it fish or vegetable or mushroom or other meat. They're all top quality in freshness. The fish was so fresh it melted in your mouth and all you felt was the sweet and savory taste of it. The lady's cooking was incredible. It was simple, but perfectly done. \n\nWhat I really can't stand is the sushi. For being known as sushi nazi, he doesn't handle his sushi very well. The size isn't really a problem for me as other people complained. Originally sushi was the size of people's hand, then later it was reduced to the size we see today. However, the chef was incredibly bad at handling his rice, which is REALLY important when it comes to sushi. Fresh fish isn't everything. Many sushi places in America get high rating as long as they have fresh fish and very little rice in the sushi, which is ridiculous. The rice has to be balanced with the fish. At this place the rice was way too little compared to the big piece of fish. Not only that, it was form into a ball messily and looks like a mess rather than a ball. The grains don't go in the same direction, and not firm enough, made it fell apart as soon as you grab on it.\n\nI found that the service isn't bad like everyone says. When I went there people talk normally, and take pictures normally. It wasn't nerve-wrecking or anything. The sushi chef and the lady were nice to us and recommend things we don't know.\n\nI'd definitely return. The hot food is very delicious. Also the price isn't that high. I think it's about as expensive as any other Japanese restaurants in the neighbourhood.", "author": "Bobo V."}

My friends, that time had come for me. I'm not talking about some celebrity chef dining experience. I'm talking about a true master, his knife, and his keen ability to handle the freshest ingredients that can only come with age.\n\nCould I handle it? In short, there was nothing elegant about my approach. The giant portions of sushi and sashimi served to me had belly-flopped every small morsel of so-called 'fresh fish' that I've ever had out of the water. I was like a grizzly bear ripping off the heads of wild salmon.\n\nAttempting to devouring these massive chunks of raw flesh became a strategy in itself. How do you savor every delectable bite when you're bursting at the seams? Do you save the best for last? Or do you eat the best immediately in fear that you won't be able to finish everything?\n\nIn the end, I ruthlessly murdered everything in front of me. The BEST EVER.

Then it was our turn.\n\nAfter perusing the wipe board menu, much of which was in Japanese (luckily we could read most of it), we went with the Sashimi Combo ($28.50) because it offered the greatest variety. All the nigiri sushi would have included one of the fish offered in the combo.\n\nSo we sipped our o-cha (green tea), listened/ watched the 60s/70s music videos of the Carpenters and other greatest hits, while Noburo sliced up big slabs of fish for us. There was albacore (uber buttery), aji aka spanish mackarel, tai or red snapper, hamachi (my fave), hotate or scallop, maguro or tuna, sake or salmon, tako or octopus, squid, seaweed salad, and sliced cucumbers. Most were 2 pieces per fish but maguro you get 4! It's a big plate - which I happily and greedily consumed. \n\nAnd you get a huge wad of fresh fresh wasabi. So different from the tubular green stuff. OMG. We were in heaven. Sweet buttery melt in your mouth fish. You could taste the freshness.\n\nNow this is the stuff I want all the time. I can see why Tekka has regulars. By 9:30p, all 11 seats were taken again. People know to come here.

The food is meticulously prepared and the counter seats are best for observing your plate being prepared.

I'm curious as to how people rate fresh and delicious sashimi. And to wait 2 hours just for that? Hm, I don't think so!  I had to try how GOOD their food was and if it's worth waiting for 2 hrs. My friend was there at 5:15 and we where had a party of 5 and was the last 5 for yesterday.  The couple got there around 6:30 to set up and etc...they don't give a crap if your outside in the freezing cold waiting for their door to open (they could have seated the first 10 while they were getting ready).  Got seated-3 of us in one table, 2 at the sushi bar. My big mouth blurted out \" what are you going to order\" to one of my friend that was sitting at the sushi bar, and the lady owner quickly said \"are you guys together? party of 5?\" AND the male owner (who hardly spoke the whole time!) blurted out \"what? are you guys really party of 5?\" I was like....uh...no, we just met outside, lol. How ridiculous. I think they were about to kick us out if we said we knew each other....how strange and rude. What if we really did meet outside??? Dumb rules and super super rude. They don't give a shit about what you think.\n\nSo the food: We ordered \"the most popular\" sashimi combo for $40. Came with way too many tuna (yes, cuz this is the cheapest!), octopus, scallop (this was delicious), hamachi, snow white, and 3 other fish. Sashimi tasted mushy, not all that fresh cuz it did not taste deliciously sweet. I just that the sashimi was just OK. nothing to rave about and wait for 2 hrs.  We also ordered the Hamachi Kama-small. I gotta give this one a two thumbs up. Very delicious, juicy, and tasty. No need for any sauce which other places provide.  Ordered the Monk Fish Liver- wow, this was good. I hate liver. But the way how they made this does not taste like liver at all. It was surprisingly good....one of the better plates besides the Hamachi Kama. Spicy tuna roll- presentation was ugly. Taste was just okay. Eel & Avocado- again presentation sucks but the eel was pretty meaty and tasty.  Asparagus and Mushroom was good too. We also ordered Salmon skin hand roll....we only at the salmon skin inside! The whole roll was tasteless.  Ordered 3 bottles of saki and 1 beer. total bill was about $165 without tips yet.   I will not wait for 2 hrs just to eat these kind of food.....NOT WORTH THE WAIT AT ALL!!!  I don't understand why people would wait that long just for that.....interesting....", "author": "Alyce l."}

I went there with my brother the first time and we couldn't get in because we were 11th and 12th in line.  We got there at 5pm and there were 8 people in line.  Turns out that the first person had two other friends waiting in their car that we didn't know about.  SO always ask each person about their party size, they only take 10 people. We waited until 7pm and the grumpy lady said NO no more.  Of course I knew it was our fault for not asking and wasted 2 hours standing in the cold.  So my brother and I decided to try one more time, which was today.\n\nBeing more responsible and prepared,  we went at 4pm.  I brought my foldable chair and homework for myself and my Ipad for my brother.  We waited until 6:30pm and no one was in line except for the two of us.  At 6:45pm 2 more parties came and then there were 7 people.  We went in at 7:10pm and waited another 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order.  We asked for two sashimi combo because we eat a lot, but the lady told us one was enough for the both of us.  Guess what? It wasn't.  We also ordered negi hama (green onions and yellowtail sushi), eel and avocado sushi, and spicy tuna sushi.\n\nThe chef makes all of the same orders at once, so be patient.  As I was watching the chef slice our sashimi, he didn't seem very consistent with the portions.  I can tell just from looking that some slices were bigger than others.  Someone asked if their scallops were fresh, the waitress said of course it's from Japan.  Honestly, whatever food that came this far, is not fresh.  Quality may be better, but I felt like the sashimi at Isobune tasted better.  Yes their slices of sashimi are big, but why does that matter when the taste of it tastes just like any other sashimi you get from other restaurants.  \n\nWhen I took the first bite, I gagged a little, looked at my brother, and told him,\"I think I taste that 'rain smell' water\".  He told me he couldn't taste it at all so I said, \"I guess it's the waitress' body odor when she walks by\". We killed the plate in 3 minutes while other parties took their time.  We waited another 15 minutes for our rolls to come.\n\nDuring the 15 minutes I watched the chefs' every move.  In his small sink, he plugged it and had maybe half a sink of water.  There's two towels (the type he wipes his board and knife with) soaking in that water.  Before he places the handful of ginger onto your plates, he would squeeze the excess ginger juice into that sink of water.  He then takes that towel that was soaking in that water, wrings it and wipes the cutting board where our food was prepared, table, and knives. Once he thinks that the towel is prettied soiled he would rinse it in the sink and all that dirty water goes back into that tub of water and repeats the same process here and there.  I whispered to my brother and said I think that's where that rain-smell taste is coming from.  \n\nThe chef starts rolling up the sushi rolls.  It was so messy that I thought he was a joke at one point.  I'M SURE they are really nice folks, but it seemed like I could've prepared and rolled it a thousand times better.  Yes, I know one of their rules said no complaining, but the way he prepared things was very amateur and unsanitary.  Where was I?  When he was done rolling the sushi, he would take the whole roll and WIPE that cutting board (covered with towel 'rain-smell' water) one more time before cutting and plating it.  You can also see how uneven the rice was distributed throughout the roll.  My brother and I were not looking forward to eating it even when we were going to pay for it.  He served all three rolls at one time to us.  I took the first bite of the yellowtail and WAM that taste of towel-rain-smell- water was in my mouth.  If you guys go and can't taste it, you gotta chew it first then breathe in from your nose, and you will DEFINITELY taste what I'm talking about.  I looked at my brother  with my big ol' eyes and he got scared.  He took a piece, tried it, and gagged.  He said,\"oh my god I taste it now\".  So after that first try, we gobbled down the 22 pieces left on the plates as fast as possible trying to hold our breaths and not taste that TASTE.  I threw on wasabi and and soy sauce all over to help me choke it down. \n\nOther than that dirty nasty taste,  the spicy tuna was not spicy,  the eel roll was covered in teriyaki sauced that was brushed on with an old dirty brush, and all the fish in the sushi rolls tasted the same as the sashimi served in the sashimi combo.  Not worth getting the rolls at all.  $44 for sashimi combo for two people and $9 for each roll.  Very decent price, but them being so dirty is scary.  My brother saw the kitchen in the back and said it is dirty as ****.\n\nI'm not telling you guys to not go.  I'm just telling you to be aware and choose wisely.

I was stoked, and excited because I could finally share  with my mother the great tasty sashimi that I had experienced in Japan. Knowing how hard it was to get a spot to eat here, I was committed to bring my mother and girlfriend. We arrived 2 hours early and were the first ones in line.\n\nWe sat down at 7:15PM, and upon ordering, we were shocked to find out that the Omakase was not available today which was a huge disappointment because we waited 2 hours just to try the Chef's choice. Okay fine, not a big deal, we came here for the sashimi anyways, so we ordered the sashimi combo, hamachi-kama (large), and 2 orders of nigiri for each of the following: eel, yellowtail, mackerel, scallop, tuna, salmon, and albacore. \n\nWhen we got our our sashimi combo, we were surprised to find out how big of a portion they gave us. The more the merrier! After the first bite of my maguro (tuna), I quickly realized this was the same type of sashimi I could get at any other restaurant in SF. But wait, it might have just been the maguro, so I tried the salmon, the ika, the makereel, and before I knew it, I tried every fish on the plate and none of it had \"the melt\". The scallop was good, but not the best. The yellow tail did have a very tiny melt, but it was very underwhelming and did not reflect the reviews. \n\nThe hamachi-kama was definitely amazing. It was crispy, juicy, tender, and just a little bit salty. It was very balanced and is the one thing I would recommend getting here.\n\nThe nigiris were strange. Generally, an order of nigiri has 2 pieces of sushi. At Tekka, they only serve 1 nigiri per order ($3.50). We ordered a lot, since we expected small portions. At Tekka, they give you steak size nigiris. The fish is ridiculously big and it's just overflowing and is suffocating the rice beneath it. At this point, I didn't even want to eat fish anymore. It was too much! Sushi should be bite size, especially nigiris!\n\nOverall, the fish was definitely fresh, but not as high quality as some reviewers say. None of the sashimi had \"the melt\", at least not significantly. This place definitely has more fresh fish than most sushi places that I have been to in SF, but considering the price and the amount of time for overhead, it's not worth it. Our bill came out to be ~$140 after tip. The price is definitely not proportional to the quality of fish. Also, my girlfriend had an upset stomach after eating here. One last thing, if you don't go there early, finding parking around there is going to be tough.\n\nTo be nice, maybe it was not one their better days since they didn't have the Omakase. I probably would never find out since I don't plan on going back. The amount of time (~4 hours) is just not worth it.", "author": "Douglas M."}

Sashimi was awesome.  Huge assortment of high quality close in options.  No exotic stuff, but with the size of the place you can't assume huge variety.  The big hit here is the Nigiri though that is as big as your hand.  They serve single piece orders, which are actually bigger than 2 pieces of typical Nigiri.  \n\nI know the purists out there will never bite their sushi, but believe it should be all in one bite.  This stuff is monster big - 5 bite slabs of ultra fresh product.  By far the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had in my 30 years of 3 times a week sushi eating.  That wins an award by me.

Let's see if I'm going to get seated...been meaning to come taste the delicious food and experience the place and say hi to the nice old couple that has been running the place for ages. Looking forward to a great Friday. I will have my review up soon after if I am lucky to get a seat! I heard its pretty difficult to get a seat..especially on a Friday.\n\nRight now...3 star since I am going in with an open mind and open wallet. Let's see what comes out of it!\\\\\n\n\n****FOLLOW UP\nI'm back! Just finished by meal at Tekka with my fiance...yup...we were lucky enough to get seats!\n\nFirst off, I have to say....it was one of the funnest and funniest nights that I can remember....good people, good food, good prices, great portions! = a very good experience.\n\nWe probably waited for about an hour and a half in the freezing weather...but you must be patient and you must be able to bare the wait!.. on the positive note...We had such a great time meeting some new people in line and just had a great experience (I have to say...these guys made the experience much much better than it could have been..thanks to Dana, Dominic, Cynthia, Amy & Derrek..we hope to see you guys there again soon...) got there early & waited waited waited....but guess what.....it was well worth it as we came at just the right time to be FIRST IN LINE!!!! We saw some others come and leave as they clearly understood that they were over capacity and would not be allowed in...and we also saw 2 people who waited and waited seeing that they were within capacity but to only find out from Nobu who informed them that \"No, too many\"  and had to turn around and leave....we were just glad as we were first and knew that we had our seats locked in! \n\nSo...first thing is DAMNNN...probably the biggest cuts of nigiri I've ever seen. Really....like one order of nigiri (which is once piece) is probably equivalent to 3 pieces of nigiri you get at your typical Japanese restaurants. The quality of the fish was super fresh...every bite was heavenly. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu...a much needed first time sample! I have to say...some of my favs for the night were the mackerel & uni.\n\nAgain...back to the experience...What it reminded me of was being back in elementary school again...back in class...back to being a kid again. We were all trying to be on our best behavior, not getting in trouble...afraid that we wouldn't get our delicious treats...it was such a funny fun time...and it was again thanks to the awesome group of people that were there.\n\nDishes we missed: salmon skin, oysters, & cod....but will definitely order that on the next trip! \n\nThe place is great but I wouldn't say that this is a 5 star place. I can't really explain it but Tekka is a different place and can't be compared really to any other place. For myself, it brought me back to my childhood, it felt like home, the fish was excellent but abnormally massive...its definitely not your typical sushi spot and if you can't see yourself waiting for 2 hours just to be rejected but willing to come back again to wait another 2 hours to get into this place than its not the place for YOU! Its definitely a level you must achieve first before coming here...and what level you may ask...well, you'll just know once you get there...no one can tell you....you will just KNOW. Coming here is like trying to get invited into someone's house to eat...you can't expect that they'll let you in...but you just hope they do.\n\nDecor - Old, very small, felt like a traditional japanese sushi spot\nPrices - Very fair - you definitely get what you pay for\nPeople - Great service, very nice people\nFood - Quality is great, large portions of nigiri, rice is a little on the mushy side\nPresentation - Picture yourself eating at someones house in japan\n\nTo summarize...come early, patience is virtue, bring a jacket, come in small pairs like 2 or 3 people max....prices are very fair...and did i say again...the cuts/portions of nigiri is humungggggus!! \n\nI would not recommend this place. Its a little gem that I would selfishly keep to myself! =P\n\nThank you NObu & Yoshimi! See you again soon.", "author": ".I I."}

My friend and her bf had been there before, and said that they would join us for dinner..but I had to get there early to line up. I decided to come here on friday and by the time we lined up it was 6:25. There was no one else in line...I thought that was odd - so I called my friend and she just said to line up. Sure enough by 6:30 Nobu and his wife shows up, and starts bring in the goods for that day. At 6:35 - a group of 5 people show up and waits behind us. Unfortunately there was already a reservation for 3 - so with the 4 of us - that was already 7 people. The restaurant only holds 10 people...so they actually left. Moral of this - get here early if you want to eat here. Otherwise you have to come back after 9:30!\n\nSo the restaurant officially opens at 7 and we sat by the bar where Nobu makes the sushi. The bar is actually the best place to sit (seats 7) because you get to watch the TV - which usually Jeopardy is on. After that - he plays a BeeGee's concert...which is great..because he jams to it. This is not your typical Japanese restaurant - its only run by 2 old people - and they move at their own pace. We watch as Nobu is slicing up the fresh fish and wrapping it in kelp paper - which he explained keeps the fish fresh. We order our food, and basically the whole experience is that you sit back and wait. If you want vegetables - you have to ask them what they have. On friday they had asparagus, shitake mushrooms, and peppers. \n\nWe ordered the sashimi plate - which had a fresh assortment of fish. We also ordered the asparagus and mushroom appetizer which was really tasty and super good. The salmon skin appetizer was also delicious! The spicy tuna roll and the hamachi with green onion roll (i forget what this is called) is absolutely delicious and filled with tons of fish. The nigiri sushi come with huge pieces of fish..and it was really delicious! \n\nOverall for really fresh and delicious fish you must try this place. This place is a little claustrophobic - because its just a small little hole in the wall restaurant. But it is clean and interesting and def. an experience. Don't come here if you do not have at least 3 hours for dining. And make note of the rules on the wall. It sounds scarier than it really is. Nobu was actually a really interesting person who was really nice. It can get really pricey here because only the nigiri prices are listed on the board. So I was pretty surprised when our check came. However, great sushi and fresh huge chunks of fish! Def. worth trying!", "author": "Betty S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-10", "description": "Best Sashimi I've had thus far, and that's saying a lot considering how often I indulge in sushi. \n\nThe biggest difference between their fish and others is the texture. Most places offer sashimi that comes off too dense, chewy, over chilled, and over priced. The sashimi platter here will run you $40 and is DEFINITELY worth it. The slices are are generous, with a buttery texture that melts slowly in your mouth, causing you to really enjoy and taste your food. Instead of being overly chilled in a refrigerator, it's served slightly below room temperature so that when it first touches your tongue you sense the flavor instead of the cold. \n\nSushi rice here is amazing as well. Perfectly seasoned and moist, not dry and lackluster. \n\nNot a place for generic mayo drenched rolls with no flavor. \n\n*Open weekdays, be sure to get in line by 6, they open at 7. Thurs, Fri come at 5:30\n*Restaurant only seats 10 people, so if you're number 11, come back at 9 for the second seating \n\nThey have their own rules and way of doing things, but if the food is amazing enough, nothing will deter me from coming back.", "author": "Victoria N."}

While the limited menu items change every so often, her dishes are usually well-prepared and consistent. It's basic Japanese comfort food fare like her nimono (stewed dishes) or simple, grilled fish dishes like hamachi kama that satisfy. Fried food is usually done well. Try the fried oysters- they're good.\r\n\r\nAs far as the sushi and sashimi go, I'm sorry to burst people's bubbles, but it's pretty amateurish relative to what you get at a real hole-in-the wall \"yatai\" or \"gaa-do-shita\" restaurant in Japan. In particular, Nobu's maki-sushi prep technique makes me cringe. It's literally primitive and ham-fisted. Maybe that's his American \"inaka-style\" sushi. The fish, while bountiful in terms of portion sizes, isn't always fresh. I've had some runny uni here which was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nI suppose people really pump up the rating to this joint because it's a hole in a wall restaurant that gives an air of exclusivity to hipsters \"in the know\" who can put up with the logistics of parking and finding seating in this uber-small restaurant.

I love raw fish and, having seen people lined up in front and read the many positive reviews, I had high expectations.\n\nHowever, my Sashimi-loving, Hawaiian-raised date and I were both disappointed.\n\nThe husband and wife who run Tekka were stand-offish and didn't answer questions.  When asked, they couldn't be bothered to describe or translate the Japanese-language items on the chalkboard.  I'd expect a proprietor to be pleased that an adventurous patron is interested in their food and would want to describe and share it, but that wasn't the case here.  She couldn't be bothered.\n\nThe fish--salmon, scallops, tuna, yellow tail, etc.-- was top quality.  But the self-taught sushi chef serves it in ridiculously large, obtuse chunks that are more suited for BBQ shish-kabobs than shashimi.  We sat at the sushi bar and watched in disbelief as he piled perhaps a pound of Grade A sashimi chunks on lettuce and then dumped salad dressing all over it.    At least we got to watch Jeopardy! on the portable TV while we were waiting.\n\nCertainly, if the proprietors want to abuse fine fish, ignore customers, fail to translate menus, etc. that's their prerogative.  But I'll go somewhere else and leave Tekka to the Nipponophile hipsters.\n\nIf you are still interested in visting, I'd suggest you review Tekka's silly little rules first--they're well-documented in other reivews.\n\nOr so I've been told.

The husband usually takes care of the sushi, sashimi, raw items, and the wife takes care of the cooked items.  And don't let the chef's old appearance fool you, his knief skill is out of this world.  The wife's \"home-style\" cooking is to die for, and you probably can't order it outside, I mean, home-cooking for reals.

You sit down and eat incredibly sashimi/nigiri.\n\nOne thing that I think some other Yelpers didn't mention is that, for the most part, this is a sashimi and nigiri place - the majority of dishes are simply a slab of raw fish or raw fish over rice. This is unlike other 'high end' sushi places which make a sushi concotion of different ingredients (think california roll, spider roll, etc). Sit down, eat, and then leave.

[wink]\r\n\r\nThis is sort of hard to explain, but Japanese Food, although not bad per say, just tastes different when you are not in Japan. It's some combination of the water, the shokuzai, or the lack of thick cigarette smoke choking up the air. I don't know, but anybody who has lived in Japan will tell you that it is just not the same, and even more likely, \"it's just better in Japan.\"\r\n\r\nSo, to me, i have yet to eat at a \"real\" Japanese restaurant outside of Japan. But, Tekka is one of those rare places that comes, really, really close. It's not just in the quality of the food, but it also actually _feels_ like a neighborhood restaurant. \r\n\r\nTekka is likely one of the city's mostly closely held secrets. Namely because, one...  it's tiny. You  can only seat perhaps ten people max. That's eight at the counter and two at the \"table\", which is more like an elevated foot rest. And.... two they take their sweet little time. There is no waiting to get in. If you don't make it in they pretty much tell you to go away. Luckily the crowd seems to flow in two spots, the 7pmish to 9pmish slot, and the 9pmish to the \"we are tired so go home already\" slot. So you have another chance if you miss the 7pm slot.\r\n\r\nTekka is 100% a wife and husband operation. The husband sits behind the bar and makes the quality of sushi that San Franciscans will be familiar with, save for the fact that his nigiri is unusual large in size. And if you point this out to him, he will say something to the effect of \"that's not large, I'll show you large\" and slap something down that won't even fit into your mouth. \r\n\r\nThe sushi, though quite good, is greatly out-shined by the wife's OUTSTANDING Japanese homecooking-style dishes. If i understand correctly, every day the wife and husband going shopping together, see what looks good, and think up the menu on the spot.\r\n\r\nThat menu is then scrawled on a white-board that hangs on the wall. It is, of course in Japanese, and if i recall correctly there are no prices. Don't be shy if you don't speak Japanese, just ask them to make you something good. You won't be disappointed. I have seen some people simple indicate the amount they want by raising both hands into the air and adjusting the space of between... \"about _this_ much\". \"Okay!\" shouts the husband.\r\n\r\nYeah... Tekka is the kind of place where you find yourself drinking nihonshu (sake) with the husband at the end of the night and laughing yourself silly over the company of good friends and great food, in a warm, homely environment.

If I weren't eating with my mom, I would've loved to stay a little longer to chat with the old man to hear more about him.\n\nI think I'd give the place five stars even if the food was awful.

I've always had a secret desire to take one of those chunks of sushi quality fish and just take a huge bite out of it, and the huge pieces of sashimi that we were served just about fulfilled that fantasy.  I mean, these things are big, like texas big.  So yah, that's a lot of fish.  Yum.  Everything was fresh and tasty, and it was a very un-busy night (there were about 4 seats open the whole time we were there), so the whole restaurant had a good time chatting with the sushi chef, and with each other..  \n\nSo yah, we had a really nice time in an un-crowded restaurant, but I can imagine if this place were busy that maybe the dude wouldn't be as friendly or chatty, so I'd say.. if it's cold and rainy out.. brave the weather and go check it out.", "author": "Dennis Y."}

We made it into probably one of the hardest 11 seat restaurant in San Francisco.  The restaurant's decor transports you to a time forgotten place where photos of old Japan abound.  Behind the chef are memorabilia of his passion for golf.  A small TV adorns the wall which later provided the patrons entertainment from Neal Diamond.  This would break the tension and the mood for the night.\n\nEnough about that...Our orders consisted of the Sashimi combo, the limited 3 sushi rolls available, the coveted Hamachi Kama as many have written on Yelp, and two vegetable dishes (mushroom with asparagus & grilled Shishito Peppers).  The Sashimi is FRESH and HUGE and more than enough food to share between two people.  We loved the Hokkaido scallops the most but everything is good.  Next came the Kama.  The fish is grilled to perfection with a hint of salt.  The flesh is moist and well worth the price of $15.  Our disappointment came with the sushi rolls.  The rice unfortunately was over cooked, overly vinegary, and detracted from the fresh fish that went into it.\n\nOverall, 1 * for the price, 1 * for the sashimi, 1 * for the cooked food, 1 * for the exclusivity, 1 * for transporting diners to a time long forgotten, but - 1 1/2 * for crappy sushi rice.  I would go back only if I am not waiting for hours to get in and will probably order the Sashimi, a few cooked dishes and leave happy.", "author": "E L."}

The sushi chef (Yes, the only one ) kicked us out because we were talking about PROP 8.  He asked us to leave and told us that we should not come back to this restaurant.  \n\nAfter two large sakes (not to mention $180.00 later) I was in awe with his reaction given that I have been there a number of times. I had taken my friends.  who were visiting from out of state who were more embarassed fo me for considering this one of my favorite joints, who were equally in shocked for the seemingly less-than-tolerant attitude from a SFcan business owner toward gay people.  Frankly, the numerous times I have been here,when I never said anything while eating his food, were quite pleasant.  And today quite frankly brought everything in perspective.  \n\nIf you are not conservative and not live in the Richmond, I would recommend SHIMO on 2339 Clement Street who has much better fish than Tekka.  You will get much better fish and much  up-to-the-century service from the owners.  Tekka's only redeeming value is the size of the fish they serve.   Oyaji's turn-of-the-century attitude towards diners leaves the Richmond folks a lot to cheer about.  For those who don't live there, there are so many alternatives around.  Go to other places who will appreciate your business.", "author": "Lynn B."}

Tekka has quite the loyal following.  We arrived at 6 p.m., i.e. one hour before open, and was barely the last group admitted (seats 10-12) in line.  A huge THANK YOU to those in line in front of us who squeezed at the bar so we could stay and enjoy the Tekka dining experience!!!\n\nSeveral other parties stopped by soon after I got in line and were turned away by us, the people waiting in line.  I really liked that it's a cozy little place though.  Got to talk to some of the others waiting in line.  Everyone was very friendly.  The food was yummy and definitely \"fresh and good\"!!  I also enjoyed the Japanese couple that run the restaurant.  \n\nIt is cash only, and we only had enough $ to enjoy the sushi and a few dishes that night (although that was plenty of food to fill us up).  Must try the omakase ($55/person) next time.  It looked really, really good!", "author": "Christine C."}

Not having a name on the door, you would have to \"be in the know\" to know about this place. So after more than 6 months of living in the 'hood I was finally able to try Tekka (I typically eat out on the weekends and this place is closed Sat & Sun). \n\nAfter convincing my friend to stand outside for 15 mins (not the longest people have waited, I get that, but it was about 40 degrees out there) we were finally let in, with the other 8 people, at about 5 after 7 for the \"first seating\".  There are clearly rules to this place (they are posted in the window as well as inside) as well as etiquitte. This having been my first time, I felt really nervous and actually a bit like Jerry with the soup nazi. But we were seated by a very nice lady (I presume to be the wife) and were provided a warm towel - so far so good.  \n\nWe were not handed menus so presumed what was written on the little white board was what we had to choose from. However, there was another white board with lots of Japanese writing, which neither my friend or I are fortunate enough to be able to translate, so I feel like we missed out on a lot. Again, I guess this is something you'll pick up the longer you go there, but nobody offered us any other choices so we just ordered what was on the board - some sashimi and a couple rolls.  \n\nAfter 1 bottle of saki, 2 large Sapporos and an episode of the Bachelor later, we were served.  While the portions were generous, the fish was obviously fresh and the chef very experienced, I was still underwhelmed.  The spicy tuna was chewy and the scallop was just, well, weird tasting, but the rest was to die for.  I don't know what this Omakase is and again, nobody cared to enlighten me, so I feel I didn't have the pleasure of experiencing the full scope of the menu.  All in all it was a good meal and interesting experience (especially when the Bee Gee's DVD came on), but way too expensive and hyped up for me.", "author": "Michelle W."}

The fish itself is worth the visit here. It's extraordinarily fresh. The presentation of the sushi could use some work, but the ingredients were delicious. The grilled eggplant was a bit bland and different from what I was expecting (nice purple colored eggies). Be prepared to pay $18 minimum, which isn't hard and fair for what you are getting.

It looked like there was only one space left but when I asked the server if there was room for two, she said yes and the rest of the people made room :D  We were really lucky.  It felt cramped but I was OK with that.  \n\nI didn't really know what to order so I saw the chef's choice on the board and asked for that.  The sushi chef reminds me of Mr. Miyagi.  I tried my best not to smile with obvious glee as he unwrapped the very boldy colored slabs of fish.  He does his craft with care and provides extremely generous portions.  In the mean time his wife hands us a small bowl of these neatly wrapped, clear noodles in a spicy broth.  Didn't know what the dish was called but it was remarkably tasty.  In fact I think throughout the night her cooking surprised me more than the sushi.\n\nWhen the sashimi arrived, we were actually kind of worried that they would give us one platter each, but we ended up sharing.  (Yeah, there was THAT much fish.)  The fish melts your mouth.  It is the freshest I've had anywhere thus so far.  From this point on, I couldn't stop smiling.  The nigiri our neighbors ordered had like 3:1 fish to rice ratio... They were ginormous.   We were given more home cooked dishes, from braised pork belly to burdock root tempura.

We went on a Monday, so maybe that was the hitch? We have had really authentic japanese food, all over, japan, LA, hawaii, NY, etc so we have very high standards. This place was very cute and quaint I have to admit its very charming and it does feel like you are eating at your grandparents home. The omakase was just too much of the same thing. We felt at least 2-3 courses were the same thing but in different form. We had maguro sashimi, then we had a spicy tuna roll (Nothing special btw) we had eel with sunomono and then later eel nigir (huge btw). We had tuna sashimi then spicy tuna roll then tuna tataki. Catch my drift here? I mean it was GOOD and very fresh, but it was just too much of the same thing but serve differently. reading all the reviews we were really looking forward to the monkfish liver. None to be had! We were also stuffed towards the end and was looking forward to a amazing dessert, like some home made moichi with azuki bean or something and all we got was  a tiny little ass persimmon cut up into 4 tiny bitty pieces! That was majorly disappointing. \n\nThis is what we had:\n*sashimi combo- overly generous portions of fresh fresh fish, salmon, maguro, saba, ika, hamachi, albacore, scallops- we saw the sushi chef cutting up all the pieces and we had thought it was for the two guys next to us, but it was for us! We were astonished at how big the pieces were but somehow we finished the entire thing!\n* chawanmushi-good, but nothing that I couldnt order off a menu at any japanese restaurant\n* sunomono with Eel, ok i personally dont really like eel cus I always get a bone!\n* grilled kama- good, buttery, and VERY Rich. Needed some salt or lemon or something. It was just overly oily.\n*grilled okra with bonito and sauce- this was OK. Tasty, but nothing mind blowing\n* sauteed mushroom dish with enoki, himeji, shitake and asparagus, tasty\n* a light spicy broth with tiny bits of pork, and spinach. Good, but it felt like something I could make at home or have at kitaro!\n* spicy tuna roll and 2 HUMUNGO pieces of eel nigri. At this point we were so fished out we really wished that plate wasnt for us\n* tuna tataki- OMG more of the same thing. We were done! We had to force ourselves to eat more fish. \n* the underwhelming dessert, 4 small ass pieces of persimmon!\n\nOverall, it was OK but I didnt feel the omakase selection was very good, I felt it was all ala carte random things that they just made. I mean who makes a spicy tuna roll for omakase? Their rolls are OK, nothing special , i dont think the chefs expertise is in making rolls as it was prepared rather sloppy. \n\nThe best part is the sashimi, and the portions. Overall i dont know if i would go back, and i for sure would not get the omakase again. We should have tried warkruiya in San Mateo in stead for a more authentic meal. I feel the omakase should have been more artfully prepared and with more thought. I felt like the meal was random dishes here and there and nothing really special. I mean I read and look at pictures from other places and the omakse is like a work of art. This was not the case here, highly disappointing!", "author": "Petri Y."}

This was an absolutely awesome experience.\n\nAfter having read the yelp reviews, We showed up early and made it second in line. The owners showed up at about 7:15pm and doors were opened, then it was waiting another 10 minutes before we could enter the sacred temple of sushihood. \nWe came on a friday, which is the only day they dont take omakase reservations for.\n\nTip:\n If you are standing in line Mon-Thu and are counting for whether you are gonna make the cut or not, take into consideration that they often have up to 4 reservations for omakase. they only have 11 chairs total, so you do the maths. Nothing is more frustrating than showing up real early and then being turned away. Also check with those before you how big their party is. Often people are holding a space for others.\n\nWe got the best seats at the sushi bar with perfect view of both the tv and the awesome japanese chef's handiwork.\nI have never seen fish treated so lovingly and it was a real treat to watch him slice the fish and discard anything less than absolutely perfect. That man has extremely high standards!\nThe meditative atmosphere was in a magical way supported by tina turner, best of. Simply awesome.\n\nDo get the sashimi platter (and share it between two). Its around 28$ and you get about 4 generous slices each of awesome fish (I think, tuna, yellowtail, salmon, octopus, squid, scallop and another wihitefish). It is also the first thing he prepares, so ordering that in addition to other things is not only best value for money but also reduces food waiting time to (only :-) 30 minutes. \nWe also ordered the cooked mushroom/asparagus, which was nicely spicy (peppery/salty) and cost around 9$. Prices are not on the board for anything but the nigiri, so its good to know that most cooked dishes and rolls will set you back about $9 each. \nThe spicy tuna roll was good even though I will never know how he fitted that much fish into a little bit of seeweed. The rolls are not as pretty or polished looking as in other places and tend to fall apart due to the masses of fish inside, but the taste is great.\nTheir nigiri are also fantastic. Do try the eel nigiri, which is served with the eel being hot! As their house rules sign says \"everything is fresh and everything is good\". Well said. The fish is super soft, fresh and almost sweet. Best quality fish I have had and I am a sushi addict. \n\nSo if you have a couple of hours to spare, love true artisanship as well as fresh fish and would like to enjoy your meal as a ceremony in cosy surroundings, then look no further than tekka.\n\nOh and its CASH ONLY!", "author": "Sandra T."}

They'll return the favor with the freshest of fish, an authentic taste of Japan, amazing hospitality and a genuine smile. Don't forget to count your blessings when you leave.", "author": "Hratch P."}

On one occasion, I came back at 9:15 to find yet another line too long to accommodate me. \n\nFolks, it just isn't good enough to justify this. Although I found the food to be good, the wait staff and chef are unfriendly and curt -- especially the wife. \n\nIt is the most customer-unfriendly experience I've ever had -- and people tolerate it not only because the food is good, but also because the chef commands an aura of authenticity from idiotic San Franciscans who equate curtness, unfamiliar dress and an Asian accent with \"authenticity.\" \n\nSeriously, one of the most annoying aspects of eating here is the way everyone tip-toes around the chef/wife, afraid to speak too loudly, ask for the bill or a refill, laugh at a joke or anything. \n\nTekka gets too many bonus points for being a hole-in-the-wall place with no sign run by quaint foreigners who don't speak English. It is also a classic example of people assuming desirability is correlated with scarcity. \n\nAnd by the way -- once I arrived early to see the Chef arrive before he put his costume on. His costume consists of several robes, a vest and a bandanna with Japanese patterns on it. He basically look as if he's dressing up as Mr Miyagi in Karate Kid. \n\nThe guy -- whose \"middle name is authentic\" according to one reviewer -- was dressed in standard American clothing including blue jeans and a leather jacket. That's not just a letdown -- that's a sign of how shallow Tekka's claim to authenticity is. Tekka is a phony shakedown of dumb Americans who equate rudeness and Mr Miyagi outfits with \"authenticity.\"", "author": "Brad C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-03", "description": "FOOD: FIVE STARS (* * * * *)\nI have eaten here more than a handful of times and each time the food is tastier than I remembered.  Despite the long wait to get into the restaurant (see below), it is always well worth it.  The fish is cut in front of you and you see him (Nobi, the sushi chef and owner) methodically prepare and serve everything.  Although I wish the nigiri pieces were a bit smaller for ease of consumption, the freshness is incomparable and all the fish I've tried has been melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I highly recommend the unagi as well, which is baked in a toaster oven in front of you.  Crispy yet tender, with sauce and sesame seeds on top--I can't imagine they would serve anything else in heaven.  If you like rolls, I recommend the negihama (yellow tail and green onions), which is bursting at its seaweed seams with flavor (and fish).  The cooked dishes are delicious as well, especially Yoshimi's (the wife and owner) eggplant and soft-shell crab.\n\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: FIVE STARS (* * * * *)\nYou must be at the restaurant by 6:30-6:45pm, depending on the day of the week.  I've been on all different days and it seems random as to when the crowds gather to eat there (been on a Friday night with only a few souls).  It's irritating that you must wait, usually in a Richmond-style wind tunnel with hurricane-force winds, but as I said before, it's worth every minute.  Dinner is paced very slowly, as Nobi and Yoshimi take their time preparing everything and serving everyone--not an easy task when there are 10 or 12 people in the place.  Expect to be there at least two hours.  I've simply never been to such an intimate or cozy dining experience before--you truly feel as if you are in someones home and they are making you dinner.\n\nVALUE: FOUR STARS (* * * *)\nSushi generally tends to be expensive, and this place is no exception.  While per piece prices are reasonable, you will have no trouble exceeding the required $18 minimum spend per person, as one person can easily eat at least five or six nigiris (priced around $2.50 each).  Add a Sapporo or sake and you're talking closer to the $30-40 range.  The Omakase (or \"Chef's Choice\") is around $40-50 by itself, and the Sashimi platter (which I recommend if you generally like most fish) is around $22.  One important thing to note is that they do not take credit cards, so bring at least $60 per person in cash.\n\nAverage of\nFOOD: FIVE STARS\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: FIVE STARS\nVALUE: FOUR STARS\n================\nAVERAGED GRAND TOTAL: FIVE STARS\n\nEstimated price per person (excluding drink):\n$25-35\n\nWould I recommend it to others?\nYes, without a doubt.  If you like sushi, there is no other place in San Francisco I would recommend more highly.\n\nWould I return?\nYes.", "author": "Benjamin L."}

This is the most downright charming authentic honest-to-God so damned delicious Japanese hole in the wall you could possibly hope to walk into. They serve what they have for the day and start anew with a fresh supply that they got that morning. You can see the master slice off slivers of old away from the hunk of sashimi so you know you're getting the real fresh deal. He slices the cucumber like a dream. Everything prepared on the spot and they make it a very organic experience where you can see them prepare the food for you. The master works his stuff on the counter and his wife, who's so very dear and graceful, cooks everything else in the back. The pumpkin is so damned good. The asparagus and mushrooms are to die for!

I think we didn't get seated until like 9:15 or 9:30pm.  I would recommend you either come early for the first round, or later for the second round.  Should have read the yelp before going.  Food is GREAT~  Fish is fresh!!!  Each piece is HUGE~  Yum Yum.  So happy and satisfied when the food came.  The grilled dishes are great too.  I guess the only drawback is the wait, and they don't open on weekends...", "author": "Charlotte C."}

Actually, this place is an Izakaya, not a sushi restauraunt.  The sign in front of the store says \"Izakaya\" in Japanese which is a place in Japan that serves mainly alcohol with small tapas-styled food.  However, this place serves sushi and is best known for that.\n\nIt is true: really good value here.  The Nigiri sushi is really large and very fresh; however, I think a little too large (not very traditional), but, nevertheless, very tasty even if you have to take two or three bites. \n\nIt was my first time going here so I don't have much of a track record here.  I can only tell you about the one experience.  \n\nSushi chef seems quite nice.  Wife is a little abrupt, but I think she is just so busy at work.  It is a husband and wife operation.  \n\nDon't bring a group of people because the place is very small.  Also, (I hate to say this because I am American myself) remember to behave and don't act obnoxious like so many people I have seen do in Japanese restauraunts.  Also, the kitchen is kinda a private space for Japanese people, so don't go barging into the kitchen. Stay out of there.)\n\n06/26/2008 - Had to lower this place's ratings because after a few occasions when I had went there and there were seats however, they were reserved for the owner's neighborhood friends.  I thought one of the rules is \"No reservations.\"  It should read \"No reservations, unless you are good with the chef.\"  Also, customers are not seated according to the seats that come available first.  I was waiting for a couple of seats on the end of the counter that has a full view of the chef making sushi.  When they came available, the existing patrons at the counter slid over and the chef didn't seem to care.  It's okay if nobody is waiting; however, I think it is quite rude and not very good on the part of the owners.  Lastly, all members should be there at the time of the seating (or a couple of minutes later).  People should not be able to come 30 mins - 1 hour+ later and just cut right in front of the people who are waiting forever out in the cold.   This establishment gets away with this because it is one of the only sushi places in the City that is quite authentic (except for the sushi size, which is humongous, but I don't complain about that) and the sushi chef is Japanese and has good technique.", "author": "John L."}

It only opens during the weekdays and closes if there is no business, but with the quality of the sushi, I can't imagine when there would not be business.  The place is very small and only seats 10, but it has charm.  This is a no frills place, so if you like sashimi or nigri, this is a great place.  If you like those crazy rolls with tempura or california roll...you should not come.  It's simple, fresh, & great portion.  It's not cheap, but it's reasonable.  It's a place where you will find regulars.  Don't expect to be wowed by ambiance...just expect great sushi.  Prices are reasonable for what you are getting.  Depending on how much you eat and drink...it can range from $25 to $60/person.  If you can't get in on the first seating...come back at 8:30pm.", "author": "Hoang D."}

I am not a sushi specialist and I still have to visit Japan for the great food experience people talk about, so I am judging with respect to the other many San Francisco sushi restaurants I have tried.\nI went there with my girlfriend last night (Monday). We arrived pretty late without any reservation, after 10pm. They had just closed, but they still let us in with a very friendly attitude. It was almost full, which means other six people were there.\nWe had the tuna roll, the eel/avocado roll, mackerel nigiri, albacore tuna nigiri, sake-marinated cooked fish (I can't remember which kind, but it was the only kind they offered for this dish), seaweed salad, miso soup, and two pitchers of cold sake. I'll make it short: everything was AMAZING. The tuna roll had a lot more tuna than usual, and it was incredibly fresh and tasty. I count it among the best foods I have ever had, all cuisines included.\nService was very kind and attentive all along. Towards the end of dinner, we had a great time chatting with the owner/chef and his wife, who are very charismatic, and the other people there. We were never rushed to leave even if it was late. \nThis incredible dinner was only about $85 for two. \nNeedless to say, we plan to come back regularly!", "author": "Guillermo G."}

The fish is also served in rather large pieces but an order of nigiri is one piece not two like a lot of places. For roll eaters, this is not the restaurant for you. If you want to eat here you must wait in line at designated times for the two seatings which can be a pain since the restaurant only seats about 10 ppl per seating.", "author": "S N."}
