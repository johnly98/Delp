I've had a lot of good Italian food, both in Italy and northeastern US.\n\nThat said, the entrees were great! The cacio e pepe was perfect. Husband's ravioli had a really fresh and homemade-tasting red gravy.  My extremely picky father-in-law (nothing is like Mama made it) would have loved it.\n\nThe negatives: the garlic app was just okay. The bread was very generic, not up to the level of the food. And wine aficionados shouldn't have high expectations here. The rose was acceptable. The pinot noir was extremely bland. Neither was poured tableside, so could have been box wines. Both were \"cooked\" (not kept around 56 degrees), which is pretty common. Possibly the wines by the bottle are better quality/better storage.\n\nService was decent. Decor was great, which is really why we ended up there though it wasn't necessarily on my 'list'. And the quality of the entrees really made it worth it.", "author": "Haltone H."}

The crust was delicious - I'm not a crust guy...just a crusty guy!  :)\n\nThe Choppino could have been better.  Many other places use crabs or lobster to enrich the flavour.  Not here.

At the moment I'm thinking, what took you so long to go on chef?  \n\nWe came through the door on a night that I was sure we might not even get in. We were greeted by Maurizio Flores. After I was seated I found out he was the owner. This gentleman understands the true art of greeting each guest with a warm sincere welcome. That alone starts your food journey for the evening on the right foot. \n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and warm. All of the pictures on the wall remind me of Satdi's restaurants in New York City. I am told all the famous pictures are at the owner's friends and people who have eaten here. The picture over our table is one of the late and great Prince. I had the opportunity to cook for him for 2 weeks.  The lights hanging in the middle of the restaurant reminds me of our flat we had for a week in Positano\n\nWe were seated in the section of Joseph B\nLuca M. Wow!!!  The genuine care and comfort of their guests is their highest mission. I feel like we could be one of the few tables of English speakers.  Watching these charming waiters crossing over from Italian to English to give perfect service to each and every table. \n\nWe started our first course with the calamari and it was fried to perfection. This is not one of these overly breaded bowl of rubber bands. How could we not have bruschetta as well. Beautiful, tasty and not a treat to be missed. \n\nWe had the meat lasagna and the house pizza. Unfortunately, they took away the menu for me to describe perfectly how they prepare the dough. \n\nThank you! Thank you!! Thank You Joseph B\nLuca m and Maurizio Flores.

Every time I have visited, everyone has been super friendly and the wait staff is amazing. We have walked in with no reservation and some how we always get seated at the same table! It's not a very big restaurant but the ambience is absolutely beautiful... kind of dark, with a bar on one side and open kitchen on the other. Tables are down the middle of the restaurant. It is truly one of my favorite places to visit when I am visiting the North Beach area. The food is AMAZING! Get the bruschetta, you won't be disappointed. Perfectly grilled toast with just the right amount of tomato and garlic. In past visits, I have had the Margarita Pizza, Pasta with olive oil and garlic (amazing), Chicken marsala and Pasta Pomodoro. My son absolutely loves the seafood pasta. I have never been disappointed  here.

I recommended Mona Lisa Restaurant, as I have had several yummy experiences at this restaurant before. Before entering my friends and I were scanning the menu located outside of the restaurant. The owner of the restaurant asked how many in our party, then proceeded to offer an appetizer on the house. \n\nWe were seated, ordered beverages, our appetizer (which was \"on the house\") and lastly ordered our entrees. Our waiter was friendly and fast, which was perfect since we were starving! \n\nALL of our food was perfect and delicious. No complaints there at all. On the contrary, the ingredients were fresh and rich. \n\nMy issue here was the lack of communication in regard to our appetizer on the house. It was a good 20 min seated, when we ordered our drinks and appetizer. Once our ordered appetizer came out, our server brought an ADDITIONAL plate of bruschetta and said the owner \"also sent you this\". When we got the bill, the bruschetta was complimentary only. We were never asked if that's what we wanted as our complimentary appetizer. To me this smelled like tourist bait and I was extremely disappointed, especially when I was the one to bring my three friends to this restaurant. \n\nI asked our server and he repeated to me that the bruschetta was the complimentary dish only.

It had this vibe you know, it was crowded but in a good way. It was covered wall to wall with paintings. There were really 2 main points about this restaurant that really stood out to me. First off the food was to die for. We got the tower off appetizers plus we had the bread they gave us to start off with. We were so full by the time it got to our main course! All of this shocked me cause usually I can eat ALOT. But this is all in a good way, we wanted to eat all the food. When it did get to our main course we ate maybe 3-5 bites plus bite from others people to try theirs. The food was excellent and tasted very good the next day! Lastly but certainly not least, THE SERVICE! The service was tremendous here they were so kind. So first when we walked in there was this kind man greeting everyone and talking to everybody. Then this amazing lady got you situated and talked to you as well. She made sure you were ready to eat and hoped you were having a good day. They good came out relatively quick and did not disappoint. They did a good job checking on us making sure everything was just right. Once we are our main course they do something I've never seen, ever. They asked how our food was and then we asked for to go boxes. Then they got them for us and then he proceeded to put our food in the boxes for all of us and put them in a bag for us to take to our hotel. I've never seen that before but it just seemed so nice. Then we got our check payed and got up and left. The same person that greeted us said goodbye. Really I would recommend and would go here again!", "author": "Molly A."}

We were seated right away, and we thought we were off to a good start.\n\nWell, long-story short, the ambiance was probably the only great thing about this place. They weren't busy when we went here at 8PM, but our waiter paid more attention to their other guests than us, so we felt very neglected. Maybe we just came on a bad day. \n\nFor all these reviews about amazing food and a long wait for the food, we expected the food to be incredible. We did wait a while for our food, but that's not problematic for us. We were just really disappointed by how the food tasted. I am a huge advocate of chicken parmigiana, and it lacked flavor. This was my boyfriend's first time trying it, and now he's not convinced he should try other chicken parmigiana for comparison. \n\nThe ravioli we got was ok tasting, and so was their bruschetta and tiramisu.

However, I am so extremely disappointed with staff, service, and food that it ruined the whole night. Let me address each piece...\n\n1. Service- we were seated quickly, but once seated we waited for forever before someone even came to our table.  It took so long that we almost left, but finally our server came after more than 20 minutes and brought us water. Which brings me to point 2....\n\n2. Staff- HORRIBLE. We were greeted by Luca, and by the time were ready to order since they took so long to arrive in the first place. Let me start off by saying he was not at all pleasant. We weren't all that hungry, so we ordered 3 dishes to share: Chicken Piccata, Rigatoni Aldon Smith, and Risotto. Luca immediately arrogantly stated that since there are four of us dining, we would have to order four dishes.\n\nWhat?! This was nowhere stated on the menu, and I saw other diners at the restaurant clearly sharing dishes. I thought he was joking at first and tried to laugh it off, but he retorted that he was being serious and demanded us to order another dish. I asked for some time to think about what we wanted to order. I was shocked that there was an obligation to order one dish per person for our table, when clearly it wasn't a requirement for others. I realized a few minutes later that he was probably taking advantage of us, thinking that we are tourists, since we were there as a family? I flagged him down and asked him to cancel our order and we will take our business elsewhere, and suddenly he seemed okay with serving us. This was absolutely not the ambiance I wanted to bring my family to, and was so upset at the upfront rude behavior of Luca that it ruined the rest of my night. \n\n3. The food itself was hit or miss. Rigatoni was excellent, Risotto was average, and the Chicken tasted like it was just boiled and doused in sauce. \n\nThe food and service could have been pardoned, but I am so turned off by the arrogant behavior of the staff that I am never returning here again.", "author": "Sonia D."}

My Chicken Saltimbocca was surprisingly good.  It was simply prepared with roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach.  The chicken was moist while the prosciutto and sage offered delicious contrasts to one another.  The sauce/juice that was present had a good flavor profile to it.  The spaghetti Carbonara was so-so.  It was not a good as other places we had been too.  We couldn't pick out the reason but only knew so by the taste.\n\nRoberto (?) was rude and not very attentive to us.  When he first came over to take our drink orders, everything seemed fine.  After that, things changed for some reason.  The wait to take our orders was extremely long.  In fact, several tables around us, where people arrived after us, had already ordered.  We tried to get his attention several times to no avail.  The menus were closed so that should have been a clue to him to come over.  It took several requests to just get the balsamic vinegar for our bread.  Then, after only having it for a few minutes, he came by and took the vinegar and olive oil, only to give it to a couple at an adjacent table.  Needless to say, both parties were shocked at that move.

The waiter was very nice and very attentive to our needs. You truly get an authentic Italian experience here. The place has a very lowkey vibe to it and I found myself admiring all of the art and statues throughout the entire restaurant. My friends ordered a calzone and I ordered the Fettuccine Leonardo. It is basically chicken and Alfredo sauce with baby tomatoes. Extremely good and has lots of flavor. So, if you're ever in walking home from Pier 39, you might find this place.

The wait staff can be a little busy at times, but they always refill the water. It can be a little hard at times to track down the waiter for the bill when it gets busy. I can also see why some people complain about the service since the waiters can be abrupt at times. \n\nAs for the food, good amount of variety. Huge portions. I do have to mention some inconsistencies.  The first time I came, I ordered the squid ink pasta with calamari, but for some reason it didn't come with the calamari,  so I had to mention this to the waiter and they fixed it. It was great once they got it right. Second time I ate there I ordered the frutti di mare and it came with fish and was missing some items listed in the description. I had to mention this again, so they added the missing seafood, but the fish was left in it so it added a weird flavor and I didn't care for it. The last time I ordered the rigatoni with spicy sausage, meat sauce, and eggplant. The order was right this time, but it was very oily. \n\nWorth a try, just make sure your dish comes out as described in the menu.", "author": "Sherille S."}

When visiting this restaurant yesterday, the food was hands down thee best Italian food that I have ever tasted. \nThe one star is for our server. Being in the industry for 8 years, the following was very disappointing. We ordered a soup, salad and calamari to start. Happily pacing ourselves with the appetizers while preparing for our entrees. There were 2 wine glasses that were empty on our table for more than 10 minutes. When they wanted another glass, we could not spot our server anywhere in site and had to flag down another wait staff to try to find our server. We asked how much longer for our food, to which he responded that he was waiting for the Caesar salad to be finished that we had on the table. Well my oh my, this was no small Caesar salad to start with. Shocked to say the least to hear from our server that they were trained to wait until all the food was completely gone until firing up the entrees. \nWhen clearing the appetizers off the table, there was no pardon my reach while our server felt inches away from my face with his arm extending to grab the soup bowl. This happened more than once, sadly. \nOur entrees arrived at last and everything was cooked to perfection. Zero complaints about plates, presentation, temperature, or anything else guests tend to comment on. \nWe ordered two desserts which were pretty delicious. \nOur server only checked on us twice while there was food on the table, while one of the check ins was if we wanted boxes. \nTo say if we'll be back for another shot...not too sure on that one.", "author": "Shelby D."}

I am thankful that they drop off a bread basket as soon as you sit down. This was able to hold us over for an hour and a half until we received our plate of spaghetti and a plate fettuccini alfredo. That's right, an hour and a half wait for our dinner, and that's not including the 30-40 minutes it took for the waiter to come and take out order. Oh and if you think you're getting a refill during that hour and a half, it's not going to happen. So be sure to ration out your beverage. \n\nBy looking around, I could easily tell that I was not the only one unpleased with the wait. I even observed two customers send their orders back because they were not prepared correctly. The staff appears to be untrained and is unable to handle the busy Saturday rush. At no time did anyone apologize for he wait, or keep us updated on our meals preparation process. One thing that really got to me, was when a table that ordered after us, received their meals about 10-15 minutes before us.

My main course was the gnocchi and 4 cheese sauce. It was like little pillows of scrumptiousness! My son had the spaghetti vongele, and it had clams cooked perfectly with lots of yummy garlic. My husband's cannolini was baked and bubbling when it arrived at the table and every last morsel was devoured! We were so stuffed we had no room for dessert, but it looked like we missed out! I will try to save room next time :) Oh, PS, the service and owner are delightful!!!", "author": "Kerry Y."}

And it was amazing.\n\nNorth Beach has its fair share of Italian food, so it's meaningful when a restaurant is able to stand out among so much competition. I'll break it down.\n\nThe Food - I need to start here. The bread is classic Italian - slightly crispy outside and soft inside. We split the caprese for an appetizer - everything was fresh and crisp. I ordered the Mix Seafood Grill - a massive helping of shrimp, swordfish, and some of the best salmon I've had in years. My girlfriend had the chicken cacciatore, which we both loved. For dessert, the tiramisu was simply divine.\n\nThe Service - When I say \"everyone was fantastic\", I mean *everyone*. The owner himself was making sure we had the experience we wanted.\n\nThe Ambiance - there is a classic fiat out front that they've converted into a little booth for two. We had dinner while watching the setting sun change the sky's colors. \n\nIt couldn't have been better. And my Italian girlfriend agreed.", "author": "Ittai B."}

It's a genuine Italian restaurant - sure, it plays up stereotypes to draw people in (i mean, it's named Mona Lisa and has a fiat), but the experience overall was fantastic. Just don't be in a rush. The staff (as far as I could tell) and the owners are Italian to the core, so things may not be prompt or quick, but they will be good and delicious. \n\nMy family and I were drawn in by the owner standing outside next to the menu, and while we were looking at it he mentioned that an appetizer was free for the July 4th weekend, and that we could trust his cooking since he was Italian, Etc etc, and for curiosity's sake we were like: sure ok. We were seated immediately, near the windows, so the dim lighting wasn't so bad, but I can imagine further into the restaurant it would be more difficult to take photos of your meal. The inside itself is beautifully decorated with a painted ceiling and fun pictures and statues. Throughout my time there, the waiters were singing along to the Italian songs and chatting amongst themselves casually, and I thought it was just really amusing and different than say, an Olive Garden or any other run-of-the-mill Italian place. \n\nThe free appetizer we did get was a delightful crostini that we ate with our red wine we ordered - I believe we got the Cabernet our waiter recommended. The sliced bread we received as we waited for our food was also refilled promptly and delicious as well. It seemed as if there were not enough olive oil/balsamic containers to go around but our waiter took ours from an empty table so it didn't cause a bother. The place was busy and popping by the time we left, and it was pretty funny because there was an older fellow outside who must be a friend of the owners or maybe work for the restaurant who was greeting people and saying 'thanks for coming' etc, and he had a picture with the owners on one of the walls, so at first we thought he must be famous but we had no idea. Just a treat to people watch!\n\nAnd, ok, the meal. I will dream of this meal I think, forever. I'm going to Rome for a few months next year but I don't even know if anything there can top it. The menu had so many unique choices it was so hard to choose, but eventually I settled on the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, spinach, and pecans. \n\nIt was mind blowing. The sauce was creamy and so thick so I had to stop several times just to savor it, but I'm so glad I had the wine and the time. I didn't even end up finishing it all! My table also ordered an eggplant dish, a veal dish, and another pasta dish, and they were all delicious as well (I of course sampled - how could I not?) Anyway. It was absolutely fantastic, hands down the best Italian food I've had in America. \n\n\nTldr: go. Order bravely. Take your time. Enjoy it.", "author": "Alina D."}

It was a crisp evening, so the warmth of Mona Lisa was very much welcomed by my husband and me.  \nWe were greeted outside, ushered in and shown to our table just that quick.  \nFresh bread, bottles of water and a menu.  We're on our way.  But first, we had to try the bread.  A little olive oil, a little balsamic vinegar and uummmmm.  Delicious.  But we didn't want to fill up on bread.  How we managed any self control is beyond me.  Bread is a weak point with us.\nSo we ordered an appetizer, the mini calzones with pesto.  The calzones were stuffed with cheese and ham.  Fried (baked?) to perfection and the pesto was so creamy and a great dipping sauce.  It came on a lettuce bed that was dressed with some fresh tomatoes.  This would be a perfect lunch all by itself for the hungry business person.  And, the tomato, calzone and pesto combo was a real taste treat, said my husband!\nOur entree' (I've shamefully forgotten the name of the dish) was a chicken breast that was grilled and seasoned with some special peppers.  On the side were roasted potatoes and also a side of spinach.  A little of everything on the fork for the perfect bite.  \nAside from the perfectly delicious food, the atmosphere is just plain fun.  All sorts of things going on, yet not in your face.  Look around.  Famous people's pictures who've visited are framed on the walls around the place.  The ceiling is a light show!  The music, I wish it were Italian as well.  Just a personal thing.  I like hearing the music of the place that the food is paying homage to.\nOur server was gracious.  Service was excellent.  I'm so glad we had the opportunity to visit Mona Lisa.  This is now on our \"Revisit\" list.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food.  It seems to be mostly of three components: meat, pasta, sauce.

So much so that I NEVER, EVER leave Yelp reviews, but this prompted me to sign in after YEARS of city eating. To be honest, it really felt like prejudice (over I don't know WHAT, sure we looked young and funny looking but hell, I was wearing a tie even).\nIt was the worst service I've ever seen GLOBALLY. Here's a breakdown:\n* We came in Saturday night, 2 hours before closing. Asked to sit outside, they said sure. \n* THEY IGNORED US! After water came, we NEVER saw them again. Over 20 minutes, and they were NOT busy at all, maybe 3 tables full inside. \n* We asked to move inside because we had waited so long we were FREEZING. They said sure, and we had to move our water and place settings in OURSELVES.\n* Still: SLOW, RUDE service. Mainly a short haired/short bearded guy WHO WENT HOME and walked past us as we were sitting (wearing a black shirt and black backpack).\n* WOW!!!!!! We asked for a little vinegar and olive oil for our bread, and they said \"Sorry guys, OUT OF VINEGAR\", which is fairly shocking for an ITALIAN RESTAURANT.\n* WHAT?!?!?! After he left, another waiter came buy 10 minutes later and BROUGHT A BOTLE OF VINEGAR TO THE TABLE OF TWO WOMEN SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO US.\n______INCREDIBLY INSULTING!!!!!!__________\n* Had to ask for a refill of water, had to ask for the check (which took FOREVER), NEVER was checked on to see how everything was going. \n* The table next to us had to SEND AN ITEM BACK because IT WAS UNDERCOOKED. The waiter asked if they wanted a discount, they said \"No. We want what we ordered, but now we want it to go\". \n* Again, we arrived 2 HOURS before closing, so it's not that we walked in 10 minutes before closing, but even an hour into our meal a guy shouted \"WE CLOSED\" to a group trying to walk in. \n\nHell! We were just a group of to, a young guy and a young lady. We just wanted to have a quick bite and we pay/tip well! But for the first time ever: I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE A TIP, THEY DID NOT DESERVE A PENNY. I WAS COMPLETELY INSULTED AND IT FEELS LIKE WE WERE \"PRETTY WOMAN'D\" (aka judged for appearing to not have money). \n\nI left a $1 tip and I hope they got the insult. Congratulations Mona Lisa, I'm against leaving bad feedback but YOU PUSHED THE ENVELOPE. We will forever laugh at how terrible and rude your service was, and if I were the owner reading this, I would definitely take a look at that server who served us Saturday night 6/10/17. \n\nIt's a shame, the food was good.

I know good Italian food because I come to Mona Lisa every chance I get.

As I walk in, I'm always greeted with a kiss on both cheeks and a glass of wine. And on a few occasions I've even been seated in the Fiat outside. \n\nFunny story - I went on a first date to Mona Lisa, this guy was going on and on about how great the food and atmosphere are. He had no idea I was a regular. We walked in, and Maurizio greeted my with a kiss on the cheek and sat me down at my favorite spot in the corner. My date could tell something was up. After a few minutes, this guy was so confused when an order of Calamari was delivered to the table, \"Courtesy of the Owner.\" I laughed and told him that Mona Lisa is like a second home to me. Dinner was outstanding, as always. I had Ravioli with Vodka sauce (my favorite) and he had the Pollo Piccata (my second favorite.) We shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio and tiramisu for dessert.

Aside from the lovely hostess with curly hair and glasses ( didn't catch your name, but keep up the wonderful job) my experience here may be my last. \n\n- It's a disgusting feeling when you do not feel welcomed to a restaurant or anywhere for that matter. I ate here with my younger brother and felt that our waiter prioritized certain tables over ours. Haven been a waiter, I understand different signs customers give me in order to accommodate their wants and needs. That being said, we closed our menus since we already decided on what to get. Our waiter passed us several times and clearly saw that we were ready, but still insisted on not acknowledging us. Finally, he took our orders. Losing my appetite already, but hey, hopefully the food compensates for his lack of friendly service.\n\n- Food comes out and it looks semi-pleasing. My \"Spaghetti Polpette \" lacked sauce. The spaghetti itself was not cooked al dente as requested. My brother's pasta, \"Spaghetti allo Scoglio\" was appetizing, I give them that. \n\n- I took a couple bites and was not pleased, so I was waiting for my waiter to check up on us. He went to our table and asked us how the food was (kind gesture) but as I was speaking, he walks away to attend to another table, that did not even flag him down. Such a rude move. He comes back after attending to the table next to mine, and says, \" you wanted more sauce?\" \"Yes, please\".\n\n- I was presented with more sauce in a timely manner. Sauce wasn't flavorful, but I really didn't want to be that \"one guy\" so decided to let it go. Did not end up packing our leftovers (which I usually do). \n\nIt could have been an off day for them. Our waiter could have been having a bad day. But regardless of the fact, servitude, friendliness, and tastiness is always key, and Mona Lisa did not reach my expectations. Would I give this place another try? Yeah, I would, but would definitely try something else and request another server.", "author": "Jim G."}

Our server was nice and helped with my gf requests. \n\nThe atmosphere is like so many other cute cozy Italian restaurants in the little Italy district. Tons of little tables packed together, Italian flags hanging from the walls, the ceilings painted with resembles to the Sistine chapel and similar romantic art. \n\nThe gluten free options here are good. They have a rice fusilli pasta and said I could have any sauce... And wow did they have a lot of sauces. Almost too many to choose from. They also have gf pizzas. \n\nWe ordered the caprese salad which was good and they also made a tomato based calamari appetizer since I couldn't have the fritti, it was pretty good. I had the bolgonese meat sauce which was tasty, tho my pasta was really undercooked and tough to eat. My friends ordered a veal dish and the other a risotto with prawns. The one with the veal said it wasn't bad and the one with the risotto didn't eat much of hers. \n\nPrice was ok. About 16 for the pasta and 11 or so for the appetizer was what I paid for. It was really nice that there wasn't any additional gluten free charge, that is hard to find. I ordered their house Cabernet which was good, I just thought 10.00 was a little pricey for just a house glass of wine..

The usual Italian restaurant for us in the neighborhood has long been Sodini's or Ideale.  Mona Lisa has always been considered a tourist spot.  But out w friends recently, the wait for Sodini's was 45 minutes, so we decided to give Mona Lisa's a try.  \n\nStick w certain pasta dishes & you'll be fine.  My man's chicken piccata was a true study in mediocrity.  It was over salted & the sauce was a clingy mess instead of accentuating & tasty.  Pass.\n\nThe carbonara, on the other hand, was delicious.  The bacon was extra crispy, which gave great contrast to the dish.  The sauce was rich & flavorful.  A decadent dish.  Lip smacking good.\n\nThe rigatoni w truffle I ordered was also very good.  Good balance of flavor, w just the right amount of truffle, this dish was lighter & cleaner than the carbonara.  My man kept taking bites.  He didn't care for his piccata dish, but really liked this.  And it was nicely al dente.  A win.\n\nIt's kitschy, but not completely over the top.  This is North Beach.\n\nIn a pasta mood?  Mona Lisa's not a bad call.  Just know what to order.\n\n3 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

It is a bit on the pricey end for me. Came here today Sunday Feb 12th, 2017 with my sisters in law and my kids. The staff was attentive and sweet they gave us a free appetizer to start. One of my sister in law ordered a seafood risotto, and the other sister in law ordered lasagna, my eldest one ordered kid sized fettuccine alfredo, and my little one and I shared spaghetti with meatballs. The portion for the adult meal in comparison to the kid sized plate was the same. Had I known it was the same portion I would've ordered two kid sized plates. I didn't even finish my spaghetti because it was over flavored and as for the fettuccine alfredo it lacked flavor and was a bit oily for my personal taste. Would I come back maybe, had I ever had better Italian food...yes. Sorry I really really love the friendly staff, but the food as for today just didn't do for my family and I. I was hoping for a 5 star Italian cuisine especially for the prices listed on the menu.", "author": "Tina L."}

Nice, weighty glasses and dinnerware made it a treat to eat here. We shared food and not only were our pastas split loving on two plates, but the tiramisu we ordered to go was in two small boxes!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-13", "description": "NORTH BEACH EATING PART VIII: SOUTHERN CUISINE - COLUMBUS DAY\n\nI ate here at lunch today on Columbus Day. As my title stated I generalized the cuisine as southern cuisine. When I have been starting my North Beach adventure I would go to Italian restaurants trying to find specialized, regional cuisines. One of the major problems of trying to categorize the regional cuisine of the restaurant is the extensive menu. There are so many items on the list I was worried about the quality of each dish. In addition I couldn't what in the menu what the regional cuisine of this restaurant; the only reason I stated southern cuisine of this restaurant was because it stated on the Yelp information. Having quick lunch I needed to just one item, but I wasn't sure what item to ordered. It was either Fettuccine Mona Lisa or a risotto dish. I asked the waiter his recommendation about the risotto. He asked if I liked meat or seafood. I was thinking about the seafood. He went down the list to pick certain items. In the end I decided to order the Fettuccine Mona Lisa for one reason. In the past if a certain restaurant names a dish after its own restaurant name I'm assuming the dish is its specialty. That's why I ordered the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. \n\nAs mentioned before one of the reasons why this menu was confusing was because I couldn't tell what is their specialty. There are several items named after the restaurant (Fettuccine Mona Lisa, Chicken Mona Lisa, Pizza Mona Lisa, and Veal Mona Lisa). There are also dishes named after the City (Spaghetti San Francisco, Chicken San Francisco, and Risotto San Francisco). Since this restaurant is on North Beach why doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? Lol.\n\nNow back to my only dish, which is the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. Two great things about this pasta is that the pasta is cooked al denta and the sauce is creamy but not heavy. One thing I didn't like about this pasta is it was quite salty due to the olives. Since the olives are cured having the olives with the ham makes dish quite salty. I would recommend either having the olives or ham alone in the pasta but not both. With abundance of items on the menu I feared that this dish would not maintain its quality. Other than the olives the pasta was quite tasty. \n\nEven though I only had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa today, I've eaten here before. The last time I ate here was about 10 years ago. I don't think the menu has remained the same but what I remembered was that the menu was very extensive that made it intimidating. What I ordered last time was the salmon, but there were so many different dishes of salmon I couldn't remember what I ordered. However I do remember the salmon was dry and overcooked. The fear of having too many items is some of the dishes won't be as good. Even though I've only eaten here twice in the last ten years my rating is based upon two items - a tasty Fettuccine Mona Lisa and a dry salmon. In a sense my rating is based on one word - consistency. With too many dishes consistency is hard to achieve. I feel if the restaurant cuts more than half of the dishes in the current menu I believe the quality of the food will be much better and consistency will be better achieved.", "author": "Gerald R."}

We attempted to pop into a few other places, but none of the menus had something we could agree to (my guy, once he gets \"chicken parm sandwich\" on the brain, is in tunnel-vision). So - he wanted chicken parm and I was craving seafood (this IS San Francisco, afterall). \n\nWe ended up at Mona Lisa - our server sat us outside in the little corner table - super squishy (I was literally sitting in a bush) - the table was super small and didnt have enough room for bread plates, bread, waters, our drinks, etc etc. I had my wallet and phone resting on the table (I dont carry a purse), but had to move them to my lap once the wine came.\n\nThe server took forever to take our order and the food took three times that long to arrive (or, maybe we were just starving) - regardless, it was worth the wait. We swallowed our meals practically whole (again, starving). My guy ordered the chicken parm (of course) and they were kind enough to throw a handful of spaghetti on my guys plate at his request - it came with lots of sauce and the chicken seemed tender. I, to satisfy my seafood craving, went with the super expensive Cioppino - it was $32 - for LUNCH. It came as a mountain of seafood in a tomato broth. I literally forced myself to eat every last tentacle in there... a) because of the price and b) because, starving.\n\nThe food, in my taste, was a bit too salty - I was dehydrated a bit any way, so maybe it just stood out a bit more than usual. Also - true to SF fashion, the bread is sourdough - we arent huge fans (but it IS delicious dipped in cioppino broth).\n\nFor an $80 lunch (yep. Literally - one glass of wine, two beers, a chicken parm plate and cioppino), I'd probably expect a bit more, but it satisfied everything we needed to refuel and carry on with the rest of our walking tour of the City.", "author": "Heather H."}

We looked at the menu outside and a group outside told us that the food was amazing and that we had to try the mini calzones. We decided to give it a try. \nWe were seated by a very friendly man whom I pretty much assume is the owner. He was great! Asked us if we spoked Italian. We don't but he did! Fantastic! \nThe place is very decorated. It's very busy decor but almost cozy. Fun to look at. Real table clothes, gas lamps, bread and water in funky bottles as soon as you sit down. Awesome. \nBiggest complaint? Service. \nWe waited 5-10 min to be greeted by our server. It wasn't busy. I heard the two servers talking about what tables to take. They were the only one on as far as I could tell before dinner rush actually started. \nThe appetizer we got was ice cold. The waiter took them back and then told us that they were out of it so we got the mini calzones. Which were great. \nMain course was okay. My boyfriend loved his NY strip that he got. Although it was a little more done than what he asked for.  I got the chicken parmigiana and was so disappointed.  The chicken was tiny and tough and it cost $22.95!!!! \nMy boyfriend wanted another beer and had to ask twice to get one. I asked for another glass of wine and never got it. The waiter was not attentive at all. Forgetful? Preoccupied? I could tell he was in the weeds but come on. Ask for some help from your co workers! \nOverall I paid $127 to treat my boyfriend to a birthday dinner that we will mostly remember by the terrible service of our waiter. :(", "author": "Amanda R."}

Service, as described on just about every review site, is terrible but I thought it would still be worth it.  For example, they brought the appetizer when we were all nearly finished with our main courses. Water was never refilled.  The waiter seemed determined to never make eye contact.\n\nThe most annoying part was the tinny AM rock music (albeit Italian) blaring from overhead speakers making conversation almost impossible.  It did not contribute to a comfortable dining ambience at all.  As we were leaving I approached the  manager (or the short man running around table-to-table acting as such), and mentioned that we were long time customers and I wanted to share some feedback.  He immediately said \"Yeah, I know.  The service was bad.  Ha ha.\"  I said I wanted to comment on the music not the service. I was told in a gruff sarcastic tone that \"It's Italian.  What do you want?  Sophia Loren?\"  Kind of an odd thing to say.  \n\nThe food was okay but not stellar.  The waiter forgot to give us our leftovers to go.

The menu is huge, so plan on pouring over it for awhile. Most of the meals we got were good, and the prices are reasonable. We had some bruschetta to start, and the tomatoes were incredible (even in late Dec) - but only four small pieces of bread for $10. Only one meal was unsatisfactory - the pesto gnocchi  was really not very good - the pesto was very funky and woody tasting, drowned in olive oil, and lacking any of the balance of a good pesto (I don't think there was any parmesean cheese in it at all). I had the 4 cheese gnocchi and it was very good, although not surprisingly very rich. Most of the other meals were were good - average to above average - and also reasonably priced. \n\nThere weren't many good options for the kids. One of them got a pizza made for a large adult (lots of leftovers) - I had a slice, and it was just OK - the crust was a bit soft for my taste. The other kid got a small plate of penne and marinara which was good.  The wine list was long, but not overwhelming.\n\nService was a little spotty, and I see others have complained about it on here. I understand that a good Italian meal is meant to be savored over the course of several hours - but we spent alot of time waiting around in a relatively empty restaurant (we were there at 5:00, before the dinner rush). Just getting the bill after the plates were cleared took another 10-15 minutes.\n\nThey have a huge menu, so there's probably something for everyone here.", "author": "Rob N."}

The owner always greats me with \"Bona sera, Bella!\" and a kiss on each cheek!  Whether it's just me and my husband, or me and 18 of my closest female friends, the service is always impeccable, food scrumptous, and ambiance delightful!!!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Ravioli al Quattro Formaggio, which is creamy with nutty hints of parmesan and smokey wafts of gorgonzola.  For those who, like me, want more protein on their dish, I aways ask them to add chicken, which they cook up in the sauce to perfection, so it's never dry!  For those who REALLY like to guild the lily, ask them to throw in some pancetta or prosciutto as well...mmmm, deliciosa!!!!!\n\nAlso delicious are the Chicken Saltimboca (which comes with tasty sauteed spinach and penne with red sauce), the Veal Parmagianna (really, sooooo good!!!!!), and the Osso Bucco.  \n\nFor something lighter, I enjoy the Prosciutto pizza and the Caesar Salad.  Also, their antipasto platter is a true joy!!!\n\nThere are two things I DON'T recommend here:  the gnocchi in marinara sauce (for some reason, it always disappoints people), and the desserts aren't particularly special.  The coffee and drinks are fabulous, though!!\n\nThe service is always friendly, maybe a little flirty, always very accomodating!!!  My water glass is NEVER empty, and I never wait very long for my order to arrive at the table.\n\nI've been coming here for years, and am happy to say that if anything, Mona Lisa Restaurant only gets better with age!!", "author": "Amy L."}

Plus, they had a car outside which you could dine in.\n\nSince it was such a beautiful day, we were seated outside so we could enjoy the weather and people watch. Split the lobster ravioli and the signature Mona Lisa pizza. I wasn't blown away with the pizza but it was still delicious. Loved the lobster ravioli though! I would have finished the entire dish if I hadn't had to share.\n\nExtra brownie points:\n-The server was extremely attentive, making sure we had clean plates, utensils, and our water was always full\n-The table next to us had ordered a salad which came out twice, and our server decided to let us have it rather than having it go to waste.

The decor is very Italian and they have great Italian music playing. The tables and chairs are on the old side but not a big deal for me. Our waiter was attentive but didn't smile very much but at least he was somewhat attentive. He brought us an appetizer to share on the house which was nice. I ordered the squid ink risotto and scallops and my husband had a pizza. The pizza was just ok but my risotto was amazing, the portion was big enough for 2 people to share. And it came with a lot of scallops, they were not stingy with the scallops. For alcoholic drinks they only have wine, nothing else. So if u want a any other type of alcoholic beverage you won't be able to get it. The kitchen and tables are basically in the same area and I can hear the Latino kitchen staff cursing up a storm in Spanish as if no one would ever understand them. The kitchen staff should be told to be more professional at work and not use profanity at work which is a family restaurant. We ordered dessert, the chocolate cream puffs which were so great. Thumbs up for the dessert!!! We ordered coffee as well but we never got offered refills. As soon as the coffee was delivered we got the check so we felt rushed and it was not very busy at the time.

The sauce was creamy and just the right amount of herbs. My husband had the Napoletana pizza and it was one of the best pizzas we've ever had. The crust was buttery and flaky. \nWe enjoyed it so much that we went back another night before we left San Francisco and the owner actually recognized us as we walked up!

I even worked across the street from Mona Lisa for awhile, and I never got the opportunity to try the dining experience here.  Today, visiting on vacation with my family, that all changed, and I'm so grateful.  Having been here a week, we've had many interesting dining experiences.  On the last night of our vacation, I wanted to take our family (visiting from out of state) and local San Francisco guest to a place that would make our time here mean something.  Tonight, Mona Lisa delivered.  When I called for a reservation early in the day, I was greeted with kindness and positivity.  We walked in at 6:30 and we were greeted again with the same upbeat kindness as I experienced on the phone.  We were led to a beautiful and comfortable table and promptly offered drink and menu choices.  They then brought a complimentary antipasti platter, which was delightful.  I have to say, the experience was seamless.  From drinks to apps, to salad, to main course, I was so impressed with how well everything flowed.  I waited tables in this town for years, and I was touched to be in an establishment where pride in service and quality of food still mean something.  If we were just adults dining here, it would be easy.  But in addition to impressing us, they managed to delight and impress my two small children as well.  I had the gnocchi.  I'm so glad I saved half of it.  It was so good, I look forward to eating the other half for breakfast.  My family raved about how delicious everything was.  Even though we were totally full, we had to order a Tiramisu to share.  I'm so glad we did.  It was perfect like everything else.  As we were leaving, the owner was so kind, inviting us to visit again.  I was looking for the right place to completely make our last night in SF memorable, and from beginning to end, Mona Lisa delivered.  They are humble, elegant, fun, and delicious.  It will be a destination stop on every visit from now on.  Thanks Mona Lisa!  You keep my faith in the heart and soul of a city I truly love.  Great job.", "author": "Gabrielle W."}

Entree recommendations were spot on!!!\nThere was plenty of food, fairly priced and an overall great feeling. We felt welcomed, not rushed. Would suggest this place anytime and I plan on revisiting when other guests arrive.", "author": "Karen G."}

We made reservations 3 months in advance because we were worried about the Vday rush. Luckily they seated us immediately next to the window even though we were an hour early. The seating was pretty cramped and the tables were so tiny that there was hardly any room for the bread and our two entrees. I think the decor was too cluttered so it was kind of distracting.\n\nOther than that, this place is a definite must if you're a risotto-fiend like me, because they have at least 20 different selections to choose from on the menu. I gotta give them props on their menu because it was kind of hard to decide what you want cause the menu they show on yelp does not compare to the lengthy amount they actually offer at the restaurant.\n\nI ended up getting the crab and asparagus risotto and boy was that plate larger than I was expecting. Still had enough to take home for leftovers! When it was served the food was still steaming hot, freshly cooked from the kitchen and was absolutely scrumptious. The risotto was mouthwatering and as soon as you take a bite, it's just heavenly because it had such a creamy consistency. Finished the night off with a cappuccino tartufo, which was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nI highly recommend this place, because of the intimate ambiance, friendly staff, and the food is just too delicious to pass up!", "author": "Alexis A."}

My husband loved his prosciutto calzone, and my friend liked his gnocchi pomodoro. You get complimentary bread, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. \n\nCONS: The service! \n1. We went today around 1:30. It was not busy at all...one other group of 4 was there at that time. It got busier about 30 minutes after we had sat down. First, the restaurant was open for business, but the door was locked. We knocked, looked confused, and no one came to open the door for us. We finally got in because a customer came out of the restaurant. No one greeted us, and we were standing there for a few minutes before being seated. He told us from across the restaurant to sit anywhere. He could have at least come to the door where we were standing. Then during our meal, we saw the same \"lock out\" incident happen to a woman and her 2 children. They were locked out of the restaurant and her husband and friends were already at the table (I saw him flag her through the window to let her know where they were seated. The woman was knocking and waving through the glass window door, while the server was looking at her and made eye contact with her and blatantly IGNORED her! My husband got up and opened the door for her. \n\n2. It took about 30 minutes before we got our order taken. Additionally whenever we thanked the server for anything he brought us, we were ignored. My linguini tierra was just okay....not bad, but not great. I wouldn't order it again. I'd rather try something else.  \n\nOVERALL, the food was not bad, but based on the service I would not come back here for a long time. I will try other restaurants in the area first. Too bad, because they have a large menu and their pizzas actually look quite good. I am curious to try one.....but the service was unwelcoming, and we felt uncomfortable (as if we were a burden to the server).", "author": "Ashley D."}

We have had the apps (they have a sampler of all the apps...it is 3 tiers of different appetizers if you can't decide) and I have had the veal...yum! I have also just gone for a glass of wine and am still welcomed as I'm enjoying a full course meal with am entire party. Some places rush you out if you aren't having a full meal and spending money, but not this place. Come in for a meal, snack or just a glass of wine. If it is nice out definitely try and sit outside.

With a mini wooden Italian car parked outside and every inch of wall space inside covered in Italian paraphernalia, this place is definitely quirky and what we were looking for.\n\nDespite the cramped seating, the service was great. The temp inside was insanely hot; halfway through the meal they finally turned the AC on. \n\nAlthough the bread came out cold and bland, the rest of the food was delicious. And the portions were just perfect, so four out of five cleaned their plates. Three types of ravioli were ordered; I thought it was cool that they were all different shapes. My chef friend was disappointed that the ravioli was not fresh made and was instead from the freezer (detectable by a tough freezer-burned piece). Interestingly, the menu only listed \"homemade\" next to a couple of the ravioli dishes (including mine). The sauces were tasty and I especially liked my \"Ravioli ai Quattro Formaggi\": creamy and rich. I added Italian sausage, which probably would have worked better in a red sauce, but I needed my meat.\n\nPrices were pretty high, especially if some of the dishes are actually defrosted and served.

(Note: if you are going to BBB, make your reservation for 2 hours after the show start time). They were extremely crowded, yet did their best to seat all comers, and were very accommodating to us, even though we were 35 min early for our reservation. \n\nOnce we were seated, the server was gracious and prompt, nothing like some of the reviews here. The owner also came over a couple of times - once while we were waiting, and once while we were eating, and also while we were waiting. Everyone who worked there was calm and hospitable. The first thing the server said when we sat down, after asking us if we had to wait a bit, was \"I will do my best to make it up to you now\". \n\nThe food was delicious and plentiful - probably the best and most important part of the review!  We started with Calamari and Bruschetta, and then we each had either salads or pasta for our entrees. Everyone left happy and felt like it was a great North Beach experience- not easy to achieve on a cold, rainy, crowded holiday evening!", "author": "Laurie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "I go here when I am in North Beach and want to sit outside and feel like I am in Italy watching people and listening to the people have a coffee and speak Italian. North Beach is known for Italian restaurants, but many of them are as authentic as The Olive Garden. Food-wise Mona Lisa isn't exactly what you'd find if you went to Rome ... but close enough where its a good place for Itali-o-philes can get their fix of Italy.\n\nSure, they have a young guy from Italy standing outside like a Carnival barker trying to get tourists in for lunch or dinner. He uses such cliches as 'We have an ah special -ah menu ... We made it ah just-a for you!' That usually defines a tourist trap. But here, it sort of works. I saw him pull in a few couples in Teva sandals and cargo shorts who flew into his web of Italian bravado salesmanship. In the long run they are lucky he got them and not a few of the places across the street who's food is blah.\n\nThe taste of the food is great here ... it isn't the freshest ingredients you'll find in North Beach (go to North Beach Restaurant for fresh) but it isn't the worst Italian food you'll have either (Colliseo across the street uses hamburger alone in their bolognese sauce). They do tend to load up with the cheese ... probably a little too heavy. But, the food here never tastes bland, which is the problem of many places on this street.\n\nThe outdoor tables are small and indoors is cramped and dark. But, I would say one of your best bets at getting a true North Beach Italian restaurant experience and getting good food as well would be Mona Lisa. Many Italian ex-patriots eat here (or at least sip coffee or wine on an outside table). More concerning is that I have noticed a few Italian ex-patriots eating subs from next door while drinking that wine and coffee at Mona Lisa. That may have something more to do with the tourist prices ($16.50 for a plate of pasta ... owch!) than the food quality. (I hope)\n\nOver the past few visits, I have noticed that the portion sizes have gone down. Now a $16.50 plate of pasta comes in a big plate with a little bowl section in the middle. You essentially pay an entree price and get a first course serving. I always stick with the pastas although I have heard they do a good rissotto.\n\nAt first, the menu was a bit concerning ... usually any place that offers the same menu for dinner and lunch and offers no less than 40 different menu items like a cheesecake factory throws up a huge red flag to me. But, I have to admit, I've tried different things and they all came out pretty well.\n\nSkip the overpriced desserts.\n\nThe biggest dissapointment here is they pour minescule amounts of wines and charge $9 per glass for the cheapest wine (chianti). If you are going to charge almost $17 for a small plate of pasta and $9 for a glass of wine, how about pouring it at least half full?\n\nYou could do better for Italian food ... but not in North Beach. Mona Lisa is a winner. Rosa Pistola probably has the best Italian food I've seen in North Beach ... but Mona Lisa is more comfort food and less gourmet.", "author": "E T."}

As delicious as they are, they are very rich and cheesy, It'd be good to get this if you were sharing with someone. The pizza was thin crust, crispy, tasty sauce and full of flavor from the veggies and meat, One of the pizzas is a good portion size, good for 2 people.

The spaghetti was the best we've ever had, and hubby *always* gets spaghetti & meatballs when we eat Italian so we had a lot to compare to. My tortellini was amazing but it was my bad for adding Parmesan cheese to my cheese tortellini which was covered in cheese sauce--a bit too salty for my taste.

I passed Mona Lisa Restaurant and looked through the open windows to see beautiful chandeliers and ornately painted ceilings. That was enough to pique my interest!\n\nThe menu looked to have the standard fare and the wait was only 10 min, so it was decided. When we were seated, the positioning of the table was not ideal; I was sitting in a high traffic area for the wait staff. But I pulled close to the table and made the best of it.\n\nThe wait staff were courteous and as attentive as they could be on a busy Saturday night. The kitchen really seemed slow and it took a while for us to get our food. I'm not sure if they were unorganized or if they were just slammed, but for a pasta dish the wait was longer than expected.\n\nI ordered the Penne al Forno alla Calabrese, a baked penne with meat sauce, ham and mozzarella. It was piping hot when it arrived at the table, much to my pleasure. It was overall enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall, I think Mona Lisa is pretty standard Italian food. It was good, but didn't knock my socks off.\n\nPerhaps next time I'll follow my nose!", "author": "Greg S."}

Their menu is so extensive it's almost impossible to even figure out what to order. I don't think that's a bad thing I like a lot of variety on my menu I was immediately brought out bread with a huge thing of water the servers were very very professional I actually even ordered a bottle of wine, which was very very good tasting, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted. So I finally decided on crab ravioli and a pink sauce. Although it was not in a pink sauce the sauce was very salty for my liking. The crab in the ravioli was very fishy tasting and I don't like that, I probably should have gotten something different I did eat all my food though except the sauce. I'm sure if I went back I would have pick something along the lines of an Alfredo I was hoping my food had a lot more flavor like garlic basil the typical Italian flavors it was lacking. It was nice to try a new Place but I wouldn't highly recommend there. Also it was quite expensive probably cuz my $40 bottle of wine otherwise their hospitality was excellent. I'm giving 3 stars just because the decor it is very beautiful.", "author": "Mary G."}

We had reservations, but arrived a bit late (about 15 minutes).  The host was nice but the manager seemed to want to 'punish' us for being late.  At least that was the gist of what I overhead in Italian.  (So, if you make reservations, be on time!) \n\nThe decor is nice, though.  You do feel like you are in a restaurant in Italy, but on a weekend night people are really packed in.  Of course, that is a lot like Italy, too.  :-)\n\nMaybe I just ordered the wrong dish on this trip, but I was not impressed.  I usually like their pasta dishes but all of the pasta dishes we ordered on this trip seemed to be a bit short on flavor.  With so many great restaurants in North Beach and San Francisco, we probably won't be back to Mona Lisa anytime soon.  At least not on a weekend night.", "author": "Jim M."}

The area has become so toursity (and seedy with all the nearby strip clubs).  I liked the decor so came inside and was dismayed to see \"$12 per person minimum\" on the menu.  I nearly left but we decided to stay. The cheese pizza was odd , with a liquidy pool of milky cheese on top making the crust soggy. Having just returned from Italy I can assure you it was NOT authentic nor was it really recognizabe.\n\nThe arugala salad was excellent (with capers and lemon) although a little light on the fresh shaved parm.\n\nFor a small pizza, arguala salad, cup of tea, and 2 milks for the kids I felt like we paid WAY too much.  Mona Lisa is a tourist trap I'd recommend you avoid.\n\nNext time I'm in the area I'll be sure my YELP app is working (sadly, it wasn't loaded right on my phone) and if in doubt, I'll try for a side street over the main drag.", "author": "Kara T."}

The menu is very extensive and portions are large, with each plate approx. $17. There were only 3 or 4 tables so we had excellent service. Our server and busser were both very friendly and attentive. Our drinks and basket of hot bread arrived quickly, and our appetizer came out fairly quickly as well.\n\nThe dessert menu was fabulous, and all desserts are $8. I purposely didn't touch any bread, and took it easy with the calamari and my pizza so I could indulge.  \n\n They offered to box up our leftovers, which we declined as we had a flight to catch. Wasn't expecting that, but was very impressed. Heated seating outside. Here's our notes:\n\nCaesar salad - homemade croutons, lots of dressing if you like that. \n\nCalamari Fritti- Light crispy coating, these were delectable.\n\nPizza Napoletana- crispy crust, but pales in comparison to Tony's, which I had the day before. Cheese, garlic and tomato blend was perfect but will not order this again. Next time I'll try the Margherita.\n\nGnocchi Fondenti- If you can't get enough cheese, then this one's for you as it was dripping with cheese! This is a light fluffy gnocchi, not as doughy as we had a few days earlier at Fior. It was softly tender and melted in my mouth!\n\nChicken Parmigiana- small portion with no pasta, accompanied with decent potatoes and spinach. Lightly breaded and very tasty. \n\nTiramisu- Lovely, light and  heaven in your mouth. Always the perfect end to a wonderful Italian meal.\n\nChocolate Protiferoles - these little cream puffs were smothered in chocolate - OMG I thought I was going to have to buy an extra plane ticket for my ever expanding fat arse!\n\nChianti - how do you screw this up? Large wine glasses - gotta love that! After the Chianti, we had another red, Valpolicella Cesari which was excellent. \n\nLoved this place!

My friend and I were on the prowl for Italian and came across this place. It looks small from the inside but its quite roomy once you walk in. We were seated promptly and the customer service was on point. The man who seated us stands out in front and greets guest....luckily for me he also helped scare away the meter maid! Thank you! Who puts 30 minute MAX meters on streets w/tons of restaurants?! Ridiculous! I had to go out to my car every 30 mins to ante up on the meter! YIKES! Almost didn't enjoy my lunch BUT I still did!!!! Muahahaha. Here's what we ordered:\n\n-Fried calamari $13.95\n-Risotto Pescatore $16.95\n-Linguini alla silana $13.95\n-1 coke\n-1 sprite\n\nKeep the bread, butter and vinegar & EVOO cominnnn'!!!!! :)\n\n-Fried calamari was pretty tasty and the portion was HUGE. My friend and I added a ton of crushed red pepper to the marinara sauce. Spicier is always better! \n-The Risotto was sooooo bomb! Best Risotto I've ever had! My friend who is in love w/Risotto absolutely fell in love with it. It was very creamy and cooked to perfection. Some places cook the Risotto way too long and it loses the Risotto rice texture but Mona Lisa did it perfectly. No wonder it took awhile for the main dishes to come out. It was worth the wait!\n-The linguini alla silana was very good also. It definitely tasted home made for some reason! Hahahaha. The mushrooms and eggplant went so wonderfully w/the sauce. It was delectable! Momomomom.\n\nOne complaint...\n#1. The restaurant obviously is pretty famous because there were photos of celebs up everywhere who have eaten at Mona Lisa! Which was fun to look at. However, I felt very clustered and bunched in. Too many tables crammed into one restaurant....half the time I was trying to zone out other tables conversations and listen to my friend talk. It felt intimate but invasive at the same time. BUT it also ment that Mona Lisa probably gets very very busy! Personally, for me...the tables were put too close together\n\nAll in all definitely go try Mona Lisa.

Overall the evening was a hit with my party of 7, with just a few minor negative points. After I polled my party, their grades ranged from B to B+, which totally agreed with.\n\nReservations at 8pm, got there a few minutes before and was immediately seated. Bread and water was quickly brought. Dinner napkins were placed in our laps. \n\nStarted with their Italian sampler. It had bruschetta, tomatoes caprese and roasted garlic. Everything was done fine, with fresh ingredients. We also had the fried calamari which was ok. Nicely fried although not much flavor, but it was ok. Soon afterward the manager/host decided to send a complimentary appetizer tray our way. Whatever the reasons - whether just being nice or it was a kitchen mistake that he wanted to give to us, I really appreciated the gesture, and it earned some major brownie points with me. The appetizer plate had some more bruschetta, some olives, some parm-reg cheese, and some prosciutto. I enjoyed the prosciutto and the rest, although the extra food really filled me up and left less room for the main courses!\n\nI ordered 5 entrees to share so we could all get a taste of more items.\n\nThe Spaghetti Carbonara (pancetta, eggs and cheese) was awesome. Perfectly cooked, creamy with a nutty/salty from the pancetta.\n\nThe Gnocchi Pomodoro (tomato sauce and basil) was my (and everyone else's) least favorite dish. Granted, I'm not a big gnocchi fan, but the times I've had very good gnocchi it was light and puffy. Here is was a bit doughy. But I'm the first to admit that gnocchi is not my favorite, so you might try it yourself and like it.\n    \nThe risotto porcini (mushroom) was creamy and delicious. Just the right amount of flavor from the broth. It was good, very good.\n\nThe chicken piccata was also pretty good. The chicken was moist and tender, and the potatoes and spinach on the side had very good flavor. My wife finished all the spinach and loved it. \n\nThe pizza Napoletana (basic with cheese/tomato/oregano/garlic) was done very well. Good crust and good flavor.\n \nService was friendly and efficient, especially the host. Waiter helped exchange plates, refilled water and was generally very effective. Only a few missteps:\nThe appetizers came in a quick manner, but the rest of the meal took a bit longer. Not 'look at watch several times and frown' long, but 'look at my watch and wondering' long. Also it took a long time to get my bill. I think they use an old, old credit card machine. Bread was served cold. A bit pricey. Yes a few minor gripes, but overall their ambiance, service and food will make me visit again.", "author": "Dom L."}

The only reason I cannot give five stars is because before our meals came, a server walked up to our table and took the oregano off our table to give to another party. I understand the other party's needs but the server could have taken one from the back. When our food arrived, we had to ask to have it back.

We ordered a dish of risotto and I ordered a simple tomato basil pasta... terrible! The foods tasted like it was in the fridge then heated up on high heat. The pasta tasted like it was either undercooked or overcooked, we couldn't tell, but it was doughy and weird tasting. I saw the cooks taking the tomato sauce out of a container and heating it up on top of the pasta. I'm sure this is a great restaurant, or maybe my tastebuds are wrong, but we def didn't enjoy our meal. I think the owner came up to us and saw my place still full, and said in a cute Italian accent \"please finish, for me, please eat\" *hand gesture for eating*. =].

I thought it was pretty good. However, the potatoes were quite salty.  \n\nThe waiter seemed like he was in a rush. He came and took our dishes without really gesturing whether we were ALL finished with our dishes. My friend still had food on her plate, but she was pretty much done.\n\nWhen it came time for the bill, the waiter jotted down the wrong prices on both of my friends orders. Their dishes were a few dollars less than what he initially wrote. When we asked him about it and showed him the menu price, he told us that it was busy and they calculated them by hand. Fine, but he only corrected one of the dishes and not the other. He was so in a rush that he did not correct the entire bill to what it was suppose to be. So we took the time to calculate it ourselves. \n\nDespite of the ending, I would maybe consider coming back because there is such a huge selection of dishes here and the dish I had was good.", "author": "Mandy D."}

So last night a group of us went to dinner here before we were going to dance the night away at Dragon Bar (look at my review there).  Let's break it down.\n\n~ Neighborhood ~\nSituated in the heart of North Beach, it's one of your busier restauarants.  It's right across from Steps of Rome on the corner of Columbus and Vallejo.\n\n~ Parking ~\nThere are a few parking places.  The China Town Parking Garage charges $2 for every 30 min.  NOT WORTH IT.  Go a few more blocks north to the Vallejo Garages where it's $3 every hour (first hour is $1, past that from 1-2 hours it's $3, 2-3 hours $6, etc).\n\n~ Restaurant Atmosphere ~\nThe restaurant has, as my friend stated, a European feel.  Many tables are set up, close to each other, and it feels like you're in an alleyway in Italy.  Also all the Italian being spoken was great.\n\n~ Food ~\nThey give you lots of bread which my friends devoured as we were waiting for our food to come out.  I got the Grilled Mixed Seafood Entree.  It came on a sizzling plate with potatoes, spinach, salmon, 2 shrimps, and tuna steak.  Nothing special actually.  I felt it was overpriced grilled seafood.\n\n~ Service ~\nSlow...but I think that's to be expected.  It was prime time dinner and it's in North Beach.  It took maybe half an hour to get our food.  We were so hungry.  \n\nI just feel like I can get the same quality food, better service and at cheaper prices...but again this is North Beach.", "author": "Carolen M."}

Loud,  obnoxious  hip hop music.  What kind of \"authentic\" Italian place doesn't play Italian music? The decor was also very tacky and worn down. \n-the service.  It took nearly 25 minutes for our server (Maria D) to bring bread and take our drink order. We asked her 4 times to refill our drinks (1 coffee and 1 iced tea),  and she never did.  She was rude,  slow,  and never checked on us once. When we asked her to split our bill (2 ways) she refused.  After some convincing she did,  and on the check it had an area for where the check was to be split.  She was just being lazy. \n-the food. I cannot speak for the rest of my party,  but my over priced spaghetti and meatballs was absolutely awful.  Sauce definitely came from a bottle. The bread we had at the beginning was stale and tasteless. \n\nI will never return to this awful restaurant and highly recommend avoiding it.

He kept suggesting an antipasti dish so finally we asked which one was good and he said the bruschetta and the antipasti platter. Some sort of miscommunication happened then and he said ok...I'll get those for you. This ended in me chasing him down and explaining that we just wanted the antipasti platter and not to spend over $50 on just appetizers. \n\nThe antipasti platter turned out to be a tray of lunch meat and some tiny pieces of cheese with some teanie tiny olives for around $20. \n\nBy the time we got to that point in the meal we decided to forfeit and get our check (which visably upset him because he was thinking we were getting pasta). Oh well.\n\nI'm sure this place is amazing, but my experience was just one of the worse ones. My favorite thing about italian restaurants is the servers because they're usually so nice and friendly.

I was worried because it looked small and we were going to have seven people. When a gentleman from the restaurant approached me outside one day, I asked if that was OK and if we could make a reservation. He said it would not be a problem, and gave me his business card. The next day I called and made the reservation. I ended up having to change it to eight people, and they were still able to accommodate us. \n\nThe pace of the meal was great; the service was adequate but not above and beyond; but the food? Absolutely amazing! I have been home for a few days and I'm still thinking about it! I will definitely go back next time I visit San Francisco. \n\nHere's a list of some things my party ordered, and I will also post pics:\n\nAppetizers:\nCalamari Fritti - 13.95\nTomatoes Caprese - 12.95\n\nDinners:\nTortellini al Gongorzola - 13.95 - My vegetarian friend ordered this, although there are lots of vegetarian options. I went with the gnocchi but this one tasted great too! Everyone wanted to taste everything so there was a lot of sharing taking place. \nGnocchi Ruggero - 16.95 - I had this. It was gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese sauce, walnuts and spinach -- HEAVEN! \nGnocchi Fondenti - 14.95 - Baked four cheese-cream sauce with nutmeg. For some reason the baked dish seemed to come in a smaller portion. My friend had asked about sharing this with her husband, and the waiter rightly recommended against it. However, my portion for the Ruggero was definitely enough to have been shared. \nRavioli Aragosta - 16.95 - Lobster in tomato cream sauce. Two in my party ordered this and I had a couple bites. It was also fantastic. \n\nWe skipped dessert because we were off to Ghirardelli for ice cream, which I'll probably Yelp next. Definitely try the gnocchi or ravioli if you go -- Mona Lisa does it right!\n\nWhy not five stars? The place only has beer and wine, and for beer Peroni hardly counts. Sorry. I did have an Anchor Steam, though. Can't go wrong with that. I did wish they had some fancy pre-dinner mixed drinks or martinis, though. Also, the waiter said it would be a $3 refill for sodas. I don't know if we were not charged after all because my party really wasn't happy with that and they might've overheard, but yeah, that's just kind of ridiculous if that rule is actually enforced.  Lucky for us, it wasn't. \n\nTo address some other minor complaints from fellow Yelpers, I found the decor cheesy yet entertaining. It made the place fun. As for the space issue it's San Francisco. Every restaurant I've been to there has tables close together you just sort of have to deal; at least they took our reservation and hooked us up with a nice long table in the back.\n\nThe Verdict: Just thinking about that gnocchi makes my mouth water.

If I get really going on this place, I'll have to write a book.\nMy wife said her spinach salad was make out of leaves that she would have thrown out.\nI ordered Oso Bucco in a \"white wine sauce\". When it came it was totally smothered in a brown, gravy-like substance and had the appearance of a cow pie. Seriously, whatever meat was under the \"gravy\" was cooked to smithereens, was tough and way too salty. I asked our waiter about the \"white wine sauce\", and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He said he'd check and came back to me saying \"yes that's the wine sauce.\" Even he looked surprised.\nMy wife had a salmon & pasta dish that she said was terrible. I REALLY wish I could say somehting nice about this restaurant, because we enjoy going to SFO for lunch in North Beach and have rarely had a bad meal in that area. \nThe 5 star reviews for this  place make me wonder if we just got a very bad day or what.

Yet they try to cram us in a tiny two top with no room, so we move. Slightly annoying, no biggy though. Our server comes by and takes our drink order, she didn't tell us her name though, and comes back and we order an app. She then comes back and takes our order, we decided to split a pasta dish and I asked her to ask the chefs to make it spicy. She then proceeds to point at the crushed red pizza pepper at the table and says \"you have those.\" Unreal and so so rude. We tried to look past it. The antipasto was okay, no salami tho. And the pasta was fine, a tad under cooked, expensive though at $28 especially since we were not given any utensils to crack and extract the crab from the shells with. Anyways, we tried to just finish and go but as we were eating two male servers were literally YELLING at the top of their lungs in italian I believe, at each other across the dining room to the point where multiple parties were looking up disturbed. Another side note, servers were walking in and out the door with their aprons on which is unsanitary. Needless to say, we won't be returning. Food is good but service is not worthy of the money.

I came here with a 2 of my girlfriends after a long day in the city. The neighborhood is in Little Italy..not exactly too appealing at night. It's very crowded, and busy so be aware. The man who sat outside (I believe he was the manager) was sitting us, and he was very friendly. He gave us a free appetizer on the house; he was sweet and welcomed us in right away.\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant, it's heavy and very decorative. I felt like I was literally in Italy. You can see many pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the walls. I guess this place is pretty famous? The tables are all super squished together so if you stand up, you're probably standing in the way of the waiters. By the way, the employees treated us so nicely..double tip for them!\n\nThe menu contains around 300 different dishes so you can't really pick a \"favorite.\" We actually asked the waiter for help, and he answered that there's too many to name. it really depends on your taste buds. I got the Penne Salsa Rosa and the sauce was very savory. It contained bits of tomato inside, and it's even better with the cheese that the waiter puts on top. My friends got the Spaghetti al Pomodoro (it was just regular spaghetti with marinara sauce..nothing special) and a gnochhi dish (a bit heavy if you ask me).

We both agreed that it was a full meal with the baguette slices that were provided.  My daughter ordered, the California Pasta was creamy and rich and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  To finish our meal, we shared a delicious hazelnut dessert.\n\nThe service was attentive and but not overly so.  Once, when I was looking around the restaurant, the waiter came over to see if we needed anything.  He and the others are Italian and were friendly and charming.

If you went early enough (around 5pm exactly) you could get the early bird specials.  Well Mona Lisa lured us in one of our first trips and since then, whenever we're in the city, we try to make a stop there.  \n\nUnfortunately I don't think they do that early bird special anymore but it doesn't look like they need to.  The place always seems to have a crowd and we usually have to make reservations nowadays if we can't get there early enough to walk in.\n\nWhat caught our attention, you ask?  Well the friendly staff for one.  We were going so regularly that they would hook us up with free appetizers.  Unfortunately for us, we were picky back in the day and wouldn't eat bruschetta.  It became like an episode of Mr. Bean with us hiding our food around the table so it would look like we ate it.  Over time, we now of course love it and wish we could take back those free orders.  In addition, they have the most AMAZING FOUR CHEESE sauce.  Yum!  I could live off of cheese and this sauce proves it.  You can basically order any pasta with it though we usually alternate between the tortellini or ravioli.  I prefer the latter but it is extremely rich as it is a cheese ravioli.  Their cheese sauce has driven us to try and recreate our own at home... we've found a good substitute, but we'd rather just go to Mona Lisa.\n\nWe've brought friends here who have tried other things off of the menu.  We have too, but every time, we always go back to the four cheese.  Even our friends have been amazed by how delicious it is.

When I walk into any restaurant I expect to be greeted warmly, chatted up by the waiter (usually), and then left the hell alone to enjoy my meal. It is the Austin way. \n\nI was in town for some training and a colleague and I, on recommendation of another colleague, stumbled to Mona Lisa for dinner. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to masticating my food, and whenever I'm in an italian restaurant I'll scarf down on Eggplant ANYTHING.\n\nAfter pouring over the menu (because it has multiple pages all in phrases like \"Eggplant -insert italian word here that Blair doesn't know-\") I finally decided on the Parmigiana di Melanzane. I was BLOWN AWAY by how insanely delicious this dish was! All it was seemed to be thinly sliced eggplant delicately layered across each other to form a bit of a dome, then a divine marinara sauce was covered with Parmesean and Mozzerella strewn throughout. \n\nI say, \"All it seemed to be\", but let me tell you, dear yelpers, that it was enough! My face about exploded in happiness. The tanginess of the sauce combined with the tenderness of the eggplant and creaminess of the cheese seriously transported me to Italy. Our waiter was incredibly sincere and nice, and the doorman had quite the crush on my colleague and gave her his personal \"calling card\" with his crazy italian accent at the end of the night. Dinner AND a show? I'll take it!\n\nLike I said, I live in Texas and I've legitimately thought about hopping on a plane back to SF to have a taste of this dish again. Weird? You betcha.

Way too much to choose from.\n\nNow, let's get to the food.  I finally settled on the lasagna.  It was basically a bowl of grease with some noodles and cheese swimming in it.  It was absolutely terrible and had zero flavor.  Knowing I was going to a show after dinner and wouldn't be able to eat for the rest of the evening, I tried to consume as much as I could so I wasn't starving later.  After about 5 more bites, I just couldn't stomach the grease anymore.  Thank God there was bread on the table to help fill up my empty  tummy.  \n\nBy the end of the evening-about 4 hours later, I finally made it home and not a moment to soon.  I barely made it home before I started getting sick!  Praying to the porcelain God on a Saturday night was not my idea of a good time, unless I had drank my night away and which case I would've accepted the punishment.

Seriously the best Italian food we've eaten ever, in our entire lives. First of all the menu is giant and wine selection vast. We shared a glass of the house red which was smooth and nice. My boyfriend had the chicken caccitora which he ordered on a bed of linguini and I had the 4 cheese ravioli in cream sauce. The entrees were bursting with flavor and the pasta was fresh and obviously home made. The portions were also huge! We had calamari to start with which were fried to perfection and came with extra lemon which is always a bonus in my book! We were just visiting and almost didn't eat here because of some of the yelp reviews but I'm so glad we did. We are both still talking about our meal there! I would totally recommend this place. Loved the lighting and ambiance too,  and the staff were very nice.", "author": "Jeanette L."}

Of course it's for tourists, but the locals can enjoy it as well.\n\nYou better have an idea of what you want to eat, it has the most offerings of an Italian restaurant I 've ever seen as it runs a couple of pages long in a small font.  I had a house salad, which I thought was tasty because they chopped the tomatoes up enough so you could really taste them. I had their cheese ravioli and osso buco (could have used more of what the dish is famous for). Both dishes were fine...but when I got the dessert menu was when I had my flashback - I was back in Rome - reading the dessert menu of about 15+ items - knowing they did not make their own desserts. Don't get me wrong. It made me wonder why their menu was so long - I hope their dishes are not premade and frozen - the food tasted fine and, frankly, if I'm in the mood, I love the Italian ornate scheme of the restaurant. \n\nThere were lots of people in and out so I don't know if it was a combination of tourists and locals.

We walked over there after consuming some delicious Dead Guys at the Rogue Public House. Unfortunately, it was closed. In our inebriated, famished state we looked around for the first place that looked decent. And there, before us was Mona Lisa. It looked clean, inviting and pleasant inside, so after checking Yelp to see that it had a decent 3.5 rating, we decided to give it a go. \n\nWe realized upon entering that there weren't that many people in the restaurant and all of the patrons were crammed in the front of the house to give the illusion of a very busy cafe. Oh well, we had a nice spot by the window. We ordered - garlic bread with cheese, Chicken Saltimbocca and Spaghetti Carbonara - really standard, generally very easy to prepare Italian fare. \n\nUgh. I'm still trying to shake the garlic bread. So unbelievably garlicky. So unbelievably bad. My pores are oozing garlic. My breath is so incredibly smelly and this, over 24 hours later. I don't know if the garlic was bad or if there was simply too much of it but it's a powerful stench. And I love garlic. \n\nThen the Spaghetti Carbonara. Salty. So salty. And then I found a giant piece of egg shell in my food (unfortunately too late, I was crunching on shell for the rest of the night). The Saltimbocca was watery, raw looking and had a smell to it. Not a pleasant saltimboccay smell. \n\nAnyway, we alerted the waiter to the shell in my carbonara. He apologized but that was it. No adjustment to the bill. 50 dollars later, I spent the plane ride home to DC gripping my stomach and hoping that my row partners couldn't smell the stench of garlic upon me.

Their cioppino is a repeat order. I love to order a side of cooked spaghetti to mix in with the soup once it's half eaten. Changes the meal a bit. \n2. Sicilian Candy (roasted whole garlic cloves) is also great used as a bread spread. \n3. They have plenty of wine to choose from, but I tend to stick with the Chianti Rufina. Something about Chinati and Sicilian/ Italian food is a must. \n4. The staff is awesome and the owner loves his heritage and conversation. \n\nI would love to sit in this restaurant all day and try a bite of everything for a more legit review, since they have so many different things to offer.", "author": "Rox T."}

Once we were done our pizza, he set up a plank/table above the front seats and gestured me to sit in the back of the car. That's where me and my friend ordered pizza and felt like celeb's while random people walking by started taking our photos. It was a hilarious, unforgettable experience with fantastic food and dessert.\n\nTaking away a star because the waiter seemed to ignore our request of no onions on the pizza - he was telling me it was good for my stomach and I had to have it.

Custom paint job with Mona Lisa on the Hood and all wood interior. It definitely attracts attention for the business. The place is filled with Italian memorabilia which gives it an authentic Italian feel. The fact that the staff all speak Italian does that as well. They have an extensive menu, but if you want something custom they will do that for you as well. So far, we have only made it through the first few pages and ordered the pasta dishes and they have been very flavorful. Good homemade pasta and excellent sausages. If you like good Italian sausage than by all means try theirs. Their wine selection is also favorable. Plan on spending an hour to an hour and a half for dinner just to enjoy the atmosphere.

My fiance's family has been going here for at least 7 years now, and it's our go-to Italian place when they visit us here in SF.\n\nYou CANNOT judge the food by the surroundings. The place is... over the top, to say the least. When they say Mona Lisa, they friggin' mean it. There is literally a ten foot Mona Lisa plastered to the ceiling. Ridiculously ugly murals everywhere, tons of autographed photos, dozens of random flags... they have found use for about 98% of all wall and ceiling real estate. I'm surprised they haven't started using the floor.\n\nALL of that being said - we love it here! The staff is excellent. They treat us like gold. Always very helpful, funny, and kind. They always seem to be hustling, but never once have we not been treated right. Smiles seem to be constantly draped across all their faces, and they treat each other like family. I can only assume some of them are.\n\nThe food is also great. The portions are, as expected based on the decor, massive and glorious. Huge plates, excellent sauces, and great, great veal. My personal favorite is the veal picata. The downside to their great food is the ridiculously overdone menu. Instead of just saying \"we have these ten sauces, these 5 noodle types, and these 8 meats\" they literally write down every possible combination. Just reading the menu is exhausting. \n\nOverall, I really like this place. The reasons they get docked a star - 1) the menu. 2) every time I take someone new here, I have to preface their terrible decorum. I feel like it's so overdone that it detracts from the place. Great food though, and I'll be returning for a long time coming.", "author": "Nick B."}

I -always- seem to stop in when I'm in town, but to be quite honest, there's something about the guy there that I just can't put my finger on.  As I was walking up the street, with every intention to stop in and order my favorite pasta dish, I encountered \"the man\" standing on the sidewalk chatting with passerby.  For whatever reason, I decided to go to Mona Lisa instead.\n\nThe first thing I loved was I did, indeed, get surrounded by thick accented waiters.  That didn't hurt my feelings at all.  I ordered a glass of Chianti and while perusing the menu, thought about going with veal (sorry Tina R.) but instead decided to compare a salmon pasta dish that was on their menu.  It sounded so similar to the dish I had planned on ordering at Franchino.  It wasn't even close.  I had to shake a little salt and pepper on it, and those are two ingredients I almost never use in restaurants.  This dish, the salmon with pappardale (sp?) noodles, fell flat.  It lacked much flavor other than the taste of the salmon.  There wasn't a garlicky, lemony, robust flavor that I'm used to.

After a brief conversation with the manager over our complimentary glass of wine, we were promptly seated.\n\nThe manager recommended bruschetta and calamari. When he saw that we only ordered the calamari, he brought us a plate of bruschetta to try. These unexpected treats where management goes out of their way to surprise and make you feel welcome are part of Mona Lisa's charm and uniqueness. This is true Italian hospitality. The Calamari Fritti was superb as well, and I'm picky with my calamari.\n\nBefore our main dish, we ordered a bottle of Merlot per the server's suggestion. We relied on the server because the wine list was so long. His recommendation was great; we went through 3 bottles of it over the course of our meal.\n\nFor my main dish I had the Lasagna al Pesto, which is cheese lasagna with pesto sauce. To die for. My friend Carl had the Tagliata di Manzo, steak with rosemary. Before he gobbled it down I had a couple bites. Simple, succulent, everything a steak should be. Just enough garnish to bring the taste out without distorting it; a fine balance.\n\nIt might have been because we ordered 3 bottles of wine :), but the manager insisted that he also treat us to dessert. He brought out homemade Tiramisu and Coppa Caffe, along with a cappuccino for each. I've bounced around North Beach for awhile and have yet to find better Tiramisu.\n\nAmbiance and mood were nice. The Mona Lisa painting on the wall demanded most of my attention. High ceilings are important to me (repressed claustrophobia perhaps?) and Mona Lisa provides enough breathing space for me to feel comfortable. The open kitchen is also a plus.\n\nMona Lisa is a place I'd bring a date or a few buddies. It's romantic and quiet in parts, but expansive enough that a larger table can raise the volume a bit.", "author": "Matt G."}

I am very pleased with their food! The Risotto was very delicious. It was creamy and had enough flavour. The garlic wasn't over-powering, but the cheese is heavy. (Sort of a given...) There's artichoke in this dish, and the pieces were pretty big...so if you're not a fan of artichoke, don't order the Risotto Carciofi. The Veal Mona Lisa was good, but the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. I prefer my meat more savory...but my boyfriend loved it! \n\nThe workers, overall, are very kind. We accidentally spilled vinegar (sorry guys!) and they were very calm about it. The only problem was probably the waiter. There was no lunch rush at the time we were going, but he was just impatient.

OH MY SWEET JEEBUS amazing.  Each and every dessert that was ordered was over the top yummy.\n\nThe only reason that they get 4 stars rather than 5 stars is because I find it a bit tacky that a male employee felt the need to use the ladies room rather than wait for the mens room to be available.  I wouldn't normally care, but my 13 year old neice \"had to go really bad\" and shouldn't have had to wait...  As an employee of the restaurant, he should have known better to survey the restaurant and realize that there were about 10 women at our table, 2 women in another party and only about 5 guys total in the restaurant not including staff.\n\nEven with that mishap, I'll definitely come here again.", "author": "Missy L."}

With so many Italian restaurants, we decided to give the Mona Lisa a shot. They also have a small yellow car parked in front of the restaurant, where you can take pictures and post it on Facebook. Cool. \n\nThe host (maybe the owner) was very friendly and seated us immediately. The restaurant is cute and is decorated with some autographed photos of celebs and paintings on the wall and the ceiling. We got free appetizers, which was cool; however, the garlic bread that came with was cold. Also, they only sell beer and wine. Not good when a member of the group is up for a mojito. The service was decent. We had to summon our waiter a few times and he almost forgot about our drinks when he brought our entrees out. \n\nAs far as the food, it was very good. There are no complaints about the food here. I ordered the chicken Stimbata (spelling is probably incorrect) with prosciutto and mozzarella baked in white wine. The chicken was moist and the prosciutto complimented to an already flavorful dish. My friend really, really enjoyed the linguine with scallops, but not the price. My wife ordered the spaghetti and she loved it. It was clearly that they made their own pasta sauce it was definitely full of flavor. \n\nIf you're in the mood for Italian, then give the Ristoratne Mona Lisa a try.

We'll probably come back here again and eat, but we'll also give other restaurants within the area an opportunity as well.", "author": "Albert B."}

This place has 20.  \n\nFirst let me start by saying that this isn't some smart, fancy modern restaurant with a celebrity chef where you will find the words compote, pork cheeks, crostini, aioli, micro-arugula or truffles on the menu.  They have no gimmicky mac & cheese sandwiches or Korean bbq sliders.  There is no Wagyu beef anything here.  This is an old fashioned Italian restaurant with old fashioned waiters in long aprons who call you Bella that have been there a WHILE and no paper to go menus.  There are no itemized credit card receipts.  You'll get one of those stubs ripped from the bottom of a check that your boss won't reimburse you for.  It'll take forever to get your check some nights and the decor is definitely OG.  \n\nThat being said, if you want an amazing old-fashioned Italian meal that you can't finish and if you're like me and love risotto, you'll love this place.  Parking can be a bitch, it takes a while to get your food sometimes and there are no to go menus that you can carry out.  The waiters will bend over backwards to give you great service, though and will always make you feel special.  \n\nMy favorite dish was the Risotto Linuccio (beef, mushrooms in a tomato cream sauce) about 5 other risotto dishes and 3 of the gnocci dishes.  My co-workers all had a favorite menu item here.  One guy swore that the pizza was the best.  Another lady wanted the lobster ravioli every day.  It was comfort food at it's best when we were working long hours.  The bread is delicious and the owner will often stop by to see how your food is.  \n\nLike some other reviewers, we were drawn in when the restaurant across the street was closed and the owner outside invited us to look at the menu.  The menu is huge and there was something on it that each of us could eat.  Score!  After eating here the first time and being treated so well, we decided to keep coming back.  \n\nThe place is pretty huge (cavernous in fact) and it often gets busy so don't expect super fast food.  If you can chill and enjoy a leisurely meal where you'll be treated special, you'll enjoy it here a lot.  \n\nThe only downside I can think of is that you can't get an itemized credit card receipt so our boss used to hassle us about turning the receipts in.

Over 50+ variations of spaghetti, penne, linguini, chicken, seafood, etc. etc!!! But I'm a very simple pasta person. Penne + red sauce + _______ = happy. \n\nAnd their food is decent! I forget the name of the dish that I ordered, but basically it's penne + chicken + red tomato sauce. The pasta is pretty decent, but I certainly don't think it's worth $16. I feel like I could get that for half the price. OH, and I wish my pasta was cooked a bit more. I like it a bit mushy, but it came out still pretty stiff. \n\nThis place is packed on a Friday night! I didn't get there until 8:30 (my friend had already gotten us a table about 15 minutes earlier), and pretty much ordered within 10 minutes. Yet, the food doesn't arrive until 40 minutes later. The ironic thing was that I was facing the kitchen, and the chefs  were working those pans non-stop!! I honestly didn't think the place was so big, but it's packed!! \n\nThis place is probably 3.5 stars, but I had to round down since the waiter also gave us the wrong bill.

The dessert was good-chocolate cream puffs with a chocolate sauce over them, but way too pricey. They charged us over $30. The lunch menu prices were reasonable, but this was ridiculous!\n  The Chef cooked in front of a long bar in the kitchen area and it was interesting and fun to watch him. The place is decorated like a restaurant in Italy and is very interesting.\n My other complaint is when I went in the back to use the restroom. The doors into both and men and women's restrooms were filthy and looked like they had not been cleaned in years. There was an old, dirty, torn rug inside the women's bathroom that should of been tossed away years ago.

My dinner companions had the chicken saltimbocca, risotto allo scoglio,  gnocchi in pink sauce, fettuccine pescatore, and the chicken S. Marino. If there was an award for second best dish at the table it would go to the S. Marino. It is rolled chicken breast with mozzarella and ham in a tomato-cream sauce, incredible flavors & texture. Even though no one at the table needed another bite of food, it wouldn't have been complete without dessert so we shared a platter of tiramisu & bomba. The tiny bite I managed to eat of the bomba was really good. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, patient, and spot on when helping choose menu items.

Well, to be fair, it was someone else's meal, but I can always be counted on to finish other's leftovers, especially when it's calamari! But no! This was the second worst calamari I've ever had (there was one time calamari made me throw up, and this didn't).\n\nBut yeah. Bread was stale, olive oil was old. Pizza was edible, but very soggy and sloppily put together. Even the service was slow, after luring people in with their charming Italian accents.\n\nThis is the definition of a tourist trap. The annoying person outside speaking Italian to tourists, the ugly neon sign, the tacky paintings on the inside....I've been to Italy and while there are restaurants there that look like Mona Lisa, they're still tourist traps with bad food. The best Italian restaurants in North Beach are not on Columbus, but there are a few good ones on Columbus, and if you must satisfy your people-watching urge, go to Calzone's or Pellegrini. I've heard Franchino right next door is quite good too.\n\nI guess the only reason to go here is that it is fairly reasonably priced, and with 200 different menu options (I got bored waiting for friends and counted), you're sure to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. But anytime you have more than twice as many types of food items as wine items, not a good sign.\n\nAnd if you want a truly authentic Italian experience that reflects Italy's commitment to using the freshest, most seasonal ingredients, go to Delfina in the Mission. where there's never more than 25 items on the menu and it changes every day to reflect what's in season.\n\nHaving an Italian accent or speaking Italian often has no correlation to the quality of the food, and is often even negatively correlated.\n\nThe Delfina folks don't have an Italian accent, nor do they only hire servers who speak Italian; and Thomas Keller speaks perfect English and seems to do French food pretty well.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone else notice how many 5-star reviews this place has from people who have never written another Yelp review....", "author": "Mark A."}

We weren't really sure where to eat, so we chose Mona Lisa after the guys out front lured us in--all it took was the availability to seat a party of 5 on the spot.\n\nThe menu was a little overwhelming at first, but you'll soon realize that everything is a variation of something else. I ordered the pesto tortellini, which was a little on the salty side. Everyone else seemed to like their dishes though (lobster raviolli, veal marsala, pumpkin raviolli, and a baked pasta and sausage dish). I guess I should have been more adventurous in my ordering.\n\nThe biggest downfall of this restaurant for me though was the service. Although we got seated quickly, the waiter rushed through our orders and didn't even ask if we wanted anything to drink besides water. Once our orders were taken, we didn't see him again until he came to pick up our plates. I had a little less than a third of my dish left and contemplated getting it boxed, but the waiter swept up my plate without asking if I wanted to pack it and quickly placed other dishes on top of it. Oh well--I guess I need faster reflexes. The waiter disappeared once again and didn't even suggest dessert for us. After several attempts of flagging him down, we finally got him to bring us our check. Lucky for me, my friend from out of town paid for my meal. Also thought it was weird that we were charged an automatic 18% gratuity for a party of 5 (didn't catch any notice on the menu).\n\nThere are so many Italian restaurants in North Beach that are bound to be much better, so I doubt I'll come back here again.

If you have ever been to Italy you would truly appreciate the restaurant and the owner. We were greeted outside and immediately sat down.   The restaurant was full with families and everyone was happy. The owner made sure to go around to each table as he spoke Italian. My friends and I had a great waiter who recommended a very good bottle of wine. We enjoyed appetizers and we all had pasta dishes. OUTSTANDING! We were not disappointed the fish was fresh and the pasta dishes were hearty and filling. Based on what we ate and also being in North Beach we thought our bill would be pricey. Surprise it was not.

The atmosphere is cute, and the waiters were attentive. I really enjoyed their Mona Lisa ties :)\n\nThe bruschetta appetizer was on the house, and we really enjoyed it. There are a good deal of entrees for about $15, and bottles of wine start around $40. Although reasonably priced, though, I was not overwhelmingly impresses by my entree, the meat lasagna. Rather than in a loaf it was overwhelmingly doused in meat sauce, and there was too much black pepper. The veggie lasagna and eggplant parm were served the same way, and my friends agreed that the food was ok, but not amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-09-13", "description": "One word:  AWFUL!  If I could give it negative stars I would.\n\nThis restaurant irritated me.  The food was horrible, the service was crap, and the atmosphere tacky.  Its worst than a tourist trap.  I've been here once before for a birthday party and it was not that bad.  We came here late on a whim because Franchino was closing and remembered that it was ok.  The minute we walked through the door, they weren't sure where to seat us, so we were standing in the way of all the service, while they were hashing it out in Italian.  \n\nI ordered a coke and it was totally flat, so I asked the bus boy to get another.  Because he doesn't speak English well, he just shrugged his shoulders.  I had to say \"there is no gas\" in the drink.  It seemed like he finally understood that and he took it away to bring another.  After 15 minutes, no new coke!  I then called the manager over for another problem.  I caught a baby cockroach under the lamp as it was running across our table.  Yuck!  The managers response, \"Oh we did not invite him tonight.  I give you complimentary meal.\"  At this point, I was so skeptical, that I knew the bill would not be adjusted.  Finally, got a coke \"with gas\" after telling the manager. \n\nOn to food... I asked the waiter if the rigatoni with sausage and eggplant had any cheese on it.  He said no, so I ordered it.  (I am lactose intolerant).  When the meals came, it was smothered with cheese.  It looked disgusting even if I could eat it that way.  I told the waiter that he said the dish came without cheese and his response, \"What? You don't like Mozzarella?\"  He finally seemed to understand when I said I was allergic and had one remade.  I seem to remember Mozzarella being in the cheese category.  This is where the Italian accent and language is not charming at all, if that is what you're into.\n\nMy husband's meal sucked as well.  They screwed up spaghetti and meatballs  - sauce was too watery and meatballs were tough, dry, and overcooked.  And the garlic bread, was worse than if you bought day old bread, hacked it up, and spread some year old margerine, and 10 year old garlic powder on it.  It was gross and bitter.\n\nAt the end of the meal the busboy gives us a tiramisu.  We told him we didn't order it.  He walks away, comes back and drops it on our table.  Again, told him we didn't order it and he shrugs his shoulders and practically runs away.  When the waiter came with the bill, we told him we didn't order the dessert and he tells us its complimentary.  Yea!  Here is our complimentary meal.  A sad looking piece of tiramisu that I can't eat because I'm lactose intolerant.  Thanks, but no thanks.  There's probably be a baby cockroach inside for a delightful surprise!  The waiter immediately took it back. \n\nLastly, during our meal, the manager and the cook (notice I don't say chef) were arguing loudly.  The cook was pissed about something and was slamming things around and throwing dishes down on the pick up line.  This kitchen is open to the restaurant so you can see everything.  It was really distracting.  \n\nAs predicted, full charge for the whole meal.  I was so irritated I didn't even want to argue with the manager and just paid the bill.  It was the most expensive crappy meal I've ever had.  $50 for 2 dishes, garlic bread and a coke.  I walked out really wishing we had gone to McDonalds and that is only in emergency situations.  I doggy bagged the rest of my meal and gave it to a stoned homeless guy on the street.  He'll probably eat it with no problems because he's stoned and has the munchies, not because he's homeless. \n\nIf you are not a tourist and you liked this place... Shame on you.  SF has so many other sub-par Italian restaurants that are better than this, never mind all the other awesome ones there are.  If you are a tourist, avoid this place like the plague.  Don't be conned by the ropers on the street with their Italian accents trying to pull you in.  Instead, only have coffee and dessert at a cafe here in North beach or see a strip show.  Then go to Incanto, in Noe Valley, for good italian.  Even Chris Constantino's Offal menu of organ parts will be richly more satisfying than Mona Lisa's awful S**T.

This review is delayed), I ended up choosing Mona Lisa - I can't really remember why.  I ended up having just a really weird experience here.  \n\nThere were about 10 of us, and we were seated right at the front at this awkward long table with a pathway behind it where waiters were constantly walking back and forth.  That alone wouldn't have been a problem, but the whole staff was so rude!  As soon as we sat down and before we really got a chance to look at the menu, a waiter came up to my friend who was sitting next to me and asked her if we'd like a sampler tray, in a very pressuring way.  My friend, who I'm guessing felt awkward with him hovering over her, said yes.  It wasn't until we looked at the menu that we realized the sampler platter was something like TEN DOLLARS A PERSON (this would be sixty dollars for our group), which the waiter conveniently neglected to tell us.  My friend flagged him down and asked him to please cancel, as we didn't know the cost of it when he asked us, but he told us that they already started cooking it so they couldn't cancel it???? \n\nThe meal pretty much went downhill from there.  The food was nothing special, and it was way too overpriced - I had the baked ravioli and they were pretty mushy and gross, and I don't think anyone was crazy about anything they got.  We mentioned it was my birthday and the waiters were super snotty about it, didn't say happy birthday or anything like that and it was just really uncomfortable.  \n\nI hate complaining about restaurants and I usually don't, but I just had to.

Despite booking a table for 11:30 on a Sunday, please be advised that Mona Lisa does not serve brunch.  It serves standard Italian fare.  Ok, that one is on me as I made a wrong assumption; however, the rest of the experience is on Mona Lisa.  \n\nWhen we arrived, despite us having reservations and the restaurant having only 2 other tables occupied at that time, they were not set up for our party of 6.  We waited while they set it up.  From the time we sat down until the time we were served was over an hour (no appetizer, just in desperate need of our main course).  This might not read like a long time in a review, but an hour is an extraordinarily long time when waiting for a meal.  I had to follow up on the whereabouts of our meal about 50 minutes in.  When the meal finally arrived after an hour, they served 3 of the 6 of us.  It took another 5-10 for the next 2 to be served.  When the final dish arrived (after now 5 of us had been eating for 10+  minutes), it was the wrong dish entirely.  That member of our party had to wait another 15 minutes for the kitchen to make him the correct meal.   The other two tables were not getting much better service.  Also, it bears mentioning that I indicated in our Open Table reservation that we were celebrating a birthday.  Nada.

Well Mona Lisa is A nice SONG. Mona Lisa the resaurant is A differant story  Mona Lisa is not A  nice. Mona lisa is nice and great and more.

Bread with butter untill I saw the olive oil and added the smallest splash of there great vinegar.

Mr. ant pot has Bruchetta,greens,cheese, cold cuts,olives and more and it's served taller than A cheapskates wedding cake.

My sister made some of the same and when she wasan't looking I threw it in the back yard and there where dead birds all around it the next day.

I've been coming to this restaurant for over two years, and have had a great time with every visit.\n\nMy boyfriend and I got pulled in like most people by the owner who stands outside... I just want to give him snaps for always standing outside EVEN when it's ridiculously cold!  That's commitment!  While the owner acted as ringleader pulling our attention, it was the extensive menu that really got us.  Brian (bf) LOVES gnocchi, and most Italian restaurants neglect that style of pasta.  There has to be at least 6 gnocchi options on that menu, and Brian has tried most of them, and enjoying most of them.  Let me just keep it real - he loves the cheesy ones.  He's a cheese man. :)\n\nI've tried out different pastas, and have fallen in love with the lasagna.  I jump back and forth from the veggie and the meat versions.  It's a pretty basic lasagna, and for those seeking 18 different cheeses and lots of different veggies... um, this lasagna is not for you.  It's cheese, meat, and noodle.  The flavors are good, and the plate is ALWAYS hot.  \n\nThe service can vary.  That place can get PACKED, so when service gets a little slow we're not surprised.  We're usually not rushing out of there either though - if you're on the go, this might not be the restaurant for you.  I personally love the over-decorated look, and pictures of  \"famous\" people that haved dined there.  (FYI- if you are a star wars fan, Chewbacca loves that place!) \n\n\nThe place is \"cozy\" as someone said earlier, so if you go - try and get a place in the back 1) it's warmer 2) the tables are bigger and not as tight. \n\nLong story short this place is a staple for me!

By cheese I mean terrible Roman art, funny little busts, and cute Italian waiters that call you \"Bella.\" With a name like Mona Lisa, how could it not be incredibly corny? Although I tend to run in horror at anything too touristy in this city (I think this has something to do with the fact that I am forced to take the cable car with many slightly inebriated, overly enthusiastic and often overweight tourists to get up the hill to my apt.), this restaurant always leaves me with the warm and fuzzy feeling of being treated to some true Italian hospitality. \n\nNo one can argue that the food itself isn't authentically Italian. Being a vegan and having been to Italy, I have tried many MANY different restaurants' versions of penne arrabiata, and this place makes a lovely one. The sauce is spicy and rich and flavorful. I like to add mushrooms to give myself a little protein, and they are very nice about this and add big juicy saut\u00e9ed brown mushrooms. They also have a nice bruschetta. I should mention that the menu is ginormous, as in it has every classic Italian dish and its dog, so creative vegans could probably find many choices. I remember one time they made me a very pleasant Italian bean soup as an appetizer, and I've also had a pasta with eggplant that was yummy.  \n\nMona Lisa has been my go-to North Beach place for several years, because it's cute and comfy, and there's usually not a long wait.

I think its location, for me, might be both it's greatest asset and it's downfall. But we'll get to that momentarily. \n\nThe Service: We were about 6 people and it took them about an hour to sit us down. The host was snobbish, fun, but definitely some one you'd expect to be guarding a treasure of a restaurant. We had to speak to the manager to let us sit on one of the many empty tables outside and drink wine. And drink we did.\n\nThe Space: Simply mediocre. Not bad, but nothing impressing. I'm sure a lot of American tourists who deem Italy as ethnic will probably enjoy it. The decoration inside is like a proud Italian-American exploded in there. There are Italian art pieces just about everywhere, and very nice lighting. Almost like Buca Di Beppo with a bigger budget.\n\nThe Food: Absolutely mediocre or less. The gnocchi tasted like it had been sitting somewhere forever. The ravioli was from the frozen food section of Trader Joe's. One of the staff, having asked him in his native tongue, even told me the sauces came from cans. I'm not particularly blown away by Italian cuisine, but come on, you can't really be in North Beach and claim to have authentic Italian cuisine, then serve me frozen and canned food. The $30 bottles of wine were also mediocre\n\nThe Ambient: Mostly tourists and your daily, every day San Franciscans. A lot of bad dates and awkward silent tables, as well as large dinner parties. I hate to say it, but the people that night were also mediocre. No one looked particularly fabulous and there were large groups of annoying people thinking they were trendy because they were eating in North Beach.\n\nThe Veredict: I'm not saying this place is bad. It's just definition of a mediocre restaurant trying to sell itself as a trendy. I guess that was my biggest problem with it; the fact that the servers were well dressed, that the host was very snobbish, that the prices were so elevated and that it was on a main street -- completely over-promising and under-delivering. The canned/frozen food itself was not bad. As a matter of fact I had a tomato and basil that I rather enjoyed and tasted quite fresh. And I am willing to throw down some good money for some good food. But this place was simply too much and not enough.", "author": "SF N."}

Every time I've been here, the servers have been very friendly and accommodating.  Having worked in a restaurant before, I know how difficult this can be, especially when you work in a touristy area.  So the service itself in terms of the servers' attitude gets five stars.

It feels like a crowded tourist trap.  There also tend to be annoyingly loud groups of people eating here.  The reason I don't really like this place is its other patrons.  If they would just stay home, then I'd give this place four stars.  The other negative is the time it takes to get your food.  The first few times I ate here, we got our food pretty quickly.  The last two times?  Wow, it took forever.  The servers were very apologetic about this, so that was good, but I can't eat apologies, so the wait time definitely gets one star.\n\nThe food itself?

A terrible dining experience that you just need to share, so you join yelp, like you've been saying you would do for months.\n\nAnyway - on to the story. A friend and I picked Mona Lisa somewhat randomly as we strolled through North Beach. The manager at the door was friendly and sat us at an outside table, under a heat lamp. So far so good. After about 5 minutes, bread was brought over - without butter or oil or anything. I tasted it. It was incredibly stale. Another 5 minutes, and we were able to flag someone down to get some butter and oil... at least that covered up the stale taste.\n\nFinally, after another 10 minutes, we ordered. In retrospect, it took forever to even order, but at the time my friend and I were chatting, so it wasn't a big deal. I ordered veal parmigiana and she ordered pasta with salmon. We ordered a ceasar salad to split. Two pretty easy dishes. Around this time, two women sat next to us and, about 10 minutes later, they ordered too. (One of them also ordered the veal parm).\n\n10 minutes or so go by and our salad comes - we split it, it's fine. Nothing to write home about. Way too much dressing. Another 20 minutes go by. Nothing. Finally, we see our waiter coming outside with two plates.... which he puts down on the table next to ours, where the women sat over 20 minutes after us, and were still eating the salad they were splitting.\n\nAt this point, I was getting upset. I tried to get the manager's attention, but he was busy taking pictures with tourists. Finally, our waiter came back out to give parmesan cheese to the table next to us, and when I told him it had been ridiculously long since we ordered, he said \"it's coming!\" and stormed off. Another 8 minutes went by, and still nothing (and no waiter with an update), so I went to the manager. He was flustered, pointed to the waiter, and finally got the waiter's attention. The waiter was downright rude. RUDE! He was visibly upset that I'd gone to his manager over him.\n\nI went back outside and like magic, our food came out within moments. Something makes me think it was sitting out for quite some time. The waiter started yelling at me for going to the manager and that \"the rest of the restaurant needs their meals too, so be patient.\" I was appalled and just said that we waited over 45 minutes for our food, and that's absurd in a restaurant like theirs.\n\nThe manager came over a minute later and apologized, saying the waiter had \"too much stress.\" Quite frankly, I don't care how stressed he is. His job is to make my meal nice and uneventful. I was pissed. The manager apologized profusely, as did a female waitress who came out a minute later to check on us - it seemed she was the only sensible one in the place.\n\nThe food itself was blah. The veal may or may not have been very thinly pounded chicken - it had that consistency. It was hard to tell for sure because it was smothered in tasteless sauce and parmesan cheese. I wasn't a fan. Friend liked her salmon pasta, but was also pissed at the service.\n\nThe manager tried to right the wrong by giving us a free tiramisu. It was pretty tasty, and showed he cared about his customers, at least. That jerk of a waiter, on the other hand...\n\nI won't return. Ever.", "author": "Dan L."}

I went for a birthday dinner last weekend and had to wait an hour for a table even though we had a reservation. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, I sat down on a broken water glass on my chair! I actually had to pull a huge shard of glass out of my ass, leaving a nice bloody puncture wound! It wasn't very big, but it was deep and was still bleeding that night when I went to bed. Our waiter was really apologetic and gave us extra appetizers that we didn't order, but it would have been much nicer to have the meal comp'd, especially since the food was pretty bad. I really could have done without the free out of season melon and prosciutto and the soggy bruschetta. \n\nI ordered the eggplant parmesan because I figured anything with cheese is usually pretty good, but this wasn't even very good in a white trash kind of way. The sauce was okay, but there was really more breading than anything else. I really had to take a leap of faith to believe that there was any eggplant buried in the sticky floury muck that was surrounding it. The \"eggplant\" came with a side of penne with marinara that was actually inedible (how hard it is to do a decent red sauce?!) and sauteed spinach that was nearly inedible (again - really hard to get wrong). \n\nAs far as I could tell, the only thing this restaurant has going for it is a polite, attentive waitstaff, but it's hard to know if they would have been as polite and attentive if I hadn't been speared in the ass with a large shard of glass.", "author": "Caitlin L."}

Antipasto, Calamari fritti, Shrimp, fresh bread with olive oil.  Then we ordered our entrees and it was also great.

I have tried nearly every other Italian joint on the block, and still Mona draws me back every time with her charm and authentic Italian feel.\n\nWhy I love Mona Lisa:\n\nThe interior is CHARMING! Fresco's and statues everywhere - even \"Creation\" from the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling! You could easily sit in Mona Lisa for hours and still have new art or fun add-ons to examine. Plus the staff has some great stories of pictures of the boss and famous Italian athletes hanging by the front door. \n\nThe menu is HUGE! Plan on spending at least 10 whole minutes just reading through the whole thing! You name the kind of pasta and sauce - they've got it!\n\nThe food is DELICIOUS! I have eaten here at least a dozen times and have always walked away full and satisfied! Everything from the fish dishes (husband's favorite) to the squash ravioli to the pesto fettuccini - delicious! Plus there is always the Italian bread and cold butter to hold you over while you wait!\n\nThe wine menu is VAST and full of great, authentic Italian wines. Try the house Pino. They even have have Italian beers!\n\nBest of all, the staff and waiters are - overall - Italian, and even wear Mona Lisa ties. They love chatting with you about all that is Italy (maybe their chats are flirts, maybe I am overly friendly, too - who knows!). \n\nSeriously, maybe they should hire me to promote the place. \n\nEveryone's experience at any restaurant will yield different opinions and persuasions. I know some people don't favor Mona because of a long wait in line or at their table. In all my experiences, I have also had to wait anywhere from 0-5 minutes for a table, and 20-45 minutes for food. BUT that's the type of restaurant ML is - a sit-down-and-relax-for-awhile kind of place!\n\nSo... go to Mona Lisa if you enjoy authentic-ish Italian food; you have guests in town and want to show them a good time; you are on Columbus Street/Little Italy and want a drink or dessert; you have a few dollars to spare for quantity and quality; you love fresco's and catchy Italian art/statues; you enjoy watching Italian men (young and old) prepare and serve food.\n\nDon't go to Mona Lisa if: you are in a hurry; you are on a tight budget; you are indecisive (the menu will scare you!).", "author": "Christyn K."}

I used to live in North Beach, and I'd always wanted to try the joint out, but I didn't really have anyone willing to splurge on Italian (something about it being easy to make...) and it can be a bit pricey to dine here. \n\nThe only problem I had was choosing what to eat! The menu is HUUUUUUGE, so MUCH to choose from! We stared at the menu for half an hour before we could just pick something from the five that we had whittled it down to! We got bruchetta for an appetizer (less crunchy, more-chewy, sorta sweet...I enjoyed a great deal, very basil-y, very tasty) and we each got a glass of white wine. The Pinot Grigio was great (sweet, but not too sweet) and the server had several recommendations on what we should try. He got the Chardonnay, which I felt was very strong, super-dry....but he enjoyed.\n\nFor entree, I got the Rissotto el Salmone. (Salmon Rissoto...am I butchering these spellings or what!?! haha) It was EXACTLY what I wanted. The salmon was PERFECT and the portion was MASSIVE. I took home half of my food, and I don't typically do that. He got the Scampi del Golfo (Prawns in marsala sauce with mushrooms). His was much-stronger with the herbs; both plates were AMAZING! Our compliments to the chef!\n\nOur server was amazing. He was a doll, keeping up filled on water and checking on us when necessary. The boy had to use the restroom and when he asked about it, our server informed him there was an issue with the restroom, but then proceeded to take him outside, next door, then WAIT for my boyfriend to finish in the bathroom (server waited outside) then escorted him BACK to the restaurant. Above-and-beyond, for sure.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but I'm sure it's excellent. \n\nThe interior of this place is super-cute.

You sort of got the feeling people weren't too happy to be working, but were treating you well regardless if that makes sense. I'll emphasize though we had no trouble with the service and it does not impact my rating here.\n\nThe food itself was a bit of a disappointment. I suppose I should have been suspect given the menu is absolutely enormous, which is always a warning that quality is going to suffer (Haven't restaurants figured out giant menus are a mistake yet? It's 2009)\n\nWe opted for Fried Calamari to start off with. While the portions were excellent the friend coating was so thick it was like something from a carnival. They were tasteless as well and needed the dipping sauce to cover it up. Someone on staff needs to learn how to make proper fried calamari-it's not hard. Lightly coated-lightly fried.\n\nThe Chicken Saltimbocca I ordered was delivered lukewarm and was not very good. I don't think the chefs are tasting anything they are making. The pasta was incredibly overcooked! You'd have to leave it in 30 minutes to accomplish what I got. The food (if delivered hot) is what I would expect from an Italian take-out place that charges $10. Not bad-just not worthy of a quality restaurant.\n\nPerhaps I got them on a bad night, so I'm still going to award them 3 stars for a fun atmosphere and solid service.

Every time I look at photos of those pizzas, I crave them, so I just HAD to find something comparable here in SF.\n\nWHY WE DECIDED TO TRY IT...\n\nMy husband and I picked Mona Lisa because after walking all over North Beach and looking at menus, we saw the menu at Mona Lisa and were like, \"That's it!\" -- the menu was exactly the same style that every place we ate in Italy used: A book-style tome with pages and pages of pastas and pizzas. Ok it wasn't QUITE as long as the Italian menus, but there were the characteristic, 10 varieties of every pasta listed one after the other.\n\nHOW IT COMPARED...\n\nWhen we got the pizza, it was right on (except for the fact that they sliced it, which no Italian restaurant did).\n\nThe crust on these pizzas was thin but not like Amicis or California Pizza Kitchen stone-fired thin/crispy crusts are. It was thin and chewy. It was almost like a really fat tortilla only softer if that makes sense.\n\nThey didn't have half as many topping options as Italian places did (no horse meat or french fries), although they had more choices than a lot of North Beach places do, but the pizza we got -- La Capital, with pancetta, fresh tomatoes, and added mushrooms -- was quite savory. And it had that juicy, almost soggy feel that I crave when I look at those Italian pizzas -- I love the way the slices melt in your hand.\n\nCONCLUSION...\n\nIf you like thin, chewy, almost soggy (in a good way) pizzas, definitely try Mona Lisa. It was a little pricey though, and the pizzas aren't huge compared to some places' (though my husband and I split one and were totally happy with some to spare... but we're light eaters).\n\nFor me, this was the place that satisfied my craving, so I'm quite pleased.", "author": "Alexa A."}

The waiter never once came to our table to find out if we liked it or if we needed anything else. We split a ceasar salad. $9.00 and there were like 10 lettuce leaves on the plate with four large croutons. What a joke. The economy has hit this place hard...and the customers paying for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-20", "description": "Yesterday was my first time eating at the Mona Lisa. Our intended destination was this restaurant called the Pinocchio. However as we were walking with our group of about 10 people, there were some Italian people out front of Mona Lisa (quite possibly co-owners) that baited us in with free wine. We were like sure, why not give this place a try. \n\nThe decor is inspired by Renaissance Art. The lighting is not too bright, just kind of right. The interior of the restaurant is shaped like an elongated rectangle. There are various portraits of the Mona Lisa set up throughout the restaurant---surprisingly, even a topless one.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers, Calamari and steamed mussel/clams. The Calamari was not bad---fairly tender. The Calms...it was my first time ever eating steamed clams/mussels...they were a somewhat salty, and not bad. Just a different experience. I preferred the calamari instead.\n\nTheir complimentary appetizers are slices of (i assume fresh) bread dipped on your plate of your choice of olive oil and red vinaigrette. Sadly i indulged too much on these. Even before my food came, i had realized that----Hey! I'm already kinda getting full---this is not a good sign.\n\nI think i stopped after my 4th piece of bread. I was pretty hungry.\n\nThen the Chicken Parmigiana came. In my honest opinion, their pasta on the side sucks balls. It's pretty bland, flavorless..with a very thin tomato sauce. There also was side of steamed spinach which was not bad, it offset the flavors from the chicken---allowing one to cleanse their pallet before the next bite.\n\nThe Chicken on the other hand was exceptionally tender, and the melted cheese on top.....MmMmM delicious! If the meal was maybe $2-$3 cheaper, it would be a bargain....not that ~$15ish a plate is overpriced.\n\nAs for the free wine, yes they gave it to us as soon as we were seated. However they carded everyone and the people under 21 didn't get no free wine. Meh, the wine was a bit overrated...again it is just a hook...but hey free is free right? The owners promised two bottles, but no one in our party was really drinking. I myself didn't drink. So we only got one free bottle.\n\nAll in all, i give this place a 3.5. Almost a 4 if their pasta was a bit better. \n\nAlso one key observation, there were no female waitresses working their on a Friday night....A bit surprising if you ask me...not that it bothers me a lot.", "author": "Ahmad s."}

He spoke to my Aunt on the phone and they had a very nice conversation in Italian, after which we were served a wonderful 3 tiered tray of antipasto, complete with calamari, brochetta, prosciutto with melon, fresh wonderful parmigiano regiano, fresh basil and arugula, and a marvelous dipping sauce for the calamari....and that was just for starters. The owner brought us a wonderful bottle of Chianti Classico,which was delicious, and then the main courses.  My Cousin had the Bistecca with fresh porcini mushrooms cooked medium rare, and I had the Vitello Mona Lisa (Veal Mona Lisa), and they were both absolutely wonderful. We finished off the meal with wonderful Lemonciello for desert.  We had to get home unfortunately, but had we not, we would have been happy to stay there and close it down:)  The owner Maurizio took several photographs with us in front of his beautiful Fiat that sits in front of his restaurant that has a picture of the Mona Lisa air-brushed on the hood of his car.

This restaurant was chosen for me by a friend and she had decided on this restaurant for it's (1) vicinity to bubble lounge, dragon bar and steps of rome without having to get a cab (2) ability to accommodate a party of 14 people for dinner.\n\nSo I noticed that the reviews for this place are pretty hit or miss. Some received exceptional service but mediocre food, bad service with mediocre food, some people love the food etc...\n\nDcor: The descriptions from the yelpers are pretty accurate, there's murals on the ceiling, international flags on the wall, open kitchen area, all the servers wearing mona lisa ties, naked statues, pictures of celebrities that have been to mona lisa... it keeps the eye busy. All the tables are lit by oil lamps, table cloths, cloth napkins, dark furniture, pretty kitschy, pretty typical, you get the point. \n\nService: they broke us up into groups of 6, 4 and 4 to make it more manageable.  they seated us immediately (thumbs up!). Service was pretty efficient for a busy restaurant. It got so busy that another server took one of our dishes to his customers who ordered the same thing. we had to call him down to get the dish back. They obviously need to be more organized. Down side was that our long table was sitting parallel to the kitchen which is cool b/c you get the watch the cooks, but it was a high traffic area to be sitting, servers walking by, customers walking by and the occasional gust of cold air when the door opens.\n\nThe bathroom had a puddle of water and was super slippery, someone had slipped and fell. She told the server, she acknowledged, but I don't know if they did anything about it.... \n\nFood: the menu is freaking HUGE. The reason for that is they have EVERY variation of EVERY kind of pasta that you can think of. I would prefer a smaller menu with better food to focus on rather than a wide variety menu, with no focus. i wanted a margarita pizza, but theirs was basically just a cheese pizza. No tomato and basil. Whats up with that??? So I ended up getting the fettuccini primavera. The noodles were a teeeeeny al dente, which is fine with me, the sauce was kind of too creamy for my liking though. I think everyone's general food experience was neither here nor there. it was just Italian food that was not that memorable but still pretty edible. I think the most memorable dish was the Sicilian candy, which is roasted garlic, A LOT of roasted garlic.... \n\nBut I do like how they have the balsamic vinegar and EVOO at the table, and right when your dish comes out, they follow with cheese ASAP. \n\nI probably wouldn't eat here again, not because it was horribly bad, it was just typical, not special, just very average. if I made the trek all the way out to north beach and bothered to look for parking, I would like something a little more worth my while.

As perverse as incest is, the debate over Mona Lisa's smile is the only good thing to come out of Mona Lisa Restaurant.  I am absolutely shocked at the great reviews for this place.\n\nMy wife and were seated in the back of the restaurant and admired the very busy decor of the place.  The carpet looked like a casino floor without the smell of cigarettes surrounded by unique wall paintings.  We both ordered glasses of wine and came back with a very generous pour.  \n\nI ordered Chicken Saltimbocca and my wife had the Tortellini alla Bollognese.  The Chicken Saltimbocca comes with a small serving of marinara pasta and spinach.  Now I'm a fan of olive oil but when I received my entree, the spinach, the pasta, and the chicken were bathing in a nice pool of olive oil laying at the bottom of the plate.  I can understand a little oil, yes it is perhaps an Italian restaurant.  But to take a bath and have the chicken nearly submerged made me believe either the chef was drunk or we had Exxon Valdez part 2 happen in the back of the kitchen.\n\nThe chicken itself was only moist because of the oil.  The spinach was drenched in oil.  You get the picture.  I can't make an accurate assessment on the food because I think I ordered chicken with my oil based upon what was served.  The chicken was indeed tasty, but considering it was topped with prosciutto, a layer of cheese and a load of oil, any misgivings about the flavor of the chicken went out the door.  \n\nThe wife's tortellini was average.  I think they used Prego sauce.  Even I could've done a better job.  Needless to say she did not finish her entree.\n\nThe worst part of the whole experience was the service.  These guys were running around the entire restaurant like chickens with their heads cut off.  They clearly did not have  a handle on nearly anything going on; barking orders at the busboy, water boy, all the while not keeping tabs on their tables.  After we finished the entree the waiter did come by to pick up our plates.  Then for 20 minutes he disappears and is running around taking care of something else.  \n\n\"Check please!!\"  Been waiting here long enough to have that olive oil grease my colon for Christ's sake!  \n\nBad food, terrible service.

I was going to take her to another restaurant in the area that I frequent more often, but I decided to try something different. We were seated immediately and they let us pick our table. Yay!\n\nI was a bit overwhelmed when we walked in though. There is so much going on inside the restaurant and it looks like it has seen some better days, but after my eyes adjusted, I enjoyed it more. It looks kind of small from the outside, but when you walk in it's huge. It's kind of like you walk into a cave filled with clutter, Italian food and wine. That sounds weird, but it was my first impression.\n\nNow onto the menu and service... The menu was also overwhelming! I was so excited to see the different kinds of gnocchi because I'm a big fan. Although, I was a little leery because I'm picky when it comes to good gnocchi, I ended up getting the four cheese gnocchi and my friend got the pesto gnocchi. \n\nAfter our server brought us bread. It was okay, but I've definitely had better at some of the other restaurants in the area. Then they brought our food out and as soon as I dug in to my gnocchi I hated it! I tried my friend's pesto gnocchi and it was delicious. The gnocchi itself was made well, but the sauce was just too much for me sadly. I recommend the dish to people who really *love* cheese. I like cheese, but apparently not that much! \n\nI felt horrible and contemplated on what to do because I really hate complaining about food. I think our server noticed and he came over right away. He asked me if I'd like to order something else before I couldn't even fumble out words. I nodded apologetically and changed my order to the crab ravioli that comes with a creamy tomato sauce. \n\nMy food was brought out in a good amount of time and I thanked our server profusely because I felt so bad. He was completely cool about it and shrugged it off making the whole meal much more enjoyable.\n\nI will probably come here again because there are so many options and different plates to try, but I will definitely stay away from four cheese anything on the menu.

The wine list was crappy, but priced as if you might actually get a decent glass (out of a box that they must keep under the bar).\n\nI started with the steamed mussels and clams appetizer which was all right, but nothing special at all and I was a more than a little disappointed by the very tomato saucy sauce they came in. It was nothing like I had ever seen before and expected it to be more wine and broth than what seemed like canned tomato puree. My friend had a Caesar with grilled shrimp that she enjoyed, though she dislikes dressing, so I wasn't able to taste it... I often judge places by their caesar dressing. As an entree, I had the veal picatta. While the sauce was lovely and the side dishes were great, the veal itself was overcooked and very tough. My friend had the chicken parmesan and she said that it was \"just fine\". I ate her spinach.\n\nMy biggest problem with the place is that the service was so so sooooo slow.

Once you get inside look up and if your lucky enough to have visited Rome in your time then you will notice that is is a very familiar site.  They have painted a replica of the Celestine Chapel on the restaurant ceiling!  Complete with the hand of God and Adam reaching for each other.  When you sit down you are presented with a complimentary plate of bruschetta.  Putting food in front of you without even asking if you want it as an Italian I can tell you that's a sign of a true Italian!  Loving this place before I even look at the menu.  \n\nThe menu, it gets even better here.  It's like book!! Pages and pages of every imaginable pasta option out there and all of the glorious entree options you would expect and love.  I can never make up my mind that's another reason to come to this place time after time.  Now you would think they could run the risk of offering too much and not getting every dish right, but so not true.  Every plate that I have had at Mona Lisa has been delicious.  One of my more memorable experiences was with the Gorgonzola Walnut Ravioli- To-die-for!  I even came here when I was on a Vegan fast and could not eat ANY animal products.  The accomidating server came up with with meat-free, cream-free, cheese-free risotto that was simply out of this world!  I have never had dessert here because the people I'm with are alway too full by that point in the meal.  But not be I'm never too full, there is always that special spot left in the stomach that doesn't get full because it's meant for sweets.  \n\nWhen you come here come hungry and get ready to mangi mangi!", "author": "Marlene S."}

I'm a native Italian and tend to have high standards when I visit Italian restaurants. Everything from the ambiance to the food and wait staff reminds me of home. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable of their wine list and food menu. The owner is a genuinely kind man, passionate about his food and willing to take the time to meet his patrons. The food is truly exquisite and simply fresh. You cannot go wrong with any fish item as they prepare to perfection. The same goes for the pasta as it is always al dente, topped with the most delicious sauces and freshest ingredients. Mona Lisa does not disappoint.

But then again, I don't put a lot of hang time down in North Beach, so I guess that's my excuse.\n\n  Five of us went on a Friday night of a 95-degree day, hoping for an outside table somewhere in the 'hood.  Of course, every place was like a can of hot, stanky sardines, with people spilling out onto the thoroughfare.  (It seems though the HVAC as well as the armpits of San Francisco are not prepared for hot days.)\n\n  We spied some peeps finishing their salads at Mona Lisa and got on the wait for their table.  Twenty minutes later, we were sitting outside with menus, but it was a long time before our very flustered server arrived.  We ate lots of bread, which was a tad Safeway-esque.\n\n  We ended up with two bottles of the $27.00 Sauvignon Blanc, which was tasty for the price.  (We should not have had 2 bottles, but that was something I would discover much, much later in the evening.) \n\n  The Fritto Misto was a good choice of appetizer, along with the sampler that included bruschetta.  Salads were not spectacular, but made me feel healthier about what I was going to eat next.\n\n  My pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sauce was super Bret Michaels- dangerously rich with nothing on the top.   Other attendees thought their dishes- the gnocchi in particular- were of BM status too and none of us could finish.\n\n  We were seated right next to a speaker that was WAY too loud, and when you threw in the warbly, intermittent Italian solos coming from the front door man, it was like a bad theater experience.  \n\n  With the tinny tunes and being too full for dessert, we paid our 184.00 and bid au revoir to Mona Lisa.  I spent the evening with a roiling tummy who was clearly unhappy with its' current contents.\n\nDamn you, Bret Michaels.", "author": "Lea N."}

My friend knows one of the waiters there and recommended it as our dinner spot.\n\nProduct: The antipasti was tasty, the wine quite delicious, the entrees to die for, and the dessert delectable.  We started getting full so everyone passed around their entrees to sample.  The pesto was pretty good but I would have to say the lasagna (meaty, rich, dense, rich & meaty) and the lobster ravioli (just a hint of lobster and wonderful cream sauce) were my favorites.  The baked ravioli and the pumpkin and spice ravioli were close behind.  The gnocchi was good in the sense that they were warm and chewy and gooey, a very exciting texture.  The price range for appetizer, entree, wine, and dessert was about $30 per person.  Well worth it!\n\nService: Very good service.  Our waiter was friendly, talkative, made good recommendations as to entree/wine/dessert choices, served our food moments after it was cooked (we were sitting right next to the service bar so I could see it being cooked just moments before the heavenly lobster ravioli met my taste buds), and generally was very attentive.\n\nAtmosphere: This place is very cozy.  The neighborhood is Italian (duh!) through and through.  Inside there are murals on the ceiling, soft lighting, and nice chandeliers.  My only complaint is that the seating felt a little cramped, though there were 9 of us.

As a native new yorker I know better than to rely on a Little Italy or in this case North Beach  tourist trap restaurant. But we were hungry and had a killer walk in experience at another place so we headed here. It was horrible! They tried to seat us at a 2 person mini table. I asked for a 4 top so we could sit side by side and they accommodated us. Two minutes later the server asked us to move. We didn't and that set the tone for the rest of the meal. I ordered beef carpaccio which was not on the menu. I thought that would get the waiter's attention but I still had to flag him down for black pepper. Then we dove in to the \"carpaccio\" which was none other than roast beef. At that point we decided to pay for what we ate and leave before getting worse into a bad meal.

For one night the owner great host very good hearted  The service is great and the food is excellent  Was there on a week day and we had a great time waiting in line the place was completely full and the owner was able to please every one ether with wine or an antipasto on the house \n\nI recommend this place if you want to have a good Italian meal for a good value ! This restaurant is PERFECT for italian food lovers and or pasta seafood lovers! We had a group of 10 people that just loved the steak, veal, chicken,pasta, seafood and original specials. Affordable and fun dinning. My overall experience was great and fun, not to mention that they serve you big portions so expect to take home leftovers or share family style so you can try everything. It gets really packed but trust me it is definitely worth the wait =)  \n\n(my girl friend thought the waiters were super hot and model like..so if you are in to italian men and great italian cuisine; MONA LISA is where they are at)\n\nIt's not easy to find an authentic italian restaurant in this country.  I know of one i would recommend: Mona Lisa !!  \n\nI go to  Mona Lisa every time I'm in San Fran because it's really GOOD.  They have fantastic pizza and pasta not to mention some great veal, seafood and steak dishes (though, disappointingly, not all specials are always available the fresh specials are limited on a first come first serve basis and not always on the menu).\n\nMy girl friend and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and the staff went out of their way to make our evening pleasant.  The maitre'd helped me coordinate, via email, the exact table I wanted and delivery of flowers to be set up and waiting for us on arrival.  Our server was knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive without being intrusive.\n \nDessert was a revelation:  Layered sponge cake and whipped cream with a chocolate bamba and espresso!  \n\nWhat could be better?\n\nMy girlfriend commented at one point during the meal, that it didn't seem very Italian to her - which I found to be complimentary since most Americans think of Italian food as loaded w/ garlic and heavy on tomato sauce and oil ... a distinctly Italian influence on American Italian cuisine and so much less than what the nuances of Italian cooking have to offer.\n\nSome of the reviews herein say that mona lisa is average but they must work for the competition, I don't know - but my first time was in 2006 and i keep coming back ! MONA LISA IS MY FAVORITE NORTH BEACH EXPERIENCE.  Maybe I just know what to order by sticking to the authentic menu ... but also note that, per Michael Bauer's recent, glowing review in the SF Chronicle, and several professional athlete and celebrity reviews its a WINNER IN MY BOOK !\n\nNo better Italian cooking than the food of NORTH BEACH ... thank you MONA LISA!\n\nCIAO!", "author": "carl h."}

The Yelp reviews were kind of mixed, but we figured we'd give it a shot anyway.  I'm so glad that we did.  The food was really good.  I live in LA where good Italian food is nearly impossible to find.  So I was so happy once we received our fried calamari appetizer.  It's a really big portion, and the breading and seasoning complement it very nicely.  Our entrees were very tasty as well.\n\nSo this weekend when I was back in SF visiting my friend, we decided to try Mona Lisa again, hoping it would be as good as last time - and it sure was.  We again started with the fried calamari (delicious), and I had a simple penne with chicken in a tomato cream sauce.  It was a nice portion (not too big, not too small), and very flavorful.  \n\nI will say, though, that the menu needs some help.  It is humongous and needs a little organization.  On the plus side, you can get pretty much anything you want.  You just have to do a lot of reading first.  Unlike other reviews, I didn't feel that the service was bad on either visit.  The waiters were attentive as needed.  \n\nI will definitely go back to Mona Lisa next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Ryan B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-08", "description": "My boyfriend and I wanted to go someplace special for my birthday so we picked this cozy little Italian restaurant and I must say that we left very happy.  Yes, the place is small, but the romantic candle light and decorations overpowered the feeling of being cramped.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  I also love it when you can see the chefs working on your food.  Their open kitchen brings about a pleasant feeling as it almost seems more personal.  The service was excellent as well.  The waiters were friendly though albeit, a little too busy to check up on you often, but they get the job done.\nThe highlight of the night was definitely the food.  For me, the salmon pasta that we ordered was unforgettable.  Tasting the sauce reminded me of what a cream sauce was supposed to be like...it's supposed to be creamy!  Their sauce wasn't overly thick and injected with butter like many so called 'Italian' places out there, but it actually tasted like rich milk that complimented the pasta instead of drowning it.  The salmon was perfectly cooked so that the flavor of the fish was still there, but was still tender and moist.  The salmon comes in small chunks, but for 1 of the cheapest items on the pasta menu, I thought it was totally worth it.\nThe next most memorable items were the appetizers.  There calamari was absolutely delicious.  The batter was not too heavy and allowed you to enjoy the delightful texture of fresh squid.  If the flavor's not bold enough for you, the marinara sauce will definitely make up for that.  They have the best marinara sauce that I've ever tasted hands down.  It's not too tangy or dominated by tomatoes by is a fine blend of tomato sauce and herbs.   The other appetizer plate that we got was a nice starter as well, containing various cold meats and cheeses to get you ready for the main course.  All of the ingredients were fresh and delectable.\nThe pizza that we ordered was also delicious with a harmonious combination of artichokes, olives and ham.  The crust was of a thin style.  It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It wasn't too hollow, nor too heavy.  My favorite part of the pizza was the generous chunks of artichoke baked into the flavorful cheese.\nSo all in all, it was a great place for a nice, authentic Italian dinner.  We definitely recommend it.", "author": "J K."}

Bill was around $160 for all this for 4 people so...less than 200 for 4 people having a quality meal. Nice.\n\nUpdate: Went back a second time and two of three dishes were craaaaazy salty.

My husband tried to talk to the manager about it and warned them that this incident will ruin their reputation, so they should make sure cleanliness is their priority above all. As a compliment, they gave us one tiramisu cake for dessert. I took a bite and there was a curly hair in our tiramisu. OMG. What a nightmare. \n\nWe thought that they will take care of everything, because of these terrible incidents. Guess what??? We had to pay for all those craps, and we were surprised to pay such an expensive amount for a pasta, risotto, and one appetizer.\n\nBathroom was clean, but when my mom tried to get a glimpse of their kitchen, she thought it was pretty dirty for a restaurant.\n\nComment on food: \nTheir spaghetti was bland, but their risotto is pretty good.\n\nPositive:\nThis restaurant looks so classic and elegant with its gorgeous interior design.

We had a 5th person in our group but he was running late.  When we got to the restaurant the 4 of us put our name on the waitlist and were told it would be approx. 40 mins.  We asked the host if there was a bar we could wait at.  He said no.  We then asked if we could leave our number so we could wait in a nearby coffee shop and return when a table was ready.  He shrugged, which we took as another no.  He wasn't the most welcoming and friendly person we encountered, but we heard the food was fantastic so we decided to stick around.  Well just minutes later, my cousin, who's from England and is the cutest person I know, said god knows what to this guy and before we knew it, we had a table instantly!  Even though our 5th person wasn't with us, they still seated us and politely accepted our request to order without him and have him order separately when he arrived.\n\nOur waiter, Lucciano, who I believe is from Italy (I mean grew up there, not Italian American), was AWESOME!  He recommended an Italian Champagne called Prosecco, and it was perfect.  Sweet, light and ideal for the summer.  \n\nI ordered a Vegetable Lasagne for my entree.  Turned out they were out of it so I asked Lucciano if he could suggest a good alternative.  He told me the Manicotti was the closest to what I was looking for.  I went with that and was very, very pleased.  The spinach and ricotta cheese were perfectly blended together and the creamy marinara sauce melted in my mouth.  My cousin ordered the Four Cheese Gnochi and shared some with me, which was also lip smacking.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a Tiramisu, which two of us were going to share.  Well, turned out they were out of that too.  As a 2nd choice, I asked for one Chocolate Truffle.  At this point, our 5th person finally showed up & ordered a dessert to catch up with us.  He chose the Profiteroll.  When Lucciano came back, he brought the Profiteroll, the Chocolate Truffle and a Chocolate Ganache Cheesecake for free since everything I ordered wasn't in.  It was really nice of him, especially since we didn't complain or even request a freebee, he brought it on his own accord.   This showed the care of the restaurant in providing excellent service and made our experience that much better.  We ate our dishes family style and everything was fantastic.  I especially loved the hard shell around the truffle and the soft icecream dissolving after a bite.

I am a local to the city and have eaten at every restaurant in North Beach. The menu is HUGE, tough to choose, but my favs are: the spagetti polpette (and it is theonly spagetti and meatballs worth eating in the area); chicken piccata - out of this world; the ravioli are all made each day - cannot be beat; the risotta is creamy and delicious. \n\nThe wine list is great and as a tradional 'mom&pop' restaurant, it doesn't serve liqour which to some is a downside, but then, wine is traditional for Italy! \n\nMauricio, the owner, makes sure you are happy. As a frequent guest to his restaurant, I get a compliementary appetizer or glass of wine each time I eat there or bring a guest with me. I have only had one bad meal in the seven years I have been going to this restaurant and the waiter warned me it wasn't that great and I ordered it anyway.

Decided to try it again with friends for dinner.  Big mistake.  Huge lines on a Saturday night -- after our experience, I'm not sure why.  Our reservations were basically ignored.  The decor is rather cheesy (topless Mona Lisa, anyone?), the service was so-so, and the food was poor.  The bread that arrived before the meal actually had dried, stale ends.  The appetizer of bruschetta and capresi salad was uninspired.  My husband ordered a risotto he had had here before and loved -- this time, it was dry and the shrimp was over-cooked.  My  porcinni mushroom risotto, which I ordered on the server's recommendation, was nothing but salt and garlic -- I only ate about half of it, and that was because I had skipped lunch.  One friend ordered a dish with salmon, which he doesn't like, because the server was rushing us through the ordering process.

Then go here or live vicariously through this review.\n\nQuickly seated on a busy night, but I think that was a sign of what was to come.  The ridiculous 800 item menu without some simple Italian dishes (no grilled calamari, no cavatelli pasta, etc) was an initial tipoff that this place has no idea what Italian is beyond saying \"Graaatzieeee\".\n\nObviously cheap frozen squid from a box in my dish.  A side of olive (maybe) oil with a bit of mushy tasteless spinach.  She had the gnocchi which wasn't very good and was covered in the same tasteless, except for some sourness/acidity from the tomatoes, red sauce.  I don't even know where they buy (they don't make anything) sauce this bad since it makes Prego/Ragu seem like something Charlie Trotter must have slaved for hours on.   And Prego/Ragu are CRAP.  \n\nAll this for $14-20 PASTA dish prices! In this alternate universe Olive Garden is a good deal at $200 a person.\n\nSo you would think all that was bad enough.  But no, read on to see the positive for this place and how that went bad.....\n\nThe server was nice (if a bit corny) and attentive.  He kept our wine glasses full, etc....

Four of us were able to share two different kinds - one caesar (never fails when my husband orders) and one special.  Again, the caesar was not too garlicky and the special had yummy spinach and feta and plump cherry tomatoes.  \n\nBetween the four of us, someone had a fish dish, two had pasta dishes, and the fourth had veal parm.  We all tasted each others because there was definitely more than enough to go around and since each of us had a difficult time deciding what we wanted because of the array of options from not only the traditional menu but also the specials menu, we figured we would taste test.\n\nThe salmon was thoroughly cooked without being dry.  This was from the specials menu and the person who ordered it even had it more customized making sure it was not cooked with butter and substituted one of the sides for rice.  Even without the sauces, the dish was not plain because the fish was well seasoned and grilled.  The colorful veggies also helped please the eye.\n\n***The server had kindly explained with a smile that anything can be done for the customer.\n\nI ordered the clams and olive oil but I opted for linguini instead of spaghetti. It is really difficult to mess up this kind of order and of course, ML shined through.\n\nThe other pasta dish had sausage and peppers, but mild.  This was good because the person who ordered it does not do well with spicy dishes.  I am not sure if the sausage was homemade or not, but it tasted homemade.  It was not overpowered with fennel, which tends to happen often.  This is just a personal preference, so do not make a conclusion based on my personal taste over yours.  If you like fennel, then there might be too little in there for you.\n\nThe veal parm was juicy, tender, and included two slices of veal.  Typically you only see one slice.

My wife and her family are ALL from Italy...and they think it's incredibly authentic. Their Fettuccini Pescadore Is my wife's fave and swears its very close to the one her uncle makes...in Italy...and he's a chef. Be patient with the service, because they get busy, but the atmosphere is great, the servers are friendly and the owner(if you know the language is right off-the-plane Italian, and will speak it. They have this amazing sampler tower appetizer...this...could alone, be a meal. If people are used to Olive Garden or some other \"supposed\" Italian place...do not go here. This place is VERY authentic, which might explain some of the complaints about how the food is tasting. I have taken many people here...and they now eat there every time they come to town. the prices are reasonable and it's just a great, fun place to go to...especially in these chilly fall evenings. Just for added fun, they have this little Italian convertible car outside, almost entirely made of wood parked in front of the restaurant...and you can eat in it...right on the street! Very cool.

I went here last night with my girlfriend wanting to take advantage of our entertainment book coupon. I am always suspect of eating at Italian restaurants since I'm lactose intolerant; it's a veritable recipe for disaster. But, we had a buy one, get one, so why not?\n\nThe bread was tough and kind of stale tasting, and there wasn't a proper oil dish for dipping, just these strange kidney shaped bowls. The server took his time getting to us, but I was in a mood to take my time anyway. We got a bottle of Sangiovese, which was pretty reasonably priced and quite tasty. The house salad was pretty weak; just some mixed greens with one pathetic slice of tomato. I got the veal osso bucco over polenta and my girlfriend got some kind of combo with manicottii, canneloni, and raviolis. The food was definitely tasty enough to meet my standards. The portions were more than adequate as well. I must complain that the server never came by to check on us, but the wine had done the trick to help me relax and keep my standards low. \n\nOverall, this place is alright. It was my first foray into the Italian restaurant scene in North Beach. Perhaps I would go back, but more than likely, I will just listen to some fellow yelpers recommendations and experiment with some other establishments.", "author": "Saikat P."}

We (boyfriend and I) decided to go here based off of yelp reviews to see why some people rated it poorly and some outstandingly. Unfortunately, I am going to side with those who give it 1 star or 0, if possible.\n\nWe  walked in on a Wednesday night, made reservations, as very few people were there at about 6:30pm. We weren't greeted by our server and felt a bit rushed as he stood there waiting for us to order, after requesting a few minutes. The extra time was necessary, considering their menu was so long. We ordered the Calamari Fritti, to start us off, which is basically calamari with marinara. It was okay, only the top parts of the squid cut in ring-like shapes, no tentacles. From the impression of our appetizer, we thought it would've been an okay dinner.\n\nWe finally ordered and got our food with not too long of a wait. He ordered Spaghetti alle Vongole (white wine sauce, clams and garlic) as I had the  Rigatoni Osilio (chicken basil in pesto sauce). The Spaghetti alle Vongole was a bland white wine sauce, lacked garlic and any sort of flavor with clams thrown in. As my Rigatoni Osilio, was an extremely small portion, where they used large rigatoni pasta that was dry, topped with clumps of pesto. People are usually put in a situation where they want less olive oil, but in this case, I wanted more. The bread provided tasted stale and we wondered, what more could go wrong from this place. As we already started eating our dishes, the server then comes back asking if we wanted parmesan cheese. We both agreed that it would probably add a little something to our dishes. He spooned a large amount and started to put it on my dish. When I told him that, that was enough, he plopped the entire spoonful in my plate, no longer being able to see my rigatoni noodles because there was that little of it. The boyfriend's clams ate all the cheese, as the server plopped it off to the side.\n\nHe was also very rude, was never attentive of what we wanted and was into chatting it up with his fellow servers. If you're a tourist and you want a true North Beach experience, don't come here to be disappointed and be given the wrong impression. Also, if you don't like searching for parking for a good amount of time, valet your car.\n\nWill not be revisiting this place. Extremely disappointed.", "author": "Ada T."}

The selection of pasta alone is worthy of 3 stars.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Carbonara.\n\nService: 1 stars.  I have never been more rudely treated by a host, let alone an Italian host.  I frequented Mona Lisa for several months while working in SF.  I recently returned to the city for a conference and had to stop in to Mona Lisa to get my favorite Carbonara.  \n\nI waited for nearly an hour before being told that I would not be seated simply because I was alone.  Understandably, a single person will not receive priority on a Saturday night; however, it is deplorable to mistreat a patron in this way.  During that hours, I watched 3 separate parties be seated.  Coincidentally, 2 of the parties were young attractive women.  Being far from a young attractive woman and lacking my beautiful wife on my arm - that's a plug in case she reads this :) - I was continually passed over.  I watched the same thing happen to decidedly bland and older couples.  I even heard several couples complain that they had reservations that were simply not honored.  \n\nMoral of the story, unless you are a young attractive woman willing to flirt your way to a table, you may want to consider passing on this place.

I spoke to a \"customer\" (who must have been a shill working for the place) and she told me it was fantastic.  Well, the barker (the little guy outside trying to drum up business and bringing people in) offered us a free appetizer.  When I asked about the pizza, he told me it was so big that the three of us would get full from it.  Well, we were not given a choice of an appetizer (we were initially told we would) and after we ate the appetizer (which was a couple of slices of meat) and the server wanted to take our order he told us the pizza would serve only 1 person and in all of his years of working there, never would a pizza serve more than one.  We ordered two pizzas and a pasta with pesto sauce and the entire meal was HORRIBLE.  The server never even came over to see how our meal was.  I was so angry that I asked for the check, paid it and got out faster than you can say \"Rip off restaurant\".  We ended up at McDonalds on the wharf and enjoyed dinner.

However, we ordered a Bruschetta and Carpaccio for appetizer and the Bruschetta topping looked and was so unappetizing, it was clearly OLD and had been in the fridge for days! It looked mushy and was TASTELESS! As for the carpaccio it was dry, not even a little drizzle of Olive oil.

The last few times I tried to venture out to some of the other restaurants....just to see if Mona Lisa is still holding their own. One place, which used to be a very good restaurant years ago, was so bad my wife and I walked out. Food was so horrible, that the owner even offered to get us something else and we said sorry. If you can't make two common dishes, then what's the chances of getting us something that we are going to like? Went back to Mona Lisa where we were treated as friends...even though the owner wasn't there that day. This past weekend was absolutely fabulous as our dinner party of 7 all had different entrees which were wonderful. I just can't seem to get away from this place.

The atmosphere was very nice, lots of Renaissance era paintings scattered on the walls and ceiling, but it wasn't overly cliche.  The menu had more options than I had ever seen in any Italian restaurant, and when you are hungry that late at night, everything sounds great.  I had the meat lasagna, and my date had some sort of ravioli filled with feta cheese.  Both were honestly the best Italian I had ever eaten.  No complaints about the service either.  For the quality of food, the prices were more than reasonable.  The bruschette was the only thing I'd suggest staying away from.

The douchy (yes he was kind of ridiculous/rude...very \"northbeach tool\" kind of guy) waiter had been skirting around out table the entire time, which was not okay especially because the restaurant was EMPTY.  So we asked for boxes so we could get out of there.  He takes all of our plates, and returns with one plate of food bagged.  He dumped ALL of our food in the trash except for my one friend's salad.  We sat there not even wanting to tip him but because of the party size he had tacked on about 20% anyway.

First our salads came with our garlic bread (i decided to try it again) the thing is, I ordered and appetizer. When I ask where that is he says oh you wanted to order and appetizer? Like I forgot. I said \" no i ordered it\". He leaves comes back 10 minutes later and says \"were out\" !! Then our entrees come.

The service was a bit on the slow side. We had to look for our waiter a few times and I noticed he was coming back in from outside, so I guess he liked the fresh air a bit too much!!!! But overall as I said before the food was fantastic.", "author": "Sam K."}

The only reason we went there was the over zealous host standing outside trying to get folks to sit down. Once inside, however, we were sorely disappointed by everything we ordered. If you are looking for a reasonable place to eat in north beach, I'd send you to Ideale.", "author": "Avid E."}

Huge line of tourists waited outside the narrow sidewalk to get a table. Good people watch on a strangely warm night. Corkage fee is $15 dollars. Not bad these days. Very good Spaghetti Carbonara. We will come back for the Carbonara. Smoky chunky pieces of bacon ham. The prosciutto and melon dish was average. I had the Chicken Marsala and it was just average.  Service was good. Three stars for the service and the Carbonara.", "author": "Seymour S."}

Wow, my friends and I stopped in for lunch and he host was very nice, but upon sitting down and ordering in this nearly empty restaurant our server rushed us through everything. When asking if we could possibly have some vinegrette reduction for our bread he began to lecture us and told us that they only served italian food and basically ridiculed us by saying that since we're american we don't know what italian food is. Dude, all of us may be american, but then again, all of us at the table had worked in italian restaurants and know that VINEGRETTE REDUCTION IS ITALIAN. What a douche...we ordered three entrees, one of which was the gnocci ruggero, that my friend usually swears by, but we were in a meaty mood and asked him KINDLY to add a little pancetta into, his response was to argue with us and after at least a 3min conversation of him lecturing us and us trying to explain what we wanted he quickly walked away. The order of course wasn't what we asked for and in the end we just gave up, only ate half of our third entree which they ruined by bringing us the gnocci al quattro formaggi with pancetta and over doused with walnuts. Seriously disgusting. Towards the end another server had come, obviously having calmed down our first server and tried to smooth things over.\n\nIt was hands down, THE WORST SERVICE I have ever had in my whole life. I have never been lectured by my server and felt like I was a child for simply asking for one little adjustment.", "author": "Elsa H."}

After arriving it was crowded and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes but that was to be expected considering it was memorial weekend Our whole party enjoyed their meals. The homemade gnocchi was the biggest hit though. we got the one with the spinach and walnuts. The tortellini was very tasty as well. we would all definetely visit this restaurant again if ever in the san fran area again.", "author": "Susan P."}

In all, a solid place for a comforting plate of pasta.", "author": "GK S."}

Was dining alone, so was seated at a small table shoved up against the counter.  A little crowded, but no big deal.  Have dined at Mona Lisa usually once each time I'm in San Francisco (about once a year).\n\nOrdered the tortellini in 4-cheese cream sauce, which was VERY,  VERY rich and, as another reviewer put it, \"quite pungent\".  I couldn't finish it.  Luckily, I had ordered a side of meatballs, which helped cut the richness somewhat.  The \"side\" of meatballs was actually from the Spaghetti Polpette (without the spaghetti)- so I was charged for a half order of spaghetti polpette... not a huge deal.  The meatballs had good flavor, and  the marinara they came with was nondescript, but good nonetheless.   All in all, an enjoyable meal.  The bread was forgettable, but that seems to be a common theme for all places along Columbus Street.   Service was good as well.  No complaints.  Good Italian, but didn't send me over the moon.  Decently priced.  Quaint, tho slightly kitchy decor.  I decided to forgo dessert, as I've had far too much BAD tiramsu at several places along Columbus St. to go down that road again.  Good, consistant Italian food.  Will return again.", "author": "R S."}

When we got there they made us wait even though there were seats opening up for two.  They were letting people whom they seem to know just walk right in without any reservations and take those open seats while we and others were waiting outside in the cold.  At that moment I saw no point in reservations when they were selectively letting people in like they do at the clubs.  after standing outside in the cold for over an hour even with reservations they allowed us to stand inside to wait some more.  When we finally got a seat we were not in a good mood from still having to wait so long even with reservations for only two!  We were sitting to a large group having dinner and all of a sudden one of the ladies jumped up screaming.  I looked over and I saw two cockroaches running around the table and floor.  Not the little cockroaches but the ones that are about 3 inches long!  That right there topped off our experience at Mona Lisa.  The group immediately left there table and who can blame them.  We should of follow their lead but we stuck around unfortunately to be treated like 2nd rate customers.  I will not go back here nor do I recommend them to anyone.  When I think Mona Lisa I think of bad service and cockroaches!", "author": "Tony X."}

After eating at pinnochios on thurs, this place seemed more authentic, less touristy. I did like the atmosphere better, and at a birthday, I guess that's very important. The menu was large, but most of the pasta had no meat. I had something with ham and chicken, which was pretty good, not memorable. Everyone liked their food, but the portions were a bit small. The exception to that was n's pasta dish, which wasn't huge, but normal sized. They came with a side of penne, which wasn't good. the sauce was boring, and the pasta puffy. Everyone else liked it, but I didn't eat it. The sauce on the chicken was a cream tomato sauce, and that was good. for dessert there was some tropical sherbert with white chocolate drizzled on it, which everyone thought was meh, and black forest cake which I did not try but others said was ok. Overall, the service was friendly, the atmosphere nice, but the food was only ok and smallish. If I have to get dragged to north beach again, I'd rather check out someplace else. However, it's not a bad restaurant, just not great.", "author": "Merredith L."}
