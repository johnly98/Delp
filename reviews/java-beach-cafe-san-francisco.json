It's nice simply because it's spacious and everyone is friendly and there's a plethora of outlets. I imagine it must be a nice place to read and hang out during the day too since it's practically next to the beach.\n\nAll in all, a reliable cafe but pricier one.", "author": "Derek T."}

I didn't think about ordering a hot sub.\n\n But of course, I did. Even though it was 45 minutes to closing, the sandwich was made to my kind of perfection. I couldn't even talk to my partner for I was enjoying the sandwich more than expected. Dakota was such a sweetheart. Normally when I go to places that serve beverages and/or food late night, employees give off the impression like they want to go home. Dakota's presence was much more opposite.

Honestly I love this coffee shop in the city right across the street from the beach. It's similar to Chit Chat Cafe in Pacifica but I tend to be closer to SF on Fridays for a nice change of scenery. This is especially one of my go-to shops because they also serve food. There is free parking along the side of the street on La Playa, and is very low-hassle to get here via Great Highway. I also came here at night after Outsidelands and it was great to warm up to a nice cup of hot chocolate at like 10pm. \n\nAs a self-proclaimed whipped cream aficionado, this place has the cream (ohoho) of the crop on top of their mochas and hot chocolates. I also love that you can get their bagels with pesto or sun-dried tomato cream cheese. It's literally a game changer. \n\nThe wifi is a bit spotty here depending on what you're working on (I have xfinity wifi so it doesn't really matter).

Home made dressing with sirracha yet not really spicy but rather sweet, and cranberries on top of it just make this delicious!\nThe sandwich was good but a little dry. I did like it was warm and it had really good flavors.\nMy latte was delicious too. Better than any chain coffee shop will ever serve you.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and worked very fast. They were very accommodating. \n\nThere is tons of seating both inside as outside. They have their own style. Inside tables are made of surf boards. Or you can sit by the bar. Everything is wood. Outside even on the side every space is used to provide seating. Just so much character in this establishment!\n\nThe only minor issue was the single restroom, it was gross but I guess unisex and only one available needs constant maintenance to be able to keep it clean.\n\nGreat experience and very cheap especially for SF and location!

I can sympathize because my pretending-to-work-in-a-coffee-shop days weren't too long ago. \n\nThe sandwiches at Java Beach aren't half bad, but you probably won't be able to find a seat if you come here for lunch because more than 75% of the occupants are on their laptops and unlikely to budge for hours. The atmosphere is lightyears away from the cozy beachside cafe it had the potential to be. Some denizens of the communal table will even have the nerve to give you a dirty look when you pointedly refer to the seat next to them where their backpack is resting and ask, \"Is this seat free?\" because how dare you have the audacity to want to eat the $12 sandwich you paid for. (It was too windy to sit outside -- surprise, surprise.)\n\nThe Java Club and Kelly's Cove sandwiches were sort of run-of-the-mill, albeit filling and the chips were a nice touch. But the service was slow (they didn't apologize about forgetting one of the sandwiches in my order either) and the coffee was burnt.

This review is essentially for the owner rather than other customers. Mr/Mrs owner, your employees are showing up wasted to work and making a mess of your establishment. \n\n\nToday the girl running the cash register was high off her mind and was messing up everyone's orders. Here is how my interaction went.\n\n1. I placed my drink order and she ran my card and then dropped what was the tip change from the previous customer towards me instead of the tip jar.\n2. It fell all over the counter because I wasn't expecting it and I put it into the tip jar for her. She apologized and placed a to go coffee cup on the counter saying that's what she meant to give me (which made no sense either, but at this point I was still giving her the benefit of the doubt so ignored that comment)\n3. After waiting 12 minutes for my drink, I went back to the counter to ask her what was up, but she was already being asked by another customer about an order of theirs that was missing as well.\n4. She finally got that other customer their drink and then fumbled through the iPad to look for my order and concluded she forgot to put it in for me. \n5. I said ok never mind and left only to check my bank activity once outside to see that she did charge me. \n6. I went back again  (past a new customer line now out the door, and a shorter queue of confused customers that didn't have their orders for a while) to tell her she had charged me and she then made up a different story, that she had heard \"coffee\" instead of \"iced mocha.\"\n7. She made my drink while holding up the line, which is when I heard other customers saying to each other \"she's so high\" and \"that girl is so wasted\" which is when I realized what was going on. \n8. I called the cafe later to let the owner know what was going on and I'm pretty sure it was the same girl who answered and told me she was the manager. I asked for the number of the owner who I tried calling but found a full voicemail box and so leaving this message here instead. \n\nJust in case you didn't know what was up mr/ms cafe owner.", "author": "Afaan N."}

The place is dirty, the staff rarely empties the garbage cans (I ebussed my table but the trash can was so full the trash ended up on the ground), the layout is awkward, the outside seating area is pretty run down and finally nearly every indoor seat is monopolized by people staring into their frickin laptops sipping their herbal matcha lattes for three hours. I know this review is pretty bad, especially by my standards, but strangely I keep going back. What they have going for them is a kick ass location and some pretty good cafe food, a few items slightly overpriced but good nevertheless. My kid loves the pesto, tomato melt so much he constantly begs for me to head out to the beach for his favorite sandwich this side of Ike's. The hot sandwiches are toasted just right and they pile on some tasty chips but I must say the beers are measly (what's up with the little cups?). Finally I challenge you to leave the counter without one of their decadent chocolate chip cookies, good luck! So, for now, get a sandwich and a cookie and head over to the beach and hopefully sooner or later they can do a remodel and also find an exterminator to relieve them of their annoying table hogs.\nAlso the Sloat location has pretty much the same food but I also found it dirty. I will say that one of the women who worked there thanked me for bussing my table and was very polite.  Another big plus is they have far fewer people on laptops at that location so there is a more social vibe.", "author": "Ralph S."}

The location had a beach vibe and the people working here were hella chill. We wanted to order individual sandwiches (good thing we did not!) but decided that one would suffice. We got the turkey BLT, which was delicious and came with a side of chips (just the correct portions).

It's a good place for studying/working or for grabbing a coffee before taking a stroll on the beach.\n\nThe bathroom situation irked me. There were unnecessarily gendered bathrooms with a baby-changing station (which is a plus) situated in the ladies' bathroom (a negative). In SF, I think we can expect this to change. My suggestion: call them both bathrooms and mark the one with the baby-changing table.", "author": "L F."}

We waited about 10 minutes in line and another 25 for food \n\nWe ordered the Club Sandwich with turkey and it was supposed to be toasted -- it wasn't. We also added sprouts and pesto instead of mayo -- they forgot the pesto. Overall it could of been a really good sandwich but they forgot a few of the extra things that would of \"made\" the sandwich for us. \n\nAlso ordered the Arnold Palmer and the ratio of tea to lemonade was more so lemonade - might have more so ordered lemonade. Where was the tea? Could have been better \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they were incredibly busy that their lack of attention to detail came in, or if that's how it always is, but we were hungry and made the best of it. \n\nI would try somewhere else in the area if I had an option to next time.

Not on ciabatta. They were both on two flimsy pieces on bread. $25 for this? I get that you were in over your head today, but here's an idea-- stop taking orders.

All the tables were taken by people on laptops, even four person tables taken by one person. So we had to sit outside, and it was freezing cold outside! Obviously they can't control the weather, but maybe put in some bar space, or rearrange to fit more table or ask single people to not sit at four person table and sip coffee all day. \n\nI couldn't decide whether I should have gotten the veggie sandwich or the pesto tomato sandwich. I got the latter and it was a bad choice. You couldn't even taste the pesto!!! \n\nAlso, we couldn't hear our names called because we were outside, so who knew how long our food was sitting on the counter. If you have outdoor seating, you should probably get a speaker or run out and check with the people outside. \n\nWe ended up eating in our car because it was so cold, and it was just not a very good experience.

At this point my toddler has had enough and we are all starving and there are not a lot of other food options in the area. I explain look what can we do here? I need food for my daughter. She apologized and then said they would figure it out right away. \n\n3:35pm: Finally we get the food and she explains they have no idea why but our food was never ordered or placed. (Ok but yet that was my wilted veggie sandwich?) She said she has no idea what happened.

I love love love this place. If its a sunny Saturday or Sunday this is definitely a go-to spot for me for a coffee and a snack. Located just steps away from Ocean Beach, Java Beach Cafe makes for one poppin' spot. With their outdoor patio, yummy grub and relaxed beach-vibe it is definitely a restaurant I would recommend to those who find themselves in the Sunset district. \n\nFood-wise, Java Beach Cafe serves up some mean sandwiches. Anything from bagels to BLTs. Today I had the pesto veggie bagel on Asiago and booooy was it good! The pesto cream cheese and fresh veggies were precisely what I needed to wake me up...the cappuccino definitely helped there too. Alongside the sandwiches they also have great pastries, including scones, muffins, croissants - you name it and it's fresh! \n\nIf you make your way out to Java Beach Cafe on a beautiful day, don't be surprised if there is a line. My suggestion: WAIT! Line moves quickly and the food it worth it. You'll probably end up waiting for about 5 - 10 minutes for your drinks and food once you order at the counter, but the staff really work hard and do a great job.", "author": "Aletta B."}

Ill leave my order that simple from now on.\nI ordered the veggie sandwich which doesn't come with avocado. No bigs. I ordered it with avo and the counter person assured me that it comes with it. Awesome. It is also supposedly \"stacked high\" with cheese of your choice. I got pepper jack. BF ordered the chicken club. \nWe ordered it to go. Bf waited inside while i sat at the patio. 10 min go by. Then 16. Then 20. He then asked about the order and it had been sitting at the pick up counter with no announcement. By this time im legit hangry. We take our sandos to the beach. I bite in. No avo. No red bell pepper. 1 slice of cheese. So basically $13 for a pretty simple veggie sandwich on sliced wheat with sprouts, onion,cucumber, 1 slice of cheese. A $6 sando at best. \nThe thing is, the menu is NOT THAT HARD.  Im not giving slack bc they were busy. They are always busy, so the staff should be used to it by now. Calling orders loudly is important in a crowded place and so is getting an order correct on a pretty straightforward menu. \nBoo.", "author": "Nitalia P."}

However, the espresso was TERRIBLE-tasted like burnt sludge and we only received one when we had ordered two..we didn't want the second one because EW. \n\nThe service was REALLY slow for the quality of food that we got, but the guy ringing us up did give us advanced notice that the sandwich was going to take 15 minutes, so we definitely appreciated that. \n\nAnother odd note-this guy decided to site in between us and another pair of diners on one of their small benched tables, which was awkward but ok.  Then we noticed that he wasn't wearing any shoes (EW) and he kept saying how bad the salad that I ordered normally was. Getting more awkward.  Then- he asked if he could have my roll from my plate, which OK i wasnt going to eat, and then in a really self-entitled way said \"hand me your butter\".... SO WEIRD/STRANGE.

I.e Java Beach\" \n\nThis is what Java does best, it makes you feel good, it's makes you feel warm, and most importantly the place cultivates your deepest most intrinsic pleasures and dreams. But who cares, whats this review all about, I'll tell you about my experience and why Webster himself believes Java beach to be the definition of hospitality. \n\nI walk in around 10pm, I'm hungry I'm tried and irritated. I walk up to the counter and immediately I hear a familiar humm. The homies in the back are playing \"purple rain\" by the artist formally known as prince. It takes me back to the 80s and it reminds me of my past love. Her name was Lucy Ann and she loved doing recreational drugs in neon lit buildings (RIP). Also RIP to The artist formally known as prince. Back to the story. My homie Bryan or maybe his name is Ryan.. Idk. But he's a good dude and he tells me about the day and hooks it up with some warm coffee and a takes my sandwhich order. The coffee was fire and the sandwhich was consistent. I mean for ducks sakes they put three slices of bread in there BLTs and you better believe that shit was grass feed organic and seasonal driven. All is well in my life, then suddenly a wild homeless man appears. \n\nHe's belligerent; drunk and wet with who knows what. The place is starting to reek and I start to get uncomfortable. The homeless man is bothering everyone making a mess and trying to cause a casual ol fashioned ruckus.  Then Ryan or Bryan walks up to the homeless man and elequently calms him down. First the homeless man is in his own blurred world, but eventually Ryan's or Bryan's soothing and calm voice gets through the man. Amazingly the homeless man walks out, almost calmer and more silent than before. 10 outta 10 would dine again. \n\nThe only thing I don't like about the place is the lack of paper towels in the bathroom.

There are two cafe's in the chain, one by the zoo and the other closer towards the cliff house, just off of Judah. Both near the ends of muni lines and perfect for grabbing a little picnic to eat on, or to relax in after a little stroll along ocean beach.\n\nI love both caf\u00e9s. They have relaxed atmosphere, are light and airy and ooze personality. \n\nI have to say I prefer the one just off of Judah, but that's because there are more places to sit outside and it's got the park opposite, so feels more load back than the one by the zoo which is on the main road.\n\nHowever there is friendly service, great food and consistency across the two locations, so there is little between the two locations and I would visit either.\n\nPerfect for a brunch, or using their free wifi, to sit and check your emails.\n\nI absolutely love the tsunami and bonfire sandwiches, made fresh and rammed full these are huge!\n\nAnd whoever thought of the beef and ginger sauce combo for the bonfire sandwich is a genius.\n\nAlthough I would recommend that you go for the mixed salad rather than the chips however with your sandwich order. I find them a little plain and lacklustre - and personally I am a huge fan of rocket (arugula here I the US).\n\nAlso check out the pastries, the croissants aren't half bad, I found it so hard finding decent ones in the US, and whilst these don't live up to the ones from France, they are some of the best I found. I really liked the grilled ham ones.\n\nCookies, muffins and cakes are also good and you get a good sized treat for your dollar.\n\nMy only criticism is that I really am not a fan of their coffee. Have a taste yourself, they'll let you sample.

Hot, toasted, and freshly made open faced sandwich with alozzzaaa mozzarella, hardly any pesto tho. Tomato slices yes. Pretty tasty and very filling. Sandwiches also come with a side of house-made crispy salt and vinegar chips. Crazy burst of sour and salty. (A little too much salt for my taste). This is a meal worthy of many napkins from all the cheesy meltage oozing and bread crumbs.\n-Sandwiches are hugeee with several layers, specifically if you get anything with the dutch crunch roll.

I added a bunch of cocoa powder and cinnamon which kinda helped. My boyfriend ordered some blackberry Irish soda bread which was very good. And I ordered the Italian chopped salad without garbanzo beans. Which came out and was quite disappointed. I paid $12.50 for romaine, and 3 tiny artichoke hearts, a few strips of meat, and pieces of cheese. Boring and bland.  Totally not worth the money!!

They do have outside seating as well which was both convenient and nice because you can hear and smell the beach. The employees were awesome. Really making you feel welcome. \n\nI ordered the Tsunami with the works. Salami, Ham, and Mortadella. I had it with Swiss cheese, pepperoncinis, pickles, tomatoes and mayo on Ciabatta bread. I ordered the Large which was more then plenty of food for anyone. Absolutely packed to the max with amazing ingredients. It melts in your mouth with every bite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-05", "description": "I think this is the first cafe in San Francisco that I felt at home.  I like this side of town much more than my side of town (South Beach) because it's less commercialized, less industrialized and peaceful.  I'm not saying that I could live here, but this side of town + Java Beach is a perfect getaway to have some time for yourself.  It's a nice change of pace.\n\n1) Although it's next to the Pacific, Java Beach is always really toasty inside - even if you sit by the door.  And I don't actually think Ocean Beach is as cold as everyone thinks it is.  It can get awfully windy sometimes, but most of the time after studying, I'll either go for a run at OB or just dip my feet in the water (:\n\n2) Their white chocolate mochas are SO DELICIOUS... and I don't even usually order them at cafes because I can get snooty about what constitutes \"good\" coffee (sue me, I'm in law school).  I can't say the food is that good, though.  It's whatever.\n\n3) Sometimes on weeknights, there will be live music from local musicians who will play covers to all your favourite oldies!  \n\n4) My favourite part about coming here, however, is the people I get to meet.  I was reading Kerouac's \"On the Road\" once when someone came up to me and told me how that book was difficult to find when he was younger, but that it made him move to San Francisco.  Another time, I was studying, and a woman came over, told me about how her kids went to law school and encouraged me to study hard... and that it'd all be worth it.\n\n5) More practical matters: So easy to get to because it's at the end of the N line.  I take it all the way from near the Ballpark and will just read on the Muni.  There will always be parking if you drive, too.\n\n6) It also gets really busy.  So come early if you want a seat!  There are also a lot of outlets, so no worries there.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

But, this location has a comfortable interior design, the couches, the outdoor seating (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7SRJWnPVRxwqke3d82qefw?select=SV8rw2gehrZRemBNQrwL8w), the wines and the beers on tap (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7SRJWnPVRxwqke3d82qefw?select=4DGEQVkBBn1zQd5YupOoyw), the Pacific Ocean waves as background noise. Hence, the four stars instead.\n\nDid not get that last star due to the difficulty in finding parking very close by. Not their fault, but it's a dealmaker, though there is a lot of parking parallel to the Great Highway=Hwy 1 (not the side where you can see the ocean, but the other side - between the highway and the apartments and houses).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-12", "description": "I've been to Java Beach Cafe *several* times since moving to San Francisco three-ish years go. It's right near the beach, has big windows that let the light in, and it's staffed with awesome baristas who definitely deserve their tips (tip, people! -- you think working minimum wage and slaving over our coffees and latte art all day is actually paying the bills? Someone awesome with a great personality poured you that perfect cup of joe while standing on their feet all day and ruining their back, so throw a dollar in the tip jar, ya' cheap-o!).\n\nHere are all the reasons one should go to Java Beach Cafe:\n\n* Planning on laying out at the beach all morning? Java Beach Cafe is located right off the sandy strip and is the perfect spot to come grab a tall iced tea with lemon after you've soaked up your vitamin D for the day.\n* There's nothing better than a triple-stack toasted sourdough sandwich with three layers of chicken, bacon, avocado, tomato, and more, all sitting pretty next to an overflowing pile of salty potato chip goodness. Mmmm.\n* Talk about a perfect latte! Just the right amount of cool latte art laying over warm espresso and milk. When you take that first sip, your lip piercing the foamy cream, the rush of hot espresso washing over your tongue after is -- ugh. Just. So. Good.\n* Working on a manuscript? Need to get through the last few pages of your favorite novel? Want to zone out in front of your computer for a few hours just surfing Reddit? Feel like whipping out your sketchbook and doodling during peak people-watching hours? Java Beach Cafe has *tons* of table space, lots of outlets, and available Wifi with decent speed (though not speedy enough to, say, run Netflix).\n\nI've been here early in the day to snag a coffee before taking walks along the beach, and it's always swimming with people. Folks *love* Java Beach Cafe, and peak people-watching time is definitely from noon to 5PM.\n\nI've also been here late at night for meet ups with fellow novel writers, as well as to simply relax after a long day and get some reading in, jacking my adrenal glands with caffeine despite realizing I shouldn't be drinking their tasty soy-milk lattes right before bed. Things get pretty slow and quiet at night -- the baristas more friendly (now that they have time to chat with the customers individually) and the people more quiet (folks in San Francisco generally respect that others are trying to get actual work done if they're at a cafe this late at night), but the food and coffee stays just as delicious.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a nice, chill spot that is sometimes peppered with surfers but mostly visited by the locals (this is *not* a \"tourist\" spot, though it very well could be), this is the place for you. It's one of my favorite cafes in the city, and for good reason.\n\nI can't wait to go back for another latte!", "author": "Sherilynn M."}

Some highlights/lowlights:\n\nThe restaurant was very crowded with a long line out the front. Normally a great sign, but it led to a couple problems: chiefly a fairly long wait (~30 minutes) for a couple simple sandwiches, and a cramped dining room. I lost count of the number of times I bumped into others while waiting in line, walking to get something, or sitting at my seat. I get the need for tables to handle all these people, but in some ways wish there were less so it wasn't so cramped.\n\nI was mildly annoyed when I ordered chips in addition to my sandwich, only to find they came for free with my sandwich. Thanks for the heads-up, menu board and cashier that didn't say anything about that...\n\nFood was pretty good, mainly due to excellent ingredients. Had the chicken club sandwich. Great sourdough, avocado, tomato. The chicken was a little peppery but still okay.\n\nAmazing location right near the beach. Can't beat that.\n\nAll in all this place was fine.

Warm, creamy, and very homey.  I did not once think of canned soup, and instead wondered exactly what went into it to make it so incredibly comforting to eat.\n\nJasmine Green Tea:  Who can mess up green tea?  Nobody in my experience in 23 years.  Java House is no exception to this trend.\n\nThe only problems with this place are a really a result of it's popularity.  Very limited seating, very close to overwhelmed staff. Pleasantries were not a priority, neither was picking up all the \"for here\" dishes.  They seemed to be out of a lot of pastry items and specials, but I suppose we did get there a bit after typical lunch time.

Sub. Hands down an amazing sandwich.  It's a warm sandwich, with toasted bread, several layers of delicious sliced meat, melted cheese, and fresh vegetables on it. There's a great sauce on it, which I think is only an italian style dressing, but I'm not particularly sure. I typically get salami and provolone with everything but jalape\u00f1os on it, which something I HIGHLY suggest.\n\nCoffees are typical, not the best or worst in the area. I do enjoy the Caramel Latte, which is just delicious. I add a scoop of brown sugar to make it a bit sweeter, but it's already sweet as it is. \n\nIf you're looking for breakfast, I'd suggest the Pesto Bagel or the Hummus Bagel, both delicious and will make your breath smell like onions for hours. Something so tasty must have downfall, right?\n\nThe cafe is pretty small and compact in terms of seating inside. I love that there's outdoor seating, but it tends to be too cold to be out there sometimes. There's FREE WIFI, which is amazing! I can get work done and have lunch at the same time. That's a plus. But I guess a negative could be that there could be a long line on the weekends depending on when you go. Sometimes it's out the door!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-19", "description": "Here's the skinny. Pull up a chair and read. \n\nJava Beach is the original beach cafe in this area and still reigns supreme as the best \"meet up for a cup of coffee\" place in the Outer Sunset. Everyone else can put their hands down. \n\nI've lived in the area for 11 years, watched new coffee places sprout up, tried them, and found myself unimpressed with overall service and vibe. What I loved about this beach nook was it's unassuming, quiet energy. You can actually call this home, as opposed to a place where you rent. You know your neighbors and the shop owners.  That is being changed by the new self-important, hipster businesses. \n\nBeing \"hip\" has come to mean treating customers as inconveniences; the staff at the new places in the area give the impression that they couldn't care less about your business, but damn they're awfully concerned about their clothes, hair, and tattoos. And hey--I like tattoos, but not with an a-hole attitude when I'm giving you my money. I was barked at by the crazy owner of Trouble the first time I went in for standing inside with my coffee for too long: \"This isn't a hangout kind of coffee shop!\"--I was there for all of 10 minutes when no one else was in there. I'm not kidding. WTF? Who  treats their customers that way? Of course, like any normal customer, I never went back. \n\nAt Java Beach, I've always been met with a courteous counter person who seems to know that an important aspect of their job is to greet the customers. The coffee is what coffee should be; flavorful and hot--nothing exotic that you have to wait 15 minutes for. Plenty of tea selections and lots of baked goods and meal items--reasonably priced and tasty.  I used to love their toasted Italian sub with provolone and hots (gawd, drooling thinking about it), but since giving up meat I now enjoy a savory tuna salad sammich. :) The bran muffins are delish--with coconut and raisins, they are super chewy and HUGE. The oatmeal cookies are pretty stunning, too. Never been disappointed by any item off the menu, really.\n\nThere is ample seating both inside and out, and if you feel the need for an afternoon beer, there are many on tap at the traditional style bar off to the side (I prefer a Black and Tan or Guinness). There is wifi and they don't hassle you for patronizing their business--because who would do that?  Whenever I have an Outer Sunset meet up, we hang at Java Beach. \n\nIt should be said that the owners, Pat and Buffy, are two of the nicest business owners in the neighborhood. They are locals who have always respected, supported, and given back to the community, by hosting block parties, beach clean-ups, and landscaping less than attractive parts of lower great highway into lush mini parks, that don't require building parklets in the street. Yeah, parklet--nice in theory, but at night, when no one is using them-- including the homeless because there's no comfortable place to lie down-- we locals are still trying to park our cars, thanks. I've seen the owner of Trouble park her freaking Vanagon on the sidewalk at night when she can't find a spot. I guess she doesn't know we actually have a couple of local wheelchair users. She also double parks it on Judah. Good thing we have that parklet now... Java Beach thrives without taking away from the mellow local beach vibe, which is definitely being drained. They have always been kind to and supportive of local musicians, artisans, other businesses, their customers, and the good-hearted public servants that call the sunset home. \n\nJava Beach is a classy coffee shop that serves its hardworking, beach demographic well. Bang for your buck, filling, and yummy, courteous, spacious. No bizarre menus, no obnoxious pretense. An Outer Sunset institution that deserves your business. Period.", "author": "Caliope S."}

I remember the good ol' days when you could roll up to Java Beach, actually get a seat and get your order in under 10 minutes.\n\nMaybe this was when I was young and idealistic and didn't know any better, but I remember this place being a lot less crowded. And really, when all I want is a place to sit with a bagel and some coffee, I don't want crazy crowded, all I want is a seat.\n\nSince I have moved to the Outer Sunset, I try to come to Java Beach as a local, but the line and crowd always trumps my interest in staying. I mean, I don't want to pan a place for being popular, and in many ways getting the popularity it deserves, but for CHRISTSAKE CAN'T A GIRL GET A SEAT!\n\nNow I just walk up, survey the line and assess the situation. It often means taking it to go and sitting on the beach (not bad at all, pretty awesome if I do say so myself), or taking it back to my apartment. \n\nSo, all in all, good food, ok coffee, crazy lines.", "author": "Liz I."}

While there were people there, it still wasn't too crowded and we were able to find a table without any problems.  I decided to get a croissanwich - turkey and cheese, I believe.  It's a giant croissant that they toast for you and it was yummy.  A got a humongosaur bran muffin that was as a big as my head.  It looked really healthy.  And no, he didn't finish the whole thing.  He packed it up and took it home with him.

They were chasing birds on the side walk, and I was afraid that they accidentally step out to the street by following birds.)

Ho-to-the-fuckin'-hum.  It reminds me of going to the decaying A&W drive-in in rural Montana growing up.

I can't figure it out. Are they local tourists?  Did they read about this place in the Chronicle? Did they get a \"deal\"?  It's a steady stream- they get their coffee, have dull conversation for 15 minutes, leave, and are immediately replaced by a facsimile.  \n-Lots of runners/cycle folks- spandex and sweat, deftly highlighting middle-aged dudes' junk- but maybe that's a plus for you.\n-Fleece.\n-Babies.\n-Couples who are clearly on their first OKCupid date.

Despite ordering my sandwich with \"The Works\", it showed up with only a couple of lonely jalapenos and a swab of mustard. I decided not to push the issue of the lack of lettuce, tomatoes, and well everything else that makes a sandwich delicious, but did ask for a bit of mayo to help it all go down a bit easier. The chic couldn't have been more annoyed. Finally, when I asked for a box to take home my half-eaten poorly-made sandwich, the gal behind the counter looked at me like I had just asked her to hand over a hundred bucks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-16", "description": "I LOVE this cafe. It's near where I live and I would usually come here with my bestfriend so we'd get our drinks for a sit down chat and take a walk on great highway!\n\nI've gotten some sandwiches, coffee and muffins, but now I stick to chai lattes! \n\nFirst off, the service is freaking awesome. They don't try hard, they are not ever bad - they're just really friendly people. First thing you deal with getting a product is the service, and Java Beach cafe on Ocean, will pass with flying colors. \n\nTheir sandwiches are a little pricey, but you can customize your own! Great sandwiches though. When you're almost finished with your drink, it's not cool to see the powder and leftover residue sitting on the bottom of your drink. Java's chai latte and coffee do not have that residue... which is awesome that it's not some fake all powder mix. I had their banana muffin a few times before and they're great, but I love anything banana, bias?  lol yeah.\n\nPrice for drinks (depends on what you ordered, steamed milk, chai, coffee, tea etc) range around $4 for a large and around $4.50 - $5 for a jumbo. \nSmall is tiny, medium is small, large is medium, and jumbo is large - seriously. But it's worth it!\n\nGet your order and they'll be there within' a few minutes, unless you ordered a sandwich, a lot of things or something really complicated. (not a real long of a wait)\n\nThey used to have sofas there instead of the new wooden benches and wooden surfboard-like tables. Glad they changed it! Because it was .. sometimes unsanitary and people stayed there as if they were in their homes, just chillin' away. But yes! The tables, chairs and benches just perfectly fit in and I love it. This place is usually packed. It can be hard to find a seat especially on a nice weather, wait, sorry... actually it's hard to find a seat in the morning and afternoon. Evening after 9, less people. There are seats outside!!!! Inside the place is clean and sanitary, which is good despite them having so many people coming in and out of the cafe. \n\nIf you're in the area or going to the beach near Judah, Beach Chalet, Cliff House - do stop by Java Cafe. It's a really mellow place... and the N Metro train is righttttt next to it. Great for coming back from work, or wherever, and the last stop is 48th, and there's Java!\n\n+ they have performances either friday or saturday nights starting at 7pm from local artists.", "author": "Jae T."}

I pulled out my lap top, enjoyed some free wifi, sipped my hot tea, read, people watched and was just in heaven.  This place totally made my day.  Thank you Java Beach Cafe.", "author": "Kasumi L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-13", "description": "I use to come here over ten years ago, when it wasn't crazy busy every day. The place has changed into a serious locals hang out spot. I still come here if I want to get out of the house. \n\nPROS:\nFREE WiFi (sometimes doesn't work because there's so many people on it)\n\nHappy hour 5-7pm. Beer only. They have good wine but happy hour doesn't cover it.\n\nSweetest customer service you'll experience at cafe.\n\nExtremely bad next to dead cell phone reception, doesn't matter what plan. So most people can't hold a conversation on the phone in the cafe next you! You have to go outside and wait for your signal to get a \"Can you hear me now?\" Yyyyeah! :)\n\nThey also have bar seating. Beer on tap!\n\nTheir food is good. They have great big salads, soups, delicious sandwiches, and baked goods. \n\nStrangely always warm and super cozy inside even if it's negative 1 billion Fahrenheit outside.\n\nGIRLS AND BOYS: Good looking fit singles come here. You can get a date easy. But beeee careful and talk it out or get to the point; a hot single guy is often later joined by his cute girlfriend, or the hot single girl you started talking to and making jokes with is often joined later by her boyfriend, and you are doused with lame putz gold immediately. I actually like to watch that happen. That's some damn good entertainment, especially a regular like me, and you know that girl has a bf, and some dude is talking her up, and I'm just waiting for the bf to come later and sit down, and watch that hidden crush of sour disappointment and sudden surprise on the dudes face as he watches the bf hug and kiss the girl and then take his seat. That is better than HBO!\n\nGet a hot drink, and walk across the street to the beach. A tradition of most people: they get a drink leave and watch the sunset. \nTIPS AND TRICKS: Leave the beach immediately after watching the sun go down, because it gets flooded with people who just came from watching the sunset in the cold, and now want a hot drink across the street. My suggestion, if you don't need to see the sunset get there a half hour before the sun starts setting to guarantee your seat. \n\nCONS:\nIt gets too crazy busy, and sometimes there's no seating at all, and you have to sit outside in the cold, or not stay at all. Years ago it was never like this. On a sunny day though, outside is seating is great.\n\nIf it gets too busy for long period of time, sometimes the staff can get a little short ended with their nerves. Be patient with your orders, it will come, so don't keep asking about it. Always order with a smile, and another smile WILL return to you.\n\nYUPPIES have decided to turn this place into a hang out. There's not too many but it does happen. And of course their conversations are annoying. One yuppie robot was behind me talking really loudly about his reservations for some party, so he can impress everyone who was forced to listen to him...he also had a glass of champagne in his hand. Nothing wrong with having a glass of bubbly, but there can be something wrong with the way you do it. \n\nCouches are getting worn down and grimy. Time to get new ones Java Beach! New couches at a busy public establishment should be changed at least every few years!\n******UPDATE: June 14 2013 ******\nThey replaced the couches with wooden benches and tables. The cafe can hold even more people! The new seats are not as comfy for long stays, so you may have to sit on your jacket or something. But the place and layout look very nice!\n***************\n\n\nPRO-CON:\nSan Francisco's weirdos, alternatives, and senior citizen loners are here. Now this can make for many an interesting afternoon conversation, and I've had many here over the years. But the eccentrics, and half bums can also make you want to not make eye contact outside of your own table aura, or to tell someone 'hey stop looking at my laptop screen, my private business is not a conversation piece.' But it is a public cafe, and not your livingroom, and you decided to come here.\n\nPRO-CON:\nLive music Thursday-Sunday around 7:30-8pmish to about closing 10:30ish-11. Great music all the time! From folk to bluegrass, to country. This is great if you've come to get out of the house or to grab a drink with a friend. Not so cool if you have to study, listen to something on your laptop, listen to your own music, or work on a music based project, or have some serious work to do. You'll just get frustrated with the loud presence of the band, and leave. This is actually catching on, as I see less and less people coming to study around music nights. \n\n\nAfter you come to Java Beach a handful of times, you'll feel like it's a second home. That comfy local feeling will set in you, and you won't go to other cafes. Come a lot, and you'll see the regulars and make friends. Come a lot a lot, and the baristas will call you by name when you walk in...and you have become a serious local, and for those of you who aren't SF natives, that's as close as a feeling to it that you can g", "author": "Todd P."}

I practically had to force myself to finish it because I didn't want to waste such a tasty sandwich. All of the sandwiches come with some pretty tasty chips. I don't know anything about the chips, but they were crunchy, yummy, and looked of the homemade variety.\n\nI love the mix of people here as well. Today I saw San Jose Bike Police (supporting the breast cancer walk), older-aged tourists, a group of laptop-clad students, and a couple of surfers. All of the people working today were pleasant.

Its the edge of the earth out in these parts; this place is at the corner of Abyss Avenue and Black Hole Boulevard.  Its so far out, that the muni train actually makes a loop and retreats back the other way if you can believe that.  Its wind swept, sandy, and all the houses are weather-beaten.  Same goes for most of the patrons in this joint, which is filled with middle-aged guys who sure look like they've had too much sun, for as infrequently as the sun actually makes itself known out this way.  Oddly, there were also a number of young hotties when I was here.  A spattering of hippies, outdoorsy couples and old russian dudes filled out the dance card.  A strange mix of humans collect at this coffee outpost on the lost frontier indeed.  \r\n\r\nThe sandwich did not disappoint.  Got the large three meat combo sandwich for $6.95 and chose turkey (fresh roasted, not that processed stuff), mortadella, salami and provolone with mustard, mayo, letoos, onyone and their special sauce on a french roll.  They bake it all melty like.  And the quantity of meat on this sandwich was impressive. Very generous actually.  Other Yelpers have commented on the surly service.  I didn't find this to be the case.  In face, for as busy as it was, they were highly efficient with getting orders processed and out the door.

It has a mix of a laidback and crowded environment with free wifi, outdoor seating, and groovy music--most tables are usually taken by customers reading up of their news so expect to fight for a seat and table.\n\nI always order the everyday latte or tea---nothing extraordinary but the beachy atmosphere more than compensates. Keep in mind it's CASH ONLY, although they do have a small atm machine inside but it's better to come cash ready to save yourself the $3 service fee.\n\nOverall, getting coffee at Java Beach is like a 30 minute escape vacation to the beach away from SF city life. It's a fabulous place to catch up with a buddy over some coffee and for some precious me-time!", "author": "Ellen W."}

So by this logic, Java Beach is my neighborhood cafe. \n\nThe coffee at Java Beach is good. I'm an espresso snob--I hate that burnt sludge they call coffee at Starbucks and Peet's. And they serve it in real mugs. Drinking a latte from a paper cup is liking drinking wine from one of those big red plastic cups. It's best left to college kids. Java Beach also serves beer and wine which raises it above most cafes. Parking is great, of course, because this is Ocean Beach. It can be hard to find a seat, however, even when it's cold and foggy. \n\nI was grading at Java Beach Cafe several weeks ago and I looked around and saw signs advertising parties for surfers, firemen, and Gaelic Footballers. Seriously? This neighborhood might just be perfect. I am so moving here.", "author": "Susan S."}

Perfect for a sunny day, plus the N line stops right there. I will say the food left much to be desired though. I ordered the Bonfire Delight roast beef sandwich and my friend ordered the Java BLT sandwich with chicken. The roast beef had a bit of a hotdog flavor--not good, but the roll was nice and crunchy, but not so crunchy you left with a scraped up mouth. The Java sandwich wasn't anything to call home about, but it was pretty much what you'd think chicken, bacon, tomato and bread taste like. No surprise flavors there. \n\nThey also had a nice selection of beer to compliment your meal.\n\nI would recommend this to a friend because of the location and the fact that they serve beer and I would probably go back on another sunny day, but I'll be giving something else on the menu a try.", "author": "Ashley B."}

Parking seems to be limited on a busy day.  But I was able to find a parking spot near a neighborhood 2 blocks away.  I loved how the cafe is located right at the corner of the street- a very short distance from the beach.  \n\nType of food: Coffee, espresso drinks, tea, pastries, sandwiches \n\nAmbiance:\nFor a Monday, late morning, the place was pretty busy.  The decor fits the beach theme and very hipster feeling.  There are big couches, tables and outside seating.  A cozy place to hangout- you get the salty breeze from the ocean. Right when you walk in, you smell the freshly roasted coffee beans.  Seems like a great place to grab a latte and a muffin; walk the short distance to the beach and read a nice book.\n\nService:\nThey have an extensive menu.  But I settled for a latte because that is the only drink to test their espresso flavor.  They have four different sizes, the medium size looks like a regular size small at other cafes.  \n\nTaste: \nI ordered a triple (3 shots of espresso) soy latte in a medium size.  I was nervous that ordering a triple shot would make my latte super bitter.  However, call me crazy, but it wasn't that intense, but still a strong espresso punch.  Anyways, the flavor of the coffee bean was fresh and smooth.  I really enjoyed my latte, and I can't wait to try something else next time.  I definitely need to try the sandwiches, they looked scrumptious.  \n\nPrice:\nThere was a $5 minimum charge for credit cards.  For coffee, the price was average. When I heard that my medium sized drink had a choice of 2 or 3 shots, I went for more caffeine.  $4.20 is a pretty good deal for a soy latte with 3 shots.\n\nOverall:\nI really enjoyed the chill and laid back atmosphere.  The coffee was fresh and delicious. Can't wait to come back.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I'm not expecting the best coffee or espresso in the city when I come to Java beach. They're open early and close later than most places in Outer Sunset which can be really great. They have free wi-fi and a lot of plugs so you can stay all day with your laptop if you need to - which is how I wound up writing 80% of my masters thesis here. The baked goods aren't really anything to write home about, they can be stale sometimes, but the sandwiches are HUGE and the bagels are pretty good (this is coming from a girl who grew up on NYC bagels). I'm awkwardly a ~*regular*~ now and the stuff here has always been incredibly friendly and kind - it seems they definitely try to get to know people who come in regularly. They have live music at night most Fridays - Sundays and that can be a little annoying/loud but it's pretty consistent so you'd know to expect it. When it winds up actually being sunny in Outer Sunset people flock here before going to the beach (or after going to the beach only to be devoured by the fog) and it can get really crowded and leave you with a long wait time for food - which is why being able to call in your order is awesome. I'm also that girl who regularly asks to share a table with strangers who have room at theirs and no one has seemed really opposed to that yet so if it's crowded don't be afraid to ask someone to split a table with you! I also totally love the all the regulars here who gather around at night and play their guitars outside and drink beer - it's nice to see a little community going on here :)", "author": "Meaghan B."}

Their coffee quality is the best.  Bernie's  blend is my favorite.  It's their strongest coffee but is not dark blend, very important in my opinion.  I hate taste of burned coffee, and Bernie's blend is nothing like that.  You actually taste  coffee.  They have other bends available, and as any coffee place it has many choices of blended drinks.  Be aware of their iced coffee.  It's strongest thing you'll ever try, you might end up with some jitters and heart palpitations if you drink it on the empty stomach.  They also have great selection of pastry, which is gone by lunch time, but don't be sad they have healthy breakfast menu, great sandwiches, hot or cold, and last but not least great salads.  Place can get really busy on the sunny days in SF, and on the weekend.  The line ends up somewhere in the street, but don't be sad, waiting is totally worth it.  At night time you can stop for some music, glass of wine or beer, your choice.  Usually older crowd is relaxing during this time, some of them even dancing.

Coffee served up strong and fresh in a slightly bohemian, but very friendly environment.\n\nMy advice: Go to Java Beach, and order something...anything.

But then I go there and realize why it's not as perfect as my mythical vision of it.\n\nI openly recognize that my judgment of coffee shops/cafes is skewed by my devotion to my favorite (Naked Lounge in Chico, CA) and my ongoing quest to find an adequate replacement.  I simultaneously like that this is a bustling business but hate having to wait 10+ minutes for available indoor seating sometimes.  I like that it is cheery and full of conversation sometimes, but not when I come there with my laptop in hopes of busting out a few pages of a research paper.  I like that they serve beer but don't want any bar atmosphere there.  Obviously, these things are not their fault, but they do take away from the experience and make me not as jazzed to visit.\n\nLike others have said, I too have worked in food service for years so I know that the job can often suck big ones.  Most of their employees seem to be generally nice but super jaded, and talk in a I'm-being-cordial-but-I-really-don't-care-about-you way.  On my most recent visit, a few off-the-clock employees were there drinking and being loouuuuuud.\n\nI wish they had more options for small, cheap food items, although the hot veggie and cheese sandwich is a good deal at $5.50 and was quite substantial and yummy.

It's located just at Judah and the Great Highway, right near the muni.\n\nThe prices were pretty standard -- came out to about 22$ for the two of us for drinks and lunch. The coffee, on both our parts, was amazing. They serve up to four shots in your drink (should you be crazy enough to want that) and their iced coffee was strong and tasty, not watery like other places. They made a mistake by making my friend's mocha hot, but efficiently and graciously put it on us for us (it was MELTING today).\n\nThe Sandwiches, about 7.25$ if I remember correctly, were massive and delicious. I ordered the vegetarian (offered hot and cold..guess which I picked?) and it came with fresh tomato, onion, avocado, sprouts, and three cheese on dutch crunch. yummm.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, definitely an SF-locals-type hangout, with nice people all around. A little crowded but not noisy. My one gripe is that the bathrooms were a little dirty and they were out of handsoap (especially when you're going to eat a sandwich). \n\nBut seriously-- with all the great reviews, take a beach day!

Maybe I found it myself when I hopped the N-train without paying and took it to the end of the line or hoofed the 1.3 miles downhill to the great wide sea. \n\nSince then, though, I've gone back so many times alone or with friends and family, always to feast on one of the large (approximately foot long) hot subs, aburst with a pile of paper thin meats welded to juicy tomatoes and crispy shredded lettuce by the cheese of your choice (pepper jack is a wise choice), all pressed smartly between yielding but crunchy-fresh flour-dusted French roll bread (\"the works,\" sprouts, and avocado are a must). On the days that I was foolish enough to have eaten without anticipating a visit here, I settled for a Muddy Waters or a plain old Americano, cheerfully shoving aside shells of The Guardian and other partial newspapers to grab one of the couch seats or opting to feel the chill ocean breeze misting through every pore of my skin at one of the iron tables outside among bright-eyed starling birds and wolf-like dogs awaiting the return of their owners with thumping tails.\n\nHere, Norcal beach bums, regular bums, sporty people, West Coast yuppies (for they DO differ from East Coast yuppies), Ocean Beach surfers, students, and every walk of life above, below, and in between meld into one another. The inside and outside of this place are always full, but the staff keeps it moving without being nazis to customers. The average wait for a sandwich is about seven minutes, but it goes fast while calmly people watching or eavesdropping on the mellow and/or idealistic conversations happening quietly all around. A short visit to the home-like bathroom or an absentminded survey of the few beers on tap while leaning on the slightly sticky but not disgusting wooded bar counter by the serving station usually helps the time pass, and then the order is hot in your hot chubby little hands. The sandwich is unspeakably delicious when devoured instantly, but also stays hot during another short stolen ride (sorry, MUNI, but it's all a part of the experience, or my experience, anyway) back up the hill from the trusty N-train. \n\nI didn't write about Java Beach until now because it's so precious and so local that I figured that all the people who deserve to find it somehow will. But a recent revisit to the place got me to decide to stop pretending I can keep it all to myself when the whole vibe is open to all. My mom and I stopped there to kick off an impulse trip to a 10-mile hike at Point Reyes. I ordered a large hot salami sub with all the aforementioned fixins and took a chance on a medium tuna melt without mayo. Knowing Mom was craving breakfast, I threw a mushroom, spinach, and feta croissant pocket in there (toasted, of course). Feeling extra cheeky, I did the unthinkable and ordered a SWEET coffee drink; a small White Mocha with a dollop of whipped cream to boot. The total? $21.95. Trust me, this is cheap. \n\nThe coffee was creamy and sweet, but didn't make me feel like purging after the third sip. It stayed regular throughout. The stuffed croissant was maddeningly tasty and barely lasted until we hit the 101 North. The sandwiches stayed fresh until we reached the very tippity tip and the midpoint of our hike (but obviously lost their heat after a 2 hour drive and a five mile walk over the sea cliffs).\n\nThe sub was too salty for my mother's taste, so she politely put it down and snarfed down the melt with chunks of real fish poking through the a bubbly blanket of cheddar. I had a half of both sandwiches, and my sister enjoyed the other half of the sub, after we were long gone back to snow-covered Boston.\n\nI consider Java Beach a local place no matter where the winds take me. When I walk in, the same fresh faced young girls and rugged young men with free attitudes only found in the Bay Area will greet me with apt and sunny regard, representing again and again the \"sun\" in Outer Sunset.

Warm weather in February.\n\nWhat to do?  Why, go to the beach and drink a pitcher of beer, of course.  And then text all our friends in - ahem, COLDER CLIMATES - to taunt them mercilessly.\n\nJava Beach is one of my favorite places to take friends, out-of-towners, and the occasional date - if they don't like the laid-back atmosphere and delicious food, they're probably not going to be happy with anything else I can offer.\n\nI especially love the pesto/mozzarella/tomato sandwich, although the basil has a habit of getting stuck in your teeth (note how I blamed the basil, and not myself - mark of a future lawyer).  The coffee is good.  They have good beer on tap, served by the glass or by the pitcher - and come on, why would you want to stop at just one glass?\n\nPrices are fine - not cheap enough to make it an every day treat, but I believe most sandwiches are $5-8.

They're really harmless.\n\nAfter moving from San Jose almost a decade ago, this place was my home and taught me a few survival skills about living in San Francisco. I come from the part of San Jose (my family home) where I was taught to say please, thank you, and excuse me if you unintentionally bump into someone. I am thankful to Java Beach for wiping all that nonsense out of my system and skilling me in rude street maneuvers. \n\nFor example, if I bump someone in passing and it's obviously my mistake, I can give you that WTF? STARE like it's your fault. You will say sorry without hesitation. Cool skill, right? I learned that at Java Beach almost a decade ago!\n\nSo, if you need to touch up on your rudeness and your tummy is rumbling for a delicious sandwich. Yes, delicious sandwich, then this is your place. \n\nThe warm sandwiches are the best! (sm. $4.25 med. $5.95 large $6.65) \nThe bread is absolutely scrumptious. It has that perfected crunch sound when your teeth hits the surface and then sinks into soft delicious goodness. Oh, yeaaahh...that's what I'm talking about. CRUNCH! The ingredients are locally grown and mostly organic\n\nSalads ($5.75-$7.75) - Generous portions of healthy goodness.\n\nPastries ($1-$3) - Huge soft and flakey pastries.\n\nCoffee - Good enough. All Fair Trade.\n\nBEER ON TAP!\n\nOverall: Great eclectic atmosphere, exquisite bread for delicious sandwiches or not, outdoor seating (dogs invited outdoor), and enough sass to either keep you away or finding your way back for a sandwich.

We all need change; change from the monotony of work as well as change from the monotony of monogamy/partners etc. Since our mind seeks \"perpetual novelty\",   breaking the limiting patterns of \"same old;same old\" always brings joy to our heart.\n\nOne of the few places in SF where I feel really acts as a \"change\" to my dense urban living is when I ride the 38 to the very end, walk the half mile down Ocean Beach to Java Beach Caf, order a strong coffee and snuggle into the sofa. The environment of surfer dudes and aging hippies transports my mind to Lahaina Beach and the smell of the sea breeze is making my vacation in Maui memorable.\n\nI sip a Stella from the tap and fall into a stupor. Around me, people bask in the lazy glow of sunshine eating sandwiches and drinking coffee while others are being playful with their work courtesy the free wifi. \n\nThe sound of the Pacific Ocean reminds me of the infinite potential of the human spirit.

The singletons with their lap tops who paid for a coffee 2-3 hours ago, who are still sitting there taking up an entire table or half the couch, when there is seriously limited seating.  Apparently the Java beach staff sees no need for paying customers, those who just paid 20 bucks for a couple sandwiches and drinks, to have any sort of seating.  They are content to have the free-loading wireless users take up all the space.\n\nSometimes the line is ridiculously long too.  My recommendation is to call ahead, order your sandwich, then by the time you are to the front of the line it will be ready and you can take it to go.

It looks like they had live music earlier as one the guys at the table was cleaning up his equipment.\n\nThey annoyed that the cafe was closing in 7 minutes, but most of us stayed put for a little while.  The cool girl with the glasses started to pick up empty glasses so I took that as the cue that we should head out.  It was after 11pm when we left so it was cool they didn't say \"we're closed now\" when it hit 11pm.

Coffee and bagels for two is usually about 15 bucks (which I find ridiculous).

It is an uber-busy shop these days, and the coffee is not my favorite, but it does do the trick and gets my day started in a place that I love. They also have wicked sub sandwiches that are huge and dripping with sauce. If you like hanging out by the beach in a low-key place (surfers, hippies, yuppies, firemen, skaters, FBI agents--everyone comes here), this is the place for you. It's also a bit of en enclave for skaters. I've seen the Sector 9 crew hanging here. \n\nThe block it is on is probably one of my favorite places in all of SF (don't tell anyone, they'll come out here and ruin it). Don't expect the waitstaff to be impressed with what you're ordering or with you. This is not that kind of place.

Something about the mayo, perhaps?\n\nI used to grade exams here: pound down cups of coffee until happy hour, then pound down pints of Stella as the stack of graded bluebooks grew higher than the stack of ungraded ones.

On sunny days it's impossible to find a place to sit. Fairly yuppie-free, thank goodness. Lots of folks with leathery tans though.

I get my usual soy hazelnut latte, and i've had their ice tea which isn't bad as well. \n\nFood: Well I've only ordered a sandwich before...but it wasn't too bad. Their hot sandwiches are good :) \n\nEnvironment: cute little cafe. It gets pretty crowded on the weekends, and i've had to wait in a line before...but the wait isn't that bad. Small, so if you want a seat, keep your eye out. I always like sitting outside in the little patio. Just bundle up if its a chilly day! Also right in front of the N Judah turn around...in case you are wondering about transportation.\n\nService: I have no complaints with the service.

The customers have been pleasant as well, and always run into someone who makes small talk. \n\n:) See ya on my next run!", "author": "Catherine O."}

The vibe is definitely hipsters and casual city follks but it was a very diverse crowd and I felt quite comfortable.  It is a bit warm inside so prepare to take off layers if it is chilly outside but the internet cafe portion gets crowded so sitting outside is always an option.  Right near the beach and not too heavily travelled street you can feel rather cozy just hanging out in front.  So we ordered a lemonade each and a roast beef sandwich and got a nice little spot on the sidewalk out front.  Dog friendly and bikes parked in various spots, there were definitely younger folks loitering with intent but again, it was a comfortable spot no one seemed to notice the other.  The lemonade was crisp and refreshing and perfect to sip while listening to the waves on the beach.  The sandwiches do take a bit of time to prepare but they tell you the window of time that you will wait when you order, in my case 15 minutes.  Now if you are starving, that might seem like an eternity.  However, the sandwich is so worth the wait, probably the best deli sandwich I have had in years.  The bread was fresh, as was the roast beef, it was so delicious I wish I lived closer to SF to visit more often.  Again, not perfect with the inside temperature and the wait time but if you are in the right frame of mind, it is truly a fun little spot to stop and hang out.

Everyone always makes sure you order what you really want and works really, really fast to make it for you. The cashier will always greet you with a smile.

To clarify, the employees have been great every time I've been to Java Beach, and maybe it just isn't a condusive place for me to study because of the busyness of the place. In subsequent visits, the coffee has been good, and the atmosphere/crowds have been fine. It's a great place to stop for a cup of coffee after a walk (which I've been doing regularly). Also, I happened to talk to the owner, and she mentioned that the BLT is a work in progress, which makes me feel reassured about Java Beach's goals as a business. 4 stars because of subsequent pleasant visits.

It is pretty much the only option for coffee and food for several blocks. A new pack of customers shows up every 7-15 minutes as the N opens its doors almost directly into the shop. There's free Internet but you may not be able to find a seat to use it.\n\nThe coffee drinks are unremarkable but okay. The *sandwiches*, though, are yummy. I don't know where they get their bread but it's absolutely awesome, especially after it is warmed in the oven. Seriously, it is the BEST SANDWICH BREAD in town if you like it warm and crusty. You can smell it half a block down the street. I'm getting hungry just writing about it. But the flip side is that the staff is pathologically unable to get sandwich orders right. They ask you what you don't want rather than what you do; this seems to confuse them just as much as it does customers. Still, once you have your tuna melt with the right stuff on it, it's awesome.\n\nI don't have any problems recommending Java Beach.

I have waited as long as 20 minutes to order a cup of coffee. Usually the wait is 15 minutes. And it's not like they pour it for you or brew it on the spot. They hand you a cup and you go to a thermos and get it yourself. Seriously how hard can it be to take my money and hand me a cup? Why do I have to wait 15-20 minutes to be handed a cup? In a line of only 5 people? \n\nIt's unbelievable how inefficient and slow they are. I've been there dozens of times and it's always the same.

I tried it several times, but the door just jiggled and wouldn't open completely.  I had the feeling someone was doing a Pursuit of Happyness and camping out there because no one was coming out.  I made a quick jaunt to the divey Thai restaurant across the street, disregarding their no public restrooms sign.  After all, it was New Year's Day, a holiday, and wouldn't they waive this requirement just this once since I was in dire need and nice about it?  I tried the door of their bathroom, but of course, it was locked.  I asked the waitress for the key, she simply smiled apologetically and said I would gain no access to the restroom.  I said even if it's an emergency? She nodded her head still no.  I remembered the Java Beach Cafe two blocks down.  It was packed inside, with a line of folks out the door.

Place is cool.  All the way out by Ocean Beach.  A line starts forming out the door from time to time.  Coffee was decent, but nothing to go bananas over.  Sandwich had the fixings: pickles, peppers, onions and more.  I wouldn't say that this place was amazing honestly.  I think I've had better service at a Starbucks than here.  Perhaps its because this place is more laid back, so everything seems a little slower over here.  Or perhaps its one of the only cafes near by, along a scenic route, that we're actually paying for the view and not the quality/service.  Hmm (think Beach Chalot).  Finally, if you use the restroom and think, where is the lock.  Um, I can't pee if there isn't a lock.  Look up the door higher. Some genius whose over 6 feet probably put that sucker in.

But honestly, this place is so-so (if that). \n\nFor starters, there was always a huge line whenever I even attempted to order something there. Secondly, there is never a place to sit. I do understand that if you are looking for wireless internet, there aren't many choices in Outer Sunset, but come on... Just trying to sit down and enjoy a hot chocolate with my two year old was impossible... And I'm sure many of us know how difficult it can be to handle a cranky, hungry two year old. Next, when I finally got to start drinking my hot chocolate, it was only half full (the cup was 12 oz.), and I did NOT indicate that I wanted a kid's hot chocolate. For that, I feel the drink was waayy overpriced. Lastly, service takes forever, and the people behind the counter seem to be on another planet. I work in a coffee shop myself, so I know how hard it can be to deal with a line, but hey... If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. It took an hour to get two sandwhiches!\n\nAnyway, it's not the worst place I've been, after working at Starbucks for eleven months. When you need wireless and you're thirsty and a patient person as well, this is the place for you. Plus it is RIGHT next to the beach, literally a few steps away...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-29", "description": "I love this place.  I've lived right around the corner for the past 2 years and there are so many reasons this place rules.\n\nReason #1: The location.  It doesn't get much better than this in San Francisco.  One block from the beach, with a clear walkway across the Great Highway and a wide stretch between the dunes to make your way down to the surf.  The N line turns around here, there's a beatiful community garden with benches across the way, and there's ample outdoor seating, so there's always interesting people watching and conversation to be had.\n\nReason #2: Chill vibe.  My favorite time to come here is a Sunday morning.  There's always a line out the door but the service is fast and the people in line are friendly.  You've got the newspaper man standing outside selling the Chronicle - he seems to feel like he's struck gold getting paid to be outside talking to people and once said to me \"I can't believe they pay me to do this.\"  The vibe is always laid back.\n\nReason #3: The food and beverages.  For such a tiny place they sure pack a lot in.  They've got a bar, full menu of hot and cold sandwiches, and great coffee.  The sandwiches are amazing and a small is enough food for a meal.  I love that I can get a pint or a pitcher and sit outside with friends on the sidewalk for hours.  \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is the layout inside.  After paying, you are immediately faced with trying to fill up your coffee with no place to rest it, while people are sitting right behind you and others are trying to squeeze by.  Most people wait for their food and coffee right there as well, right on top of people that are trying to sit and enjoy their meal.  The bathroom line also forms in this small space as well.  Then, to make it back outside you have to worm your way back through the crowd, trying to to spill your coffee or dump your food on someone's head.  Add a few rowdy kids in the mix and you've got insanity.  I wish they'd redo the layout because they could take way better advantage of the space.", "author": "Mr. A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-08", "description": "Java Beach is a great little cafe. It's pretty much the only one in the neighborhood unless you count Trouble Coffee, which makes good drinks but is little more than a stand -there's not much seating inside. Java Beach, on the other hand, has plenty of seating, but it's so popular you might find it hard to find a seat. When I lived in the Sunset, I would come here several times a week to have a cup of joe and a sandwich while I got some reading done. Very good location for that kind of activity, free wifi and all. The seating is a little uncomfortable-the couches, while clean, are old and saggy, and the large coffee table between the couches is often awkwardly placed, making it difficult to use, especially with food. For that reason I would usually sit at one of the tables (the chairs are of the restaurant-standard, non-padded kind) or better yet, the bar, with its padded high-chairs and ample counter space. That's where the condiment basket is kept, as well as the free water pitcher. The coffee is above average, and my favorite is the Columbian roast. I usually drink my coffee with milk and sugar, but the Colombian is so good I take it black to get the fullness of the flavor. It's strong without being overpowering, and doesn't have a hint of harshness about it. They even sell their beans so you can have it at home, but I don't know how that turns out because I never make coffee at home. So yes, the coffee is very good, a bit more expensive than at other cafe's in the city, but you have the option of drinking it from a mug if you're having it there, which is something I think more cafes should offer.\n The coffee is good, but the sandwiches...oh the sandwiches! Some of the best in the city. They are massive and not as expensive as you'd think. The biggest, fanciest sandwich they have- the Tsunmai, a great Italian sub with ham, mortadella and salami, served on a ten-inch Dutch crunch only costs eight dollars! I'm a big guy and I can almost never finish one in a single sitting. The BBQ chicken is another great option, different from most other sandwiches you've probably had. Order it with cheddar.\n Java Beach is one of the best lunch options in the neighborhood, plus their hours are LOOOONG. They open at 5:30 am and don't close until 11pm, so you don't need to worry about feeling guilty for coming in late. The service is good too, sometimes a little curt when they're very busy, but when it's slow they smile at you and compliment your outfit. Their kitchen staff is speedy-even at busy times I've rarely had to wait longer than 15 minuets for my sandwich, and at down times they'll bring it straight to your table.\n Location wise the place has some nice surrounding scenery. It's right next to the beach, and there's a little garden plot on a traffic island nearby. It is at the end of Judah, and the N-trains have their roundabout there, so it can get rather noisy. In the mornings you'll see Muni drivers come in for coffee. One of my favorite experiences here was coming in at 6am in winter, when the sun wasn't up yet. I bought a cup and went out to the beach, watching the full moon over the ocean. It was beautiful.\n Java Beach: Great food, good coffee, good service, good location, good enough seating. Overall this place is pretty bomb and highly recommended, especially given that they don't have any competition in the area-they could've just banked on that and not tried to go for quality. The fact that they try hard when they don't have to gives them extra marks in my book. However, there is one VERY MAJOR FLAW with Java Beach that keeps it from getting five stars from me-no discounts on refills. None. You pay full price for every cup of coffee, even if you're using a mug. There is simply no excuse for this. Every other cafe I've been to gives you a discount on refills. The fact that Java beach charges full price for every cup is just greedy. If they get rid of this absurd practice I'll change my review, but as it stands, this unabashed gouging of customers is inexcusable.", "author": "Eli H."}

A girl by the scene of the crime more patiently described to them what had occurred. Still not having it. The staff kept asking each other what happened as they maneuvered around the broken ceramic pieces. The girl gave a second attempt, bless her soul, and described the old man that had bumped it , who then quietly made an exit, as though he was guilty of some crime.

Sometimes the latter bring their tank strollers and have their kids screaming and running all over the place; however, it is not the worst I have seen.  \n\nI generally get their drip coffee - Hazelnut is the best, I think.  I don't care for their espresso-based drinks because they do not know how to make them properly.  Go to North Beach for good espresso.  However, their coffee is labeled as organic AND fair trade, which is a big plus in my book and is one of the reason, in addition to decent speed free Wi-FI, that I keep going there.\n\nThe employees are generally decent, especially Cara (superb personality) and Justin (easy-going, cool, guy)  (these two are the best in my book and should be the first people customers come in contact with), this Latina-looking short woman (real cute looks and personality), and this other woman who is in her 30s who always thanks people for coming (very good touch).  I don't care for the two heavy-set white chicks who work there.  They don't project a friendly attitude and seem to be moody.  They should be in the back in my opinion.\n\nThe food is generally good.  The consistency of the service and the food and beverage portions is quite spotty.

A college buddy of mine showed me this place and we started hanging out here with other friends. Nothing beats a java spot by the beach. I've been hanging out here at the start of the coffee culture in SF, and before all the other java places started popping up in the city, especially the commercial chain ones (you know which ones I mean). The crowd was hip and the place looks colorful and cozy. I haven't been here for a while (pre-wifi days) so I don't know how it looks like now, hopefully still the same. But I do remember even winning a movie pass because one radio station was parked outside the coffee house. Anyway, this place brings back a lot of good memories.", "author": "Cindy S."}

There is no reason to go here unless you live nearby and cant find anything else. \n\nThe layout of the shop is horrid. Even a short line ends up out the door and into the street. You cant read the menu without clogging the line hole and even after you have ordered there is hardly anywhere to stand to wait for your food. Most people (coffee or not) stand blocking the milk / sugar/stirring device/only trashcan area. So whether you are just trying to order you coffee, spice your coffee, wait for your food, eat your food, throw away trash (didnt see any recycling either) you are always in someones way. There is a dirty dish bus try blocking access to the bathroom and if you need water be ready for an adventure. First you have to scoot past the people sitting at the bar and the ones waiting for their food AND the ones waiting for the bathroom AND the ones using the bar counter for their WIFI. Finally you reach the water dispenser and have to reach over some guys new macbook to fill your tiny water cup and then hope to jeebus you dont get bumped or get shaky before you clear the airspace over his machine.

Frankly, it's a kind of a dump and thrives mainly due to the lack of any competition nearby and the fact that the N-Judah stops right outside the door. If this place were in North Beach it would have gone out of business a long time ago. Pricing is also pretty aggressive in relation to the quality and quantity of what you get. Again, a little competition would probably change that. On top of everything else, it's THE slowest place I've ever been for coffee drinks.", "author": "john m."}

On my recent travels to this establishment, I was told to try out the hot chocolate because it is a must, apparently they were telling the truth. After deciding to test out the wonderful liquid, I was amazed on how chocolately dense and thick it was. I called it, \"A hot milk shake\". The lady at the front counter was very nice and held a more than 15 second conversation which was nice and refreshing because I am used to so many people trying to act like an assembly line and not human. What I liked about the place was that it was a mecca for different social groups and with nice indoor seating and lighted outdoor patio, with free wi-fi, it was quite dreamy. Despite it's out of the city location, I found it to be indeed another local gem. This brought me to question... how many gems are there located in this city?

I've been a regular here since they opened nearly 20 years ago.  It used to be a VERY quiet, locals only, Richmond neighbors only place, and maybe a few surfers, and stray walkers stopping in.  SF needs places like that desperately, places to be authentic and quiet without hype and crowds, but they are so hard to maintain once word spreads.  They've spruced it up inside over the years and word spread so now it's crowded all the time -- you get the 30 something crowds and the 20 something crowds (the folks who pit stop in SF for a year or two or three and then leave kind of crowds,), every weekend who have turned it into a lounge for themselves. It used to be a true authentic neighborhood place, quiet and real.  Now it's an I'm so cool I have my i-phone, my hybrid, my purposely messed up hair and slouchy clothes, and trying too hard to look \"city but not too obviously\" place.

I moved to 47th temporarily while concluding a long marriage, and stayed on an extra year to get my feet back under me. Java was my daily stop--either for morning coffee/papers, or at the end of the workday after stepping off the N-Judah when I just wanted a hearty cup of soup for dinner. Sometimes I'd have my kids and their friends in tow when they were home from college. Java is a great place if you find a groove there. Weekends and any lunch time can be frantic, so you need to be prepared to WAIT for food or coffee orders quite a bit, and seating can be competitive.  But there is overflow seating in the little park across the street or take your coffee and Chron down to the beach. People watching is entertaining--mix of locals, the Irish connection, surfers, sometimes assertive auto & bus-dwellers, weekend cyclists, and the omnipresent computer gazers who squat for hours over one cup of coffee. The Bernie's Blend coffee is my favorite, they make a good unsweetened chai latte, huge, fresh salads, sandwiches or just bagels. Yummy brownies too.  Counter staff are friendly,especially to the regulars---and there are a bunch of locals who show up frequently. They have music on weekends evenings, which can be really good.", "author": "Julie A."}

Hopefully, it will reduce the crowd at the La Playa location. Java Beach offers outdoor seating and so you can bring your dog along. The best times to go to Java Beach are early evening/nights when the day was hot (for the Sunset . . . 70 degrees). Otherwise, it's great to check out Java Beach during the night time. There's always a crowd and it's a very welcoming hang out.
