When I like to indulge on my cheat days (Just kidding, everyday is a cheat day for me because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day) I go to Columbus and order myself a croissant sandwich and an ice cold chai latte. Who am I kidding, I go here on my lazy mornings because I dread doing dishes from making breakfast because when I make breakfast, I go hard. I should open up a brunch spot for aggressive brunchers cause I make a mean breakfast!\n\nWhen I first had their chai latte, I was immediately impressed. I had it in house and it was beautifully frothy, creamy, and super decadent for chai. They probably used whole milk the first time which it probably why I was so enamored. \n\nThe second time I ordered chai to go and literally the barrista poured milk into a cup and then some pre-made shelf stable chai mix that you can get from the grocery store. Charging patrons $4 for this seems excessive in my opinion because it's little to zero effort or artistry.\n\nFreaking Lombard and it's tourist prices!", "author": "Connie M."}

Just four or five blocks over toward downtown there are dozens of bars and restaurants buzzing with action.  But not near 901. \n\nSo, 901 is the best of not much. Imagine a bar that crashed into a market / deli and then got halfway through a remodel to make it a coffee shop before stopping in full mash up mode. It's like a pocket knife with tools for a range of purposes but not one done really super well. \n\nThey have 2-3 tables in front where you can sit in warm weather, but even that is pretty underwhelming. \n\nFine in a pinch, but pinch yourself to search a little wider and you'll do better.", "author": "Lanny B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-20", "description": "901 Columbus Cafe, I don't know if it's  considered a best kept secret around here or not but it's definitely a saving grace for the hungry and thirsty person doing a walking tour around San Francisco. Why? Okay, I'll elaborate.\n\nFrom the outside this place really doesn't look much different than your typical, space-restricted SF cafe except for one thing; a sign that says it has $2 pints everyday.  That's right, $2 pints of beer on draft.  For a place in SF it would probably be acceptable even if it was $2 for some domestic trash beer, but it isn't.   It was like a tractor beam that pulled me in.  \n\nThe $2 beers (at the time) were a choice of  SF's own, Speakeasy Brewing's Big Daddy IPA, Prohibition Ale and Tallulah Extra Pale Ale.  Sure, they might not get an average rating of 4 or higher on BeerAdvocate but at $2 for a pint of craft beer...in SF...on a Saturday, are your really going to argue? I didn't think so.\n\nSo aside from the $2 beers and some pretty cheap bottled offerings, they also make sandwiches, pastries, coffee and other breakfast options here for affordable prices to really round out their function as a cafe.  However, based upon what you've read already, you know what I was here for.  I had to grab a cold one before trekking up to the top of Lombard Street.\n\nThere's still ample seating bot inside and out despite the size of the cafe, which in reality, is pretty decent in size. It isn't the most modern, upscale cafe you'll probably visit in the SF area but the fact of the matter is that it serves it purpose quite well.  Beer, food, wifi, you really can't go wrong here.\n\nIf I found myself walking around SF on any given day and I wanted to grab a few cold beers without breaking the bank, this place can easily be my regular spot.  Easily.", "author": "Jeff S."}

So awesome, a cafe I can take my coffee hating, beer loving BF.  Nice wooden tables, plenty of outlets, and shelves of books you can borrow to read.  Red walls, art on the walls, huge windows, some open air.  Free wifi, twinkly lights, and decent service.  This place is the beatnik living room you want to spend a few hours in, a living room away from your living room.  \n\nRandom, they also have a printer, so you can print things.\n\nThey just turned the game on and it's loud, and no more cool ambient musica to help me write my heart out, so I'm taking off now.

So, I asked again and his response was that he did not know (and by his look it was clear that he did not know what I was talking about and did not care).  He then asked which one I wanted.  It was clear that he was not going to pay any attention to any ingredients and would be quite happy to serve items which poison me, so I left.\n\nI'm amazed that places like this are allowed to remain open in a place like SF.

Of course, they had a nice selection of coffee drinks, teas, sandwiches, pastries, and all of the other goodies you'd come to expect from a neighborhood coffee joint like this one.

I'll try, though. (I'm plucky like that.) They were SO delicious, I was humming to myself as I ate, and that's something I used to do as a kid, but only when I was really happy. The Babylonia is avocado, cucumber, red onion, sprouts, hummus, lettuce, tomato, pickles and cheese, and I had mine on toasted wheat bread. (Check out the photo, which makes me weep with nostalgia.) The smoothie rocked 'til the break-a dawn.\n \nMaybe I loved it so much because I'd just arrived in San Francisco, and was starving, and probably would've been ecstatic to munch on some Wheat Thins. Still, I'd rate the meal highly under any circumstances. Additional temptations on the menu included the Grilled Foccacia \"Wise Guy\" Sandwich (pesto, chicken, mozzarella, tomato and onion) and the Pastrami Melt.\n \nOther plusses: friendly service, cozy seating, free WiFi, cute location (with an outdoor view of Lombard 's \"crookedest street\" in the distance), and what appeared to be a tiny lending library.", "author": "Robert M."}

The wine was also served in a lowball styled glass which was fine by me - a bit ghetto, but A-OK.  \n\nBetween our party, we ordered wine, beer, soup, a panini and possibly a sandwich (sorry, memory is hazy).

Basically the white-meat version of particle-board? I'm pretty sure this was the same product.

I've been a lunchtime devotee since April, and it's by far my favorite cafe.  While it gets its fair share of tourists, no one can deny its close-knit neighborhood feel.  A real breath of fresh air from those tourist traps down the street!\n\nMy ideal solo lunch break includes a good book, a seat at the high counter along the far wall, and one of 901's incredible sandwiches or salads (or maybe some waffles one of these days).  The dining area is so cozy, and the music is great too.\n\nTheir salads and sandwiches are really, REALLY good.  Some personal faves that you need to try: 1) SUNSET BOULEVARD SALAD: baby spinach, cucumber, watermelon, feta cheese w/ raspberry vinaigrette...they used to have mint leaves & pine nuts but took them out!  If at all possible, please please please bring 'em back. 2) ANGEL ISLAND SALAD: baby spinach, pineapple, feta cheese, w/ dijon dressing...again, took out the pine nuts but still a good bet. 3) SEACLIFF SALAD: romaine, red onion, toasted pecans, sprouts, tuna salad, parmesan, w/ olive oil, balsamic vinegar & lemon...was a staple for me while on the South Beach diet. 4) DIMAGGIO WRAP: hummus, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, falafel, yogurt dressing, and hot sauce...in a panini-pressed wrap.  I love this thing, it's incredible.\n\nThe only thing that occasionally irks me is the service: it's soo o o o SLO OOO O W.  I've watched potential customers walk out because no one's at the counter to take their orders, and a couple of times the staff straight up forgot to place orders.  I try not to let it get to me and I wouldn't have a problem with it, but my lunch break is only an hour long.  I still recommend this place to co-workers and friends, and I still support this cafe because it's simply a great place with a cool vibe.

There's the deliciously healthy wraps and sandwiches (Sinatra for veggie-lovers, or the WiseGuy for the carnivores). The salads are just as scrumptious, the soups are delicious. The waffles are heavenly (with bananas and pecans...or OR strawberries and nutella...oh dear).  \n\nThen there are the beverage offerings! A perfect cafe must have excellent coffee and espresso which is exactly what you will find here. My first drink here was a zebra mocha which is a cafe favorite but lately, just having the solo espresso is satisfying as it is wonderfully rich and aromatic. Oh, and then, here's the best part...ahem... $2 drafts/$3 wines from 5pm?!? Seriously, you can't find a deal like that in any kind of cool neighborhood. Not only that, but the draft pale ale and house red wine is really really nice. \n\nThe perfect cafe must also have the perfect ambience. This spot is cozy, comfortable, and unpretentious with nice music and lighting and even outdoor seating if that's your thing.  To complete the package, there's free wifi, computers and a printer if you don't have your own, an array of books and board games, and ultra-friendly staff to serve you. You can even zone out and watch the tube. And if you don't want to do any of that, the location is great for people-watching. Grab a seat outside and watch tourists, locals, and cable cars pass you by.\nI've been to plenty of cafes in my time and this has remained my favorite the last couple years.

They definitely helped resolved our hungry bellies and my thirst for caffeine. \n\nI have yet to go there for happy hour but I can only imagine it's a chill spot to have a couple of beers and chat with friends. \n\nGood stuff.

Can you believe it... $1.50?!?!  Happy Hour is 5pm - 10pm, any day which means WEEKENDS, too!\n\nIt's not a bar, obviously, it's a cafe.  Actually, it's called 901 Columbus Caffe (two \"ff\"s), not to be confused with one of my favorite bars in North Beach, Columbus Cafe.  Food including soup, salad, and sandwiches; and drinks like caffeinated drinks and $1.50 draft beers!  There's also some really good looking desserts like home-made tiramisu, various cheesecakes, biscotti, and other sweet treats!  Big, flat screen television showing sports and lots of board games to play with -- my boyfriend, Ian and I played a great game of Scrabble the last time we were here.  It was so much fun.  \n\nGreat casual atmosphere, lots of people on their laptops taking advantage of the free wi-fi.  Outside seating also available during those hot San Francisco nights -- great for people watching (tourist and locals walking by or on the cable car, and looking at the Bikram students keepin' it hot doing yoga across the street).  \n\nWill keep comin' back for more... more beer, off course.  Now for the catch... there's only 3 beers on-tap, only one the last time we were there, but it was still worth it because I cannot think of a better way to spend my $1.50 :-)!", "author": "Celeste M."}

I will try new places as the urge strikes me, but if I need somewhere to be for a while this is a good choice. Open wireless and available outlets mean I can take my laptop and relax.

For breakfast I usually get the yogurt granola parfait, a waffle, or a bagel sandwich. All hit the spot. Prepare to wait a while for your breakfast/lunch on the weekends since they get pretty busy and don't have much help in the kitchen area. There is a good seating area with free wifi inside, and also seating outside for warm days.", "author": "Laura W."}

Can't really comment on the food as I hardly eat there. But the interiors and the outdoor area could use some serious updating and beautification (please, please, please).  I would love to buy the coffee from then and then go and sit at one of their neighbors outdoor table at Caffe Sapore (don't care for their coffee).  I am glad they finally put some planters out there.  It's a first step. Thank you! The staff/service is so-so unless the owner serves you.  He is super nice and friendly and always smiles.", "author": "Manuela P."}

I also had minestrone soup, which tasted fine, and italian soda.  Unfortunately the selection of syrup flavors for the soda is a bit small, but that just pushed me to be more adventurous and try something outside my usual strawberry-kiwi order.  Service is great; the waiter keeps an ironic playfulness about himself.  He was also more than happy to give my partner tips on how to drink her italian soda, as it was her first time.  The TV was playing The Never-Ending Story with captions.", "author": "Tim M."}

It even has an owner / proprietor like Sam.... that would be Tarek.... or \"T\" for short.  He and his mother run the place and they are both wonderful people. The food is honest and fresh. The beer is CHEAP... but a great local brew. The coffee is superb and I believe custom crafted for 901 Columbus. My only complaint is that I can't spend my entire day here. I also think Tarek should open another business that has a full bar and kitchen. I can't wait to see what he could do with that!", "author": "Andrew C."}

The atmosphere is great for just kicking back or getting some work done. It kind of feels like a cafe fused with a bar. There's free wi-fi and $1.50 draft beers from 5-10pm everyday. With both outside and indoor seating, you can really make this place work for any situation. Service is friendly, although you can expect to wait 5-10 minutes for your sandwich. But boy, is it worth the wait. Paninis, wraps, whatever you choose - they're all wonderfully delicious. Plenty of vegetarian options, too.", "author": "Willy C."}

Columbus Cafe is near my home, so I thought that would be a great place to start.  Internet is free, coffee is good, and it's a great spot for people watching. You can choose to sit outside or you can cozy up in a chair or couch on the inside.  I only had the fruit and coffee, but there was a wide array of menu items to choose from. I would definitely recommend this spot if you want a quick bite to eat or want to curl up with a good book.", "author": "Shawna H."}
