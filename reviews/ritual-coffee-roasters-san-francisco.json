For some reason, it is really really hard to find ANY open coffee shop in 90% of the city after 530p. Yet another sign that SF is not really ready to be considered a primetime major city worth it's rep...but I digress. \n\nThis all makes Ritual really stand out to me. First it's open until 8 everyday(!!). Second, the coffee is good. Really good. This is the perfect place to buy a distinctly SF gift for your F&F. I would say the coffee is usually more tasty and not as brutally strong as sightglass, and more refined than Philz. Service is friendly and quick. In true SF fashion, you can encounter long lines on weekend mornings but otherwise it's usually very reasonable. You can also expect a very reasonable selection of pastries and on a sunny day there is cool outdoor seating. Indoor seating is  plentiful and offers numerous work spaces. Like all cafes in SF, using the bathroom can be adventurous bc of the homeless problem but it is available. \n\nCaveats? I have no idea how WiFi works here bc I don't trust/do public WiFi (use at your own risk). Paying $5 for coffee is also frankly not sustainable for most folks. Refills? \n\nOverall: highly recommended (but please don't crowd me out on Sunday morning ok?)", "author": "Andrew C."}

Was going to opt for a tea, but then I saw the Nibbler and figured I'd try that because of the Dandelion Chocolate incorporated.\n\nIf you're a chocolate person, I'd *highly* recommend the Nibbler while it's being offered! The coffee was super smooth and not bitter at all. You can definitely taste the chocolate, but it's not overly sweet. My one complaint is that I wish my cup was bigger and/or it contained less ice and more of the drink!\n\nEven a few days later, I'm still thinking about the Nibbler and how good it was.\n\nRitual has a rewards program in the form of a physical stamp. They don't automatically give you one (at least in my experience), so definitely ask for it if you think you'll be a regular or even periodically frequent the shop.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-19", "description": "San Francisco has a LOT of great coffee, and there are quite a few places in the city where you can get an amazing cup of joe. However, if you find yourself in the Mission and are craving a coffee, Ritual should be your first choice. Here's what's so awesome about it:\n\n1) The coffee! Both their pour-over (V60) coffee and espresso are great. They have multiple options for either, meaning you can choose exactly the flavor profile you want. They roast all their own beans, and while you can find them at many different stores around town, the best selection and freshest roasts are all here. They also offer a few teas.\n\n2) The food! They offer both regular and vegan pastries, meaning people with a dairy allergy can also grab a pastry to go with their coffee. Their vegan donuts are particularly good!\n\n3) The service! As I said above, there is a lot of good coffee in SF, but (unfortunately) there are also quite a few snobby/pretentious baristas too. Luckily, you won't find any of them here, as every Ritual barista I've had has been super friendly and approachable about any and all questions I've had, no matter how \"basic\" they have been. This is super refreshing!\n\n4) The space! A wonderful setting with lots of seating and even a cute back patio that offers a bit of quiet in a very loud city. \n\nAll in all, Ritual is one of my favorite places to go for coffee in San Francisco, and my top choice in the Mission.

I love how this place offers both inside and outside sitting, which is nice and dog friendly.\n\nNow for my drink, it was a very delicious iced mocha. However there was nothing that made it extra special compared to other coffee shops. It was good but so pricey for a cup of coffee.

Somehow Ritual is situated in trendy Mission but brews an excellent cuppa and has a nice, mixed bag of customers.\n\nThe coffee itself is great and the ambiance is open, airy and relaxed.  Seating on a weekend is tough to come by unless you're flying solo and don't need a camping spot, but always plenty of standing bar space along the wall.\n\nLine moves quick compared to a couple other coffee spots in the area, so if you've only got 10m and need some caffeine, just avoid the pour over and you'll be fine.", "author": "Nathan B."}

The coffee is as good as it's always been. While there's no wi-fi and few (if any) power outlets, there are still just as many, if not more, laptop loiterers as before.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-16", "description": "Considering that \"Ritual Coffee Roasters\" ranks as one of the top five Bay Area-based coffee shops, there's no wonder why this location has a very high amount of Yelp reviews. Reason being is that this was their very first location that opened its doors back in 2005. Since then, they now have a total of 6 coffee shops; 5 in San Francisco and 1 in Napa. \n\nLocated in the heart of the Mission District directly on Valencia St. (in between 21st and 22nd St's), many people who have never been here before may not even realize the business is here. Their trademark is a red flag resembling a star and an outline of what looks like a coffee cup. My lady and I arrived roughly around 10:30am on a beautiful Saturday morning. Since we drove here, we luckily found parking right outside the business! Do keep in mind that this is metered parking which the city charges Monday through Saturday.\n\nUpon entering, the building itself has a long rectangular shape to it. From an aesthetics perspective, it is very spacious, inviting, and bright. And with the light earth tone colored walls throughout, it allows an abundance of natural light inside. There are a few select prints along the walls and area to purchase their coffee beans, coffee mugs, high-end espresso machines, and even books. This is an example of one of many coffee houses that almost has the look and feel of an art gallery.\n\nRitual offers a simplistic yet effective menu of options. Everything from basic brewed coffee to drinks that are used with the Hario V60 dripper. And of course your basic espresso drinks including cappuccinos, macchiatos, lattes, and mochas. They also offer a nice little tea selection as well as hot chocolate and Chai lattes. There is a pastry selection including croissants, muffins, and scones but the choices are quite limited.\n\nAs far as our drinks, I ended up ordering a 16 oz. Cold Brew w/cream while she opted for their 'hot' Latte w/vanilla syrup added (available at the condiment station). We also split a blueberry vanilla scone to share. Both our drinks come out within a minute of another as we both grabbed a seat inside by the window. My drink packed a nice punch as I loved the bitterness and strength of their coffee. Her latte was very creamy, frothy, and sweet while the espresso flavor was on point. \n\nOverall, we were both very impressed with the delicate process of making their coffee drinks at \"Ritual Coffee Roasters\". The reason why I am deducting a star from this place is that there is no Wi-Fi! C'mon guys, your business is one of the major tech cities in the world, at least let us connect online! Another is that their are no power outlets for charging your phone/tablet/laptop. And finally, the prices are a bit steep but keep in mind, this is San Francisco when everything is at a premium. Aside from those little negatives, I still highly recommend this place for the avid coffee drinker. My rating, four solid stars.", "author": "Donovan H."}

Given its prime location in the Mission I can't say that I had very high expectations -  nevertheless I was surprised that the bathroom's aesthetic doesn't match the clean and elegant aesthetic of Ritual itself. \n\nUpon entering one notices a dim mood lighting that accentuates the enigmatic nature of the layered text that serves as wallpaper. It was only after minutes of squinting that my eyes adjusted to the light and I was able to read parts of the wallpaper. \n\nThe layout of the bathroom was definitely access friendly, and the gender inclusivity of these restrooms leads to my 5/5 rating. The bathroom, while low on toilet paper laid out for customers, had a nice backup supply, and there was plenty of hand soap available for even the most dedicated of germaphobes. \n\nThe distance between the sink and hand dryer are also optimal - not too much distance to splash all over the floor, yet not too close to blow air directly into the sink. \n\nThe highlight of my restroom experience was definitely the door. There are not one but four hooks, so that even the busiest of shoppers can hang all of their bags on the door. Bravo, Ritual!! \n\nAlso - there are in fact two restrooms, though I was only able to enter one in my time at this Ritual location. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed a dimly lit yet well stocked bathroom that gets the job done. \n\nP.S. I also ordered an espresso at this location - I received a dreamy and perfectly balanced shot that achieved a nice sweetness while also managing to retain a full body. Not too sour, not too bitter. In fact, while I usually return to locations based off of their bathrooms, I would honestly come back to this Ritual for the espresso alone. I also managed to snag a shot of a latte that my friend ordered, which I have included because I am impressed by the perfect micro foam needed to achieve the highly coveted latte swan.", "author": "Maya C."}

They've given us free pastries towards the end of the day, and more than a few times, the baristas have bought us coffee!  \n\nThe coffee itself is extraordinary!!  It's so delicious that my sister gets deliriously happy every time I send her a couple of bags, and my mother-in-law actually approves (she's a total coffee snob, and drinks it black).  I'm an iced latte or quadruple-shot-of-espresso kind of girl, but the pour-over coffee is very fabulous, too.\n\nThe pastries are mostly very tasty.  I think I've only had one thing that I didn't care for, and it's probably more because I'm not really a flaky-pastry kind of person.  I'm ADDICTED to their chocolate-and-sea-salt-topped peanut-butter rice krispie treats!!!  I almost didn't want to admit that in this review, because then y'all will all go there and buy them, and I won't be able to get one when I stagger in at 7:45 pm looking for my coffee and a treat!\n\nThis store is blissfully 100% WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, including the bathroom!!\n\nRitual Coffee is also clean, well-lit, and spacious, with ample seating.  It has a sparse aesthetic, so if you're looking for plush, upholstered furniture to lounge on, this won't meet your needs.  They DO have bench seating in the front part of the coffee shop, so you CAN spread out a little bit!  \n\nThere's also a parklet out front with a long bench and big table, a lovely bit of outdoor seating for a warmer day or even a chilly one, if you have the right coat and enjoy the fresh air!\n\nEven though I love this place, if I could change two things about it, it would be for them to stay open past 8 pm, and for them to have wi-fi.  But honestly, almost all of the coffee shops in the Mission close by 8 pm and don't have wifi...So much for the days of hanging out late into the evening in coffee shops chatting or playing on your computer!!\n\nI heartily recommend Ritual to anyone and everyone!!!", "author": "Amy L."}

Tons of natural light and a decent amount of seating for you to hang out with a friend or get some work done. However, compared to other coffee shops, Ritual does fall short for me. Their coffee is decent, nothing to write home about. On my visit, I got a macchiato ($3.75). A little pricier than I'd like for such a small drink, but we're in SF...so that's kind of expected. I think my biggest gripe with Ritual is their lack of wifi and outlets. I was able to get by via my Xfinity hotspot, but I wish Ritual had their own dedicated wifi provided for their customers. Ritual is perfect for those looking for a place to sit down, relax, and have a conversation with a friend. But if you're looking for a place to work and need wifi/outlet I'd recommend heading elsewhere.", "author": "Steven L."}

Is it me, or when you're in coffee shops such as these, you feel a need to KNOW what you actually want?! Usually, I'm about it! However, on a Sunday, I want to actually treat coffee like the delicacy it is. But I rushed into a latte with almond milk and a sweet shot. The wait wasn't long at all and my Sunday wish for coffee was granted. The aesthetics of the space are beautiful and the staff were quite friendly. I like the nice touch of the free post card-like pieces that showcase the way coffee is made in the shop.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-02", "description": "Time for a Ritual early evening brew ha ha\n\nRitual Coffee Roasters in the Mission District was the site for my first ever coffee cupping class.  I vividly remember the Nicaragua episode of \"Bizarre Foods\", where Andrew Zimmern slurped & spat his way through various coffee, noting the distinctive notes of each brew.  I now had the chance to see how loud a slurp I could make, distinguishing from various single origin coffee.  All the while, enjoying a high octane caffeine boost to power me on for the night.\n\nSho was our barista, and he led us through the cupping process.  Starting with South American coffee, and onward to Ethiopian grinds, Sho had us sniff the dry grinds, to envision the flavor notes in our head.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=TYxAiOEYhyHvWiRMnyM99Q\n\nThen, after brewing for a certain amount of minutes, Sho had our group sniff the brewed grinds, to see if the flavor notes we experienced before still applied or were altered in any way.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=MZiLLvVwdf25tuzBWRbVkQ\n\nAfterwards, came the highlight of any coffee cupping - tasting!  Sho demonstrated the artisan way of tasting.  By using a spoon & slowly lowering it into the brew, we slurped the coffee as loud and fast as possible, which we spat out.  Tasting this way sprays the coffee onto the tastebuds, allowing for maximum savoring.  In my opinion, the South American coffee had more sweet/floral profiles, whereas the Ethiopian coffee had bold/more assertive flavors.  What was on the unhygienic side, was we used a communal cup to wash our spoons before each sipping.  All I can say is, I was glad I was the second one & not further down the line.  \n\nUpon our coffee cupping class coming to completion, we all had our choice of drink from Ritual Coffee Roasters.  Wanting some cold with a kick, I went with Ritual's nitro cold brew-\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=NVFjUQAJ8HHblOE_grqRcg\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=YsK0c7A9MYVWW4boDJPciw\nCold, slightly acidic, caffeine-laden, the nitro cold brew hit the spot.  For the uninitiated, nitro cold brew coffee is akin to coffee beer.  Frothy, slightly bubbly & having a stoutness to it, the drink is made the day before to remove most of the acidity.  By cold brewing, the nitro cold brew contains more caffeine than traditional drip coffee.  Refreshing as can be!\n\nService was great.  Sho was quite professional during the class, communicating in unpretentious terms about coffee and the brewing process.  Our drinks came out in a timely manner and we even received free can cozys.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=yuT_2TD6454whUeYh1NJgg\n\nA fair amount of seating inside, with 2 communal tables (in front & in back).  A few tables for those alone or with someone.  Most available seating is al fresco, via wooden tables overlooking Valencia St.  Metered street parking is hard to come by, so try to visit during off hours when possible.\n\nWhile I'm not a ritual coffee enthusiast,  I do enjoy the brew at Ritual Coffee Roasters.  All the coffee beans at Ritual are roasted in San Francisco, keeping things local.  Drinks are made one cup at a time, and customers can see the attention & care that goes into the products offered here.  I had an educational & entertaining time, participating in my first coffee cupping, and Sho was as great a teacher as any during the process.  There are many caf\u00e9 options in the city of San Francisco, and it would behoove you to make Ritual Coffee Roasters one of them.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=T584HmKUR1Bu7ahNdcvz7A\n\nHighly recommend!\nNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM", "author": "Rodney S."}

I have been to a few of their different shops and each one has been well above-average. The Valencia Street location is my favorite because it has a lot of seating and feels very open. The baristas at this store are also particularly firendly. Yes, it is yuppy coffee but it is good yuppy coffee and in a city like SF where pretentious coffees hops are a dime a dozen, you are much better off spending your money at one with quality coffee. Ritual definitely competes in the top bracket of coffee in this city. Is it #1? I surely don't think so but they do churn out reliably quality coffee on a larger scale.\n\nI almost always get a Skim Cappuccino or a Pour Over and they do both quite well. I can only imagine all of their other beverages are similarly good.  I have had the baked goods at the Valencia Street shop as well on a few occasions and they are always fresh, so I cannot complain.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-08", "description": "The coffee was great, but the wait to get it was excruciating.  \n\nCoffee:  5 stars\nService and Wait Time:  2 stars \n\nIt was my first visit to Ritual.  I had heard so much about it.  I heard one of my favorite baristas from Portola Coffee in Costa Mesa even worked moved up to SF and worked there (where were you Paulina?).  Last trip up north I got to try Four Barrel.  This time I tried Ritual.  \n\nSunday afternoon.  We ordered a cappuccino and a V60 Las Manos.  My cappuccino was ready within five minutes so I grabbed that when they called me.  I added some sugar while we waited another few minutes for the V60 pour over.  I asked the barista that was handing out the drinks if I needed to wait at her station or if I needed to go to the pour over station.  She said no, they bring them to where she was.  At least 20 order pickups passed us by, including many by people that had ordered after us.  \n\nCappucino - Good beans, right temperature with the right amount of milk and foam.\n\nAt 20 minutes I went over to the pour over station and asked if my order was coming up and if the pour over girl had seen it.  She said she hadn't.  She rifled through the old orders pile and there mine was.  She says, \"Oh wow, I'll have this done next for you.\"  She had that look on her face that said, \"Oh crap this order was placed 20 minutes ago!\"  \n\nI don't know who messed up.  I'm thinking it wasn't her.  Somewhere between my payment, where the orders print and the person who brings the order slips to the V60 station, something got hella lost.  Mine wasn't the only one, there was another order next to mine that got shorted.  \n\nSo 23 minutes in, we finally got our V60 pour over.  My friend was about to go ape sh*t, but didn't because she was on vacation from Canada and didn't really want it to ruin her day.  The pour over girl approached us sheepishly with the drink and also gave us a card for a complimentary drink.  So at least she was nice enough to do that.  The first girl (not pour over girl) that I asked about our order answered me with a subtle air of annoyance even though we had been standing directly in front of her forever.\n\nThe espresso here is good.  My friend enjoyed her V60 pour over.  The price is reasonable too... it was only $3 for the pour over of the beans of your choice.  Usually I'm pretty understanding about order errors, but we were doing a one day tour of San Francisco and trying to cram in as much as we could while on the go, so the delay was a lot of wasted exploring time for us.  \n\nThe new interior of Ritual is a clean design, but it's missing the warmth and charm that a coffee house should have.  If they just traded those stringy neon or LED string lights for something more homey or old school industrial, that would give the place some charm.  Or maybe it's the high bare walls?   In reading reviews from regulars here, I can understand their lament.  Philz Coffee has been opening new locations but has managed to retain some of their Philz charm, even in their newer stores.  Could Ritual have done the same?  Maybe we just haven't programmed ourselves to accept futuristic or ultramodern coffeehouses (epitomized by the red with fluorescent backlit espresso machines).  Maybe it's just me that's not ready for it yet.  Or maybe it's because a week later I'm still annoyed that it took 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee.", "author": "Howie C."}

Aesthetically speaking, it now is on the same playing field as the Four Barrels, Sightglasses, and Blue Bottles in the city - spaciously, minimalistically rustic. \n\nI may be in the minority here, but I feel that it was a good move to do away with WiFi and the power outlets; it discourages people from hogging the tables and keeping others from being able to enjoy the space. If you want a coffee shop where you can stay immersed in your laptop screen for hours on end, there is a myriad of Starbucks within city limits you can choose from...take your pick. \n\nAs far as the coffee is concerned, Ritual was the first place where I ordered a drip coffee and did not have to add any milk or sugar. That says a lot about this roaster's ability to produce a balanced cup with no acidity, and it speaks volumes about the baristas who work there as well. Even though I buy Ritual beans from Whole Foods, manually grind with my Hario Skerton before brewing with a Chemex, I still don't achieve the same quality from home as when I get a cup from Ritual itself.

I like to think that Ritual Coffee Roasters is the more mature version of the relatively new, sparsely decorated coffee shop in Berkeley, Artis.  Both shops cater to elite coffee connoisseurs and relative newbies alike.  However, Ritual feels older and, perhaps, a little more forgiving, while still maintaining its commitment to excellent coffee prepared with the utmost care.  In addition to working intimately with their coffee bean producers, they offer multiple espresso roasts to choose from for your cup o' joe.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you will notice shelves of different coffee pots and tea wares on your left, much like Artis.  On the right wall of Ritual, you will see cool photo prints of Japanese city life.  My friends got a kick out of the fugu sign in one of the busy Japanese street prints, as they were fresh off the plane from their sojourn in Japan.  During their stay, they had tasted the puffer, which can cause sudden death by poison if prepared incorrectly.  But I digress... \n\nThere are thick wooden tables throughout the shop for sipping, working, chatting, or just soaking up that ultra cool Ritual vibe that abounds.  Despite the construction, which blocked off a good portion of the space, Ritual still had a steady stream of customers during my visit.\n\nMy mocha was so smooth and well-rounded.  The semi-sweetness of chocolate punctuated the fruity undertones of the coffee so perfectly.  Of course, my boyfriend ordered his usual macchiato espresso.  He commented that it was excellent, albeit not as strong as he prefers.  (I tried the macchiato and thought it was just right for such a drink, so I would still recommend it to you :p)  Five stars for Ritual!  I'll be back next time I'm in the Mission.

I couldn't come up with a definition on my own, other than \"you'll know it when you see one\".  I thought Ritual would be the place for me to show her what they look like in their native habitat. \n\nYou can imagine my surprise when we stepped into the newly remodeled flagship Ritual shop. I'm not sure it's all that new but then again, I haven't been to this location for years since parking normally sucks. \n\nThe new digs are pretty nice looking. This location is not nearly as cramped as it was previously. Then again, we made our stop in here on an early weekday evening, so perhaps we missed the crowds.  \n\nI've been a fan of Ritual for years. Although I usually get my fix in Napa lately. Be sure to ask for a punch card as they don't always volunteer to give you one. I have now had my punch card stamped at all four Ritual locations. They are my favorite brand of coffee, even over my beloved Timeless in Oakland. Sure they don't have v3gan pastries that I know of , but their coffee is so much more smooth in taste and texture as far as the lattes go. \n\nThey take their coffee brewing prowess seriously 'round here, yet not pretentiously so. The cold brew is high quality as is their pour over single brew selections. Not sure if it's the technique, or the roasting. Most likely both. \n\nIf I can have one last coffee before I die, it would be Ritual. If I could afford to do this ritual everyday, I most certainly would. \n\nSure there's plenty of hipster folk that frequent this place, if you're looking to get all \"crikey\" and spot a few, this is a much more comfortable and tasty environment to do so than say Fourbarrel down the street.", "author": "John B."}

Blue Bottle and Philz are really good too, but I like Ritual better than Four Barrel and Sightglass. I stopped by the store a few weeks ago and purchased a couple of beans to brew at home:\n\n-Organic Pinabetal Whole Beans (Notes of Vanilla, Canteloupe, Rainier Cherry, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco?select=DClsyAPtSHV1i1XJiRSExw#DClsyAPtSHV1i1XJiRSExw): I really liked the flavor notes listed on the bag, but I couldn't really detect them when drinking the coffee. Also, this ended up being a really light brew, and I prefer my coffee a little stronger. I wouldn't get this blend again.\n-Siberia Whole Beans (Notes of Sweet Citrus, Cherry, Caramel): This was Processing Experiment #1 w/Traditional Fermentation, and I loved the flavors! The caramel flavor really rounded out the medium bodied coffee. I would definitely purchase this again. \n\nRitual has never been cheap, but I think they might have raised their prices recently since they won that coffee challenge. In any case, although each bag of beans was pricey(between $18-$19 for a 12 oz bag), you are paying for the quality. I don't know if I could justify purchasing Ritual beans for everyday drinking since the bf usually drinks 3 cups/day, but I will definitely be back to try out additional blends and hopefully purchase the Siberia again. Note that it takes them a while to prepare your coffee since they use a drip method, and the line can get long at times. However, there are plenty of tables to sit at inside and hang out.

The space was warm and inviting, the coffee always perfect, and the staff friendly. It was a community spot for folks to come in out of the chilly San Francisco weather, sit down with friends over a cup of coffee, or with a notebook and pen, or computer. It's what a coffee shop should be.\n\nFast forward to 2015. Ritual Coffee underwent a massive remodel in 2014. This was my first time back since. Whoever designed the interior space or thought this was a good idea should be taken out and shot.\n\nThe new Ritual is cold and sterile. The design makes you feel miniscule and dwarfed immediately making you feel unwelcome. Most of the tables are gone though with the chilly atmosphere, one doesn't want to linger, and my guess is that is exactly what they want. They want their customers to come in grab a cup and go. No more lingering, no more community feel. The customers are no longer welcome to sit and be a part of what made Ritual Coffee great. The redesign is a concept to get the customer in and out as quickly as possible, to serve more is to, afford the increasing rents of the Mission. \n\nThe pastry and baked goods were terrible. Either they were days old or the baker doesn't know what they are doing. The croissant literally crumbled when I touched it. Whatever happened to moist, flaky, pastries? I couldn't even eat it as it just kept crumbling. Oh, and let's talk about the price. Two pastries and two coffees came to twenty-two dollars, yes twenty-two dollars! No thank you, never again.\n\nSimply put the design doesn't fit. It has nothing to do with the neighborhood it once supported. It's as if Ritual Coffee has turned it's back on the community and the people who supported it, all for a quick buck.\n\nI will not return.\n\nMy rating...1 Paw\n\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours....Happy eating.\nShatasdogbowl.", "author": "DJ S."}

The interior is modernized but not as impressive as Four Barrel in the Mission or Sightglass in SOMA.  \n\nThe cashier was very nice when helping me choose which tea to order of the six they had to offer.  The teas are all signature flavors you won't find easily anywhere else.  I decided on the Peach something or rather.... it had a super long name I can't remember LOL.  There are some Baristas here that are seriously attractive.  Not to mention the patrons who were here the time I came in were mighty fine as well.  Most everyone else complete in their Mission hipster clothing as well.  \n\nOverall the tea around lunchtime helped wake me up and stave off lunch for a while longer.  I love visiting these boutique artisan coffee houses; I really think they are a wave of the future.  I despise the commonality of Starbucks, if you ever see me check-in there I am probably not ordering a drink.  Although I am guilty of doing that every once in a while.

They had chairs, bar seating, love-seats and couches. I could sit for a few minutes or for hours and see the diverse folks of the Mission roll in and out. There were hipsters, tweakers, young preppy kids, older activists and artists, family folks with kids in strollers, students, and of course tech people. \n\nToday I walked in and...wow. Whiteness and tech everywhere.  The decor fits this description, but the clientele even more so. Young white people with laptops and expensive clothes and haircuts.  That was it. Oh sure, there was some diversity -- there was both young white dudes with blazers and also some young white dudes with plaid shirts (oh so carefully unbuttoned at the top to show that they've been spending time at the gym). \n\nLess seating; much less seating.

It was blindingly bright in there! That alone was enough to wake a person up, no coffee required.\n\nSeriously, it seems like they wanted to make it as uninviting as possible - between the white cube aesthetic and the elimination of wifi & electrical outlets, they've probably solved the problem of people 'hogging the tables' that another reviewer claimed Ritual used to have.

Yet I just had to write a quickie on Ritual Coffee Roasters.\n\nI'll start off by saying that the double 8 oz latte I had was delicious. Ritual's espresso has a really distinctive, overtly nutty quality to it that I really enjoy. Almost like unsalted almonds. The latte was creamy and perfectly proportioned.\n\nBut dear god, the obnoxious EDM music they were blaring in this cavernous cafe was such an assault on my ears that it drove me out the doors as soon as I finished my drink. It's bad enough that the interior of this cafe is soul-suckingly spartan and cold, but the awful sound of Transformers fucking just put it over the top. No, not every cafe has to do the Bohemian thing, with comfy couches and warm tones of brown and turquoise. Other reviewers have mentioned that this is a good place to study due to the large amount of seats and outlets. I suppose if you crammed earphones in and blasted your own music to drown out the cacophonous dretch coming from the speakers, then you could get some decent studying done.\n\nFor a passerby like me, who simply wanted a brief respite from a day of hauling it around town, I was pretty bummed out.

For that sole reason, I have to give credit where credit is due.  What I ordered here is beside the point, as it tasted like a hot cup of failure, because it's insignificant compared to the debacle I saw.  \n\nRitual is more of the antisocial social gathering spot and coffee just happens to be there.  \n\nWe were here only for the sake of getting directions and needed Internet due to unfortunate housing circumstances.  More than half of the people there that day were set up neatly on their Apple MacBooks, all contaminating the free WiFi by broadcasting their unimaginative and uneventful lives on display via all mediums of social media as though they are worthy of everyone's attention, time, and envy. \n\nIn a sad attempt to paint their lives into a Picasso of marvel and wonder because they have nothing better to do than to tell everyone else worthless details about themselves that amount to the sweat off a donkey's ass.  As if people want to know exactly what type of muffins you ate for breakfast and how it felt going down.  Or what funny color your stool was that you laid out in your significant other's toilet.  \n\nThese people are paralyzed by their frivolous existence and a lack of purpose that they need to desperately fill the gaping holes in their lives, as large as the ones they find in their dank skinny jeans that strangle their decrepit nut-sacks, with photos and tweets that stroke their egos.  This place could use fewer lemmings who insist on spewing inane bullshit out of every pore in their faces.\n\nYou know a place fucking sucks when its definition of good coffee music is Wiz Khalifa.  If that scene is going to happen, I had better be seeing free drugs laid out in front of me.  I wasn't even high and I couldn't tell where to put my dirty cups or silverware and where to grab clean silverware.  I am fed up with places like Ritual whose primary focuses are out of alignment.  Let's face it, their coffee and chai here taste diluted and caters to sad-loner-douches. \n\nI'm not hating because this place is all swag, hot, and in the developing district of Mission.

They were pretty good back then. Lots of French press coffee. \n- quality dropped when they started roasting their own beans. Hard to be as good as Stumptown starting out. \n- Jeremy Tooker left, taking hipness with him, leaving the shop full of more regular people or SF state faculty types. \n- later they focused on brewing coffee with the Clover brewer, the ultra-expensive robot French press (later bought out by Starbucks). The benefit of this was a menu of drip coffee options. \n- they later switched to making drip coffee using a Hario V60 pour-over station. At first, they didn't know how to do it right, quickly dumping a pitcher of water into the cone and and calling it a \"90 second extraction.\" Thankfully they've gotten better at it. \n\nRitual specializes in light roasted single origin coffee beans and a changing \"seasonal\" espresso\n\nSeems like they have gotten better more recently. I appreciate that they stay open later than most modern coffee roaster shops in town.  I've had a few good cups at the Valencia St and Napa locations. \n\nTheir beans are hit or miss though.

Deciding to follow the advice of fellow yelpers I trekked over to Ritual and found myself staring at the coffee makers (should I call them baristas?) delicately making coffee through paper cone filters using flasks and then pouring them into 12oz coffee cups. It seemed more like art than anything else I've experienced at the national chains.  The gentleman making the coffee was very helpful as I explained I was a newbie and was looking at specific tastes. He recommended several coffees including Sweet Tooth and Organic Hama.  The coffees were spot on, not too acidic and not overly strong.  Each coffee on the menu had a description of what it taste like such as: peaches and watermelon, or lilac and lavender.  The coffees I had a sweet note to them, but I wasn't sure if it tasted like the description. Nonetheless I was hooked and decided to buy 1lb each of the coffees I sampled. At $20 a pound it can be a bit pricey, but since I was on vacation I decided to splurge.", "author": "William T."}

This isn't  a problem by any stretch, in fact their caffeine offering is usually much improved by this decision, but I was becoming more and more anxious that I hadn't been to their flagship store on Valencia. Ritual continues to increase their stranglehold on the fine city of San Francisco and I knew nothing about their inner sanctum. Unacceptable!\n\nI ventured into the Mission on a - well, a mission - to discover what made Ritual tick. With so many independent cells all over the city I figured I've got something to learn, right? It's like Megalomaniacal Dictator 101.\n\nI WAS a bit disappointed. Blue Bottle's got bubbling beakers and such, and I would model my secret lair after Four Barrel in a heartbeat, but Ritual doesn't have much flair. The space is nice, don't get me wrong - it's pleasant even - but it lacks that attitude and panache. The accent walls were nice, the old school lightbulbs were charming, and it's a good place to crack open a laptop, but as THE Ritual, it fell a bit short. And why were there no robot minions making coffee? \n\nAs I mentioned, I do enjoy a cup of Ritual Roast from time to time. So, I decided to square up and order the drink on which I judge all other coffee shops: double shot americano - or as I like to call it \"the firing squad\". Perhaps while soaking in the ambiance I might find some hidden passageway to their insidious inner workings.  I regret to say that I've had MUCH better americano. It was... weak. And it felt small in my iron fist.\n\nHOWEVER! The homemade \"oreo\" cookie was to kill for! If nothing else, they will make it onto my Chosen list just for this. It was the perfect compliment to my drink, and I dare say it would go well with ANY coffee-based drink. \n\nOverall, the experience was good, and I'll definitely go back. 3 stars!

They have about 3 different coffees on tap (well, on drip) and they are absolutely delicious. As for the place itself, it gets crowded... very crowded. I don't know if it's because the coffee is so good or because the hipsters are so... well I can't think of a good adjective for them. If you're here to work, then the best of luck to you. The internet isn't bad however finding a table, let alone an outlet, is very difficult. That doesn't seem to stop people though. Tables aside, the music can be a problem.

It seems difficult to find coffee shops in this city that serve tea properly or tea shops in this city that aren't too twee. \n\nRitual does it right using loose leaf tea from red blossom and cups with strainers and lids (no tea bags! Coffee Bar :| ). The water is also a decent temperature. I'd say it's slightly too hot for green and slightly too cold for black so it works for both if you pay attention to the steeping time.  Some places (I'm looking at you Coffee Bar!) use water that is way too hot. Price seems about right for tea too considering that they'll continue to give you hot water to re-steep.\n\nAs for the space, my only quibble is that the areas near the plugs aren't as well lit as the areas without them. I like their taste in music too although it can be a little difficult to study to some times. And it might just be me, but my connection to their wifi is pretty weak, which is both a blessing and a curse.

While I was pleased with my latte, I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about here.  BUT, I find the place a bit cold and industrial, with its minimalist decor and warehouse feel. But hey - maybe minimalism is in, and if that's your thing, you'll definitely dig this place. I just happen to prefer smaller, more intimate and colorful places to work. \n\nThat said, the place itself is indeed very spacious and offers ample seating for people like me who like to camp out typing away all day fueled by caffeine and coffee cake. But because this place is so trendy, the size of the place doesn't seem to make finding a seat any easier, given that it is just ALWAYS busy. \n\nOne nice touch though is their wireless network doesn't require a password, which saved me my usually inevitable trip back up to the counter to ask for the password. (I know, I know. I'm revealing my laziness here.) But hey! In a place as busy as this, it can take several minutes to get a barista's attention if you want to pay them the courtesy of waiting for a natural breaking point in their work to ask.\n\nOtherwise another positive thing about Ritual is the music they play is ideal background music. I find many places are so self-conscious about NOT playing Top 40 tunes or anything that is even remotely popular that the music tends to be experimental and consequently distracting. \n\nSo, though this place is probably too busy and big for my taste, I'd have no problem joining a friend there again or even attempting to find a spot to work. Not a favorite, but definitely more than A-OK. (If there were half star options in Yelp, it'd definitely deserve three and a half.)", "author": "Anne D."}

My euro pal was aghast, and kept repeating what it was that he wanted.  The response was just same each time: \"No, we only pull ristretto.\"  \n\nTo show you the rube I am, I didn't know at the time that \"ristretto\" meant short-pulled espresso.  I mean, I sorta sussed it out based on context, so I was cool.  I do think, however, that homeboy behind the counter, who, btw, wasn't from Italy, could have made the effort a bit and just told us in plain in English what it was that they only do there at Ritual.\n\nEuro friend, deflated from his repeated attempts at trying to get what he wanted, finally just ordered an espresso.  With cup of coffee in hand, I took a seat.  From my vantage point I could see the European, en route to sitting down, putting tap water in his espresso, and the look of horror on the barista's face as he did so.

However, I've had mixed experiences at their coffee shops.  My espressos have ranged from great to way over extracted, so I usually back-off and order Gibraltars or Cappuccinos.  Those are hard to mess up for 'upper tier' coffee houses.\n\nLet me elaborate on the pretension I mentioned above.  I have visited a lot of coffee shops across this country.  Los Angeles (where I live now), New York City (where I'm from), San Francisco, Portland, etc.  Pretentious hipsters are part of the American coffee scene and as long as the coffee speaks for itself, I don't care who is serving it.  That said, it's over the top at Ritual.  The first time I walked into Ritual's Mission location I was met (read: ignored) by a sneering gargoyle perched at the cash register.  I waited patiently, standing at the cash register by myself (no line), for him to finish bullshitting with his equally aloof co-worker for about three minutes.  I eventually had to interrupt to ask a few questions about the espresso they were using that day.  Generic one. word. answers. followed by a sneer after every unsatisfactory response.  I placed my order and... the espresso was TERRIBLE.  Over extracted, totally bitter.  I don't believe in judging any coffee shop by one drink, especially one as well regarded as Ritual, so I followed the espresso up with a Gibraltar, which was good, but not remarkable.  I left very disappointed.\n\nI have since visited Ritual a few more times and my experiences with the coffee have been all over the place.  I've had good and bad Gibraltars/Cappuccinos, but the baristas are just beyond aloof (though not as bad as the stooge on my first visit).  They appear totally uninterested and generally pissed off at the customer.  For a company that seems to exude a love of coffee, it's almost as if the baristas undergo \"Don't Give a Fuck 101\" training when they are brought on.\n\nIn a city filled with so many options (Four Barrel, Blue Bottle, and Sightglass to name a few), I don't see how this shop can remain viable with such terrible customer service.\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read:\n\nVery good roasts\nAverage espresso/espresso-based drinks\nPetulant baristas", "author": "Lee R."}

When Keane L. told me Ritual Coffee Roasters was one of his favorite coffee places, I had to find out how it compared to the delicious cafe con leche I had on my trip.\n\nThis place has over a half ton of reviews and I read quite a few before stopping by. I was expecting a long wait, a crowded space full of people and pretentious egos. In a way, I'm glad that was my expectation. It's like when I meet a new person and I think they're going to be a jerk and they turn out to be really cool. It makes me like them even more.\n\nI showed up on Tuesday night around 7:00 PM. There was no wait and only a handful of patrons hanging out inside. I ordered a soy latte and while I waited for my drink, a enjoyed a nice little chat with the barista about being vegan. I had asked him about the vegan donuts (they had sold out for the night) and explained how I am trying out being vegan. He told me about how he was vegan for about three years and now just believes in moderation. I asked him to recommend another vegan pastry/dessert and he suggested the vegan chocolate cake. \n\nI took my drink and my cake and headed toward BART. The latte was the PERFECT TEMPERATURE to be enjoyed immediately. I'm not a fan of scalding hot beverages because I hate waiting and usually end up burning my tongue. Not this time. It was smooth and slightly sweet. \n\nThe vegan chocolate cake was delicious and moist. It was lightly dusted with what I guess was confectioners sugar but it could have been cocaine. Coke is vegan too, right?\n\nMmMmmmMMmmmMMmmmmmmmm............\n\nI will definitely be coming back here. \n\nIf you love coffee, please don't avoid going here just because of what people say regarding the hipsters. They're just people like everyone else and if they love coffee and you love coffee then you already have something in common. Besides, some of them are kind of cute ;)", "author": "Daisy S."}

So earlier in the morning, we came here after my daughter's doctor's appointment. \n\nAs expected, every visit to Ritual, the kids wants the tasty and crafty Hot Cocoa and I got two 12 oz cups each for $3.00 for them to enjoy. Unfortunately with dad's busy schedule, we were forced to take the drinks to go. They usually like to drink the hot beverage indoors with their red mug and enjoy the heart shape foam-topping presented by the shop's artistic baristas. Oh yeah, going to Rituals has made their day!\n\nI bought a large 16 oz. Caf\u00e9 Latte. Yes, that is one damn tasty espresso drink for $4.00. I also bought a bag of whole bean coffee from Yemen for wife and I to enjoy for the next few days. The blend is Moka San'ani blend. The $12.50 bagged coffee is weighed 3/4 of a pound and is one of the coffee shop's milder and comforting blends. The fresh batch was freshly grounded on July 1 (with the date imprinted on the red bag). \n\nI used my Visa for this morning's visit.

What I found was honest and intriguing, but less than legendary.  They had three tiers of coffee, priced at $3/4/5.  They roast their own coffee, which is evident from the flavor and texture.  I love custom roasted coffee!  I admire that they only serve pour-over style.  All that aside, the coffee just didn't blow me away.   It was a little bland.\n\nFor better fresh-roasted coffee, check out Augie's if you're ever in Redlands, CA.  It's the best I've ever had--and I hear they were inspired by Ritual.  I just wasn't all that impressed by Ritual.  It looked like a fun independent scene, but strictly on the coffee it didn't live up to the reputation.  It doesn't mean it's bad.  Far from it.  Just not the best.\n\nYou might also check out Winter Blend from the It's A Grind chain.  It's truly my favorite coffee ever.", "author": "Jeff R."}

However, I was determined to try Ritual Coffee Roasters and I arrived early enough on a Sunday to score an all day free parking spot on Valencia.  They also had plenty of tables and some sofas (the power outlets are towards the back) and it seemed like a great spot to plug in the old laptop (free wi-fi!) and get some work done.  \n\nThe pastry case mainly had cake slices, scones, croissants, and some bagels.  I tried the pumpkin cake which was decent; the slice was small and it didn't have nuts (a good thing) but I prefer a spicier cake.  Anyway, the reason I came was for the coffee, not the cake.  \n\nThe latte was smooth and mellow with lots of foam.  In that regard, I liked very much.  I did expect (and hoped) that the coffee would be considerably stronger though.  \n\nAs far as getting work done is concerned, the room was HOT and stuffy.  I was sitting by the coffee roasting machine (maybe if I moved, it wouldn't be so hot) and the guy was roasting coffee the entire time I was there.  If you love the smell of freshly roasted coffee, this is the place for you.\n\nThe crowds came around 10:30 AM.  Combined with the heat and the noise, the atmosphere became stifling.  I did see hipsters but not interesting characters - if you want to see those, go to Coffee to the People.  They seriously attract several regulars who talk to themselves, sometimes very loudly.  Or there's this one guy who changes tables all the time and leaves his belongings on various tables that he's not sitting at.  Those are characters.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Why bc I'm smiling? Not too emo for you? Bc I giggled before it was my turn? Bc I actually admired your \"money of the world wall\", was I supposed to instead sulk and think ignore the money wall and pretend I've seen more unique and better ideas? ... didn't know there were rules prohibiting these compliments of actually having a good time in your coffee shop. \n\nI got my cup of tea ... then it came to getting sugar and a straw for it, the girl down the other end of the \"barista\" area, ignored my asking for a spoon and just nodded her head towards the straws.

Ritual roasts their own beans.\n- Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso & steaming milk: Check \n- High quality Milk: Check. I am pretty sure they use Clover but can't remember if they use the Organic version or not.\n- Latte Art: Check\n\nI like comparing Ritual and Four Barrel with one another. Both are walking distance from each other on Valencia street and both are highly representative of San Francisco Third Wave Coffee movement (see tech specs above and my Four Barrel review).  While both have much in common they also are in some ways opposites. Opposites, not in quality but in style. Ritual is more of your modern coffee house that attracts people with laptops. Not a lot of conversations going on from what I was able to tell. The Baristas, while friendly are a little more all about getting the job done efficiently and making sure the long line gets attended to quickly. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything you order there.

Apparently, they've blocked if not all, most of the outlets that prevent anyone from plugging in.  WTF.\n\nNot sure what it is, but lately, things have been changing in my life.  Changing in the way that if I have not experienced it before, then the proclivities associated with the sudden appearance causes silly attempts on my part to recover and react accordingly.  These sorts of situations do not act well if I have not had my decent caffeine.  Especially when a day (like today) is somewhat vindictive, filled with mirth and hormonal idiosyncrasies (the moon, the weather, the sporadic shifts in pressure when it becomes dark and Grey outside) that can make any sweet person begin to sprout little nubs of horns on their head.  A true competition of personalities, one who wants to remain in a dormant state of continual sleep or the other, ready to cast a line out over the Pacifica Pier.\n\nSunday found me looking and relaying this desire for caffeine to W as we drove about on Valencia looking for a good place.  \n\nRitual Coffee Roasters\n\nNice.  I had never been.\n\nI was immediately taken back as if on the dreamride to the past.  A retrospective of when I was in Seattle and I took up residence for several days at the local haunt (Victrola Coffee Roasters http://www.victrolacoffee.com/) by ordering several huge white porcelain cups of their latte accompanied by the occasional large cranberry nut muffin.  \n\nThe difference is this in SF:\n\nHipster galore.  I'm talking about neat colors of the rainbow decorating the hair, multiple piercings, tattoos...creatives, techies, artists and actors.  I'm not complaining, I'm a musician.  I recall a man from my past that came with such interesting trappings and despite that experience adding itself to my failed barrel of relationships, it was a nice memory spiked with differences and the occasional trips to the tattoo parlor to watch them finesse away at his back, one large work of art.\n\nThe mood of the place is still, yet vibrant and humming with energy.  An excellent set-up with a large communal table as well as single areas with easy plug-ins along the wall.  I also requested an orange scone slathered with glaze and the delightful quirk of citrus flavor echoed smoothly throughout the starchy respite from having no breakfast.  Equally inviting, were the large gunny sacks lying about in Roman gluttonous splendor.........were these to be used as chairs, backdrops or a separation barrier?  I wonder..\n\nI felt equally at home as I was up in the Pacific Northwest....  Except that the men here were not wearing North Face fleece zip-ups and neat black frames.  The feeling was, a bit more candid...simply said.\n\nWhen we entered the cafe, we were about 5 people deep.  Nothing bad and nothing that would seem thwarting to our coffee search.  By the time we left, the line had gone out the door.  My large cap was warming my hands and the sun was equally so outside.  \n\nMy advice, is to either arrive early or be ready to wait in patient ardor for your caffeine god or goddess, whichever you prefer, and to accept the perfect delivery of liquid prophecies.", "author": "Miika M."}

I also do did notice some African offerings.  RR is now back on my monthly list of beans to get.  \n\nPeople comparing this to Philz... have no clue about good rich coffee.  I can garauntee you Philz beans are pretty old. They rely on roasting the crap out of it with other flavors to mask the staleness of the bean.  I spent 7 bucks on a JAMAICAN BM at Philz....their ghetto baristas hinted I put more cream n some sugar.     YUP they were right... the coffee needed it badly....they knew off the bat when I told them I wanted very little cream n no sugar that I was in for a surprise!!!!

My friend had a cocoa with an ornately designed leaf patter on the milk and I'm assuming it was pretty good because she downed it in like 5 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe broad layout of the room, with local art and knick-knacks hanging on the walls, creates a nice space, reminiscent of the early days of Equator down in Pasadena. The clientele reminded me of my art school/TA days, so I'll have to say there was some nostalgia even though I hadn't been here before. Although it was a Saturday night, it didn't seem that crowded and I figured out why when they started turning off the lights at 11pm. Wish it was open at least another hour so I could get a better feel for the ambiance. So far so good but I'll have to spend more time here one of these days to get a really good idea of it.", "author": "Kim N."}

But as much as I think Ritual does a excellent job sourcing and roasting coffee, I can not get into a $3.75 cent mug of coffee.

Sell me a pound, or a half pound. Or whatever I ask for. But try to fool me with the 12 oz bag. That's too much like the 1.5 qt or 14oz ice cream package scam. On the trivial side, the Ritual logo is too f-ing precious. A cross between like the islamic symbol and the CCCP. It's just too cool for me. Perhaps they are trying to justify there inflated prices. So, though the beans deserve a 4.5, I am deducting a point and a half for Rituals neo-corporate logo driven sales persona.\n\nLastly, and I admit, I am being  a nit-picking asshole here: For each cup, they measure a standard amount of beans and water. This is better than no standardization, but really, not all beans are created equal. Each batch of beans requires an adjustment to the water/coffee ratio in order to optimize the brew.

I am compelled to write an update today because of poor customer service today.  I've read in other reviews that the staff, at times, tend to be standoffish and service, in general, can be spotty.  Is this expected of coffee Nazi's?\n\nI come in this morning and wait for my turn.  There seemed to be a changing of the cash-register guard as I waited and it took quite some time since the one already manning it seemed either spaced out or was already imagining her impending break. I had 20 dollar bill in hand ready to give her my order and she just stood there, partly chatting to a coworker and partly fiddling with cash.  She did not even look at me or tell me that someone was going to be with me in a moment. She just walked away. So, that's rudeness Number One.\n\nRudeness Number Two was when the replacement, who was just as distracted and space out asked me \"so, you have money for your order?\"  Are you serious?  I stood there patiently waiting to give you my order and hand you my payment and YOU ask me if I have money for your order?  \n\nYour staff's arrogance can only go on so long with people who are not that addicted to your coffee, really.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-01", "description": "Any coffee shop that can't make a cappuccino is failing on a very basic level. I attempted to order a 'dry' cappuccino, and was informed that they can't give me just foam because they can't just spoon it off the top. What I received was a small latte. Hot milk with the tiniest surface of foam poured into a shot of espresso. The espresso was not terrible, but not particularly inspirational either, especially considering being muted by the milk. I suspect that they have this policy because the barista want to draw fancy patterns into the top of your drink, which I hear is all the rage now, and with a traditional cappuccino, there is no chance to draw a fun little heart or rose or pair of skinny jeans into the top of your coffee.\n\nHowever, outside of an inability to make foam, the ambiance is not bad. There is good natural lighting, muted and elegant decoration, and comfortable (and available) seating with no hassle free internet. The music is a bit too noisy and experimental for my tastes, but it is not overpowering. Also, there is a distinct lack of available power outlets, which I suppose discourages the type of table hogging and camping that can often occur in coffee shops nowadays. I think that a larger collection of small tables would be of service here, as only one of the many 4 person tables has more than a single person with a laptop occupying.\n\nIf I come back, I'd either order one of the specialty espresso shots or a latte proper. I've been spoiled by amazing coffee elsewhere in the mission, which leaves my expectations for a hip cafe like this rather high, especially when it comes to the very basics of espresso drinks.", "author": "Christophe T."}

Their latte's are the perfect balance between freshly-roasted beans and perfectly frothed milk with a little Italian-style heart or leaf 'etched' on top.  So pretty you almost hate to have to stir in your Sugar-in-the-Raw, 'cause you can see that this is true artisan-ship, made by a true artisan, and it's just so darned pretty! An invigorating work of art served hot in a recyclable paper cup. Truly a 5-star cup of Italian-influenced love.\n\nBut riddle me this: what gives with the lovely latte being poured 2-fingers from the top? Did someone accidentally write the secret code for \"room for cream\" on the side of the cup? Did you run out of milk leaving my latte a little short on the pour? Are you helping me watch my waistline by eliminating calories? (trust me, those 2-fingers of milk really aren't going to make a dent)\n\nNo. That's not the case, is it? In fact, you *always* give me a latte filled 2-fingers from the top, *don't* you, Ritual? You get some kind of sicko pleasure from making me ask for more milk! And you know it's not the cold milk I want, but more frothy hot milk your artisan hands must hold and transform into creamy goodness!! You know that I know that you hold the power -- the key to the makings of the perfect latte!\n\nAll I know is that for almost $4.00 for a large latte, y'all need to stop bein' so stingy with the milk, because no one needs room for cream in a latte, my waistline is my responsibility, and the power exchange business is, well, it's for the Power Exchange. Honestly, Ritual, it gets a little old asking for my cup to be filled every single time I come in.

Because I wanted them to like me, which would make them want to come back to me, which would mean more and greater tips.\n\nEarlier today I had a rather nice time at Ritual, getting some schoolwork done, futzing on email. When I got home, I futzed for a bit before finishing up a project I was working on. I opened up my bag to pull out my computer...\n\n...But my laptop wasn't in my bag. Feeling like an idiot, I called Ritual and told them that I thought that I may have left my laptop there. The woman who answered the phone laughed at me, was away from the phone for less than ten seconds and then laughed some more as she told me it wasn't there. \n\nLike I said, there's an etiquette involved. The correct procedure would have been to take on a concerned tone, to cover the mouthpiece for another twenty seconds, and then to assure me that if my computer turned up then she'd make sure I got it. Maybe even to pretend to want my number just in case, and then, when she got off the phone, THEN she could have laughed at me for being an idiot. \n\nI rode my bike over and- hey! It was right where I'd left it, right where I told her it was! Thanks, Ritual! See you at Phil'z!\n\nAlso, an anecdote: \n\nA few days after the Aqua Teen movie came out, some friends of mine and I ate a bunch of brownies and went to go see it. Before the movie started, we looked around and realized that we were sitting behind a row of men who all looked exactly like the Comic Book Guy on \"The Simpsons\".

They are one of the few places in the mission to actually turn on the heat when it gets cold.   The owners worked really hard on the place and it shows.  Being open so late doesn't hurt them at all either.\r\n\r\nTheir coffee to me is the best of the rest in SF.  The top spot goes to Blue Bottle, but Ritual make a decent effort.\r\n\r\nI give Ritual extra points for listening to their customers.  When it first opened we wandered in and the person behind the counter noticed Mr. Fatty was wearing a garment emblazoned with the word \"VEGAN\" and began to question us about the kinds of vegan treats we'd like to see them carry.  A few weeks later they were carrying what we suggested - the sherry cakes and the macaroons.\r\n\r\nThe laptop squatters are a problem.  I have never understood why cafes tolerate that scene when it so obviously drives paying customers away while the laptoper sits there sipping the cold dregs of their one cup of coffee.  I wish cafes would give these people a time limit and then turf them out, either that or get another room just for the laptop people and have them pay rent.  Dolores Park Cafe is bad for this too, though it's not generally laptops, it's people with 10 giant textbooks and a notebook.\r\n\r\nIt's funny to me when people complain that hipsters go to a certain place, therefore it's pretentious.

I've had very good coffee and espresso here. Hence, the second star.\n\nWhat I've *never* had is efficient service, a properly hot latte, or anything approaching decent pastries (lose all the vegan stuff people: it is held together by that plastic wrap). \n\nFor example, my housemate Peter G. (also a yelper, see his review on Ritual) was served a latte when he ordered a house coffee (he does not latte, as he is from the midwest). When he inquired why he was waiting so long for a house brew, he was incorrectly told he had ordered a latte, served a latte, and informed he'd have to wait at least 12 minutes if he wanted his house brew, because they'd have to brew a new pot of coffee.  That this might defeat the entire point of drinking coffee is an argument seemingly lost on Ritual's uber-hip, vainglorious staff.\n\nTheir edict that one not use a cell phone while in line would be reasonable, if the line did not take 30 minutes to wade through. And---and this is truly amazing---even when the line is nil, a cappuccino is STILL 11 solid minutes from my hands.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to use thicker, non-bleached filters for the pour-over coffee; it will reduce bitterness and provide a bleach-free coffee experience.\n\nEdit No 2: Gabe from Ritual followed up with me, and we came to an understanding.

However, I was informed by the man behind the counter that espresso is traditionally enjoyed \"at the bar\" and not \"to go.\" No shit? I thought they had cardboard cups centuries ago in Italy! It wasn't a malicious or mean attitude. Just a sort of condescending fact-delivery by someone who assumed I needed to be educated on something I already know about. It is analogous to a waiter telling you that you should \"really be placing the knife back on the plate before taking a bite.\" \n\nThe point is, even if you are right, you shouldn't make a customer argue with you to get what they order. Hell, I could have a ceramic phobia, and it would be publicly embarrassing to have to go into it in front of other customers. Assumptions are definitely not cool, nor is it very enlightened to put people on the spot when providing a service to them.\n\nAnyway, I finally gave up just to get my espresso.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-23", "description": "Caveat #1: I don't have it in for hipsters.  I don't get them, but I'm not a hater.\nCaveat #2: I'm not a snobby connoisseur of coffee.  Just an avid fan, especially of the non-Starbucks, fair trade variety.  \n\nThat being said, let's review my first (and probably last) Ritual Coffee experience:\n\nI walk in.  There is no line, just a customer chatting with the cashier/barista at the counter.  Neither of them chose to acknowledge my existence until they had finished their chat.  In the meantime, I perused the list of special roasts.  I winced a bit inside at the prices (I have yet to become fully accustomed to San Francisco costs).  In my head I decided, \"What the hell?  Give it a try.\"\n\nI ordered a small non-fat chai.  The cashier took my $3 and pulled out a paper cup that seemed not much bigger than your average Dixie cup.  I was stunned that I was being charged $3 for what seemed to be not much more than a shot of chai tea.  Again, I tried to remind myself that this is foodie-ville and one has to accept high prices for truly delectable fare.\n\nThen I waited for my Dixie cup to be filled.  Gradually, the group of people waiting grew larger and larger.  The too-cool-for-school barista could not have been less affected by the number of people waiting for their coffees.  Instead, he opened some newly arrived boxes and chatted with other customers.  Once he was good and ready, he decided to start working on our orders.  \n\nWhen he finally finished mine, he announced, \"Small soy chai.\"  I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, I actually ordered a non-fat chai,  not a soy chai.\"  In response, he shot me a look of pure disdain.  And, in stereotypical hipster sarcastic form, he exasperatedly droned, \"Sweeeeeeeet\" and threw out the contents of the Dixie cup.  \n\nI immediately felt bad about being responsible for wasted caffeinated goodness.  But, I reminded myself, I'd been waiting at least 15 minutes and I had paid more than usual.  It was fair of me to insist on being served what I had ordered!  Just as I was reassuring myself, I noticed that Mr. Barista was pouring soy milk into my chai *again*!  He pushed my Dixie cup towards me and immediately busied himself with the next drink before I could protest.\n\nIn the end, the chai was excellent.  I usually do not like the taste of soy in my coffee/chai, but I guess there are always exceptions.  If it weren't for the unreasonably long wait and shoddy customer service, I might even be convinced to return to Ritual Coffee and upgrade to a normal sized paper cup.  But I just can't convince myself to patronize a place where I was so blatantly disrespected and dismissed.  Maybe things would be different if I owned an ironic vintage t-shirt or two.  Maybe not.", "author": "Jessie R."}

It's hard to find stronger, more full-bodied coffees than the ones you'll find at Ritual, and it's comforting to know that the sources of their bean supplies harvest them in ways that are ethical in trade to the farmers.\n\nThumbs Down: The occasional rude hipster working the counter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-13", "description": "Ok, so this is a tentative four star review.  Tentative because I've only been here twice, and don't want to get too far ahead of myself.  Truthfully, based on those two experiences I'm actually fully inclined to give Ritual a five star review - however, I take coffee very seriously, so instead I show a little restraint.  The true test will be when I buy a pound of their coffee to prepare at home and try a shot of their espresso - which I haven't done yet.\n\nAll of that said, people who know me know that I take my coffee very seriously.  Until I tried Ritual I honestly haven't found any coffee roasters in the city that I felt comfortable describing as much more than slightly above average.  \n\nThere are so many bad coffee roasters in the city I started dropping my standards (if you are a coffee roaster and you only offer dark roasts - I'd automatically award you one star without trying your crappy dark roasts).  I've actually gone as far as to regularly have coffee from my favorite coffee roaster, Boston Stoker Coffee (ironically not based from or located in Boston), mailed to me from the Midwest.  \n\nHere is where Ritual has so far gone very very right (and why I suspect I'll not need to have coffee mailed to me from the Midwest anymore):\n\nOn my first trip to Ritual I merely had a cup of drip coffee.  It was excellent - not too acidic, a slightly nutty taste, and a nice smooth taste.  I was impressed.  \n\nOn my second trip to Ritual I ordered a cafe au lait.  In my opinion, a cafe au lait is a very subtle drink, and easily (and often) fucked up by crappy barristas (which constitute 90%+ of the barristas in the city).  For example, if you have ever sat the pitcher of milk on the espresso machine and walked away while frothing milk - you are a crappy barrista.  Here the milk was frothed with care (not scorched),  the drink was poured properly, and a nice interesting design was left on the surface of the foam.  The drink itself?  Perfect.  Honestly, this was the best cafe au lait I've ever had including those I've made for myself.  \n\nAnyways, I've not spent any time hanging around Ritual - so I can't and won't review the WiFi, the interior, the ambiance, etc.  Honest truth is that even if the floor was covered in feces and urine and enraged simians attacked unsuspecting customers with AIDS covered, rusty syringes at the door - I'd brave it for a cup of coffee/cafe au lait this good.  \n\nI suspect I'll be upgrading Ritual Coffee Roasters a full star after my next visit.\n\n[Edit: I went back last week and bought a lb of the Peruvian coffee that they roast - it is fantaastic.  Thus, Ritual has earned their full five stars.  In fact, previously, I was thrilled by the fact that the coffee was good, and my review had nothing to do with the place itself.  On my last trip they were blasting Beirut's Gulag Orkestar and later Neutral Milk Hotel - which would have earned Ritual a 6th Star if that was possible.

The greater issue is that some of the counter staff seem to think that I am out of place, as I have on occasion received very curt service. Just yesterday I went in and there was this very bohemian dude working the counter. A friend of his was in front of me in line, and the guy working did everything short of jumping over the counter to give the fellow a big hug and kiss. Ah, what a convivial guy I thought to myself. But when my turn came he barely looked me in the eye and was very gruff with me even though I was smiling and being very nice.\n\nIn addition, however much I like their selection of baked goods, my experience has been that the freshness has been very inconsistent.\n\nThe big issue for me as a neighbor is the amount of crowding that occurs in front of the cafe, often making it impossible to pass; and the amount of noise coming from these folks out in front -- especially at night. Now of course some of this is unavoidable in this kind of urban setting and particularly with an establishment that is so popular. But there should be some basic consideration shown for pedestrians just wanting to get on with their business, not to mention neighbors who would like a certain level of peace when they get home from a long day's work or whatever they been up to.\n\nUpdate: over the last couple of years the service has been on the whole more consistently friendly and hospitable.

I'm in love with the coffee there, and the space, but I can never just ride my motorcycle down there, and enjoy a cup.  I generally end up heading down there, getting something to go, and sitting sadly outside with it due to the laptop squatters that permeate the space.  My suggestion?  Do what the Victrola did in Seattle.  Turn the wi-fi tap off once in a while, just to stimulate good, natural ol' coffeehouse conversation.  It should also stimulate more turnover.

Quite squarely on the pro side are probably the best espresso drinks I've had in San Francisco.  After becoming accustomed to the slosh and pour method of drink making at many cafes, I was delighted not only by the sheer beauty of the drink (A nice leafy shape for the Mocha) but also by the markedly more rich and profound flavor that far exceeds any other Mission cafe.  There is an art and care to their drinkmaking here.  The drip coffee, on the other hand , is just fine, but Peet's drinkers will likely prefer their drip to the slightly watery (but still flavorful) mix made at Ritual.\r\n\r\nWhile the space is gorgeous, it is always packed with people, and the prospect of finding a non-ibook populated table is challenging.  Also, the open layout that was seemingly perfect before has been slightly tattered by a new platform intended for roasting beans, and the subsequent table adjustment doesn't quite work.  Some patrons may be a little put out by a passive waft of attitude from staff and regulars (where did they go before?), or by the music which is steadily getting louder, but it's worth it for the simply delicious drink, great room, and a cafe that has filled a great void in the San Francisco landscape.", "author": "Trent B."}

But I am, at least occasionally, and so despite by better intentions - and intuition, for that matter - I have found myself at Ritual a couple of times. The coffee is pretty good - certainly better than, let's say, Atlas, but that ain't saying all that much. I'd agree that Blue Bottle is clearly superior for that cappucino fix, and and AND I had SUCH a horrible bean-buying experience at Ritual the other day, everyone has to know about it. I was a bit delirious - but the cute little sign by the register suggested why not buy some beans with your coffee, and I needed some, so I asked for half a pound. I picked up my coffee and the bag of beans, drank up, and went home. \n\nI didn't inspect the product until a day later. OH MY GOD. What are they thinking?!?! First of all, this was a very scant half pound. But no matter, because I threw them away almost immediately anyhow. The beans were light brown and dry as dust, and smelled of old shoes and what might have been mouse turds. Who knows. They were so pathetic I simply cannot imagine how anyone with any sense at all would sell them. I like fresh, dark, black, oily beans that I grind coarse and put through the french press. These weren't even fit for gas-station coffee. \n\nI also agree that the place itself it far too much of a hipster sweatshop. When I want to work on my laptop in a cafe, I don't want a bunch of *other* people there doing the same thing. Sheesh.

The service isn't Starbucks smiley-face, but gawd, who the heck wants that.\n\nHad a clover of some Costa Rican stuff, and Kenyan. That's their terminology for a cup of freshly dripped coffee made from specialty fincas they're in touch with. Clover is the name of the machine that does this. It'll cost you about 3-4 bucks a pop. \n\nI myself am more into the freshly dripped stuff made by human hand. That said, it tasted somewhere in between auto-drip machine made and human made, so not too metallic, retains a lot of the various vegetal/fruit characteristics of the roasted beans, but not quite as much as manual fresh drip. They have about a half dozen varietals for you to try at once.\n\nDid NOT try the mixed espresso drinks, that's for next time. Gotta judge a coffee joint by its straight up fresh drips at first. \n\nHard to get seats here; went on a Saturday afternoon around 4 and the place was packed with solitary laptop junkies taking up entire tables. If it's full, though, don't forget to overlook the few tables by the restrooms in the back, luckily they're not RIGHT next to the restrooms, but sheltered by a corner and a hallway, so it looked like a pleasant, last-ditch place to make a stand if you can't get past the RoboLaptopUsers.\n\nNot my fave SF coffee place, but hey, not a bad place to kill an hour or two off Valencia.", "author": "Kevvy K."}

They took out the outlets so you need to go there all charged up. Seating is almost impossible on typical weekday and the music is too FUCKING loud! \n\nI've been coming here for almost 2 years to get my capp fix. The good part was their cappucinos which was sooooo smooth and carmel tasting, you almost didn't need any sugar. I'm a true coffee lovah and in my humble opinion, it had the best capp in the city. I'm writing in the past tense because the last 4-5 times I've been there, their capps SUCKED! Then I figured out it was because the girl who usually makes the caps no longer works there!!! BOO. The one with the bangs and the tattoos which pretty much describes all the baristas AND the customers but she was the dark-haired skinny one who banged the shit out of the bean grinder, packed the espresso tightly and pulled that thing to make that PERFECT shot of espresso .. and now she's gone! \n\nRitual- PLEASE train your new baristas better because your espresso stinks !

Before, the extent of my interaction with the stuff was when people left their dregs in our all-purpose hot-drink maker at work, and I'd notice that my hot chocolate had a slight coffee flavor to it.  At first it annoyed me; then I kind of started to like it.  I had mentioned this to a friend of mine who happened to be a long-time Ritual devotee, who mentioned that if I liked the taste of coffee and chocolate together, I might like a mocha.  I started out with single-shot mochas and eventually worked my way up to the full-strength version, which I now LOVE.  I didn't realize just how amazing Ritual's mochas were, though, until I started trying to drink them at other places.  At this point, I've had them at any number of chain and independent coffee shops, and nothing really compares to what I get at Ritual.\n\nOther pros - They roast their beans on-site (which I guess a lot of independent places are starting to do these days); you can buy freshly roasted & packaged beans of all varieties in the store; they have excellent  pastries (I like the bran muffins & rosemary cranberry bread the best); they have a cool art display, which changes from time to time; there's free wi fi; and all the staff seem to be really, really genuinely excited about making amazing coffee drinks.  Once the barrista even remade mine for me once because I vaguely suggested that it might not have been quite as good as usual.  I don't drink plain coffee, but every time a coffee-drinking friend or family member of mine has visited, I've always taken them here, and they've always been very impressed.\n\nCons - It's often very crowded, and there's usually a line.

The chai was extremely overspiced--like hot wings that are so hot, you don't taste the chicken.  The coffee was strong, and I love that they serve soda--oh, and please bring back the cranberry bread.\r\n\r\nPlace gets extremely crowded super fast by the wifi crowd, and the volume levels may cause you to raise your voice to have a conversation.  The wifi quality is good when you can get on--the onslaught of laptops may keep you locked out of the system, or sometimes cause the whole thing to shut down.\r\n\r\nPrices on everything are relatively cheap(they also have buy 10 drinks get 1 free punch cards), and this doesn't strike me as the type of place that will frown on someone staying from open to close.

Cappuccino was also a big surprise to me...better than the one I took every morning in the last 5 years in Italy and it also comes with styled foam (you know, those kind of flowery designs that you can make swinging milk cream while you pour it).

I think it was ten minutes before my friend got her espresso drink.  Also, they say \"french press\" but they actually press the coffee in advance and then pour it into urns.  When I get french press coffee, I kinda like to see the pressing happen and get a direct pour.

I don't like the fact that I have to work extra-hard with certain people to convince them that I am a decent human being, just because I am not some scruffy dude with a barbell through his septum. I am an \"inclusionist\". I loathe elitism in all its forms.\n\nYou may think that I've encountered all this BS at Ritual, but I actually never have. Oh sure, there are plenty of people here that LOOK like they might give you attitude. I've never been given any shit here. The servers have generally been pretty friendly. Maybe it's because I smile a lot and I'm generous. I dunno. Sure I've had a couple of service issues in my dozens of visits, but that was only because the place was packed.\n\n...That last paragraph refers to the servers, BTW. I can't really comment on the douchiness of the patrons. I've been given the evil eye here once because I was talking too loud, but generally people kinda keep to themselves.

The lack of an outlet cramping my work flow was one, while being sat near the restroom, which allowed me to catch a few lovely scents coming in and out of the revolving door, was another. The random mix of music was kind of headache inducing, but then I popped in my earphones and drowned it out. Beyond that, eventually a group of coffee taste testers set up camp right in front of me, making it fairly difficult to concentrate on anything else but their commentary on what makes for good coffee.

The reason Ritual gets 3 stars instead of more is the change in its business plan. When RCR first opened, it was a Coffee place: you drank really really good coffee, there were places to sit in the back in couches, you could read email, write that great web site, chat with friends, people watching, or generally just hanging out. It was great for PhD students who just wanted work in a place for hours and finish that darn dissertation.\n\nBut alas, no more. The new business plan seems to be this: \"We're a coffee roasting place and our main line of business is selling you bags of coffee, but we'll tolerate selling you a cup of coffee and give you a place to drink your coffee. Just don't stay too long.\" Evidence: they removed the couches in the back and put huge burlap bags of coffee beans, and equally important, removed all the AC outlets to prevent you from plugging in your laptop.

I didn't want much caffeine, so my options were limited. I'll try proper coffee next time I go, which hopefully will be soon.\n\nWhat was lost in my less-than-awesome chai was made up for by the wide variety of comfy seating and action packed atmosphere. The store was busy the whole time I was there on a Monday night (about 3 hours), but there was reasonable turnover so people were able to find seats without too long a wait. As you might expect for a SF coffee shop, I met a friend and discussed business plans / product design for a few hours. Its likely that at least one other group was doing the same, given the number of laptops on the premises.

So, if this is all there were to a coffee place, then we'd be at 4.5 stars. \n\nThe espresso drinks are well done and arrive as quickly as can be expected (a line is a line, and if its crowded, there will be a looong wait.). The mocha is exceptionally good if you like a less-sweet chocolate balance.The filtered coffees take forever...yes you can watch the slow, methodical approach they take, stirring each filtered batch as they pour...and hope none of the espresso drinkers slip around you and take the last seat...   So to recap: espresso drinks very good, filtered coffee very good, the wait can be a drag.  \n\nUPDATE:  I wrote a review about a year or so ago, that complained about how dark the place was in the back and how this, combined with the bright street light, made it pretty unpleasant to sit and work.   BUT the interior space is much changed now (2013)...its brighter, with better lighting, and overall much less bright/dark contrast..(i obsess a little over this because I think space and design have a lot to do with how enjoyable a place can be..).  So, well, I'll keep the old rant here, just so i can come back and admire my own writing from time to time, but i do feel that the Ritual people have taken steps to really improve the space, and i for one, appreciate the changes..  \n\nOriginal, now-out-of-date rant:  \"If you choose to stay, and are particular about the atmosphere and space wherein you drink your over-priced cup of Joe, then this place drops a full 2 stars. What works about it is that overall, its a fairly relaxed atmosphere...and overall that is a very good thing when drinking a cup, in my opinion.  Is the atmosphere pretentious? Not really..but the space, furniture and lighting are not expertly thought out and kind of a drag now that I think on it...because for a place that celebrates the ritual of coffee making, and coffee flavor, they should pay attention to the experience of sitting in the space and drinking the stuff.  Am I mad about this? - a little, yes I am.  Design and space is important.  So I'm just saying that the space, lighting and furniture, taken together, fall flat.  There is one big wooden table which is cool...that's it...and the individual tables, as actual single-stem wooden-topped tables are fine...what doesn't work: the really dark and light walls, against the bright glare of the street-side window is actually disconcerting if you are in the darker, back half of the place.   Combine these high-contrast light-levels with a computer screen and its kind of stressful.  The eye can't adjust to stark differences in light like this.  This is basic design lighting 101 - cut down the glare, even-out the the contrasts or the eye will be stressed and lose details.  Try sitting in the back and looking towards someone in the front - you feel like a Chilean miner emerging from the pit.  Also, everyone in the place is on a laptop, so one would think the place had enough outlets...it doesn't.  They should just go on Angie's list, get an electrical contractor and add a circuit with 3 outlets...why is that not important to the owners?  Everyone during the day seems to be diligently working...one wall has zero outlets, but 3 tables, and the middle tables are out of luck.   Its not trivial if you want to utilize the flow of electrons to run your machine called a computer...as you move towards the back, where about 15 patrons usually sit, the whole space is just...blah...there's a couch, with a half-sized table sort of in front of it, and the open back door makes the space feel like a forgotten back porch that dad will get around to fixing up once the kids are grown.

They clearly take their espresso drinks very seriously, with a rich, flavorful espresso and perfectly textured milk.  \nAlthough they're excellent at what they do, they're missing a few tihngs:\n- No syrup flavorings.  I don't really mind, as their cappucino is sweet enough on its own, but sometimes you just need a little flava.\n- No cocoa.  Same issue as above - their coffee doesn't need it, but it would be nice to have the choice.\n- No good pastries.  I've only tried their cinnamon roll and their chocolate croissant.  The cinnamon roll was almost inedible; the chocolate croissant was Ok, but it tasted supiciously like the croissants at Starbucks.\n\nIt's hard to complain too much, though - I go to a coffee place to get coffee, and they do that incredibly well.  Yes, it's gotten crowded, but they handle the crowds very well, and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for coffee (unlike the 15+ minute wait at Blue Bottle).", "author": "John H."}

Since I live in Soma, the walk is LONG (okay maybe not that long...but lets pretend that I have to trudge miles and miles through the fog..) and dare I mention all the window shopping I do along the way? \n\nBut at the end of the walk lies my reward of the yummiest breve latte around....served up by a stylin' barista who can manage to make the foam resemble a leaf pattern. How good does that get?? The taste is consistent the same every time, and itsn't that what you want from your coffee?\n\nSecondly, there are loads of pretty people to look at and as an avid people watcher, there is no end of drama, shenanigans and the like at Ritual...People work here, chat here, socialize...the music is great and you can just sit back, do homework...read...slouch or whatever. It like your living room away from home.\n\nJust make sure that you always get a \"to go\" cup because guaranteed you won't find a seat. I've come here in the middle of the week before during work hours and its still packed like sardines in a tin. \n\nClearly, this is the beating heart of the neighborhood.

My intent was to sample coffees from well-regarded coffee establishments that roast their own beans and prepare individual drip coffees. \n\nPROS:  Of the three, I liked Ritual's aesthetic the most and its coffee.  While, I didn't spend much time in the establishment, it felt large and spacious, and its decor was simple.  The red and black colors were a nice visual splash that played well off the wood.  The coffee I tried (I forget the name) was excellent, and I would return to sample more.  I love the individually dripped cups o' coffee; even just being able to watch your cup being made makes it that much more special.  Also, at Ritual, the barista was quick with my cup; I wasn't waiting an eternity like at Blue Bottle.  Also, unlike Blue Bottle, they offered sugar and all sugar substitutes, as well as different milks/half and half/etc.  Finally, the area where all of those materials were situated was wonderfully clean, which shows a level of professionalism.  I hate coffee chops were splashes of milk drops litter the counter, sugar's been scattered about like cokeheads OD'd in their powder, and scraps of Splenda packets or used stirrers lay littered about.  Ritual had none of this.  Well done!\n\nCONS:  Overpriced like every other place.  $2.50 was the cheapest and they went up to ridiculous prices like $4 and $5 dollars.  Does my coffee come with a happy ending or something?  It had better for those prices.\n\nStill, I'm glad I came.

The proverbial hipster cafe, RR serves a great cup of coffee and has good pastries, muffins, etc.  \n\nAn independent coffee house that roasts its own beans, RR takes coffee seriously - black coffee is served from a press pot and is not kept on a burner.  The upside:  you get a good tasting cup of coffee (i.e., not that burnt stuff from high-throughput coffee shops).  The downside (and it's a good down side):  you may have to wait two or three minutes while they refresh the pot.  Espresso drinks are made with love and are delicious.  If, however, you are looking for that tall nonfat extra hot no foam mocha pumpkin latte, you may want to go elsewhere.\n\nThe environment is friendly; the walls are covered with indie art; the music is fresh; and there are many t-shirts with ironic sayings to review.\n\nOn weekends, the outlets are covered to avoid long time computer squatters, which creates a lively community-oriented environment.  On weekdays, you'll find a multitude of iBooks with oh so down and out Mission-ites managing their iTunes Library.  \n\nCome for the coffee or the decor, stay to swap that rare Japanese import that had limited pressings and is no longer available on line.  Ritual Roasters is a great neighborhood coffee shop.", "author": "Paul D."}

And if I did, I would be ordering it from Central Coffee Tea and Spice. For this I am glad. I only went into Ritual because I was walking by and I had to pee. I understand that it is rude to enter an establishment simply to use their bathroom so my baby ordered a macchiato while I relieved myself.  I ended waiting, I kid you not, ten full minutes for the bathroom. I was the only one in line! Well, I was the first one in line. In the minutes to follow I was joined by three more people, all with hands in pockets, trying their damnedest not to look like they were trying to not  look cool. Finally the kid in the bathroom emerged and had the nerve to give me a dirty look as he oh so carelessly brushed his perfectly messy, hipster bangs away from his sleepy \"I'm-a-free- thinker-who- doesn't- give- a- crap- about- you-\", eyes. If I hadn't had to go so bad, I might have taken the time to kick him in the shins. \n When I finally made it back to MC he was JUST ordering his drink. MC asked Mr. Mustache behind the register if he could be sure and make the drink to-go. Now, MC does the coffee thing for a living as well. He knows what a good cup of coffee should taste like. However, Mr Mustache begins to \"strongly urge\" MC to enjoy the coffee 'for here' because if he did it to-go it would change the temperature and therefor alter the delicate flavor of the drink. I'm sorry - did we ask you for a glass of Opus One in a paper cup? Did we ask for 20yr old scotch in Styrofoam? No - it's a CUP OF COFFEE! After the bathroom situation, I was ready to throw down, but MC politely asked, again, if he could just have the coffee to-go. Mr Mustache looks all annoyed, grabs a to-go cup and hands it over to Mini Mr. Mustache, letting him know, \"This guy would like his macchiato TO-GO\" Mini Mr. Mustache smirks and the two share a quiet giggle. The macchiato is made and handed over. Oddly, everyone else's paper cup had their drinks written on them in sharpie. Single decaf latte. Soy chai. Double Capp w/ xtra foam. MC's macchiato? A broken heart! If that's some sort of inside hipster joke that the Mustache Twins came up with over discussing the molecular structure of their ultra fine Arabian mocha sunani, they can just BITE ME!\n Ritual blows. \n And really dude, handle bar mustache and overalls really only looks good on the 68 yr old farmer from Arkansas.

Everywhere you look, people dressed in black outfits stare slack-jawed into the soft, luminous glow of their LCD displays while they do everything from compiling source code to cruising Craigslist.org for a new significant other.  Alas, the culture of any coffee shop lies somewhere on a scale that has unbridled interaction at one end and introverted solitude on the other.  You don't need much more than a quick look around to fathom where this place sits within the spectrum of human engagement.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you notice? Ordering something here can be downright complex.  Think the \"Short, Tall, Grande, and Venti\" system at Starbucks is a little whacked?  Try ordering a cup of decaf here.  To be fair, I'm a creature of habit...used to going to Martha's on 24th street, handing them my Nissan stainless mug, saying \"decaf\", and being outside on the bench browsing the headlines within two minutes. Heck, even Starbucks can process this simple request. Try the same thing here, and you'll find that ordering coffee at Ritual is infinitely trickier.\r\n\r\nThe six people in front of you seem to have some odd request or peculiar need that circumvents the ordering of normal coffee.  See the short line that any self-respecting crew of Starbucks baristas can chew through in nothing flat? Here, it does anything but move quickly.  When it's my turn, I hold out my stainless mug and say \"decaf\".  The person behind the counter looks at me like I'm a caveman that just walked into Gary Danko, sat down, and grunted \"food\" to the head waiter.  She tells me that \"We don't brew decaf...we can only do a decaf Americana\" and asks if I would \"Like a double\".  First off, I haven't the foggiest clue what an \"Americana\" is. Secondly, I've heard of ordering a double at a bar...but not at a coffee shop.  I decline on the \"double\", and after a 5-6 minute wait I finally get my mug back....half full with \"Decaf Americana\". It was more expensive than filled-to-the-brim at Martha's, so I can only speculate that filling the thing would have cost more than a rolling-pin sized Burrito on the other side of Mission street.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I finally get my cup of coffee and start scouting out a place to sit, gently weaving through the sea of downward-gazing faces, all captivated by web pages and oblivious to my presence.  I normally wield a black-belt-in-chitchat when I go out for coffee, but after looking around at the zombie-like faces at Ritual, I quickly conceded and tapped out, retreating in abject defeat to a well-lit window spot shunned by the shade-seeking laptop users.  Outside of the trendy background music and the intermittent hiss of the espresso machine, the silence is eerie....and punctuated only by an occasional cell phone ring followed by a muted \"Hello\".  Sitting down I perused the headlines and compared myself to the crowd and thought to myself, \"A newspaper...how quaint\".\r\n\r\nIf this is your scene, by all means check it out.  Unlike allot of morning-centric coffee shops, this one has a crowd in it from dawn till dusk, and it's decor, layout, and atmosphere are *truly* unique in Northern California. And while it's not my scene, I'm thankful for it's presence, for it gives reclusive laptop users dressed in black outfits and pointy-toed shoes a place to congregate, isolating the burden of their presence from the rest of the coffee drinking world.  But if you find yourself irked by terms like Macciato, Frappachino, and Americano, consider this place best avoided....and meet me sans-laptop on the bench at Martha's on 24th street to soak up the sun and chat up the locals...", "author": "Mike W."}

Man up and ask someone sitting at a 4-top to use one of the extra seats.\nThe baristas are rude? Have you ever tried to talk to a line cook while in the kitchen? They are creating something, don't expect them to massage your delicate ego. If you want to have your ass lapped like a bowl of milk, its not gonna happen. They are efficient and get you great coffee, but if what you are looking for is a relationship and not coffee, maybe you should try craigslist.\nTo the complaints about the \"scene\"..., its Valencia street. Is there a shop on this street that isn't run by hipsters? Its The Mission's uniform. If you are just cordial and read the signs telling you everything you are probably going to still ask the cashier, you will realize behind the tattoos and costumes, they are regular people. \nAnd lastly, to the idiot who gave this a 1 star review based on a friends experience, you absolutely defeat the purpose of yelp and should be waterboarded.", "author": "Casey W."}

You will never have Starbucks again once you discover this place.  I give it 5 stars but I think it deserves 6 stars.  Its a little too hipster for me in there (I swear on a Saturday morning, people are all dolled up ready to go clubbing).  Maybe they are all dolled up because they haven't gone to bed yet.  But despite the occasional overly trendy crowd in there, the coffee is so good I will wait in line in the rain for that coveted cup of lovely.  Wi Fi in there too, and delicious donuts.

Don't tell my editor I was here...\nAs I've mentioned before, I spend what little free time I have interning at Performer.  A few weeks ago I made the fatal mistake of noting that I liked it when she \"sent me on field trips\".  At that time, she had only ever sent me to the post office down the street to send out trial copies to potential subscribers.\nSince then, she will periodically make me her personal pack mule and ship me out to brave MUNI and our famous transients (one tried to make me sing with him today) in the good name of posting flyers promoting upcoming shows we are sponsoring.  She usually sends me to two of the rockingest hipster hotbeds in the city - Haight and The Mission.\nSo, I do love to be out of the office, but what I don't particularly love is bothering people at their place of work.  But whatever, I'm the one that opened my big trap about \"field trips\" and whatnot so now I have to live with it.  I spent this afternoon marching up and down Valencia Street, badgering managers to let me distract their customers' eyes from their business just because I'm asking nicely.  So far no one has been mean, even though I keep expecting it.  People are starting to recognize me.\nAnyway, I very sweetly asked these guys a few weeks ago if I could post a sign in their window.  And they very sweetly told me the rule was I had to be an employee to gain Poster Real Estate privileges.  Whatev.  Today I was not expecting to be sent out as Performer Ambassador again and needed liquid courage.  This is where the review begins.\nUm, can we say best latte I've ever had?\nHipster, schmipster.  Yeah, everyone behind the counter has scruffy hair and a firm belief in sustainable living.

Both the coffee and espresso drinks are just phenomenal.  I'm a barista myself and I know a thing or two, but the staff literally puts me to shame.  They roast their own beans, every drink is made quality by the barista and the staff knows alot about coffee.  I mean, alot alot.  Like nerdy alot.\n   But honestly, I've never been in a cafe where I felt like the other customers were judging me by my looks, clothes and how many tattoos i had on my arm.  Ritual happens to attract that kind of clientele unfortunately.  If you need to concentrate on your work you should go to another cafe.  The music is loud, it's almost always packed, no tables available, there are no outlets (probably because the staff wanted customers to not stay for 4 hours on their laptops, and i can't blame them).

I didn't realize that working in a coffee place when you are well in to your 30s makes you really cool and that gives you the right to be an asshole, but apparently it does... My advice -- don't ever buy beans to take home, and if you do, don't ask for the \"darkest roast\" because you won't get it.  I think the person who gave me the coffee beans I ordered must have been pretty high if they thought that was a dark roast.", "author": "robyn s."}

I just read a few not so forgiving reviews that aimed an air of self-dejected insecurity and some kind of unresolved inner bitterness at life towards this cafe's crew and coffees. I, however- not scared off by mesh hats, 70's tshirts, rainbow hair, NOR career going yuppies- have no problem entering the premises, watching the popular crowd, and getting a kick out of things while waiting in line. The hipster happenings add to the atmosphere here, and unless you have some weird new-age issue inside yourself, why would you care what the person was wearing if they serve really delicious coffee to you? Clearly you would be reviewing the staff's clothing choices, and not Ritual Coffee the cafe and the beans. But.... whatever. See, I quite  like yupsters and hippies and yelpsters alike, all the diversity makes for interesting! ( oh but I do love the underdogs best, whether once from small town Missouri, or geeks from New York City ;)\nThe coffee is adorable here. I mean-  it is to be adored. The freshly stamped container is as well, but that's just because the cup and the people and everything just feels like analog versus digital. You know, Ritual versus your corner Starbucks. I am even one of the rare indie kids that is OK with the S-bucks, but digital tain't nothin like that warm analog. Coffee and audio comparisons. I like this! Ritual feels raggedy and real, and I love that. Each cup of coffee is carefully and royally french-pressed. Dream come true for me. (I miss Portland some days) I didn't get to try an espresso this time. But the baristas were really nice, and everything ran efficiently. The art on the wall's was my husbands favorite art ever, and the crowd there was entertaining. It was a perfectly lovely shelter from the downpour. \n\nThanks, Ritual! You are as yummy as Stumptown coffee.", "author": "Adrienne S."}

Furthermore the decor and atmosphere could be tidied up a bit.  BUT most importantly the coffee - it is downright delicious.  As a long time barista, whose pallet was honed amidst the plethora of boutique coffee shops of Seattle - Ritual certainly is one of the finest cups of coffee I have had in my life.  So if quality of barista and bean is your barometer of quality - look no further than Ritual.

The coffee was tasty and strong but the flavor was not to bold as my fav coffee house \"Blue Bottle\" that is not a bad thing. The coffee tasted smooth to match its ambiance. When we arrived there the shop was having an art show and at each booth there was art piece to observe, nice!  \"Ritual\" is cool spot to explore for coffee plus they have wi-fi a standard all coffee shop should have if they want me to return personally. I rate this place 4 because of the great tasting coffee and solid environment. I advise to get the mocha very yummy.

Theres a spattering of small tables here for you lonesters, but the main table is BIG, expansive, meant for you to sit and MEET people.

It's geared to everyone and no one at all, so hopefully you'll pick up something new there.\n3) Great staff.\n      Not at all pretentious or snobby.  Go there once in a while, and they'll pick up on your name, your regular order, and stop to chew the fat with you when it's not too crazy in there.\n4) Fantastic coffee\n     Artistry and neat little cups.  Balanced flavor.  Good stuff. \n5) Cheap snacks\n     1.00 biscottis are a must.  Check out some of those bars they have some times. \n6) Laptop friendly.\n    Ah screw you, anti lap toppers.  Coffee shops are places of play AND work.  For me, they exist so I can work in an environment that's different from my shabby house and get a decent mocha.  I go there just to hang out plenty, but laptop friendlyness is muy important. \n7) Crowd.\n     Not at all angry hipsters, unless of course, you're an asshole : ) \nSeriously: It's usually 826 volunteers (great people), students running for a break, or just your regular missioners dragging in their bikes.

Copying the other upscale coffee places (Philz, my love) they are now doing by-the-cup drip.  And have raised their prices substantially.  Boo!  It took longer and was not the coffee I had become addicted to.  Motivation to try the other places in the area for my morning cup I guess.

I was going to give you a 3 STAR because as I first walked in one of the first things I saw was the pastries behind the glass and the little flies in there.   I still give the 4 stars for the overall presentation of a new school artsy coffee spot. I do appreciate the idea that this space was changed into the spot it now is with its artsy mission flare. \n I read  that they might be snobby about not having certain things like whipped cream, and at first I got a short quick answer when I asked if they make their own whip cream. \"We don't have whip cream\"  was all she said.  How about  educating me?    It threw me off a bit, but I didn't let it get me down and I hung in there and called the barista out on making us customers appreciate coffee without even knowing it's happening to us. She was cool!  I have to say that the help behind the counter was very nice and appeared to know what they were doing. They definately looked like they were in the fast paced work mode. Sometimes you just need to engage people a little.  \nSo ...I am on a coffee shop MOCHA HUNT and have hit up a few spots that have been mentioned on YELP!  I am looking for a certain taste.  I like the espresso to be fairly strong -so I can taste it- and so far have found that the chocolate used is also very important.  I give this mocha a 3.5 stars.  They didn't  make coffee art in my cup so I felt let down, however they were training a barista and that might have been what happened to my drink.  I sometimes trip out on the idea that the cheapest cup of coffee is $3.25.  it was worth the fun of going somewhere and trying something new. \n I have to say so far that Blue Bottle sits at the top of my Mocha Hunt, and I will continue my search.  I would go back, but not before I try Four Barrel, who happened to have run out of chocolate when I went in there??

Which is just sort of a long time. Also, I wish they had Indonesian coffees - they are all African and South/Central America (though they had a sign the other day saying Sumatra is coming).

As a buisness you want to turn a profit, yet the part of you that started a coffee shop in the first place wants to play loud music that you like, take your time and put out the best coffee in town, and if you make some friends and take care of your employees alon the way, then that is great. \n..............................................................................................\nInstead of those annoying \"friends dont let friends drink starbucks\" stickers, coffee shop owners should stick \"friends dont let friends open coffee shops that try to emulate starbucks\" on their foreheads. While being starbucks is \"lame\" being a mom and pop coffee shop who has sold their souls to blended drinks is by 10 times worse.\n\nThis is why ritual is great, its the coffee shop that you and your friends always wanted to open. Consistantly putting out coffee drinks that are the best i have had since i was in Italy. \n.............................................................................................................\nRemember, simple menu, consistancy, baristas commited to quality not customer service (i know you disagree), good music. makes a good coffee shop.\n(i know that this is america and the customer is always right, but i dont agree, sometimes the customer is a douchbag. did you come to drink great coffee or to make new best friends with the people that are behind the counter, and be seen by people.)", "author": "jeff e."}

I wore my sunglasses inside in an effort to look a bit cooler. I even considered giving attitude right back to any of the workers who were about to be rude to me. BUT, the first people I laid eyes on inside the cafe were a couple and their infant.  I though... not what I expected...maybe I won't be thrown out of here. Then, I got up to give my order and the guy behind the counter couldn't have been friendlier. He told me that his sister had the same name. He asked if I had a frequent shopper card and welcomed me when I said i was a first timer\n\nMy experience at Ritual was the antithese of most reviews I read. I thought the service was great (well, my latte did take a while ) and the staff didn't at all appear judgemental, too cool for school and were not bastards. On the other hand, my latte was good but hardly something I'd wait on a line down the block for again.", "author": "Michelle D."}

These folks roast their own, and they don't over-roast. The body comes from the bean, not the roast. I'm not sure if they trade direct with the farmers or if they do the \"fair trade\" marketing BS, but the beans are always top quality. Buy your beans here for your home-brewed coffee and give it a couple of pounds. If your palette is used to the blown-out scortched earth mouthfeel of Starbucks, you'll be confused at first. Those are \"flavors\" you're tasting. ;-)\n\nThe place: cool space, neat old roaster past the pay/espresso bar, always busy. The line is usually long, moves fast, and the short wait is worth it. Laptops are up and out, proudly displaying their OiNK homepages (oh wait ... curse you Interpol!!!). It's definitely been christened by the Mission and SF kids young and old as a trend-maker, so seating is always scarce. I generally drop in, have a double macchiatto and grab a pound of beans and split.\n\nThe people: very cool, unpretentious, most importantly: knowledgeable and excited about their product. \n\nWhere I'm coming from with this review: I'm not a coffee snob, but I really do like good coffee. Hell, I'll drink it from McDonald's if I really need the caffine. But I also have a pretty good palette and an appreciation for it. I've been schooled by my bro-in-law, Kyle Glanville, who's running Intelligensia's newly-opened Silver Lake storefront/roastery. He also ran the front of the house for Victrola in Seattle for years. (He won't drink it from McDonald's.)\n\nI think we're at a point where the Starbucks \"third place\" business model that has brought coffee up to middle-class luxury item has peaked (a couple of years ago, actually). We're now at a point where coffee can move into a new phase, and companies like Intelligensia, Ritual, Stumptown and a few others who are sourcing and roasting small, select batches of beans are leading the way.\n\nBottom line: check these guys out. Best coffee in San Francisco.", "author": "Dave C."}

You've been warned.  The usual weekend experience at this coffee shop involves waiting in a long line, sometimes 15 or more minutes for your caffeine fix.  Inside the cafe, you'll find yourself in a sea of lap tops and tapping your foot impatiently.  Try not to be a crabby McCrab face.  Good things come to those who wait.  The folks here are hardworking.  I enjoy the cappuccinos and the jasmine tea.  Ritual is kid-friendly.  I brought some little kids to the shop and on one occasion, a circus-loving barista balanced a stool on his chin to entertain the kiddos.  They really loved it.

What the hell is going on? Is the theory that the longer I wait for a great tasting espresso, the more I'll appreciate the effort it took to make it? I'd love to stop in more often, but the saying between my biz partner and myself as we're driving by Ritual goes something like... \"Quick coffee?

Before I start of this review, I should note that I'm one of those people who's perfectly ok with coffee that is made in a streetside cart, as long as there's enough sugar and milk. I don't care if the beans were grown in a backyard in Brooklyn or the steppes of Central Asia; if there's enough sugar, milk, and caffeine in there we're good. In other words, I'm not a coffee snob, I recoil in horror at the complexities of an expresso machine, etc.\n\nI'm also not a hipster. My jeans tend to fit, my bike has nearly 20 gears, and while I own a MacBook I'm not a freelancer of any kind.\n\nBUT. I loved this place. I walked in and there was a crazy sign about how the barista was a guest barista from somewhere else and he had just won the barista championships of the galaxy or something, so I was intimidated and quaking in my flip flops. Every single person in the place had a Mac. I get up to the counter. \"Uh, can I get a cup of coffee, small, please?\"\n\nAt this point I cringe, waiting for the sure-to-follow condescension to rain down upon me. \"Coffee? From which continent? Would you like whole, skim, vegan, soy, foam? And small? Do you mean tall/skinny/short?\" \n\nBUT no. The guy goes \"sure, no problem. Anything else?\" I'm amazed. I decide I want a latte, something I'd never order. (The coffee was for someone else.) \n\nA few minutes later I get an incredible cup of coffee and a wonderful looking latte with a leaf pattern in the foam. Most amazing of all was that I really liked the latte, even though I didn't put sugar in it. I could taste the coffee...and it was GOOD. Amazing. \n\nSo...long story short: five stars for being not-douchebags, and for having really good coffee. I might just become a coffee snob with this place.", "author": "Vivek T."}

Or maybe I'm getting it wrong and RCR came first. In any event, as I was in the area, I decided to give it a try. The ambiance is hands down, fantastic. How can you beat comfy leather couches, coffee tables stacked with the Chronicle and the Guardian, big bags of coffee beans in the back, and a gigantic coffee grinder! And more than enough wooden picnic style tables filled with a smattering of the local hipsters, their fixies lined up outside to prove it. At 10:15 on a Saturday, there was definitely a line, and I almost left thinking that I am beyond lines and won't put up with over hyped places. However, this line moved rather quickly, and within 5 minutes I was already placing my order, which was of course, the standard soy latte. The interesting thing about RCR is that their small is really incredibly small. Maybe a 5 oz cup, and I am used to a small latte being around 8 oz. So I asked if I could get a single shot in an 8 oz cup- I think they charged me more, but in any event that is how they get you money wise (don't be fooled thinking you are getting a regular sized small for 2.65, it ain't gonna happen). I waited by the counter and watched intently as they prepared my drink. These people are trying hard to be like Blue Bottle with their milk swirling artistry. However, I don't think they have it down just yet. The coffee was good, probably not as good as Blue Bottle, but I would definitely come back, just for the comfortable and relaxed coffee drinking atmosphere.", "author": "Kate A."}

The staff is friendly, the drinks and snacks are good (and well priced), they're open late, and there are a number of well-placed power outlets.  This is probably why it's so packed.\r\n\r\nThe people that go there are another story.  Let me tell you about tonight's experience.  It's totally packed.  So, my friend and I squish in at a large table in the back.  There aren't seats next to each other, we plan to sit across from each other.  I leave to buy us drinks.  As my friend inquires about the status of a seat with a purse in it, the woman who owns the bag snaps \"what, the internet won't work on that side of the table?\"  Beotch (and my friend didn't even have a computer!!).  My friend replies, \"my friend is sitting here, and that's the only other available chair in this cafe.\"  The woman rolls her eyes and moves her purse.  Then later she makes some comment about how there are too many people on her side of the table (\"why are there 6 people on this side of the table and only 2 on the other side?\" -- the split was more like 4 and 3) and insists that my friend move to the other side.  Honestly, if she weren't so scraggly i would've taken her out.  But i kinda felt bad for her.\r\n\r\nSo, when another table opens, we move.  At this new table, we're squished, but we're happy.  More or less.  \r\n\r\nI understand that when you're at a cafe, you can expect people to read your stuff.  But i don't expect people to comment on it.  I mean, maybe they're trying to make new friends or something, but really.

These people really know what they're doing and take the time to make sure each drink is made perfectly (as can be seen from the way they expertly pour the foam to make those cute little heart shapes in the cup). Their espresso is delicious and the foam in their lattes is always nice and creamy, even when ordering non-fat milk. They also have a small selection of teas which is a nice option for non-coffee drinkers (unlike the snobby and inferior Four Barrel).The service is excellent and no where near as pretentious as other local coffee shops (four barrel, blue bottle, philz).

The latte's are awesome.  No, I'm not some kind of coffee geek, in fact, I'm probably everything these \"hipsters' hate but will one day themselves become.  I'm in a number of investment partnerships and end up traveling to a number of great places around the world  both work and pleasure and can say most often, I'm spoiled to find good coffee, albiet unique to that countries taste and culture.  But, I've always been able to order my Latte as I like it, with a pack of Equal or some local artificial sweetner on hand.   Ok, I know it' an \"unnatural\",\" not substainable\" chemical but this is how I like it.   And, I can say I'm amoung the millions of people, (some quite intelligent, educated, successful and well traveled) who take their coffee to their own taste.\n\nSo, here is the deal, it's a lovely Saturday over the 4th of July weekend and we're looking for some landscaping plants to add to our home in Napa.  I order my usual, \"non-fat, coffee latte with one Equal.  The barista, named Keith, said he wouldn't make it that way for me.   I ask why, and he tells me he wouldn't because the equal would ruin \"his\" coffee.  Now, I can understand the gentleman takes pride in his work but I'm really quite interested in why it matters to him since I will be the one drinking the coffee, notwithstanding I'm paying for it.  He tells me \"it's complicated\".  He tells me he's \"a barista\" and he just won't make coffee in any way he thinks sucks.   To be honest, I was quite taken back, not that I couldn't put my discusting  chemical in my coffee (which I did after the fact,) but that I found it so counter intuitive that this person could make and serve such a good cup of coffee but the service and insulting attitude would ruin the whole experience.  Remeber, there is no essense of \"second hand Equal\" permeating the air and in the spirit of the Fourth of July, \"my latte is my business\" and I think there must some connection with our Independence Day and our ability to drink our Latte's as we like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-12", "description": "As far as coffee goes, this place is awesome. Their espresso is thick and delicious and they are superb latte artists. The baristas here really know what they are doing--I mean, they do regularly send their baristas to national competitions. The gripe about the long lines... here is the thing about Syneso and La Marzocco machines: The baristas manually dose the amount of espresso into the filter, manually pack, or tamp, the espresso, then WATCH the shots whilst making other drinks; and that's just the shots side. Places like Ritual (and Intelligentsia and Lamille in LA) don't use huge pitchers to steam milk, like Starbucks and other chains, each latte has its own little pitcher of milk. Starbucks and other chains have ingrained in people that three minutes is the max wait time for an espresso drink--but again, this ISNT starbucks. If you're in a hurry, don't come here. It's a gourmet establishment--you're getting good shit.\n\nAmbiancewise, if you like fixed gears, Mac books, and long, greasy hair, then you'll like this place. I don't like that stuff. The times that I have been here, I have never, ever wanted to sit anywhere in the shop. \n\nBut f!ck do they have awesome espresso.", "author": "Ryan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-06-17", "description": "On one of my frequent walks up and down Valencia Street, I joked to a friend that there are an absurd number of coffee houses in the area whose patronage depends solely on aspiring first-time novelists that care less about the taste of the coffee the venue provides than the availability of patio seating and wireless connectivity for their iBooks. As it happens, just a few minutes later I was directed to Ritual, and lo, Madame Irony made a well-timed appearance. On my first visit, I had a regular coffee, and thankfully it lacked the burnt flavor common to the dark roasts at many chain coffee shops. The coffee was poured from a French press rather than a drip machine; thus it was brewed using the coffee aficianado's method of choice and was served hot but well south of scalding. I've since learned that the coffee is always brewed in a French press and then stored in thermal urns; rather than continuously heating the coffee in the urns, each batch is discarded and replaced with a freshly brewed one every twenty minutes. The espresso drinks I've ordered since that initial visit have been notably better than most and have had a rich, thick foam to them that puts the wispy froth one gets at other coffee joints to shame. The place is spacious, with more than three-quarters of the area dedicated to table and couch seating, and well-lit -- both traits rare to coffee houses in the vicinity. While still in its first few weeks in business, Ritual has quickly grown in popularity, and the clientele, it seems, is skewing hip and attractive, so it's on the verge of becoming a prime people-watching spot. The bottom line, though, is that you can come for the coffee with the amenities being secondary, rather than the other way around, and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Eugene P."}

I would pay $1.50 for an 8 oz cup, chat with my barista and be on my way in a quick minute. you can no longer get an 8 oz cup, the prices were raised, and the coffee is not ready when you order it, taking up to 15-20 minutes to get your cup. This is fine and dandy for people from other neighborhoods that can justify spending $3 on their coffee everyday. Many people who pay rent in this neighborhood can not justify $3 for a cup. This new change in policy now supports people with more money from other neighborhoods coming into this neighborhood and spending more money than we have, further gentrifying the mission. I understand this is the reality of what is happening to valencia st. I defended ritual for years for supporting the average joe, but now i brew my own coffee. I just want people to be conscious of when they go to other neighborhoods to spend money from their higher salaries than those residents actually living in the neighborhood.", "author": "Veronica E."}

I went early afternoon so their was no line.  I walked straight up to the register and ordered my double latte.  Sometimes going to a coffee shop and ordering for the first time can be intimidating.  Everybody uses their own coffee language!  Tall is small, flat means now foam?, skinny means nonfat or lowfat?  Simply put I ordered a double latte and no questions asked the woman at the register picked up a cup asked me for my name and that was that!  As I began to pay I noticed my all time favorite coffee, Ethiopia Harar!  I ordered a half pound ... I was so excited.  As I got home and opened up I was a little disappointed.  It wasn't roasted very dark leaving behind the full potential that exists ... that rich sweet blueberry characteristic.  Nonetheless my latte was great (made with a cute little heart atop the perfect layer of foam).  Now I can officially begin my day.", "author": "Mark S."}
