They chose a different place, and so it went. Fast forward two years and we finally came here, tired and hungry from walking, for lunch.\n\nAnd I'm glad we did. This is now one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city.\n\nI've had Chinese food around the world over an entire lifetime (which is longer than you might assume), and I can conclude that Tenglong serves good Chinese food.

Only one other customer showed up while we were there, so service was prompt. I ordered the vegan sweet and sour \"chicken.\" The waitress asked if I wanted fried rice or chow mein with that, which I thought was part of the meal, like adding rice or something. In hindsight, chow mein seemed like a weird thing to include with sweet and sour chicken, but I was exhausted from travelling and new to the city, so I didn't question it and opted for the chow mein.\n\nThe sweet and sour chicken was delicious and, in the end, it was really good with the blander chow mein, so the flavors weren't so overpowering. The dish had pineapple pieces in it for the sweet kick and some onions and bell peppers as well. The chow mein was standard veggies with noodles, nothing special. \n\nThen the bill came out, and I realized that the chow mein was a separate dish entirely. I thankfully got two meals out of the deal so the amortized cost was standard for a relatively cheap meal, but I think it is incredibly bizarre that the waitress would ask me if I wanted an entirely different entree in addition to my first entree. Given the context of her asking, the chow mein definitely seemed like a side dish, not a new entree. The waitress was nice, friendly, and packaged up my leftovers really well, but who asks someone who has already ordered an entree if they want a second entree?", "author": "Elyse M."}

During the course of a random conversation, the wings debate prompted me to Yelp search for this Richmond District spot.  Curiosity motivated us to meet here for a weeknight dinner which became two a few weeks later.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n1) Dry fried chicken wings (2 orders) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=TbX0QsmvKaBFm66cG-8uTg) - piping hot, the skin was still crispy with a more sweet than spicy honey based sauce.\n\n2) Green onion pancake - not bad but nothing memorable.\n\n3) Mu Shu pork - nontraditional version that was heavy on cabbage.\n\n4) Green beans and fried tofu - again, different twist but this worked well.\n\n5) Dan Dan noodles - more westernized style with conservative spiciness, yet we killed this bowl.\n\n6) Mapo tofu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=5IEshbX0F7j6WPtw_YhvhA) - can be done vegetarian style, we opted for the pork version.  Great gravy for your rice.\n\n7) Eggplant with basil (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=K-6-tkkM6lnve5xgTC23Lw) - cooked to a perfect temperature, not overly mushy.\n\n8) Ja Jiang mein (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=AuET4E4JzlTRPdomf1JUTw) - using thicker noodles, this bowl was hearty with a good mix of ground pork and zucchini in a mild sauce.\n\n9) Hot braised flounder filet (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=PRnaYXurqdgHd28QinqXrA) - interesting presentation for filet.  Tasty sauce with a nice outer crunch.\n\nOn both visits, we were fortune in finding street parking within a half block around 6 pm.  There were only two or three other in-dining customers but they were doing a brisk amount of takeout and deliveries.  The hostess/waitress was attentive to our needs (filling water glasses, clearing empty plates) and friendly in recommending menu choices.  \nOh, by the way, who wins the chicken wings battle?  My personal alltime favorite was Yunan about six blocks up between 9th and 10th Ave. for those familiar with the Richmond District.\nHere, flavoring edge goes to San Tung, texture and temperature (hot) goes to Tenglong.  The scale tipper may be the long wait at the other establishment.  Food rates 3.5 plus 0.5 star for relaxed atmosphere and service; no signing in on the chalkboard here.", "author": "Mike C."}

While others err... just have wet dreams.\n\nMe? \n\nI dream of chicken wings (Yes, I love me some good wings!) and it reminded me that I never wrote a review for Tenglong. Open for nearly a year, Tenglong took over the Minh's Garden Vietnamese Restaurant. The menu looked more Americanized (Mongolian, Mu Shu, Kung Pao type items) with a handful of vegetarian options. No foblicious items like offal but they've received some hype over the dry fried chicken wings which many have compared to San Tung's. The prices are $1-2 higher than your typical Chinese restaurant but they do NOT use MSG which is a huge plus. They also service brown rice. \n\nThese days, I only go to Asian restaurants that don't use MSG and I find that most places are still able to create flavorful dishes with the use of herbs and spices. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case at Tenglong as I found the menu items we sampled to be pretty bland. \n\nWe started with the Sizzling Rice Soup ($6.50): http://bit.ly/1azLfWG which tasted like water. The veggies were nicely crisp as was the sizzling rice though. \n\nThe Basil Spicy Eggplant w/ Pork - $8.95 came next: http://bit.ly/1eEajQO. It fared better in the flavor department with chunks of perfectly cooked eggplant and pork bits.  It was more mild in heat than \"spicy\" but nothing that a little chili sauce couldn't solve. \n\nMy friends who went to Tenglong before were keen on their Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($9.50): http://bit.ly/1bPl00W so we just had to get an order of these. While many have made the comparison to San Tung's infamous wings, I didn't see the comparison. Perhaps we got a bad batch but the chicken was overcooked, dry, and didn't have an encapsulated crunchy exterior (soggy). Flavor wise, the sauce lacked a garlicky, gingery sweet heat and I didn't get that finger licking stickiness as I usually get with these type of wings. Crazy Pepper in Outer Mission does a much better rendition IMO and they also don't use MSG either: http://www.yelp.com/biz/crazy-pepper-san-francisco/ \n\nWhat Tenglong excels in is their customer service. The staff is incredibly friendly and all smiles here. A rarity. Food service was a bit slow for Chinese restaurant standards (15-20 mins wait for our dishes) but the owner apologized because they were busy with to-go orders. \n\nIt's also very clean at Tenglong which is another rarity in Chinese restaurant (*ahem Dim Sum King*). Parking is horrendous so Tenglong isn't quite a destination spot but a good choice if you live in the neighborhood and have MSG aversions. \n\nUmm, that is all.

It's a small thing perhaps, but yelpers often refer to \"typical Chinese service\" for places and it seems to involve no smiling, let alone a genuine welcoming vibe.  Here, the service is atypical, meaning very good.    \n\nEgg rolls (vegetarian) were very perfect. Freshly fried and served steaming and hot.  \n\nMongolian Beef was super.  Lots of brown onions, several green onions, and some perfectly cooked non-fatty beef again, served piping hot.\n\nEggplant with Basil, a vegetarian dish which is usually my favorite was less successful.  It was wickedly hot (temperature wise), but the taste seemed to largely consist of eggplant and the garlic and basil were unidentifiable.  This dish wasn't bad; it just needed something more going on.  Perhaps try it with the addition of protein (an existing menu offering).  \n\nIn addition to the smiles, one way I know that the service was great was the temperature of the food.  This was the hottest fresh-out-of-the-pan restaurant food I've ever had.  No waiting around under heat lamps here.  \n\nNow that I've read other reviews, I see that a don't miss item here is the chicken wings.

I was told that the food would be ready 20 minutes after calling. 20 minutes passed and upon walking into the restaurant, we were greeted by a nice lady. There were no customers dining and only one other person had a pick-up order but we had to wait an extra five minutes for our food. I'm not sure what the delay was but the sauce for the dan dan noodle was the last thing we waited for. The sauce was packed separately from the noodles so we tossed them together when we got home. Definitely a smart idea to prevent mushy noodles.  \n\nThe wings were meaty and flavorful but I felt that the sauce could have been a bit denser to really coat the wings. For wings like these, I like my sauce with the viscosity of molasses. The dan dan noodles were thick and the sauce was very flavorful but I was a bit disappointed in the few pieces of shrimps in the sauce. Both dishes definitely carried some heat because I felt like my mouth was tingling with spice while eating both items. If I was in the area, I wouldn't mind returning to have a sit down meal.", "author": "Maya S."}

I remember coming here when it first opened and now it's transformed. Although the space is pretty small but you know great things come in small packages.\n\nI used to always get their eggplant and pork/chicken, but I wanted to change things up and I got the wonton soup, dry fried diced chicken and Mongolian beef with brown rice. Christina (the owner's wife) is extremely friendly and helpful. The price for everything is quite reasonable and affordable. Food and tables is clean and well kept. Some people might say that they're \"slow\", just remember amazing food takes time and love to make. The delivery was never a problem for me it usually comes to my house pretty fast.\n\nI really enjoy how they have brown rice as an option; a lot of Chinese restaurants don't have it. My husband and I really enjoyed the diced chicken, super crunchy. Perfect for watching Netflix and munching on them like popcorn! Wontons tasted like the ones my grandpa used to make when I was young. The Mongolian beef was juicy and tender and smelled beautifully.", "author": "Kathy H."}

To be safe, we looked on Yelp to see their rating, and a lot of yelpers gave this place a 4 star rating, so I guess it must be good.  \n\nWe came here around 12:20pm, and the place was empty. We sat down and we both got their lunch specials. I got the beef onion rice plate and my boyfriend got the fried chicken rice plate, both were $9 each. The place is pretty nice, looks renovated compared to the other asian places we've been to in this area.\n\nOur food took forever to get to our table, I think it was about 20 minutes or more because I remember looking at my phone the entire time. When our food arrived, our food was nicely plated. But looks may be deceiving, when I took a bite of the beef it was super salty drenched with soy sauce. It did not taste like traditional Chinese food, more Americanized. I thought the rice would be better, but nope it was worst. The rice was so dry that I almost choked on it. I may be exaggerating but it was really dry. How can you mess up on rice?? I had to drink a lot of water to get the food down my throat. Compared to my boyfriend's plate, it was pretty much the same. Even though I was super hungry, I was not able to finish my plate. The food just didn't taste good.\n\nOverall, I would not come back to this place to eat since there are better things to try in this area.

They also cook big batches for the next potluck you need to bring a dish for.\n\nThe dan dan mian is quite different here as it's a red-colored peanut sauce with peas and shrimp mixed in.

Well... It was under seasoned and did not have a lot of meat. The shrimp was deveined and looked great, but tasted VERY dirty (read: tasted like dirt). Sriracha couldn't even scrub put the taste.

The square tables and the wooden chairs are solid and comfy. Nothing really fancy about the ambiance, nothing screaming for my attention.  However, there are a few unique artworks that were hung up. One piece of art that I found intriguing was a set of mahjong tiles lined up and framed like a picture.  Kinda of cool.  \n\nThe service here is impeccable. 3 different servers came by frequently to refill our water, added more warm rice in our container bowl once it started getting low (without us asking) and they checked on our table occasionally to see if we needed anything else. \n\nBeing the only vegetarian of my group, I was relieved they had several options for me to choose from. I selected the vegetable deluxe, which was delicious. The dish was made up of perfectly cooked zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, baby corn, bamboo shoots, carrots, onions, and green bell peppers saut\u00e9ed in a savory sauce with spot on consistency. The sauce was extremely flavorful, which brought out the life of every vegetable. Another dish I had was the spicy string beans with tofu. A little on the dry side, but the dish still satisfied the taste buds and brought on some welcome heat. The portions were above average and reasonably well priced.\n\nAfter the meal, the servers brought out some smooth vanilla ice-cream in a frosted glass.

Nothing too difficult. I also ordered broccoli beef and green beans and the soup. I received all of my food but the chicken fried rice about 20 minutes later. After the food got to my table 10 minutes passed and still no rice. I called the server over and asked if it was on it's way. She brought the rice over. Verdict? It was absolutely awful. \n\nNow now, I am too a server and know what it is like to have difficult customers, so I always try my absolute best to be pleasant and easygoing. However, I had to make a comment about the rice because it was extremely bland, the chicken had the strangest texture; like a mix between tofu and string cheese, and was disgustingly greasy. \n\nThis is where things went south. The owner or asian person in charge refused to take the fried rice off my bill even though I didn't even have a serving. I had a bite to try it because I was turned off by the smell. Not only did she refuse, but was the rudest person I have ever come in contact with in a restaurant setting. She said to me, \"It is chinese food.

However, yesterday our order arrived more than 30 minutes later than promised and the cost jumped over $10 when the delivery guy asked for payment.  The restaurant person claimed the $10 was needed to cover the sales tax - WRONG - the total cost of the meal was a bit over $50 so there is no way the tax could be $10 (nearly 20% of the bill).  In addition, the food was cool, not warm and not hot, so the delivery was obviously delayed (we live only about 6 blocks from the restaurant).  The restaurant did not apologize for the delay, claimed there was a lot of traffic (I could have walked there and back in less than 30 minutes), tried to justify the increased bill and the food was just not good enough.

The shrimp and smoked pork were good. The spicy seafood noodles were less so. There was only a spattering of seafood on top, which was mostly squid, and some cabbage. That was ok, but the rest was some relatively thick noodles which were somewhat bland. Overall ok, but not great.\n\nOverall, this place was pretty good but not great.

Yes, the Dry Fried Chicken Wings are on par with San Tung's, and you don't have to wait 45 minutes outside in the cold for a table.

We have an eight month old and they are always so accommodating. \nThe food is delicious! Every dish we've ordered has been wonderfully fresh and tasty.  The dishes are never oily and never too salty. These are my favorite dishes.\n\nDry Fried Chicken Wings- We have ordered this dish every time we've come here and always a hit. Crispy wings with a sweet and spicy sauce. \n\nBasil Eggplant with Pork- My favorite dish so far. Its just a perfect combination of flavors. The basil is not over powering and the eggplant is cooked perfectly. \n\nThe Dry Fried String Beans with Tofu -  The tofu are fried crispy pieces and a perfect compliment to the string beans. \n\nSizzling Rice Soup- delicious savory broth with shrimp, chicken and spinach. They bring the bowl of soup and sizzling rice to the table and combine them right before serving so you actually hear the sizzle. \n\nWe will definitely be repeat customers.", "author": "Maria B."}

It is a very pleasant and clean little restaurant.  We had a nice chat with the owner, Christina (she is from China, presumably that is her Americanized name).  Her husband is the chef in the kitchen, and she seems to do most everything else, with some help from her two kids and another employee.  Christina said that she and her family operated two different Chinese restaurants in China, but that this is their first restaurant since coming to the US about 7 years ago.\n\nAnyway, we tried two dishes, the Veggie Delight and the Singapore Noodles, and we enjoyed both dishes.  We also had a side of brown rice, which was unusually good.  Two dishes was more than we could eat, so Rita had the rest of the Veggie Delight the next day, and it re-heated well.  The dishes tasted very fresh and not greasy.  The owner Christina says that they will be expanding the menu shortly, and adding more vegetarian dishes, including a vegetarian version of their chicken wings!", "author": "Matt and Rita C."}

We were looking for a Chinese restaurant that wasn't too classy but was great quality.  Unfortunately, Tenglong Chinese Restaurant isn't that kind of place. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and local. I do not live in San Francisco, and it felt as though it was more of a small take-out joint for the locals around Clement Street. All the dishes we sampled at Tenglong were bland and mediocre. I was very disappointed. The food took a while to come out of the kitchen (15-30 minutes). However, Tenglong excels in one thing, even if it is not their food. It is their customer service. The staff is incredibly friendly and kind. \n\nTenglong is also very clean, which is a rarity in a Chinese restaurant.  Finding parking is extremely hard too. This is why I assume Tenglong is for residents of the area/locals. I don't think I will come back here.", "author": "Emmanuella Z."}

I had the wonton soup which had savory, not too salty broth.  The veggies were simple, and the stars of the show were the dumplings.  Bulbous, with perfectly cooked ground meat, they didn't taste frozen - I'm willing to bet they fill them before cooking, which may change later for expediting reasons.\n\nAfter debating between the pot stickers and the green onion pancake, the veggie option won (although I am of the opinion that when it comes to Chinese you can never have enough dumpling related dishes), and while most restaurants over-oil this entree, at Teng Long, it was good.  The curry sauce was just the right amount of spicy, enhancing the oft \"just okay\" dish.\n\nAmbiance was that of a typically modern Chinese restaurant.  Minimal yet practical decor, attentive service that embodies a more American mentality, yet some things never change - the family business vibe, traditional colors and plants.  These are the things I hope will always stay the same in these places.\n\nSome suggestions for the fledgling business - veggie options that include faux meat, perhaps a house made iced tea, and one unique dessert.  You don't see the last two in many Chinese restaurants and I really think it will give them an edge over other restaurants on Geary, for example.\n\nBut other than that...great first impression, Teng Long!", "author": "Lily E."}

Service was horribly slow, to the point where I thought they had just forgotten about our order.\n\nI've never had the San Tung wings so I don't have those to compare the wings here to, but I thought they were really nothing special. Not super crispy and meat was kind of stringy. I actually thought they smelled like stinky tofu, which was weird. What are all the rave reviews about??\n\nDan dan noodles were the strangest version of that dish I've seen. Since when did shrimp and calamari belong in a dish like that? The noodles were not cooked very well and the sauce was bright orange.\n\nThe rest was just mediocre and not really worth mentioning. All in all a somewhat unsatisfying dinner. I had to apologize to my dining partner for choosing this place.", "author": "deb s."}

We ordered a wonton soup, fried beancurd with stringbeans, shrimp with caramelized walnuts, chow mein, chow fun, chicken wings (both non-spicy and spicy), sweet and sour pork, cashew chicken, and mongolian beef.  My favorite dishes were the cashew chicken, shrimp with caramelized walnuts and non-spicy chicken wings.  There was a generous amount of cashews in the cashew chicken.  The shrimp with caramelized walnuts was nice because the shrimp wasn't heavily battered and the sauce was light and tasty.  But, the BEST part of the dinner was the CHICKEN WINGS.  Because I can't eat spicy foods, I tried the non-spicy wings.  The chicken was nice and tender and the outside was crispy and covered with a delicious sauce.  They are on the same tier as the delicious wings at Hot Sauce & Panko and San Tung.  \n\nThe service was excellent.  It's a family business.  The wife was very attentive and friendly.  Our teapot was always full.  The food was bought out quickly and efficiently.  All dishes were freshly prepared and piping hot.  The fortune cookies were fresh and crunchy.\n\nHowever, the wontons in the wonton soup need improvement.  The wonton wrapper was a bit too thick and chewy for me.  The filling was a bit sparse.  I prefer thin and silky wonton wrapper.  However, the wonton broth was clear and tasty.  The veggies were fresh and crisp.\n\nbtw, this is one of the cleanest Chinese restaurant I have eaten in in a long time.", "author": "Sherry C."}

The Spinach and Bean Curd Soup had a clean, peppery flavor.  The egg roll appetizer was good but a little on the small side. The Mongolian Beef was tender, and cooked at a hot wok temperature so the meat was flavorful.  The Chicken Chow Mein and Sweet and Sour Pork were a couple of notches above most Chinese restaurants.  And the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings was the Bomb. The wings and drumsticks were big and they gave nine pieces on a plate. It was so addictive, I could have eaten that single dish by myself. I would say the same and maybe even better than San Tung.  \n\nThe folks running the restaurant are very nice.  She refilled my water without prompting.  Very relaxed environment, plain but tasteful decor.  High ceiling made it nice.  The only thing I would change is the pop music in the background.  They should put on some vintage chinese music instead.", "author": "D L."}

I went here with my parents, brother and sister last Saturday, 3/30/13 and the entire experience was terrible. First, they were severely understaffed - they had one server doing to-go orders, and one server serving the ENTIRE restaurant...which was completely full. Our waters were empty for most of the meal. Second, the food came out SO slowly... the dishes literally came out one at a time. After we finished a dish, we had to wait another 5 minutes before the next dish came out. We were planning to share everything family style anyways.. but it was frustrating to have ONE dish to choose from and then wait for the next dish to come out. The food was good enough - but anyone who's actually eaten at an authentic Chinese restaurant in SF can tell you that it's overpriced for the portion size, and too way salty. We saw the same menu items at China First for $3 less (I've never been there, just saying).\nWe ordered\n1) Eggplant Chicken - too salty\n2) Mushu pork - alright\n3) Wonton soup - alright\n4) Pepper beef - way salty\nand something else. Whatever it was, it wasn't memorable because I can't remember what it was.", "author": "Sarah H."}

Also when I call in an order and pick it up,its always ready in 15 minutes,which is wonderful. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I've had a couple of awkward experiences with the delivery guys regarding tipping. I paid and tipped on my card once and when delivery dude showed up,he acted kind of weird when I didn't give him a cash tip. I explained that I'd included his tip on my card and seemed annoyed and I found that off putting. Other time,I wanted to give 3.50 tip and the guy got pissed that I wasn't giving him $5.

I asked if that mean only 8 tiny tofu strips with the dinner - and was told it did!  Not adequate.\nA friend and I returned to try some other dishes.  Both were unsatisfactory.  The fried rice plate didn't have enough rice, but it did have large chunks of broccoli and cabbage.  Lacking were any other vegetable, and it was very bland.  In addition, we ordered the tofu, nuts and broccoli.  It did not look like the photo on the menu - it had  more large chunks of broccoli, not enough fried tofu or nuts.  The waitress did not warn us when we ordered that that fried rice was also heavy on the broccoli -  we really had more of a broccoli meal with little variety.

We were at the DeYoung museum for the Dutch Master's exhibit and wanted to have a nice lunch before heading back to Half Moon Bay. This restaurant was not far and we managed to find a parking spot within a block (wow! on a Sunday afternoon)... The food was very tasty, sauces were delicate, and dishes were piping hot when delivered! Nothing we got was overly oily, in fact quite the opposite, the cooking oil was almost undetectable. We had pot stickers-great taste and texture, the prawns in lobster sauce was loaded with prawns and the sauce was delicate and delicious, the jasmine rice was cooked just right, and I had the vegetable dish [they even adjusted the dish to exclude one vegetable I really don't like] and the vegetables were so good I manage to clean the plate.

I had observed lately there was renovation going on inside this location, which was previously a Vietnamese restaurant. I was surprised to find it reopened so soon by a new owner/chef.  For lunch I ordered their Beef with Green Onions, with a big scoop of steamed rice. The order also came with a cup of very tasty hot & sour soup, and a complimentary egg roll. The large portion of beef was very tender and juicy, stir fried with green onion, white onion and minced garlic, with just the right amount of delicious sauce. I could tell right away that it was good quality beef. I think Teng Long's Lunch Specials are amazing. I could see 20 different lunch plates, each comes with soup and rice like the one I ordered, all ranging from $8.50 to $9. Their style of cooking is quite diversed, both Mandarin, Cantonese and some Sichuan flavors, all great for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. Their new decor is tastefully done and clean. The waitststaff is attentive and courteous. This was only my first dining experience at Teng Long and I found it very satisfying!", "author": "J L."}
