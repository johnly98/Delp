This place is nothing fancy, but has a very homey vibe which I love. \n\nAfter browsing the menu for a bit, I opted for the 2 pupusas (chicken with cheese) and the 1/2 bowl of chicken soup. My friend got the same as I did, except he got the menudo soup and the la pupusa locas!\n\nOur food came about 20 minutes after ordering, and both pupusas were just alright. Nothing too special and extremely cheesy - a little too much for my liking. Between the two, my favorite was the simple chicken and cheese one. The chicken soup however was really good! It was very flavorful and the chicken fell right off the bone! The menudo soup was okay, it was pretty sweet for my liking. \n\nOverall this place was alright. I wouldn't make my way out here to eat again, but I do love how they're open late, so definitely possible I'd come back here for the drunchies.", "author": "Stacey Y."}

The pupusas had about 1/2 an inch of masa with no filling. A well made one will have a filling that is spread out. \n2. The salsa did not have a salvadorean flavor. It was more suited for some tacos. Pupusa salsa has a distinct flavor. This salsa was more of a Mexican salsa. \n3. The curtido again didn't have that distinct salvadorean flavor. \nThe place was clean and the staff were kind and friendly. \nWhile they failed on providing an authentic salvadorean pupusa, the food was not bland. \n\nThere are more authentic pupusas in the city and one last thing.

During my past couple of visits, I noticed that there were usually two staff working - one was the cook, one was the waiter/waitress. One time I ordered to go and my pupusas were done fairly quickly (but prolly cus they weren't busy at all). But another time, maybe around midnight, we stopped by to dine-in for some pupusas. There were probably four groups of people seated when we walked in. It took forever to take our order and make our food. One waiter managing all tables.. and one cook? Overall, the staff are pretty friendly and try to do the best they can to work with all the hands they've got.\n\nThey're pupusas are decent. I normally order the chicken and cheese for $5, which comes with two. Sometimes they're a little burnt, but I do love the cheesiness.

Unlike some other reviewers I've never had a problem with any of the servers nor the pace of the service -- although I only come in late-night, if that makes any difference.  They have a great combination -- two pupusas with rice & fresh-smashed refried beans for $8.95 or with half-bowl of one of their delicious soups for $13.95.  Actually, their chicken soup is outstanding -- tastes so homemade, the kind that cures colds!  They usually put a hunk of chicken (on bone) in the bowl with the soup but I don't like it that way so I ask for no chicken, more veggies. They have lots of other dishes, Mexican specialties, and great drinks both alcohol and soft drinks including Salvadoran specialties, particularly Ensalada de Frutas, an extraordinarily refreshing soft drink that has a ton of chopped fresh fruit in it.  Even their chips & salsa are great -- light, not greasy chips and perfect salsa with a kick.  Another great thing about Los Panchos: LATE hours!

The story goes like this, on NYE, a friend and I were responsible and used Lyft to trek around from place to place.  The next morning, I realized I did not have my phone.  Panic mode set in but I eventually logged in to Find My iPhone and saw that it was in Oakland.  Oakland?  I don't live and I am not in Oakland.  We contacted the Lyft driver, who confirmed I had left my phone in her car.  The unfortunate part was she was leaving for SF.  So in my car I go, Danville to SF, at a safe warp speed.  I get to SF, collect my phone, give the driver a \"thank you\" finders fee and I was on my way back to Danville when I drove past this spot.  I thought, man, that sounds really good about now, so I stopped.  I walked in and noted the place was busy.  I sat down, and ordered a chicken, pork and zucchini pupusas.  The server looked at me like I had just ordered one of everything on the menu and was waiting on the rest of my family or something.  He also advised me that there were two pupusas per order.  I was like, nope, we are doing this, so let's go!  When the order arrived, I tossed the cabbage topping on along with the vinegar and some hot sauce.  Boy, were they good.  They were all hot, full of flavor and fresh!  I made a point to take a few bites from all of them as I knew I would not be able to finish them (back to the looking for the whole family comment).  So I conceded and packed up the leftovers, paid my bill and left.  In all, the servicer was friendly, the place seemed like a local favorite and the pupusas were delightful.  That being said, I had my phone, a full belly and leftovers for the ride back home.", "author": "Sheryl M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-13", "description": "Picking the perfect pupusa is a perplexing predicament. Especially in a neighborhood as rich as the Mission. We should thank our lucky estrellas there are so many family-run pupuserias from which to choose as we pass by in our lowriders as wearing our bandannas around our heads like Rhoda Morgenstern. My personal favorite remains El Zocalo just up the same block. \n\nNow I've tried Los Ponchos simply because El Zocalo was closed for Mother's Day. What's that about? Who yo mama? Anyway, since we had a recent experience that bordered on dismal at El Patio just across the street, Jamie W. and I decided we should try this one, especially since they're the only ones that actually have a picture of a pupusa on their sign. Inside was a vision in formica and quite empty, at least at the beginning. There was a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" vibe about the puppet staged in the alcove in the back (see photo), and related Mexicana paraphernalia was all over the walls. \n\nJamie went all Salvadorean on me and ordered the $7.95 Platillo Tipico (Typical Platter), which consisted of a cheese pupusa, a fried yuca, a pastelito (sort of like a hot pocket), and a tamale (see photo). It was a full plate with some shredded cabbage on the side. I ordered my own $2 pupusa with queso and loroco (see photo) but went both barrels with the house special, the $7.75 Grilled Steak \"Los Panchos\" which came with a pile of fries and salad and hot tortillas on the side (see photo). Pretty OK stuff with the fries the actual high point. \n\nService declined but not because the waiter was at fault. For some reason, people started pouring in. Jamie and I have that butterfly effect on places (tongue in cheek) - but it was honestly amazing how the place was nearly full in about twenty minutes. The poor waiter had no other staff, so he was running around like a whirling dervish. We waited quite a while for the check. I'm thinking they may want to promote the busboy pronto. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid Salvadorean...no El Zocalo but no El Patio either \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...I think the puppets should start moving when it gets busy so we have some entertainment we don't have to tip \nSERVICE - 3 stars...started strong but dwindled when the floodgates opened \nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'm still going to see my Zocalo mamacitas but come next Mother's Day, well...", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-05", "description": "I've been working down a list of pupuserias in San Francisco and Los Panchos was the next place to try. It was lunch hours and fellow Yelper David N and I were quickly seated as the restaurant wasn't busy with only a few groups of diners scattered around here and there. The interior was decked out with checkered floors, green-colored wooden tables, and a colorful ensemble of Salvadorian and Mexican cultural artifacts that stood out from wall to wall. Upon entering, stood at the open kitchen on the left was the pupusa lady with her hands filled with masa.\n\nOur chips were served cold and stale which didn't give us the best start. I decided to order a Pork and Cheese Pupusa ($2) to complement a bowl of Menudo ($7.75). Thankfully the pupusa didn't come out thin, oily and crispy like the ones at Gloria's, but instead the bready outer layer gave enough dough to bite into with endless gooey cheeses that overlapped with small bits of pork to deepen its flavor. They use the same diluted salsa as the one for chips, and the generous bowl of curtido was crisp, fresh but the mild vinaigrette with a clear oregano taste was decent but a little flat than expected. This clearly wasn't the best pupusa I've had but there were some bright spots to render a decent experience.\n\nMy bowl of Menudo was fully loaded with tripe with ruminants of tendon and a small piece of pig's feet. It came with oregano, red peppers, and onions on the side along with three corn tortillas. The broth was mild but there were subtle depths of flavors and I was very happy with the generous servings. The corn tortillas were moist and some of the better ones I've came across.\n\nDavid seemed to enjoy the rice and beans that came with his choice of chicken and pork pupusas with cheese ($6.45). He particularly enjoyed the beans and cheese and thought the chicken and cheese pupusa was remarkably better than the pork version.\n\nService was large absent while our bowl of chips was not refilled. Being highly rated on Yelp, I expected more out of this dining experience. With El Zocalo just two doors down, I don't think I would be interested in returning. With the price on point to add to a set of decent dishes, 3 strong stars for the overall experience. Despite my criticisms, I still believe this is a decent neighborhood pupuseria but certainly not among the best of many in the City.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I think I originally passed on the offer, but I'm sure glad I changed my mind for it was a very good meal shared with Yelp Elites I had just met (Angelo F, Theron L, Sus.annah B & Tatyana K) and an old Yelp friend (Teddy B).\n\nPerched above the entry door there's a lady who watches over all who enter Los Panchos (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/0whJlEJwfqMYiow6Hz0XnA/l).  I thought she looked pretty cool up there, and I was thrilled that she didn't move because that might've freaked me out.\n\nOur meal started with chips and salsa, and guacamole was ordered too (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4vLIshFz2KD1EBA2NyJxwg/l).  The chips were freshly fried and not too greasy.  The red salsa was nice and spicy.  I liked the guacamole which was served on a thin bed of lettuce with a dollop of sour cream scooped on top.  The guacamole was mashed up smooth and had a really fresh taste.  I had a bottle of Corona while everybody else enjoyed other beer or sangria.\n\nWe all ordered papusas which probably made it easy work for the kitchen.  The papusas are listed on the menu as appetizers.  They're two bucks apiece with a minimum order of 2 papusas per plate.  Trust me; two will fill you up really good.  For those not familiar with papusas they are kind of like a thick floury flat bread that is pan fried.  The papusas at Los Panchos are filled with cheese and pork.  They were a lot larger than I anticipated (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/QcbSxrCJBQy0xXDpVTXzyw/l & http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/B5tx6b4oaVFJ9FKJ3tDcyw/l) and were served with the traditional curtido, a pickled cabbage relish.  \n\nThe papusas were very tasty.  I liked how the flavors of the cheese and pork blended with the slightly chewy dough.  The shredded cabbage was very mild in flavor and its crunchy texture went very well with the papusa.  The service was good and friendly.  In the company of a fun group of people it sure beat going home and cooking for myself.  This was definitely a very good meal.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It's a sit down restaurant with a order-in kind of feel (even though there is service).  I much prefer it over Taqueria Cancun which sits right across the street for a place to eat.  The service is a tad slower (because you are served), but it's better quality and the portions are larger.\n\nI had their carne asada burrito and I was not let down.  There was a fair amount of meet and the balance of cheese, guac, and rice/beans was just the right amount.

Los Panchos is a small, family owned restaurant with a very small, but capable staff. The day server is an incredibly sweet older woman, always interested in how you've been, and the night server is a charming middle-age man with amazing reflexes and a great sense of humor. \n\nOriginally, my regular order was two pupusas and a side of beans/rice, which then became one pupusa and a small bowl of soup, and is now a large bowl of soup and a side of beans. I've loved everything I have had there, and especially love the fact that the soup  ingredients are only added to the broth upon order. Fresh, delicious, and good for you. \n\nMy partner has been going there for as long as he can remember, as have his parents.

All of these pupusas had no flavor. Greasy! The cabbage was nasty also had no flavor. The chips and the salsa tasted old. May I add no one else ate the chips everyone left it.

But didnt really get bothered since my son loves french fries was surprised he didnt eat them so I decided to taste it my god it tasted horrible. Like plastic! Horchata was tremendously sweet had alot of sugar (eww) $30.99 paid for mothing shouldve went to the Peruanen restuarant next door then this garbage. BTW service was awful!

We came in sober looking for pupusas since El Zocalo closed down.  We  don't usually get pupusas here. Our favorite place is a lil ways down the street on Mission/Richland (La Santaneca--AUTHENTIC Salvadorean food)\n\nAbout Pupusas -- they're NOT supposed to be greasy.  They either fried your  pupusas or there is too much greasy cheese inside. Probably to mask their lack of ingredients. \n\nNone of us ordered the same thing. It took FOREVER!!! Definitely not the place to come to if you're hungry. Not only that, but the guy wasn't very friendly. We asked about their aguas frescas and he looked at us like we were stupid for asking. He answered us all annoyed. \n \nOne of us ordered chicken pupusas, another revueltas, and the only dude at our table ordered chicharron. The revueltas were super greasy and undercooked. The masa was still soft and moist. Gross. The chicken ones were also undercooked and there was no chicken in them. There was just massive amounts of cheese and little green specks. Maybe that was bell pepper? We don't know. We called the server back cuz we had gotten cheese pupusas instead of the chicken pupusas that were ordered. He was very annoyed saying those were chicken and he didn't believe us until we opened it up and showed him there was no chicken inside. He didn't take the plate back. He just left it at the table. It took FOR-E-VER to bring back 2 chicken pupusas. Upon inspection, it was the exact same thing as the last 2. The server seemed so annoyed with us we couldn't tell him anything. We just left them there. We were charged for everything. I usually leave a nice tip, but on this occasion i left none because of the shitty service and craptastic food. No complaints on the chicharron pupusas. But then again, our guy friend eats anything lol jk I tasted them, they were the better of all 3 kinds we  ordered. \n\nSo the verdict, don't come here if you're starving or sober. Probably best when you're drunk trying to sober up and probably don't care for good food.  This is FAR from authentic. NEVER AGAIN.", "author": "Jay N."}

I literally work across the street from this spot and I come in at least once a week. \n\nYesterday, I called in an order for 2 pupusas (my girlfriend and I had dinner plans, so this was just a snack to hold us over). I head over with my girlfriend and realize I only had my credit card, so the girl (her name was Karin or something) tells me that they have a $10 minimum and that I need to get cash or order more. I tell her \"sure, I'll just run up the street to the Bank of America.\" I tell her I'll be right back and ask if my girlfriend can start eating, and they say okay. \n\nI run up the street, grab cash, and run back to pay them. After paying for my meal, I ask for an extra fork so I can sit down with my girlfriend and eat. The girl sort of glares over at my girlfriend, then says that there is a minimum order of 2 pupusas per person to eat there. At this point, I start getting frustrated since I just ran up to get cash, but had I known there was a minimum order requirement (which would have brought us over the $10 minimum to use my card), I would have just swiped my card to begin with. \n\nThe restaurant was completely empty, so I asked her if we could just eat our food and be on our way, and she said no. She said we needed to purchase 2 more pupusas to eat there. At this point, I was pretty damn pissed off and I grabbed our food and walked out. I asked her if this is how they treat returning customers, and she ignored me and walked off. \n\nIt blew my mind that she treated us this way, especially knowing that I work right across the street. \n\nOh well, I guess it's back to Taqueria Cancun...", "author": "Gerson K."}

If they really knew Latin food we wouldn't have to ask for the sauce! Popusa come with cortido and red sauce.

Upon arriving there we noticed the hostess station was now outside in the cold and no one was there to greet us. As we stepped inside to get out of the cold we were asked to go back out and wait for the hostess to put our name down, we were not off to a good start :/ Once seated we waited a good 15 minutes to even be acknowledged and then told that they were out of carnitas, refried and pinto beans!!!  Really, a Saturday night and they are out of the essentials at 7:00pm! Everytime we go there we are told they are out of carnitas, you would think if this was such a popular item they would increase their supply. Worst part of all was that our drinks came out about a minute before our dinner and we had yet to see our appetizer. I went to the salsa bar to get some additional sauces and the majority of their bowls were empty!  Advice to Los Panchos, even if you are busy, at least greet your customer and bring them their drinks, and keep your restaurant stocked with enough supply to feed your customers. If I could, I would not have even given them a one star rating, it would be no star at all!

The first time I was there I ordered pork pupusas that showed up with only cheese but no pork. I mentioned it to the server and they looked at it agreeing they did not put pork in my pupusa. They remade my pupusas and still no noticable pork in it. I figured maybe they were just having a bad day. The second visit the same thing happened but this time the server (the one Latino guy who works as the waiter aka the owner's son) gave me attitude because I sent it back. He rudely took time to tell me that I did this the last time I was there. I had no idea he was keeping track of my visits. I am sorry that I am expecting pork in my pork pupusas that I am paying for! The third time I ordered a burrito. I figured I had a bad experience twice with pupusas so I'd order a burrito. I mean how can you make a bad burrito? Well came to discover it is possible at Los Pancho's. The minute I bit into my burrito I noticed there was no chicken in any of the bites I had taken despite ordering a chicken burrito and two bites into it my burrito, it fell apart. I was not drunk so I truly was not interested in getting messy with this tortilla that lay flat on my plate with a mess of beans and rice on it. I don't have high standards but I do expect that you put some care into the food especially if I am paying 9 dollars for a burrito. The gentlemen who is the server and owner's son was rude and continuously made remarks about me to the people I was with because I complained about the burrito. It is unfortunate that this individual has a nasty attitude because they are not caring for the food they are serving. Bad customer service and awfully made food. It is a local Latino business so I truly wanted to believe I could get past my bad experience and give it my business, but the awful treatment of customers who are not regulars and crappy food makes me want to give this place zero stars if  could.

I wasn't impressed by the service at all. There was ONE waitress and half a dozen people behind the counter cooking, working on the register and doing other things. I think they need to hire someone else. This woman was running all over the place trying to serve half a dozen tables full of families.   If you're really hungry and in a hurry, I wouldn't recommend this place.  But, if you don't care about the long wait in service and you're craving any kind of pupusas, then this is for you.

Perfect to sop up the booze after the Knockout or Rio, or just to enjoy a lazy afternoon lunch or dinner. Their pupusas are to die for, made by hand,  with generous sides of pickled cabbage, sour cream, guac, and any other toppings you ask for. I prefer the bean and cheese or zucchini pupusas. The shrimp was a bit off for my taste, but it may have been my palate that particular day as I was fighting a cold. ;-) The salsa is absolutely addicting and if you order to go they give you a vat's worth in what looks like a 12 oz container! I wish I could go more often, the prices can't be beat (the last time we went we paid less than $14 for three pupusas and they gave us two heaping bags worth of sides/condiments/chips to go.
