Went with the popular margherita pizza and chicken croquettes. \n\nThe margherita pizza was decent. It wasn't the best I've had, but definitely wasn't the worst. To me, the crust could have been fluffier and there was a little too much sauce. Otherwise, not bad.\n\nChicken croquettes were good, and they came with a cream dipping sauce.

Even though it was cold, it still had some flavor...\n\nI ordered a pizza earlier at around 8 or so, and was told that the pizza would take about 50 minutes to be delivered. Great, no problem, sounds like a standard pizza delivery time. What I didn't know was that the pizza wouldn't get to my apartment until well after 50 minutes (more like an hour and a half). While I was waiting I called the pizzeria wondering where my pizza was and they said the pizza left 10 minutes ago and was on the way to my apartment next.... After looking up the drive time on google maps, it says about 10 minutes between my apartment and the restaurant... suspicious.. Lo and behold, an hour and a half later, the pizza was delivered cold and the garlic bread was not much better. Also the tiramisu looked like it had been frozen, defrosted, jostled around in the box, and then frozen again. The date on the tiramisu box even said 2-18-18 (today is 2-22-2018) which means it probably was frozen and made on a different date. Pretty unacceptable if you ask me.  Upon sinking a fork into the tiramisu the middle was still frozen solid... which I'm not surprised.... after all, it said it was probably made or delivered to this restaurant 2-18-18....\n\nThe pizza itself was pretty standard imo.\nAt the end of the day, I would not recommend this pizzeria to anyone for delivery. Avoid their dessert because you never know if you'll get a frozen slice of tiramisu that's 4 days old.... Would not come back again.", "author": "Alex L."}

In the meantime, GrubHub has also called them. They call me to say that they pleaded with the manager and that he refused any sort of discount despite my order taking 2x the quoted delivery time. \n\nI get that things happen, that people get busy. I would have even let 90 min go and continued to order from them, but 2 hrs and $40 for a pizza that was warm-ish on arrival and limp and greasy, and you don't even offer a discount? In fact, you refuse it when the company you contract pleads with you to do so? A discount would have said \"We're sorry, that was a really long time to wait, but keep ordering from us, we want your business and it will got better next time.\" I would have continued to order from them.

When I called to find about the pizza, I was told twice that it had left the store 15 minutes prior and even that my order had been lumped with other order as it was inconvenient for the driver to drive to south beach, only to have to return to the mission after the fact.  When I finally got fed up I called a third time and was told by the dishwasher that it has left but there was nothing he could do at this point as the restaurant was closed. To make matters worse the manager called me the next day and said he'd \"take my word\" as there was no way he confirm what I was stating other than calling the driver after he had called me.  He also threw some bs about the possibility of the driver getting pulled over by the police.  Regardless I received a cold pizza, shitty \"courtesy call\" and a $5 voucher.

Not to mention pretty good reviews to boot on the new operation. I went for a mushroom slice and it was quite solid, nothing mind blowing but one of the better no frills New York style slices I've had in the neighborhood. Price is a little high at $4.30 for a plain slice, but the size was decent. My other slight knock was that they charge $.50 for credit card on purchases less than $9. Since grabbing a slice to go is less than that, if you don't have cash on you it's really not a great deal.

We made a reservation for this place for 8 people on a Friday evening. We arrived on time and the table was reserved for us (the one good thing that happened that night).\n\nOnce we were all seated, we ordered two bottles of wine and asked for glasses of water for everyone. They brought us our wine and glasses but didn't bring out the water. We asked again and they told us they didn't have enough glasses in the restaurant to serve us water.... We asked if they had extra wine glasses or to go cups to give us the water in but they said nope. They explained that the only option we had was to buy water bottles from them. I mean I think it's customer service 101 to serve your restaurant guests water if they ask for it. We were so frustrated that we asked to talk to the manager and he explained to us once again that they didn't have any water glasses left that they could serve us water in (like we couldn't hear it the first time around?!). Anyways, we asked if they could give us the water bottles complimentary and after much deliberation, they decided to give us THREE water bottles. Once again, we were 8 people and they gave us THREE water bottles with no glasses! I'm not sure how they expected us to drink the water, but we gave up at this point and just waited for our pizza.\n\nNow the pizza is a different story altogether. We ordered 3 large pizzas as soon as we decided because we were starving. About 15 minutes after giving our order, our server came around to us and told us they didn't have ingredients for one of the pizzas we had ordered. Did they only figure that out 15 minutes after we gave our order?! Anyways, we let that go and quickly ordered another pizza. When our pizzas finally came, one of them had chicken on it, even though we had clearly ordered all vegetarian pizzas. We told our server that this wasn't the pizza we ordered and he called over his manager who then proceeded to tell us that this was in fact the pizza we ordered. Another customer service 101, \"the customer is always right\". We were appalled that the manager told us that we didn't know what we ordered and that the pizza they brought out was the right pizza. Well, we ended up telling the manager that most of us were vegetarian so we couldn't eat the pizza and this was actually not the pizza we ordered so they finally took the pizza away and brought out the correct one. No sorry, no apologies, nothing!\n\nWow, what a horrible experience, I hate thinking about it or reliving it. It would've been nice if they took off the incorrect pizza from the bill or anything like that, but that was obviously something we could not expect after the kind of service we had seen.

We walked in and ordered.  We even changed an order because it would take too long.  We told them we were in a rush.  \n\nWe ordered a slice of mushroom pizza.The cashier pointed to the slices sitting in the warmer and said they will put mushrooms on the cheese pizza.  After 20minutes and after we complained we were STILL waiting for our food, the SAME cashier who took our order said they ran out of cheese pizza.  We saw them making our food after we complained and what would have taken 5-10 minutes, took much longer because they simply forgot about our order.  They gave away our cheese pizza to the people behind us.  \n\nRather than owning up to their mistake of forgetting our order, they mumbled some excuse about how it takes awhile to make the food, albeit they did apologize several times.  No discounts were given not any other gestures.", "author": "Tiffany T."}

I had seen the Baiano's on my way to work and suggested it. We called to find out that they have gluten free options. I showed up first, asked if they had room for 12, no problem. They started moving the tables around, while asking me if the setup was OK. Finally, everybody showed up. We requested separate billing for each 'group', not a problem. Pizza was really good, wine was good and affordable. Staff was helpful and didn't once show anything but great customer service with our rather noisy group :) One of the pizzas took a bit longer to be ready, but we were happy from the victory so even that didn't bother us. Very pleasant experience. I'll go again.", "author": "Salla V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-15", "description": "This was a delivery order. While our medium size pepperoni and mushroom pizza was OK, the Fettuccine Ala Vodka was disappointing for $14.95. The plastic \"to-go\" container it came in was full of water. This caused the noodles, bacon, and vegetables to be soft and waterlogged. While they separated the sauce from the noodles as part of delivery, the quantity of sauce was insufficient. Hoping we just experienced a one-off situation. At this point we probably wouldn't place a delivery order with them again.", "author": "Matthew D."}

There was not a button for sides so I told baiano that I would be more than happy to pay for them if they had a way to add it onto my order. He told me that GH would be contacting me about adding it and I let him know that was fine. I then waited hour and a half ( 15 minutes after estimated delivery time) then called to check on my order, and they let me know they never made my order! The customer service told me \"they can cancel my order and to not be upset because it's just pizza\". I had guests in town expecting dinner and it was so frustrating and embarrassing to be expecting an order at a certain time and to be told that their solution to the issue would simply be to cancel and refund and I could order somewhere else. Working in customer service myself for many years I simply told him that is not an viable solution. They offered me a coupon code for future orders and said they will rush my order as quickly as possible. I received my order approx, 30 minutes later, soggy pizza, clearly rushed and was just not good. Just wanted to share my feedback, disappointed in a company that I will NEVER order from again all because of wanting to charge for 3 sides or ranch dressing, which in the end was included in my bill.", "author": "Jessica B."}
