There are 2 bench seating areas, otherwise not much room.\n\nService was friendly and helpful. Overall the ice cream was on the sweet side but still distinct and flavorful. Very creamy and almost a bit too soft but they did hold up alright. I got the spicy ginger saffron and the employee recommended I pair it w/ cookies and cream. This was a surprisingly good pairing. The cookies and cream weren't too sweet so it mellowed out the overly sweet and nicely spiced ginger saffron. The cone texture was also great. They look very unique and have a lovely wafer like crunch. Taste-wise they were a bit strange. Almost cardboard-like but my friend and I both agreed that with some time you get used it and it becomes rather addictive.\n\nPrice here was also very reasonable compared to a lot of other spots in the city.

It's small and unassuming, but the ice cream flavors are superb and robust, while the consistency is excellent with that nice, creamy mouthfeel.

I personally love their espresso flavor, and the dulce de leche is DIVINE!!\n\nUnlike Bi-Rite, there aren't ever long lines for this creamery, the ice cream is smooth and creamy (not ice-crystal-y), and the prices are VERY affordable.  The only better ice cream on this side of the city is Mitchell's, but that's a 7 minute drive from here (not to mention a long wait).  \n\nThere is limited seating inside and out:  2 benches with tables inside, and 1 adult-height bench and 1 child-height bench outside.

It's nice to know there's a place where you can still even *get* a high-quality vanilla by walking into a business rather than being forced to order online. But Xanath is the vanilla expert! You can take your pick of all different bottle sizes and price points and choose between Mexican vanilla and the Madagascar (I think?) variety. And it's nice to know that there's still something unique in this city - that there's a business left in the Mission that actually has a little character. I *love* how make-shift their signs are - written with love - with great information about the environment and why eating ice cream from a place that cares about sustainability is the way to go! (Makes you feel good about having your treat! : ) And, just my personal preference but I also LOVE how the owner held out for many many months - maybe even a full year - with his gigantic, life-sized cardboard cutout of Bernie Sanders in the window - long after the election was over, let alone the primaries. I agree with the reviewer who talked about this place being the best kept secret in the Mission. It's ridiculous to see the long lines at much lesser ice cream establishments (at Smitten, where I went only once and that was more than enough, the 'ice cream' - if you can call it that! - wasn't even COLD!). The locals in the neighborhood know they can trust Xanath for delicious, high-quality ice cream at a reasonable price. (I think a lot of people would be surprised to learn that Xanath is using the same high-quality ingredients as a more expensive place but they just decided to keep their prices reasonable, which is wonderful for the long-time neighbors who aren't millionaires....) I'm also incredibly grateful to them for their sweetness to my little doggie girl who LOVED the taste of vanilla ice cream they so kindly gave her a spoonful of as a special treat when we visited.

While it did taste like a matcha green tea frap from Starbucks, the texture was gritty. I like my ice cream smooth and creamy, so this textural surprise wasn't exactly a pleasurable experience. Likewise with my blueberry scoop, I found it to be inundated with ice crystals. However, as a flavor, I thought it was pretty good.

She was equally stoked regarding the affordability (note: starting at $1.50 for a child-size scoop in a cone if you pay in cash) & local feel of the place and so we gave it a shot. After trying a decent amount of flavors (brown sugar banana banana, roasted almond, matcha), she decided that brown sugar banana chip was superior, whereas I fell for the caramel toffee. We both went for a two-flavor split single cup - she went for a small scoop of brown sugar banana chip atop a scoop of Tahitian coconut vanilla , while I went for a small scoop of caramel toffee atop a scoop of brown sugar banana chip (3 bucks). We enjoyed the ice cream and banter on the super-cool wooden bench/table combo that faces the main window. The scene was peaceful, and reminded me of The Yogurt Pump (YoPo) in Chapel Hill, which is held dearly close to my heart.\n\nThis place is amazing.

I decided to head to Xanath Ice Cream to have scoops of both Mexican vanilla bean and saffron once again.  Both flavors are must-haves since they're made to taste perfectly.  No other ice cream parlors besides Xanath have a taste of pure saffron.  It's been so long to have a taste of it on my second visit while a Mexican vanilla bean on my first visit.  This vanilla flavor is unlike any regular vanilla flavor from Dreyer's and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.  It's easy to get comfortable with a regular taste of vanilla most of us around the world indulge in.  So I chose to go for a different vanilla flavor.  Not just organic like Three Twins, but made with all natural ingredients, no gums, no stabilizers, no artificial flavors and colors.  Also, this vanilla has its flavor so real that tasting it takes me back to where it's born, in Veracruz Mexico.  And that is how I will enjoy the real taste of vanilla, intense and robust, the very best!  As for the other ice cream flavors in Xanath, they're all just as good.  Why?  Because they're organic.  Speaking of organic, there's just one flavor that barely answer my scream.  That's right!  I'm talking about the beyond organic huckleberry!  I wish the healthiest ice cream flavor will come back from its absence.\n\nI take it from certain people who made bad reviews.  When one person said their green tea ice cream tasted powdery, it shows that everyone has different taste and different perspective.

Maybe twice. Partially because, well, this is San Francisco and I'm pretty sure a piece of gum is marked up 150% more than the rest of the country. And also, because the last time anything was 0.99 was the time of Warhol or something. Or circa Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Definitely before most tech millionaires were born. \n\nAlas, that 0.99 sea salt caramel froyo made my day. My week, even. He tried to give me my penny in change, but, like a baller, I said, \"nah, you can keep it.\";P\n\nI walked a few blocks and sat at a bench outside a store, when a couple walked my way and sat right next to me, holding the same ice cream cones. I looked at them and said, \"Holy crap, did you get that for 0.99?!\" And I kid you not, we bonded over our three 0.99 ice cream cones for five minutes straight. It's a wonder how much something so cheap can seem so mutually glorious. Actually, never mind. It just IS effing glorious.", "author": "Ellie W."}

My friends and I stumbled upon it after dinner and were intrigued by the flavor offerings. While the decor was not fantastic, the ice cream was definitely very unique. We sampled everything from fig to dry cherry to brown sugar with banana to saffron ginger. The flavors were all so unique, and as another plus, the ice cream was all organic and very cheap as well--just $2.99 for a single scoop with two flavors! I ended up getting the pumpkin pie and fig on a cone--this was definitely the most unique ice cream cone I've had--it was very long and narrow and tasted like a wafer (very little sugar). However, I wouldn't necessarily say it was good. And while the ice cream itself was decent, it definitely was not the best I've ever had. (For some reason, the fig ice cream melted really fast, and the pumpkin ice cream had a strange crumbly texture.) We also got a large frozen yogurt with the two flavors they offered that night--caramel sea salt and chocolate. While the portion was large and the yogurt creamy, it also had a strange bitter aftertaste to it. \n\nOverall, this was a very interesting all-organic ice cream store with great value and unique flavors, and I'd definitely come back again just to sample more of their offerings.", "author": "David K."}

This time we brought the whole gang; my grandmother, aunt, little cousin, dad, mom, brothers- well you get the idea. My little cousin accidentally dropped her one scoop inside while we were still ordering ours. We asked \"Samantha\" (name given to us by her. Asian young girl wears glasses) if we could please get another one and her response was no, that if we wanted another one we had to buy it. We explained to her that it was an accident and that my little cousin did not even try it yet. Her response was that if it happen outside they can't do anything about it- understandable if that was the case- but it wasn't. We hadn't stepped foot out the door and as I stated earlier we were not finished ordering. Then she changed her policy and said \"well I didn't see it happen.\" Her response was honestly insulting, she practically called us lairs. I was deeply disappointed given the fact that we love this place and brought our extended family for their first time. The experience was awful. I don't believe this is the way any employee should treat their customers. Her attitude was empathic and unapologetic, not to mention rude.

However, I was sorely disappointed and left to wonder how Xanath managed to make a \"best of SF\" list.\n\nTrue, their flavors are pretty distinctive, and fairly strong if you like that. I certainly don't mind it because if you find a flavor or a pairing that works well, then sure you'd want a strong flavor. And all their saffron options are really unique as well.\n\nHowever, I found the texture a little icy. I really prefer my ice cream to be richer, creamier, smoother. You can tell even by looking at the ice cream tubs in their freezers - there is a layer of ice forming over every flavor. They must keep the temperature too low.\n\nOut of the ones we tried below, we ended up getting the Dutch chocolate & Ginger saffron together. These were a good pair, but a few consecutive spoonfuls of either of them alone and it would have been too intense!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y1CtMGY68B5ZJeH82ok8HA?select=AjedABadbF4APLTGetuxZg\n\n* Dutch chocolate - 3 stars\nRich, intense, good bitterness. A little overwhelming if you have it alone, but good if you counter it with a sweeter, fruitier flavor.\n\n* Ginger saffron - 3.5 stars\nThis had a really intense strong ginger flavor! I love ginger, so that worked well for me. The saffron seemed more subtle, but maybe I'm not as familiar w/ its flavor and can't pick it out as well.\n\n* Mexican vanilla bean - 2 stars\nI was sorely disappointed, especially since everyone raves about the vanilla.

They use real vanilla beans and the flavor really shows. I know it's so \"vanilla\" of me to like vanilla, but this is an awesome place to rekindle your love for this classic affair. \n\nBrown sugar banana chocolate chip: this is delicious. Just try it. I love the big chunks of chocolate chips and the banana/brown sugar flavor. Mmmm so good. \n\nWhen you're too lazy to wait in line for birite or you're so over paying $4+ for a scoop of ice cream, come here. High quality and friendly service.

Super fresh as always. \n\nSaffron:  A very understated saffron from my point of view.  (I eat lots of saffron)  It's everything you want in an ice cream with the saffron contributing even more to the creamy texture/flavor of the experience.  Those wanting a little more kick should get the saffron-ginger version.\n\nStrawberry Lemon Coconut Sorbet:  Think of it as Strawberry sorbet with a kick, and a little side trip down coconut lane.   The lemon and coconut flavors activate on you tongue a second after the strawberry hits it.  This is a sorbet  that self-cleans your palette while your senses beg for more!\n\nBanana, (something) (something):  Think of  Xanath's Banana ice cream as a banana bomb going off in your mouth!  If you have ever wanted the flavor of fresh banana ice cream then this is your answer!   Also included in the mix are little chocolate nibs, vanilla,  and some other flavors I don't remember in the name,  In all respects this can be a way to cheat and get a banana split put inside in cone.  I think the pint I brought home is going missing soon! \n\nHuckleberry:  This ice cream was a surprise to my mouth I did not take home (I already had four pints going with me!)   I be back for some later one.  Think of it as a toned-down blueberry with a little  blackberry twist.\n\nThe sad thing about my visit was the family was at home.  So pints to go along with tasting at least half to the flavors before I left.  it was a Yum Fest with a continuance in mini style later on.\n\n\nMy thanks to the Sunday night staff on 10/6/2013 whose wrist tolerated my large take-out order.

Both flavors are very creamy and complement each other well.

I loved Bombay Ice Creamery, when it was in business.  I love organic ice cream made from mostly-local ingredients, without additives (that's why Mitchell's never makes the cut for me).  BUT, let me tell you why I LOVE Xanath.  It's understated in that it's situated in between a few homes on Valencia under a small awning. You'd drive right past it if you didn't know to look for it.  In fact, they've now put some small benches and a giant ice cream cone sign outside to attract attention.  (Good for them!)\n\nThey make their own vanilla ice cream from actual vanilla beans, and not extract.  Thus, their vanilla flavors look like black-and-white hot mess.  BUT, it's so delicious.  I like the mundane to the extravagant flavors they carry.  (Sometimes, it's saffron-ginger or fig-&-red-walnut in their freezer case that catches my fancy.)  They also have frozen yogurt, and decent prices.  For what they offer- and array of seasonal, fun, local flavors to the best vanilla and chocolate, plus frozen yogurt: 2 stars.\n\nThe young lady behind the counter gives you tastes with a huge smile, using reusable silverware even after I've asked for a sample of EVERY ice cream they have in the store.  (I'm not that bad, but I'm sure you get my drift.)  I love the sustainability that they incorporate into their business practices.  They also use compostable corn plastic cups if you choose to have your ice cream in a cup, and not a cone- the original compostable/edible vessel.  So, I love their sustainable service with a smile.  That deserves 2 stars.\n\nThe fifth star is because I don't have to wait in a line outside, sectioned off by stanchions, hanging out in the cold, or the heat, or the rain for a taste of heaven.  This place isn't as well-known as Humphrey-Slocombe and Bi-Rite, and doesn't attract the ridiculous lines of people all hankering for a piece of frozen goodness.  And, that's the way I like it.

One young woman who works there who is delightful, always ready with a smile and an eagerness to make your experience as good as possible.  There are also employees who are clearly there for a paycheck and nothing more.  \n\nBut far more annoying to me are some of the patrons who have recently \"discovered\" Xanath, and who piss me off to no end.  These typically fit one demographic: women in their late-20s to mid-40s who are not originally from San Francisco (indeed, they have \"suburbs\" stamped on their foreheads in day-glo orange).  They also carry purses that looks like inflated armadillos made from used inner-tubes and glitter.\n\nFirst, they want to sample 5 different flavors, and they have to muse over each as if the balance of the universe rested upon their decision.  Finally, they order 2 different flavors, in a cup.  After it's been scooped up, they say \"I changed my mind; I want it on a waffle cone\".  The server dutifully throws out the ice cream and scoops up new product onto a waffle cone.  Total elapsed transaction time: 2 ice ages.\n\nBy this time, 97 people are now waiting behind her to place their orders; half of them have parking meters that are going to expire within 10 minutes, but it will be 3 weeks and 4 hours before they can leave the shop.  Then, our customer has to search through her purse for her debit card to pay for her cone, while taking a phone call from a friend, which we all get to overhear.  \"And then *I* said, 'no way'!  I mean, I dunno, you know?\"\n\nWhile paying, she flubs inputting her PIN, drops her keys on the floor and stands at the counter, licking her ice cream while slowly putting her belongings back into her purse, fluffing her hair, putting her sunglasses back on, all while holding her cone like the carcass of some mysterious animal that fills her with revulsion and fascination in approximately equal measures.  By the time she wanders out the door, her transaction has taken only slightly less time than the entire America's Cup series.  \n\nIf only Xanath could find some way to send the customers I described to Bi-Rite, the world would be a much better place, and Xanath would have a solid 5 stars from me.", "author": "Curran H."}

Recently, they removed one of its most appealing assets--the benches out front. The ice cream is a strangely unappealing array of various manifestations of vanilla, made from a variety of vanilla beans from far-flung parts of the world. Certainly an honorable concept, as I adore vanilla! Bring on the Vanilla Revolution, by all means! But the ice cream is oddly bland and powdery, and they seem quite stingy about it. They used to have 99\u00a2 tiny frozen yogurt cups from the soft-serve machine, also, but then they didn't, and now they do again. I wish they'd make up their mind. I think it's owned by the enigmatic vanilla bean importers across Valencia Street. The worst thing is the people who work there. They seem weirdly comatose, and act like they've never eaten ice cream. Ever. Not even on the planet they're from. They give one the impression that they are a cult. They are invariably robotic. The portions are disappointing. A sign says you can get free sprinkles, but this isn't a normal ice cream shop that enthusiastically dips your cup or cone into a big bowl of sprinkles. Instead, they use a teaspoon to arrange about a thimbleful of stale, introverted sprinkles sparsely on your ice cream, just enough to make you wish you went to a REAL ice cream shop WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I have often wondered if this place is just a front for a cocaine-smuggling operation, or maybe the local Peruvian mafia. Or worse, not. I think I'd feel less irritated if it was a front for something, because everything from the window display to the decor to the servers to the politically-correct non-disposable tasting spoons is so dry and metallic and personality-less.  It kind of reminds me of what used to pass as \"health food\" in Paris--glum restaurants serving eensy portions of brown rice topped with irritable vegetables, the only vegetables in France that had the misfortune to end up as bad French cuisine.

It's also really laid back in there but the only thing I didn't like was how small the place was and the placement of the ice cream. There was a stanchion for the line to form beside one of the glass cases, but what if you want something from the other glass case? It's awkward to push people aside or walk out of the stanchion to the other side--also not that efficient or organized.\n\nI tried the saffron ice cream and the fig ice cream. The saffron was the one that originally drew me into the store because I haven't seen a lot of places that served it. The saffron was just the right amount of flavor for me. Herbs like saffron are usually very easily overpowering, but one scoop of this was just enough--I don't think I could handle more of that! The back of my throat gets really hot near the end. However, I must stress that it was good! Really good! (:\n\nThe fig was also a delightful surprise as it wasn't too full of fig flavor, but just enough--also had some fig seeds; mmm... Also, the saffron and the fig are a good combination if you're looking for a couple of complementary flavors. \n****\nThe only bad thing about this one was that it was super melty and soft.. which I hate... It might've been that they're storage wasn't cold enough. I ended up having to chomp it down hella fast so it wouldn't turn into ice cream soup.. blech!\n\n\nThe pricing was decent. My small cup or \"one scoop\" was $2.99. It says you can get 1-2 flavors, and as I got the saffron and fig, I expected it to be a half scoop of fig and a half scoop of saffron.. that wasn't the case! The girl gave me some pretty full scoops of each which I technically would've had to pay $4.95~ for (the \"two scoop\" cup). \n\nI love the unique flavors--but might I add, there are 3 different vanillas.. I don't think that's necessary...\n\n\nI heard that there are a few other good ice cream places on Valencia with pretty unique flavors as well such as Mitchell's and Bi-Rite.. but those lines were way too long -____- I'm not complaining though.

It's a funny story.\n\nOk, so post-uh, 'evening activities', I usually end up talking about food, and the topic dujour was this awesome strawberry milkshake I had had over in the East Bay this afternoon. And like most men, the bf was like \"omg. that sounds so f*ing good right now, I want one\" so he checked the clock, noticed that it was 10:45pm and got a thoughtful look on his face like he was remembering a certain ice cream shop down the street being open late. So he verified his hunch, and went to go get some creamy treats. Less than 10 minutes later he was back with a strawberry milkshake for him and a scoop of  vanilla for me. In my own defense I am a Pepsi addict and had originally intended to make a float out of it, but it was just too damn yummy to defile with soda. Plus, the consistency and texture was divine.\n\nAs for the shake, the bf was like, taste this, it tastes...... interesting. So I did, and I was like, omg, it tastes like.......... strawberry. And not some wimpy strawberry flavor. This was like a punch in the face of fresh strawberries and cream. I don't know if any of you out there in Yelp land have ever made ice cream (I've worked in several places that make it from scratch, so I consider myself a connoisseur of ice cream), but there is a significant difference in flavor between ice cream straight out of the machine, and that same exact ice cream after it has set up to a scoopable consistency in the freezer. This was like putting a straw in the churn and sucking out the freshest essence of strawberry icecreamyness. In a word, awesome.\n\nNow, I've yet to hit up Mitchell's or Bi-Rite, but as far as I'm concerned, Xanath tops Humprey, hands down.", "author": "Amanda S."}

Hardly. Xanath Ice Cream needs to work a little on their parlor. It's like they didn't put any effort into the decor of their shop. If their ice cream spoke for itself and was hotdiggitydog, I wouldn't mind. It would be that hole in the wall in the Mission that was worth the drive/walk/wait. But there was no wait. Nor was there a shortage of parking (I got a space directly in front). Getting my ice cream from Xanath was effortless. Choosing a good flavor was the hard part.\n\nI tasted at least three flavors of ice cream before finding one I actually liked. Pumpkin ~ bleh. Fig ~ too sweet. Chocolate ~ gross. Huckleberry... It's good!!! Not as good as Mitchell's Ube but it did hit the spot and it was different. I've been on a Huckleberry kick since I had Huckleberry cheesecake at Michael Mina. Xanath Ice Cream isn't a substitute for one hundred dollar dessert but you do get what you pay for. I was happy with my ice cream but my relatives weren't. They came with the expectations of Mitchell's.\n\nMy *auntie pretty much blasted Xanath for having terrible Tahitian Vanilla Coconut and my *brother equated the Dutch Chocolate to Safeway Select. I'll let this slide. I am a strong believer of their Huckleberry.\n\nBack to the decor and shop. Xanath is a little all over the map. They've got ice cream, organic ice cream and frozen yogurt. I'd prefer them to be a little more focused. They have three large benches and one baby bench available for seating. It's like there was no thought put into the furniture placement. The baby bench is kind of squeezed in the middle. As for the name? No one can pronounce it. Therefore they printed up pronunciations and taped them up to the glass. It looked stupid and cheap.

The store features three different flavors of vanilla: Mexican Vanilla, Tahitian Vanilla (with coconut), and plain & simple Vanilla. Other flavors included Raspberry, Espresso, and Saffron. Everything is organic here, down to the spoons and the cups, made of recycled corn materials.\n\nI sampled a few flavors, and, although they were different from the usual, I wasn't overly impressed by them either. I went with a single scoop of espresso, which I thought was creamiest and had the right amount of flavor. The Orange Pomegranate Sugar Sherbet was very sweet, but more on the refreshing side due to the fruit flavors.\n\nPrices ranged from $1.99 to $4.99; they feature 11 ice cream flavors, 2-3 froyo flavors (the \"3rd\" flavor is just the swirl), and a mix of interesting toppings for $0.50 each. They also serve milkshakes.\n\nThe sizes were reasonable albeit not a completely good deal: a single scoop of ice cream is $2.99. The single scoop fits into a petite ~4 oz. cup; upgrade to a double scoop for $3.99 and it's a 6-8 oz. cup. So, if you want more value for your money (and you're hungry for a heaping bit of ice cream), go with the double scoop. There was also a tiny 2 oz. cup for children.\n\nService was bright; the workers were patient enough to allow for me to try out five different flavors before I could decide. I felt bad since there was a line forming behind me (I think me and Lolia S. brought in the crowd....).

When their blood touched the ground, the vine of the tropical vanilla orchid grew (from Wikipedia).\n\nThis is a dual review for Xanath's ice cream and for their incredible store of vanilla beans. \n\nI needed vanilla beans for baking eclairs. Normal supermarkets/grocery stores/specialty food stores ask for an arm and a leg for a single vanilla bean so the Fiance did some research and up popped Xanath.\n\nXanath is a small, clean store that sells ice cream flavors like saffron, huckleberry, Mexican vanilla and fig as well as whole vanilla beans. We decided that some ice cream would help us decide After trying a few flavors, the Fiance and I decided on Saffron. It was so creamy and delicious with a nice little kick of saffron at the end of the bite. I also loved the Madagascar Vanilla (tastes like fresh vanilla bean ice cream) and the Banana Cream. \n\nXanath also sells whole vanilla beans. These are known as chef quality because they're not pretty but they taste just the same as the pretty ones. They have two types: Tahitian vanilla beans and Planifolia (Madagascar) vanilla beans.

Actually all their flavors are very strong. Some ice cream is kind of milky, but this has a nice strong flavor like gelato. They make their own ice cream and it's local and, i belive, organic. My FAV ice cream is saffron ginger. YUM. i could just eat that over and over. I had a scoop of saffron ginger and a scoop of mango in a sugar cone and almost passed out from the dairy/sugar (although their ice cream isn't super sweet) and it was worth it. Another time i had their affogato - a scoop of ginger saffron (you can get any flavor) ice cream with espresso. They went sooo well together!! I was just way too wired since i never drink espressos.

So, I  have taken it upon myself to try all the new places to see how these small local gourmet businesses are doing and see how their products compare to both each other and the more established places. This is quite a sacrifice on my part being lactose intolerant, but I suffer for my curiosity and dedication of supporting small local businesses, not to mention sweet creamy treats.\n\nXanath I found to be delightful. They use Organic Streus cream and interesting fresh tasting flavors. I did feel that the flavors could have been a bit stronger although I am sometimes a fan of the subtle ice cream flavor where you can actually taste the quality of the cream. I had Match green tea and coffee, Hubby had fig, and baby girl had chocolate. They were all light and refreshing in flavor. A little quick to melt, it was a race against time for us to eat our treats before we lost it to our elbows, so a little firmer freeze might be in order; but  all in all, the prices were reasonable. For two single scoops and a child scoop it was about $8, plus they gave us with our order two vanilla beans which in itself is worth $6, so it was quite a deal.\n\nI want to go back to try their frozen yogurt.

It is a little too creamy, though, so the amazing flavors don't stand out as much as they could, unless you get the real strong flavors, like the apple cinnamon, or the saffron ginger.  The mint chocolate chip was phenomenal, but again I think a little overly creamy.  \n\nThis place is also the Vanilla Mecca.  They have at least 5 different types of vanilla ice cream that I counted.  Mexican, Tahitian, and so forth.  All have their own unique taste, and each one really stands out on their own.  There is no such thing as plain vanilla at this place,and I really like that.  \n\nThis place is a great alternative to Mitchell's or Bi-Rite Creamery, both which are within walking distance.  My only real issue here was with the frozen yogurt, which honestly if you're going to this place, you probably don't want anyway.  I, however, in a moment of clarity, decided to go for the healthier option.   \n\nAnd I regretted it.  \n\nOne thing about an organic ice cream place is that the ice cream is really fresh and tasty with ingredients you can really taste.  You ask for strawberry or apple cinnamon, and that's what you get.  The frozen yogurt, however, is also organic, which means that it isn't sweetened with sugar.  It is sweetened with all natural Agave, the stuff you buy at Trader Joe's.  \n\nIt DID NOT hit the frozen yogurt spot.  It tried.  It made a valiant effort, but alas, it was gross.  It didn't have the same sweetness you expect from frozen yogurt...unless you like hippie flavored frozen yogurt.  \n\nI'm definitely a fan of this place, but I won't be getting the frozen yogurt again.  I am curious to see what their sundaes taste like though!", "author": "Adam E."}

Wool coat wearing, teeth chattering and hair matted by the light fog mist that was rolling down Valencia, we ducked into Xanath to see what all of this vanilla hype was about. \n\nUpon first glance, I was a bit confused as to who is the producer of the ice cream. Is it Strauss Creamery as the tubs of ice cream in the auxiliary freezer indicated or are they doing this in house? \n\nAfter tasting three different varieties of vanilla, my husband settled on the Mexican version, which had a very strong vanilla flavor packed in every bite. \n\nI opted for the fig, which was on the soft side, just like I like it and had a perfectly sweet fig flavor. \n\nIn true SF fashion they use eco-friendly spoons and cups. My advice to you? Go in September or October when the summer weather really comes to town.", "author": "Lee H."}

Iced cream, as one C. Montgomery Burns might say, is a singular food passion of mine and always a treat--in good time and those needing some cheering up.  I am in the epicenter of the San Francisco ice cream scene.  There is Bi-Rite and its flagship flavour salted caramel, down south is Mitchell's and it's exotic tropical fruit flavour profiles and on the south east edge of San Francisco's #Gourmet Ghetto is Humphry Slocombe in it's no apologies flavours like peanut butter curry, olive olive and balsamic vinegar and let's not forget Bombay Ice Creamery with it's subcontinent flavours--rose and the never forgettable cardamom.\n\nXanath, since it is within feet of my domain, had been a not-to-be resisted ice creamery or at least that is what I imagined.  I cycled by and did a quick u-turn.  I thought what magnificent adventures for me and my palette.  I tasted a few flavours and yes they were good; blueberry, chocolate, Mexican vanilla and strawberry.  Very nice people scooping up the ice cream.  The Mexican vanilla was the most distinct and quite nice with the Mexican vanilla bean presenting a solidly clean and subtle spice in each spoonful.  The strawberry was good but no more special than say prepackaged strawberry ice cream.  This ice creamery is still in the throes of opening and I do hope for combined and zesty flavors to come.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

When I go out and buy ice cream I think ice cream that is very well made and usually in favours I don't make.\n\nXanath's pitch is the ice cream is organic and it use pure flavourings. That's it. I expect since the ice were single flavour smooth style that the flavours would be on display and each bite would develop the the notes of the flavour. What I got was ice cream that was ok but not much more. An hour later I couldn't remember the flavours I had. \n\nWe were a group of 4 on a saturday night. We tried eight flavours and by far the sorbets were better than the ice creams but it was pretty average. The space is far cold in style.

As a self-proclaimed ice cream connoisseur, it was great to find a new place with unusual flavors (and old favorites) done in a style that's light and refreshing in a way not found with other establishments' overly-cream-and-egg based (or worse, guar gum based (Mitchell's!)) delights.  Granted, I don't know what Xanath's recipe is, but it just tastes different somehow.  \n\nSo far I've tried the Dry Cherry (twice), the Fig and the Red Walnut Chocolate.  All really good in a subtly flavorful way.  As other reviews have mentioned, take advantage of the free samples to make sure you'll enjoy a whole scoop of something that's not familiar to you.

After frequenting the great ice cream stores of Frisco more than any religion, I thought for sure Xanath would keep me faithful. Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't wowed by any of the flavors. To be fair, I only had maybe 3 but all were dissapointments. The saffron tasted just like a version of vanilla. The Dutch chocolate was so bitter that it almost matched the bitterness of drip coffee. I couldn't even remember what the third flavor was but it also tasted like vanilla. I suppose if you're a vanilla fiend, you'll rate this place more than a 2. If you have tried any of the greats like Mitchell's and Bi-rite, you will be rating a 2 or below. *tear*", "author": "Gwen L."}

Tried the ginger saffron, the lemon-orange sorbet, but ultimately got the lemon-strawberry sorbet.  Let me just say YUMSSSS. My friend has the apple cinnamon and he was very very impress.  Wonderful blend without the cinnamon being too overwhelming.  Everyone knows that cinnamon can be taken only in the right amount.   Everything is organic and the price is a lot more moderate then the other ice cream parlor in the area.  The staff and owner of the store is very nice and personable.  Didnt rush us to order and be on our way, which is great because next time I am going to try all the flavor.", "author": "Winny L."}

I have tried this place about 7 times now and all 7 times were wonderful................. we have tried various flavors and have loved each of them.. To me, this is good ice cream and you can taste the fact that they use great ingredients.. What's also great about this place, you won't see any of those old looking cardboard containers with old ice cream heaped on top of the new.... I think in this place's case, it's because they don't make a ton, but rather make just enough to sell and therefore, it keeps the quality up... I recommend this place if you want something fresh, organic and unique..", "author": "Susan L."}

Xanath may currently lack the (deserved) buzz of the others, but still gets a thumbs up.  Stumbled past it on Valencia after dinner, glad I popped in.  Owner appears to be a spice importer, spices which make their way into the ice cream.  The Vanilla ice cream is rich and decadent in its own right.  My favorite was the Saffron.", "author": "Tyler H."}

But felt like making an exception for Xanath.  The name made me think it would not be somewhere I would want to take my kids, possibly uptight.  it's not at all.  The owner is incredibly friendly, and clearly takes a great deal of pride in his work.\n\nThe girls behind the counter were accommodating, letting us sample 5 flavors (with metal spoons yay!).  The owner brought my son napkins when he saw he needed some, he asked us what flavors we were having and when my son said fig, he explained it was organic and had no sugar just fig paste and he had mad it himself.  He pointed out the vanilla vine growing in the pot nearby  He is very enthusiastic about using organic products, agave or fruit sweeteners as well as sugar, all compostable spoons.  I hope he succeeds.\n\nI noticed other reviews that didn't care for the texture of the ice cream, I thought it was perfect.  If ice cream is hard it freezes your taste buds and then you are unable to taste the flavors especially the vanilla and fruits.  It was truly wonderful.  A child's cone is $2 which is reasonable, especially when you compare it to the decapitated ninja turtle ice cream head they beg for from the ice cream man outside of school.\n\nI can't wait to try more.", "author": "Adrienne S."}

However,  when I walked past Xanath and saw that all their ice cream was organic, using locally produced milk, I just had to cheat and give it a try.\nI sampled the saffron ginger which I thought was tasty, but ended up getting a nice size cup of organic frozen yogurt (vanilla and chocolate swirl) for 99 cents. Pretty hard to beat that price. I actually asked to see the list of ingredients and found them to be quite natural with no fillers, unlike most frozen yogurt. It had a little tang to it, tho I would have enjoyed even more \"sourness\". \nThe free vanilla bean was a nice touch. In case you're wondering what to do with a vanilla bean besides sniff the delicious aroma, it can be chopped up and added to a little vodka to make your own vanilla extract. It's also delicious in homemade kahlua or split open and steeped in hot milk.", "author": "GoddessDi D."}

My friend JT decided to try them recently, having been to Mitchells, Humphrey Slocombe and Birite 87 billion times each. We went, tried about 5 flavors, and none of them were particularly good. they were cloying, boring, and didn't do it for us. As well, they don't actually MAKE their own ice cream. They use a strauss ice cream base, and just flavor it, as opposed to the other ice cream places, that are all house made. fuck that. there's a *reason* there are lines at birite and humphrey slocombe.

I was so pleased! Tiny, adorable, friendly shop, and tiny, adorable, friendly shopgirl. The ice cream selection is definitely more exciting than the fro-yo selection, but I was on a mission for fro-yo, dammit. The yogurt does NOT taste like Tasti D, Pinkberry, or (insert your favorite college-years low-cal frozen dairy dessert here), but that's great because it actually tastes like yogurt. Which has been frozen. I got a cone of vanilla (99 cents) with organic walnuts (50 cents). Sprinkles and cinnamon are free. You can get a small cup for $1.99 or a medium for $2.99, but my cone was the perfect serving size for a snack or light dessert. Got my punch card and will be returning! My only suggestions would be some indoor seating (it was windy outside on the bench!) and a wider selection of toppings (I'm willing to go non-organic if it means peanut butter cups on my cone.)", "author": "Kimberly N."}

Also I like the casual and not-at-all pretentious attitude - seems family run and everyone was pitching in and having fun and friendly. Also, the price is right - a single scoop is $1.99 and you can get two flavors. I went with Saffron Ginger and Fig - both delicious. The Saffron Ginger was subtle and not overdone, but still flavorful. The Fig tasted incredibly fresh and will be in my dish (I am not a cone kind of gal) every time I come back if they have it. Their window display is a little nutty (must be they also own or moved from the spot next to ATA across the street and up the block that just had bottles of vanilla, and beeswax and various things that had no logical connection in the window and was never open, so you couldn't go in and figure out what it was all about.) Seems like they import and maybe distribute the vanilla themselves, and they have a vanilla vine growing in the store which was cool. My bet is Xanath is here to stay.", "author": "Aimee G."}

Flavors were \"standard\", not very intense,  my choices, at least, had an icy texture, and portion/price was similar to Bi-rite and Humphery Slocombe. The staff was enthusiastic, but not very knowledgeable [ had never heard of a \"half'nhalf\"]. One young woman did say some of the flavors were made by the owner while others were Straus. Things could improve in every aspect, [this is literally its first week] but for now, it is clearly a \"second tier\" kind of place.
