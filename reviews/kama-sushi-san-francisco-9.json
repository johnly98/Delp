The place is small so if you're a large party, it might be hard to get a table.\n\nWe ordered a miso soup and gyoza as starters. It was okay. Nothing to write home about. The gyoza did come with 6 pieces instead of 5, but the pieces were smaller. It had a nice crisp to the bottom and the top was soft. As soon as you bit into it, it fell apart. The filling didn't have much flavor.\n\nFor mains we ordered an assorted 7 piece sashimi, the August 4th roll, and the Red Dragon Roll. The assorted sashimi was good. The cuts were well prepared. I'm a little surprised that there was no salmon among the sashimi, but since it was chef's choice, no complaints. It was also interesting to try the different kinds of fish, some were super fatty and  melted in your mouth. \n\nThe rolls were very unimpressive. The August 4th roll was lack of better words confused. The inside had unagi, avocado and tamago. It didn't pair very well with each other and the tamago didn't add much either. It was topped with \"torched\" salmon, but ours barely had any singe so it lacked the smokey burnt flavor. The Red Dragon Roll was forgettable. The spicy tuna was very spicy, but the texture of the whole roll was mushy. This roll was also supposed to be topped with \"torced\" tuna, but it was barely singed.\n\nI live very close to here so I will most likely be back. I'll skip the rolls for now and just stick to their sashimi. Maybe I'll try their hot food next time too.", "author": "Junella T."}

The biggest difference from other delivery that I can say is \"the food is still hot like it came here at my door right after they made it.\" I was going to wait for my mate so that we could eat together, but I couldn't resist the look of delicious hot Katsu don! (Sorry mate..) \n\nMost of the time when I get katsu don delivered, the rice is little dried and the meat is cold. The ratio of the portions of rice and katsu are kind of off. (too much rice and a flat thin meat ) The saltiness of the sauce  was little too much for me. And as it said in menu it's really only Katsu and rice, nothing more. \nOverall I Personally do not hate this kind of katsu don, but i don't think I will recommend to another person.\n\nHowever, this katsudon I got from here was totally opposite from what I usually get from other places. It was hot and moist. The ratio of the portion is good. Not too salty. And there's extra like mushroom, onion, green onion, and egg which were very enjoyable. \n\n(It wasn't crunchy but I guess that's too much to ask for since it's in the plastic Togo box.) \n\nIt was the best katsudon I ever had from delivery in Bay Area.", "author": "Anna R."}

We showed up unannounced and were still able to get a table since it wasn't very crowded. We tried the Poki as an appetizer and it was very oniony (if that's even a word). From the 5 rolls we tried I think my favorite was the Unagi Avocado roll and the Hot Mama. Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon were truly spicy and nothing really special so eat at your own risk! Their happy hour specials are good (we got some giant bottles of Sapporo for $5 each). Overall, pretty good place in the neighborhood if you know which rolls to get and pretty average if you don't.

A and I have been meaning to try this place since we moved to the neighborhood and, after 6 months, finally did. We were pretty hungry so we ordered a whole mish mash of items. As other reviewers have mentioned, going during Happy Hour is the time to go from 5:00pm-6:30pm (maybe that timing is incorrect) which is every day. There are both drink and food specials. Since it was New Years Day and we had plenty of fun the night before, we just took advantage of the food deals. We were served complimentary Edamame when we sat down which was a nice touch. We also ordered tea which was delicious and nutty. It really hit the spot for our sore throats. We ordered:\n\n- Miso Soup ($1.95): I ordered one cup and A's meal came with it. This was good, standard Miso Soup. Don't expect anything mind blowing but its good.\n\n-Gyoza ($5 during HH): Delicious and a good portion for 2. Next time, I would get them steamed because they were a little oily for my taste but they were quite good.\n\n-Fujiyama Roll ($12.95)-Light and delicious. You could really taste the food and there wasn't any ingredients that were overpowering. Highly recommend.\n\n-Saba and Shrio Maguro Nigiri ($4 each for 2 pieces during HH): Fresh and quality fish for a good price. Usually, I am disappointed by the fish quality or portion at other sushi spots but this was the perfect portion and quality at a fair price. Is it the best you will ever have? Probably not, but at the price point, it can't be beat.\n\n-Beef Teriyaki Set Dinner ($13)-A ordered this and liked it. The Beef Teriyaki was good but a bit tough. Next time, A said he would probably stick with Sushi.\n\nA was still hungry after dinner and after seeing the Mochi that another table had ordered, he wanted to get it as well. He ate almost all of it since I'm not really into Mochi. It came with 3 kinds of Mochi (I believe green tea, peach and strawberry) and each was topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. He was really happy with it.\n\nFor the two of us for all of this food, it was only $55 or so before tip which is definitely reasonable. The service was fast and the food was quality. If you're in the neighborhood, I would definitely recommend coming here for a light, possibly healthy dinner. Please note that they open at 5, unfortunately, so there is no lunch service.", "author": "Carrie W."}

I generally order the deluxe chirashi and a few different kinds of nigiri. The deluxe chirashi has an impressive spread in terms of type of fish, including everything from uni and amaebi to salmon and mackerel. However, the fish is actually not particularly fresh. It's acceptable and won't get you sick but doesn't really meet my expectations.\n\nThe best nigiri here are the hotate (scallop) and amaebi (sweet shrimp). Both are not particularly impressive but still had a good slightly sweet taste at least. The uni, on the other hand, was terrible every single time. I never learned my lesson and kept ordering it because I love uni and wanted to give it another chance each time I was back, but the uni here is terrible. It's mushy and slimy and has a weird taste, not the delicate sweet brininess of good uni.\n\nI also tried the green tea Japanese cheesecake, which was surprisingly tasty! It doesn't have very much crust but the cheesecake is smooth, creamy, and matcha-y. Definitely one of the highlights here. They only give a really tiny slice though.. :(\n\nOverall, I would not come back here again. Not even sure why I've had Kama so many times already..", "author": "Tiffany P."}

The bf and I decided on KS, after stopping by another place that didn't smell very good and was loaded with childrens. No offense, I love kids, just not after 8 p.m. on a Friday night. That's adult time. \n\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was half empty, but we were nevertheless told to wait at the bar, or had the option to sit at a pretty tiny and awful table in the corner. Hm, okay, we decided to wait at the bar. \n\nMuch to our dismay, we were then sat at a tiny two-top right next to a family of 4 in the private booth. Look, I get how seating works--you want to save the bigger tables for bigger parties, but our table at KS was the worst and it detracted from our experience in a major way. We were especially unhappy that the better tables facing the windows remained empty all evening. \n\nThe family we sat next to was super loud with screaming children who kept dropping things on the floor next to our table. Finally, they left and we were starting to relax when a dizzy tech couple were seated practically on our laps, despite a myriad of empty tables. I never do this, but ... WTF. We suffered at length listening to these two complain about minimal work problems. I hate listening to people complain about their jobs on my free time, or at all, really. \n\nI noticed that most of the activity in KS consisted of to-go orders, which clearly makes sense, in retrospect. \n\nOur sushi wasn't bad, but it was certainly not good enough to make up for the seating situation. Our server screwed up our order a bit, but it was just a misunderstanding, I think. We really enjoyed the kurobuta skewers and the hot sake, courtesy of Yelp. \n\nWith so many sushi options in this city, I think KS def has room for improvement.

The staff mislabeled the price for coconut water. I told her it was the law and that they need to charge customers the posted price which was lower than scanned price. She refused, claiming that a kid switched the price tag. \n\nMr. NSS: \"Please don't make a scene, I'll pay for it.\"\nMe: \"Ummm no, it's the phuckin' law!\"\n\nMr. NSS: \"Calm down, you're getting your granny panties ALL up in a bunch over $2 BUT you spent $360 for one meal at Saison?!?\" \nMe:  \"Hey, I love my granny panties dammit...have fun with PALMela tonight!\"\n\nChoose your battles wisely, fellas. If you're girl wants to haggle over $2 so let it be. \n\nWhat drew me to Kama Sushi was their Happy Hour (HH) Specials available every day from 5 pm - 6:30 pm: http://bit.ly/10sysXZ. On the menu are $5 large hot sake, $4 large beers, $5 hot apps, $4 nigiri, and $5 maki rolls. I compared it the regular menu and you save about $1 for most items. Make sure to check in on Yelp for a free small hot sake!\n\nI had a not so great experience at Kama's SoMa location aka mad Hershey squirts afterwards, however, I heard that their Noe Valley location was better. \n\nLIES.\n\nIf you're looking for solid and authentic sushi, you will not find it any of their Kama locations. As the infamous Nobu K. would say, it's 100% Chinese here (I'm 3/4ths Chinese and I heard the sushi chefs speaking in Canto) with a huge jive ass roll selection. Not to say, Chinese sushi is entirely bad because Hamano Sushi nearby does Chinese sushi right: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hamano-sushi-san-francisco.  Sakesan Bistro in Inner Richmond is also great as is Kamu Sushi and Amami Sushi in the Peninsula. \n\nWe came right when Kama opened and we were the only ones there until we left. \n\nOUR ORDER:\n*Soft Shell Crab (HH $5): http://bit.ly/1z2vFky\n*Shrimp Tempura (Reg $7.95): http://bit.ly/1tgXqR0\n*Yakitori: Kurobuta: Sausage & Butabura: Pork Belly (HH $5 each): http://bit.ly/1x6Xbj4\n*Albacore Tataki (HH $7): http://bit.ly/1s9Jmsl\n*HH CA Roll, Sake, Maguro, Saba ($5, $4, $4, $4) & Sake Toro & Hamachi Toro (Reg. $5.95, $7.95): http://bit.ly/1z2wj1E\n\nWhat Kama excels in is their fried items. Whoever their chef is, they have excellent frying technique. The soft shell crab was piping hot, uber crunchy, and not greasy. Equally delicious was their shrimp tempura which was light, airy, and deliciously crunchy. One of the best shrimp tempura I've ever had! \n\nYou can skip their yakitori skewers. The kurobuta sausage was store bought and decent enough but their pork belly thinly dry, overcooked, and insanely salty. \n\nWith Kama's sushi, expect mediocrity. Thank goodness most of the nigiri we ordered was off the HH menu because I would NOT pay full price for these items here. We also ordered two nigiri off the regular menu to gauge the sushi making skills. \n\nOne of the fundamentals of solid sushi is the shari (sushi rice) and Kama's shari was terrible. The rice was grossly overcooked, mushy, and underseasoned. It reminded of the shari in Safeway sushi. The fish to shari ratio was also off (too much rice). Additionally, the quality of the fish was subpar and not fresh. Even with the Sake and Hamachi Toro Nigiri from the regular menu, the fish tasted dull and stale; no butteryness whatsoever. Avoid the Saba, it was fishier than p.....never mind. As a comparison, the sushi here is a baby step higher than sushi found at an Asian buffet. \n\nWasn't fond of the service either. Our male server was curt. After we received our food, he left to use his phone and never came back. The female server seemed friendly and brought us our bill. Had she been our server, this would have been a solid 3 star place. \n\nKama is small compared to their SoMa location with seating for about 25 people. We usually sit at the sushi bar but it was very dim so we opted for window seats for some natural light. \n\nEasy street parking.\n\nWhile this reads to be more of a 2 star review, I'm giving them 2.5 stars rounded up because of the HH specials and no mad Hershey squirts afterwards.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And given that their avg rating was also relatively close, this should be the equivalent to watching a Patriots-Broncos Game during the Brady/Manning Era right?\n\nWell ...as it turns out, it really depends what you're looking for.\nSome people watch because fantasy football got them hooked on points.\nSome people watch just to check out the cheerleaders \nBut also some people watch to see men in tights....(i dont quite understand why)...but whichever side they're on, they're still there for something related to the sport.....\n\nIn terms of sushi quality based on todays presentation. I would have to admit, Kama Sushi does have some of my old favorites ranging from Golden Dragon/Dragon Roll as well as the typical rolls you would find on Geary Blvd in the Richmond district, but after reading what i saw at Tataki South. I went against my usual habits of ordering anything with Unagi in it....\n\nI got lucky on both occasions; \n2 very visually appealing female waitresses at both individual locations.\n2 Happy hour Menus that consisted of tasty delicacies and house specials.\n2 Relatively similar Yelp Check in Deals.\n2 Very easy locations in terms of finding parking...\n.\nBut down to the rice, the rolls and the roll-outs..\n\n1)The WHITE OUT ROLL:  features an all white fish seafood roll made to order at the sushi bar, delicately and evenly torched one at a time to produce an effect that only people trained in handling such techniques can do without turning the white out into a burnout. \n\nThe resulting flavor is a very light fresh taste that you could only equate to if you have had fresh sashimi straight from the source, but if you're looking for a flavor you could actually taste this one isn't quite there yet, but it is still  very good choice for first time visitors who are not used to this kind of cuisine.\n(Albacore, Avacado, Walu, Hamachi)\n\n2)TUNA POKI Appetizer- Compared to most places, some locations would drench the tuna in sauce and very little seaweed and expect us to consume it right away. Others would forget the sauce and just load up on spices and nearly kill our throats if we forgot to order some accompanying drinks.\n\nThe tuna poki here is served with its seaweed garnish but also has a hidden hot kick to it for flavoring it. The knock in the nail for this serving is that there is more seaweed than there is tuna. that's as simple as i can explain it.\n\nOverall Verdict: \n\nA)IF you're looking for something not too different from Geary Blvd type menu but higher quality items avaliable, go to Kama.....\n\nB)IF you're looking for a fresh taste of the best ingredients locally sourced and sustainably grown/harvested and prefer an intimate setting with a concise selection that will impress.. I'd tip my hat to Tataki South...\n\nPersonal Verdict: I forgot to order a Coke.", "author": "Eric C."}

We ended up ordering a full spicy tuna roll, chicken karaage, spicy ramen, gyoza, and katsu don. Ramen was meh. Gyoza was standaard, but not bad. Spicy tuna roll was legit. The fish tasted fresh, which was good considering it was a weekend. Chicken karaage and katsu don was legit.

It was not crowded on a Monday night at 6pm but the place is very small (as most ramen restaurants are) so I imagine it could get crowded on any given night, especially later.

We also noticed a private table in one corner - dunno if you can reserve that but you could try :P\n\nFor HH, we took advantage of California rolls because my friend loves them ($5/6pc during happy hour compared to $6.50) and they did not disappoint. Just the right amounts of snow crab, avo, and rice!\n\nWhat really made this place was the delicious ramen broth! Deeelicious. We had the tonkatsu ramen and the pork was very tender and cooked to perfection! One of us had the pork replaced with the fried chicken - also very good, but I would go for the classic tonkatsu if you are trying this place for the first time.\n\nService was friendly.

I GOT SICK!\n\nSOUP: The to-go containers for soup are about an 1\" inch deep, two sips and it's gone, tasteless, and not enough ($2 each)\n\nPOTSTICKERS: $7 will get you miniature versions of the real thing. It's so small, they all fit inside the palm of your hand (if you're a girl who weight 105lbs w small features). The inside is \"filled\" or was lightly sprinkled w a substance not recognizable due to lack of \"it\". Why bother sending me an item like this? (Sigh)\n\nSUSHI: One of them I specifically asked to tempura and to add cream cheese ($4 extra charge) but instead received a burned \"Twinkie\", which was over cooked, and drenched in aoli sauce to disguise the black patches of the thick, burnt batter. The rest of the sushi looked descent because they were simple makis, as for taste, just slightly worse than the ones Wholefoods provide to-go. Perhaps it was the freshness, i doubt it was good fish, because it's 5 AM and my stomach is in knots. \n\n\"SKEWERS\": NO BIGGER THAN 3 cm each, for either chicken or beef (you get 2 skinny pieces of 1\" inch long minute steaks for about $6 each order) \nMy guy is 6'3 and ordered $12 worth of meat, but instead, got 4 children size skewers that literally got stuck in between his teeth before being able to enjoy it. He came hungry from work to find this, you should've seen his face w disappointment, we felt ripped off. Did you ran out of meat? Why would you charge so much for something that fits in between a TOOTHPICK? Why were they chewy? Why are they categorized under skewers, their own separate section, when they're merely \"cold snacks\"? Why the rip-off? \n\nDELIVERY: We're only two miles away and it took 70 minutes for food this tiny to arrive. All 8 to go items fit inside a medium size paper bag folded half way down, this is when I knew to expect everything to be very small, INDEED.\n\nI'm so upset, my stomach is sick, my partner is mad. What a terrible night. What a terrible way to start the week. \n\nI had to get up and make food in my kitchen so that my partner could feel like he ate. Can you believe that? I had to COOK after we got everything we ordered because it WASN'T enough/good/worth eating.\n\nMy partner does not eat sushi but decided to try other items not to be left out, and perhaps try it for the first time. Instead, I further upset him about eating sushi AT ALL because I'm so sick. Thank u for that.\n\nI relied on the four star ratings. I want my money back, I want my stomach to not remind me that you guys made me sick. I want this nightmare to be over, I want to sleep, DAMN YOU and your \"food\".\n\nI have NEVER said anything negative about a restaurant on Yelp, but you guys went too far, and I hope nobody goes through this.

The fish from the sushi dinner looked visibly dull: it had obviously been around the block a few times. The tuna in the rolls tasted almost acrid; I'm not even sure how I would make something taste like that myself. My friend got the ramen (okay, she shouldn't have gotten ramen at any place other than a ramen shop, but she was craving it). Also not a great dish at all.\n\nService and cleanliness: this restaurant must be popular with kids who like throwing food, because to our left there was a family with two kids throwing food everywhere, and to our right there was an empty table with food scattered all over the table and on the floor, which didn't get cleaned up for the entire ~45 minutes that we were there.

They have the check-in offer on Yelp, so make sure to check in and get the free small sake.  \n\nThe service was kinda slow but everyone was very friendly there.  They refilled our water quite often.\n\nThe menu was extensive.  It took me quite a bit to look through the whole menu.  \n\nWe have ordered:\n\nGrilled Seabass (4/5) - The seabass was very good.  It tasted rich and flavorful, but the portion was pretty small for what you paid.  \n\nCrunchy Lobster (3/5) - It was lobster avocado rolls with the topping of crunchy flakes.  This roll was recommended by the server.  It was ok.  The roll was pretty small.\n\nSuper Dynamite (3/5) - It was tempura spicy tuna rolls.  The roll was ok.\n\nShiitake (Mushroom) Roll (4/5) - This one was an easy roll, so nothing special. But the taste was little different from other Japanese restaurants\n\nWhite Butter Fish Roll (Forgot the name)  (2/5) - This one was not good.  It was white butter fish over the CA rolls.  The white butter fish was not fresh.  They used the faked crab meat for the CA rolls.  The roll was very small.  \n\nOverall Kama Sushi do have some creative sushi rolls and special dish but the quality of the food was not consistent.  Also I think the staffs need to know the menu more.  It seemed like they don't have any knowledge of what sushi was actually about.", "author": "Liza T."}

The prices are fairly decent, but really, you get what you pay for. They offer two-piece nigiri rolls for $3.50 and six-piece maki rolls for $5. Of course it doesn't include every fish in the sea, but it's a solid deal. I opted for the two-piece sake (salmon) nigiri and it was delicious. The unagi/avocado maki roll was just OK.\n\nI also opted for the rainbow roll (snow crab and avocado roll topped with tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, and snapper), which tasted like an unfortunate California Roll, but at least the fish atop the roll was fresh. \n\nThe Crunchy Lobster is a mess of a roll. It's supposed to be a roll with lobster salad and cucumber topped with salmon, avocado, crunchy flakes, and tobiko. Instead, it's a plate that's littered with crunchy flakes (deep-fried panko pieces, it seems) and you have to dig around to locate the roll. (Jina R.'s photo perfectly represents it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kama-sushi-san-francisco-6?select=tnboAedKImRyRlM6TDUWZQ#WCZKg65tKPo0oVvQZo745g) When you find it, though, it's far creamier than any roll should be. Um, no thanks.\n\nI hear the ramen's pretty tasty, but (as much as I loves me my ramen), I'm not sure if I'm willing to come back.\n\nPro-tips:\n+Unless you're into the mayo-ridden rolls, stick to the simple ones. \n+Happy Hour is worth the trip, but don't expect greatness.\n+Free shot of sake with a Yelp check-in.", "author": "Adena B."}

We called ahead to make sure they had room for us and arrived about 30 minutes later. \n\nThe sushi here was very good. We split a few rolls as well as some sashimi and a magnum of nigori (which isn't on the menu but totally worth it if you have a large group). The rolls that we tried were great - Autumn, C27, and Foxy. I definitely want to try the vegetable gyoza next time. Also, a small dish of edamame comes free when you sit down. \n\nThe only negative was that our waitress (while very nice) was a little unsure about some of the menu items, and additionally we waited a long time in between rolls and then an additional long time for our check. It is a small restaurant and it wasn't packed, so we weren't sure why the check especially took so long. \n\nEverything that we had was very delicious and I will definitely go back to try some more of the interesting rolls.", "author": "Laura Z."}

The sauces complimented each other perfectly--sweet and spicy--and the honey glazed fish was so so good with just a little crispiness from the sear.   \n\nMy bf ordered the sushi deluxe dinner and a spicy tuna hand roll and I ordered the Foxy roll.  All the fish was super fresh and they use REAL crab.  The Foxy roll was awesome--highly recommend it!  The only thing--and not a big deal--was that my bf ordered the red dragon roll, which came with his dinner combo, but they brought the rainbow roll instead.  Not a big deal--it wasn't disappointing.  \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly (my water glass was NEVER empty).

It was just in the okay range for me, it doesn't really have anything special to make me want to come back.\n\nI like the Edamame that provide in the beginning. We ordered the Wakame Seaweed salad which there's not much to say because it taste like the seaweed would anywhere else, but it was good.\nThen we order 3 rolls which were the Autumn, Foxy, and Hot MaMa and they were good but nothing crazy special. However I did like the autumn roll a lot because it was kind of like a tempuraed sushi, and I guess the mix with albacore was kind of nice. Everything else was so so... not bad but wasn't amazing. We also ordered a Tamago Nigiri which was yummy, the tamago was just right soft and not too sweet. \n\nWe checked in and got a free small hot sake so that was a plus+.  However the food actually came out really slow, which was something I'm not that used to. and the portion was actually really small, so that was bad. I mean obviously I know that the portion is not suppose to be big but it really was smaller than the usual normal portion that I get at any other sushi place, and I eat at a lot of sushi restaurants. Each piece of sushi was just smaller than usual so you may want to order an extra roll or something else more filling.\n\nThe service was great! They were really friendly and awesome and checks up on you very constantly to make sure that everything was going good for you. They also play music and surprisingly they have Korean songs playing in between from time to time so being the kpop fan I am that made it kind of nice hahaha\n\nAll in all it's not bad, but not really my choice of place if I'm going for the food.

For example, the Sunomono (cucumber salad) was $5 for a tiny little mound of cucumbers....I mean, come on. A whole cucumber costs $1, and the amount they serve in this dish is like 1/4 of a cucumber, so the mark up is like 20X. \n\nAll in all, very good though.", "author": "Serena Q."}

My only real complaint would be the pricing, cos I consider this place to be somewhat expensive. I actually don't really eat here very often anymore because I can't afford it. Somethings are properly priced but others are a few dollars too much. But they do have some yummy things that are worth it though! My FAVORITE things is their fire cracker balls. They are unlike any other deep fried roll I've ever had and they are always perfect! I haven't personally had it but I've heard their Ramen is pretty good. I enjoyed their tempura Udon. Their fish is always fresh and good which is important and the main reason why I still consider them one of the better sushi places.

But it was way better than that.  \n\nThe ambiance is way nicer now - a much more inviting option for a spontaneous dinner out in the neighborhood.  The menu looks fairly standard at first glance, but it's a bit more focused with more distinctive options in each section.  They have a few items on their nigiri menu that you don't often see outside of a specials list.  The roll selection is varied with a lot of interesting (mostly cooked) combinations.\n\nWe ordered a range of options from the menu.  It was all delicious, but the big winner was the nigiri.  We went for the slightly less common options, foregoing salmon and tuna for the more exotic butterfish, scallop, and monkfish liver.  Deeeeeelicious!  This is not your standard neighborhood  sushi.  \n\nNow that I know the fish is so fresh, next time I'll focus on the simpler, more fish-focused sushi options rather than the fancy combinations.

The service was fantastic and I was pretty pumped to get in on a Saturday night with no reservation. The food was a bit of a let down. I ordered several pieces of nigiri and that was okay, I also did a 12 piece of the chef's special Sashimi and this is where the meal took a dive. I wasn't a fan of the sashimi so it's hard for me to give this place more than 3 stars. However, I did like the cozy environment, service and the complementary edamame.

I agree with Jessica that there's too much tuna. Not really worth it for the price that they charge. Everything is fresh and all good but there is just nothing that wows me. Their yahitori is tasty but then again.. nothing special.\n\nI like that they gave a small bowl of edimame for the appetizer and a small scoop of ice cream for dessert. The green tea icecream was disappointing though, it's not the matcha green tea type, it's more of the syrupy sweet green tea that you can get at safeway or something...\n\nI would've given the restaurant maybe 3/5 but there was a misunderstanding. My bill came to be about $27 or so I gave $35 expecting to receive some $1's back to give as tip. They gave me back the bill book with nothing inside except the copy of the receipt. I asked the waitress if I was getting my change back. I know I speak softly but she just gave me a puzzled look. Then she realized that I wanted change and she was surprised saying that she assumed I was going to give all the change as tips. So they went and fix it... instead of giving me back my actual change, they gave me less. It clearly said $6.90 in change and they gave me back $3, so took their tips out of my change for me without asking. I just left the restaurant, not wanting to tell them that they should learn how to do some basic arithmetic and give customers back their change. I hate it when waiters and waitress automatically assume that you want to give all of your change as tips. They should at the very least ask before not giving any change back.. I mean WTF. is this.\n\nBetter sushi places in the city, not coming here again.", "author": "Aaron H."}

Their menu is simple, so don't expect anything out of the ordinary BUT I rather go to a restaurant with few items they can do well than one with an extensive menu with lots of crap they can't do.  The staff recommended the monkfish liver and the Kama Kama, which is the fish head.  I'm usually not a fan of neither because those are usually very fishy, but they were surprisingly pleasant. I'm still not a fan but that's just me.  I liked their nabeyaki udon, the hot mama roll, and dragon roll. All very well prepared.  Their unagi was also excellent.  This is a simple restaurant that delivers good quality food.", "author": "R A."}

My baseline for any new sushi restaurant is their California Roll. How basic is that? Their California roll was ooey gooey mayonnaisey with almost a \"supermarket sushi\" flavor. Then, let's talk about the Mango Tango. Yes, it was very light and fresh. But $7.95 for 4 pieces of sushi? No. This price is not justified and they should have put that detail on their GrubHub menu (or maybe I just missed it). The miso soup was good so I'm giving them 2 stars for the miso and pretty speedy delivery. Unfortunately I will not be going back. Too many other options. After reading more Yelp reviews I'm convinced everyone must be sake-happy when eating there. So disappointing.", "author": "Kathy G."}

Tempura asparagus was fine but not worth seven dollars for un breaded fried asparagus.  The C27 was mayonnaise and a little fishy.  Went out on a limb, and ordered the Hot Papa which is a baked roll... terrible.  Cheese should not be on sushi.  What is advertised as crab stick, is fake crab.  No problem, after I realized it was listed on the menu a crab stick, not crab, obviously my mistake, but why in SF would you use fake crab.  The one truly terrible piece was the Tobiko Sushi Special,  listed as three types of Tobiko.  What they meant was, Tobiko, and two disgusting artificially flavored Tobikos.  \n  The coup de grace, was we used the coupon on their flyer for free Dragon Balls.. which didn't show up.  All of this put together would be about a 2.5 star, but with a $60 price tag. No Way!  There is great sushi in this town, don't waste your time.", "author": "Theodore G."}

I ordered the salmon sushi and received mine after about 20 minutes, but I was in a group of 4 and I'm not going to eat in front of my friends when they haven't been served anything yet, aren't restaurants supposed to bring out everyone's food at once to avoid this issue?  Then, no kidding, we waited another 40 minutes for everyone else to get the roll they ordered because they literally forgot about us. I asked our waiter after 45 minutes of us waiting and he informed me that the kitchen actually forgot about our table, are you serious? They weren't even that busy! In the time we were waiting for our food, an older couple came in, ordered, ate, paid, and left. Then when we finally received and ate our sub-par sushi, we gave clear directions on how we wanted to split the check and they messed that up too, taking another 15 minutes to fix their mistake. Then the waiter has the NERVE to tell me, \"Oh, you don't have to tip, this has all been a mess\" Oh, trust me buddy, you are not getting a penny above what we owe you. They didn't even comp anything! We were there for an hour and a half due to their careless mistakes, and not even a free bowl of green tea ice cream, really? Maybe it's because we were all clearly college students and we weren't \"mature enough\" to know good service and sushi from bad, but I'll tell you what, I have been eating sushi since I was 3 years old and this was crap.

Sunday evening and we were seated right away, to a cool covered booth. I got two different sushi rolls (mango tango and autumn) plus seaweed salad. He got two (rainbow, and one big volcano type one) plus the seafood udon. My food was tiny. Somehow, I managed to order the two most tiniest rolls in the place. I'll admit, I was still hungry. They were good..the mango one was a little sweet for me, but both were tasty. But just way too small. My roommate's rolls were large. Add that to the soup, which came in a very cool giant spoon bowl, and he had a lot more to eat than me, so he graciously shared. His rolls were tastier than mine. So beware, you may get a lot of food, or you may get enough to just feed a child. The seafood udon had a lot of noodles, but the broth was bland and only had about two pieces of seafood. He wanted me to make sure to note that in the review. Because neither of us were stuffed, we tried the mocha lover - green tea, coffee and mango ice cream wrapped in mocha. This was really yummy especially the coffee one. The service was good to start, friendly, but by the end, they forgot about us over there in our cool covered booth, so much so that while we were trying to get our bill, a guy came over with waters and asked if we wanted to order..he thought we were brand new people! LOL. Overall, it was good, not great, but maybe just needs some tweaks of improvement still. I would certainly return, but hope to gamble to order some more substantial food.  It was A-OK! Oh, and i may add, the price was much better (cheaper) than what we would have paid had we been able to get into that other sushi place the night before, so bonus!", "author": "Merredith L."}

It's in a great location, the service is good and so is the atmosphere. But the food is just okay. The edamame they serve (complimentary, which is nice) is blah. No flavor and I always wonder if they got a good deal on it.  Last time, I had one of the less expensive rolls and was underwhelmed.  I figured, well I got what I paid for. But this time I ordered their signature roll, the crunchy lobster roll at $14.95. I had high hopes.  But it was just okay. There was so much tempura on it that it was hard to find the roll!  Then, I tasted the sauce more than the sushi.  I was hoping for a flavor explosion.  Not.  On the bright side the miso soup was good and so was the sake. But that's hard to mess up.  Osaka sushi in the Castro is a better option. Itchi sushi in the Mission close to Bernal is awesome. I will check back here in a couple months and see if they made it any better.

You know the type: cali rolls, anything with spicy mayo and deep fried.  Since being forced to go gluten free, my sushi experiences have been pretty limited.  I can't have soy sauce, anything fried, or imitation krab.  The waitstaff at Kama Sushi was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to tell us exactly what we could and couldn't have.  They didn't offer tamari, but luckily we brought our own packets just in case.     We ended up getting the rainbow shrimp (grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon, $6.95), negi hana roll ($5.95), spicy scallop roll ($5.95), and Boston roll ($5.95).  It ended up being just enough food for two mildly hungry people and we enjoyed all the items.

My big negative is that they have 2 TVs constantly on, usually with sports.  Although the volume is muted, it is a big thumbs down for me that so many places give in to sports fans need to constantly be entertained by overpaid \"icons\" playing games.  I prefer my nights out to be spent enjoying the company of my companions, distraction free.
