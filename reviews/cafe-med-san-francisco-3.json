This is hands down my favourite food joint in San Francisco. I work a few blocks away and come here almost 2-3 times a week. They have a buffet bar which has a great selection of hot and cold foods and is paid for by weight - this is great as sometimes you are not too hungry and  you only want to have a little bit for maybe 4-5 dollars :) They have some items which are available every day and the rest keep changing every day to keep things different. The food is just spectacular for the price you are paying. \n\nAdditionally they have menu of items that you can request to be made fresh on the spot. This includes burgers, shawarmas, wraps, etc. The food from their fixed menu is also brilliant, especially the bacon cheese burger.\n\nAnd lastly, this place is Halal, so you have a great variety of food to eat which is otherwise difficult to find in the Financial District.

I wanted to switch up my routine today, so I decided to try a \"hot new business\" near my office.  \n\nIt was a little after 2 p.m. by the time I left, which is the perfect time to take a lunch break in SF proper, if you can wait that long.  \n\nWhen I walked in to CM, no one was in there.  Score!  I'm not a lunchtime misanthrope or anything, but I like to move the process along (time being money, and all). \n\nEven though today (May 28) was National Burger Day, I opted for the Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad.  I note, however, that there are many good looking, healthy options on their menu.  And I hear their salad bar is bitchin.  Your options are listed on a large black chalkboard located above the sandwich/salad line.  I ordered my salad with light dressing and no croutons.  Next time I think I will order the dressing on the side, since \"light\" is subjective.  The cook made my salad in a flash, and it was topped with a copious amount of chicken as well (see my pic)--could have made 2 meals out of it, I reckon.  While the cook made my salad, the cashier waved me over to pay my check.  Multi-tasking: I'm a fan.  Saves time.\n\nThe salad was really yummy--I didn't read the menu closely but I'm pretty sure the \"spicy\" chicken was, in fact, jerk chicken, one of my faves.  I also like when the chicken on the salad is warm.  \n\nBut you know what was really great?  The salad was only $8.95--smokin' banana peels!  That's a great price for the Financial District, or really anywhere in SF for that matter.  Score again!  The best.  \n\nThis is a great place for lunch... not sure how busy it is during normal lunch hours, but I definitely recommend.  Give it a whirl.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I went to Cafe Med several times during the nanosecond it was on 2nd Street near Market where Mehfil is now. I just liked the option of having roasted vegetables and couscous for lunch when I was feeling the pudge over my belt. I had since changed jobs and office locations, but the pudge is still there. And now Cafe Med is back replacing the perpetually dismal Cafe Vivoli on the corner of Pine and Battery (one of my very few one-star reviews: http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-vivoli-san-francisco#hrid:GBUj4yQ3jTvjwug-nbgQ2A). It's a more expansive operation than it was at that weird two-floor set-up on 2nd with a salad and sandwich counter and a full buffet bar of hot and room temperature food.\n\nI've tried both options, and my verdict is that it's pretty good, nothing that outstanding but perfectly serviceable for a relatively fast FiDi lunch. As others have pointed out, the buffet line is strikingly similar to the one across the street at Chez Fayala, which I frankly think is a good thing since I like the variety of selections (see photo). The food quality here is not quite as good, a bit more cafeteria-level, but that may have more to do with the newness of the place and the cooking staff here. While you wait for them to get their groove on, you may want to try the $7.95 Spicy Chicken Caesar (see photo), which I thought was pretty decent especially if you're looking for a lot of poultry. It was a bit dry but nothing that the dressing couldn't address. I'll be back.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty good start for their new space, still looking for them to find their groove\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...definitely a bigger, more updated space though that huge buffet table is awkwardly placed in the middle\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...serviceable\nTOTAL - 3 stars...good initial promise for a nearby lunch option", "author": "Ed U."}

I thought about getting a sandwich but to compare the two I decided to get the buffet. I tried to get similar items here as in Cafe Fayala: beet salad, fried fish, and rotisserie chicken. My first take was not impressive at all. I would call a draw of the beet salad in both places as it is tasty in both places, but that is where the comparison ends. The fish here is not as tasty as the fried sea bass at Cafe Fayala. The worst part was the rotisserie chicken as it was dry and flakey.

Perfect - this place is right between our offices.

There is a salad bar with hot food (much like Chez Fayala and Lee's), and there is a place for you to order sandwiches and salads.  We opted for the salad bar, which is a little less than $7/lb, meaning it's a LOT cheaper than its other FiDi counterparts.\n\nFood was fresh, but the selection isn't HUGE or anything - nonetheless, I was able to try pretty much everything AND stay under $9 for my entire meal.\n\nYUM: roasted chicken, baked fish, cucumber-tomato-feta salad, string beans, vegetarian couscous, tofu with bell peppers\n\nPASS: \"Shanghai\" noodles.

Although I came here with the intention of getting the lamb burger, I left here confused and more likely to try the salad bar on a future visit.\n\nThe interior is spacious with tall ceilings and windows all around.  The salad bar is smack dab in the middle of the room with different Mediterranean choices that can be plucked for a reasonable $6.75 per pound price.  A few feet away sat the made-to-order window for sandwiches, entree salads, entree meals, pasta, and of course burgers.  I ordered the lamb burger on foccacia bread which came with feta cheese, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, and mint aioli spread.   Fries came with the meal.  After I ordered, I thought that I was second in line to receive my order.  I observed the kitchen staff frantically prepping food to replenish the salad bar and what I thought would only take 10 minutes to get my food, ended up being 20.  I had my suspicions that they didn't have any lamb prepped that day which would explain the delay.\n\nEventually I did get my food and after a few bites, I discovered that the meat didn't have any seasoning although the meat was certainly fresh tasting.  The remaining condiments did help to jazz up the taste but ultimately, I was disappointed.  I have yet to try a good lamb burger that can equal or top the Park Chow in the Sunset's version.  \n\nAlthough this is just one experience at this cafe, I did notice that their staff were hard-working and diligent in getting that salad bar stocked for hungry customers who wanted to grab and go with their food.

But like most of us who work here we don't always have the time to pick and choose. We barely leave our desks and when we do we haven't had enough time to give thought to where we want to go. A few years ago these quick salad and hot food buffets started to turn up on every corner. These were great alternatives to your typical sit and order establishments because you could pick and choose what you wanted and basically serve yourself. Essentially they solved the dilemma for us of having to pick and choose and wait for food.\n\nThe prior establishment here...cafe Vivoli was such a place. It was a great place because they had so much selection. I was upset when they closed up shop. Then came Cafe Med. I was reluctant to try it at first but once I did I was again hooked.\n\nCafe Med still has the pasta made to order station. They still do pizza and calzones. They still do the salad bar and the hot food bar. They kept all the great things about Vivoli and improved on it. The hot bar has more selection. The pasta is just as great as it was before. The prices are still very reasonable. The only thing they took away was being able to pay the price of your container and fill it up. Now everything is weighed and you don't have the option.\n\nThat's ok though. Here you get convenience and quality and for that the extra $$ (not too much - I've got mouths to feed) is just fine.\n\nThe hot bar is a fine offering of Mediterranean food. Be careful as you will get more than what you came for and you will go over a pound easily without self-control. I'm speaking on behalf of people I've seen eat there of course. I, myself, have perfect self-control and will power.", "author": "Ryan C."}

The first time I went here about a month ago, I ordered a cheese burger and as soon as I did, I saw the chef but two patties on the huge grill that you can see.  After watching him make up the burgers (10 minutes has passed by now, almost half my lunch break), I thought certainly one was going to be mine but instead he hands the burgers to a guy who was sitting at a table with his date.  The cashier saw this and gave the chef a nasty look.  I asked when will my burger be ready he said a few more minutes.  It took another 10 minutes.  The burger was tasty, but constricted poorly and fell apart in my hand.  I had to use a fork to finish it.  The second and probably last time I went here was today and I ordered, quelle surprise, a cheese burger.  This time it only took 6 minutes, but not until I got to my desk did I realize he gave me a chicken burger.  I don't know why I keep finding places with the worst customer service ever.", "author": "James F."}

Affordable, delicious, high quality ingredients, and made with obvious care and attention to detail. I noticed they have a lamb burger and will definitely be back for lunch.", "author": "Sandra S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-12", "description": "The real question is which side of the street do you want to eat on for fairly similar food, Cafe Med or Chez Fayala? For me, it's not even close: go Chez Fayala, especially if you want a sandwich or a salad bar. In fact, even though Fayala is more crowded (for good reason) they don't really have the service thing down yet at Cafe Med, so you get through Chez Fayala just as quickly.", "author": "Jeff L."}

I struggle to find anything good in this area that isn't a sit down restaurant. They have a counter where you can order a sandwich, or you can hit the salad bar, which also has fish, chicken, veggies, etc. I would highly recommend this if you just want to grab something good for lunch.", "author": "Sam T."}

It so happened I was in search if having something delicious and as I passed by this little gem, I smelled something grilling with a perfect blend of spices... Out of curiosity I stepped in and saw 3 people eagerly waiting for something. I was not sure and I asked one of them, they said oh we are waiting for burgers... I then looked at their menu and  was delighted to see they had Lamb Burgers (something that cafes usually dont have!)... I then ordered one for me and it came with delicious thick cut fries - crispy on the outside and soft inside with perfectly seasoned blend. I went in the next day and tried their buffet. I loved the variety of food, especially the salad bar and baked fish.... Their rotisserie chicken is really very flavorful and moist... this is truly a real gem with perfect location, perfect food, lot of choices, plenty of seating and how can someone beat the lamb burgers! :)", "author": "Gayatri S."}
