I was principally going to meet dear friends who had lost their beautiful home in the Sonoma fires; and were grateful to be alive.  \nI had just returned from France and in the savory memory of an American ode to foie gras I decided to try their chicken liver pate.  It completely blew my mind, and I had to readjust my head because I was 'shook'.  Its that good.  So flavorful and rich, creamy smooth with a melody of high and low notes playing simultaneously on your palate.  It was the highest quality I've had anywhere--and so well done.  I would dare to say it was the best.  \nThree of us ordered the Chicken Milanese with lemon caper beurre blanc and mashed potatoes.  Another complete and total winner.  Soulful, mouthwatering deliciousness.  The chicken was tender and impeccably cooked, the crunch contrasted with the smooth potatoes, perfectly balanced by the lemon caper beurre blanc.  There was nothing to say.\nComplete satisfaction.  After that flawless apex I was not interested in any dessert.  Give yourself a treat and go.  If they had delivery I would be a junkie.", "author": "Portia S."}

Garibaldi's charged us the amount we authorized on our card for the appropriate date we came in. The next day they charged us again, but a higher amount. No good. At first glance, a simple mistake of a duplicate charge. I reported to my bank, but the restaurant only refunded the lower of the 2 amounts. The kept the fraudulent amount. Ok. Odd, but I can deal and take care of it. Called my bank again to request the signature sheet. Got my money corrected. Won't go back. \n\nHere's where it gets weird!

Cocktails ordered \nIncluding a brought a special bottle of wine from Alban Vineyards in Arroyo Grande ( Santa Barbara. Santa Ynez)....more on this later.\n\nWaiter was pleasant and informed us he was new to Garabaldi's-- but had been a server a long time and he definitely wasn't a rookie. Ordered a split appetizer. Veggie dumplings and very tasty.\n\nNext came the Chopped salad, not my favorite but wife loves it. So I had the most delicious cauliflower soup I have ever had. Simply amazing. Not a drop of cream in it. Just pur\u00e9ed cauliflower and broth drizzled with a little oil and a few tiny chips of cauliflower on top. Order it. $10. Worth every penny.\n\nNext the mains-- I had grilled salmon (5 oz, maybe) cooked perfectly with a light brothy sauce. Enjoyed it, not a large dish at $34. Wife had Fresh pasta with rabbit sugo. Tasty, but...very dry. Our waiter never came back once as our food was brought to us by other servers. We couldn't flag down anyone. Frustrating and decided to let it go. \n\nAfter the dishes we cleared he finally came over ( my wife left to was her hands) and I mentioned to him we were disappointed he disappeared. I explained about the dish and he apologized. I simply tried to explain he needed to be attentive. Told me he had way too many tables. Not my issue.\n\nFor $200 without tip I felt it was a near miss.

I have been here several times before, always loved it, but this was by far the worst experience. You need serious training of your staff as to what kind of restaurant you are, and how patrons expect to be treated. I would expect a meal there to be a minimum of a 90 minute experience.\nFirst, we made a reservation for 8:30 so we could watch the world series. We arrived around 8:35 and were seated right away. The waitress was basically in a hurry from that moment on.  She asked us for our order before even getting a drink order.  We were not ready. Then after taking the drink order, she came back for food order, again before bringing the drinks.  We weren't ready. After we got drinks, we ordered appetizers.  We had the pate' and the calamari. Both were quite good and the portion sizes were fine. \nWe then ordered our main course. We had the chicken cutlet and the sea bass. The portion of sea bass was no more than 3 ounces.  It was embarrassing.  It was cooked fine and tasted fine but it was just way too small. the chicken was somewhat dry and and very pounded so it was too thin. She came back at least twice to hurry us a bit. My date even commented that they wanted us to finish. We decided not to have dessert.\nI have always considered this a true romantic date restaurant, where you settle in and enjoy your evening. I may have to re-think that.  If you don't want people there after 9:30, then don't take 8:30 reservations, or better yet, open a restaurant in Kansas, not a major city.", "author": "Z A."}

I ordered the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which came with jarlsberg, manchego, and \"midnight moon\" cheeses, a side of really delicious salad, and a cup of tomato soup, which was so delicious.

My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, and while I'm not a fan of chicken, I took a bite and thought it was delicious. They also have an extensive wine menu, but we ended up being so hungry when we got there that we jumped right into the food.

I also got the calamari since the dinner plates looked like a lot of food. The calamari was also really good, but too salty even for someone who likes salt.

After the absolutely horrible experience we had last night, July 6, 2018 between 6:30 and 8:00 PM we will NEVER eat here again.  For those interested I will provide details.\n\nI should have know something was wrong when we arrived for our 6:30 reservation and there was no one at the reception desk and the place was almost empty.  I remember when the place would be packed on a Friday night, but it was the Friday after July 4th.  When someone did show up they had our name wrong in the reservation, but they did seat us at a table in the downstairs section as requested.  \n\nThe waiter was a nightmare from the beginning, surly would probably be the best description.  We asked for bread when he was asking about water choices and taking our drink order.  He was clearly annoyed when my spouse requested that he give his iPhone with the recipe for drink he wanted to the bartender.  When the drinks arrived, it was very clear the bartender had not followed the recipe so it had to sent back for correction and still came back missing the orange slice garnish requested.  When the drinks arrived and we repeated our request for bread the reply from the waiter was \"I will bring it after I get your food order.\"  Are you kidding me, like we were going to order drinks, eat their bread, and not order food??  They grudgingly brought the bread before we ordered food.  When we asked to runner who brought it about the issue with bread and getting the food order he indicated that he was only able to bring it after clearing it with the manager.\n\nNext my spouse asked for a Diet Coke which when it arrived it was flat.  When it was brought up to the waiter he snarled that he knew it and it was impacting all their bar carbonated drinks.  He did not offer any alternatives but we later discovered they had non-diet bottled drinks available.  At this point we requested to speak with the manager.\n\nReally interesting to discover that the manager was this woman who had been doing upper arm stretches on a corner that was right by our table earlier.  Just assumed that person was a customer.  Long story short, her comment to us was \"I am really busy with a lot of things, in case you hadn't noticed.\"  Maybe she was too busy approving bread orders?  She did offer the bottled drink alternative and my spouse ordered the root beer.\n\nTo be clear the food was OK.  Salads were great but one of our party ordered lamb which was clearly not fresh and was not served hot, more like lukewarm.  The member of our group who ordered the lamb got up from the table to have a side discussion with the manager about our overall disappointment with the dining experience.  Her overall reaction was that it was really too bad we felt that way but NO indication that she cared one way or the other, but maybe it was our problem. \n\nThe next thing we know our bill appears on the table.  We were not asked if we wanted desert, coffee, after dinner drinks.  At that point we decided we would pay the bill, give zero tip, and leave.  As were walking out the door my spouse said to the manager it was really sad that the place we had loved for so many years was reduced to this state.  At that point the manager began screaming at him in front of a group of people in the entryway that we were unwelcome there and needed to leave.\n\nI sincerely hope the owner of this restaurant reads this and seriously looks into the issues we encountered with the waiter and his manager.

Once our waiter did (who was horrible) he appeared to be in a hurry, no specials were mentioned (did they have any, don't know!), all he said was \"what do you want?\" My friend wanted a burger, the waiter wrote it down without asking how he wanted it prepared and never offered any extra topping options. Since I know their menu well, I stopped our waiter and said, my friend would like to know the topping options AND perhaps he'd like his burger cooked a certain way....no apologies, nothing. Just a quick \"oh yeah\" and then a cheeky response to me saying \"do you want your chicken medium rare too?\" RUDE!!! He is the bald waiter - just a sad representation of what used to be good service. THEN to top it off. Our orders come out another 30/40 mins after, but without the burger.

We had a nice corner table where my friend and I could catch up over our scrumptious meal, and I loved our whole dining experience as our server took such great care of us but gave us plenty of space and time to carry on our conversation.  \n\nI cannot wait to come back!", "author": "Maile N."}

My husband I just dropped in with plans to have a pre-dinner cocktail and try and appetizer. It turned into a great date and not only did we stay for dinner but desert too. I'm so glad we did. \nI ordered a dirty vodka martini and asked Jenny, the bartender, to make my husband \"a manly cocktail.\" Man O War it is! Mine was delicious and my husband enjoyed his unique concoction as well. ( Whiskey with a Rosemary-Honey syrup and ???)\nWe started with the mussels. AMAZING. I am not a huge seafood eater but I LOVED these. Made with garlic, jalapeno and white wine, perfect. We also tried the olive tapenade served with sliced bread and focaccia-again, wonderful. \nWe were enjoying ourselves so much my husband wanted to stay and have dinner. Pretty sure we consumed a dinner's worth of calories already but...why not? We are on vacation. \nWe split the signature Chicken Milanese. It arrived and looked perfect. Each aspect of  this dish was on point. The chicken was juicy yet crispy, potatoes were lightly seasoned not overpowering the taste of the vegetable and the arugula salad was a star as well. \nI think around this time was when he got cocktail # 2 and so I did to but switched it up and got the cucumber martini. I wish I had seen that sooner because i would have started with that. Tasted very light and fresh. Sooo good. \nSince we were on vacation.....DESERT! Jenny surprised us with the Chocolate Budino. To.Die.For. Espresso ice cream, chocolate cake and candied pralines. I know..heaven. \nWe ate at the bar since we just planned on drinks but the service was fantastic. \n\nAll the staff were great! Can't wait to go back and try the Asparagus Risotto...Asparagus Risotto...It's calling my name. See you soon Garibaldi's. XOXO", "author": "Amy O."}

The entire dish was tasty and provided lots of satisfaction.\n\nOn a weekday evening at 9pm the place was packed. The Belle Monde comes out in force. The decor is sophisticated and intimate.

I was friends with the previous owner and often took guests there. I noticed a drop in quality of staff a few years ago but kept going because of the old school feel and despite the fact that the wait staff was getting more and more difficult and the bar service was sub part ie they never mixed special drinks the way you requested. But this last time was basically the last straw as the waitrr was rude and dismissive and the food was not prepared in a fresh and piping hot manner...without going into great detail, our guests were very disappointed in the service; diet cokes were served flat even tho the waiter was well aware of this. Upon requesting to speak with the manager she was extremely short and rude; something I have NEVER experienced there before. I expressed sadness to her about how much the restaurant has been slipping and I was rudely ordered out of the place as I was leaving. So sad to see an old establishment truly losing it's grip on the basics of decent food and drink preparation as well as friendliness and professionalism. Good-bye Garibaldis....It WAS a special dining experience long ago and far away but unfortunately it is no longer. Any body interested in taking over???", "author": "Petet G."}

There's so much fine dining in SF  that I haven't visited but this place just rocked our evening! I'm glad we made reservations because when we arrived the place was packed! We arrived half an hour early but we're able to get seated in 3 mins. We were seated towards the back where there was a little bit more privacy & where we could have a much audible conversation. It was my stepson's 23rd birthday that we've been celebrating all week & we could not have picked a better place. \n\nWe ordered a few small plates to share namely: warm kale salad (refreshing), bacon wrapped asparagus (oh so good!) and the risotto croquettes that they're known for. All good and as a foodie I could taste the blending of flavors on each bite. Yumm! \n\nOnce your palate has been introduced to good food, you'd want more right? I ordered the chicken Milanese only coz I saw on the menu beurre blanc and my oh my! It was heaven! it was a great pair with the chicken. I've had beurre blanc with fish before but not with chicken. The salad was a bit bland but not disappointing. My husband ordered their version of a chicken pot pie and I must admit I like it a lot! I like all the ingredients exposed and not filleted and the crust was added for texture & presentation. \n\nThe boys ordered the halibut and although it appeared to be a smaller serving  than our plates, Alex said that it was delicious. He's from San Diego and had a lot of fish before but if he said it was good then that's legit. Mason ordered the lamb tenderloin. He didn't say much but was quietly munching his food & finished first. It looked like a win for him considering we were nudging him to try the ribeye instead. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the large serving of profiteroles and arrived on our table with a birthday candle and a happy birthday around it. The profiteroles and the sauce we're delicious and were tempted to order another serving. \n\nWe were expecting small portions for a fine dining restaurant but their servings were more than I thought. Our bill came to $200 (3 apps, 4 entrees, desserts) without alcohol and that is a reasonable price for fine dining in SF for 4 guests. Our waitress was very attentive and served promptly. \n\nValet parking is $10 and very convenient.", "author": "Ammie A."}

I got there on a Friday night and there was a pretty long wait. The restaurant isn't that big, but it can get pretty crowded depending on what time you arrive. The atmosphere is very calm and soothing, with dim lights and candles surrounding the place. \n\nI remember ordering two appetizers, an asparagus dish and a fried calamari plate. The Calamari didn't have that overly fried and crunchy feel, but it was rather light and tasty. The asparagus had a unique oyster sauce that was very interesting and worked very well. For my main course, I had an Alaskan Halibut and it was steamed to perfection. I have to say that the food was presented well and tasted good. The price is what you'd expect to pay for an upscale restaurant. If you happen to find yourself in this area and want to treat yourself to a fancy meal, I would definitely recommend Garibaldi's.", "author": "Steve N."}

The restaurant is modern, yet cozy and very clean and the seating is well organized for such a small place. \n\nWe started with cocktails and the roasted potatoes. They were coked perfectly!!! The Irish girl in me was very impressed. For the main courses I got the steak and my girlfriend got the Korean BBQ ribs and her bf got the gnocchi and a salad. My steak was soooooo god and a huge serving. \n\nWe finished out the meal with two desserts, the mi t cookie sandwich and the brownie sundae. They had fancy names, but that's what they were. The chocolate was really good and the mint ice cream was creamy and delicious.\n\nThe only reason I'm knocking a star off is because the chilled noodles that came with the BBQ ribs was so salty it was unenjoyable. Also the puff pastry that came with the ice cream was \"meh\"\n\nFor the three of us with the above items along with two cocktails each it was $210.

I think the waitress kind of judged me for a second there because she gave me a funny look when I gave my order.\n\nI also ordered the orchiette pasta with cheese and added a side of grilled chicken. The selling point for this dish for me was the truffle oil and when I couldn't taste it at ALL. I debated for like 15 minutes on whether or not to say something, but with every bite I got sadder and sadder until finally my companion said something to the waitress as he couldn't bear it any longer.\n\nSo I got a side of truffle oil and it was BOMB and it made me so much happier. \n\nWe also had the brussel sprouts which are supposed to be very popular.

However, after leaving Garibaldi's on Saturday, it left me thinking that some people seriously need to lay off their bongs. \n\nWhile the menu was enticing, the food was not well executed. Almost every single dish our party ordered had major flaws; from overcooked food, odd ingredient pairings to funky one dimensional flavor profiles, it's not what you would expect from a seasoned chef. To put it nicely, I've had more appetizing food at Elephant Bar and I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. \n\nAs other Yelpers stated, portions are huge (which doesn't matter if the food is no good) but wine and food are overpriced.

The ridiculously bland tartare (no egg yolk nor did I detect lemon or capers) was doused with flavorless \"whipped mustard\" and served alongside ginormous parsley leaves, Parmesan shavings, long strands of pickled onions and radishes that distracted from the tartare (all should have been finely minced). No crostinis or bread was served with the tartare. *scratches head* \n\n*BRAISED SHORT RIBS w/ Soft Polenta, Roasted Broccoli & Spicy Red Pepper Agrodolce ($29.50) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p6bLw7PS63Kbge_wyIOP8w?select=_UmyuyGCnAUxPz8VABPa0Q#3SjDN3Ai4f87bniANFv_mA\nA dish made for denture wearers, everything tasted like mush and severely needed a crunchy texture contrast. Although the shortribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, the agrodolce that lacquered the ribs was grossly sweet (not spicy as stated on the menu) and reminded me of Gerber food. I ate part of one rib and threw the rest on Mr. NSS' plate.  \n\n*MARINATED LAMB TENDERLOINS w/ Couscous, Pistachios, Golden Raisins, Summer Beans & Tarragon Sauce ($36) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p6bLw7PS63Kbge_wyIOP8w?select=_UmyuyGCnAUxPz8VABPa0Q#xzwLKLtVdR6c_pEIBiJvMQ\nMr. NSS dish fared better as the lamb was rich in Moroccan spices but was a bit dry. The couscous was overcooked and lacked a toothsome bite. \n\nOther guests ordered the Risotto Croquettes which they said tasted like tater tots, Seared Tuna that was overcooked and bland, Pork Tenderloin that tasted like Panda Express Orange Chicken, and Pork Belly that was ALL fat. \n\nTo the Chef(s): Please lay off all the parsley. I swear someone got too parsley happy in the kitchen and made my dishes rain with oddly ginormous parsley leaves. I'm still having parsley nightmares.\n\nS E R V I C E\nThis could have easily been a 2 Star review but service was Garibaldi's saving grace.

First, I thought the whipped mustard was whipped butter. It didn't taste like mustard at all. I suppose the radishes were used for the bitterness to help with the mustard? Didn't work for me. It's missing a raw egg yolk. There was also a ton of flat leaf parsley. I didn't bother to mix most of it with my tartare. It felt too salady. \n\nThe 2 course for $21 consists of:\n\nbraised lamb ragu: garganelli pasta, portobella mushrooms,\nbellwether farms ricotta, mint\n\nand a chocolate espresso bread pudding. \n\nThe birthday girl (sitting next to me) had ordered the marinated lamb tenderloins. It had 3 pieces of tenderloin sitting on a mountain of couscous with beans sticking out. I know first hand because this was also what I was given when I had ordered \"the pre fixe\" My dish of lamb tenderloins was returned and I was told that my lamb ragu would be ready in about 5 minutes. \n\nThe braised lamb ragu itself is just good, but missing something. I felt it was a bit rather on the spicy side. It definitely had some kick, followed with some heat. I certainly didn't taste any mint but I found myself wishing it had some peas or something! Also, the portobella mushrooms were cooked with too much olive oil. Whenever I would get a chunk of mushroom, all I could taste was olive oil. If I can taste this through the sauce, that's kind of bad. \n\nTried a piece of the lamb tenderloin. Tasted like stewed beef to me honestly. I wasn't impressed. If I had ordered that I would've been upset. $36 for 3 pieces of lamb tenderloin that tastes like stewed beef sitting on top of a bed of couscous!? Come on.. Let's be real here. That's overpriced. Ok. I digress.\n\nBday girl's brother orderd a 3 item anti pasti. He picked the watermelon, risotto croquettes, and chicken liver pate. I loved the chorizo spices on the watermelon. Made me think of the fruit stand in the Mission buying mangoes with Taijin sprinkled all over them. He felt the watermelon wasn't compressed enough but I was fine iwth it. \nThe risotto croquettes tasted like tater tots. It had fontina cheese and a tomato coulis but the fontina was lost amongst all the breading, hence the tater tot comment. \nI liked the pate well enough, but another friend did not. She felt it was too sweet.  It was probably the maple-sherry gelee. I was able to hide it with the dijon mustard.\n\nI definitely would not make this place a destination. If you're around, I guess it's fine. I really think there are more restaurants in San Francisco that are able to execute flavors better with the same price tag.", "author": "Susy C."}

We were drawn in by the cute curb appeal and very good smell wafting to the sidewalk.  We came a little late, about an hour before closure, and were seated within 5 minutes.\nWhen we ordered our drinks and our waters we found out that the first two wines we inquired about were \"86'd\" for the night which was fine since we got there so late. \nOur wines came about 10 minutes later but no water, a few minutes go by and our still waters are brought but my sparkling was still a miss.15 minutes go by and just as I'm about to post a tip on yelp regarding service-BOOM, sparkling!\nThe first two dishes we chose were also out for the night, which was to be expected after the wine, so we ordered the burata, beets, and mussels to share.  After taking our order our waitress disappeared until dessert time, which is usually fine but we were all out of water and sparkling and wine...\nDecor:\nDark, upscale, and intimate.  Most of the patrons around us hit their heads on the lamps above the tables while exiting... may be something to consider if they're due for a remodel. \nFood:\nThe beets were pretty tasty, the feta paired marvelously.  The burata was a bit of a disappointment.  It didn't taste like anything special, I've had burata numerous times and this tasted bland.  There was no flavor besides basic mozzarella and a hint of basil-even though there was a leaf on every bite-perhaps the basil was not fresh?  The presentation was quaint though.\nThe mussels... oh gee.  The bread that came with it was divine, the smell was a bit off putting but the taste of the smoked bread was delicious, the mussels came with some sausage in the middle I believe but as I didn't read it/choose it and I'm a vegetarian I was a bit surprised.  There were also a few mussels that were sealed shut, which are a danger to eat and although we knew better, a tourist or individual eating mussels for the first time, the would have no clue and get extremely sick.\nService:\nThe service was meager, ...shall we? She didn't bring us the bowl for the mussels until we were halfway through, we were not offered bread like other patrons, our waters were never refilled, we didn't get our waters until after our wine then after we ordered, she said she would come back to check on us after she took our order and she never did until it was time for the dessert menu.  She was misinformed on the wine, she tried to have us order a cabernet after she stated that it was a pinot, we caught her and she apologized but ... if you work here-shouldnt you know what you're talking about?  Also, the food that they were out of should've been announced by her when she handed us the menu.\n\nOverall, probably not coming back.  The wine was the best part and I can go to any wine bar for that.  Sorry charlie, we were extremely unimpressed- so much that we only tipped 10% and she didn't even deserve it.", "author": "Sara N."}

For appetizers, they had this amazing olive tapenade with an assortment of breads & we enjoyed their Heirloom Tomatoes.  I had the the Fresh Tagliatelle Pasta, a journey of savory flavor in every bite.  The pasta is made so thin that the meatballs shine through & the Calabrian Chili gives those plum tomatoes just right amount of kick.  A dollop of ricotta & fresh basil make this my favorite pasta dish in San Francisco.  The birthday girl even stole my dish for a bit.  But what could I do?  I only owe her my life.

The cocktail was fantastic. It set me into the right mood for some awesome food... which never arrived.\n\nThe chicken liver pate tasted... well... simple. There was nothing wrong with it, just like there's nothing wrong with eating bologna, but there was very little interesting or complex.\n\nThe Ceasar salad tasted like trader joe's bagged lettuce, overdressed. Oh, and the charge extra for anchovies, but they don't tell you they charge extra for anchovies. And they do finely shredded cheese where one wants course cheese shavings to stand up to the dressing.\n\nThe main course pasta, this is a nominal Italian restaurant, was worthless. The sauce tasted like canned sauce with a few extra spices thrown in. Once again, nothing complex, just some sauce over pasta.\n\nThe desserts were shockingly bad. The bananas were just jello vanilla pudding with bananas and cinnamon and the hot chocolate seemed to be swiss miss.\n\nSan Francisco is full of awesome restaurants. A-16 is radically better than Garibaldi's, a mile away, and similarly priced. If you want to wander to the south side, there's Joe's of Westlake and the \"authentic east coast mafia-style Italian\" at Val's.\n\nThe only reason I could see for going to Garibaldi's is one does not want to drive anywhere, lives nearby, and the difference between a $20/person and $100/person meal is meaningless.\n\nOh... and they add a 4.75% surcharge for \"San Francisco employment related costs.\" This was the rotting cherry on top of the nondescript sundae of a meal.", "author": "David P."}

The burratta bruchetta was also good, but I find that the delicate texture of the cheese was overwhelmed by the bread.\n\nENTREES: I thought for sure the pork tenderloin would be the winner today (too sweet, nothing amazing), but the lamb tenderloin was so flavorful and tender, pretty much like a glorified lamb kabob. Based on stalking other tables, I would probably try the roasted chicken, and skip on the salmon (looked pretty ordinary).\n\nDESSERTS: I am so glad they offered 2 desserts in a \"petite\" portion at a discounted price ($6) vs. the regular sized dessert. The server says the regular portion is really not that much bigger, so it's a better deal to diversify! I knew for sure that the Chocolate Budino would be awesome, and it was good, but tasted like a pretty basic flourless chocolate cake in a cup.

It's a classic restaurant with simple but well-made dishes.\n\nBoth our hostess and waitress were very sweet. Our waitress was enthusiastic and upbeat, describing her favorites and recommendations and leaving us plenty of room/time to decide on what we wanted. Luckily all the items I was curious to try were on the Dine About Town menu!\n\nTo start I had the burrata. It was really fresh, not as polished and primped as burrata at other restaurants I've had in the past, but instead more of a slurpy, satisfying spread. It complemented the bed of arugula and tomato puree nicely. I got three pieces of bread with it, which was sufficiently generous given I had their starter bread as well. I actually think a crispier, more flatbread-like bread could pair better.\n\nFor the entree I had the orechiette pasta. It was fantastically prepared. The cute helmet-shaped pasta were cooked to the right texture and the braised beef was marinated in a slightly tangy and BBQ-like sauce. Interesting pairing of flavors. The only flavor I wasn't a fan of was the orange glaze. It's a very subtle flavor but I felt like it didn't belong in a savory dish like that. \n\nDessert was satisfying - I had the lemon panna cotta. The lemon was almost undetectable (which is good for me because I am lukewarm about citrus-flavored sweets) and I liked the interesting pairing of pistachios. My sister had the cream puffs. I thought the bread was a little too thick compared to the filling.\n\nParking is not bad in the area after 6 pm. We found a metered spot on an adjacent street. \n\nWhen I first walked in I noticed the clientele was on the older side, but it changed to a younger crowd by the time we finished our meal and walked out the door. I guess my sister and I have the dining habits of your grandmother.\n\nGive Garibaldi's a try especially if you're in the Presidio.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-03-16", "description": "I have a 75% genetic hearing loss. I have dealt with this very challenging handicap for almost all of my life, and sadly my condition has gotten much worse over the past year (despite the valiant attempts of the very greatest experts in the field at UCSF Medical Center, all well documented.) I ate at this restaurant tonight. Unfortunately, due to my handicap, my voice sometimes gets louder in noisy environments. This restaurant is very noisy. Tables are packed in, and there is only a gap of inches between them.  The restaurant was filled with other Pacific and Presidio Heights diners, all talking happily and enthusiastically . . . and not quietly. Which would normally not be an issue. And is not normally ever an issue at any other restaurant. However, halfway through the meal tonight, the manager, Andrew, came to our table and officiously told me I was speaking too loudly, and needed to keep my voice down. It was completely humiliating for me, in front of my dining companion. After he came to the table, I approached this manager (Andrew) privately, told him I would try to keep my voice down, but explained to him my handicap and my situation, and that to a large extent it was beyond my control.  He was 100% unsympathetic. He tersely told me I could leave the restaurant if I was not able to keep my voice down. \"You don't have to eat here,\" was his actual quote. He was rude and cruel when I explained my disability. He made absolutely no attempt whatsoever to understand, or have any compassion whatsoever, for my handicap. He had absolutely no comprehension that he had embarrassed me. At this point, we finished our meal quickly, did not order dessert, and left. I will never eat in this restaurant, ever again. And tomorrow, I will file a complaint with the ADA, as this is legally my right under the Americans With Disabilities Act. Nobody deserves to be humiliated over their genuine handicap. And tonight was a completely and totally disheartening and humiliating experience for me, in a situation where I do not have the ability to gauge the volume of my voice in a noisy environment. And this is a VERY noisy restaurant, hardly the public library. I would add that when we arrived at this restaurant, we specifically asked this very same manager, Andrew, for a quiet table in the back . . . where there were some empty tables.  But instead he seated us right in the middle of the main dining room, right next to the bar, in the noisiest possible area, with other tables (and diners) on either side of us just inches away.  Even after my explanation to him, he made no attempt to move us to a quieter area of the restaurant.  And so, do not go to this restaurant unless all of your facilities are in perfect working order, otherwise you will be embarrassed and humiliated. A hearing handicap is no different from any other legitimate handicap, and the way I was treated tonight was inexcusable, and completely discriminatory. But apparently, any handicap which might minimally inconvenience other diners is not tolerated at Garibaldi's. Garibaldi's policy is that unless you are perfect, stay home and order take out.", "author": "George D."}

With 5 family members, we ordered by elimination--got everything but the caesar. The bacon-cheddar \"tater tots,\" which sound like terrible bar food, were actually creamy mashed potato croquettes, and were the stand out. The vegetarian chopped salad, of all things, was the next dish with a light but creamy buttermilk dressing. I found the pate too sweet, but everyone else liked it.\n\nThe Papas Bravas were lightly crispy on some edges, but the aioli was bland. The Garibaldi's namesake salad was a boring throwback: vinaigrette mixed greens with candied walnuts, bruised pear and blue cheese. The beets had a nondescript white sauce, and frisee that tasted like it had been tossed in a salt & oil dressing. At around $8, the burger is an absolute steal with fries and a salad's worth of mixed greens. The patty was perfectly medium and thick, but not particularly flavorful or tender, and served on a pretty tough bun. \n\nThe Cucumber Martini, basically a gimlet, and the French 76 were tasty though uninspired. The Island Breeze, a vodka slap in the face with a little pineapple, was not.\n\nAt Super Duper prices, you get white tablecloth service from a wonderfully friendly bartender.", "author": "Laura S."}

Not surprisingly, I don't really make it out here very often since coming out here feels like an excursion to New York. Ok not really, but you know what I mean.\n\nAnyway, my party of three was cozied up by the window at our table and we spent our entire dinner laughing about things we used to do in college, things we're doing now, and things we're about to do.  We ordered the Burratta Mozzarella to start and conversed over a few cocktails (the Perfect Perfect Manhattan and the Cucumber Martini).  The cheese light and airy, and was a great dish to share.\n\nWe continued to talk and soon dinner came out.  We each ordered something different (as a Yelper, I find this to be the optimal situation), where we ordered the Seared Lock Duart Salmon, the Bucatini Pasta, and I had the Herb Roasted Chicken \"Pascarella\". I was seriously impressed with my chicken; most of the times you order a chicken dish, it's got a good possibility of coming out dry or boring.  Not this one. There was a little bit of a crust on the outside, and the inside was extremely tender!  I had a bite of my friend's Bucatini dish, and the rich cheese (presumably burratta) had me thinking that I should have had that instead.  Then I tried the salmon dish.  I'm actually not a fan of salmon.  In fact, I will usually tell someone that it's on my blacklist.  BUT, my friend offered up a piece of salmon that appeared to have crispy skin, and I reluctantly said OK.  The result? I couldn't be more impressed with how tasty the dish was! And while fish may not be my first choice, I was SERIOUSLY impressed with the dish.\n\nI ate until I was relatively full, and then dessert was offered.  Garibaldi's offers Petite Sweets, where you basically get a small sized version so it makes it easy for us undecisive people and those of us that ate too much dinner.  We went with the Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Bananas Foster. The chocolate cake came with coffee ice cream and was beautiful, rich, and decadent.  The Bananas Foster was equally delicious with a wonderful crunchy topping in addition to the rich bananas.\n\nOverall, dinner really impressed me.  It'd be a great place to take my parents to, it's definitely more of a \"classic\" fine dining place and not your standard super trendy restaurant that's popular in SF these days.

We both agreed it was stellar\n\nFor our main dishes -by recommendation of the server as well as our own contemplation , we went with the Marinated Lamb Tenderloins. It comes with couscous mixed with dried cranberries, pistachios and drizzled in a Tarragon sauce. This dish also arrived beautiful in presentation and quite plentiful. The lamb was cooked to a tender perfection ( medium rare) just how we requested.  As far as the flavoring of the dish , as well as the bed of couscous concoction the lamb was laid upon, I would say it was just OK. Couscous was flavored decently however, I felt it was just slightly too dry. I also wasn't completely sold on the tarragon sauce the Lamb came accompanied with. Neither of us were crazy about it.

Dinner was delicious: I can recommend all the dishes we had: mussels, lamb tenderloins, and tagliatelle (comes with meatballs).  The bread with warm olive dip was also lovely.  No room for dessert, but it was worth it to try as many dishes as we did.\nService was not great. Everyone was nice, which in my book is the most important thing, but the server didn't seem that well trained.  To her credit, she was trying to be fast, but that caused her to not listen and subsequently screw up a few things.  The busboy actually seemed to have the most professional training, e.g., knew exactly when to clear dishes and serve more water.\nDefinitely recommend.", "author": "JJ M."}

But, I do want to note that everything on their regular dinner menu was reasonably priced and I would definitely come back again and pay the full price for everything we ate. We  had the Risotto Croquettes and Garibaldis Salad to start. We ordered the Cioppino and Chicken Breast Milanese. And had Profiteroles and the Chocolate Budino for dessert. Everything we had was very flavorful and prepared perfectly. Our server was incredibly sweet and attentive. Dinner went very smoothly--just the right amount of time between ordering drinks and food, check-ins from the server, refills, etc. We never felt rushed and never felt like we were left waiting too long.

BF was LATE. Parking is impossible (as I told him before he decided to circle). I told him to valet. We were about 20 mins late but they still kept our table and sat us. \n\nTheir cocktail list is impressive. We decided to \"share\" because again, my bf thinks my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Sometimes a girl just wants her own dish! We shared the blood orange salad. AMAZING. Came with slices of onions, blood orange, arugula and avocado. So fresh and light. We also shared the Italian meatballs which were also delicious. We chose the salmon as our entree. I really like it when restaurant split the dish onto 2. I dislike the times where I feel like a vulture picking at 1 plate. \n\nThe dessert, my friends, is the best part. The profiteroles were amazing! They had just put it on the menu the previous night and so far were a hit. Let me tell you...they were the best I have ever tasted in my life. \n\nI will definitely come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Wine service is not professional and rushed. Really bad knowledge of how to serve wines.  We dined here for dinner, and we bought in a nice bottle of wine for corkage (the bottle was 16 years old. It retailed  for $110, 16 years ago. California Cabnernet, bordeaux-style blend).  The server, Jeff, rushes to open the bottle without even looking at it. We asked him to decant it since it is 16 years old, and with an annoyed look, he rushes to the back with the bottle without saying anything.  He then comes back with the wine in a decanter and plops the decanter in the middle of the table. He doesn't say a word, and he doesn't pour the wine.  He discarded our bottle and cork in the garbage for a wine that we had been laying down in our cellar for over 10 years.  We wait.  The wine sits in the middle of our table.  He comes back, takes the order, begins other service, and still leaves the wine on the table. He doesn't offer to pour at all. So, we have to pour the wine ourselves into our glasses. I have never, ever had this happen in a restaurant.  He never refills the glasses from the decanter.  We have to do the entire wine service ourselves for the entire meal.  Had we not poured the wine ourselves, that entire decanter of wine probably would have sat in the middle of the table the entire meal.  This is unprofessional and unacceptable in any any restaurant in San Francisco, but especially one that is in Presidio Heights, where the clientele is extremely knowledgeable in wines.  The staff at this restaurant needs to understand that people in SF take their wines very seriously, and that they need to treat the wine experience just as well as the food experience. Wine and food are coupled together, and a strong wine experience complements the enjoyment of food. This is a fundamental concept that was truly lacking the evening we dined at Garibaldi's.  We hope the management will take some time to emphasize to their servers the importance of taking the wine service seriously and to train the staff in proper wine service.  This is important especially since some of the wines that are brought in for corkage can be quite valuable and hold sentimental value for their patrons.", "author": "Gunnar F."}

My wife and I invited another couple to join us in SF for dinner this evening, we came from Novato, our friends from San Carlos. The only reason for our joining forces at Garibaldis was a generous offer through Travelzoo for a new restaurant that sounded wonderful online.\n\nGood news was that the eating experience was as expected, very good, the bad news was after an otherwise wonderful culinary experience, when presented with the bill our waitress proceeded to school us on the proper use of the coupon and the fact that they were busy attending to others so we would have to wait while they figured out our bill.\n\nNeedless to say, I was embarrassed our friends had to endure the berating of the waitress and I was surprised as most all the diners were there this evening because of the promotion.\n\nI had bought 2 of the promos as this was the maximum allowed and had hoped and planned to go back again soon, sadly this will not be the case as I have requested a refund for the unused voucher and will not return regardless how much I enjoyed the food.", "author": "Brad G."}

We were in town for the Hong Kong Film Festival and wanted a place that was close to the theater.  It was within stone-throwing distance which made this place extremely desirable.\n\nService was prompt and courteous.  We arrived around 5:30 PM on a Sunday which meant that most reservations were not in just yet.  We were seated and drinks started.\n\nWe started off with anti pasties of the Tuna Meatballs and Roasted Brussels sprouts. Both were tasty, the tuna meatballs were a little dry, but the sauce on the tomatoes and greens for it were delicious. The Brussels were as one would hope for them to be--al dente and lightly seasoned.\n\nFor entrees, one of the party members had the filet mignon, two of the other party members had the braised beef short ribs, one other member had the pork chops, and I had the pasta.  I can only comment on the pork chops and pasta as I did not try the others.\n\nThe pork was quite tender and juicy, which is a surprise as I have had dry pork chops all too often.  The peach glaze was also very delicious.  The only thing was that there was too much pork chop--if that is even possible.  My husband can usually down a 18 oz steak from Alexander's Steakhouse, but was defeated by their pork chop dish.\n\nFor me, I had the pasta which was rather plain, but after the heavy appetizers, I wanted something nice and light.\n\nOverall, great atmosphere and courteous wait staff.

They seem to cater to groups because the menus greeted our group personally and included a selection of soup or salad, main entree, and dessert.  \n\nMy salad of fresh greens with gorgonzola and pear slices with a basalmic vinaigrette was tasty.  I had the seared blue nose sea bass with israeli couscous and asparagus and lemon-shallot vinaigrette.  The chocolate budino for dessert was basically a warm chocolate cake with espresso ice cream, caramel sauce, and pralines.

Tucked away in the affluent Pacific Heights, this charming restaurant offers great tastes set in a trendy dimly lit space great for a romantic date or nice candle lit, white table clothed dinner with friends or family. Believe it or not, we came in with a Travelzoo voucher that we had purchased earlier that entitled us to two antipastis and two entrees.\n\nI have to admit I was a little wary about any restaurant luring customers in with Travelzoo deals at it makes you wonder about the quality of the food, service, or any other factor that could result in a bad meal. I was proved wrong...the food and service was amazing.\n\nThe menu has a wide array of selection with rich and bold flavors and hearty portions. Notable items on the menu included the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection (so juicy and tender) served with delicious fingerling potatoes that were fried to perfection. Start that off with the Garibaldi's salad served with sweet lettuces, gorgonzola, spiced walnuts, nectarine, and a delicious white balsamic vinaigrette and you'll have yourself a perfect pairing. And while it was not included in the Travelzoo deal, we splurged on dessert and got 2 petite dessert items that were topped with their homemade ice cream (espresso and peanut butter to be exact).\n\nThe Travelzoo deal sounded to good to be true, and as it turned out the bill turned out to be more than we expected. Their system has a weird way of calculating the bill based on the Travelzoo discount so it wasn't exactly clear what was taken off the bill as it related to the Travelzoo discount. When we left the restaurant, the numbers still weren't adding up in our heads, but we left with a good meal so we decided to let it slide. On the way home, I got a call from the manager stating apologizing that they miscalculated our bill and missed a step in the discount process. Turns out our instinct in miscalculation was correct and they missed a step in the discount process. They kindly credited my card for the money that they didn't take out of the bill and apologized for the inconvenience. In any other circumstance, the confusion would have bothered me and make me think twice about getting another Travelzoo deal and/or coming back to Garibaldi's, but the fact that they called me back to acknowledge their mistake and apologize makes it all better. Great way to take ownership.\n\nMoral of the story...don't judge a restaurant by it's Travelzoo and when in doubt, calculate your check to make sure it's actually a deal. Thanks for the deal Garibaldi's and for a delicious meal! We'll be back--deal or no deal!", "author": "Andrew S."}

The servers and hostess were wonderful and attentive. \n\nThe atmosphere was alright:  dim/dark, louder than I'd expect, a small place with lots of people. \n\nThe food was okay. Some were hits, others were misses.\n\nFor a party of 3 we had the following:\n\nBrussel sprouts and chicken pate for appetizers. The sprouts were kind of charred, but okay. The bitterness was slightly diffused by roasted bell peppers, but not enough. The pate was okay, something I'd expect. \n\nFor a starter, we only ordered one item: the Ricotta Mint Cavatelli. This was really good actually. And with the small appetizers, it was perfect to share between 3 people. \n\nFor the mains:\n1) Chicken Milanese - really well cooked, seasoned, and paired with mashed potatoes and arugula salad. I'm a fan of this dish.\n\n2) Grilled Filet Mignon - It was okay. It was cooked to the proper medium-rare temperature, but was still a bit more chewy than expected. It was under-seasoned. The sides were fine, nothing to rave about. \n\n3) The honey maple brined pork chop - the porkchop itself was decently cooked and a large size. It was tough to cut though. The texture while eating was fine. The taste was overwhelmingly sweet. I expected it to be somewhat sweet, but it went overboard. Overall, an okay porkchop. The sides: the pumpernickel spraetzel (sp?) tasted and felt like a scrambled pancake. The turnips and carrots were underseasoned. Overall, a let down of a dish. \n\nI don't regret coming here, and I'm glad I tried it.  Would I come back again? I don't know. Maybe for a glass of wine and a good starter.

Loud!\n\nFrom the outside, you might think Garibaldi's is ideal for a quiet, romantic, candlelit dinner. Everything about the decor and location of the place would tell you so; but no. It's very much the neighborhood hang-out, and the atmosphere when we went in (Thursday, 8pm) was deafening. My companion summarized it perfectly: \"people who should know to act better at a restaurant\". \n\nThe food was excellent. I had the watermelon and I-forget-what salad; very flavorful and well presented; followed by the bucatini con gamberi, which lived up to the promise of the appetizer. Wait staff did a good job, and were pleasantly accommodating.\n\nWhether or not you'd enjoy the restaurant probably comes down to whether or not it's your kind of crowd. Without passing judgment, the atmosphere was one of the most homogenous I've been to for a restaurant, and we stood out a bit for not fitting the mold of being quinquagenarian, moneyed and white. The food really was great; you'll just enjoy it more if you were there in good spirits in a group of four than if you were looking for a mellow evening as a couple.", "author": "Mike D."}

But I'm sad to say, it failed to satisfy this critical bear.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that Garibaldis looks very nice. The decor is very modern and the tables were set up comfortably. It's actually much bigger than I thought it would be and the hostess was very  nice.\n\nThe food itself was subpar. I came here with my lady bear where, with Yelp's expert advice, we started with pork belly and watermelon and fried risotto croquettes. We ended with chicken Milanese and rabbit pasta. Let me break it down...\n\nAppetizers:\n\nThe bread that came was stale although the Olive dip was delicious. The Fried Risotto Croquettes have a great consistency, however, the tomato sauce undercuts its flavor. It basically tastes like fried macaroni and cheese at your local Cheesecake Factory, quite a shame. The pork belly and watermelon was appetizing in flavor, but the pork belly wasn't really crispy and it's actually REALLY hard to eat in a bit due to how slippery it is. Additionally, the watermelon also isn't very crunchy so the two textures don't mix well together. All in all, the appetizers were both forgettable.\n\nMain Course:\n\nThe Chicken Milanese was basically $22 fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The sad thing is that the flavors aren't much better. I am probably committing a cardinal sin but the mashed potatoes also taste like they were instant mashed potatoes. the consistency is consistently bumpy and the butter taste isn't very fresh. Additionally the chicken itself was a bit dry and the fried crust doens't stick very well. All in all, it's not that delicious.\n\nThe rabbit pasta was far more disappointing. It's basically a pile of random stuff in a soup with pasta in it. The sauce just does not have the right consistency to be called a sauce. The pasta itself looks like tape worms. There are sausages, meats, and ham-like meats and I have no idea which one of them was rabbit (might be all three). The flavors are okay, but the addition of whole olives made the dish taste kind of cheap. \n\nDesert:\n\nI had a berry sundae. Not much to see here.\n\nService:\n\nI hardly saw my waiter. Actually I did, I saw him after I left, probably thanking me for actually giving him a tip despite the fact he didn't do anything.\n\nIn the end, I'm fairly disappointed in this restaurant. I wouldn't return again.", "author": "Scott L."}

We heard such good things about garabaldi's and the reviews were so amazing, we decided to celebrate at this destination. We ordered croquettes and they were lukewarm which was so disappointing because the reviews were great. The Caesar was smaller than we had anticipated and it was not anything special. Once again, another disappointment in our meal. The restaurant was not busy, lunch crowd meandering in. Our water glasses were not refilled for quite some time after we quenched our thirst. We ordered another glass of champagne each and the glasses were taken from our table, refilled and brought back. You would think that at $15.50 a glass, a new glass should have been brought each time. We ended up having 3 glasses of champagne each and I would have hoped they could have suggested purchasing the bottle instead of being charged per glass. We asked for bread and the first bread presentation looked just like the plate that another guest had sent back. The second bread presentation was quite different. The halibut and cannelini beans was not hot and mediocre in taste and presentation. For dessert we ordered the profiteroles and they were not worth having. The entire experience was definitely not what we had in mind. We will not be back. There is no reason for this lack luster service and food, especially when the restaurant was not busy.

The mere fact that she challenged a customer was discomforting and questionable. Next our food arrived...my husband ordered the Filet Mignon and I the Orecchiette, no one asked him to cut into his steak to see if it was as he ordered, nor did anyone return within the next 15 minutes to see if we were pleased with our selections. My entree lacked seasoning and my husband had to get the attention of Katie requesting some parmesan, pepper and a glass of wine...very poor customer service...and she never returned to check on use even though she was servicing both table on each side of our table.\n\n The table services person came over as my husband completed his meal and asked to take his plate and asked if I was completed with my meal or would I like to take mine to go. I replied \"no\" he asked if I liked the entree and I told him \"no\". After he left then our waitress Katie appeared (at the end of the meal, at least 45 minutes since the food had arrived) to say she was sorry about the meal and asked if I would like something else...which I replied 'NO'.  Yes, she took it off of our check, but the fact is I did not have any dinner because of such unbelievably poor service.

Seating at the bar is pretty limited (about 8 or so chairs), so get in early if you're planning on having drinks and appetizers anyway. Nice selection of beers, including bottles from a couple local breweries. \n\n----Food breakdown----\n* Appetizer duet of risotto croquettes and chicken liver pate ($6.50/HH): \nFour croquettes come in a blanket of tomato coulis (fancy word for thick tomato sauce) and fontina; nice, crunchy coating but nothing worth reordering in the future. The chicken liver pate is molded with red wine gelee on top, served with crostini, coarse-ground dijon mustard and pickled fennel; the flavors were familiar but didn't mesh well together (and I tried every possible combination: pate+gelee+dijon+fennel, pate+dijon, pate+fennel, pate+gelee, gelee+fennel, and so on... no luck). \n\n* Marinated lamb tenderloin ($31.50): TASTIEST LAMB I'VE EVER HAD, and one of the best things I've eaten in quite some time. Marinated in Moroccan spices, each bite was so flavorful, succulent and juicy. Even though it was slightly overcooked (ordered medium, arrived medium-well), it didn't stop me from sneaking forkful after forkful of it from my bf's plate. Sides of couscous and romano beans completed the dish, although they faded into the background and were unable to compete with the lamb.\n\n* Farmer's market menu ($29.95): Prix fixe menu consisting of an appetizer, entree and dessert, inspired by local ingredients. \n-- APP // An arugula salad topped with crunchy breadcrumb-coated chevre medallions provided a simple yet satisfying start. The wildflower honey drizzle (when inquired, was revealed to be from Marshall Farms) was a stunning addition. I need a bottle STAT!\n-- ENTREE // Pork shoulder braised to tender perfection. The meat was lightly seasoned, allowing the porkiness to shine on its own. Served on a bed of thinly sliced polenta and sprinkled with tangy pomegranate seeds, the dish was elegant, though the flavors were almost too restrained to be committed to memory.\n-- DESSERT // Rich, decadent, silky chocolate mousse with two freshly fried Italian doughnuts. As a dessert-shunning man, the bf heralded this as the best part of the FMM. The mousse was indulgent but surprisingly light; the doughnuts crisp, hot and fluffy.\n\nGaribaldi's would get 3.5 stars were it not for the phenomenal lamb...

Starting with the appetizer to the main course and finishing it off with the dessert, the names and descriptions of the food were not the only things that were delicious. The food was to die for. The crowd that generally comes in is a lot of mid-age 30 and 30+. My date and I felt definitely out of place being the only 21 year olds. The wine selection is wide too. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is very lovely. Very posh and elegant minus the bathrooms which are squished in the back of the restaurant. Literally, the space was so tiny and dark. The place itself is pretty narrow. There is a bar on one side and tables on the other; fits about 40 people max? The neighborhood/community in which the place is located is a very posh neighborhood. Very cute townhomes. I am definitely coming back here and explore the other items on the menu.", "author": "D S."}

Used the friendly valet parking ($10).  The hostess wasn't particularly friendly. \"Do you have a reservation?\" was the extent of the greeting. \nTable for four was in a decent location and the waiter was quick to offer drinks.  In the hour+ we were there the restaurant filled up, obviously the place to be!  Started out with a grilled calamari appetizer which was large enough for the four of us.\nFour different entrees at our table. Salmon, filet mignon, pork chop, and chicken. All the entrees were presented well, were hot and given a decent sized portion.  The filet was served with oyster mushrooms which added nothing to the great tasting steak. Service was attentive and not intrusive. Liked the restaurant fine but wished there had been more choices on the menu. One pork dish, one chicken dish, one seafood dish, etc...get the point?

Over priced by about 20%, which is the main reason for the 3-star vs 4.\n\nWe went with a couple of friends from out of town and it was expensive enough that I felt bad that I had brought that but wasn't treating. I could have done some more homework before bringing them, but the type of food doesn't warrant the prices. The saving grace for me was the set menu offered for dinner, which gets you an app, very basic entree (baked ziti, for me, which probably had $4 of ingredients but was delicious), and dessert for $30. \n\nThere was a huge, dead black fly on the surface of my ice water when the waitress set it on the table. And she didn't notice. I pointed it out when she came back and she just kind of laughed and said she'd get me another. Then left it there while she asked us if we wanted drinks, etc. I didn't want to make a big deal, but I expected a bigger deal to be made of it than that.

Apart from it being so much louder than normal we kept having to catch and hold our sparking water still every so often from being knocked over by the waiter standing in between the tables.\nWe went for date night because I was craving their chicken milanese dish. \nIts outstanding. I noticed that they were participating in Dine about town and usually in years past they menu has been extremely limited. This time it looked quite substantial so I thought maybe I would peruse the menu and see whether it was a better deal to order al a carte or the fixed menu. \nI had questions. \"What is the soup of the day?\" which was one of the first options. \nI was replied with \"its the same as on the main menu\" \"Everything is the same as the main menu\"\nI replied \"So what is the soup of the day?\"\nAgain replied the waiter \" Its the same as the main menu\" \nOn the main menu was written... SOUP OF THE DAY. It really felt like a scene from Dumb and Dumber. MMM soup de jour sounds yum Ill have one of those.\nMy husband asks \" What is the soup of the day?\" \nreplied with \" Leek and potato.\" \nWow it really took that long to get an answer. I should have asked the table next to us.\nI wouldn't have normally gotten a starter but I thought the Dine about town thing must be a better deal so why not.\nI started with the salad with pear an gorgonzola and it was great. Chicken for my main and then the Chocolate budino for desert. As it was pointed out several times to me when we were ordering EVERYTHING was the same as the main menu. But it wasn't.\nThey totally scammed us with the desert portion. I felt a little ripped off. The Chocolate Budino that my husband and I share every single time we go there had miraculously shrunk from regular size to a tiny little ramekin portion. \nWow what a deal.\nSalad $9.50\nChicken $21.50\nBudino $10 (real sized)\n= $41 \nApparently a savings of $6. I think not. No deal here.\nLooking at the menu online we were obviously given the petite Budino worth maybe $6 at best. So overall a savings of $2. Really?\nThe dine about town menu is great for restaurants trying to get people to spend more than they usually do and get less in the process. If you want a great Chicken dish then this is your place. But don't get conned into eating or spending more than you normally would.\n\nOn a side note, when the table on our left sat down to order and the lovely lady asked what the soup of the day was, it wasn't leek and potato, so who knows what it really was.", "author": "Melody M."}

(We had no trouble getting an 8:30 reservation for the same night.)  We were immediately seated by a friendly & welcoming hostess who also offered to take our jackets.  Within a few minutes of sitting down, we had water, bread, and some extremely tasty olive tapenade (which I had to restrain myself from devouring all of).\n\nInitially, we started with cocktails & all of us were very happy with our selections (Ginger Julep, The Right Thyme, and a vodka/pear drink that I can't remember the name of).  For appetizers, my boyfriend and I split the risotto croquettes & the grilled calamari.  The croquettes were pretty good but not amazing; the calamari was some of the best I've ever had - fresh, perfectly cooked, and very flavorful.  Our other friend ordered the 29.99 Farmer's Market menu; his heirloom tomato, cantaloupe, & frise salad was excellent.\n\nFor mains, I had the lamb tenderloin, which was also some of the best (if not *the* best) I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked, marinated in something absolutely delicious, and served with excellent couscous & a tasty sauce.  Also, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of lamb that showed up.  There were three good-sized chunks of meat, and as tasty as it was, I couldn't finish it all & was forced to pawn it off on my bf & friend (who were good sports & finished it up for me).\n\nMy bf had the duck confit, which was tender, lean (rare for duck), and also perfectly cooked, and served with some very tasty corn, tomatoes, & other veggies.  The Farmer's Market menu entree was a delicious, super-fresh pasta dish with lots of tasty veggies & bit of tasty meat (pancetta?  Not sure).  We were all very pleased with our selections  & there was much passing around of bites.  We hadn't intended to get wine, but it turned out they're running a wine promotion through labor day where all bottles are half off, so we decided to go with a bottle of Aglianico ($30 instead of $60), which was very good.\n\nThe Farmer's Market menu dessert was two scoops of fruit sorbet (one peach, one raspberry) and a ginger cookie, all of which was incredibly tasty (the peach sorbet was especially amazing).  My boyfriend had the hot toddy drink off the dessert menu, which was a bit disappointing - it didn't have as much flavor as we expected and was a bit watery.\n\nA couple of other notes - lots of reviews mentioned that the place is very loud and that the tables too close together.  I disagree.  I'd say the volume is about average for a SF dinner spot of that size, and we didn't have any trouble hearing each other or the server.  Also, the tables were about as close together as anywhere else in the city.  Not a problem at all.  Also, we had fabulous & friendly service all evening.  (And dude who said it was too hard to find & had to drive around the block 3 times before he saw it?  Not sure what your issue is.  The name of the place is written on the front window in huge block letters.)\n\nOverall, absolutely amazing.  Yes, it was a $250 meal between the three of us after tax and tip, but worth every penny.  Will definitely have to keep it in mind for future fancy dinners.", "author": "Angela B."}

From an interior standpoint, the place is quite nice and not overdone. It's comfortable and sleek. However, from a food and service standpoint, it was just ok. Total bummer because I was expecting some solid SF deliciousness. Service was fairly inattentive. Our server was nice but appeared totally detached. She asked one question that she repeated 3 times (which were the only times we saw her). \"how is everything...is there anything else you need?\" She wasn't there to get our order for our second round of drinks, and forgot about our appetizers, and it took like 20 minutes to get olives that we ordered when we were seated. Next, the food. For starters we shared a salad, which was a standard spring mix, then we ordered the burrata with toasted bread, and you can' t really go wrong with burrata. For a third app we ordered the grilled calamari with white beans. It was tasty but not exciting to eat. For dinner I was torn between the lamb tenderloins and the seared tuna. I went with the lamb, which was delicious, but the cous cous it was served with was dry....super super dry. Like corn meal texture dry. Unfortunately, the cous cous was also dry on my aunts order.

To this day it amazes me how she could speak so highly of the restaurant.  My husband & I walked into a half filled restaurant. As we were escorted to our table we kept walking and walking till we were at THE back of the restaurant.  There were only two tables of Asians in the entire restaurant, one being our table, and the other right next to us.  Can we say RACIAL PROFILING!!!  Normally I would ask to be moved before I even got to the back of the restaurant, but my folks didn't want to cause a scene since they had already been seated for ten minutes.  \n\nI started mumbling under my breath, but tried to make the best of it.   When the water was served, there was a bug floating around in my glass.  Our waitress sweetly apologized and got another glass for me.  After the food was served, my husband noticed that his steak was bloody raw and not the warm medium that he ordered.   I don't think I will ever be coming back to this place.  It was definitely one of THE worst dining experiences that I've had a really long time.  I have been using Yelp for a few years now and have finally been so distraught that I felt I must log in and write my first negative dining review.", "author": "Stacey L."}

My friend and I drove around the block at least 3 times before calling the restaurant asking for specific details about location. Tricky!\n\nInterior - dimly lit, very loud. Packed on a Saturday evening. Interesting pictures hanging on the walls.\n\nService - pretty good service. They gave us more bread/tapenade when we asked for it. A few of us got the wine pairing, and we had to remind our waitress for our second pairing. Knock one star...\n\nFood - DAT menu: no selection for each course, $29.99.  (Wine pairing add $12 for 2 glasses) Blood orange salad was nicely plated, tasty, very healthy. Entree was a clam linguini - by itself, I guess it was pretty flavorful, pasta was cooked al dente (but compared to food on the regular menu...was underwhelming). Dessert was chocolate budino (sp?) - really satisfying, with robust espresso ice cream on top, sprinkled with caramelized nuts. \n\nTwo friends ordered off the DAT menu - one got the chicken, the other the lamb. OMG. The lamb here is the best I've ever tasted. I've tried lamb before, and was never a big fan. This dish, however, was amazing. So incredibly tender, full of non-gamey flavor. Incredible. 5 stars for the lamb. The chicken was succulent and buttery, paired nicely with the mashed potatoes. In order of food, 1. lamb. 2. chicken. 3. linguini with clams.\n\nI'd come back here just for the lamb.", "author": "Carol L."}

Had a reservation so can't comment on the wait, but the place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. We were seated immediately, even though we were early, and all the servers were very friendly. Service was good, absolutely no complaints, and it was amazing how much they DIDN'T rush you. Even at other nice restaurants I always feel to some degree they'd like to keep you moving (makes sense, but still). \n\nAs for the food, I can't say enough good things about the portions. I guess I'm in the minority (I like the think the silent majority) in that I don't think paying more should mean getting less food. It doesn't make the food tastier, it doesn't make the restaurant classier, and it doesn't make sense (You're paying for ambiance, service, location and food, and I know nicer restaurants use better quality foods, but there is no way that paying $30 means they can only afford to serve you 6 oz of meat). Anyways, Garibaldi's doesn't fall into this category. AND, the food was good. We liked 3 of the 4 things we got, and I can't say the 4th wasn't tasty, it just wasn't what we liked. Here's what we ate:\n\nSummer Tomatoes (Starter) - Awesome. It made a great appetizer. \n\nCalamari (Starter) - Awesome again. Delicious calamari, good sauce, and again, a good portion. \n\nBucatini Puttanesca (Main) - This was the one thing we weren't a huge fan of. It was very olive'y, and just had a lot going on, but certainly nothing wrong with it. Just not for us. \n\nChicken Milanese (Main) - Back to being awesome. This was actually far and away the best. Chicken was great, the crust was awesome, and the mashed potatoes matched. \n\nWould definitely recommend this place. It's well above average in all categories.", "author": "Patrick M."}

It lacked flavor, and it came to the table cold.  The restaurant also did not offer any entree choices like other participating DAT restaurants do.  Had I based my review solely on the DAT menu, this restaurant would have received a 2-star review.\n\nHowever, my husband ordered the Lamb Tenderloin (not on the DAT menu), and it was fantastic.  It was the best piece of lamb I've ever tasted.   I wish I had deviated and ordered this instead.  My other friend ordered the chicken breast which was very flavorful as well.\n\nDine About Town lures new patrons in to try restaurants and foods they may not always try otherwise.  I think that if you participate in this program, you really should put your best food forward to make people want to come back again.  Garibaldi's is lucky that our party deviated from the DAT menu because otherwise, none of us would ever come back.

Meatball sized fried balls that just ooze steam and cheese when you cut into them with a fork.\n- Chicken breast milanese: huge portion, great thickness (not too thick not too thin), lightly fried with an herb breadcrumb crust. A simple dish perfected. \n- Carrot soup: pure pureed carrots. Loved that there wasn't any cream. Had a bit of nutmeg taste too it so almost pumpkin soupy in a bowl.\n- Halibut: was worried when it came out pure white, as I'm used to seeing color from it seared or baked a bit, but the pure fresh flavor was there when I bit into it. Nice sized thick piece and came with herbed spaetzel which was different and I liked cause it reminded me of our Germany trip last year. ;-)\n- Dessert: not sure what it was called but it was really fantastic! A big bowl of coffee ice cream with chocolate and crunchy hazelnuts. Sounds basic but it really shined.\n- Limoncello: my fave surprise of the evening. Just like when you're in Italy, we were presented with a little tall shot glass full of house made limoncello. Awesome! Sealed the deal for this place and I being good friends.\n- Excellent service: from the hostess to the bartender to the waitress, all were pure professionals. Bartender was friendly while masterfully mixing and serving up cool drinks. Waitress was knowledgeable about their food and wine and did things like fold up lap napkins when someone got up and slip in a glass of wine on the table to not interrupt conversation.\n- Deals: even without dine about town going on, they have a regular 3 course set meal for $29.95 listed in the top right corner. Even ordering off the main menu was affordable for a nice SF resturant.\n- Nice drink menu: I had one with muddled strawberries and champagne and the hub had a pineapple infused martini (he's a beer guy but was trying to be nice to me so I could try both).

I can't stop thinking about it!  \n\nDinner at Garibaldi's on Friday night was a pleasure all around.  The restaurant is intimate and romantic, and a little dressy, which I liked.  It's very \"adult\" - no one here cares about trends or popularity - and you can tell that they have spent years honing their skills both in the kitchen and with the service.  They make sure you have everything you want, only making suggestions when asked, and taking extra care that the meal goes smoothly and seamlessly.\n\nSince we were going to a party afterwards, we just had cocktails rather than wine.  My friend had a Lavender Martini, and I had the Garibaldi's Salty Dog.  Both were wonderful and I am curious to try the other libations on the menu - another time, for sure.\n\nSince neither of us had been there before, my friend and I decided to try a sampler of every item on the antipasti platter, which consisted of:  dates stuffed with bleu cheese, in balsamic vinegar with chopped pistachios, proscuitto, brushetta, and lemon basil hummus with crostini.  This was a very nice introduction into the Cal-Med cooking - and all items were delicious, with our absolute favorite being the dates.\n\nWe both wanted the same thing for dinner - the Ravioli.  Usually when someone orders what I want, I order something different just so that we can taste both, but we both REALLY wanted the ravioli.  We were so glad we did - we were both members of the Clean Plate Club after dinner!

Marinated lamb tenderloins in a tarragon sauce are exquisite, as are the pistachio couscous and haricots vert served with them, but again there's not enough of any of it to make the dish worth $29.95.

Both times on the company's dime.  The restaurant is in Laurel Heights, the one neighborhood that I never ever find myself in -- so it's a bit out of the way.  And each time I go, the food is good but hardly memorable.  I tried the turkey club on foccacia bread with avacado during my last visit and it was really tasty, but it came with the parsnip soup which was horrid.  Absolutely horrid.  But maybe that was my fault for going with the soup of the day without knowing really what I was going for...  \n\nThis is definitely a place where power lunches are to be had.  The decor was fancy, the atmosphere a bit pretentious, and the service was professional but also a bit disconnected?  As if the waiters are used to being ignored by the very important people who dine there...who are obviously having very important conversations.

I've been there several times for dinner and have never been served a meal that was less than exceptional.\n\nLast night, my BF and I started the evening early (6pm) with some simple cocktails:  Guavacita (tequila & guava-based lowball) & French Kiss (lemon vodka & White Lillet martini).  The drinks were delicious, but I have a complaint ... they don't have an option to get them by the pitcher!   ;)\n\nThe chef seemed to have a thing for lemon (in a good way).  We chose for our antipasti the marinated white beans & olives and lemon basil hummus.  Served with crostini, both dishes were perfectly prepared.  The beans were firm and lemony and contrasted nicely with the saltiness of the calamatas.  For basil lovers, the lemon in the hummus might be a little overpowering for your tastes ... still, the microgreens were a nice touch and it worked over all.\n\nThe bacon-roasted pork tenderloin, braised red lentils, zucchini and gruyere fondutta was awesome.  Pig on pig.  How can it fail?  The lentils seemed to have a subtle white wine vinegar flavor that livened up the meatiness of the pork. \n\nThe chicken breast Milanese, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, arugula with white wine-caper sauce is my favorite when I'm in the mood for \"comfort food\".  It's dressed up a bit to look appetizing: hearty enough for a lumber jack and pretty enough for a princess.\n\nYou cannot leave Garibaldi's without indulging in their Chocolate Budino.  Have you ever had an orgasm served to you in a bowl with two spoons?  I'm sure that the devil himself assembles these back there in the kitchen.

So effin' awesome!!\n\nTIPS: Make a reservation through OpenTable.com and collect some points.\nIf you can't find a parking spot, they have valet service.\nService is more attentive earlier in the evening before the place gets jam-packed (although ... it's always adequate or better).", "author": "Jenny K."}

We were looking forward to a fun night out and through a slight expense account loophole like plan, we were eating on the company dime.  Alright, it ended up being the company's Benjamin's (six of them to be exact, oops) so in light of this we had really our pick of anywhere in the city to go but we ended up here.  For the amount of money we spent, I really regret this decision now.\n\nI was really disappointed. First of all, our service was poor and very slow. Our reservations were at 8:30 and we left at 11:30. We had several courses - cocktails, apps, salad, entree, cheese and dessert but nothing that warranted a full three hours. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time. She took our order and then returned 30 minutes later to tell us the rack of lamb was not available. She delivered this news like it was our fault. \n\nOur apps were blah and bland and not worth too many sentences. The griddled mancheco was the highlight, but think fancy grilled mozzarella sticks.\n\nSalad was salad. Mine had basically no dressing on it. Is there a new minimalist movement in salads I should know about?\n\nEntrees were good but uninspired and boring. Chicken, lamb (shanks not the rack!) and halibut were the choices all around and there was nothing exciting to rave about. Just ok. \n\nWe had dessert but  by that point I had a bunch of cocktails in me (funny, I remember those)  and its been a few days so I can't remember what we ordered. It wasn't memorable, martinis or no martinis.\n\nThe company was fantastic and the restaurant was surprisingly lively for a Friday night in our quiet hood-o-families so that made up for the blah food.

Ugh. I'm gonna have to go talk to Joe from Accountemps about this one. \n\nRandomly, some nice, older Pac Heights bazilionaire type couple sent our table a round of tequila shots midway through our meal.

I had the pomegranate martini, the gf had some champagne cocktail.  Whatever, you are not going to impress me with drinks alone.\n\nFirst off, we both loved the olive oil infused with something spicy.  Red pepper maybe with chunks of olives and goodness all around.  So we started to fill up on bread but then the appetizer came, meatballs.  Really tasty.  They had a bit of fennel in them so approached the Italian sausage taste, which if you read my yelps, know I am not a fan of but the flavor was not overwhelming and thus not offensive.  We ended up asking for more bread to sop up all the marinara sauce the meatballs were served in. \n\nWe split the chopped salad which perhaps was chopped a bit more than I would like but it had bits of bleu cheese and goodness all the way through.  I dug it big time.\n\nFor entrees: gf had the filet, which had a flavor of mesquite like it was cooked on a backyard bbq.  It was served with an au gratin slab o' potatoes, which was also good.  One complaint, it was ordered medium rare and came out medium to medium well.  I may have sent it back but the gf didn't bother.\n\nI had the lamb medium rare, it came out that way so no worries on my part.  It tasted almost Mediterraneanly spiced sitting on a bed of nicely cooked green beans and couscous.  The sauce around the plate tasted like pure butter but was amazing with everything that we dipped in it.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because I had gluttonous plans to go to Bill's Place to split a peanut butter shake.\n\nA number of people complained about the cost of this place, my response to them: SACK UP.

The atmosphere is nice, lively, and skews towards an older crowd.  The place was also filled with cheesy balloons, but I'll let that slide since it was NYE.  Our pre-dinner cocktails were both well made (Manhattan for me, cosmo for her), so I'd have no complaints about coming here for a few drinks before my reservation next time.

A salad of mixed greens, walnuts, persimmon, and crumbled cheese is a welcome way to start a meal.\n\nIt's been so long since I've had fried chicken.  The chicken here is properly fried, not at all greasy, and moist within.  It's accompanied by mashed potatoes and brocolli florets.

I was told how incredible this restaurant is and I was looking forward to it.  Unfortunately I won't be going back.\n\nThe restaurant's is long and narrow with the second half up a short flight of steps.  The front half has dining on the left and a bar area on the right, each separated by a glass half partition.  The decor was boring and uninspiring.\n\nI went to the men's room when we first arrived and encountered the smallest sink I think I've ever seen at a restaurant.  It was square and measured maybe 10\" x 10\".  It was so small that the pipes (complete with tape wrapped around them) caught my eye more than the sink.  My next concern was that I was going to splash water all over myself with such a small sink.  And right next to the sink was a paper half towel dispenser.  The same kind you can find in any chain restaurant.  There is zero decor in the men's restroom and seemed to be completely forgotten in regards to the dining experience.   \n\nRight after we got there someone ordered a desert that had two cinnamon sticks sticking out of it.  They were lit on fire and smoldering, and when they went past there was the smell of smoke with an aroma of burned cinnamon.  I've never seen this before and was at first intrigued by the artistry and uniqueness of the desert.  When the cinnamon was blown out it left a hideous aroma of burned cinnamon that went quickly from interesting to obnoxious.  Someone ordered another of these deserts and the aroma was now terrible.  I have no idea if this is a signature of Garibaldi's or an experiment but I understand now why I've never seen it anywhere before.  It doesn't work.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered buratta, calamari, and steak tar-tar.  The presentation on the steak tar-tar was nice but there was too much steak and it was boring in taste.  The calamari was excellent and the only highlight of the meal.  The calamari was not breaded and it might have been grilled, I don't remember.  It was wonderful.  The buratta was a huge disappointment.  It came with four pieces of overly toasted bread, two of which were burned that we didn't need replaced, and each piece was about one inch thick.  And there was only about two or three tablespoons of buratta and there was no taste whatsoever in the buratta.  The bread was dry and large there wasn't enough buratta to do anything about it.  The buratta at A16 is incredible and I a hoped that Garibaldi's might be similar, but no.\n\nFor entr\u00e9e's we had the chicken and the salmon.  The salmon was not cooked and we sent it back.  We were too disappointed with everything to have it replaced.  The chicken was breaded breast over arugula and mashed potatoes with some sort of caper sauce.  There was no presentation with the chicken; just two huge pieces of chicken layered on top of each other on top of mashed potatoes with arugula on the side.  Thought the chicken was cooked well the breading wasn't seasoned and the entre wasn't pleasurable to eat, more like a chore.\n\nThe only time we eat sweets is to order desert and pair it.  There were about five choices of deserts and each was ice cream based.  No thanks.\n\nThough the patrons there seemed to be having a good time I wonder if their experience was similar to ours or we just caught Garibaldi's on a bad night.  Either way  we won't be going back.", "author": "Kevin P."}

On the flip side, the happy hour is not really \"happy,\" in that the prices are not reduced and you can only get the happy hour small plates at the bar.

I wouldn't quite call it to all that extreme... I've been to really \"fancy schmancy\" places, where it is stuffy and quite uncomfortable. I would describe it as where you would want to be aware of your manners, as you should anywhere else. \n\nThe service we received was quite welcoming and sincere from us walking in to saying our goodbye. The food is very good and well presented. But I don't think there's anything on the menu were I would consider to make Garibaldi unique amongst other SF restaurants. \n\nI had the chicken breast milanese. To me, the dish is a pretty big portion but I am not complaining. The chicken was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly to match the mash potatoes and the arugula. Which I wouldn't mind having more of the arugula. \n\nMy coworkers had ordered the linguine and the scallops. Both plates looked very tasty to where I would like to go back to try those dishes. Overall the meals were very good and priced at what you would get back. \n\nEnjoy.", "author": "Long T."}

Yes, my parents share the same birthday, very odd. This place was perfect for a family dinner. The atmosphere is quiet, intimate and very classy. The service was excellent and very attentive.\n\nThe menu was very \"Californian Traditional.\" You could find your basic chicken, beef, and fish offerings. Nothing on the menu was that exciting. Honestly, it sounded very boring. \n\nSince I had a pretty late lunch, I wasn't too hungry and ended up ordering two small plates. I started with the salmon tartare with creme fraiche and crispy toast. It was good, but not outstanding. Then I had the chopped salad with chicken. The salad was mixed with greens, broccoli, cauliflower, pumpkin seeds and blue cheese. Nice combination of veggies. \n\nAs the entrees came, I would have to say the lamb cutlets were the highlight. The 3 juicy, tender cutlets were served over couscous. My parents both had the short ribs and they were tender and moist. My brother in law had the sole, which was prepared very nicely in taste and texture. Overall, the food was good.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the spice cake with creme fraiche, which was quite disappointing. The cake was not moist. After one taste, you can tell it was pre-made and kept in the fridge for a while. \n\nI'm glad I finally got the chance to dine at Garibaldi's, but I probably wouldn't make this place a destination.", "author": "Denise L."}

Our server was so nice and answered many of our questions with a very friendly response, not the I-have-another-table-to-get-to response.

This time, I was part of a party of six, which just also happens to be when they chip in the automatic gratuity.  Coincidence?  I hope so.\n\nAlthough we were seated right away, it took about 30 minutes to have our order taken.  Then, it took another 45 mins or so to get our food, even though 4 of us ordered the exact same thing!!  However, once we did have our food it was so good that the wait was forgotten.

My pre-fixe was a bagna cauda (I didn't think I would stumble on this in the US, it is fresh vegetables with olive oil and anchovies) and mushroom risotto.  The meal was delicious.  I had a taste of my husband's citrus salad too, and it was heavenly.\n\nThe best thing though, about this place, is the service.  Our server was super nice and very accomodating, for example, my husband changed his salad order (from Garibaldi to Citrus) 3 min after the server had taken the order.  But he did not say that he couldn't change it, he rushed immediately to the kitchen to change it!  So nice.  There were many other things where he was flexible and tried his best to make the most out of our evening.

It's the kind of restaurant I would definitely frequent if I lived a bit closer.  You know, because I'm so sophisticated, yet warm.\n\nComing from SoMa, I drove and found parking easily.  But you know how it is; if you drive, you allow yourself only one drink, if any at all.  And I'm not one to feel guilty over my preference to have bounties of wine with a nice meal.  So this time I was stuck with just one drink, but next time it's someone else's turn to drive.\n\nThere were five of us, which makes trying several selections easy.  To start, we had a nicely dressed Caprese salad (with bufala mozzarella, my fav), a watermelon/olive salad (interesting, fun), meatball soup (packed some heat w/whole chili peppers in the soup), crostini with delish spread and fried balls of wonder (that's not the name; I just can't recall whether they were mozzarella or what).  Oh--and green beans with pancetta, which fulfilled both my bacon and veggie quotas for the day. Everything we shared for the first course was solid.\n\nAfter endless recommendations to try the lamb, that's what I chose for my main course.  A-m-a-z-i-n-g.  Just get it.  And get it rare.  Mmmmm.\n\nFor dessert, we shared 3 dishes:  a pine nut tart (their version of a pecan pie), a raspberry crumble and an amazing caramel brownie sundae.  I recommend the pine nut tart and the sundae--both really good.\n\nThe service was impeccable, the food perfect and the ambiance inviting.  I highly recommend going on a date or as a group.

We didn't have reservations but the hostess suggested we try waiting for a seat at the bar. 15 minutes later a couple of seats at the bar opened up and we sat down and ordered some drinks. The bartender was a little bit perplexed that my date ordered a fruity drink, and kept asking us whether he made the right drink, and we had to keep assuring him that he did. I was a bit disappointed to realize that they only serve appetizers and drinks at the bar, so we asked the hostess to let us know when a seat became open in the dining room. 15 minutes later a seat opened up and we sat in the little backroom which was a lot less noisy than the front room.\n\nThe crowd in the room was definitely older, and there seemed to be a lot of couples, gay to straight. It was fun to people watch.\n\nAs our entree, we ordered the seabass and filet mignon. The food was excellent, both the fish and filet were cooked to perfection. We ordered desserts, duo sorbets and chocolate budino. I couldn't finish the budino on my own, but it was delicious. Basically tasted like strong espresso ice cream on top of flourless chocolate cake. The sorbet was definitely homemade as I tasted pieces of the green apple (more like sour applie) and mango (could've been another fruit, I forget). It was good if you like sorbet.\n\nAfter they took our desserts away, they handed us a neon shot of something. I took a sip and it tasted like a really strong lemon drop. I don't know about you, but I don't normally take vodka shots right after a full meal, so I had to deduct points for that call. sorry.\n\nOverall, the food was excellent, just pass on the neon alcoholic shot at the end. :)", "author": "cynthia b."}

It is a predominately italian-inspired menu but there are many other flavors to be had.  The lamb is well spoken for in these reviews and certainly lives up to expectations.  Their filet is top-notch.  I ordered pan seared salmon which was expertly cooked.  There are certain kitchens in this city that just know how to cook fish and this is one of them.  \n\nMy second time here was for a small dinner at the bar for happy hour.

It was a temporary farewell dinner because this week she had jaw surgery. So we wanted to make sure that she had very good (and crunchy) food.\n\nWe had a reservation but still had to wait for about 10 minutes, which wasn't too bad except the bar was full so there was nowhere for the 6 of us to stand. We were seated at a table in the back and I weaseled my way to the booth. I like the inside! But karma, the booth wasn't so comfortable. It would've been great for lounging and watching tv but the seats sank! I found myself constantly having to adjust and by the end of the meal I was lower than the people in chairs across from me.\n\nService felt slow. But it wasn't. I think Garibaldi's has some strange time warp. We were there for about 2 hours and chatting and enjoying ourselves the entire time. It was not an abnormal amount of time I was just disoriented. I blame the booth.\n\nOn to the good stuff: food! My roommate and I shared a caesar with very crunchy croutons. It was really good. Could've used a little more anchovy in the dressing but good for our breath. We all shared calamari. The sauce was really good but the rings were mostly breading. I really liked the jalapenos though. I love spicy. The main courses were almost all great. I had the Chicken Milanese. I didn't really like it. It was nice and moist but I just didn't dig the panko flakes. The mashed potatoes and spinach were fantastic though. Ooh! And the citrus burre blanc sauce with capers was great.\n\nI thought the decor was nice.

It's the quintessential neighborhood go-to place for a nice dinner. If you can't think of anything else and have a guest in town, dinner with a business associate or a 3rd date, Garibaldi's never fails. This a place that caters to all age groups who simply want a great meal without emptying their wallets completely.\n\nThis July I especially enjoyed their farmer's prix fixe menu -- to die for. After a few appetizers (which were awesome), we received the tasting portions. I asked the waiter if they accidentally brought us two tastings by mistake, but they didn't! They almost doubled it at no charge. We also had a few glasses of wine which were healthy pours in the bigger glasses they have there (usually they only give you those if you bring a bottle). \n\nNow, October is upon us with a new chef and new staff and things have changed. The original, traditional menu items you could have depended on were missing and their menu changes nightly now (why, oh, why?). \n\nAnyway, I ordered the pork last visit and was not impressed at all. For $28 I got an overcooked piece of pork (poorly cut, too), dry rice, some charred grapes, a weak pour on a $12 wine (Napa does better!) and a half-decent salad. Not to mention the tasting menu for October was not of the least bit interesting -- maybe I'll try the Autumn special and hopefully my review will go back to being 4 stars.\n\nGaribaldi's where have you gone -- you're ready for some change!* \n\n*No presidential candidate has endorsed this message.", "author": "Tom W."}

The food was first-class, in portions and in level of attention and cooking  Perhaps we didn't thoroughly read menu, as my guest found the lamb seasoning to be extremely overwhelming and a bit sweet (very Middle East tasting)--maybe a better description on the menu?  or taper back on the herbs?

Laurel Heights is a trek, especially coming from the Mission. But it is so worth it. Garibaldi's oozes charm and sophistication, a place you want to save for a very important date, or to celebrate a special occasion with friends and family. There is a confidence in how Garibaldi's operates, and you immediately know you are in very capable hands.\n\nAnd those capable hands are definitely doing some of their best work in the kitchen. As you've read, dessert was fantastic. So was everything else. We started with a few appetizers, with the watermelon salad, sweet corn soup, green beans and meatballs each being standouts. This is definitely where going with a group was helpful - we sampled a bit of everything\n\nFor the main course I went with the halibut, which was surrounded by black rice, corn and peas in a tomato sauce. This was a choice I do not regret. Simply outstanding. And there were no complaints from around the table, with the lamb being a particular favorite.\n\nFull disclosure - a good friend of mine is sous chef, which no doubt had me biased towards enjoying everything.

Our reservation was for 6:15, but we arrived early and sat and enjoyed a few cocktails beforehand. The four of us each got one of their specialty cocktails (with the exception of my Dad, who heaven forbid will stray from his pre-dinner Absolute-over.)  My favorite drink was actually my mom's blood-orange cosmo, which was not too sweet or syrupy but looked and tasted delicious. The margarita was simple but good too, served in a deep martini glass. Warm French bread and olive oil with chopped olives was served with our drinks, and might have been one of my favorite parts of the meal...rich, warm and pure Italian comfort food. \n\nOverall the service and timing was great, we wanted to take out time and they let us. We sat at a table in the back room which had nice lighting and less noise than the front of the house. They sat 4 or 5 other tables near us in the back room throughout our meal, although their chatter didn't interfere with our conversation. Dcor is sophisticated but comfortable--you can easily show up in jeans or dress clothes and feel appropriate either way.\n\nMy boy got the prix fix special menu that had a theme from Spain - endive and tuna confit and escarole salad, chicken and shrimp paella, and then a flan-like orange flavored dish with butter cookies for dessert. Good flavors and price ($30). My dad got the Petrole fish, which was buttery and delicious, probably my favorite dish. My mom got the pasta which was served in a giant plate/bowl, and seemed to be the backroom favorite as we saw 4 more pasta dishes being served while we ate. I tried the char, which I learned was a mix between trout and salmon. It was served with an apple cider glaze and apple shavings on top, and some spinachy greens and potatoes on the bottom. I was a little hesitant to try, since prefer sushi salmon over grilled, but the fish was a lot milder than salmon and went perfect with the apple cider glaze. Not sure if it's a regular dish on the menu, but I'd recommend along with the Petrole.  \n\nWine wise, we ordered the Samantha Starr Pinot Noir from Monterey. When I say \"we\" I really mean \"I\" because for some reason I'm usually handed the menu and given wine-ordering task. For all I know about wine, I could have thrown a dart at the menu and thought another bottle was just as good as ours, but for $42 a bottle this one really was--everyone seemed happy and since I took the wine ordering responsibility, I also welcomed the compliments on my grand refined taste and selection...any day! \n\nJust as she dropped off the check, our server also gave us complimentary shots of lemon cello, which was a perfect way to end the meal...and have an excuse to go home early and crash...that stuff is some tasty lemon-flavored fire water. With the taste of lemon cello and a feeling of food coma sinking in, it was a little like being in Italy again.", "author": "Kelly R."}

The portion should have been bigger and I would have appreciated some veggies .  \n As entrees I ordered the Lamb Tenderloins.  While lamb is not something I frequently order, this rated in the top three lamb dishes I have ever order.  The green beans were outstanding and the couscous was a great base.\n My girlfriend ordered the tuna, which was again, delicious, but the star of the plate was the spaetzle.

Garibaldi's has a sleek/modern business casual feel, but the restaurant still maintains a very comfortable environment.  Can actually work for a date (although I would not really classify it as romantic) or business.  Nice bar when you walk in to enjoy a drink before dinner, but wouldn't recommend as a place to hang out or be seen with friends. \n \nService: 2.5 Stars.  Don't let my 2.5 stars turn you off from going here, it is just that the service really isn't that great.  No extras, they come take your order, bring your food, pour your wine, and all with a smile.  However, I expect a little more interaction from an establishment like this, maybe some recommendations off the menu, a little background on the chefs approach/style, etc.  Everything in this category was very average, kind of what you would expect from a diner.  If you know what you like off the menu and wine list you will not be unhappy, but don't expect a lot of value add.  It could be that we had a new waitress, but still I would expect they would have someone helping that could fill in the blanks.\n \nFood: 3 stars.  Apps were actually a little disappointing, the salads were a little plain and lacked any unique flavors.  They weren't bad, just didn't leave any impression.  We did have one good app, some toscana salami with pomegranate salad.  It was very tasty and flavor combination was really great, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  However, it was teeny tiny, which I don't mind personally, but I know people that get really turned off by this.  Entrees, were better. The short ribs were good, not the best but very solid. They were cooked to perfection, and fell off the bone and melted in the mouth.  The beet risotto with goat cheese is great, and unique, definitely worth trying. I found it less rich than most risottos, but yet it was as satisfying and flavorful.  However, the highlight was the lamb tenderloin.  This had to be some of the best lamb I have tasted in a long time.  Perfectly cooked and not overshadowed by a thick sauce or too much seasoning.  Basically the Apps were a 2, the entrees a 4, hence my 3 for this category.\n \nWine: 3.5 stars.  I actually brought in my own wine, but I did take a very close look at the wine list.  Nearly four stars here, I felt they had a great variety at decent price points.   Strong for California selections, but also some decent choices from Southern France (Rhone valley, etc).  Corkage was a very fair $20.  I think what could make the list better would be to have some stuff with a little more age on it, that would be better drinking right now.  Most of the menu is newer vintages that could use 30min + decanting/air time.  If I were to go again I would probably not bring my own wine as I felt there were enough interesting items represented on their list to take a shot at.\n \nOverall: 3.5 stars.  Garibaldi's is a really solid place, however what is keeping me back from a higher rating is fairly plain service and food I found a bit uninteresting or unimpressionable.  I guess the best way to put it is, I feel in no rush to eat there again, but plan on returning at some point.  If you live in Presidio Heights or nearby, its worth checking out, but you could be a bit disappointed if you make a trek from outside the city.", "author": "Scott P."}

Food was very salty but okay (the filet actually was very good), wine selection is limited, and there is absolutely nothing spectacular when it comes to the service....yawn.\n\nThe really disappointing part was when we couldn't convince the unsuspecting bday boy to order dessert, the waitress put a candle in another persons dessert at the table instead.  It was fun watching him blow out his candle, looking totally confused and then forced to hand the dessert back to the person who ordered it.  Oh and did I mention the bill was over $400?  And you couldn't even put a scoop of ice cream in a bowl for the birthday boy?  Yes Miss Manager, I understand it is not your \"policy\" to give desserts for bdays, we weren't asking for much, just not to be embarassed.  Even an apology would have been nice instead of your defensive attitude.  \nMy family is in the restaurant business, and I know you can have the best meal in the world but without good service a customer may never come back.  However, with a decent meal and superior service, people will always return.  \nNeedless to say, we won't be coming back here.  \n0 stars for service if I could \n3 stars for food (would be 4 if they lost some of the salt)", "author": "stacy h."}

The menu looked great - and our cocktails were pretty fantastic, but sadly, that's where it ends. My appetizer was fine - nothing to write home about (I mean, how can you go wrong with burrata, tomatoes and crostini?). But my salmon was bad - all bad. Definitely overcooked, and the sauce it came with was not the right flavor for the fish...it was overly sweet and I could barely eat more than a few bites before feeling nauseous. For dessert we ordered sorbets - come to find out they had to substitute in a flavor as they were out of one - and it was the worst part of the meal. Both tasted like soap. It's SORBET.

We've had so many great meals here, it's hard to even decide which dishes to mention. The fish is always one of the best dishes of the night, whatever the preparation or catch - salmon, bass, sole, whatever. I adore the broccolini - super salty and saucy with bits of pancetta. The risotto croquettes are unforgettable, all crispy on the outside and oozy and gooey on the inside. And the entrees have such attention to detail, even the sides are outstanding.

I am so thrilled that Garibaldis is just two blocks from my work, making it a convenient 'work lunch place.' The atmosphere is very classy yet modern, good for a work lunch or an intimate date because it is quiet.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the tropical salad with grilled prawns, pomelo, grapefruit, orange, mango, avocado, radicchio, citrus vinaigrette. My salad was beautiful- all the fruit was perfectly ripe and the juices blended nicely. A spoon would have been handy to sip the juices up with. I loved the texture/flavor combinations of avocado with shrimp and the fruits. It was refreshing and not heavy. My co-worker ordered the marinated lamb tenderloin salad, with pistachio couscous, tomatoes, green beans and field greens. I tasted it- it was wonderful. The lamb was tender and the pistachio flavor was strong but not overpowering. Highly recommend both these dishes.\n\nNow, for the most important part- dessert (which I find, is hard to impress me with usually). We ordered the lemon Panna Cotta with fresh blueberries & shortbread cookies. Not usually a huge fan of this dish because it's not really dessert if it has fruit (too healthy!), but I thought it was okay- not too sweet, though it would have been nice to put blueberries at the bottom of the dish for a little surprise (gotta enjoy the seasonal fruite while it's ripe). The Chocolate Budino was delicious- warm gooey chocolate cake with espresso gelato, caramel sauce, topped with hazelnuts & almonds. Oh. My. God. This dessert SPOKE TO ME. Unfortunately, I had to be polite and share with my co-workers when all I really wanted to do was lick the bowl.  I mean seriously, can we just discuss the heavenly combination of chocolate, espresso, caramel and prailine? And the portion was generous. I hate when places act all pretentious with their 2 bite desserts- it's not an amuse bouche fools!!!\n\nI love when places really get the basics right- the menu here is seasonal, modern, and delicous. The only problem was that our server was very, very slow- and it wasn't seemingly busy at all..... so I don't know what the deal was. Overall, I cannot wait to go back for dinner!", "author": "Laura D."}

Coming in from our first trip local Sonoma, we decided to find a place close to where we were staying in SF and came across Garibaldi's on yelp. This has to be by far the best meal we have had in the 3 days worth of quite expensive choices. The service was amazing, water refills every second, plate clearing, an extra nice waiter A++. The risotto croquettes were simply fried heaven with oozing cheese. We also had the gnocchi starter with no mushrooms. The gnocchi was soft but not too starchy and the sauce with tomatoes and peppers was just the right amount of spice. I had the halibut over a summer succotash with bread crumb salsa. The sauce was a bit tangy smelling, and i thought it wouldn't go well with the halibut, and I was surprised that it in no way overpowered my meal. My hubby had lamb and mashed potatoes, I stole some of the mash and it was yummy with the halibut. I would have preferred potatoes with my dish as well, but the summer salad was fresh and light. \nWe ended off the meal with the chocolate budino, vanilla gelato instead of cappuccino, yum is all I can say. I was quite full at this point but enjoyed this dessert very much.

I have collected many names but gone to few.  I don't know if it is because my boss first recommended garibaldi's, or because I don't like the name (no offense to those people named that) or because of its location, but I have never felt like going here.\r\nBut, since my parents were coming in from the east coast and so I didn't want to make them traipse around all edges of the city and were staying near the presidio, I thought I would give it a shot.\r\nI have to say it is pretty expensive, and my green salad was a bunny-loving pile of greens that just wore me out, but I cannot stop thinking about the lamb.

All I can say is WOW.... not sure how I could have missed this place....\n\nWe arrived a bit early and had the choice to sit or go to the bar area but we were hungry so we will seated. The cast of characters from the hostess, server and bus staff were friendly and quite attentive. We started out with one of their house specialty drinks, the pear martini which was outstanding. Not to sweet and chilled properly. The warm olives and bread they serve were delicious ...very hard to stop eating!   KT had the roasted carrot soup with chive oil (really yummy)and I had the Caesar (my little way of testing the waters of a restaurant) which were just enough to wet our appetites.  The Chicken Milanese was perfect.... the delicate white wine and caper sauce with mashed pot's and arugula.... really yummy. KT had the Pork ragout with pappardelle which was also awesome.  The pappardelle tasted homemade and the sauce had a slight smokey flavor that added a nice layer of flavor.   Decent wine list and our waiter was quite helpful with the selection....\n\nWe both were so full but wanted just a bite of dessert which their menu offers... we had the cream puffs with slighly salted carmel  and chocolate budino.... just enough to put us over the top....they even wrote out happy birthday and added a candle for fun!\n\nI would highly recommend this tried and true neighborhood place.... and we will go back again...soon!", "author": "Carol F."}

The decor is modern and chic, which for better or worse is something that matters to us. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made GREAT recommendations. We started with the Moroccan Melon. Basically this was some sort of melon with rose salt, saffron ice, and a whole bunch of yummy spices. A perfect light start to the meal. Since that melon was so surprisingly tasty, we decided to try another by ordering the watermelon and pork belly appetizer. This thing was amazing, like tears of joy good. Bursting with flavor though, so it's probably best for those with a large palate. For the entree, I took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the lamb. Again, it was stunningly good. We were told that this is the restaurant's specialty, and I would believe it. Perfectly marinated and cooked, it was among the best lamb I've ever had. I have completely forgotten what my wife ordered because I was wrapped up in the transcendent experience of that dish. Haha. So to sum it up, go to Garibaldi's, get the lamb, leaved a changed human being.", "author": "Erick W."}

It was warm inside the restaurant on a chilly night - I actually was able to sit comfortably without a jacket on.  SWEET!\nThe wine list was pretty extensive - there is something there for everybody.  Fortunately, they also have beer on tap for the non-winos. Our server was attentive to the fact that we are a couple who likes to order a few different things to start and confirmed what we'd be sharing a little bit in order to accommodate.  The tuna was good, the bruschetta was delicious, the Garibaldi salad contained a phenomenal combination of glazed walnuts, gorgonzola, and a vinaigrette that I actually loved.  The asparagus was DELISH - a tad salty tasting for whatever reason, but well balanced with other flavors.  We had the lamb and the fish- I never order lamb, but I tasted this and would consider it in the future.  It was THAT flavorful.  Desert was to die for.  Rhubarb and strawberry tart.  I can not believe the girls next to us were \"too full\" to finish the main course.  We cleaned all of our plates proudly, and will most likely return for a repeat performance!", "author": "Amie W."}

The atmosphere is nice -- on the upscale side, but not snooty or stuffy.  The lighting -- lots of soft candlelight and dim lamps -- reminded us a bit of Plumpjack, and that comparison seemed appropriate to describe the crowd as well, which is on the older side.  Not a place you hit for that swinging happy hour, but very pleasant nonetheless.\n\nBetween the four of us, we had the soup of the day (a lentil number that was greatly enjoyed), the croquettes (quite yummy), and two salads.  I had the chopped salad, which was great -- full of several ingredients that don't typically make it into your normal first course mixed greens.  For mains, we had scallops with risotto cakes (excellent), moussaka, filet, and the lamb.  My husband had the lamb and proclaimed it spectacular, and everybody else adored their choices, too.  For dessert, we had the root beer float (tasty, but perhaps not great for sharing as we attempted to do) and the bread pudding.  Both great.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, but not imposing -- just like I prefer.  A drink mix-up, totally my fault, was quickly rectified as if the waitstaff were to blame.\n\nI only wish this place was closer to our house.  I'm sure we'd be there often.  As it stands, I look forward to returning.\n\nBottom Line: an excellent meal in a sophisticated, but lowkey setting that will have you soon coming back for more.", "author": "L G."}

Tried the taster menu with wine pairing and grabbed tastes of all the other dishes served to the rest of the party. Pepper sauce for the steak was a brave decision. Tasted separately, the steak was juicy, tender and flavorful,   the sauce was the essence of perfumed and spicy black pepper. I would have thought the one would overpower the other, but they combined wonderfully. The chicken and the lamb were as good as everyone else says and the 'little ear' pasta with sausage was a triumph of texture and taste.

I liked it a lot. I moved from San Francisco about 3 years ago and could easily say I hadn't been to Garibaldi's in about 5 years. Last Saturday night 4 friends and I went for the Dine About Town and I could easily say we had the rudest waitress I've had in I don't even know how long. The moment we sat down she seemed to pounce on us to order a drink, and gave us absolutely no suggestions on the good bottles of wine below $65...(many of them were $100 and above). It's almost like she's used to her middle-aged older customers who sit and order whiskey on ice the moment they walked in the door. We all ordered the DAT special, which was $42 each and we ordered a few more glasses of wine after our bottle was depleted. I guess what I'm trying to say is that we weren't exactly cheap customers, our bill came out to be about $300. which was fine, but literally, our service was so rude, I would hesitate to come back too soon. The food was good, but not to die for in order to put up with classically-bad service... like the kind I'm talking about in some places in NYC or Europe. It's Garibaldi's, remember this people! It's a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that should be a nice place for locals to come back to. Maybe because we were all in our 30's rather than 60's they were rude... after we walked out, a friend we were with said that's how it would feel if they were racist... we were literally treated as though we were minorities. I tried to kill them with kindness, and I did at last get a smile from the waitress when we walked out... which was shocking.", "author": "Michelle H."}

For starters, I had the asparagus and pancetta with garlic, chili oil, and oyster sauce. While this sounds like a winning combination, the chefs somehow missed the cue on proportions: there was such an overwhelming amount of pancetta and oyster sauce that all I could taste was salt and salt. Even stuffing an entire asparagus spear in my mouth with one itty bitty piece of pancetta didn't alleviate the overwhelming saltiness of this dish. On the other hand, the grilled black mission figs, arugula, crispy pancetta, and goat cheese salad with port wine vinaigrette was a bigger improvement, and even quite good. In this dish, the pancetta played a more subtle role, letting the figs be the prominent presence with their caramelized taste and texture.

Trust me! It's their signature dish and is amazing and they always have it on the menu for the lowest price. After dozens of flawless visits over the years, in my most recent visit, I was suprised to find that the salads were prepared poorly and the bread was not up to the excellent quality it sometimes can be (walnut and olive bread), but they did the chicken perfectly. The one bad thing about this place is that it is EXTREMLY loud and they seat most guests very close to others.

I have no problem with that, unless service is bad, and unfortunately for us it was. Our server was MIA most of the evening, we had to track him down, as in get up leave the table and find him (usually just hanging out by the hostess stand) to take our order for drinks, appetizers, dinner and then dessert.  Geez, we just would have appreciated the bare minimum of service, but we didn't even get that.  As for our special event, he made it clear he could have cared less. We told him we invited our family out to find out the gender of the baby together with them.  As in my husband and I didn't know, we had the hospital write it down on a piece of paper, seal it in an envelope which we would then open in front of everyone.  The champagne we ordered as we sat down, took 20 minutes to arrive, delaying the surprise event.  The guy seemed generally put out that we were even there.

We were shocked that it was cheaper than the Dine About Town, which offered one one selection: house salad, chicken milanese and a chocolate dessert. Unfortunately, by the time we were seated, which was around 7pm, they ran out of the house Prix Fix Supper and so the majority of us opted for something else on the menu. Everyone else opted to order the seafood linguini which they all finished!!!! I stuck to the Dine About Town to check it out. The salad was great, and my chicken was good.

For dinner, we'd brought our own wine, and didn't get any of the attitude I always fear when we BYOB.  In fact, the server was curious about the bottle, and when she opened it, commented on the eucalyptus that she could smell on the nose.  For a starter, we ordered the soup of the evening - a roasted corn bisque - and the risotto croquettes.  The soup came in two bowls so we could share, and was absolutely delicious.  The croquettes were amazing, melty cheese oozing out the middle.  For dinner, a perfectly cooked filet with al dente vegetables and a \"tater tot\" for the BF, and lamb tenderloins with couscous and the most delectable cream-based tarragon sauce for me.
