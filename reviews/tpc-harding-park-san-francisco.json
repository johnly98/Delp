{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-18", "description": "This is a really tough review for me.  Played on 4/25/17. I love the game of golf and I love playing different courses. This was my first time here and I was pretty excited to play on a course that has hosted numerous PGA events, and I have heard a lot about TPC Harding Park.  \n\nFrom Tee to Green, the conditions were fantastic. Great fairways.  We decided to walk the course, and the pull carts come with sand on each cart so it was nice to be able to fill the divots and not leave the course in bad shape for the people playing behind you.  It looks like they aerated the greens about 2-3 weeks before we arrived, so it was just on the tail end of getting back to full speed.  We left some putts short on the first few holes before adjusting, but the greens still rolled pretty good. \n\nThe reason why this course didn't get higher reviews is 2 parts:\n1) not being a Bay Area resident, the rate was $147 for a weekday tee time.  That's a little steep, but I'm willing to pay it if the experience matches the fee.  If you are an SF resident with a Resident Card (that you have to purchase from City Hall or something like that) you get a pretty big discount, and it would only cost you about $55.  Bay Area Residents get something in between, like $90-100.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the steep price tag for me.  See reason #2 below.\n2)  As far as the course layout, its a very walkable course, and I actually enjoyed walking it.  But as far as the holes, there's nothing really memorable about a lot of the par 4s.  It felt repetitive and lacked variety.  Straightaway Par 4s were a very common theme, except for a few holes.  \n\nSo overall, there's nothing \"wrong\" with this course, but it just didn't have any \"WOW\" factor, except for the price tag.  Maybe I'm not understanding some of the history of this course, or maybe as a first timer I couldn't appreciate all the features and missed a bunch things because I was so focused on playing well, but after the round I felt like I could have a similar golf experience at other courses and pay 1/3 of the price.  If this was a $60 golf course, maybe more stars, but because of the very low price-to-enjoyment ratio, I give this place 2.5 stars, which I rounded up to 3.", "author": "Mr L."}

It's almost the same course but with nice grass and nice cart paths.  If you are not an SF resident then the green fee is really expensive for what you get and not really worth the money IMO.  \n1. SF Resident the price = $68\n2. Non-SF resident price but a Bay Area resident price = $102\n3. Non-Bay Area resident price = $177  \n\nThese are weekend rates of course.  The course is cart path ONLY.  This is why you always see people walking the course, it is not worth paying $20 for a cart when you can't even drive on the grass.  The course is not extremely challenging but it would be a nice course if the green fee was $68 for everyone.

The service and food were outstanding!  We only had one guy helping us thru out the whole event but he was awesome and attentive - from handing out mimosas to arriving guests, to refilling the water dispenser, to making sure our food trays were never empty.  I honestly did not have very high expectations of the food so I was so pleasantly surprised that it was so good.  My Aunt and I were saying that the scones were some of the best of we have ever had!  They were not dry and crumbly but moist and so flavorful.  Scrambled eggs are hard to get right, especially in mass quantity.  They're usually dry and over cooked but these were not.  They were so moist.  I am so happy we went with this venue!\nOne suggestion I would make to them would be to have attendants in golf carts available in various areas of the parking lot when there's another event going on on the same day, like a tournament.  There would have been ample parking but since there was a tournament as well yesterday, parking was super hard.  My sister, who was the guest of honor and heavily pregnant, had to park close to the entrance, outside the gates.  The walk from there to the clubhouse is a pretty long walk for non pregnant people so was extra long and hard for my sister.

The newly redone greens are still slow for a TPC course (even Jim Furyk told me they were very slow during the WGC match play).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "There are many things in San Francisco that are resting on their historical popularity, but no longer live up to their old levels of excellence. Harding Park is in danger of becoming ne of those things. \nThe Staff is great. And the course was in pretty great shape. But like earlier reviews, it's not particularly interesting. Yes the 18th is spectacular, but the other 17 could be found at a good Muni somewhere. Also, the driving range alone should get negative stars if that's possible. They have adopted the new mats that do not allow for using a rubber tee. But you can use your own tees. Probably one for each shot. The place looks like a garbage dump of old broken tees, candy wrappers, ball sleeves, etc. A real dump. And the range has been in that condition the last 3 times I was there.\n\nAnother thing is the carts. They have programmed the GPS to prohibit you from...well from doing anything they don't want you to do. For example...take the cart to your car to help you unload your clubs? Nope, sorry carts are not allowed in the parking lot. So...the cart just dies and strands you just after you cross the line into the lot. It also strands you if you are going someplace on the course it doesn't want you to go. One of our players hit a bad shot onto another fairway....and his cart stalled as he went after it. Sorry, your not supposed to be on that fairway.... It only would allow him to drive in reverse, as he backed his way onto the 'right' fairway. He uses a cart for his bad hip...but who cares about him? It's much more important that everything is under control.\n\nAnother thing that reduces the pleasure of playing Harding is the Police Gun Range adjoining the property. LOUD automatic rifle shots for our ENTIRE round. Not Harding's fault, but just another nail in the coffin.\n\nFinally, you will see a sign that says they are changing to \"Demand Pricing\". I think this is ala Uber. When demand is high they raise the prices. But the best part is....they claim it is \"In the interest of fairness and equity\" Seriously???? Raising prices keeps things \"equitable\" Holy cow, if that isn't the epitome of San Francisco-think I don't know what is.\n\nSo I will enjoy Harding by going to the restaurant, and walking along Lake Merced, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your golf money on Harding. Crystal Springs is a much more interesting course.", "author": "william c."}

I now play 100+ rounds a year and most USGA Qualifiers since leaving the golf industry and gaining my amateur status back.  This will be somewhat uncomfortable of a review, but lets go. \n\nThe inside staff was very accommodating as I was playing as a guest since I am a member at another TPC property.   They allowed me to pair up and tee off early since there is no driving range open.  I went and checked in with the starter and he was great.  He paired me up while I rolled some practice putts and off we went.  \n\nThe layout was great and the scenery was amazing, there is no denying that.  Also I won't complain about the gun range or noise as this us a busy metro area and one cannot realistically expect silence in this environment.  \n\nThe greens were sooo slow it was almost a joke.  They look fantastic and they are healthy but they could not have ran more than a 6 or so on the stimp meter.  Not to mention there was a temporary green on #3 that the staff neglected to mention at check in.   For over $100 a round this was pretty comical.  \n\nLastly their course advisor/maintenance person John was a less than tactful individual and who more concerned with scolding me for playing the tips than keeping the groups ahead of us moving. (there were no signs or notices that the back tees were closed).  \n\nOverall the layout and photo ops were superb, but the conditions, service, and communication need some serious work/improvement.  \n\nIf a $100+ muni is what your looking for then this is your home!  Please do not expect the same facilities, conditions, or service that you are used to at other TPC Properties. (Stonebrae, Las Vegas, Scottsdale, SanAntonio, etc)  The TPC moniker here is very misleading and in no way indicative of the experience you will have. \n\nWould I recommend a friend?

I live in the south Bay, so it takes me a while to get up there, but in my opinion, it's worth it. Also, I obviously don't have to go clear into the city.\n\nClubhouse: The clubhouse is very nice; at the higher end of clubhouses around. The restaurant is good for a bite, they have free WiFi, and the pro shop is stocked with good merchandise if you need to take a TPC Harding Park souvenir home. Prices are okay for a TPC clubhouse...felt about on par.\n\nDriving Range: The range leaves something to be desired, but I think the course itself makes up for it and then some. The range is mats, it's small, and it's not very deep. I would probably just plan on hitting a small bucket of irons before your round, but hey you do what you gotta do.\n\nCourse: The course is spectacular. It's layout is really built for walking. Let me be clear that I much prefer, and almost always do, ride versus walk. However, the course layout, and the fact that it's cart path only, kind of makes your understand why the majority of folks walk. There are definitely carts available, and if someone like my dad comes to play, we definitely grab a car. In general, though, if you've thought it might be fun to walk a course, this is the one. The fairways and greens are beautiful, and the scenery is so good. \n\nPrice: Harding Park is definitely not cheap, but it's also a pretty good deal for being just south of the City and in the Bay Area as a TPC course. Plus, to give you an idea of how good the course is, the US Open and President's Cup are being played there in the coming years. That's just sick nasty.

You would never know that it has been raining so much. Tee boxes and fairways were nicely mowed and well kept. The greens were pure and were rolling super fast! My only complaint is that there should be a marshal out on Fleming as the pace of play was very slow, we waited on every shot on every hole. I feel that some of the holes could be shortened, maybe another set of tees for beginners, juniors and seniors. Overall a fun track. I look forward to many more rounds here in the future.", "author": "Joe K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-29", "description": "I've played this course dozens of times, both before and since the acquisition by TPC, and I have to say, it continues to amaze me. My most recent visit this past Monday (Memorial Day) only served the solidify that opinion.\n\nThe course is beautiful and well-kept, and the greens and bunkers have been vastly improved by the recent restoration. The bunkers are now full of pristine, fine, white sand (compared to the inconsistent, clumpier sand in the old ones), and their lips are much cleaner and not collapsed like so many of the old ones were. The greens, while somewhat slow due to how recently they opened, roll true, and again, are much more consistent than their poa annua infected predecessors (let's hope that doesn't happen again!). I was reminded of Harding's natural beauty when I played on Monday. The back nine truly is a treat, meandering around the inner front nine and showcasing beautiful views of San Francisco, The Olympic Club, and Lake Merced as you progress through it. \n\nThe course is forgiving for those who spray it, making it (unfortunately) somewhat of a hacker's paradise, but it is by no means easy. Both birdies and lost balls are few and far between; the length and subtleties of the course make up for its forgiving nature. The course culminates with arguably one of the best 18th holes in golf: a long, dogleg left par-4 with Lake Merced on the left and bunkers to the right. A draw isn't necessary to hit the fairway, but shaping one around the corner makes the hole significantly easier. The green is tiered and domed, with bunkers swallowing shots to the left, and gives me fits each time I play the hole, but it doesn't mean I love it any less. It's a perfect finish to a great course, and a challenge I always look forward to. \n\nThe Cypress Grill is great, too. The waiters and waitresses are nice, and the food is solid. I always order the chili, which is delicious. Most of the people in the Pro Shop are polite and helpful, and will try and help you when they can. It's also very organized. If you have a tee time, you'll almost always get out on time, and if you don't, you will either be given a time, or asked for your phone number, put on a wait list, and called when there is a time available, which is great. \n\nA few cons: first, it can be pricey. I was lucky enough to have been able to get the junior rate for many years, which was $15 M-F and $21 on weekends and holidays. That was a deal! Now that I am no longer a junior, the rates have jumped, but that's a theme for most courses. Harding is especially expensive if you're not from the Bay Area/SF. Another con is the range. It was recently outfitted with new mats, but I liken that to trying to fix a bullet wound with a band-aid; it's just not going to work. For the money you're paying, Harding should have a grass range. The chipping and putting greens are good, however, so that's a bonus. \n\nOverall, Harding is a great course and experience. If you're from out of town and have the money to spend, do it. You won't regret it.", "author": "Zander N."}

I like hole 7 a short par 4 but I sill always mange to  double bogy because its well guarded by bunkers and has elevated green.  Number 9 is fun.. a straight par 5... Background 9 is designed on the outter part of the course and lake merced. Number 11 is a average par 3 that you aim at SFSU building. Hole 12 is famous for all the golf balls on the fence that are stuck because of people who have that power fade. Hole 14 is a pretty hole.. Now hole 18 OMG is long.... Your drive is over a part of the lake.. But the second shot is to an elevated green that use to be the old putting green. So for me its like driver, 3 wood, and wedge.. \n\nBunker: 10 ..

We played a tournament on a Sunday, so it was not mid week or an off day. First off, no carts on the fairways, which were dry. This made for a slow pace of play and a long round.\n  The marshal was an ass, just barking orders without any idea of the big picture. No food service at the walk up window at the turn. WTF? This was a weekend with the course full.... Had to go into the grille, as per the posted sign for food. Only two prepared sandwiches, Turkey and Tuna for $8.00. Crappy selection and way the hell over priced.\n  The greens were horrible. They had not been groomed in days and were very, very slow. Not at all what you would expect from a so called TPC venue. We came to the conclusion that they hadn't mowed the greens as plugging was due to start the following week. So what about all the players that ponied up the $135 plus for the green fees? Didn't we deserve a better surface based on the money charged?\n   I will not go back.

It feels like something between a municipal and a country club. The course overall is in pretty good shape, the roughs are not long, and with the exception of the water on 18 and the holes the line the edges of the property (think out of bounds), lost balls are a rare occurrence. The greens are pretty slow, typical of a city course, but they are going to be redone at the end of the year. \n\nThe course itself offers a good variety of holes and could be very difficult of the rough was longer. As a San Francisco resident with a Resident Golf Card, I'm able to play here for $52 during the week and at that price it is a great deal. A real bonus is the ability walk onto the course. Just show up at the pro shop (you can't call ahead), get your name on the list, and if during the week you'll likely be on the first tee within an hour.

It was a great layout and everything it is today, except the city of San Francisco had no money to put towards it.  Hence, it was in terrible condition.\n\nBut in 1998 the US Open was played at The Olympic Club right across the lake.  And during The Open, they used Harding Park as a parking lot for spectators.  The USGA rented it out and in return gave a huge chunk of money to the course to renovate it.  They also did this with the idea of making it worthy of professional events.\n\nToday it is completely renovated and hosts either a PGA, LPGA or Senior event every year.  They rotate between the three.  This year in October will be the Presidents Cup with the US team competing against an International team.\n  \nHere is the http://www.coursecam.com/courses/harding_park_golf_course.cfm satellite map of Harding Park\n\nIf you zoom out the map a few clicks you can see the Olympic Club and the San Francisco Golf Club.  Both of which are private and I've sadly never played.\n\nIf you're going to play Harding Park here are a few things to consider.  First, if you get a cart, its cart path only.  This pretty much defeats the purpose of having a cart in my book.  Second, they have really narrowed the fairways and started growing up the rough.  So although the fairways are wide between the trees, the actual mowed fairways are quite narrow.  Third, the course is lined with giant cypress trees.  Incidentally cypress trees are my favorite, the look like giant bonzi trees.  And finally, tee times are being limited as they get closer to the Presidents Cup.\n\nHarding Park is also a little pricy and tee times can be difficult to get.  They offer San Francisco residents a residence card for $45 which you have to buy at city hall.  This cuts the rate to about $65 prime time.  They have a Bay Area rate of about $95 and finally a out of area rate of around $125.  Once you have a residence card you can then use the automated telephone system to get a tee time, but you'll need to book about two weeks out to secure a decent time.", "author": "Jeremy C."}

The customer service here is extremely poor.  The guys behind the counter at the Pro Shop act like this is Pebble Beach!  And they treat you like a hacker.  Compare that to nice courses that treat everyone like the PAYING CUSTOMERS THAT THEY ARE, regardless of appearance, ability, or dare I say RACE.\n\nAlthough the starters are generally nice, the marshals are very rude.  I once teed off as part of a foursome on #1, with two open holes in front of us.  Around #5 and then later #10, the marshal was trying to speed us up to catch up to the group in front of us.  Odd.  \n\nIt should also be known that during the US Open 2012 at nearby Olympic Club, Harding decided to price gouge!   SF and CA resident rates were not honored; this is especially hard to understand because the SF resident card is a PURCHASED discount card.  In addition, visitors from out of town had to pay more than a 100% mark up greens fee!  Taking advantage of golfers, especially those who support the course year round, is simply uncouth and unprofessional.  And gouging tourists during a historical event is very un-San Francisco.\n\nBy the way, you aren't allowed to drive carts on the fairway.  So have fun crisscrossing fairways by foot all day long.  And the marshalls wonder why rounds take a long time.\n\nDon't even bother with the crappy driving range.  The balls are old and deformed.  The fake grass surface they use is poor quality astro-turf.  It is nearly impossible to tee up your ball to practice with your driver and three wood.  \n\nAll in all, save your cash and skip Harding.  There are fantastic courses outside of the city for a fraction of the price, with better service and facilities, and quality golf.  If you MUST play in SF, Presidio has slightly better service and comparable quality golf; however, know that Presidio also price gouged during the US Open.

I got out and played Fleming for the first time today, and it is a wonderful 9-hole course for fine-tuning your game.\n\nThe course plays par 30 - so there are six par 3 holes and three par 4's. Think of it as a mini-Harding. Fleming plays on the interior of Harding's back 9 - and if you've ever played Harding you've at least seen some of the yellow flags marking Fleming's layout.\n\nThe holes vary in length from easy to reach par 3s of 130 yards to \"hit & hope\" 235 yard par 3's. The par 4 holes are fair tests of golf, varying from 400 to 450 yards from the white tees, when they are moved back.\n\nI walked on at noon on a Wednesday. The pro shop staff were extremely courteous (I love those guys at Harding, really I do), got me processed and out the door in less than two minutes. The course itself was near-empty. I saw a few groups ahead of me, but never caught them. I had the green light to hit when ready for the entire round.\n\nI played 9 holes in under 90 minutes. Alone. With a lot of the same views you get while playing Harding and (this is the important part) the same condition fairways & greens. The greens at Fleming are in great shape, better than Lincoln, GGP, Sharp or Glen Eagles. In fact, the only muni in town with greens close to or better than Fleming's are...Harding!\n\nFleming has all of the same amenities as Harding: clubhouse, range, practice greens, etc. It is the best \"executive course\" in the city, and my new found home for quick rounds.\n\nCourse design/playability: 4 stars \nWalk-Ability: 5 stars\nCondition/maintenance: 5 stars\nDriving range/practice area: 4 stars\nPace of play: 5 stars\nAvg. wait for tee time: 5 stars\nPro shop staff: 5 stars", "author": "Greg Q."}

Hidden inside of the Harding 18, you'll see fairways stretching in every direction, giving you the feeling of playing a large, luxurious course. Yet you paid $22 and you can finish your round in less than 2 hours.\n\nFleming is a great place to learn golf, which is why I've been coming here regularly for the past 5 months or so. A step up from GG Park in terms of difficulty, since there are 3 par 4's - two of them with vicious doglegs that make it very hard to garner a clean second shot.  You can bust out your woods and large irons and really go for it; but be careful because those Montery cypress trees really overhang a lot of the holes and can knock your ball sideways in a jiff. The rough is also, well...rough.\n\nA fine place to come during the week - I've hit it up early-style before work a few times and been the only guy out there - or on the weekend, when you might wait 20 minutes if it's crowded.", "author": "Mike G."}

Harding Park was just renovated in preps for the 2009 Presidents Cup. No joke both courses are NICE! \n\nThey don't take reservations at Fleming. I got there around 11:30 with hopes of getting on the course in an hour. There was NO WAIT! It was awesome. I called my buddy whom I had planned to go golfing with, and we were off on the first tee at Noon. The marshal was nice to let me and her go as a pair.\n\nSo the course itself, was a bit tough, which I prefer. Good variety of short and long par 3's with a couple of par 4's. You can easily see parts of Harding Park, which made me want to drool. You get backed up around the 5th hole I believe, but there are so many people on there, its understandable. Just be patient and wait your turn (and remember you are on the short course). Easily walkable (its nine hole!) and a lot of fun.

Having only lived here for 2 years, I've never played it prior to renovation, but I have to say that Harding park compares favorably with my hometown local muni course, Torrey Pines.  \n\nWith a resident card, the fees are beyond reasonable, the 18-hole main course is both challenging and beautiful (the 18th hole in particular just gives me fits as every single time I've played it I've either hooked my drive into the lake, or sliced it to the right, leaving me some gazillion yards to the green).  The 9-hole Flemming is very good for what it is.  \n\nOverall, Harding is not quite as challenging as Torrey Pines South, but   maybe one thing they do better at harding is stagger the tee times further apart so there is less time spent waiting for the group ahead.  \n\nGetting a reservation is not too difficult if you use the phone tee time reservation system a week in advance.", "author": "Josh K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-01-01", "description": "For starters, you should know that I'm a San Francisco resident who plays out of Gleneagles - so I'm no prima donna when it comes to course conditions. I'm also no stranger to Harding as I regularly play there 4-6 times a year. This morning I went out in the first group of the new year and found the conditions to be abyssmal.\n\nAll of the greens were covered with blotches - due to an infestation of poa annnua grass, fungus, and in some cases, weeds. As a result, most of them were bumpy and a few were nearly unplayable.\n\nThe fairways and rough were completely overwatered and there was mud and muck everywhere on the course. In fact, the middle of one fairway on the front nine was cordoned off because it was too muddy and there were several other fairways that should have been given the same treatment. All this despite the fact that there's been very little rain over the last few weeks. Most of the fairways were also covered with small mud balls. At first I thought they had been punched (aerated), but one of my playing partners told me that when the ground is completely saturated, earthworms burrow their way to the surface. They leave behind displaced dirt, which due to overwatering - does not dissolve, but turns into the aforementioned mud balls.\n\nAs any San Francisco golfer knows, none of this would be worth discussing if it was about any other city-owned course. The problem is that we're talking about Harding Park - where non-residents are charged $89 - $155 to play golf on a weekend or holiday; where the course requires a public subsidy to stay afloat (no pun intended); and where the staffing levels compared to other city-owned courses (and parks) are outrageous.\n\nUnfortunately, Harding's level of staffing doesn't result in anything remotely approaching fine playing conditions. Think I'm exaggerating? Take this morning...I saw more people working in the area of the 12th green and 13th tee than Gleneagles employs to maintain the entire golf course. You know what they were out there doing today on \"holiday\" pay? They were cleaning out the gutters between the concrete slabs of the cart path! \n\nPerhaps you'll think I'm being overly harsh; but as a golf-playing, property tax-paying resident of San Francisco, I can't help but be outraged at the poor management of the Harding Park golf course.\n\nBy the way, the resident rate today was $60. If I'm going to spend that amount or a bit more (w/o a cart), I can think of many other well-conditioned places to play that are nearby. Perhaps you should also consider \"voting with you wallet\" and doing the same.", "author": "Cee J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-06-22", "description": "6 months ago I spoke to the GM at Harding, after a particularly horrific 5 and 1/2 hour round there, just before the TPC takeover.  The course was in miserable shape, that was late September last year.  He assured me that after the TPC takeover, \"you'll see a much better product.....\"\n\nWell, guess what, NOT!  Here we are, mid June, they're in charge so it's their  baby now, and the place sucks.  I've played several local courses in the last couple of weeks, San Geronimo, Rooster Run, Indian Valley, Windsor, all daily fee courses, all fantastic condition.  Firm fairways, smooth greens running about 8 or 9 or more on the Stimp, the greens all hold approach shots.  This is the competition for Harding's golf dollar within an hours drive.  \n\nLet's get to the facts and reality currently at Harding.....\n\nA friend of mine was here from San Diego recently and wanted to play Harding.  The $150 fee was a non starter, we went to San Geronimo for $35 and had a great time.  Let's get real here, Harding is worth $40 to walk for an SF resident, and any out of town player should be able to get on for $75.  Make the price affordable and  you'll have plenty of play.....On Monday they don't let anyone off until 8 am.  Huh?  We would have loved to go out at 7 am......what other area public course has no play until 8 am on Monday?  How much revenue does that cost the course annually?  I don't want to hear about money trouble if you can't get the place open and people off the first tee on a Monday at 7 am.  Driving range?  In shambles.  I was afraid to hit down into the uneven, lumpy fake turf there for fear I'd tear a ligament in my hands.  Time to bulldoze that piece of junk and put in a state of the art double decker driving range with quality matts and balls, which will increase revenue and allow for a decent warm up.  Putting green?   Nope, sorry closed on Monday.  So I pay my daily fee and want to hit some putts after the round but the green is closed?  R U KIDDING ME?  Again, name another course that closes the practice green on Monday.  \n\nNow, let's get to the specifics of the golf course.  Fairways?  Patchy, dry and not mowed close enough.  I got several bad lies in the fairway because they don't mow them tight enough for the ball to sit up.  OK, so now it's finally dry out there.....the drainage system they put in works, big deal.  Now do something about the fairways, make them pure like all the rest of the area courses......Bunkers?  Not much sand, plenty of clay when you dig in with a 60 or 64 degree wedge.  The greens?  Well, they wouldn't hold a perfectly struck 8 iron from the fairway on #2, nor a perfectly struck hybrid on #3, both balls landing 10 feet or so below the hole and releasing to the back edge.  But the green speed?  Slow and slower, no one got the ball to the hole all day, probably a 6 on the Stimp.  Whoever heard of firm and slow?  Marshalls on the course?  Nope.  Pace of play?  If we hadn't been the third group off we'd probably still be out there on the back nine somewhere.......\n\nWe pay $45 a year for a residents card, and $48 to play Harding.  It's supposed to be this prestigious course that holds PGA and Champions tour events.  Reality?......it's the worst course I've played in the last few years, consistently, period.  Me and my friends, all SF residents, won't renew our residents card nor play there ever again.  Is this how the City of SF expects to foster a golf program that will be successful?  Are we to believe the hype that the new TPC status and the new management will be able to turn it int a first class golf experience?  And finally, the ultimate question, who's in charge and what the heck is going on out there?  Is this the best they can do?  Do we need to wait 5 years for it to happen?  Or, more likely, is it just more of the same old stuff?", "author": "Mark S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-06", "description": "most people are reviewing Fleming under the Harding Park business name but i'd put it under it's own name to eliminate confusion.  they are two very different courses.  Harding is a world class 18 hole, par 72, that hosts a professional tournament yearly.  Fleming is a dinky little, walk-on, 9 hole course with a par of 30 that is will run you a whopping 22 bucks if you have an SF resident card.  i mean, the toyota tercel and the Lexus LS are both made by Toyota but i don't think they are the same car.  same analogy with Fleming/Harding. \n\ni'll review harding later, but since i play Fleming so regularly, i'll put a review down for it first.  \n\nFirst off, it's an incredible deal for $22.  The course is in amazing condition for a public course that is so affordable.  it's not like Lincoln at all where you end up hitting off of mud or the greens are patchy, at best.  the course is in great condition which makes it quite enjoyable. \n\nAlso unlike Lincoln, it's a great course for beginners since there are almost no hazards, no water, very little sand... and there aren't any out-of-bounds areas where you can lose a lot of balls.  even if you put a ball 50 yards wide, you will probably just land on a fairway for one of the Harding holes.  the fact that it's so good for beginners, of course, has it's downsides.  that means that there ARE a lot of beginners; a lot of people chasing a lot of balls on other fairways; a lot of people shooting an 8 on the par 3's!  So come there with patience.  you could end up watching the group in front of you take 7 shots each to get to the green on the 190 yard, hole #3.  so if you're a decent player, you probably want to play at an odd hour or on a cloudy, cold day so there aren't so many hackers on the course.  the wait is usually not bad.  it's walk-on only and unless you go on a crowded, sunny weekend it's very manageable.  \n\nif you want to get detailed about it then i'd say that hole 1 is the hardest hole of all.  it's 400+ yards but a tough, tough dog-leg left.  my advice is don't use a driver because those trees in front of you are only about 200 yards away so if you can hit a driver over 200 yards, you will end up behind the trees with no shot at the green.  take a wood and slap it 190 yards and push to the left.  that will, of course, leave you with a very long wood shot at the green.  good luck reaching the green in two.  it's the hardest hole.  if you get a bogey, good for you. \n\nthe other holes are pretty straight-forward, few hazards, little sand... some over-hanging trees make some of the shots more difficult.  it's fairly challenging, all in all.  there's a 235 yard par 3.  good luck in hitting the green (and 2-putting) from 235 yards away!  there's another 200 yard par 3, also tough one to hit the green.  they make up for it somewhat with a very, very short, 260 yard, par 4 which gives you a decent chance at a birdy or at least, par.", "author": "dan h."}

We chose the location because of Kristina, their event planner.

She had been out for several months before and we were a bit nervous but as soon as she returned, everything fell into place. The location overlooking the lake was beautiful and in spite of the bleachers behind the site (for the golf tournament), it was perfect. The bleachers actually provided a bit of a wall which came in as a handy hiding spot for us to hang out before going down the aisle. All of the wedding details were taken care of without us having to worry about a thing on the day of it all. Cocktails, dinner, and the reception went perfectly and we had a great time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-08", "description": "I write this review of Harding park as a former employee of the place...in the mid-nineties (high school) I worked there as the starter and I did various odd jobs at the range as well.\n\nBack then Harding was a little slice of heaven, easy to get on, laid back cool pros, and $20 for residents to play 18! Needless to say I played there ALL the time.\n\nWell a few years ago they did a much ballyhooed renovation to the place, it was closed for an entire year...when it reopened it was a much better golf course, the grass was greener and the putting greens actually had a true roll. That was the only thing that improved, everything else declined dramatically. I could go on forever, and believe me I have gone on forever when I'm drinking with the guys or playing as a single with some strangers. I'll try and be brief. Maybe I'll make a list of grievances\n\n1. You pay $45 a year for a residence card. \"What the hell City of SF, why can't I just show my driver's license?\" why do you need to squeeze $45 out of me a year to prove I live in the city limits!  What a racket!  \n\n2. It's very hard to get a tee time now. As a resident you can make a tee time 7 days in advance for $1 a player. BUT if money is no object you can be a NON-RESIDENT and make a tee time 30 days in advance for $10 a person. This policy has basically taken Harding away from blue collar folks who just wanna play a decent 18 in the city they live in. I've called right on the dot at 7pm 7 days in advance to get a tee time several times with mixed results, but most of the time I go through the little automated system asking for a threesome at 8am, and they say back to be \"the nearest tee time that meets you request is....11:47am, would you like to reserve?\" so right at the opening the whole morning is gone and the only thing left is the 15 minutes before twilight when NO-ONE wants to make a tee time since you're paying full price for something you can have a major discount in 15 minutes...so you hang up the phone is disgust and say to yourself...\"Well I guess we're hiking that day, or watching football...or....\"\n\n3. The clubhouse is one of the ugliest modern buildings I've seen in a while. Strike that it's not ugly, it just doesn't have ANY personality, one of my buddies calls it a Danville McMansion a very accurate description I think.\n\n4. when they were talking about the renovation they said they'd keep the resident rates low and let the non-resident rates pay for the course....we'll every few months I look up at the prices and they resident rates had steadily climbed while the non-resident rates have declined. It's gotten to the point where some day in the future the benefits of the resident card might not be as great as they are today.\n\n5. In my 15 years of playing golf I have never been told to \"speed things up\" but it's happened twice in the last 6 months! I'm a 10 handicap too, I don't play slow...one time I was on the 8th tee (a par three) and a marshal rolled up on us and told us to tee off when the people on the green weren't even off yet! I have dozens of stores just like this one too....\n\n6. enough for now...just know that Harding is a great course that is in the wrong hands", "author": "Adrian H."}

One of the best municipal golf courses in the entire country, it's one of few munis that have held a PGA tour sanctioned event on it with more to come.  I'd like to give it 5 stars but reserve that designation for places like Pebble, Bandon, Olympic etc..\n\nHarding is a great test of golf and the more you get to know the course the more you appreciate it.  It's a course that requires strategy if  you would like to score well.  Some holes play differently from the blue tees so it's worth playing there at least once to see how those holes play.\n\nOn the downside, conditioning is still great although not as great when it first reopened.  Considering the play that Harding receives it's still in very good shape.  It kind of depends when you are out there.  The driving range leaves something to be desired but has one of the best short game areas in the immediate area for public golfers.

Answer: use a wooden tee and tie a string to it so it won't fly out into the range. Upkeep and turf is better than years past but who cares, I get a better value many other places. Saving grace: the 18th hole is a masterpiece worth playing once, for every Bay Area golfer.
