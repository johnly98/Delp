Doesn't seem gentrified like other restaurants nearby, though it will be a bit pricier than tacos or burritos.  However, that must be because you get enough food for two meals.  And it's not because I had a weak appetite or anything, literally every other table was taking leftovers home.\n\nAntojitos \"Las Tinajas\": Not sure why it's called antojitos, since it's more like a massive double meal plate than an appetizer or snack.  If you can't decide which grilled meat to get, this combo is a great option.  Skirt steak that is heavily marinated and charbroiled, delicious in each bite.  Also, another heavily spiced large cut of pork that is pounded thin and grilled with nice grill marks.  The fact that this platter came with a big chunk of fried cheese seal the deal, so yummy.  The rice mixed with beans were a nice hearty side.  More fried plantain chips than I knew what to do with.  Also some softer and sweeter maduros, that helped contrast the salty umami of everything else.  The pickled onions went really well with the meats.\n \nPitaya Juice: Sweeter than fresh red dragon fruit, maybe they added a little sugar?  Quite refreshing.", "author": "Adam B."}

After going here 30+ years The food is now an embarrassment. I went to lunch with HIGH expectations I took a friend with me, so they can get the Nicaraguan experience in FLAVOR in food. Once there hardly any food, trays were empty (this was 1PM) the ladies were cleaning up, seems as if they were getting ready to close, only a couple of tables with customers.  I ordered Vigoron,(not much from the menu was available)  the chicarron was hard as a rock, separately ordered steak dinner, order of fried cheese and platano verde (which I didn't get), instead I got quesadilla (I didn't order), 1 water and 1 cacao,1 cold bunuello and the owner charged $65.00. I asked why so much. The owner just looked at me as If I was crazy. The food was NOT great, it was not what I was expecting, even the traditional gallo pinto on the steak plate - no flavor and cold. I even tried to return an order that I didn't ask for - but he owner charge me.  I even asked one of the ladies that works there, what has happened to this place, it used to be \"The Place to go for Nicarguan food\". The lady replied \" it's not the same, people change\".  It is unfortunate that I could not have my friend experience the traditional food from my county, and to point out...I WILL NOT RETURN. The price is not a big deal, if I would have received what I ordered.   This used to be the place that my family would go frequently.  Not anymore.", "author": "Li R."}

Well in reality this is not the case! As you go from north to south through Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama the cuisines change a great deal, but many of the popular basic ingredients like Rice, Beans, plantains, corn, etc. carry through. However, here in the Bay Area we mostly see what North American eaters have a taste for, hence lots of rice, beans, pork, beef, etc in Central American restaurant dishes. Las Tinajas Restaurant is not different in that sense.\n\nLas Tinajas is a cafeteria style eatery. It has a clean eating area, and the servers behind the counter are very nice and fast (depending of course on what you order). I liked the rice and bean mix, but you can also ask for them separately. The fried cheese was something different for me and I really liked it, but quickly learned that you must eat it while it is still very warm, or it will taste like  like leather! The pork was very good, so was the beef, but what I loved most was the flan which I had as dessert!\n\nJudging from the crowd and the line, Las Tinajas is a popular spot, and that's a good thing! To be honest I know nothing about the owners, but if they are the people who run the kitchen and the floor, it must be a family owned business. \n\nNext time I am there, I will try a couple of the filling soups they serve.

I did anyways, only to get disappointed:\n\nMe: the pitaya doesn't taste like pitaya, i can only taste a tiny bit of lemon, can it be replaced with a different drink?\n\nLady grabs a small cup and pour some pitaya in it from the jar and tasted the drink\nLady: it does taste like pitaya. \nThen she asked a customer who was in the line ready to pay for his food to taste the drink for her to reassure me , using the same cup she just used. The customer told her that he doesn't really taste foods due to some sort of problem he has. Then she turns to one of the workers and asked to taste it for her, again, from the same cup she just used. All this time i am watching the show as I am in shock! Really? You are willing to lose a long time customer for a few bucks?! And not only that, hygiene concerns. Only God knows what happens in the kitchen, who taste the food/drinks to prove (all from the same cup/spoon, sharing saliva!) how good/bad it is, gross. \nWell, the worker agrees with her and says \"it is good, and that's how the fruit taste like\".\n\nLady: I can't change it, sorry, it is your taste.\n\nMe: ok, thank you, don't worry about it.\n\nVery disappointed. I hope the owner reads this review and execute a plan if she/he cares. Otherwise, someone could get sick if these are the practices of handling food there.\n\nI would have returned if it was just for $ issue but i wouldn't be able to eat/drink anything there anymore. \n\nI do have to say, one of the waitress tried changing the drink for me after the fact, as she felt bad, but was not successful.

Now I used to come here growing up which is 15+ years, and my experience today was hands down the worst and not the Tinajas I remember. I came here a year ago with my mom and the food was ehhhh not the usual and today the food was disgusting. We only ate it because we were so hungry and the restaurant we originally wanted to eat at was closed and Las Tinajas was nearby. I ordered the vegetarian plate and my company ordered two Plato Tipico's and my boyfriend grilled chicken, he had to wait for his food. So all of our plates had stale platano maduros, and the other two had fried pork that was straight fat that it was inedible. And the best part which is the fried cheese, was soooo hard and dry and very disappointing. Maybe the plantains and cheese are days old because it definitely isn't fresh. \nThen the boyfriends plate came, when he ordered he was asked if he wanted rice or rice and beans and he asked for rice and beans. His plate comes with white rice and when he asked to change it, the lady said ok. She returns and said its an extra charge which was ok with him. He gets up. Goes to the register and pays extra. Smh. It's not about the money but good customer service would have just changed it. He is too served stale and dry plantains and his chicken was dry and charred. \nAlso the buffet style line makes your food cold as you wait to pay and order drinks. \nSo to sum it all up. Overpriced, days old food with HORRIBLE customer service. Save your money and go elsewhere. Now I need to find another Nicaraguan restaurant.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

Unique selection of drinks at the front as well - would certainly recommend experimenting and trying some out.  \n\nKeep in mind however that this place is cafeteria style and is not a place where the ambiance will impress anyone.

The menu is in both Spanish and English, but the staff is more or less leaning in the Spanish direction.\n\nI went for the daily special which was Carne de Res, rice and beans -- in MASSIVE portions. It was a little ridiculous. Three heaping mounds of these basic items just plopped onto my plate. Nothing else, but on the tables they give you a huge bucket of pickled onions and green salsa. I doused my food accordingly. I washed it all down with Orchata (note the lack of 'H' ... it's still rice milk).\n\nThe place was clean and not a taqueria by any standard.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-09", "description": "I have read the reviews about this great Nicaraguan business located in the heart of the Mission District, and I do have to say for the most part the reviews have been spot on.  As far as the choices for Nicaraguan cuisine in the San Francisco Bay Area, the two major hotspots are the \" original \" Mission District-based Nicaraguan restaurant \" El Nicaragua \" which is located just a little further down the street from Las Tinajas, and as far as authentic Nicaraguan food goes I have to say El Nicaragua is a tad more consistent in it's actual \" Nicaraguan \" flavor, although Las Tinajas is a tad more tastier.  Let me illustrate to you the obvious examples, solely based on the cuisine:\n\n     The first and most obvious point of contention between this restaurant and \" El Nicaragua \" is that the couple who owns this restaurant are Chinese Nicaraguans, and yes THERE ARE MANY ASIAN Nicaraguans, as well as Arab, Jew, German, French, Spanish, and other peoples from many parts of the world who settled in Nicaragua and somehow managed to arrive here.  The little I know about the couple is that they fled during the Sandinista Revolution, most likely to escape political persecution at the hands of the new Marxist regime.  Being that they are Chinese Nicaraguans, it is not surprising that some of the aspects of Chinese cooking is reflected in the way they cook their own brand of Nicaraguan food, particularly the GARLIC they seem to oversaturate their food with, which is not a standard ingredient that is used overabundantly in Nicaraguan food \" back home \" but we are here in the States and cos of the lack of Nicaraguan restaurants in the Bay Area who can complain?  This restaurant is as close to \" authentic \" Nicaraguan food as possible, the national drinks such as the pitaya, cacao, tiste, chicha and others is a tad oversweetened, the gallo pinto is good to excellent although I am not quite sure if they use the standard Nicaraguan red beans or pinto beans which Mexicans prefer... the last time I was there ( exactly one month ago ) my plate of Antojitos Las Tinajas was of the same consistent quality I have expected from my food at this restaurant all the years I have been going there, although the carne asada was a bit tough and ultimately very hard to swallow, literally!  The rest of the food was good, and since I rarely order anything but Antojitos I really can't say much about anything else on their menu, although my brother loves their lengua, which is all he eats anyway.  If you want a TRULY AUTHENTIC Churrasco estilo Nica then you will most likely have to fly to one of the Somoza-owned \" Los Ranchos \" restaurants that are in Miami, otherwise this is as good as it gets if you're don't want to spend 13 hours on a plane to Managua.  Thumbs Up, and I hope the quality of the food here stays consistent for a long time to come.", "author": "Gonzalo O."}

To me, it tastes just like homemade cooking.  Yes, I've had better homemade Nicaraguan food---but hey if you're looking for a Nicaraguan restaurant then you can't be picky because there are not many!  My family has also ordered large quantities of food for parties and such.\n\nThe format of the place is somewhat like a \"cafeteria\".  You get in a line with a tray and place an order, which is either filled immediately if it is a basic item such as the plato nica especial or you receive a number if they need to cook it special (i.e. carne asada).    I think the pricing is all relative because I would not call this place \"expensive\" since most plates are within 10 -15 bucks.   The food is tasty and the servings are generous.  I suppose it is \"expensive\" within Mission District standards, but the place is basically a monopoly on good authentic Nicaraguan food in the city.  It's not like taquerias, which you can find on every corner and therefore the pricing is cheaper due to heightened competition.\n\nYou move down the line to get drinks and desserts.   The drinks are an assortment of Nicaraguan beverages.  Try the cacao --- its Nicaraguan chocolate milk and its great.   It is made fresh from the cacao beans, which is why you will see the little pile of grinds at the bottom of you cup when you finish.\n\nSome folks are turned off by the cafeteria style routine, but I love it because you get your food quickly.

I had not been to this restaurant in about 4 years (mostly because I live in Campbell), today though we decided to make the drive up and re-visit this place. The food was as amazing as I remember it! I enjoyed every last bite! And Yes while it is a bit on the expensive side, I've eaten at more expensive restaurants that didn't give the portions Las Tinajas does. The service is amazing. I can't wait to go back and have another carne asada plate!", "author": "Becky B."}

They have goo Nicaraguan food here starting from the gallo pinto& platanos frito.. MMMMMMmmmm.. The only thing here is that the food is somewhat pricy which I find to be ridiculous because c'mon for a plate of rice & beans with steak theyre going to charge about $20. Yea rather cook at home!

The routine is to grab a tray, order from the cafeteria-style line, and get a number. Get seated and the waitresses bring you your food when it's ready!! While waiting to order, I saw this plate packed to the sky with meat and rice and asked another person what it might be as the server behind the counter wasn't there. It was \"Churrasco Nica\" ($18) which is served with fileted tenderloin marinated with parsley and olive oil, and comes with steak fries. I asked for that and got a passionfruit drink (tasty) and waited not more than a few minutes when it was served. The place was packed when I entered and thought this must be a sight: an asian who speaks (and ordered in) spanish in a Nica place. The food was tasty with good flavor (me likes dat), the drink was good and I truly totally enjoyed my meal. Though it's a bit pricey, I wouldn't mind stopping back in here when in the area. I also tasted a rice custard and while I like/love egg custard, don't like any other type of custard. It was quite good with a bit of cinnamon on top. The place was very clean and the women worked quickly to clear and clean the tables. I've found another place to speak spanish!! Street parking only but by a milagro parked right in front!!", "author": "Tony L."}

SO YOU MUST GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!! The only nicaraguan food better than this place is the nica food my mom makes.  \nSo back to Achiote, you might know it as anise seed.  Mix achiote with cumino (cumin) and you have the best dressing for a side of beef.  And boy is it some good steak.  \nI will warn you in advance, the portions are huge, and you will drop $50.00 on lunch for three, but it is money well spent.  (I recommend you bring an appetite, and para los verdadero nicoyas, bring your own tupperware;))\nIf this is your first time trying Nicaraguan food be sure and try the plato typico.  This platter combines some classic food items, such as platanos fritos (maduro, and not so maduro.)  You will also enjoy the gallo pinto (rice and beans) made with frijoles de seda (these are not plain ole' pinto beans, these shits are imported.)  \nBe sure to try some of the funky colored drinks.  I recommend Pinole (it is like horchata, but is corn/cacoa based, ) or my personla favorite, sebada (pink barley based goodness.)\nAt this point if you are still hungry have some dessert.  Maybe some rice pudding, I don't know.\nWhat are you doing still reading this?  get your @ss down to the mission and check this place out!!!", "author": "international super bert a."}

I am a big eater, and can usually finish what's on my plate, but the last time I was there--for lunch on a Saturday--I ordered the bajo stew and finished about half of it.  I could barely finishthe leftovers for dinner.  It was the kind of heavy, starchy food that puts one into a stupor after eating.  This may sound bad to some people, but sometimes, that's what you need.  I'd never had Nicaraguan food before but some friends really like the soup and so I went up to Las Tinajas for lunch.  The prices aren't super cheap, should they really be for the quality and portion size at Las Tinajas?  I really like the cafeteria-style dining with so many delicious choices (gallo pinto, queso frito, cabbage salad, platanos...), and the juices are really good too.  The people who work there are very kind as well and I appreciate it that they spoke to me in Spanish even though I'm fairly obviously a gringo (who speaks pretty good Spanish, though).  The downside is that Las Tinajas is only open for lunch and is closed on Sunday, and because I live and work in the East Bay, it only leaves me one day in the week to get my fix.  I definitely plan my trips to SF on Saturdays now to include a stop for some Las Tinajas.", "author": "Reed A."}
