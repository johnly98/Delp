Of course the whole area is full of tourists and the weather was just so perfect on this particular day, it would have been a shame to not be outside! We stopped on our walk at Flying Ninja, seeing as the place was empty, and sat outside.\n\nI should have known better, but ordered the tempura ramen. My friend ordered the California crunch roll. His roll was pretty tasty and good in portion size. My ramen was good in terms of portion as well, but was rather bland. It was a chicken based broth with what looked more like spaghetti noodles. It tasted more like chicken noodle soup, minus the chicken, as opposed to ramen. The tempura veggies and one shrimp were served on the side. I say I should have known better because I have previously worked in a ramen shop, and you don't go to a sushi restaurant expecting tasty ramen; you expect tasty sushi or rolls. It was also a little odd that the waitress brought out a little caddie or sorts that held the soy sauce/chopsticks/napkins, then asked if she could \"borrow it\" to give to another table. Does the establishment only have one set of soy sauce and napkins? \n\nNot particularly keen on this place and don't really feel a desire to come back.

I must say properly the best sushi I've ever had in North Cal.. Now I know why the golden gate roll is there best seller, it's a spicy tuna roll with cucumbers and more tuna, crunchies, unago sauce on top.. Lion king roll is good for someone who doesn't eat raw fish at all, it's cooked crab meat & salmon with avocado and baked in house sauce.. O'farrel roll was a light tempera deep fried roll with yellow tail & salmon green onion, tabiko & chili sauce.. Amigo roll i can't remember the fish used but I do remember it was wrapped with rice paper instead of seaweed, and it had tabiko, spicy mayo & unagi sauce on top.. Everything was just so amazing here.. The price tag for all this food was well worth the money, simply because of presentation, taste and freshness of everything..  \n\nthe waitress were really attentive with refills and asking us if we needed anything..

Already having eaten, and seeing that the prices were EXTREMELY high, we decided to just order some oyster shooters (after finding out uni was not in season which was not their fault at all). The place was pretty quiet for dinner rush hour (mostly empty) Service was quite rude to us when we asked for 3 oyster shooters (one person also ordered a hand roll, another a water) and had to go check if they had any in stock, after reminding us we need to order at least a portion per person. They came back to reprimand us for not ordering enough food (no rules anywhere saying we had a minimum) and told us we couldn't only order alcohol and the kitchen refused to make our order. Now it's important to note that these were listed under the FOOD appetizers and so we assumed they counted as food. If they were good, we probably would have ordered more. To make it even worse, the staff gathered at the till to loudly complain about us in Korean. Unfortunately for them we had somebody in our group who was fluent as well and translated it all for us. We asked for the bill and they changed $2 for a glass of WATER. That's just spiteful. Do not recommend this place at all. They only had a couple other customers, most of the place was empty, and the staff were all just standing around. No reason to treat us so poorly. Overpriced, rude, and a waste of time. The hand roll was mediocre at best.", "author": "Alba Z."}

Should have took that as a sign that this place wasn't that great. Haha \n\nGot the bento box and the boyfriend got two different rolls. The bento box was meh. I got teriyaki salmon and it looked and tasted like it was microwaveable food. The sushi was also not that great. It wasn't all that fresh. You think it would be since it's by the wharf, but no. For subpar sushi the prices were really high. The 3 item bento box was like 22 bucks and the sushi rolls were like 12 bucks and higher. I guess they can get away with charging prices that high since it is a tourist area though. \n\nIf you're looking for good food it's best not to settle in tourist areas.

It's assortment of raw fish including tuna, salmon, shrimp, white fish, and toko (Japanese octopus)  The fish is not very fresh. Similar to the sushi you get from the grocery at best. Toko smell very fishy, not the usual seafood smell, but the smell when it's out for more than couple days. My friend's mouth will have little bubble when the fish is not fresh. As soon as he tried some pieces, his mouth starts to bubble. Plus, we ask for non-caffeine tea because my friend has sore throat.  The waitress accidentally gave us a low-caffeine tea and told us that was non-caffeine tea. It's definitely a bad night for my friend. The $1.5 added-on tempura was not to bad. It came with one tiny straight shrimp tempura, golden sweet potato, and onion ring. The dipping sauce didn't have graded radish. When I asked, the waitress said they do not serve the dipping sauce with radish. Maybe I just used to authentic Japanese restaurant. \n\nThe only reason I was eating here because my friend was sick with fever and  need a bowl of hot soup. After eating the sushi, I felt a bit sick because the fish was not fresh. I didn't try any of the special rolls, so I am not sure how are they.\n\nBottom Line: Don't eat here unless someone put a gun on you, so you must to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-03", "description": "For the rest of our second afternoon, Joe and I wandered around past Fisherman's Wharf, and we stumbled on Flying Ninja. I was actually looking for something quick to eat, a light snack to round off the chowder we ate earlier for lunch.\n\nThere were a few tables seated, a majority looking like tourists also wandering around the area. The interior was quite modern, with large glass windows facing the main sushi bar, letting in great natural light. We were seated closer to the back of the restaurant, a small room that I assume could be made into a private room for such functions. This section was completely opposite, with barely any light coming in, and a TV screen on the far wall. Totally different atmosphere!\n\nThe menu is extensive ranging from small appetizers, hot entrees, sashimi, nigiri, rolls, and even udon and ramen bowls. Having our fair share of ramen already, we opted for something light. We originally wanted to order an assorted nigiri dish but our server advised us against it. When asked why, she shyly commented that the sushi chef was a new hire and not as experienced with nigiri yet, but more familiar with the other dishes, particularly the rolls. Their rolls did look fairly unique but I mainly wanted different bites of food, rather than order one roll between the two of us.\n\nSo we decided to start with the ahi tuna poke. The tuna was nicely seasoned, although could have used a longer time in the marinade. Served on a bed of mixed greens, I though of it more as a salad. It wasn't until I ate some of the greens when I realized a lot of the sauce or marinade was underneath! The fish was fresh though, nice and slightly firm. For the price, it was actually a substantial dish, especially when we both thought it was a small plate when ordering from the menu.\n\nOur sushi combo came with miso soup and a salad. Seeing that we only ordered one sushi plate to share, I was surprised when she gave us each our own sides. Bonus! The miso soup tasted different from all others that I've tried before although I have no idea why. It seemed more flavorful, and definitely more salty than usual. A good start! I absolutely love Japanese style salads and their dressings. I finished my bowl in no time and moved to Joe's bowl seeing that he only ate the cucumber slices and wasn't too keen on eating the rest. Too many vegetables?\n\nSushi combo B was an assortment of salmon, tuna, white and yellow fish for a total of 16 sashimi pieces. Beautifully presented and the pieces were quite large. It also came with a bowl of rice (each!), although that didn't arrive until much after. Not sure what the hold up was, perhaps the fresh rice wasn't ready yet but Joe had no complaints and ate his, while I decided not to waste and told our server to hold on mine.\n\nNormally I would get bored with just eating sashimi for a meal, but the fish was fresh and had a clean finish. Along with bites of my salad, it was the perfect snack for us! Although not the best to get in San Francisco (I'm sure), it was a nice place and fared a lot better than some of the sushi restaurants in Edmonton. With a small capacity, I can imagine this place getting filled up during dinner time. Price is right, location is great, would definitely return if I was in the area and was hankering sushi!", "author": "Cindy N."}

There were only two servers, a man and a woman and they seemed like they had their hands full. It took forever to order and even LONGER to get our food. And when I mean LONG, I mean it took ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LONG. Now, parking at the wharf is not cheap and we must've spent a good $4 before even getting our food. \n\nA man (maybe the manager) finally came out after an hour and gave us edamame beans--something that should've been done after 30 min of waiting. Our food didn't arrive together but I ordered the Chirashi dish and my boyfriend got the lunch bento special with chicken teriyaki, octopus balls and this delicious fried fish cake with tartar sauce. His dish was better than mine since I only received 4 small slices of sashimi with my chirashi. \n\nAfter we received the bill, we noticed we were charged with automatic gratuity which the manager quickly fixed. He also gave us $10 gift certificates as an apology so we would return. I guess we'll visit again on a Sunday (for free parking) and I'll re-review this place again!", "author": "Vikki K."}

We came for dinner and had made reservations. We asked to sit outside and had our 1.5 and 3 year old with us so I asked for the kids menu. There is no kids menu but you have a bento box option which is $19 for dinner. We also ordered four speciality rolls. The sushi was amazing and even though it's pricey-it's decent sized rolls. My husband and I ate every bite of the sushi and my kids enjoyed the bento box. Other reviews said it's pricey but it's sf, you're on the warf and if sushi was cheap-I'd probably be weary to eat it. I didn't give it five stars because I think they should have some kid friendly options, starting with kid friendly cups. We would eat here again!", "author": "Christina P."}

I can't eat at In & Out everyday so looking for reasonable places is difficult. Flying Ninja is a new Japanese Fast Food restaurant that opened up a few months ago. \n\nTheir pricing is considered reasonable for the area therefore I gave it a try. The average price of $9.00 was not worth it at all because their portions are too SMALL for my appetite. I'm so lucky I had a sausage egg McMuffin with 2 hash browns for breakfast to tie me over. Two of my co-workers went to Cold Stones to order smoothies. I'm sure my other two co-workers and I will have to get a deli sandwich later.\n\nWe ordered the following and everything was served in paper bowls or boxes.\n\n1. Eel Bowl\n- No more than 6 pieces of eel and a 1  1/2 servings of rice. $8.50 for this? I can buy a frozen package of eel at Kukje supermarket for $1.99 when its on sale!!!\n\n2. Chicken Teriyaki Bowl\n-  Where's the teriyaki sauce? Are they trying to conserve? Again 6 pieces of chicken and 1  1/2 servings of rice. $8.00 for this? My coworker had a similar tasting chicken teriyaki bowl in the frozen section in Costco. Thank God for Popeye's $2.00 Tuesday! \n\n3. Kimchi Ramen\n- Where's the Kimchi? I paid $.25 more for the Kimchi ramen for 2 pieces of cabbage??? See picture!  You can buy a big bottle at Kukje supermarket for $4.99! Aside from the portion, the miso soup base was tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked.\n\n4. California Roll w/ salad \n- Can't complain here. $7.50 for 8 pieces of Cali roll with 4 green leaf lettuce and a teaspoon of potato salad. \n\n5. Chicken Karaage\n- The Karaage was good and recommended. For $4.75 I would suggest a few more pieces chicken, not just 6 small pieces. Even McDonalds sold 20 chicken nuggets for $4.99!\n\n6. Super Roll\n- I ordered the super roll but after looking at the menu now, I think I received the Tiger Roll. Let me explain what happened. My order was called. I went up to pick up my food and I brought it back to my table. I opened up ALL the boxes and it seems as though I received a complimentary order. After inspecting them and organizing the table, the waiter came back, took the order off my table, brought it back to the counter and gave it to another guest. This is a BIG no no in the restaurant business. How much does some rice and 6 small slices of C-D grade sashimi cost? Can't they make another order? If I was the other guest, I would request for another order. \n\nWord of advice to the owner: If you want to attract more local business, may I suggest serving larger portions? This will bring you more local and tourist business and you can gradually reduce the portions if you want later on down the road. Consider it a Chinese marketing technique. \n\nI didn't have a satisfying experience but i was lucky I was accompanied by good people.", "author": "Scott L."}

Service was great, waitress picked a perfect bottle of dry Sake for us. The tuna and salmon were among the freshest we have ever had, my biggest complaint was that there was not more of a variety. The waitress said they focus on the tourist-friendly items, not much of a demand for sea-urchin or eel in this area. The miso soup was perfect, the salad was pretty good.

It worked out fairly well though. The service was pretty \"meh\" (our food came and we still didn't have our drinks...and it was not busy at all), but the servers were at least pleasant. I also really appreciate the casual environment as we have a two year old and can't do \"fancy\" with her along. I will break down the food for you:\n\nMiso Soup: Yummy, comfort food. I love Miso Soup and their's was very good.\nChicken/Beef Teriyaki: Not bad. Portion seemed a bit skimpy but I give it a solid 3 stars. \nSpicy Tuna Rolls: Totally decent but comparable to grocery store sushi rolls. Just \"pretty good.\" Nothing \"fishy\" or off-putting at all.\nSashimi Tuna: Fresh and delicious. Would totally order this again. \n\nIn all, the bill for 4 people came to around $70 and we were full and our sushi craving was satisfied. The location was good for our touristy selves and we took a short walk over to Ghirardelli square and had some wonderful dessert. \n\nI don't know if I'd eat there again (maybe stop by for a quick sashimi tuna snack?) but it was totally decent.", "author": "Sarah B."}

I was not in the mood for some lame, tourist laden, heavy Italian-American slop. You know what I'm talking about, lame Italian bread drenched in a mix of margarine and butter and a shake of an Italian herb mix served with a tasteless iceberg lettuce dominated salad, some hot house tomatoes and limp carrot strands next to a bowl of linguine and clam sauce where the clams were probably from China...you get the picture. \nI was aching for something kinda clean, something not laden with animal products. So, I stumbled into this little place and stayed because the servers were all so kind. Met two lovely young kids from Korea - one a waitress, the other a sushi chef - who told me in their broken language a bit more about Korean food and how they missed their families.\nI digress...\nThe food. I had the seaweed salad, a shitake roll and a bowl of udon. Simple. All three dishes met my expectations, fulfilled my cravings and didn't bust my budget. \nLike anything in life, it's as much about the people as anything else...\nSo, if you find yourself caught in Fisherman's Wharf Tourist hell and can't bear the thought of another weak bowl of cippionio or pasta carbonara, give this a chance -- and engage your server or chef!", "author": "Annie B."}
