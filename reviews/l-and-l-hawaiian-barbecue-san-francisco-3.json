The mini-size at a regular L&L would be enough to get me stuffed. The one here, I'm only about half filled. The regular here would be about just right for 1 meal, the regular at any other L&L is enough for almost 2 full meals.\nThe chicken katsu at this location is also cooked a bit thin and dry compared to some others. The gravy can help cover a little bit of the lackluster texture. Macaroni salad here is fine.\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, so I wouldn't recommend eating inside; I always get my food to go.

I've been of a fan of L&L Hawaiian Barbecue's from my SoCal days so I was excited to find one close to work. During my first visit I decided to get a small chicken katsu curry ($6.29) to-go which comes with a single scoop of rice and macaroni salad. After ordering it was a small 5 minutes wait and I was on my way.\n\nThe small chicken katsu curry had a small serving size and felt more like a kid's meal. I also forgot to ask for the curry on the side which resulted in the chicken katsu becoming complete soggy by the time I dug in. Overall it was a very disappointing meal. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and come back one more time. During the second visit I got the regular Chicken Katsu curry ($7.99) and this time asked for the curry on the side. Again, I was out in less than 5 minutes. The regular Chicken Katsu curry was a decent lunch portion with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The chicken katsu was fried well, but the chicken fillet was of very low quality with hardly any meat. The curry was extremely salty. The macaroni salad however was pretty good. Overall it was a very average meal.\n\nPrice wise it is pretty cheap for the area, but the quality reflects the price. The same dish at Muracci's will be almost 40% more expensive and even in the food court next door will be 25% more. This is one of the rare places that you can eat on a budget in the area, but keep in mind you get what you pay for.

This one is in a convenient location near my work that's easy to get to by transit or by walking. The menu is a bit overwhelming at first glance since it's the same (as far as I know) as other L&Ls.\n\nDuring my most recent visit here, I did notice a few differences from the last time I've been here. The quality seems to have gone down somewhat and the portion sizes have gotten smaller. I ordered the chicken katsu, but I guess I should have read some of the other reviews first. It was dry and hard, and even the macaroni salad seemed somewhat dry. \n\nSo I'm thinking either the experiences people have at this location are inconsistent if this was an off day, or things are just permanently changed now.

I asked for status again and again she said \"you ordered the ramen burger.\" I replied \"so?\" She said \"the ramen burger takes longer.\" I said \"you don't say that on the menu.\" She just shrugged and then blew me off -- no apologies, nothing.

With mainland operations being primarily in the West Coast, some other areas of the U.S. primarily New York have seen sightings. Is this a great introduction into \"Hawaiian\" food if you've never had it? I would say yes, but please tread lightly. L&L being my intro into \"Hawaiian BBQ\" and then later down the line being invited to Luau's and things of that nature. It's hard to not be kinda uptight, especially if you've had the \"Real Experience\" not to say L&L isn't that, but this location didn't live up to expectations. Here is my review.\n\nTue Aug 2, 2016 - 6:15 pm, In a mission to expand my \"Yelp\" horizions, I got hungry and wanted to visit a place that I had never been before. Solo and lookong through my bookmarks up poped L&L Hawaiian BBQ Kerney St. They had something I've never tried before so I knew I had to try it.\n\nAtmosphere - 4/5\nFood - 3/5\nService - 3/5\n\nBackground - That something that I never had was a \"Ramen Burger\" and my stomach being on \"Empty\" I knew it was finally time to give it a shot. A ramen noodle buns....I was sold!\n\nLocation - This L&L location sits on the ever busy Kerney St, the side near the \"Financial District\" so this side of the stretch definitely gets all the foot traffic, and hungry people. A small \"Hole in the Wall\" makes up this location.\n\nFood:\n  I went in, took a look at the menu and decided of course..on the Ramen Burger, I added an \"Egg\" which made it \"Loko Moko\" style..Kinda. It didn't have the brown gravy..bummer. I got a Hawaiian Breeze drink and a side of macaroni salad to round everything out and make a meal.\n\n Ramen Burger - It wasn't like the picture. It was very. \nbland and not exciting at all. The picture made it look like it was something you could hold in your hand and chomp away like..\"A Burger\" after a drowning in teriyaki sauce, it became something more tolerable. The burger had to be eaten with a knife and fork because the noodles came apart. The meat patty was nice and well done and the chopped green onion was nice. But over all, the presentation sucked and this would of all worked better perhaps as a \"Saimin\" dish alone.\n\n Macaroni Salad - Not the best \"Hawaiian Style\" mac salad I've ever had, just as bland and flavorless as the ramen burger. Not enough mayo and too much shredded carrots, and no menced \"anchovies\" made this mac salad....\"WEAK\" I'll pass on this another time perhaps.\n\n Service - The \"cute\" girl at the counter was so busy talking on the phone and to the cooks. A few minuets passed before she noticed me. She was pleasant when she got to me though and brought my food out to me which was nice. But a little more attention to customers would of been way nicer.\n\nOverall - An okay meal for a decent price, great location for a pitstop for a quick bite to eat. Still close to all what happinin in SF and BART assessable.\n\nFuture - I'll give it another shot, hold the Mac Salad and Ramen Burger.", "author": "Tre S."}

They were working together only because they were forced to- but I couldn't taste a relationship between the two. \n\nWhat I was really here for, though, was the ramen burger which this L&L debuted earlier this February. It's really just a burger (patty, lettuce) but the bun has been replaced by soft ramen noodles that had been bundled together and likely fried real quickly. I got the loco moco version which added a sunny side up egg to the bun. This was somewhat difficult to hold as the bum got really floppy and was somewhat hot to hold. It was delicious eating the bun and the patty was good as well, but honestly I would have preferred it if the ramen was in tonkotsu broth and the patty was in a legit burger bun. In this case, I can't say that the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.

L&L's decrepit mockery of the normally fulfilling nori capsule offers scant motivation to experience the rest of their menu.\n \nL&L's sloppily wrapped musubi, with its overhanging, tattered seaweed flapping over a paucity of rice, is reminiscent of a discarded, torn Ikea box after the furniture contents have been hastily removed or a Christmas present clearly wrapped by a kindergartener. The layer of rice matches the thinness of the slice of spam, as if both are accountability partners five years into a no-carb diet. Although the katsu is crisply fried and still tender on the inside, the spam is oily, drab, and in dire need of resuscitation. A lazy splotch of katsu sauce accidentally flavors a fifth of the bites.\n \nL&L is guilty of musubi murder.", "author": "Andrew M."}

It is very poor quality, and you don't get what you pay for especially with a $5 delivery fee.\n\nWe ordered the kalua pork and cabbage and laulau.  First things first.  The rice that they gave us was OLD and crusty.  I'm not talking about the good kind of light crust that you sometimes get when the rice is starting to overcook.  I've been eating rice all my life, so I know when it's old.  This was definitely one day old rice.  Whenever I've gotten kalua pork from other L&L locations, it has always been a good portion of food.  Instead, what I got was a small watery mess that they called kalua pork.  If I lumped it all together, it would not even fill half of the container.  Other locations are more generous with their portions and actually fill the whole section of the container.  The laulau is another story altogether.  *SIGH*\nHave you ever seen the movie Aliens or even Prometheus?  If so, do you remember what the alien eggs looked like?  That's what the laulau looked like.  FOR REAL NO JOKE. I've had laulau quite a few times.  You get a nice pouch (which is the ti leaf) with taro leaves and delicious meat inside.  NOT HERE!  The laulau was all dried up taro leaf (hence the Alien reference).  The meat inside was so super dry which kind of defeats the purpose of cooking them in the leaves in the first place. Literally, it was so dry it was on the verge of being too hard to eat.  It was either yesterdays unsold product or just left to cook for more hours (not minutes) than necessary.  It also had a small piece of what I would describe as fish jerky (that's how dry it was) inside with the pork. \n\nNeedless to say, I was SO disappointed with the quality and taste of the food.  Definitely NOT onolicious!  Oh yea, to add insult to injury, the food was also cold when I got it.  Yeah, I know that part's not their fault, but I could've dealt with delicious room temperature food.  People should not eat what I got there at any temperature.", "author": "Pepper Ann H."}

The foods good, though a little pricey for what you ultimately get, but I am only giving it two stars for two reasons.  \n\n#1:  Don't use the online ordering option here, at Eat24, elsewhere, etc.  Everytime I do it takes longer to get my order that I made ahead of time than it would have if I'd just ordered at the counter.  The people there have told me that I should call if I want my food quickly, but why have an online ordering option if it's not going to work.  Get rid of that option if it's not working.\n\n#2:  They have the flimsiest, cheapest plastic cutlery anywhere.  When many of the items on your menu contain tough, stringy cuts of meat like the short-ribs at least have take-out cutlery that can cut through said food.  I thought I'd figured out the \"system\" by planning to use my own steak knife whenever I ordered meat I expected to be tough/stringy, but the forks also are so flimsy that you can't use them to hold down the meat while you're cutting it.

Once I ordered a loco moco and got 2 eggs, but both were very over cooked. The gravy is also a lighter flavor... too light if you ask me.

Burger patty -  clearly a frozen patty resembling the look of a piece of cardboard with a very bland taste;\n2.  Ramen \"bun\" - too small for the size of the burger patty, very dry and fried too hard but still failed to hold the burger together when I attempted to hold and eat like a \"traditional\" burger, I ended up giving up and eating with the fork and knife provided (ah ha moment - \"No wonder they gave these to me!\", really came in handy);\n3.  Fried egg- I ordered it medium and it was overcooked, the yolk was cooked solid throughout not at all a little runny like I like my medium fried eggs to be;\n4. Gravy, Green Onions, etc. - The saving grace of this ramen burger, it gave the rest of the components some moistness and flavor, without these things, it would've been very hard for me to eat this.\n\nOverall, I would go there again if I was starving, in the area and no other burger place was open.

So I decided to swing it and walked to this place that also doubled for a good walk and release some of that bad office air.  I got to the place just a bit before noon and there was only 1 customer in the place.  The one lady running the counter appeared oblivious to my presence and was more preoccupied answering the phone.  Nobody smiles in this place and the island spirit, if any, has definitely passed the place.  After a few minutes of shuffling trying to engage someone with an eye contact, I was attended to by the manager.  I went for the menu's flagship and gastronomic mission of the day - Kahlua Pork and Pork LauLau Combo with elbow Macaroni salad and brown rice to the tune of $12.28.  It took about 5 minutes and the order was called by the smile deprived counter lady.  Nobody looks happy here!  That's bad vibe.  I tried to ignore the negative vibe and stayed on course full of gusto, excitement and anticipation. Opened the box and the package had pretty good temperature with a whiff of steam.  Then, the first bite! And another. Then another.  WTF?  No flavor other than taste of boiled pork with a hint of salt wrapped in taro leaf.  What a disappointment!!!  I hate wasting food knowing that despite the lack of flavor and disappointment, I am still blessed to have something to eat.  So up I go to the condiment counter.  The selection is between schiracha, watery teriyaki sauce ( which I think should've been labeled tempura sauce) and kechup.  Teriyaki sauce it is.  I rained that sauce on my pricey and bland Hawaiian style pulled pork to make it edible.   That was the only way I can get it down.\n\nAccording to friends and family, I am a good cook.

I bit into the shrimp and a stream of grease shot out and all over my pants. I don't know what the batter was but this sure did not taste like shrimp. The Mahi Mahi barely tasted like fish... it honestly tasted almost exactly like the shrimp. I took 3 bites and threw the rest away. Later in the day I honestly felt sick because of the grease I ingested. I will never go to this place again. Ugh.", "author": "Daniel W."}

However, I have to say that the San Fran L&L is my favorite.\n\nI eat here, a lot. too much probably, but I dont care. When they get it right, they get it RIGHT. Their chicken katsu is golden and delicate and delicious and falls apart in my mouth. When they do it right. Maybe it was a different cook, maybe not, but I have definitely had it there before and it made me go \"WTF is this crap! This is NOT from the regular katsu guy\". But i still went back.\n\nThe macoroni salad is pretty good, I've had better but I've also had a lot worse.\n\nThe Spam musubi has a perfect ratio of rice to spam and the smell of it always makes me hungrier and hungrier as I walk to the park with my lunch.\n\nDo you love salt? Do you secretly dream about going back to middle school JUST for the cafeteria grade salisbury steak? THEN GET THE LOCO MOCO. Sure it may be crazy sounding and gross looking (to some!) but holy cow is it tasty.\n\nNot into fried food with gravy? Ok, try the healthy plate! The simple salad is actually really tasty, and the fish is AMAZING. They use Basa, not Mahi Mahi, but its just as good. The only issue is that I wish they gave you more fish.\n\nI'm not into the shrimp katsu, but I've only gotten once. it was overcooked, but who knows maybe that was the bad katsu guy again.\n\nWanna get your lunch faster? Go to sanfranciscolandl.com to get the menu and call ahead. \n\nSuper friendly staff too!\n\nI wish i could give 3 1/2 stars, cause its better than just A-OK, but has its flaws, like any quick short order restaurant is prone to.\n\nAnd why do I eat there so much? Because the portions are (usually) large enough to last me two days!

That's when it takes a U.S. State in the Pacific Ocean to abolish those vegetables, pile on the heavy starches and BBQ up some fatty meats!  This is a fast food joint so don't expect it to be as good as your honeymoon resort luau or home cooking your tutu used to fix up back on the islands.  However, it will help satiate your hankering with a spectrum of uneven dishes from excellent musabi to nasty BBQ chicken.  Give it a few chances and you're sure to hone in on some personal favorites.\n\nSpam Musabi: Who'd thought that Hawaiian villages and mainland trailer parks had so much common?  Spam is definitely an under appreciated meat by most city folk, present company included.  When thinly sliced, grilled, surrounded by warm rice and warm/soft seaweed it makes quite a statement!  This freshly made musabi was in perfect proportions to let the excess grease fall in and flavor the rice.\n\nPortuguese Sausage Musabi: Similar to the Spam Musabi, except even better!  The sausage was thinly sliced in the style of the spam which let it's spicy juices flavor the rice even more so.\n\nBBQ Beef: Super thin slices of meat slathered with BBQ sauce and cooked until crispy doneness. There are some fatty patches throughout, but the level of well doneness makes them quite enjoyable.  Probably my favorite meat option.\n\nBBQ Short Ribs: It's good to have a short rib alternative outside of Korean joints.  Short ribs are a humble cut of meat that asks only to be cooked very well done.  Decent, though I wish they were fresh off the grill instead of lukewarm.\n\nBBQ Chicken: Was there a sale on dark meat?  A bit of dark meat is good, but the entire chicken portion being dark was a tad overkill.  It didn't seem to play as well with the marinade as the beef and was too thick to gain any crispy textures.\n\nMacaroni Salad: Why exotic Hawaiians took to eating an overly common side dish from suburban picnics on the mainland U.S. escapes me.  Pretty simple with elbow macaroni, carrots shreds and tons of mayo.  Tasty because it is so creamy, but leaves a strange after taste.", "author": "Adam B."}

Over the last few years, there have been a multiple L&L's and Ono hawaiian bbq franchises that have popped up all over the bay area. Sadly, dining at this L&L did not remind me of Hawaiian adventures. Instead, it reminded me of Chinatown restaurants that substitute old meat and watered-down sauces instead of using traditional sauces and ingredients. I ordered the 1/2  & 1/2 bbq chicken/beef combo, and both meats were horrible. The chicken was dry and the beef was extremely fatty. \n\nHowever, I will say that the staff was extremely friendly, my order was made in a short amount of time, and the restaurant was immaculately clean.

I put plate lunch into my top 3 favorite dining experiences. \n\nSo plate lunch is a Hawaiian thing, it's also vaguely Asian. A plate lunch typically consists of two scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad, and some sort of grilled meat. The grilled meat can range from Teriyaki beef, Korean Kalbi, Japanse Katsu etc. Seriously BBQ meat, rice and mac salad. What else do you need?\n\nPlate lunch is for big eaters. You're not getting out of there for less then 2500 calories... My favorite brunch item is the \"Loco Moco\".

I instantly ditched my plans of going to Latte Express #5 for my favorite Vietnamese sandwich, and breathlessly ordered a mini chicken katsu lunch plate, as if the L&L would disappear before my eyes if I didn't speak quickly enough.\n\nThe food here, though, can't really be described as magical - it's hearty, filling, comforting, and cheap. Don't be fooled by the dinky \"mini\" container. They pack it very full, and it's a perfect amount for lunch. The choices at L&L are many (chicken, pork, beef BBQ; musubi; breakfast items; noodles; seafood; burgers; sandwiches; salad), but I think going with a combo plate is the way to go because you get a scoop of the totally crucial mac salad. Of course, you could always get a side order of mac salad for just $0.99, which I might do because I'm obsessed with it.\n\nMy total (along with a can of Hawaiian Sun mango-orange drink) was just over $7.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-09", "description": "The remark you hear from patrons of Hawaiian restaurants is often regarding how large the servings are.  That's definitely NOT the case here.  In fact, the portions are quite meager for the price (about $7.50 for a regular meal, which includes a tiny bit of meat, two miniscule scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad).  \n\nSomething seemed to have happened after they shut down for a remodel about a year ago.  When they re-opened, the portions shrunk, leaving plenty of jostling room in the already small take-out containers.  Maybe as part of the update they brought in a food-shrinking machine.  Or, maybe management realized they could help pay for the remodel by giving out less food at higher prices.\n\nAnyway, much of the food is good, there's just not enough of it.  I like the chicken katsu and the kalua pork best.  If you go, be sure to ask for their frequent diner card, which will get you a free half-size meal after you purchase 9 regular ones.  My speculation is that this freebie is the portion they held back on from the other nine you bought before, but what do I know.", "author": "Kevin W."}

Seating is limited, so takeout is recommended (especially during peak dining hours). Prices are very cheap and reasonable for the amount of food in each order.\n\n(A tangent: I feel like most of the restaurants along Kearny Street (in the Financial District/Nob Hill area) are all \"grab-n-go\" kind of places; nothing super-spectacular should expected from them, but they're not incredibly horrible either.)\n\nI was pleased with L&L giving different portion size options for customers; I went with the \"Mini\" portion and upon first sight of my meal, I knew I had made the right choice. The menu includes meat entrees, sandwiches, musubi, and even breakfast (served all day). There's also a choice of relatively \"healthier\" fare, and customers can \"upgrade\" to a scoop of brown rice instead of rice. Mm, way to get some complex carbs in!\n\nI ordered the Loco Moco, which was a hamburger steak with gravy and an egg on top. Warm, fresh, delicious. The rice was a little moist (maybe due to the gravy?) but very satisfying. L&L is definitely a neat place for a quick lunch or early dinner.\n\nHm, what I did not like about L&L was the pure waste of plastic boxes/bags that they used. They surely don't discriminate when it comes to people eating in or doing takeout; everyone receives their order in a plastic box with a plastic bag. While serving the food in plasticware gives the customer a choice of eating a little at L&L and then taking the rest home, I didn't think it was necessary to use so much plastic.

Other than the Hukilau, L and L does a fine job of serving some quality Hawaiian fast food. \n\nLet's get this aside: L and L won't win any awards for healthiness. There's just a hint -- eh, more like a downpour -- of grease in the fried foods, and every dish is extremely caloric dense. It's definitely not weight-watchers friendly.\n\nBut if you don't mind running an extra block, then prepare yourself for some great grub. First, sample their mixed-plate or the chicken katsu plate. Or, for those who live dangerously, upgrade it to a regular plate, not mini. Weighing in at more than two pounds, a regular chicken katsu plate contains two slices of fried chicken on top two scoops of rice, as well as macaroni salad drenched in mayonnaise. And, oh, ask them for curry on top -- it's delicious.\n\nNot everything is great, however. Behind the counter, the cashiers are remarkably inane, slow to take and process your order. When this L and L first opened, under intense pressure, the service was painfully slow often botching their orders. Thankfully, things have smoothed out, but there are still plenty of hiccups. What the Hawaii L&L's excels in efficiency, the SF location squanders in incompetence. \n\nA word of warning: Don't let the cheap breakfast lure you in. Only  3.99? Sold...well, not quite. Unlike the heartiness of a plate lunch, the breakfast plates are neither satisfying nor fulfilling. There's a lack of food, in fact. No wonder the price is so cheap. Two lousy slices of Spam, a diminutive scoop of rice, and one sorry egg -- that's where your money went. Down the drain.", "author": "Richard L."}

The pull of pool tables and bars was too strong -- he was kicked out of college for being a heavy drinker and skipping class too often. \n\nBasically, a real Family Man type.  And my exact opposite.  \n  \nTo him, no amount of ridicule was too excessive.  \n  \nHere's an example: I had a short-lived fondness for dolls (Barbie, Ken, and Skipper) in Elementary School.  Of course, the kids didn't take too kindly to this.  I returned home from school one day, a 10-year old distraught and in tears over a particularly harsh browbeating from my classmates.   \n  \nDad: What's wrong, Darin? \nMe: The kids, they were teasing me. \nDad: What were they saying? \nMe: They were calling me a fag and a little girl. \nDad: Oh, that's okay.  Next time they say that, just hit them on the head with your PURSE. \n  \nCharming. \n  \nThen, as a 13-year old, I refused to shower after gym because I feared the attraction to my male classmates would be too apparent. \n  \nDad: So where are your old clothes? \nMe: Oh, I'm wearing them. \nDad: Huh?  You took a shower and put on your stinky clothes again? \nMe: Uhhhh, no...I actually didn't shower. \nDad: You didn't shower after the gym? \nMe: No, I usually don't. \nDad: Why not? \nMe: ..... \nDad: Look, just take a fucking shower after the gym, son.   There's nothing to be embarrassed about.  Everyone there has a dick. \nMe: ..... \n  \nOf course, what I really wanted to say was \"YES, THAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM!!  I WANT THEIR DICKS!!\" or \"THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK DAD -- I'M A FUCKING GIRL, REMEMBER?!?!?!\" \n  \nI'm not ashamed to admit I hated my Father back then, and that's only because I really  love him now.  Over time, I've come to realize my Dad was in fact teaching me a very important life lesson: in our own ways, we're all broken.  So we've got to laugh at our misfortunes and turn our personal tragedies into comedy -- that \"wild laughter in the throat of death\" Bataille described.  Since I was a petulant child at the time, the lesson went over my head; now, as an adult, I embrace it.  And as both of us grow older, I am thurst more into the 'adult' role while he regresses to that of the 'child.'   \n  \nDad: So Darin, I bought a new car. \nMe: Oh really, which one? \nDad: A Porsch Carrera \nMe: What?!? \nDad: A silver one.  They had a flourescent yellow one, too, it was REAL NICE, but I decided to go for the silver. \nMe: Dad, are you like TOTALLY FUCKING NUTS?!?  Isn't this your, like, third mid-life crisis?  What the fuck?  Are you and Mom not having sex anymore or something?  Is the magic gone?\nDad: Hahahahaha! \nMe: Do you know how much that shit costs? You can't afford that!\nDad: Yeah, which reminds me.  I'm sorry to tell you, son, but between our trips and the car, we're spending ALL your inheritance. \nMe: Oh thanks a fucking lot.\nDad: You'll inherit our debts.\nMe: That's it, I'm SO sending your ass to fucking Shady Pines!\nDad: Haha...So I also needed to buy a seat belt extension since the belt wouldn't fit around my stomach. \nMe: Well that's what you get for being such a fat fuck!  Lay off the Cherry Garcia!  Walk -- exercise -- dammit!\nDad: HAHAHAHA, eh, Mom, Darin just called me a fat fuck! \nMom: Yeah well he's right! \nDad: Aw Ma, I love you!  Come here and give me a kiss! \n  \nAnyway, Dad and I love plate lunches.  We've eaten them all our lives.  It's almost a religious experience; a quiet thing shared between Father and Son.  I don't usually patronize L&L when I'm back in Hawai'i since the founders, Eddie Flores and Johnson Kam, are GOP supporters; I try not to funnel my cash to companies in bed with political parties that condemn me at the same time as one of their members gives blowjobs below bathroom partitions.   But I am limited in my choices downtown.  And I am weak, not strong. Sometimes I miss my Father.  \n\nEvery now and then, I'll endure a long wait in a restaurant pimping a stereotype, pick up a Kalua Pig plate, luxuriate in the lardy goodness of the mayonnaise mac salad and the thin strips of salty pork, and laugh quietly to myself.

I'm from the Bay Area originally and, although there's a lot I like about being back in San Francisco, I miss local grinds (er, Hawaiian local food).  They have kalua pig and lau lau...!!  This is bigtime comfort food for me.  Everything's packed with sodium and carbs.  I can't really manage it more than once a week or so, but there are healthy-ish options.  Try the barbecue chicken salad--it's a couple of boneless teriyaki-ish thighs cut up over sliced tomato and romaine lettuce.  Simple and elegant--you get your barbecue chicken fix without all the carbs and fat from the rice and macaroni salad.  The mac salad is dead-on local.  God, is it good.  They have not just the traditional spam musubi, but also musubi made with barbecue chicken, portuguese sausage, and other meats, AND they make them fresh when you order.  For under two bucks, you can get a right nice breakfast.  Speaking of breakfast--L&L serves it all day.  I learned living in Hawai'i the joys of rice (fried rice more ono, though) with breakfast.  Here you can get fried egg, bacon and rice.  --Or portagee sausage and egg and rice.\n\nThe folks who work there are quiet, friendly, low-key, and efficient.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-06-27", "description": "One word review:  Meh.\n\nFood:  I've had a fair amount of Hawaiian plate lunches from various restaurants, both around SF, and on the islands, and as far as food quality goes, this L&L is fairly mediocre.  The chicken in the katsu is sometimes sliced a bit too thin, throwing off the meat:breading ratio, plus it tends to create an overly crunchy crust (too crunchy = bad.  crispy = good).  The rice scoops are a little on the small side (which is actually fine if you're doing the whole low/no-carb thing, plus most people can't finish a whole plate anyways).  The hamburger patties used (at least for the loco moco and hamburger steaks - haven't tried a regular burger) are pretty thin too.  Not to say any of the dishes I've had here are inedible, but they're \"just ok\".  For those times when you're downtown, and just want some comfort food (mmmm, spam musubi) or a bunch of grub, it hits the spot pretty well.   However, if you're not downtown, there are better options for mix plates in/near the city.  \n\nService:   They've all been pretty nice, though the service is still a tad slow (exponentially better then when they first opened though).  I suppose a bit of extra wait is worth it for fresher food (as opposed to the steam table stuff you get elsewhere).  There's always a crowd though at lunch time, even early at like 11:30.  It tends to clear up a bit later on.  \n\nI wish they were open for breakfast, since they have breakfast items on their menu (rice, eggs, and spam/portugese sausage), but alas, they don't open that early.", "author": "T C."}
