Toppings are fresh and tasty. The oven is clearly cranked up to 11 and the crew means business. \n\nSomeone told me the crew came from Blue Plate, which is a smart bistro where I've never had any pizza, so know that pivots aren't just for startups.\n\nOne important thing to note is that this is in the outer sunset near the coast and that means that if you're not near the 10 usual suspect neighborhoods that reliably have good food options and instead you are in the vast landscape of residential row houses (pacific style) that undulates across the dunes that swallowed Carville, then you're in luck! You have found a superb dinner option of kick-A pizza. \n\nIf you're looking online you might see a menu that references pizza sizes of 14 inch and 20 inch. Be aware that in the case of 20 inch, that is a measure of the ultimately boxed pie's radius, not its diameter as you might assume.", "author": "Craig S."}

I normally come here after long walks around the richmond and sunset side of town and end up grabbing way too much food for my own good and treat myself to a whole spaghetti and meatballs, a slice of pizza and diet coke. \n\nThe margherita pizza is decent and they put tons of basil which I like. I love a good pizza, but the crust is whats most important to me and this pizza doesn't have quite a crust that I look forward to eating but I still eat it. Its on the thinner more dense side. \n\nI love the pasta though...it reminds me of elementary school pasta. Probably not a good compliment but nostalgic food is always a winner. Literally just noodles with three meatballs and two slices of garlic bread. I have an affinity for noodles and this hits the spot. Plain cooked noodles with red sauce just poured on top as if your grandma spiced up a jar of Preggo. \n\nI know i'll be back!", "author": "Nats S."}

I placed our delivery order on Sunday, December 17th at 5:46pm through DoorDash. It arrived at 6:51pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Buffalo Wings: Gluten free, Spicy, chicken wings tossed in buffalo sauce, served with celery stalks, baby carrots and blue cheese dressing or ranch ($9), Large (+ $6)\n*The Dimitri: Sausage, zoe's pepperoni, garlic, mushroom, tomato sauce, and cheese ($22.50 for 14\" Pizza)\n*Cheese: Pizza by The Slice ($4) - Fresh Basil (+$0.50), Mushrooms (+$0.50), Roasted Garlic (+$0.50), Vegan Pesto (+$0.50)\n\nI really love places that deliver pizza by the slice, so that's the main reason I chose this spot. I'm a lover of variety, so any time I want pizza, I always want a meaty one and another one with pesto. The slice I ordered was a good size. I actually cut it in half and it fed me twice. The roasted garlic was amazing, but it did make the slice super oily. I didn't mind since I love fatty food, but it might be too much for some people. It's good to note that they cannot do slices without red sauce as the pizzas are the pre-made cheese ones and they just add toppings. The dmitri was yummy as well. I adore a good meat and mushroom pizza, so this hit the spot. And it was a good size as the roommate and I made about three meals out of the pizza. The buffalo wings were standard. Though they gave me one blue cheese and one ranch when I indicated ranch. Oh well, we had ranch at home so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nThis spot definitely fulfilled my pizza craving. It looks like their pizza by the slice has gone up a dollar, but I would still consider ordering from them again. Especially if I'm by myself. That way, I can get a couple different slices. Yum!", "author": "Elena N."}

Why those two sizes? Those are your only options per my phone order. \n\nGarlic cheese bread was ok. No garlic taste and no cheesy taste but the bread was decent and portions were fine for the price.\n\nThe margarita pizza was a joke. When they handed me the box, I looked at it and had to ask if this was just a cheese pizza. They don't use fresh sliced tomatoes ... their alternative was tomato sauce.\n\nThe besto and sunset aloha were good but the slices were a bit too big to hold. The toppings would slide off.

But now ...it's all just a bittersweet memory. \n\nAfter one of those topsy turvy humdrum days, I was looking forward to Wine Wednesday. Alas, it was not meant to be. They were still advertising Wine Wednesday today on Instagram, but when I went in, it was canceled with no explanation. \n\nFirst, they came for the Chile Pork Verde. Then they came for the Antipasta plate. Then the PBR drafts went from 3.00 to 4.50. And now Wine Wednesday--oh, Wine Wednesday, we hardly knew yee--was unceremoniously canceled without a care or concern for the customer. It was a lapse of pizza etiquette that went too far. \n\nWe had some good times, Pizza Place aka Pizza Palace aka I Love PIzza aka I Love Spaghetti aka Ye Old Spaghetti Factory aka My Living Room. But ... the dream is over ...  \n\nNow all I have left are the memories. \"I've got two tickets to paradise, pack your bags, we leave tonight ...\"\n\nAll we are saying is give pizza (and Wine Wednesdays) a chance!\n\nUpdate: It looks like they brought Wine Wednesday Back!!!\n\nUpdate: 12/23/2017. This is an update written at the urging of Yelp HQ. the Star rating has been reduced from 4 to 1. \n\nAfter writing the above humorous review, I did not go back to the Pizza Place for approximately two months. At the urging of employees, who missed my presence, and my friends who go there, I returned to the Pizza Place to celebrate my birthday on October 20th. As soon as I sat down, one of the owners came up to me and verbally assaulted me, basically unloading a stream of anger in front of everyone. It was completely abusive, and entirely retaliatory for the positive Yelp review (which was, at that time, 4- stars). Among much else, he shouted \"no more yelp reviews\" over and over again. Then he said: \"you can sit there, but you are no longer welcome in this establishment.\" And then walked away. I said nothing (there was no room to get a word in edgewise, even if I had wanted to). I just sat there, dumbfounded at how I was treated. I got up and left. Who wants to patronize an establishment whose owners don't want you there?\n\nI was (and still am) in shock and disbelief that any owner of any restaurant would behave this way. It is important to say that my friend, who was there to help celebrate my birthday, was a witness to the verbal assault and abuse that I was forced to endure (on my birthday).\n\nI have lived in this neighborhood for 20 years. After this incident, I consulted with local business owners and managers who I have known a long time (and who know the kind of person I am). They confirmed with me that this particular owner has a history of doing the same thing (verbally haranguing others) in other local establishments. It is so severe, he may not even know what he is saying or doing. This reminded me of a prior incident with this particular owner in which a rep for a local brewery was sitting at the bar and told me how much he loved this place and had always wanted to meet one of the owners. He asked me if I knew any of them. I called this same owner over by name and introduced him as my friend and ... a stream of obscenities came out of the owners mouth: at me and at the beer rep. The beer rep gulped his beer down and left. I was embarrassed for him. I blew it off because I knew this owner as someone else. Someone who would never behave this way towards anyone. I had no idea he had changed.\n\nI left any negative details out of my initial review. I don't like to focus on the negative, I like to create, so I wrote a humorous, quirky review full of inside jokes (the kind we all knew from the initial days of Yelp when it was about meeting up with people in bars and restaurants in real life). One thing I left off the review was that when Wine Wednesday was canceled, I asked the server tending the bar why that was done: he had no idea. The same owner who verbally harassed me on my birthday was standing right there. He had adopted a totally agro stance (the same he used in his verbal assault) and was looking at me like: \"go ahead, say something.\" I remembered what had happened with the beer rep just a few weeks earlier and just drank my beer (instead of ordering food, which is why I was there) and left. It was later that night that I wrote my humorous, faux melodramatic review. I never, in a million years, expected it to turn into a real melodrama (like from high school or middle school).\n\nI guess I should add, I have been giving this establishment 1/3 of my paycheck for years.\n\nSpeaking solely for myself, I will never set foot inside this establishment again.", "author": "Rob T."}

Ohhh haha, it's actually called The Pizza Place on Noriega.\n\nI can't complain about how straight forward the name of the pizza joint is, and after my bf and I took a look at the menu, we liked what we saw. We ordered around 7pm and service on the phone was casual but a bit sloppy since it seemed busy in house and the person on the phone was semi-frazzled. We were told that our order would be ready in 45 minutes. Their website notes that it takes about 25-30 minutes to make a pizza so it seemed that this Friday night was extra busy. We picked up our pizza as scheduled and indeed, a good amount of folks were waiting outside to dine in the bustling restaurant. \n\nWe got a 14in pizza, half Rotten Bobby, half The Dimitri and an order of buffalo wings (comes with a dozen). The pizza was delicious and the ingredients were very flavorful. I'm not a fan of thick pizza crust so I was in love with the super thin crust of this pizza. If you want something spicy, go with Rotten Bobby. The Dimitri will fit the bill if you want something garlicky and meaty. The buffalo sauce for the chicken wings was packed in a separate container so that we could toss the wings with the sauce before consumption which was a good idea to prevent soggy wings. The wings still had crispy skin and were also delicious but the blue cheese dressing was very watered down so we ended up tossing it. \n\nOn a less busy day, I'd like to eat in at the actual Pizza Place.

The slice was a little soggy towards the tip, but overall was fine.

Wait can be a little long, especially when they have to fresh make a slice for you.

We settled on The Pizza Place on Noriega since they offer a vegan option, and one of our friends is vegan. It definitely takes a while for them to prepare your pizza, so make sure you order well in advance. We came 30-40 minutes after ordering, and our pizzas were ready. We tried:  \n\n-The Dimitri (Sausage, Zoe's Pepperoni, Garlic, Mushroom, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, 14\" $18.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pizza-place-on-noriega-san-francisco?select=nfqIvgkkuKjx_h2drV3R6Q#lxu-z1bhljUxUUwYhJQkWA): Eh, I didn't like this combination much, and everything was really salty. The thin crust was nice, but I wouldn't order this pizza again.\n-Timmy's Pie (Vegan- Vegan Pesto, Roasted Potatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Mushrooms, Mini Tomatoes, Caramelized Onions, 14\" $16.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-pizza-place-on-noriega-san-francisco?select=nfqIvgkkuKjx_h2drV3R6Q#nfqIvgkkuKjx_h2drV3R6Q): Surprisingly good! The crust wasn't as soft/pliable as the non-vegan one, but the toppings were delicious and flavorful so you didn't miss out on the lack of dairy or meat. Recommended, but mostly for more omnivorous people. \n\nOverall, I doubt I'll be back to The Pizza Place unless I suddenly convert to veganism and was craving pizza. I liked their thin crust, but just didn't think it was as good as some of the other fancier pizza places in the city (Ragazza, A16, Delfina), and their pizza isn't cheap. However, take my review with a grain of salt since we took the pizza to-go, and didn't eat it fresh out of the oven. The staff was friendly but the parking around this area is a nightmare, and I would recommend coming with a friend if you're picking up so that you can double park while the other person runs in to grab the pizza.", "author": "Amy D."}

We followed that up with a slice of their meat pie, which was layered high with just about every fresh meat you could imagine.  Another excellent choice.  Then came our gnarly large 20\" Margherita and Spicoli pizza. Both sides were loaded with cheese and toppings and my favorite was definite the Spicoli with its awesome sausage.  This is definitely not a place to come if you're on a diet, but awesome if you're stoned out of your mind.\n\nThe pizza here is absolutely awesome, but the pesto was what stuck out to me.  It's not cheap, but also not way overpriced either, and definitely fits almost any budget.  While my favorite pie is still the one found at Basic in SD, this is a close second and I can't wait to come back to try some of their other creations.  Ultimately, I failed in my attempt at buying dinner but luckily he let me make it up with ice cream at Polly Ann's.\n\nFood: 8/10\n\nService: 9/10\n\nPrice: $$\n\nAtmosphere: 8/10", "author": "Joe M."}

The slice reminds me of New York, though it isn't the classic Brooklyn thin slice, but the dough is flavored (unlike several other places that are highly ranked in SF), and you can actually taste the tomatoes in the sauce. The slices are huge, but it's because you're paying over $25 for a large pizza. I recommend the Veggie (made with real vegetables), Rotten Robby, or Dimitri. All of them will fill you up without making you feel like a heavy, carb and salt-filled sack. Solid pizza.", "author": "Danny C."}

While i loved the super-finely minced garlic of the Dimitri, it was a little too oily for me.  The Sunset Aloha was like the traditional Hawaiian pizza but with a twist.  It was slightly spicy & the feta made it extra cheese'y.

They were not greasy, but moist and tender inside, skins and all. Very nice.\n\nThen the vaunted wilted spinach salad was indeed excellent and plenty enough to share a an appetizer.\n\nGood thing too because the pizza took it's sweet time walking over from Naples italy to get to us. It took an easy1/2 hour to get a medium (14\") pie served to us and yet we saw plenty of large (20\") pies getting put in take-out boxes at a much higher speed. This tells me that they prioritize their take out orders over their internal patrons.\n\nWe ordered a 14\" medium pie 1/2 & 1/2 Dimitri and Greek. Both failed to impress. The Dimitri for its sausage, mushroom, cheese and musty old-tasting garlic, and lack of seasonings (tasted much better with the oregano and parmesan cheese at the table). The Greek, for all it's fresh toppings, was again under flavored, but at least it's crust stayed crisper than the other 1/2.\n\nThe atmosphere was really nice the waiter was pleasant but the water served was plain tap water at room temperature (no ice) and the cost per person with the two appy's (with tip) came to about $15. \n\nI would be interested to see how their spaghetti and meatballs are or their pork-loin dinners are for $13 each so I am withholding further judgement until we return.   \n\nBut to serve old garlic on pizza?

I'm gluten, egg, and dairy intolerant, so when I saw all the little \"GF\" symbols on their menu I was stoked! A gluten free friendly pizza place! I was so wrong though. I've read some of the reviews about their gluten free pizza on here, and I don't understand how people enjoy it. Maybe the kitchen was having a bad day when I went? But that's no excuse for the tiny overpriced rock hard \"pizza\" I received. It's +$6 to make any 14\" pizza gluten free, which I was okay with, because I was stoked to eat pizza. My friend ordered a regular 14\" and I got the gluten free 14\". When our food arrived, his pizza was going over the edge of the tray, I would say he received a 15\" pizza, and my gluten free pizza was a good 2 inches smaller, nestled well within the border of the tray. So, when I pay an extra $6, I expect to at least get the same amount of food as the non-gluten free. \n\nOkay, so past the size rip off, the pizza was rock hard, a little burnt and extremely dense. My friend could hear me crunching away at it from across the table, trying to break off pieces with my back teeth. And when I hit it on my plate it made a solid \"tink.\" Also, I ordered the vegan pizza, because I'm lactose intolerant, and I thought it had vegan cheese on it, which it didn't, but that was me being assumptive, and that's not the restaurant's problem. (But how great would it be it they had vegan cheese?!) Anyway, so I got a rock hard pizza with pesto, roasted potatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, mini tomatoes, and caramelized onions on top. The potatoes were burnt, some black, and extremely crunchy, I ended up picking most of them off. \n\nOverall, it was a terrible experience. I'm a college student, and was excited to splurge on a delicious gluten free pizza, and ended up paying $22 for the worst pizza I've ever had.", "author": "Elizabeth R."}

The Pizza Place offers great, interesting food that offers a lot of bang for your buck. \n\nIf you're on the hungrier side, I suggest getting a side of sweet potato steak fries. It comes with a side of buffalo sauce, celery, carrots, and ranch--like a guiltless buffalo wing platter. The fries are done perfectly, and the buffalo flavor makes a surprisingly awesome complement.\n\nI was here with my mom, who is restricted to a gluten-free diet. Luckily, they can make any of their pizzas using gluten-free crust! It didn't taste any different than a regular one would. We got our pizza with roasted garlic and mushrooms...always a good decision. I've also tried Timmy's Pie, which was a little weird, but a nice option if you have a vegan friend. They should really put some Daiya on that thing. \n\nGood news! If you're hankering for pizza but don't feel like committing to an entire pie, they offer single slices starting from $3!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-05", "description": "Last weekend a few of us headed over here for a political event - a casual meet and greet with a mayoral candidate.  They did a good job of providing a dedicated space for the event (the side/back room area), and I heard positive things from those who were drinking that night (I had to spare my liver, unfortunately).\n\nAs I'm about to review a pizza, please keep in mind that I grew up in New York and lived in Chicago for a decade - I know good pizza when it hits my mouth (and I'm not afraid to scream it from the rooftops and direct people to the places that make my metaphorical tail wag, like Patxi's).\n\nWe ordered the Rotten Robby, which really sounded good at the time, but I think we've been spoiled by Eagle's similar specialty.  This was one of those \"almost\" moments, where just a little more attention to detail could have made for a really decent pizza.\n\nThe problem, you ask?  Well, it was twofold.  The pizza's style was sort of a cross between New York hand-tossed and Chicago thin crust, but was a flawed execution of either.\n\nIf the slices had been broader (8 slices on the large instead of 16) and the edge of the crust thicker, this would have been a really good facsimile of a nice, folding New York slice.  If, instead, the pizza had a slightly thicker crust and toppings and cheese out to the edge, with a layer of cheese over the toppings, and had been cut into handy squares, it would have been a stable platform for eating, like a Chicago thin crust.\n\nSadly, what happened was a skinny, floppy wedge without a good handle to control it.  Add that to a really noisy environment (due to the really high ceilings and nothing to absorb noise, we had to yell to carry on a conversation), and I really have trouble giving this more than 2 stars.  Perhaps a future experience (with a taste of something else off the menu) will make me feel more confident of a 3 star rating, but for now, you get 2.5 (3 because yelp won't do half stars and the pizza tasted okay) and I'll stick to the places that have wowed us with their pizza instead.\n\nSUMMARY:  Local hangout with decent, but messy and floppy pizza and an excessively loud environment.  Go for the local hangout factor, but don't expect to follow the conversation.", "author": "Jon M."}

I only found out about this place when we randomly drove by it one day on our way to Irving.  The bright paintings all over the outer walls caught our attention and I made note to check this place out.\n\nWe order two pizzas to go to eat at home while watching game 5 of the Lakers - Orlando championship series.  We ordered 1 Mushroom and Sausage and 1 \"Timmy's Pie\" (Vegan pesto, roasted potatoes, roasted red bell peppers, mushrooms, mini tomatoes, and caramelized onions).  Before we were even able to eat I had kind of a sour impression of the place.  They were pretty rude to me on the phone, and when my GF went to pick the pizza up, she reiterated the same treatment.  She said the guy wouldn't even look at her, handed her the check without saying anything and then shoved the boxes at her.  Well that sucks!\n\nApart from the unfortunate service, the pizza tasted pretty good.  I always appreciate really thin crusts and The Pizza Place was no exception.  In fact, the crust was delightfully crisp and crunchy.  They don't skimp on ingredients either; they'll load your pie up for you.  Out of the two, I enjoyed the Sausage and Mushroom one a little better because it had tomato sauce.  The vegan Timmy's Pie was more for the GF, although it didn't taste too bad.  I suggest eating as much as you can the first night, because their pizza's aren't very good as leftovers.  After one day, the crust was already overly soggy (probably because of the ingredient abundance) and it was molding after 2 days (I even kept it in the refridgerator!)\n\nI'll most likely check out The Pizza Place again but only because it is conveniently close to my house and a better option than dominos or pizza hut.   A couple of their other menu pizzas looked enticing.  However, if I'm not feeling lazy, I'll make the trip to Georgio's or Little Star instead.", "author": "Timothy C."}

Passing by, you would never think that it's a pizza joint.  Inside you will see surfer dudes and dudettes, families, and servers that look like they can tell you when to use a long or short board.  I liked the decor of the place, as it can only fit for a place by the beach.  But it was so loud that I couldn't hear much of what my friend was saying, even when I had to turn my good ear trying to hear what she had to say.  For those that don't know, I blew my right ear out at a shooting range years ago.\n\nI must confess that I am not a big fan of sweet potato, as a potato to me, shouldn't be \"sweet\", but salty.  But these sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had!  Served with buffalo sauce, ranch maybe, and carrot and onion sticks.  I thought I was going to get all the celery, since my friend doesn't care for that vegetable.  But there she was, chomping on the green stick comprised mostly of water.  I much preferred the buffalo sauce, as that's how I roll.\n\nI know that Iceberg Lettuce is an abomination, but it was a HOT day, even at the coast, and it just seemed like the thing to do.  I am sure the lettuce was packaged, as it had all the necessary stuff ... shredded carrots and sliced radish.  The blue cheese dressing and walnuts made the salad come together.  Suck up your hatred and order it.\n\nWe had the Besto Pizza which had Pesto, Feta and Potato slices.  Maybe it had garlic, but I couldn't taste it.  It was very good, but VERY greasy.  I'm not sure where it came from, but I assume it was the pesto.  In looking around, I didn't see that much oil on other pizzas, like cheese, or other combinations.  I'd like to go back and try others.  The Spicoli \"with double cheese and sausage\" sounds too good to pass up.\n\nSeeing some children brought back memories.  Several of them were very blond, as I was when I was very young.

It takes about 25-30 mins for it to come out so be patient or show up knowing that's the deal when you order pizza. The taste and ingredients aren't an issue, it's tasty stuff and ingredients are fresh. The issue is that on our pizza they put all the toppings right in the middle and barely distributed it to the outer portions of the pie before the crust. I realize it's not going to be completely covered but come on it was pretty much half a cheese pizza. They probably skimped us on toppings and tried to play it off but I see through your smoke and mirrors. The crust was thin, as in paper thin to the point where the toppins which were grouped in the middle of the pie which equals more at the tips of the slices made it impossible to eat with your hands. The crust is a handy holder but you couldn't even fold it in half it was so flimsy. So I had to take a fork and knife to it, this isn't deep dish guys let's get it together. So maybe it's different for the most part but we felt skimped on toppings and maybe even dough for the pizza crust.

The first time was good. The waitress was friendly and the pizza was good therefore we wanted to make this place our go to place for pizza cravings.\n\n Before our second trip we saw online that they have a back patio which we thought was great because we have a new puppy and we wanted to bring the dog along. Every restaurant and bar in the city that has a patio or outdoors is dog friendly therefore we did not think there would be an issue. When we arrived at the restaurant the lady behind the bar asked us if the dog was a service dog. We said no because our dog is a puppy and obviously not a service dog.  The woman was rude and then proceeded to scold us and tell us how dogs are not allowed in the patio or restaurant. We were surprised as to how abrupt and rude she was but we understood her concern so we exited the door. What bothered me the most was that she proceed to complain and talk smack about us as we left. She told another customer that we could have lied and said it was a service dog. My boy friend was very upset and told her we did not want to lie when it was obvious that the dog was not a service dog. I am giving the restaurant a poor review because the brunette woman with glasses was rude and should be reprimanded for how she treats her customers. I will never go to this restaurant again.", "author": "Michelle L."}

I'd walk to three blocks to have a slice and a few beers close to once a week when I did.\n\nAnywho, the pizza is delicious. Though I only ever ordered the Spicoli, pepperoni or margherita, it was always wolfed down. Though it tended to be too oily, it always come out piping hot. The only problem I ever saw, but never had, was that other items on the pizza menu came with TOO MUCH of the toppings requested - which is better than too little. \n\nWhen it gets busy the service can be a little suspect, but that just reflects the relaxed nature of the staff and the environment of the place in general, which I love. The people that run the place are surfers; the restaurant is subsequently run at the general pace of the stereotypical surfer's. The ingredients for the salads and sandwiches seemed to be top notch to me as well; they seemed like they would be the expensive ones I would always avoid at a Whole Foods.

It has roughly the same ingredients as Gaspare's Bruce's Special and is a very close second. Mushrooms, salami, pepperoni, sausage and garlic with a red sauce. (They do not mince the salami, no surprise, and they don't \"drain the pizza.\" -Which is curious because the gluten in the crust is perfectly developed and they have wonderful toppings. The result resembles a New York thin crust that is a tiny bit soggy in the middle and begs for a knife and fork to be necessary if you are not a pie-folder. The pie is really particularly delicious and really a four and a half -would be a five if they drained it Pizza-Pie. Last night we got some fries while we waited and when I asked for a side of ranch they gave me a really impressive house-buttermilk dressing that tasted like it had mild peppers and parsley added to it, was very fresh and inspired. After ordering Fries we ordered a Spiccoli (Double cheese and sausage.) The Sausage was okay but really didn't stand up to the extra cheese and we wished that we had ordered the Dimitri a second time. It was still a four star Pizza, but nowhere close to five. Last time we came in we had a couple of meatballs while we waited. Why did I have to order this off menu? They were delicious and inexpensive. They are killing me with the Italian Grinders. I want one. Plan to try one soon. I don't know if they serve them for dinner but they look like traditional East Coast Italian and great! Four and a half stars for excellent service, good to great food and ample parking most nights in adjacent street parking.\nI would like to see spumoni, zabaglione, cannoli and rum cake or tiramisu added to the menu?

Well this fat old man never found that to be an issue. Sure, at times, the service is not super prompt, but then when was the last time you were at flour + water?\n\nThe pizza itself is as good as it gets. Everyone has different ideas of what a good pizza is. Okay, I was born and raised in Rhode Island, grew up with pizza from Federal Hill, my favorite was Iavazzo's where they fired baked the pizza and there were murals of the Bay on Naples.\n\nNow, Pizza on Noriega ain't that, but it is great pizza anyway. Why? Because the crust is thin and tasty. The sauce is just right and when there is garlic is not overdone. The toppings are generous without being overwhelming.  I have been there maybe 15-20 times and picked up maybe about 5-10. Never had a bad pizza.\n\nEach time I bring someone new there, they fall in love with the pizza.\n\nNeedless to say, when I read the bad reviews--crust overcooked, toppings falling off, etc, etc, I wonder if we are talking about the same place. I have to assume that the negative writiers don't have a vested interest in another pizza joint. But I have read some of those reviewers' reviews of other places and I can see why we disagree. We just don't like the same style of pizza.\n\nI was not raised on a chain pizza pizza nor did my mom ever have frozen pizza at home. I expect pizza to be freshly made and with a bit of character, not some consistent production line thing. I never heard my parents complain about the waiters being unfriendly, because I don't think that they ever expected them to be friendly. Let's face it, this is a pizza joint. Sorry folks, one goes there for the pizza.\n\nOh yeah, I have been places where being ignored is frustrating. Gosh, how many times have I stood forlornly at a bar or counter while the world made several revolutions and no one noticed me. Well, sometimes that is the way it is.  But I also realize that ya gotta speak up for yourself also. See back home, either you are related to someone or you got a big mouth. The meek little mousies just get ignored.

Rolls are imported from Philly and the selection of fillings are endless; kudos for the fried veggie \"chicken\" pattie sub.\nMany props to vegetarians can be found here. Vegan pizza, sweet potato fries in buffalo sauce, grilled caulflower salad plus many more. Each one better than the other. \nThe vibe: Its 2 blocks from the beach, need I say more? Don't expect ass-kissin customer service cause you won't get it; but then again, you probably done deserve it anyway. This place is run by and meant for the Ocean Beach neighbors, not a fan of the neighborhood? Maybe North Beach Pizza is more your style. We love it & will continue to support it.\n\nBTW, the back deck is now open (as 7X7 magazine calls it, Zeitgiest West) and the sun is shining! Rawk on guys (and Cindy too!)!", "author": "David W."}

I do enjoy the mystical pizzas and flying beer mugs surrounding said mural to make it somewhat pizza-relevant.\n\nTheir pizza is delicious.  Let's start with appetizers: sweet potato steak fries = yum.  Nice and big with two yummy sauces, one spicy, one cheesy.  The roasted cauliflower was also tasty - way to make cauliflower not boring.  Said my friend \"i never buy cauliflower because it seems boring but now I know what to do with it\".  Also, olives were yummy and flavorful.  I had a cherry italian soda, which was refreshingly sweet and bubbly.  We ordered the besto pesto which was slightly greasy (in a good way) and oh so cheesy.  We also had the greek which was flavorful and packed a punch.  \n\nIf you like thin crust this is the place for you.  The place could use a little more art on their walls - plenty of room for some local artists or a mural.

The pizza is delicious.  It's not fair to compare it to a place like Pizzeria Delfina, that's not the point of The Pizza Place on Noriega, but it's definitely worth seeking out on its own.  For what it's worth, I think Pizza Place on Noriega's pizza is way better than Farina in the Mission.\n\nThe crust is on the thin side: not cracker thin, but nor is it thick and pillow-y. The toppings and flavors are fresh, uncomplicated, and appealing. I love the Sliced Meatball, the Rotten Robbie, and my husband is all about the Veggie and the Timmy's Pie.  My daughters like the Cheese and the Sliced Meatball.\n\nMy only complaint is that the pastas are a bit weak.  I've only had the Spaghetti w/Meatballs & Red Sauce.  The pasta was cooked past \"al dente\" and I could tell the noodles hadn't drained sufficiently because the marinara sauce (which was on the bland side), was water-y.

But the 3 star rating isn't for what they don't have...\n\nThe pizzas that I've had here have been okay. I find them to be a little too greasy for my taste. Once we ordered (I forget which one) a pizza for pick-up and when we got home, it was the wrong order. Eh, that's okay because it looked really good. So we tried it... and yeah, it was greasy and the middle was soggy.\n\nAbout a month ago, we were in the mood for pizza and decided to give this place a second chance. We got the Rotten Bobby which has jalepenos and pesto on it which is what enticed us to order it - sounded really good! But I found the pizza this time to be a little too salty for my taste (may have been the pesto), and again greasy... and even though we ate there, the middle was soggy too. The real kicker was the spicy jalepenos! If you want something that will fire up your tastebuds, this is the pizza for you!\n\nSo... 0 for 2. Maybe I got the wrong kinds of pizzas?

The service is also friendly as hell, but I do have one issue with the place that's forced me down to 4 stars from 5 stars.\n\nWhat the fuck is up with not serving grinders after 4.30pm?  I mean, who the fuck does that kinda shit?  Either you serve something, or you don't.  This isn't Gary Dankos--No seasonal or time based menu here sweetie.  \n\nThink of us as fish.  You create this amazing bait, aka Grinders, which are fucking amazing by the way, to catch us in the day.  So we stumble down from our apartment, usually really fucking high and/or drunk, during the day to enjoy a few pitchers, some pie, and of course your grinders.  \n\nThen nightfall creeps its way into the lower sunset, and we start hitting bong's and tall can's like it's goin out of style.  Suddenly, someone suggests a grinder.  Fucking great, I want 3, and \"NO\" none of you fat fuckers who call themselves my friends can't have any of mines, so get your own.  Sure enough, we make our way down there, and we ask for our grinders.  \n\n\"We don't serve them after 4.30p, it's on the menu.  Everyone misses that\".....\n\nUhhhhhhhhhhmmmm......ooooooooookkkkkkaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy....... interesting business strategy.  \"Everyone\" misses that because they want their god damn grinders after 4.30pm.  \n\nSo we sit down for a beer and ask, \n\n\"Why don't you sell grinders at night\", as we settle for a slice.  Pssh...whatever.  I really wanted to ask, \"What the fuck is your problem?  People love your shit, so give it to 'em!  Not only that, but they'll pay you for it!  Shit, raise the price if  you must!\"  But I didn't......inside voice..inside voice....    \n\n\"We're just too busy and can't make them during the night\".  \n\nSo being that I'm in the restaurant business I see that their pizza toppings cross utilize every product that the sandwiches use in the exception of the amoroso rolls (which are great!), meatballs, turkey, and condiments.  Every other ingredient is used on the pizza!  \n\nSo here's the deal, I suggest a bain-marie (spelling?) for the meatballs.  Surely you could squeeze the turkey and condiments into a cooler or an ice bath and of course a small shelf to house the bread.  Then again, I hate when people tell me how to run my business, and here I am doing the same thing.  I guess what I really want to say is: \" Your grinders are fucking delicious and many of us probably won't frequent at night without those addicting little fuckers.  Your pie is great, don't get me wrong.  But those little grinders are a magical world for a bunch of high and drunken heathens or other fogheads who're just in the mood for something different than pizza in the LSD.     \n\nPlease stop fucking with your heads and stomachs and bring back your grinders at night!  The balance of the universe as well as the lower sunset district depends on this!\n\nDon't leave us waiting.....", "author": "Willie W."}

I can not understand who is getting a soggy pizza...?  If anything, I might complain that the edges of the crust are too hard, but the bottom is always beautifully, evenly browned.  We usually get a coppacola pizza.\n\nThe \"Timmy's,\" a vegan pizza that is actually worth eating, has pesto which sinks down into the crust, making it delightfully crispy in places.  The thinly-sliced potato makes up for the lack of cheese, by adding a nice chewy toothiness.  Thank you for having vegan options!  We love our vegans, and we love to eat with them!  I pretend it's for them that I order the roasted cauliflower with orange segments and chopped olives, but it's really for me.  'Cause it's GOOD!  And, I think I like the sweet potato fries even better than I like the wings!\n\nLOVE the fresh salads.  Usually pizza-place salads are sucky -- often they are gross and downright slimy.  Not here!  The \"wedge\" is not very wedge-shaped, but does hit all the high points of the wedge salad concept.  Chunky iceberg and blue cheese dressing with super-thinly sliced radish, onion, shredded carrot and toasted walnuts.  The waitress asked if we wanted bacon on it last time, and I said no, in honor of my husband, but I really meant YES!  YES bacon!  However, the walnuts added the right note of toasty richness, so the bacon was not missed.\n\nRecently, we have come to know the greatness of their sandwiches.  Served 12-4:30, they are VERY GOOD.  I get turkey-bacon-cheddar, husband gets the Italian.  They come with great fixins on fresh, good rolls.

But apparently those Sunset folks aren't kidding when they say that this is the only good pizza place out here, because it was packed (admittedly, it was a Friday).  It seems like they're still figuring out crowd control here, because there was no obvious sign about seating and they twice tried to seat us at spaces that turned out to be taken (cuz around here you can hold a table with a jacket or a beer).  All in all, it felt much more like the dinner rush at a ski village pizza-pub than San Francisco, but of course that's part of the charm.  In fact, it reminds me a lot of the Riptide scene -- definitely a worthy post-dinner stop if you're out this way.\n\nBut the important thing is, how's the pizza?  I'm happy to say that it's wicked good.  We tried the hawaiian, which is gourmet'd up with feta and coppacola ham.  It was piping hot and very dense, so a 14\" is plenty to satiate 2 people.  Plus (and this is always a plus) a new type of beer!  Eel River Organic Amber Ale, from that magical happy land we call the North Coast.  And in spite of the wait (both for tables and food), the service is still nice and attentive, and you'll feel like a local even if you're from way back east (like, you know, twin peaks).\n\nOne thing though - why don't they have a sign?", "author": "Wes M."}

The Rotten Robby was my favorite. \n\nIf you have a large group of people (8+), you might want to call in advance and see if they have seating. If all the group tables are taken, they aren't too flexible about combining tables together because they would like to cater to smaller parties too. But if you have a party of 2-6, this place is perfect. \n\nI am an impatient guy, and I think next time I have a pizza craving, I would just order in advance and get the pizza to go.

The place was packed with surfers and students. They had just closed, but the waitress was friendly and kind.

Both add to the casual atmosphere. \nThe one thing I would change is something that distracted me all night... the artwork and frames on the wall were placed far too high.  I *know* it's a random observation for a pizza place but I noticed it and it left me disconcerted.  All dinner long it was like we were waiting for a tribe of extremely tall people to enter and use the space as a gallery. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was pretty edible.  The pizza had a much more Italian flair than you normally find in SF.  Now, I like the American-style pizza selection in SF a lot... but every once in a while it's nice to have the fresher, lighter flavor of the kind of pizza that Noriega offers.  The chunk of iceberg lettuce salad was fun too.  I'm no huge fan of iceberg but it was a fun and whimsical change.\n\nThe crowd was fun but loud and the lighting, instead of feeling like \"we're trying to set a mood here\" felt somewhat like someone forgot to turn on all the lights.

Later as it grew more popular, we came to have their chicken wings which were amazing, but better with ranch dressing (by the way). However, the price...well it's not as friendly to those of us with wallets of the same size. \n\nLater on, when my aunt treated us out to dinner there, I was not comfortable with the ambiance of the whole place. It was crowded, smelly, and very noisy, but at least the waiter was very friendly. Now to the Pizza. I have had the best pizza slices on 19th and Taraval, even though it's not a sit down eatery like the Pizza Place. The pizza is oily, very greasy but the Rotten Robbie and hawaiian style one is pretty good.. I definitely would not recommend anyone going to the Pizza Place if they want fabulous pizza.\n\nHowever, one good thing about the place besides the staff is that they are (if they haven't already) expanding a little which might clear up the congestion and their salads are still very delicious.

I found some pizza here that's pretty good, decent, or tastes great but that's only because it's 2am and I've been drinking heavily, in which ALL pizza tastes good.  \n\n2) Pizza and beer joints are hard to come by.  Sure, there are places that you can get some weird fancy pizza and a nice pint.. but I'm talking about a REAL pizza joint.. sit down with a bunch of buds, order a pitcher and a hot pie.. relaxed atmosphere and good tunes are also a plus!\n\nEnter.. Pizza Place on Noriega!\n\nI really like this place.  Ok, the pizza isn't the best I've ever had in my life.. but it's pretty darn good.  There's a decent beer selection too.. and if you're on a budget, the PRB pitchers are pretty cheap.\n\nThe location is great too!  The sunset is in need of more action, in my opinion.  I certainly don't loathe the neighborhood in the way that some do.. (after all, it's the BEACH), but I certainly think that the neighborhood has some fun spots, as well as lots of potential.  Pizza Place on Noriega is a perfect fit.\n\nEven if you don't live in the Sunset, you should take a trip to the beach and hit up Pizza Place for some beers and pizza on your way out.. trust me, you'll likey!\n\nSide note:  Apparently they were petitioning to stay open until 2am, and it's passed.

Had it been dine-in maybe we'd be talking about 4 Star pizzeria, but....\n\nThe Pizza Place makes a big ass pizza!!! I ordered a large thinking it was enough to suit my girl and I with the hopes of having a few slices leftover for the midnight munchies, but it turned out we had more than enough to send hose poor kids on American Idol a sample. Turned out though we didn't need to pay for shipping as the pizza wasn't too much to our liking and didn't want to make children on the brink of collapse suffer anymore. I'll give \"The Pizza Place\" \"The Benefit of the Doubt\" though as maybe the pie just wasn't our style. The pineapple and sausage pizza was less about the toppings than it was about the cheese and the sauce, maybe because of the size, making it hard to enjoy the flavor combos we were looking for. I know some places concentrate solely on toppings to hide subpar crusts, but hey, I ordered topping because I like them!\n\nAlong with this monster circle we had an order of sweet potato fries and a mixed greens salad. The fries were good as they weren't skinny like others places' and were paired with hot sauce and bleu cheese dressing making for an interesting flavor trifecta. They were also made fresh while I was waiting for the order to be completed which was a nice touch. The salad was a salad. Not too much to report there. \n\nThe Pizza Place probably deserves more stars, but again it might just be one of those places you have to dine in.

The atmosphere is welcoming and casual in that beach lover/ surfer way.  The large windows make the place really bright even on our often foggy days.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was filled with families which warmed my heart ... I'd call it family friendly.  I imagine it's also a cool place to hang out in the evening with a slightly different crowd.  \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient.  Not a lot of chit chat but I think that will come with more visits.  The music playing was Elvis Costello ...not too loud and very cool for a Saturday afternoon.  \n\nFinally .. the food..  Yum yum!  In old style pizza tradition, we ordered the iceberg salad for 1 -2 people.  Definitely enough for 2.  Crispy fresh lettuce, delicious blue cheese dressing and we had the bacon sprinkled on top which was perfectly crispy and divine.  \n\nI couldn't go without ordering the sweet potato fries and I'm glad we did.  The sauces are awesome, one super spicy deliciousness and the other a cool creamy pot of heaven.  The fries themselves are soft and velvety when you bite into them.  I immediately thought this is my new comfort food.  We paced ourselves with the fries and just ate one fry each ... maybe two fries : )  \n\nWe ordered the Rotten Robby: sausage, mushrooms, pesto, jalape\u00f1o, tomato sauce & cheese. I loved that it arrived a few minutes after we were done with our salad.  It was delicious.  The sauce is delicate and super fresh tasting.  I'm not a sausage fan at all but I will say I was pleased with this sausage.  It wasn't on the pie in big chunks which freaks me out.  It was small crumbles sprinkled liberally but balanced well with the other toppings so no one topping over powered the other.  \n\nSo ... run don't walk!

The brightly lit pizza place sits on a corner and was bustling with lots of families, couples on dates and large groups of people throwing back pitchers of PBR. \n\nOur group ordered a variety of starters that included an amazing wilted spinach salad that was chock full of dried cranberries, feta and almonds, sweet potato steak fries that were delicately fried and a roasted cauliflower dish that had a spicy bite to it. \n\nWe were warned that the large sized pizza would feed most of us in our group, but we decided to ignore the warning and went with a large Meat Head (every type of meat imaginable) and Veggie. \n\nThe flavor combinations of the Spicoli, Rotten Robby and Besto all sounded good too, but alas, those had to wait for another visit. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. The large pizza, which is larger than any other large I've seen, runs between $21 and $25. \n\nIf you're a San Franciscan who thinks the Sunset is like going to outer Siberia; trust me, The Pizza Place on Noriega is worth the trip.", "author": "Lee H."}

Cleaner and newer than Naan N' Curry but for some reason, reminded me of it.  Maybe it's the giant space and the two sectioned-off rooms, and the comfort factor both shares.

You cannot go there when your stomach is growling.  On the menu it tells you it takes about 20-25 minutes to make the pizza, so unless you have some sweet potato fries (should've ordered that!) to munch on, you will seriously be staring at the giant car on the wall with the pizza wheels spinning over and over again like a couple of clocks going nowhere. \n\nMy husband and I shared a medium Sunset Aloha. It's got feta, copparella, pineapples.  Pizza came in 8 slices, thin crust, and the flavor is pretty strong.

I'm definitely no pizza connoisseur but I've had my fair share of pizza at various locations throughout the world and even in this city...\n\nFirst, the things I liked:  This place was clean, a big improvement from the previous business.  They also had beer and wings, both of which go quite nice with a pizza.  And for those who need their salad fix, they had a few salads that looked pretty good.\n\nThen, the things I didn't like:  The fact that no one really knew where my food was.  I ordered the dimitiri pizza and wings at the bar and waited for like 45 minutes to finally get my order.  In between that time, a few folks managed to pick up their orders and leave without any hassles.  I even saw one pizza made and put on top of the oven.  After 40 minutes, I asked for my wings and was given those.  Another 5 minutes later, someone finally realized that the pizza on top of the oven was mine.  Needless to say, by the time I got home (just down the road) my pizza and wings were cold.  Therefore I'm not sure whether I had a typical PPON meal.\n\nAs for the food, I'll try my best to rate the cold food.  The wings were friend and then served with hot sauce and blue cheese on the side.  I liked the crunchy hot wings but I feel that they would have been better if the wings were mixed with the sauce rather than put on the side.  They were definitely generous with the sauce and blue cheese, though.  However, the pizza was so-so.  The crust on this pizza was soggy (perhaps it's because my pizza was sitting there for about 1/2 hour).  Also, this pizza was a bit salty but I don't know whether that's from the meats or something else. \n\nOverall I'd rate this food average (mostly it's the wings that are the saving grace) but the customer service sucked.

The pizza was okay, seemed really oily and greasy to me, but I had a large sized pizza with some friends and the size was HUGE! I still enjoyed it because it was thin and crunchy. The prices were fair. Now as for the service: my first server seemed like she hated her job and was dying to get out of there since we had another server come in after a few minutes.

I already had my suspicions about this place from the outside. It looked closed. Actually, it didn't look just closed, it looked shutdown. I arrived late so my table already had an order of what looked like the Meat Head. One bite had my cringing over how salty it was. I managed to finish it with plenty of soda and water to wash out the burning salt taste. Next we ordered the Sunset Aloha, which appeared to be a Hawaiian pizza. Maybe this will be less salty because there's pineapple I thought. Wrong. It was just as salty as the previous meat-filled slice. I realized I wasn't the only one who thought this was too salty. We agreed that it had to be in the tomato sauce. I love pizza, but I really hate pizza done wrong. I will agree that their sizes are pretty large.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-06", "description": "Let me admit first that I'm a serious NY pizza snob, so keep that bias in mind while you read this.  The pizza here is so good it deserves criticism, which is far more than I can say of most places in SF.  Let's start with the crust, the heart of any pizza:  Your first tip-off is the warning in the menu that pizzas take 30 minutes to arrive.  A properly-baked pizza should simply NEVER be baked for that long, period.  As a result, the outer crust was far too dry and far too hard -- most likely caused by inadequate dough moisture combined with too low a baking temperature.  While I'm sure the bottom crust was great when it came out of the oven, within moments after slicing it, the excess moisture from the toppings (we had mushrooms, always problematic) had combined with orange-colored cheese oil, and had run between the slices and completely soaked the bottom of the pie.  The bottom crust on the first slice was so-so, and after that, the crust on the rest of the slices was pretty much ruined.  Many other pizzerias easily solve this problem by serving the pie on a round mesh screen, and by squeezing some of the moisture out of the mushrooms before baking the pizza - it's so easy to do and costs almost nothing.  I found the cheese a bit rubbery, but that's minor compared to problems with the crust.  Not including the crust, the flavor of our pizza was really very good.\n\nI liked the atmosphere:  You got your blue 80s-era full-size Oldsmobile side clip mounted on the back wall, with the obligatory motorized pepperoni pizzas for wheels (no longer spinning, unfortunately).  You got $3 pints of pretty okay cold draft beer.  You got the sports bar in one room and the dining area in another.  The jaunty blond surfer-type waiter was seriously nice to us.  And the prices, while not the lowest (nor should they be), were very fair.\n\nSo look, owners of the Pizza Place, go make yourself a nice mushroom pizza, sit down, and PAY ATTENTION while you eat it.  Honestly now, what's your opinion?  Mine?  You would do well to experiment with higher dough moisture, higher baking temperatures, shorter baking times, and drier toppings (when necessary).  Buy a dozen mesh serving screens.  Then watch your business and your reputation grow even more.  You deserve it.", "author": "Richard A."}

We asked for waters and our server just pointed to a water station behind us.  However, we see the tables next to us had pitchers of ice water.  One of my friends orders a glass of wine and somehow it comes in a whisky glass (real classy).  Our server then disappears for twenty minutes while we're ready to order.  We decided to order a pizza.  Our server then disappears again.  After 30 minutes, we track our waitress down to check on the food.  She says that the pizza oven is being so tonight and there is nothing she can do.  Never doesn't ask us if there's anything else she can get us or we needed our drinks refilled.

And please, don't say Amici's! Amici's is, was, and will always be, overpriced crap. Amici's became popular because of the Chestnut Street location that was frequented by rich people who don't know the first thing about value. They just feel important and entitled to opinion because they are, well, rich people. \nBut back to The Pizza Place. I love this place. The pizzas are enormous and soooooooo tasty! Sure it's greasy, it's pizza! If you are so concerned about a greasy piece of food, stay home and make something yourself. The chicken wings are amazing, and the grinders are the best thing to fill that hole in your stomach on a Saturday afternoon. I've been taking my family to this place since day one. \n\nHOWEVER, I have to say the scruffy surfer dude that waited on us a few weeks ago was a complete and total d-bag! Homeboy got all pissed off when we asked to sit at a table and have beers while we ordered food to go. He literally dropped the menus from about 5 feet off the table and they came down and made a loud THWAP! noise that startled both my wife and kids. When we ordered (2 slices, a salad and 12 wings to go) he repeated our order out loud and said \"That's all you want?\" Is there a quota Spicoli? And finally when my 5 year old daughter went to hand this guy our bill and credit card he nearly knocked her on the ground and never even noticed, and or completely ignored her because he was having a frat boy moment with his buddies who were getting all of his attention the whole time we were there. DUDE, customers should be treated equally. It's not a hangout it's your job, and the customer is always right even if they only want a table to have pint while they order food to go. \nBy the way, there were at least 7 empty tables in the place that night so it's not like we were impeding on anyone or anything. \nOther than that, I love this place!!!!!

Now my friends and I came here for a b-day dinner celebration and we were promptly seated immediately which was nice. After we ordered some appetizers, and beer we finally got down to eating some of their NY style pizza. Even though I am not from the East Coast, I had some high expectations due to the fact that I had real authentic NY style pizza in the Big Apple twice in the past half year. For the most part the night went smooth and our sweet potato fries was quite interesting to say the least. They were somewhat soggy when I fully expected them to be more crisp, but their unique buffalo and ranch sauces subdued that fact for the moment. The place itself is decently sized being on the corner of a major street but the one thing I couldn't shake was the price. We ordered one XL pizza and one Large pizza along with the before mention items and our total came out to be just under a hundred dollars. I don't know about most people but this is kinda pricey considering everyone only had a couple slices overall.\n\nWhich brings me to the pizza itself. The all meat pizza and the vegetable pizza I would have to say is only acceptable at best. It's tough cutting through and eating soggy dough along with toppings that seem to just fall apart no matter what you do with it. I didn't find using a knife and fork enjoyable due to the fact that when I tried to pick the pizza up with my hands, everything would fall apart quickly. Now since we were here on someone else' accord I decided not to say anything but rather give an honest opinion of my experience. There are many other great pizza places in the Sunset that you can go to that would be more worth while. If I could give 2 1/2 stars instead I would but I feel that 2 stars is too low. I would want to try this place again to see if my experience has improved but only time will tell if that happens or not...", "author": "Jason Y."}

So in that regard, sure it's really authentic.  Taste wise it reminds me of Stromboli's in NY (they have locations on University, and also 2nd Ave.)  The sauce is sweet, with onions in it.... a small step up from the crap Ray's sells, but not much.\n\nSo don't expect artisan pizza with fresh mozzeralla.  In fact, when I asked if the Margarita for 50 cents extra was the Buffalina stuff, I was told it was just the same old slice but with basil tossed on it.\n\nSo basically, here you have a place you can get a greasy slice in San Francisco, that's not Blondie's (yuck) or Golden Boy (mmm sicilian!) or those places on Haight Street (which are a little more processed then Noriega's pizza, but not much).   Unfortunately, a slice with toppings will run you anywhere from $3.00-$4.50.   Oh, and if you're me, the first bite will burn the roof of your mouth and hurt for days.\n\nIf you live in the Sunset, then it's about as good an option for pizza as any out there....but it's not  a destination place.  Noriega has a little stretch with some creepy surfer types hanging around. It's basically resedential slums that will one day make for a nice neighborhood again...but right now there's nothing there.  I had high hopes this place would help to start bringing other businesses out there, but it's just one more funky place opening without any overhead.  The chairs look like they came from auctioned old dive bar stock...the kitchen itself, which they added is pretty nice (the location used to be a weird deli/liquor store) but there's no ambience here unless you count the Doze Green painting (or is it a knockoff?) on the wall that looks out of place.   \n\nSo in short, I have no idea why this is blurbs in SF publications. There's nothing special about it, and the truth is, San Francisco has much better mediocre pizza for much cheaper.", "author": "BJS .."}

Stopped in and thought it was a pretty cool looking place, surf , alternative vibe, not too fancy but clean. Just the kind of place I want to like!  We sat right under a speaker and the music was cranking out pretty loud and we had to kind of yell to hear each other. So, we moved one table away, which was better. They have an outside patio which looked nice but it was a windy, early spring day, so too cold for that. We were not ready to order when the waiter first stopped by. Then it took forever for him to come back to the table. We craned our necks and I got up a couple times and walked over by the bar so they could see that we needed help, but no help came. Probably 15 minutes went by and I walked up to the bar and told them we were ready to order and had been waiting awhile. So, someone from behind the bar came out and  took our order. Later, our waiter apologized that he had a bunch of root beer floats to make and that is what delayed him.  Then we got the Pizza. The menu notes, something to the effect that, because it is cooked in a brick oven and hand tossed, it takes a minimum of 20-25 minutes to cook, so yeah it did take awhile, no problem for good food right? The Pizza arrived and was pretty big, enough for a not super hungry family of 5, w/ 3 kids, ages 7-13.  But, the Pizza was your standard greasy, gooey doughy type of thing. Nothing special at all, in fact, much lower quality than most of the many pizza restaraunts around S.F. we've been too lately. All 5 of us were in agreement, nothing special at all.

It's a cool place and the people working there were nice and friendly at the lunch hour.\n\nI got the extreme meaty pizza (whatever it was called) which I really liked.  It had like 5 different types of meat and a lot of them piled high. The thing is, when I got to the crust it tasted like standard crust and I realized that they pile on toppings and whatnot and cover up the taste of the crust.\n\nThis was confirmed when my girlfriend ate there. She got cheese and broccoli and disliked it because the cheese and crust were bland. I tried it and I have to agree.\n\nWhen I want pizza, I want pizza and I'm not as concerned with atmosphere, location, or toppings sometimes.  I'd go back and get the meat pizza because it was great and generous for the price, but if I want a plain pizza or something with basic toppings, I'll go somewhere else.", "author": "Greg B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-01", "description": "I was recommended to The Pizza Place by my co-worker and self-proclaimed 'pizza lover', so when she said this place is REALLY good and makes pizza the 'right' way (by using deck ovens, more on this to come) I had to accept her invite to share a pie.\n\nI had to drive by two times before finding TPP, as there is no visible sign (it's on the corner of 46th and Noriega). We walk in and stand in the doorway for about 5 minutes before being greeted (waitress walks past us twice), which we don't mind as we were waiting for the rest of our party. We are finally acknowledged by gentleman behind the counter and he hands us menus and lets us choose our table. We sit down and peruse the menu, the delicious smell of yeasty-dough perfumes the air.\n\nThe menu offers a nice selection of 'specialty' pizzas, all sounding delicious with a nice array of toppings. We decide on the Iceburg Salad (Iceburg, Radish, Onion and Blue Cheese Dressing), Baker's Dozen of Buffalo Wings, Sunset Aloha (their version of a Hawaiian pizza with Capicola instead of Canadian Bacon and addition of feta) and the Dimitri (Sausage, Pepperoni and Garlic). \n\nSalad arrives quickly and is quite good. I'm not a fan of Iceburg, but found the salad crisp and the dressing VERY good. Buffalo wings are equally delicious-- good sauce ratio, not over-saturated, keeping the wings still crispy. \n\nPizzas arrive and are served on risers, putting the pies just about eye-level (I'm 5'4\", so if you are taller, you do the math), which is great because the pizzas look deeeeeeeelicious! I try the Sunset Aloha first and am really enjoying the Capicola, which has turned a little crispy from the wood-burning oven. The sauce is really delicious, not too thick, not too thin, just enough sweetness and acidity, good balance. The cheese is a high-quality cheese and was just hot enough. The crust is really delicious too, well-seasoned and not soggy or too crisp. From what I am told, they use a deck oven which slowly cooks the pizza from the bottom of the oven and as it gets higher and higher, gets hotter and hotter, creating a well-baked, perfectly golden brown and never burnt pizza. I am impressed!\n\nThe Dimitri is tasty as well, and for someone that doesn't care for sausage on pizza, I am really enjoying it. They crumble the sausage, which I believe is a high-quality Italian variety, which is rich in flavor and doesn't compete with the pepperoni. My only qualms with the pizza is that it is a LITTLE on the greasy side.\n\nAs a lover of classic NY pizza, I give this place 4 stars. It's not quite as good as pizza I've had in NYC, but it's delicious nonetheless. I would definitely recommend!", "author": "Status K."}

Understandably it was a busy night, but staff was lost when issues arose for our table and the surrounding tables. Our waiter even mentioned to us how they've been overwhelmed and are still trying to find their groove.\n\nLocation - it's a trek out to the sunset but if you're in the neighborhood it's probably one of the very few restaurants that are decent.

I come and get pizza and beer and sit at their bar staring at the blank white wall.. this is thing #1 they could change. MURALS. They need murals on the inside as well as the outside. That'd be hot. Thing #2... stay open late... LATE. Pizza tastes best when consumed around midnight while shoveling scoops of delicious beer into myself. Don't get me wrong. This place rocks. The people are nice, the Besto pizza is Soooooo good. Especially when it's cooked a lot so the thin potato slices get crispy. That's a little bit of heaven in my mouth. But it'd be better if it were happening at midnight. I just moved here but the ocean neighborhoods seem to be lacking a chill go to place that's open late and has good food and drinks.

It's nice to have the option to wash it all down with beers on tap or some good Italian wine.   My personal favorite is the car on the wall with spinning rims.

I've been here several times, and haven't written a review until now because I just can't believe such a good pizza joint exists in my 'hood. Every time we've been there, whatever combo we have tried was excellent. They really know how to make pizza here and the specials are totally original. If you're a Californian surfer, or if you are just a California style pizza lover, check this place out. You can't go wrong. The crust is not too thick, nor thin, and just crispy enough. The combo specials are original and tasty. And they cook the pizzas to perfection every time. The only dig I'd give this place, and its a minor one, is that they should consider expanding their beer selection. Nothing like pizza and beer, and the choice is somewhat scarce.  I noticed the local surfers like to hang out at the bar. Maybe they should think about giving those dudes more brews to choose from to go with their \"Spicoli\"!", "author": "Rich M."}

My sister said she'd seen this place and wanted to try it, so we went on a Wednesday night. We walked in, asked the waitress if we were to seat ourselves, then sat down after she confirmed. Despite knowing we were there, it took over 10 minutes for her to even get us a menu. After we got the menu, she was prompt in asking if we were ready to order. We wanted a little more time, she came back a few minutes later. Perfect timing. I ordered a slice with potato toppings, a coke, and an order of hot wings. The wait time for the food was reasonable, but the quality was not. The pizza had no sauce whatsoever. It was just crust, cheese, and sliced potatoes on top. It was worse than a Cosco pizza. The wings on the other hand, were delicious. Hot and crispy with hot sauce. They weren't smothered in sauce but there was plenty of sauce on the plate, so you could add more if you prefer. The waitress never came by while we were eating. I realized I was going to finish my coke before my food, so I drank the last 4th of the cup slowly. The waitress didn't even walk near our table, so we couldn't call her and ask for a refill. She eventually came by when we had finished eating. We asked for the bill and it was brought out promptly. I can say with confidence that I won't be going back there again.\n\nThe one plus side seemed to be the atmosphere. The place was lively on a Wednesday night, especially by the bar. I supposed if you are just going to drink, it would be a nice place. I think you'll probably get quicker service at the bar. If you plan to sit down and eat, I can't recommend this place.

My husband and I have been quite a few times and we really do like the food, BUT the attitudes of all of the waitstaff is awful! The server we had this time was good though.....However, The last time I went (a few days ago) was my last time! I took my 16 month old son in to grab a quick dinner and once the bill had arrived, my son was ready to go. After frantically looking for my wallet, I ran out to the car and i couldn't find it there either. I was freaking out at this point.. My husband was at work, my son was ready for bed, and I could not find my wallet. I ended up calling my brother for his credit card number because I didn't know what else to do. I gave it to the server, completely embarrassed by the fact that I had lost my wallet. A few moments later the owner had come over and told he that, \"they don't do business like that\". I was shocked and even more embarrassed. After I told her my story, I told her that I just needed to run around the corner to my house and check for my wallet and that I would be right back. She looked at me as if I was scamming her and said, what are you going to give me for collateral?\" I told her that all I had was a diaper bag with Diapers and wipes. Then she asked me if I had an ID. HELLO!!! I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I CANT FIND MY WALLET, WHICH HAS MY ID IN IT!!! I JOKINGLY said unless you want to hang out with my son. she rolled her eyes and said, ya right and I told her that I was just kidding. when she hesitantly took my cell phone as collateral I hurried home and found my wallet (thank goodness) on the garage floor. I must have dropped it while loading up the car. I went back and paid, and she still wasn't very friendly. I was super apologetic and clearly humiliated and she still gave me nothing, not even a smile.

The staff is very nice, but extremely overworked.  We sat ourselves and waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged.  Luckily, we didn't have anywhere to go afterwards, so we weren't in a hurry.  We ordered the Aloha pizza. The outside crust was thin and crispy, exactly the way my husband loves it, but the rest of it was quite floppy and a bit greasy.  We also had the warm spinach salad which was surprisingly delicious.  Unfortunately, they don't serve milk for children and they have self serve water.  I watched one of the servers replace the water jug and no ice was added to cool it, ending up in lukewarm water for my daughter and me.  Overall, it took about 50 minutes to get the pizza on the table.  I'd say the staff is very nice, but should really learn to greet people as they walk in the door and try to be more attentive (hard to do when the house was full and the waitress is running around trying to make everyone happy).  \n\nI just can't see what the draw of this place is.  It's true that it looks like a surfer hangout, a place for beach dwellers to kick back and hang out at the bar.  When we went all the tables were taken, so I guess that tells you something.

Before our last visit, I would have given it 10 stars but now I will give them 4 and I will tell you why.  We usually order sweet potato fries, salad and margherita pizza.  The margherita pizza is THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE.  The service is usually fantastic.  We have brought many friends and family here and everyone leaves happy.  The last visit was about two weeks ago.  We met a friend and one of her sons.  While we were waiting for them to arrive we decided to place the order as the place was getting very busy.  It was a Monday night around 6 p.m.  We ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 large margherita pizza and 1 med. veggie pizza.  The music was loud, actually it was way too loud.  The customers where yelling at each other to be heard.  I asked the server if it was possible to turn down the music (our friends kid is sometimes sensitive to loud noise).  Her response was \"the volume fluctuates sometimes\" - huh??  Our friends arrived, it was still excruciatingly loud - the fries arrived - yum.  We were all happily munching our fries.  The pizza then arrived.  The margherita was delicious as usual.  But the veggie was disgusting.  It was so overloaded with stuff it was wet and soggy.  Between the 6 us we barely ate two slices.  I told the server it was bad but she just asked it we wanted to take it to go.  We ate the entire margherita pizza and all the fries so none of us left hungry.  I just sort of felt like I had wasted an extra 17 bucks on a pizza we just threw into the trash.  Don't get me wrong, I will go back because the margherita pizza is just to good.  As a matter of fact we are going back in a couple of weeks with some friends we introduced the place to last summer.  We will just have to order a little more wisely.", "author": "Stephanie G."}
