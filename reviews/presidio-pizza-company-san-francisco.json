The first time I passed by this place it was packed with high school students and others. That made Presidio Pizza seem like a very lively spot. I was going to lunch somewhere else but decided to come back the following day. Part of the appeal to me was the \"Fillmore vibe\" of the restaurant's interior design, and its wood-glass-contemporary layout. \n\nI was not so impressed when I came back the next day. The place was emptier, and the pizza was not very flavorful. I ordered two slices - their names which escape me because it wasn't too memorable. Pizza was warmer than lukewarm, but not as hot as I would like. Nothing was strikingly wrong with this place - it was just an overall underwhelming experience. 2/5.", "author": "Chris W."}

While browsing DoorDash, I found Presidio Pizza Company. I placed our dinner delivery order on Sunday, April 15th at 6:40pm. It arrived at 7:22pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Buffalo Chicken Wings, Celery, Carrots & Blue Cheese ($10)\n*Frankie's (Single Slice): Sausage, garlic, cherry peppers, onions ($4.25)\n*Bianca (Single Slice): Ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, pesto (4.25)\n*Widow Maker (Whole): Salami, sausage, pepperoni, meatball ($31), add Mushrooms (+$3)\n\nThe roommate is a simple pizza guy. He loves the standard meat and veggie pizza. I guess there were only two pizzas with a variety of meats that weren't chicken, so I picked the the widow maker. Added mushrooms cuz I love them so. I like a good new york style pizza as I prefer a thinner crust, so this pizza was up my alley. Good amount of toppings and the crust retained a nice chew. For the slices, I decided to try Frankie's (as I read a lot of good reviews about it) and the Bianca (cuz I love a good slice of pesto pizza). The bianca was a good contrast to all the meat. I actually preferred the widow maker over frankie's as I'm a pepperoni lover. But I did enjoy the peppers on the frankie's slice. I actually added jalapenos to the window maker as I like a little heat. The buffalo wings were standard. Not much heat though. I did adore the blue cheese dip. Had real chucks of blue cheese which I appreciated. I was bummed they didn't come with the carrots and celery as I adore my veggies. I know some think of it as garnish, but I feel like half my app is missing when the veggies aren't there.\n\nGood pizza. I'm glad I found this place. And delivery was only $0.99 on DoorDash. I was just bummed I didn't get my vegetables. I didn't complain as I didn't realize it until later, but giving them three stars because of that. Otherwise, I would have given them four.", "author": "Elena N."}

You can order at the counter and take your ish to go, or sit down and get a server.

I'd assume they keep a pretty watchful eye on the freshness factor given my superb experience. I know plain cheese sounds boring, but theirs is the stuff my dreams are made of. A perfect base pie, no doubt.

Well we were all taking a look at the picture he took and were like \"why are there only 6 people in this photo?\". Umm awkward.. . our waiter inadvertently left someone out of the photo.

We still had enough leftovers for 2 people. Here are the flavors we got\n\nFrankies (Sausage, rapini, garlic, onions, cherry peppers, grande mozzarella) - This is really similar to combination pizza. This is a standard/classic to get here, though it's not something that really stands out or is super exciting. \n\nThe Anthony (Pineapple, Ham, Serrano Peppers, grande mozzarella, romano cheese) - This is your Hawaiian pizza equivalent. They were very generous with the pineapples though the pineapple distribution was not that even throughout the pizza. Could have taken a little more care with spreading out the pineapples. \n\nDivis&Pie (grilled chicken, pesto, cherry tomato, artichoke, mozzarella) - This was my favorite of the 4. The artichokes brought out great balance and flavors to the pizza as a whole. \n\nBianca (ricotta, grana padano, mozzarella, garlic, oregano, pesto) - This one was very cheesy. A lot of solid ricotta cheese chunks over the pizza. If you want something on the cheesy side without that much of 'actual toppings', this is for you.\n\nThey also have this type of hot vinaigrette sauce to serve with the pizzas.

Plus, even though they're modest in size, PPC has enough tables to seat parties large or small (there's also a standing counter section for those just grabbing a slice).  Oh, and did I mention they have a menu full of delicious appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and calzones?\n\n**NOTE: the crusts have been pretty consistent every time - thin and slightly chewy yet thick enough to not get soggy.  Also, the prices listed are for whole pies, not what we paid.\n\n-- CHOPPED ROMAINE SALAD with Bacon, Provolone, Hardboiled Eggs, Cherry Tomatoes, and Avocado Vinaigrette...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#JE1aOupgsX6Nvyex5gHydg)\nSo good!  It might seem pricey for a starter salad, but the portion size isn't that of a starter.  I wouldn't have guessed that the vinaigrette was avocado (it was orange-ish), but it was tasty.  Of course, all that bacon and provolone didn't hurt either!\n\n-- HERBED GARLIC KNOTS (5 Pieces)...$5\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#JDae19psxy9OVOJLkyuq3A)\nKind of a twist (knot, if you will...) on garlic bread sticks.  The center was a little chewy/bready, but the garlic level was spot on.  The flavor wasn't overly harsh or intense, but it was more than just \"garlic\" for posterity's sake.\n\n-- PEPPERONI...$20\n-- BIANCA - Ricotta, Grana Padano, Calabro Mozzarella, Garlic, Fresh Oregano, Pesto...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#Dab5znepBSwEj7RY38UXfQ)\nThe flavor was standard, but they sure piled on the pepperonis!  As for the Bianca, it was great!  I favor pestos and white pizzas over red sauces, so this was right up my alley.  The ricotta made it a little heavy, but I liked the creaminess it added.\n\n-- WIDOWMAKER - Salami, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Meatball, Grane Mozzarella...$26\n-- DIVIS & PIE - Grilled Chicken, Pesto, Cherry Tomato, Artichoke, Fiore de Latte Mozzarella...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#UxysoVSBGyk9wcw-S00i4w)\nAs the name suggests, the Widowmaker isn't their healthiest option, but it sure is tasty.  Of the bunch, the meatballs were the best - hefty and very flavorful.  The Divis & Pie, on the other hand, had a comparatively light mix of flavors that I liked.  However, there might have been a little too much of the artichokes and tomatoes.\n\n-- FRANKIE'S - Sausage, Rapini, Garlic, Onions, Cherry Peppers, Grande Mozzarella...$22\n-- MORGAN - Mushroom, Onion, Bell Pepper, Eggplant, Cherry Tomato, Grande Mozzarella...$22\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-pizza-company-san-francisco#lT0dTEUJopQhv3W2Ss-lcQ)\nFor me, of the ones I tried, the Frankie's might have had the best balance of flavors.  It's a little savory (sausage), a little sweet (onions), and a little bitter (rapini)...yum!  The Morgan, however, is my least favorite.  It didn't taste bad, and I don't have a problem with veggie pizzas, but the flavors weren't super unique.\n\nTo top it all off, it's awesome that PPC is open until 2:30am on Friday and Saturday nights.  Super handy for when those late night hunger pangs hit.  If not for the Morgan and, to a lesser degree, the Divis & Pie, I just might have rounded up from FOUR AND A HALF STARS.  Not that it would take all that much for me to bump them up down the line...", "author": "Mike L."}

We could definitely use a good (and not exorbitantly-priced, ahem, Delfina) pizzeria in the neighborhood. The former Frankie's Bohemian Cafe space is completely renovated, and is nice and comfortable. Both times I've come for takeaway, and grabbed slices. \n\nThe first time I had lots of options, and took home a slice of cheese sicilian, a slice of grandma's pizza (tomatoes, garlic, pesto), and a slice of Frankie's (sausage, broccoli rabe, hot peppers). The service was a little slow, and recognizing this, the server dropped me an extra slice of Frankie's, which was great. \n\nThe second time I visited, there were only the scraps of a few pizzas left in the case, so I had less options. I think I ended up with roughly the same combo as before, but mostly because that's all that was left. (This was right around noon on a Saturday.)\n\nThe pizza itself is pretty tasty. My expectation for \"sicilian\" is a thicker crust, but theirs is thin and plenty good. My experience with grandma's pizza in NY is that it's more about garlic and big chunks of crushed tomatoes, but Presidio Pizza makes theirs with a thinner tomato sauce and a dollop of basil pesto on top. It's tasty, just not what I expected.\n\nBottom line: friendly staff, tasty pizza, great addition to the neighborhood. Glad to have 'em.", "author": "Andrew M."}

It is walking distance so, it makes it convenient. I have no idea why they can't get their act together after all these years. Your order is either not ready, they gave my pizza order to the wrong customer and one time they gave my order to the delivery person - it was out being delivered to someone else. If it's not one thing , it's another with them. Every time they make a mistake (which is often) like over charging, wrong order, adding a 20% gratuity , or having your order sitting on the oven while you wait 20 minutes after you already called it in because they couldn't be bothered to even look for your order. They are so rude and get mad at you when they make a mistake. The customer service is horrible. I'm am done with them and I'm not the only neighborhood customer that have decided not to patronize Presidio Pizza. Convenient or not it's not worth the aggravation. I'm sure I'm wasting my time writing this review. Clearly the manager/owner has no interest in serving their customers with quality service and providing a nice neighborhood experience.\n\nThe final straw was I order two pizzas for my kids sleepover. I paid with a credit card over the phone because I thought the kids would walk over and pick it up. It was pouring so I decided to drive and pick it up with one of my kids. The pizzas were ready and was ready to sign for it when I noticed an 18% gratuity on it . I asked if that was new. I had a cash tip that I was going to give them. He fiddled with the register and kept saying I don't know why the computer did that (was it because I told you over the phone kids will be picking it up) He ended up voiding the order and needed the card . I didn't have the card with me. I told him we come here all of the time and can I take the pizzas home. I have a bunch of starving teenagers. I will call you with the number. I live two minutes away. He and female co-worker (who was absolutely worthless) said \"we can't do that\" . I was like we are not going to rip you off. I had my kid with me. I hate places that come from a place of no. No help , no solutions. This is not the first time I have had a run with this guy (typical hipster/poser dude with his  dark rimmed glasses , short dark hair, and bad attitude) PPC do your business and the neighborhood a favor and get rid of this guy.

Lots of kids there, totally get it. They were busy. I understand what that must be like for sure. I had to repeat myself a few times to clarify and felt pretty sure he got everything I said.\nCut to over an hour later, no pizza to be seen or heard of. I decided to call back to politely check and the guy basically blamed me for why the pizza had not come. He said \"I see this happen all the time, you need to pay attention to your phone. I don't know what to tell you, the driver called you, she even knocked. She called you.\" I repeatedly said she didn't call me, I have had my phone the whole time, and instead of trying to clarify my number or address or anything, he continued to blame me, tell me she called me, and get extremely defensive. I would understand if I was rude when I called, but it's definitely not my style. He then continued to tell me that I need to pay attention to my phone, he didn't know what to tell me, and that they could send it back out. I repeatedly told him we didn't have a buzzer and that is why I need the call, I live in an apartment on the 3rd floor so I wouldn't hear a \"knock on the door\" that allegedly happened. He tried to hurry up and hang up on me after grunting several times that it would go back out. He even had the nerve to say to me \"you act like I am trying to persecute you\" to which I said \"it feels like you kinda are actually.\" After all that back and forth I stopped him just before he tried to hang up on me to clarify that he had the right number, turns out he WROTE DOWN THE WRONG AREA CODE for my phone number. He was not apologetic but rather seemed upset with me that this happened. I tried to make sure the rest of the number was correct and he hung up on me. I honestly cannot believe how someone could be so rude when unprovoked and when it wasn't even my fault. \n\nFast forward to 2 hours later, food still not here. My boyfriend called to check and cancel the order and this go around the guy was extremely polite, apologetic, and offered free soda.\nMy guess is if I would have called this guy would have still been a dick to me, but because a man called he felt it was time to be respectful.\n\nI likely will not return to this place, they've screwed up multiple times and can hardly even take responsibility. It's not the mess up that bugs me because hey, we all make mistakes and I get it can get busy and hectic, but the lack of respect and accountability is what really makes me not want to give them my business anymore. \n\nAND....over 2 hours later and the pizza still has not arrived.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "I had a negative, awkward experience with a take-out order. One evening, I decided to grab-and-go a slice, and eat it along the counter by the left hand side of the register (as I've seen many people do and as I assumed that's what the counter is for. Maybe I'm wrong?). I've done both in the past: ordered to-go and eaten it at the counter or walked out with the slice with no issues. \n\nThis one particular instance left a bad taste in my mouth. After taking my order (but before paying), I tell the gentleman at the register that he could simply put the heated slice on a plate and I'd eat it at the counter (and also so he didn't need to waste a to-go box). Not thinking anything about it, he looked at me and said, 'well why don't you just sit down in the main dining area?' I respond, because I was simply looking to grab and go (and also thinking I didn't want to sit alone, by myself and have a full meal). Then he repeats himself again, this time speaking in a slow, condescending tone and adds \"so his staff can earn the tip\". Oh. Ok. Fine. I reluctantly agree, not because I had issues with tipping but because I did not want to sit by myself at a table for two but now felt obligated to. This comment made me feel awkward since he essentially was asking for a tip (I hadn't even paid at this point so its not like I wasn't going to tip anyway). A few awkward seconds go by and he turns to me and tells me to hold on....moments later he comes back and simply declares, \"Never-mind. I'll take your money. You don't have to sit down.\" OK..... \n\nI paid (and tipped) and quickly finished my slice by the counter (I should have just left). The moral of the story is: Tipping is a gesture for good service. It is not required and frankly, it is tacky to ask. \n\nNote to PPC - I hope these mannerisms don't continue because you'll be scaring loyal customers away!", "author": "Claudia H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-01", "description": "This pizza is exactly what three-stars suggest on Yelp: it's A-OK. Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular. Sadly, I feel like I've been seeing a lot of 3-star establishments recently in San Francisco. Maybe I'm picky, but maybe the quality isn't where it should be (I think it's truly the latter). \n\nThat being said, this pizza is good. You can get a large pizza for around $20.00, which you can't really beat, considering there aren't a TON of quick pizza places in the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, the biggest test for me in pizza quality is whether it can dominate the refrigerator-second-day-challenge (yes, that's a thing). Does anyone remember that episode of Boy Meets World where Eric just grabbed a piece of pizza from the fridge? No? Just me? Okay. Well, it was in that moment that I realized that that was one of the greatest pizza joys that needs to be experienced by everyone; Cold pizza for breakfast! Lunch! Dinner, again!\n\nUnfortunately, this pizza does not pass that challenge. Served when cold, the spices are a little too strong and the cheese/sauce flavor is a little too weak. When hot, the pizza is pretty okay. However, it's nothing to write home about-- unless you're writing to family in Italy. If that's the case, tell your family to open an amazing pizza place in SF immediately. Per favore! We need it.", "author": "Gabriela K."}

The pizza itself is OK, albeit very inconsistent. It's also open late, which is great after a night at the bar...but you should only consider coming here at that time. \n\nHere was my dining experience earlier this week:\n\nMy girlfriend and I walk into the restaurant and two workers are loudly verbally arguing behind the counter. My gf says she is uncomfortable and wants to leave, but I convince her to stay and order because I was starving; my thought was a verbal argument amongst staff would probably be short lived and we would forget all about it. Wrong. The argument intensified between the two men to the point where there was shouting and a little bit of shoving. Being the closest guy to the action, I was seriously contemplating how I was going to separate the two when things turned physical, which seemed imminent. While it never got to that point, the two continued to banter back and forth (disrupting the entire restaurant) for our stay of 1.5+ hours. \n\nOn top of all that, our waitress never got us water, but pointed us to the \"water station\" where we could get it ourselves...aka a pitcher of water they had lazily placed on the counter; I had dined in many times before and this was a new practice. Two couples walked in after we did, but somehow managed to place their order before us and got their pizza before us. Also, to rewind a bit, we initially just wanted to grab a few slices and walk home, but they informed us that they had no pepperoni or cheese slices available or coming soon (at 6:30pm on a Thursday). \n\nAlso, the cheese bread we ordered tasted like it was made in the microwave by a 5 year old. \n\nDon't come here unless you are blacked out.", "author": "Curtis C."}

The people working here are some of the nicest, most generous humans in SF. Listen, Delfina pizza down the street is better. BUT, you also have to wait for like 2 hours for a table there, AND they don't have take-away slices, AND I always feel like the servers are always super over-worked and just want me to order my pizza, wolf it down, and getthehellaouttathere, because my rump is taking up prime Pizza-Consumer space. I totally don't blame them. But it stresses me out.\n\nAt Presidio Pizza Company, they welcome you in, they want to chat with you, they want to tell you all about their pizza, they want to help you deliberate between their awesome choices, and they put on a pretty good show of thinking that you are a nice, interesting person rather than a Super Annoying Waffler Who Can't Make Up Her Damn Mind About What Pizza Slice to Get (which is what I actually am, but they never let me see they're on to me). \n\nOne time when I went there, I was awaiting the amazing chicken parmesan sandwich I'd ordered (now THAT item, my friends, IS in fact better than any I've had anywhere else). I was standing awkwardly in the corner reading my book. Did they say \"scram, nerd-girl, you're taking up space and looking awkward?\" Nay. They gave me a complimentary glass of wine. Another time I went, I was a bit sick and my tummy simply didn't know what it wanted. I hummed and hawwed about different slices and couldn't for the life of me decide. Did they say \"this is not a life or death decision, figure yourself out you pathetic victim of First World Problems?\" No. The dude at the counter said \"you know what, BOTH choices are good. I'll get you The Bianca AND the Widow-Maker, but only charge you for one. That's how much I know you'll like them both!\" And you know what? They were BOTH good. But I also wanted to hug this incredibly generous person for putting up with my bullshit.

The pie cost about $50 (Delivered by Caviar).  I could have had a better and larger pizza from Tony's Pizza Napolitana for about the same price and Tony's pizza is delicious.  What a rip-off!\n\nThird, and most important:  the food.  Quality is simply not there.  The flavors were bland and the crust tastes like cardboard, not fresh baked bread.  This style pizza is inspired by Roman pizza joints/bakeries that have delicious crusts.  You won't find any flavor or texture here.  It's just garbage.\n\nLucky for the owners, this neighborhood is filling up with doofuses from BFE who have no idea where the Presideo is or what pizza should taste like.  Theses newbs assume high prices equate to high quality and will never understand the difference.  So, this place will linger as long as the current bubble.  Once the newbs get sent back to BFE, this place will likely turn back into a dive bar and the owners will go to another town and sell garbage to clueless poseurs under an equally stupid name.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n{PS}  They skimped on two of my toppings that I paid for, so they owe me money.

Not great, certainly not bad, but crust is just meh, and  WAY too much of it (and I\"m a crust eater!).

All the while we're staring at our table - quite hangry...\n\nSince we were starvin' marvin, we decided to try a couple of slices of pizza in addition to the eggplant parm. I think we got a salad too, we were just so hungry. \n\nEverything was OK. Definitely not bad, but it didn't blow my mind. I am kinda picky about pizza though.\n\nThe service continued to be more of a miss than a hit. They were slow in getting our drinks (which we really needed at that point). And it took forever to flag our waitress down to get our check. \n\nAll in all disappointing. Don't think we'll be coming back.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

We opted for two slices each, thinking that since it was early in the day, we could take a pizza home for later if we were so inclined - no. Let me tell you, I WISH we could have taken a pie home, but the 2 huge slices each of us had kept us full for the entire day. \n\nI'm unsure of the names, besides the pepperoni slices, but I'll describe. \n\nPepperoni - TONS of meat, you can tell that they place them on there in nice little rows, I'd say there were 4 piece of pepperoni at the top of the slice and worked it's way down to 1 at the tip. (Which should tell you about the scale and quantity!) Delicious, everything about it, especially the amount of quality of that sauce.\n\nCaprese like Slice - All the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were balanced, less sauce on this one, but still fantastic.\n\nPesto w/Ricotta - This was my favorite, I'm not sure what types of cheese were used other than Ricotta, but it was thicker than your standard mozzarella - in a good way, not like the I'm going to choke to death on all the diary rushing down my throat kind of way. This one was a little greasy, but I want to say that was olive oil on top, it definitely wasn't oozing out of all areas on this one, just a little runoff on the top. \n\nAll slices were really intense in the flavors they packed and I would honestly say the sauce was my favorite part, they used just the right amount and it was nice and rich, overall. The crust was also pretty solid, not too think and not too thin, it was just enough to hold the toppings up but light enough to bend my slice in half for optimal hand to mouth delivery. Overall, good crust, great sauce, fresh toppings, and only 1 napkin was needed!\n\nI think for all 4 slices it was about $16 bucks, without tip - but HUGE slices. As a passerby I'd buy one instead of two, next time. :)", "author": "Chris P."}

The kitchen was filling many delivery orders and it was well over an hour before our pizza was even started (we were next to the pizza oven, so it was easy to watch like hawks).\n\nThe food was good- we split a tasty caesar salad, which was still a full plate for both of us. The garlic knots were just okay- pizza dough brushed with garlic. The pizza was delicious- we had the Grandma and loved it, but it was supposed to be rustic thin and the dough was definitely the normal not-thin version.  We were disappointed that they didn't have any pizzas by the slice left because we wanted to have a sampling of a few different types. Since we had to order a full pizza, the square pizza was much more manageable of a size for our small two-person table.\n\nThree stars instead of two for all the efforts they took to make up for the super long wait.

We stopped in for lunch mid-December and ordered the house salad (simple but very good), the antipasto of roasted veggies, a slice of the Bianca and 2 slices of the Grandma. The pizzas are so freaking good. Fresh toppings, delicious sauces, and really good crusts with just enough chew to them.\n\nThe service was really polite and apologetic about how long our food took (it did take a long time, but I think it may have been their 1st week, so we weren't too surprised).

Hard to argue with that.\n\nWe've since ordered food to go and the pizzas and salads taste nearly as good from the comfort of our home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-22", "description": "Really wanted to like this place and we've tried it a few times since they've opened and have now given up. It's too bad, cause the food is pretty tasty, but the service has just been terrible and we've tried to wait a few months in between each visit, hoping it just needed time to work out the kinks and now we're just over it. \n\nI'll try to keep the summary of each visit short: \n\nFirst time, they had only just opened. There was a large party taking up all the tables along the wall, and we were a party of 4, so could only sit at the communal table. We waited about an hour and then asked if we could order some apps to eat at the counter by the front entrance and were given the go ahead. When we saw the communal table opening up we were getting ready to go and then we were rudely informed by a female server we couldn't do move since we had started at the counter and they gave the table away to another group. Dumbfounded, we were in the process of trying to pay and leave when the owners came to talk to us. Told us to text the next time we were coming in so they could take care of us and pay for our pizza. Nice gesture, but why put the responsibility on us to contact them when we were coming in again? Why not pay for our apps or give us a parting gift certificate? \n\nSecond time, just me and my husband, we did NOT bother to text (actually, we were never given a number to text). Got sat right away, got our wings and meatballs (quite tasty), and then waited for an hour for our pizza... finally our server came to tell us they burned our first pizza and were making another one for us. Great, but it still took about another 30 minutes, even the tables around us commented they couldn't believe we hadn't gotten our pizza yet. The server was really nice and sent us a dessert at the end, but a dessert doesn't erase the ridiculously long wait. \n\nFinally, we ordered delivery. I called and was put on hold about 3 or 4 times. I was informed they didn't start deliveries until about 5 (I called around 4:30), but I could put my order in early. No problem, we weren't really wanting the food until close to 6 anyways. After I finally put the order in, I realized we needed another pizza, so I called back, put on hold again for over 5 minutes, then the manager was on the phone since they couldn't find my order and was dealing with that...can't you just take my order and put it into the computer later?  I asked that the food be delivered between 5:30 and 6, but closer to 6 and the response was 'do you want it at 5:30 or 6?' Uhh...ok, fine, 6. Food showed up at 6:15 and one of our pizzas was missing the pepperoni. Called the restaurant and the manager offered to make another pizza and send it out, but we didn't need an excess of pizza, so I asked that they just send me a gift certificate. He then responded suggested I take down his number and I could text him next time I was ordering pizza and they would take care of it. As my baby is crying in the background, I tell him I can't really do that right now and again, suggest they just send me a gift certificate, he asks for my number and email to get back to me and I haven't heard from him since and it's been 2 weeks. \n\nI guess they just want their guests to bear the responsibility of getting taken care of when they've made a customer service mistake. Maybe they'd rather just lose their customers instead of taking care of them on the spot.", "author": "Angela W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "description": "Oh Presidio Pizza Company how you have taken a lovely Sunday evening and broken hearts, inspired intense hanger and frustration, and crushed pizza desires.\n\nCame in last night craving pizza and wanting to try out a new neighborhood spot with good reviews to round out a big birthday weekend.  Ordered the garlic knots and a pizza (which apparently only comes in size large btw.. how hard is it to make a smaller size people??) half Frankies, half Bianca. We even specifically asked if doing half and half was possibly and were assured it was. Perfect. Both parties, even with very different preferences in pizza, satisfied.\n\n10 minutes after ordering we see our garlic knots come out and placed on a counter outside of the kitchen. Yay-we had food on the way! 5 minutes later.. they are still sitting on that counter, yet to have been delivered/acknowledged/eyed by anyone except our hangry selves. 10 minutes later.. the one waiter in the place finally notices them and brings them over. While glad they have finally been acknowledged, we are clearly not happy to receive 10 minutes out of the oven neglected garlic knots, but give them a chance anyway. Cold. Duh. My boyfriend takes them back to the counter, because at this rate it would have taken another 10 minutes to get any attention from the busy solo waiter and he agrees to have them reheated. About 7 more minutes pass and we finally receive our reheated garlic knots. Nothing special, but definitely better now that they're not cold and rock solid. Still, I would not waste the $/calories on these ever again.\n\nAnd then for the real kicker.. our pizza comes out all one flavor. A large (which we would never have ordered in the first place had it not been the only option as we're only 2 people) all Frankie's pizza, after specifically asking for half Frankies, half Bianca. This MAYBE would have been more acceptable had they been similar pizzas- but one is tomato sauce with sausage and the other is pesto + vegetarian! Aka: hangry allergic-to-tomatoes me, was left without dinner. The waiter apologized and offered to just heat up slices of the Bianca that we were missing. Although nice that there was a solution, this was certainly not what we had in mind when we ordered a baked to order pizza. When the slices came out, not only did they taste stale (not surprising as they'd been sitting on the counter for who knows how long), they were still cold with big blocks of unmelted cheese. And this is what we get because THEY forgot to make us the correct pizza.. Even the baked to order Frankies pizza was just average. Good crust but toppings were meh and now we have a whole size large of it.\n\nAt this point we were completely fed up and asked for the bill. The waiter, who was perfectly nice (but isn't this the base expectation of a server?) took the garlic knots off our order. While this was a kind gesture, it didn't make up for the fact that literally every aspect of our meal was incorrectly prepared. And to boot, didn't even taste great once it finally made it our way. Oh and, only size large pizzas? Really? While we were wasting time waiting for cold garlic knots and the wrong pizza, we saw several SMALL pizzas taken to other tables. So glad we have now paid for a large pizza we don't even want!\n\nSo an hour of disappointment and hanger later, we will certainly not be returning to Presidio Pizza Company. If you're looking for good pizza and service, please avoid.", "author": "Rachel L."}

Pizza is fine, but not exceptional, and with the other many great options around, they will never receive our business or referral again.  We have been coming here for the last 6 months about every other week for family happy hour in an effort to support a local business. This evening, we placed an order at 5pm online for a planned delivery at 7pm.  (We ordered in advance because we have friends visiting from\nOut of town, we both have babies and wanted to make sure we had our dinner after we put our babies to bed.). We received a phone call after the order to confirm the details of the order, and we confirmed for 7pm.  When we had not received our food by 730, we called and spoke with the general manager who said they were very busy tonight and they apologize that the food had not arrived, as it was \"not done on purpose.\" He said it would be out in ten minutes (mind you, we live a few blocks away) and then asked \"do you want to cancel the order?\" We had been awaiting our order thus did not cancel.... However another 30 minutes later it still had not arrived so we called back and were told the owner was delivering. When you hear the owner is delivering your pizza, one presumes that he would have appropriate customer service skills and perhaps would be apologetic about the mishap with his restaurant. This owner, again, said it was a busy night... Said we could do what we want with our decision to support their business but honestly didn't seem to care one way or another. And when asked if he would compensate us for the delay and poor customer service, he responded with disbelief...\"you want your pizza for free?? Um, no\".

Do yourselves a favor and just avoid this place. Food isn't super great and they clearly are pretty rude and disorganized.\n\n--------\n\nI'm writing this review because I had a pretty bad experience recently. During my most recent visit I waited 20 minutes for my couple slices to be reheated, when it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. I found out it got burned while the guy who put it in the oven stood over someone else's shoulder to learn something and forgot about it.\n\nThis was the second visit in a row where this happened, so I mention it to the manager, because if this is the usual occurrence for many customers, I wouldn't be surprised if they stop coming back. I wasn't terribly upset, but I let him know it would have been nice if I was offered a drink or something else for my time. At that point I didn't care I just wanted to let them know I was slightly annoyed and move on.\n\nWhat actually got me upset is while I was explaining to the manager my experience (who was actually the one who did this last time), the guy who took my order comes over and scoffs at me about how already explained what happened and fixed it. I then reiterated my point that I was only annoyed because this is the second time this has happened. The manager then acts confused as if that wasn't possible so I explain that he was actually at fault last time. He blatantly denies it was him and implies I'm mistaken. Case and point, that's because he for about my food and never checked in afterward, the owner fixed the problem. \n\nSo I wasted a bunch of my time and was basically called delusional about the details of my visits to this establishment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-05-14", "description": "I'll preface this review by describing my pizza background: Raised on pizza in Manhattan. Have lived and enjoyed pizza in Chicago, Boston, Miami and various Italian cities over the years. I love Manhattan pizza and the Chicago-style deep dish  pies from Uno's, Due's and Totorice's. When I moved to SF in 1977 the pizza scene was pretty grim. Everyone loved a place called The Front Room where the pizza had a cardboard crust and sauce that tasted like weak ketchup. Pretty awful. There was (and is) Giorgio's on Clement Street that did a fairly good job. And there was (and is) Pasquale's on Irving that also had a good crust and decent sauce. Then in 1979 two guys from Brooklyn opened the first Village Pizza on Steiner Street in The Marina. I was there on the second day and it was like dying and going back to New York pizza heaven. The crust, the sauce, the toppings were all the real thing. The whole thing was heavenly. Village has had its ups and downs over the years but their two outlets (Clement @ Arguello, Van Ness @ Sutter) are still pretty true to the original. And I still have my pies delivered from the Clement Street store. To be honest, Mozzarella Di Bufala restaurant in West Portal also does a great pie but they don't deliver and it's a long drive for me.\n\nAll that said, I was pretty excited when a new pizzeria landed in my neighborhood at Divisadero and California. We hadn't had a pizza joint that I could walk to since Bus Stop closed their local shop a few years ago. Although I had walked by it many times it wasn't until yesterday (5/13/2014) that I decided to go in and get a couple of slices for lunch. Their menu is short and sweet and easy to maneuver. They have a few starters and salads along with a couple of sandwiches for those who don't want pizza. Pizza comes in round and square shapes along with a calzone. Never having tasted their pizza I chose one of their \"House Favorite Combination Pies\" called the \"Widow Maker\" with salami, house sausage, pepperoni, meatball and \"grande\" mozzarella on a thin crust. Each slice was $4.50 plus tax. The slices came from a pre-cooked pie that was on display in a case on the counter along with a number of other types. With a quick warm-up in the pizza oven the slices were ready to eat in no time.\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet by saying that I'm glad Village Pizza is still around because, no matter how close this place is to me (an easy walk), I won't be going back. Perhaps my fist clue should have been the lack of any aroma wafting out the door. As long as I've passed by here I have never been lured in by the smell of pizza cooking. Perhaps this is due to the complete lack of flavor in the pizza. The sauce was almost tasteless. The mozzarella topping was very generous but tasteless. The crust was limp with a bit of yeast in the flavor but bland. As for the toppings; the two slices shared 1 1/2 slices of salami, seven small pieces of crumbled sausage and two small pieces of meatball. If there was any pepperoni on board I didn't see it. The whole picture was tomato sauce covered with melted mozzarella and a few pieces of \"stuff\". If this is what they consider one of their \"House Favorite Combination Pies\" I'm wondering who voted for it because what they define as a \"favorite\" is far from what I consider a \"favorite\".\n\nThey've had a few months to work out the kinks so this poor performance wasn't just a function of being new and a start-up. I realize that a lot of people will patronize the place simply for the location. They have a built-in lunch market from the Drew School boneheads and the massive hordes of medical workers in the neighborhood. So they'll make it on lunch alone. But if you're looking for good pizza and have a choice, this is not the place for you. You'll walk out still hungry for the pizza you didn't get.", "author": "H O."}

Sometimes you get a great slice of pizza and other times you get cardboard with some cheese on it. It all depends on how long the slice has been sitting on the shelf (which I think more often than not is a long time). Unfortunately I think that either means 1) not too many people are going in and ordering slices or 2) they cook too many pies ahead of time and they sit there for a while.\n\nThe people are nice and I like the concept of the place (good menu) . I wish they consistently had fresh slices available though and then this place would be a solid 4 stars. \n\nI will say, it is the best option out of the horrible slice options on Divisadero.

We first went to PPC on one of their very first nights... No signage, no tv on the wall yet, etc. People seemed to still be getting the hang of things but that is perfectly acceptable for a new place, esp if the food is great.  That night we ordered the meat balls and salad to share, then I ordered two slices of pizza as I had to know how their pizza would stack up.  Meat balls were tasty and filling and the red sauce was great, plus the salad was decent although was lacking something I'm not sure what.  The pizza was good, not spectacular, with good sauce, dough, cheese, and adequate toppings.  I wouldn't say it blew away some of the other pizza options in the area, but it was very good and still beat them out overall in my opinion.  They claim to be NY style, and as an East Coaster I would say they are pretty close.\n\nWe have now been back several times and they always seem to be making additions to the decor (tv, some other decorations) which is nice and makes me feel they will be around a while.  The seating is a little difficult but not surprising given the small space... We have sat at the two person table immediately in front of the door and it tends to get crowded, but again you have to expect that.  Extra points for always having slices ready to go, as that is hard to find in the area, and I am usually looking for pizza fast and hot to go.  There are a few beer and wine choices, but that's ok to me... You probably aren't getting too creative with what you drink with pizza anyway.  \n\nHappy this place replaced the European bar or whatever was there before, I just hope it sticks around for a while as it's now worked its way into my go-to stable for quick pizza slices and casual eats with the wife.", "author": "Brad W."}

However, as I was eating I saw a mouse crawling a few feet away. I informed the staff, including someone who seemed to be the owner or manager. One of the staff eventually tried to cover up the hole where the mouse came from, but it wasn't exactly appetizing to eat while watching a mouse scurry around. I was a little surprised that no one on staff either apologized or acknowledged that dining with a mouse isn't the norm. Instead, people seemed a bit nonchalant about it.", "author": "Luna S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-08", "description": "Finally, after living in San Francisco for 23 years, I am happy to report that there is a great slice of NY pizza in town. It's the real deal -- the owner Frankie is from Brooklyn and knows his pizza . He uses all the correct brands of NY ingredients and uses them perfectly. And the pie is a reasonable price -- $3/slice, $18 for a whole large pie -- it looked to me like 18\" in diameter at least. I talked to Frankie, Norty (perfect East Coast name), and Josh, who make the pies, and they are very friendly, down-to-earth, easy-to-talk to guys. \n\nThey have other styles of pizza -- I tried the Grandma style (a Long-Island favorite that is a square slice with sauce, fresh mozarella and basil), and it was great. Didn't get to try the Sicilian slice.\n\nIf like me, you are tired of all of the all-hat, no-cattle pizzerias in SF that talk about what stonemason from the hills of Puglia made the bricks for their oven but produce lousy pizza, then this is your antidote. Presidio Pizza makes great pizza and if you make great pizza, no one needs to know or cares what oven you used.\n\nIf you are tired of Neapolitan pizzas that are fired at 900 degrees and come out gummy on the inside because the people making them don't have the skills to do it right (which is pretty much most of the Neapolitan pizza in SF), then Presidio Pizza is your antidote. \n\nIf you are tired of spending $20 on a 12\" pizza that has no taste, then Presidio Pizza is your antidote, You can get an amazing pizza that is 2 1/4 times the size for $2 less! (For those interested in pizza math, since the area of a circle is pi * r**2, a 12\" pie is 113 square inches, while an 18\" pie is 254 sq. in).\n\nBesides pizza, they also have meatball and chicken parm heros, salads, calzone, a great roasted-vegetable antipasto, and many other dishes. Dessert includes a Nutella pizza and cannoli.\n\nThe environment for eating in is very nice and relazing.\n\nKudos to Frankie and gang for creating a pizza place that provides a slice of NY pizza in a friendly, unpretentious way.", "author": "Norm M."}

Seems like a small thing to require but, obviously, not as easy as one would think considering all the pizzas I've had to suffer through with these wimpy crusts.  I've never been into deep dish or thick crust, I like the crust thin enough so you can fold the pizza yet not to under cooked I have to stick it in my home oven just to cook it for another 10 mins.  I was just minding my own business one day after having blood drawn at the U.C. Med. facility, I had literally hours to kill before my flu shot appointment.  Since I had to fast for 12 hours before the blood test, I hadn't eaten for a very long time, and since there is NOTHING to do in that area (you'd think someone would put up gift shops or something even slightly distracting but all I could find was a couple medical supplies/equipment shops and a small pharmacy and there's only so much interest I have for portable commodes), and since I was hungry and thirsty, and since this pizza shop was almost empty, I ducked inside here.  I don't generally like to eat alone at eateries but the planets were aligned just right and I was hungry.  Got a slice, I think it was called Frankie but maybe not--it was one of those point to it situations, and a glass of icy lemon infused water and it was delicious, just exactly the right spices in the sauce, oh, man, and the crust was perfection.  Every single other pizza place in this town needs to go learn how to make this crust.  Watched a little tv, thought the staff was friendly and nice.  So now I want to try all the rest but  how am I going to get them to deliver this far away (just west and right under U.C. Med. Parnassus)????", "author": "Kai T."}

The crust hadn't hardened, and all ingredients still fresh (including the alrugala - sorry if I'm misspelling that!)! The service is excellent, as employees seem happy to help you and are prompt. My only complaint is, that if you want a whole pie, you are made to order a large one, because there are no other sizes, but the slices (of course they use a smaller pan for them, but somehow they cannot pull off a medium sized one, for those who don't want a large pizza!)! It all turned out well because we enjoyed the pizza so much, we were glad to consume it the next day, and with a much enthusiasm! I do very much recommend them for delightful beer, and good eats!

BUT just ordered takeout - super simple order - 1 pizza that is half cheese and half sausage/olive + caesar with chicken. They said it would be ready in 30 mins. My husband goes to pick it up, and an hour later, its finally ready. They made some excuse that \"a bunch of people\" came in.. what?  They also asked if \"we wanted the pizza to be baked already\".  It sounds as though they weren't prepared for the holiday weekend, and weren't organized, since typically, takeout doesn't create any backup because you don't have to service people at a table.  Plus they weren't even busy... next time, please just be honest and say \"we forgot, we blew it, we missed your order\" - and then actually give some sort of concession (free beer, discount off the order, coupon for the next visit).  Total bummer!!!", "author": "SY K."}

We went here for my bothers birthday dinner casual night with kids.   Not only was the pizza sub par, but the service was simply horrid.  We ordered drinks and they came 20 min later (beers flat and room temp).  Then our order of salads never came, we had to ask our server said they were sent out on a take out order by accident.  One hour later (with hungry kids) we asked where the four pizzas we ordered were.   Seeing a panicked look on our servers face she came back and said the order was never put in.  Just nuts!  We then bought every slice in the window under the warmer. Ate in 10 min and left.  With all the great pizza and service in town this place in an AVOID!", "author": "J K."}

It is awkward when you enter.  There were a lot of customers milling about.  We ordered at the register and sat down, then we learned that we were supposed to order from a waitress.  They could do a better job greeting customers and explaining this.  Then they wanted to add an extra fee to use my credit card.  It's rare that I get this request today with all the merchant friendly credit card options like Square.  I felt like I was traveling back in time.  I won't be back until the credit card fee is removed.", "author": "charlie c."}

It also took about 10 minutes to even get his attention because he was on the phone taking pick up orders before he even attended people at the restaurant. On another occasion I waited for about ten minutes and then left because no one had taken in my order (no one else in line).", "author": "Rohan S."}

Eating the Garlic Knots fresh out of the oven make me feel like I'm in Grandma's kitchen, warm and happy. A new pizza by the slice discount program rewards those of us who need a slice frequently.

Unfortunately can't return for a dine-in until you figure out a way to balance the noise that bounces off the walls.
