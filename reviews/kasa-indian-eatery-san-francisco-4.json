There are always minimally two vegan main dish offerings, plus the dal is vegan. The food could be more spicy, but I'm sure they're appealing to American taste and are trying to be more flexible with the fast-casual aspect of the business. That said, they have plenty of hot sauces you could add to your dishes. \n\nOverall, I think the dishes are good, but not incredible.

I first got acquainted with their fresh-tasting food when they opened their original 18th Street location in the Castro a few years back. Yelp had a sneak preview party I attended, and I remember liking their Lamb Curry Thalis Plate which they described as a deconstructed kati roll or to us unworldly types, an Indian-style burrito. Surprisingly I haven't been back there, but Jamie W. and I ended up here after taking a stroll on Nob Hill. We were thinking of grabbing a salad somewhere for dinner, but then I flashed back on my original Kasa visit and suggested we give this orange and magenta-hued corner eatery a try.\n\nNow I remember when this prime space on Polk and Post was a cool hipster coffee spot called the Fourth Wave, but it's been Kasa for at least five years. The brief menu still consists of kati rolls and thalis plates, but what caught our attention was the $9.95 Chicken Tikka Masala Salad, which turned out to be a generous size platter of Romaine hearts and greens mixed with kidney beans, crunchy vegetables like carrots, celery and red cabbage, and quite a helping of grilled spicy chicken. It came with a lentil chip topping along with a tamarind chutney and a yogurt herb dressing on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2Dgq827). The combination provided tasty freshness with a minimum of decadence. This is a solid option in Polk Gulch.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...uniquely flavorful salad with true Indian spices\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...simple communal tables, seems like most of their business is takeout\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty efficient, not much for chit-chat\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Kasa survives and thrives with nicely spiced flavors", "author": "Ed U."}

However, my recent visit to their Polk Street location did not impress me much (shoutout to Shania Twain).\n\nI unfortunately entered when the staff was consumed with making a massive order (I'm assuming for some kind of an event).  I understood the need for a wait given how much food they needed to prepare, but I was surprised that no staff members greeted or acknowledged the line forming at the counter.   Once they took my order, they moved quickly to make my Aloo Jeera roll, which I got Unda style (with an added fried egg).  You could decide what type of sauce you wanted on your roll, and I got the spiciest available.  I added two samosas as an appetizer, and seeing the completed meal made me ready to dig in!\n\nThe samosas were fine, with a flaky crust covering a decent potato and pea filling.

Depending on my hunger level I will order one of two dishes, maybe a samosa as well. Everything is hot and ready to go, so it's a fast meal, not fast food. \n\nIf I am really hungry, I will order the Thali Combo plate with chicken tikka masala (my favorite) and saag paneer or the lamb curry. It also comes with fluffy jasmine rice, daal (lentils), chutneys and roti bread. It's a big plate and delicious. \n\nIf I'm just regularly hungry for lunch, I'll order the one kati roll with cup of daal. A Kati roll is a small snack size indian burrito filled with whatever you like, but along with the soup - it's a meal. They will ask you for your choice in sauces and I always ask for the most spicy one, as it is so flavorful and hot. \n\nWith the lunch meals you get a free fountain drink, I love the natural sodas and prefer the black cherry sugar free one. The vanilla agave soda is very good too, the selection is unique and great. \n\nI love Kasa, first introduced to it through a yelp event in the Marina when it first opened and have been a fan ever since.

You should take these reviews as constructive criticism and work on it. \n\nYelpers can always update their reviews if they believe a business has improved from last time they visited. This way you are just spreading the word of really bad and absolutely un-professional customer service. \n\nPS: I really COULDN'T CARE LESS about what you have to say now, although I will try my best not to advice ANYONE to go for this business. I am a working professional, none of my office's catering events are knocking at your door. Good luck being disrespectful to your guests. Cheers!", "author": "Bhavesh S."}

Nothing fancy, nothing too shabby.\n\nLUNCH SPECIALS: It's basically almost the menu price but you get a free drink (I think the Thali is $11.50 instead of $11.95, but you get a free fountain drink.  So it is a better deal than otherwise but it's not like a knock it out of the park special.\n\nTHALI: For the price, it's pretty good.  Huge scoops of rice, roti, lentils, 2 choices of entrees, tons of chutneys, raita and a salad (which I don't get anymore because I don't care for it).  I like the chicken tikka masala and the channa masala (garbanzo beans - they aren't on the menu but I think they normally have it if you ask).  The aloo gobi is a bit one note.  The paneer masala is a bit oily.  The other potato dish is almost too sweet.  The saag paneer is just fake tasting.  Doesn't even taste like spinach.  So it was a little hit or miss for me, but I found two dishes I really enjoy!\n\nKATI ROLL(s): for almost the same price as the thali you can get two kati rolls instead.  That's basically a pice of roti with an entree inside of it.  I prefer the Thali since you get rice, lentils and all the other goodies.\n\nMANGO LASSI: it's terrible.  Stay away from it.  I don't even know how to describe it but it tastes almost like it's spoiled yogurt with sour mango leftovers.\n\nSupposedly they are known for their chai but I haven't had it.  But the mango lassi was something to stay away from so I'll stick to their food instead.\n\nThey are a little inconsistent, sometimes they just give away extra pieces of roti for people who ask and sometimes they'll charge you.  So you can ask but depends on how they feel I guess.\n\nThey offer samples, just ask.\n\nDine in or take out.  I think if you dine in you get WAY more food on the thali because it's a huge silver platter type of plate.\n\nAccepts credit cards.", "author": "Traci H."}

There is a sign outside for the Kati Roll being a \"New Menu Item\", so between that and the sign not saying you need 2, I thought this was a completely different product.  Ordered one and the guy kept trying to sell me something to go with it.  When I got it, I realized why.  ITS THE EXACT SAME THING THAT WAS $4 A YEAR AGO!!!  It was literally 3\" long and 1.5\" around.  For $8.  Seriously?!?!\n\nTurns out the \"new\" menu item is the Super Kati Roll, which is just adding rice to the regular Kati roll.  Pass.  Oh, and that one is $10.\n\nGave 2 stars instead of one because the food is really good.  I can recommend the plates, but the Kati Roll is an embarrassment for $8.  BTW, I eat super light.

I've always thought of this place as a local chain that is going to explode nationwide one day, quite deservingly too.\n\nIs their food authentic? Probably, maybe, sort of. I don't think it's worth getting into an authenticity conversation in that most folks here have not even been to India, and is any tikka massala considered authentic? Who cares, really? If it's delicious and involves curry sauces, I'm there, and regional adaptation is important and appreciated. For whatever reason, I don't get as much of the typical Indian food heaviness feeling here, and I don't feel like things are overspiced like at many Indian spots.\n\nI do feel like the food is just slightly better at the Castro location. Over there, it just tastes like the dishes have been cooked longer, are less greasy, and are served warmer. The green chutney at this Pine location is dull-colored and less flavorful. So this is an area for improvement.\n\nWhatever it may be, any Kasa is going to be a solid spot, and I think the current 3.5 star average is being at least a half-star harsh to this delicious restaurant that puts in so much effort.\n\nI really like the new natural soda machines and the metal trays.

It's like Indian Chipotle.  We had the chicken tikka masala and the lamb.. Wow!  Really great flavor and texture like being at a 5-star indian restaurant.  If it weren't for the fact that our beer glasses were dirty, I'd have given 5 stars.. One beer glass looked clean but had a dead fly in it, and the other was literally filthy and sticky..

And I for one welcome their entry into the category of \"real places to eat\". \n\nFor those unfamiliar with Kasa, it's a (yet another) Chipotle-style restaurant where you choose a base (Kati Roll or Thali) and the stuffing (Chicken Tikka, Lamb, Aloo, etc...) and you're on your way before you can say \"omg that's an Indian taco!\"\n\nI usually go for 2 or 3 Kati rolls, depending on how hungry I am. \nJk, I always get 3 because I love those little things :)\n\nThe kati rolls are jam-packed with flavor: the roll itself is flaky and buttery, the stuffing is simmered in spices (usually curry or masala-based) and they add that delicious spicy mint sawwce that makes your taste buds do a little dancy-dance with every bite.\n\nBeware though, some people may find this meal too oily and messy. To me, that's part of the experience, but it sure won't agree with the super health-conscious.\n\nDefinitely check out this place for a quick bite and make sure to bring some extra napkins and hand-sanitizer, because shit's about to get down...\n\n-----\n\nDistinguishing factor: Buttery Indian goodness with the portability of a taco and the unreal flavors of Indian spices.", "author": "Nick A."}

Anyone who tells you otherwise has no idea what they are talking about. A gracious point of view would be to think that they were buying into the whole burrito style of things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-01", "description": "Kasa Indian Eatery represents a new low in dining for me. It's simply the worst Indian food I have ever had in my 52 years on this planet.\n\nBefore I get into the reasons why, I'd like to exhaust whatever praise is due. \nThe concept of Kasa Indian Eatery is not a bad one. Basically, it's Indian fast food served in a corporate setting, in the same way that Starbucks is a corporate coffee place. (Indian/Pakistani restaurants in San Francisco tend to be low rent and funky, and some people would appreciate a slicker presentation. My guess is that those same people would be delighted to get their food almost instantly, instead of at the merely torrid pace most Indian/Pakistani places whip up their food.)\n\nThe creators of Kasa Indian Eatery have done a bang up job on their branding. The Polk street location of Kasa Indian Eatery is bright and airy, with warm tones supplied by wood tables and floors, and some bells hanging from the ceiling. The color scheme and fonts are professional and appealing. The background music is soothing, concept appropriate, and just loud enough to provide a veneer of authentic atmosphere without interfering with conversation. That pretty much exhausts my praise.\n\nUnfortunately, again like Starbucks, all of the creative energy of the owners has gone into either branding or, of paramount importance, the art of extracting the last penny of profit from consumers by providing an appalling product at inflated prices.\n\nLet's start with how ghastly the food is. Kasa Indian Eatery makes their basmati rice in a rice cooker, and they get the results you'd expect. The rice was clumped together and mushy in places and undercooked in others. Supposedly, it was cinnamon scented rice, but there was no cinnamon flavor or scent, or even salt for that matter. The spices in the Saag Paneer tasted raw. The cilantro chutney was harsh and medicinal. I could go on, but all the food my wife and I had was uniformly horrible. My wife remarked that the food tasted institutional, like it was from a hospital or a prison. Just so.\n\nNow, let's talk about value. In all cases, the portions were miniscule (which was a blessing in our case). For ridiculously small amounts of two types of entr\u00e9e, a teaspoon of chutney, about an eighth cup of rice, and a small ladle of watery dal, the price was $10.95. That's what Kasa Indian Eatery jokingly calls a Thali (plate).\nThe final insult is the $2.50 charge for an eight ounce cup of admittedly good chai. As anyone who has eaten Indian/Pakistani food in San Francisco knows, the standard is to have chai available for free. It's a gesture of hospitality.\nSadly, the owners of Kasa Indian Eatery have no interest in hospitality, making good food, or serving the community. \n\nYou think I'm exaggerating? Trust me, no one who cared the slightest iota about good food could create dishes this inedible. It speaks volumes about the pure contempt the owners of Kasa Indian Eatery have for their customers. Same goes for their portions and pricing.\n\nGenerally speaking, I wish small business owners well, even if they are incompetent. It takes a lot of hard work and moxie to run a small business, and I appreciate that. \n\nHowever, in the case of Kasa Indian Eatery, the owners are so transparently venal and predatory, I wish them a swift and painful bankruptcy so a potentially prime restaurant space might be made available for restaurateurs who wish to serve the community while they are making a living.", "author": "Michael K."}

One bite of the so called \"kati roll\" and I threw the whole thing in trash (where it belongs). I had ordered their chicken and lamb kati rolls, which the person behind the counter prepared by slopping some curry in a greasy tortilla and wrapping it up. Kati roll is a very popular snack in India where skewered grilled meat (hence the name kati, which means skewer) is rolled inside a tasty paratha with condiments and sauces, and is somewhat similar to gyros. You DON'T PUT CURRIED SLOP in a kati roll. On top of it, the SLOP they put in the kati roll was just plane LARD and had a disgusting smell. I have had Indian food all over the country but had never tasted anything this vile ever! My partner had ordered the 'Thali\", she also threw the food in garbage after having only two spoon fulls.\n\nWhile Indian restaurants in the USA  tend to be mostly mediocre or bad, , \"Kasa\" takes the cake and is definitely the worst one I have ever been to. San Francisco has its share of very bad Indian restaurants, but \"Kasa\" beats them all. The food was greasy and horrible tasting and I wonder what kind of cheap and unhealthy stuff they put in it..", "author": "Joe M."}

Tried it again tonight and to verify my suspicion that it has some work to do I checked reviews here and see I am not alone in thinking this place needs to step it up.\nMy first meal was a great experience. I was happy with it but I will agree with a lot of others on what they are saying about watered down, greasy and fatty substance (at least with the lamb curry). \nTonight I had 2 kati rolls - one chicken tikka masala and one the lamb curry. I'm not sure why but they weren't all that tasty. I decided to try another samosa and was disappointed to see (as I pointed out in my first review even though I gave 5 stars) that the samosas are still kept in a tin foil container and mine was lukewarm at best. So, after leaving I had already decided I may not be back and was extremely thankful Shalimar is still close by. \nI hate to be mean and I don't give negative reviews easily, but when I do it is always with the hope that the feedback will lead to positive changes that benefits everyone - the customer and the owner who sells more food. \nAs I mentioned in my first review, I've had plenty of food from the Kasa food trucks and I was blown away every time. So, I know it can be done. I'm not sure what it is about this location that seems to have something different going on but they should fix it and fix it soon.", "author": "Matt H."}

Kasa not only makes delicious Kati rolls, but their more traditional (by Indian restaurant standards) dishes are ridiculously good.\n\nI've had their black daal a few times.  The minute you take a bite it is incredibly apparent that this is the variety that has been slow cooked, kind of like mom used to make it.  It was a specialty at home, so when you get that kind of quality at a restaurant, especially a fast casual spot like Kasa, it is definitely notable.\n\nYesterday I was in the mood for Kati rolls (Saturday cheat day!).  I had mine made Unda Style, where the equivalent of a one egg omelet is literally fused to a tava heated roti right on the grill.  I ordered both of mine with chicken tikka, all of the fixings (3 or so fresh chutneys, pickled onions, tamarind sauce).  \n\nI wish I could convey how happy I was after my first bite.  Just an unbelievably flavorful experience.  Totally hit the spot.\n\nThere are a ton of Indian options, particularly down near the TL.  Kasa in my opinion provides a better overall experience.  It's quick, it's high quality, and it is significantly lighter.  I could eat Kasa everyday and not worry about clogged arteries...for whatever that's worth!", "author": "Bobby N."}

The Thali plate is available vegan style but my chief concern is that there is rarely a main dish for us.  You can order two add on sides, with the rice and naan bread and a small veggie side.  Usually the side dishes are potatoes of some sort.  So you're basically eating tons of carbs and starch.  The chana masala is the one protein source I have seen, but it is rarely available.  It is my birthday today and chana masala was on the menu and I was looking forward to it, but the server informed me after he was almost done making my plate that it was out.  That was basically the only reason I came in, so imagine my disappointment.  I am pretty sure the samosa he gave me has dairy in it, I can taste it, so I am pretty PO'd.  For $16 I shouldn't have to worry about someone being dishonest to me about my order.

I like the space and the gentleman behind the counter was very nice. This is definitely a different style of Indian food. I'm not exactly sure if it's more Southern India, as with the other restaurants I like are more Pakistani/Northern Indian flavors. The flavors are light, the ingredients were fresh, and I didn't get that heavy feeling walking out of there. The mango lassi was actually quite tasty. It has different spices, a little tart, and not as sweet as the other mango lassis I have had. What I think would make this place better is cooking the food to order. I think it can be almost criminal to have food just sit out there waiting for people to eat it. I think the ingredients are too good to just sit, dry out, and not be as hot as it should be. The Roti became a bit tough, because it seems like they just make batches of it, and just keep it in a warmer. As with the food, the roti would be much better if it weren't sitting out.
