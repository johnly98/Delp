You will usually see big groups of 2nd generation Chinese people here . Hence I like to categorize this restaurant as one of the last Gum SAn (golden mountain) restaurants .  Meaning food that was cooked for Chinese Americans with a taste of Cantonese cooking that transformed into Americanized Cantonese food from the 70s-90s\n\nI think the food taste better for dinners especially weds nights opposed to the lunches . \n\nWe usually order the chicken salad , there's two we get the cheaper one it's better.\nThe stuff chicken with sticky rice is good when you have a bunch of people.\nThe steamed salted egg with pork is a hit or miss.\nOh the salt and pepper pork chops are tasty but sometimes they give me salt and pepper spar ribs and they are smaller . And they don't tell you. :(\nThe salt and pepper chicken wings are good as well\nThis place gives you house soup .\nThe chow mein and chow fun are tasty .\n\nServers have been here for ages so  it's good to get to know them .\n\nAlso for big parties I recommend getting a winter melon soup,\n\nThis is one of the last  golden mountain restaurants so enjoy them now because once they're gone this type of food and restaurant will be lost !!!!!!!", "author": "Jenn C."}

I wasn't a fan of the ginger crab or the crab and mushroom soup but everyone else raved  about it. The salted crispy chicken was amazing and had msg on the side for those who wanted it. There was a delicious squab lettuce roll, braised beef over baby bok choy (my favorite), a shrimp and scallops dish with mixed vegetables and ginger, and some relatively innocuous noodles at the end. \n\nI'm leaving something out. Oh -- the warm tapioca soup dessert was delicious. \n\nWe also had Peking duck and it was succulent. \n\nService was good.

This is one of those Chinese family style restaurants that caters to mostly banquets of families and thus rarely if ever do I see non-Asians eating here on their own.  In fact I don't think I've ever paid for a meal here because usually I go here when my mother wants to take my family out to dinner.\n\nWe came here on Christmas Eve and it was packed.  We had reservations so we were able to get our table.

Possibly we did not order their best dishes, but the dry fried beef chow fun was recommended by the waiter.  We also had wor won ton which was flavorless and shredded chicken chow mein which was good.  We did not like the raw bean sprouts on the chow fun.  And the heavy amount of grease in the bottom of the chow fun platter was not appetizing.  I did notice the \"wok hei\" that another reviewer mentioned, but an appetizing stir fry smell cannot overcome a dish that lacks flavor.\n\nPortions were generous but food was really mediocre.  As other reviewers have noted, the interior is a really tired '80s look and needs a good cleaning.  This restaurant was really popular in the late 80s and early 90s.  It seems stuck in a rut, although the chef from those days has passed away.", "author": "Joanna S."}

There was not one piece of chicken meat in this order. For $45, it's definitely a unique twist on a dish but hardly worth the price in my opinion. (3.5/5)\n\nSeafood Stir Fry with Mustard Greens - mustard greens were on point, they were crisp and not too bitter. Seafood (though only shrimp and scallops) were also decent in my opinion, but overall, the plate was small. (4/5)\n\nBlack Bean Cod Filets - WHERE THE FISH? This dish is literally onions and bell peppers sauteed in black bean sauce. (0/5)\n\nBraised Lamb in Clay Pot - decent flavor but many pieces were tendon or tough to chew. (3/5)\n\nPea Sprouts with Dried Scallop - slathered in gravy, my favorite vegetable became almost inedible because of how salty it was.

Everything else that came afterwards... not so much. \n- The butterfly shrimp was bacon wrapped around shrimp, but fried to the point that the bacon tasted like hard cardboard. \n- Fried quail: definitely never had this before. Crispy and tasty, more game-y than chicken and much less meat. \n- Mandarin pork ribs: sounded delicious on the menu, but we hardly touched this. It came out cooked with a bright red-pink sauce, too sweet and tasted a bit floral. It was just really strange tasting.\n- The beef clay pot: expected there to be more taste to this dish, but I guess it was just classic Cantonese style clay pot, in a sort of bland tasting stew (texture was tender, though)\n\nOverall, kind of disappointed.

Our first impression was that the place looked a bit tired: duct tape on the door handle; some torn chair upholstery; worn carpet; a restroom cluttered with chairs and equipment.\n\nAnother member of the party, who had recommended the place, took care of the ordering:  about a dozen courses from one of several banquet-menu options (listed prices ranging from $289 to $549 for a party of ten, with larger groups like ours presumably proportional), though there was apparently some room for negotiation over substitutions.  The food was more impressive than the room.  Everything came to the table hot and with good timing, placed efficiently and unobtrusively on a lazy Susan.  Highlights included crab egg drop soup;  chicken salad; shrimp lettuce wraps; saut\u00e9ed prawns with peapods, sprouts, and mushrooms; salt and pepper chicken; broccoli and mixed vegetables; bok choy; whole crab; whole fish; Mandarin spareribs; wheat noodles with mushrooms.\n\nThe inevitable liter of 7-Up and bottle of Martinelli cider  on the table.  Limited beer selection:  Tsing Tao, Heineken, Bud, Sierra Nevada.  No hard liquor.\n\nWith tax and tip, our party paid $30 per head.\n\nMetered street parking is available on Geary, at $2.25 per hour; meters take credit cards.  Two hour limit, but meters can be fed.  Parking on nearby side streets is free if you can find it, but still subject to a two-hour limit, which I'm told is enforced.

I've been eating here long enough that I didn't know the name was Kirin... my cousins and I refer to it by hr owner's name, Henry's. Don't come with a small group - go big and go banquet style. \n\nThis is an old-school Chinese restaurant that's been around for ages, so it is crowded on the inside (especially when so many families are eating here) and service can get a little scarce sometimes (but it's usually not bad since there's usually table service with serving food). Try to get ahold of the main guy, Henry, and you'll be well taken care of. \n\nI'll be honest - I have no idea how we go about ordering food here. I think my relatives order ahead of time so we get the banquet style dinner (and a table), but I'm actually not super sure... but I can totally tell you which dishes are best. \n\n1. Fried quail here is the bomb dot com. Always perfectly seasoned and crispy, and always a consistent size. \n\n2. Order ahead and get the off-the-menu stuffed crispy chicken with glutinous rice. It's basically sticky rice inside of the most delicious crispy chicken skin. This is hands down one of my favorite, favorite things to eat, enough that we've started ordering two platters of it every time my family eats here. \n\n3. Lobster noodles here are great - the lobster is a little more seasoning-heavy and greasy than a seafood joint (such as Newport Seafood down in LA), but the noodles here are way better. Trust. \n\n4. With so much heavy food, get a soup, too. The winter melon soup is always good, IMO, and usually comes before the heavier entrees. \n\nOverall, this isn't fine dining, this isn't the best food you'll ever have, but it's homey and it's family style.

My parents had pre-ordered the menu and most of the dishes were the stereotypical dishes, but the two that I was looking forward to were the winter-melon soup served in a winter-melon and the sticky-rice stuffed in deep fried chicken skin.  I was disappointed by both dishes.\n\nThe winter-melon soup was very bland and the chicken chunks in the broth were severely overcooked.  The melon flesh was very soft and the melon collapsed without the support of the melon flesh as expected..  \n\nThe sticky-rice that was inside the deep fried chicken skin was also very bland and the chicken skin was very crisp.  The pieces of the dish where cut into large non-bite sized pieces, so you could only eat the components of the dish separately without making a mess.  Imagine sticky-rice sandwiched between two very crisp pieces of chicken skin that are not bite-sized.  If you try to take a bite, all the sticky-rice falls out because the chicken skin is still intact and squeezes the sticky rice out.\n\nAll of the other dishes we had were decent, but I doubt I'd be back to this restaurant anytime in the near future.", "author": "Wilson K."}

The buns were OK though. \n\nOverall, this place is only good for a few items, the Fish Salad, the Oyster OR Squab Lettuce Cups and the Lobster Noodles.

We've visited this restaurant twice now and the quality of food and friendliness of the staff is great! Sorry in advance.. no pictures because I was hungry and gobbled before it crossed my mind to snap a shot. Typical.\n\nYou gotta get the chicken skin with sticky rice. It's exactly what it's called. Imagine sticky rice, sandwiched within chicken skin. Oh so fatty, and oh so delicious. Apparently it's by ordering ahead only. So if you have a craving for chicken skin and rice, you have to order it 24 hours in advance. It's nice to try, so definitely order that if you get a chance. \n\nFrom the seafood to the soups, all is great. The fried wonton in soup is good too.. and I'm typically not a fan of fried wontons. The honey walnut shrimp is tasty, but they could go a tad lighter on the sauce. Talk about mayo overload. \n\nDinner comes with almond jello or red bean.

My group ordered:\n\n(1) Eight precious jewels tofu clay pot\n(2) Pan-fried minced \"perpal\" tofu\n(3) Stuffed chicken with sweet rice\n\nThe stuffed chicken was incredible.  My group had never tried the dish before--sticky rice stuffed inside a chicken and sliced into large, bite-sized pieces. The chicken, which was cut and blended in to the sticky rice, was moist and flavorful.  The chicken skin on the outside was crispy and just the right amount of salty.  In addition to the chicken, we ordered a very unique tofu dish, minced \"perpal\" tofu. These were fried tofu pouches containing onion and other spices.  The eight precious jewels tofu clay pot was reliably delicious, as it had multiple types of seafood and mushrooms.  I thought the \"perpal\" tofu was a little too salty, but I really enjoyed the clay pot.\n\nNot only was the food memorable, the service was, too!  After refilling our glasses of water and attending to our table, our waiters hummed their way back to the opposite side of the restaurant.  A couple minutes later, their hums progressed to full-on singing of Chinese opera. Free (unintentional) music!  We had some less pleasant auditory stimulation, too, in the form of the restaurant's telephone ringing off the hook.  This could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you want to look at it. On one hand, the restaurant is popular. On the other hand, the restaurant ambiance is shot because the telephone never stops ringing!\n\nAll in all, a very memorable meal.

NOT knowing what to get, my family and I just stuck to ordering off of the lunch specials. The dishes are fairly priced, $6.75-~$9.00 per dish. I got the chicken and broccoli chow Mein ($6.95), my sister got the pork fried rice ($6.95), my mom got the shrimp and beef over chow fun ($7.25) and my dad got (I think) the house special noodle soup (?) ($7.95). \n\n1. Chicken and broccoli Chow Mein - Salty!, not enough broccoli. But plenty of chicken, noodles weren't too bad but just a tad greasier than I like. \n\n2. Pork fried rice - very inconsistent dish. Some bites were bland and some were just eating chunks of salt!\n\n3. Egg and beef chow fun - no gravy. It was pretty good, not too oily. Only downside was that the noodles were overall pretty tasteless. Nice amount of eggs and beef was good. \n\n4. House special noodle soup - came out to be seafood soup. Very little noodle to meat ratio. Soup tasted like cabbage soup. Okay overall. \n\nNow on to the worse part of the experience at Kirin....the service SUCKS! The waiters could care less about you! They look bored, they are lazy, and they are very, VERY RUDE. The bald, large waiter couldn't be any more impatient waiting for us to decide what to order after five minutes of sitting down.

Year 4710 on the Lunar Chinese Calendar. \nYear of the Dragon, my year! \n\nWe came here like we did last year to celebrate Chinese New Year, and since Kirin is famous for its Fish Salad, that is what we ordered, a mountain of Fish salad! It was good! This is a dish that is increasingly hard to find. It is similar to Chinese Chicken Salad, but more refreshing and delicate. \n\nYou have to come here early, otherwise the cramped family style tables get all filled up. We always come at 5:00 pm to insure a table. \n\nOther tips for those who are not Chinese, but eating with them:\n\nThe Chinese aren't big on pubic displays of affection, so the way they (older Chinese) show their love is through food, and lots of it! They usually over order, because it would be super embarrassing for anyone to not be full and satiated! \n\nDo not insult your hosts by not attempting to eat that strange looking dish in front of you! Grin and bear it!\n\nAnd just like Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club taught you, you should politely refuse the first attempted offering from your host, wait for the next attempt, then acquiesce on the second.\n\nAnd when the lazy Susan comes your way, you should only take a little and leave enough for the others, don't hog the dish like a Pig! It isn't your year anyway, yet! \n\nAnd even though the host denigrates themselves to appear humble, you have to heap them with positive praise when they do that, so they can appear even more humble! DO NOT agree with their self-inflicted deprecations, or you will commit a serious Faux Pas! \n\nAll you Yellow Fever white guys dating Chinese girls better do your homework! OR you will hear a lot of Chinese chatter that is surely complaining about your White Devil poor manners! \n\nAs typical, we had a ton of food with many other dishes besides the Fish Salad.

But you need to order this 24 hours ahead, just like you have to at most restaurants for Peking Duck. \n\nLast tip: Fight for the check, but not too hard.

Light, clean and full of great flavors and textures. \n\nSquab lettuce wraps - some of the best I've had in a while. Squab tasted clean and not gamey wrapped in perfect crispy lettuce. \n\nWinter Melon Soup- I haven't had this dish in years! It was perfectly cooked, melon scraped off the sides, amazingly light broth and bits and pieces of mushroom and chicken. Perfection! \n\nRice stuffed Chicken- Sticky sweet rice stuffed into a crispy de-boned and hollowed out chicken carcass. Words cannot describe how delicious this dish is. \n\nPeking duck with Bao - really do I need to say anymore?\n\nOyster, duck, pork with seaweed and fungus over lettuce - Dried oyster reconstituted with a deep grainy oyster taste, with fatty bits of pork and dark meat of the chicken topped with a xo sauce. Old school yumminess right there! \n\nBoy choy and mushrooms- the mushrooms were meaty and in a great sauce over steamed bok choy. Everything I love in my vegetables! \n\nHoney walnut prawn- yes an americanized dish but yummy and sweet nonetheless. \n\nChow mein - long noodles for long life.

And nice to see what's going on with the food from where we were sitting.  The reason this place only gets 2 stars is though the food is fresh it wasn't so good that I would rush back. Customer service was mediocre and they charge for tea,  which isn't customary for the many Asian restaurants I've been to before, and the .fortune cookies were stale.  :(  Also as we are sitting at our table less than 6 feet from the kitchen they started throwing the kitchen mats out causing dust to fly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-27", "description": "When I first heard that we had a way to eat here, (gift certificate,) I thought \"Isn't this that \"lobster noodle\" place? I recall in recent memory walking by here many times and reading this restaurants \"window specials.\" Everything seemed to be $29.99, including one of my favs, Lobster noodles. Actually, my knowledge/experience with Kirin goes \"back in the day.\" Back to a time when I think (correct me if I'm wrong please,) that this was a \"northeast China\" restaurant. You know, northeast China, where the food is hot, spicy, garlicky, thick sauce, kinda  Koreanish.  (Think San Tung.) The name would indicate that, Kirin being tucked away in northeast China, right on the border with Siberian Russia, which it was a part of till Mao snatched it after the war. (Kirin's Russian Orthodox churches are still famous.) I think I remember eating here with a Korean friend many years ago, and I think I recall the food being red,hot, and spicy. At that time we thought Kirin was \"the San Wang of the Richmond.\" So you can imagine my surprise when we entered and we heard all the waiters speaking Cantonese, and a quick look at the wall and window menus, showed us that this has been a Cantonese restaurant for a long time. Further, a quick look at the menu showed us that there were no \"Koreanish\" dishes here, (no Korean writing on the menu next to the descriptions, a giveaway. ) So oh well, no biggie, whatever. Cantonese food is one of our favs, so a quick mindset adjustment, (Winnie was looking forward to \"Cham pon\" (Korean-Chinese spicy seafood soup,) and we were good to go. So menu in hand, \"what are we gonna eat now....\" And then Winnie has a great idea. \"Why don't we order stuff that we don't usually eat? \" Wow! Profound. (Hey why didn't I think of that?) haha.  Expensive food here we come! We had a $60 gift certificate. So what if we go over and pay a bit extra, right? Haha. My lobster noodles, are suddenly \"in da house.\" So we started to order, and the riches flowed; But first, let's establish a rating system. Move over Michelin, (bunch of stuffy ole white guys in starched shirts and tuxedos deciding what we should eat.) We need a \"people's rating system,\" that reflects what real people with real pocketbooks eat. So the time has come for the \"Sushi G Rating System.\" Designed for YOU not Elon Musk. \"Power To The People,\" yelp style! So here goes. Yum-O! (with exclamation) means super good. \"Yum-O\" (no exclamation) means really good. Just \"Yum\" means good, and \"bleh\" means mediocre. Of course \"gag\" means awful. So now, that we are complete with the \"sushi g rating system\". (Wow, another yelp \"trademark\" for me! I'm unstoppable! I just keep pullin dem rabbits out of dem hats! One of the rare times I actually like myself! Haha,) First up, lobster noodles, (mandatory) Yum-O! Then. we had in random order, Deep fried tofu/ fish cake strips with bok choy. (Yum-o!) Chinese Greens with humongous button mushrooms, (Yum-o) Seafood Tofu Clay.Pot, (Yum-O) and Salt and Pepper Fried Squid, (Yum-o). After I asked, they gave us red bean dessert, (hong dao.) I had seen them bring out comp tapioca desserts (white, green,) to other tables after they finished their courses all nite, so after waiting and nothing came (but the bill,) I asked. And yes, they did bring it, but not willingly or happily, and with no comment or apology. We had just spent $75 there, wtf??? So one star off for kinda screwin up on the dessert at least, (and \"profiling\" at the most.) We were the only table that was not \"all Chinese,\" and some had spent far less than us and got it automatically, but one look at us, and \"not for them.\" They probably thought, \"no need, they probably don't even know about this, or that they're supposed to get it.\" Sux. But that did not ruin my evening. As I sat there staring at bae, and then at my big a-- plate of expensive Lobster noodles, and as I thought \"Tell the world that we finally got it all right, I choose you....\" I felt like Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.....until I got outside, and....no limo, ...just my old Ford Focus, (with a big a--'ticket on the windshield,) and then I realized, \"nah, it's okay, I am, and always will be, just lil' ole sushi g,....,but this time, with a stomach full of Lobster Noodles.", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-12", "description": "There are so many Chinese restaurants in this City that it's hard to tell what's good, and what isn't.  I divide them into a couple categories:\n\n1. The truly awful ones that serve mostly Americanized-Chinese dishes. Food so bright and shiny you need to wear sunglasses. These have one billion items on their pink paper $5.95 lunch special menus, all Panda Express-y, minimal service, some good, all monster-sized portions, menu items that my Chinese mama has never heard of (what is egg foo young?), though it's still decent and a great value if you are hungryhippo-y.\n\n2.  Chinese restaurants for the locals, with affordable, authentic, solid food.  The majority of the Chinese eateries you'll find in SF, food somewhat shiny, prices ranging from $7.95/entree and up, an endless variety of dishes that are authentic, often filled with crowds of multi-generational Chinese families fighting over checks. Money fight FTW.\n\n3.  The nicer Chinese restaurants, the ones where you go for 10+ course banquet dinners, where they change your plate after every few courses, good service, VERY seafood heavy and an incredible value for the amount of food they give you, moist towelettes are often seen at these restaurants.  As are lobster-catching waiters who present to you live crustaceans for your inspection and approval. \n\n4. Expensive and clean Chinese restaurants that are Yelp- and/or city-guide-famous but that local Chinese don't go to.  I would imagine the food at these places is pretty good, but the lack of bang-for-your-buck deters most local Chinese people from frequenting. Value is a major criterion! Yank Sing is a prime example of this kind of restaurant. \n\nKirin is a solid Type 2 restaurant.  Good pricing, tasty, somewhat shiny food, acceptable service, and pretty authentic.  I came here last Saturday, and we ordered the Golden Crispy Chicken (half a chicken = $10) that comes with the pink and orange shrimp chips that stick to your tongue, the salt and pepper squid, beef and snow peas, and winter melon soup.  The chicken was great, and the skin was fried lovely - you bite and hear the CRISP sound!  Beef and snow peas were blindingly shiny. Awesome. The salt and pepper squid was alright; I've had better ones at dim sum places, but this was still good.  The winter melon soup was so savory and very light - thank you, MSG!  \n\nEverything was oh-so-solid, plus they gave us free dessert - either red bean soup or almond tofu, in addition to the standard fruit and fortune cookies.  Our entrees ranged in price from $7.50 to $9.75.  The service was fine too, though I think we were lucky to get one particularly nice waiter.  He offered us the free dessert and afterward another meaner waiter glanced over at our table and asked another colleague in Chinese: who decided to give them free dessert?!  Other waiter: who do you think?  \n\nHey waiters, heads up that a table of Chinese kids can understand you.  \n\nBut anyway, four very well-deserved stars for this solid Type 2 Chinese restaurant.  Meant to be eaten family-style, come here and enjoy some simple and good Chinese food. Though there wasn't any one dish that was so spectacular that I'd rave about it, everything was very good.  So if you're in the Outer Richmond, check it out.  Hopefully you get the nice waiter, too.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I immediately thought of this place, recalling that they've never eaten here. When going to restaurants, customers are best advised to order their signature dishes. We tried two of the three as our menu consisted of the following: \n\nAppetizer \nRainbow Chicken Salad (signature) - No, this is not the same that you find in most Chinese restaurants and it's definitely not the same as the Costco kit. A mixture of rice noodles, fried shredded wonton skin, marinated/pickled ginger, peanuts, and, of course, shredded chicken meat. The other signature dish that we did NOT order (parents squeamish about raw fish) is their Rainbow Raw Fish Salad as it would have been repetitious. - $18.00 (small - enough to feed a party of six) \nSoup \nDried Bok Choy Soup (Choy Gon Tong) - A clean tasting broth with featuring sun-dried bok choy, almond seeds, and pork meat. The trick to this soup is cleaning the bok choy well, which they certainly did. - complimentary \nEntrees \nSugar Pea Sprouts with Dried Scallop - Sauteed large pea sprouts in a thick sauce filled with shredded dried scallop. This dish was a good pairing with our other entree. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. - $15.75 \nStuffed Chicken with Sweet Rice (signature) - Deep fried chicken skin encases a tasty sticky rice seasoned with preserved pork (lap yuk - think cured ham), diced shitake mushrooms, pork meat, and dried shrimp. The trick is keeping the skin crispy and cooking the rice correctly (not too dry nor mushy). Success. - $33.00 \nDessert \nAlmond Jello with fruit cocktail - This was only okay for me as I like a heavy almond flavor to the jello which was lacking. \nTaro Tapioca - Hot sweet soup option that my parents chose. They finished it so it must have passed their test. - both complimentary, so how can you complain. \n\nWe arrived before 6 pm on a Saturday evening, which seemed like the right time as I found a parking space about a block away (parking can be difficult as this is the Richmond District). The dining room had only three occupied tables when we arrived, but it was mostly filled by the time we left around 7:15 pm. There are more large tables here as it is obviously a banquet destination for many locals. I noticed Jason G's lunch and Steve L's banquet experiences are great references for dining here with friends and family respectively.  As we left the restaurant, my parents kept trying to compare the meal to other places from past dinners. But I think we were in agreement that what they do well here is very good.", "author": "Mike C."}

The man who greeted us asked us how many were in our group and rudely showed a corner table with an abrupt \"Here!\" with a tone of disgust. For a party of eight, we were missing a couple of plates and teacups but nothing was offered. We had to grab them from the next table. \n\nHe returns with the menus and dumps them on our table. He won't even bother to say what the lunch special was and abruptly leaves. We check out the Lunch Menu and was pleasantly surprised to see that the majority of the dish where under $8.00. They ranged from $5.50 to $12.00. All agreed that it was a bargain indeed. We ordered some Rice Plates and Noodles, with a couple of Beef Won Ton soup for all. \n\nAfter several minutes, he returns with the soup and starts pouring them in those tiny soup bowls with a ladle. But he's splashing the soup and some are spilled onto the table. I look at his face and they are stone cold. Not even an acknowledgment as he leaves us yet again when he has done his duties. He didn't even bother to wipe the table from the soup spill he created. Nor did he bother to serve the soup and left them as is without saying a word. He's lucky we were hungry, otherwise, I would have dumped the soup on top of his head. I look at my wife, I look at her cousin and we laughed at the absurdity of the service. It's this kind of service that perpetuates the typical rude waiter stereotypes at Chinese restaurants. \n\nThen we received our lunch order and didn't expect a pile of food on a big plate. Boy they were hefty, and they surely didn't skimp on ingredients. You also wouldn't know there was a world-wide rice shortage by the amounts they were serving. Plus, their food was actually good. The seafood was full of seafood just as advertised. You usually get a good dose of vegetables with your seafood when you order them at other restaurants...but not this one.\n\nI had almost forgotten about the bad service we had gotten, and the food almost made up for the experience until I noticed the same waiter serving a group of other patrons. Now this group had arrived at least half an hour after us and the service they received compared to ours was like night and day. He was carefully serving their soup and even placed each bowl in front of every patron. He even managed to crack a smile and speak with them.\n\nThen this got me thinking:\n\n- Do we look like we don't tip?\n- Is it a cultural thing?\n- Or is it because I am not your kind?\n\nI know I am implying a racial undertone here but this is what we experienced and witnessed first hand. It's kinda too bad since we did enjoy their food. I'll give them 2 1/2 stars for now and will give them another chance to improve on our return visit. I would rate their food a 4 but the poor service greatly downgraded their rating. I'll give them another chance and only because the food and tea were really good. \n\nTo be continued?", "author": "John G."}

I don't mind it at Pluto's because they know you can see them so no funny business.)\n\nWe ordered a bunch of food off their dated sticky menus and waited patiently for our food. The food soon came and everything was soooooo SHINY! like it was gleaming!!! You need sunglasses to eat this food. SHINY = OILY! Everything I ate left an oil slick down my esophagus and no water in the brown frosted plastic cups can flush it down. \n\nOverall my experience at Kirin was not the best but you can see that this restaurant targets the local crowd who are just lazy to cook at home that night.

My husband and I ordered a large bowl of winter melon soup and the stuffed chicken with sweet rice. A whole chicken should be enough for us, right? WRONG.\n\nThe soup wasn't particularly good - it didn't taste fresh, almost as if it had been made a week ago. The broth was a bit too salty and didn't have the lovely winter melon flavor incorporated into it. We then had to wait what seemed like half an hour for the chicken to come out...\n\nThe dish is basically the skin of a whole chicken that has been fried and stuffed with sticky rice...that's it. Initially, we enjoyed the combination of the crispy fried chicken skin with the warm sticky rice (not sweet rice as it's named). Then after about two pieces, we started to wonder about the chicken meat. There wasn't any chicken in the rice - were they going to bring the meat out separately (like they do with Peking duck)? Nope. You never get the chicken meat! How can they charge $30 for a chicken and not give you any of the meat?! It's absurd. I needed protein...just skin and rice did not to cut it for me. They also skimped on the amount of Chinese sausage in the sticky rice - just a few tiny bits instead of whole slices. No meat, bland, and greasy...never again. Such an unsatisfying meal.\n\n[Note: I probably wouldn't have been as disgruntled about the stuffed chicken had it been one of several dishes instead of my main course, but I still think it's a crime to charge $30 for under-seasoned chicken skin and rice.]", "author": "Karin V."}

The food has always been flavorful and they make the best traditional san francisco cantonese food.  The roast duck yee wonton is fantastic and everything i want (shredded roast duck, fried wonton, canned mushrooms and peas in soup).  Savory, flavorful and gives me memories of my childhood.  I also ordered the curry tomato beef pan fried noodles, perfect!!  A lot of places don't make this correctly b/c they're just cantonese restaurants and i think this is also an SF chinatown kind of dish.  The key is to make the tomato beef first and then add the curry.  I ordered to go and they separated my noodles to keep them crispy.  Sweet, curry, savory with a bit of a kick.  When i've been for dinner the fish salad and pressed chicken with sticky rice is a favorite.  Kirin you never let me down.", "author": "Susan Z."}

My family and I have been coming here for years and years.  I'm not sure what it is about this place, but it seems to be the central hub for Americanized Chinese families seeking a great meal.  While my family is extremely Americanized, Kirin never disappoints on the authenticity of the food.  Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in San Francisco.  \n\nOverall, environment is very clean for a Chinese restaurant.  There are about 8-10 round tables for big parties. and the rest are 4 tops.  \n\nFood is top notch here.  \n-  Winter Melon Soup, the melon is carved whole, and the soup is poured into it.  Very flavorful. Great on a cold day. \n- Cubed Steak with Veggies:   The beef is very tender and the sauce makes the meat extra juicy.  \n- Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings: *Licks lip*  Chicken is very meaty, fried to the perfect crisp-ness, and seasonsed perfectly with salt, pepper and garlic.  Definitely a FAVORITE of mine. \n-  Chicken Stuffed with Sticky Rice:  Can't talk about Kirin without talking about the whole chicken.  A meal all within itself.  The sticky rice is so yummy with Chinese sausage, cabbage, mushrooms, and I believe peanuts?  Love the thin layer of crispy skin on top.  Definitely for-go white rice when ordering this dish. \n\nService here is the best.  All of the servers are very attentive, accomodating, and friendly.  This is the best place to come for big family gatherings and holidays.

Because we have massive families and you can actually take your whole mess o' kids and grandkids to Chinese food without a reservation and get a huge round table at which everyone can be equally scolded and guilted by the patriarch.  \n\nAlso, my grandparents were raised during (aka were defined by, aka couldn't stop talking about, aka were totally scarred by) the Depression, so they weren't going to pay a lot for that muffler.  Kirin is crazy-reasonable, which probably saved us from having our family dinners on the curb in front of a taco truck.\n\nWe started eating at Kirin back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.  Which was about the time we were chased out of our former Chinese place, called Mary's, because my grandfather left a tiny tip and the waiter freaked.  And while I totally agree that the food at Kirin is incredibly tasty and the authenticity deserves mad props, we were really just here because my grandfather could feed all 16 of us for like $40.  So lucky us that the food was excellent as well.  \n\nI still have such a soft spot for this joint and I try to eat here whenever I'm in the neighborhood.

Lean (a lot Chinese Restaurants spareribs have a lot of fat), salty, garlicky, mildly spicy, deep fried goodness... these spareribs practically melt in your mouth.  If you hate everything else on the menu but love the spareribs as I do then Kirin will be worth it.\n\nSomeone else mentioned the Fish Salad which is very good.  The fish always seems fresh, tender, and the salad adds a refreshing sweet, mildly pickled flavor which makes this a great starter.\n\nClams with garlic.  Simple yet delicious.  A platter of clams is served with little mounds of garlic and green onions in the shell... I'm sure there are some other ingredients but I'm not sure what they are, it's good.\n\nI always order pea sprouts whenever I eat Chinese b/c it just has to be that way.  Remember, if there are tons of Chinese people eating at the Chinese restaurant then you probably want to give it a try.  It gets a little packed and they close at 9.  I actually went there with a large party at 8:50 and they served us without any issues.", "author": "Micah W."}

Don't go there if you are looking for \"spicy\" because most Cantonese dishes are more subtle.\n\nWe go there fairly often, whether for large group banquets or just two of us.  Henry, the owner, usually greets you in front.  The waiters are always friendly, especially Sam who, as another reviewer mentioned, speaks English, Cantonese and Spanish.\n\nThe raw fish salad is a Kirin signature dish which is best to order ahead of time by phone if you really want to make sure they have it.  This is a refreshing dish with crunchy textures from crispy noodles and pickled vegetable pieces.\n\nYesterday my wife and son and I had lunch at Kirin.  We ordered the West Lake Beef soup, salt and pepper squid, bitter melon with beef in black bean sauce and Chinese long bean minced with ground pork and mushrooms.  \n\nThe soup is a favorite of my son's.  It has a clear, fresh broth with bits of ground beef and egg whites.  A real comfort food dish.  \n\nKirin's kitchen makes a tasty salt and pepper squid.  Eat it as soon as it is served while the lightly battered squid is still sizzling hot.  And make sure that with each piece of squid you eat a little of the sliced jalapeno and scallion.  Tasty and a little tangy!\n\nIf you have never tried Chinese bitter melon, check it out.  Yes the melon is bitter --but that's OK -- it's not TOO bitter!  And it is a classic Cantonese taste, especially with the black bean sauce.  Kirin also serves the same dish with frog legs instead of beef.  Also very tasty.\n\nMost caucasians probably would overlook the Chinese long bean with mushrooms and pork.  But my Chinese wife spotted it long ago and now it is a favorite of mine.  The beans are cut into pieces about half an inch long and \"chowed\" (stir fried) with the other ingredients.    This bean has a nutty flavor and the texture of the dish is crunchy.\n\nOverall, Kirin is one of most reliable Cantonese restaurants in the Richmond District.  Its menu is vast.  So if you want some advice, ask Henry or Sam for something unusual that you might have overlooked.  There are also the daily \"wo choy\" specials which are often written only in Chinese on the wall.  Ask about those too.  I guarantee  that you will NOT find the usual dishes that non-Chinese people order.\n\nPrices at Kirin are very reasonable. A great place to take out-of-town visitors for a highly varied and tasty meal!  And it's OK to bring your own wine.  The waiters will open it for you and serve in the proper glasses.", "author": "Rich S."}

This place gets very busy on most evenings and I would reccomend reservations if you're going around or on a holiday.\r\n\r\nI've been quite a few times for dinner and once for lunch, most everything was really tasty and their portions are a good size. The dish that is ordered by nearly all the tables is the Rainbow Raw Fish Salad or the chicken version of it. It's a dish comprised of pickled ginger, crunchy bean thread noodles, peanuts, thinly shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, green onions and raw fish or chicken. Very nice light flavor and not too crunchy despite the fried noodles. The other dishes that are popular are the salt and pepper chicken wings, sweet pea sprouts with garlic sauce (really yummy and it's the only all veggie dish that is a chef specialty), clams in black bean sauce, crispy fried whole or half chicken, and any of the whole fish dishes. There are many more popular dishes but this is all I can remember at this point. \r\n\r\nThe day's house soup is automatically served with dinner or lunch. It's usually something very Cantonese like watercress in a pork broth, nothing very heavy. And oranges are served with the delivery of the check along with some fortune cookies. They do offer red bean soup or almond jello (I love almond jello!) but I don't recall if that's on the house or if you're charged for selecting either of those two.\r\n\r\nAll in all I can say that meals here are usually very satisfying and never disappointing.", "author": "cyndi L."}

After reading reviews saying that there Stuffed Chicken with Sweet Rice is the dish of choice i decided to bring my sister and grandma to give it try. After dining i have to say i was greatly disappointed. We ordered the Stuffed Chicken, Steamed Catfish, and a Ong-Choy. The stuffed chicken was not what i expected...the skin of the chicken was suppose to be crispy, but instead it was very chewy with a slight crunch. I've only had this dish a few times in other restaurants, and i remember it having much more chicken meat, but for Kirin, it came with an extremely thin layer of meat (almost like if your lucky you'll get a piece with a bit of chicken, otherwise it is just skin), the chewy skin, and the stuffed rice (which was not bad)...but for $33 this stuffed chicken to me was just not worth it. I understand it might have required a lot of work to prepare it, but i am greatly disappointed in this dish. \n\nThe catfish and Ong-Choy was okay. The catfish did not taste fresh, i'm not sure if they gave us a dead fish or maybe it was overcooked, but the texture is just not what i expected. The Ong-Choy i would say is probably the best dish we had. However, these too dishes were very greasy, but i can't complain because that's usually how Chinese cooking is in restaurants. \n\nI don't write many reviews on yelp, but with this restaurant having an average 4 star rating, i just have to inform others if they plan to give this place a try. The dishes are really overpriced, so you guys can make the decision. \n\nIf you want better Chinese food i recommend Hong Kong Lounge which is a few blocks down on Geary, i've never been disappointed dining there. So yall can make the decision about dining at Kirin, but for the price, i'd rather you go to Hong Kong Lounge and get much better food.", "author": "Harrison C."}

After reading the reviews of the Kirin on yelp, my daughter and I decided to try the place. The menu focuses on Chinese seafood, and if the entrees don't tip you off, look to the back wall where you will see tanks of live fish and lobster.  I wanted a tofu based dish however, so our very helpful waiter told me to try a dish of fried tofu with fresh mushrooms and Chinese broccoli, which I didn't see on the menu. He also recommended a dish of shrimp and scallops with Chinese long beans. Since it was cold outside, we also ordered winter melon soup, which is made from chicken broth and has bits of chopped pork and winter melon, which has a texture like cooked zucchini but is more flavorful. I couldn't resist this savory soup and ended up having two bowls before our main dishes came.  Our opinions were mixed on the latter. The fried tofu with mushrooms and broccoli was delicious, with the broccoli fried just right, not too raw and coarse or overcooked and soggy. The shrimp and scallops with long beans was salty and the beans tough, as if overcooked or picked past their season. The portions were large, and we received rice and tea as part of the meal. We were also offered dessert,  a choice of fruit with almond gelatin squares, or almond cookies. We declined these because we were so stuffed, but what we saw on the trays looked good. For all this food, we spent $35 plus 20 percent tip, as our waiter was exceptionally pleasant and attentive. I would recommend taking the 38 bus on Geary to get here however, as parking is sparse in this neighborhood, especially on a Sunday evening.", "author": "Eleanor T."}
