Ritual is nestled in a corner of the nursery's store. Even tucked away like that, it seems to have a following. Considering the serene location, I imagine people find it to be a nice retreat. there is only a few bar stools in terms of seating, but you can take your coffee into the garden and sip among the succulents and other green things. I wasn't actually looking for something hot. I just wanted something refreshing.The Cherry Bomb hit the bill. It is NOT sweet. It is a fruity, refreshing jolt to the system that will wake you up and put a pep in your step. It's really pretty, too. It even comes with a cherry on top. After your of buying $5 coffee at Starbucks, I didn't bat at eye at the $6 price tag. They also have pretty good cookies too. A bought a nicely packaged bag of thumbprints for a gift. my Mom offered me one later that day,The cookies were just the right size to hold an entire mini peanut butter cup on top. They were a bit of crumbly of crumbly, buttery goodness. if you live strong coffee balance by serene settings and some good people watching try this little slice of awesomeness in Bayview.", "author": "Nicole M."}

You have to be kidding me! \n\nWhen we were visiting our friends in SF, they took us to Flora Grubb Gardens to shop around. Being that I didn't want to spend an arm & a leg on overpriced succulents & plants , I opted to buy a coffee & pastry at Ritual and relax on their back patio.\n\n2 iced coffees & 2 pastries roughly came to $14.00. Yes it's a bit on the pricey side, but when the coffee & pastries are both equally as good, I can't really complain. Their iced coffee is strong & sweet, while their homemade pastries are to die for. Do yourself a favor and order their homemade oreos - we easily could have eaten 5 of these. Their salted chocolate chip cookie was also decadent. \n\nThis place is a hipsters, DIY-er's, coffee lovers dream.

Ok, I might be projecting, but if you like caffeine, baked goods or so much beauty in the plant world your eyes will become fatigued, get to this place asap. Your urban soul will be restored.\n\nI almost maxed out my iPhone taking so many photos. Yes, I was one of those hipster annoyances wandering around and crouching over leaves and lawn furniture to get the perfect shot of flowers or brightly-painted tables in a tropical palette of colors or a fly with a glimmering green body. \n\nSit in the pricey furniture and relax. Standouts are a couple very ergonomic, curved benches (Helios \"lounge\" and \"love chair\" by Galanter & Jones) that might be turned on to heat your bum on your visit. I would buy the heck out of that lounge if I had an extra $7,900 but I am not sure my butt is worthy. \n\nFeasting your eyes on all this beauty is free though, and the plants are gorgeous, healthy, and reasonably priced.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, from the barista to the guys working to take care of the plants. \n\nGrumpy cat: There is also a bona fide grumpy cat, not identical in appearance to the famous cat, but she definitely does NOT want you to pet her. She will look at you with distaste and then cast her eyes to worthier views like the coffee bar. Bask in her scorn then go find yourself a plant to pet instead.", "author": "Sarah J."}

I began by asking the barista if they had some cold brewed coffee, and if so what coffee beans they used for the drink. I asked because I like to know what I'm drinking and what to expect. While I don't consider myself a coffee expert, I roast my own coffee at home so I knew a thing or two.\n\nHe couldn't quite tell me what the beans were, which was fine with me, but the following wasn't. After inquiring about the beans, I then ask about the tasting notes I should expect. He snickered and rolled his eyes at me. Condescendingly, he says that I won't be able to tell the taste notes and it would just taste chocolatey, but not smokey. He sort of just becomes dismissive of us after that so that was not cool. We just hurriedly ordered and tried to my best not to talk to this fellow anymore.\n\nWhile waiting for the drinks, a little kid got into an accident resulting in a head wound. His dad goes up to the barista and asks for wet paper towels, but he only gives him one towel! The dad and other people eager to help had to keep asking for more towels repeatedly before he gave more. It was so bad.\n\nThe place and decor was nice as it was located in a nursery, but the service was not good. We got our drink and got away ASAP. \n\nThis post got two stars solely for their coffee.", "author": "Mark R."}

What to do if you are a big old coffee snob (as I am) but ever so slightly misanthropic and cranky on your best day (me again)? Direct yourself over to Flora Grubb Gardens and order a Gibraltar at the cuter-than-lace-pants Ritual II in the beautiful Bayview.\n\n[[SF/X: Cutting Crew - I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight]]\n\nFlora Grubb Gardens can be someone else's First review, but I salivated at the prospect of Yelping a new Ritual. Suffice to say FGG is a dreamy, upscale garden supply for the Sunset magazine set. Flora and all the little Grubb's wisely decided they wanted a mini-Ritual kiosk in their fancy new location. Good move. \n\nIt winds up being the best way to experience Ritual's sublime beverages. You step up to the counter (likely no waiting), get your magnificent drink, look at a palm, frond or what have you and just try being a Grumpy Gus. The barista is all fat and happy because they don't have to deal with a line of demanding, nickel-tipping piss-ants out the door, you're happy because you're surrounded by various cacti and natural lighting. Sah-weet! \n\nBits of Useful business: You can buy a bromeliad at the gardens part that will blow your mind for about $75. But if you kill the bromeliad, you are a bad person, because it is beautiful to look at. Bromeliads (or Bromeliaceae) are a large flowering plant related to pineapple. Fresh, Ritual-roasted coffee beans are available by the pound (A/Q). They'll do the job no questions asked. Also, there's a Taco Bell on the corner.\n\nBits of Funny business: They sell hoes in the garden part too. Quality hoes. For about $20 you can get a Hand Hoe. It's one superior hoe, and I should know. Hopefully they'll get a greater selection of hoes. When it comes to hoes, I'm pretty particular.\n\nBits of Cool business: The day I went here, Natalie Portman browsed the garden center. As an Unofficial Ambassador Of S.F., when she demanded my service a'la sexy behind the potting shed, I was only too happy to oblige.\n\n...and scene! Anyhow, you know that annoying thing Yelpers do when they squat on a review for a place they haven't been yet? I did that here. It follows below, my dirty little un-secret.

I mean, after all, this is RITUAL, people!!! Well, there were other peeps shopping in the space for garden supplies, but let's just say there was no line out the door :) \n\nI went to their website beforehand and printed out a nifty little buy-one, get-one-free promotional drink coupon...and seeing how my bf is a little tight on some ends these days (so to speak), we just might come back with another coupon in tow, for that very reason, if nothing else!!!", "author": "Shannon R."}

Yesterday I was invited for a cuppa at Ritual Gardens and I saw coffee nirvana. A small counter ensconced within the Flora Grubb Gardens nursery I sat and waited for a friend. Meandering around one of the most beautiful nurseries I've ever seen, I wondered at the wide selection and the taste of the shop owner. As my friend arrived we sat at the counter on a couple of beautiful, heavy, hand-made stools. The gal behind the counter offered us a menu of six different types of beans. We made our selection and she went to work brewing our cups on the Clover device. Now, if you haven't had a cup of coffee prepared on a Clover you're in for a treat. The flavor of the fresh beans came through like I'd never experienced. (I immediately investigated one of these devices for my home but at $11K it was a bit too pricey.)\n\nNeedless to say, this was perfection for a lazy Sunday morning cup of Joe...especially if you plan to do a little gardening.

Absolutely hands down.\n\nFirst time I went in to this location was about the time my gf and I  moved to the next block down. I was excited to have good coffee so nearby. The woman working at that time was terse and didn't seem super excited that I was interrupting her from her conversation with whomever was sitting at the bar. However, she proceeded to make me the BEST americano (I have only ever ordered tea or regular coffee when I have visited the Valencia Street location) I have EVER had. This americano was so good that I, a person who sips coffee until its cold, had finished my drink before even arriving home...a short two minute walk to the next block!\nSince then I've been hooked (though I wasn't super excited about possibly running in to the unfriendly barista on my return trip). Thankfully, Ms. Unfriendly was only there one other day and since then they've had a great, friendly staff working. I'm not sure of everyone's names but they've all been great to talk to, informative about the different coffees they have and just a fun way to start my day. \n\nMy favorite coffee served in an oasis of beautiful plants and succulents just a few hundred feet from my house....who could ask for anything more?\n\nAmendment: Aaron and Maria and AWESOME!

The coffee here is the same as at the mother institution on Valencia, with the added perk of a line and crowd free atmosphere. On a sunny afternoon we happened upon this quiet coffee cart, run by a single barrista who was probably bored out of his mind and excited by the site of coffee craving customers. He happily chatted our ears off while preparing our drinks, distracting me so much that I didn't realize that I probably ordered the most expensive soy latte in the history of soy lattes. Yes, I paid a whopping $4.15 for a 10 oz serving of caffeinated bliss. The milk froth pattern I'll admit was superbly executed- far better than at Valencia's shop. My friends ordered an assortment of of other coffees, the special being a \"clover\" which is a special process of making coffee whereby each batch is extremely standardized in brewing temperature etc. I will overlook the sky high price and give this shop a favorable rating for three reasons. 1.) The barrista was so kind he punched 5 holes in my \"heavy drinker\" card which allows you a free coffee after 10 punches.\n2.) We had the pleasure of drinking our over priced beverages in a charming garden setting, complete with trickling fountains and leafy palms.\n3.)
