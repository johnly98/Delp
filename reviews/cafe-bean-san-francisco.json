{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-31", "description": "Believe me...I REALLY wanted to enjoy this spot! I turned to Yelp to find a local, neighborhood cafe that wasn't your typical tourist joint- and with all of the great reviews, I thought this place would be a shoe-in. Sad to say, it wasn't so.\n\nPerhaps you need to be a regular to truly appreciate this place. My experience was BLEH! It was messy beyond messy and didn't feel clean at all. I don't know if the place is undergoing some redesign/interior decorating changes- but it looks like hoarders have come in and settled in 1/2 of the dining area....oh and there was a ladder sitting in front portion of the sitting area. WEIRD!  Large food, drink and chip boxes sitting and balancing upon each other, old magazines and paper piled high, junk stacked upon junk. Serious clutter everywhere! They MUST be doing some serious spring cleaning....in the midst of winter, while all their guests pardon their literal dust.\n\n\nAs far as the food: I wondered if they even had a full kitchen in back. Our food tasted microwaved and \"toaster oven'd\".  In short- the food was nothing to brag about. I ordered:\n\nChai Tea Latte- Must have been from a flavor packet. When I took my first few sips- I would get random \"crunches/crumbs\" in my mouth- perhaps the owner/manager didn't stir the packet in to dissolve the powder?? I dunno....but gross!\n\nMy Nutella and Banana French toast was luke warm, toaster oven crunchy, and didn't taste like FRESH french toast. It LOOKED delicious when the gent delivered to the table though!\n\nDaniel's Omelet- the egg look like a scrambled egg mix that came fresh out of the microwave! It was perfect in shape, rubber texture and color. The soggy veggies inside were par for the omelet course- and the dish came out steaming and overly piping hot. Not complaining about the temperature- but further made me think it just came out of the microwave. \n\nThe owner/manager was nice enough. Not rude- but certainly not pleasant, perhaps because he didn't know us- and we weren't regulars. Customer service doesn't appear to be their forte. A kind smile and thank you can go a long way in the service industry. It appears that he didn't care- didn't care about our experience or about the way his place looked. A little bit of pride in their service can really help this place out.\n\nAll things considered, I may go back again in a couple months once the assumed spring cleaning and redecor takes place. It's very hodge-podgy and it appears the cafe is having an identity crisis....but perhaps that what gives it an artsy appeal. Vintage decor, some random \"european\" decor, random sports paraphernalia,  dated things/pictures randomly taped around the place.  Hey anything can be called \"art\"..... right? \n\nSo many reviews talk about how wonderful the food and menu is here.... I'm hoping it was just an off day!", "author": "Sophie P."}

The one (the less expensive one) is hung over the bar, so its where one would look when ordering.  It is also permanent text printed out and framed. The second price list  (the more expensive) is a white board, hung on the far back wall.  I noticed that my total bill was more than the more prominent price listing, and the owner told me that the white board prices are the current prices, but he hasn't \"had time\" yet to take down the list hung directly above the bar. \n\nFinally, I'm a dog owner, but there's a bit of a yuck factor when there's random dogs inside of a cafe. Not only does the owner not mind people bringing in their pets, but I saw him once pet a dog and then directly go to serving people. Want some dog hair with your muffin? \n\nDespite the fact that I've returned a few times for convenience, I'm done with this cafe.", "author": "Rachel F."}

(and i am coffee snob)  my husband used to live in San Francisco and when I went to SF for a visit, one of the first places he took me to was here.  I had no idea what to get so he ordered his favorite: large cafe mocha and an \"everything\" bagel sandwich with creme cheese, tomato, avocado and onion.  And. I. Was. Hooked.  it was super deelish!  Every time I went to San Francisco, i made it a point to stop here for my coffee fix at least a few times!

That's the impression I have of this place.\n\nLet me back up: I guess I should start out by saying the food is decent, ambiance is comfy, and that my first experience there was all-around pretty satisfying.  I was ready to recommend this spot to all my wayward friends traveling through SF.\n\nSo I did recommend the place: to my parents, who went there for breakfast the next day.  Now, I'm not sure if the owner/cashier is a moody guy, or if he hates tourists (we're from the South Bay, but....whatever), or if he hates older people (which is what I suspect, seeing how my 26-year old self received amazing service), but from the story my folks gave me, he was incredibly rude this time around.  \n\nRight off the bat, my dad requested an internet code when he placed his order.  The guy would not give it to him, claiming he'd been there before and should have still had it.  The man flashed the code in front my dad for a second and then put it away.  My dad is a shy guy and won't question people, so he didn't challenge the owner--he just kept his laptop in his bag, even though that was the point of heading to the cafe.  He never even got on the internet.\n\nAfter receiving their food, my parents, who are both in their sixties, asked if it'd be all right to move to a more spacious table that had just been vacated.  The worker/cashier/owner (?) gave them a terse \"I'm bussing this\" and continued.  \n\nThat's pretty much the main theme of this review: my parents got major attitude here.  My dad said he even tried to compliment that guy on the cafe, saying it was \"reallly nice, great location, great menu.\"  The owner said, and I quote, \"yeah.\"\n\nHe even interrupted their meal to tell them that they'd have to move if another customer came in.\n\nIt's strange to me, having been there just the previous day and having had such a different experience.  I even saw that same owner aiding a young pair of travelers with their route down to Los Angeles.  Maybe he was in a bad mood today?  Or maybe it's something else?...\n\nIt shouldn't matter if you're young, old, a tourist, a local, or what -- you should be treated with some decency if you're gracing an establishment with your business.  In fact, you really should be treated better than decent.  My parents won't be returning to Cafe Bean.  Neither will I.", "author": "Cat T."}

The decor is quite nice but the customer service here is pretty darn crappy!\n\n- The cafe mocha I ordered a bit watery\n- I needed to use the bathroom so I walked over and saw that I didn't need a key so I went inside. I heard some kind of noise but didn't pay much attention to it. While I did my business in a span of 3 minutes I finally realize that the noise was from the sink. It was on and water was filling into a bucket. Then I heard a knock and then a series of very angry knocks on the door in less than a minute. I thought it was some kind of emergency so I opened the door before I got to wash my hands. There was this lady who then yelled at me saying, \"Why would I go into the bathroom if I saw the sink was running?\" I didn't want to argue so I walked away very pissed off. If I saw that then I wouldn't have used the bathroom and I would have needed to wash my hands after I was done so I would have turned off the sink eventually. And why would you use the sink in the bathroom to run errands for the cafe? A bit unsanitary don't you think?  \n\nShe didn't even apologize and even complained really loudly after I left the bathroom. I was a customer and she treated me like I was in her home disturbing her routine.", "author": "Sarah C."}

The first time we came here, my husband and I shared the lox plate and a cinnamon apple dutch pancake.  He got a white chocolate mocha and I asked for a latte with extra foam.  Everything was perfect, and the guy who made my latte really knows how to make good foam.  The dutch pancake was so good that we went back the very next day for another one.  They're a little more substantial than crepes and lighter than pancakes.  Cooked so they're crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Perfect.  The next time we went I switched it up a bit and got an omelet, thinking it couldn't possibly be as good as the pancakes but it sounded so good I had to try it - I was wrong, it was AMAZING.  I didn't know an omelet could be so delicious.  I got the Daniels omelet I think.  The next time we went my husband got an herb brie veggie sandwich (don't quote me on the cheese, it might not have been brie but it was something like it) and a caramel latte.  I got a turkey sandwich, again not expecting much but was floored by how tasty a simple meal could be.  They have a decent beer selection and a few on tap, but we've never tried them.

Great omelettes, etc.  And on a warm sunny day you can sit on the sidewalk and take in the street view.  Highly recommend it!", "author": "Laura K."}

This is a cafe i come hang out at, not because of great food or great coffee but more for the atmosphere and the mood it puts me it. It has a certain warmth and very uplifting quality about it, reminds me of a cafe in italy. The thousands of photos plastered on the tables and european decorations on the wall takes me to a totally different place when i'm there. They also offer WI-FI for the cyber surfers. Anyhow, that's not to say that their food isn't good either. The dutch crepes and coffee are good, though not the best. It's simply a great hang out.", "author": "benjamin c."}

One star for the window seat and one star for the nice girl who took my orders until I couldn't take the bad attitude from the Owner/Manager anymore.  I was looking for a cozy neighborhood place to read the weekly and have breakfast on my days off and gave this place a try. After a couple of times going there, they decided to confuse me by taking my order but asking me to pay AFTER I ate. Ok, so I went to my window seat, ate my breakfast, read the paper and drank my coffee... and then I left. It's a habit at a coffee shop to leave when you're done, right? So this young kid who works there chased me down the street and I came back  to pay the bill apologizing all the way. When I walked in the door, blushing and holding my cash out in front of me, that Owner/Manager whatever guy was giving me this mean cold stare and shaking his head. He really thought I did it on purpose. I tried to make a joke and get the guy to lighten up but he just continued to mad-dog me. And from then on, I asked if I could go ahead and pay before hand trying to put the incident behind me. After a few more bad experiences with that same guy, the last time I went I was waiting to order, they were pretty busy, the busser/kitchen guy was running around clearing plates, etc. and that Owner/Manager was bringing out food. He angrily told the busser to \"Get OUT of the WAY\" and rudely pushed past him and that was just the end for me. I walked out and will never go back.", "author": "Chris A."}
