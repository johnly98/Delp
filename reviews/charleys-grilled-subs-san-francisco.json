The idea of eating an additive-filled, greasy, heart-stopping, artery-clogging sandwich for lunch every day does not sound healthy. Quite the opposite.\n\nI typically bring a healthy, home-cooked lunch into work every day. However on the occasional Friday I will treat myself to a small original cheesesteak from Charley's. \n\nThe sandwich is so delicious. I crave one every so often when I want to indulge in something so fattening but delicious. The bread is toasted yet warm and soft, the steak is flavorful and thin, the peppers are onions are cooked well, and the lettuce and tomato combined with the mayo and the juice from the meat is heavenly. The first bite is always the best one. I only order a small, otherwise I will feel guilty about eating a large sandwich that's so bad for you.\n\nIs this unhealthy? Yes\nIs it inside the mall food court? Yes\nWill it cause acne breakouts and short-term digestion issues? Probably\nIs it delicious and worth it? Hell yeah\n\nThis is my guilty pleasure and I encourage you to make it yours as well. \nLong live Charley's!", "author": "Taylor M."}

Disappointingly, these fall under the sad subs because of how they come out--soggy, falling apart, and leaving you in a state of \"Where is the meat on this sub?\" For the price I paid, it is a bit disappointing when there are Subways around where I could have had a slightly-less sad sub.\n\nLearning my lesson from this, maybe this place isn't for me. If you're in the mood for subs, Subway will give a better bang for your buck and at least you can see them fill it up so you can complain if they're being frugal with the ingredients. I'll be sticking to the other locations in the food court.", "author": "Renneth D."}

There wasn't many vegetarian options, and with the adrenaline rush of the crowds, I wasn't as hungry as I had hoped. My boyfriend settled on Charley's since he's tried it on multiple occasions. He ordered an Italian sub with French fries, and last minute- I found a veggie delite! Which, ended up being my order.\n\nThe Veggie Delite was a sub with mushrooms, onions, cheese, lettuce , and tomato. The sandwich was toasted and very reminiscent to the Firehouse Subs sandwich, of the same ingredients. I ordered a small, with their lemonade, and a side of original French fries. If you love cheese fries, Charley's is very generous with their cheese, but I will admit it's nothing I would try again.\nThe sandwich was cooked to perfection, and their bread was served open flat, in case any topping were to be added- or , in case you wanted to remove something easily. :)\nIt was a cool delivery and made it easier to enjoy too!\nThe line wasn't long when we dropped by, but everyone flocked towards it within minutes of lunch time beginning.  We received our food within 7 minutes, no more than that, but mind you- we were the first in line too! \nThe food court is busy and there isn't a lot of seating, but thankfully we received our food quickly enough so we had more time to look.\nThe food court is very humid, but it could be due to the population, or lack of A/C so it would be my best advice to take your food to go and eat at the local park! \n\nOverall, Charley's was an awesome,filling, sandwich which is perfect if you are planning to venture around the city on foot and looking for a hot sub to keep your energy up!", "author": "Fran R."}

This place is so goooood! Try the chicken California. This is the one they hand out as samples all the time so it must be what they think is best. All it is is chicken, provolone, ranch and lettuce and tomatoes, if you want. Nothing special at all, but some how this sandwich is amazing. It must be their bread and the ranch. Probably the ranch. That being said, a small (5\"?) sub is a whopping 440 calories. I wasn't even aware there was such thing as an unhealthy chicken sandwich.", "author": "Patricia K."}

Having actually had decent cheesesteaks in San Francisco, like Theo's, I was predisposed to testing out Charley's for a quick pre-movie bite.   Clearly, Charley should get some advice from Theo!\n\nPhilly Cheesesteak:  Had to get the signature dish in its pure form for a proper benchmark.  I knew better than to get the lettuce, tomato, green peppers and mayo.  However, I did add-on jalape\u00f1os to simulate hots and some pickles because I like pickles.  Was rather disappointed that they used sliced cheese when the Cheez Whiz like substance was obviously available for the cheese fries.  I found the roll not chewy enough and definitely had too high of a bread-to-meat ratio.  The cheese was segmented on the top most portion of the meat, thus bypassing the typical melted throughout sensation.  This cheese misalignment also made  the meat feel dry.  Was unimpressed overall.\n\nFries: Smaller than a steak fry, but thicker than McDonald's.  Could have been crunchier.  Definitely wasn't enticing enough to have me gorging.", "author": "Adam B."}

This location originally housed David's Cookies and later a gourmet hot dog vendor before morphing into this brightly lit stand.  My friend wanted to try this as a change of pace from the regular spots (Sorabol, Firewood, and Andale).  I tried the Philly Steak deluxe which includes green pepper, grilled onions, and mushrooms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jM6AUHoTEVIeZ6P8WXUDhw?select=XRL8qsFa27MBJL4TC9cM7g).  The green pepper's flavor was dominant in this sandwich.  We shared the cheddar and bacon fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jM6AUHoTEVIeZ6P8WXUDhw?select=bCXCzivLomE_88t1MzjofA), which were just okay as the fries were on the soft side.  The lemonade was tastily sweet, more of a lemon drink than 'ade.  They emphasize that their bread is freshly baked and that the chain was born in Columbus, Ohio near the local university.  \nWith the diminishing Quizno's locations, it's nice to have a hot sandwich choice downtown.  However, don't compare this to Ike's or Deli Board, because it is still a chain store.", "author": "Mike C."}

I have gone to Charlie's a few times because everything else in the shopping center is Asian food (there's a vegan Asian place, a Thai place, a Korean place, three Japanese places and a panda express, so if you want extremely sweet, sugary, stirfried oily noodles, you have options galore) and all the other food vendors (except for Buckhorn) are horrible so the first time I went to Charley's, I ordered from the cashier, her name is Mary Rose, she's always working when I'm at Westfield, and when I presented her with my student ID card, that gets me a 10% discount at all of the mall food court restaurants, she said they don't give a discount for students, they only give a discount for employees of the mall. So I asked her to check with the boss because SFSU tells night students to be sure to get an ID card so that they can get the crappy mall food for a little bit cheaper somce we r there at dinner time. So in front of me she asks, very unenthusiastically, her boss whether they give a student discount and her boss answers her before she can even finish the word discount and he says \"yes we do,10%\" she looked embarrassed, apologized and gave us the discount.  The following time, when I parented the student discount card again, she said \"we don't give student discounts, we only give a discount for employees, but I'll just do that for you this one time.\" I was about to remind her that she had verified the student discount policy in front of me the last time I was there, but just decided to leave well enough alone and just say thanks.  So tonight I went back and when I went up to the counter she was standing a few feet away sweeping. She looked up at me and said \"...YYEEESSS???\" So I said \"oh are you closed?\" And she said \".....no?\" then just stared at me. I decided that I was done with her weird attitude and haggling over a 10% discount so I just went somewhere else. I won't be returning. Oh but if u do go, definitely ask for no mayo. Trust.

It wasn't until about 25 minutes later, I kid you not. 25 minutes later, that they realized that our drink had not been made.\n\nWhen the drink was finally made, it was made in about less than a minute, which is respectable. The man at the cashier promptly apologized for taking so long but he did not actually know what drink we ordered and gave me the wrong drink. I showed him the receipt and he promptly made the drink again, this time without any ice. He gave me some fries for free which I respect him trying to make up for his mistake. I brought the drink to my lady friend who was now very upset that it had taken half an hour. When I came back to get a cup of ice, the man told me they were low on ice. I told him the drink you had just given me after half an hour had no ice. He gave me a look as if I was the one who was in the wrong. He gave me a scoop of ice about as big as a 6 oz cup and most of it was water. \n\nOverall.\n-Incredibly slow service\n-Mix of apologetic/Non-caring staff\n-30 minute wait for a drink\n-Forgot our order\n-Wrong drink \n-Right drink with no ice\n\n+Free fries\n\n\nOh and you guys made my lady friend cry.

We usually are regulars at Buckhorn Grill, Couriander, and Bistro Burger but this time around, we decided to check out the new spot in the corner. \n\nAt first glance, this place looks cool and appealing. We sampled a piece of the California Chicken Sandwich near the cashier and it was delicious. From this, we decided to eat here. There's a variety of sandwiches available to choose from that come in 7\" or 12\" rolls. I'm a fan of the traditional philly cheesesteak so I ordered a 12\" philly cheesesteak and a gourmet side fries, cheddar bacon style, hoping to be ordering something similar to that of Aussie fries from Outback. My girlfriend opted for the chicken teriyaki sandwich when her turn came.\n\nWhile waiting, I noticed an employee adding cheese to some French fries and handing it down to the next worker who added bits of bacon. It was then that I realized those were our cheddar bacon fries. Sadly, the cheddar being used was actually Macho cheese cheddar, not legit melted cheddar.\n\nThe quality of taste was very distinct in the fries when we finally got our order. The cheese tasted like melted nacho cheese, a very unpleasant taste in my opinion. The bacon was alright, but cold and overwhelming to my girlfriend who refused TL eat such bacon. Our sandwiches were a bit better. Although heavily filled with lettuce, we found the meat by gradually munching through the sandwich. The meat was thoroughly cooked and I could only taste a little provologne as I felt they were somewhat stingy with the cheese. Despite these small flaws, I downed the rest of the 12\" sandwich down my throat and was satisfied. \n\nCharley's is more of a Great Steak sandwhich shop and way below that of the Cheesesteak Shop. Improvements can be made but its good enough to have for lunch a day where your feeling a sandwhich. But be wary of the nacho cheese doused cheddar bacon fries, because thats just not cool. Classic melted cheddar slices would do just fine. \n\nThese false Aussie fries aside, the sandwiches taste good, but lack the authenticity or flavor as places such as Buckhorn or the Cheesesteak shop would have.

While most Philly Cheesesteaks are comprised of either provolone cheese or a cheese \"whiz\" of some variety, Charley's uses a white cheddar that looks like it came \"fresh\" from the individualized Kraft plastic wrappers.\n\nThe only positive was the bread, which seemed like it was a bit more fresh... only because it tasted like it wasn't fully cooked.\n\nStay away from this place as you will only leave hungry, and wishing you would have spent your hard earned money elsewhere.\n\nIt was so bad that it's actually what convinced me to join Yelp, just to write the above review.", "author": "Tyler B."}

My friend and I decided to try this place after a long shopping trip. \nThere was a pretty big selection of different sandwiches. We got the Philly Chicken and the Chicken California! Personally, I thought the best was the Chicken California. But that could just be because I'm a ranch lover. \nNeither sub was terrible though, and it really filled me up!\nThe subs were kind of expensive though, if you considered what you got for the price, but not SUPER expensive.\nAnyways, for a location in a mall, it was pretty good!", "author": "Ashley N."}

Their Italian is really good.\n\nIt can be a bit of a hassle getting anything during the lunch the crowd, but that can happen at any place. So far I've had no trouble getting in and out at reasonable time.\n\nThe big bonuses for me is their combos and their lemonades. Their original combo (that includes a drink and regular fries) is only 3 bucks more. Their gourmet combo is 4, but that allows you to have a choice of any of their gourmet fries and can add a speciality lemonade.\n\nSpeaking of their specialty lemonades, they are the most yummies I've ever had. You can choose from having strawberry, peach, or blueberry. They use real fruit to infuse their drinks and it comes in a large cup.\n\nThe most I've spent getting a small sandwich (which is quite filling), the gourmet combo w/speciality lemonade, was $10.88.\n\nNot a bad way to have lunch and it always smells great when someone brings it into the office,  even though that's kinda cruel.", "author": "Rachel N."}

However, make sure you ask for light ice, as they over fill it and it becomes really watery if you let it sit. . . And ask AS you order, not after because the workers give you attitude (it's not difficult to pour out ice and isn't costly). \nI enjoy their samples, they're they biggest out of all the food places in the food court.", "author": "Emerald I."}

They told me that they are 1:1, but after I ordered a \"small\" it turned out to be smaller than in the picture (same length, but the bread was narrower). A thin layer of meat only covered about half of the bread, half of the meat was covered with a thin layer of melted cheese, two thin half slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce - that was it. There were not many fries, some had either burn marks or were soggy. Wow!\n\nI was hungry again after about an hour. That was my first and last time eating at Charley's.

There were also sooo many people coming just to order lemonade.  One would think that's a good sign, but no...\n\nThe peach lemonade was very disappointing, which is sad because it had a lot of potential.  Disappoint number one, there was way to much ice, which made the drink very watered down.  Disappoint number two, there wasn't enough peach flavoring.  There wasn't even a strong lemonade flavor!  And for lemonade I like to feel like I'm drinking lemonade.  \n\nIf you decide to get lemonade here, I would recommend asking for little or no ice.  I think that would easily solve the entire flavor issue.  It also could've been a bad day for me to get lemonade.  For one lemonade it was about $3.25, including tax.", "author": "Samantha S."}

SFSU's downtown campus is located in the mall, and as such students and staff of SFSU get a discount in most food places in the mall. However, this place is one of the exceptions. Lame.\n\nI ordered a philly cheesesteak combo, and I was not impressed. It was mostly bread, lettuce and tomato with not a whole lot of meat. The taste was ok, but nothing spectacular. The fries were good, but it wasn't a whole lot for the order.\n\nAll in all I spent about $12 for a mediocre sandwich, which was mostly bread, a small order of fries, and a lot of Diet Coke (thank God for free refills.) Disappointing because I can go to Buckhorn Grill, a few stalls away, and get a huge sandwich (loaded with meat), a bigger portion of fries, and a lot of Diet Coke (free refills too) for about $10 using my SFSU discount.", "author": "Tonichi L."}

It was expensive being that it's a fast food place.

The fries were okay the lemonade was way too sweet for my liking. \n\nOverall: \n\nI'll give this place 1star. \n\nMy advice for this place is for the manager to have more people working. The wait for the food is crazy 6-10 mins is crazy for a wait time. And if they are going to have someone finish off the sandwhich please make sure it's someone who knows what they are doing.

I ordered food to go a few days ago for three people and  the toppings were all wrong.  I told the cashier what toppings I wanted in each sandwich. Since I ordered to go i expected it to be correct but when I got home the sandwiches were not labeled so i had to open them all to figure out what was what. Than one sandwich had all the toppings I did not want  and the other two sandwiches did not have the toppings i requested. If the sandwich makers are not going to follow  peoples sandwich toppings choices  than they should not offer it. If I had ordered that food to eat at the mall I would have caught their  errors.  On the bright side they do have a sandwich member card where you get a free sandwich after a certain amount of sandwiches.", "author": "Guadalupe G."}

Being that the fries and drink were nearly $5 extra, I expected a huge portion. The sandwich was a good size for a small and was delicious...tender slices of steak with no gristle. I also asked for no mayo and glad I did because the melted cheese inside was more than enough. The fries though were a big disappointment. Perfectly cooked fries, but for $4-$5 extra (small order), I was surprised to see how meager  the cheese and bacon were added. Perhaps two squirts of cheese and I counted exactly eight bacon bits.
