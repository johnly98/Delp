It started off with me asking if he had a phone charger available behind the bar. He first said I could use it when another phone that was plugged in had a little more juice. About half an hour later I asked him if it was ready and he blew up, started lecturing me about how \"that's not a service bars have to give to you\" as if I was acting entitled to it when I was really trying my best not to pester him. This resulted in an argument. \n\n We went to a different bar and the bartender said \"sure no problem!\" and plugged my phone right in. \n\nThe whole episode was totally unnecessary. It's no surprise other reviews on here complain about their customer service. \n\nWe were the only gay couple in the bar. I can't help but wonder if that had something to do with this.

Now this is quickly replaced by the swimming thought that what you're eating is pretty awesome, dude, but probably not fast enough for me who has suffered the slings and arrows of bad nachos, stale chips and cold weenies. That was a long-winded way of stating that Blondie's doesn't serve food with their drinks. They don't have to because they serve lots of martinis, lots and lots of 16-ounce martinis, even though Jamie W. and I end up ordering the same two kinds every time we come here.\n\nY'see, we've been in love with Shade in Greenwich Village because they serve amazing cappuccino and espesso martinis (review: http://bit.ly/1Uo0zAV). In fact, we just had them again a couple of weeks ago on our annual pilgrimage to NYC. Jamie read about the Almond Mocha Martini served here, so we made a bee-line over here one Saturday afternoon to find the place not too crowded. People gather mostly on the mini-outdoor terrace to watch and be seen, I imagine. We prefer one of the three small booths inside where we can drink like we were in a 1950's movie where Elizabeth Taylor splashes her martini in her leading man's face and walks out carrying her sable coat like a well-used laundry bag.\n\nWe tried the Almond Mocha and really became obsessed with it. Who wouldn't with espresso vodka, creme de cacao, Absolute vanilla and frangelico all in a classic glass dusted with a chocolate rim (photo: http://bit.ly/1sAoC4X)? And like it was a milkshake at an old-fashioned soda fountain, you get the excess amount in a separate glass to keep your drunk on. We alternated that with the Chocolate Mint Kiss Martini that doesn't have the espresso vodka but does give you a Hershey's kiss on a toothpick (photo: http://bit.ly/1UtsKu7). That was delicious as well, though it does bother me a bit that the liquid in both drinks don't look chocolatey, just clear. OK, it doesn't bother me that much since I keep coming back.\n\nDRINKS - 4 stars...doesn't give Shade shade but they are tasty treats on a lazy weekend\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...just a standard bar among the throngs of hipsters that come in and out like the tide\nSERVICE - 4 stars...never had a bad martini here \nTOTAL - 4 stars...our go-to for martinis and not letting ourselves hold back", "author": "Ed U."}

And while the neighborhood has changed a lot in that time, I'm happy to report that Blondie's remains the same.\n\nSo what exactly is it? It's kind of a cheesy, divey martini bar (they have at least 25 gin/vodka concoctions on the menu) with a 90s/early 2000s decor/vibe. The drinks here are served in your larger-than-usual martini glasses, and the bartenders pour with a heavy hand. So if you're not careful or if you're a lightweight, you could get tanked pretty easily after just one libation. I had some sort of gin martini with a splash of Cointreau. It really hit the spot and gave me a nice buzz for the night. Nowadays, most bars in SF are serving $12- $15 cocktails (and they're pretty skimpy) At least at Blondie's, you are getting your $12 worth of booze and then some!\n\nAfter a certain hour (I'm guess 9pm or 10pm), the place turns into a dance club. But I left before that happened (because I'm old and I live in the suburbs). I'm sure it's a fun time for the young, techy, hipster clientele.\n\nAll in all, Blondie's continues to be a fun watering hole. Be warned though: it's cash only here.

Blondie's reminds me of the type of spot I think my college-self would have loved. \"$12.50 for a martini and a side car, like a two for one deal???\" But, alas, this did not do it for me. Between the awkward dance floor in the back, dim lit leather booth and a overpowering musky smell, Blondie's was a miss in my book. \nI first read about Blondie's and the infamous sidecar massive martinis awhile ago and have been wanting to check out since.  Came here on a Friday night for some much needed after work strong martinis with my fiance.  The martini menu is pretty expansive, nothing crazy but mostly some sweet concoction of lemon, lime, and various mixers.  I went for a gin martini with lime and bitters. yuck. This huge drink was a struggle to get down. Maybe my mistake for ordering it but not sure why this drink is even on the menu, it is an odd balance of tart and bitter and just did not do it for me.  \nPossibly I would go to Blondies again, but I think for 12.50 I could go to other bars in the area, pay the same amount and get a well balanced delicious cocktail, no sidecar necessary.", "author": "Kelsey B."}

The Dagwood is a martini with every kind of garnish, including about 7 kind of olive, peril onion. a green bean, and an asparagus.  \n\nThe martinis are made in a pint glass, filled to the top, shaken and then pours as much as they can in a martini glass, followed by handing you the rest of the martini left in the pint glass.  So you roughly get 2.5 martinis for one price.  It is roughly $14 for one martini.  \n\nThe Dagwood is suppose to be a gin martini, but you can ask them to substitute the gin for vodka (that's what I did).  They have a HUGE menu on a chalk board above the bar with all their martinis.  They do a lot of gin and vodka martinis, and then secondly they do some sweet/girly martinis,  However their sweet/girl drinks are just as strong as the regular martinis.  My other favorite here is the Deep Blue Funk.  It really does taste like a Blueberry Freezie Pop.  Yum!\n\nThe best time to go, really depends on your preference.  If you looking for a chill/quiet place place to grab a drink with friend/date, then come anytime before 10:00pm.  If your looking for that crowded bar scene, then come here after 10:00pm on a Friday or Saturday.\n\nLastly, Bring Cash.  This is a Cash ONLY Bar.

In fact, a federal judge in San Francisco agreed that they have the right to manipulate data aka set lower scores as a selling point for business owners looking to improve ratings. \n\nI have a feeling they borrowed this business model from drug cartels taxing businesses for protection. But in this instance is fine because it's a publicly-traded company. Maybe some shareholder perks to our federal judges?\n\nI understand Yelp has to make $ to survive financially and there's no perfect world but this could have an enormous effect on local business owners and its community of operation. Now, I'm not saying negative customer reviews should be ignored. If a business is shitty to its patrons, shape up or shut the door. However, in this new world of like/love/stars buttons, we put too much emphasis on that tiny piece of information and without questioning it, we believe it accurately represents what we need. \n\nSooooooo.......Blondie's is an awesome local bar where people socialize, dance and become kids again for a few hours--something we can all use!", "author": "Hector M."}

The bar is pretty narrow in front, but opens up to a nice dance floor in the back followed by another bar, The Wet Bar, proceeding the dance floor.  Blondie's has a pretty extensive menu of martinis on their wall.  I had a Blondalope and a cholcolate-mint martini.  Both were equally good, strong, and relatively large (you get about 1.5 martinis for $14).  Not sure if the DJs mostly play late 90s-early 00s hip hop and pop, but they did the night I went.  Not a bad thing, but definitely not music that I would dance my heart out to.  \n\nAt first, this place feels like a high school dance: everyone is standing against the wall and there's this awkwardness in the air.  As the night progresses it definitely gets more lively.  A little wild even, as I saw a girl dance so hard she tripped and bit it on the stage.  Ouch!\n\nI enjoyed myself, but I definitely prefer coming here during a weeknight when they have a live band playing and it's much easier to secure a booth with your friends.  \n\nTip: BRING CASH.  No cash, no drinks!  They unfortunately do not take any sort of plastic here.  \n\nSecond Tip: Get some fresh made pupusas after your night out, at a vendor that is right next door to Skylark.", "author": "Josh S."}

You might think at first that the drinks are expensive...then you end up with an entire pint glass full of deliciousness and realize it's completely worth the price.\n\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of the Marina, and I do admit that this bar can get a little \"marina-guys-trying-to-live-dangerously-by-going-out-in-the-mission\" on weekend nights, but any other time this bar is awesome.  If you are looking for a chill night to belly up to the bar and relax while enjoying any number of the array of fabulous drinks Blondie's has to offer, try Monday night!  The bartender, James, is phenomenal.  He always has the perfect drink to suggest depending on what you like, makes 'em quickly, and is an overall pleasure to be around.  He looks like a great bartender who clearly loves what he does.\n\nEvery time I've been to Blondie's I've had a great time.  The bartenders are always really nice and despite how crowded the bar can get, they still manage to serve everyone quickly.

I have gone a couple times and both times I was pleasantly surprised by how relaxing and fun it was to be there. It is an unassuming place with all of the options for distraction on Valencia. I think thats why I like it. You can dip in here at 8 or 9pm and actually find a place to sit and not be only \"elbo room\" close to other people. \n\nThe drinks are by far the best part. I am a sweet drinks person and there were just so many options and so many things I wanted to try. I also like strong drinks and feeling buzzed when I can and this place does it so well. They specialize in martinis and have a huge list to choose from. I have had the same bartender each time and she is kind of cold unless you know her already so I don't even bother trying to make conversation. She obviously has her locales so do you lady. She serves bomb drinks though that are strong and you get all the leftover alcohol to pour your own refills at your table. That is AMAZING value for a bar in San Francisco. They could easily hold off on that but you are getting at least 3 martinis for 11 bucks. Yea. That wins every-time. \n\nThe second time I went there was live blues music which I haven't heard in a long long time. Not since my days in the Fillmore. It was a welcome surprise and I just wanted to melt into my booth and close my eyes and nod away. Just the perfect atmosphere at night and during the day it is almost a ghost town to watch football on large TV's and sit on the patio and people watch. \n\nThis place doesn't have any wild decor, or secret passwords, or glowing drinks. Its just quality alcohol and quality music in a time when it seems to be more about the presentation than the product. \n\nLong live the product.", "author": "Nick R."}

They make the martini in a pint glass and they fill it all the way up.  Then they pour some into a martini glass and give you the rest of the pint glass with a cocktail strainer.  They have over a dozen varieties of martinis, all deliciously alcoholic.  My favorite is the Dagwood, which is a gin martini with something like 4 different kinds of olives.\n\nThe place is kind of sketch for dancing, but well-priced drink options abound.

The music was great and the bouncer was very friendly but the thing that made me leave and probably never go back was the attitude of the bar back. My group of 7 and I were there Saturday (01.17.2015) night and had ordered several beers and cocktails. I can't speak for my friends but I tipped everything I bought something. Now considering that this is a CASH ONLY bar with a $5 cover, we were not prepared with loads of cash for the occasion. After ordering rounds of drinks and shots, the last round of shots, which ended up being $49, was one I will always remember. We gave them $50, which the bartender gave us back $1. The bar back, some guy with a hat, literally HANDED me the $1 and said \"we don't want your dollar\". At first, I thought this was a joke, that he was kidding. But after trying to leave the dollar and trying to purchase my drink so I could tip them more, the bar back said \"we don't want your dollar, just so you know, we are basically paying to pour you drinks.\" I was so shocked that I told him that I was going to tip him for our shots after I purchased my drink and got change back and that my friends did not have any more cash for tip. He basically replied that it was not his problem and that \"you should know better\". i kept trying to tell him that I was going to tip more but he would not accept that and kept yelling at me that we did not tip for the round of shots. This exchange made me and my friends leave to find another bar with better service. I used to work in the restaurant industry and NEVER did I SCOLD a customer for not tipping. I probably will never return to this bar again, despite the great music, due to the awful attitude of this bar back.  Hopefully, the owners/managers will see this and address this with the specific bar back and teach him exactly what customer service entails. \n\nFor the record, everyone else in this bar was very polite and nice, his attitude ruined the whole experience for me and my friends.", "author": "Jane G."}

Most management would have apologized and invited customers to give another try. She, however, did just the opposite.\n\nNikki, please re-read my initial review. I repeatedly wrote sister, not friend. She was neither belligerent nor drunk. How could she be when she had no drinks to begin with?! I had no drinks either, so yes, I would know. You should not make any false accusations, especially when you were never there to attend to our situation. Learn how to read and listen before you respond. Do not copy and paste responses. Doing so only shows how ignorant you and your staff truly are. Then again, I guess these are the wonderful \"ideals\" and \"rules\" you referred to upholding.

It took the bartender, as well as us, over an hour to realize that 6-pack was sitting next to one of our barstools on the floor.  So, even though you immediately jumped to the bartender's defense and assumed that he was justifiably rude because of the beer - that is wrong.  We were feeling \"AWKWARD\" and unwelcome in your bar for about an hour before that incident took place.  Funny how the bartender conveniently arranged the story to justify his rudeness.  And as a business owner, you are immediately assuming the customer is 100% wrong, even though you weren't there.

Well, Blondie's, you have my full attention. This place serves up some really deadly drinks if you aren't careful about your intake. Overall, all of the mixed beverages on the overhead board are excellent and taste amazing without being overwhelming. My personal favorites are the Bohemian and the Sidecar. Now, we've all had a couple of drinks that just scream alcohol in your face, but Blondie's has managed to muffle that unpleasantness without taking off the bite. Personally, I can only handle one of their drinks and I'm at a fine state for the rest of the night. It's just enough to get a good buzz but not enough to convince you that the blonde across the room is giving you sexy eyes. In other words, it's the perfect amount. Just remember: one and done. Say it to yourself a few times before making any regrettable choices. So, Blondie's makes a good drink. There's definitely no question about that.\n\nNow, the service and the atmosphere makes Blondie's a little tricky. I feel this place is understaffed and awkwardly crowded. On most nights, I've only seen one bartender at work for 30+ people. If you do the math, that means you'll be waiting a while for your drink, but at least that one drink will probably be enough. But then, even after you get the drink, you really have no place to sit. The bar isn't quite big enough for everyone on a crowded night and the booths on the other side of bar are only so big. This makes for a lot of tight squeezes and shoulder-to-shoulder drinking. Combine that with people who've obviously had too much and not enough room between the bar and the booths and you get awkwardness. in retrospect, most of the time at Blondie's, I'm either waiting for a drink or looking for a seat. Eh, at least the drinks are good.", "author": "Frank Y."}

And here's where the awesomeness of Blondie's as a bar chimes in: after our male friend left, these French boys got especially gropey with our new pals and the bartender James heard us trying to politely get these guys to back off, stepped in, and warned the dudes to take their hands off the girls. They pretended not to notice, he warned again and finally they called the bouncer to kick the jerks out after a final \"I'm gonna kick u out if u don't let up\" declaration. I already was having a great time and great service experience absent the other rude customers, but seeing the staff step in to look out for their clientele was really unique and awesome.

Here is the verdict:\n\nPROS: cute girls that are not stuck up, decent DJ (depending on the night), comfortable dance floor (not one of the biggest, but seems to really work for the place), $3 cover charge on weekends (which depending on the night, can be a pro or a con), on a good night with the right amount of girls and a good vibe, this place can be a fun night out.\n\nCONS: expensive drinks, can be slow with no one dancing, even on a night when people are dancing (usually around 12-2) it can feel dead. \n\nRecommendations: Don't come here to start your night off, instead finish it off here. Make sure you have had plenty of alcohol before coming here. And most important, take a peak inside to scope out the scene before you go barreling in with the $3 cover charge.", "author": "Nick C."}

My boyfriend and I were getting drinks at the back bar last night when the bartender--trying to do too many things at once--knocked over my boyfriend's full beer while wiping down the tables and trying to take another group's order. We thought, okay, no big deal, accidents happen, we'll just ask for a new one when the bartender gets a chance. But no. When we did finally get his attention he tried to charge us for the beer that he knocked over. When we--very calmly--explained what happened, he proceeded to get extremely defensive and actually poured out the full beer he was going to charge us for. All in all, not a good experience. The bartender was clearly overwhelmed and didn't know what he was doing. My drink was downright bad and others around us did not look too please with theirs either. The one saving grace was that the owner of the bar replaced my boyfriend's beer with no questions asked. I just hope they get rid of that guy in the back... I know bartenders deal with drunk folks all night long and tend to use that as an excuse to get gruff with people, but when it comes down to it they should still treat customers with at least a modicum of respect.\n\nTL;DR stay out of the back room if you can and stick with the owner--she's great!", "author": "Amy L."}

I guess it gets more crowded on weekends and possibly involves dancing, but it was a little uncomfortable trying to share two stools among like 6 people.\n\nWhat really drove me crazy about the bar though was what happened when I tried to get a drink. As I approached the bar, there was no one behind it. Okay, fine, it's a Tuesday. You don't actually have to chill AT the bar all bored and alone waiting for someone to order. But usually the bartender at least keeps an eye on the bar so that when someone DOES want to purchase a drink, they are able to do so in a timely fashion.\n\nNo. I waited. And waited. And waited. \n\nI read the descriptions of ALL the cocktails. They sounded fine. I considered the apple martini but decided I hadn't had a good enough or bad enough day to warrant a cocktail.\n\nI started to get nervous that maybe my looking at the cocktail list indicated that I was not ready to order and thus discouraging the bartender from showing up, so I tried pointedly to not look at the menu.\n\nI looked at the place where the bartender should be. I looked at the dog sitting on the stool next to me. He hadn't been served yet either. I looked around for people who looked like the bartender, so I could ask them politely for a beer.\n\nSuddenly, this very angry woman ran behind the bar and made herself a drink. \n\nAh, I thought. It must be serve yourself night.\n\nShe looked directly at me and said, \"It's okay, I work here.\" But before I could say, \"I'd like an Anchorsteam,\" she had disappeared.\n\nShe reappeared later, not to take any orders, but to turn on the music. Someone else who worked there came around to tell her to turn it off. Now there were TWO bartenders behind the bar debating whether the music should be on or off and not serving the growing crowd. \n\nThey started having a very childish fight where one would flip it on, then one would flip it off, then one would flip it on, and so forth. It would have been amusing were it not standing in between me and my beer.\n\nFINALLY, the other, less angry, bartender started actually waiting on customers. No apology. No \"thanks for your patience\". No \"would you like a free 'wow you are really patient' cocktail?\" (although I probably should have demanded such a cocktail rather than expecting it would have been offered). \n\nI don't have many other complaints about this bar. I find the name amusing. It would have been a 3, maybe even 4-star experience otherwise.

The first thing I noticed when I looked up at the menu above the bar is that all the drinks listed were martini drinks.  The second thing I noticed is that they *only* accept cash.  Initially I thought the drinks were pretty expensive, but if you order a martini you get this huge drink, plus whatever is left in the shaker.  That totally reminded me of getting a milk shake.  That night I mainly ordered shots of grey goose (no milkshakes for me), and I must admit they poured good sized shots (each shot seemed like 1 1/2  shot) that got me buzzed.\n\nThis spot also has a nice little outdoor area with a couple of tables where you can sit down and smoke outside, while still inside the bar.

Of course, I usually think this when I've had at least a drink or am dancing in the reflection of a window or mirror in my apartment.  But still, I can hang with most people on the dance floor.  I think it would be completely different if the average height weren't 5'5\".  \r\n\r\nBlondie's is a pretty good place to dance.  The DJ play's top 40 hits, great for any girls night out.  Just when your favorite song comes on, not only can you start grooving hard core, but you can also turn to your friend and say to her, a couple times, cause she doesn't hear you the first time, \"I love this song!\"  \"...What?\" \"I LOVE this song!\" \"... oh yeah me too!\"  So there, you've just A.) started dancing sexy so the guy you don't really want to talk to at all has just noticed you and B.) have just made yourself look like you've got lots of friends and lots to talk about with them.  That's what girls do here - that's actually what guys do here, too.  Even if you are the coolest person in the world and not like that at all, YOU might even get sucked in to doing that at Blondie's as well.\r\n\r\nThe martini's are good - you really do get two for the price of one ($11).  Personally I could only handle this place once a year, unless it's an early weekday night, before dinner. I give this place one star for no soap in the ladies bathroom (eew, very, very hot dance floor included) and the first time I walked in to this place, circa 2003 it smelled like sewage.

After paying the $5 cover--I know--we fell into drinking and having a good time. Without resorting to neighborhood stereotypes, the crowd was very fashionable, young, and female, with all that entails. As noted in other reviews, the soundtrack was uninspired.\n\nOverall, the service was pretty poor. Ordering a drink reminded me of ordering lunch from a really surly lunch truck. At one point, I tried to order a water for a girl that couldn't get the bartender's attention. When I tried to catch his eye, he shouted something at me not fit for print in a family newspaper.\n\nAbout 45 minutes before closing time, someone broke a glass, and one of the staff came over to clean it up. He told me to move. I joked that I was very comfortable where I was and had closed-toe shoes. From there the conversation escalated in a really startling way. I never once raised my voice, but the guy seemed to think I was looking for trouble. He told me that if I didn't do what he said, then I would 'have to go'. I told him that I wasn't doing anything wrong, and that it suited me just fine to stay. At that point, he signaled for security. At one point, the angry staff member said he was going to get a cop. I told him to go for it, I hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nIt was at this point that all parties asked me to talk it over outside. Bar 101: move problems outside, shut the door. After about 10 minutes of this, security made a very compelling case for me to go out. The manager/owner/natural blonde, 'Blondie' then came out to talk to me. She seemed relieved that I was outside, but was good about talking to me and admitted that the situation could have been handled better. As a parting salvo, she told me that she hoped I would come back. I won't be back, sorry Blondie. Something tells me it doesn't break your heart.\n\nIn their defense, it was Saturday night, it was crowded, and it sounds like they get a fair amount of jerks through there. Still, an Anchor is an Anchor, and if I have a desire in the future to pay a cover, hang out with that kind of crowd,and be treated like a jerk I will go to the Marina.", "author": "Andrew W."}

Fantastic place if you want to shake your booty on the dance floor on a Friday night, or chill and have a drink with a live band on a Tuesday night.  They have a great selection of alcohol and the Martini's are only $11 (that might sound like a lot but it is actually like 2.5 drinks).  The bartenders and staff and generally nice, except Blondie who can be a bit of a ball buster until you put her in her place.\n\nOn the weekend there is a cover after like 10, so get there early.  It's also nice to get a table or seat at the bar before the place gets packed.", "author": "Lenza M."}

Maybe they are actually taking criticisms on here and using them to improve the place, but I definitely had a different experience.\n\nI came here with some friends to grab drinks and just have an all around good time. It came on the recommendation of my friend who was with us, and lives in the area. When we walked in we headed straight to the back because that was the only open seats available. When we headed toward the bar, I noticed this place has a lot of options for martinis. I personally went for a dirty vodka martini, which is easily my favorite to drink. I got to pick my Vodka (grey goose) and paid 12.50 for my Martini, as well as a pint class filled with the rest of my drink. To be honest, that is pretty cheap. When you think about it, you get say 2-2.5 martinis depending on your pour. After I was done with that, I proceeded to have 2 greyhounds (my favorite drink) which left me pretty drunk. I will say that I don't think I will ever order a greyhound from them again. It wasn't that it was bad, but after being spoiled with \"fresh fruit drinks\" at another bar, they just dont compare.\n\nAmbience is interesting. When we first got there (around 8ish), it was more about sitting and interacting with your friends. By 10 or 11, there was a DJ playing music. I will say the music was pretty awesome; Prince, Michael Jackson, Tone Loc, and other awesome tunes from the 90s. Somebody has been listening my Pandora station.\n\nI have to say this place is pretty awesome considering I am still feeling the consequences 24 hours later. Can't wait to head back and try more items on their massive martini menu.", "author": "Diana R."}

I'm a cheap date) my ears were filled with the wonderful sounds of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones among others..

(no hes not from Sweden or Switzerland, hes from MN.. yay midwest). He manned this entire bar for most of the time I was there and made it look easy. Hes got great bartender skills... I think all the girls there were fixated on his skills and of course cute factor.

I was sheparded here by my new co-workers with the girls from Beantown.  We were greeted by a colorful, somewhat ghetto-fabulous crowd swaying their groins to deliciously cheesy 90's mixes.  Highlights of the night included the more than 50 varieties of martinis to choose from, and the DJ's \"wingman\" clad in a Giants jersey and aviator glasses, who delightfully twirled a dirty white towel above his head for two hours (impressive stamina I must say).\n\nThe second visit was a bit more \"eventful,\" in that during my friends trip to the women's bathroom she was subject to witness a girl getting beaten senselessly over the head with a pint glass.  Don't know if it was because of another man, trash talk, or just for the plain fun of it,  but regardless, in a matter of seconds the girl was on the floor surrounded in a pool of blood. When my ghost-faced friend relayed the action to us, we proceeded to barley make it out of the bar before the cops had cornered off the block.  A slight damper on the evening, but I'm confident that as long as you don't talk too much shit and your people 'got your back' you'll be more fortunate than that poor girl.\n\nThird time: I promised myself I'd leave the bathroom if I saw any girls eyeing my head as if it were a punching bag and went back on a slow Tuesday night to take advantage martinis' ability to knock you (and your date) on your asses ASAP.  After a delicious chocolate mint martini (garnished with a bite-sized Milky Way on a toothpick), we left the bar unscathed, tipsy and happy.\n\nAll in all, Blondie's is a good time; a fun place to shake your bootie in the Mission if you don't feel like dealing with the hipsters, and most importantly, has all the martinis you could ever want.", "author": "Nicole C."}

During our drinking sesh in \"The Wet Spot Bar\" we noticed that we had all started to head nod uncontrollably to the beats and were drawn to the dance party out on the floor.  We ended up staying all night and got down...it was exactly what we had been looking for!  \n\n...One of us even ended up taking the cute bartender home...you can't really beat that.", "author": "Ariana K."}

Yet somehow I managed to feel wholly out-of-place in Blondie's.  I honestly felt like I, little unprentious me, outclassed everyone in the club with the exception of my other girlfriends.  And possibly these guys from the Marina who were going to be Stanford GSB students who performed what could quite easily be the funniest dance I've ever seen to \"Billy Jean\" - like I was actually almost falling onto the beer-splattered floor laughing so hard.  However, two stars for the following.\n\nOne for allowing me to shake it all out on the stage to an awesome DJ.  Clearly we were there too long because we reheard a couple of songs from the start of the night when we were leaving.  It's all stuff you'd hear on the radio, poorly mixed sometimes, but I didn't go for cutting edge hip hop.  It was guilty pleasure music that made me happy.  Also getting shoved aside by a very short and very wide couple freak dancing was pretty awesome and reminded me of when I lived in Hampton VA.\n\nOne star for the coat check guy, who every time a song he liked came on strutted onto the stage and swung a white towel over his head as though he were cheering for his football team.  Thanks for the night of endless laughter.\n\nI might come back here if like all of my friends decided it was the place to be one night, but I definitely wouldn't go expecting to meet anyone interesting, have a place to sit and talk, or get amazing drinks.", "author": "Becky N."}

Have no idea why as we all bought drinks, weren't rowdy and were having a good time chatting. \n\nSo, into the loud club we went where the DJ had schizophrenia with the tunes. Would get a good song on that everyone knew, the dance floor would fill up, then literally a minute later, switch to something completely different that no one knew and everyone would leave the floor. This happened several times, pretty weak. On closing time, there was no usual last call and the music was cut off abruptly and everyone herded out the door like cattle.

When we were about to leave, the bar was incredibly crowded and we could not get back inside to leave through the doors.  So my companion decided to step over the  hip high little railing.  I followed.  And just as my one leg had gone over, one of the bouncers came over and SHOVED me and I fell backwards, with one leg still hooked over the railing.  Just by chance, I was able to stop my falling all the way, in time to prevent from smashing against the chairs or table and split my head open. \n\nI was shocked and pissed off.  Unfortunately my companion had been looking the other way and completely missed seeing the bouncer shove me over.  He thought I just lost my balance.  The bouncer had purposedly come over to push me over and slipped quickly back to his position at the door.  I yelled at him asking him why the hell he had done that.  (If it was illegal to step over the railings, he could have said so verbally WITHOUT laying a hand on me, much less pushing me over.)   He responded by sneering and insulting me for my behavior:  ie yelling at him.   Talk about a loser with a power trip.\n\nBtw, I'm female and petite and the bouncer was about twice the size of me.  My companion, while not exactly the type that worked out, was 6'4\" and the bouncer clearly ignored him and went after me.  \n\nI called Blondie's the next day to leave a message of complaint.  A woman identifying herself as the owner called me back a week later, sounding very concerned.  I described the incident and she wasn't happy about it.  I was only able to generally describe the bouncer/doorguy who pushed me over, but unfortunately there were two black guys working at the door there around the same time, same build, but different color clothing and I told her that and gave the clothing description I had.  She also took my name down and said she'd comp me a few drinks at the bar the next time I chose to visit.\n\nI'm not sure if she was able to do anything or if she even spoke to her bouncers, (hope the other guy didn't get in trouble), but not knowing that, I didn't feel comfortable going back.

The bartender asked for ALL our IDs (which is completely understandable) and after waiting 10 minutes without service, we were told to leave for no GOOD reason!  I asked why we were denied service and his response was \"can't you see that I'm busy!\"  \n\nYes, I do understand that you are busy with about 10 people sitting at the bar (more than half already served), but I was in no hurry... I was with 12 friends and I know that can be a bit overwhelming, but there was no reason for us to be turned away!\n\nI cannot grasp the idea of any business that would turn away paying customers because the bartender at a BAR cannot handle it!   I personally think the owner needs to reevaluate his/ her staff, if the bartender on a Sunday night (11/11/2007) at 8 pm cannot handle more than 10 customers, that is a business that will be short lived despite the great location.  \n\nThis has always been a place I wanted to go to because of the location and the ambiance, but after this experience, I would much rather walk down to the Elbow Room, the 500 Club, the Beauty Bar, and even Doc's Clock, than this degrading place.  And I COMPLETELY agree with some of the comments posted, this is a crappy place to spend your money. \n\n If you want to feel like you're not worth a thing from the staff, Blondie's is a place to be!

First of all, this place is $7.00 for a very small, weak, bottom shelf cocktail, and in the Mission, thats a little steep considering every bar around it is $4.00. My friends band was playing and I was waiting on that, but I told the bartender i couldnt afford another one. He started hitting on me in a very subtle way and told me not to worry about it, just order what I want and smiles and doesnt take my money. I put my money on the bar anyways and he wouldnt take it, an hour and a half later its still there (for the first drink), and he IS taking every one elses money right away. My friends band shows up, and one of the band members says to the bartender he wants to buy me a drink. The bartender (I believe this to be the case anyways), thinks this is my boyfriend and humiliates me by telling this guy in the band (who've only known 2 weeks, as I just moved here) that I owe $28.00 for the last three drinks and looks to him to pay for it!

After copious glasses of just whiskey and ice we flagged down an unmarked limo whose windows were held together by duct tape, to take us to our prospective locations.

In my drunken stupor I did manage to leave my wallet in the limo never to be seen again,  however I did pocket a glass from the bar ware cabinet in the limo(who got the last laugh sucka). The bar ware became my property due to the fact that I always become overly deviant and like to \"appropriate\" items during said drinking binges. All and all a good time to be had at Blondies.

That bar brings me back to a college club, where sorority girls got wasted on the stiff drinks and immediately headed to the dance-floor, thugs sat in the shadows waiting until they could move in and grind on the blacked-out victims, and all the other riff raff that ensued.  It was damn entertaining back then, but now it's kinda depressing.  The too-old sorority girls still hunting for the best drink deals (they do have a pretty good one), and the thugs of the Mission hear the click of those stilettos on the pavement and come running.  I don't recommend ordering the martinis until you've consumed many other good drinks elsewhere... that's the only way they'll be enjoyable.

We noticed that the crowd really started going downhill at the end of our college careers- the people who came here just started getting more ghetto, and seemed to all be from the out of town, bridge and tunnel types. That, and they jacked up the drink prices and started playing really awful music. I walked by this place the other night and my assessment was still the same- it looked crowded, nasty and ghetto.
