It is not as busy and we were being served right away :) \n\nThey offer special lunch menu, but it is still above average lunch price for a Thai place. All the basic dishes are about ~$14.  I came for their Snow White ($20) because it looks very tempting from photos. It is not disappointing me!!  There is white wine and lots of seafood in there. A very rich and flavorful dish.  My colleague and I will definitely come back for it.  \n\nPro: It is a decent place for dinning with friends! Parking is very easy since it's close to residential areas.  Their dishes look very aesthetic and fulfilling :)", "author": "Shuyi L."}

I came here with the expectations that this was Osha, reopening with different management. I was utterly tricked by my grandparents (or it was a communication issue) and imagine my shocked expression when I saw that the sign in fact did NOT say \"Osha\" but instead \"One Waan\". I was confused but my grandparents continued to stroll in like they have been here countless times (they have not and their confidence was utterly shocking). \n\nWe went to eat lunch and got the lunch special. I had gotten the House Salad, samosa, and the yellow curry (which only comes with chicken, costing about $13). \nHouse Salad: I have had a peanut dressing salad before at a Thai restaurant but I do not recall one as... spicy? as this. It left a burning sensation in the back of your throat. Now, I am not of legal age to drink alcohol but I would imagine that the dressing has a similar burning taste in the back of your throat as downing vodka. \nSamosa: I was really looking forward to this. I love samosas with a burning passion. But man, was I super disappointed when it came out. There was only one, and it seemed like they tried to make it deep fried but left it in the fryer for a few minutes too long. The outside seemed a few seconds shy of being burnt. It had a hard exterior and wasn't like any of the samosas I've ever eaten before. (not in a good way). The insides were average, nothing superior but not bad either. \nYellow Curry: Just like on the menu, there was chicken, potatoes, and carrots with some onions. I found it super funny but there was this HUGE piece of potato in it. Like they took a Parel potato and cut it in half. There wasn't a huge bunch of chicken. It was about the perfect amount. Although, just like the potatoes, there were large pieces of chicken. It seemed as if they only could allow certain cuts per dish. \n\n(a longer description for those who want it):\nWhen you first step in, there is not a traditional waiting area where a hostess will appear (attached is a picture of what I am talking about). If a waitress doesn't approach you, then towards the back of the restaurant, there will be a long table (kind of the bar area but without any stools). where the waitress/hostess might be. If it's not busy (like it was when I went), she will give you some table options and you might be able to choose. As you settle in, she would come and hand you the menus. She would check on you to see if you were ready to order. The salad came in about 5 minutes. All of the dishes came out fairly fast. Although, she did not come and refill my cup when it was empty. Which is absolutely ok and fine for a normal person but I am an awkward person, so i couldn't muster the courage to ask. But again, fearless grandparents asked for me. She came and brought one of those huge glasses that hip places have now a days so you can refill it yourself. For socially awkward people, this may be a place where you might not feel 100% comfortable. \n\nOverall, I like Osha better. But, this is an ok place. I highly recommend this place for lunch.", "author": "Naomi C."}

We ordered 5 different dishes, all were absolutely delicious and looked beautiful. \n\n1. Corn pancake appetizer - super crispy and the sauce that came with it complemented it really well. Would order again.\n\n2. Tom kha soup - perfect balance of sourness and creaminess. You can definitely taste the spices in the soup. Very flavorful.\n \n3. One waan snow white - my favorite dish. The udon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewiness. I was so surprised by how chewy the noodles were. The sauce was super creamy and not too heavy. It came with seafood. Definitely must try\n\n4. Khao soi - second favorite dish. The curry was so creamy and delicious. It came with a big piece of chicken which was tender and moist. The best part about this dish was the udon, super chewy.\n\nI wanted to try their mango sticky rice dessert, but the waiter told us they didn't have any mangoes since they were out of season so they let us try the sticky rice with mango ice cream instead, which made it kind of too sweet but still tasted good. My brother and I couldn't finish it cuz it was getting too sweet and it came with a lot of sticky rice, which had an interesting bluish purple color. \n\nThis place would probably be more busy if it was in a different location, but since it's more in the outskirts of SF, there's not usually a wait unless maybe if you come on a weekend for dinner. If you take Bart, the restaurant is located right when you get off Glen Park station. Inside is nicely decorated and the staff are friendly.

I arrived at the Glen Park BART station and headed over, not necessarily expecting it to be ready since I had literally just ordered it but it was ready within 5 minutes of me arriving and I walked home to enjoy it.\n\nLiterally no joke. The first bite of it was euphoric like the pad see ew made my sickly self feel SO GOOD. Like the combination of sauce, rice noodles, chicken -- ugh YES. That evening was also extremely miserable for me but the pad see ew was the highlight so much that the next day I did the exact same thing and ordered tom kha soup and pad see ew again. Thankfully I had decided on this early enough so I put in my order thirty minutes in advance this time so it was perfect to pick up right when I got there. This day I was getting better so I was a bit underwhelmed and I would actually not recommend getting the tom kha soup lol but the pad see ew is good stuff.\n\nAnyway, tldr: great Thai food located RIGHT across from Glen Park BART. If you want to order takeout recommend putting in your order about 20 minutes in advance - (I did it through Yelp, and Yelp says it takes 65-75 minutes but that's a lie). Highly recommend the pad see ew. Thank you for saving my life figuratively when I was close to death this past week.", "author": "Brian W."}

The shrimp spring rolls were extremely large including the shrimp.  The cilantro was a bit strong!  The crackling chicken salad was good and full of covering on the chicken. I'd order food here again!\n\nAnother night we decided to eat at the restaurant. The places surrounding the restaurant have bars on their doors and windows. Walking into the restaurant, it's tastefully decorated. The service was on par and the food was amazingly great. The chicken satay was perfectly moist & the best I've had. I ordered the BBQ Duck over spinach with broccoli & brown rice. The duck was the tastiest and moist I've ever eaten. The spinach had a great flavor to it.

However I ordered take out from One Waan tonight.  First thing I noticed was they forgot to include the jasmine rice that was supposed to come with the order. While on the phone with them I then discover that the potatoes were grossly undercooked, basically raw and inedible. \n\nThey refused to deliver me a corrected order and called me a liar on the phone. He said I was making up the story about the potato because they refused to deliver the rice (that they had left out of the order).   See below the raw, rotten potatoes they served. \n\nI highly suggest, unless you want to eat rotten produce, that you stay away from this place. Maybe if they close down OSHA will open back up?  One can dream.\n\nEdit: Wow - so the owner of One Waan just lies as easily as Trump.  \"You didn't order the rice, so how was I supposed to know you wanted rice?\"  - problem... it's required to answer what kind of rice you want in the app.  You literally CANNOT put it in your shopping cart without choosing.  And \"No Rice\" is not an option (see the pictures).\n\nAnd yes, after 1) not getting everything i ordered 2) being called a liar on the phone, 3) discovering that you use rotten uncooked produce, I lost my appetite and didn't want to eat anything I had ordered and asked for a full refund.  And I'm not about to spend MORE time taking it all back to you.  If you want it, come to my house and fish it out of the garbage, which is where your food belongs (sorry, i mean in the green bin... I assume the food, while rotten, is at least compostable.)\n\nLets move on to some of your other \"gems\"  \n\n\"We never have any problems with our orders\" - just look at the 1-3 star reviews, a reoccuring theme is leaving things OUT of take out orders.  But keep gaslighting and call all of us liars...\n\n\"Then you hung up the phone\" - after you called me a liar.  When you are so rude and disrespectful to a customer, there is no reason to continue a conversation.  I did not yell, scream, or insult you.  I was not rude.  I'm not going to continue a conversation with an arrogant, obnoxious owner.\n\n\"Maybe cooking the potatoes for so long changed the color\"?  To black?  No - that's rotten dude.  Also, if you simmered white meat chicken and potatoes for two hours 1) The chicken would be incredibly tough and the potatoes would be incredibly mushy. So either you used a cheaper cut of all dark meat chicken - and still are charging a premium price for it, or you just normally serve bad food.  Or perhaps you meant that the curry simmers for 2 hours and not the chicken and potatoes, although you certain tried to imply that you cooked the potatoes for the full two hours as a way of \"proving\" that it couldn't possibly be under-cooked (even though I provided a video showing that it was).\n\n\nInstead of trying to defend your wrong actions and bad food, fix it. There are NUMEROUS negative reviews for your lack of attention to detail (leaving things out of orders) and poor attitude by the staff.   Gee wiz is it all of us?  Or is it you?", "author": "P K."}

I brought my friends from Hawaii here sometime last month because I was taking them around the city. I told them how much I enjoyed this spot but I could not say the same the second time around.  \n\nPAD THAI: First of all, the color and presentation of it just wasn't apetizing and the flavor was just as disappointing. It was way too sweet and dry. \nBACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS: Definitely not as good as the first time I tried it. The bacon was hella undercooked inside I honestly couldn't eat it. \nPANANG CURRY: My bestie specifically asked for it mild because she has been sensitive to spice during her pregnancy and I felt so bad she couldn't enjoy her food. \n\nOverall, if you are not a fan of extra sweet anything I don't recommend coming here. I hope and want to say there must have been a different chef the last time I came. I personally liked the sweetness of the tom yum the first time I came with my man but my friends hated it.

My partner and I checked it out for dinner last night.\n\nNot a lot has changed about the experience, really. The anchoring modern design is basically the same, though I think all the furniture is new and there's been a subtle face lift to the bar and some accent pieces. The menu feels really similar to the old place too, with its wide array of tropical cocktails, fusion-y appetizers, and dishes you find at most Thai restaurants. I enjoyed the ahi tuna tartare to start (not very Thai, but at least they served it with shrimp chips... that's vaguely Southeast Asian, right?), and the papaya salad was solid, but the green chicken curry was a little bland and had some undercooked veggies. Maybe they're still working out the kinks.\n\nThey did offer us free wine, to help celebrate their opening. That was pretty cool. And service, as always, was kind.\n\nI'm glad there's still Thai food in the neighborhood with One Waan. 3 stars for now, more to come soon I hope.", "author": "Kate V."}

Although at first disappointed, One Waan ended up being a more than worthwhile replacement for the former restaurant, albeit a bit pricey (but what isn't in San Francisco?) There is not a lunch special offer. Note to owners-please consider adding one-please and thank you...\nOther than that our meal was excellent. The veggie crispy rolls were flavorful and not too oily-although at $8.95, I would probably skip them next time unless visiting with a larger party. The entr\u00e9e portions are very generous so appetizers aren't necessary, unless you've got a big group and sharing with others. \nThe presentation of the entrees was aesthetically pleasing & the flavors were quite distinct. The veggies were fresh and full of color and the meals seemed a notch up from the former occupant's dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-10", "description": "Had the pleasure of dining here last night! It used to be Osha Thai which was a bit on the basic side. The owners of One Waan are super friendly and passionate about the Thai food they serve which is admirable for any restaurant owner (I found out they have an IG acct: @onewaanthai). They truly enjoy shopping for the freshest produce and meats, which might set them apart from other commercialized Thai restaurants. We could taste the difference here. \n\nWe started with our favorite, Tom Yum Soup. We've had it at a lot of other Thai restaurants and this one definitely topped the list. It had layers of flavor and the shrimp was not overcooked, tasted like more than just tamarind juice/paste with water and was served in a nice shallow pot with a small fire under to keep it warm. My BF ordered the Spicy Basil dish which consisted of green beans, bell peppers, onion in a garlic sauce with beef. He also requested the spicy additives on the side so he could control the level of heat in the dish (even that was presented nicely!). He fully enjoyed the beef as it was tender and tasty. I ordered the Pad Thai (always a good gauge on how the rest of the menu will taste). It was presented so nicely that I had to take a video of it, not a photo, a video. Portion size was very good; being the healthy eater that I am, I couldn't even finish it. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the noodles had good sweet/peanut flavor. Although, I probably could've used another squeeze of lime juice, but that's just me as I like that refreshing flavor of lime juice splashed on hot noodles. We also tried the crab rangoon and Thai Samosa which were also delightful dipped in the sweet and sour sauce.  \n\nWe will definitely be back to try more foods on the menu; I'm probably more excited to try that mango sticky rice!", "author": "Kimberly H."}

Proportion was surprisingly small with having one 5 inch spring roll cut in half for $5?? But it was kinda fresh though, definitely not worth it! Drunken noodles were on the same price tier as Blackwoods's Thai noodles but smaller and not nearly as good in my opinion. \n\nAlso had another order of yellow curry chicken!

Delicious flavors in two dishes we ordered: Green Papaya Salad and chicken, vegetables in a light curry saut\u00e9ed with wide noodles.  Scrumptious really.  Close your eyes and you could think you were in Thailand.  We ordered 'spicy' and that's what we got.  Usually, folks tone down the heat for the general American palate, but, though super spicy lovers who usually add hot peppers to even the 'extra spicy' dishes at other places, we felt delighted to discover that One Waan practiced \"truth in menu-ing.\"  If you're super brave/have an asbestos palate, there is an 'extra spicy' option.\n\nAs is so often the case, the Jasmine rice here is better than at all but the very highest end (read 'expensive') restaurants in Thailand itself.  Poor Thais: their top quality rice is almost entirely exported.  This leaves them with second and third best quality.  One Waan definitely got the good stuff -- and it tasted great with our Som Thom and curry.  \n\nCondiments were top notch too!\n\nService: knowledgeable, warm, and subtle, just like the overall ambiance.  What a joy to dine in a calm space with lots of light from the glass wall front and tasteful decor.  \n\nOnly down notes?  The spring rolls we ordered lacked any flavor whatsoever.  We will go back and try more dishes.  The prices are a bit higher than Lers Ros for similar dishes.  It's not fair to compare One Waan to any other restaurant b/c One Waan beats all others in SF except for Lers Ros.  I suppose that One Waan needs to charge more b/c it has lower volume, for now, than other spots.  It's hard to meet the high rents of SF without enormous volume.", "author": "Scott C."}

I'm embarrassed because One Waan is right in my own \"backyard.\"  I ALWAYS show up at Glen Park BART at least once a week and never noticed it.  I thought it was the Old Osha Thai which I liked too and which also served pricey quality food, but I always thought Osha was too formal & Americanized for my pedestrian tastes AND I don't think they delivered to my area.  Well after having ordered from One Waan, count me shocked!!    I ALREADY ATE beforehand and so I was more in an exploratory mode of eating. I read the positive yelp reviews for One Waan, trying to decide whether or not to order from it on Ubereats.com.  Based on the reviews, I thought I might be ending up with small portion dishes.  However, even if I had NOT eaten beforehand, I would have already been full or nearly full.  I fill up fast and I'm not the type of person who can eat more than 2 times in an all-you-can-eat buffet (although I LOVE and can never resist a buffet meal because of its high value/high variety of dishes, the 2nd time at the buffet table, I'll probably only focus on 1 or 2 dishes I like and finish with a salad & dessert), so base your decision of portion size on that.  I ordered the Praram\n(Peanut curry sauce, broccoli, and steamed spinach with pork) with a side of jasmine rice AND Crab Fried Rice.  Both the Praram & CFRice were as fresh as you could get.  The broccoli in the Praram was not too soft and when I mixed the thin peanut sauce with the jasmine rice, it flavored the rice nicely. I LOVE crab fried rice and their presentation for just a takeout/delivery was outstanding!! You could see large clumps of crabmeat on top of the rice as well as mixed into the rice and all of it was fresh along with green onions, mixed eggs, tomatoes,etc and on the side, a slice of lime and 2 slices of cucumber and the fried rice filled up the entire takeout container.  Both dishes were delivered at the estimated arrival time. Now if YOU WANT your thai food HOT AND SPICY, FORGET IT!! Most of the dishes are mild unless I guess you specifically ask for it. I should have asked for spoons/forks/knives/napkins since they weren't included.  Would I order from One Waan again? DEFINITELY!!!", "author": "Frugal C."}

We were able to try both the vegetarian ones and the chicken ones. The veg samosas had a bit of a smoky flavor. Not sure if that was intentional, or a happy accident. \n\nDuck was good, and the drunken noodle was one of the better versions of the dish that I have tried. Spicy and flavorful.\n\nI always thought Osha was good, but a little pricey and a little too focused on fancy presentation. Prices are similar, but I'd say One Waan wins on flavor.\n\nWe briefly got to talk to the owner Alex. Nice guy and I hope he's able to keep up the quality. We'll be back fo' sure.", "author": "Rocco B."}

We also thought the portions were more than adequate. We were all too full to have dessert. We are already looking forward another meal from One Waan tomorrow night!\n\nAnother point that I'd make is that the owner is very friendly and responsive as are the staff. I'd emailed with a question I had about their website information and the owner got back to me right away. I also asked if a reservation would be necessary given when we would be there. He said he'd be glad to reserve a table once we had the time nailed down.

Sweet and lacked depth, 80% of the tasty veggies were gone.\nChicken Satay: Tiny portion (and no skewer??), marinade was bland, chicken was waaay overcooked.\nGreen Curry w/ Tofu: Curry sauce was flat and washed out. Tofu used to be plain, now it's fried. Lacked any heat. \nCrispy chicken over fried rice: Formerly an Osha favorite with the kids. Definitely different and the kids noticed instantly. Chicken breading was super bland, fried rice was OK but had an odd almost chemical aftertaste.\nPad See Ew: Closest to the old Osha version. A solid B/B+ (chicken was dry though)\n\nNow maybe we ordered the wrong stuff, and perhaps there are new super authentic dishes we didn't try.

Because the menu looked similar (prices may be a $1-$3 more), we what was different.  Waitress told us that the pad thai was different as well as the curry.  We ordered some basic dishes: chicken satay, papaya salad, pad thai, green beans with pork, pumpkin curry, mixed vegetables.  Of all the dishes, I liked the green beans dish the best.  The other dishes were bland did not have the same tasty flavors as Osha Thai and did not thrill us.  Medium spicy was not very spicy, but they brought four different hot peppers / sauces to supplement.  We were told that they had only opened for a week and perhaps they are working out the kinks.  There weren't too many tables when we were there at 6:30 pm on Sat night.  They should have a grand opening promotion of some sort to encourage people to try it out.  The menu is pricier and the portions are smaller compared to Osha Thai which is disappointing.  The good service (given the prior wait staff) remained consistent.
