They finished their lunch at the restaurant and asked if it was ok to wait for me there, according to my uncle, the staff was very friendly and didnt chase them out. Mind you i was driving out from the valley to the city with 2 accidents along the way.. it took me almost 2 hrs to get there with a stop in between to get my parents.. long story short, i finally got to the restaurant, said Hello to my uncle & aunt outside then off to find restroom.. lol\nI walked in anticipating some resistance from wait staff giving me a hard time about restrooms for patrons only but NOPE, they said YES, go ahead its in the back and pointed me to it.. I was So relieved and genuinely appreciative of their understanding... So to repay that gesture, here is a 5 star review for their kindness.... And will try their food next time i'm in the city.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Most popular Dongbei dishes are usually the dumplings and the beef wraps. \n\nI have been looking for a great DongBei style cuisine for a while now. My favorite place is actually a place in Taipei of all places since I haven't had the chance to visit Northeastern China yet. \n\nUsually I would get a few types of dumplings, the hot and sour soup, a vegetable dish, and the beef wrap. \n\nThis place is very affordable for what you get and the portions are large. What I love about SF is the ability to get food from several regions of China and Dongbei Mama fills a niche in the palette. \n\nIt's quite good for what it is, and if you stick with the popular dishes from other Yelpers, you are going to be fine.

It was fantastic and I definitely recommend going here if you want some authentic Chinese aFood. They offer a large array of regional Chinese dishes from Sichuan to Cantonese cuisine. Though there is a lot on the menu, try to go out of the box with the things you order (ex. NOT the orange chicken or King Pao Beef). \n\nService was really friendly and attentive. Definitely come here with your friends and family so you can share the dishes! The dishes i ordered can definitely be split among 2-3 people. \n\nWHAT I ORDERED: \n1) Beef Roll Pancake ($7.89): Definitely a winner and my favorite thing I ordered! Features a warm crispy flaky chewy scallion pancake that encloses fresh cucumber and cilantro with a hoisin-marinated melt-in-the-mouth beef. This thing is huge and is as long as my fore arm!\n\n2) Honey Walnut Shrimp ($13.98): Nice crunch to the honey walnut shrimp due to the crispy and light batter. One of my qualms with this dish is sometimes the shrimp is 80% batter but it's not the case with this at all! Walnuts are deliciously candied.\n\n3) I also ordered stir fried vegetables with pork. It was yummy but almost too oily. Still would recommend, I just would pair it up with something lighter.", "author": "Julie D."}

The majority of their clients are from Chinese tour buses and 2. Their name in Chinese is very odd (according to my parents). But then it gets featured in the Chronicle as a restaurant that best represents it's region of China in the Bay Area...\n\n...whaaaat?!\n\nAnd so we came. Twice. In a week. Because our first time was good enough to warrant a second try of their menu. Be forewarned, the portion sizes here are huuuuuge. \n\nOur favorites to date:\n\n1. Beef roll pancake - there's a place on Taraval that makes these amazing beef roll pancakes and then you come here and feel like that place has been ripping you off 10 fold because this one is truly a giant. The fresh cilantro and cucumbers are a refreshing contrast between the thin sliced beef, hoisin sauce, and the wrap itself which may be considered a little thick.\n\n2. Steamed tofu and fish. It's delivery is a long block of soft tofu topped with fish filets that's been steamed together and garnished with sweet soy sauce, oil, and scallions. Truly delicious in my opinion.\n\n3. Dried tofu sauteed with chives. Very simple dish in my opinion, but executed well. Chives had a nice sweet crunch to them without being too strong.\n\n4. Pork belly rice. Huge portions. Plus a very generous helping of braised pork belly that is melt in your mouth decadent. The crunch from the bell peppers and sauteed onions are the only things that bring you back to reality.\n\nOverall, service can definitely be a hit or miss. One waitress definitely knows her stuff though making key recommendations and also turning us away from dishes that she wouldn't recommend. Maybe some people would find that pushy, but all of her suggestions seemed spot on.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

When I first walked in, I was acknowledged, but stood there a little awkwardly waiting to get seated. I ordered the Soup Dumplings, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Dan Dan noodles. \n\nThe server didn't write down my order but I didn't think she would need to because we ordered only three things. The Dan Dan noodles came out first which was a little bland for my liking. There wasn't much flavor to it which was a shame because it smelled delicious. The server then brought out some sort of stew that I didn't order. I explained to him that I ordered the soup dumpling (xaio long bao) and he didn't know how to respond so he just stared. The lady who took my order came out and said that I ordered the stew, which I didn't, then she said \"if you want the xaio long bao you have to wait\" so we waited. When the xaio long bao came out I was so excited because it looked really authentic! It came with 8 pieces, but I was really disappointed because there were only two that actually had soup in them (which I didn't get to try). The meat inside had really good flavors, though. The honey *pecan* shrimp was really good. The shrimp was crispy and the sauce wasn't too sweet or creamy. The presentation was cute too! \n\nAside from the experience I had with the language barrier, I was pretty unhappy with soup dumplings with no soup in it.

The restaurant is big, but it fills up fast and the tables can feel a little cramped. The service was obscurely fast. They pump out the food super quick and it's piping hot.\n\nI recommend the Beef Pancake - I could eat an entire one to myself and it's enormous. Great to share with friends if you feel like sharing. The pancake is so crispy which I love. The Fish in Chili Oil was very flavorful and had a wonderful kick in the face and tongue. It goes great with rice! Spicy Eggplant was good as is the Mapu Tofu. There was something very comforting about the Sour Cabbage and Pork Belly Soup. Lots of rich pork flavor contrasted by the welcomed taste of the mildly acidic and slightly firm cabbage.\n\nUnfortunately, I would advise against getting the Hot and Sour Soup. That's a staple for me, but this place serves it mostly hot temperature and spicy wise. It wasn't enjoyable, and the acidity made it almost more like a punishment. I couldn't recommend the Vegetarian Dumplings even if you're a vegetarian. They use mushrooms and glass noodles, which is normally fine, but the taste was kind of cardboard or cupboard - very old tasting.\n\nWe came here early so it was pretty slow, but then it got PACKED from a bunch of tour buses and the turnover was SO HIGH.

I wasn't crazy about the beef pancake, but if I needed something good and filling to eat while driving this is a long way better than a big mac.  Somehow that doesn't do it justice; maybe I just wanted less pancake.  Steamed fish fillet with tofu, check.  Shredded pig ear appetizer was good, crunchy, spicy.  Pig's blood, beef and tripe in chili soup is a lot better than it may sound but could I added more chili.  All in all, this was more than enough for me to plan a return.

They sat us by the door even though the majority of the tables were empty, which was disappointing. We were able to pretty quickly order Hot and Sour Soup, Soup Dumplings (XLB), Chow Mein, and Mongolian Beef. The food was brought out quickly, but in reverse order from what I would normally expect. First they brought the Chow Mein and Mongolian Beef, and then the soup, followed by dumplings (much later).\n\nWe enjoyed the chow mein- it was very straightforward, no frills, but a nice dish. The Mongolian Beef was pretty good as well, but very basic. The Soup was good at first, but the huge chunk of cilantro that they threw on top totally altered the flavor of the soup until it was overwhelmingly cilantro. Even my boyfriend who LOVES cilantro thought it was too much. I hate cilantro, so it was disappointing. \n\nThen they brought out some sort of dumplings; definitely not the dumplings we had ordered. Only one of the servers spoke english, so we had to track her down to let her know that these were not the soup dumplings we had ordered. She was super nice and said she would bring us the right ones. However, it took another 15 minutes or so until they arrived, so we had been finished eating for quite some time. On top of that, the dumplings were just okay, not great (and I eat a ton of XLB). They were quite bland and the meatball in the middle was very large and dense. However, the worst part was the final dumpling (my last bite of the meal). I took in the whole dumpling, and basically bit into cold grizzle. The meatball was a completely different color from the others and it was disgusting. I was pretty bummed that eating that dumpling (and then spitting it out) was my last taste. I cannot recommend these XLB.\n\nOverall, I added an extra star for the quality service from the one waitress we encountered. She was adorable and very attentive. The food is very generic Chinese.

Although they have a wide ranging menu, the other items didn't really stand out as I was hoping.\n\nI actually wanted to come here because the beef roll pancake looked so delicious.  The verdict? I've had better for cheaper. The pancake is stuffed with cucumbers and the beef inside was too sweet for my tastes buds.  But luckily the noodles saved the day and my dinner.  Let's critique the broth; spicy, savory, and numbing from the peppers.  Noodles had great chew and I'm not sure if they made fresh or bought it. There could have been some more beef but considering how cheap it was, I didn't mind. Another dish I tried were the spicy chicken.  I would skip this since the chicken was cut up into pieces so small I thought they were scrap pieces at first. \n\nIt's run by Chinese folks so don't expect the best customer service.

Listed under cold appetizer dishes. WARNING: normally comes with multiple meats and egg. If you are vegetarian, you have to ask for no meat. The lovely server said that would be fine. But then, when it came out, it still had ham. It's pretty easy to see it because the dish comes arranged with the ingredients arrayed in a pretty circle with the clear noodles in a pile in the middle. As I was trying to ask if the pink stuff was ham, the first server realized the issue and whisked it away. When the dish came out a minute later, it was a little less pretty so they may have just pulled off the ham, or been in a rush to replace the dish. If you are a strict vegetarian, please be careful.  They were not busy, I was one of 2 tables at the time.  Dropped a star for the meat being included. \n\nThe dish is tasty, good amount of both chili and numbing pepper, and rich with sesame paste.

I saw the prices on the menu and they looked higher than my normal price point, but when they came out with the dishes, I understood why; the plates were huge! We ordered:\n\nPicked cabbage with vermicelli soup\n- delicious! It's the kind of soup that warms the soul. Has a slight gingery/spicy taste that'll warm you from the inside out \nSignature sliced beef pancake\n- the pancake was thicker than I was used to, but I wasn't mad about it. Very filling \nSteamed fish filet with tofu in chili sauce\n- the sauce was spicy! Crunchy from the celery too. It also had a layer of spam/ham. Delicious\nSignature eggplant with homemade sauce\n- the way they cut this eggplant was unique, such that if you tried to grab it, you'd get a lot of skin which is not a bad deal since they fried it well. Each bite was tasty!\n\nOrder rice and you'll have a well balanced meal (not too oily). I took all the leftovers home and it lasted me 4 more meals! Worth!", "author": "Serena W."}

My dad loves beef noodle soup, so I thought we would give this place a try! Parking wasn't terrible, we found a meter spot across the street. The restaurant was half filled, so we were seated right away. Typical Chinese restaurant, not the cleanest furniture, but nothing raised any concerns. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The beef noodle soup was just ok. I wasn't really a fan of the thick cut noodles they used. The broth was flavorful, yet not too salty. I hate having to chug a whole glass of water after drinking soup at some places. I really liked the dandan noodles, spicy minced pork over noodles. They use the same thick cut noodles, which in my opinion taste better with sauce instead of soup. We were able to adjust the spicy level, which is a plus since my dad can't really handle spicy (those Cantonese genes haha). The beef pancake roll was pretty good! The pancake was crispy and the beef and veggies inside worked well together. We also got the xiao long baos, but nothing really stood out about them. \n\nThe food is a solid 3 but their service is amazing! Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. My brother accidentally dropped his chopsticks, and by the time he picked it up from the floor, the waitress already walked over to our table and had a new set ready. The price of everything was also super affordable. Most of our dishes were around $8!!! I'll definitely drop by again to try the other items on their menu (they also have exquisite Chinese delicacies such as pig ears, pig head, etc.) Overall, it's not the best Chinese food I've had but considering the great service and low prices ... it's a 4 star for me!", "author": "Nancy C."}

This place is the opposite: it is affordable, the food tastes extremely authentic (and to be clear, it is very hard to find Dong Bei food in the Bay Area. Dong Bei means northeastern chinese food, which is an uncommon type of cuisine amongst the usual offerings like Sichuanese or Cantonese food). \n\nWe had all the specialty dishes that they offered (I am going off the chinese names here, so forgive me if they don't align with the English names on their menu): Beef Pancake Roll, Stir Fried Potato Slices, Sour Vegetable Soup with Lamb, Guo Bao Rou (thin slices of pork breaded with a crispy sweet outer layer). I'm sure I missed something here, but it wouldn't be hard for you to figure out which dishes are the specialty here. \n\nAgain, I was incredibly surprised by the quality and the portion size at Dong Bei Mama.

We lived together in Beijing for 3 years were we regularly ate at Dongbei-style restaurants. Dongbei cuisine is one of the \"8 great chinese cuisine\". What you can expect is great stews and super large portions for a cheap price. We got just that in this really authentic restaurant.\n\nThe staff was great. Facts : \n- everything we ordered was served in less than 10'\n- people next to us complained that the food was too spicy and they changed their plates right away.\n\nThe food was great too. There could be minor improvements but we were deeply satisfied anyway.\nWe ordered \n- Dongbei luandun : the flavor was great. The braised pork should be braised longer and its skin was a bit thick. Nevertheless it was the most comforting dish on the table. Try it out on a cold day for an even stronger effect.\n- Congyoubing : an onion pancake. Right on point.\n- Gongbao jiding : spicy chicken with peanuts. Peanuts were too soft, the rest was perfect. I really enjoyed this version of my favorite chinese food.\n- Shuizhuyu : spicy boiled fish. Was perfect for our taste.\n\n\nSide notes : \n\nYes it's going to be a bit greasy and oily. That's the way it's done there, were people have to go through freezing winters.\n\nI read some people complain about dishes which are not from Dongbei.\nIf you go to a Sichuan (spicy food from west China) restaurant in Beijing it isn't going to be the same as Sichuan, and that's normal. \nI personally believe the way they made the shuizuyu (boiled fish) or gongbao jiding (kungpao chicken) which are both from Sichuan is more accessible to \"westerners\" than the Sichuan super-spicy stuff. \nHence we felt the Sichuan dishes we ordered were great even though it might disappoint someone who experienced them in Sichuan.\nIf you are an expert stick with Dongbei dishes at a Dongbei restaurant.", "author": "Olivier T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-03", "description": "TLDR - Known for its beef rolls, but somewhat disappointing. Overall pretty average Chinese food\n\nI came with my family for a late 1:30PM lunch on the weekend. Still somewhat busy at that time but no wait. Plenty of parking around. The restaurant is a pretty standard Chinese restaurant. Big menu with both Chinese and English, as well as pictures for their more popular dishes, which was really helpful because I personally found their menu to be overwhelming with options.\n\nI mostly came just for the beef pancakes so I let my parents order everything else. Our group of 4 shared an appetizer, the beef pancakes, a stew, a veggie dish and a meat dish and found that to be plenty.\n\nOverall, decent Chinese food. Again, there's a lot on the menu so you aren't limited to one specific region of food. I didn't find anything to be particularly special and was sadly disappointed by the Yelp-loved beef pancakes.\n\n* 003 CHINESE BATH CHAP ($7.89) - 3/5\n11 slices of fatty pork cheek. Pretty typical Chinese cold appetizer\n\n* 030 EGGPLANT WITH HOMEMADE SAUCE ($11.89) - 2/5\nMeh. I should've known anything with \"homemade sauce\" in its name would be something doused in sauce. My parents ordered this and were disappointed as well. The sauce was very thick and overly sweet. The eggplant was surprisingly hard to eat too because the skin was tough rather than tender. \n\n* 046 STEWED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM ($11.89) - 4/5\nNothing super special about this dish but I thought it was still well executed and I enjoyed it the most out of everything we ordered. The chicken was very tender and lean, and the stew overall was very light. \n\n* 083 DUCKS NECK WITH CHILI SAUCE ($9.89) - 3/5\nDad ordered this because it's something familiar from his hometown. He enjoyed it but I wasn't that big of a fan. Duck neck meat is pretty lean but this dish is fried so it's a little greasy. There also isn't much meat on neck to begin with so it's really more fried bits than anything else. Flavor was good though - salty and a little numbing spicy but not too much so. \n\n* 151 SLICED BEEF PANCAKES ($7.89) - 3.5/5\nI came for these pancakes and unfortunately was a little disappointed. The pancake was a huge portion of 6 slices just as expected. What I wasn't expecting was the pancake to be crunchy and fried on the outside, which was very different from the beef pancake rolls I'm used to. It gave it some more texture contrast but made it greasier. The filling to pancake ratio could've been better too. I would've liked either more beef/cucumber and sauce or a thinner, less chewy pancake.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The black bean noodle hit the spot! I loved that they took the time to really chop the vegetables very small and bite size rather than a rough chop. The sauce was smoky, flavorful and not too salty. I was a happy camper! \n\nThe eggplant in house made sauce arrived looking very much like fatty pork, it was great eaten with rice but just a little bit oily like most eggplant dishes. \n\nPass on the vegetarian dumplings even though they were wrapped oh so beautifully in the shape of a leaf. The fillings was ok and the taste of the dumpling was nothing special in particular. \n\nThey make amazing fried tofu. Each parcel of the fried tofu was cut small and fried excellently, to the point where the crust was thick and crispy, a good ratio of custardy soft tofu and crunch. \n\nMy sister really enjoyed the mix mushroom pot, there was a nice smokey barbecue flavor going on and a generous variety of mushrooms. (not the cheap kind either, I'm looking at you white button mushroom) \n\nThe food came out ridiculously fast and our server was so attentive and sweet, we were debating if this became our new favorite Chinese food spot.

Luckily, Dong bei mama was able to take us. They have large round tables for serving large groups family style like traditional Chinese restaurants. \n\nWhile I like the convenience factor of this restaurant, I didn't particularly think any of the food was particularly good. I definitely would not recommend you check this place out for taste while there are so many other better options around. \n\none of the other reviewers classify this restaurant as \"Shanghainese\" that is completely incorrect. First of all: \"Dong Bei\" refers to the northeast region of China. Shanghai is in the South East region. \n\nThis place definitely serves a combination of more nothern-style food and common american chinese dishes and ABCs (American born chinese) would recognize. With that said, the food is still mediocre and much too oily.

This is the first restaurant in the past ten years that I've ever seen my mom want to go to two days in a row for dinner.  It's practically unheard of in my family.\n\nEvery other restaurant I've ever taken my mom to, no matter how expensive or how many stars on Yelp, she's always somehow found a way to complain about it a few hours after eating or the next day, or the next time we walk by a place, or even when we try a new place that reminds her of some place we tried before. \n\nSo of course I have to write a review for Dong Bei Mama!\n\nAll the food seems freshly prepped and the seasoning is very different from what I'm used to, but still enjoyable.  There seems to be a lot of depth of flavor and complexity.  We ordered a fried chicken wing dish and it just looked like fried chicken wings with a lot of peppers, but it wasn't super spicy, it had this nice smokey flavor, and it wasn't very super salty.  All their dishes that I tried that were fried, whether it was a dry fry or a fried with a glaze or sauce, it was still nice and crispy.  Soups are good and hearty.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive and they have pictures which helps.  I think I saw a lot of dishes that I never really heard of before so I think there's quite a bit of authenticity or tradition to what they make.  Their menu is also split up into regional dishes which is interesting and useful.  Great place to go to for variety.\n\nGood service, food comes out piping hot which makes me think it doesn't sit around for long after it's done being cooked.  All the staff seemed very nice.  My parents talked to them in mandarin.  I don't know how well they speak english, in case that could be a problem for you.  To be honest, my (senile?) dad was being very weird and commented on how handsome the waiter was, to the waiter, and to my surprise the waiter just smiled and tolerated it.\n\nIn terms of value, I felt like I was getting a really good amount of food for how much it costs.  Even my mom thought everything was a good value, which is also a very surprising thing to hear my mom say.  We spent about $50-$60 each day and that was about 4-6 different dishes each time, and was plenty of food with leftovers for three people.\n\nIt's nice to see a good \"authentic / traditional\" kind of restaurant with this kind of consistent quality.

Not having been to DBM before but always curious about it, I spent a long time looking over Yelp reviews and feel like my research paid off! My friends & I are big fans of Szechuan food and Mission Chinese Food (szechuan-influenced) and DBM has many similar dishes here as well as dishes from other regions of China.\n\nFirst of all, the portions are massive and you definitely want to try a bunch of different things so be sure to go with AT LEAST 4 people to make it fun! We went on a Saturday night and there were plenty of big tables open with lazy susans. No need to wait in long lines for the trendy restaurants on Clement Street when you're starving.\n\nNo one in our party was vegetarian but we all eat meat, just in small quantities, so you may prefer to order some meat dishes instead of veg/tofu (or maybe some noodles) but here's what we ordered for a table of 5 (plus white rice and complimentary hot tea) and it was the perfect amount of food and only came out to like $60 total. Seriously. And we enjoyed everything!\n\n1. *Cabbage/Pork/Vermicelli Soup* A massive steaming wok on the table with a sterno underneath, this is a Northern Chinese specialty unavailable at most other Chinese restaurants. Our waitress \"warned\" us it was sour but we all loved it! It kind of tasted like sauerkraut soup, with a delicious lemony and light broth. Be warned, the noodles are very long and kind of hard to serve and slurp.\n\n2. *Beef Pancake* A must try! A gigantic roll bigger than a burrito, cut into slices and plenty of food for 5/6. You only really need one piece each. The chewiness of the roll, sweetness from hoisin sauce, and crunchy coolness of the cucumbers made for nice contracting textures and flavors.\n\n3. *Spicy Chicken Wings* If you love Mission Chinese Food's numbing chicken wings these are like those (Szechuan style with tons of peppers on top) but cut in half, so they're smaller pieces of chicken. Satisfied our numbing spicy craving.\n\n4. *String Beans* One of my favorite Chinese dishes, DMB's is extra salty from those addictive fermented black beans and did not disappoint.\n\n5. *Salt & Pepper Tofu* Awesome crispy outside batter that made the dish, plus silky tofu inside. One of the best tofu dishes I've ever had.\n\nSome other reviews mentioned poor customer service - we did not experience that at all, our waitress was very nice, refilled our water, etc.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun Chinese restaurant in the Richmond for large group, especially at the last minute without reservations, Dong Bei Mama is a great spot to try!", "author": "Alissa A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-30", "description": "Props to the memorable and well-thought-out name... not sure how well \"Northeast Mom\" would have fared. Dong Bei Mama indeed specializes in Northern China cuisine, featuring unique dishes that aren't always on the menu at other Chinese restaurants like the bean sheets appetizer (very photogenic!), spicy pig ears (for adventurous souls), and that braised pork dish that looks like a giant pork belly masterpiece.\n\nDong Bei Mama is most well-known for the BEEF PANCAKE: it was the primary reason for our visit, and we noticed while walking out that literally every table had ordered it! Although it falls short of the title \"the best I've ever had\" (blame my 626 food adventures), it was unquestionably the most humongous. Couple the American portion size with the extra-crisp pan-fried cooking style, and it is quite filling. I would have liked more beef and less cilantro, as well as more sauce to balance out all the pan-fried-ness--though the ample cucumber does add a refreshing touch (neutralizing the heat, as explained by my rudimentary understanding of Chinese medicine)\n\nWe also got the XIAO LONG BIAO so it would seem somewhat more of a balanced meal than just beef pancake. (Okay not really, since the only veggies were the cucumber and cilantro in the wrap.) For a Northern Chinese restaurant, I expected good XLB, but I thought it was just okay and could have used more soup, thinner skin, and more flavorful pork. Then again,I set unrealistically high expectations based on legendary XLB behemoths like Crystal Jade and DTF. Dong Bei Mama's XLB were not terrible, but serve the purpose as another order-able dish. At the end of the day, it's still all about the beef pancake. \n\nAmbiance is decent, as a standard nice Chinese restaurant, not some obscure hole-in-the-wall and not a hip fusion place blasting clubbing music. The verdict? Comfy setting with classic comfort food. i.e. BEEF PANCAKE", "author": "Edna C."}

Located on always-busy Geary Blvd., Dong Bei Mama is a place you can't miss. The name alone is very memorable! I've dined in several times and each time I am reminded why I enjoy Chinese food so much. So let me get straight into a discussion about the food... In sum: it's fabulous!\n\nI have two favorites: their beef scallion wrap. This burrito-shaped cylinder can easily feed two for a meal or four as an appetizer. Thinly cut beef (with a little fat), scallion, and cucumber are sandwiched between a delicious fried Chinese pancake batter. Despite it being fried, somehow, it also tastes refreshing thanks to the veggies. The dried sauteed string beans is another not-to-miss dish. This is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and they do it very well at Dong Bei Mama. I recently tried their spicy beef noodle soup, and yes, it's very spicy -- at least for me. Each spoonful of the soup kicks you in the mouth. Their honey walnut shrimp is also quite good. And for some reason, I really enjoy the jasmine tea they brew. It's more floral than most complimentary jasmine teas at other restaurants.\n\nThe service is not bad. They're always friendly... might be forgetful at times (like bringing water or extra napkins out upon request)... but the food is too good for me to knock them for that. Plus, the prices... for San Francisco standards, this place is pretty reasonable. For example: a recent meal where I ordered the wrap, the string beans, and the soup came out to ~$22 (before tip). Oh, and a quick tip... they are very busy during weekday (and presumably weekend) lunch hours. At Noon, it's suddenly full and then by 1, it's mostly cleared out. Luckily the restaurant can hold quite a bit of people. \n\nNeedless to say, I recommend Dong Bei Mama and I continue to return for their consistently delicious dishes!", "author": "James Z."}

But there is the unintentional benefit of objectivity when I go back to seriously write my review and am better able to adjust expectations and impressions.\n\nSo now I write \"Does their meat lift, bro? Because it's consistently tough.\"\n\nMy friend and I came on a weekday evening to find a spacious, somewhat empty restaurant. We ordered two dishes, the first being the famous $7.89 H01 SLICED BEEF PANCAKES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dong-bei-mama-san-francisco?select=vzPL2dLrNduSquWsRw2kgA#8PoZjf3DJGH73JGSAgEP3Q). This is essentially a crispy, thick green onion pancake coated with a very thin layer of hoisin sauce (the sauce of my dreams) and wrapped around cold slices of Chinese-braised beef shank, long slivers of cucumber and chives, and cilantro. It is delicious: even though I wasn't hungry, I ate half of it anyway. Which means I'm either a liar or a pig...or both!\n\nReflecting back on the meal, I was surprised with how light they are with the hoisin sauce, and was pleasantly surprised with how unoily the green onion pancake was. The beef shank slices were a bit tough, but that's how they always are. For true objectivity, I really wanna try the beef pancake roll at Z&Y Restaurant in Chinatown. Dong Bei Mama needs some competition.\n\nNow the bro lifting realization came from our second dish, HUI GUO ROU, translated to twice-cooked pork (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dong-bei-mama-san-francisco?select=vzPL2dLrNduSquWsRw2kgA#vzPL2dLrNduSquWsRw2kgA). The dish is full of bell peppers, onions, leeks, and long strips of pork belly. Overall, it was a good dish, but I think I'm more a fan of once-cooked pork because I found the meat to be tough and chewy, as if I was eating bacon.\n\nAs for the service, the wait staff are fast and speak both English and Mandarin (a rarity, I know). They're prompt about refilling your tea (remember to use the Asian signal of the open lid) and cleaning your table. $20 credit card minimum, and they have 2 bathrooms in the back, 1 for ladies and 1 for gents.\n\nMy friend, who hails from Northern China, says this restaurant serves legit Northern Chinese food. And when I think about Northern China, I think about Genghis Khan. Now I can associate Northern China with not only tough men, but tough meat too.", "author": "Adele F."}

We were excited to try a lot of things on the menu with nice big selections of everything from Northwestern Chinese to Sichuan cuisine. We ordered the spicy beef intestines as appetizer, the cumin lamb ribs, sour cabbage dumplings and for dessert, the fried sweet potato wedges coated in thick sugar. \nThe spicy beef intestines had a nice Sichuan pepper spice to it, but not overwhelming to the tongue like many other places would make it. The price was also very reasonable for the quantity.\nThe cumin lamb ribs were yummy, not the same type of stir fried lamb pieces in other Sichuan restaurants. This one is more like a grilled rib with cumin spices sprinkled on top, not marinated through.\nThe sour cabbage dumplings with pork were good, I had one piece since I was already quite stuffed at this point! Fairly authentic since I'm from the Northwest and my grandma would marinate sour cabbage when I grew up.\nThe sweet potato wedges were my favorite! It is quite rare to find around the SF area since this is a very Northwestern dish, so not many restaurants serve this or do it the right way. They serve it with a bowl of ice water. You are supposed to pull off a piece of sweet potato from the dish and dip it into the ice water so that the outside will harden and become crispy, SOOOO GOOD! VERY authentic indeed. Each piece is sticky and the sugar coating forms thin sticks connecting each piece to the other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-02", "description": "I really really like the food here. Had written a review about it in 2013, and had been coming here from time to time. But there are a few new observations.\n\nTo order in a restaurant attempting to please every kind of diner, go for their intended regional speciality. And speak perfect Mandarin in Beijing accent when ordering. That's what you'll need to dine well here. \n\nI very rarely eat Chinese food with anyone, mainly because my folks make them way better at home. But there are a few things this restaurant has no other places in the bay area has. The cabbage with pork ribs soup is a better option according to the extremely helpful and polite staff. She's from northeastern China, one of the three provinces, I'm guessing Liaoning, could be wrong but that accent is not from Heilongjiang, my cultural heritage. If you speak proper Mandarin, as in with perfect Beijing accent as I did, she'll be very helpful. Ask her what to get between the green beans and the cabbage, she tells me that she'd go for the cabbage, as the green beans would have been cooked too long. I wholeheartedly agree. My grandma used to make this. It came as in a pot that filled with yam noodles and soup, white soup that was so delicious for a cold winter day. My companion is a Midwestern transplant, and he was so delighted. For a white guy he was very adventurous and I was impressed that he liked the dish. \n\nI ordered the bean sheet salad. It's less than $10 and it's exactly what I liked, things like that only made by my father during Chinese New Year. And the egg omelette salad that is part of the dish was as good as it gets. It's slimy. Unless you grew up in Manchuria and had that as a kid, I suspect you won't like it. But if you were like me and had that dish growing up, this is as good as it gets, better than most of the northeastern Chinese restaurants I have eaten at in Southern China or Beijing. They make it spicy too, with Sichuan peppers, so it's a nice twist to an otherwise completely northern dish. I'd skip the shrimp or the ham, and instead of it, I'd add the Moscow sausage or the blood sausage from Europa Plus which is just down the street. In Northeastern China, our food has a lot of Russian and German influences, stemmed from its close proximity (Russia) and prior colonial influence (Germany). \n\nThe last but not the least is the beef onion pancake. It has sliced cucumber and cilantro, plus the marinated and thinly sliced beef. It's a better version than what I'd get in Beijing, though very Americanized, as in the size is huge.\n\nPortion and value are unprecedented in the bay area, and I'd venture to say, the quality of ingredients and the preparation are far more superior than most of the northeastern restaurants I've dined at in China. \n\nThree things we ordered that night: cabbage and pork rib soup, the beef pancake, the bean sheets salad. We ate until we were about to explode from fullness. And then we took the rest of home. We got two extra meals out of it. \n\nThe lady who served us was quite nice. She reminded me of the kind hearted, well mannered northerners that I met when I was a young girl and visited / lived in Manchuria. It's a very rare sight. I suspect my impeccable Beijing accent made her at ease as well. But being half northerner myself, I know the hospitality of northerners is famous in China, it really makes dining out a treat. \n\nThere are many dishes to get here. Like I said, it's a crowd pleaser and they do what they can to attract different types of diners. It is trying to do too much. Sichuan, Cantonese, Yunan and Northeastern food. They cannot be good at everything. I would not go there for those regional cuisines if you know what the restaurant's name meant: \"Northeastern Mother\". You go there to order the food that the northeastern Chinese eat: think home made sauerkraut, stewed cabbage, and noodles. \n\nThe three things we ordered seemed to shine above other things, it feels like that these could be their signature dishes. They did those dishes extremely well and food arrived super fast.\n\nA few nights ago I couldn't sleep and I was browsing Yelp's photos of the restaurant. I sent him photos and reviews of this place. He said to me, \"You really want to go there, we should go there, you miss home.\" \n\nI'm not sure if I was missing home. I was probably missing my childhood in Manchuria, and my grandparents and my father who made those dishes for me growing up. That evening after dinner I slept very well. Curled up like a baby and did not wake up until 8. I think my grandparents who were now heaven, they were watching over me that night, and they were smiling because I have finally found a place in America that made food just like they did.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Very clean, not overly greasy like other places, tasted fresh and the string beans were even crunchy, because they made them right there and then. Delicious!!!

My boyfriend and I were shocked by how gigantic they were compared to the ones we usually get back in SoCal. Thankfully, my boyfriend thought they were authentic enough for his liking.

No wonder a lot of tour buses drop their customers here for lunches.\n\nWe ordered the noodles with meat sauce, the oil braised bamboo shoots, bean sprouts sauteed with garlic, the lamb steamed dumplings, the sliced beef wrapped in pancake and the xiao long bao.

We got the beef pancake, dong  bei pork leg, Westlake beef soup, salt and pepper tofu, preserved Napa with pork belly, and sizzling rice three delecasies.\n\nThe beef pancake is a must. It was very unlike other beef pancakes I have had because they basically put what you'd get with Peking duck wraps inside a green onion pancake with thinly sliced beef. So good!\n\nThe dong bei pork leg was very tender but other than that, not too special.\n\nThe Westlake beef soup was great. A small size is already pretty big and enough for 5 people.\n\nThe salt and pepper tofu was the way you'd expect it to be. Some pieces were a little too oily/soggy but overall still good.\n\nThe sizzling rice three delecasies was interesting. It's like that one dish where you have crispy noodles and you pour sauce over it to get it soft but you still have the crunch but instead of noodles, this dish had rice. Good.\n\nNow, the manager (I think?) Recommended the preserved Napa with pork belly. I've had this at other restaurants before. It was a different name on the menu so I didn't know what to expect until it came and I heard the waiter say the name of it in chinese. I normally don't like this dish because of the sour vegetables and this time was no different. I thought it was redundant for her to have recommended a soup when we already ordered one but she was raving about how it was the food of her country and made it sound like it was a must try so we gave it a shot. Not worth it unless you actually really like preserved Napa (suan cai).\n\nI enjoyed all the food we chose but not so much the recommendation.\n\nAll those dishes plus rice came out to about 60 dollars which to me was pretty reasonable.

In fact, not only do I personally bring my Chinese friends visiting here, a large portion of DBMM's business is from Chinese tour groups who come all the way to America and eat here (that's when you know it's authentic!).\n\nThe food is Northern cuisine (much more flavorful, garlic/leek-heavy vs. Cantonese/Americanized places) and you should definitely venture out of your Chinese food comfort zone when ordering here, since many of their best dishes are ones that a typical Chinese restaurant won't even have.

Classic Chinese dish with a lot of flavor and really tender meat\n+ Preserved napa with lamb is a traditional Northern dish and one of their specialties.

It's okay as a chicken dish (could be better cooked), but the spicy sauce really makes it shine.\nLocal flavor lamb: They cook it well so that it's not too gamey. Comes with a bunch of veggies too, and some jalapeno slices are tossed in when they stir-fry it (I assume that's how it's made) so it has a little kick to it.\nSweet and sour fish: I'm not sure if that's the right name, but this dish is AMAZING. I don't like fish very much (it's either sashimi or it's got to be fried for me to eat it), but this is so good. The fish filets seem to be beer battered (or something similar) then tossed in the sweet and sour sauce--yum! Eat it quick because if you let it sit, the fried coating does get soggy.

The stuff is clearly meant to be shared, because I wouldn't have been able to eat the huge bowl of tofu myself, despite it being nice, spicy and delicious.\n\nThe pork belly, though spicy, wasn't the best I've had because it lacked a certain tenderness or something; I can't really figure out why I didn't like it very much.  I liked the pan-fried pork bun (imagine a regular bao, but pan-fried on the bottom to give it a crust), but since we had two each, it was too filling.  The filling was juicy and flavorful, and the bread on the outside was soft.\n\n3.5 stars rounded up, because while their food wasn't the greatest, it wasn't bad either.  We figured that we just ordered the wrong things - clearly Sichuan food isn't their specialty.  Definitely will be back to try other things on the menu.\n\nOh and hi, they take credit cards with a $20 minimum.  That alone earns it the extra half star.", "author": "Tori S."}

DB Mama has an extensive menu including a page of appetizers, a page of Sichuan specialties, iron platters, noodle soups, stews, clay pots, etc. They don't shy away from pork blood or intestines. The cold appetizers that they had at the back looked fantastic. The flour pancake rolled around sliced beef looked amazing (saw it after we ordered).\n\nThe clientele is mainly Chinese. It's a large space with huge tables (and smaller ones). Every table seemed to have a hot pot or some type of casserole over an open flame. Dongbei cuisine is known for hot pots, dumplings, and buns.\n\n* Local flavor lamb: Thin, large pieces of tender lamb saut\u00e9ed with huge jalapeno pieces, peppers, onions, had a lot of flavor, a little spicy, a bit too salty but tasty\n\n* Happy family with fish ($13.89): I haven't seen these corn cake casseroles (a Dongbei dish) on the menu for a long time and I'm still a fan. This one features a light, bubbling broth with a whole fish, chunks of soft tofu in wok placed over a burner. The corn cakes (like man tou only made with corn meal) are on a separate plate. The fish is tender and mild. The stew looks bland but it's a nice, homey dish. The corn cakes were on the small side and not as good as the ones I had before.\n\n* Beijing yogurt drink ($2.50) - a thick yogurt drink, tart but with a bit of sweetness, so good, love having this with a meal.

Yes, after 5 consistent year's Yelp de-Elited me.  Note: I was pretty much the only Asian where I was previously living, so had to go into hiding--writing anything but nice reviews was difficult.\n\nBUT, Dong Bei Mama is just too good not to get a rave review.  Stumbled in here on a Sunday evening for dinner.  There were already several parties at 7pm, but by 7:30pm just about a full house.\n\nEnjoyed:\n-Cold spicy pig ears + cold spice beef tendon & beef: if you like the numbing flavor of sichuan peppercorns, these are your dishes to order!  While there still was oil, it seemed like somehow they dialed back the oiliness, almost as if it was thickened somehow.\n-Beef onion pancake: One family had the right idea to get two orders!  While the pancake I thought could have been a tad thinner, it was quite flavorful.\n-Smoked pork belly w/ garlic leaves: The standout dish of the meal! Smoky and great flavors.  Could have fooled me--the supposed garlic leaves seemed like leeks.  Nevertheless would order this again!\n-Dry fried green beans: Interesting twist on what I'm used too--these ones had fermented black beans.  Delicious!\n-Spicy whole fish (catfish): Our least favorite of the meal.  Unfortunately it came out more \"warm\" than piping hot.  Felt like the value wasn't there for the money either.\n\nI think we even met the Dong Bei Mama with her bright dyed hair.  She was super friendly and seemed to accept my broken Mandarin.

She noticed how much time we were spending with the menu and came and made several recommendations, asking us what types of food we like, giving estimates on portions and how much we should order, and was very genuine about wanting us to really enjoy our meal.

Apologies for not knowing the actual dish names. I literally browsed through menu and as I heard my friends talking about dishes, I basically put the menu down and let them have at it.\n\nThe point is, the dishes we got were all very flavorful and delicious.  The beef wrapped in pancake/roti-like bread was awesome.  The pork belly chunks in the hot pot were also delicious.  I pretty much could eat any of those dishes again, if only what they were actually called.  The sauteed tofu/pork was a little bit spicy (I was worried it'd burn my tongue off, but I was ok). \n\nMinus one star for the flavorless cornbread like muffins that came with the soup and the buns for having a high bun to filling ratio.  Overall though, the food was good and I left happy (and full!).  The whole meal cost us only $13.50 each.

And for months I hadn't even considered stepping foot into it.  I think it was the name that threw me off... if I don't know how to pronounce it or why there's a Mama in its name, I didn't think it was for me.\n\nBut on a whim, my parents visited me and decided to try some place close... yeah 40 steps close.  They speak very limited English here!  And even if you're Cantonese, you might as well just speak English to them here!  This is considered North Eastern Chinese food... in the region known as Manchuria.  The key here is to look at what everyone is ordering and if it looks good, ask your waiter what that is.  \n\nThe must order was the Sliced Beef Pancake Roll.  A large onion pancake spread with hoisin and rolled with sliced beef, cucumbers, and scallions!  It's a filler so share with a group of 4.  This region of China does not specialize in rice, so do not order fried rice or any rice dish here.  Their specialties are noodles and dumplings.  Also don't assume XLB or soup dumplings would be good here... that's Shanghai.  This region would do better with simple boiled dumplings -- pork w/ chives or pork w/ napa cabbage is the solid standby.  I'll have to try their pan fried dumplings soon!\n\nMuch of the tables had a casserole going on... mini stoves were set up in each table so you could serve your stewy soupy bits piping hot!  Manchuria is so far north, it definitely gets freezing there. So these stove dishes would be great for cold weather. \n\nif you are adventurous, step up to their corner counter that displays cold appetizers ranging from pickled daikon salad to pressed pork cheeks that looks look tiny stained glass windows with their clear offal parts and skin.  Everything here is so reasonable it'd be a loss to you if you didn't try whatever looked curious!  This region has clean flavors that are often spicy... nothing too stinky.  \n\nIf you come during lunchtime you may see bus loads of Chinese tourist filling up half of the large dining room.  When I was there it was very apparent they were from mainland China and they were so happy to see familiar food.  They ate fast and knew exactly what was what... a good sign of authenticity.", "author": "Chris T."}

It is quite sour, but also very flavorful, and reminds me of Polish food, in a good way.\n\nI have to admit my favorite thing at Dong Bei Mama is still the Fish Fillet with Tofu in Spicy Sauce. It's on the Sichuan menu, and it's little more than steamed cod and tofu covered in chili oil, but the cod is really good and the tofu is really silky. I don't know. I can eat that thing every day.\n\nI'd also recommend the Beef with Yam, Da Lu Noodle (soup), the Egg and Pepper Black Bean Noodle and the Spicy Noodle Cooked with Ground Pork Sauce (which I think was only on the Panda Country menu, but they still make it). They are all large portions best for sharing. \n\nI also love the Sauteed Singua, but fair warning... most of the menu is made Family Style and some dishes are just giant plates of one thing.

Not for the ambiance, of course, but then again when do you ever go to a Chinese restaurant for the ambiance?\n\nThe one dish alone that makes a trip here worth it is the sliced beef pancake roll. This is my absolute favorite dish -- no exaggeration. Technically it's a northern Chinese dish, but it's been popularized also in Taiwan. It consists of sliced spiced roast beef, green onions, cilantro, and hoisin sauce, all wrapped in a scallion pancake. I can't emphasize how tasty it is when it's done right. I also can't emphasize how difficult it is to find in the Bay Area. To my knowledge there isn't a single other restaurant in SF that serves it. You have to go down to San Mateo, Cupertino, or even Milpitas to find decently-made ones.\n\nBut the best part about the dish here is that, not only are the ingredients perfectly proportioned, but that the entire dish itself is HUGE. Typically it's served as an appetizer maybe to be split between 2 or 3 people. The one here though is more like a medium pizza -- even with a party of 6 I had to eat an extra slice and a half for us to finish the whole thing.\n\nThe rest of the dishes we ordered were delicious. We had Sichuan-style boiled fish and fried diced chicken, as well as sauteed pea pod sprouts, fatty pork with bok choy, and a clear rice noodle with veggies. All this we washed down with a couple bottles of Tsingtao.\n\nDespite coming here on a busy night (the Saturday before CNY), our dishes came out incredibly fast.

The restaurant is somewhat clean, perhaps because it's still a little new and you probably don't have to wait for a table at all.  \n\nThe food is actually not bad.  I've tried the beef wrap, an assortment of dumplings, which are both good.  The beef noodle soup is actually my favorite that I've had here.  Beef stew makes anything taste good and the broth is a little salty, but not overboard.  The spicy seafood soup with the hot oil is also tasty.  I did choke twice drinking the spicy soup because it does have a kick to it, but it's not so spicy that I can't take it.\n\nThe service here is awful.  I don't know if they just don't understand English or what.  Depends what server you get.  One woman I asked for a straw.  She said okay and I watched her wander into the little kitchen area, slowly walk around in circles and never came back.  I think she knew I was watching her too.  She just completely ignored us after that.  On the same visit, I asked a waiter for a fork and a knife.  He nodded.  He got the fork right, but he brought out an entire container of sugar... Huh???

The shanghai dumplings were the frozen kind and were not close to mimicking Kingdom of Dumpling's frozen dumplings.  The skin would just deteriorate and was very soggy.  The green onion pancake was good but the ones from Little Beijing blows it out of the water.  The hot and sour with pork noodle soup was way too salty.  Try going to Taiwan (restaurant) for that.  These are the bare standards of north eastern chinese food and it simply does not cut it if they can't excel at any one of them.\n\nBottom line: Look elsewhere.", "author": "Allen T."}

I've been to a lot of terrible restaurants, but it was the first time i'd been to one that served vomit-inducing \"food\"\n\nit was also expensive.  ~$35-40 for the two dishes and some undercooked rice.  \n\ni hate when i waste money on disgusting food.", "author": "Candy Y."}

We went in around 12:30pm on a Monday and there were only two other tables.  We ordered their Dong Bei styled chicken, steamed cod (or of that sort), and bok choy with mushrooms.  The fish was the best dish out of the three, but that's no compliment because all the other Chinese restaurants I've been to are better.  The sauce on the mushroom and bok choy dish was way to salty/heavy despite the steamed bok choy.  The chicken dish was horrible, there were parts of the chicken that were hard to chew and the whole dish was so bland that I had to add salt.  Now for the worst part: the rice was too hard/stale!  I know a lot of the rice in restaurants are towards the hard side, but this was really bad.  My mom, who has a sensitive stomach, later felt ill due to the hard rice and my stomach, which has an impressive digestive system, felt a little discomfort as well.  \n\nNeedless to say, I will never come back here again...  There are plenty of other authentic Chinese restaurants out there in the Sunset area.\n\nNote: Right after we sat down, a group of tourists came in a flurry.  It seems that the restaurant has a deal with the tourism company to have lunch here because food was brought out to them immediately.  They were loud and someone at one point was smoking (wtf?!).", "author": "Joy Z."}

I love the beef with noodles and the mapo tofu. The free unlimited tea is nice, and the hundreds of Chinese tourists bussed in gives it a great atmosphere.", "author": "Sarah B."}

I have tried many chinese restaurants in the city, and this one have some of the best mainland food (assuming you like authentic not-americanized Chinese food).  The restaurant used to be a Si Chuan food restaurant, and the food was even better then.  Now their menus are more extensive and they put all their si chuan food on the last page of the menu - that's where I go.", "author": "J. B."}

Their cooking style sets them apart, it's not the typical Americanized Chinese place.  They serve authentic regional dishes with their own style. I like their shredded potato dish.", "author": "David F."}
