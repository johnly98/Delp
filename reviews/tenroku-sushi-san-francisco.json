You'll avoid the hassle of waiting.\n\nThis restaurant was smaller than I expected, but I liked the layout. The sushi chefs were in the middle while the seats were arranged around them. The conveyor belt was constantly filled with sushi, and there's a menu you can look at to decide which color plate responds to what price... or if you want to order off the menu directly rather than grabbing it from the conveyor belt.\n\nThe sushi was good, and the portion size was decent (3/plate usually). I thought the price was good for Japantown, so I'd probably come back! Eat here when you feel like trying different sushi rolls without having to eat the whole roll.", "author": "Aileen J."}

Mucho dinero. \n\nThe fish quality is pretty great. Thicccc cuts of sashimi are available like hamachi, salmon or chutoro. I can easily just eat plates and plates of the sashimi and be done with it. If only it didn't cost so much to get the fancier things...$15 for a whole tray of Uni, worth? You decide.\n\nIf you can, get the plates right when the chefs put them out because some of the items, like the oysters, have been rotating around for hours and are very questionable. The temperature isn't regulated so who knows if they even remove the ones that have been sitting there for a long time. \n\nThe rice? A hugeeee miss. It's hard, crunchy and cold. I found myself picking off the fish from the rice. Might as well have ordered the sashimi then. \n\nThe rolls? Easy to fill up on to save a little bit of money, but nothing too special about it.\n\nIt's very easy to get carried away pulling things off the conveyor belt. I ended up spending $45 because I wanted to try most of the items. Ended up getting at least 3 plates of chutoro and 1 uni, whoops. \n\nOverall, not bad if you come and fill up on the rolls and order a few gourmet items. Otherwise, nothing to brag home to your mama about.", "author": "Nancy L."}

The many times I've walked through J-town I've never noticed place until I had relatives visiting and my aunt pointed it out. Normally I have tunnel vision when I have a plan going somewhere. We waited about 5 minutes before getting seated. I honestly don't remember the time of day it was but it wasn't all that busy. \n\nI thought the food was pretty adequate. Some things are fresher than others, I don't know if some of the items that I picked had be on the conveyor for awhile but no #3's to follow so that's a good sign. I like the chart telling you much each plate is because you go nuts on grabbing a bunch. My favorite thing that I got was the toro and sweet shrimp. The cut of toro was so thick and fatty, I absolutely loved it and the sweet shrimp wasn't as firm so it's not the freshest but still good to eat nonetheless.\n\nFor sure this is a place I would come by again if it wasn't crowded. I don't think I'd wait long to come and eat here but it will be a fun experience none the less to grab your food from the conveyor.", "author": "Andrew T."}

The restaurant is a rotating sushi belt, with different colored plates that have different pricing. Each plate had different types of sushi and rolls, and had about 2-3 pieces depending on the roll costing from $2.74-$10 per plate. I think that you will get a better bang for your buck if you go to a restaurant that makes the sushi when ordered. My brother and I also saw some of the same plates of sushi rotating for the whole time we were eating. I also think that at the end of the day, i am only guessing that probably have a lot of food that gets wasted. Not sure I would want to come back.", "author": "Patricia L."}

Came here for lunch during the Cherry Blossom festival so it was packed! Lots of places didn't allow dogs unless they're in a stroller...... except here so we settled.

Food came out in a timely manner and service was great from our waitress June. She was super accommodating, friendly, and checked in on us frequently- never felt neglected from sitting outside. Camie, another waitress, was really nice too and gave my pup a plastic bowl for water. For food, we tried a mix of raw and hot:\n\n- Chicken Karage ($8): Pretty good! Ask for spicy mayo\n- Geso Karage ($8): very little portion \n- Snow Crab Roll ($15) not real crab...\n- Nigiri's (2pc/order): \n   Sake ($5.25): not fresh \n   Hirame ($4.25): sinew and not fresh \n   Hotate ($6.50): ok.

I haven't been to Tenroku before and actually can't remember ever having sushi in all the years I've gone to Japantown. Crazy huh? \n\nWell, we were recommended this place by a friend and so we came here before starting our Saturday night. First impression- small spot, probably seats 30 people at most. There's like 3 waitresses and the rest of the workers are in the middle making sushi. \n\nOne thing I noticed was that there were a lot of pre-made sushi just waiting to join the conveyer belt.  I can't say how long they've been there but it was very efficient. Not too sure how fresh it was though...this was one thing that bothered me. \n\nI will say that their seared salmon nigiri was yummy. It was the only thing I ate actually since everything else was doused in sauce or was a basic roll like California rolls. Plates are marked by color for price and the seared salmon is the second most expensive at $5.75 per plate. \n\nOverall, probably wouldn't come back.

Also if you want something that you don't see on the belt, you can just ask the waitor for it. There were a lot of rolls going around. I'm a sashimi person so I was just looking for sashimi. I caught a salmon sashimi dish once and then it never appeared again so I ordered it with the waitor and also red clam sashimi. The salmon was cut very thick, which is okay but the red clam wasn't very fresh to me. \n\nOverall, if you want to try a bit of this and that with small portion, go for it!

This was the worst mistake ever. Everything was fine until we were seated. When we arrived at our seats, we were served ginger for our sushi but we noticed that there were no wasabi. We figured perhaps not everyone is a fan of wasabi so for those who want it, needs to ask for it. To our surprise, when we asked for some wasabi, the chefs looked at us funny and turn around and huddled up to discuss our \"request.\" Turns out, every plate were meant to be served with ginger and wasabi but our plates were missing wasabi. This should have been a red flag but we understand that mistakes happen, especially on a busy night. No big deal.\n\nHowever, we were extremely wrong. Half way through our meal, we noticed that our water has yet to be served but other guests had their drinks, even the couple who was seated after us! Not only that, but we were also lacking our menu. This was very frustrating because it was ruining our night as we had to ask for everything when we noticed that other guests did NOT have to. You figured that the bad service would end there right? Nope, you were mistaken. When it was time for the bill, I asked the waitress if I could have my tea refilled and she confirmed my request. The bill came but my tea was never refilled.

I really wanted to give the food a chance but I could get myself to swallow the noodles. Forcing myself to eat it made it taste worse.\n\nSERVICE: HORRID\n\nHere's the best part -- server never checked on our table, we had to waive them down each time. Our food took forever to arrive -- and when it did, the timing was far apart from each other's order. (two stars knocked off). When we flagged down the server to inform her of our blandness and poorly made ramen, she said \"I'm sorry\" takes our bowls and walks off. Did not even give us options for something else nor did she wanted to know why we didn't like them. Our bowls were still FULL to the top and you aren't curious as to why we asked for you to take them back?? (see my photos) AND, it wasn't just one person -- TWO of us brought it to your attention. This is a $12 bowl of Ramen so I expect the quality to match up. (two stars knocked off)My brothers were disappointed with the service when the two of us inquired so they just forced the noodles down.\n\nThey had the audacity to add it to our bill (once again, we had to flag them down to obtain our bill). When I questioned the server --\"What do you do when your customers are dissatisfied with their food?\" Her response \"everyone has different taste\" and left it at that -- are you kidding me? I asked her once again in another way \"What is the protocol when a customer doesn't like their food?\" -- she grabbed the second server, stared at the her hoping she could respond to her or give us a response. After an awkward minute of staring and no response. Then I politely asked to speak to their manager, she responds \"No manager is here today.\" Me: \"Ok... who can I talk to?\" Server: \"Uh.. we are all equals here\" -- so she was indirectly telling me that there was no supervisor on duty but that didn't answer my question. Again, the 2 servers stared at each other hoping one of the two would step up and respond to us (awkward silence) mumbled something under their breath and walked off. (3 stars knocked off).\n\nAt this point I was upset, but I remained calm. I just wanted to know what is their protocol for a dissatisfied customer. We were still going to pay for the ramen even if I only took 3 bites of it. Within a few minute, the server scurries to our table and says \"we'll cancel your order\" and rushes away with our bill and brings back the revised bill and change - NO EYE CONTACT --we are not trying to harm nor hurt you, we just wanted to express our concerns. But it looks like they took it personally (any more stars to knock off?)\n\nThese servers were young and inexperienced -- I blame their supervisor for not training them properly with customer service or establishing a protocol to invite feedback. How would do you expect your business to grow without customer feedback? Even though this is not a Ramen House -- I expected the food quality and service to be up to par with their prices. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING, NOT EVEN TO TRY THE SUSHI. Not worth my money.", "author": "Luc L."}

None of the dishes are labeled on the train which makes it hard to pick a plate and when you do it's likely you'll have grabbed a roll you didn't want.\n\nIt was also on the pricier side. Most rolls that we're on the conveyer belter we're 4-5 each. So to really get a you'll meal for me would be 4 plates and you're already at 20 dollars before tip. I've been to similar restaurants with cheaper plates that I thought were higher quality.\n\nThe service was also inconsistent. My friend I was with ordered a roll and as we were getting the check it finally came.

For their price, the quality is very good and they usually have an excellent variety going around too, including interesting combinations I've never seen at any other sushi place.\n\nSome of their best plates: $8(!!!)otoro, uni, ikura with quail egg, unagi, oysters, and any of their seared sushi.\n\nIn comparison to the other conveyor belt sushi place in the same mall, Isobune, I definitely recommend Tenroku over it. Tenroku's plates are overall cheaper but, in my opinion, also higher quality. I also prefer their conveyor belt over Isobune's since it is slower and you can see dishes on the other side of the belt, giving you ample time to decide what you want to get. \n\nTheir sushi chefs, especially Cesar, are all incredibly friendly and will gladly make anything you ask for.\n\nNot a great place for large groups since it is mostly seats at the counter around the belt.

No water refills. Crammed seating and absolutely no customer service @ all. \n\nI haven't been to a conveyer belt sushi restaurant since living abroad in Singapore (around 2008). I have passed this restaurant on my way to pika-pika (multiple photo booth shop) and never dared to try it out. Today, I figured to go in with my boyfriend and try their sushi out.\n\nBy default you're seated @ the sushi bar / conveyer belt unless you request for a table. It takes away from the experience and reason to come into the restaurant. \n\nThere really wasn't many plates out that looked appetizing or worth \"the grab.\" Eventually the chef put out some dishes and they were snatched up pretty fast. I can't tell you the exact Rolls we had except the two Spider rolls i ordered with our waitress.\n\nOur waitress never came to refill our water cups nor did she ask us if we wanted any other rolls. It was frustrating because everyone on my left and right had no water. This restaurant is small in size so getting to customers wasn't much of a hassle.\n\nI checked in from the moment I walked in but didn't scroll to read the 'warning- poor food...' \n\nI understand the whole idea of sushi sitting on plates for x amount of hours... & how it may deter people from this restaurant.

After hanging out at the Walt Disney museum, we headed over to Japan town to grab some sushi.  After walking around the area, we settled on Tenroku.  We had a party of 8 (4 adults and 4 kids), and the space is a bit small so we sat at the tables in front and did not sit in front of the conveyor belt.  The waitresses were very helpful and told us we can walk up to the sushi boat area and bring the items back to our table. \n\nWe ordered a few things off the menu and then took turns heading to the sushi boat area and bringing the items back to our table.   The sushi was actually surprisingly good.  My husband loved their blue fin tuna and I loved their rolls.  My little one loved their beef teriyaki and finished his whole plate which is not common unless his food is really good.  We also shared a bottle of large sake amongst the group.   \n\nWe had such an enjoyable experience that my family and I returned to the restaurant the following week.

Its the food thats an issue. \n\nNow with sushi, you want your fish to fresh all the time, here however, the sushi is not fresh. All the raw fish offerings look grey and felt warm to the touch. The fish was not fresh and when you have a sushi circling around the belt over and over , you need to remove it and put out fresh sushi instead. They did not do that. The same sushi pieces were rotating on the belt over and over until some poor soul grabbed that old piece and then the chefs finally placed a new sushi order out. \n\nThe sushi here did not taste great either and for the price you pay it is not worth it.

Last time we went to this place there was a facial hair in our sushi and the server quickly said she was sorry and removed the order. We didn't make a big deal about it and continued to dine. This time however was the last straw, my wife pulled a raw piece of Halibut and thank goodness noticed there was a worm that was roughly 3 centimeters long. I'm not a worm expert but with raw fish all I can think of is it being something like a tapeworm. We stopped eating and told the sever saying this time we wanted to leave and said we are not paying. It's not something I usually do but we both now feel like vomiting and hope we don't have any issues with a parasite and need to go to the hospital. Before we left I told their staff they can not serve this to guest and I highly suggest they go over all over their fish to make sure it's ok.

I thought it was too good to be true so the first thing I did was ask the hostess about this deal.  After she confirmed it to be very true we decided to give this place a try.  \n\nIt's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.  It's small and cozy.  You sit along side the conveyor belt like it's a bar and you take whatever sushi you like off the belt or you can order it thru the waitress or chef.  The plates on the conveyor belt are color coded to be a specific price.\n\nSo the first thing I order is obviously the tray of Uni.  It really was a whole tray of Uni for only $10 so I was adding Uni to everything.  I even added Uni to my udon and it was so delicious.  They set aside only a # of trays for the $10 deal so once it's out it won't be available until their next shipment.  The sushi was pretty good and their pricing is not bad at all.  \n\nI still have doubts about all sushi restaurants that do this conveyor belt type of service.  I love the experience because it's cool and fun but I also can't get that thought out of my head about how long that sushi may have been rotating around on that belt with nothing to keep it refrigerated.

In terms of quality this place is just okay. The fish did not taste too fresh since some of it had been sitting on the belt for awhile without being chilled. I'm not sure how often they switch it out.\n\nThe prices are actually pretty high and I felt like I spent too much money without even feeling full. Plates range from $2-$10 depending on the color but most of the good plates like salmon or eel over rice were about $5-6 each. That adds up quickly since each plate doesn't have much on it. The toro was 2 slices for $7 and the quality was mediocre.\n\nOverall I probably wouldn't try this place again unless I wanted to show someone the novelty of conveyer belt sushi. The one plus is that you can start eating right away without waiting for your food. We spent about $55 total for 2 people and were still not full afterwards.", "author": "Linda X."}

The A/C should be ice cold if they have sushi out without refrigeration. \n\nService (*** out of *****); Not bad service, but considering that this was very expensive sushi, it should've been more than essentially self-service cafeteria style.

The o-toro is very good here and they sear it and put crunchy onions on top and give it a great sour taste. The wait is not too long and the seating is comfortable only a little bit squished.

The sushi here isn't bad and the fish are pretty fresh for a sushi boat place. It is pricey compared to Sakana Bune on Geary, but normal compared to a traditional sit-down restaurant. The plates range from $2.25 to $10 for the special items; most plates were in the $5 range. I think the blue fin nigiri was $5 (2 pcs). They also have ramen, udon and donburi on their menu but didn't really take a look at that. The bill for 2 came out to be $55 before tip -- I don't think we had more than 10 dishes total? =X I will confess that I did grab a $7 plate teehee\n\nThe overall selection is pretty good considering they put uni and amaebi right on the belt. They also had some interesting nigiri on the belt -- one looked to be seared salmon topped with roe and uni.

But I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at Tenroku and how efficiently this kaiten-zushi worked. 'Kaiten' refers to a conveyor belt operation which I much prefer over the more Disneyland-derived sushi boat concept where subpar places like Sushi Umi on Bush attract bothersome gnats to their artificial waterways. First of all, I like the see-through plastic lids they use over each small plate that comes by (photo: http://bit.ly/1MJ2YRJ). They accommodate the germophobe in all of us (or frankly should be in all of us), and of course like the boat flotillas, the plates come in eight different colors to indicate the prices which range from $2 to $6.\n\nThey also have a big off-the-belt menu, too, and I took advantage by ordering the $6 Ankimo 'cause I loves me some monkfish liver (photo: http://bit.ly/1D3AQmV). Crowned with a bit of tobiko, the three slices were deliciously bathed in a little lime juice. Then it was off to the belt or maybe off with the belt considering how much I was eating. I tried to come up with a game plan so I wouldn't stuff myself before my stomach knew it, but alas the road to hell is paved with good intentions, don't y'know? I started in the middle with a green plate that intrigued me as it rounded toward me the second time. It was the $4 City Roll, quite an elaborate creation for the price with avocado and eel wrapped in rice and then topped with crab salad, maguro, tobiko, green onion and a mayo sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1ED8aRD).\n\nA simpler dish was in order after that, and the $3.50 Saba (Mackeral) Nigiri did the trick (photo: http://bit.ly/1LrGEdZ). Pretty fresh. The $4.50 Fresh Oysters made for a nice switch-up at that point in my marine life consumption (photo: http://bit.ly/1MJ2R8J). I was figuring outby this point it was best to grab the last thing the chef made and put on the belt between special orders. You have to keep an eagle eye on the guy across from me who was following a similar tactic. That's how I lost my Hamaichi Nigiri. Bastard. But I did manage to grab the $4.50 Tai (Red Snapper) Nigiri with a little fish roe on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1ED8cJh). OK, I need to stop.

Tenroku Sushi is a fantastic place to stop in anytime to get a good, fast meal when in Japantown. \n\nConveniently located in one of the two indoor shopping buildings, the uber casual atmosphere of TS comes with some really nice unexpected touches. After choosing my seat at the bar, I was quickly greeted by a staff member and provided an oshibori (warm, damp cloth to wash with prior to eating, as is custom in Japan) and a steaming hot cup of soothing, complimentary Green Tea. Great first impression!\n\nThen, decision making time. All of the sushi and various offerings pass by on small, different colored plates covered with a clear dome. The color of the plate represents how much that particular plate costs. You can also order directly from the sushi chef if you wish, but I found no need. \n\nTried basic Cali Roll, Fried Shrimp Heads, Marinated Cucumber with Fish Sauce, Shrimp Tempura, Tuna, a Combo of Asst Fish that included Salmon. All very good.  \n\nOverall: Tenroku Sushi is a wonderful place to take a short break from all of the Japantown fun and get a good, fast, light meal at an adorable price! Under $30 for two in San Francisco, and the hubby had a beer...wow! Recommend. Domo arigato!", "author": "Dawn H."}

Kaiten sushi can be done well if it's fresh and a restaurant has a high turnover rate but for some reason this location within Japantown which has a ton of tourists; still manages to keep stale, non fresh sushi on the belts.\n\nIf you want the more fresh fish, ask for a specific order. I thought the hamachi was okay and the salmon was eatable. I'm nowhere close to a sushi snob, perhaps a bit spoiled after living near the Torrance and Costa Mesa Japanese communities with fairly priced fresh sushi.\n\nOn second thought, it's a bit depressing eating in here unless you're in a pinch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "When I first heard that a kaiten zushi joint had (finally) opened up in SF, I knew I had to come here to check things out.  Although I'd like to say I'm not sure why, I actually know exactly why - I can be a sucker for gimmicks.  So, despite already knowing what to expect of the food (mediocre, at best), I still had to experience Tenroku for myself!\n\nIf you're not familiar with kaiten zushi joints, they're essentially the same as sushi boat restaurants, but with a conveyor belt instead of boats.  Thus, if you've been to a sushi boat restaurant, you've essentially been here as well (did I mention I can be a sucker for gimmicks?).  However, compared against Isobune (Japantown's sushi boat joint), Tenroku ranks a little better.\n\nPrices between the two are pretty comparable and while the variety at both is decent enough (if you want something that's not already circulating, you can order from one of the \"chefs\"), I really like how the dishes at Tenroku are covered as they circle around.  Though I'm not nearly as neurotic as Monica on Friends about cleanliness, I certainly appreciate how it lessens the chances of potential for flies landing on the food or people breathing/coughing/sneezing on it.\n\nAs far as quality goes, it's fine as long as you don't have high expectations.  Rolls are no better or worse than your average, Chinese owned sushi joint, but sashimi can be hit or miss.  The sake/salmon sashimi I grabbed was decent, but the hamachi nigiri had an odd color and not a lot of flavor.  Either way, it might be best to order sashimi from the \"chef\" instead so it's a little fresher (who knows how long they circle sometimes).\n\nAlthough service here is pretty good, places like this simply can't compete with more traditional restaurants if you're looking for some legitimate sushi/sashimi.  However, if you're looking to try a kaiten zushi/sushi boat joint, Tenroku isn't a bad bet and better (for the most part) than nearby Isobune.", "author": "Mike L."}

Nice portions as well. \n\n@ Tenroku each plate covered with a small plastic lid. Protecting against the transfer whatever the other folks peering, picking (but hopefully not sneezing or coughing on) as the plates zoom by. This is a GREAT serving feature, but creates double the dish handling task servers need to perform. Tenroku is correct about the value of the feature being worth the added task, of dealing with the lids, which is transparent to the plate grabbers since the service people are tremendously attentive. I'm not a paranoid germophobe but admit a thought arises when open food is moving by XX number of people that just wandered in off the street that are sitting within inches of the food I am about to put in my mouth. I love humanity, its people I can't stand. \n\nHad maybe more than a dozen dishes, great quality, and some with surprisingly good portions (the salmon Sashimi was 2 generous chunks), all were GOOD. Since I didn't analyze the prices of the different colored plates; and can't comment on any price as compared to other sushi boat / conveyor joints (admittedly a limited amount of experience).

It's so much fun because it's like eating + shopping at the same time -- two of my favorite activities. I came here with low expectations (1. it's in touristy Japantown, and 2. it's conveyor belt sushi) but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the variety. \n\nThe salmon is heavenly -- super fresh. I was surprised at the generous cuts, and that the sashimi is the same price as the nigiri. Hamachi, albacore, and scallop were all great. I tried two unique things that were really yummy: 1) the saba topped with ankimo and 2) herring with capelin roe. Loved the ankimo (if you love liver, you will love this), and loved the layer of crunchy eggs with the herring. They even had oysters, and they were good too. The $6 toro isn't the heavenly amazing toro you'd get elsewhere, but it's pretty good. The walu was good the first time, but stringy the second. The uni wasn't the best quality, I would skip it. Skip the tempura, the flour is too thick and chewy. Even though it's on the menu, they didn't have trout either time I came here.\n\nIf you plan on making a reservation here, don't count on them honoring it. Once I made a reservation for 4 at 7 PM on the phone, arrived at the restaurant, and the waitress laughed, said I was late, and told me she gave my spot away. I looked down at my phone, and it was exactly 7:00. Another time I actually made a reservation in person, told them I would come back at 6:30, and they still didn't have a spot open for me when I came back. Luckily, this shouldn't be too big an issue since it's almost like fast food and there's lots of seat turnover, but just FYI if you're trying to catch a movie or something. \n\nThe plates are color-coded for price, and you can easily order anything you don't see on the conveyer belt.

If you are in Japan-town are looking for good quality sushi for a decent price look no further.

My girlfriend and I came her because we were dissatisfied too many times with the conveyor sushi on the other side of the mall and wanted a better quality of fish. Whenever we think about getting sushi I always suggest coming here, despite the 30 minute drive. The wait staff can yes sometimes be a little hard to get a hold of, but when you can manage to stop them, they are attentive and helpful, and ALWAYS keeping busy.

High end \"bento\" jewel box like square shaped arrangements...little portions for a pretty high price...and this was before the high tech hipsters with option$ rolled in. Maki wasn't that great to be honest...but compared to what we have now, some of us probably wished it never went away. I'm sure it is like Hong Kongers wishing the British would re-colonize Hong Kong again, and feel like a real ass democracy for once, instead of a makeshift puppet put in by Beijing. So much for high tea, cricket, rugby, milk tea, Britpop, soccer under a sea of redness.\n\nThe owner of Sushi Raw saw an obvious opportunity here for the space, and rightfully so...converted whatever small restaurant space into a conveyor belt operation. And business is brisk to say the least.\n\nI would have to agree, Tenroku is a lot better than Isobune.\nAnd compared to other Peninsula options for sushi boat/moat/conveyor belts, far superior.\n\nTenroku easily appeals to the Cantonese speaking expat Chinese community. Good portions, a large wide variety, and even a few classics are well represented here. But you also have The Weird, The Whack, and The Freaks on display.\n\nSalmon - when all else fails, hard to go wrong with this. Hong Konger run of the mill types see this as the definitive fish for sushi, and somehow, salmon sashimi = Japanese cuisine in their eyes. So if you are running a serious sushi belt or boat business and you do not have salmon, may the Chinese lords have mercy on you.\n\nAnago - Can I just pay homage to Sir Mixx A Lot, \"I Like Big Cuts and I Cannot Lie\".\nFor a sushi boat moat belt shop, the anago here is very decent. Of course please do not compare it with the greats in town who go through the painstaking process of preparing it and also pairing it with a molasses like consistency brush sauce/nikiri.\n\nSaba - Nice big cuts. Not bad. At least safer than some of the dubious options\n\nCrab - dry and not flavorful. Skip\n\nTempura jive ass roll - when you are hungry and other options are looking a little freaky and weird. Too bad it's room temp/cold\n\nLobster salad - unfortunately this was not good, surprisingly. Too mushy in texture.\nPlease skip this and you will thank me later.\n\nNow the weird\n\nI've seen a few entire trays of sea urchin on these black rectangular plates doing the rounds. The one during my visit looked pretty sad....maybe 1/3 of it looked a tad too oxidized.... nobody touched it. I first thought these were the $2 plates, but those are black and round. So who knows how much they cost. I guess even the HK FOB types know what's going on... \n\nThere is some sort of crab or shrimp or lobster salad stuffed cucumber roll. But damn, it looks like some Cantonese prep of loofah/silky melon stuffed with shrimp paste and steamed....\n\nKimchi cucumber mini slices? Really?!\n\nAnd many many other jive asssssss rolls.\n\nIf you navigate carefully in here, you will probably avoid the sha boo boo. :-o", "author": "Ken K."}

We decided to try a couple plates anyways since you pay per plate. After staring at everything go past us on the conveyor belt with no interest, we decided to just grab anything to try.  I grabbed the seared blue fin toro which had fried onion flakes over rice. It was actually pretty fresh and melted in my mouth. We also grabbed the salmon eggs that did not taste too fresh. After trying two other items, I saw raw oysters! Threw some wasabi on there, took it whole, and was not pleased at all. There was sooooo much sand in there, I had to swish a lot of water to make sure I didn't chew it and ruin the enamel of my teeth! It also had a very very fishy after taste. Gross. We paid our bill and left. It was pretty pricey also. Each plate that we chose was about 5 dollars for two tiny pieces.

Unfortunately at this place the price is not much cheaper than a regular sushi restaurant and the quality is particularly low.\n\nEach plate ranges from around $3 to $7. An average roll plate with 3 piece is $4.50. That means for a normal right piece roll you are paying over $10 for fish that has been sitting around and becoming less attractive with each rotation. The typical amount of sushi the average person eats will set you back about $30, which is just a few dollars less than it would cost to have fantastic freshly made sushi in San Francisco.\n\nAside from the price, everything was quite visually unappealing. The fish, even in the case, looked dried out. There were plastic covers on top of each dish which were beat up and foggy, definitely didn't make the dishes look appetizing.

Haven't had conveyor belt sushi since high school. First of all don't have high expectations for kaiten-zushi in America, so don't expect Michelin star level sushi because that's not what you're gonna get. I see some of the negative reviews here and they're expecting fxxcking \"Jiro I Dream of Sushi\" grade sushi, are you stupid? Would you walk into McDonald's and write a bad review because they don't have Wagyu Beef burger?\n\nThis is a budget class Chinese owned (Sushi Raw owner) kaiten-zushi. The level after supermarket sushi. Get that into your heads people. Nijiya supermarket across the street has $9.99 Uni box, this place only charges $0.01 more, what the hell do you expect? Geez...\n\nThey had Walu crossed out on their menu which was disappointing. I had their sake toro topped with ikura, chutoro, saba sashimi, hamachi toro sashimi, kobe beef nigiri (yeah right!), amaebi nigiri, blue shrimp sashimi, ikura nigiri, uni nigiri. First of all, there is no Kobe Beef in the US, there is but in such small quantities the 99% cannot afford it. Seriously. If that was genuine Kobe Beef from Kobe, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture those 2 pieces would cost you AT LEAST $50USD. Go read up on what is 100% genuine Kobe Beef, I'm not here to give you free lessons.\n\nHonestly all the pieces I had were not bad, the rice was meh, but expected, still better than supermarket sushi rice. Here's a tip when eating at this place, order from the chef directly and order everything sashimi (no rice), at least your seaweed will be crisp and crunchy and not all soggy.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this place 2.5 stars is because both my friend and I had to glue ourselves to the toilet after we got home, if it was just me or my friend then maybe one of us is having stomach problems, but the both of us?\n\nFor the price this place is great, the portions are generous and if you're in a hurry for lunch you'll be in and out in no time.

Since I was in Japantown, I asked my guy if we should just attempt to get some ramen from one of the restaurants in the Kintetsu Mall, to which he whole-heartedly agreed.\n\nOur usual place is Katsu, but since it's closed for remodeling we decided to stop by Tenroku as we passed by, intrigued by the sushi conveyor. As we plucked our sushi from the belt when we saw things that looked appetizing, we perused the menu and decided on the ramen we wanted; however, apparently they were out of ramen (and something tells me it probably wasn't coincidental...), so we got udon noodles in our soups instead, which was still very good. Oddly, though we both ordered tonkotsu ramen we got chicken katsu instead, but the chicken was very good and the broth was very rich and flavorful. The portions were very generous as well, so much so that we couldn't finish our ramen after having the sushi as well.\n\nAll of the various rolls we enjoyed were fresh and extremely tasty, and it was cool sitting and watching the sushi chefs make the sushi in front of you and then plate it up to put on the conveyor.

Be aware that it's a kaitenzushi where all the diners line up at a conveyor belt, this means it's a little noisy and lacks privacy but I think that chasing your favourite dish around the room is half the fun. You can order al a carte from the sushi chef and some hot dishes from the kitchen. The sushi is always consistent and there is a reasonable amount of traditional sushi, unlike many places in America. A handy casual eatery close to Kabuki cinema, nothing flash but good quality and I always leave satisfied.", "author": "Amaya B."}

Granted, I've only been to one of those kinds of places three times but this one was so much better than the other two, I really feel it merits five stars. \n\nThe belt was filled with different types of sushi and they all looked fresh and well made. The staff is also ultra friendly and attentive. My tea never got cold or ever dropped below half full. Also, the seats are farther apart from each other then the other places I've been. I didn't feel crammed in like a sardine while I was there. Though I think if you were an especially tall or wide person you might still have some issues during the ultra-busy times. \n\nI had several orders of a shrimp tempura style role, a salmon roll with lemon and unagi (eel) here. All were amazing. The tempura one was fried but light, the salmon one tasted ultra fresh and almost had a palate cleansing effect, and the eel was perfect with no flabby or slimy parts to it. \n\nIf I had had more time in SF I would have gone here many more times.

It was the contact high I got coming out of Kinokuniya. That bookstore always makes me so damned happy, and I'm gonna blame it.\n\nTenroku has minimal table seating and predominately caters to sushi-boat lovers. We sat down and ordered an Asahi for two and received some hot green tea to boot. I think I sat there and watched the belt loop around two or three times before slumping in my chair with the questionable \"rainbow\"-looking roll. With three pieces (priced at $4), I ate the California roll draped with a meager piece of salmon. I could've done without the mayo explosion (in the California roll), so I asked the sushi chef for a simple sake nigiri (salmon on rice). That was just fine. None of the silky creaminess that salmon usually has.\n\nLook, I know I'm being incredibly nit-picky here, but once you get used to excellent sushi (which San Francisco totally has), everything else is just... sigh, not as great.

We had everything from blue shrimp, to mackarel (any self respecting Russian's sushi-go-to, except this had the caviar, which made it extra good), delicious tuna, salmon, yellow tail with cod liver, scallops which melted in my mouth... did I mention the mackarel? Also, the sashimi pieces were absolutely thicker than I'd ever seen (and again, delicious).\n\nI don't think I can rave enough about this place! It was absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to come back!", "author": "Maria G."}

We've been to places where we put sushi covers back on the conveyor belt. So my friend had placed her first cover back on the conveyor belt and happily continued on with our conversation. But then, we got cut off by the sushi man immediately. He removed it from the belt and asked her to leave it on her table next time; causing everyone to look at us like we're stupid. I understand each restaurant runs differently and we respect that. However, I wish they would have placed a sign or at least have the waitress instruct us on what to do with the plastic covers; instead of giving us the dirty look. \n\nThe fish there is okay. Some tasted fresh and some didn't. The uni and unagi is very good.  There was this one nigiri with seared white fish and ankimo on top; it tasted so bad i couldn't finish the rest. It did not taste like fish! Maybe because it was seared, it had a plastic taste to it. The fish tartar looked nice topped with caviar but the fish did not taste fresh. The green onions in it tasted as if it was chopped on an unwashed cut board, giving it an extra bit of unwanted flavor of ginger, garlic, and onions. The Tamago nigiri was a joke!

Also, the tea that they offer is so tasty, but also sooo hot (so we usually have to wait until the end before we can drink it). \nI hardly believe/understand the authenticity and fairness of those few 2-3 stars reviews.\nTenroku almost became as a family for us: an appointment that we can't and we don't wanna miss.

The small piece of octopus had a poor, overcooked texture of a piece of rubber. It was hard to chew into and reminded me of a hardened wad of gum. The broccoli was insanely bitter and hard. I literally couldn't eat it because it tasted so foul. The same applied for the carrots floating around - they were sweet, but mostly bitter after sitting in the broth. As for the udon noodles, they were fine, but there wasn't that much in the bowl, so after a few slurps, there was mostly terrible broth left. I felt ripped off paying $10 for it. I might as well have gotten a vegetarian udon or use that money to get sushi.\n\nThat being said, I'll review the sushi since that's what Tenroku is all about: conveyor belt sushi. For conveyor belt sushi, it was alright, but I think it's a hit or miss. The prices are quite expensive and I could've bought full rolls for the more pricey plates between $5-7 which only offer 2-3 pieces of sushi. The cheaper plates will start at $3, but they contain the mediocre California roll pieces and inari sushi (rice wrapped in tofu skin). There wasn't any seaweed salad, gyoza, or other sushi pieces besides the old sashimi cuts and the same four rolls (salmon with lemon, eel, spicy crab, and crunchy shrimp). The point of conveyor belt sushi is to offer a variety and showcase sample plates at a cheap price, so Tenroku fails at that. The fish didn't seem too fresh for what I was paying either. They made too much of the same stuff and no one was taking the plates, which meant some of the fish that passed by, especially the sashimi, was heavily oxidized.\n\nI came in and the place was empty besides a couple in the back corner. The waitress seemed to be a nice girl, but she was playing on her phone when I walked up to her, which screams, \"I don't want to be professional nor do I care.\" She also loved hanging out at the front desk area because after seating me and my partner in the back corner, I'd have to walk repeatedly to the front to ask her for a water refill. (Hey, I find it rude to yell across the room considering the center is a kitchen.) Miguel is a really nice chef though and if you ask, he'll make whatever you want. I suggest doing this because you're guaranteed a fresh roll rather than a stagnant roll which has seen better times. Overall, the meal cost $50 for two people, which was painful considering the food wasn't too good nor was anything about Tenroku impressive. I think Tenroku is meant to be a normal sit-down restaurant, but the conveyor belt is a tourist gimmick to help it stand out.", "author": "Diana L."}

Thankfully for my bank account, there aren't too many great sushi boat places in the city.....except for Tenroku.  I've been to a couple of sushi boat places around the city and neither of them were all that spectacular.  I've always had this image in my mind that sushi boat places were gimmicky and/or a tourist trap, especially in SF.  But Tenroku breaks that image for me.  They offered a wide variety of fish, more than just your typical tuna, salmon and shrimp.  They offered yellowtail topped with monkliver (SO GOOD, probably grabbed 3 plates of those), toro, Uni, takoyaki and various creative rolls.  You can also order some stuff off the menu, but thats no fun.  Pricing of the plate range from about $2.50 - $7 although there is a sign for a $10 plate thats black and has flowers on it, but i never saw one on the conveyor belt.  Service was great, sushi chefs greet you and were always asking if everything was ok during our meal.  They even gave us a warm hot towel right when we sat down.  The place isnt very big, its a very cozy atmosphere but its fun.  Sit down and start grabbin plates.  If you see something you might be interested in, just grab it, it may not make it around the conveyor belt the 2nd time around.  Especially if I'm there.", "author": "Darren W."}

I appreciate that it's pretty a authentic to a Japanese sushi bar (there are no absurd boats) but there are little lids, which I super appreciate. Best when there are a lot of people so nothing gets stale, but seriously, you can get a few really great pieces. Nothing exotic. \nOnly thing I wish is that I wish it were easier to flag down one of the sushi chefs to get a custom piece or two. Oh well.", "author": "Amy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "description": "This place is terrific and definitely the best \"sushi boat\" experience I've had outside of Tokyo! \n\nHere are something things to keep in mind:\n\n1) Quality\nThe quality here is good. It is not the level of quality you'll get paying $50 for a 10-piece omakase but I'd be hard pressed for pay the prices Tenroku charges and get better quality elsewhere. When there are lots of people the chefs are always putting fresh sushi on the conveyor belt so things are less likely to sit at busy times. \n\n2) Cost\nWe had mostly plates that ran $3-$4 each (for 2 pieces) except for the amazing scallon nigiri which was $5.50. For two people a dinner with a nice hot sake and enough sushi to really fill you up will probably run $60-70 for two... For the quality the prices are fair or even below market! \n\n3) Environment\nThis place is much nicer (more airy and more clean) than the other sushi boat place in the Japan center (Isobune). Importantly you don't feel like you're sitting low reaching up to the sushi boats. At Tenroku the sushi passes right at hand level - to keep this hygienic they use clear plastic lids on the plates. Would be more \"Hirojuku style\" without them but I'm glad for the cleanliness.\n\n4) Service -- the waitresses and chefs are all super friendly and nice. \n\n5) Reservations -- not sure if you can but try to get them or come at slightly off hours because the secret is out about this place.\n\nAll in all awesome place and I look forward to going back soon!", "author": "dr r."}

We were hesitant to eat here because the prices were a bit too good to be true in some ways. A board of uni for $10? It was fresh and delicious. Toro for $6? Maybe not as fat as isobune, the other sushi boat place but it is pretty darn good. What I like about this place are there seared fish. There are seared walu with uni, seared hamachi with ankimo, and other fishes. All in all, I like this place and we plan on coming back.", "author": "Pierre L."}

My friend ordered the beef ramen and when it came it was pretty big so we shared a bit. It was really freakin' good considering that it was a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. The broth was flavorful but light and did not over power the other ingredients which was how I think ramen should be. Try it you will be surprised. The interior was clean, elegant and simple giving a nice relaxing atmosphere to eat and chat. The food is pretty fresh for the price and all made very carefully giving a very nice presentation of the food. The staff was friendly, very helpful, and clean and the chefs were very nice, easy to talk to, and respectful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-03", "description": "Sushi is decent for the price, which is reasonable, but the place is poorly run. I was just sitting down on one of their tall stools and as I am sitting one of the chefs calls to me and hands in my direction what appeared to be a long dish for soy sauce with gari. I lean forward to grab it from him, the stool tilts forward to the point that I start to lose my balance, and what looked like one dish was actually two and one of them got dropped during the handoff.  Meanwhile my natural reaction is to try to catch the dish, and my stool almost tips completely over in the process. Maybe wait until your customers are seated before precariously shoving things at them over an absurdly wide counter, or better yet, have the waitress or hostess place the sauce dishes down from the other side. And speaking of those waitresses, they frequently sneak up behind you and without saying anything (so that you know they are there) they reach right in front of your face while you are eating or talking to your companion, forcing you to dodge the dish covers that they are removing mere inches from your nose. Seriously - I realize that this is a quick service restaurant, and I've eaten in plenty of similar establishments in Tokyo, but the management of this place has really dropped the ball on training their staff.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

Ordered a bunch of sushi, seafood udon for my son (huge but tons of MSG), and a combo dinner of salmon teriyaki and shrimp tempura, which is all listed on one page.  I pointed to the items as I ordered since she obviously didn't understand my sushi order unless I pointed to the items on the menui.  When we got the bill, she charged the shrimp tempura as an appetizer ($8 vs. $5).  At any other restaurant they would say, my mistake I will adjust.  She then proceeds to lecture me that I did not tell her that.  I state I told you as a combo and pointed it on the menu.  She obviously was new and didn't know the menu so I turned to the page in front of the manager and told her look.  It's here on the bottom and I pointed to it.  She kept insisting I didn't.  I told her if that is how you feel we will just take the $3 difference off your tip.  She said \"that was fine\".  In the meantime, I heard her manager tell her in Chinese the difference between the combo and the appetizer.  HELLO?!\n\nMy husband initially tipped 15% vs. our standard 20%.  Upon bringing us a leftover box, she once again insisted I should tell her more clearly next time, so we dropped her tip to 10%.  \n\nThere are a ton better places to eat with much better service.
