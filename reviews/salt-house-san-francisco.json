Plenty of options for plates to share with friends, as well as mains for yourself. Their list of carefully crafted cocktails, varietals of wine,  solid selection of beers, and non-alcoholic options ensure all members of your dining party are happily watered as they await the delicious food to come.\n\nAppetizers/shared items:\nShishito peppers: perfectly blistered with that tasty finishing maldon salt evenly salting the peppers (even the ones on the bottom). A must-have for sharing with the table. \n\nSourdough batard with whipped duck fat: Can't go wrong with fresh, hot bread with a savory duck fat spread on top\n\nPoutine: Well balanced gravy (not too salty! Yay!),  cheese, fries ratio. Glad that we chose to share this between the 5 of us, giving each of us just enough to enjoy the dish without stuffing ourselves.\n\nBlack Pepper Cavatelli: Again, great for sharing so that none of us felt guilty for filling up on pasta prior to our mains\n\nMains:\nDuck breast: I ordered mine medium rare and it came out wonderful. Very tender and flavorful, paired very well with the vegetables (loved the turnips)  and fruit (plum).\n\nDessert:\nBlack Pepper Pound Cake: Don't wrinkle your nose at this if you're unsure about the foie gras chantilly. The depth brought out by the extra fat  and subtle flavor of the foie gras goes well with the pound cake (I appreciate that it wasn't overly sweet), contrasting with the light plum sorbet. \n\nMatcha Cheesecake: This matcha cheesecake was DELICIOUS, but the angostura bitters sorbet was what hit this dessert out of the park.", "author": "Gloria S."}

The broth wasn`t too flavorful (don`t expect anything that`s been stewed 24 - 48 hours in a real ramen place).

My first visit- my client had been numerous times since his office is only a few blocks away. \n\nThis is true American classic restaurant with unique twists -- arugula salad with light dressing mixed with duck confit. Yum. Client had the amazing peppers on the side and the salmon burger. He said it was excellent but didn't eat much of the bun. Didn't ask \"why.\" Service was efficient if not a little cold- abrupt would be too harsh-- it's just that even now I couldn't identify him if he was standing in front of me. Hostess at front of house very pleasant even though a lot of people trying to get in. We had reservations and were seated promptly. One thing- there is a very nice and exceptionally clean parking garage about 50 ft from the restaurant - short term rates were fine and service excellent.\n\nCheck out the menu before you go- creative salads, tacos,  salmon, pasta, burgers, ramen etc. nice cheese plate as well. Noise alert- very crowded as tables are close together. All hard surfaces including an upstairs seating area. Very noisy. We managed ok. Last, the shared bathroom located at the back of the restaurant proper and in a hallway - kind of touch and go. Not my favorite. Not dirty but didn't sparkle.", "author": "Greg C."}

I have been here a few times since it is an easy place to get to from the FiDi, and is next door to the Deloitte office where I know people who work there.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy, meaning the tables are very very close to each other, so do not expect much of a private conversation if the place is croweded like it was last Thursday night.  \n\nService was friendly and prompt, with the hostess chipping in to bring us items besides our server.  The only slight ding is that I ordered a martini with our bottle of wince, and it took a bit too long to get it back from the bar. Very slight ding, as at the end of the meal and with an empty bottle of wine, we wanted to have another glass, and the server suggested a half a bottle that made sense price wise vs two glasses of the red stuff.\n\nWe shared apps, had oysters on the half shell, and they were great. But, they were smeared with a light amount of some kind of sweet paste.

I definitely made the wrong choice here.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the panna cotta, the chocolate mousse, and the black sesame cheesecake. The chocolate was really really heavy. One bite and that was enough. The panna cotta was pretty forgettable. The black sesame was really good though. Black sesame is always one of my favorite flavors in general. I never had it in cheesecake form though but I was impressed. The cheesecake was light and I could taste the accents of black sesame. \n\nThe service was really slow.

The ingredients consisted of: osco sea gin, yuzu citrus, amontillado sherry,  cucumber , furikake rim.  The furikake rim is what caught my eye and after asking our excellent server what it was--I decided to go for it.  Winner!  Furikake is dried seaweed ground down to the size of salt.  It was a wild addition but it totally worked.\n\nWe shared 2 plates of Shookum oysters, the flavored popcorn and the artichokes to start.  The oysters had a hint of pineapple granita and Ponzu sauce!  The popcorn was seasoned with furikake!  The artichokes sat in a stinging nettle sauce and were accompanied by pickled strawberries. \nI forgot to  mention that we also ordered the pickled quail eggs.  They were filled with pickled horseradish sauce, nori and salmon roe.  They just completely burst with flavor!\n\nThe grilled whole fish, English pea ravioli ( in a chocolate sauce!), California Halibut and a pasta dish with scroll shaped pasta and pork represented our main dishes.\nThey too were seasoned creatively and were very much appreciated by these diners.\n\nWe all shared a slice of their Key Lime Pie for dessert.

Well, I know that nothing is too early for Salt House  because their happy hour starts at 3pm. *ahem* not like I've been there that early for happy hour *ahem*. Their happy hour menu is great! Cocktails are $7 (and they're delicious!). The flavors rotate every once in awhile so it has always been something different every time I'm there. It's good in that I always get to try something new but bad in that I never remember the name of the drinks from the previous list .... sigh. \n\nThe staff is also amazing. My friend and I got seated at the bar and barely missed happy hour by 10minutes. The server felt bad that we barely missed it and brought out a cheese platter on the house for us. Now that's a way to our heart, through wine and free food! :)", "author": "Tram N."}

Service was excellent and the three of us had the seasonal salad which was quince w/arugula. I topped mine with shrimp. They were out of salmon which seems strange since it's open for dinner but maybe they get it fresh. So instead my coworker got the grilled chicken. We had appetizers of french fries, green peppers and spinach w/mushrooms. Everything was great, fresh and I enjoyed the experience. Hopefully I can try the chocolate chip cookie next time.

I can't say enough great things about Salt House. I came here on a rainy night for a drink and a couple apps. I ordered a whiskey sour and it was delicious, frothy perfection! We started with the octopus and pork belly appetizer- it was seriously the best octopus I have ever had! It was crispy and so flavorful. The pork belly was to die for! We were literally counting pieces and dividing them up equally so it was fair. Next we got the Ahi tuna with poached seafood. Some of the assorted seafood included muscles, uni panna cotta (yum!) and shrimp. Everything tasted very fresh and it was a great light app to balance the octopus/pork belly. Service was spot on- and since we did not stay for a full meal I will happily be back next time I find myself in San Francisco.", "author": "Taylor J."}

We had:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nTuna crudo - fresh tuna and beautifully presented with garnishes and seasoned with ponzu sauce\nPersimmon Cannellone - again beautifully presented and made into a roll with dungeness crab and seaweed salad, with creamed avocado \"dots\" on the side of the roll and flying fish roe sprinkled on top of the \"roll\". It was light, tasty and refreshing. I don't know how they made this into a sushi roll looking dish; it sure was visually pleasant to look at.\nOctopus - don't expect to see any fried calamari looking pieces of \"fish\" on this plate. (I wish I had remembered to take pictures of all the dishes we ate...). There were a few well seasoned lamb sausage and octopus as well as grilled vegetables on the plate. Tasty and visually pleasant to look at.\n\nMain course:\n\nSan Francisco Ling Cod - juicy and light white fish that was very well seasoned. If you prefer less fishy fish and a light flavored seafood dish, try this one. Love the creamy white beam puree as well as the olive tapenade crisp, which I don't know how they made olives into a piece of corn chip looking cracker. \n\nSkuna Bay salmon - Loved this dish! I would go back just for this one! The salmon was juicy and flaky. The chanterelle mushroom added a strong \"meaty\" flavor and texture to the dish and they sure were generous with the mushrooms!\n\nGnocchi primavera - this is the BEST gnocchi dish I have ever tasted! Contrary to the commonly seen heavy white cream sauce, they made this dish without any cream sauce and yet still managed to make the gnocchi delicious. It had the perfect texture without being too mushy/soft or too firm and was so fresh and lightly crispy on the outside. Loved the king trumpet mushrooms, which added a layer of flavor, and winter root vegetables, which were grilled just right.\n\nDessert - being a \"caker\" myself I could not possibly pass up the opportunity to try their beautifully presented, decadent looking desserts! Thanks to the hostess Nicole, who seemingly read my mind and picked these two desserts for us:\n\nPumpkin spice layer cake - perfect amount of spice, moist not overly sweet cake, frosted with creamy cream cheese frosting. The buttermilk-huckleberry sherbet was refreshing, light and a nice palate cleanser. I especially LOVED the nice touch of sprinkles of sea salt on top of the cream cheese frosting. It added an additional dimension of flavor when you take a bit into the cake: it was salty at first, then the creaminess of the frosting hit you, then the sweetness of the moist, spiced pumpkin cake took over, and you suddenly realized, yeah, I am still eating a dessert. I made a mental note to remember to add sea salt on my cakes next time.\n\nGingerbread sable - probably the best gingerbread \"cookie\" I've ever eaten. Very crunchy texture with sprinkles of  sanding sugar on top. Again there are layers of different textures stacked on top of one another, from the maple panna ccotta on top, to the crunchy cookie in the middle, to the creamy hazelnut cream at the bottom. Just think of all the efforts they made to compose this dessert dish! Oh, and let's not forget about the spiced pear sorbe on the side that was the perfectly refreshing palate cleanser to end the meal.\n\nThe recommended French white wine pairing was great too, which went perfectly with the seafood dishes we had. \n\nOverall, it was a fantastic dinner, with great service. The hostess knows our guests by name and was very personable and helpful. Fresh and very flavorful dishes with beautiful plating techniques. I would definitely come back again to try more dishes!", "author": "Claire W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-28", "description": "Salt House Restaurant Review \nOutside looking in the restaurant looks like a higher end restaurant. Coming in they had interesting business cards and menus that makes the restaurant classier. The host seated us right away because we had reservations. \n*A tip would be to make reservations especially during lunch/dinner rushes. \nThe seating of the restaurant is a little tight that creates a loud environment. I would not suggest to bring someone here if you wanted a private conversation.\nThe hard walls and ceilings create the restaurant noise to not leave the room which makes you have to speak up to talk to the person next to you. The service was also good. We did not have a problem with them. They were kind and professional but you do need to ask for bread, they won't just put it on your table.\nI will also like to add that the kitchen is open and can be seen while eating which makes for some entertainment. There is also a bar and upstairs seating which adds more value to the restaurant \n\nOn to the food, I ordered the \"Carnitas Tacos\" and they were pretty good. It's not amazing but when you put your salsa on them that's where they get good. They also come with a side of chips which make for a delightful side. These tacos aren't your usual run of the mill tacos from a taco stand they have a little more glam to them. \n\nWith the Carnitas Tacos I also ordered the \"Salt House Burger\" and that was great. Places that are more modern and are trying to be fancy sometimes can't make a burger well. I asked for it medium well and it came out exactly how I desired it to be cooked.\n*Tip I have heard they cook the burgers more rare if you don't ask for how you want it to be cooked. Be sure to ask for it to be cooked how you would like.\nThe burger came with fries that were pretty salty, no pun intended. But they did taste better than I expected and made my burger that much better. \n\nI also had the Chocolate Mousse for dessert, it tasted average but the the design of it was laid out like a snake which made it look more interesting and fancy. You would expect mousse to be not displayed like that which makes it significant but it did have these chocolate and white chocolate balls that tasted good that added a crunch to it.\n\nOverall the restaurant would be a great place if you are in the area for lunch or going to take coworkers out. The only cons I would say is that that restaurant is pricey and would probably go to the extent say over pricey because 3 tacos should never cost you 16 dollars or a burger and fries should not cost you 17 dollars. It is also on the louder side. So be expected to speak up at the table.\n\nI WOULD recommend this restaurant to a friend.", "author": "Tobias L."}

Not sure why it has low ratings but it was pretty packed on a Tuesday lunch.  It was loud with a line out the door.  The inside has high ceilings and an open kitchen which we had a front seat view of all the things going on in there.\n\nI tried the pork belly sandwich and also we got the poutine too.  Regarding the poutine, it was a good version of poutine but definitely not traditional recipe for sure.  The pork belly sandwich was pretty good as I literally inhaled my sandwich in a few bites.  The chips that came with were also good but didn't eat them until after I ate my entire sandwich.\n\nThe unexpected entertainment that we had that day was some kitchen theatrics.  Apparently a worker in there was being yelled at and he ended up leaving the kitchen.  I wasn't sure if he came back but that didn't look like ordinary kitchen communication.  I guess Hell's Kitchen is may more reality than I initially thought.\n\nI had a good meal despite a super loud environment although I most likely will come back during happy hour.", "author": "Ben H L."}

At the entryway, there's a stairwell up to this loft seating, great for a large group looking for privacy. Views from above allow you an eagle eye into the open kitchen and bar space beneath. The original hardwood floors and exposed brick are rustic accents on the modern furniture, kitchen design, and loft area. \n\nI've only come here for lunch (will definitely return for drinks and dinner), but the menu was fairly simplistic--salads, sammies, and fries. Definitely a great choice for a quick in-and-out business lunch or more upscale experience than just running across the street for a quick bite. The small touches on each dish made the food and drinks stand out from the average FiDi restaurant. Garnishes, food presentation, and espresso were all plated and served with the utmost care. My favorite had to be the single brown sugar cube on a teaspoon beside the macchiato. Very standard in Europe, but not often seen in this neck of the woods. \n\nThey also serve Acme pull-apart bread, which is an enticing incentive to head over there on its own.\n\nService is amazing from the host to the waitstaff.

My cousin invited our family to a recent Sunday get together for our party of seven.  Seated near the bar, the dining room is spacious with high ceilings.  The brick structure gives it a rustic feel as it is likely a historic building.  Here is what I tried:\n\nShared apps\n1) Poutine - Their staple dish, this was only okay as the fries were on the dry side and the gravy one note.\n\n2) Ravioli with rabbit - It wasn't bad, but no comparison to Cotogna's tortelli.  Modest portions made it difficult to share.\n\n3) Raw oysters - A good selection of oysters and tried only two.  Like the dipping choices of cocktail sauce, horseradish, or mignonette sauce.\n\n4) Risotto - The veggie risotto was above average with a interesting variety of locally grown vegetables.  This dish disappeared quickly.\n\nEntree\n5) Vegetable soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=lkFuo6HpqmN4KnBCr9C1dw) - Ingredients were good and like the clear broth.

Again, wished the portions were a bit more generous.\n\nWe also shared three desserts between the seven of us.  Nothing really stood out as I can't remember any of them outside of the cheesecake.\nThere was nothing particularly good or bad (outside of the present company), just that nothing really stood out; did notice that the prices are a bit on the high side compared to other comfort food places.

I want to point out how friendly the staff are, especially the bartenders.  On this visit, I sat at the bar for a quick drink and a bite.  The old fashion was great, but the poutine I always get here was terrible compared to past visits.  Did they change the recipe ?  It had sriracha sauce dollops and some chopped green stuff that was gross on top that I don't remember.  Also, as some other reviewers mentioned, the food wasn't hot -- warm to cold.  The gravy was watery and not as flavorful as in the past.  On top of this, the bill (excluding tip) was $27 for one cocktail and the poutine!!", "author": "John O."}

With high ceilings and sleek metal finishes, the atmosphere felt very trendy with random eccentric artwork spread around the interior.\n\nStuffed chicken wings - 2/5 - This sounded far more intriguing than it was. There was a tiny amount of stuffing in one section of the wings. I think we were hoping that instead they had pulled the bone out or found some clever way to actually make this feel like a stuffed piece of chicken rather than just being an overly spiced set of fried wings.\n\nShort rib poutine - 1/5 - Sigh, another miss. The fries were not crispy enough and the cheese curds were average, but I did like that they torched it a bit to melt some of them into a stringy goo. Most disappointing, however, was that the gravy had the most minuscule pieces of short rib in it and nothing else. Where is the actual short rib??? Not a single chunk of meat to be found here. Utterly underwhelming.\n\nPork duo - 3/5 - The ribs were average and not something I would order again. The pork tenderloin was quite good, and had a nice bacon wrap and crumbled topping with a tasty sauce. It was also nicely pink throughout and looked to have been cooked by sous vide. While not the most exciting item, it was decently done. The plantains were good as well.\n\nOverall, I'm basing this rating on the poutine since that was our focus and reason for coming. For the cost and supposed quality of this restaurant it is embarrassing that there isn't any visible meat to be found in the poutine. \"I've experienced better.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

For conveniences with distance/location/time I was treated to very nice dinner here for some delicious eats. Reservations were made and highly recommended as the space isn't as big as it appears from the outside. We were seated on the second level which has minimal seats but the ambiance is very nice with dimmed lights casting over your pretty food plate. \n\nPROSECCO - I never sipped on a prosecco before. Imagine an Italian light champagne bubbly because that is exactly how I can describe it. It's not rough like regular champagne and goes down very smoothly. No acid reflex here!\n\nKUSSHI (bc) - they say the smaller the creamier, not necessarily true. There was some sense of creaminess but the not creamiest oyster. The taste had a very \"clean\" taste to it which was more refreshing then the other oysters that are usually gritty. \n\nBEEF BAVETTE ($29) - fondant potatoes, raclette cheese broccoli, and long pepper jus. What is \"Bavette\"? According to Wikipedia it's pasta - LIES!!! It's not. It was a very tender pieces of steak. Portion to price, kind of small but it can fill someone who has a medium appetite. Highly Recommend.\n\nALASKAN HALIBUT ($28) - sunchoke puree, spiced baby carrots, concord grape vinaigrette. the thing about ordering fish at a restaurant if that you have to expect it flavored with other ingredients. white fish is my favorite kind of fish - its light and any sauce or dressing added will pick up nicely without overpowering the star item on the plate. this was perfectly cooked, hardly noticeable very light crisp outer edges with a very fluffy and tender inside. Highly Recommend.\n\nPUMPKIN CHEESECAKE ($9) - cinnamon marsh mellow, pumpkin seed brittle. ITS PUMPKIN SEASON!!!!!!.I have a sweet-tooth and always need dessert to end a tasty meal. The portion is good for sharing between two people. The cheesecake was moist, creamy, and with hints of pumpkin with every dabble. The red dots on the plate made the dessert \"pretty\" but it was too sweet and was avoided after several attempts to mix it with the cheesecake. The pumpkin seed brittle is the round thing ontop of the cheesecake taking the shape of a cookie and tasted very similar to a very thin fortune cookie. Highly Recommend.\n\nWill I be back?

Good to know for my next visit.\n\nWe decided to go to Salt House because it was literally the only place available on Open Table that could accommodate a party of 4. When we arrived (on a Saturday night at 8:00pm), the restaurant was completely empty. The hostess was very friendly and our server was as well. \n\nWe ordered a round of cocktails right off the bat. Our server kept coming back to our table every 5 minutes to apologize that the bartender was backed up even though there was nobody at the bar or in the restaurant. After 20 minutes, our cocktails arrived. I will say that the cocktails were good, although not sure what happened with the delay. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the olives and mixed nuts. The olives were drizzled in olive oil and the nuts were coated with honey. \n\nFor entrees, Pauline and I had the Cod, Kristina had the Gnocchi, and Dan had the Salmon.\n\nThe Cod had a borderline chemical taste to it. Pauline said her dish didn't taste bad; but had no flavor at all. The cod was served with fried zucchini blossoms and saut\u00e9ed zucchini. I'm guessing it was prepared in an oven since there was no searing on either side. If I had to guess, I'd say the portion weighed 4-5 ounces. This plate cost $32.\n\nDan had the Salmon which actually looked very good. Seared on both sides. Kristina said her gnocchi was cooked well, but she counted only 10 tiny dumplings. Needless to say, we ate every last nut and olive from our appetizer. \n\nWith tip, our bill came to $240 for 4 people. That's 1 drink and a small entree each. For the price, we were severely underwhelmed. \n\nI think to bring more people in, they should have some heartier entrees for under $30.

I even reluctantly let my family members try my dish, and they all said it was really good, with some saying it was the best at the table.   \n\nA couple of side notes, slightly spicy, and a smaller dish, but I was full from the Giants game so it was plenty for me.  \n\nOthers at the table had the rib eye and pork, both not bad, but not remarkable.  My daughter had a cauliflower ravioli which was good.  Also, had to pay around $8 for bread....\n\nBeen here a couple of times and always thought it was good, but like Town Hall a little better, but I guess I missed the pappardelle.\n\nService was good, and they were able to make a pasta for my youngest.\n\nCome back? Yes please, pappardelle!", "author": "Jeff N."}

Mushroom pate was a bit of an overkill. And the chips they were served with couldn't handle the denseness or saltiness of the mushroom concoction.

This spot has been an established SoMa eatery for some time, and I'm glad I finally was able to sample the fare here. My initial impressions? I think I need to return for dinner. \n\nAs far as lunch goes, the menu is a mix of accessible, lunch-y options like soup, sandwiches and salads, alongside a few higher-end, fancied up entrees. The portions are on the small side, and the prices are on the large end, so you're definitely spending cash for the ambiance and quality of fare. Is it there? Sort of. The food is definitely good, but I don't think it merits the extra $$$ over some of the fantastic, more casual spots around the area. Sentinel's sandwiches are easily as good as the one I sampled, and the entrees are delicate enough to leave a hungry guy still hungry. And if you're dining on an expense account with normal limits, you'll easily exceed those. \n\nHowever this format always lends itself better to dinner than to lunch. I'm hoping there's a little more bang for your buck after 5pm. The flavors and ingredients are quality, and the service trends toward upscale dining. I can see dropping extra dollars here for a longer dinner dining experience. \n\nCompared to the caliber of food I've become accustomed to in Portland and SF at this price point, Salt House is definitely good but could stand to knock it up a notch. I'll happily come back again for more, and hopefully dinner on a future visit.", "author": "Don B."}

I'd been there before...a looong time ago...and remembered it as being decent. \n\nThe service was really lovely. Everyone who took care of us, from the busboys on up, was great. The space is a bit cavernous, with a half-loft as you walk in, and the rest open and high, but the noise level was completely bearable. I could hear my companion talk, and could easily ignore those sitting around us, which is what you need in a place in the financial area. It's a cool spot, and the ambiance reflects that.\n\nHowever, the food was uneven. We started with the winter fruit and vegetable salad, and the composition was really strange. Three *extremely* salty heirloom-style lettuce chunks (and by salty, I mean it made me pucker like crazy), and maybe five very small pieces of roasted fruits/vegetables (two kinds of squash, pear, mushroom, and something else I couldn't figure out) over pureed celeriac. Needless to say, it was not a very successful dish. The roasted nuts with sea salt and honey were outstanding, however. I could have eaten two whole dishes of that, solo.\n\nFor my main, I got the steak. The steak was fine--cooked properly, cut into six generous strips, and served with small potatoes and onions over mushroom sauce and raclette cheese. The steak wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was completely serviceable. Unfortunately, the fish my companion got was bland. It was served with some tasty brussels sprouts, but honestly, even with the crust, it could have used some salt.\n\nThis place has been around a long time--almost eight years--and so they must be doing something right.

We both ordered the chicken salad, and shared some shishito peppers and nuts to start.  The peppers were fantastic and perfectly roasted.   The first peanut I tried was stale and it seemed like they had been roasted to hide this fact; the rest turned out to be just fine (not great).  The nuts were so hot when they arrived at the table that my colleague burned himself.  \n\nThen our salads came.  Here's the thing....romaine or a heartier lettuce can withstand the grill and turn out quite delicious.  But the baby gem lettuce in this salad just becomes wilted and grossly warm.  Top that with a couple of slices of apple (maybe 4-5) and a few SMALL bites of chicken (again, maybe 4-5 MAX) that could honestly have come from a can, some sort of warm, mayonnaisey dressing, and you definitely do NOT have a $21 salad entree.  Not even close.   \n\nI remember going to Town Hall for a very special date with my husband once several years ago when we really could not afford it, and thinking that Town Hall had a great reputation so we would definitely love it.  Our experience then and my experience today were similar.  This restaurant is overrated.  Thankfully this meal was on the company or I'd be livid.    \n\nThe one good part of our meal was dessert.

They are part of the Stock And Bones group (owners of Anchor & Hope and Town Hall) so I had high expectations for them. Unfortunately, I thought they were just ok.\n\nSalt House is smaller than A&H and Town Hall, but they've crammed as many tables as possible into their modest space, creating a very crowded and noisy environment. My hearing isn't the best, having abused my ear drums with Oingo Boingo cranked to ten through headphones during my teenage years, so carrying on a conversation with others can be a challenge here.\n\nTip: Get a reservation. Lunch or dinner, it doesn't matter. Open table through their website. Super easy. Or be prepared to wait.\n\nOnto the food!\n\nThere were four of us and we were pretty hungry, having to wait for a 1pm reservation, so we dove right in with appetizers: a dozen oysters and an order of poutine. They only had one kind of oyster on the menu: Kusshi from British Columbia. The kusshis were characteristically small, sweet, and clean. As someone who prefers the brinier East Coast varieties, I was a bit underwhelmed, but ate my trio nonetheless. I recognize that if oysters are what you are looking for, you skip Salt House and proceed directly to Anchor and Hope, but I thought that being with the same owner group, the quality and taste would be to par and I didn't think they matched up very well.\n\nThe poutine consisted of perfectly fried French fries, with a nice crispy outer shell, covered in a white mozzarella cheese sauce and gravy. It was fairly light on the curds. My friend described them as being very good \"unless you're a poutine snob.\" Now I don't consider myself a poutine snob, but I am from Canada (believe it or not) and I have enjoyed my share of Montreal poutine. I didn't think the poutine here was very good. The flavors were just too far to the bland side. Still, a decent effort.\n\nOk, maybe I am a poutine snob....\n\nFor lunch, I had the grilled chicken sandwich. It was served on an crusty artisan bun with a very light salad. The sandwich itself was excellent and if I did come back I would have no problem ordering it again. My friends got the heirloom tomato sandwich (x 2) and the duck confit hash. The hash looked amazing, save for the fried egg that sat on top of it. I don't eat eggs, but if I did, I might have given the confit a try. He seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAll in all, it was a good lunch, my disappointment likely a result of high expectations. The service wasn't too friendly, but certainly very efficient. They had us in and out within an hour.\n\nOn the downside, they were on the pricey side. All in all, the lunch for four set us back $180, but that's sorta what you expect when you come.\n\nSalt House was certainly good enough to come back to, but given the wealth of amazing restaurants in very close proximity, I'm not sure if I will be back...", "author": "Devin A."}

The piquillo pepper sauce was mild and added moistness to the sandwich. There was a nice balance between the ratio of protein to veggies, so each bite provided a bit of each. The sandwich comes with a side of house made potato chips which were less than desirable given that they were very thin and had a lackluster crisp. I'd swap the potato chips for a side salad or something in general. After polishing off the entire sandwich, which is a reasonable portion, I was a bit taken aback when the waiter commented on my ability to finish the plate.... \"Girrrrrrl, you did good. You must have really liked it!\". I didn't mind the comment but was a little surprised given the atmosphere feels a little more \"upscale\".", "author": "Julia K."}

The place is buzzing with hungry diners and attractive FiDI business types. Although our party of 6 had a 12:30pm reservation (which is definitely recommended, BTW), we still had to wait 10 minutes before we were finally seated. So be warned: if you are coming in for lunch, allow more than an hour to dine. But I'm totally cool with taking my time, because this is a special place. The food and dining experience here is something to be savored - not rushed.\n\nOur table wound up splitting some appetizers, including the refreshing citrus salad, the ahu tuna tartar with avocado/peanut sauce/potato chips, and their delicious (yet artery-clogging) Poutine - which is essentially French Fries topped with mozzarella cheese curds and short-rib gravy. All of the above items were winners. And our friendly server brought out fresh baked bread with creamy butter. Even if you hate carbs, this chewy bread is hard to pass up.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of a let-down was my main dish. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi (a Vietnamese inspired sandwich topped with sambal yuzu aioli green papaya & mango slaw). The sandwich was fine - just nothing memorable. And let's face it - for a fraction of the price, you can get a much better/more authentic Banh Mi in the Tenderlon @ Saigon Sandwich.\n\nSince it was a working lunch, we abstained from wine and ordered the Bruce Adams - a delightful Mocktail made with grapefruit, ginger, lemon, and soda water. De-lish!\n\nService is friendly and top-notch.

For the ultimate experience, the fries must be hot, the cheese curds must be cheddar (from unpasteurized milk -- hard to find in the US), fresh (never refrigerated) and the gravy must have a thickness sufficient to have the cheese slowly melt onto the fries without making the latter mushy. \n\nI tried this poutine on two occasions. Their beef gravy (with added short-rib) was rich and complemented the cheese well. I was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, the fries were average being not crispy and, on the second occasion, actually felt like they had just been reheated. It wasn't the right cheese (what's up with chefs melting the cheese in the oven) and ended up being bland. If it hadn't been for the gravy, this would have been a pretty bad poutine.  \n\nMajor thumps up for offering Unibroue's La Maudite on tap. The Quebec amber belgian strong ale (8% ABV), with it's heavy spices on the nose, complemented the poutine perfectly and added to my experience (and made my walk back to the hotel somewhat tricky).", "author": "Simon B."}

In my mind experiencing is believing so when I visited Salt House to celebrate a recent success I had a work, I was pleasantly surprised by everything from the greeting from the host, to the verbose descriptive poetry about the food from our server, to the outstanding food. Here is the breakdown: \n\nSERVICE (5 out of 5): \nBrilliant service across the board. Been here twice now (had to go back to confirm its awesomeness) and both times the service was incredible. The 2nd time I was celebrating my roommates last day in SF and we were delighted with some free champagne to start things off. That about sealed the deal for me. I was knee deep on Salt House after my first visit but after being brought free champagne to start my 2nd visit I was all in...\n\nFOOD (4.5 out of 5):\nAbsolutely freakin' incredible. Some of the best dishes I've had in the city without a doubt. Complex flavors are distinct and wave through your taste buds with a pleasure reserved for only the best restaurants. You won't get a bunch of things just blandly mixed together with no \"real\" taste for anything specific. No no, not at all. \n\nPoached Egg - Do yourself a favor and get the Poached Egg. Best appetizer on the menu. Qual Egg was really good but Poached Egg was better. They change this all the time but it was rich and creamy then smokey before finishing with pork goodness. Various textures worked perfectly together. Brilliant dish, just brilliant. \n\nPork Loin - Very, very good if you are a meat lover. Loved the glaze and it went very well with my wine. Really enjoyed this dish and highly recommend it. \n\nBeef Duo - Had a specially prepared Beef Duo so not exactly the one on the menu but despite the fact it paired perfectly with our Duckhorn wine it was just a tad bit below the Pork Loin in my opinion. Both excellent dishes though and highly recommended. \n\nCaramel Espresso Mousse - Good dessert but not great. If you like chocolate and espresso flavor you will like it. Nothing more. \n\nCarrot Cake - Loved it! Really moist, rich, and the frosting was incredible. Reminded me of the carrot cake from Kara's Cupcakes. Fantastic dessert. \n\nTIP THAT WILL 10X THE EXPERIENCE: \nThey have a $20 corkage fee on a bottle of wine so go buy something expensive, enjoy, and save some money. \n\nOVERALL 5 out of 5): \nI'm sold and all in on this place. Hands down one of the best spots I've been to in SF when looking at all categories from service, atmosphere, food, wine, etc. You will not regret going to this place. It's fantastic!

What's great about this place was the location it's right downtown.\n\nThe atmosphere in the Salt House was warm and hip. They have this pretty painted art on the wall, brilliant and really adds to the ambiance. I like the lighting it felt very elegant.  Great place to go for a group of friends or family, not really on a date since it can get a bit loud.  Bad acoustics. I love restaurants with open kitchens seems like the owners are very proud of their food and want it on display for everyone to see. I love that they give you Acme bread and butter while your waiting for your order.\n\nI had the double ranch New York Steak. Delicious! Meat was tender, the mushrooms and asparagus went well with the potato puree to give this dish so much flavor.  Also tried the Alaskan Halibut, I love Halibut and this was pretty tasty it menlted in your mouth. And for dessert the Urban Smore, oh wow the kid in me was jumping for joy. Rich and delighted just the perfect way to end the meal.  The reason for me giving it four stars is the slow service.

You gotta try it once before you knock it, right?  \n\nI was having a business lunch here & admired the sleek, industrial shiek loft feel of the restaurant upon arrival.  We were presented with my favorite bread...the pain epi from Acme!  Bonus points just for that!  The three of us shared the Poutine ($12) & I got the steak frites ($24).  The Poutine was total gluttony, but everything worked so well.  The gravy, cheese and fries, I couldn't stop picking at it!  The portion was also generous.  The flat iron steak was grilled perfectly, tender & so juicy (medium rare..the only way to go)!  The herb butter I could have done without, the mixed greens side was fine, and the fries were delish!  Crispy, thick enough and seasoned well.  \n\nSo what keeps this only at a 3?  The horrible service!  I know they get really busy during the lunch rush, but it's badl!  Our waitress was okay, but I felt like she wasn't very timely & the lunch was over an hour and a half.  But our waitress was a total angel compared to the bus boy from hell!  This guy doesn't ask if you're done, or at least to us he didn't, he just takes your food.  He lifted our plates without saying anything, & I was like, \"we'll take a box for our fries.\"  He then puts the plates back on the table tells our waitress this and then she walks off with the plates & doesn't even come back with it til after she gives my coworker his credit card back.  But even before this, when the bus boy was taking our bread plates away (mind you again, without even asking) my hand was right in front of my bread plate with my butter knife on it..he grabbed it so fast that it poked my finger.  At least it was a butter knife, but still!  This guy needs to learn manners!!\n\nOne of my coworkers loves this place, so I may be back, or just come back for dinner with my homeboy who frequents this place a lot.

The restaurant isn't really that big and there were single tables facing the window below a flight of stairs that go up to the mezzanine. I suppose those were also reserved as well for lunch. I'm not a real big fan of sharing a table with other patrons that I don't know at all.

The Duck Terrine was served with shredded pieces of kumquat, pickled veggies, and several pieces of croutons. This is the first time I have tried duck prepared this way. I did a little bit of reading beforehand to understand how it was made. It's certainly an interesting dish for an appetizer. The Moroccan salad contained mint, tangerines, chickpeas, almonds in a spicy dressing. It was served with flatbread on the side.

The two stars are for the ambiance alone. \n\nThe food, I have to agree with many others on here, was very uninspired. I had the Cod ($29), my partner had the Sole ($32). The components of each dish were decent, the Cod came with some muscles and the sauce it sat on was tasty. The fish itself, as Ironic as it sounds could have used some Salt. Both were very bland, to the point where we stopped eating and mentioned it to each-other. Usually in these business dinners if the food is half way decent the conversation moves on quickly from food to business, not this time. We spent a lot of the meal shocked how a place that looked so great, was set up to be awesome, the menu came across really strong fell so flat on its face. \n\nIf you are looking for a cool place to go have a drink the \"Salt House\" may be for you.

The raw tuna appetizer was pretty standard and sitting in a light soy sauce.  The poutine fries were good but I personally thought it would be better with some meat on top since it's basically a mound of fries with gravy slathered on top.  Then the pork entree was ok, and was more on the overcooked side.  Along with the vegetable sides, the dish was actually lacking flavors and on the bland side with a pop of citrus (kumquats) that was rather sour. Then I had the Panna cotta for dessert which also was not silky but super firm with a scoop of citrus sorbet throw on top which was icy and really didn't go along well.  I was also a lil disappointed given it was the same that we received earlier as a palette cleanser.

My burger was way overcooked despite the server explaining that they tend to err on the undercooked side. Despite the huge blob of mystery sauce, it was absolutely tasteless as were the fries.  The carpaccio was completely buried under an excessive amount of microplane-grated cheese (that's soooooo over LOL).  Don't hide the featured flavors Salt House (sadface)!!

I really don't give myself the time for a lunch like that. My time often would be better spent to do it after work, but some work days I'm thankful that it could happen. We were lead here for a group lunch of 7, and their upper mezzanine was perfect for our reservation. Really, I couldn't imagine a better location for a group lunch, especially if it's a meeting and you want to be productive over it. The mezzanine maintains the energy but gives you the ability to have a full on discussion. \n\nThe service was really kind and steadfast. The menu gives everyone an option. You're going to spend $14-$20 a person. There's an anchovie kale caesar that skips that step of \"could you just replace all the greens with kale?\" \n\nNow, I don't often use quotation marks but when I do it means something. Thus, \"Poutine.\" So far... any \"Poutine\" in SF isn't Poutine. I'm no pro but spending much of the last 18 months in Canada, it's such a simple, terrific idea: fries, squeaky cheese curds, gravy. America so far from what I've seen adds to much to it -- shocker! This one has wild boar gravy and meat. Word. It's fantastic \"Poutine.\" \n\nFor a meal to go from gluttony to tempered healthy tartare to kale isn't common, which speaks to how rare of an experience Salt House really is. It's American (New) and often that doesn't mean a thing, but it does here.", "author": "Jon A."}

They're ridiculously successful in this front, having found and occupied a prime niche located smack dab in the middle of their target market's favorite dwelling place.\n\nThe food is good and you won't hear me alluding otherwise, but as I said they provide rather small portions for the price. \n\nSalt House's downside is its popularity. It is a high demand spot, especially if you're thinking of going during a weekday lunch around noon. Thus, Salt House works to cram as many tables into its space as possible, including the narrow alley of a window display that exists between the staircase to the second level and the front windows.

On each occasion I've booked a reservation through Yelp's link to the OpenTable online reservation system . . . which is simple \"Clockwork\".   At Salt House I've been consistently very satisfied with the overall dining experience, the attentive service, and the high quality meals.  Salt House is located on Mission St. in the vibrant SOMA area . . . (that's \"South of Market\" St. for you non-San Franciscans).  \n\nThere's something about the ambiance at Salt House that I find particularly appealing . . . although I can't quite put my finger on exactly what it is . . . perhaps it is a combination of the old red brick industrial style building . . . the high ceiling . . . the relaxed bar adjacent to the dining area . . . the white table cloth tables . . . the stairs leading to additional seating in an overlooking balcony/loft type area . . . along with the friendly reception and table service.  Whatever it is, it makes for a very satisfying experience.\n\nA few of the plates I have enjoyed and would recommend include the Salmon, Sole, Tagliatelle, and the Burger (particularly with Blue Cheese).  My personal favorite is the Grilled Chicken Paillard, served on top of a green salad.  The Marinated Olives or the Yellowfin Tuna are nice openers/appetizers.  All selections have been very very good, with nice presentation -- many of the photos on Yelp will give a good sense of their presentations.\n\nNoise level can be slightly above average, but I wouldn't consider it to be a 'loud' environment, at least not at the lunch hour.

Nice modern space, comfortable bar and tables, and 30s/40s downtown crowd.\n\nWe shared a somewhat odd appetizer combination of a dozen Kumamoto oysters on the half-shell, and an order of poutine (french fries covered in cheese and gravy). Odd, but delicious. The oysters came with freshly-grated horseradish, which gave the cocktail sauce (which I assume also had some) a nice fresh upgrade.\n\nFor my main course, I had the pork chop, which was the clear winner at the table. It was a thick, nicely-marbled hunk of pork loin, pre-sliced over a heap of green onion spaetzle, root veggies, and bacon. Fortunately they left the bone standing up on the side of the plate with a little extra meat on it, which was delicious. 5-star dish.\n\nBy comparison, the sea bass that my friends both ordered was small and unimpressive. They seemed okay with it, but I kept giving them bits of my pork chop to keep them happy.\n\nService was friendly and attentive, and the space is nice.

I would have expected the mistakes made to come from a Denny's (not to hate on Denny's since they've proven to me to have better customer service) or even a drive through window restaurant. My group of 4 decided on this place for a late lunch to catch the happy hour for a birthday celebration. It was supposed to be a nice surprise and the nice part was ruined. We definitely got a surprise experience though. We ordered a round of white wine for the table, they brought us one glass...excuse me but seriously?! You took the drink order for a table of 4 and brought back 1 glass? I assume the issue here began when we got seated by the host, that took the initial order, then served by 2 separate servers that had no idea what was the status of our table. We had to re-order the Wine with both servers so that we all got our own glass and ask for water just as often. Frustrating enough that was, we still haven't gotten to ordering our food... After the drink order disaster I personally decided against food. However, the birthday girl and one friend were starving and placed an order for the Cheese Sandwich each. We later got served 2 cheese plates. Had no idea what that was about till later asking why we got servers cheese plates and where the sandwich's were?! Turns out the server put in Cheese Plates and not Cheese Sandwich's. By this time it was well over 45-50 minutes and never ate. Imagine a birthday lunch with no lunch served. UGH!

All the little Yelpers keep complaining about the cost, but it is comparable to any other restaurant you'd find at this level.

It was beautiful to look at and had perfectly bright flavors. A super tasty start to a big meal.\n\nNow the Poutine. A decadent dish that I would only eat maybe annually, so it had better be worth it! It was prepared classically and right on mark. I don't know what the guys secret is to the gravy (the most important detail of a good Poutine) but it is phenomenal!\n\nThe steak was cooked to perfection and I loved the texture of the little wheat berries that accompanied it- who woulda thunk wheat berries with steak?

Sat on the top deck which overlooked the ground floor, kitchen and bar. Pretty cool since it felt more private yet we had the view to observe all the happenings if we chose to. \n\nAll 4 of us started off with the chilled (something) soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jk1T4xIb_FH_SsiVng43HA?select=JTmk1Qm3umJbgK8Ws5Y1bg). Potato? None of us enjoyed it nor finished it. The soup was too chill. The consistency was creamy yet liquidy. The flavor was nowhere to be found. To me, it tasted like alfredo from a jar. Made my stomach queasy.\n\nHowever, the second dish won us back. Braised pork shoulder with white polenta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jk1T4xIb_FH_SsiVng43HA?select=6pyHMZ7ZCQUjgNpdhjVjAw). The pork was served in cubes with a tangy barbeque-like sauce. The meat was tender with tons of flavor. The white polenta was creamy with bits of lumps. Never had polenta served like that before. Sooo good. It was a very hearty dish, and the highlight of our meal.\n\nFor dessert, had the milk chocolate pot de creme (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jk1T4xIb_FH_SsiVng43HA?select=6G9WlxY6gpqrAp0gnaHTRQ). Literally was what it sounded like, a pot of cream. Layers of chocolate pudding-like cream, each with a different amount of richness and chocolate flavor.

Place was booked for a table of 2, so we sat at the window, which we were perfectly fine with. \n\nEverything started off fine as we rolled through the menu and talked about how everything looked delish. 15 minutes roll by and the server comes over, no introduction, no hello, just a \"what are you having?\" In the rudest time ever, ps the restaurant is still empty. I'm sitting there like \"can you say hi, introduce yourself, tell us about any specials, or maybe asking if we are fine with water\"...seriously rude. So we tell him to give us another minute...guess a minute to him means 20. \n\nSo we finally order. My soup comes out (the butternut squash - extremely good but it was like warm) and my coworkers salad comes out. We finish our starters and then the wait happens. The server NEVER comes back around while the tables behind us are already done with their meals and other groups are being sat. FINALLY an HOUR later out main course comes. I ordered a salad for my main course and my coworker ordered the mussels. Like it really takes an additional hour for those two items? Oh and did I mention his mussels were cold and when we tried to find the server to tell him he was no where to be found. But when we wanted the check he was there instantly. \n\nOverall, the food is decent, our server needs to be fired or leave his personal issues out the door. It's truly a shame, as I work a block away and was hoping to make this place a regular spot but one server can ruin the overall experience. \n\nI would say check the place out as the good is good, but don't have too high of expectations for the rest of it.", "author": "Lindsey M."}

But I don't have a good experience.\n\nDine About Town's menu:  $17.95 for two courses.  The selection was very limited; two items from Course 1 and two items from Course 2 to choose from.  Course 1:  You can choose from salad or soup.  Course 2:  Salad or other dish that I forgot.  I think the combination was very weird.  \n\nMy auntie and I both chose the soup (forgot what in there) and the Chicken Salad.  The soup came with a LARGE plate and the portion was ridiculously small. It only took one minute to finish the soup.  The taste of the soup was good; very creamy and rich but the portion was too small.  I think the water bowl for my dog was even bigger.  \n\nThe portion of chicken salad was much better.  It came with four tiny pieces of flat bread.  The salad was soso.  The dressing was weird and the flat bread was hard, cold and overcooked.  \n\nThe service was bad.  Our waiter was not friendly at all.  He had no smile on his face.  It seemed like we owe him a lot of money.  He did not even check on us after he served the second course.  \n\nThe bill was about $39 without tips.  We gave $60 (because of no change) and waited for 5 minutes for him to come.  He said,\"change back?\"  We were like.....Are you kidding me?  I don't think we will pay more than $10 for this kind of service @_@\n\nOverall, Salt House is just ok.  It is kinda over-priced restaurant.  The ingredients they use are fresh and the dishes are prepared well (the presentation of both dishes were nice).

She may have been a manager.  The drinks were brought out pretty quickly.  There was also some nice bread and water brought to the table.\n\nThere was a little delay before our food order was taken.  We placed our order.\n\nThe food came out in a timely manner.   Our server for our meal was professional and polite but I would not say overly friendly.\n\nI ordered their burger with cheddar cheese.  It comes with a plentiful order of onion strings.  I requested the burger be cooked to the chef's preference.  This ended up as a very nice medium rare.  The burger was a good one.  It was not a huge burger.  The meat was quality beef though.

The pricing is certainly high given the flavor is way on the low end of the scale and the service dismissive. Multiple servers were cold and lifeless.\n\nI wasn't in a seafood mood which cuts out about half the menu so I had the $17 burger (actually I think it was about $20 as I added avocado). The meat came out beyond well-done even though it was ordered medium-well, a big thick dry patty with zero flavoring. Also it tasted fishy, I think it was cooked next to or just after one of the seafood burgers, gross. The bun looks fancy but is flavorless. Fries are super dry and lack salt or seasoning, so I asked for dipping sauces (ketchup and ranch) for myself and co-worker who also had fries as there is no sauce at the table. The guy brought back 1 very small side of ketchup (like 2 tablespoons) and a little Tabasco... They don't have ranch and apparently it's unusual to get ketchup with your fries. Anyway we had to ask him to get more ketchup as obviously it wasn't enough sauce for the two of us.\n\nOthers in our group seemed mildly more positive about their chicken wings, chicken sandwiches, and salads, but nobody was amazed by any means. Apparently the fresh juice drinks are refreshing, but they really are tiny as it's mostly ice. The sweet potato chips are good, but it's a tiny bar-sized snack for $6.

We also ordered their specialty drink - the Elysium dream (an Elderflower sparkling Riesling cocktail) at a whopping $16.

We started with oysters and poutine (a must for lil Canadian me). The oysters were really large and the accompanying sauce was delicious. The poutine was a bit disappointing- not a fan of the really salty gravy.. but the fries were really good.\n\nI ordered the salmon, bf ordered the steak.

Before we had time to check out the menu, Abby brought us complimentary champagne and a starter just for fun. \nA new pastry chef was starting on Monday and someone from the kitchen came up with a dessert that I can still taste. It was a white chocolate cake, that was served stacked thin at angles, (stacked like pancakes) on the side a carrot sorbet with tarragon that had a bit of a crunch and then a slice of dark chocolate and something gooey white.

It was as a summertime cocktail should be - fruity, strong but not too sweet.  She said it was \"decent\" and then immediately ordered another.\n\nThe Diva likes FRIED FOOD.\n\nThe last time I was here, the Poutine stood out.  You can't go wrong with fried potatoes and cheese but the rib gravy is what makes this dish memorable.  My friend agreed and dubbed it her favorite dish.  We also liked the perfectly fried and seasoned Shrimp that garnished the salad of Spicy Green Beans, Serrano Ham, & Almonds.  (But she was displeased that there were only four shrimp.)  However she did say,  \"I am impressed thus far.\"\n\nThe Diva likes SEAFOOD.\n\nShe grew up in N'awlins, so she's picky about her seafood.  I had the Petrale Sole and loved it mostly because was accompanied by a Sweet White Corn, Spelt & Squash combo that was fantastic! Especially as it was juxtaposed on the plate with a delicious savory Pesto.  She had the heartier Halibut with Pork Hocks, Porcini & Romano Beans.  She enjoyed it, especially the rich sauce, but we agreed that my dish was the better of the two.\n\nThe Diva likes SWEETS.\n\nThe Nectarine & Cherry Pie was calling my name but she doesn't \"do cooked fruits.\"  Instead, we had the Cookie Plate and it quite a plate!  There was a nice variety of about a dozen cookies.  We tried the classic chocolate chip (ok) and the butter cookie loaded with homemade gooey caramel in the middle (very good) before we cried uncle.

Plus Raina picked it & offered to pay...how could I refuse? \n\nWe arrived right around noon & the place was already packed. Since we didn't have a reservation (sorry, I'm not used to having to reserve a table at my usual casual lunch spots) we were seated at the cozy seats at the front window. By cozy I mean cramped, but we're both short so it was no problem ducking under the stairs & behind a crossbeam to get to our seats. This ended up being a cool place to sit cuz we had a great view of the hustle & bustle out on Mission Street. Oh, and we saw Joe Montana walking by. Another local celeb sighting! \n\nOur waitress was prompt & friendly & didn't mind that we decided to split everything. She even split up our butternut squash soup into 2 bowls. Nice touch! I love the bread they serve, I think it's Acme. It was great to scoop up the last remnants of soup out of the bowl. We also tried the poutine which is something I had never even heard of before. French fries, melted cheese, & gravy? Okay! It was very decadent and oh-so-good. I would definitely recommend sharing an order with friends cuz I imagine you might regret eating a whole bowl of it by yourself. \n\nOur main dish was the petrale sole with linguica & clams. The fish was cooked perfectly with a slight crunch on the outside. It was light but exactly what we needed after the carb-busting poutine. \n\nThis is a great little spot but definitely out of my price range for lunch ($24 for one entree is pretty steep).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-14", "description": "So I read the reviews after the fact of going there.  I guess the question is did I make a good decision?  Yes, very much so.  I read the 2's and 3's because I wanted to see what they complained about the restaurant.  I can say without worrying about being crucified that Salt House is a keeper and you would be missing out a real treat to yourself and those that you care about if you don't go.  This is the short version of it..below is the extended explanation of why I gave it 5 stars.\n\nIt started earlier last week with me making reservations.  I was indecisive because I didn't know her schedule nor the place that well but we tend to try new places and so I thought it would be nice to see if the place is worth the coolness.  Anyhow, after a couple calls (she was patience with making the reservation) I also mention to her that I would bring a signed bottle from my friend for my girlfriend and I to celebrate.  Although the information was on their website (maybe I should've checked before asking) about corkage she told me as though it wasn't which made me feel not so much of an idiot.\n\nI got there early because she was stuck in traffic so I presented them the wine and mention to them the occasion.   John asked me whether I want it chilled or iced.  I was perplexed until he mention to me that if I put it on ice the writing would disappear.  So they chilled it and I mention to them when to take it out and the prefer temperature, 55\u00ba degrees.\n\nBefore she arrived Caryn, our waitress gave me some pointers on what to have with the wine.  I was a blank canvas tonight.  She arrived, bottle disappeared into the restaurant.  We decided on having the salmon but before we had that she excused herself to the washroom.  I took that time to talk to Caryn about how to present the bottle.  I also placed the order for the salmon.  Caryn mention to me that the salmon would take some time so she suggested something before hand. Orders were placed and Caryn was gone.\n\nCaryn, appears to my girlfriend's left side and mentions to her that they don't have the bottle she choose but they have......she was surprised to see the bottle.  And I thanked Caryn so much for presenting it at the time I requested.  Soon after that our appetizers came.  Shrimp were tender and melted in the mouth.  We enjoyed half the bottle before our entree came.  After taking one bite of the salmon I almost forgot my name.  Everyone knew our names like we always went there and this was our first time.  Wow, simply wow.\n\nWarmness is something we don't take for granted and it was nice to be around individuals that actually were concern about us and not just collecting a check.  If I could tipped her more than I would.\n\nThere's no excuse in not going to Salt House.  Unless you don't want good food, service, atmosphere and a memorable experience.", "author": "Rickye J."}

Good rustic bread, good oysters, good poutine, good salad (although still not sure what a chicory is?), and my beef 2 ways (some kind of regular steak and then some beef cheek) was very good, especially all the other things on the plate.

Nice ambience, nice food, nicety-nice-nice.\n3.  Did I mention that someone else paid?  \n\nHere's the problem:\n\nSalt House feels like a million other places I've been to.  It's quite good:  the food is tasty, the bread on the table is superb, my chorizo stuffed calamari on garbanzos was delish, service was excellent, ambience was winning.  On the flip side, there's nothing that makes this a place I'd run back to.  Matter of fact, I'd try another place just for the variety.  \n\nI don't know what the \"it\" factor is that makes some places return destinations versus one-hit wonders.

Service was great and my water glass was never empty.  The poutine was tasty and I admit I'd order it again even though it wasn't blow-your-mind-amazing... but it's hard to turn down any kind of french fries topped with cheese, topped with gravy.  Just keepin it real. \n\nCame with a group and had a chance to sample the steak and salmon dishes.  Both good, but nothing that stuck me as special.  Neither was overcooked, which I definitely appreciated and I will say that the bed of corn that the salmon came on was pretty delicious.  I wonder if you could just order that as a side... \n\nI had the rock cod, and like the other entrees it was good (sorry, serious lack of adjectives here), but unmemorable.  All the different elements seemed appealing. The crisp chorizo \"chips\" on top were an interesting add on, but overall the flavors somehow seemed lacking and just didn't have that  \"je ne sais quoi\" that I was hoping to find.\n\nI hoped dessert might save the meal from becoming just any ol' meal, but was not impressed with the german chocolate cake.

Only complaint was the salmon was under salted & dessert was too much cake to ice cream ratio.

I was looking forward to it because we rarely go downtown and it was a cold evening to walk around and see the holiday lights and feel the downtown energy. It was great to try a new place.\n\nWe were assaulted upon entry with a small entry area crowded by 4 people at the bar which is smack up next to a standard door opening flanked by the host station with a stair about 5 feet away. There was so much commotion in such a small area, that it was very off-putting. We were seated right away so we didn't need to spend too much time in that small crowded area.\n\nThe second assault is on the ears - loud, loud, loud. And it is no wonder - hard materials everywhere including steel beams holding up the mezzanine and we were seated right next to the bar under the mezz, not for from the entry. This is not a pleasant place to sit, hard to talk, but I suspect it is very loud anywhere in here. Oh, and it is very dark so as is typical in high end restaurants, it is also pretty dimly lit. I am embarrassed to take out my flashlight on my iPhone, but it was all I could do to read the menu!\n\nOverall, the service was fine, attentive, friendly but a bit too perky. The food was pretty good - large portions and interesting mix of flavors. We had the pork loin which comes as a bone-in leg and a roast. The roast was so difficult to cut that I was building up a sweat. Fortunately, once I got bite-sizes, it was reasonably tender, a bit dry and average flavor.The potato\"souffle\" was the best item on the plate - light, rich and tasty. Also the bread is excellent, but not the reason one goes to an expensive restaurant.\n\nSo it was OK, but nothing stood out to make it memorable.

Very decorative dishes plated well, and tasty, creative selections.\n\nLong version:\n\nAfter a roller coaster ride of a day, the lady decided to come here since it was one of the few upscale restaurants open late on a Monday night (they seat until 10:15pm).\n\nWe had a good recommendation from our server, Josh, and settled on a French Grenache, which was delish.\n\nWe decided to go tapas-style even though some of the entr\u00e9es looked amazing.  Eventually, we settled on the olive \"snack\" plate, the mixed lettuce, the scallops, the white corn soup, the clams with sausage, and the foie gras - then we finished with the Red Hawk cheese.\n\nFirst off, the olive selection was very good...normally I wouldn't note something like that but since it was an orderable item and we like it, done.  The mixed lettuce was very fresh and the croutons were buttered brioche pieces.\n\nJosh was awesome and had the chef split the salad and the white corn soup, which was so good, I could've chugged a whole pot of it!  The scallops were PERFECT and just colored enough.  The weird thing about this dish, however, was the vegetable \"soup\" it came with.  While I liked the greens separately, in this particular dish with the scallops, it clashed and I think it would've suited something lighter like halibut better.\n\nThe octopus with fennel sausage and clams was BOMB!  Again, not enough for one person when done tapas-style, but seriously, can you really blame us for wanting so much variety?\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again...I'm a sucker for foie gras.  And before you get PETA all over my ass, check out Anthony Bourdain's video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABeWlY0KFv8.\n\nContinuing...they brought out 3 different kinds!  It's like Christmas in July.  Now because I know more about foie gras than the lady, I suggested to taste it in this order (which, oddly enough, is the same order I'd recommend to all of you).  Taste the smoked first, then the \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\", then the seared.\n\nThe smoked was very pleasant although, it was tiny.  Also the apricots or kumquats were VERY bitter and not quite ripe enough for the dish.  The p\u00e2t\u00e9 version was fabulous and so was the syrup/reduction...I think it was raspberry.  The seared was by far THE BEST thing of the night and the black currant syrup/reduction was absolutely heavenly.  I mean butter doesn't melt this quickly.  If I didn't have to worry about a balanced diet, I think I could eat seared foie gras every day at all 3 meals.\n\n\nIn between plates we were having a heavy discussion about how the day went and Josh came by to refill our wine and said \"Just have more of this and you'll feel much better.\"  He was also a highlight of the evening.  They closed at 11pm and we were there until 11:30pm.  He kept asking us if we needed anything else and said it was no problem since he'd be there late anyway.  He was funny and not hovering, but attentive.  This guys was a pro.  \n\nEven after we finished ordering he asked if we had room for dessert...after they'd closed their doors.  He said only one thing on the menu they couldn't do since the cooks were already gone, but everything else we could've ordered.  Since we'd already had such a decadent meal, we went with the cheese, which was a little softer than we had anticipated for cow's milk, but pleasant all the same...and the brioche it came with was like cake!  MMMmmm...\n\nThis was the perfect way to end a rugged day.  The ambiance was a typical loft-like SF joint.  I bet this would be an excellent place to have a private party or a business function that closes down the whole place.", "author": "Dylan T."}

After I left the lavatories I decided to explore. Behind a door or curtain, was back entrance to a night club.

Good energy to this place.\n\nTo begin with, you walk in, and are immersed in this environment of wood, brick, and windows.  Great space.  I really dig it.  Small, but good bar, and a really excellent mezzanine dining area.  Grabbed a couple drinks at the bar pre-dinner.  Quality over quantity when it comes to selection of beer and wine.  They were actually out of the beer I initially wanted, and I gotta say, their drink menu is overpriced.  We requested a seat up in the mezzanine once dinner was offered at 5:30.  We were the only party seated up their for a good 45 minutes and were afforded a wonderful view of the activity below, while being able to maintain a distance from the noise and energy.  Neat experience.\n\nStarted off with the Crispy Shrimp ($14) and Baked Oysters ($13.5).  The oysters sounded great with bacon, leeks, and spinach, but were underwhelming and bready.  On the other hand, the shrimp, served alongside spicy grean beans, serrano ham, and almonds were divine, offering wonderful contrasts of texture, temperature, and flavors.  This dish worked on many levels, most importantly of which was flavor.  Truly delicious.\n\nShared the Loch Duart Salmon ($25.5) for the entree.  Once again, truly a wonderful, tasty dish.  Served with brussel sprouts, ham hocks, parsnips, and pimento jus, the flavors complimented each other wonderfully, while still allowing the delicous salmon flavor to shine.  This was also a mild salmon, cooked perfectly.  Decent portion size, but I would have preferred a slightly larger piece of salmon for the money.\n\nDrinks are overpriced, but they offer respectable house wines at reasonable prices.\n\nThe Cranberry Financier (satsuma, brown butter ice cream, and toasted almonds) was a pleasant dessert, and served with a well made cappucino, offered a nice ending to a very good dining experience.\n\nSevice was excellent.  We were served by a gal from Houston who was friendly, well informed, intelligent, funny, and attentive without being obtrusive.  \n\nGotta remember that when considering value, one has to consider the quality of the food, and not just the dollars spent.  Wish portions were a little larger though.  That said, I'll be back to try some other interesting dishes for lunch and dinner.  Finally...they should start a happy hour!\n\nFood: 4\nValue: 3\nService: 4\nAmbiance: 4", "author": "Ethan R."}

Slurp!\n\nPoutine - Really good short rib gravy. And the fries didn't have traces of oil, which I liked. Of course, we got the cheeses on the side.\n\nAlaskan cod (little neck clams, parsley root, tomatoes, chorizo, salsa verde) - This was soooo good! One of the best fish dishes I've had to date.\n\nPetrale sole - This was also super delicious. The sole was grilled to perfection. The chorizo was almost like thin pepperonis.

I had explained that Mr, Kapoor was the general manager of Masraff's, one of the top restaurants in Houston and I wanted to eat somewhere with both good food and excellent service.  When we arrived about fifteen minutes early for our 8:30 reservation, I explained this as well to the hostess.  We had a cocktail at the bar, then were promptly seated at 8:30.  That was the beginning of the LONG wait.\n\nWe were next to the open kitchen and, the noise level was so high, we couldn't even carry on a conversation.  After 45 minutes, when our appetizers had not even arrived, the manager brought us a complimentary chilled asparagus soup.  I did not find it expecially appetizing.  When our sweetbreads finally arrived, we had almost finished our bottle of Lebanese red wine ( quite good ).  The sweetbreads were perfect, some of the best I've ever eaten and I practically inhaled them, I was so ravenous!\n\nI had ordered the roast pork loin which was also delicious, very moist and tender and not overdone.  My friends shared the salmon which they thought was quite good as well.\n\nWe did not order dessert but, because it was my other friend's birthday, they brough us a complimentary passion fruit cheese cake.  It was unlike any other cheese cake I've ever eaten - served in a small bowl, light and airy and light as a cloud.  I could have eaten half a dozen.\n\nI thought all the food was delicious although I didn't care for the asparagus soup.  The long wait was outrageous.  We did not get out of there for two hours...which wouldn't have been so bad had we been able to visit and carry on a conversation.  With the extremely loud noise level and the sound of pans dropping on the floor from the kitchen, I had a headache by the time I left.  \n\nThat is the reason I only gave the Salt House three stars.  I would not consider the Salt House an intimate, romantic dining spot - or even a place to go and catch up on a chat with a good friend...perhaps it's different at lunch or on a week night.", "author": "Carmen H."}

Yes this may be standard expectation from a bartender, but sometimes coming from NYC you still encounter the 'tude, so it's something I don't take for granted.\n\nWhen my friend arrived we decided to stay at the bar and eat there... always my preference. We started with the queso peppers, very good, but not for the faint of heart. I was told only 1 in 7 are spicy, but still gotta avoid those seeds if you're not a pro. I asked the bartender to surprise me between the two fish entrees - she chose the cod in clam broth for me and also recommended a different wine to pair with it. I loved the white wine she suggested, it was so vibrant and delicious, it went perfectly with my meal. The cod was good, it was by no means memorable, but it was fine. I wish I had tried my friend's halibut, it came with fava beans.\n\nI was in great company so it did make the evening nice and memorable in it's own way... it wasn't loud or boisterous, so it was a mellow enjoyable night.\n\nI did think the menu entrees were on the pricier side and that's coming from someone used to NYC prices.", "author": "Jess K."}

Sadly, the event was very disorganized and the food was just OK.\n\nTo begin with, the hostess had our reservation wrong.  I'd made a reservation for four, weeks in advance and she had us down for two.  There seemed to be quite a lot of drama about whether they could accomodate us.  Later when dinner was served, there were at least half-a-dozen empty seats, so I'm not sure what the problem was.\n\nThe first course was served about a forty-five minutes late; and we sipped our wine very slowly, hoping to still have some when the food it was paired with finally arrived.  Throughout the evening, the wine and food pairing never came out together.  Additionally, The restaurant was freezing.   The main course was way too salty, and I usually like things saltier than most!\n\nThe ladies' room was a disaster with water everywhere.  It looked like a toilet had overflowed and not been mopped.  There was water dripping off the sink and into a waste basket which seemed to be intentionally put there.  There was even a waitress in there who seemed to be primping and ignoring the mess.  I've seen better gas stations.\n\nThe one thing they did right was continue to pour wine generously through all of the disorganization.  While the open kitchen seemed like utter chaos, they kept the booze flowing which went a long way to smooth things out.

While I'm pretty sure this would have been a wonderful dish for those who are avid salad-eaters, I didn't like it so much as i expected a dish more focused on the smoked trout rather than the greens. Nonetheless, I have to say those few pieces of smoke trout were delicious haha.\n\nEntree-forgive me, but i forgot the exact name of this dish as it isn't updated on the online menu (must be a daily or weekly special); but it was a pan-seared petrale sole over a celery root puree. Despite not having the exact name of dish, I do clearly remember how delicious this entree was. The sole was perfectly cooked, well-seasoned, and nicely complemented with the bed of cabbage and celery root puree. Easily my favorite dish of the night. \n\nDessert - this dish is also not reflected on the outdated online menu, but i had an upside caramel pineapple cake with brown butter ice cream. I thought the cake could have been just a tad more moist and used also a pinch more of pineapple flavor or essence. The ice cream, however, was YUMMY. The brown butter flavor really came out in the ice cream and made it oh so rich and tasty. \n\nService: eh. It was decent during most of the night, though our waiter, when asked about whether he liked dish a or dish b more, simply responded \"oh dish b.\" No other comments, no other element of elaboration. Secondly, my date and I waited over 20 minutes for our dessert. The waiter assured us that it would arrive soon, but his promises were always empty. Disappointed w/ the service.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere was simply wonderful here. Great mix of old brick walls with modern elements of stainless steel. Great, lively environment that made my evening more enjoyable. I recommend sitting upstairs with a view of the downstairs dining room--it's very impressive.\n\nOverall, I think if I had chosen better dishes for myself, I would be praising the food element of this restaurant in this review. In all, I think even with a better choice of entrees, I would still rank this almost in equal standing to Range in terms of food. Both are very similar in decor, service, and food.", "author": "Nathan T."}

I am not sure what they served but it was delicious. My friend drank water. \n\nThis place has a nice ambiance.  Mediocre service. And slightly above mediocre food for the price point.

I knew from my previous excursion that it was best to order fatty, salty and generally unhealthy things, but I did want to compromise, so this is what we ordered:\n\nPoutine - Just as heavenly as I remembered. Although I would have preferred more gravy, the creamy, salty goodness came through in just about every bite.\n\nSashimi - This was probably the freshest, most top-grade raw fish that I have ever had in my life. \n\nDayboat Scallops - One order was the gastronomical equivalent of a cocktease. That said, these easily knocked Bijou's scallop appetizer out of the water. \n\nIt was a smart idea to just share a few appetizers because we were almost uncomfortably full by the time we got down to the last bits of the poutine.\n\nOf course, date night would not be complete without desserts and alcohol:\n\nHuckleberry Financier - I am not gonna lie, just because I eat food doesn't mean I know everything about it, and when I saw this on the menu, I thought that shit sounded like Mark Twain's stockbroker. Turns out that this is a compote with almonds and huckleberries (clearly), and honestly I thought it was just okay, but the accompanying vanilla-lime ice cream was AMAZING. I happen to adore key lime pie, and each bite of ice cream tasted just like the pie in melty, frozen form. \n\nThe Green Door - Cucumber and mint served straight up. Very refreshing.\n\nViolet Beauregard - Apparently we were the only people in the restaurant who remembered \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" because our server seemed amazed that SOMEONE got the joke. This drink tasted like a berry smoothie from Jamba Juice in cocktail form. I love Jamba Juice so this one was my fave.\n\nMoscato d'Asti - There are two kinds of moscato on the drink menu. This one and the grappa. I should have ordered the grappa, but this provided a decent enough buzz, albeit not so much of the sweetness that I was hoping for. \n\nAs always, service was on point, despite how crowded the restaurant was (it WAS Friday after all).

Crispy skin and moist meat with just the right amount of doneness- a bed of sweet apple, cured meat bits and carrots compliment the fatty bird perfectly. I would order this again (1 star for this).

I then asked another wait staff for \"HONEY\" and \"MUSTARD\" and I blended honey mustard at the table myself. Seriously?

The location is super convenient (next door to work), and the food was good. The service was mediocre.  \n\nFirst, I do appreciate that they could get a party of three in for dinner around 7:30 with no reservation and basically no wait. \n\nWe ordered beer/cocktails, two appetizers, three entrees, and one dessert. The total bill including an 18% tip was $220 -- not too bad. I'm usually a more generous tipper, but the service didn't warrant it. \n\nThe beer list is great, and the two dark and stormy my dinner partners ordered were quite good. The waiter essentially refused to let us order food before our drinks came, even though we were starving and the drinks took awhile. This was just an annoyance. \n\nOne pet peeve of my business associate: the water is served room temperature in glasses with no ice. Sure, you could ask for ice. But who doesn't appreciate cold water? \n\nWe ordered poutine and blistered piquillo peppers. The poutine was pretty good. The cheese curds were melty, and the gravy could have been a slight bit saltier but was good. The peppers were mildly spicy, and had some sort of buttermilk sauce down at the bottom that was tasty. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the steak, which was very yummy. I ordered the roast chicken, which was very tasty. Generous portions, brussels sprouts on the side. Very good, and the cheapest thing on the dinner menu. \n\nWe split apple pie for dessert. We almost didn't order anything, because we had to ask for the dessert menu instead of being offered it. Once we'd ordered dessert, we.... waited. And waited. Once we basically flagged the waiter down for the check, it came relatively quickly. But then we waited for my card to be run, and waited to get a not-wet copy of the receipt for reimbursement. \n\nIn sum, the food was good. The service wasn't bad, and at a less expensive restaurant it probably would have been fine. But if you're paying $25 for an entree, then I expect good service.

But in every case, they were close, but I just can't give them high marks like I woudl the Publican.\n\nWhy?\n\nPoutine was made without Cheese Curds.  Had some kind of melted cheese, but it definitely was not curds.  That means it was cheese fries with gravy, in my book.  Also, the beer tap selection was not extensive.  If you are serving Poutine and Oysters, I want a good, Belgian Ale.  \n\nService was good, the ambiance was nice.  If I lived here and it was in my neighborhood, I might pop in from time-to-time, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.", "author": "Greg B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-09-29", "description": "Not too impressed. First of all, we were told that we HAD to make reservations in the \"balcony\" - the area overlooking the restaurant for a romantic dinner. We made reservations as recommended, but when we arrived, we were told that a \"large party\" had come in before us and they sat them all in the balcony. \n\nWe ordered the poutine to start, with me leading the poutine charge with the assent of my Canadian wife. While not bad, this variation was quite different from the traditional beef gravy/cheese curds/french fries that make the Canadian version so addictive. This version is much more \"Americanized\". Don't get me wrong, it was certainly palatable, with the short-rib gravy a tasty variant. As I ate, I couldn't disabuse myself of the thought that Salt House's poutine was cobbled together with these ingredients because they couldn't get such things as cheese curds or thick Canadian beef gravy. The Salt House variation was seasoned fries with graded Vermont Cheddar cheese and red-wine reduced short rib stock. Again, tasty...but certainly not poutine in the Canadian sense of the word.\n\nA review of the menu revealed a pretty nice array of foods. One thing that they have - just like every other trendy-but-out-of-business-in-two-years-restaurant-in-SOMA - is the overly-trendy sweetbreads. Really, Salt House? You couldn't find any other portion of the veal that was more disgusting to serve than brains? What...was the butthole gone or  is that not what all the hipsters are eating yet?\n\nThe portions were painfully small. These days, I'm eating less - and dinner is usually a salad or something small. These portions were about the size of a 50-cent piece...and way over-priced. The flavor was average. We ordered the chrispy shrimp for a taste. The shrimp was great...but the \"spicy green beans\" were absolutely, positively inedible. There was more cumin and cilantro than there were string beans. Note to the chef: MORE CUMIN DOES NOT MAKE A DISH MORE TASTY. It ruins the flavor when used by the bucket-full. Please - I'm sure that the tin of cumin doesn't say \"Dump entire contents into dish\" on the side label. If you're going to cook with cumin, it must, must, must be used sparingly to slightly flavor the food - not make you feel as though you've fallen face-first into Andre The Giant's armpit.\n\nWe also had the sweet corn soup, and luckily, that was quite remarkable. It was the best \n\nNow for the best part of the meal: I had the Rene Rostaing Coteaux du Languedoc, Puech Noble 2006 (white). My wife had the Sonoma Seghesio 2009 (red). Both wines were excellent, and both wines were perfect for after a long, long day.\n\nFinally -\nReservations: don't bother. You're not going to get what you want anyway. The staff isn't particularly attentive (I guess giving away reservations to other people keeps them quite busy), and they don't care if you stay there and eat or go somewhere else. It didn't seem as though the staff really cared at all. \n\nWe were told that this was a romantic place for dinner. Well, perhaps if you find standing next to a speaker at an Insane Clown Posse concert and having to yell at the top of your lungs to be heard by your date to be romantic, then Salt House is for you. The place is LOUD and I had to yell my order to the waiter and had to yell so that my wife could hear me. Come on - I'm not that old. This place was just too damn loud to be romantic.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind putting up with the indifferent waiters and don't mind the hearing damage, go try some great wine. Otherwise, try Scoma's on the Wharf. Salt House seems to be a food truck that's parked in one place permanently...and doesn't really care if you like their food or even come back again.", "author": "Ed D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "Don't let the droves of  bleach blonde hair and orange spray tans dissuade you, the food here is 100% legit!  Always a bit challenging to grab a table at the last minute, Salt House is one of the few high quality restaurants serving dinner late.  Every dish is packed with flavor and has some edge of reinvention to shapren its solid execution of well known favorites.  It gets 4-4.5 stars for the food alone with the extra rounding up to 5 stars for offering good food into the wee hours. \n\nPoutine: It's not your traditional poutine, but enjoyable once you get over that.  The short rib gravy (probably wine based) gave a higher level of sophistication than any Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois chicken gravy I've had.  The melted cheddar didn't add much so they probably should have stuck with squishy  curd.  I was neutral on the steak fry size instead of frites since it's all potato anyway.\n\nFoie Gras: I'll admit, I'm a foie gras fiend.  Most restaurants that serve it only serve either the fresh seared version or the torchon.  If by odd chance a place serves both, I'm alway tempted to get the seared.  Salt House transcends the dilemma by offering both AND two small bits of tea smoked duck breast.  The seared foie gras was awesome and I love the use of wild huckleberries in the traditional sweet contrast.  The torchon was standard, but tasty.  The duck breast was very rare and very smoky.  Definitely the Solange to the star Beyonc\u00e9 foie gras, but still quaint in small doses.\n\nPork Belly: The way I like it, cooked like over sized bacon!  There was some greenage below but I totally forgot about it while caught up in my pork frenzy.  Great crispy outsides with tender meat and soft fat inside.\n\nCassoulet: The beans were a tad large for my taste (butter beans?), but are more true to the medieval roots of cassoulet than the modern day smaller white beans.  The sausage was hearty and the duck confit was nice, but could have stood to be crispier.\n\nLemon Verbena Panna Cotta: This dessert jumped on the bandwagon of two widely popular trends in SF cuisine: lemon verbena (where was this herb a few years ago?) and the grotesque looking Buddha's hand.  Like Lady Gaga, not all popular trends are a bad thing.  The lemon verbena gave the creamy panna cotta a fresher citrus flavoring than traditional lemon/lime/orange varieties.  The Buddha's hand was thinly sliced and candied to a soft consistency floating in sugary syrup.  It gave a much more potent citrus burst which contrasted the fresh and subtle panna cotta well.\n\nBrown Sugar & Cardamom Ice Cream: This is so simple, yet so amazing and unique.  Why has no one done this before?  The brown sugar gives ice cream a very caramel and molasses tone that regular sugar can't compete with.  The slight cardamom was just enough to add a hint of complexity.  Also, super creamy!!!", "author": "Adam B."}

They pulled the old trick of serving a different vintage of the red wine we ordered (albeit at the same price).  It's like selling  a 2012 Mercedes when it's really a 2011 and hoping the customer doesn't find out. I get that sometimes they run out of a vintage and don't have time to update the wine list, but at a high end restaurant with a nice and expensive wine list, a professional waiter /sommelier spends the 15 seconds it takes to look at the wine they serve and ensure it's what the customer ordered.

The turnips were great as well. We couldn't resist, and ended up getting the poutine, which is essentially fries with short rib gravy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-11", "description": "When I heard that the owners of Town Hall (my current favorite restaurant in SF) opened up a new place last year just a few blocks away downtown, I was really excited.  Town Hall doesn't serve anything that is less than outstanding, and that's quite remarkable for the large New American menu they offer.\n\nLike Town Hall, Salt House features New American cuisine but in a more limited, precise menu.  Similarly, the aesthetic resembles Town Hall's with lots of exposed red brick and aged wood but here, the backdrop is cut with striking hanging modern lamps throughout the single long dining room, giving the space a sleeker, hipper look than it's older brother. \n\nAnd ah, the food.  It was outstanding.  I started with a rich celery root soup accented with pomegranates and bits of apple.  There was a touch of creme but it was really the well-balanced puree that gave the smooth, rich flavor; the fruit dancing above the soup (both in presentation and taste).  For my entree, I enjoyed the prime New York steak; generous sliced cuts of NY Strip layered between a mix of sauteed brussel sprouts and other savory vegetables, and a single delicious braised short rib.  I was in heaven.  I cleared my plate and had no room left for dessert unfortunately.  I did get a taste of Beth's fromage blanc gnocchi with kabocha squash and it was quite good as well (just not as good as my steak).\n\nService was on par with TH; friendly, knowledgable and attentive.

Ordered the mixed greens and a medium rare steak, which were both decent. My friends got the fois gras appetizer, which looked pretty appetizing when it came out with strawberries included in the dish, but they were dissatisfied with how small the portions of each were. Our table got fries and shrimp to share, and they gave us the halibut entree on the house as well! Actually, the halibut was probably the best dish on the table that night -- it was delicious!

It was good, from what I remember.\n\nSo my only criticism?\n\nThe server didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  I asked her about the Pork Loin, and she said she didn't know what I was talking about.  I looked up the menu again.  So they have a Beeler Pork Loin and Shank, that I had been looking forward to ordering all day, but turns out the menu wasn't updated on their website.  I looked it up while there, then asked again, and she said the site is updated everyday.  And I showed her, and finally she came around and realized that I was in fact showing her the website on my phone.  She said she would mention it to the manager.  Yes, this part of the story is too long, but I looked again today a couple of weeks later, and it still hasn't been updated on the website.  They should correct this.\n\nThe only other thing was that we ordered a dessert for my friend's birthday while he was in the bathroom, as a small surprise.  Which we told our server.  He came back, and then our server came back and set all the forks down in front of us.  The surprise that we had worked all of 5 minutes on was ruined.  \n\nI sound like I hated the server.  Not the case.  I'm sure we could be best friends and travel the world solving crimes.  \n\nAnywho.  At the end of the day, Salt House is highly recommended.

Discuss.\n\nI actually didn't eat dinner here, but four hours at the bar has to count for something, don't you think? I met a good friend whom I had not seen for quite a while, so we saddled ourselves onto the first two stools of the bar and stayed put in full-tilt chat mode. The entire menu is available at the bar, a good thing since the place is relatively small and cozy with a densely populated smattering of tables. On the ground floor of an old printing press warehouse, it has lots of masculine banker vibes in here with only a dollop of dot com arrogance and a dab of metrosexuality to let you know you're in SF.\n\nThere was an increasing blur of Ketel One cosmos in front of me, but somehow in between, we managed to try three solid dishes - a nice frisee salad with ricotta, caramelized beets and fennel, crispy shrimp with green beans and fresh Dungeness crab with fried baby artichokes. They were all in the $12-15 range, a little on the high side for appetizers but well-prepared in that haughty culinary manner reflecting an innate understanding of the type of customer who dines here.\n\nThe place got crowded quickly and stayed fairly congested throughout the evening. The bartenders were reasonably attentive given the streams of customers coming at them. With its proximity to the FiDi, Salt House caters to a professional work crowd. Hippies in flip-flops need not apply nor anyone with a credit card with a low spending limit.\n\nUPDATE - 4/25/2007:\n\nHeart be still, as I was able to sit at the revered community table in the center of this tiny, tony restaurant. The dynamics in table positioning are a startling exercise worthy of the wonderful flora-and-fauna series, \"Planet Earth\". Call this episode \"Territorial Dining Rights\". There were four of us who came at different times to the central area, and the glares of the women sitting at the end were on par with the show featuring the snow leopard stalking the poor, innocent oryx. Of course, if the snow leopard had a bad perm and cellulite, it would have been a more accurate analogy.\n\nBut I digress...the service improved since my last visit, perhaps the distinction between attentive bartenders holding court versus conscientious waiters maneuvering stealth-like around the squeezed table. I also got to try other dishes thanks to my friends - a ramekin of marinated olives and a mixed winter vegetable plate with all sorts of beets and fiddlehead ferns. Delish. Still sticking with my 4-star rating until I can save enough shekels for a full dining experience here.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...nice appetizers, good combo of flavors but kinda pricey\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...plenty of wood and brick and rusted metal for the suit set\nSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive bartenders...though I think it would have helped if I had cleavage...conscientious, stealth-like waiters\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice FiDi alternative...if you're on an expense account", "author": "Ed U."}

My dashing date and I shared Salt House's take on the much-loved Canadian favorite poutine and a delectable Kabocha squash and chestnut soup to start. It was a struggle to decide on our main course but in the end our desires for the substantial won out and we went with the steak served atop creamy parsnips (I love parsnips!) The poutine was absolutely delicious with its perfectly cooked potatoes and super rich and meaty gravy. The folks at Salt House were kind enough to split our soup which was a nice surprise. I was equally impressed with the pairing of Kabocha and chestnuts - delightful!\n\nWe talked our dining companions into sharing the scrumptious butter pecan sundae with us. We needed all the help we could get - this dessert was so huge it easily served four people! \n\nAs far as the interior goes, the light was warm and I loved the postcard rack fixtures that hung above our heads. If you're seated near the communal table in the center, you're likely to get a lot of other people's backsides rubbing up against you as you dine - I watched this happen throughout our meal to my friend seated opposite me.

The french fries were thick and perfectly crisp, the cheese was abundant and the gravy was delicious. My one gripe is they were pretty skimpy on the short rib gravy. Tagliatelle with mushrooms was the tiniest portion I have ever seen (literally 4 small bites total), but was absolutely delicious. The manager also brought us the pork belly appetizer when he overheard my Mom say she didn't like mushrooms. The pork belly was the definite show stopper! \n\nFor entrees we had the chicken, beef and ling cod. The chicken was the best I've ever had, the beef and short rib combo were a huge hit, and the ling cod was perfectly cooked and delicious. The garlic puree accompanying the fish was to.die.for. \n\nWe passed on dessert, but were pleasantly surprised when they brought us a crustless cheesecake in a jar with berries. I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but this was AMAZING. \n\nAs you can see, I am a bit obsessed with Salt House and our wonderful meal. The service was impeccable, from our waiter at the bar, our waitress at dinner, the manager and the personable chefs in the open kitchen. The food was outstanding. Space is pretty small and cramped, and the noise level is quite high, but the service and food make you forget about it really quickly.  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Erinn C."}

The interior http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/TQ3Uz7936LhdsJ7BB23Wwg/l has a modern loft feel that's very open with a heavy emphasis on the brick and wood decor.

Upon deciding where to saciate ourselves, there were two variables that had the most weight:  reliablility and walking distance.  And thus, 6 blocks later we arrived at the doors of Salt House on Mission Street.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to go to Salt House instead of trying something new?\" asks boyfriend.  \n\n\"Spencer (lil' brother) is only here for another couple of weeks.  If he is going to try any restaurants with us, one has to be Salt House.\"  Salt House has ambiance and class.  It also has flare and attitude.  I hate walking into a restaurant and leaving bored.  I also am not a fan of being confused and disoriented by a mis-matched decor and a whirlwind menu.  Salt House takes those items we love and makes them better.\n\nThe best part about Salt House is that you can dine there to celebrate something special or just because.  This evening I would find myself in a light quarrel with the boyfriend.  We sat down and examined the updated menu. A poutine appetizer (images quickly sent to friends in Montreal a la Facebook); froie gras (because its going to be illegal next year FYI); lightly battered quail over fava beans; braised short ribs.  The little brother noticed the boyfriend and I needed to 'have a chat' and excused himself to the restroom.\n\nAll was handled by the time he returned and perfectly timed with our food (I think the servers were watching).  Usually, my appetite is the first thing to go when I'm upset; which is highly disconcerting for a foodie like myself.  Salt House has such a welcoming space and the exposed brick and iron support somehow made it ok that I too was 'exposed' at the moment.  I took a deep breath and started to eat.  \n\nThank god I did.  Once again Salt House has left this little foodie satisfied and proud.  It could be Tuesday day or Saturday night...either way, get your tail end over to Salt House.  It is a taste not to be missed.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Since I am an old old woman I like to have dinner early, right after work at around 6-630 pm and be home by 8 pm.  So I figured it would be easy to get in and out.  On this particular night our reservation was pushed back 45 minutes and the service was just slow slow slow.  I also am not a fan of restaurants that are so small that they put tables 2 inches away from the other tables.  You basically knock other patron's drinks down with your ass (or at least my big ass does) before you squeeze into 2 inches worth of space praying you won't have to cause an earthquake to make it to the bathroom.  \n\nAnyway after waiting quite a long time and then listening to my neighbors conversations for awhile we finally order.  We had the fries, which are a must - but honestly they could've been Mcdonald's fries it wouldn't have mattered.  We also had the tartare which was very standard.  I do like how they will split things in two if you are sharing.  The BREAD was outstanding, I may have eaten two loaves and was contemplating asking the waitress for some to go.  I also had the pork dish, which came with a fantastic corn side medley  - that was the best part.   \n\nThe food was good, but the waiting and slow service would make it hard for me to want to do that again.

We started with the poutine appetizer dish...it's pretty much steak fries covered in melted cheddar cheese and short rib gravy and it was DELICIOUS! Think of it as a neat twist on the typical chili-cheese fries. haha \n\nThen, for my entree, I had the salmon dish and it was a perfectly cooked piece of fish...tender and flavorful (I liked that they left the skin nice and crispy on there too!) I thought the veggie side that came with the fish was a little too salty though. The bread was also really fresh and tasty! \n\nOverall, the service was great...someone was always there refilling our water glasses, changing our dishes, and asking how we were doing. The only downside was that our entrees took a little longer to come out than we expected. \n\nWith all of that said, this is a cute place worth checking out and is decently priced (around $20 or more a person depending on what you order).

Overall Salt House was good but not excellent.  I'm glad I had a gift certificate and probably won't seek this place out again unless it's incredibly convenient.  The food is good - but not up to par with the prices in my book.\n\nCame here after ice skating at AT&T Park during Xmas-time... and we were hungry!  When I think back at what we ordered - man, it was a hearty meat frenzy!  I don't know how it happened that Boyfriend didn't insist on some veggies but veggies there were none...\n\nStarters:\nSuckling Pig with quince and huckleberries: this was good; very tasty combination of flavors.  I love sweet and salty together!  The pork was an odd texture - very tender, but maybe a bit dry too.  It had a wonderful crispy piece of skin on top and the quince and huckleberry sauces looping around the plate were a nice combination with the savory meat.\n\nFoie Gras with persimmon jam and something else I don't recall: I've never had bad foie gras and this was not an exception.  There were 2 small pieces; one cured (and cold) and the other sauteed.  I'm not a huge fan of persimmon so I didn't love that flavor with it, but the other [fruit] sauce was nice.  Cut a small piece of foie gras, dab it with the fruit sauce, put it atop a bite of bread - this alone could be one of my favorite flavor combinations in existence!\n\nEntrees:\nRoasted Lamb Loin with sunchokes, chanterelles and turnips: this was good and I found myself going for it more than our other entree.  The lamb was perfectly cooked - just barely medium like I had asked.  The sauce was nice and flavorful.\n\nBeef Short Rib with farro, cipollini and a porcini-marrow crust: the meat fell off the bone and was very tasty but still missing that \"amazing\" factor.  The sauce was yummy and the combination of flavors was very nice.  Farro is a small chewy grain for those who don't know.\n\nOverall nothing left a mark.  Nothing made me go \"OMG this is to die for\" - well, other than the foie gras, but I do that whenever/wherever I eat foie gras!

My friend and I asked where was a place we could get some good late night eats and check out the eye candy(seriously. i asked this.) and were led to the Salt House.  \n\nAs it was a thursday night, I'm not surprised that there was a good crowd of people.  We sat at one of the high communal tables (the only one that was available).  There was only seating on one side of the bench, so awkwardly intimate for two gfs that just wanted to chowhouse.  \n\nWe got some fruity pink cocktails as an appropriate welcoming to San Francisco, and ordered a few apps to share.  Octopus something (which was too salty), but a pasta dish and mushroom/fish dish that were both outstanding.\n\nWe also stumbled upon a networking group of IT VCs/Stanford Bschool grads out celebrating the acquisition of a new company.

However it was not busy when we went and we were seated relatively quickly.\n\nWe ate:\n\n\"yellowtail tartare\" - Why is this in quotes? Because they advertise yellowtail on the menu... yet they serve you regular tuna in the dish. Conversation with the waiter was as follows:\nme \"I'd like the yellowtail tartare\"\nserver \"Oh excellent choice the tuna tartare is very good.\"\nme \"wait, isn't it yellow tail?... hamachi right\"\nserver \"It is tuna\"\n\nI thought the guy was just confused, but no. It IS tuna tartare... not hamachi and therefore not really worth what they charged in my opinion. (That said, it was a different take on tuna tartare with the use of Asian pear.)\n\nPoutine - Pretty good, I liked it. But it's hard to fail fried items with fat (i.e. cheese). The gravy was a bit salty\n\nAutumn Salad - This was just ok to me. It was not bad, nor exceptional. Just fine, though it's something my mother would love to death.\n\nPetrole Sole - This was nothing special, although everything was cooked well. There were these little sausage like things in it, which were salty though.\n\nTai Snapper - the sauce they used for this dish was excellent, as were the chanterelle mushrooms. I would say the mushrooms were the best thing at this restaurant, I would order a plate of just that! As for the fish itself, I enjoyed the crispy skin on top and it was cooked well. Overall, it was pretty good.\n\nWhite polenta - I don't really like polenta, but I admit this was pretty tasty for poleta. The grana padano was good.\n\nShort rib - The sauce was too salty... it was full of flavor though. The short rib was cooked well, the meat was very tender.\n\nOverall... Salt House is just okay.

Wonderfully fried shrimp over a bed of green beans, with ham and almonds.  I don't know what kind of dressing it was, but it was almost like a sweet curry.  Very strange, but VERY good.  \n\nFor the entree, neither of us could resist the pork shoulder confit.  The pieces of pork are seared, so it's a crispy outside, and fork tender meat inside.  Wow.  And it's served over a white corn that's (for lack of a better term) almost like a risotto consistency.  It was amazing.\n\nNo room for dessert.  The portions are big, but they really do fill you up.\n\nWashed it all down with a refreshing lemonade.    What a meal! \n\nI believe is place is from the same owners of Town Hall (another top fave of mine) and like Town Hall, it gets really loud in here, so just be aware, this isn't your quiet, romantic hideaway type place.", "author": "Denise M."}

EVERY SINGLE THING on the left side of their menu under \"appetizers\" is simply delectable and yields an exquisite experience in your mouth.  The right side of the menu is chock full of excellent fish and meats - and the other night having dinner w/ KK here, I noticed they serve white polenta as a vegetarian entree.\n\nI heart polenta.  Given how much I love meat, it's really a huge compliment that I even considered ordering the polenta.\n\nThe crispy shrimp is a must-order dish.  Four perfectly cooked shrimps are accompanied by the most fascinatingly fragrant and delicious bunch of greens, including string beans, and doused in some amazing dressing.  Seriously, I could eat this every single day.\nThe other night, we shared the pork belly and oysters, too.  The Kumamoto oysters were as fresh and tasty as expected; the pork belly had KK moaning at the table.\n\nI have never been to Salt House for lunch; KK had never been here for dinner.  He says the lunch was just \"okay\" - but the dinner, Yelpers, is fantastic.\n\nThe NY steak we shared as an entree was also perfection (I think; don't ask.).  The kitchen splits everything very generously, and the service is ALWAYS topnotch here.\n\nSalt House is simply outstanding.\n\nJust whatever you do, do not go outside in the middle of dinner for a smoke break.

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it. ;)\n\nThe Salt House is a manly restaurant: brick walls, hardwood floors, iron beams. Unfortunately, the food was not as cool as the contemporary setting. We began by sharing the St. Simone oysters--our server advertised them as medium, but they were just a little bigger than Kumamotos. Why can't all oysters by plump and creamy?\n\nNext I had the potato and leek soup and the duck banh mi sandwich from the Dine About Town menu. I've actually never met a cold soup that I liked, but this vichyssoise was delicious! The crunchy taro chips and drizzle of olive oil complemented it well. The duck banh mi sandwich was good, but I'll let you in on a well-known secret: Saigon Sandwiches, roast pork-fancy pork-pate banh mi, $3.75, HEAVEN IN A HOAGIE! Chris had the halibut. It was crisp outside and moist inside, but man was it small.

It was just lame to pay for a spendy and tasty meal, but be annoyed by sub-par service throughout that took away from the experience.\n\nWhat is going on?

However, there were a few circumstances that were undeniably gross and insulting. \n\nWe showed up 5 minutes early for our reservation with an extra party. The hostess pitched a fit when we told her. In the end, they rotated a table and added an extra chair. Not a big deal considering the amount of money we spent.\n\nThe drinks and apps came quickly, and the foie gras was amazing. \nRight before our plates came out, we noticed a look come over one of our friend's faces. We looked to the open kitchen and watched as the head chef LICKED the spoon 4 difference times as he sauced 4 of the plates (one of which turned out to be mine). \nLet me preface this by saying, I do understand this is a nice restaurant and the chef wants to be sure his plates are going out perfectly. But for crying out loud- switch the spoon! \nWhen the plates came to the table, we mentioned this to the server who was mortified (but not surprised) and asked if I wanted mine re-plated. I didn't want to hold up the party and I'm not that big of a germ freak. \n\nMy sister then flagged down the General Manager (whose massive amount of chest hair must have been a health code violation) and was completely rude and unsympathetic. He told us \"Just to play devil's advocate, the chef wants to make sure his plates go out perfectly.\" Then he basically said, it was his kitchen and he could do what he wanted. Bad answer buddy. You work in hospitality. \n\nThe server then came by and said dessert would be on the house. This was a nice gesture. However, when the bill came, it was certainly NOT taken care of. We pointed this out and she said that she could only comp. one of them. She never told us that. In the end, she took care of all of them, as she should have. She was a very nice girl and we were appreciative of her efforts. \nMoral of the story: Chef is filthy and no one cares. GM is useless and should be fired.

So when the jackasses of Town Hall opened up Salt House, I had to try it.\n\nIt was a fairly mixed vibrant crowd on a Thursday night, from hipsters, yuppies, to a few groups of folks in suits and ties.  Too noisy for a romantic date, but definitely good vibe to catch up with friends.\n\nTo start, the wine list was just okay.  Although there were a few surprises on the list (the grenache and the like), I opted for a pinot from Oregon, just to be safe.  (The wine list at the restaurant was more extensive than the one on the website.)  \n\nFor appetizers, my friends and I shared the crispy shrimp and the baked oysters.  The shrimp really did not go well with ham (I removed the ham).  The oysters weren't exactly baked either -- it was baked bacon on top of raw oysters.  It was just too funky for my taste, even though I removed the bacon.  Thank goodness for that pinot to cleanse my pallet.\n\nFor entree, I asked the waiter to pick one between the halibut and the shellfish stew (they are not listed on the website menu).  She said, \"Definitely go with the stew!\"  And her recommendation was excellent.  The soup base for the stew was a light garlic sauce, with a hint of butter.  (I could almost taste the fat, but heck, it was too good to count the calories at this point.)  The portion was just right -- with two lightly-grilled scallops on top of a bed of mussels and clams.  It was just as delicious as the waiter described it to be.  Excellent. \n\nFor dessert, we had the rhubarb pudding and the chocolate bar to share.  The rhubarb was a hit, the chocolate a miss.  But it really didn't matter at that point, as I was still savoring that creamy garlic stew...\n\nMy friends had the duck con fit and the halibut.  They liked their entrees, although I could tell they weren't as impressed with their food as I was happy with mine.  \n\nOverall, I'd recommend to skip the appetizers, go straight to the entrees, and then hop back to Town Hall for that famous butterscotch...", "author": "Shirley F."}

But within 15 minutes, the place was packed! \n\nWe ordered the famous poutine for appetizer, and it was pretty good within the first couple of bites. The dish included fries with cheese and herbs. The server poured over hot gravy in front of us, which had bits of tender beef as well. It was my first time eating poutine, and it was an interesting combination. My favorite part was probably the beef bites; other than that, the fries didn't seem special, and everything felt too heavy after the first 3 bites.\n\nWe waited for about an HOUR before receiving our entrees, which was so ridiculous. My co-worker ordered the sole. I thought the sole didn't have flavor itself at all. The broth was a bit too oily for me, and didn't really compliment the fish at all. \n\nI ordered the pork shoulder and ribs. The ribs were extremely disappointing, as they were dry. There were no sauce really - it was only served with the leftover sauce from cooking it. Maybe because there wasn't excess sauce, the meat seemed dry? Doesn't really make sense, but I could only finish 1/3 of the ribs. The pork shoulder was a bit better. The pieces were way too small, but were tender. The pork shoulder was drenched in really salty sauce, and was complimented with jalapenos and this sweet white polenta. Not sure if I had polenta before, but it was pretty good at first bite. Afterwards though, it was overly sweet. Had to mix between the overly sweet polenta and the disgustingly salty sauce to get through about half of my pork shoulder. \n\nFinally, we ended with the pistachio macaron ice cream sandwich. The pistachio flavor was pretty good, and the macaron was nice and chewy. The fruits on the side was a bit too small and looked dry to me. Too bad the bottom macaron was drenched in white syrup, so it was, again, a bit too sweet for me.\n\nLastly, I wanted to note that the service was extremely terrible. Although our waitress always smiled at us, she was never attentive. She never even apologized for the extreme delay of our entrees. Our lunch ended up being TWO hours long, and we even saw the neighboring tables come and go before us. \n\nIt's sad to say that my favorite dish was the dessert. With the poorly seasoned and cooked dishes, and the extremely slow/lack of service, I don't believe I'll be heading back to Salt House again.", "author": "Evelyn S."}

It was a small portion but beautifully done - the skin was grilled & crispy, while the inside was medium rare the way I like it.  I'm not a foodie but I definitely appreciate crispy fish skin (very few cooks do it well).  It was served in a bowl of pesto-ish sauce with a hint of lemon, with crisp beans.  I really enjoyed the sauce, and I used it to dip my bread.    If it had been less expensive, I would come back here again and again - the food was that good.  The crispy fish skin, the crispy beans, and that sauce really complemented each other well.\n\nI went there with some colleagues on a Tuesday night and it was pretty crowded - I strongly suggest making a reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-22", "description": "I went to Salt House last month and have been slow to post my review of it. Based on a friend's recommendation, I stopped by after work one evening. The place was quite busy, I was alone, so I went without a reservation. Luckily I got a spot at the large communal table in front of the bar. Reservations are recommended unless you are not in a hurry. The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice, very lively and the staff are all very friendly. The mezzanine level adds a cool vibe, but it doesn't extend across the entire building. I did feel bad for the people crammed up against the window looking outward onto the street, anyone who wasn't petite might feel a bit claustrophobic.\n\nNow onto the food, the Veal Sweatbreads were calling to me. Pan friend sweatbreads, with high end smoked bacon chunks with sunchokes and rosemary honey. A lot of different textures, there was a definite smokiness to the whole dish, but the honey and richness of the sweatbreads all married well together. I paired this with a white wine by the glass, the 2003 Slovenian wine Movia, which is a Ribolla Gialla blend. This wine was oxidized intentionally and I would honestly say not for everyone. Personally, I felt the pairing was excellent as you need a strong white with good weight and flavors to hold up to such a starter. Wine geeks will love the wine, non-winos stay away. A very interesting wine to be served by the glass.\n\nFor the main course, I went with the braised short rib with a bone marrow crust. This dish on paper sounded delicious and even looked the part. I did find that the seasoning was underwhelming to say the least. Nothing worse than great ingredients used to make a dish that just needs a bit more salt. There were a number of interesting reds by the glass that I wanted to try, I was looking at the 96 Chianti Classico, but based on the servers recommendation I went with the Washington State Cab Franc, 2009 Wines of Substance. The wine was the highlight over the food, there was no happy marriage of flavors. The wine was decent and good for a by the glass selection, but nothing I would run out and buy. I will stick to the Loire Valley for my Cab Franc samplings.\n\nNo room for dessert, otherwise I would be 400 lbs. The evening started out great, I really liked the starter and the wines by the glass are interesting for winos of all levels. I will give Salt House another shot, but you can't under season high quality meat, especially when you add bone marrow on top of it. If I could I would give them 3.5 stars.", "author": "Robert V."}

Perfect spot to bring my mom for a little mother-daughter catch up time and a bit of celebration to boot.\n\nFirst off, the service here is always spot on. They really know how to treat their customers, from the easy wine pours at the bar (with a quick check for those waiting for a table) to the carefully thoughtful table service. You won't go without water, you'll get real menu recommendations and you hardly have to glance around the room before staff is at your side. \n\nOn our most recent visit we indulged in a dozen delicious oysters to start the meal. Kumamoto and miyagi were tasty, though the Fanny Bay won out as a favorite. Plus, the mignonette came with a spoon thankyouverymuch so there was non of that desperate forking at a small bowl of vinegar that often occurs. My dayboat scallops on a bed of sunchokes, brussel sprouts and delectable mini-mushrooms as an entree was perfect. Since I had eaten recently, this nice light seafood meal left me satiated but not full. A good compromise. Though for a hungrier belly - definitely try the poutine. So heavy but so worth it. \n\nOur champagne and wine were all easy choices, picked from a varied yet wonderful list of California options, though the list is extensive enough to include all major vine regions for your palate. \n\nWhether it's a date, a family occasion or just a treat - I'm happy to say that Salt House is always a solid choice.

Our group of five was seated just after 8 at a table under the stairs near the front of the house. I ordered a Makers Old Fashioned (more on this later) and the ladies chose a bottle of white wine. Service was friendly but not overbearing, with a wine guy opening our bottle and a cocktail server bringing the drinks. Our food server took time to explain several dishes to us and gave us plenty of time to choose. Our table was never without delicious baked bread and butter. \n\nFor apps, I had the tagliatelle with rabbit bolognese-amazing. This was some of the tastiest \"pasta with meat sauce\" I've had since Il Mulino in NYC. I had to pace myself with the portion which was on the smaller side. My friends had the crispy shrimp, halibut, and some salad that I tried and loved as well. \n\nI ordered the steak for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it. You get 5-6 thick slices of beef, veggies, potatoes, and an added gift of a few ounces of a tender cut of beef (short rib, I presume). The chef prepared it to perfectly medium rare. I also tried the pork chop and liked it, though I'm not a huge pork chop fan.\n\nNow, sufficiently stuffed,  back to the Makers Old Fashioned. We decided to have drinks with dessert and I re-upped for an OF. The cocktail server brought me the drink in a glass that was easily 1.5-2 times larger than the previous drink. I immediately dubbed it a cocktail worthy of Ron Burgundy or Don Draper and thanked the server. She said the first drink should have been this size, apologized, and removed it from our bill. This may be the first and only time a restaurant apologizes for not bringing you a larger drink. Oh, and for dessert we had a fruit crisp which everyone at the table complimented for it not being too sweet.\n\nOverall, a dinner I'll remember for a long time.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

The sharp white cheddar on fries with gravy was a delicious combination.\n\nBut the fish was overcooked, and the \"crispy\" fried shrimp was in a breading that was so soggy that our party left the last two shrimp on the plate.  Now, I don't know about you, but if there's halfway decent shrimp on the table, you'll have to restrain me from finishing them all.\n\nIt was also a little unfortunate that my fish dish was about a third smaller than all the other dishes people in my party ordered (including the other fish option...).\n\nSalt House has a beautiful space, and some of the food is done well, but slow service and inconsistent performance mean I probably won't be back any time soon.", "author": "David W."}

I sent my steak back politely indicating that it was just not good and told the waiter that i did not want it (I had to run for another appointment) but would just settle the check. This is when the hostess came up with the steak redone in a to go box and asked me if i would like to take it to go. I said no. I was pretty done at that point. The hostess then went ahead and comped the food AND the drink. This was done without me asking or even suggesting the same.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-19", "description": "Overall, Salt House is a great restaurant. The place is well-designed (albeit a bit tight) and the service is phenomenal. The food has its ups and downs, but when it's good, it's DAMN good.\n\nThere's something about the way Salt House is designed that makes you feel comfortable -- it's a fancy restaurant, but possesses casual elements reminiscent of a local gastropub like Monk's Kettle or a brewery like 21st Amendment. Feels very akin to one of my favorite restaurants in the city: NOPA. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed with older, business-casual patrons -- loud, lively, and bustling with energy.\n\nOn to what really matters: the food. Our table of 4 decided to share 5 appetizers and 1 main entree, which was the perfect amount of food and gave us an opportunity to try a lot of different items on the menu. For the appetizers, we ordered the Poutine (gravy fries), Crispy Shrimp, Yellowtail Tartare, Asparagus w/ Pork Belly, and the Foie Gras plate. \n\nThe Poutine was good -- very nice touch with short rib gravy (with little chunks of short rib), but it definitely could have been a bit less salty. Taking the restaurant's name into consideration, I assume the extra salt is probably on purpose. \n\nThe crispy shrimp wasn't very good at all. To be completely honest, the fried shrimp (4 small pieces for $14) tastes exactly like the ones that you get from Panda Express or some hole-in-the-wall Chinese fast food restaurant. The green bean salad they provide in the middle is good, but not enough to justify the exorbitantly-overpriced dish.\n\nThe yellowtail tartare wasn't very good either. The chunks of yellowtail weren't very fresh and it was mixed in with too many other fruits and chunks of celery that completely overpowered the fish. Stay away from this one.\n\nThe asparagus w/ pork belly was awesome. The aspargus is perfectly grilled and the pork belly was nice and tender.\n\nThe foie gras was definitely the best dish of the night. Two types of foie gras: cured pate style and seared style. The cured foie gras was incredible -- silky, creamy, and packed in so much of that foie gras flavor. It goes well with the jelly, but don't put too much jelly in the bite, because you don't want it to overpower the foie gras. The seared foie gras was good, but not great. The seared duck salad that comes in the middle of the dish was awesome.\n\nWe also ordered a plate of the braised short rib, which was really tender and nicely cooked.  The strawberry tart for dessert was a great finish to the night, with fresh strawberries and a delicious balsamic glaze.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Salt House -- great  food, nice ambiance, delicious house wines (get the house cabernet), and attentive servers. Stick to the good dishes and you'll have a sweet night out.", "author": "Roy C."}

I ordered the beehive drink but with vodka instead of tequila, it was ok. For my second drink I ordered the pomaretto which was really good! We asked for the bread that is brought to the table to be warmed up but the bus boy completely ignored us and the waitress said she would but came back with cold bread again. Whatever, that's fine. On to dinner now. I wanted to order the salmon but they were out unfortunately. So instead I ordered the sole which wasn't to my liking at all. There was no mention of it being breaded on the menu and it really lacked flavor. I tried my friend's NY steak and the meat wasn't tender at all. My other friend ordered the chicken plate and once she got it we realized there was pork on it which she can't eat because of her own dietary restrictions. She told one of the waiters and he made her feel horrible for mentioning it and essentially saying that she was at fault for not mentioning it. Umm it's not mentioned on the menu that there's pork anywhere in the dish! I don't eat cheese, eggs, and some other things so am I supposed to mention that every single time I order something? No. Ingredients are listed on the menu as any normal restaurant has it. And if there is a problem, you don't make the customer feel bad about it. They did end up taking it back and throwing in some potato chips for her to munch on while the plate was remade, but the way it was handled was very unprofessional. Overall the place looks nice, but the menu needs to be completely re-analyzed since it's not descriptive and is missing key components to it. Some of the staff also needs to be retrained. Our own waitress was nice, but the bus boys and that one other waiter were horrible.", "author": "Shabnam J."}

Over the years, we've eaten here about a dozen times, the last time being about a year or so ago.  We've always had fond memories of the food we've had here.  Tonight, however, will not be one of those times.\n\nMy partner and I came here looking for small bites tonight and ordered four appetizers between us.  We ordered the Poutine, Kampachi Crudo, Heirloom Chicories and Sea Snails & Frog Legs.  Of the 4 dishes, the one that I think is still on par with what I expected from them is the Frog Legs.  It has chewy and tender consistencies and the sauce was outstanding.  The Poutine was good enough but more like a diner food item and maybe should have been on the separate menu containing the choices of burgers.  The Kampachi fish has something that tasted like soft bones in the middle of the slices that was not pleasant when you bite into them.  Perhaps whoever was cutting the fish for this dish should spend some time with a sushi chef for at least a few hours.  The Chicory salad, at $16, mainly consisted of frisees and radicchios.  But Adam, our waiter, immediately offered to take the dish back when we complained and we chose to replace it with the beet salad, a salad that was truer to the menu description.  \n\nSo, good service, beautiful restaurant but disappointing dishes.  i'll be back, but not too soon...", "author": "Yvette F."}

Once again, I'll give the beet salad a 10 any day and their wine list is delish. Did I mention we were able to get a table super easy at around 10 p.m. on a Sunday? The Euros I was with seemed to dig on it and the waiter did a decent job of translating my slurred speech. What a sweetheart. \n\nAt the end of the day, the oysters were a huge hit and sharing a bunch of little things that were all equally tasty was entirely satisfying. Plus two bottles of wine for three. I imagine we were a delightful bunch. Salt House ain't cheap, but they don't care if you are. And they're open late.

To the incredibly accomodating, warm and friendly service.  Then the food, it's presentation and intermingling of textures and tastes were divine!\n\nThis was a B-day dinner for a good friend and now colleage in the dog industry.  We arrived 45 mins early for our reservation to celebrate here after several recomendations.  We were seated immediately, no problem or fuss.  Just a warm welcome from our server and some wonderful crusty bread.\n\nWe started w/the warm truffle honey nuts and shared 3 salads, the crispy shrimp, winter and smoked trout salads.  Those nuts were the best snack I'm sure I've ever had!  The warmth of the nuts, sweetness of the honey and earthiness of the truffles were amazing.  The salads were a wonderful exploration of protein, greens, sweet, savory and sour and so large we were almost full before our entrees arrived.\n\nI had the Fulton Valley Chicken.  Oh heavenly Cock a Doodle Doo!  Perfectly moist with thin crispy skin, sat on a bed of soft Chestnuts, Spaetzle, more chunks of delicious chicken, bacon and baby broccolini.  I think this may have taken the place of any Thanksgiving Feast I have had and I ate until I thought I would burst!  Unfortunately I was staying in a hotel so couldn't take the rest home thus reluctantly had them take away what I couldn't finish.   \n\nAlthough my dinner mates certainly enjoyed their choices, a beautifully prepared and melt in your mouth New York Steak and a delicate lemon Sole, I believe my dinner was supreme and one I won't forget!

The bar was packed full of beautiful people when I arrived, but thankfully they had reserved a table up in the belltower for us and the other hunchbacks.\n\nThe specialty cocktails were pretty good, and it's nice to see so many high-end drinks made of stuff I have in my bar back home.  We split the poutine as an appetizer and it didn't disappoint.  (How can you be disappointed by french fries, shortrib gravy, and cheese?  I'll tell you how: you can't.  That particular act won the Congressional Medal of Impossible about 15 years ago.)  Wifey and I also split an autumn salad (I was expecting dead leaves and brown grass, but apparently it's fresh fruit, blue cheese, and dandelions, none of which says \"autumn\" to me, but then I don't write menus for a living), which was excellent.  I always appreciate it when my salads contain a high blue cheese factor, because I want to make sure the salad doesn't accidentally improve my health.\n\nI had the cassoulet, because I often have cassoulets when they are offered to me.  Same thing with Altoids and bundles of unmarked, nonconsecutively-numbered bills.  Cassoulets are the official food of French rednecks, and I am the official Most Likely to Work for a French Company redneck from my high school class, so it's a natural fit.

Now, if only I could dissuade her from ordering it gently mooing (for those of you who do this, please be aware that, back when it actually WAS gently mooing, it looked a LOT different).\n\nI would give this place 5 stars but for the extremely lack-luster service.

The waitress did come out and provide a 12 minute ETA at one point, but this was just a long delay especially considering that my wife's second course was just a cold trout salad. \nThe smoked trout salad was quite lackluster. Not very trouty or smokey. Not much flavor. Disappointing. I ordered the Atlantic Cod with squid and fingerling potatoes. This dish was very well done. Fish was perfectly done and the accompanying items were quite tasty.\n\nOverall, the service was pretty good, some of the food was quite good, but 2 dishes were pretty bad.

Salt House has all the charm of a 20th floor NY loft - exposed brick, narrow floor to ceiling windows, rustic wood plank floors and furniture and great, GREAT lighting fixtures. With the stylistic flair of a five-star restaurant + a rustic ocean-side cannery the decor immediately captured my senses and imagination.\n\nDespite arriving 45 min. early for a reservation we were seated immediately (by a devastatingly handsome host with an alarmingly sexy accent). Our server was patient, pleasant and helpful - even when I made the annoying request of trying to fix an air vent that was blowing freezing cold air over us. And oh the food.... the food. Outstanding.\n\nI had to admit when I glanced at the menu online I wasn't positive I was going to love the food because I wasn't in the mood for fish or chicken - at it was that or steak. So, I ended up having the steak with a glass of Italian Pinot Noir and man oh man was I glad. Every bite was impeccable - salty and crusty - juicy sweet and rich. We also shared a few salads to start - the crunchy shrimp + green bean was my favorite - but the trout and winter salads were close seconds. Each bite was a pairing of unlikely but decadent ingredients that complimented each other perfectly. Even the butter served with the warm crusty bread was creamy and tasted unfathomably fresh. \n\nIf I had to do it again the only thing I would do differently would be to save room for dessert.

A bustling vibe, beautiful clientele, and a forward thinking menu, Salt House is a mid week gold mine.\n\nWe came out Thursday evening, on what turned out to be a gorgeous warm October night. As we strolled in, we were greeted with the warm smile of the hostess and promptly seated with our reservation.\n\nI enjoy being surrounded by activity and still be able to maintain my personal conversation bubble. The ambiance of life brings out the character of this place, and the brick walls charm me like they always do.\n\nWe started out with a tasting of 3 types of Oysters. The Fanny Bay, Miyagi and Kumamoto. All were delicious, fresh, and when topped with the 2 table garnishes, eased you right into your seat. Washed down with a cold beer, and I was ready for round 2.\n\nShe engaged with the Monkfish as I dove into my Petrale Sole. Both were phenomenal.\n\nThe Petrale came on a meticulous bed of chick peas and other vegetables in a delightful curry sauce which truly made you think. The golden outside crisp of the fish played wonderfully with the soft interior and added texture to this dish.\n\nHer Monkfish was equally satisfying, with a delicate touch. The sauce wasn't too rich, but played nice with the origin of the fish, and allowed you to taste, rather than deliver thought.\n\nSalt House is a great Chapter 2 for these brothers, and they once again drove to the heart of what people crave. Authentic venue with current elements, a stimulating vibe with manicured views, and a menu with genuine thought to your core.\n\nI will have to say, I think Town Hall is better, but as always, the little sister has to try a bit harder to impress.", "author": "Mike K."}

If I were rating solely on food I'd give it 4* easily. But the terrible kitchen drops my overall rating to 2*.\n\nCame here with 3 other coworkers expecting a reasonably timed dinner...boy were we wrong. It took us over 2 hours just to have appetizers and entrees. I've had 4 course meals at a Thomas Keller restaurant in much less time than that, and each of those courses were perfectly spaced.\n\nTook the waiter forever to take our order and bring us drinks (nothing complicated, just beer and wine). Appetizers took a good 30+ minutes to come out...how the F do roasted nuts take that freaking long? We figured a \"snack,\" as denoted on their menu, would come out ASAP followed by the rest of the appetizers. \n\nThe poutine was delicious. Normally the concept of poutine has always grossed me out but I was willing to give it an upscale version with shortrib gravy and white cheddar a shot. I felt that the flavor of the gravy was lacking somewhat but at the same time wasn't quite sure what could have made it better. We also got Oysters, the scallops, and crispy shrimp -- all of which my team enjoyed\n\nEntrees took freaking forever as well -- a good 40 minutes after the appetizers came out. We had to ask twice where our 2nd round of beers were as well (15 minutes to get those). Our waiter was infallibly polite but incredibly hard to find; he'd pull these vanishing acts for 10-15mins at a time. \n\nI had the yellowfin tuna entree and it was very tasty. Lightly seared served with a garlic puree and asparagus. The seasoning along the edges was delicious and presentation was meticulous. The rest of my team got the chicken and the sole and they all thought their items were awesome (their words, not mine). \n\nOverall the food was delicious but the service was terrible. They really need to get their kitchen in order (seems to be a theme among other reviews here) because there really isn't anything that needs to take that freaking long to cook. Also, prices were on the higher end...definitely don't say no if the expense account is treating you to dinner but I'd hesitate to come back with my own $\n\nDon't plan on coming here unless you have a lot of time to kill.

Everything I tried was amazing. The little sweet/salty/honey nuts they serve are like nothing I've ever tried. For appetizers, we ordered poutine (my first poutine - where have you been all my life, my Canadian love??) and a pretty standard mixed lettuce salad. My monkfish with butternut squash and short rib sauce was delectable. I only wish they had provided more than a small smear of the squash puree...I could have eaten a whole bowl. The most fun dish of the night was the pink peppercorn cheesecake. It comes with some explosive passion fruit ice cream that transported me to some hot tropical location that features someone fanning me with palm leaves. It also features a big chunk of white chocolate integrated with...wait for it....POP ROCKS. Ok, I'm not sure if they're the real pop rocks, but they definitely feel like it in your mouth. White chocolate and a magical fizz? I'm in heaven. The group also loved the brownie sundae. We also tried the carrot cake, which had a great flavor but was a bit dry, and a very aromatic panna cotta that was a bit overwhelming for some people, though I really liked it in small amounts. \n\nAll of the above items contributed to my current state, immobilized on my bed and feeling like I couldn't imagine eating another meal...ever.

While the soup was tasty, I was not super impressed with it.  I actually thought it was better than the main dish I had, however, once I was finished.  The Ciopinno was traditional with the seafood, but they stuffed the calamari with chorizo and had pieces of chorizo in the soup as well.  It was very over-powering and I felt that the chorizo took over and the flavor did not pan out well.  By the time I was done, the chorizo had over-powered everything and left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nWould I go back?

I have never been to a nice restaurant where they do not offer to refill your iced tea!  Seriously, my glass sat empty halfway through my meal and I just drank water.\n\nThe ambiance was nice.

The Salt House exceeded my expectations in both categories. The food was uniquely paired with vegetables and sauces/broth. The poached egg was surprisingly good. From the moment we walked in I felt welcomed and relaxed. Our server, Daniel made the dining experince everything one hopes for when looking for a \"nice dinner\". He was educated on the wine and food being offered which allowed us to make excellent choices. To top off the perfect service he went out to the street and hailed us a cab!

I love the old school light bulbs hanging over the bar, the giant mirror (which I wanted to pocket and take home), and the farm table style bar table. \n\nThe staff was super friendly from the moment we entered. I really appreciated their personalities, and as we waited at the bar and I observed the staff interaction, I was kind of taken back because they all seemed happy and seemed to get along well. Now I have a great respect for all the people who work during the holidays, especially in customer service oriented businesses. However, the Salt House people seemed exceptionally happy and in good spirits despite the fact that they were working on Christmas Eve, and happy servers really makes a difference in my dining experience. \n\nAnyhow, after we were escorted upstairs to our table we were helped by our kind waitress. The only minor negative part of our dinner that night was that the menus were late to arrive to our table. Our waitress thought that we already had received them, but as soon as she noticed she was apologetic and even made a light but appropriate joke about it... very suave. \n\nWe ordered some apps which included the foie gras, the fries covered in beef stew (?) and the shrimp & green beans. All were very yummy. We also ordered the butternut squash soup and the winter greens salad (I believe this is what it was called... the one with the yummy persimmons). I loved, loved, loved my salad. The food quality was impressive and presentation was tasteful.\n\nWe brought a couple bottles of red wine, and they made sure to bring the right glasses and to keep our bottles at a service table, so that it did not crowd our dining space. Little things that you'd expect at a nice restaurant, but it's nice when a restaurant actually gets it all right.\n\nI ordered the monkfish, my husband had the cod, a couple people had the \"chipper chicken\" (not really called this), another the cassoulet, another the polenta, and someone had the dish with the bone marrow (don't smell that one too closely!). Anyhow, everyone was happy with their dishes. I cleared my plate... the monkfish was yummy and I liked how the outside had the slightest crisp texture to it. \n\nOh! The bread, I forgot to mention the bread. It comes out in a cute little twist roll and was delish. Enjoyed that for sure. \n\nOk, so moving on to dessert. I think I was the only one who ordered dessert because Carrot Cake was on the menu... HOLY yummy carrot goodness. It was so yummy, beautiful presentation and probably the smoothest carrot cake I have ever had. Taste of glorious carrot heaven. Even my husband who is not a fan of carrot cake admitted that he enjoyed it. I almost want to go back just to eat a meal and have an excuse to enjoy the carrot cake. The serve it with a little pistachio ice cream which is a nice touch too.\n\nLast technical detail... my mother in law made the reservation, and told us that reservations were required for parties of 5 or more. \n\nDefinitely looking forward to going back.", "author": "Shannel G."}

Sadly, as a vegetarian I had to pass.  \n\nWe tried the Butternut Squash Soup, the Tagliatelle, the Polenta and the Salmon.  As well as some cocktails and wine.  Everything was top notch and amazing.  I was surprised at how well the vegetables came out in my Polenta dish and honestly felt like they were the central piece of it.  Even my partner said that his veggies were almost better than his fish.\n\nI won't even touch upon how amazing the Chevre Cheesecake was.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the place is great, although a bit crowded near the bar.  The crowding also contributed to it being a lot noisier than I would have liked considering we were attempting to have a conversation.

Anyways, back to the food. I have had dreams about their poutine so that is a staple in my order every time. The entrees are a mixed bag. I had a soggy \"BLT\" one time. The bread was way too oily and soggy by the time the sandwich made it in front of me. It definitely overpowered the delicious shrimp and crab salad. Another time, I had their lamb goulash. I was pining for some goulash from my days in Eastern Europe and this goulash did not disappoint. Though on the drier side (I like my goulash more stew-y), it was really delicious and filling.\n\nI have to point out that the service has been great every time I have gone, but there is one guys who is bussing all the tables who is evidently always angry or just sloppy.

Arrived about 6ish on a weeknight without reservations (that's how I roll) and was easily seated as it were mostly happy hour folk around this time.  By the time we finished dinner (7:30) the place was packed, that it always amazes me how the staff can maneuver so well in such tight confines.  Bravo to them.\n\nStarted with the Smoked Trout Salad (which they graciously split, w/o us even asking).  Quite good with sweet baby beets, citrus segments, shards of smoked trout, mixt greens and some horseradish cream.  The interplay of sweet, salty, tart and bold just worked.  Trout a little on the salty side but we were at the \"Salt House\" , right?.  Also ordered the Baked Oysters with bacon, spinach and buttery bread crumbs and this was quite the treat.  I thought for a moment that with all those toppings the flavor of the oysters might get lost, but not the case.  After tasting all the toppings, the sweet/briny flavor of the oyster comes through as it were plump and just barely cooked through.  The bacon with the oyster turned it a little on the salty side, but we were at the \"Salt House\", right?.\n\nWe order the Halibut and the Petrale Sole for entrees.  Both fishes were nice portions of perfectly pan roasted goodness.  Nice light brown, crisp exterior with moist, succulent yet delicate interior.  Props to the skillz in the open kitchen.  The veg under my halibut were english peas and carrots with bacon, guess what?  Yup a little on the salty side, but for crying out loud, I once reminded myself that I was at the \"Salt House\", again my bad.\n\nOur Sauvignon Blanc from New York state was a good match as it were citrus-y, green apple-y, and minerally.

That's right, I'm talking about gravy fries. There were so many good things about Salt House, but I will start with the gravy fries ... \n\nGravy Fries: Yes, they were awesome. Every single one of them. Technically called the Poutine, they were fries, with short rib gravy, and cheddar cheese on top. Hands down, the best appetizer I've ever had at any restaurant ever. \n\nEntree: I had the salmon and was very pleased. The portions were a little on the small side, but when you have gravy fries as an appetizer, there's no reason to complain. \n\nService and Ambiance: Both were very excellent. Most excellent, if you will. The restaurant is sleek and modern and our server was cheery and helpful. We were seated on the top level, which only takes up about half the floor space of the bottom portion. That means you can literally look down on people and make fun of them - always super fun. \n\nThe only thing you should be warned about is the price.

We didn't have a rezzie but the pretty tattooed hostess grabbed us a prime table on the mezzanine level looking over the busy restaurant.  We ordered the flight of Spanish wines to share, which consisted of a rose, a lighter red, and a dark, hearty red.  Great selections!\n\nWe gorged on crusty bread served wrapped in brown paper with some lovely soft sweet butter.  Our tasty SF tapwater came in a old-fashioned glass milk bottle emblazoned with what I am presuming is the the Salt House crest, kind of bad-ass with its little skull!  We also had an order of the olives, marinated in orange, mint, and chili.  I wasn't a huge fan of these (I am boring and prefer plain, vinegary olives) but my partner is an olive connoisseur and liked them a lot.\n\nFor an appetizer, we shared the baked oysters, served in their own little shells with bacon, leeks, spinach, and breadcrumbs.  Very yum!  I can never finish restaurant meals on my own so we split an entree of the New York steak, with shallots and black olive crushed potatoes.\n\nI need to give major props to our server and kitchen here - we would have been totally fine sharing off the same plate but they actually made us up two lovely half plates, both of which were just gorgeous and totally above and beyond!  I feel like so many restaurants seem annoyed by requests to share meals, even when most restaurant portion sizes are way too huge for just one person to eat, so this was really appreciated.  \n\nSteak was perfectly done, tender and delicious, and the olive smashed potatoes were shockingly tasty.  I was a little iffy on these after reading the description, but they were really perfect, something I never thought would work so well, but they totally did!\n\nAfter dinner, we drooled over the dessert menu, which had several delectable looking options, but sadly were way too stuffed to attempt!", "author": "Jaimie M."}

I just had a very nice and fresh lunch there. We started off with some lovely cured Mediterranean olives. I adore olives. They're such a wonderful fatty rich food for us veggie peeps. They also had other veggie snackies (nuts and pickled veggies). Then, we enjoyed some delicious bread. It was the kind with the little points on it that I fondly remember from France! Extra points in my book for pointed bread! When I told the server I didn't eat dairy or meat, he got it right away. He served me the minestrone sans pesto and a big green salad with red wine vinaigrette. I left feeling stuffed and satisfied. For drinks, the mint lemonade was very refreshing and a nice touch to the menu. \n\nI would love to see a veggie main at a place like this. I spotted green beans and lentils on the sides of some of the meaty dishes. It would be so easy to take some of those and some of the grains from underneath the chunks of meat and create a beautiful veggie dish. If only all these bougie restos with their fresh seasonal foods would just add one dish made of these sides to their menus, it would be revolutionary for SF cuisine. Plenty of SFers would probably eat a vegan lunch given the opportunity to have an elegant plate at their favorite trendy restaurant, and there is nothing more green than giving up meat in a few meals a week (or uh, yunno, all of them.) Plus, and most importantly, I would be a seriously happy (and probably broke, but worth it) little vegan camper.", "author": "Jeani H."}

Perhaps because I had a wonderful experience at sister restaurant Anchor & Hope and heard many pleasant reviews of Townhall.\n\nThe vibe, feel definitely is comparable to both... rustic fare with simple American cuisine.  But the food fell way short.  \n\nThe Poutine, french fries with gravy and cheddar, was spotted on many tables.  Perhaps I'm not a being a fair critic here, because I am not a french fry kind of gal, but these were just ok.  I do love that sort of texture of crunchy with gravy, but the fries were a bit run of the mill.  Gravy and cheddar I'd usually hoot and holler about, but I couldn't get pass the saltiness of the dish. \n\nThe seared scallops and deep fried shrimp appetizers were slightly more satisfying.  Whoever is seasoning the dishes perhaps has an affection towards Emeril.  'Bamming' the salt generously did not have this audience member hootin' and clapping.\n\nI found all the dishes to be fair... the ingredients were very fresh indeed, but the flavors were all very regular, except for anything with corn because they knew to pick the sweetest of the bunch.  My sole was nicely seared, but the accompanying chickpeas and cherry tomatoes did not add any real moistness to the crispy filet.   Chorizo was devoid of any spiciness.\n\nTwo of my companies fowl dishes (roast chicken and duck) had a substaintial portion, but wasn't anything to cluck about.  \n\nService and ambiance were a hit definitely.

A chilled asparagus soup, with some asparagus tempura and creme fraiche. I don't really like asparagus to begin with but I  found it fine and everyone else at the table lapped it up.\n\nOn to the apps! \n\nThe poutine (of course): I don't think I'll ever be able to come to Salt House without ordering the poutine.

It was good this time, but I actually found it a bit salty this time. This is me just nit-picking, not to say it wasn't great, I just thought maybe a little heavy handed on the salt. The beans and ham complimented it perfectly.\n\nYellow Tail: I forget exactly what it was served with, maybe a soy bean and potato puree, or something similar. But it was cut perfectly, and seared beautifully. It was delicious.\n\nDuck Confit: Oh, this was probably my favorite app. It was a rillet confited. Tender and juicy, seasoned well. Amazing. \n\nThe scallops: Ok, these were amazing too. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. So good.\n\nEntrees: \n\nBetween the table, we got the short ribs, white polenta, and I got the chicken.\n\nHonestly, by this time I was already so full, it was hard for me to really appreciate anything, but I've had the short ribs and chicken before. I know they change the menu daily, but they also use similar proteins and change the other stuff seasonally. The chicken was actually a touch dryer than last time, but was still really good. Served with a delicious bacon, potato and leek puree. mmmmmmm. short ribs were excellent as always.\n\nWe were all so full by dessert time, we probably would have just order 1 or 2 for the table. Thankfully we didn't have to. They sent us out the three options I'm sure we would've picked anyway. The panna cotta, the chocolate peanut butter cake and one other thing. All I have to say is the cake was out of this world. Some excellent cups of coffee later and we were done. And all so pleased with an amazing experience.\n\nEverything from top to bottom was great. Our server, Jessie, was superb. She was attentive without being overbearing, and very pleasant. We were helped by everyone from the host to the managers, and the team seems to work very well together.

The wait wasn't that long (surprising for a Friday night) and the service at our table was top-notch.  Our server provided an excellent recommendation for the second bottle.\n\nThe food was amazing.

We ordered the tuna tartare and pork belly salad for starters. The tuna was diced up with a lot of other stuff, so it took away the tuna taste, which I didn't like. The pork belly was crisp and just ok. \n\nAs for entrees, we had lamb and NY steak. I didn't care for the meat too much, it was very chewy to me. I'm usually a prime rib fan so maybe that coulda been it. The corn and sauce it came with was delish though. There was a small piece of short rib that came with the steak, it was alright. Nothing impressive. My friend didn't care too much for her lamb. It came with something that looked and tasted like stuffing, so it was probably that. Weird combo, imo.\n\nI had a very nice cup of cappucino and my friend ordered coffee, which was very weak.

We had a large table where we could talk and relax. The server was very patient with our questions, and our orders came out as requested. Everything was done with care - from our cocktails to our desserts. I had pork loin with brussel sprouts cooked with ham hock (so, essentially pork on pork action), and it was fantastic, with a crispy crust on the outside, and juicy in the center.

It was like sipping on a fresh spring pea.  What a fantastic way to start a meal.  My main course was the sole.  It was cooked to perfection, lightly crisp on the outter edges, tender and moist in the center.  There was a light broth, artichoke hearts, raddish, favas, arugula, and carrot.  It was a perfect combination.  Everything was extremely fresh, nothing was overpowering.  It had to be one of the best fish dishes I've had, period.\n\nService was on point.

Although the front door was of the super generic type that you'd expect to walk through if you were getting your taxes done or going to a bail bondsman, once inside the atmosphere is warm and stylish. Exposed brick and antiqued iron beams were offset by modern and soaring light fixtures and a bright clean open kitchen.\n\n\"So good. SO good. So GOOD!\" The wife and I must have said that like twenty times over the course of our meal at Salt House so, yeah, let's just get that out of the way. The food is delicious. The food is billed as \"New American\" which loosely translated means \"We can do whatever the fuck we want and use any ingredients we want so don't try to  label us, asshole.\" Like I said, it's a loose translation. I'm a chef of New American cuisine myself so, me and Salt House, we get each other.\n\nThe appetizers were amazing and there are lots of options although there was only one salad. Not that it matters when there's braised pork belly and Ahi tuna on the menu. One could easily make a meal of the appetizers alone. There's also a raw bar for those of you trying to get laid.\n\nEntrees had a tough act to follow but they did not disappoint. Everything was nicely executed, beautifully seasoned with the flavors being bold and clean.\n\nThe service was great. Professional, relaxed and knowledgeable. And these dudes were on their SHIT. When my wife got up to use the bathroom and dropped her napkin, by the time she had stood up from picking it up there was already someone there with a new napkin. When the little old lady who was getting schnockered next to us sent her wine glass crashing to the floor there was someone there to clean it up almost before it hit the ground. The busboy was awesome as well. If I turned my head to cough (and for a quick hernia test) my water would be refilled, silver set and plates taken away. Seriously, he would be on the busboy All-Star team, you know, if there was that kind of thing.\n\nOverall, a great experience and I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant.\n\nAs a side note, for those of you keeping track of my Weight Watchers progress, just let me tell you I probably consumed my entire day's points total before my second glass of wine.

My BF had never been, so I was really excited to introduce him to the beautiful brick room with the crazy Quixote-esqe mural... and to one of the most amazing foie gras presentations EVER! \n\nWe arrived a little early and opted to wait at the candle lit bar. Salt House offers house-blend wines in the most adorable little bottles in small, Medium, and LARGE sizes (small = 6 oz.), and while I'm generally a little leery of \"house wine\", I opted for the Pinot Gris / Chardonnay / Sauvignon Blanc blend, which was surprisingly really good! \n\n...as I'm writing I'm feeling pangs of regret for not slipping that cute little jug of wine into my cute little purse! But I digress.\n\nSo far, everything about Salt House is lovely. As it was a Sunday, the bar was quiet, the tables, full (with the exception of a 4-top that I  assumed was ours), and my BF is soaking up the exposed-brick and steel-beamed ambiance. But, glancing at the time, where, oh, where are our guests? Good question.\n\nOK, so long story short, we were stood up! Yes, stood up! (Euge *cough* drunk in the East Bay *cough*cough*)  : \\ \n\nBut stuff happens, and all's well that ends well... we stayed and made a date out of it.\n\nWe opted to share some small plates and one entree, with the possibility of dessert to finish. Of course we had the foie gras (served 2-ways -- \"cured\", terrine-style, & sauteed perfectly with huckleberries ... or were they lingonberries?) which was amazing! I could have made a meal of it with a salad. But I didn't.\n\nNext, we shared the crispy shrimp with green beans, almonds & Serrano ham. Wonderful! Crisp green beans & almonds, sweet, crunchy shrimp, smoky Spanish ham!  We also shared the mixed greens with baby chiogga beets, apples & Crater Lake blue cheese. I know, I know, typical. But I'm still a sucker for the classic sweet beet - pungent cheese combo!\n\nFor the entree, my BF opted for the wild striped bass. Sadly, by the time it arrived I was so stuffed on foie gras and shrimp and stuff that I was only able to enjoy a small taste... a taste that was not at all disappointing! Everything was wonderful. \n\nSalt House offers a well-balanced wine list, a full bar with interesting cocktails, and what looked to be yummy dessert options (hello apple turnover thingy with butterscotch!!). Just be sure to bring a hearty appetite... and the more guests the merrier so you don't gorge yourself on foie gras like I did.\n\nBut MAN, was it worth it.", "author": "Tiffinie T."}

When you check out their website the first thing you are greeted with is this: \"From the same jackasses that brought you Town Hall...\" (FYI: Town Hall is still one of my favorite spots in the city.) The water is served in an over sized mason jar painted with a coat of arms bearing a skull on it. The back of the restaurant has a Ralph Steadman-esque mural. Modern industrial design throughout the restaurant... All completely unpretentious.\n\nOf course the setting really doesn't matter if the food sucked. Thankfully this isn't the case. It was phenomenal in fact. We started off with the Suckling Pig. Prepared perfectly and disappeared within seconds. For dinner my wife had the halibut served over pesto-flavored beans.

First off, it's from the jackasses (their term, not mine!) who brought us Town Hall, so you know you can expect a casual and boisterous elegance. You know the menu will offer interesting takes on American classics. And you know the staff are going to be enthused and cool, but certainly professional. \n\nBut still, when I went in this Friday night, I was thoroughly impressed and surprised. Salt House is a winner on so many levels, even though the space is not even fiNished (the mezzanine level has yet to be built, stairs and all!). \n\nAs mentioned above, the restaurant/bar has a very casual and familiar feeling - it's the sort of place where you can meet new friends or certainly run into old ones, like I did. \n\nWhile waiting for our table, I ran into the former owner of Tallula, who is now behind the bar at Salt House. Without getting into how much I miss Tallula, let me just say that having Harveen over at Salt House is just another indication that this place is going to be a fixture for anyone who gives a damn about good food and good times.\n\nOk, so yeah, I ran into some people I know. Get to the point, right, which is the food. Well in this department, Salt House does not disappoint. The menu is relatively small and simple, but I still had trouble deciding, since everything sounded good. The oysters (miyagis, fanny bays) were a fun and fresh way to get things going, so get a few to split and tease your appetites.\n\nIn terms of starters, the crispy shrimp was definitely a standout, but their are also sides like the mixed nuts with honey and salt that seem like they should be at every table.\n\nI went with the New York Strip for my entree, which was perfectly served medium rare, just the way I like it. I'm holding out on giving this place my full seal of approval until I try a couple of more dishes, plus I was somehow not completely happy with the chocolate bundt cake and apple galette we ended with.

By BOTH guys who were supposed to be on the date.\n\nNow those of you that know me understand that I'm flattered by anyone and anything (don't ask) that is attracted to me so that part didn't bother me.  In fact, the first guy looked a little bummed when I said I wasn't who he was looking for.  Score.\n\nIcing on the cake is when the host then walked over to us and said, \"I see your date has arrived, are you ready?\"\n\nSo when Grace did arrive, I looked back and gave the host a little nod like \"that's right dude...eye candy....FEMALE eye candy.\"\n\nNow having said that I am interested in women, I might have to switch teams to hang out with the chef at Salt House.  \n\nAny man that deep fries eggs, makes fois gras that melts faster than butter and puts that much cheese on a pile of fries is marriage material.  \n\nI am rolling with 4 stars on this one.  The dessert messed with my head a little.  Both Grace and I saw eye to eye on the fact that the tartness of the cranberries should have been left out.\n\nThe place is cool for sure and the staff is VERY helpful.  Running next door to get Tabasco.  Who does that?\n\nI would attempt to classify this as a place that serves casual comfort food while you are going there to see and be seen.  \n\nAnd yeah, there goes my bank account.

Both times that I've been here, a heavy hand of salt must have been used to prepare my food.  First, it was the crispy shrimp green bean salad I had on one occasion.  Then, it was my corn soup on another.\n\nWhen Salt House first opened, I was dying to eat here solely for one thing: poutine fries.  I love LOVE LOVE poutine fries!  I used to visit Toronto regularly and was always on a mission to find the best poutine fries (to date, my favorite ones hail from the Costco in Scarborough!!).  Who doesn't love fries, cheese curds and gravy?  Okay, maybe just me.  Well, Salt House definitely makes a much classier version (perfectly cut fries, sparse shredded cheddar cheese, and a separate gravy dish to dip your fries in).  It was pretty good, but I think I prefer the less healthier and less classier version of gravy-drenched cheese fries.\n\nI've only been here for lunch and the food has been okay.  Nothing mind-blowing.  I have a feeling dinner is probably the best meal for dining at Salt House, so I'll give it another try one day.  I really like the decor though.  The brick walls, the cool upper level seating, and the mason jars used as water glasses.  Service is a hit or miss.  The other day, I asked for simple syrup for my iced tea.

Today it was just me and I showed up pretty late and once seated the hostess reminded me that I had about five minutes to order !\nHey better late than never so I took a strong hard look at the menu and got down to business.\n\nSo at this point the server hadn't come around for a few minutes and I was worried about being able to eat today however when the server arrived she made me feel completely unrushed for the rest of the afternoon. Cynthia the angel !\n\nWhen checking out the menu I have to admit they keep it pretty dry as far as describing the dishes in all their glory so Cynthia did a great job in letting me know about the dishes I would like because today my quest was for comfort food.\n\nMy final choices were the Roasted Beets $12 and a Braised Lamb Shank Sheperds Pie $17 along with a Milos(house) blend white wine 12 oz for $12.\n\nWhile waiting I watched a few other dishes arrive around me such as the Poutine $11 which they are famous for. All I can say is everyone was mmmm'g up a storm about it! Their Chicken Paillard Cobb Salad almost made me change my order, it's a really smart looking larger salad.\n\nSo here come my Roasted Beets. It was a good sized (medium) salad with the beets underneath the fisee, chopped fennel,asian pears,endive and Pt. Reyes blue cheese in a vinargarette that was heaven. I swear this was the best Beet salad I have ever had. 5 stars\n\nThen came the Braised Lamb Shank Sheperd's Pie. It had a red onion jam/celery root, pickeled radishes description on the menu.\nIMO what I really tasted was... at the bottom with the braised lamb was a terrific reduction of onion with a sweet and zesty savory sauce. Then there were fresh sliced carrots on top of that and then it was topped off with at least an inch and a half of mouth watering mashed potatoes.\nWhen served it was still simmering.\n\nFood...5 stars/ Wine...4 stars\nService ...5 stars, ask for Cynthia she's really lovely \nAmbiance.... 5 stars, I personally like the front of the house.", "author": "Katherine N."}

I confess that it slaked my thirst, but it was also $5... and made me think of how I used to make lemonade from the fruit off the tree in our backyard... and sell it for 5 cents a Dixie cup.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-14", "description": "A couple of things inspired me to yelp Salt House.  1.  A NYT article mentioning a move towards heartier  (read:  fattier) fare and away from ascetic \"California\" cuisine (http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/13glut.html?_r=1&ref=dining&oref=slogin) and 2.  Last night's opening episode of Top Chef where the contestants prepared dishes with lesser-known proteins,  in particular, Sara's presentation of her black chicken (silkie) with the claw sticking out in brazen, primordial form.\n\nSalt House is not food for the meek or light tummied.  It is protein fortified.  It is hearty.  It is brazen.  It is welcome. \n\nThe poutin, for example, with perfectly fried, golden fries, short rib gravy and cheese, is seriously filling and could easily qualify as a meal in itself.  The flavors, however, were not overpowering.  You can taste the freshness of the potato (I kept thinking \"Kennebec, O, Kennebec\") and the cheddar; the short rib flavor is not dominant, however.  The comfort of eating fat + starch + protein is the real draw to this plate.\n\nAfter the heavy poutin, I opted for their lightest entree, seared tuna with wild asparagus, morels and nettle coulis.  I don't remember tasting nettles before. But take the earthy spinachy nettle coulis with the rich morels and 3 huge hunks of tuna and you have a lovely mix of rich and earthy tones, on their \"lightest\" entree.\n\nI also tried the roasted fulton valley chicken with fingerling potatoes and merguez, very tasty with crispy skin; and Amy C.'s sole with red wine braised calamari with fennel, also tasty.  Portions are substantial, and, again as the rich and hearty ingredients bespeak, not for the faint of appetite.\n\nThe desserts were also homey and filling.  We opted for the strawberry trifle with shortbread cookies and the chocolate fondant with cooked cherries and pistachio ice cream.  Both were good.  I loved the thick custard, fresh strawberries and light whipped cream on the trifle; the sponge cake wasn't for me.  But the shortbread cookies hit the spot.  \n\nThey serve the trifle in a preserve jar.  And also in keeping with the unfinished theme of this place, Salt House serves their water from glass jugs stamped with a skull and crossbones and huge hunks of bread on brown paper. \n\nThe decor is intentionally unwrought, but with a modern gloss.  With its exposed walls; restored old hardwood floors; large, unadorned windows with sunlight flooding in; large communal table; and a galley kitchen, I really love the design and feel of this place.\n\nI walked in expecting, \"yet another New American seasonal place.\"  My expectations were not fulfilled.

That said, I was invited to SH to be treated for my birthday.  When someone is treating, you don't ask for a different restaurant.  \n\nSo WOW.  My evening at Salt House was the best dining experience I've had in SF in at least the past two years.  \n\nYes there was a brick wall but the rest of the design is perfect.  Not \"hip\" just plain old great design.  Modern and classic mixed perfectly together to create a cozy atmosphere.  Slight noise but you can hear your mates.  The tables were not crammed together which is super nice.  They thought of all the details down to the seal on the menu.  Nice!\n\nService was impeccable, not snooty, not in our faces, just right - almost intuitive.  No rushing at all.  We gave our first course order of the shellfish plateau, drink, and starters and our server asked if we wanted to wait to order our main courses.  Sure why not!   My mates all ordered a bottle of wine while I ordered my usual \"The 35\" which the bar made to perfection.  Whenever my drink got close to being gone, I would blink and in it's place was a fresh full glass.  Where did it come from?!  \n\nNot sure if this is their thang but our menu for the evening had a seafood emphasis.  We ordered the following:\n\nShellfish Plateau - mussels, clams, oysters (malbec, miyagi, etc. etc.) shrimp ROCKING\n\nWild Ramp Soup - ROCKING\n\nSpring Vegetable Salad - So fresh and special.  All sorts of yummy fresh/crisp perfectly dressed veggies.  Delicate and just the right amount.  ROCKING\n\nTai Snapper Red Wine Braised Calamari and fennel,\nPetrale Sole Fava Beans Bacon Brown Butter Jus, \nShellfish Stew Snap Peas Leeks Orange,\nAlaskan Halibut Sweet Shrimp Artichokes Turnips.\n\nEvery entree was incredible and perfect.  Fancy food without being stuffy.  Just good simple fresh ingredients done right.\n\nDessert was Rhubarb Crisp with Lavendar icecream (OMG), Strawberry Shortcake (whatever you call the thing that has layers. . .oh what is it called), and chocolate bar with peanuts and salted caramel sauce.  I am so in love with this whole salted caramel fascination.  Everything should have salted caramel in it.  Desserts were hot.

Having spent the day walking the Embarcadero and Piers like a tourist we missed the movie we were going to catch and waltzed into Salt House an hour ahead of reservation. Explaining our plight to the hostess, she was more than happy to seat us.\n\nThe large picture windows in the entry and long room gives the place a spacious feel even though it's not a large restaurant. The exposed brick/metal, wood floors, and surreal art provide a unique ambiance. We were greeted with water and crusty bread immediately as we perused the menu. As we perused the menu I noticed the modernization of an array of international comfort foods. Almost every time I see brandade on the menu I usually get it but I was piqued by the fact that they had Poutine, the food every single one of my Canadian friends talk about. So we had to start with that. For the entrees we went with the cassoulet which included white beans,sausage, plus duck confit and the roast chicken with chorizo roasted potatoes. The poutine came with fontina and a short rib gravy, which seemed very gussied up from the cheese curd version I'd been described. It didn't matter however because it was super tasty. Simple dishes shine with the best ingredients and that showed in the poutine. Our entrees were also simple but well crafted. The familiarity of flavors of the comfort foods enhanced by the chefs touches and twists.\n\nWhat made the evening better was the service. Not sure if it's the time we slipped in, the fact that it was Sunday, karma was just on our side or what but it was excellent. Very attentive, always making sure we were enjoying ourselves. I couldn't ask for anything more. The crowd was a bit older than I thought it would be but it was also pretty diverse so I'm not sure i could describe it.\n\nA perfect ending meal to a great day.

I could picture the following scenarios a) passing out somewhere at the MUNI yard standing up these two fine people who raised me or b) showing up completely sauced, knocking over tables, starting fights, and setting fire to the kitchen. You know when it happens in the movies, but is less funny in real life.\n\nThankfully neither a) nor b) occurred. I showed up for dinner with my parents and sister, pleasantly buzzed and thus able to communicate and enjoy my family's conversation and the delicious repaste provided by the folks at Salt House. My starter, the corn chowder, was the hit of the evening. The monkfish with clams and bacon was also very tasty, as was my cheese plate. They have a very good menu, and also will deduct corkage fees if you BYOB, provided you order at least one bottle from them. \n\nUnfortunately, some uninvited guests crashed our party. I believe you may be familiar with the Periplaneta americana, otherwise known as the American cockroach? Yeah, you hate it when they show up too. They never bring anything and they drink all your liquor.

That good!\nThe Crazy, creepy artwork- I was trying to see how many faces there were in that art piece.  I'd say 5!\n\nThe bad:\nTerrible service from the waiter-  the other waiters gave us more service and attention.\nPickled Vegetables- a bit  vinegary\nRoast Chicken- expectations not fulfilled.  It was too lemony and lacking on the serving size\nSeafood Plateu- I only liked the lobster and everything else on the plate was blah!!!  It would be better if the shrimp was chilled and we could select which oysters we wanted.  Not like Zuni's\n\nOverall, the place has potential and they are going through the new restaurant motions.

The hostess was extremely apologetic and checked in with us constantly. The one problem -- not anyone's fault -- is that there really is no waiting area. Since the bar was crowded as well, this created a bit of a crowded bottleneck, which was somewhat of a stressful start to the evening.\n\nOnce we were seated, our friendly waiter, Enrique, furnished us with delicious crusty pan epee and sweet soft butter. I started with the kombucha squash and chestnut soup, which had a few morsels braised rabbit and was finished with a bit of sage oil (I'm pretty sure that's what it was!). Absolutely delicious! It wasn't overly creamy or too rich and heavy, and was somewhat filling.\n\nOur main courses took a while to come out, but our wait was rewarded. For my main course, I ordered another appetizer: the roasted beet salad with smoked salmon and horseradish creme fraiche. This was extremely tasty and the mix of flavors was just perfectly -- they all came together without any one being too overpowering.\n\nI had a bite of my friend's chicken, which was really the winner... I've never had such moist and flavorful white meat before. The chicken comes with chorizo potatoes and is topped with some lightly dressed arugula. My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste of this dish!!\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate pot de creme. It was a little lighter in texture than most, almost mousse-like. It was perfectly bittersweet -- just the right amount of sugar.\n\nI can't wait to return... I'm definitely having the chicken next time! Mmmmmm....", "author": "Jill M."}

But my favorites would be the steak (i love me a ny strip) and the foie gras.  I ordered the cassoulet but there was way too much salt and had too strong of a wine taste.  We all enjoyed the sweetbreads, but I personally thought the bacon around it stole the show.  I've never liked putin, but they do a pretty good job here, provided you also enjoy steak fries, which I'm also not the biggest fan of.  My aunt didn't love her chicken which was super dry, and I thought the monk fish was so-so.\n\nWhatever the hell you do though, stay away from the dessert.  We tried the carrot cake, cranberry financier, apple crisp, and the panna cotta.  And they all sucked.  The first two were dry, bland and oily (not moist).  There's probably a giant sheet cake in the back of their refrigerator that's been prepared a week ahead that they just slice up and put on a plate for you.  The carrot cake literally had a glop of cream cheese on top.  It wasn't even turned into a frosting, it was a legit stool (or quenelle) of cream cheese.  The panna cotta had a good texture but didn't taste like anything, could have used some vanilla (aka flavor), and the apple crisp had only a good crisp, but a mediocre apple filling.  And I mean, it's really hard to screw up an apple crisp.  So SKIP dessert.  Not only are they uninspired and expensive, but they're not even executed well.", "author": "Biqi C."}

So we went around the block found parking rather easily and crossed our fingers since we had no reservations. \n\nIt was filled but no one was waiting to be seated. We were informed that they were booked for the night but that they offer a full menu at the bar, and at a community table behind the bar that had ten or so stools around it and one couple enjoying a meal.

A little industrial with brick walls and girders but it also was warm and comfortable. \n\nWe decided to share three appetizers and one entree. This way we got to try quite a few dishes. The Poutine was the star of the meal to me. I had never seen poutine offered anywhere outside of Quebec before and this version was perfect. The potatoes were fried as perfect as I could think fries could be. With the gravy and cheese it was a true guilty pleasure. A close second was the short ribs which were deliciously tender. The other dishes we ordered (Seared Scallops and Suckling Pig) were interesting enough but not as good as the other two dishes. The banana chocolate tort we had for dessert was above acceptable which was par for the course for our meal. \n\nSince we were sharing, the server had the kitchen split the dishes for us so we each enjoyed our own presentation from the kitchen which was a real nice added touch that we didn't ask for but our server had them do anyway, Thanks bud!\n\nAn enjoyable meal and another place to have tried in the \"City\".

(Cue South Park song here.)  Therefore, I like to be treated very specially by those I love.  Luckily, the husband is also Jewish and has done an excellent job of making me feel amazing on my birthday.  This year we had to go to a wedding on the 24th (yes, it was a Jewish wedding, blah blah) so we arranged an alternate date to go to dinner.  I'd heard some of the hype here and since I loved Town Hall, I thought we could go here for a nice meal.  But I probably should have read the reviews here a tad more carefully because everything that we found wrong with our experience had already been thoroughly documented by other Yelpers. \n\nThe good:  LOVED the decor, was seated promptly, got to have a glass of Schramsberg's 'Mirabelle' Rose which I HIGHLY recommend to all of you bubbly lovers.  (Odd to see it listed under the sparkling section next to the Veuve... discordant much?)  The husband got a huge pour of the Verdejo he sampled by the glass.  The special was a dungeness crab salad that I probably could have eaten 20 of -- lovely and salty with an anchovy and olive dressing.  At that point I was REALLY excited.  That was dashed soon after, though.\n\nThe bad:  after being seated with menus, the waiter did not show up with real information for quite some time.  He seemed agitated when, after asking us if we had questions, the husband actually did ask some questions about the seafood dishes.  When we placed our order, we decided to go with a glass of a white each for our appetizer, and then switch to a Pinot Noir for our entrees.  'Cause you know, that is one of the points of having wine by the glass... so you can change it up.  \n\nWaiter says:  OK with the Pinot, but you may have to remind me 'cause I'll probably forget.  (He was writing everything down, btw.)  \n\nUs:  um... really? \n\nSo a long spell passed between our appetizer and our entrees and at some point before the entrees arrived the waiter looked in on us and asked when we wanted our Pinot.  Husband was not close to being done with his first glass, so I said with our entrees.  Finally the entrees came.  Was definitely surprised at how sparse the plates were... for $26 I expected a little more than 3 scallops resting on a teensy bit of veggies.  Husband had the monkfish accompanied by veal cheeks.  The fish was average, but the veal cheeks were actually amazing and could have been a spectacular dish on their own with the correct saucing and accompaniments.  \n\nOF COURSE our wine and the waiter were nowhere to be seen... and he didn't come by to check on us until well after the husband had finished his meal.  Veal cheeks wait for no one!  We said we'd just like one glass of wine at this point and the waiter just kind of shrugged and said something like, yeah, well, that's why I asked you before when you wanted your wine.  No apology. He walked away and I was just confused... because didn't his asking us imply that the wine would arrive when we wanted it?!  My glass did show up a few minutes later and I enjoyed it very much, thank you.\n\nSo on to dessert.. we selected the \"warm apple galette\" with vanilla bean ice cream.  This, too, took quite some time to arrive and was both not warm and somewhat lacking (IMO) in the apple department.  it also really needed to be cut with a knife... but we only had forks and spoons.  sadness.\n\nIn short, this meal was very disappointing.

All in all, a great experience!\n\nBack when we were trying to make plans for News Years Eve, I logged on to Open Table and picked Salt House simply because it was in very close proximity to the hotel my aunt and uncle were planning to stay at. Well, their reservations at the hotel fell through at the last minute, but we decided to keep our dinner plans and I'm so glad we did! \n\nWe had a few drinks down the street at Roy's beforehand, which was a smart move for me because none of the cocktails at Salt House really piqued my interest. As far as food goes, though, I was really impressed. I would say that, to start, both the poutine and the warm nuts are MUST-HAVES!!! Just do it! The marinated olives, however, were a joke...you could get better olives at the olive bar in any grocery store! \n\nFor my main dish, I got the yellowfin tuna-it was excellent, served seared, with lots of veggies on the side, and it was the perfect portion...I felt like I was eating air! Everyone else got meat dishes...my aunt really liked her short ribs. We each ordered a different dessert, and I was partial to the panna cotta, above anything else...it had a different flavor, but the consistency was so smooth!\n\nThe service was top notch. I always feel like I ask a lot of questions at restaurants, but our server filled in all the blanks at her own accord, so I didn't even have to ask, which was a nice change of pace.

After getting a reservation two weeks in advance I wasn't about to skip out on this meal for any reason (not even the Phillies playing the Giants).\n\nSalt House far exceeded my expectations. Its set in a unique brick building with a decor of thick wood accents and fun mirrors. A communal table resides in the middle of the room (for those of you who like dining alongside complete strangers) and the kitchen is open to the main dining area so you can watch for tasty plates as they get served up.  To my surprise, the feel was casual and maybe only 15% hipster, with most diners wearing jeans.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu, we chose to go heavy on the apps and split one entree (the steak...YUM), but that's not to say the entree menu was lacking in the least. However, it turned out to be a good choice, because we got to split 4 lovely small (but not too small) plates and try a variety of tastes they had to offer.\n\nThe crab appetizer looked like a crab salad but tasted like a chunky crab cole slaw (heavy on the crab, woot!), salty of course, and enhanced by the tiny fried artichokes mixed throughout. The fresh yellowfin tuna came atop a bed of beets and some sort of gelatin mixture, but whatever it was, the result was delicious. I had never had poutine but when I learned what it entailed I knew it was right up my alley. Basically, large, fresh cheese fries with gravy and chunks of beef. Best part of the meal, by far. The crispy shrimp appetizer was just that but nothing to lament about.\n\nAs I said, we chose the steak, which was juicy and accented with small carrots, potatoes and a special sauce which made it all the better. For dessert I had the rubarb tart, which was great if you like rubarb. All around, an amazing meal and the perfect break from my two-weeks till Hawaii diet.\n\nWhen my beau asked me what I liked better, Salt House or its sister restaurant, Town Hall, I couldn't decide. And I adore Town Hall so that's saying something for this place. I'll be back for sure.\n\nAwkward Side Note: When I walked out of the bathroom stall there was a dude washing his hands in the sink.  When he saw me he didn't seem the least bit surprised. I doublechecked on the way out to be sure I hadn't swooped into the mens room after a few too many glasses of pinot, but no, I was right where I should be.

It was a packed house - patrons were loud, lots of laughing, wine was flowing. The hosts were really nice. There were no tables but lucky for us in the front corner on the other side of the stairs (directly facing the window) there is a narrow long bar where four or five chairs were... 2 were open! To even get to the seats you had to squeeze yourself behind the stairs. It was a really awkward place, but turned out to be just perfect. What was a busy, loud, and packed restaurant immediate turned into an intimate, quiet, and romantic experience. So we sit.\n\nYou could tell that care was taken in building the wine selection. Broken down by New World and Old World, there was a nice range of price as well. The wine we initially chose the server asked us a question on to verify that we would really enjoy it, and when we answered he actually recommended another. I really appreciated that and his choice was lovely.\n\nWe ordered white corn soup, the fois gras appetizer, and the petrole sole. I will say that in all honesty, the first two dishes were so memorable that I honestly don't remember a single thing about the entree. My favorite by far was the fois gras. I will shed a tear when fois gras becomes illegal in california. The Fois Gras was served in three ways - 2 cured and one pan seared. I thought I had died and gone to heaven each time I took a bite - it was incredible. Dessert I think was the least impressive, but it may also have been what we ordered... it was just a brownie thing with popcorn. ?? eh?\n\nI do want to particularly note how spectacular the service was at Salt House. They have mastered the art of \"just enough\" attention and three different servers cared for us that night. They took care in making sure that we weren't forgotten in the back corner and the dishes were spaced out well.

As for the main entree, my duck confit was so beautifully prepared and spiced that I didn't want to share any of it with the date. He felt the same way about his gorgeous steak. (we shared...but sparingly).  Finished the meal with a lovely chocolate fudge dessert, grappa and espresso and then rolled home to deal with our food hangover. As for the rest: loved the exposed brick warehouse ambiance and found the service to be very professional and attentive.", "author": "Suepattra M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-26", "description": "Rolled in last night at around 10 for an impromptu dinner for two.  I was poised to like this place because a) Town Hall is good, b) it is walking distance from pseudo-bf's place, and c) they serve until 1am.\n\nCaveat: 4 stars is a wee bit generous - some kinks to work out, as expected.  But the potential is solid, hence the rating.\n\nAmbiance first: I like.  Very industrial-chic, yet still warm, raw space, very open (almost too open - kind of sterile back there) kitchen.   Nicely avant-garde mural on the far back wall.  But as a whole, the place felt unfinished (discarded paint-splattered ladders in the entryway kind of a dead giveaway) - I'm picturing some future sprucing-up, especially towards the back.\n\nOnto food.  Menu was small: interesting but accessible contemporary American dishes.  Not too many great-sounding items at the outset - I was disappointed that the duck potpie was not yet there (according to our waitress, chef is debating on duck confit vs braised duck - how could you go wrong?).  \n\nWe had the tomato tart - think pizza kicked way up , on a reeeealy buttery puff pastry crust - and a very basic pear/endive salad to start.  Next was the much-lauded vitello tonnatto: this is a very classic italian dish that I've heard much about but never tried, because it sounds so disgusting: those two words translate to \"veal\" and \"tuna\".  Together.\n\nWarning bells were going off: \"do not order, do not order... veal and tuna, veal and tuna...\"  But waitress talked it up soooooo much, that well, we took the chance.\n\nHmmm.  Interesting.  Braised veal, very tender, nice flavor, and a little overly fatty and not quite hot enough, covered in a creamy tuna sauce that tasted EXACTLY like the white-trash creamed tuna casserole my mom used to make.  Except hers had frozen peas and we ate it with margarined toast.  Gosh that is embarrassing.\n\nAnyway, probably not a good thing that said dish took me back to my most white-trash meal of youth.  Waitress probably should not have extolled it as God's gift to veal.   And it probably should at least have been properly heated.  I sense this dish will not stay on the menu for long.\n\nBut I stand by my four stars.  Because the food will improve.  The wine list is nicely chosen, kind of in the affordable/interesting vein of late.  They will soon have Hangar One.  And the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating.", "author": "Melissa B."}

Due to the high ceiling and open-kitchen floor plan, it gets pretty loud in there. The exposed brick walls added a nice touch. Looking behind the line, all the chefs had different color bandanas on. It's mesmerizing to stare at the people who put your food together with such precision. There was even a girl chef! I digress....\n\nBoth my friend and I enjoyed our cocktails. At $10 a pop, they were stiff. It might have been my lack of enzyme due to my AZNness, that felt the effects of alcohol too soon. For apps, we shared a heirloom tomato salad and the gravy/cheese fries. They were UBER yummilicious. They used different heirloom varieties and used an arugula for the bitter contrast. Probably the best salad I've had ALL year. The fries were good, but it was OVERseasoned. The cheese AND the gravy were already salty, so there was no need to go overboard with the salt on the fries. I guess if you're drunk enough, you wouldn't notice. I did. And I was buzzed! \n\n4/5 was given due to the heavy salt.

The staff was also very friendly and engaging except for the speedy busser that was clearing plates and glasses before we were finished with them.\n\nI'm going to minus one star because it was very cramped. My friends facing me had a short wall behind them that was smashing them into the table and the woman sitting behind me was constantly ramming her chair into the back of mine. Also, our server, literally had no room to stand when speaking to us so she was constantly having to step out of the way for traffic to pass through. Another minus is that the noise level was incredibly loud so we were basically yelling at one another across the table and it took a good half hour to get the bill settled as the server was MIA for quite some time (it was really busy, so nothing against her!).", "author": "Donna V."}

The owner's wife painted a great depiction of one my personal heros Don Quixote on the back wall which adds some whack fun to this otherwise cool, rugged space. \n\nWe shared the pastrami ribs, actually I ate them all, the roast chicken, the chocolate budnt cake and the gingerbread.  For wine we tried the pinot by the glass which paired well with the chicken and the grenache which was a bit angular and maybe needed some air or sleep.  The chicken was the highlight and will have me back for more. The ribs were fatty and uninspiring.

Last night, a friend was in town and nine of us got together and headed out to Salt House. I've been here any number of times in the past and while I've generally enjoyed the food, the loudness of the place tends to make social interaction difficult. I didn't make the reservations on this occasion but I was game. Other than the noise this review gets broken into two parts; food and service.\n\nFood - I started with Poutine. Until recently I'd never had poutine. It's a Quebecois dish consisting of french fries, topped with cheese curd and brown gravy. Two weeks earlier I'd had them in Vancouver where I'd been staying for the Olympics. There I loved them. Cholesterol heaven and it tasted it. The poutine here were not quite as good. Not enough gravy primarily. If I hadn't had them recently I'd probably be a bit more accepting. So...good but not great. For dinner I went with the lamb with root vegetables. This was very good. Everybody around the table seemed to enjoy their dinners. The wine was fine...nothing spectacular. We ordered a couple of bottles of a Grenache blend (Domaine Pegau 2006).\n\nSo while the food and wine were fine, the service was lacking. Granted, this was a Friday night and there were nine of us, it took forever to be seated (with reservations), and forever to be served. Once underway things were okay and the waitress had a good attitude but we were famished long before the food arrived.\n\nOverall, good food, decent wine, slow service and loud environment.\n\n3 stars", "author": "Gary C."}

Actually, I'm \"a gay\" and recently took my partner of 6 years to Salt House for a belated Christmas/New Years feast (I had to work over the holidays which meant limited time and attention toward my husband).\n\nI absolutely love this place. This food is excellent (I've never left a morsel of food on my plate). The apps are amazing (hello, Poutine? Fresh cut, oven baked fries with melted cheddar cheese AND short rib gravy???). Yes, I had to remember to take my Lipitor after leaving this place, but every once in a while, you gotta remember to live a bit.\n\nAnd - thanks to Erica - I now have a new Favorite Beer! Delirium Tremens! God, I could have drunk an entire 6 pack. Sadly, Erica's first suggestion (La Fin du Monde) had just ran out. But, her second choice was awesome. If you like Belgium beer, you gotta try Delirium.\n\nErica also talked me into eating the Sea Bass with chorizo and red cabbage (she said she loves the adventurous types). LOVED IT!  Rustic, moist, sweet and tangy. Sometimes you get a waiter/waitress that only wants to sell you the expensive menu items. Erica was one of those rare gems that steers you in the direction of taste and not the price (unlike so many local restaurants that I could easily start naming). \n\nAfter two appetizers, four beers, 2 entrees and one desert, we left happy, content and planning our next visit.

First, the presentation of everything was awesome. I had a cauliflower soup which was surprisingly flavorful and we shared the poutine potatoes covered in white cheddar and gravy; sooooooo good (but they get cold and sloppy pretty quick). My date had the crispy shrimp and it came over green beans with some serrano ham; he was in heaven. We both ordered the skirt steak and it was one of the best medium-rare cooked meats I've ever had (clearly the chef takes his temperatures seriously... many don't and like to merge medium with medium-rare). For dessert we had the vanilla custard with some kind of rhubarbish type fruit and yummy crust at the bottom served with two linzer cookies. Mmmm. Food coma ensued...\n\nI had to take one big star off for service. Hostess was wonderful. Very friendly at the door. We were seated upon our reservation time. However, no one came by for about ten minutes. Once we ordered, we only saw our server once (to check in on our 3 apps and get us another glass of wine). She was friendly nonetheless, but disappeared. My biggest gripe was that the food runners placed our food twice on other tables in our section. Both tables were confused and had to tell them. We were also served wrong food on our table. Not sure if there was section confusion... but three times in one meal? Also, I was ok with the slow progression between courses because we ordered so much but it may have been too slow if we hadn't overloaded ourselves with carbs. In the end, once our dessert plates were cleared... no one came by (this was at about 10pm). We sat for about 15 minutes and I finally flagged down the manager and asked him politely for the bill. Never saw our server again...so odd? Right?\n\nI will be back... I hope the orchestration on the floor improves. I have faith!", "author": "Meredith R."}

Unfortunately the food was only okay.\n\nI started with the poutine and my wife started with the mixed lettuce salad. They were both fine but not particularly notable - and I'm looking for something special in $11 french fries and $9.50 green salads. For our main course I had seared tuna on lentils and chessnuts while my wife Sharon had the new york steak. I thought the tuna was adequately prepared and the lentils were amazing, but they just didn't go well together. The lentils would have been an amazing accompaniment to a more strongly flavored meat like lamb, but it completely overpowered the tuna. Sharon loved the veggies that came with her steak but the steak itself wasn't amazing and the short rib that came with it didn't have the kind of flavor you'd expect.\n\nThe meal (2 appetizers, 2 mains, 1 glass of wine) came to $120.

As luck would have it, we were seated next to a woman who had Yakuza tattoos half way down one arm. So maybe I had tattoos on the brain, but let's just say it didn't make my entree taste more appealing to have her serve us. \n\nOtherwise, it was a good experience. Nice decor. Seated promptly. Waiter extremely knowledgeable and courteous. I guess the overall style of the food is supposed to be around rather straightforward dishes, not especially spiced complexly so that the natural flavors come through.

I loved the beans but was not overly impressed with the shrimp - mine tasted fishy and I HATE when the shrimp aren't cleaned and I find their poop on the them. My sis liked her poopy shrimp.\n\nWe also shared the Tuna entree - based off the comments in the Yelp reviews, this seemed to be one of their best.\nI loved it, and again they split it for us. The tuna is gorgeous and with a great chickpea pesto thing under it. It tasted wonderful. \n\nWe were way too full for dessert :(\nI also had the Salty Dog drink - which is expensive and comes in a smaller martini glass BUT it was filled to the brim and strong - a unique grapefruit cocktail.  \n\nI also loved their House blends - the wines are available in different sizes so we got the medium (12oz) white and easily each had a full glass and half.

Getting a table can be difficult, and since I refuse to make reservations anywhere, (how boring) there have been times when I've had to wait awhile.\n\nSalt House's decor is clever, with masculine, industrial rusty beams and rivets, the clunky, chunky wood tempered with the cool elegance of white marble.  I love the touch of a communal table, adding to the laid back, sophisticated ambiance it's a good place to meet people and you don't feel weird dining alone, as I do quite frequently.  I especially love the gritty, Don Quixotesque painting splashed on the back wall.\n\nThe food is very, very good.  My favorites include the Dungeness crab salad, a fresh melange of wonderful textures; tender, sweet crab balanced with salty/acidic capers, crunchy arugula and crispy-creamy pieces of fried artichoke.  The marinated olives are simple, and taste house-cured.  However the Crispy Shrimp appetizer, though a good combination of light, deep fried shrimp, salty Serrano ham, almonds and perfectly blanched haricot vert, the Harissa sauce that the beans are tossed in was just too damn SPICY for my taste.  My taste buds were obliterated after literally two bites.  I couldn't finish it, and I noticed that two other patrons who ordered the dish ate everything but the beans, as I had.  My guess was that the chef either didn't taste the sauce before it was sent out, or they're trying to make some culinary statement.  Either way, that dish needs work.  \n\nThe New York Steak was perfectly grilled and at the time it was served with crisp pancetta and smashed potatoes, the ultimate upscale comfort dish.\n\nDesserts, alas, fall flat.  The first dessert I had was described as a Flourless Chocolate cake but in actuality was just a hunk of chocolate ganache, \"cake\" wasn't anywhere near that concoction. The house made caramel that came with it was well executed.  On my next time around, the second dessert was combination of pineapple and coconut ice cream and sorbet swirled together, which was a little on the icy side and was paired with a Macadamia Dacquoise which was lack luster and tasted slightly stale, but in the summertime, this dessert be a very good choice for something light.  I haven't tried any of the specialty cocktails, but they have a very good wine list, as it is at Town Hall.\n\nAll in all, the place is a winner, and though it's still quite young, I think it has become the City's new favorite restaurant.  My only other complaint is the lack of flowers in the place, so I guess I'll send Doug Washington a bouquet and offer my services.  \n\nLord knows they could use a good florist at Town Hall!", "author": "Candace W."}

Friendly service. \nMy co-workers and I needed a place to get our grub on before we headed to the Asian American Film Festival launch party, and Salt House is right in the neighborhood. We popped in without a reservation and the hostess had to deliver the bad news that she didn't have any tables available for a couple of hours. Often, news like this is peppered with an undertone of \"why didn't you plan ahead and make a reservation\" or \"don't you know how popular we are\"? None of this kind of attitude from the friendly hostess. The bar and the big communal table are first come, first serve, and we decided to hang out and wait. Lucky for us, we got three seats at the bar within about 15 minutes of our arrival. The bartender was really friendly as well despite the fact that he was slammed. Service was prompt and when he was busy he let us know he hadn't forgotten us.\n\n2. Full menu at the bar. \nAlways a plus when you're a busy, popular restaurant.\n\n3. Great space. \nThe atmosphere is chic, warm and inviting. Totally a place you feel like you want to hang out for a while. Their design is both industrial  and homey/comfortable. It takes talent to pull off that combination successfully.\n\n4. House wine. \nI really, really don't know why so any places overlook this personal touch. It's charming and it's fun to try a restaurant's house blend. Not to mention it is generally a little less expensive and therefore provides an option for the more budget conscious.\n\n5. Good wines by the glass for less than $10. \n'Nough said.\n\n6. Awesome food. \nMy companions and I shared the Bellweather Farms ricotta with pears, walnuts and winter lettuces. Awesome. I tried some of the spicy green beans off the crispy shrimp plate, dressed in an orange-cumin vinaigrette. Awesome. My ricotta gnocchi with mixed winter veggies was awesome. And we closed the deal with some - you guessed it -awesome sorbet with little cubes of poppy seed cake.\n\n7. Accommodating to vegetarians. \nI realize this isn't important to everyone, but for those to whom it is, note that Salt House will make you a special vegetarian entree if there isn't one on the menu. \n\nI am so glad this place is my work 'hood and I am already scheming about my next visit.", "author": "Angie R."}

I came in with a very open mind.  My party arrived and we waited by the staircase near the bar.  Our four top turned to a five top and they told us it would just be 15 or so minutes additional wait.  Fifteen turned into almost an hour...as the table we were waiting for apparently wouldn't leave.  As an apology, management sent over a glass of champagne.  Very nice!\n\nWe sit, order a bottle of red, and take in the ambiance.  I love the lighting and the rustic yet chic feel about the place.  We all agreed it was a very noisy restaurant, but no real complaints because we were a loud group ourselves.  (OMG!  I LOVE THAT....!  YOU MUST TRY....!  Okay, you get it.)  \n\nOnce our appetizers arrive, we divulge into them and start sharing.  I order the Poutine.  I mean how can I pass up french fries with cheese and a short rib gravy to top it off?!   A definite favorite at our table.   I'm not a big seafood fan, but I quite enjoyed the yellow fin tuna as it was fresh and other flavors were clean and crisp.  The spicy green beans and almonds that accompanied the crispy shrimp was very tasty and plentiful.  (Didn't try the shrimp cause again, it's not my thing, but I was told that they were good and the green beans were a very good pairing.)\n\nFor main course I ordered the flank steak and it now escapes me what veggies it came with.  All I recall is a green pureed vegetable mix that went quite well with my medium well (small-ish) piece of beef.  I enjoyed my meal immensely as did everyone at the table.  The wild striped sea bass was quite yummy, flaky and buttery (but still not my cup of tea).  \n\nTwo bottles of wine later, we knew dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  We ordered three to share (names escape me), but our favorite was the ginger panna cotta and this banana, chocolate pudding, peanut butter parfait (I must have at 1/3 of it...it was the closest to me proximity wise too.)  The rum soaked cake with the biscottis was too strong tasting that we all just had one bite and called it quits.  \n\nIt was definitely a busy Thursday night.  Our waitress was obviously busy, but did a fair job checking up on us and re-folding our napkins as we stepped away from the table.  \n\nOverall, great experience!

I like a lot of restaurants but I just had one of those perfect dinners at Salt House.  The ambience is very warm with a sort of modern/rustic decor.  The food and drinks were delicious, and the service was truly outstanding.  \n\nOne of the distinguishing features of this restaurant is their service.  It was absolutely perfect.  We arrived early and the hostess was lovely! This should always be true at restaurants, and yet... I find many restaurants where the hostess is obviously stressed and seems put off by an early arrival or just too stressed in general to be warm and welcoming.  The hostess at Salt House was perfect.  She made us feel right at home, let us know the situation, and let us know she would seat us as soon as she could.  \n\nWe started at the bar sampling their cocktails (i.e., Perfect Strangers, Kentucky Heartbreak).  The drinks were good and definitely lived up to their enticing names.  After a drink, or two, we moved to our table.  We went upstairs which is a bit small but super cozy, and now my favorite place to sit in the restaurant despite loving the communal table.  Our waitress was superlative.  She was warm and welcoming, she helped us with our selections, and she was super attentive when we wanted her, and yet she gave us plenty of space when we were busy talking.  At a nice restaurant you expect great service, but more times than not, it's just good.  At Salt House we felt taken care of, and it was really nice.  \n\nThe food was great.  The bread is obviously baked on site and it's definitely worth the calories.  For starters the cucumber salad was light and delicious.  The poutine, on the other hand, was ridiculously heavy but so, so good.  In fact, next time I am sad, I am going to drown my sorrows with poutine and a big glass of red wine at Salt House.  The entrees were all great too.  The presentation was lovely, the portion size was good (I hate it when I spend more than $25 on an entree and then leave hungry), and everything was tastey.  After drinks, wine, and dinner we were pretty full but we still managed to split a summer peach pie.  Just imagine a little pie baked to golden brown perfection.  Now imagine the taste of warm, flaky crust, peaches and homemade ice cream in your mouth.  Yes, it was good.\n\nOverall, I had one of those perfect dinners at Salt House.

The restaurant is situated next to a major construction site, so walking there at night isn't the most scenic.\n\nWhen we walk in, the place is packed. The front window is large and there is a small bar/ledge table that two people were sitting at, so we assumed it was a waiting area. When we asked for a table, the friendly receptionist told us we could sit at the window and eat. We asked if we were \"good enough\" to sit in the window and she assured us we fit the bill. ;)\n\nSo here's the part where I think I'm so cool. Sitting at the window, you see everyone walking in and out of the place and on the sidewalk. At one point, there's a group of businessmen who have just left the restaurant and are standing in front of me talking. One of them looks familiar, but I can't place him and then it dawns on me, it's Willie Brown. Now, this is exciting to me because you know how many times I've read reviews of SF restaurants and people write that Willie was at the table next to them? Lots. But I get to write a review that says Willie Brown was standing in front of me and looked right at me and winked.  How's that?!?\n\nBesides the Willie experience, the food was great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers with the theme being to order things we had never tried or heard of before. I had heard of poutine, but wasn't sure if I had eaten it, so that was a given. We had to get the foie gras, ricotta salad and pork belly. Awesome. Everything was presented well and really, I do not think our service was affected by the fact that we weren't facing the restaurant.\n\nOur waitress and the receptionist came by frequently to talk and visit with us, they were really friendly.\n\nIronically, I ate at TownHall the following night and I have to say The Salt House blows TownHall away in ambience and a great dining experience.", "author": "Kittenheel S."}

The Hostess station is squeezed right at the bottom of the loft stairs and when you go to check in you're either blocking the entrance doorway or the path to the stairs, its kind of ridiculous.  I also don't like this whole nuevo trend of restaurants towards this huge open space.  The acoustics were horrible making it for a very loud dining experience.  Then they put this huge community table like 4 feet from the bar, so there's no space to enjoy a drink without bumping into the dinners at the table.  Frustrating!\n\nThe service started out stellar... our waitress answered all our questions thoughtfully and with a knowledgeable and honest take on the menu and wine list.  So sad it went all down hill from here.  First, she forgot our wine order and asked us twice how we were doing on drinks when we were still waiting for our wine.  Then she forgot to put in our appetizer orders and never apologized for this mistake.  We did finally get our 2 appetizers (the scallops, which were average & the  fries which were a fantastic gourmet take on chili cheese fries) in the middle of our dinner and were told they'd be comped.  However, when the bill came they were still on there, so we had to ask to have them removed.  Oh, and the bill is literally just a slip of paper placed on your table like you've just finished a meal at Denny's.  Classy!\n\nGood thing that the food was so good, otherwise this evening would have been a total waste.  I enjoyed my sole, and my dinning companions loved their tuna and calamari respectively.  The chocolate malt dessert was divine... I've never had anything like it before and was pleasantly surprised. \n\nOverall, I'm not sure if this restaurant knows what it wants to be: just another casual dinning experience  or a special occasion gourmet experience.  The food and the prices support the latter, while everything else is very casual.

There were so many great things on the menu, so it was definitely hard to choose. We ended having the walnut tart and chocolate fudge bar. The tart was amazing!!! Delicious, buttery crust filled with a sweet walnut mixture. It was topped with a large scoop of roasted banana ice cream! YUM! The ice cream was so good! It was perfect with the tart. The chocolate fudge bar was good, but a little too decadent and rich for me. I loved the roasted nuts on the bar though. \n\nOverall, I had a great time at Salt House. I would definitely come back soon!", "author": "Denise L."}

We arrived and were told that our table was just paying their bill and it shouldn't be too long.  Ten minutes later one of the hosts comes up to us and tells us that our table has paid, they're just lingering now.  He apologizes profusely and offers us a glass of champagne on the house.  I accepted, and my dad (who does not drink champagne) asked if he could have a glass of red wine instead.  He was given a glass of a Hahn Estates Pinot Noir that was wonderful.\n\nWe were seated soon after that, and quickly offered our choice of waters.  For appetizers, we ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad which was very fresh and delicious, and the Crispy Shrimp.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the seranno ham was a lovely touch.  My only complaint is that the green beans were a bit too spicy for me, but that's just personal preference.  Our main courses were the Fulton Valley Roast Chicken and the Petrale Sole.  Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked, with great little vegetables on the plate too.  I loved the touch of big grains of salt on the chicken, because that's what I do at home when I cook a roast chicken, yum!  \n\nThroughout the meal, our waitress (a petite blonde who looked very familiar) was very attentive and checked in on us just enough to be there if we needed something.  We were too stuffed (the portions are quite generous) to order dessert, but some of the options looked quite tasty.  Maybe next time!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

It can get very loud during lunch - I imagine since it's in the FiDi tons of meetings are going on at this time (hence, the business lunch).

The staff is so friendly that we decided to sit at the bar for dinner instead of a table.  Gabriel and Harven are the type of bartenders you hope to have behind the bar when you're having dinner...giving good recommendations, checking in on you, making you laugh, etc.  \n\nWe order four appetizers:\n- squash soup:  I will go back just for this!  It was so delicious that I seriously wanted to lick my bowl\n- smoked salmon & beet salad:  I just love beets and smoked salmon, so I had to try this and I wasn't disappointed.  It was lightly dressed, which I like.  They had their beets in cubes, which is find, but I prefer my beets sliced thinly.  \n- pastrami spareribs:  so tender and flavorful!  I wish we would have skipped Ame for apps (even tho it was good) because I was too full to have the second rib...what a waste!\n- house of pickles:  not really my cup of tea.  They used, I think, cumin in their pickling process, or some spice that I don't like, but my friend loved it.\n\nThe other reason it gets 5 stars is because I did a major party foul and knocked over my glass of wine...wine all over the bar (and me) and broke the glass, but within 20 seconds, the bartenders and a busboy had it all cleaned up and another glass of wine in front of me.  I even forgot it happened until now!  That's what I call good service.\n\nI should also note that Maz and Doug, along with Gabriel and Harven, did all these nice extras that made for a very fun night!

First bite told me something wasn't quite right. I thought maybe it was the chanterelles or even the green olives.  Second bite, still not right (and definitely not because of what I originally suspected). Third bite + a bite given to the beau made it pretty clear: the fish was fishy--as in, it's been sitting there since last week and is past its servable freshness. \n\nNow, I don't want to jump to conclusions here. I don't want to assume that my very nice server told me that this was her favorite dish without really meaning it. I don't want to accuse her of using a sales tactic to get rid of the old, old sole inventory. After all, isn't that was \"specials\" at restaurants are for? And even if all these things were true, I'm sure she was only doing what management wanted her to do. I work for the corporate big wigs. I know what it's like to be a powerless peon. So my dear Chloe, these aren't points docked against you or your service. Don't take it too personally. \n\nWhat saved the dinner (and finally overpowered that fishy taste out of my mouth) was the dessert. We wanted something to share. I was leaning towards the fruit crisp while the beau voiced a strong preference for the panna cotta. Since it was his birthday, of course he got to decide. It was an excellent choice--probably one of the best panna cottas I've had. \n\nStill, I didn't come here for the $8 dessert. If that was the case, I needn't spend the other $150+.

I really think the average stars for this place would go up if management would bite the bullet and take out a few tables.\n\nThe service was excellent, the only downside being that when our main dishes took for-ev-er to come out. I ordered a sauvignon blanc and the tuna, and my wine was long since warm by the time the tuna came out. I actually thought about asking for an ice cube for my wine but I didn't want to appear gauche, since we were dining with my significant other's parental unit. But, I see on Craigslist that they are adding a line cook, so maybe the slowness problem is about to be fixed!\n\nOther than those two gripes, which cost 1 star each, everything was excellent.

We had a res and they were late seating us, but the host was apologetic, kept updating us,and we only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Normally this pisses me off but the host's attitude really made up for it. \n\nFood: delicious. We started with the poutine, which is fried potatoes, gravy, cheese and shortribs. I LOVED THIS!! Might not be for everyone, but we licked the plate. We also had the crispy shrimp, equally delicious, with a nice spicy dressing on the greens. Also, plenty of greens, it's practically a shrimp salad. My friend had the chicken, and I had the cassoulet--both of which we enjoyed. \n\nI was so stuffed from the starters that I only ate about 1/2 the cassoulet, server checked in to make sure it was ok, that I wasn't leaving so much behind because I didn't like it.

Not only was the decor way chic and calming, but I got to overhear FiDiners in suits talk about STI's.  (I is for \"infection.\"  Get with the lingo update).\n\nI ordered the \"Apuro Grande\" - In a \"great hurry\" for what?  Hmm.  Enticing.  Ripe with innuendo (isn't everything).  Lovely the relationship between cilantro and tequila - I'll have to have them over *in my mouth* some time again soon.  The menu didn't present anything I felt I just HAD to try, but I needed a snack and so opted for the soup.  Crispy \"croutons\" were more aptly labled \"fried batter\" and they were a tasty crunchy complement to the smooth creamy concoction with a hint of spice.  Not big or ostentatious enough to cost $8.5 in my opinion, but satisfying - given the bread I suggested they give me on the side.  As for my friends' drinks: the salty dog didn't seem like much, so diminutive in its martini glass after I'd enjoyed a big honking one at Von Kleef's the night before.  The Ginger Julep impressed.\n\nNot a bad spot at all.  Somewhere between \"yay\" and \"OK.*\" Recommended to me by the bartender at 83 proof when I noted that booze before something in my belly might be disasterous and he helped me realize that (obviously) 83 has no kitchen.  I'm not intrigued to come back for dinner, but may have another cocktail-with-culture here next visit to the MoMa.  This seems like more of an after-work gathering spot, but single women who don't have STI's may find a willing pickup partner who is very \"straightforward about these things, and clean.\"  Also a few dates appeared to be in swing at those sexy tables by the window.\n\n*Surely you must have by now figured that my star ratings are arbitrary at best.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Seemed to be a lot of staff running around but not a whole lot happening.  Finally at an hour and fifteen min in - entrees arrive    My husband ordered med rare ribeye.  I looked at it and asked the waitress if it was really ribeye - she said oh yes absolutely.  It was in chunks/pieces not anything like a ribeye should be so asked Him for a bite.  Seasoning was great but definitely not ribeye - you can't pull this shit over on me as I am a meat and food industry professional.   Manager comes back and asks how we are doing?   I asked her if it was ribeye and she quietly acknowledged they had run out and it was skirt steak which I know it wasn't that either.  I told her I was in the food and meat business and the waitress should have been upfront from the get-go.   Had I been the manager I would have comped something off the bill but they offered nothing and I refuse to ask if not offered when they should be.   We will NOT be going back.

I don't know if they really want to, but at least they're polite enough to pretend they do.  My point is, when I go out to eat, I usually go with somebody else.  \n\nStill, until today never had I heard the waiters address us as \"you two.\"  The first time our waitress did it, I thought it was a little weird.  The second time she did it, I pointed it out to my friend.  My friend didn't find it unusual, however.  Maybe it's just me.\n\nAnyway, back to Salt House.  The place is very SOMA chic: exposed brick walls, metal beams, etc.  The decorators did a marvelous job of maintaining the old printing press warehouse feel, while making the place look classy, not cheesy.  The lunch crowd here consists mostly of people with corporate credit cards, because lunch here is NOT cheap.\n\n\"Something to drink, you two?\"  They brought me a glass of iced tea and some water in a clear glass carafe with a black pirate flag and letters \"SH\" on it.  Then, out came the  bread: delicious baguette presented on a piece of brown butcher paper.\n\n\"Are you two ready to order?\"  Sure, why not.  I had the mixed lettuces salad, which was very good.  The butter lettuce was so buttery (pardon the adjective) that it distracted me from the rest of the salad.  The red wine vinaigrette dressing was very good.  I had the gnocchi with eggplant, tomatoes, corn and squash blossoms.  I very rarely enjoy a vegetarian entree, but this was one of those rare occasions.  The actual gnocchi were fluffy and light.  I secretly wished for some cheesy Alfredo sauce, but it wasn't meant to be.  My friend really enjoyed her Petrale Sole.  I tried a small piece, and I have to agree that the fish was tender and even a little bit sweet.\n\n\"Dessert, you two?\"  Dessert for lunch?  No, thanks. \n\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, the hostess said \"Bye, you two.  Thanks!\"  I politely waited until I was outside to laugh.", "author": "Yan G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-28", "description": "I was very disappointed with the food and service at Salt House.  I have previously been a big fan of this establishment, having enjoyed its food and style many times over the years.  This last visit was sad enough that I feel obligated to review it negatively.  The hostess was disorganized, rude and unfriendly when we showed up, on time, for our reservation. Despite the presence of a half dozen empty tables. the Hostess sat several folks who arrived after us, including walk-ins, had time to chat with the bar patrons and was barely able to speak to us long enough to ask us to wait, three times. Apparently, we didn't seem eligible or interesting enough to merit her attentions, unlike the young men at the bar she was fawning over shamelessly.  It was as if we annoyed her by being there.  \n\nOnce we were seated, the wait staff failed to notice us for quite a while. When the waiter finally did approach our table, he was obviously put out that only two of us were drinking alcohol - his attitude got somewhat unpleasant and dismissive.  He made absolutely no attempt to describe the food, engage us in any way or answer simple questions about the food.   He seemed so very sad and bored, a feeling we also got from the busboys, the cooks , the bartender ... the whole place seemed surly and depressed.  \n\nThe waiter only managed to show up twice more through the rest of the meal.  He wandered by once, dispiritedly asking \"how was everything?\" in a mumble without looking up.  He took our orders, then disappeared for parts unknown, leaving the delivery of the food to others.  Towards the end of the meal, he briefly showed his face, slapped a few desert menus down on the dirty table and stalked off without comment.  \n\nThe food itself was not as good as it has previously been - overcooked, dropped onto the tables without concern, plated sloppily and really somewhat bland other than the preponderance of salt on the meat and fish courses. The Poutine, for which they are somewhat known, was a massive disappointment - I had talked it up to the other couple dining with us, having enjoyed it a great deal in the past.  The fries were overcooked badly, the cheese was melted haphazardly over one half of the plate, leaving the other side bare and the gravy was cold and congealed.  First time we've ever left fries on the plate ... \n\nIt seems they've toned down the menu, almost certainly lost their old chef and have apparently refocused on being a local bar that serves food, no longer a restaurant with a bar.  For what it's worth, the the drink I ordered was not well made at all, watered down terribly, and not even filling the glass.  From where we sat, we could see the bartender work and I watched with a certain envy as the bar-side regulars got very long pours in their glases while our table got weak, overpriced drinks.  \n\nWe felt ignored, unwelcome from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.  For the price, this is no longer a good restaurant. It cost us $250 to eat there, a slightly higher than average price by local standards - in all honesty, the food and service didn't merit that price point.  I'm sorry to say I won't be back - there are too many equal or better choices available for the money, or less, and I'd rather feel welcome.", "author": "Paul G."}

It was until this day that I remained confused about Bambi's attraction to random clumps of salt and fat. My dad would patiently explain, speaking to his clueless, city-boy son, that the deer \"just need the salt to make it through the winter.\" Just like he needed the clumps of fat and salt to make him a better hunter, eh?\n\nLike our venison flavored friends, I was hoping to find some sort of salt lick, salted pork, or just goddamn salt at the Salt House. Ironically we had to ask for salt.\n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar - it's hard to get reservations and I scored two seats. The bartenders were busy but cool, letting me squat for two until my friend arrived. Folks around the bar were friendly and hip - an entourage from Slanted Door, Straights Cafe and Roy's chatted with me about their biz. Holla to Huey!\n\nAfter having some wine and bitter lemon drop we got to eating. I was all eager beaver about the menu - we selected five kinds of raw oysters including Kumamoto (holla Kuwamoto!), yellow tail tuna, crab salad, pork tenderloin, merguez and chick peas, and the rib eye steak entree.\n\nThe oysters were heaven. But we freaked out when we had our bite of yellow tail - there was an aspic-like citrus gelatin forcing puckers on our faces. Was this sashimi or ceviche - yikes! Things were not looking good. The crab salad was unique tasting but had a strong overtone of olives which led to horrible onomatopoeia in our adjectives about it's olivioliness. \n\nAt this point I suggested to my friend that \"our palettes were being challenged.\" I wanted loveliness not olivioliness. Fortunately the uber decadent pork belly warmed our bellies, and loins, and made everything better. By the time we made it to the perfectly seared rib eye, with adorning accents of chunky bacon and spinach we were in meaty bliss.\n\nAt times, dining at the bar sucked. People passed glasses over our heads and screamed to get the bartenders attention. But stick around till later and things will clear up, just like your highschool acne. The brickhouse ambiance was easy to enjoy, especially with such beautiful company. In summary, we had our fill of animal fat, but were hard pressed to find the salt in our San Franciscan forest.", "author": "Brady K."}

I ordered the house specialty mango caipirinha, which was very good and made with fresh mangoes.  The bartenders are very friendly but don't try to push drinks on you.  \n\nFor the appetizer we split the poutine because we used to live in Montreal and have a craving for it - so hard to find outside of Quebec.  The owner brought it to us personally and mentioned he used to live in Vancouver.  The fries were crisp and the gravy was good - the gravy comes on the side in a small gravy decanter.  The cheese was a big disappointment - it was shredded white cheddar.  Authentic poutine has cheese curds, not shredded cheese.  The cheese kind of lumped up and overall the dish was too salty, and missing the distinctive \"squick\" of cheese curds that makes a good poutine.  So, if you're a Quebecois expat craving poutine, this is not the poutine you are looking for.\n\nEntrees were good-sized portions; I had the ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly and my partner had the duck breast.  All very delicious and brought to the table at a reasonable time.\n\nAll in all a very pleasing dining experience and I would go back.

I don't know that I have a whole lot to add beyond what others have said. Overall, I enjoyed the food (Crispy Shrimp, Duck, and Apple Gallette for desert) but was left with the nagging feeling that something just didn't work about the whole experience. For example, the crispy shrimp were tasty (who couldn't love battered shrimp on top of enough greens to convince yourself that it's healthy?) but seemed out of place with a lot of the other selections on the menu. The duck entree was quite good, but I actually prefer the presentation and sides at Town Hall. \n\nThe decor is good, but I had a table near the door that was a bit drafty. Service was snappy and good.\n\nI wish I could put my finger on exactly what didn't feel quite right about Salt House.

If I was picking just one appetizer, this wouldn't be my choice, but they were tasty.\n2) English Pea Soup - my friend got the soup without the creme fraiche.  They serve it cold, she got it warm.  I liked it, it just tasted very very fresh.\n3) Spring Vegetable Salad - my friend got this as well.  I didn't try it, but she finished it and it looked good.\n4) Yellowfin Tuna Tartare - the apples were a really nice touch.  It was a spin on your traditional asian style tartare.\n5) Crispy Shrimp - So awesome!  Highly recommend this one.  The green beans were in a spicy orange sauce.\n6) Foie Gras - I'm not a meat eater, but I do try meat, especially when its a delicacy.  shit was good. \n\nEntrees\n1) Petrale Sole - two of my friends got this.  The fava beans were green, which was different, but again, everything tastes so fresh.  The sole was crispy on the outside (not fried crispy, just well done on top)\n2) Monkfish - this isn't on the online version of the menu, but this is what I ordered.  It was in a nice tasting broth with green chickpeas, which was different just like the fava beans.  It came with mussels and shrimp. Very tasty, the kind of sauce you want endless bread to dip in.\n3) Vegetarian Dish - you can ask for a completely vegetarian dish.  Another friend got this and she said it was really great.\n\nDESSERT\n1) Strawberry Trifle - i didn't care that i was lactose intolerant when this came out!\n2) Pistachio Ice Cream with Chocolate Cake - I didn't eat the ice cream, but my friends said the pistachios were to die for.  The chocolate cake had a chocolatey-creamy inside that melted in your mouth\n3) Coffee Ice Cream - again, I didn't eat the ice cream, but this was also finished (AND LOOK AT HOW MUCH WE ATE!)\n4) Cheese platter - I didn't partake in the cheese, but they're selections are great, with apple slices, figs and apricots.", "author": "Lindsay T."}

I thoguht it was going to be a sandwich...just because most chicken salads come that way, but not this one.  It was just chunks of chicken mixed with other stuff...I loved the flavor of the dish, but I tend to get bored with so much chicken...not a huge fan (that is my fault too for ordering this!)\n\nBut the hummus fries....oooo the hummus fries, they were so good, and inovative.  I had never heard of them before, which is partly to blame for me ordering the dish in the first place.  The hummus was lightly breaded and fried, and just really really flavorful.  \n\nMy friend got a bunch of food (bastard, cost me an arm and a leg! haha, I joke :) and a couple drinks, and we had a great time.  I will probably give this place a higher rating when I go back for a second try...but for now, the three stars stands...great place though, and I do reccomend it!", "author": "Kristin E."}

I like my place.  Why have you always got to be tempting me like that?\n\nI was in town for a very brief, very hectic few days of business and only barely managed to escape my across-the-street office for an hour-long snack with my best local friend.  We ended up at the Salt House for the simple, unpremeditated reason that it was directly in our line of sight when we walked out of the door --- and, wow, what a lucky find.\n\nHad a couple of drinks and just one split entree --- the fried shrimp on a bed of green beans and parsley --- and it totally knocked my socks off, and made me wonder what the heck it is that I've been paying for in Los Angeles these last few weeks.

Good thing we had reservations. I really liked the way the place looked. It was an old brick building with hardwood floors and wooden tables, which gave it a kind of rustic, antiquated feel. Wine glasses were lined up neatly on shelves, and the lamps hanging from the ceiling had some kind of thin index-card-sized wooden boards on them. I'm not really sure how to describe them, but I was intrigued by the lamps for at least a few minutes when I walked in. \n\nAside from great decor and service, this place had fabulous food. My tuna tartare was very fresh and had a variety of colorful veggies and herbs to keep the textures interesting. The other folks at my table had the roasted chicken, the dungeness crab, and the seared ahi tuna sandwich with a cold asparagus soup, and they all loved their entrees. We also split an appetizer that had crispy shrimp on top of spicy green  beans, serrano ham, and crunchy almonds with some sort of vinaigrette. Since there were four of us but only three shrimp, we asked them to give us an extra shrimp, for which they only charged us an extra dollar. The desserts were also excellent. \n\nWhat really impressed me here was the plating. We were sitting in a table right by the kitchen, so we could see how meticulous the chefs were in arranging the food just right. And the servers would often use white towels to wipe off excess grease or smudges from the sides of the plates so that they would look perfect when they arrived at their tables. \n\nAlso, they serve lemonade in wine glasses. How cool is that?\n\nI think I need to come back to Salt House for dinner :)", "author": "Lisa M."}

This place is busy with a cool after-work crowd but seems to be going through an identity crisis. It doesn't offer a wide variety of wines, nor beer, nor anything for that matter. It's a quasi neo something place that doesn't quite specialize in anything. It has a French leaning but seems to serve tapas type of food and the deco is modern-industrial. Anyhow, it's a cool place to visit after work. The crowd's hip. Perhaps having a small plate or two and a glass of wine or a beer before moving on to another location, but not a place I'd make my main destination.\n\nI do like this small seating area up top (a mezzanine of sorts). It's a cool look, but it looks quite small. In fact, we sat in the middle community tables and they weren't very comfortable and servers had a hard time getting through. Somehow the traffic in that place doesn't seem to flow very well.\n\nIn terms of food....we had appetizers only: Poutine (okay); crispy shrimp (good); crispy egg (not really my thing); and two artisinal cheeses recommended by our server (wonderful!). The bread they bring out is also quite fresh and good. \n\nBottom line: Cool place to visit and have a drink or two after work with a cool crowd.

I've read about how loud this place can get but it was very quiet when we began our meals, albeit it did get louder as the night wore on and carafes of wine started flowing like, well, wine.  Even though the tables were close together the high ceilings made it possible to have an intimate conversation.   There is also a cool upstairs deck thing that looks fun to sit on.\n\nSERVICE:  I don't know how to describe the service here in eloquent words so I'll stick with awesome.  The FOH staff always seemed to be there when we needed them and away when we didn't.  Our server was very nice and wasn't bad to look at either. ; )  She wasn't too forward or too quiet and was very friendly and approachable.  \n--My only issue is that there was no specials for the night.  This is not a huge deal but I was looking forward to something off the menu.  I don't think it's too much to ask when you are paying $40-50 per head.\n\nDRINKS:  We had a carafe of their red wine blend.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't too good either.  Then again I don't expect much from house poured blends to begin with.\n\nFOOD:  We started with the Poutine and the squid.  Both of the dishes were marvelous and well portioned.  The broth that came with the squid was on the salty side though which kind of hurt it.  We also had the braised short rib which was good but not great.  I had the duarta river salmon with potatoes and pureed leeks.  The salmon was amazing and they even left the skin on!  Nothing like some nice crispy fish skin.  The leek puree was out of this world too.  Minus points-- the potato vegetable dish that was served next to the salmon was way too salty.  I mean I know this place is called the Salthouse, but they may be taking their name a tad too literally.\n\nOverall:  I wanted to give this place 3 stars to be honest but the ambiance and service bumped it up a star.  Also, I think the salthouse can be a 4-5 start place if they tone the salt down and start offering specials that highlight seasonal ingredients and exude innovation and creativity.\n  I would definitely go back soon, but only for apps and drinks since I'm pretty broke as of current.\n\nHappy eating you weirdos!", "author": "Nick L."}

The food exceeded my expectations, but perhaps they were a bit low to begin with. Though usually I tend to gravitate towards seafood, I decided to go with the lemon chicken based on a strong recommendation from the waiter and the fact that I've been a bit burnt out on seafood lately. For appetizers, we tried the olives which were too strong for everyone else, except for me -- though a couple of them were a bit tangy. The chicken, however, was cooked to perfection and presented on a light bed of greens and flavorful potatoes. For $19, the value seemed high. \n\n2. Excellent service. Though our waiter clearly didn't know everything that was on the menu and was learning the ropes, he did an excellent job of keeping an eye on us. Amazingly, they were out of tea, but given that they're still new, small slip ups like this are to be expected. Nevertheless, the service is to be commended and when dinner was served, it felt as if we were served by those who had cooked our meal as at least four different people presented our plates. I always find that to be a treat and something you might expect at an ultra expensive restaurant. \n\n3. There's a fascinating art piece on the back wall that is a work in progress. I believe our waiter said this was created by one of the owner's wives, but I may be mistaken. At the time we observed it, there was what appeared to be a black knight in the center of two abstract outlines of horses. We were told that it would evolve over time. \n\n4. The exposed brick and metal beams combined with the soft lighting create an amazing ambiance. \n\n5. Located close to the Metreon, it's an ideal place to grab dinner and then grab a movie. It's roughly a ten minute walk or four blocks from the Metreon, but the walk is pleasant and it beats paying for parking at the Metreon garage which seems to get more and more expensive every year. \n\nCongratulations to the Salt House for opening up and offering a very hip restaurant that is bound to be an immediate success. Please just keep it consistent! \n\n- Rob", "author": "Rob C."}

I LOVED THIS!\n\n2nd course - foie gras which came in 2 ways, so you really couldn't go wrong with that. I liked the sauteed version better, and the duck that came with it was amazing.\n\n3rd course - crispy shrimp, yummy as well.\n\n4th course - yellowfin tuna sashimi. The tuna was alright for me, but the mixed salad w/ fennel, beets and lemon was close to perfection.\n\nentree #1 sole was good, but not the best\n\nentree #2 lamb loin was great! It actually reminded me of steak, and didn't have the lamb taste/feel to it, which we enjoyed.\n\nWe had two desserts, and although I don't remember which ones we had, they were both amazing!

Salt House was busy as a bee as I walked up on a Wednesday night, packed to the gills with happy hour revelers. The hostess was cute as a button, with gorgeous tattoos, and seemed like a virtual welcome wagon of hipness when I came through the door. \n\nAnd that is just the tip of the ice burg. The decor was really chic, everyone seemed to be having a good time and the smells were out of this world.\n\nI think I just  may have jumped the gun here.\n\nThe first tell tale sign? I asked the bartender if they was anything special that was not on the menu and he kind of blankly stared at me for a minute, like I had two heads. I gave him  a brief flavor profile of what I like and he said, \"well, we have Hendrix.\"  So I just ordered my usual martini. Specialty cocktails are just not some people's cup of tea. I can accept that.\n\nSo if we wanna talk turkey here, and by turkey I mean the food, I'll cut right to the chase. It just didn't do it for me. I got all jazzed up about the decor and the utter hipness oozing out from the walls, but when it came right down to it, I left feeling uninspired.  So much so that I am forced to review in obvious cliche.\n\nA brief cliche-free rundown:\n\nHendrix martini straight up with a twist, 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters, the fried shrimp app and the hangar steak, rare, with a glass of zinfandel.\n\nZinfandel = excellent\nOysters  = excellent with some interesting sauces. perhaps a bit too powerful for these plump little guys...took away a little bit from the natural flavors kumamotos are known for.\n\nThe rest of the food wasn't bad...just nothing spectacular. The shrimp dish was really heavy, but good flavors. The steak itself was cooked perfectly but lacking flavor, and beneath it was this mushroomy puree that didn't look nor taste very good. Like they just put some mushrooms in a food processor and plopped them on the plate. And with morels starring in the dish, why put another mushroom in there at all? \n\nThe service was good, the atmosphere very cool, but the food just didn't measure up, in my opinion.\n\nI'd give it a second try, but since money doesn't grow on trees, I don't know how soon that may be.", "author": "Leighann F."}

The room was very open, loud and rustic.  I loved the scene I walked into.  However, I am still unconvinced if the unfinished balcony is there for decoration or will actually become something else.  \n\nImmediately seated by our lovely hostess and within minutes waterered.  I love how they put a little carafe on each table. I drink lots of water and this touch helps to eliminate the time the server needs to hunt down a picture or a \"water boy\" to fill the water glass.  \n\nThe menu was very small but all seemed to be quality items.  I was very intriqued by some of the appetizers but the one I chose was the squash soup.  It was out of this world tasty.  Very velvety and not filling with loads of flavors and paper thin slices of chestnuts. \n\nwhen I placed my order I inquired about the shellfish stew.  I specifically asked what shellfish were in it.  she told me shrimp, muscles and clams all for $19.  Fine that is what I will have.  My companion chose the Skate Wing.  We had our appetizers, I enjoyed a nice $9 savignon blanc and within 20 minutes out came our entrees.  Or were they our entrees?  Nope the food runner brought both of us the Skate Wing.  I told him what I ordered and he took both entrees back (bonus points for not leaving one while I waited for mine to come out).  \n\nOur server never came back to us to apologize and reassure us that she had the correct order and it would be right over.  We waiting another 15 minutes...not exagerating.  My companion went to the rest room and over came the food runner with two more plates.  He had the Skate Fish correct but then a plate with a Grilled Cheese Sandwhich and Bisque.  I told him yet again this is not what I ordered and informed him that it was the Shellfish Stew.  He was embarassed and appologized, took both back and came back to me in minutes plopping down the grilled cheese and saying it was on the house and they would put in my order for the correct meal.  \n\nI felt my options were as follows:\n\n- tell him to leave my companions meal while I waited for the correct meal to be prepared for me. This way he could eat.\n- tell him to forget about the stew and suck it up and eat my wrong meal\n- have us both wait until mine was ready and then my companion would have a hot meal but no doubt it would be dried out. \n\nI chose to suck it up and eat the grilled cheese and allow my companion to hae a hot meal and not feel pressure to wait for me.  Although my grilled cheese was comped they should have comped both main courses as my companions meal was waiting because of mine.    I give them credit for trying to offer something for the mishap.  But guess what?  My waitress never once came over to apologize for this mishap.  When our meals were done she came over offered us dessert and then finally the bill for what we ate and they never took off the price for the my meal as they said they would. I had to ask our waitress about it and again no apologies. \n\nIN summary, the food was good, the soup was memorable, the rest of the food was not. My service could have been so much better.  I won't allow one bad waitress to totally ruin my opinion of the place. I will try it again but please know for lunch it is a bit more than most people like to pay.

I'd suggest splitting a plate between two or more people though, otherwise there'll be no need for lunch! For lunch, I had the pork shoulder with gaujillo chilis over parmesan polenta - SO PERFECT.

Judging by the way he tore it up, it seemed that it tasted that way too. \n\nPerks to the visit....\n\n1.

(So, it was a free lunch for me, but unfortunately, I was expected to pay attention to their sales pitch -- leaving me less opportunity to enjoy my lunch!)\n\nSalt House is the quintessential downtown \"let's do lunch\" eatery -- the crowd is made up almost completely of the well-heeled expense account types. Despite this, the place feels friendly, and the space, while a bit bare, and quite noisy, is bright and inviting. We arrived a bit after 11:30 -- an early lunch hour for me, and for Salt House too, obviously - we were the first diners in the place -- and were seated in a smaller upstairs area, with a view over the rest of the restaurant and bar area. The menu seems very unpredictable -- I've been to Salt House a for lunch a few times, and there seems to be almost no consistent item (with the possible exceptions of the Burger and the Poutine). As a result, I'm always scrambling to choose something --  forced out of my comfort zone! -- and attempting to read between the lines of the servers' glowing recommendations.

This time, the recruiter ordered the Shrimp & Crab BLT, while I got the Lamb Goulash -- it turned out the BLT was an open-faced sandwich with *very* creamy seafood innards, not really to my taste -- but the goulash was  excellent -- a delicate dish (considering what it is) in a large bowl - meat and carrots and soup and spices on a bed of little new potatoes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-22", "description": "I did something today I promised myself I would never do, I ordered off the Dine About Town menu (GASP!). Yeah I know, hang my head in shame and all that, but I had a really good reason to, the dish I wanted wasn't on the regular menu and it just sounded so good, and it was only for a moment, and well, we've all done things we weren't supposed to at one point in our lives right?\n\nSalt House. I didn't know what to expect from a place named after a spice or even a place tucked away next to Roy's. When you walk in, you see how deep the restaurant really is. In the front, there are stairs that lead up to an elevated balcony/platform with additional tables. The ceilings are high and the beams exposed. The walls are exposed brick and the tabletops remind me of thick maple butcher's blocks. There's a bar along the right side of the restaurant and behind that, an open kitchen. You get the feeling that you really are in a Salt House (whatever that may be). I really liked the way the space was laid out.\n\nPerusing over the menu, I was immediately drawn to the Pomegranate Refresher (pomegranate/cranberry juice, simple syrup, fresh lemon, and soda). I'm usually not one for Pomegranate drinks, but my curiousity was piqued and I'm glad I took a chance on it. It was delicious. Crisp, refreshing, not too sweet, like drinking some sparkling jam. We then moved on to the appetizers, the DAT menu came with a Beet and Blue Cheese Salad and I also ordered the Foie Gras Torchon (get it while you can, it'll be gone in 2012 thanks to those damn tree huggers). OrangeJenn went with the Trout and Citrus Salad while my other companion JLau went with the Poutine (French Fries topped with cheddar and gravy). Beet and Cheese salad was excellent, I hate it when the cheese overpowers everything else or if the beets are overcooked. Neither was the case here. The julienned D'anjou pears added to the texture and sweetened the plate a bit. The Trout Salad paired trout (usually a bold flavor) with citrus (orange and grapefruit) which really married well with the fish. I only had a few bites, but I wanted more. The poutine was only ok and a little heavy for me. Potatoes, gravy, and cheddar all in one plate. I'd avoid it again next time. The Foie Gras Torchon featured quince and apple butter. The tartness of the quince tempered the intenseness of the Foie Gras and at the end of the bite, the  taste of apple butter was left lingering on the palette, making each bite better than the last.\n\nFor our entrees, OrangeJenn got the Beef Brisket Chili, JLau got the Salt House Burger (Medium) and I got the Posole of Pork Shoulder. The Chili was only ok, nothing to jump for joy about. She thought the brisket would kick it up, but it didn't. The chili came with a side of grilled cheese (smoked gouda) which turned out to be better than the chili itself. JLau liked his burger, but I noticed it was cooked closer to Medium Well  than Medium and the accompanying finely sliced onion rings seemed to clump and were a little greasy. My own Pork Posole was a whole other matter. The Pork Shoulder was cooked to tender perfection, as if it had been stewed for hours. Coupled with the garbanzo beans and the bold sauce, all that was needed was some heat, readily provided by tossing in the accompanying pickled red and green jalapenos. I was in heaven. Spoonful after spoonful, I soaked up all the varied flavors and texture, leaving behind only an empty plate.\n\nFor dessert,  the DAT came with a Brown Butter Blondie, Butterscotch Gelato, and Maple Cream. This was the perfect ending to the meal. The Blondie was dense and flavorful and went well with the gelato. I couldn't really taste the maple in the cream and I thought the chocolate sauce on the bottom was a little too dark and bitter. All in all, I was impressed with this place. My only caveat to anyone wanting to try this place is to stay away from all the plates that sound heavy initially. Stick with the lighter stuff and you won't be disappointed.

The layout is terrible.  They've got a community table right up front that is just completely in the way and I would definitely try to sit as far to the back as possible.  The restaurant can get loud...probably a three-beller by His Holiness Michael Bauer's standards.\n\nAs for the food, my companion summed it up perfectly: Hearty.  You get a LOT of food.  Some of the starters could be entrees, like the pastrami ribs where you get three huge short ribs.  We got the famed crispy shrimp and were a little surprised that there were only three shrimp perched dangerously on yellow and green beans.  What's with the threes?  How am I supposed to share?  I'm an only child so sharing is hard enough, but how do you share three shrimp???\n\nAnyway, we had the veal and the chicken.  I have the say, the chicken was excellent.  I'm not normally one to order chicken at a restaurant, but it was fantastic.  The veal was well done and fell off the bone, but there was just too much of it and it was quite rich.\n\nGood wine list (although our wine arrived above room temperature) albeit limited.  And well priced.  The desserts were quite good although not particularly impressive...everything looked somewhat standard.\n\nOverall, a good experience, but nothing really stood out.

The restaurant is in an old early 20th century printing press building, and the industrial loft-like decor is matches the atmosphere that they are trying to convey.  \n\nYes some  people may compare Salt House to NoPa, but in general I don't think that this is a valid relevant opinion.  Yes, they both have cool cocktails and a communal table in case you didn't make a reservation, but the food is a lot better at Salt House.  The fois gras is to die for, and  the autumn salad is minimal but so delicious.

Why and how these places attain this attention is nebulous at best.  My guess is that a small group of SF's restaurant elite, hipsters, and the wicked witch of the West get together yearly to bestow this coveted award.  Some of the choices are great and endure from year to year... some fall by the wayside (remember Gordon's House of Fine Eats?)\n\nThis year, the contenders are NOPA, Pres a Vi, and Salt House.\nThe current trend seems to be a relaxed atmosphere, communal dining, and simple food for sharing.\n\nStep inside the Salt House and you'll see an eclectic mix of business diners blowing off steam after work, students from the nearby school, and those goddamned hipsters I hate so much.  If you don't have a reservation, you'll likely be shown the bar or one of the communal tables.\n\nThe food is pretty straightforward and unpretentious.  Nothing wild or crazy here, portions are decent.\n\nLikes:  1) the casual vibe that says \"I'm cool, but I'm not trying that hard to be cool\".  2) The glass milk jugs they use as water pitchers with their very own Salt House logo painted on it.  3) Pork belly, who doesn't like pork belly?\n\nDislikes: 1) Hit or miss menu, fairly standard fare.  2) Those goddamned hipsters!", "author": "Gracie-C Y."}

I thoroughly researched the menu before going to this place because I wanted to make sure I got the best dishes.  The oysters were great.  The poutine was fantastic.  My halibut entree - eh.  The fish was pretty good.  It was presented in a seafood broth/sauce with shrimp.  I thought the shrimp really didn't make sense with the fish and didn't do anything to bring out its flavor at all.  Somewhat of a disappointment.\n\nI went for carrot cake for dessert.  I LOVE carrot cake.  To my disappointment, the carrot cake was completely overpowered by tangerines. I couldn't taste anything but the tangerine at all. It ruined the carrot cake.  \n\nMy guy got the chicken after I told him how many yelpers had reccommended it.  I felt bad telling him that after I tasted it.  It was pretty good, but it wasn't as remarkable as the reviews I read claimed.  However, the accompanying asparagus was delish.\n\nThe service was great and attentive.  The waitress was very nice.  My one complaint about the service was that the buss boy who clears the tables was a little too eager to clear us out.  He kept asking if I was done with things when I wasn't.  I had lots of food left.  Also, I had 1/2 a glass of wine on the table (along with my dessert wine) and he really wanted to clear it. I almost felt as if I disappointed him that I wasn't done with it.

Downtown, close to work etc. etc. From the start let me say, the consensus at the end was unanimous- we aren't going back. \n \nSalt house, I wanted to like you. Really wanted to. All the makings were there. Good reviews, good location, nice decor, great company, but the two things that actually matter- the Food, and the Service were severely lacking. \n \nFirst introduction was the none other but the tap water or bottle water question- (Please see review of Jardinire to explain how this already drives me up a wall.)\n \nTime to get foie gras (the best thing all night) from sit down was 50 minutes. Time to get our entree, post poor sacrificial duck- about an additional 40 minutes. (Our server took a \"break\"- which would have been fine, had the food actually arrived in a timely manner.)\n \nMine, Petrale. Salt less (I thought this was a SALT house) on some very unexciting beans. There was mention on the menu, and I was very much looking forward to of a very fancy broccoli/ asparagus fusion vegetable that made an appearance in the form of about half the size of my pinkie (and FYI, I have v. small hands) Way to many beans. I didn't finish it at all. \n \nNo one actually checked back to see how things were. Anyone who has waited tables knows that after the first, second bite it is helpful to check back to see if temperature, cook etc. is good. Regardless, we are such polite people I am sure we would have said things were fantastic no matter what. However, it is the asking that is important/\n \nAt that moment I wished I had eaten the bread. \n \nHis, Much Much better than mine. I had food envy. The Dry Aged Rib Eye was perfect, and very tasty- if you go there, get the same thing and don't feel guilty about it.  (He would give them 3 stars)\n \nThe best line was the end of the night when the one thing we liked on the dessert menu, some pear thing wasn't being served because \"the chef doesn't feel like it is up to par and is refusing to serve it\".

I love these restaurants that blend old rustic charm with modern decorative elements.  \n\nAs we perused the menu we decided there were more interesting appetizers than there were entrees so we agreed to get about 6-7 apps and share one entree.  We started off with the shellfish plateau which was a melange of oysters, clams, mussels, and peeled cooked shrimp on a mound of ice served in a large stainless steel mixing bowl.  The seafood was fresh and delicious.  The 6 appetizers we ordered included Poutine (steak frites w/ short rib gravy), Cauliflower soup, Crispy Shrimp (served over spicy green beans, almonds and serrano ham), Yellowfin Tuna (seared and served with leeks and a green garlic truffle vinaigrette), Suckling Pig (served w/ lentils and roasted garlic, and Foie Gras (both seared and torchon).  The one entree we ordered to share was their grilled hanger steak (figured \"eh\" we don't have a beef dish yet).\n\nI really enjoyed having the variety of different appetizers rather than your traditional 3 or 4 course meal.  It really gave us a true sense of the \"new American\" cuisine that the Salt House offers.  The Salt House is the second restaurant of the founders of Town Hall.  From my recollection of eaten at Town Hall on 2 other occasions, I like the ambience and the food offerings of Salt House better.

The appetizers though caught our eye so we picked a couple to share - foie gras, seaboat scallops, baked oysters, and poutine - all of them were great!!! The foie gras was buttery, the scallops were done just right and sat atop a bed of corn, black-eyed peas and bacon bits- yum! The poutine was yummy due to the use of Gruyere cheese and a savory meat gravy. The baked oysters were good - they had some breadcrumbs piled on top and broiled, but were under done for my taste.

Our partner recently took us here for a lunch meeting and it was fantastic. The place looks very rustic and the service was good. After reading reviews on yelp, I noticed that most people raved about the poutine which I had to have. French fries smothered with gravy and topped with cheddar ($12), slightly different than how the Canadians would do it. I prefer cheese curds but this appetizer was pretty good nontheless - yum.\n\nI had the duck confit ($18) which came plated perfectly on a bed of lentils. The duck - juicy and moist with a nice crispy crust seared from the ducks fat - yum. The lentils which I didn't care much for so I won't waste my time describing it.

When I made the reservation they put a note down requesting a quiet table, and the hostess went to enormous lengths to situate us where my dad would be comfortable.  It worked out really well.\n\nImpeccable service continued.  Our server despite having to crouch not to hit his head on the stairs insisted on delivering things in front of me without my help, saying \"You'll miss the fun of being served if you do that for me.\"  He played a little joke on my mom (he had a very fun sense of humor), and when my dad dropped his fork it barely hit the ground before it was snatched up and replaced.\n\nFood arrived in good time, hot, and was incredible.  I ordered as many different dishes as I could get away with: crispy egg, seared tuna and autumn salad for starters, Mom and brother had lamb, sole for Dad, and ribeye with grated marrow for me - best ribeye I've eaten all year.  I ate every bite.\n\nDessert was shared chocolate thing, shared quince upside-down cake, and a comped dish of rum raisin ice cream for me simply because the server thought it the best rum raisin he'd ever tried.\n\nWe had two bottles of wine throughout the dinner and afterward I crawled home with my belly bursting.

So, come on.\n\nThe food? Half-good. My meatloaf was really wonderful -- great texture, and a beautiful chanterelle sauce. My friend had sole with a pureed-carrot sauce that was really delicate. There were house-made potato chips that were pretty light and tasty. But my mashed potatoes were inedible. In. Edible. So much salt, it was as if the chef had been thumped on the back by one of the Three Stooges while pouring salt into the potato pot.

The drinks are great, along with the wine selection and you know, several of the menu items make for a great appetizer.

Slightly salty, but good nonetheless.  \n\nMy companion opted for the Baked Oysters as her entree.  You really can't screw these up (I could make Oys.

This is the first time I have seen a Dry Aged Rib eye served like a bavette instead of an actual steak.  Nothing against \"beef bavette\" (had a great one at the Four Seasons Palo Alto for a business lunch for less $)...this was just a \"steak gone wrong.\"  The culinary genius in the kitchen also decided it would be a \"neat little trick\" to cut and serve this piece of flesh against the grain so even their nearly-new steak knife required 6 strokes to make it through a 3/4\" piece of meat.  \n\nI will say, our server was a pleasure - she made every effort to try and keep our dining experience on track but the kitchen just flat-out can't deliver.

The poutine seems a bit strange but who can resist fried potatoes, gravy, cheese, and let me remind you, fries.

I have soaked up many a Molson with a late night snack of poutin, this fancier version did not disappoint. \n\nI know the reviews are mixed here, but if you don't mind a loud somewhat raucous scene, then Salt House is not a bad choice.", "author": "Seamus M."}

Since the opentable cutoff for same day rservations is 10:30 AM, we werent able to get a reservation so we walked in and sat at the bar.  Our waiter/bartender was contstanly refilling our bread basket and our drinks so that was a huge plus for us, it was Friday and about 80 degrees outside.\n\nWe started out with the poutine, boy it sure was heavy, but delicious.  I love poutine!  I had the sole and my sis had the aged rib eye.  My dish was so-so but her's was soooo delicous.  Her perfectly cooked rib eye was laid on top of a bed of fresh creamed corn (?) and pearl onions. I'm so getting this dish next time.  My dish consisted of a sole fillet on top some vegetable and a very good broth, which was satifsying but not extraordinary.    Good experience but they need to work on getting some air conditioning in that building.", "author": "Lauren S."}

But the food came in close to the rest of the restaurants in its league, if not slightly behind.\n\nI have always preferred my foie gras to be exactly that.  So when it came in two forms on the plate, one being the real foie gras I have always expected on my table, the other in the form of pate, I was a little disappointed.  If you do that to your customers, you are bound to have the pate foie gras untouched.  \n\nAnd the main entrees were salty (definitely no irony there with the name of this place).  If I must, must compare, based on the similarity of food and price, my pick would be to go to either Range or Brick instead.

With that said, this dish still left much to be desired and my rating below still stands.\n\nSkip it.\n\nI wish I could give this resturant a good review but with all the great resturants in the city to dine at this is just not one of them.  \n\nWe took some out of town guest here thinking it would be great to all try this place for the first time and hopefully love it. Sadly we were all dissapointed. I ordered the chicken (the very dry chicken) with some sort of sauce that did very little to moisten the meat. My husband ordered the thai snapper which usually implies some sort of thai influence like curry sauce or maybe a hint of ginger but this fish had neither and as he says \"left something to be desired\". I won't get into what our guests ordered because it's just not worth the time to describe. \n\nThe space is really great and if I were basing this review on the interior, I would give it 5 stars but since I'm not it's only getting 2, which is actually generous considering the price of this meal. \n\nSpare yourself the hearteache of paying for a meal you won't enjoy.

We were one of the first ones in the restaurant, but as soon as it hit 6:15, the place was completely filled!\n\nWe ordered a dozen oysters from all the 5 different varieties they had (the Drakes were my favorite) which were very good.\n\nTheir specialty drinks were pretty good...my husband had the Kentucky Apple which was made with bourbon and other liquids to make it taste like an apple!  Definitely too strong for my taste, but my husband seemed to like it...and it didn't really taste like an apple to me, unless you marinade your apples in bourbon!  I chose a Champagne infused with some grapefruit with a lime rind and touch of mint, which was good, but a bit more tart than I thought it would be.\n\nThe seared scallops and ricotta cheese salad were both good appetizers.\n\nOur entrees were left to be desired - nothing spectacular, but not bad either!  I had the seared tuna, and my husband decided to be adventurous and try the squid.  The seared tuna is served just like any other place...so it was good, but not unique and needed salt.  I don't ever salt my food and this was the first time I had to.  The squid on the other hand was, again, adventurous.  The sauce itself was overwhelming.  Its as if they used the squid's ink to make the sauce.  Which in some cases can be a delight, but in this case, it was too powerful, too saturated.  Although the calms mixed in the dish were extremely good, but they weren't cased in the sauce...they only soaked up enough sauce to compliment it in flavor.  We should have tried our waitress's recommendations for the steak and chicken, but it just sounded too boring to us at the time!\n\nThe dessert was fantastic!  We shared a \"sticky date cake\" - which was some chocolate infused with ginger topped with muscat toffee sauce.  SO YUMMY!\n\nThe people who go here are trendy 30 somethings and up.\n\nThe decor is modern with a rustic feel, exposure of high ceilings with brick walls and hardwood floors.\n\nThe bathrooms were a lot nicer than I would have expected them to be!  Its located in a common space outside the restaurant, shared with an adjacent bar.  There's a curtain covered window right next to the sink, which I couldn't help myself and take a peak - the window gave a view right into the bar next door!  :)  How cool.\n\nOur waitress and bus person were very good and always attentive.\n\nOverall we had a great experience outside the squid dish.  \nIt might be worth going back again and trying different entrees.", "author": "Gina K."}

But the server didn't miss a beat and took it off the bill, apologized and said she would let the pastry chef know.

If you've ever had a friend who is somewhat of a terrible person, but you're really very fond of them anyway, that's kind of the feeling I have for Salt House.\n\nIt's been... on the surface kind of inconsistent. My first Manhattan there was perfect (yes, brandied cherry and all), but the poutine, which is why I came was... not poutine. Wedge fries and gorgonzola? Meh. Service was friendly at the communal table, as were all the people around us.\n\nMy second time, the Manhattan I received was almost undrinkable, but everything else I ordered was absolutely delicious. We sat at the bar this time--the place is always packed. My companion and I split an appetizer and an entree. The fois gras was delicious, as was our monkfish with veal cheek. (To the person complaining about this dish: You know what? You deserve what you have coming to you if you're ordering your meat well-done). They were nice enough to put the entree on two plates for us, without being asked. \n\nI'd be back a whole lot more, but the price, while not unreasonable, certainly doesn't put it into the \"value\" category.\n\nUPDATE: I've been back several more times now, despite the sting on my wallet. On my last visit, service was especially stellar. Three people other than our waitress came by during the course of the evening to check on us, despite, once again, being packed.

If I had a restaurant, this is what I would want it to look like.  We were sitting at a table on the second story that had only a few table so it was pretty small up there, and it was was partioned off by glass walls that only came up about four feet high allowing us to look down on the first floor.  There was an open kitchen downstairs and it was great to people-watch.\n\nThey served us water in their own little milk jar things that I wanted to steal but I was in heels and a dress so I had to keep it classy.  Our waitress was friendly when she interacted with us but wasn't bothersome and overly attentive.  One of the hostesses looked like Amy Winehouse.\n\nAnd the food.  \nOh jeez the food.  \nI love oysters and they had five different kinds on their menu, so we tried one of each.  I always forget that I hate Fanny Bay oysters.  That one oyster turned out to be the only thing I didn't like that night.  After the oysters, we shared the foie gras appetizer which consisted of a torchon with this pear chutney thing and a piece of seared foie with a blackberry sauce.  See, I don't really dig foie gras that much, it leaves this acrid taste in my mouth that I get when I fall down really hard, but this foie gras did it for me.  The accompanying sauces with both preparations were lovely, and somewhat of an inspiring culinary experience. \n\nAnd my entree?  \nOh goodness my entree.  \nI had a dry aged rib-eye steak with a marrow crust, farro, salsify, and a short rib bordelaise (that had hunks of meat in it that were so tender they were falling apart).  First of all, I love rib-eye steaks, I love marrow, I had been looking to try some salsify, I never come across farro as often as I'dl ike, and sauce bordelaise is my favorite sauce.  When I saw this on the menu, I thought it would be a match made in heaven.

Amazing and complex dishes, prepared perfectly with a range of techniques and flavors and highly seasonal ingredients. Overall one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco, very tasty, and priced quite fairly for the quality. \n\nFor the two of us, without any wine (I had to work and he was still on East Coast time) our dinner came to $98 before tip. We each had an appetizer, entree, and coffee.\n\nMy appetizer was the day scallops, two large, perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops over a great sauce and vegetables, for my entree I had the Pekin Duck which was a perfectly balanced and flavorful plate of two preparations of duck over vegetables and fruits. Great flavors with every bite. \n\nMy business partner had the Yellowtail for his appetizer and the prime skirt steak for his entree. The skirt steak was served over short ribs and a mushroom preparation along with lots of seasonal vegetables. A dish which he was greatly inspired by and will be attempting to make himself at home (did I mention he's a very, very serious and talented chef).\n\nThe space is upscale, open, and attracts a professional crowd. We ate there on a Tuesday night and while we were able to get a reservation at short notice the restaurant filled up quickly though our service was excellent and the food was great.\n\n(and though my neighbor did spill wine on me that had no negative impact on my meal or experience and everyone handled the accident with great attention).\n\nI will be back and will recommend the Salt House to many people for a range of occasions.

I guess that was the problem there was very little invention and I have had and seen pretty much all the dishes somewhere else. I agree with an earlier reviewer that this menu is still trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.\n\nBy far the biggest disapointment was the service. For starters, and this is a pet peeve of mine, don't put the tables so close together. I know that a restaurant is there to make money but feeling like I am sitting on my neighbours lap and hearing way too much of their conversation does not make for a good time. Please remove one or two tables and spread everyone out a bit. Secondly Salthouse is an upper priced restaurant, agreed it is not a Coi but you are paying a decent amount for a meal, so I do not expect to be rushed. I do expect to see water glasses refilled, a smiling wait staff and genuine interest in my experience at the restaurant, I mean this is basic stuff. \n\nSo to wrap up I really do feel that if this restaurant improved on the atmoshpere and service it would be a good place and until this happens I will not be going back, there are far better choices in the price range.", "author": "Alex H."}

We tried the house chardonnay, the polenta as well as the scallops w/o chorizo, being that one of us was a pescatarian and the other gluten-free. We found the food to  be incredibly delicious but also relatively over-priced taking the SOMA area into consideration ( a glass of the house chardonnay was $14). \n\nThe passive-aggressive service was what began to slowly deteriorate our views on Salt House. Right after we ordered our selections, the waitress responded by informing us that the amount of food we ordered was definitely not very much ( I suppose implicitly implying that we should order more food to vamp up our check?!?) I've never worked in a hospitality food service area, but what I do know, is that a server should definitely not impose such inappropriate comments on the guests. Before we were even done eating, they began to clear our table, at which point we had to tell them that we weren't done yet. I wonder if they ever heard of 'asking if we were finished prior to assuming and clearing the dishes'..astonishing)\n\nThe food was pretty good, but the service left a very bitter taste in our mouths.

I had always enviously eyed the bread at salt house on my way to the food trucks, but had never venture in.  Finally today, because of the dine about town menu, a couple of coworkers and I gave it a try. For about $18 we each were given a small cup of corn puree soup, and a choice of either duck or seafood. The corn soup was great albeit a little sweet, but all in all a good dish. I was able to try a bit of both of the entrees and I was very pleased by the duck, and a bit underwhelmed with the seafood. As far as entrees go the duck was more than enough food and had amazing flavor, the seafood on the other hand was a very small portion that was more akin to a tasting plate or individual appetizer. Likewise the flavors in the seafood for some reason did not quite do it for me, as a lover of all food ocean related I felt like it was most definitely missing something. All in all I think I'll have to come back to try some of the more interesting items on their normal menu, but on this particular outing I was hoping for more.", "author": "Matthew L."}

Would go back just to have more.\n\nDinner started off on a high note.  I had oysters which were extremely fresh and tasty.  Husband had the crab salad.   It was tasty although a bit salty.  We were both starved already so those two items along with the bread didn't last long.\n\nHere is where the breakdown occured.  I was having a ball chatting and taking in the crowd.  Very lively, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Then Husband said, \"I wonder where our food is?\".  I hadn't realized we had been waiting a long time between first and second courses.  Then I peer around and pay more attention.  It looked like the kitchen was backed up.  Others around us were also showing signs of food depravation.  \n\nFinally, entrees arrive.  We were already done with our wine and bottle of water.  Major buzz working due to lack of food and a whole bottle of wine.\n\nFood was gone in a few minutes.  Nice flavors, a bit too much going on with the rib-eye but it was good.\n\nWhile the overall experience was good, I may need to come back again and give it another try before I give it highers stars.

I pass by this place as I was going to 111 Minna lounge and It looked pretty cool on the outside so I wrote a mental note to myself that I will try this restaurant out sometimes in the future. And that is exactly what I did for my cousin's 21st birthday dinner :) \n\nFirst of all, the waitress is super friendly and she was very patient and helpful at the same time. Besides the atmosphere and good food...I love friendly helpful waiter n waitresses. Second of all, this place has a full bar option! so it was not only Wine or specialty cocktails but a FULL BAR!! hahhahahhaha...gotta love having that option in nice restaurants. I had the grey goose and pineapple juice combo and my cousin had the tequila sunrise. It was really good!! I think I finished that drink before the appetizer came out! LOL! Third, the food was pretty good. I mean it was on the small side but hey birthday dinner! can't complain cuz its free! hahhahhahhahha...when the waiter brought out my steak I thought it was chocolate dessert for another table! hahhahhahha...then I realized it was my small steak! me n my cousin were planning to share cuz she had the salmon...but the salmon was small too! so I told her \"girl...sorry I cant share. Its not even enough for me! I'm sure u understand me...\" The chicken and halibut was really good as well. \n\nLast but not least, they told us that there would be a cake cutting fee for $5 per person cuz we brought the birthday cake to the restaurant. But when the bill came, they never charged us for that cake fee! they were really nice..so we gave them a big fat tip! ohh before I forgot, we had the famous fries with cheese and gravy plus the fried shrimp appetizers...they were really good! Even though I ate again after I went home cuz I was still hungry...this place is def one of the MUST TRY restaurant in SF :)", "author": "Rika K."}

The yelps were luke-warm on this spot, but I had heard good things, I love Town Hall, and it has a more seafood based menu than Town Hall, so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nI was not disappointed. In fact, I was presently surprised how much I enjoyed it. The had a very nice wine list and we had some great appetizers before our main course (the poutine - aka french fries with cheesy gravy goodness; crispy honey shrimp on a bed of spicy kale and green beans; winter salad with pears and parmesan). I had steak for dinner, also delicious, but the potatoes were a little strange that were served with it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-25", "description": "In the trifecta of businesses (Town Hall, Salt House and Anchor and Hope), owned by the trio of Washington and the duo-Rosenthals, Salt House would only Place or Show.  The clear winner is still the first and best - Town Hall. Although the sketchy slow service and abominable noise levels caused by overcrowding at Town Hall are some of the worst in the city, the food there is by far the best of the three. \n\nAs an aside rant... If you have already finished your dessert and you have already paid or the check has been on the table for longer than 5 minutes, you need to get your sorry ass up and leave the restaurant. I don't care if you are having the time of your life and you just dropped $100 a person on dinner. That doesn't give you the right to hangout for an extra hour squatting on your table while other people are waiting to dine. Take your party elsewhere. If you don't get that point, you are either an ignorant foodie wannabe or an asshole.  Trust me, there are plenty of both of those types in SF. \n\nTo me, where Salt House shines is in ambiance and service. A unique bar setting, subtle skull-crossbones, beautifully-inked hostess and dark and disturbing artwork on the back wall gave the place a bit of an edge. Our waitress, a stunning 'Catherine Zeta-Jones look-a-like' was on point all evening. She was the perfect combination of charmingly engaging attentiveness, without hovering or making us feel harried at the end of the meal, as the restaurant became crowded. With a gorgeous intelligent server like that, it is hard not to be one of those bozos who hits on the waitress, thinking he is charming, without realizing he is really just being a douchebag.\n\nOur appetizers consisted of the foie gras/tea duck and crispy shrimp. The sauteed foie gras and accompanying torchon were phenomenal. With the apricot reduction pairing giving the perfect accompaniment of sweet/tart to offset the fattiness of the liver. I would have to wonder whether Blenheims or Candycots would be even better in this combination? The tea duck was nothing special and needed a few pieces of crispy duck skin for texture. With the crispy shrimp, I kept thinking they should have reversed the preparation and batter fried the green beans with toasted almond slivers and done a saut\u00e9ed shrimp-style dipping sauce. \n\nThe main courses were the Steak, Pork Loin and the Halibut.  While the fish was cooked perfectly, the other meats were not. The steak, requested med-well came back med-rare and the pork loin requested med-rare arrived med-well. I don't know how many times I have harped on this point, but the cook level of meat changes not only texture but taste, creating a different dining experience than intended. This is a point I can't seem to emphasize enough!  The sides were executed better than the meats with the bed of stuffing under the pork loin being near perfect (tad too much salt), but hey it is the Salt House. \n\nFood presentation excelled, but preparation did not. The style is there, the substance needs a little work. All in all the price point was a tad high for the overall food quality, (especially if you factor in drinks/dessert and local competition from Boulevard). Also the outside bathrooms were a negative, but the edgy upscale urban loft ambiance and excellent service make Salt House worth a visit.", "author": "Dave H."}

The food was outstanding, the design and decor are impressive, but the service and bathrooms put a damper on the experience.  The hostess gave us attitude because we showed up with an extra person (granted, not ideal), the meal took almost three hours (so long that they comped our desserts), they plated 3 out of 5 mains and then the other 2 didn't show up for 10 minutes, plus the bathrooms are shared with Harlot, so by around 10:30 the floors were sticky and toilets were gross.  Dinner cost about $50 each including tip (not including dessert) which I thought was reasonable until I noticed that they charged us $3 for the bread.  That just seems wrong, particularly given the wait.  \n\nThat being said, it has a great menu (the Poutine was amazing, even if it's not really poutine - no cheese curds and far too pretty) and a decent wine selection.

Both recommended by our genuinely cheery-yet-not-overbearing waitress. Egg itself was nothing short of unique, and actually quite flavorful (breaded and cooked whole- but not overly done). The accompaniment of sausage and a tomato based sauce was less than thrilling- no spice, no bite- didn't really add anything.  Suckling pig was the winner of the night - served with a lightly-flavored maple sauce, grilled figs and turnips. \n\nThe entrees really lacked focus. I'm not trying to be a foodie biotch, but this is really the phrase that comes to mind. FI's halibut was cooked perfectly, but the light fish was overpowered by the butternut squash accompaniment. So overwhelming that the fish could barely be tasted/enjoyed. My sole was cooked well, but I was truly confuddled at what went on around it. Cranberry beans, pancetta, greens, clams, peppers, wine, butter, oil, other peppers, etc. etc. etc.... went on and on and on.

We never saw a server (ours or any other) for the next 40 minutes even though we were clearly done with our entrees.

I was in town for work and met my sister for a late after-happy hour dinner. She suggested this place and I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe restaurant was populated but not overcrowded for a Monday night. Having moved away from SF a little over two years ago, I'd forgotten the joys of communal dining tables - Salthouse reminded me. We didn't wait at all and took the last two seats at the communal, next to some interesting folks. The service was friendly, prompt and unpretentious. \n\nMy sister and I shared a striped bass ($26) and an autumn salad ($11) and 1/2 chicken ($18), along with wines recommended by our waiter. It's generally hard for me to praise a salad, especially considering dishes that hours of preparation, but this autumn salad was amazing. A perfect salad - simple, crisp, fresh, complimented by a light fruity dressing without taking anything away from the focus on vegetables. \n\nThe atompshere and the staff encouraged us to stay and hang out. With so many restaurants to try, I would still return some time. It's comfortable, tasty, and I got out of there for just over $100.", "author": "Kevin W."}

It was busy and there was lots of noise.  Since we don't eat much, we didn't order entrees and had 4 different appetizers instead (but then we had to cancel one since we wanted dessert).  We had beets, fried shrimp, and the halibut. The dressing they put on the shrimp fits so well in the dish.  The halibut was really fresh and the beets was really sweet!  Overall we enjoyed all the appetizers.  As for the dessert, I can't remember the name but it was ginger flavored and similar to custard.  It was light flavored, fantastic and quite refreshing to have.\n\nService was also great.  They actually divided the appetizers into two dishes for us before bringing it to our table.  The waitress we had was very friendly and helpful in recommending us to the appetizers and wine.  \n\nThe prices for the appetizers ranged from $10-15 a dish and entrees were above $20.

Then the wait staff kept trying to take our drinks away before we had finished them.  \n\nI love the way this restaurant is decorated.  The exposed brick, art work and fixtures are very interesting.  However, the space is extremely crowded for an upscale restaurant.  I think they removed one of the \"communal\" tables in front of the bar, which has opened up the space considerably.  Still, you should expect to be bumped into repeatedly by wait staff and patrons while trying to enjoy your meal.  The acoustics are terrible.  Dont expect to hear what your friends are saying--just nod politely.  \n\nLove the mixed drinks, particularly the salty dog.  Oysters in the past have been quite yummy.  The roasted beets are very good.  The warm bowl of nuts with honey and salt are usually the best thing on the menu, except that they burned the last bowl we ordered.  The shrimp and green bean salad appetizer was very disappointing (I'm sure I've seen this shrimp before on Popeye's dollar menu).  Last time we ordered the snapper which was nothing special.  The dish included pretty much just the fish and really needed some accompaniment like rice or potatoes or something.  \n\nHavent had a memorable dessert yet, but the dessert drink menu is pretty extensive.  They offer port and scotch, but also stock sauternes, moscato, calvados, armagnac and others.  \n\nOverall I like the Salt House. This still is a relatively new restaurant, and I hope that they work out the kinks because there are a lot of other good restaurants in the area without all of the problems.", "author": "brewgirl b."}

Continental? Californian? I still can't decide ... And the dessert menu was so mundane that we opted to go for donuts and coffee at our local donut stop instead.\n\nNow for the real rant - the service was so horrible that it ruined our overall experience considerably. Our waiter clearly played favorites, paying the most attention to the party of four in his section of four tables (his other tables, including mine, had two guests each). There were too many moments when we tried and thought we had successfully grabbed his attention, only to gawk at his retreating backside when he took off in the OPPOSITE direction.\n\nOf course, the other side of the restaurant might have had an entirely different experience, but new restaurants need to make the most of each and every opportunity to shine, and unfortunately, Salt House was rather dull in my opinion.", "author": "Grace C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-22", "description": "It's a fact; the owners of Salt House are jackasses.  They say so themselves on their website.  But they might not find themselves jackasses for the same reason I do.  I don't want to be cruel - there are, after all, many reasons to praise Salt House, but the service was largely disappointing and difficult to ignore.  \n\nWe arrived at 8:55pm for our 9pm reservation on a calm, Sunday evening.  There were four visibly empty tables, and yet for reasons unbeknown to us, the hostess decided the table wasn't ready and told us to start with drinks at the bar.  After 9:10pm she seated us at one of tables that had been empty all along.  That was one of many instances in the evening that didn't make sense.  Another example followed at the bar when I apparently upset the bartender because I wanted to pay for the drinks.  He took my card without saying a word and traipsed off to the other end of the dining room.  Shortly after being seated at our table, he returned my card to me without a word.  Sadly, that wasn't the only confusion with my credit card - I was later charged for my part of the final bill as well as a friend's part of the bill.    \n\nAs the dining room started to clear around 10pm, there was a notable difference in the demeanor of the staff.  The mildly aloof servers and the manager seemed to catch a second wind and pep up.  Unfortunately, they used that energy to leave us painfully unattended so they could consume their dinners in the back stairwell.  When our server returned to our table, she was still wiping her mouth of the food she had just devoured.  \n\nBut, I can't entirely blame them, since the food is quite good.  I would go back just for the Poutine.  Typically a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois street food, Salt Houses version is a beefy, rich and delicious plate of crispy French fries slathered in short-rib gravy and cheddar cheese.   It's elevated junk food for gourmands.   Gnocchi with saut\u00e9ed porcini mushrooms was tasty and accurately prepared, although the portion was precious, especially compared to the half-chicken my friend ordered.  Served with mushrooms, roasted fingerling potatoes and bacon, the chicken was so crispy and flavorful that I was tempted to pull a caper and run off with it.   We ended the meal with a few delicious artisanal cheeses, which was around the time our wine arrived that we ordered for our main courses.  \n\nWe lingered to enjoy our wine and discuss our experience.  It is truly a shame when I know I'll crave a chef's food again but don't want to spend money on poor service.  How can they get away with such neglect, we asked ourselves, trying to make sense of the evening.  Surely they are aware; surely they know better; surely they have given away lots of drinks and desserts to pacify disgruntled guests.  Or is this another case of a trendy, good-looking restaurant that gets away with minimal effort and still makes a profit?  Perhaps the owners are jackasses, but I'm sure I am one too, because I'll go back for that poutine, even if it means I have to go to the kitchen and make it myself.", "author": "T. L."}

This is one of those restaurants that have really small serving for big prices. 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of scallops came out on each plate. Same thing went for entrees. I ordered the Alaskan Halibut. It was grilled perfectly, but wasn't enough to fill me up. Everything I had was a bit on the saltier side too. Maybe that's why it's called \"Salt House?\" I don't know...but 3 appetizers and an entr\u00e9e? Call me fatty! There wasn't a wow factor to this place.

The executive summary is that it's not bad, certainly better than many downtownish destinations, but carries a steep price tag.  I ended up with a wild mushroom gnocchi.  The pasta was of pleasant firmness and chewiness, though the sauce, a brown cream-based concoction not unlike a confit marinade (sans the meat) was too rich and didn't allow the flavor of the somewhat paltry portion of chanterelles and shiitake to come through.  Portion size was adequate.\n\nThe service was infrequent and slow, understandable given that it was high lunch hour, but certainly pleasant when it did arrive.

The restaurant is fairly small though and other than the limited bar seating, there is really isn't a comfortable place to stand and wait which was a bit awkward.  The space is very lofty (old warehouse) and they were smart to design sort of a trellis over the bar area to make it a bit more cozy.\n\nWe were seated in the back of the restaurant (by a really interesting wall mural) where we had a great view of all the action in the exposed kitchen.  I can't remember what the chairs looked like, but I remember I loved them.  Random, sorry.\n\nThe food was good.  I didn't think Town Hall good, but good.  We started with the poutine (which btw- our friend, who is Canadian, was way too excited about- french fries with gravy and cheese- who knew?) which was good, but a bit rich for my liking.  I had the duck confit, which was fantastic and would highly recommend.  My boyfriend however, opted for the chicken by the servers recommendation.  Neither of us were impressed.  I can't recall what else we had which is usually means I wasn't blown away.  \n\nTwo things bugged me about the servers: they didn't announce the menu items they brought to the table (I know it is kinda lame, but I like it), the second is that they kept serving our dishes over the divider between the kitchen and our table.

It's a combination of fries, cheese and gravy. The fries were very good because they were crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tasted very potato-y. Unlike the Canadian version which uses salty, but bland tasting curds of cheese (that hold their shape more) this version used a very flavorful white cheddar that melted nicely. The gravy was perhaps the best part since it was a lush sauce made with braised short ribs. There were even small chunks of the short ribs in it.\n\nFor mains, I had the shellfish stew and my wife had the petrale. My dish was pretty good. It included a fair number of mussels, clams and shrimp in a buttery aioli-type sauce with fingerling potatoes. My wife's dish includes a carrot side that was spiced with Moroccan spices and topped with a mint chutney. It was quite good, but her fish was woefully under-salted.\n\nThe service was somewhat lackluster. We got menus and bread right away, but then our waiter seemed to forget about us. We actually had to call him over to the table to take our order. I really wish waiters would read your body language and tell that you want to order. Once the food was ordered things seemed to flow fairly smoothly. \n\nI liked the decor, and the prices were steep (1 appetizer, 2 mains, no drinks = $56 before tip), but not any more so than the typical upscale place in that area and we did order two of the more expensive mains. There were many cheaper options that looked good. Nonetheless, Salt House seems more geared towards a business lunch than than a lunch with friends.", "author": "Yogi B."}

If you pick a restaurant and it sucks, your street cred tumbles.  Poutine popped into my head so I picked Salt House.\n\nMy whole goal in life was to have a bowl of Poutine to myself.  Yes, that's greedy but I don't care.  Fried potatoes, topped with cheese curds and short rib gravy.  I'm sorry, but you expect me to SHARE that?!?!?  But since the birthday boy said the following:  \"Let's just order a bunch of things and share.\"  I had to acquiesce.  Altho I did not want to.  Frickin' birthdays.  \n\nWe ordered poutine, crispy shrimp, baked oysters, Monterey squid and the foie gras.   When the appetizers came up they sat the squid and oysters at my end of the table and the poutine at the other end.  I don't eat fish except for shrimp, scallops and sole.  I DO, however, eat potatoes smothered in cheese and gravy - I just stared as the plate of poutine made the rounds, landing at my seat LAST.  *sniff*  By then, it was almost cold and all the good stuff was gone. . .what I did get was good - a little different than I expected as I thought the cheese would be more cheesy  - it was more of a mornay sauce but tasty nonetheless.  The short rib gravy with little nuggets of meat was quite nice.  Once I got past my poutine preoccupation, I realized that the crispy shrimp was quite delicious - the shrimp itself being expertly cooked - tender, juicy and amazingly fresh.  With little shavings of jamon serrano, almonds, green beans and fresh greens, it was a lovely plate of food. . .the beans had a slightly spicy finish that I really enjoyed.   The foie gras was also a lovely plate - one coin of torchon and a small piece of expertly sauteed foie with a couple of thin slices of tea smoked duck breast that was flavorful and juicy.  \n\nDining out with civilians (i.e. non-restaurant type people) is sometimes taxing.  There are rules, dammit. . as in if you have a party of six that means you get to try SIX DIFFERENT entrees - huzzah for big parties!!!!  Well, boo for this one because four of those fools ordered the same thing.  WHAT?!?!?  Don't y'all know how to eat?!??!  Phooey!  (I know, I am sounding quite high maintenance, aren't I?). . .  So we had four orders of the Petrale Sole, I ordered the Fulton Valley chicken, and the person seated next to me ordered the New York Steak.  That chicken shall be what I judge all other chicken from now on.  An airline breast (which means it's the whole, boneless breast with the little wing drumette) and boneless thigh meat seasoned and seared to juicy perfection - it was perfectly executed.  With a creamy spinach puree, black trumpet mushrooms, roasted rutabaga and little tiny sticks of crispy bacon.   The steak, oh the steak, was also quite lovely.  Sliced and cooked to  perfect medium rare atop roasted sunchokes, Brussels sprouts with a little bonus piece of mustard crusted short rib.  At first, when I saw that little piece of short rib, I thought it was incongruous to the rest of the plate - it didn't seem to fit but it was so good. . .tender and well seasoned - the mustard crust off-setting the richness of the meat perfectly.  Besides, they gotta get that short rib gravy somewhere and what a great way to use the gravy dividend!  The four petrale sole eaters where also very happy.  A beautifully bronzed  portion of fish with clams, a delicately spiced red wine jus and the most delicious salsify puree - you never see salsify on a menu so that's one bonus but to have it so deftly prepared is wonderful.  I got stabbed with a fork for going in for one too many bites of that puree!  OUCH!\n\nMy mom loved her bread pudding and it was nice. . buttery and not too sweet.  The mint chip ice cream sandwiches would have been better if they had not used so many mini-chips in the ice cream. . I know, I am complaining about TOO MUCH chocolate?  But it was hard to eat - the flavor of the ice cream itself was great but perhaps more like a stracchiatella would have been nice.  The birthday boy got the Bittersweet Chocolate Cremeux - essentially a giant ball of smooth ganache atop a piece of genoise.  He kept saying \"he couldn't possibly finish it all\" as he CLEANED his plate. . this was my favorite dessert, too.  The pear/french toast dessert was not as well conceived as each component - it just didn't come together well but I loved the idea of brown butter ice cream!  The panna cotta was a little too tight for my liking but I loved the idea of the fennel fronds on the dessert. . .anyone who knows me knows that I have a personal vendetta on desserts with the ubiquitous mint leaves. . .. if it doesn't have mint in the dessert please for the love of Lenotre, leave off the mint leaves!  \n\nAll in all a great night - excellent food, deft service and happy friends.  \n\nStreet cred intact!", "author": "Lainie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-10-29", "description": "Four of us went to Salt House on Saturday night.  We sat at the communal table (which is smaller than the one at Town Hall, but which has a similar feel).  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is beautiful and well designed.  We certainly appreciated the rustic, steel, wood, brick and concrete materials and the follow-through on the serving dishes (milk jug for water, e.g.). For people who appreciate good architecture, Salt House will be a joy.\r\n\r\nAnd, then there is the food and drink.  Overall, I would say there are still some kinks to be worked out.  We had five appetizers, three of which were good. The other two need work and were too complex (perhaps too odd) for our palate.  The beets didn't work for us.  They were served roasted with cured salmon and horseradish sauce.  Very strange mix -- and the horseradish was overpowering while the salmon made us wonder \"why do these beets smell oddly like fish?\"\r\n\r\nThe sprimp (overly battered and fried) and green beans (which themselves were good, spicy and crisp) were served in an almost Indian (orange) curry sauce that was at once too milky and too flavorful for the beans.   The combination of flavors did not really work for us. The shrimp were covered in a heavy batter that left the shrimp feeling, well, shrimpy.  The green beans (prepared as they were) would be better served without the gloppy Indian curry sauce, in my view.\r\n\r\nWe liked the -- get this -- mixed nuts with honey and salt.  What is not to like?  (Also, not exactly the most difficult dish to prepare).  At $4, this should be at every table.\r\n\r\nThe quartered potato with spare rib gravy and Roquefort was quite good.  The potato was fried crispy with a bit of spare rib and spare rib jus and some Roquefort on top.  Hard to complain about good cheese and spare rib jus delivered on a potato.  This is the McDonald's approach:  start with a fried potato and add anything to it and it will taste good.\r\n\r\nThe spicy roasted (or broiled?) oysters were quite nice.  The oysters themselves were tasty and the spicy topping (with green chilies) was a good compliment with good flavor.  Some of the oysters were much more spicy than others, but in general this dish worked well; even the non-Oyster eater in our crowd enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nThe acme bread was, as always, good.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the wine list, I would give it a \"B\".  There was nothing to be excited about, though it did touch each key San Francisco base (organize the wine on some principle other than color and region; have some decent, under $50 bottles; have a few expensive bottles; throw in a curve ball or two for the guy looking for something unique).  No wine awards for this list because it simply isn't that interesting or unusual.  Prices were fine.  You can find a good bottle, but this isn't a \"wine restaurant\" -- the list is quite limited. \r\n\r\nThey also have a concept I have never seen before which is \"wine barrel\" wines, which they offer by the 8 oz, 12 oz or 24 oz serving out of the barrel.  I had never heard of the wineries and they did not carry vintages.  Seemed a bit pricey for garage wine -- if that is what it is.  We didn't try it.    \r\n\r\nOverall, I would say:  this place will be mobbed with the crowd that wants to try every new \"cool\" restaurant. The decor insures that.  The foodies will enjoy the experiment, but if they can't reduce the complexity and some of the odd pairings, many of the foodie crowd will likely give up on the place. Wine people will be bored and show up just once. Fortunately for the owners, there are enough people in this town who will like the decor and won't care about the food to keep it busy for the next year.", "author": "Greg T."}

Also, the bread they served with butter was delicious, and in an interesting form (like a log). For my main dish I got the morrocan chicken salad, which was alright. I feel like they may have been \"experimenting\" with the items on the \"dine about town\" menu, so they were not as great as some of the pricier options on the menu.

True to their word, SH did a major bombing over the holiday and there wasn't a heebie jeebie dance inducer in sight, and I looked hard to be sure I would be telling the truth in my follow up. Although my first lunch was only a week ago, I couldn't help ordering the same thing this week - delicious corn soup and a vegetarian spring vegetable ragout (not on the menu, just ask for a vegetarian entree) Again, both were wonderful. I also couldn't help asking for a side of the spicy potato chips - they are sooo amazing. My friend, who loved his burger last week (with gourmet cheese and a beautiful roasted tomato), got the duck this week and polished his plate clean. Apparently it was really good. :)  This week, we had time for dessert and we each ordered a warm chocolate cake (what I call 'melty cake') with cherries and pistachio ice cream . It was beyond perfect.  On both visits I really enjoyed the expertise of our servers, making astute recommendations on both wine and food based on what we were ordering and how we described our tastes. \n\nI also have to say I was not only impressed they caught my first review, immediately corrected the problem I described and invited me back, but they also handled the freebie with complete grace. We didn't have a single second of the awkwardness that can come with saying 'um, I'm not supposed to pay for lunch today' or some such. All the way around  the staff at this restaurant is well-organized, graceful and definitely concerned that their clientle has a great experience in their restaurant. \n\nI am looking forward to going back.\n\nUPDATE: I've received a wonderful PM from Salt House explaining they are bombing this coming week so no more heebie geebies! They've also offered a meal to apologize for my dancin'. Im very impressed with their customer service. I've given them one star back, and if the next meal is as great as the last pre-visitor, I'm  sure I will be giving them back the other as well.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nI'm really torn about what number of stars to give this one. \n\nWe had a wonderful lunch. The corn soup (veggie!) was extraordinary, and the vegetarian corn risotto thing the chef made for me was so fresh and yummy you wouldn't know it was a spontaneous creation to feed the veggie in the house. Service was warm, friendly and fun, and they have a great selection of house blends on the wine list. I like the Athena! We also shared the spicy potato chips that were sooo good, and I ate all the onion rings from my friend's burger plate. Total heaven.\n\nSo, seems like a 5 star no brainer right?\n\nWell, it was perfect up until the very end when I picked up my purse to go. There was a ROACH on it. My friend, being the chivalrous guy he is, attempted to brush it off, but then it ended up *in* my purse. Yup. I had a roach in my purse. \n\nSo, minus two stars for making me do the OMG THERES A ROACH IN MY PURSE heebie jeebie dance in the middle of a crowded restaurant.\n\nI need a drink now.", "author": "Lise L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-26", "description": "It's hard to walk down the streets of San Francisco without tripping over a good restaurant, and that's exactly what happened to us on the way back from some Commonwealth Club Yelp talk thingy. While walking to the parking lot we discovered Salt House. (Great parking lot right there, something like $10 for four hours. A steal compared to a lot of San Francisco lots.) The place looked inviting, so we wandered in.\n\nFor schlubs like us with no reservation, there was a half hour wait for a table (7:30pm on a Thursday), but they did have some first come, first serve seating at the bar, at a communal table (which looked pretty cool, if a bit cramped) and at the window.\n\nNow, when you think window seating, don't think romantic little tables in a prime spot, it's like they squeezed a shelf into the window behind the staircase leading up to their enticing looking upstairs area...you have to duck under the staircase to get to your seat, and once they found us another chair, we joined four other patrons also dining on the window \"shelf\".\n\nPlease don't think I'm complaining, it was kind of cool and the staff were really good about checking up on us and giving us good service even though they had to squeeze under the stairs and contort themselves to wait on us from behind our backs. The only part I didn't like about this seating, as the only one there with a skirt on, was that our legs, probably my cootch, or whatever, were exposed under the table, through the window, and somewhat elevated, for all passers-by to gape at. A tablecloth or some sort of window covering for the area below the shelf would be a nice touch. Who knows, maybe they feel it makes the place look more inviting? (It may depend on what exactly is being exposed there, and who your target audience is. And, it didn't make me feel any better when some jerk on his parked moped across the street turned on his high-power headlight, pointed it at the restaurant and just left it there for about five minutes.)\n\nOh yeah, and we had some food! That's why I'm writing a review, and probably why you're reading it.\n\nI was worried when we first got the menu. The wine list looked very promising, but the short-ish menu had NO vegetarian entrees. No worries, though...they made me a special vegetarian entree including \"the vegetables they have that day with a starch\". The starch was barley, which I love, and my dish was very creamy and delicious. I tried to tell myself that the creaminess was from the barley, but it may just have been cooked in a crapload of butter. It was topped with some curly greens which I would normally just push aside, but they had a tasty, lemoney vinegarette on them that made me want to eat every bit of food on my plate (which I don't normally do. No, really!)\n\nWe also had some delicious poutine, although of course I asked for the gravy to be on the side, so technically it wasn't really poutine any more. There were also some tasty, tasty olives that were highly seasoned with something like lime, chili and rosemary (or was it thyme?) and my bf had the lamb which he said was quite good.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple turnovers with rum raisin ice cream. It tasted like a little slice of Thanksgiving, totally delicious! The rum raisins make it seem like you have a bit of apple AND a bit of mincemeat. The cheese course was also a nice surprise...I ordered the sheep camembert for $6 and because of the price I was expecting what I've had at other restaurants; a miniscule portion of cheese with a tiny garnish on a huge plate (I'm looking at you, Marche in Menlo Park) but instead received two nice little wedges along with some seasoned, croutoned bread slices.\n\nThis restaurant reminds me of why we go to so much trouble to go eat in San Francisco sometimes. They got everything right, from the service to the perfectly portioned and seasoned, interesting menu items and awesome wine list. Even the price is competitive for the food/ambiance/location. \n\nI have no hesitation in giving this restaurant five stars based on MY experience here, however I thought I'd mention that the noise level is a bit high (it didn't bother my bf, though) and the people seated to one side of us arrived some time before us but didn't receive their entrees until we were having dessert. They didn't seem too put out about whatever the problem was, though...their server brought them a couple complementary bowls of soup to make up for the wait and they slurped up every last drop.\n\nNext Commonwealth Club event, I have a feeling we'll be back here again. Maybe...with a reservation even.", "author": "Laura 'jinx.tv' K."}

We offered to pay for the purse and provided our contact information on the spot.  The guys at the table were very gracious and we hoped the incident would end at that.  Unfortunately that was not the case.\n\nWhen marinmezz got back to her table, she stood up and yelled \"Who the  #@!* spilled wine on my bag!\".... We again apologized and explained the situation, but it seemed to do no good.  The owner tried to help and took her over to the bar area to talk with her, but she was having none of it.  When she got back to her table, she continued to make snide comments about \"how rude and careless\" we were and that we had better learn manners.  We tried to apologize yet again and kept saying it was a mistake, and she replied \"the only mistake was you being born.\"\n\nI had it at that point and even offered to write her a check on the spot to please put this behind us, but she would not calm down.  At that point, the owner came back and asked their group to leave.  We were surprised, but grateful.  The bag was not a family heirloom, nor did she pay thousands of dollars.  I understand her being upset, but she took it to quite the extreme.\n\nThe staff apologized to us and the other diners.  The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and we were happy to go back to our meal.  The biggest surprise of the evening was a good one -- Salt House comped our entire meal... everything was on the house.  Of course we left a generous tip and will certainly be back with more friends... and no spilled wine!\n\nThank you to a great staff and co-owner Doug Washington... truly great customer service.

Drunkenness under the stairs. \n\nJ. and I were going to go to John Colins for drinks, but I showed up first and grouchy and was in no mood for the office stiffs that were milling aimlessly around the place. (Mind you, I too am technically an office stiff. But these folks were extra stiff.) So I left J. a message telling her to call me when she was on her way and I'd let her know where I landed. \n\nNext came a frustrating stroll around SOMA in search of a bar that wasn't too over-the-top anything (crowded, expensive, pretentious, divey). I was looking for middle of the road and let me tell you I was walking in aimless figure eights between Mission and Folsom and Fremont and 4th and getting no boozy love and getting grumpier. \n\nSo Jessica called and suggested Salt House. We'd been there once before, and we had a great time, but it was also our third stop on a Wednesday night bender, so the details are a little fuzzy. I remember a friendly bartender and a pork belly appetizer that was better than bacon. \n\nThis time, we arrived and sat in an awkward but very cozy spot at the low counter in the front window under the stairs that lead to nowhere, presently, but will eventually lead to a little mezzanine area. Our waitress had to duck to accommodate us and we worried for her noggin. But she was incredibly friendly and gracious, she checked in with us regularly despite our hidden spot under the stairs and kept us in gin and wine to our hearts' content. \n\nWe shared two appetizers, the yellow fin tuna tartar with roasted beets and candied hazelnuts. A truly weird and unexpected combination, but it was delicious and full of pleasing textures. We also shared the asparagus salad with smoked trout that was very good. Though it was a little stingy on the trout, but not so much to make a fuss. \n\nIn all, we spent almost three hours there, mostly wining, but also dining, and we had a fabulous time. I will make a point to go back for the full experience soon and hope I won't have the bad luck that others seem to with the mediocre service and food.", "author": "Sage R."}

The menu was simple, maybe in the future they will add more items?  I chose the putin appetizer which was a dish of thick cut potatoes baked with cheese and then drenched in a short rib sauce.  It was awesome!  K had the preserved tomato tart which had a nice tangy sweetness.

Some sort of fried crispy critter mixed in with the sweet crab and unknown greens, but not enough salt.  Seems the frank and beans got some of the salt destined for the crab salad.  Good, but a little bland.\n\nEntrees ordered were the seared scallops and chicken.  The problem was the scallops arrived with a duck cassoulet.  The waiter noticed this within a minute of it being placed on the table, but didn't take it away.  Another server asked if everything was OK and when I mentioned I had ordered the chicken, not the duck, he said OK, but didn't take the plate.  Our waiter finally came back after 5 minutes, said the chicken was on its way and suggested we go ahead and eat the duck nonetheless.  So we did.  It was ok.\n\nThe chicken was far better.  Very tender pieces of breast wrapped in crispy skin, served with a pepperoni- and fingerling potato mix.  The potatos were topped with arugula.  Very nice, but, after sharing two appetizers and two entrees, there wasn't enough stomach room to enjoy.\n\nBiggest downfall?  It was *very* loud in there and the tables were very close together.  You had to move the tables in order to get in and out.  This may have led to the mix-up with plates, as the table next to ours had ordered the scallops and duck cassoulet.  Ooops.\n\nHopefully it'll be better nexttime.", "author": "Chris D."}

Miraculously, even at prime dinner time on a Friday night(!!) we were escorted to 2 seats along the window/counter. It was a tad tight in feeling, tho' we were lucky to get seats immediately. The place was full to capacity and it seemed like \"Date Night\".\n\nThe waitress brought our glasses of wine quickly and we were given a portion of baguette wrapped in a piece of brown paper (are they trying to be rustic??). Water was filtered tap, served in what looked like a former milk bottle (cute. recycled. eco-friendly. I get it)...what I didn't quite grasp was the pirate/skull & cross bones on the bottle...We looked over the menu and saw that the price range is pretty steep. We really only wanted some dinner, not a big production, so we ordered entrees only. Stuart ordered the lamb shank which he declared to be cooked perfectly. I ordered the petrale sole which proved to be delicious. The \"shrimp jus\" served with the sole was so-so. The shrimp tasted as tho' they were on their last legs, so to speak. Everything else was exceptional. We had to ask for more water as well as a bit more bread. Desserts looked very heavy and none of them seemed compelling to us. If we had ordered anything, most likely it would have been a sheep's' milk  cheese plate. We passed as we were both full. The portions are generous.\n\nI'm conflicted about just how many stars to give. The food was good tho' not spectacular. The service was efficient, tho' by no means friendly or particularly engaging. The bathroom was a disaster (4 stalls with only 1 clean & functioning toilet...come on!)...so I am being generous by giving 4 stars. When asked what he thought, Stuart felt 3 stars would be appropriate. I'm left with the sense that it is another expensive destination date spot, or a place for tourists or the Bridge n' Tunnel crowd. No complaints about the food, but for the amount of $$ spent, I would expect the auxiliary amenities to be stellar. Still, I would return for a drink & appetizer sometime.", "author": "Suzanne F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-11", "description": "Here is yet another circumstance wherein I wish Yelp offered .5 star-ranking options.\n\nEntering Salt House, the first thing I notice is the slanted mirror above the bar, the low-hanging wood plank strung up by chains to keep the acoustics more manageable, and the warm red brick walls which hold the delicate light streaming in from corner windows in a playful yet exciting dance. \n\nOur second time in, the Texan and I sat in the coveted corner spot of the bar, between the host's station and the giant steel pillar, behind which rested a large stack of corrugated cardboard coasters with \"Salt House\" imprinted in red in on the bottom right corner. We came in after a long day of drinking wine and eating food whose preparation we'd witnessed during Two's Saturday afternoon cooking class. Which reminds me, I need to update my review of Two after Saturday's mind-blowing event.\n\nAdmittedly, we were still slightly drunk (even after a two-hour wine-influenced break, or shall I say \"break-down,\" which tends to come from walking down the street with someone you're just starting to fall for, unsure of the other's feelings about you, and so you just have to ask, but you forgot you were drunk, so it tends to come out all wrong), so my descriptions come from the annuls of something so primal that it would be impossible to forget. Ps- that's a disclaimer for any inaccuracies, particularly where the wine is concerned...\n\nRuari, amazing bartender of the evening (and of many more in the future, I do hope), offered us tastings of a few wine varietals so that we could make sure we got just what we wanted. Starting off with (if memory serves; the image of the bottle is much  more clear than the name, sadly) a glass of Pinot from Alfaro Family Vineyards in Santa Cruz, we snacked on slightly sweet and delicately crunchy pickled vegetables. The hama-hama oysters slid down with a fruitiness that was masked a little too heavily by the amount of shallots I added; next time, I think just a little lemon will do. We moved on to the crispy shrimp, which were four large shrimp battered in tempura and set over chopped green beans with serrano ham; the saltiness helped carry the deep fatty flavors of pork and fried goodness across the palate, with a fiery bite at the finish. The merguez sausages were small and fell apart like loosely packed feta, and the chickpeas were just on the right side of al dente-- any more firm and I would have found them too dry. Still hungry, we shared the seared yellowfin tuna: an opera of delight: an alto of glorious firm yellowfin flesh kept steady on the palate with the tenor of morels and wild asparagus. Complemented deeply by the wine, this dish is a celebration of life itself, and reminded me once again of how fortunate I am to be able to participate in the opportunities this fantastic city provides.\n\nMy usual problems with restaurants and service are the only thing that keep this restaurant from receiving 5 Yelp stars: The Texan's napkin fell to the floor and nobody picked it up; it shares a bathroom with a really lame dance club, so there are way too many hoochie mamas in a dark, danky restroom; it's laid out so that it feels impossible to move (I like the illusion, at least, of space while dining, though I get that they're using natural light to compensate for it).\n\nOverall, an amazing, if pricey, experience. I'd say at least $50 per person, but to get the most out of your time and money, make sure you ask your server for his/her recommendations. Thanks again to Ruari, a most awesome bartender!!", "author": "Molly A."}

I realize that it's a variation on a Canadian specialty, but what stoner came up with that combo?  My husband is already craving it again the next day, but I can't say that I am.  The olives were good, but a really large portion, and too many for 2 people.  I think they should offer a 1/2 portion for $3.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-18", "description": "Once again, our good friends at NorCal made their usual 6:30am rounds, waking us up in the process (can't you bastards be a little more quiet on a holiday?), so while the wife was stuck working on this gloriously rainy San Francisco holiday, I figured it was a great time to catch up on, like, 8 extra hours of sleep. Of course, a couple of my clients had other ideas, and my CrackBerry got me out of bed for good about 8:30. So I figured I'd be a good hubby and meet the wife for lunch in the FiDi.\n\nWe chose Salt House for 3 reasons: First, a serious foodie friend of mine RAVED about the joint when it opened, Second, it's right around the corner from the wife's office, and Third, they were serving a price fixe lunch as part of the SF Dine About Town. To my delight, I was able to score an 11:45am reservation on Open Table around 9ish, and set out into the now sunny SF morning (seriously, is Mother Nature battling PMS or something?!?) to catch the Muni limo to head downtown.\n\nWe walked in around 11:50, and the place was empty. I guess that's par for the course on a holiday, as most of my mates were still up in Tahoe themselves for the long weekend. It did start to pick up around 12:30, but there were still plenty of free tables when we left around 1. To their credit, both our hostess and waiter went out of their way to tell the wife and I about the D.A.T. special, and our friendly waiter did not at all make us feel out of place (read: ghetto) for taking advantage of the deal like some places in town (I'm talking to you Ruth's Chris! Get over you're effin self!). Salt House kicks off every meal with fresh, crusty bread from the wonderful Acme Bread Co. in the Ferry Building with house-whipped butter, which for the carb-addicted like yours truly made a wonderful starter in and of itself. As part of the price fixe menu, I had the pork pozole, a hearty stew of braised pork shoulder with chickpeas, pickled carrots and onions, and jalapenos. The stew was absolutely phenomenal, with the succulent pork melting in your mouth as the chickpeas exploded with flavor with each and every bite. The charming gay couple next to us both ordered the same, and I overheard one of them mentioning that he detected the flavor of fresh saffron in the complex broth. I devoured the entire bowl, and even though the portion was more than generous for lunch, the pozole was so delicious I was left craving seconds. The wife had the Salt House burger, an expertly cooked patty of pure perfection topped with cheddar cheese and onion straws served on a fresh Acme Bread roll. The burger was so juicy, my wife literally had juices running down BOTH her arms! She said it was definitely one of the best burgers she's had in the FiDi, hands down. The burger is not served with fries, which I guess is all the better if you order the famous poutine as an app. It wasn't offered on the price fixe menu, and as we took it a little easy on the drinking yesterday, we decided to pass for now, but will definitely be back after a few happy hour pints to give the poutine a try.\n\nThe price fixe lunch was served with only 1 choice, the Meyer Lemon panna cotta, for dessert. I decided to pass as I'm not big on sweets in the middle of the day, but wifey really enjoyed the subtly sweet vanilla custard, which was topped with fragrant candied Meyer lemons and served in a pool of raspberry sauce. Salt House has a decent wine and beer list, with Trumer Pils, Anchor Steam, Dogfish Head IPA and Widmer Hefeweizen on tap. Our tab came out to $67 including drinks and tip, not too bad for a place that on a normal weekday is filled with power lunchers with expense accounts and the like. All told, the Salt House is a solid FiDi joint that is worth the little splurge. We'll definitely be back the next time my clients decide that I don't deserve a day off during the week.", "author": "Michael T."}

This is the place you can eat at and still afford wine, as much or as little as you like without the need to even think about your AmEx Black card.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-04", "description": "For the past 5 years, a few of us who used to work together get together for dinner out. We try for every month (doesn't always happen) and take turns choosing where to dine. This month it was at Salt House. We originally had a reservation for 6 but our smaller party of 4 arrived a little early and fortunately were seated within minutes. That was a plus. Service for water and wine was good - we got a couple recs and she gave us time to look at the menu. I am 5 months pregnant so I just went with the white house blend - 6 oz for $6. I drank about 2oz of it (just wanted a taste) and the others finished the rest. \n\nWe started with the crispy shrimps - very tasty breaded shrimps over spicy green beans and the Poutine - thicker fries drizzled with cheese, then they pour some gravy on them at your table. Everyone loved these 2 dishes! The others - baked oysters which I am not a fan of and the Calamari - one large tube stuffed atop a bowl of tentacles and diced accoutrements (I remember the garbanzos as I only tried these non-squid bits. It could have been good but just wasn't appetizing to me). We were mixed on the apps.\n\nDinner. We usually clean our plates and sample what the others ordered. One ordered the steak ($30) medium and it came out medium rare at most. He ate around the edges of some pieces and overall most of the dish was uneaten. One ordered the tuna ($28) and got a gristly piece. He was trying to cut through it to much disappointment. One ordered the Sole and thought it was good - everything was cooked right and so she got to enjoy her dinner and ate most of it. Upon ordering the salmon, I was asked how I wanted it cooked. I have only been asked this once before - usually I like my salmon cooked but not dry. I guess I could have said that but I was put off by the question thinking I had to answer it like ordering meat. She asked if Med Rare was ok, and being pregnant, I said at least Medium, thinking it would be ok and more cooked than not. When my fish arrived, it was pretty rare, like seared because it was mushy and raw pretty much all the way through. I had a couple bites and gave a huge raw piece from the middle to the steak eater. As I picked through it and got others to try it, everyone noticed how raw it really was. After much hesitation I sent the half piece back on a small plate to be cooked more. By the time it returned about 10 mins later (in a smaller dish on a new bed of sides, everyone had pretty much finished their dinner (or what they wanted of it) and I was practically eating alone. I had a couple more bites and decided that I wasn't into any more for the evening, I would take it home. \n\nWhen the server came around, I compared a raw piece left on my friend's plate to a cooked piece and just asked out of curiosity about the differences in cooking temp. She seemed a bit defensive but I was merely asking for information - again, not used to that question for salmon. She said the piece was Med Rare, why? I reminded her that I asked for at least Medium. Anyway, that was for info only - she didn't cook it, the kitchen did. But how did she write up the order?\n\nThe busser came around and I asked for my fish to go, just as my friend was saying just I should just eat it. I said no, I would just take it home, so my friend then asks for a box. The busser took some dishes and came back for the rest, getting mine last. I did not remind him that I still wanted to take it home but that it was ready for him to take. I think there was a language barrier so I really should have?\n\nThe chocolate dessert was tasty and at least we could end the meal sharing that.\n\nWhen the server brought our bill, she mentioned that she took the salmon off. That was appreciated. Even splitting the bill 4 ways and somehow including a 20% tip, each share was still $58. I expressed I didn't feel good about this bill, and everyone else said they didn't really eat theirs either. Point. Way too much $$ for such a disappointing meal from the kitchen. Most dishes were over salted and no one cleaned their plate which was definitely a first.\n\nMy leftover salmon??? I really thought the busser would remember that we asked for my salmon to go but it never appeared back at our table. It was about half of my $25 salmon with pretty much all the new mini diced sides and puree that I was looking forward to giving the chance the next day. Even though it got comped, I am still entitled to it right? And especially since it still seemed like I paid too much money for it.", "author": "Kristi M."}

There are not a ton of great restaurants located near Golden Gate University, but this chic joint, quietly nuzzled on Mission Street which is always busy, is a reprieve for the selective foodie. Prices aren't cheap, but you will be happy with pretty much anything on the menu. I have been here for lunch and dinner for work, and I was very happy with everything I ordered. \n\nFor lunch, I had the oyster po' boy (and this sandwich is nothing but rich). It might have been a special, because I don't recall it being on the regular lunch menu, but it was awesome and bursting with flavor. Then again, it was fried, so what wouldn't be good?\n\nOn other occasions, I had dinner. I had a few glasses of sauvignon blanc and was very pleased. Not only that, the olive snack was great. Then again, who couldn't love a briney melange of meaty olives?! For my entree, I had the Petrale Sole. The portion, the texture, the flavor, and the presentation were all spot-on. I recommend you trying this dish if it's your first time, and you will be happy you did.\n\nThe only draw back is that it is quite small in there. They have this seating area near the window underneath the stairs and you feel trapped. It is hard for waiters to deliver food and wine to you, especially if it's busy. Try to get them not to sit you there if it's just two of you. Unless you are desperate and famished, I would opt for the wait. \n\nAll in all, Salt House is a great, accidental find in SF.", "author": "Anna B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-04-18", "description": "Reviewed by Scottie D! Edited by KenMac.\nDate: 3/21/07\n\nI've wanted to try the Salt House for a few months and when a friend said they wanted to try it as well I no longer had any excuses. Though I wish I did.  I've been to Town Hall and since \"the Jackasses\" from Town Hall opened this location I expected a similar experience.  Our meal began with a couple of small plates.  My dining partner started with the Crispy Shrimp w/ Spicy Greens, Serrano Ham and Almonds ($13). This dish was simply overpowered by the heat of the greens/ham/almond mixture the shrimp rested on.  I suggest ordering the greens as a side dish w/o shrimp. I ordered the Poutine (a Canadian dish similar to gravy fries) w/ Short Rib Gravy and Fontina cheese ($10)  I was looking forward to this dish because crispy potatoes covered in gravy is one of my comfort foods. Unfortunately, the potatoes were limp, just like Bob Dole before taking a tab of Viagra. Needless to say anytime one eats at a restaurant and you start comparing your small plates to erectile dysfunction it does not bode well for their future.\n\nOn to the on trays, I mean entres. My friend had the Fresh Dungeness Crab Salad ($21) I have to say considering the outrageous price one pays for crab in this town, this was a bargain! The crab was piled high and deep, so much so that my foodie friend couldn't finish it. Though, that may have been the result of too many pieces of bread dipped into the Short Rib Gravy.  I had the Roasted Pork \"Cubano\" Sandwich ($15) while the bread was toasted to perfection and the pork was flavorful, the remoulade that accompanied it was lackluster ultimately destroying what could have been the best \"Cubano\" sandwich I've had in this country! If I were to go back I would ask for the sauce they put on their Spicy Greens instead of the remoulade. \n\nMiscellaneous issues!\nFirst, be forewarned, if you've been to Town Hall then you know it can be quite loud. The Salt House is even louder. I imagine that the tall exposed ceilings plus the narrowness of the building itself amplifies the internal din to a cacophony of clangs/clutter and talking.  Our waiter was overly enthusiastic about clearing plates of food while we were still eating (extremely annoying).  Please note these comments are specific to a lunchtime meal and not dinner.\n\nI would recommend this place with the caveats explained above. The food, while searching for a place on the palette, is good!  Just remember it is very LOUD at lunch!\n\n\nAddendum: I returned to Salt House on 4/18/07 for lunch and while the counter staff was very knowledgeable, the food has taken a turn for the worse. I ordered the White Bean Soup ($9) the soup was creamy, yet bland. Perhaps a twist or two of cracked black pepper would have helped but I doubt it. I then had the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare w/ Bosc Pear and Red/Golden Beets ($14) which I regret to say was a horrible combination. The tuna was flesh was a milky pink not the deep red that one sees in better restaurants in the city (think Aqua, Michael Mina). I've never tasted anything like this anywhere. I'm a huge fan of all things tuna but I would NEVER eat this dish ever again.\n\nI no longer recommend this restaurant.  It is all talk and no substance!!!!", "author": "D Scott D."}

Foie gras, squid, steak, petrale sole, and chicken were outstanding!!  I don't often order chicken out as it's a staple at home, it was a staff favorite so I gave it a whirl.  It was delicious!

He ordered the \"soup and sandwich\" which is an ahi tuna sandwich with a small bowl of chilled pea soup. He really enjoyed it. I had the Cubano sandwich and I loved it. We started with the Poutine that I'm sure I would love after hours of drinking but that was not the case today. I don't like the cold atmosphere, kind of had enough of the industrial look.

I had the lamb ribs with tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, and Israeli cous cous and it was just perfect-- the meat fell apart in my mouth, it was so tender. Good lord... I also love the decor- rustic chic, exposed beams, Edison bulbs, lots of wood.  I took off one star b/c the tables are too small AND, there's nowhere to hang one's handbag.  That may seem like a petty grievance, but if you're like me and you work very hard for your ONE nice bag, you really don't want to put it on the floor when you go out to eat, and if you can't even hang it off the chair (they have rounded backs), then you're left with the option of putting your bag on your lap and then covering it with the napkin. Again, it may seem petty, but things like this do affect the experience-- it's just kind of a pain in the ass.

Also, love the decor. Great lamps, very cool feel.\nWhen we first got there we almost had no where to stand it was so packed, but the crowdedness actually was a good thing because it made you feel like you were in a fun spot. We were saying we're over the frumpy austere places - on a Friday night out with friends a loud crazy place is kind of what you're after. So, cocktails in hand, the night was off to a good start.\nAnd then we waited, starving, and waited. They need to maybe book more time for each party to stay at a table - because I know it's not a restaurant's fault if a group won't leave, but also, when you show up for your reservation, you want your table to be ready!\nOn to the food. It was good! Poutin - excellent. Seriously good drinking food. Crispy fries, cheese, gravy = goodness. Oysters - fresh and tasty with an excellent mignonette. Merguez - good. Loaf of bread wrapped in brown paper - cute touch. And the mains...servings weren't massive but still I don't think one bite was left on the table so that's a good sign. Between us we had the steak, both duck entrees and the striped bass. Only tried the duck leg which was perfect - crispy outside skin cooked to perfection. \nA good time fo sho! Good spot to go with friends for a night out. Probably a bit pricey for what you get? We paid our initial bar bill separately, so with 2 drinks a head, three shared starters and 4 entrees, including tip it came to I think $65 a head. Not bad but not great either. I definitely like the new trend toward cheaper entrees these days so if this place dropped their entree prices a couple bucks I think I'd definitely like them even more!\nGive it a go though - and try the poutin! :-)", "author": "Sarah R."}

It lacks the wow factor of Town Hall and the cool factor of Anchor&Hope, both of which I have been to many times, and it is quite over-priced for what it is as well. I do love the fries and have had several very nice if not memorable meals here, but nothing that makes me want to write a recommendation on Yelp.  I would highly recommend it as an after work meeting spot on anything other than a Thursday or Friday night (it gets PACKED in the tiny bar) and it is wonderful business lunch spot - airy and chic, and the service is pleasant, usually.  But something, maybe it is the somewhat inconsistent menu (there is a tuna sandwich and a fancy sole dish on same menu, just sort of all over the place in choices - which actually some people may like...) that leaves me a little cold and wondering what creators were going for - is it a fancy bistro? is it great bar, that happens to have ok food? is it fine dining? It tries to be all these things and does not quite work.

I'd heard so many good things about Salt House and finally went today for lunch. My conclusion: overpriced mediocre food that is presented nicely. 2.5 Stars.\n\nMy first thought upon reading the lunch menu: Not enough selections in the main entrees.\n\nI decided to go with the Grilled Steak Sandwich (with carmelized onions & chimichurri) and Crazy Chips. Our server was helpful in explaining to me that Chimichurri is a sauce that they put on the steak made from different chopped up herbs (almost reminded me a bit of a variation of a pesto). The sandwich was greeeaasy. So greasy that I almost felt I shouldn't eat it. It tasted okay, but it was nothing special or impressive. Aside from the Chimichurri that they put on the steak, it was almost a bit bland. The Crazy Chips (which I think are made from sweet potato) were so oily and greasy that I couldn't even eat them at all. I had a few to taste and left all the rest. I only ate the sandwich because I was hungry and didn't want to waste. I am definitely no health freak and love unhealthy and some greased up food, so if I think it's way too greasy, that should say something. BLEH, I feel like I just poured some oil down my throat. I need to detoxify. NOW.\n\nThe steak sandwich & a glass of rose plus tax & tip = $30 for a lunch not enjoyed and obligingly eaten. My co-worker ordered the Crispy Shrimp appetizer, which had a great presentation, but I don't know how it tasted.\n\nI did like the interior and feel of the restaurant, and their service was friendly, so those were both pluses. I would only give Salt House a second chance to try their dinner, which MUST be better given all the talk about this place, but I would hope it's not as greasy as lunch was today.

Meh...!  I love Houston's, but I'm getting tired of their never-changing menu, so I sugget we try somewhere else.  Someone pops up with Salt House.  Never heard of it, but it never hurts to try. \n\n We, party of three, roll in without reservations on a Saturday evening, so we're not too hopeful, but we luck out, and the hostess sits us upstairs.  Industrial/chic decor greets us mit der requisite bare-brick walls, hard (and wobbly) chairs,  and hello-neighbor-ack!-but-your-table-is-right-next-to-mine seating, but at least we're away from the noisy atmosphere down below.  Friend starts with a glass of waiter-recommended white which my picky-friend raves about, so we're off to a good start.  I notice that the ppl next to us who are seated after us get bread and we don't.  We flag down someone who gets us bread.  This seems to be an unfortunate pattern which continued throughout the meal.  Stuff came if you asked for it, but you had to ask for it.  Regular water initially.  We asked for Voss water.  Voss water shows up 10 minutes later, and no, the joint wasn't -that-busy!  \n\nBriefly, I order the Goat shank, friend the Ahi tuna, and his son, the Gnocci.  Raves all around!  Definitely good stuff.  To me, food is either good or not.  No point in going into detail.  Just go and try it.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nOh yeah, one final gripe......our server changed three times.  Why...?  Heck if I know, but this might have been one of the reasons for the slow service.

The communal table was crowded, as were the bar and tables.  When we sat down I think there was one table open which was quickly filled.  We ordered almost all of the starters on the menu and glasses of wine.  We tried the poutine, (the Montreal gravy and fry dish), homemade pickled vegetables, crab salad, roasted beets with ahi, foie gras with marmalade, the crispy shrimp and a few other dishes I cannot recall.  The crispy shrimp and foie gras dishes were my favorites.  \n\nService was prompt and unobtrusive, all of the food was delicious but the bill was higher than I'd have thought, at almost $200 for the four of us.  Looking back though, we did have 6 glasses of wine, 2 desserts and probably 6 dishes (all appetizers).  We were definitely full upon our on-time departure and enjoyed our meal.

The ambience created a perfect setting for celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  i set it all up over the phone, and the staff did a wonderful job making it happen, and so smoothly at that.  Our first visit left us with no memorable meals, unfortunately, and my dishes were a bit too salty (no pun intended) for my tastes.  I'll give it another try sometime, but four stars until then.", "author": "Andrea U."}

What a fun museum, worth the trip from the East Bay.  We then stopped off at SFMOMA for a quick tour of their latest exhibits before we headed over to the Salt House.  The place was jammed!  Luckily we had thought about that possibility and had made reservations. \nWe were a few minutes early, so started our date with a glass of wine at the bar.  That was a bit of a tight fit.  The table closest to the bar was full of folks so that their chairs made it difficult to navigate, however we managed.  We barely got a sip of wine before our table was ready.\nI had the burger and my husband had chili with grilled cheese.  Both dishes were excellent.  The service was very friendly.  The wine was good.  What more can you ask for...dessert!  Yup, we shared the brioche pudding.  YUMMY!  We will definitely go back to the Salt House.", "author": "Carol H."}

The bread looked very interesting - like they just chopped off a tree branch - but it tasted great.\nMeal: My girlfriend and I both ordered the steak (I forget what they really called it on the menu - something fancy tho). It was great - melted in your mouth with the delectable sauce . + local IPA (very potent).\nAfter-meal: ordered a specialty drink: the salty dog. (Grapefruit flavor, salt, vodka) - sounded interesting, but not our style. Sort of like a punch in the mouth. The bartender, however, was very gracious and recognized that we weren't falling in love with the drink (even though we didn't say it out right). So he said he would try again with something we would like. We picked the Kentucky Apple, but again, found the bourbon to linger a bit too long like a drunken college girl who just hurled all over your bathroom and passed out on your couch. So no go there.... but good on him for trying. Guess it just wasn't our night in picking the drinks we liked, but for what they were, im sure it is an aquired taste for some. \nOverall, price was a bit steep, but i don't mind paying well for the good/attentive service and tasty food we received. \n\nI would definitely go there again, as it does offer a lesson in food terminology on the menu that you don't run into very often unless you only eat in the SOMA.", "author": "Tania E."}

Not too sweet, light and delicious.  \n\nThe food was pretty good and the staff were fabulous.  We had a very helpful, charming woman who was really good about my long embarrassing list of allergies.  I had the pork belly - a little dry but still a wonderful combination with asparagus etc.  I then had the new york steak with white beans - great piece of meat and a good textural and flavour combination.  The desert was half great and half not so great (it was ice cream sandwich, served in three separate components).  The marshmallow was divine - light, fluffy crispy - and they also gave me some meringue sticks to taste - the best I've ever had - the crispy/chewy/soft combination of the best pavlova shell but in a toothpick size.  Apparently the ice cream cake was average but the lemon tart got high marks.\n\nThey should redo their website - it's slow and the menu must be an old one because only the main we had was listed.\n\nWe went on a Monday night and it was packed.

Our waiter was very attentive.  Came for the first time through the Dine About Town promo and our table ordered whatever was offered: 2 courses for $17.95-an appetizer plus one main dish.  You had only two options each.  I had the duck terrine and it was fine.  The bread that came with the terrine was too dry and broke apart every time you chewed into it. The marmalade was in one quadrant; the pickled vegetables in another; the terrine in the third; and the bread, in the fourth.  I then had the chicken salad and had two bites and that was it.  Too many ingredients, not enough flavor, not enough greens.  Someone else ordered the seafood dish and he had no complaints but it didn't look that great, way too many mussels.  The soup looked appetizing and the other friend enjoyed it but wasn't impressed by it.  Just because this was a promo doesn't mean the quality of the food has to be shoddy.

This may be a totally unfair comment, because our dishes might have been cooking away under someone else's watchful eyes.

The best part of the meal was the entree. Both my date and I ordered fish (Halibut and Wild Bass). Both entrees were prepared perfectly. The fish were soft and tendered on the inside and slightly grilled and seasoned on the outside. Both dishes were accompanied by a medley of veggies, cooked to perfection. \n\nMy main gripes with the restaurant was the appetizer. We ordered Yellowtail sashimi, based on a recommendation from a Yelp user. Boy was that the worst choice EVER. First off, have you ever found bone in your sashimi? Not only was there bone in our sashimi, the fish did not taste all that fresh. On top of that, the lemon garnish was way over the top (perhaps to mask the age of the sashimi?). Now, imagine paying $14 for this dish and you have yourself the worst appetizer ever assembled. \n\nOverall the meal was delicious, barring the appetizer. If budget is a concern, prepare to spend easily $40 per person. The overall decor is quite nice and contemporary.

The locale has great ambiance, with its old wood floors, exposed structural beams, bar, loft and open kitchen. The one detracting aspect in this area is the disconnected bathrooms, which you get to by walking outside the restaurant through the back door.\n\nThe menu is interesting, but the performance does not deliver. The one highlight of our night was the crispy egg. It was a poached egg, crusted with panko, quickly deep fried, and served in a bed of lentils, bacon and frisee. It was also delicious. As you cut into the egg the still liquid yolk flows out and mixes with the lentils and bacon, while the fried panko crust adds a nice crunch. Others in my table had the tuna starter, which while not bad, was not remarkable in any way.\n\nFor my entre I ordered the sole, of which I have little to say as it was bland and unmemorable. Other at the table had another fish and the lamb. Both commented that their dishes where overly salted. One of them stopped eating it half way through for this reason.\n\nWe then decided to try desserts. We ordered the mascarpone panna cotta and the cookie plate. The panna cotta was tasty, but I would be hard pressed to tell you there was mascarpone in it if the menu did not describe it that way. The cookie plate, once again, was unremarkable.\n\nTo finished off we ordered mint tea. This seemed to cap off an off night for the food.

Everything tasted good and salty but it just seemed to take forever to get to the table and some of it was cold upon arrival. The waitress was lack luster and seemed annoyed to be there. And that's really all I have to say about that.", "author": "Kerry W."}

Everything on the menu sounded good so the three of us grazed on 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. First the good stuff. The fried shrimp salad with green beans was wonderful, so tasty with the harissa dressing. I don't eat shrimp so the 4 shrimps were devoured by the others who commented on the great frying job. On the other hand, the poutine, french fries+gravy+cheese was good but the waitress poured the short rib gravy on the fries and in my opinion ruined them. Didn't like the gravy much less on what were once nice crunchy fries. Maybe next time we'd have them serve it on the side for dipping. The yellowtail tartare was excellent in taste but I was disappointed with the skill of the prep chef, all the dice were of different size and shape. Didn't effect the taste but I just expected a more skilled presentation. The pork chops were cooked excellently and were just delicious, so juicy and flavorful. The white polenta was $22 and not worth it. $22 bucks for mush? It was beautiful but was not tasty, the flavors of the mushrooms and other toppings didn't meld or compliment the bland polenta. The grana should have been grated so it could be in every bite instead of the small square sheets perched on top. On top of that the serving was really small. It's bad enough to be a vegetarian with so few menu choices but to starve as well? Would I go again? Yep.", "author": "bongo c."}

Always a safe bet, right? Boy were we wrong. We ordered poutin and the squid which took about 20 minutes to get to our table while our waitress fretted next to us with a blank stare and a...why am I here? stance. \nIn the time it took our appetizers to get to our table we should of polished off our cocktails and been ready for at least a glass of water (which didnt arrive til long after the apps did). But neither of us got past the first few painful sips. If I wanted a shot of tequila, I would of ordered a shot of tequila. You could taste nothing but the alcohol in the drink which, correct me if I'm wrong, should of tasted like honey/jalapeno/lime with a nice tange of tequila.\nSalt House did live up to one part of it's name. The salt encrusted on the fries which were doused in salty gravy could of flavored a whole stock pot of the blandest soup imaginable. The squid...well if I wanted one ounce of squid stuffed with a jumble of salty whateverthecooksneedtogetridoffastbeforeitgoesbadcauseIdidn'tknowwhatitwas inreality...I don't even know how to end this sentence.\nBland, salty and unappetizing.\nWe quickly paid our bill and left our still very full plates sitting at the table unable to bring ourselves to try any of the other unimaginative dishes on the menu.\n\nNeedless to say (but I will any way) this is one of the trio I will not be going back to.", "author": "Jude B."}

This is no exception, although I wasn't a huge fan of the greens they paired with it.\n\nScallops - probably the best appetizer we had, although the scallops were a tiny bit gritty.  The scallops were cooked to the perfect texture, and were paired with sausage.  \n\nSo, no sign of overwhelming saltiness yet!\n\nAs my entree, I had the steak, medium rare.  The steak was absolutely amazing!  Cooked properly, with a lovely crust - and just the right amount of salt to top it off!  The mushrooms were also very nice, cooked in a meaty broth, but I didn't really dig too much into the mushroom puree/sauce.  The steak was enough for me! :)\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful, and he paid the perfect amount of attention to us.  It is a bit loud in the restaurant, but it wasn't a problem for us.  :)  The bathroom is located outside the restaurant, which I find to be slightly strange, but whatever.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was great! \n\nI am afraid that I cannot comment too much on the dessert menu, but I did have a bit of the ice cream sandwiches - tasty!\n\nThe appetizers may be a tad overpriced, but the entree I had was totally worth it.  I would definitely go back for seconds.", "author": "Bithi C."}

We each had a glass of wine and were promptly seated at 5:30 as promised. As an app and main course, my date had the shrimp on a bed of greens and they were wonderful. I had the pork sirloin that was cooked to  perfection, being slightly pink in the center but extremely moist and tender. For dessert, we split the cheesecake with peanut brittle and orange marmalade.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "We dined here this last Friday for a good friends birthday party. We were a larger party but had made reservations an entire week in advance. Half of our party arrived fifteen minutes early and we proceeded to the communal table at the center of the restaurant to enjoy a few cocktails. My Sazerak was quickly made and well done, so bonus points to the bartender. I have to say that the placement of their very large communal table is very awkward, there was little to no room for the service staff to pass down a very busy corridor. I felt bad for the guests dinning at the low lying tables surrounding us as we often found ourselves having to step in-between tables to give room for passing dishes. \n    Roughly thirty minutes passed (meaning we were now fifteen minutes into our reservation) and our party had not entirely arrived. I let the host know to simply seat us whenever ready, I figured we would simply start ordering appetizers buying time for whoever was dragging. Another fifteen minutes passed before I had to inquire into our table. We were seated shortly thereafter but roughly forty-five minutes past our initial reservation time and by then all our guests had arrived. Here's where things went really sour. \n    We ordered two of their shellfish \"plateaus\" and a couple orders of the poutine. $40 for five or six oysters, several clams and three boiled shrimp is not a plateau, it's more like a \"mound of shellfish.\" So we burn though the shellfish and it takes another thirty or so minutes before the poutine arrives! Hold on a second, french fries, cheese and gravy. Albeit, the gravy was very tasty but unless you're stewing it to order, no one should ever have to wait that long for french fries. Then the long arduous wait for our entree began, after I asked the server to fire the food when the poutine arrived. What's the average fire time in this place, thirty minutes? So here we are again, sitting and waiting for our food. It arrives and, to be frank, is so so. Everything was plated beautifully and my girlfriend loved her chicken, after admitting that she would have found anything delicious after waiting over an hour and a half from arrival to entree, but my pork was chewy and obviously hadn't been brined long enough or at all. I had also asked for our friend to receive a shot at the end of dinner, since it was his birthday, which never arrived.\n   The extra star goes to the server and hostess who were both very sweet. The management compensated our corkage and bottle of wine, which was very much appreciated. Would I give them a second shot? The magic eight-ball says all signs point to no. Would I ever bring a large group of friends here again for a celebratory dinner? Snow balls chance in hell.", "author": "Essam K."}

I was alone so my initial preference was the bar but it was crowded so she suggested I sit in the window seats. Good call as I enjoyed watching the passing scene on Mission Street unfold - including a Paris Hilton wannabe negotiating with her X-Ray friends about which clubs to visit next. \n\nMy server was genuinely friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu - she really knew the wine list as well. The one wine question she couldn't answer was quickly solved by the friendly and expert wine director. Food highlights were:\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad - perfect tomatoes in a simple and elegant presentation. Run to Salt House today and enjoy these before the tomato season is over.\n\nYellow Fin Tuna Tartare - beautiful fish cooked perfectly.\n\nCrispy Shrimp - the combination of yellow and green beans with Serrano Ham and Shrimp was perfectly balanced.\n\nMarsanne Blend Wine - crisp and complex, the perfect accompaniment to each dish above. \n\nOK, so I've used the word \"perfect\" four times to describe three dishes and a glass of wine.

This is the first place in the States that I've heard serves the dish.  I rounded up a bunch of coworkers and went to Salt House during the DAT season.  The DAT menu was only okay so only about half of us ordered off of that.  We also ordered some poutines and sliders to share as appetizers.  Poutine was pretty good.  They used beef short rib gravy to fancy things up but at the end of the day it was still just fries with cheese and gravy.  Not even close to being worth the $11 per small portion.  My pork shoulder dish was pretty good because it came with some pickled vegetables that spiced up the dish and gave it a bit of a tangy offset to the smooth gravy.  Also, a coworker knew the general manager who then sent up a few desserts to try.  The chocolate one with almonds was by far my favorite!  I remember when the DAT lunch  menu used to come with 3 courses and they were usually kitchen highlights that would cause people to come back.  Now they've started cheaping out with 2 courses and sub-par items that are probably cheaper to make.  I think DAT's reputation is going to go down the tubes soon and people will stop trying restaurants under this pretense.  Most of the time I don't even order off the DAT menu anymore.  And I almost never walk out without spending at least double of what is expected.  In this case, my DAT lunch ended up costing $36, including the free desserts.  That and the service was ridiculously slow!  This place was definitely not worth that.  I think Town Hall is the only restaurant in this family that is worth the price point.  The other ones are just depending on its halo effect.  That being said, maybe I'm just a skeptic because I can get most of the same food down south that is just as good for just a fraction of the price.", "author": "Susan L."}

I arrived way before the rest of the group, sidled up to the bar and ordered the usual double. I couldn't help it, but I started to eavesdrop on the couple next to me.... It turns out they were both in town for the Macworld thing and making overtly flirtatious introductions. I tried really hard not to laugh but.... from what I gathered they had literally just met. (right there at the bar before I walked in) and this guy was on a mission! he was using every cheesy line known to man. The hilarious part was, this girl was taking it in like a starving man at an all-you-can-eat buffet in vegas at 3am. She was gazing at him with fascinated eyes, a huge cheerleader smile plastered to her face and doing a high pitched girly laugh. I was totally mesmerized at the whole scene unfolding.... Damn, and then my group showed up so I had to leave for our table. so sadly I'm not exactly sure how it all turned out....  but if I had to GUESS I would say it was probably wild monkey sex in one of their respective hotel rooms. So anyway.... back to the Salt House. I'm not shy about saying I'm definitely NOT a fan of its ugly step sister Town Hall, so I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing here. but surprisingly this place has a little more going on.

You can count me in as another fan of the Poutine dish--- yum! After indulging ourselves here we were in such an agreeable mood that we proceeded to have a little impromptu Monday night after party at DJ Hard Kaurs high rise wild party condo....complete with disco ball and turntables. haha!(ok, no disco ball but it sounded good) After drinking an entire bottle of Aqwa, the events of the night get a little fuzzy.... But it was an eventfully fun night and Salt House did not disappoint. a great after work drinks/dinner spot. *(and extra entertaining when there's a convention in town---make sure to get front row seats at the bar)", "author": "Michelle I."}

I have no complaints about the quality of the dinner.  If the rating were only on the food, I would give it 2 stars overall, 4 for just quality.  But first and foremost, the meals would be highly overpriced at HALF of what they charge.  The only thing that positively impressed me on my visit was their attention to detail concerning making sure you had all the right utensils (even though someone took the wrong fork after I finished my salad...) and folding your napkin for you when you go to the restroom.  And yes, you will likely need to visit the restroom at least once during your dinner, since they are EXTREMELY slow.  Bottom line: avoid this place.", "author": "Jon K."}

I'm expecting something savory, comforting yet exciting. That's what I got at Salt House. My non-yelp buddy and I headed over to this place after a fun time at the Yelp party at Harlot, but whew. Maybe a little too much fun involving gin? We needed food fast. We walked into Salt House and were seated right away. Granted it was late into the evening, but I love restaurants that stay open late. I also liked airy feel of the place. Maybe it was all the wood flooring? Maybe it was because it wasn't too crowded at the time were were there. Our waiter was totally accomodating and had a good sense of humor. We were tipsy and hungry--whoa! We had a fried potato appetizer. My friend had the seared tuna which was cooked just right with the right amount of seasoning. I had a lamb and veggies dish. I can't remember what was all in it (maybe I was a bit more than tipsy) but I remember the flavor of the gravy and how tender the meat was. Mmm...salt! I had my leftovers boxed up.

The folks that brought us Town Hall, just opened up this place late 2006.  I went there about two weeks after the opening and was totally blown away.  The service was spot on, and the food was delicious.  We ordered the sea bass and the roasted chicken.  The roasted chicken was pretty much crack for food-lovers and I think that I will not be ordering anything else from now on.  I am totally hooked.  Of course, that night I had ordered the Sea Bass and while equally good, I \"lost\" the dinner contest and was somewhat envious of my dinner guest since she had the entire chicken to enjoy.  As for dessert, they had this great apple galette which we modified with a scoop of their homemade pecan ice cream for a little a la mode action.  The waitress was more than happy to do this for us at no extra charge.  This is what its all about.  Atmosphere-wise, space is an old renovated printing press which is usually filled with business-types and students from the law school across the street.

It's located in the SOMA area, so it's easy for me to get to after work. The restaurant is amidst buildings that are under construction, so if you don't already know about it, it's unlikely that you'd come upon it. We got there at 6 on a Friday, without reservations. Big mistake, the place was packed. But no worries, we decided to sit by the window behind the stairs. The decor is kind of modern/ industrial. The lighting is dim, but there are candles. Not terribly loud considering the amount of people. The reisling I had was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was as good as the reisling at the W, but definitely a nice wine. We ordered poutine, a french canadian dish consisting of french fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The potatoes were crisp, the cheese curds creamy, and the gravy was not too strong and meaty, although there were some chunks of meat in it, I just avoided them since I don't really like beef that much.

I thought the service was great, a little snobby, but very very attentive and informative.  Our server described the preparation of foie gras torchon, which is supposedly the most difficult to prepare.  We'd only had pate style and seared style... my fav being seared. so in the end, it's like salty (brined)  foie gras and with a pate like consistency.  The small plates were a lot more pleasing than the entrees.  We ordered a smorgasboard of food.  Oysters were fresh and tastey, soup was delicious and they were sweet enough to split it into 3 bowls for us, pork belly was just ok.  I'd definitely be down with coming back here.

When we got there the hostess had given away our table, but we were 12 minutes late, so I guess that is the risk you run when you insist on seeking out street parking.  I had the Voyageur cocktail which was a bit tongue-puckering at first, but it improved as I kept sipping.  We were seated soon after we ordered our drinks and started things off with poutine.  I had tried this dish in Montreal, and Salt House's version was far superior.  Crispy fries, melty cheese, and glorious gravy.  Mmmm.  Then I had the crispy shrimp which were extra-scrumptious shrimp tempura with an overly-hammed serano/almond/haricots verts/greens concoction.  The greens were odd (parsely?  what exactly was that stuff?) but the beans, almonds, and some of the ham was good.  My bf had the duck confit and it was tasty, albeit a trifle overdone.  Dessert was the big downer here.  We did not choose wisely!  We had the coconut- pineapple-dacquoise-granita-brittle dealy and it was lame.  I regret that I did not just get the chocolate bar (I avoided due to previous Yelp postings, but it sure looked chocolatey and delicious when the woman next to me ordered it!).

I have to admit, the food is good. But what I can't get over is that this place feels like just another trend. The staff is clad in jeans that don't seem mesh with their button-down shirts. The tables are bare and they serve bread on what looked like a brown paper bag, which I guess is their attempt at creating a rustic, comfortable feel.

I take a night class across the street so I am always without my hubby who is my main restaurant buddy, and I was waiting to get him there with me.  The other day I read the reviews and saw the crispy egg description which pushed me over the edge.  I went with about an hour before my class.  I sat at the \"community table,\" which was a bit cramped in terms of space, but entertaining.  The crispy egg was fantastic - I am an egg fan, and it was a soft cooked egg, rolled in something crispy and fried (?) and it came on a lovely bed of English Peas which are a favorite of mine as well and had two small cuts of bacon on the side which were smothered in a wonderful brown sauce.  Usually I can tell to a pretty good degree what things are but I have no idea what was in that sauce - I would almost guess a classic brown gravy with a bit of soy but that is just taking a wild stab at it.  Anyway, it was tasty.  I would have been fine with that alone but I was so excited to be there I had ordered the dayboat scallops as well, which were delicious.  The scallops were pan seared in butter and delicious.  They came with manilla clams which were good and a parsnip bacon tourine that was quite tasty.  The whole thing was on a chard mix, so pretty much all the food groups were covered and nicely, I might add.  The bar was tempting but as I had to be alert I had a cappucino, which was really good.  All in all I liked the busy and eclectic atmosphere, the food and my waiter.  My one complaint would be that I really waited a long time between the appetizer and entree and even if I had not been under a time crunch, that could have been annoying to someone, not me, who was happy to be there rather than at Chipotle which I have been frequenting all too often as my pre class meal stop. I would probably give this a three and a half stars just because of the wait between courses.

After waiting at the bar for about 15 minutes, our table was ready.  I didn't really care for the bread that was served.  It was cold and oddly shaped.  For apps we shared the Crispy Shrimp and Baked Oysters.  The Crispy Shrimp dish was kind of strange.  All of the components were fine but just didn't go well together.  There were some large batter-dipped shrimp, some crisp cold green beans with a lit bit of heat and then some ham.  Maybe if the beans were served warm the dish might have worked better... just a thought.  The ham didn't do anything for me either.  I wanna say it was pancetta, but it was kinda tough and just not that great.  The Baked Oyster dish was much better.  My friend who doesn't normally like oysters really enjoyed it.  For entrees, I had the steak and my friend the chicken.  My steak was pretty good.  It was exceedingly tender.  It was served atop a really meager amount of potato puree and cipollini onions.  My friend's chicken was quite tasty.  It was very moist and flavorful, although not at the level of Zuni.  For dessert, we split the Warm Apple Galette.  The actual galette was pretty good.  There wasn't a lot of fruit in it, but it was tasty and delicate.  However, the scoop of vanilla ice cream served with it was super hard.  It reminded me more of kulfi than ice cream.  I didn't even realize I was doing it, but my friend pointed out that I was cutting my ice cream with a knife.  Overall the service was pretty good.  There weren't long wait times between courses.  Our waiter also recommended a nice bottle of Pinot that complemented our meal well.  I wish I could remember his name... sounds like he's one of the better waiters according to all the bad service reviews on here.   He made a reference to the \"Play it again Sam\" line in Casablanca that I totally didn't get but my friend did.  It was kind of random so she asked him if his name was Sam, but it wasn't.  I think the restaurant has great promise but is still going through some growing pains.  I would definitely go back.", "author": "Saw T."}

I had dinner this week there...my second visit.  The atmosphere was really hopping which was nice, and even though half our party arrived an hour late for our reservation, they quickly sat us.  The servers were good, but the menu was a little uninspiring--not bad, but I wasn't thrilled with the options.  So, I ordered the gnocchi, which is usually boring but filling...a good back up entree.  I have to say, the gnocchi was the best I have ever tasted.

The first time I went there I fell in love with it and that is what I was looking forward to when I went this second time. We ordered a glass of wine each and when we were almost done, the server came and poured us another glass, complimentary! They don't always do that though :) Also we ordered the crispy shrimp salad, which had a refreshing dressing and cilantro. The poutin is basically fat fries with short rib gravy poured on top, it's a canadian dish I think. It's good, but heavy. Then we tried the foie gras, cured & sauteed. It was my first time eating foie gras and i preffered the cured version as it melts in your mouth. The sautee version comes with this delicious fruit jam/spread which is a nice compliment to the savory flavor. As the entree I got the fulton valley chicken which is really juicy and comes with potatoes. For dessert, it was a chocolate pudding thing which is pictured on their website but is not on the dessert menu- it was melt in your mouth good!", "author": "S K."}

But when we called to make reservations, the restaurant was closed for Memorial day, and we were referred to Salt House, its sister restaurant.  We were assured that the menu was quite similar in fare.  I hate to say it, because I wanted so bad for it to be good, but I was pretty disappointed.  The decor was typical of this type of restaurant-exposed brick and beams, large mirror over the bar, open kitchen, distressed wood-a style I like, sure, but i could've been in Nopa, or Serpentine, or a number of other places.  The service was excellent-our server (Carrie) really knew the menu and wine list (also excellent) and was able to speak intelligently about the ingredients and pairings.  So far, we're at 4 stars...but the food was disappointing.  I truly don't know if this is \"a thing\" like the stinking rose has with garlic, but I found every single dish to be WAY too salty.  From the salad to the halibut to the vegetables, every bite evoked the same reaction.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good...just not great.  What wasn't over salted was bland.  I can't say that I would recommend it to a friend; but I wouldn't NOT recommend it either.  I found the experience, like the food, to be somewhat forgettable.

The warm nuts are to die for but apart from that, nothing quite came together. The poutin, that everyone raves about is made with a starchy baking type potatoes and results in a dried, mealy potato that is saved only by the delicious cheese and gravy sauce that is slathered on top.  Our subsequent dishes (all 6 of them) were equally as unmemorable.  The elements are all there but somehow nothing quite came together.   The presentation is beautiful and when the dishes are delivered to the table, one expects them to WOW because they are all so beautiful but ultimately, it wasnothing more than your average but beautiful ly presented pub fare.  However, the ambiance and the use of space are absoltely amazing.  The high ceilings, rough steel beams, brick walls and simple furnishings are really stunning..and the neighborhood really needed a place to sit down and enjoy a drink after work.  Set your expectations on the lower side for the food but I would go back to this resaurant in a heart beat to sit at the bar, enjoy the scene and some more of those truffled honey roasted nuts.", "author": "Lulu L."}

We relied on my sister's advice for where to eat since she lives in the Mission District in this wonderful city here. She was torn between the Salt house and town hall (same owner, interestingly enough). Cozy seating all close together in semi-wobbly chairs, but I guess it adds to the charm. I was enamored with the black/red chalk paintings of a pirate on the wall...too bad Jack Sparrow wasn't chugging back the wine with us! :) We started with a Darioush Pinot Noir and it was total Sade \"Smooth Operator\" like silk down your tongue and throat, yet still structured with tanins and lots of flavah flav! :) This wine is like La Perla lingerie...smooth & sexy. I guess I can't just stay fixated on the wine but it was soooo good & of course multiple bottles were enjoyed. The celery root puree soup with a hint of apple was deliciously comforting and was actually more enjoyable than my main course. My sister's winter salad with beets, persimmon, and hazelnut was also deliciously comforting. If i ate steak, I'd have probably rubbed my face all over her New York steak strip and the braised short ribs with a toasted crunchy mustard topping and brussel sprouts. My sole in a red wine reduction was light and healthy, but not the favorite thing I put in my mouth here. The seared ahi tuna with nicoise style olives and leeks was delicious as also was the lentil smoked salmon. Our favorite dessert was the cookie plate with oatmeal, chocolate chip, sugar shortbread, peanut butter, white chocolate macadamia nut, and a cookie version of a reese's peanut butter cup.

We had pickled vegetables, the poutine fries, chestnut soup, special crab salad, and the lamb shank. Things started out pretty well with the fries and soup, both were rich and hearty reminding us of the experience at Town Hall. Then things crashed when we got our entrees. The shank while gigantic and tender as lamb shank should be was completely without flavor once you got past the mustard breadcrumb coating. The crab salad was a special and had fried artichokes, which didn't really seem to go with the crab flavor. It just ended up being too savory. Dessert was an apple tart with cider caramel and vanilla ice cream. Where the hell was the caramel. There were like three drops.

Onto the review.\n\nFirst off the hostess is rude and pretentious.  We had reservations for 9 but ended up getting there at 9:30.  Reason being our friends flight was delayed and she arrived late.  I notified the hotel concierge of this and he told me he would contact the restaurant of the delay.  We end up getting there and the hostess tells us we should hae been on time or let them know we were going to be late.  I told her the concierge at the hotel called in.  She refutes this by saying no hotel called.  Then comes a manager, a nice friendly lady in a suit jacket greets me by my last name, and apologizes for the rudeness of the hostess.  She told me she got the call from the concierge and was waiting for my arrival.  How awesome is that? \n\nWe end up sitting up stairs which is great, you get a view of the restaurant.  It's a bit crowded down stairs so I highly recommend dining upstairs for a more intimate setting.  Our server comes and we ordered Poutine, which is AMAZING.  Hot fluffy french fries, covered in melted sharp white cheddar, and drenched in a nice warm beef gravy.  MMMMM.  And then I ask the server to recommend a white wine.  I tell her I don't like anything too dry, and like the lighter fruitier flavor.  She recommend a Pinot Gris when I was leaning towards a Reisling.  We get the wine and it was DRY.  So dry that everytime I took a sip I had to drink some water.  Horrible wine recommendation.  The food was good but to be honest with you, I can't remember anything special about it.  I got the steak with a porcini marrow crust,  which was good, but the crust made the steak dry imo.  The sauce accompanying it was amazing.  My friends ordered the Chicken and Sea Bass.  Both good but not worth mentioning.  \n\nThis place would have gotten a 3 star rating simply on the food alone.  But with the snooty hostess, and thehorrible wine recommendation they get a 2.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-23", "description": "Here's a reasonably good new San Fran place to dine: housed in an old printing press, this new Rosenthal brothers venture in SOMA produces good, relatively simple dishes, though to be precise, it's not quite a four but certainly better than a three. The room has the potential to be noisy, since there is little on the painted brick walls to dampen the sound. The tables are close but not on top of each other. There's a small full bar near the front. The bread (two pieces of an epi-baguette from Bay Bread) was presented ceremoniously wrapped in brown paper but wasn't warmed, a bit surprising for a restaurant at this price point. The beet salad was tossed with a not-too-overpowering horseradish-based dressing which complemented the earthy beets and the salmon well. The salt cod brandade, while tasty, was just warm, not piping hot and bit starchy. For entrees, we had the duck confit with huckleberries, a lovely combination of nicely done fruit concentrate and tender, moist duck. There was some kind of orangish paste under the duck that was too sweet and ill-defined. The steak was done nicely with cippollino onions and was of good (not great) quality. Overall, compared, say, to Delfina, a restaurant of similar goals, this one's not quite up there. But then again, the environment was more pleasant and there was no pomp or circumstance required to get a table a few days ahead of time. Service was competent and pleasant, and (nice touch) everyone said goodbye as we left.", "author": "Willis N."}

No such luck.  I went for lunch with a friend yesterday and ordered the hamburger with onion rings - pretty standard, right?  I ordered it medium and it came out raw in the middle.  I would have asked them to cook it a little more, but since we'd already waited 1/2 an hour to get our food the first go around, I didn't think I'd have time to get my burger properly cooked and not make my boss wonder where the hell I'd been all that time.  Generally, I'd let it go, but I proceeded to get pretty sick all evening and into the night.  So, careful what you order in this place - I'd stick to Happy Hour!", "author": "Jocy W."}

I was also a diner at salt house on friday and her recollection of her behavior is misleading at best.  I didn't know salt house offered dinner and a show on friday night.  Every diner around her knows that wine splashed on her purse because she chose to stand up and scream at the table that did it.  This is pretty much a direct quote: \"What the #@!*, it's a $500 purse from New York!\"  After the owner, not the manager, came over and led her away to calm her down, she returned to her table and started yelling at the people again.  That is when the owner returned and asked her to leave.  Needless to say, management and staff made sure everyone else around was OK and had a good laugh with our table about the incident.  All around a great time, with professional staff and exceptional food. Thanks, Salt House.", "author": "sandra v."}

The shrimp were great, but should have been de-veined.  The green-bean salad was over dressed and salty.  I ordered the scallops for my entree. They weren't cleaned well, gritty and one was obviously burned with the most extremely burned part cut off.  One of the accompanying clams was also rancid and the whole dish was over salted.  For dessert, I tried the sticky bun which was wonderful and the mint - chocolate chip cake which was just okay.    I guess I \"Salt\" house is appropriate given my experience.", "author": "Christina F."}

After hating on yelpers for so long now, I have decided to join the melee. I went to Salt House for lunch a few Thursdays ago. We had reservations for 12:45, but showed up thirty minutes early. Quite unexpectedly we ran into the owner who knows my girlfriend and he made sure we were seated right away. I know that this cannot be expected by all, but it was a very pleasant surprise. Besides the \"vip\" treatment the food and service were on point. We shared the scallop ceviche and roasted beet salad. Scallops had no fishiness and were absolutely wonderful. For entrees my girlfriend had the duck confit, my mother the petrale sole, and I the burger with bleu cheese. The temperatures were perfect and nothing was in need of seasoning. Although we had no room for dessert we were celebrating a birthday and three were sent out. All were fantastic, but the one with chocolate mousse was my personal favorite. As far as ambiance is concerned I dig the pirate theme. The water pitchers and lighting are especially cool. Timing was on in all aspects. Highly recommend.", "author": "pax r."}

We ordered 4 appetizers - crispy shrimp, dayboat scallops, asparagus with pork belly, and tagiatelle. Our drinks came out first and we were not impressed. Then the crispy shrimp and the tagiatelle. Way to turn things around. The salad that comes with the shrimp is fantastic. Better than the shrimp for sure. The tagiatelle was our favorite appetizer. The flavors were so rich and different from anything we had ever tasted, but had this been an entree, I would have given up after 5 bites and been upset for trying this place. Good in small amounts. The best part of the dayboat scallops were the sauces and sunchokes. Lastly, the asparagus, I could have gone without the pork. It was fatty and lacking flavor. Everything that was supposed to be showcased was not that great, but all the sides were fantastic. When you look at whole picture, it was a a good meal. Will definitely return.", "author": "Vanessa W."}

The crispy shrimp was exactly what I was hoping it would be, although there were a lot of green beans. I would order this again, but it would be the smaller plate with less green beans. May be they should mix in another type of veggie to mix it up a little bit. I liked the almonds and bacon pieces in it and loved the sauce. Almost perfect! My friend had the burger with onion rings. The rings are a little thin and the burger looked a little small. He ate them separately, but I would have totally put the rings on the burger. It would be good to add a little side salad or a few fries to the burger plate, but that's just my opinion. I would still be hungry after just the burger and fried onion shavings. Seriously, how low of a setting is their mandolin on? If you go, definitely get an appetizer or starter salad and you will be satisfied at the end of your meal.", "author": "Michelle M."}

The food, atmosphere, energy and crowd were all terrific but what really blew us away was their attitude towards service.  Apparently the restaurant had inadvertently overbooked a table of 4 which had been waiting for a while.  We were sitting at a table for two with an empty table for two next to us.  The Maitre d' offered us an \"indecent proposal\" and after explaining the situation he asked if we would be willing to switch to a different table after our appetizer so that he could accommodate the waiting customers and offered to comp our dinner, a very generous gesture.  Moving tables was no trouble and not only was our meal on the house but he graciously added an extra desert.   That level of generosity was unexpected and unnecessary but really made an impression about their attitude toward customer service and customer satisfaction.", "author": "Paul R."}

I went last night with a good friend, both of us coming straight from the office. For a Wednesday night it was PACKED and the atmosphere is great- a really awesome space. We had a reservation for 8:30 and didn't get seated until almost 9:00, which was kind of annoying. Our server was rushed and spacey, but I didn't mind too much because she was attentive when she needed to be. We shared a bottle of the house white, which came in a very cool retro glass bottle, and loved the water carafe in the old milk bottle too. Based on yelp reviews, I started with the crispy shrimp and green bean salad, which was AMAZING. A truly perfect appetizer. I followed it with another appetizer, the yellowtail, which was sashimi-style over a cucumber broth. It was interesting and delicious. My friend had the chicken and loved it. However, we shared the cookie plate for dessert- which was not very good at all. A plate of so-so cookies for 8.5 dollars. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. Anyway, overall a really yummy dinner and I will definitely go back, even though I do have to say that I still like Town Hall more.", "author": "Emily B."}

I gently announced the news to my waitress and she apologized and said that she would inform to her manager. I expected the manager would come to our table for apology or I would get a new cake since I really wanted to eat the chocolate cake. Things happen, so I was not upset but I was so disappointed at their service. Nothing happened, just my cake wasn't charged. It's not about money at all, so I would rather see how well the restaurant treats their customers. That's only one thing. Second, I had fresh raw oysters and apparently the oyster weren't fresh enough that I've got rash on my upper chest and back. I grew up eating raw oysters and I've never had any problem in my life.
