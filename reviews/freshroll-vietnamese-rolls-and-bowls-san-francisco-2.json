Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Thursday, August 2nd around 12:15pm.\n\nCustom Single Freshroll: Special roll with choice of protein and vegetables, Comes with noodles inside by default ($4.49)  \n*Grilled All-Natural Lemongrass Pork\n*Jalapenos\n*Tangy Citrus Ginger: Contains soy sauce\n*Vietnamese Vinaigrette\n*Mint\n*Cilantro\n*Pickled Veggies\n*Lettuce\n*Bean Sprouts\n*Cucumber (+$0.49)\n*Carrots (+$0.49)\n*Jalape\u00f1o (+$0.49)\n*Mint Leaf (+$0.49)\n*Note: no noodles\n\nSince I added so many extras, my roll ended up being $6.45. It was a big freshroll though. I did wish they made the additional fillings less in price as you pay the same thing when you add toppings to their three roll orders. If getting one roll, it should be less, right? Taste wise, the roll was great! I liked the vietnamese vinaigrette as I like nuoc cham. Especially if I add sambal to it. The other sauce was little too thick and creamy for me. My only complaint about the roll is that they put noodles in there when I noted no noodles. I figured they just don't do rolls without noodles, but a coworker noted the same thing and she didn't have noodles in her roll.\n\nI also ordered a Side of Pho Broth: A side of our all-natural chicken pho broth, with white onions, cilantro, and scallions ($2.49) as I adore soup. This was tasty. Clean with a meaty flavor. There wasn't a lot of cilantro, scallion, etc, but I keep chopped green onions in the fridge at work, so I added some for texture.\n\nBased on my enjoyment of the roll, I want to give them four stars. But knocking them down one since my roll had noodles. And for the price of the added ingredients to only one roll. It really should be cheaper.", "author": "Elena N."}

This wasn't the case here. The meat was gristly from fat and so disappointing.\n- Stingy on the meat: I got at least a third less meat than what I usually get :(\n- Stingy on the sauces: The other location has bottles and bottles of all of their homemade sauces, so you try them all and use as much as you want.

I can't remember all of the toppings that came with the standard set, but they included bean sprouts, cilantro, pickled carrots/radish, and crispy onion flakes. It was delicious!

First of all coming into the store I thought I was ordering Pho, but it was really hard to understand the lady behind the counter. I ended up getting a chicken bowl which has noodles and vegetables and the chicken. I found out you can order Pho broth for extra, but just one wasn't even enough to make it into a soup. At this point my meal was about $15 bucks which was way too expensive for the food. The meal itself wasn't half bad but it woulda been better at the very least at $10! I enjoyed the chicken, but probably would be hesitant to come back anytime soon. I will say the sandwiches actually looked good, so if I do return I would try that one!", "author": "James R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-08", "description": "Another Chipotle-esqe fast casual restaurant, this one focusing on Vietnamese food with summer roll, sandwich and bowl options.  I like summer rolls and I really appreciate the freshness of them being made to order.  Overall, a good experience except for the protein seeming a bit too skimpy and too room temperature.\n\nFresh Roll with \"The Standard\" & Crispy Goodness: The Standard is pretty standard, essentially the same mix of veggies and noodles you'd expect from a traditional Vietnamese joint.  The Crispy Goodness is a pastry wrapped scallion that runs the whole length of the roll and adds a scattering crunchy texture to each bite.  It's kinda like having a mini spring roll hidden instead of a summer roll.  I'm a fan of texture mixing, so I liked it.\n\nLemongrass Pork: Liked the marinade.  Probably would have been better if warmer.\n\nGrilled Chicken: Didn't really stand out, was kind of boring protein.\n\nCrispy Tofu: Had a smoky marinade.  Though it was fried, it wasn't really that crispy... at least not compared to the Crispy Goodness.\n\nGrandma's Peanut Sauce: Like the typical peanut sauce, but less thick and peanut buttery.  I've had better.\n\nCitrus Ginger: Appears like a salad dressing, but also like a really tangy dipping sauce.\n\nChicken Pho Broth: Refreshing, kinda like bone broth before bone broth was a fad.  Might have had a bit too strong a cinnamon taste though.", "author": "Adam B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-09", "description": "Just in time for the much anticipated opening of the spanking new Target Express, Freshroll decided to open a second outlet right across the street. I do ask myself what my life has become when I get excited about the imminent opening of a mini-Target, but then I see Jamie W.'s palpable excitement and realize I am not alone in my cloistered suburban sensibilities. After all, the big breakthrough was when Target opened at the Metreon revitalizing a retail space that previously looked like a prime candidate for the wrecking ball. Perhaps following the same path, Freshroll looks like it's trying to duplicate its own success at the Metreon by arriving on Bush where ironically another like-minded chain, Freshii, previously failed.\n\nJudging from the opening week queues, the reality is that there is a built-in appetite among FiDi workers for their Chipotle-style operation. One marginal disappointment with this specific location is that they weren't able to secure a permit to allow them to make the pho bowls. They can sell you the chicken pho broth for what it's worth at $1.99 but not the whole shebang. So I had time to ponder my alternate strategy while in line with the overhead menu front and center (photo: http://bit.ly/1Aa0i73). I decided to go for the $8.49 Specialty Rolls, a trio where I could sample the Lemongrass Pork, Roasted Chicken and Baked Tofu at the same time (photo: http://bit.ly/1MkcOGX). The \"standard\" packaging would suit me fine - lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, cucumber, crispy shallots, pickled veggies and jalape\u00f1os.\n\nI threw caution to the wind and paid the $0.99 surcharge for avocado, and to top it off, among the four sauces they offered, I went with the richest one, Grandma's Peanut Sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1E0GioO). Wait, there's more. I also ordered a $1.99 bag of their Homemade Taro Chips to add a little sweet crunch to my lunch (photo: http://bit.ly/18u6Nd7). When I got back to my office to gorge on it, I have to admit I was surprised I enjoyed it, especially the roast chicken selection, since my memories of their Metreon operation are less than charitable when I tried the salad bowl on a couple of occasions there. I have yet to try those here or the sandwiches, but I probably will and hopefully won't be disappointed. Meanwhile, the three roasted chicken rolls will do me just fine.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the rolls rock for a lunchtime option amid the salads and sammies in the immediate vicinity\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...tight quarters for dining in but just fine for a take-out spot\nSERVICE - 3 stars...new, enthusiastic and predictably programmed\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a chain that appears to be improving over time by following Chipotle's success formula", "author": "Ed U."}

Went between 7-8pm on 3/25, the guy working the register needs to be fired asap.   Rude and condescending.  If you want some real viet food go to a real viet place, not this fake chipotle wannabe.", "author": "Rick N."}

They have great options for protein, including shrimp and their ingredients are super fresh.  At lunch time they have a pretty long line, but its worth it because it moves pretty fast.  Prices are reasonable for the area.  The only downside is that they dont have traditional pho, but they do offer pho broth if you're craving that.", "author": "Yasi N."}

However, the last 2 times I have gone with my friend, the amounts have shrank down by 30%. It's literally a $10 bowl of lettuce and noodles but now they are being skimpy on the lettuce and noodles. Also, I get pineapple added and today the pineapple had a mildewy taste to it. So I don't know if management is slacking off or they are trying to squeeze for profit but seems to be going down hill. I probably won't come back since same experience twice now.", "author": "Bunny C."}

We stumbled upon this location on a \"soft opening\" day, and they let us eat for free! A family of four!! We didn't realize it was not open to the general public, but they didn't mind and invited us to stay. Lunch for two adults and two kids (aged 4) would have been under $25 here. Lots of options, and all very fresh food. I'll  go back, and pay next time!! :-)", "author": "Amylynn F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-25", "description": "Freshroll has built up quiet a devout following among my coworkers, myself included. Is it authentic? Probably not. Is it the best freshroll in SF? I don't care. It's delicious, filling and a healthy alternative to a sandwich or other quick lunch options in the FiDi area. You can't go wrong with their rolls -- I recommend the tofu + pork paired with \"the standard\" and either the vinaigrette or nam nam sauce (not advertised, but just ask for it).  If you're a little crunched for time, order online and pick it up 20(ish) minutes later.", "author": "Alison S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-15", "description": "Great slightly cheaper lunch option in FiDi area. It's a chipotle style vietnamese place that offers sandwhiches, bowls, and rolls. The sandwhiches have nicely toasted bread and give a lot of meat/pickled veggies for $7.99 plus tax. The standard toppings include sauce, picked carrots and radishes, cilantro, and optional jalapeno. Service is friendly and fast since they have multiple people at the ordering station as well as two cash registers.", "author": "Kailin L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-11", "description": "Came during the lunch rush and first impression was that it reminded me of Bamboo Asia, minus the Japanese and Indian options but with the ability to customize your food. There's three options: roll, sandwich or bowl. You choose your protein, filling and sauces. I got the bowl with lemongrass pork, \"standard\" fillings and Vietnamese vinaigrette. The line was pretty long and moved slowly, again we came during the lunch hour so it's to be expected, but the food was pretty good. Nothing amazing in terms of flavor but definitely an affordable, somewhat healthy option in the FiDi (which you can never have enough of).", "author": "Ashley Nicole C."}

If I had to compare the Fresh Roll on 4th street vs Bush street -- 4th street is better. \n\nI did notice that they seemed to have changed their \"standard\" ingredients to take out the pineapple. Maybe it was too pricey for them to keep as a standard item. I do think their fresh rolls are more delicious with the pineapple, and without the jalapenos. \n\nI typically get the veggie option -- the 3 fresh rolls with baked tofu. I'm not a fan of cilantro, so I always exclude that. \n\nHopefully once they get into a good groove, they'll be back up to 5 stars in my book.", "author": "Janel A."}

The location's also awesome, just one block away from my office. OK taste for garlic shrimp bowl - great for Vietnamese food in Financial District, but not impressive. A little over-priced. Small portion.", "author": "Brenda Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "Great concept but food didn't deliver. They offer all the traditional ingredients in Vietnamese food yet it didn't come together and lacked any type of great flavor. I got the rice bowl with pork and it was extremely generic tasting. The plus side is that they are busy so you know the food is fresh. I will not be revisiting fresh rolls again.", "author": "Rhonda T."}

Good flavor, and good combination when you add the different fillings. It's a little expensive, but I get two meals out of it so it's fine. I've been going here once a week since I found it. I've seen the line pretty long, but they're good about getting people through quickly.", "author": "Brett N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-17", "description": "Four stars, so yes, I'm a fan. The whole \"make your own\" thing is super trendy, but as we know from a certain Mexican-ish place, it does work pretty well. So when I discovered this Vietnamese version, I was both excited (cuz it's different) yet slightly cautious (from fear of being offended cuz I love authentic Vietnamese food). I got the lemongrass pork spring rolls with the normal toppings except cilantro, which comes with THREE pretty good-sized rolls. A little heavy on the lettuce vs. the other ingredients, and I wish they were a little more generous with the noodles and protein, but there was still enough of everything to taste. The pork had lots of flavor, noodles were cooked right, the jalapenos had a bite to them, and the peanut sauce, altho not authentic, still tasted like peanut sauce. And the prices are reasonable, especially considering it's a trendy Vietnamese spot in the FinDis. Give it a try... you'll be pleasantly surprised.", "author": "Darryl Y."}
