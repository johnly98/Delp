It's one of those places that don't really use tomato sauce. There is however plenty of cheese, and the toppings of the day went pretty well with it. I think mine was artichoke, spinach, and onion. They have a wide variety of baked goods, which many people were lining up for.

So far I've stopped by 3 times this week...\n\nThe pizza is amazing and wonderfully savory and delicious. Each day brings a new pizza recipe and I've never been disappointed. I usually get a slice for $2.75, which I feel is a reasonable price for what you're getting in return. They also have half and whole pizza options. I'd say that their pizzas are on-par with that of Cheeseboard in Berkeley, so if you're a fan of Cheeseboard you'll for sure love Arizmendi.\n\nAs for their pastries, I tried the Mexican Chocolate Muffin and a Pecan Roll. Both were great! The Mexican Chocolate Muffin is rich and also packs a little bit of spice - but not too much!

Normally I don't like scones because they tend to be like a dry brick but the ones here were actually moist inside! The blackberry flavor is also a really nice touch. \n\n* Cowgirl Cookie *\nI love a good oatmeal cookie and this one is a really tough cookie to beat.

In addition, the slices, both the full ones and beloved sliver, were smaller than I believe Cheeseboard serves. I'm happy I decided to grab a couple scones for breakfast the next two days because they saved my impression of Arizmendi. I had the wonderful corn cherry scone (I love cornmeal texture in general) and blueberry ginger scone. First of all, the corn cherry scone was huge, but it was also delicious with just the right amount of sweetness from the sugar coating on top. The ginger flavor in the blueberry ginger scone was noticeable but not overpowering, in case you are apprehensive about it. In both scones the fruit pieces were moist, which is of utmost importance when it comes to these things. They have erected a few rows of nice amphitheater style seating outside on the sidewalk, and there are a few seats inside if one wants to be sheltered from the wind.

The pizza has similarities to what they have at Cheese Board in Berkeley, but it does not compare. First of all, the slices here are smaller than those at Cheese Board for the same price. I did like how fresh the ingredients were. The flavor of the tomatoes was intense and delicious. I wished they put more on the pizza! The avocado sauce slathered on top was also very tasty. Aside from the toppings, there was a lot of dough, barely any cheese, and too much crust. It was very dry and bland finishing off the pizza. It would be nice to have some sauce (like the papi chulo sauce at Cheese Board) available to dip the crust in.", "author": "Lauren H."}

Sure, one can make an argument for whatever pizza place in SF is best, but not many places can boast quality taste at an affordable price like Arizmendi can.\n\nI've been here on several different occasions and have yet to encounter a pizza I didn't like! From toasted walnuts to pecorino romano to smoked mozzarella (on any given day), there is definitely an exotic take on the pizza we are used to, and yet they always ended up being so warm, well-made, and delicious!\n\nI'm also a sucker for artichoke pastries in general, so I was glad to see that they had some in those drawers on your left as you walk into the bakery. It could be better if it was warmed up so that the bread can soften and attain a crunchier texture, but it was still satisfactory to my tastebuds.\n\nIt's also nice to support a worker owned bakery that promotes sustainable living and ongoing career development.

While skimming through the Yelp reviews, it looks like the pizza is pretty popular... so I decided to bring home a 1/2 pizza home to bake for dinner... and let me tell you, it was awkward walking around the area with a huge pizza box and riding it home on the BART. Two homeless men approached me asking for a slice... which then resulted in being called a \"cheapskate\" for not sharing. SIgh, oh, San Francisco. Despite all of the hassle of walking/BARTing the pizza home, it was worth it! I think it was worth the $11. It was super flavorful and not drenched in grease. The best part was that it's mushroom flavored, with spinach and pesto. Yum.\n\nThey offer a pizza of the day and you can check online what they're serving that day.

It can be overwhelming with the amount of people confident in their orders, while you're their trying to decide which freshly baked pleasure to enjoy. The couple of glass cases were packed with warm, olfactory-pleasing scones, cookies, muffins, and other items that were more foreign to me. \n\nLuckily, the staff member was able to switch from focused and speedy to focused and attentive as he helped me decide what to choose. In the end, the cherry corn scone was a clear winner - especially after reading multiple raving reviews about it. And yes, everyone was accurate. It was a greatly baked scone with a crisp outer shell and slightly softer inside. The tartness of the cherries was perfectly offset by the sugary casing of the scone. The cornmeal, I guess, used to bake the scone provided a fabulous texture. \n\nCan't wait to try their pizza (unfortunately I just finished eating before finding this place) and other goods!", "author": "Jacob M."}

I know; quite a disgrace. Today, I went on yet another first date (please help me, I can't believe this is starting again) and my date proposed Arizmendi. \n\nHe lives in the neighborhood and is a very fascinating guy. Men out there, let me give you a tip - no matter how feminist you think your date is, you should ALWAYS offer to pay, especially when it costs less than $10. Anyway, what did I get for $10?\n\nWell, I got a Salvadoran Quesadilla, a slice of the pizza, and a medium mocha. I don't pretend to be a Salvadoran food expert by any means but when did a cornbread muffin turn into a Salvadoran quesadilla? It was tasty and had sesame seeds on top. The pizza was topped with pesto, goat cheese, and other stuff. It was inexpensive and good but I wouldn't go out of the way for it. And mocha, well, tasted like mocha.\n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh. I liked everything just fine but I think I must have had unreasonable expectations due to its reputation. Arizmendi is very popular and we had to wait in line for a little while. There was no seating inside so we plopped down at the parklet outside in the only spot open, next to a crazy homeless lady with some sort of mental illness. It was a truly SF experience.

And that firm buttermilk biscuit texture, browned and baked to a slight crunch, continues to make my heart sing.\n\nWhile I'm a huge Arizmendi scone fangirl, my friend is a vegan chocolate mint cookie believer. For $2, you get a big ol' chocolate cookie imbued with hints of mint and peppered with big chunks of chocolate. It's as if a Girl Scout thin mint recently discovered fast food and gained a couple love handles...of chocolate. I liked it, but I liked the scone more.\n\nAs for our main goal, we picked up 3 bags of fresh pizza dough for $3.50 a pop. The bag didn't come with directions, and we didn't think to call and ask, so we looked up different pizza recipes online and decided to bake our pizzas at 400F for 25 minutes.

I cannot get through the day without the iced coffee (Equator coffee) and a baked good. Arizmendi offers a few seasonal items, but their staples are timeless treats. When a holiday does come around, don't pass up the opportunity to try something new!\n\nFavorites:\n-Breakfast roll: Cheese on bread with different ingredients mixed in every day, such as pesto or jalapeno. Try the one with an egg!\n-Chocolate thing: Basically a brioche with chocolate pieces. Yum!\n-Lemon poppyseed muffin: Great snack for when you want something sweet but not too sweet. I love the muffin top because it's nice and crispy. I always eat that first. \n-Chocolate chip cookie: Expect thick pieces of chocolate chopped from a nice semi-sweet block. I reward myself with this cookie almost once a week. \n-Vegan mint chocolate cookie: This is one of the most chocolaty cookies ever. The mint extract gives a nice contrast to the rich chocolate flavor\n-Pizza: You cannot go wrong with a slice of pizza from Arizmendi's. They have one pizza type a day. My favorites are the corn or potato days. I always get a slice with a small salad. \n-Pumpkin muffin: This one is seasonal, but I'm really really obsessed with the pumpkin muffin because of its texture, which is soft, but rich from the pumpkin\n\nIf you are not the adventurous type, I would avoid the lavender chocolate chip bread pudding. At first, it sounded like an interesting combo. I had one bite, and could not hold it down because it tasted like potpourri. Every bite was like eating a couple full of dried flowers. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Arizmendi's. Do yourself a favor and buy a whole pizza.

It's vegetarian (but doesn't feel like it is) with a thin sourdough crust. The toppings are always great, fresh, and creative. Corn and potato days are my favorite, followed by tomatoes and artichoke hearts. \n\nOn the weekends, the best bread gets sold out in the mornings. On weekdays, I can stop by on the way back from work and still get some of best stuff... Which brings me to my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE: the X Roll (eXperimental cheese rolls). It's always some delicious fresh savory cheese roll with something like spinach, artichoke, basil, sun-dried tomato, zucchini, eggplant, corn, ... and the amazing list goes on. \n\nThere's a fun community feel to this place.

Even though our jeans were tight, our hearts were content. We would sandbag baked goods for the evening and the next day. And even the next day. \n\nGone are the carefree days when you called me and we would both look at the pizza menu online while we discussed and put together a pizza eating schedule based on our respective tastes. Remember when you used to be able to order an entire Arizmendi pizza FOR DELIVERY from Order Ahead? We had the most wonderful time, eating that oh-so delicious pizza with super fresh ingredients and having plenty for 3 days of meals. The delivery option allowed us to completely avoid exercise, and we loved every minute of it. We would put on our pajama jeans or leggings bought in the Liz Lange section of Target and laugh at people walking by with yoga mats. Now, there is no more delivery from Order Ahead, and I am left to reserve entire Arizmendi pizzas for myself. I walk home by my lonesome and eat it in my apartment with the lights off, watching Lifetime, as a single tear slowly rolls down my cheek. I am left to wonder where did I go wrong? \n\nBecause of your condition, I am forced to brave this impossibly busy Mission location by myself. I no longer have a second pair of eyes to ensure that I have purchased every delicious and fresh bread and pastry and to remind me to get a coffee. There's no one to tell me not to worry, that we will work it off tomorrow, although we both knew that we would not because we'd both be pregnant with food babies. \n\nYour gluten-free lifestyle has robbed you of years of bread and pastry eating. More importantly, it is really inconvenient for me. Your offer to go with me and get whatever gluten free item is on the menu is just sad and pathetic, as you are now but a ghost of your former self. Worse still, I cannot have, and indeed do not want, a bite of your bland, flavorless gluten-free food. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. \n\nIf you keep living this way and do not get the help you desperately knead (see what I did there?), I will be left with no choice but to cut you off completely.  I will not go with you to any Loving Hut restaurant anymore. I will not give you a bite of anything that you are going to want a bite of. I will set up a bread machine in your apartment and make sure that the smell of bread baking wafts through your apartment at day break. I can no longer sit back and silently watch you destroy yourself. \n\nYou are straddling the line between eating bread, baked goods, pastry and pizza and being too far gone to help. Will you accept the help that is being offered to you today and meet me at Arizmendi so we can get your life back on track? The first step is the hardest. Denial ain't just a river in Egypt. \n\nLove, \nSantino", "author": "Sunny S."}

They have a wide selection of baked goods, including several breads of the day. They also have a pizza of the day. Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch when I went, so I couldn't try their pizza. But I saw it, and it had a lot of fresh ingredients on it (mushroom, feta, zucchini, onion, parsley, and garlic oil on that particular day), and I fully intend to eat there for lunch next time I'm in Mission District! They also have the typical cafe drinks available.\n\nMy friend got one of the shortbread cookies. Every day they have several flavors, which they apparently rotate. She got the ginger shortbread. It had just the right amount on ginger flavor - decently strong without ending up chewing on huge chunks of ginger. The shortbread was soft and mild, not overly sweet. Well done!\n\nI got the Wolverine (sourdough with walnuts, raisins, and apricots - which added a nice zing!), which I would recommend. The crust was perfectly crispy, yet it remained soft inside. \n\nAlso, it smells AWESOME. Since they have a pretty wide selection, you can definitely stop it and grab a snack to fuel your exploration of SF. The main problem is deciding which one to choose!", "author": "Chelsea D."}

I was tempted by pretty much every baked good on offer, but ended up choosing a Mexican chocolate muffin. I love chocolate, and I especially love it for breakfast, so this was my dream muffin. For Mexican chocolate, it was only subtly spicy, mostly coming through when I hit the chocolate chips interspersed throughout. The best part of the muffin, as Jenna Maroney says, is the top, and that was indeed the case here. With its slightly overbaked crust, it tasted like the delicious edges of a brownie. It was a pretty decadent breakfast overall, and I was stuffed after one muffin. My boyfriend got the pecan roll, and the bite I had was both flaky and light. He loved it. \n\nThe prices were fairly reasonable, with both my muffin and his pecan roll ending up between $2-3 each. The bakery itself has plenty of seating between indoor tables and outdoor benches, and it has a fun hipster atmosphere to it (it's a worker's co-op). If I had had more time in the city, I definitely would have been back to try their delicious-looking pizza. Next time, Arizmendi!", "author": "Katie H."}

For all you meat lovers out there, don't worry, the pizza is still amazingly awesome without meat.\n\n**Note: Different locations have different pizzas of the day! **\n\nThis location had more tables than the location in the Sunset. You can get pizza starting at 11:30am. Like Cheeseboard, you get the extra free slices when you order a whole pizza. Since you're in SF, the crust is sourdough instead. That was a nice treat!

The special pizza slice of the day was amazing!  Caramelized onion and brussel sprouts on a thin slice with a sourdough crust and just the right amount of delicious cheese!  The almond cookie was a chewy powdered cookie and had a very strong almond flavor.  The jalapeno cheese breadstick had the right amount of spice, but not too much cheese flavor.

Since, you know, that's normal and everything: gouge yourself on cookies, walk it off for a few blocks, and pick back up eating when you encounter fresh pizza and flaky shortbread cookies. Arizmendi's pizza was just what I needed to hit my sweet tooth reset button so that I could continue on perusing and eating my way through the Mission (literally).  In coming here around 1pm on a Friday, it was pleasant and enjoyable to sit at one of the tables and enjoy the hot food, followed by an immediate trip to their baked goods section where you can select whatever your little heart desires in paper bags.  The shortbread I had rivals some of the shortbread I had in London, except Arizmendi also has haute flavors that include lavender. I definitely would stop here for a quick bite and take in the cool open kitchen scene!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I went with my friend on one of the few sunny days of Christmas break. I tried the blueberry snail for $3, and it looked way better then it tasted. It was heavy and dense, kind of salty and overly carby dough, not enough blueberries and the cheese tasted not right, like its been left out a little too long. Also, the coffee cups are small for my taste, I reccomend going to Philz up the block.\n\n~Amazing score with the Ricciarelli cookie! Tastes like sweet, soft, and chewy almond pastethat melts in your mouth like cookie velvet, dusted with powdered sugar. It was a classy and flavorful cookie experience at $2.50 each, I took home 7 because it's a perfect coffee cookie in the morning. I lost with the blueberry snail, but scored with the Ricciarelli!

Arizmendi on Valencia went above and beyond to provide that! I walked in at around 11am and found that the shop was very crowded with people trying to get their pastry fix. Though it was crowded, the wait wasn't that long and when you got to the counter, a nice pleasant man was there to converse with you and ask you how you're doing. Nice! I was able to pick up a cheese roll, vegan berry scone, mixed berry scone, and a chocolate chip cookie all under $11.\n\nCheese Roll - Hm, I'm not sure if I picked the wrong cheese roll, but this seemed like a bagel with cheese on it to me. I guess the cheese rolls that I'm used to are the ones that can be found at Porto's! Nonetheless, the cheese roll (bagel) was very good, but a bit tough when cold. Definitely toast it!\n\nVegan Berry Scone - This was so dense, moist, and oh so delicious! The fact that it was in the shape of a real human heart was kind of funny, too. Anyway, the vegan berry scone definitely filled me up and was very satisfying! \n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - I don't think I've ever seen a bigger cookie than the ones at Arizmendi.. seriously! These chocolate chip cookies were so chewy and packed with tons of chocolate chips. So good, yet so bad!\n\nI didn't get to try the mixed berry scone.. or whatever it was because I gave it to someone, but I'm pretty sure that was delicious as well.

Well, let's just say I got the cold stare like I was asking the wrong question, and this was followed by an unusually long, irritated-like pause.  When the answer was finally recited (I'm pretty certain I'm not the only person asking the wrong question), it came out as an indifferent, unapologetic, and booming-like 'No.'\n\nOK then.  I'm sorry I asked.  I guess coffee with cream, sans the sweet stuff is going to have to do.  Talk about leaving a bitter taste in your mouth.

I thought, that's very potpourri of them. Nevertheless, the cookie was tasty. The sea salt did seem to overpower the overall taste though, in my opinion.\n\nThe cheese roll definitely has more cheese than bread. Their chocolate chip cookie is made w/dark chocolate chips, so although a tad bitter, the dough was sweet enough to offset it. The focaccia is always the perfect \"take home and put it in your toaster oven\" treat, and the pizza is \"the best stuff on earth\" per my friend.

I called the Valencia store today at 7am, right when they opened, and requested a large order of pizzas for our staff party later this afternoon.  The guy said not a problem.  Then I requested that one of the pizzas be made without cheese.  His tone completely changed and he said \"oh, we would not be able to modify our pizza\", with an inflection in his tone as if I were asking for him to do the impossible.  Really?  I'm about to order 6 pizzas and you can't leave the cheese off one of them?  I had even been told before by someone at the Sunset location that they would be happy to honor requests for dietary restrictions if such a request were made prior to them prepping and light baking all pizzas for the day.  Apparently this level of customer service is not offered by the Valencia location.

Otherwise, this is a great place to drop by for a slice.", "author": "Marlene T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-10", "description": "A daughter cooperative of Berkeley's Cheeseboard Collective- and a member of a larger collective that supports and coordinates the establishment of new Bay Area cooperative bakeries- Arizmendi is a pioneer in the indie eating scene. It stands at the forefront of the Bay Area's movements for environmentally-conscious food and for honest, democratic, \"equal and positive\" workspaces.\n\nInterestingly, my journey to this Arizmendi location began at the end of lunch at Cheeseboard Pizza one day. I finished my slice (Roma tomatoes, mozzarella and French feta cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil and cilantro) and immediately began to consider what I wanted to eat next. It was not that I was still hungry: the pizza was just so palatable, so filling, that I didn't know what possibly could appropriately follow.\n\nTo see if any establishment could match the quality of my beloved Cheeseboard, I decided to visit one of the younger bakery cooperatives I had read so much about, and selected the Valencia location because it's the youngest. \n\nUpon arriving at around 3:15pm, I found the bakery relatively quiet, but was greeted warmly by the counter person. The wall of windows topped with hoppers, the high ceilings, and the (basically) open floor plan really impressed me. Such comfortable features are common in more spacious locations like Berkeley but come as a pleasant surprise on busier urban streets. I purchased a couple of vegan mint chocolate chip cookies and packed them away. Benevolent and probably very satisfied with his position as a worker-owner, the counter person wished me farewell with a grin, and returned to joking around with the present members of the collective.\n\nI could not stop thinking about these beautiful vegan cookies, which had been showcased from behind clear glass doors in appealing wooden shelving units, so I devoured one while walking to meet a friend for dinner: a fantastic appetizer indeed! Ten minutes after my purchase, it still tasted like it had just come out of the oven. True to my expectations, it tasted impeccably.\n\nJust a couple of blocks from the BART station at 16th and Mission, this Arizmendi Bakery is accessible. With each cookie at $2 and each slice of pizza at $2.50, it is affordable. As a workers' collective, it's worth the consistent support of anyone who appreciates responsible business practices, organic ingredients, and really excellent fresh food. \n\nYou can read more about the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives at http://ow.ly/gGREe.", "author": "Brian C."}

(and still is) After that co-op came 2 and now a 3rd Arizmendi, named after a Basque priest and cooperatives organizer, happily near my place in the Mission.\n\nStopping by briefly on an early Saturday afternoon, I'm happy to report that they are off to a good start here. The building is spacious and spare. They were a bit light on the baked goods I've come to love (especially the Wolverine and the cheese rolls - I highly recommend them if you haven't tried), but it was after the morning rush, so I wasn't surprised either.\n\nHowever, it was an opportunity to try their pizza, and get something for my sweet tooth, and both made me confident that nothing that I love about these coops have changed in the newest store.\n\nFontina/feta cheese, mushroom, pesto pizza - \n\nPizza of the day. The crust was thin and perfect texture, the cheese aromatic, mushrooms lending a subtle earthy flavor, and the thyme and basil giving it an explosion of flavor. With all the fancy places like Baretta, Flour+Water, etc. serving pizzas, I'm happy to report that purely on taste, the pizza compares well. But of course, you get one choice. (That's socialism for you. But, you know, if the one pizza is what you want, all you need is one choice.)\n\nChocolate mint cookie -  \n\nAbsolutely delicious. It happens to be vegan, but it's not the reason you should get them.  They had a firm (almost crispy) outer edge, and was moist inside, with chocolate slightly gooey, and just a hint of mint. It's quite rich, so sharing one with a friend is a good idea.\n\nValencia has become a very strollable street, and it's ideal to pick up something to eat from here.  Worried about all the organic olive oil soaked crumbs falling on you or accidentally letting a drop of fair trade coffee hit you while you walk? No worries, you are in the Mission and wearing plaid and jeans. Brush it off without skipping a step and proceed on your journey to Dolores Park.\n\nAssuming the cheese roll and wolverines are as good as the other locations, I'd recommend them as well. To me, either with a cup of coffee is a great way to start the day, being open at 7 during the week, and 7:30 on the weekend, though they are closed on Monday, which sadly makes Monday that much more Mondayish. (though in the place, the menu on the wall says closed Tuesday instead, go figure) Check the website for breads and pizza schedules.", "author": "Boris C."}

Thankfully my appetite had been fully activated after a long walk through the hilly neighborhood.\n\nArizmendi is a worker-owned cooperative with a pervasive, unpretentious communitarian vibe.  Rather than choosing what I wanted, I narrowed my selections based on what I thought I MIGHT be able to live without...which wasn't much.  \n\nThe daily pizza selection is the foremost crowd-pleaser, and I've dutifully tried two different offerings:  artichoke and spinach, on my maiden visit, and Brussels sprouts, smoked Gouda, red chili and lemon oil on my second trip.  Both pizzas were astonishingly good, fresh, with a slightly blackened bread-like (sourdoughy?) crust.  Beyond taste, another key advantage for pizza-lovers is the by-the-slice option.\n\nBeyond pizza, I can also heartily recommend the magically moist cheese rolls and the sinfully soft chocolate chip cookies.  The bakery prepares an assortment of sweet and savory foccacias and flatbreads, and I decided an appropriate dessert was the pear and mixed berry foccacia, topped with an oat crumble.  The bread was a little too thick to support the subtle flavor of the fruit, but it was an interesting concept and well-worth trying.  Several varieties of muffins and scones, among other more unique baked curiosities, await for subsequent visits.\n\nSeating is limited but most people are interested in carry-out or eat-on-the-run, so I haven't had trouble securing a spot.", "author": "Derek W."}

Their cheese scones (on Sunday mind you, the newer Thursday versions, not so much), are what I measure potential mates by. Ask me, I'll explain.\n\nAnyway, I was excited that one was opening closer to me (only 6 miles walk RT instead of 9!), and went there soon after they opened. The cheese scones were not the same. Sometimes they were even a little spicy, though I haven't encountered that recently. But it seems that spicy ingredients are one of the trademarks of the Mission Arizmendi. Not being a lover of spicy food, this does not please me.  Many of their daily special breads and their pizzas contain spicy stuff and /or curry flavors. I generally dislike both.  So it makes me sad, because I love bread. \n\nI do like the \"X roll\" idea- their cheese roll but with a twist which changes daily. I don't like when that twist includes curry or chipotle, however. Damn.\nAlso good that they have a wheat free scone. I like that idea. It's pretty tasty, too.\n\nI wish they would have the scones with chocolate chips again.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_2_1FQO_DGzeCTky0x9DQA?select=S0FnqPQv8wSDx0jA5_gZ6w\n But seems to have gone away. Another damn.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this place? I have two: 1) They don't seem to list all the ingredients on their items, and sometimes this even extends to not knowing what they are selling. I.e. the X roll's sign is illegible and the counter person doesn't know what type of roll it is that day. and 2) The attitude. I don't know if it's because it's the Mission and they're just too cool for school or what, but it's not appealing. And to stand behind the counter chatting with coworkers when there's a big-ass line out the door and only one cashier who is slicing pizza rather than ringing up the line, well, not so fun. \n\nI would forego this place if my favorite Arizmendi were closer, but I don't always have the extra 45 minutes to walk the extra distance. Damn.\n\nOh, and to all the Mission yoga mommies taking a break from their hard day of mommy/baby yoga and shopping at Valencia boutiques- please keep your kids under control.

Last week Alan stopped by the Emeryville location, bringing home a couple of slices of delicious pizza and an oatmeal scone that seemed to have a hint of maple.  We shared the scone for breakfast and it was marvelous.\n\nYesterday we impulsively invited Nina over to share the corn chowder Tam had made, a couple of La Bedaine entrees and the last of the Bakesale Betty's chicken pot pie.  It's what we call a pickup dinner, an assortment of unrelated items from the refrigerator which gives each of us something different to eat.  Nina had spent the day in SF w/ friends who had introduced her to a cafe and bakery.  She was unsure of the names of the places, but as soon as she mentioned the chocolate thing I knew where she had been.  In addition to the chocolate thing, she had brought a bialy and a pumpkin/chili roll as her contribution to dinner.  I cut the bialy and the roll into quarters.  The chocolate thing was too sweet to have w/ dinner.  The bialy was probably the best I've tasted, chewy rather than doughy as too many are, w/ a generous and tasty amount of caramelized onions in the central depression.  The bialy alone was worth a trip back to Arizmendi.  The roll was dense and flavorful w/ a liberal sprinkling of pumpkin seeds on the top and sides.  It carried a nice strong undercurrent of chili flavor but w/o the heat.  I'd never tasted anything like it.  We were all pleased.\n\nBy the time we finished dinner there was no room for the chocolate thing, even for dessert.  Nina refused to take half home, so it will be my breakfast this morning.

The pizza varies between good to OK. Today on the way home, I stopped by the Valencia store and bought three slices to share with a friend. When I got my pizza i was not happy because it was way overcooked, but as we were hungry and I do not like to complain, I ate one piece, but it was so bad I  brought back the other two pieces and asked for ones that were not burnt, I was  then  told\" they look good to me\". I said, I strongly disagree and would like two other slices which were cooked OK but they still were not very good. I will pass on this shop in the future.", "author": "Cary F."}

This review is only for the pizza--it's near our house so sometimes we go pick up slices or a whole pie. I like that the pizza menu changes every day. However, the quality of the pizza (especially the crust) IMO is sub-par. All the times I've gotten their pizza it's been very oily, as if the pizza was almost pan fried. The crust is thin and doughy, if that's possible. And, the last time I got 2 slices for take out, the server packaged the slices together so that the toppings were facing the middle, creating an unfortunate \"pizza sandwich.\" Why?", "author": "Timothy V."}

And maybe it wasn't possible to live up to those expectations, but for whatever reason, the Arizmendi in the Mission is okay, but it's not great.  The pizza dough is too hard and it's not made with the same attention and love with which the Cheeseboard pizza is made.  Also, the service is really lazy and slow.  I tried to like this place, but have avoided it due to their slow service, combined with their average pizza and the stale pastries, displayed in an unappetizing way, all making this place not worth the often frustrating hassle.", "author": "Nadine K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-17", "description": "I'm torn between giving this place a 2.5 and a 3. Given that it is a bakery, which in my book means its part of the Land of Heavenly Carbs, I'll err on the side of generosity and give it a 3. If you've never been to the Arizmendi Bakery in the Sunset, then you're likely to judge this place as a 2. You get to be more generous if you start thinking of this place as Arizmendi Lite.\n\nWhy the discrepancy? If you've been to the Sunset store, then you start comparing this bakery's carbolicious treats to the original SF bakery (even though technically they're coops so they're separate from one another).  My fond memories for all the carb delights of the Sunset Branch color my opinion of this Mission branch's baked goods so that I automatically upgrade them a half a star to 3. \n\nI don't know if it's that this branch is still undergoing its growing pains having opened recently but the baked goods just don't taste as good as the Sunset store. In fact if I didn't have the Sunset store to help out, I'd rate this 2 stars. The cheese rolls don't taste as scrumptiously cheesy, the focaccia not as fluffy yet crispy,  and even the cookies are missing something because I don't experience the inner struggle against grabbing a large-sized cookie while waiting to pay at the register at the Sunset store. I have bought their Tahini cookie and am quite disappointed because it tastes burnt, not at all like the sesame its proclaimed to be made of. The X-Roll, which is essentially a Cheese Roll plus some x-factor like curry or corn actually manages to taste worse than the regular Cheese Roll because with the addition of another ingredient, the roll loses its cheese taste. I for one buy the Cheese Roll for the cheese. \n\nFor now, I'll still patron the store but only when I'm on the hunt for a carb fix but not motivated to the point of driving across the city to the Sunset. Or, I'll come here on Mondays when the Sunset store is closed. Please improve fast so I can be \"greener\" and save on the gas to the Sunset.\n\nThings to note\n1. Focaccia is sold by the slice, not by the pound like in the Sunset.\n2. Parking on the weekday mornings and early afternoons are easy. Parking in the evening (beginning at around 5:30 pm) gets to be tricky. Expect to circle a few - or more - times.\n3. CASH ONLY.\n4. Prices are about $0.25 more expensive than the Sunset.", "author": "Gwen L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-10", "description": "I'm so glad other people like this place.  But to me, the measure of a bakery is how good their bread is, not their cookies, pastries, or muffins.  Unfortunately, I am unable to tell anyone how their bread is -- because they don't bake in the morning!  I was told, quite snootily, when I went there at 7 to purchase a fresh loaf for the day, that they don't bake bread in the morning, that the first sourdough doesn't go in for an hour, and that they have other breads, but they go in later.  And the attitude was as if I should have known that. \n\nWell, to me, if a bakery doesn't have BREAD, it is not a bakery, it is a patisserie -- a pastry shop.  I bought nothing there and don't plan to, ever.  Their website also doesn't mention that they are closed on Tuesdays, nor does it mention this odd bread baking schedule.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-15", "description": "This review has been updated. I'm leaving it intact as there is a takeaway here for both customers and business owners.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nIt pains me to drop them to a 3, but not enough to not do it. I went last Saturday and ordered a couple slices, giving my name, Charles. Someone else ordered pizza as well. A few minutes later, the staffer serving the pizza put out a couple of slices and called out \"Joseph.\" Then \"Aaron\" (Erin?). But no Charles.\n\nThere didn't seem to be anyone else waiting for pizza, so I asked if they meant Charles. The staffer said the two slices were the only order for two slices, so it must be mine. I retrieved the two slices and put my tip in the jar.\n\nLet's be fair and say the slices were 4.5 stars, totally outstanding. Heirloom Tomato with Goat Cheese and fresh herbs. Deelicious. One of their best.\n\nBut \"Joseph\" is so far from \"Charles\" I wondered whether that was retaliation for not giving a tip at payment time. And no \"I'm sorry\" for the mistake either. That took some of the glow off the meal. \n\nIronically, another place that uses numbers let me have the wrong number. But they went out of their way to find me and also apologized for the error.\n\n\"I'm sorry\" is really important when you mess up. A lack of it gave me a bad association with this place, and that reduces my chances of returning, at least for a while.\n\nUpdate:\n\nMadeleine of Arizmendi wrote me to apologize. Apparently name mixups are not that unusual, so be aware if nobody seems to be claiming that pizza you are expecting to get but the name doesn't match. Anyway, they now realize it may be routine to them but not to the customer and are interested in customer service.\n\nSo I'm giving them back their star. Thanks, Madeleine. Looking forward to more of that luscious Arizmendi pizza.\n\nTakeaway for customers:\n\nWhat may seem like a slight may merely be a service glitch. Lighten up and enjoy your meal.\n\nTakeaway for owners:\n\nWhat may be a service glitch may be taken as a slight. Apologizing can keep a customer.", "author": "Charles B."}

Relatively thin crust, tasty ingrediants with a unique intersection of flazors, perhaps even citrusy at times... Granted I'm told the pies change daily.

The ppl at the front need serious ppl service skills, I went for the first time solely on yelp reviews. Also because I wanted to support the bakery that has donated to the Janet Pomeroy Center (a center for children and adults with developmental disabiities) which I have worked for. I figure I wanted to support them by making them a regular....yea that changed with the rude lady at the front who sounds like a total dude btw. I bought several scones and breads and she had the nerve to look at each in the bag! Like wth? lady, do you think I lied or something when I told her exaclty what I grabbed???, then I told her I wanted a receipt for my large purchase, and she didnt give me one. Then I asked if it was self serve coffee since it was my first time and I was confused, and she basically gave me a look of \"WTF? dont you see the coffee right there???\" So I gave up with this hell in a handbasket and asked the nice girl behind the counter making speciality drinks. She was nicer and made me my latte after I had to tell them twice for it, since Big Shoulder Maggie ignored me and didnt even give my order. Based on this experience I wll definitely not be a regular, and will not spread word of mouth about them. Unless I am in dire, desperate need for a scone orgasm, I problably wouldnt make the trip again! I have had waaayyy better service at Martha and Bros on Cortland than here, not worth the drive.", "author": "Christina M."}

Only once on a busy day did they get my pizza order mixed up, but other than that it's been smooth sailing, which deserves 5 stars. Sometimes I just come in for coffee which they run out of really fast, but that's okay, it's really good coffee!! My favorite things to get here are the wheat-free carrot muffin, which doesn't seem that popular compared to the other pastries, but i have had them all and this one is the BEST!! I also love the riccarelli cookie, an almondy sticky cookie with powdered sugar on top - omg!!! Everything else is delicious, too, but these are my personal favs. The staff is really kind and patient. I also love that this place is a co-op - seems like everyone enjoys their job and is having fun :) The atmosphere is a large, open, clean space. I like when i come in and they're playing hip hop, but they keep it pretty mixed with the music they play. My favorite bakery and breakfast spot! The pizza is good, too, but breakfast is my meal of choice here.", "author": "Caitlin V."}

The daily fruit scone is always delicious, and the cherry/corn meal scone is wicked good! Also check out these little mexican named cookies (starts with an \"r\" ). They are almond flavor, crusty on the outside, soft inside, dusted with powdered sugar pieces of heaven. Outstanding!! Haven't tried their more savory goods yet, but everything we've had has been amazing, so I'm sure that the pizzas are great too. Note that this isn't a place to go hang out, but rather pick up and go (few tables around, but not really a chill out place; not sure about the other locations); we recommend dropping by to pick up these goodies and then cruise down the street to Ritual to get your coffee on and head home to enjoy!!", "author": "Artina M."}

This worker owned cooperative also has a location by 9th and Irving St. Compared to the tiny location by 9th, this has it's huge doors open and huge windows that give enough natural light inside. Roomy atmosphere with a coupe of tables to sit at, and the chance to see them bake from the back. This bakery has baguettes, baked goods, pastries, and pizza! They have an amazing selection of different baked goods and sweets such as; corn meal cherry scones,  vegan banana nut muffins, pecan rolls, cookies, granola and muffins. They also serve great pizza. Each day they serve a different pizza, which is served right out of the oven 11:30AM, you can check their daily menu on their website calendar. Through out the day they'll bake new ones, but I suggest you go early so it's hot and fresh. Usually their pizza base is a thin sourdough crust with mozzarella. Although they don't add meat to any of their toppings, carnivores can use this opportunity to try a good vegetarian pizza. Not that I am one but they even offer vegan baked goods and sweets too.  You can buy slight baked pizzas to go so you can finish baking them your self. I believe the 9th and Irving location does their pizza slightly better, but their baked goods are just as good. So next time if you want a 1 2 punch carb combo of pizza for lunch and a scone for dessert, try Arizmendi!", "author": "Shane M."}

There appear to be a few early wrinkles to be ironed out -- the cheese roll I had was a bit dry, and the jalapeno-cheese loaf I got a few days ago was undercooked -- but on other visits I've had nothing but winners in the cherry corn scone, currant scone, and shortbread. The olive bread was an unexpected delight; it was rockin' some moist, flavor-bursting olives that really elevated the loaf of bread into a standalone treat.", "author": "Eugene P."}

However, I do wish they would step up their pizza toppings. I find Cheeseboard (their step-sister collective in Berkeley) to have consistently tastier and more interesting pizza topping combos. If you go to Arizmendi- do expect great pastries, nice folks and a community feel- also you might get a pizza with walnuts, gorgonzola and onions. Where're the tasty veggies, guys?! Also, they really need to add more seating. Four tables is just not enough for the crowds in the morning.", "author": "Kika S."}
