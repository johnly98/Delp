A city known for the best Asian food in the country and this is the kinda thing that you get.  Sheesh..  \n\nIm sure nobody in the back of the house went to culinary school, so maybe they'll read this and get something from it. \n\nThe walnut prawns are soggy and the batter is not cooked through.  Thats right - RAW DOUGH.  That means your batter is too think.  You can only fry a large shrimp for 3-5 minutes so you have to think the batter down and you're using too much cornstarch.  \n\nDumplings in spicy sauce - after you make the dumpling filling you're freezing them.  When you are steaming them, they're getting over cooked because they're boiling from the inside out. \n\nCrab puffs:  They're soggy because you're togo container is sealed and they are steaming inside the container until they get to the customer.  STOP DOING THAT. \n\nChicken wings -  same story.  cooked once,  frozen,  refried before sent to customer.   \n\nThis place is a total joke.

I had called when I ordered from Mandarin months ago, but apparently the person I spoke to either misunderstood or didn't know. Knocking off two stars since this was the item I had liked so much.\n\n\nNot my typical format since I ordered delivery.\n\nFood: Extensive vegan option and great tasting vegan Chinese food. I came home from a jog and was super hungry, so I ordered A LOT of food... I had salt and pepper tofu, meatless Kung Pao chicken, and meatless General Tso's chicken. If this food were a person, we'd be best friends. The salt and pepper tofu was super spice (I ordered it spicy) and delicious. They use large chunks of peppers and onions, and tiny pieces of garlic. The fried tofu cubes were tender and tasty. The Kung Pao meatless chicken was super yummy, though I wasn't a fan of the meatless meat. The mouthfeel was a little off. The sauce was amazing though, and the peanuts were delicious. My favorite was the General Tso's chicken. It was absolutely fantastic. Mouthfeel was so disturbingly similar to chicken that I cut a piece open and inspected it. Nope, it was definitely a mixture of batter and no meat. But wow - the sauce and texture was perfect. I also had an order of veggie spring rolls and a side of white rice. Next time, I'll pass on the spring rolls entirely - they weren't all that tasty compared to the mains and the other appetizer.\n\nService: Super friendly and helpful. Since I've had bad experiences with other places, I called ahead to ask about the delivery service. They use Eat24 delivery service. The delivery was on time and super easy.\n\nOverall, 5 stars. I know this will be my go-to Chinese place. I'm happy to have found an excellent place to order vegan Chinese food, and have it delivered!!", "author": "Shannon H."}

Shockingly found mandarin house and decided to give it a go. On a Sunday afternoon, I ordered my food for delivery on 2:11pm. I received my fresh and piping hot (emphasis on FRESH & PIPING HOT) food after 37 minutes, which is really not a bad wait time at all.\n\nSeafood tofu soup: \nIt's only for two people max. There was a good ratio of soup to seafood and tofu. Tons a little tofu pieces yummm.  \n\nBbq pork fried rice: \nI like to base how good fried rice is the color of the rice (white rice means there's not much flavor) and the flavor profile in all. There was tons of flavor with the BBQ pork fried rice. Big plus bc it was still hella hot when I got my food. \n\nGeneral tsao chicken: \nAt first glance, I thought my general tsao chicken was burnt lol. But don't be fooled. It's actually the dark delicious tangy sauce that they mix the moist, well cooked chicken. It's really easy to over cook chicken but they did a really good job at making sure the chicken was cooked properly. \n\nThis place doesn't give shitty service at all so that's a huge plus. The food is a bit overpriced compared to other Chinese restaurants but you are paying for quality. This is probably my go to Chinese food delivery now. Yay.", "author": "AJ C."}

My husband immediately felt sick to his stomach after two bites. He literally wanted to vomit it out. The sweet and sour soup is gross with no flavor but pure salt water and the dim sum taste super hard and stale-like microwaveable frozen food or food left out for days. I spit it out immediately!!! We cannot eat nor touch this food. The delivery guy was also super aggressive when demanding (not asking) for a cash tip upon delivery. Honestly, this is the last time I order delivery. If can't see the establishment or see how they operate in person, I won't bother ordering from them. This was a terrible experience.

Probably the cleanest Chinese restaurant I've ever been in.\n\nThere was an endless stream of takeout when I went there tonight, so there must be *something* worth eating here. I can't figure out what that might be though.\n\nWe were a party of two, and neither of us enjoyed any of what we had. The service was S-L-O-W. Everything was completely lacking in any sort of flavor - the \"spicy\" garlic eggplant was way overcooked, incredibly mushy, and didn't taste like garlic or have any sort of spice to it whatsoever - it was mild as mild gets. The Singapore noodles tasted like onion and something that I couldn't quite put my finger on - neither my dining partner nor I could stomach more than a bite or two of it - and we had to force down those bites. \n\nThe pork bun was probably the most edible; but the filling was completely lacking in any flavor. The General Tsao's chicken had the most flavor, but it all seemed a bit like mystery meat.\n\nI guess I should have figured that this place wouldn't be very good, simply because it was mostly American Chinese staples, but even compared to other American Chinese places, it was pretty terrible.

They're crunchy and delectable. I wished I ordered it a little spicier. The dish also had delicious peppers, onions and a tasteful layer of vinegar sauce.\n\n-Dry braised chicken wings are bomb. Crunchy and juicy, like how a cannibal would describe eating your ears. Hmmm, not a good comparison. But you can't really get anything wrong with wings. They also added jalapenos and onions to it, giving it another brand of flavor. \n\nWhat sucks is that because this is a new restaurant, you don't really know what's hot and what's not.

After 10 minutes my fianc\u00e9 couldn't find him so I went down with the baby in the stroller. As I was making my way downstairs the delivery man called again, this time raising his voice telling me how confusing my apartment building is and I explained that's why I left specific directions. He began yelling louder over me so I told him to just leave if he was going to be disrespectful. I still went downstairs to where he claimed to be and no one was there. I went back home upset and called Eat24 whom provided a full refund and were just as appalled as I was. I later got an email from Eat24 stating that the delivery man was the OWNER and claimed my food was delivered and wanted me to be charged. Well I don't know who you delivered to pal because I never got my food. Luckily Eat24 took my side. The owner mentioned he will never serve me again, which is fine by me.

I've order the garlic broccoli, combo fried rice, combo chow mein, salt and pepper pork chops, BBQ pork buns, general tsao chicken, basil chicken, pot stickers, spicy house fried rice, and the double mushrooms w/ baby bok choy. Everything as been hot when delivered in 45 minutes (I've only done delivery), nothing is greasy, and everything has independent and great flavor. Seriously some I the best Chinese food I've ever had!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

I placed 1 order of combo won ton soup and chicken chow fun. I agreed to pay tip in cash, but when the driver came, I forgot...and the driver did not let me forget about his tip. Before he stepped out the car, he looked at my hands and saw me not reachin for cash. His automatic response was, \" it says you tip cash\" after he heard me say,\" oh no i forgot, is there any way to add onto it through my phone? \"He looked at me and gave me one of the meanest stares ever. HE SAID, \"NO, NOT POSSIBLE!\" I asked him to check and he went back to the car with the food and brought out the paper and pen. Told me to add tip here and sign. I said i was sorry about the cash and he did not reply back to me...no words. He just went back into his prius and left! I totally get that you are mad about me not having cash on hand. But it was easily fixable. ( which was after I got the email confirmation). I am usually very turned off by people who EXPECT A TIP, in this case, i was at fault so i obliged with a decent amount for him.\n\nOnto  what was wrong with the food- \n\nMy chow fun was half spilled into the bag. I guess the person packing didnt clasp the plastics well enough while it was en route to my home. It was bland and greasy! Yes, chow fun in itself is greasy, but this was an additional amount.  I could taste the oil.more than the salt amount! They did give a good amount, but again, no flavor. \n\nI asked for a spoon and chopsticks and chili sauce. \n\nNo spoon, no chopstick..no chili sauce....but 2 forks... how do I eat soup with no spoon? \n\nSoup- bland, greasy, and you can totally taste the msg in this soup. Msg will ruin your food and bones!\n\nI will never order from this restaurant ever again! \n\nBLAND, CARELESS PACKAGING, NO CONDIMENTS, WRONG UTENSILS, MSG. DRIVER WAS SCARY AND RUDE. ALL BAD.", "author": "Teeds K."}

The Green Onion Pancake wasn't bad, but had almost NO onion in it.

This morning I got distracted by this new Future mixtape and didn't place my order right away. They just opened though so how busy could they be?\n\n11:15am: I'd give this hangover 3/5 stars. I've definitely felt worse. \n\n11:29am: WHOA. My food has arrived. How is that even possible? Very impressed. Let me switch the music up and settle in for this meal.\n\n11:32am: The \"Chef's special pea sprouts with fish filet\" is really good. The fish is a rock cod, I believe, and it's perfectly cooked. The pea sprouts are fresh, tender and delicious.\n\nThis other thing...what is this thing...the \"Sahd pepper meatless chicken\" is so fucking disrespectful. It's just fried meatless chicken with no sauce tossed in a plastic box with a few jalape\u00f1o slices and a little (very little) bit of chopped peppers & onion. It's flavorless af. Like, imagine Mitt Romney trying to dance. No flavor. How is this even a recipe? Did they forget a step? I'm desperately seeking out the jalape\u00f1o slices just so my tastebuds can experience *something*. I could give this zero stars and still feel the urge for petty revenge.\n\n11:38am: Pea sprouts are underrated; I wish I saw them on menus more often.\n\n11:54am: Really mixed feelings about this meal. Delivery time was 5/5 but my two dishes were 4/5 and 1/5. Even if I assume that \"Sahd pepper\" is some extraordinary typo and this was supposed to be \"salt and pepper\" meatless chicken it was still complete trash and would rank in my Top 1 worst salt and pepper dishes ever.\n\nI'll give them a shot again next time and see if the food is better.
