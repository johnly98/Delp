Since the Sentinel is so close by here, it almost feels like blasphemy to go to a \"regular\" sandwich shop when I can have the sweet taste of corned beef or rare roast beef from the Sentinel less than two blocks away.\n\nBUT, I never can say no to a good sandwich and when my coworker told me about Sammy's existence, I initially was hesitant.  I already at least six sandwich places in my rotation so seven is a bit much because it faces some pretty stiff competition.  I went there on a Thursday with an open mind.\n\nIn certain respects, Sammy's is not so well known...there isn't a huge long line out the door like Algiers or the Sentinel.  They also don't do salads like Cafe Venue so I don't need to be delayed by all of the leaf eaters.  They have about ten specialty sandwiches as well as make your own option as well.  Cheese and double meat are extra.  I saw bologna as one of the meats on their Italian sandwich and since I haven't bologna since I was nine years old in third grade, I thought why not?\n\nThe line didn't take too long as the somewhat small lunch counter that they use pumped out sandwiches quickly.  I wanted dutch crunch but they had already run out and it was only 12:30!  Even on sourdough, the sandwich was pretty good and the bologna...well I didn't really taste since I had salami in my sandwich which just overwhelms everything else.  I also really liked how they cut and wrapped the sandwich.  They did it in plastic wrap and they did a clean cut through the middle so that you don't have to cut it yourself.  \n\nGood bread, good sandwich, relatively fast wait time.  Probably the only drawback is that it's a bit more expensive than what I prefer.  Cafe Algiers is still the cheapest sandwich around by a dollar to two dollars and this place has most of their sandwiches priced at around $9.

I was finished with my meal by the time I probably would have gotten my Sisig order.

I ordered the Italian Hoagie which consists of an Italian Triple Threat, salami, mortadella and ham on sourdough.

I did have a hard time wrapping my mouth around the width of the sandwich but I managed.  I really like that they have both peperoncinis and jalapenos, it adds a little kick to the sandwich.  I also liked the oil and vinegar.  \n\nWhat I didn't like - if anyone has had the opportunity of traveling to Italy, one knows that the key to a good Italian styled sandwich is the thin slices of meat.  The mortadella and ham were both sliced entirely too thick for my taste.  I also ordered extra mayo because I don't like a dry sandwich and while I am not sure she if she fulfilled my request, the sandwich was a little dry and did not appear to have the \"extra\" mayo that I requested.\n\nBottom Line - Once you get down to the overall taste of the sandwich, it is just a basic sandwich, not at all worth the nearly $10.00 I spent.", "author": "Aisha M."}

There are a variety of other meats, salads, and sides available. \n\nThe only downside I noticed was that they charge for cheese on your sandwich and I'm slightly annoyed that the guy didn't mention it to me at all until I asked why my total was so high when paying (almost $9 with tax for what I thought was a $6.99 +tax meal). It would be nice for them to mention it while you're making your sandwich so you can avoid the charge if you don't really care for cheese.\n\nI'm definitely a fan and will likely be back.

Try the roast beef, salami or any one of their hoagies and discover how grubbin' they are.\n\nServed on excellent soft french roll, sourdough slice or roll or dutch crunch, their sandwiches are a great deal and just flat our rock.  Take a look at their sides, salads and Greek food options, they're sure to have something that fits your appetite.\n\nAlso, remember to get a \"Buy 9 Sandwiches and the 10th is FREE\" card if you're a returning customer.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

I got the veggie sandwich on Dutch crunch, along with the soup of the day. With better bread, it would easily be 4 stars, but none of us actually liked the bread that much - maybe it was just today's batch, but it was extremely chewy, unlike any Dutch crunch I've had before. The rest of the sandwich (construction + choice of cheeses/veggies) and the soup was quite good for the price. We'll probably try it again at some point, but this first visit didn't get us hooked.", "author": "Vinay B."}

They are truly a hole in the wall/mom and pop sandwich and convenience store.

I can't really stomach Subway anymore because their ingredients don't taste as fresh.  Sammy's has all fresh veggies and they get their bread delivered every day.  They also offer awesome combo meals for less than $10.  They have a deli type area where they sell empanadas, Pierogis, tuna salad or chicken salad, and different pasta salads.
