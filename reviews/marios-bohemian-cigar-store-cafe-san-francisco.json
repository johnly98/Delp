A friend recently asked for dining recommendations in SF and this was the first place that came to mind. \n\nThe Meatball Sandwich is probably one of the BEST meatball sandwiches I've ever had the joy of scarfing down. I don't know what it is about it but my God I think about that sandwich all the time. \n\nThe Resturant itself if a bit small so I wouldn't head here with a party of 6 or more, but if it's just you and one or two others this is the place to be. Inside the decor is amazing, you feel as if you've stepped into another universe. Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the food because I've always been too hungry to even stop and pull out my camera.  \n\nMario's is close to City Lights Booksellers, a total bonus if you ask me. \nDrop in, try the Meatball Sandwich, pretend you're in Italy for a little while and leave satisfied.", "author": "Ashlee P."}

You can set your watch by it, so to speak. \n\nThank God, the Creator, the Great Mystery, the Universe or whatever you want to call it, that almost nothings changed in 50 years. Well, I guess the price has changed. \n\nAbout every 10 or 12 years I change it up a bit and get it's twin, I'm a Gemini, the hot meatball sandwich. But it's a major struggle to change my favorite sandwich in North Beach, the hip, Italian section of San Francisco with a little Chinatown and Post Beatnik flavor added. Sure, I'm a Gemini, 1\u00b0 in fact, so I'm changing by the minute. But it takes a lot of effort to switch up and order a meatball version which is probably equally as good, but a guy has to, and should have a strong moral set of values. Hey, they got me through 50 years of 180\u00b0 changes and I have landed right side up in San Francisco, a Gemini city. And I landed, not on Boardwalk or Park Place, but on Bingo!

This is one of my favorite spots in San Francisco for a variety of reasons. Their focaccia sandwiches are excellent, if you're looking for something hot and hearty. Their salads are delicious if you're looking for something healthy or light. (hey, it happens). If you like sweets: they have a superb tiramisu. And they have house wines and espresso if you're looking to just hang out and sip on something. The location, inside and out, is ideal for people watching.

Everything I've ever ordered from their menu has been delicious, but when I go to specifically enjoy some quiet time by myself I always get my preferred solid pairing: a sausage sandwich (the one w/ the lovely Liguria Bakery focaccia, not the panini) and a glass or half carafe of red wine (depending on how long I plan on soaking in the ambiance/watching the parklife/reading a book).

The night was ruined by a deplorable server. Since the server did not introduce himself, he will be known as Man Bun. Man Bun was rude from the moment he came to ask \"do you know what you want?\" My friend had questions about the beers and he referred her to the menu instead of answering her question. \n\nIronically, considering this is a \"cigar store cafe,\" I was told rudely to put out the cigarette I was smoking in their outdoor seating area. I was told I was \"disrespectful\" by Man Bun. I completely understand a location not allowing smoking, which is fine, but when the server barks at you and calls you disrespectful while your trying to enjoy your evening at their establishment, it's completely unacceptable. \n\nMan Bun comes back within a few minutes to drop off the check. We did not ask him for the check, we had each had 1 drink and were not asked if we would like anything else.\n\nMy guest personally went up to Man Bun and asked him if he was having a bad day. He proceeded to complain about the fact that I smoked a cigarette outside and she let him know he was short and rude prior to that incident. He charged our cards and said no more. \n\nLater that evening and the next morning, I tried to call in and speak to a manager. Man Bun answered both times. The first time I asked for a manager, he said he was the manager, thanked me for my concern and hung up. The second time I called, the next morning, he answered and started chewing loudly on the phone.\n\nVery disappointed in the quality of service.

When I walked into the Cafe, the guy that primarily prepares the food asked me what I'd like and if I'd like to see a menu. I told him that I didn't need a menu and just wanted a glass of Chianti.  He poured the wine, and I gave him a $20 bill.  i thought it was weird that he didn't tell me how much the wine was, but I figured that he would be honest about what he charged me and that he would give me a receipt. \n\nI took a sip of my wine while waiting for my change, and when he handed me the change (without a receipt by the way), it was only $1.25 in change. He then walked into the kitchen to work on food. That's $18.75 for a basic glass of wine. Only the most super overpriced upscale restaurants have the audacity to charge those prices.  \n\nI grabbed a menu which clearly indicated that a glass of Chianti was $8.  The kitchen guy kept himself busy in the kitchen and ignoring me, so I told the waiter that i only got $1.25 in change when i gave a $20 bill for a glass of wine. The kitchen guy was listening in by this point. The waiter looked at the kitchen guy with a frustrated and angry look, and just grabbed a $10 bill out of the register and gave it to me.  The kitchen guy looked meekly at the waiter and then me and pretended that it was an accident.  \n\nSure it's hard to prove exactly the intent, but all I can say is that he had the guilty look of someone who had been caught. Frankly, I believe this guy thought he could get away with it since i hadn't looked at the menu for the prices, he didn't bother giving me a receipt (receipts are a normal practice for this place), and he probably thought that I was a tech guy that didn't care about money.

Back in the day, Food & Wine magazine put the breaded eggplant sandwich @ Mario's on their list of \"the 10 things you MUST eat when you're in SF.\"  This was way, WAY before 7x7 magazine came out w their first list, since 7x7 magazine didn't even exist then.  I had to mention this because there are so many newbie \"foodies\" out there that actually don't know that there were lists like this & that there was a thriving food scene in SF long before \"the 7x7 list\" ever appeared.  Even worse, there are droves of people that use the 7x7 list as the deciding factor on where & what to eat in this town.  And that's just sad.  SF has been cranking out exceptionally noteworthy food forever, & Mario's has been doing it from day one.\n\nThe skinny...\n\nYes, they used to sell cigars.  Heck, the place used to be filled w smoke when you walked in, when smoking inside was still legal.  When the non-smoking law started, they still sold cigars, just no more smoking.\n\nAn espresso here is iconic.\n\nThey make a mean cappuccino.  It's written up in guide books everywhere.  We're talking internationally.  \n\nThe breaded eggplant is just as awesome now as it was way back when.  Only now many peeps seem to love the grilled eggplant just as much.  I say yes to both; let your mood decide or order a 1/2 of each.\n\nStandouts...\nThe meatball.  The sausage.  The chicken.  The combo (ham & salami).  The turkey.  The tuna.  The veggie.  Yes, they're actually all great.  No joke.  Basically, if you haven't had a focaccia sandwich from Mario's, preferably right out of the oven & piping hot w the requisite pepperoncinis...then you just haven't lived.  And that's their focaccia sandwich out of the OVEN; NOT a panini w regular baguette bread from the panini press.  There's just no comparison.  Trust.\n\nThe house made tiramisu is THE BEST in NB.  No contest.\n\nSometimes the service is great, sometimes it's not great.  But the tunes playing are always great.  Always.

What kind of a place in North Beach can justify offering a whopping total of TWO wines, without any clarification of year or vintner until we prodded further and asked for a bottle. \n\n[UPDATED 3/15/13: It looks like they might have improved their menu a bit.  Also, since I last dined there, I've noticed that many TV shows with episodes or scenes that are meant to be set in SF tend to show the facade of Mario's Bohemian. I wonder if they think this is the ideal representation of our diverse city. If so, how disappointing. There was even an episode of House of Lies that had a scene with Jeannie (Kristen Bell) hooking up with a musician there. Well, it was a version of Mario's that looked nothing like the real thing.]\n\nIn reality, the best thing about this place is its location and proximity to Washington Square Park.

He brought me a port with hot water in it because he said, \"This is what I have when my nose is running.\" Sure enough, it cleared up my nose for the entire day. I'm sure if I didn't bury myself in my book there would've been much more chatting going on. I'll have to thank him for the runny nose cure and catch his name next time I stop in. I didn't feel rushed but since it was starting to get busy I figured I should get going since I had finished eating.\n\nI know this place is small so I never bring more than 3 other people with me max.

Drinks weren't complicated, 2 draft beers and 2 glasses of wine. \n\nWe're started to get antsy, bummed that are incredible dinner out can end like this, but finally the server comes over with....the dessert. Where do you serve food before drinks? When asked if we could get the drinks, the server replied \"as you can see, we are really busy tonight.\" There are 5 tables, so if that's busy....well, we have problems. \n\nAt any rate we wait...and...wait for the drinks. Why start eating dessert when you have no liquid to wash it down? Drinks were the highlight because two of the three desserts were unedible. The chocolate cake was dry and tasted like a cake from Cosco. My ricotta cheesecake was reminiscent of a quiche, eggy tasting and like the chocolate cake, dry. I took one bite and pushed it the side. Tiramisu that my friend ordered was decent.\n\nServer came by about 15 minutes later and I told him I didn't enjoy the cake. He said, \"it's supposed to taste that way, it has ricotta.\" OK, but the point is I don't like it. Bill comes with cheesecake charged on it.

I thought Mario's would be a great place to reconnect this week with a former colleague who had labored with me in the pits of an S.F. PR company. \n\nThings were off to a good start - we ordered Pellegrino and panini and enjoyed the view of the park. Then a young blonde woman came in with two children; the girl was probably 5, the boy may have been 7. \n\nThe kids got rambunctious immediately, started yelling and pulling on a bearded guy who was wearing suspenders. The kids completely disrupted the place and wouldn't stop. The mother didn't seem to care; she may have been a regular. And most importantly, the people managing behind the bar didn't seem to care. \n\nIt was 4:30 pm. Mario's is not a daycare or a public park. No one attempted to rein in these kids and show them a little of how to behave at a restaurant.\n\nWe hurried up our meal and paid. I respectfully mentioned to the barkeep that we had wanted to stay longer but the rambunctious, screaming  (I used different words0 kids were not what we had come for. She seemed annoyed with me and suggested that I mention it to the mother which I had considered but thought could be disastrous and fuel a bar fight.\n\nIt's management's call to ensure that Mario's is a place that can be enjoyed by all its customers. Considering that Mario's is an establishment that serves beer and wine, management must ensure that it's a relaxing environment for adults to relax and enjoy the food and a good conversation.\n\nSometimes if a parent cannot or will not parent appropriately to manage their children in a public place, it is management's duty to step in and gently divert the kids, and help to model for the parent appropriate expectations for their children's behavior in a public establishment.\n\nThe cliquishness among the people behind the bar and their tolerance for this obnoxious, disruptive behavior suggests to me that the owners need to step in and remind employees how good restaurant management needs to work.", "author": "Cat S."}

The kitchen is really just an oven. It's remarkable that the food is so good. The meatball Sammie is delectable and the caprese was fantastic. Wine and beer were good too. But depending on how many people are actually present when you arrive your experience would vary a lot. We sat outside waited a really long time for a menu. Ordered and waited a really long time for our food. We finally found a table inside and moved in. Service was way better inside. BF said that there was only one waitress but really I don't think customer service should be affected because of the owners understaffing. Some people came in after us and were seated right away, I'm sure they had a 4-5 star experience. Food was good. If you have a lot of time to kill come here and relax and enjoy a meal.

OK, maybe not Steps of Rome because they lick your neck there. Well, not mine, but Rachael Ray's, I think, on that $40-a-Day-Cause-I'm-Too-Rich-to-Tip show. Oh my gravy.\n\nBut back to Mario's. Big bar, little tables inside, a few more outside.

Yet again sparked by a complete stranger's adoration of this place on \"Check Please! Bay Area\", Jamie W. and I went to see what the fuss was about.

That's it.\n\nWe went for splitting two paninis, both in the $7.50-$8.50 range (see my photos). The verdict is that the salami was really good, and the chicken one a little too dry. But the bread was nice and crunchy. It comes with no extras except for a couple of pepperoncinis - which was a bit disappointing since I never turn down fries. We decided to order the $6 Caprese, which consisted of four thick, somewhat unripened tomato slices with a slab of mozzarella and a dollop of fresh basil pesto (see my photo). All in all, it's a good snack place but nothing much more than that except for a great spot overlooking Washington Square.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good, toasty paninis but nothing extraordinary here\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...feels like a good paisan's hangout\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly enough, not as indifferent as I was expecting\nTOTAL - 3 stars...the small servings bring this one down a little...also the easy-to-screw-up name with three nouns in a row...make up your mind!", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-05", "description": "It turns out that this is my sister's favorite cafe in San Francisco, and she'd been hiding it from me for almost 10 years!  Since she introduced me to Mario's, I find myself drawn back here every time I want to sit with a friend over coffee and dessert or a sandwich without having to deal with the rough, misanthropic crowd over at Cafe Trieste or the overly bright lighting at Mara's.  Mario's feels intimate, definitely Bohemian, maybe a little sexy.  It's your secret hideaway in plain sight.  \n\nThe cafe mochas here are delicious, rich, not made with cheap chocolate like at so many other places in the area, but something smooth and tasty.  The crunchy focaccia sandwiches are delish, if perhaps a tad pricier than expected for \"just a sandwich\" (giving me a pepperoncini or two with it doesn't really count in my book, especially since I don't even like them).  There are better sandwiches out there, but these tasty.  \n\nBut best?  Is the homemade tiramisu.  YUM.  Seriously?  It's the BEST in the city, even *gulp* better than mine (and I make a MEAN tiramisu!!!  Just ask my friends...).  Who would've thought I'd find it here in what is essentially a cross between an Italian coffee shop and Hernando's Hideaway?!!\n\nI think this is a great place for a first date.  Or catching up with an old friend.  It's not well suited to larger groups, because it's actually kind of a tiny place, narrow and a bit cramped, although I HAVE seen folks trying to fit 6-7 people at what is really a four-top.  \n\nIf you're in a WHEELCHAIR, this place might be a bit too frustrating to try to maneuver around, and I'm not sure how accessible the bathroom is, since I didn't visit on any of the times I was here.\n\nJust writing this review has made me think about going back to Mario's for another round of cafe mocha and tiramisu...mmmm....!!!!", "author": "Amy L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-30", "description": "The place is a rustic looking bar, located in an odd shaped corner, with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking Washington Square park. It's a great local cafe, well suited for lingering while sipping on your cup of cappuccino, latte, or wine (or whatever you like to drink), and enjoying the view of the park and the people that walk by. Despite the name they don't sell cigars here (they just kept the name).\n\nTheir menu includes focaccia and panini sandwiches, a few salads, pizza, a few hot dishes (cannelloni, lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, polenta with sausage), coffees and bar drinks (beer, wine, etc.). Surprisingly, they have a lot of vegetarian options in the menu. I like the focaccia sandwiches. They are open-faced, so it's more like getting 2 'mini pizza' (they sell personal pizzas also), with the toppings and melted cheese on top of the delicious+toasted+fluffy focaccia bread (from the famous Liguria bakery). I have tried the chicken #1, meatball with marinara and onions, and the veggie. Sandwiches are $9.75, and the half sandwiches are $5.50. It's a little pricey for sandwiches, but this is an expensive tourist area, so it goes with the territory.\n\nAnd don't forget to get a slice of cake for dessert ($4). I like their homemade Ricotta Cheese Cake - this is not a \"cheesecake\", this is a cake that has cheese in it. Let me explain, think of this like a moist cake with a built-in custard in the bottom part. Their chocolate cake is good too.\n\nThe place is usually busy, and they use a small oven to make all the sandwiches, so the wait for food could be long (like I said before: good for lingering). If there are no seats available, I recommend that you place the order to go, come back in 10-15 minutes to pick it up, and enjoy a picnic in the park across the street.\n\n*******************\nAdditional tip:\nFYI, if you prefer a cheaper sammie instead (not grilled, no focaccia), you could go to Petite Deli (~$6, ciabatta bread, long wait time also) which is only 3 blocks away from Mario's down Columbus Ave, past the WS park (PD closes at 4pm M-F/ 3pm Sat, closed on Sundays). And while you're at PD, maybe get some yummy chocolate truffles next door at XOX Truffles (XOX closes at 6pm).", "author": "Luis C."}

But after the last few visits here I've decided this place is kind of shit.\n\nFirst off, there's no seating. Heaven forbid you arrive in a group with more than two people and have to cram yourselves in one of their tiny ass tables. To be honest, their tables aren't even that small. There's just no place to walk hence, no room to pack four chairs around a table that could easily sustain a small group of people. If there is a fire, you will fucking die. \n\nI get it, it's San Francisco and space is expensive. If you come on your lonesome or on a date though the space isn't that much of an issue.  Come in with a small group of friends and you'll get some eye rolls from one of the waiters aka wanna-be-king of hipsters, Moustachio ( Epic stache and epic douche ) Anyways, you'll know who I'm talking about when you see him. \n\nFood is pretty pricey considering how little you get. For $8 you can get a tiny ass sandwich with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. That's it. They won't even spring for a handful of potato chips because fuck you. They give you a couple pepperoncini's though.  \n\nI think the part that really irks me about this place is the service. \n\nI get it people have bad days and sometimes their service is a bit off. I'm just going to get straight to the point here and say the waiters here are simply bitches. No, they aren't having a bad day because Urban Outfitters burned down and they don't know where else to buy Holga film.\n\nThey're just bitches.\n\nMoustachio can't hear your requests for service over his unnecessary facial hair. He hates giving soda refills too because carbonated water and 5 cents worth of syrup is a total scam. \n\nThere's another chick that works there that acts like she is so inconvenienced because she has customers to service- ironic considering we are the reason she has a fucking job. She slammed a cup of coffee once on our table and then sauntered over to Moustachio to faun over how large and thick his moustache is. Giggling and twirling the ends of her upper lip facial hairs that someday hope to become as hipster-y as Moustachio. \n\nShe's a bitch. He's a bitch.

The ingredients are ok (the foccacia is nice of course), but it's cooked in that little oven and mine got singed and smokey, which was not good. I liked that they had a half-sandwich offering ($5.50 rather than $9.75), but they didn't mention the half is open-faced - not bad, just something I'd like to have known. The beer selection was fairly limited. I would recommend going one block over and getting an excellent meatball sandwich (or spectacular pizza) at Tony's Slice House.", "author": "Lisa K."}

We enjoyed the good coffee, great food, mellow local staff who were nice and efficient.  Especially loved watching the former Hispanic chef who'd whip out amazing panini's, pizzas, and salads that made you wish you had more room in your belly.  He virtually danced while he cooked, watching him cook was the enticement and entertainment.  \n\nThis has been a \"must stop\" on regular visits to San Francisco.  On our recent \"must stop\", the waitress for the outside tables was efficient and friendly, but there was this mustache guy who couldn't move his face or serve a beer in the time it takes to pull a tap.  We came again the following day, service was so slow to the point where you wonder if you should help yourself.  Was left alone with our \"one\" beers long enough and decided to go, when I went in for the  bathroom.  I could've been a new customer since I only sat outside while partner went in for the service and the check.  I walked passed the mustachioed, a gal, and another bearded hipster guy who looked at me without saying a word nor moved their faces.  It was like the hear-see-speak no evil monkeys, lined up behind the bar.  Instead, I helped myself to the bathroom without being acknowledged.  THIS is now the place where you can use the bathroom freely without being a customer.  You don't have to worry since you won't be stopped, nor be sold a drink or food.  They won't dare to crack their faces for you. Bathroom is straight to the back, then turn right.  Would've tried the food (didn't see the Hispanic chef), but since we could only get one beer each, used our money in other parts of North Beach where they want to take it.  Lost its real San Francisco local charm, and 2 customers now.  So sad.", "author": "Debby W."}

It was the best, most simply satisfying sandwich ever. The caesar was just fine.\n\nHubby also had the sausage half sandwich/salad combo and he liked his meal as well.\n\nBut what gives them the extra star(s)? Service. They were so incredibly friendly.  In fact, while we were there, one of the people associated with our concert came to get some to-go sandwiches for a few of the boys who were singing. They made them as fast as was humanly possible with only 2 guys working the whole place and most of the tables taken.\n\nAnd towards the end, after we paid the check, they realized they didn't charge us for the half carafe of wine...so they apologized, brought the bottle over and filled our glasses to the top gratis, and then gave us the wine check for the original half carafe. That made me so happy because I wanted just that one more glass of wine but wasn't going to order one.

I don't do or need fancy-shmancy. My friend told me try either the tuna, sausage, meatball or eggplant panini....now I usually delve into meat options but I'm a huge fan of eggplant so I opted for that and an unlimited amount of Malbec.... SO GOOD! The bread...incredible, the flavors in the eggplant, wow, hearty.... I tried his tuna.... SO GOOD! WIN!\n\n ***note, the amount of Malbec had no influence whatsoever on the rating of the food, promise!***\n\nThe server was a really nice character who poured our last glass on the house.... don't know if that meant he was really being gratuitous or if it was because we almost finished the bottle... :) Who cares! It was great. \n\nAnd the neighborhood is a gem to walk around after... apparently there is a great gelato spot nearby... possibly my next review??", "author": "Karen M."}

I realize when things are busy the servers might take longer to take an order or check on you, but today was the final straw. Considering I have been here a few times before, I expected to wait five minutes for the staff to acknowledge me, but twenty minutes of sitting outside and I still didn't have a menu, glass of water or any awareness that I was there. Indeed other folks on the five tables outside also seemed rather confused (this is a tourist area).\nOnce I did get service, the waitress had a serious attitude - as if I had somehow inconvenienced her somehow. Seriously....she's a waitress...that's her job. Even better if she has a smile on her face. But no...By the time I got the check, I just wanted to get out of there. \nTo the management of Mario's: Your service is getting worse. I for one won't be back, and judging from some other reviews, the hipster attitude is alienating your regular customers. Believe me...when the tourists leave, its the locals who keep your restaurant in business. \nShame....but there are too many other places to get coffee and a sandwich who make your feel welcome.", "author": "John P."}

But then I did some research and found out panini is the plural of panino which translates to \"small bread\". So egg on my face. \n\nSo instead I'll say the panini is good and I am really anxious to try some of the bigger varieties of sandwiches. A panini is more a snack you and a friend would share as you take advantage of the beers on tap. \n\nBut the real draw is the Americano. So far the best I have had in SF. I know it is just espresso and hot water, but beyond Starbucks it's tough to find good ones and Mario's Americano is great. \n\nI just love the fact you can get an espresso drink and a biscotti or other dessert or load up on carbs with beer and Italian food. Or both in the same day if you plan it right (one of these days). \n\nAnd the location right on Washington Square is unbeatable. Considering 90% of Columbus Ave is tourist traps, Mario's is a must see European style cafe, even down to the slow service. But hey, why are you in a hurry in North Beach?", "author": "Damen D."}

If that's not reason enough to give this place 5 stars, I don't know what is. \n\nNot surprisingly, I think the secret is the bread itself - perfectly crunchy but still soft.

I've enjoyed every visit to Mario's.  It's the kind of place that I would love to own.  Or what I'd use as a template for the perfect comfortable cafe with food and wine.  I order a half carafe of the montepulciano, an Italian red and the eggplant marinara sandwich on focaccia.  They layer the sandwich with thin slices of breadcrumb coated fried eggplant, roasted red peppers and then a layer of provolone.  Then bake it open-faced in the oven on the wall.  After ten or fifteen minutes, they slap the two sides together and slice it diagonally and garnish with those green pepperocinis, which I bite the end off, pour the tangy vinegar into the sandwich and then munch down as I eat the sandwich and sip the red wine in smallish hexagonal tumbler glasses.  \nOne memorable time was when my brother Rufus visited and we went there on a Monday for dinner.  It was raining out.  We ate and had the wine.  It continued to rain, they had cool music playing.  Coltrane or Sonny Rollins or Thelonious Monk...  Anyway, we didn't leave that place for 3 hours just laughing about dumb things we used to do as kids and can now talk about.  No reason to go out in the rain when you've already found a cool place to hang.\nI do have to admit that in the past few years, the charm has changed a bit for the worse.  The lighting is now much brighter and too bright in my opinion. I like it dim when work on getting a good wine buzz.  And the jazz music has been replaced by either dancey world music or reggae or just contemporary Alice-type music.  Maybe it's the workers who just play their iPods or whatever they want.  \nThe great foccacia they use for the sandwich is from Liguria Bakery on the corner of Stockton and Filbert, but the Italian French Bakery up the street on Grant @ Union makes a decent substitute, but it's not the soft wonderful foccacia from Liguria.  There's a difference.  They ran out of the Liguria foccacia bread for the sandwiches a couple of times too and I asked about when they changed to the Italian French Bakery foccacia, our waitress was convinced it's always been the same.  They also installed a few taps of draft beer, which is nice, but I suggest the red wine with the sandwiches.  2006, the old school is changing.\n\nUpdate:\nThey had a sign on the window saying they're using Liguria focaccia.  Hmm.  Maybe they read the yelp reviews...cool.", "author": "Kev M."}

I've  been going to Marios for so long -- I've known so many people who work(ed) there spanning so many eras. It's a true North Beach institution and rivals Cafe Trieste and some others in that regard. It has its 'people' and following. I can't be objective about the food or service, since I've had everything they make 1000 times and know everyone personally who works there. This place has been a home to me. And I appreciate Paulo the owner and all the various people over all the various time periods that has made Marios a part of my life.\n\nFor the unintiated, Marios is a place you go to just hang out and be merry. You have some red wine, order a pizza or a meatball sammy and talk loud and be animated or sit outside on the stockton street side between 4-6 when the sun is shining there and people watch.\n\nBe cool with the people who work there and they will be cool with you. Tip well and they will be even cooler.\n\nMarios hours sort of roll with how busy it is, it can be open late. In the old days it was open really late on weekends, and I still think the owner should re-consider serving food til 12:30am on Fri and Sat., as there is nothing this end of the 'hood to get a pizza when hungry late.\n\nThey selection of food is not vast, but it what it is and its consistent. This is not a place to come in being a vegan or foodie. Just be cool. Bring a cool book or some post-cards or a scrabble board or deck of cards or your flyers for your next gig or some Euro hotties you just met -- converse, hang out, see what happens -- and enjoy a beer and go on about your business. A pretty good tiramisu, carrot cake and some other treats to go with the coffee. No soy here! You want raw milk without pasteurization? I applaud you -- just don't come looking for that at Marios. This is a good old fashion real authentic north beach haunt.\n\nBravo!\n\n\nPS\nOnce you couldn't smoke inside anymore, they did away with the cigars -- and they finally got a credit card machine a few years back after being known for \"cash only\" -- i took great pleasure watching a guy on a first date sadly have to make the walk up the block to the ATM...ah, the good ole days... :-)", "author": "R A."}

Mario kept a box of cigars under the counter to sell just in case someone wandered in and asked for one until he passed away in the 90's. at some point around then they had to take out the Foosball game in the back to add more tables because the landlord raised the rent a lot, also adding the sidewalk tables outside. but aside from such details it really hasn't changed at all. they have had the good sense not to redecorate or try to update. it still has one of the funkiest (but clean) bathrooms in town.

Nestled in north beach, this Italian spot does a pretty good ceasar salad and we had something else resembling enchiladas stuffed with different fillings. Those were pretty good but I think next time I'm going for something a bit more my speed- sandwich or pasta or something (if they have those). Split a bottle of wine, which was great, and chatted with people at the next table after they overheard our conversation regarding my roommates slut of an ex-girlfriend. I really like the bathroom for some reason, which I think has to do with the slanted ceiling, like you're peeing in an attic.

After passing by this cafe many times, I never went in even though it looked alluring, but after hearing that they have the \"best foccacia sandwiches\" on Bay Area Backroads I decided to give it a go. I ordered the turkey foccacia with pepper jack cheese and onions, and I replaced the dijon mustard with red bell peppers. We sat outside and it was very comfortable, and the sandwiches came right away. Sadly, they don't carry \"exotic\" Torani flavors like coconut or mango, so I had to settle for a peach Italian soda. It was still yummy. The sandwich was very very tasty, nice crispy bread and great cheese.. kinda spicy too, which I liked.

The only food I can vouch for is the eggplant pannini and foccacia sandwich, both baked and breaded. Good stuff man, I think the arugala makes the difference... and that fine ass north beach bread.  My friends assure me that the dead animals they serve are consistently delicious as well.  Also, it's not too touristy, which is always a worry in North Beach.

If you are in a rush or one of those people that can't chill and enjoy a good atmosphere while you wait for your food, do not come here if there are a lot of people.  It is a small, casual, corner joint and they have room for just one oven and one person to make the food - but that is personally what I love about it!", "author": "Ashley A."}

It has a cool european feel and if you're lucky to get a window seat, looking out at the park is really something! The paninis are very good. Especially the grilled chicken #1. I take everyone who comes into town here. I tell them its not chic, not fancy but a cool typical north beach hang out.  They're never disappointed. Its not very touristy and I think every time im there i see someone whom ive seen eaten there before. The service is a weee slow but i dont mind it since its a kick back place and why would you want to rush to get out of there! The music they play is usually very cool.  Highly recommend it!", "author": "Jesse O."}
