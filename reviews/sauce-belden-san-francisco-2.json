You couldn't taste the alcohol too easily but it was decently strong.\n\nWe had a variety of the appetizers and shared plates, ranging from the cheesy bread (pretty good, tastes like cheesy bread with tomato sauce), to the sampler (of the bunch, the rangoon and the mushroom fries were probably the best, the deviled eggs and the bacon were just so-so), to various items such as the tater tots (passable, a little spongy), and the chips (literally chips with a bacony dip).\n\nThe vegetarian strudel was actually pretty good, and probably my favorite dish of the night.

It is a really cool spot in an alleyway and has a great vibe, but the food was nothing special.\n\nFor appetizers, I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Fries and Cheddar Cheese & Green Onion Tater Tots. The Tater Tots were too big and not too crispy so it ended up tasting like a bunch of potato. They tasted a little better with the ketchup and the vinaigrette. I was excited to try the mushroom fries and was a little disappointed in those as well. It was hard to eat because it was hard to bite off the mushroom, and the mushroom itself was not that tasty. The outside was good and crispy and the ranch dipping sauce was on another level. Seems to be their specialty. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Vegetarian Strudel (the only vegetarian option on the menu) and was again a little disappointed, based on the hype that I saw about this dish on Yelp. The tomato bisque was good, but was nothing special, compared to other bisques that I've had. The asparagus was well prepared and tasted great with the bisque. The mushrooms were easily the highlight of this dish - very gooey and soft and well flavored. The strudel itself was super flaky and crispy on the outside, but a bit too filling on the inside. It was warm and tasty, and complimented nicely with the bisque.\n\nOverall, although the food was decent, it was not worth the price so will definitely not be coming here anytime soon in the future.", "author": "Sampath D."}

Not super crowded, though it was the Financial District on a Saturday night, which is typically less busy compared to the weekdays. We got seated right away (love how they have hooks for your purses at each table!). \n\nOur waitress was really courteous, she checked on us at least three times before we ordered (a little overbearing, but I do give her props for being on top of it). She answered all our questions and gave us choices (for example, putting the salad dressing on the side). I was expecting to see burgers on the menu (since that's the category it falls under on Yelp), but didn't find any on the menu. We still decided to go ahead and ordered four items to share: portobello mushroom fries, ham hock tater tots, beef tenderloin carpaccio and a large bowl of chili.\n\nPortobello mushroom fries - not what we expected, but don't regret ordering it. A first read of the item made us think it was regular, potato french fries with pieces of mushroom shredded on the side, but it was actual mushrooms cut like a wedge fry! It was well breaded on the outside and had good body to it as we sliced into each piece. It was paired with a ranch dip. The taste is still vivid in my memory!\n\nI was really looking forward to the ham hock tater tots. They were good, though not what I expected and not in a good way. I'm used to cylinder-shaped tater tots with a golden brown crisp on the outside and potato-y inside as if in the insides were diced. The ones at Sauce were kinda thick and had more of a french fry texture inside (like a smashed potato). Came with ketchup and I believe a salsa verde dip. It was good while hot, but once they cooled down I was getting over them.\n\nThe beef tenderloin carpaccio, thinly sliced meat (six pieces), topped with chopped egg, deviled egg, arugula dijon aioli, caper and red onion (plus five baguette pieces). I had a hard time figuring out what flavor was the most prominent in this one, but I did like it.\n\nThe chili was really filling! It was topped off with a dollop of melted cheese, a dollop of sour cream, chopped onions and cilantro. Had a good spice to it, though not spicy to the point where I needed to grab a drink of water. \n\nI also ordered the Hibiscus El'Diablo or, as it's described in the menu, the margarita's evil cousin. It comes with tequila, ginger beer and hibiscus flavor. Definitely felt the booze after a few sips, I liked it! I've had this place bookmarked for awhile, glad I finally came around to trying it.

It was pretty empty, and we sat inside at a high table because they don't have any regular tables, which was annoying to begin with. The happy hour deal was a glass of red (tempranillo) and glass of white (sauv blanc). This is not a Spanish place, so I'm really confused why tempranillo was the red white. It's not a widely liked wine, I feel like they should have picked pinot noir or cabernet.\n\nWe started with the cheesy bread, which tasted like it came from a box. Huge pieces of bread with random cheese on it, definitely nothing gourmet . Then, my friend and I split the brussels sprout salad and the salmon. Both were fine, but nothing special. The salmon was SO small. Probably 2 ounces. The salad it came with had a weird horseradish dressing, not something a lot of people like, so I'm not sure why they picked that.\n\nAfter all that food, we were obviously still hungry because the portions were so tiny, so we got the tater tots.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "You know, for a place named Sauce, I'm surprised that they aren't only serving tons of saucy pasta dishes. \n\nThe menu is broad, covering appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and full-fledged entrees. Considering that it's located in Belden Place, which has been called the French Quarter of SF, its menu is pure Americana. I see why it's the place of choice for both people on their days off, and workers; the service is very friendly and fast, while the food is high quality and easy to eat. Come to think of it, most of it is the kind of stuff you can throw on a grill real fast, or assemble without much fuss. If you like to eat without getting sloppy, they serve many dishes that fall into that category.\n\nI came with a group of 8 from work.  We'd made reservations a few days before with no problems, and were seated promptly. Our server was very kind about explaining ingredients to some of our party, who had dietary restrictions like soy and vegetarianism. If you're allergic to soy, their fries are made with a combination of oils that included vegetable oil, so you might want to pass on that. If you aren't allergic and just have a preference for other toppings like cheese, they offer American, cheddar, and jack cheeses, along with tortilla chips, seasoned fries, or salad. Ultimately, herd mentality led six of us to choose the Golden Gate Burger with fries, while one sprung for the veggie burger and another went for the chicken sandwich.\n\nThe burger is good, as it's juicy and has few vegetables aside from lettuce (you want veggies? That's what salad is for.) Go for cheddar or jack over American cheese. While there's absolutely nothing wrong with a slice of melty American, I think the tang of either would better complement the sauce. No complaints here, because we all downed the burgers. The salad is heavy on the arugula, so if wild spring mix is your thing, you'll like the salad. If you're like me and prefer all things greasy, the seasoned french fries are the way to go. I think they must toss the fries in baking soda or parboil before frying because they develop a nicely textured crunch that results from a potato slurry coating the outside of each stick (thanks to J. Kenji Lopez-Alt for teaching me that.) It results in a satisfying side.\n\nBack to the service -- we'd overpaid by about 10% and the guy helping us said it was fine and he'd consider it his gratuity. Um, no! I wish I'd gotten his name, because he deserved a way bigger tip (which we left) for helping us navigate food allergies, last minute drink decisions, and juggling us on top of the otherwise busy restaurant. I appreciated the heads up on when our food would be out, and the fact that he managed to put the right plate down in front of everyone, no questions asked. If you have the time to take a leisurely lunch, definitely make the trek from your air conditioned office for their comfy outdoor seating.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I thought this was French fries with mushrooms over it but no, it's sliced deep fried battered mushrooms lol.\n   The Deviled eggs were tasty with a piece of their bacon on it.\n\nBeet Salad:\n    Salad was light and full of flavor enjoyed it a lot, was not crazy about the huge chunk of goat cheese they threw on top but I just moved it aside. \n\nChicken Parmesan:\n   It was fried chicken breast very tasty, with the cheese melted over the sauce instead of over the chicken. I'll admit, I liked it more this way. It allowed for the cheese to stay hot and melted over the sauce instead of hardening and cooling over the chicken. My favorite part of the plate though was the salad that came on the side. Very lemony and brought a breath of lightness to a plate that normally is very heavy.\n\nPB&J\n   A very interesting take on an old classic. It's basically an ice cream sandwich with a light layer of PB&J. It was very tasty and caught myself talking about how interesting a take it was... I liked it, not amazing but enjoyed it.\n\nWe were there for a late dinner and halfway through our meal saw another guest eating a delicious looking burger with onion rings I think (no burger was on the menu). We asked our server and he said that there is an unlisted burger item you can order that is normally on the lunch menu. So a heads up if you want a burger.\n\nAll in all very tasty, we enjoyed our night but it was not a panty dropper. I don't see myself coming back... I will try another spot but glad I tried this place.", "author": "David T."}

Don't get upset if you can't find this place. It's tucked away in an alley between Kearny and Montgomery street.\n\nThis place has a cute outdoor patio and indoor seating as well. Today was a nice day so we decided to sit outside and it was beautiful. I ordered the mini chicken pot pies for $10.99 - made with organic chicken, English peas and carrots with gravy. The crust was cooked to perfection - light and not too flaky. The dish came with 4 mini pot pies and I thought it was just the right amount of food for me. I also ordered the cucumber and basil gimlet - made with Deep Eddy vodka, fresh basil, English cucumber and lime juice. Such a refreshing drink to have in the middle of the day!\n\nTwo of my friends ordered the Golden Gate All Natural Burger that came with seasoned fries and salad - all for $15.99. My other friend ordered the Sauce Classic Tomato Bisqu with the white truffled grilled cheese for $10.99. Got a chance to try their food and thought it was all very tasty. The burger was juicy and the salad was fresh. The tomato bisqu was creamy and loved the white truffled grilled cheese.

Came in for lunch today and ordered the portobello fries, the chop salad with chicken and bacon and egg, the tomato bisque soup and the donuts. Just Meh. Seriously, nothing special and all dishes were VERY bland. If you read other review, they seem to say the same thing. The ranch dressing is supposed to be very good here- more sour cream based and thicker- and they tend to use this sauce in many of their dishes. It's bland and has no taste. Nothing more to add- just bland. It accompanied the portobello fries- which by the way were very breaded and had a overbearing taste of flour batter/oil taste. ( this was the best item ordered of the lot) the salad was so bland I didn't eat it- I tried doctoring it up with salt and pepper and even asked for another type of dressing to get some flavor out of it- but it didn't work. The portion was great and your could easily split it. The waitress took it off my bill which was very nice. The soup was tasteless as well and came with a ton of bread to dip it with. Can't say anything else about it. The donuts were basically mini croissants - not donut consistency, which were overly dry.  sad about this- was really looking forward to them. \nThis restaurant is down an alley with many other restaurants- unfortunately I don't think I would come here again- staff was very nice , facility was clean but the food is just mediocre.", "author": "Eva C."}

The sampler platter was cool because you get to try a few different items: bacon, deviled eggs, portabello mushroom fries, and crab rangoons. We split each platter with about 4 people and each had 1 slider, and we were all content!\n\nMy favorite thing in the sampler platter was definitely the mushroom fries that everyone raves about! They're pretty crunchy on the outside, and the dipping sauce is really creamy. The crab rangoons were good, though I couldn't tell they were \"dungeness crab rangoons\". Also the dipping sauce tasted like apple sauce... Hmmm! The deviled eggs were something different because usually I don't even like deviled eggs, but I enjoyed having one here. The thick cut bacon was also cut into bite size pieces and had a caramelized glaze. Yum!\n\nThe sliders are interesting because they come with a little cube of patty meat, cheese, and mashes potatoes on top. I've never seen mashed potatoes on a slider!\n\nAs for the ambiance, there's plenty of tvs here but it doesn't seem like the best place to watch the game...

I guess I expected a different taste. The deviled eggs were a little plain. Crab rangoon is always good. And the bowl of bacon was a little special. It's like honey rubbed bacon. Interesting taste. For my entree, since I'm not a big eater, I opted for the Mac n Cheese. It was nice and hot. I liked the shell macaroni they used. The cheese wasn't as melty as I would have liked. \n\nThings not related to food: Service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and regularly checked on our table.

It was literally that -- $15 for an ear or two of corn, sliced lengthwise, with small, sad pieces of heirloom tomato, red onion shavings, and a corn puree. The corn puree was interesting and tasted good, but needed to be more of it. The whole thing was just bland and monochromatic on the white plate. I expected there to be lettuce, so I guess my bad for not checking, but seriously does anyone really want to eat that much corn?? Just not appetizing or filling at all.

Usually known for their social plates and generous portions, the significant and I thought it would be a good idea to share our dishes for the night. \n\nWith regard to the social plates, we tried the MINI CHICKEN POT PIES ($10.99), which incorporated Rosie's Organic Chicken, English Peas & Carrots with Gravy and the GRILLED AKAUSHI KOBE SIRLOIN STEAK ($27.99) - dried Black Mission Fig, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Pumpkin Seeds & Arugula Salad Russet Potato Skins & Demi for our Entree. \n\nThe Pot Pies were unlike any other typical pot pie with a plain exterior crust filled with chicken and pea bits. Long and behold, the mastered art of all pot pies, right here at Sauce! Shredded (organic) chicken exterior molded in a small ball to enclose the flavored peas, carrots, and gravy that's inside. Easy enough to take it all in one bite! Unfortunately, this was the only noteworthy meal of the night. This social plate came with 4 golf-ball sized pies, enough to feed one person on a diet. I, personally, don't believe in \"diets\" other than the \"see-food diet\", so this barely filled my hearty tummy. \n\nThe Sirloin Steak, yet another eye-opener for me as I was expecting a normal slab of steak and was surprised to see about six small square-cut slices of meat for a rather hefty price. In addition, the plate came with a mere 5 pieces of potato skins. WTF! I would've been less upset had this been a social plate, however, this was what they defined as an Entree. Not cool, Sauce, not cool at all.\n\nDidn't dig the scanty portions and left this restaurant hungry and unsatisfied. \n\nSince I am a believer in second chances, I'm willing to give this place another try with a bigger party in hopes for a better dining experience.\n\n+ Indoor and outdoor seating available.\n+ Reservations highly recommended.\n+ This venue charges an extra 2% tax for Health Care Fees for their employees in addition to the county's 8.50% tax rate.

I came here a few weeks ago during lunch with a bunch of managers as a \"thank you\" as I put in my 2 week notice, so I wanted to take them out to lunch and this place had high marks.  Boy...the joke was on me.\n\nWe walked into the restaurant, and it was empty.  Well, almost empty, there was a bartender cleaning out some glasses but no hostess, no waitresses.  There was a party of 2 seated inside and at most 3 parties seated outside.  This was at 12 PM mind you, right during the lunch rush, but I'm not quite sure they got the memo.  Anyways, it was quite a few minutes before someone finally came by and seated us.\n\nThere's a good selection on the menu, particularly on the social plates.  The portobello mushroom fries is one of their specialty items and I think a must try.  Their house burger is also a good choice to go with.  \n\nAfter waiting for our food, the server brought out 3 orders (we were a party of 5), and after setting our orders down, we all decided to wait until the remaining orders came.  It turns out, the server brought us the wrong orders!  So we ended up waiting for another 10-15 minutes for our order...I'm sure someone screwed up and had to remake our orders.  Mistakes happen, totally understandable...but not even a simple \"We're sorry\"..\n\nFinally, as I was looking to pay the bill, our waitress disappeared!  I managed to flag down the waitress who was serving the table next to us, and after she had finished with the table's orders, I asked if she could get our waitress, and she replied \"No, sorry I'm busy.\"  ...??!?!  \n\nI would have considered giving this 3 stars, but after re-reading what I wrote and the fact that it was a lunch with mainly executives and managers, this place leaves a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nExplore other options in Belden Lane, there's a reason why this place was empty as it was during the lunch hour rush.", "author": "Kevin C."}

This place has a nice intimate outdoor seating area. Keep that in mind for when the sun is out. The food we ordered (Bacon & Eggs and a Grilled chicken breast sandwich) was surprisingly good (the bacon is so good, I wonder it is made from a unicorn!), but including having drinks (at happy hour!) this lunch still ended up in quite a pricey pitstop before having dinner later on that day. \n\nWhy 4 stars?

Come prepared to share appetizers like ham hock tater tots, bacon wrapped meatloaf, mushroom fries, and bacon deviled eggs. Not the place if you're looking for a light lunch. \n\nIn terms of entrees, they make a decent, though unmemorable, bacon and cheese burger. The food coma-inducing fried chicken will make it a challenge to stay awake at work right after lunch. The chicken is crispy and the meat is moist although it could use more salt/seasoning. The highlight though was the creamed corn served in its husk. All up a heavy but satisfying meal. \n\nThe Hayes Valley location is more intimate but this is livelier. Prices trend a little higher especially when compared with what you can get elsewhere in the same price range, but it's aligned with most spots in Belden. 4 stars perhaps is a stretch for Sauce but for consistency along Belden Place, we'll bump it up.", "author": "Jon L."}

It consisted of 8 pieces of the Japanese red cow (akaushi) kobe steak, with fig, blue cheese, and pumpkin seeds on arugula with a side of potato skins. While I thought the salad would be perfect without the blue cheese, the main attraction here was the 8 pieces of steak, all of which were very tender and easy to chew, as expected.

I did not like the lobster bisque to be honest, the flavor was off, which was sad because I love lobster bisque!

Really slowly. Like an average of every seventeen months. I must not be all that motivated, and then there's those women cajoling you to come into their restaurants. They could learn a lesson in subtlety from the Red Light window hookers in Amsterdam. So I must have hit my seventeen-month mark because for no reason I can articulate, I found myself at Sauce for a very late lunch. Late being like 2:30PM, and I was starving. Don't let other people schedule your work life. \n\nYou merely suffer from accommodating everyone around you, and what do you get? Indigestion.

I gorged and first ordered the $14.50 Maine Lobster Bisque, which came piping hot for such a creamy broth but lacking oomph in its flavor. It came with a small crostini with a piece of buttered lobster tail, just enough to make you wish you really were in Maine in front of a whole one (photo: http://bit.ly/1D7KiEC). I followed this with the $14.50 Baby Iceberg Cobb Salad.\n\nThis dish was inexplicably presented as a Napoleon neatly stacking the ingredients in a way that made it impossible not to topple over. The lettuce was at the bottom with the red onions on top of that with the ranch dressing acting as a glue with the chunks of chicken breast over that and the bacon pieces over that. The tomatoes were somewhere in there, while the egg slices couldn't be bothered and were left on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1JEPcxb). It was a generous portion but such a chore to eat I wasn't really enjoying it that much.

I feel bad because my coworker highly recommends this place so I didn't tell her that I didn't like it, maybe it was an off day, but all of the food we had was terrible in my opinion :( not to mention: I'm sick!", "author": "Emma H."}

We had leftovers of bacon and mushroom fries. I loved the mushroom fries and lobster rangoon, and he loved the bacon! $34.99.

I like the high bar stools- though sometimes I forgot and didn't realize I was so high off the ground. \n\nThe chicken pot pie appetizer: Pretty tasty. Just two or three bites. Not really a chicken pot pie (I imagine a bit more liquid filling, and more puff pastry on top), but flavors were great combo and it was fun to eat.\nThe burger: This is not on the menu. We had to ask our waitress about it, and since our group was large, she had to repeat it for different people several times and get back to us about the pricing every time we had questions. They should really put this on the menu. It'd make all our lives easier and we would have ordered like ten minutes earlier. \nLobster bisque: Not my thing. I was sick when eating this so that could have drastically affected it, but everyone at the table was not enthused with this. They all said it tasted too strongly of \"seafood\". It was really gross for me (but sick, so my half my tastebuds were turned off). \nTomato basil soup: I didn't enjoy the soup very much. It was too acidic for me, so it started hurting my tongue. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the truffle cheese sandwich that came with it. It even came in four little triangles- yes basically I am a little girl and I like my sandwich cut into smaller pieces. I dipped my sandwich into the soup to deepen the flavors. It was yum. But once I finished the sandwich, I stopped drinking the soup. \n\nWeird outcome of the night: My friend paid our whole bill on her credit card. They ended up calling us less than 10 minutes later asking why she didn't tip. She had assumed that since we were a group of 10 that the tip was already added onto the bill. Poor thing- they didn't have to make her feel bad about it. She ended up just telling them to add 18% tip. I'm sure our waitress was much happier after that phone call- so that's good. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but eating here with friends is pretty fun. (:", "author": "Tiffany W."}

Mind you, they're only good when they're hot so eat them all right away. Once they get cold... they're kinda nasty. The dipping sauce is tasty. For my entree, I had a cup of the Seafood Chowder, which the waitress recommended over the Lobster Bisque. Very hearty and filling.\n\nI kept having to look around for our waitress, who was socializing with her colleagues. It was a little annoying after awhile. Even though she was friendly, she was not very present with her customers. Anyways, the food was good. High class bar food, I would say.

The food portions, however,  were miniscule and of insufficient quality to make me feel ok about the small servings. Food was bland and completely uninspired. I hate to give a low rating like this, but Belden Alley has so much better to offer. \n\nWe ordered the beef carpaccio and fried chicken entree and flourless chocolate cake. Carpaccio was $9 for about 3 slices of meat. I thought it would be fine spending over $20 for fried chicken because the menu dedcribed it as a breast with wing and leg (maybe it said thigh). I really thought I was getting 1/2 a chicken, which is why we decided to share the entree. What I got was the smallest airline/frenched chicken breast ever, accompanied by tiny frenched thigh. The coating wasn't very crispy and the whole dish lacked seasoning and flavor. The one good part was the sauteed spinach amd kale. How is it that the greens are better than the fried chicken?!

No way two people can finish this. I really enjoyed the crab rangoons and mushroom fries. The deviled eggs were okay. The bowl or bacon was way too much. I don't know how even a party of four could finish this. I liked the lobster bisque. Creamy and good lobster flavor. The baked mac and cheese was great as well. Super cheesy and comforting. So I don't know if they changed the entrees, but our entrees seemed to be missing some components. We didn't get any baked potato accompaniments with the steak. And our lobster roll didn't come with cheddar tortillas with green goddess dip. But the proteins were delicious and nicely prepared. The strawberries & cream was a nice way to end our meal.\n\nDrinks:\n*Barrel aged root manhattan ($12.50): russell's reserve 10 yr bourbon and pre-prohibition era root spirit with punt e mes vermouth, aged in a lightly charred barrel and finished with orange bitters\n*Manhattan whistle ($17): whistle pig 10 year rye, carpano antica vermouth and a dash of bitters\n*Irish coffee ($9.50)\n*Mexican coffee ($9.50)\n\nDrinks were great!

They don't exactly taste like pot pies, but there are qualities that that are similar. The mini pot pies are a bit of the soft side. They lack a well formed exterior crust that most people love in chicken pot pies. Don't get me wrong, they are still rather good, nonetheless. They have a delightful, yet simple taste to them.\n\nLastly, I recommend ordered the Braised short rib stroganoff. The meat is incredibly tender, and so the soft noodles compliment the dish well.

And it's a lot of food!  The real highlights of the sampler are the Portabello Mushroom Fries and the Bowl of Bacon.  The PM Fries come with a Ranch Dipping sauce and is so good!  I think even if you're not a mushroom fan, you'll probably want to dive into these suckers!! \nHere's another look at the Portabello Mushroom Fries when ordered separately --  (http://bit.ly/Pz7maK).  And the Bowl of Bacon is just simply magical.  Their Bacon is really sweet and smokey.  It's almost like candy!\n\nIf there's one constant that featured through their menu, it's definitely their Bacon.  They serve it in a bowl, on their Deviled Eggs, with their Salmon, and wrapped around mini meatloaf nuggets.\n\nHere are more of their Social Plates that are pretty amazing:\n\nBacon Wrapped Mini Meatloaf --  http://bit.ly/Pz7irn\nWhipped Potato & Pan Gravy\n\nProsciutto Wrapped Figs -- http://bit.ly/SoHY4o\nPoint Reyes Blue Cheese, Balsamic Reduction, Arugula\n\nSeasoned Fry Poutine --  http://bit.ly/SoHYBA\nMozzarella Cheese Curds, Pan Gravy\n\nThey do have main entrees ranging from Fried Chicken, a Deviled Egg Filled Bacon Cheeseburger, and Lobster Rolls to highlight a few.

While the strudel itself was like an awesome Hot Pocket, it was really the pairing with Tomato Bisque that made it shine!  Don't overlook this item, it's really underrated!!\n\nI do like how they are open pretty late on the weekend so that if you can stop over for a late bite after having a few drinks around town.

My office team and I enjoyed an afternoon lunch at Sauce on a sunny Wednesday. The atmosphere of Belden Place is hard to beat... tiny cafes squished together on a side-street of Bush, in the heart of FiDi.\n\nSauce offers a menu that I would consider perfect for dinner, but a bit heavy for lunch. The fried chicken that my coworkers had would be a great Sunday night meal, but not so much a lunch before heading back to work for 4 more hours. The shrimp salad (the only salad on the menu for an entree) was completely doused in dressing, and should have tasted much fresher for including so much avocado and shrimp.\n\nI appreciate the effort by Sauce to meet the lunch crowd, but I noticed the inside was completely empty on that Wednesday. I'd reccomend Sauce for happy hour (starting at 2:30pm!) because their drinks look divine, but steer clear during lunch hour unless you want to head back to the office with a food coma.", "author": "Kerry G."}

As of this writing, there are two locations for Sauce.  Both locations have identical menus.  I had a nice experience dining at their Belden Street location.  The food and customer service was very good.  I highly recommend the Portobello Mushroom Fries.  It was light, not oily, and flavorful. I liked it more than regular fries. I also recommend  the Bowl of Bacon.  The bacon was cooked perfectly.  It was flavorful. It smelled wonderful. As for entrees, the Maine Lobster Roll which was pretty good and well made. The meat was delicious. I also had the bacon wrapped meatloaf, which was also pretty good.  As for dessert, I recommend the Guinness Milk Shake.  A nice combination of Guinness beer and ice cream.  Moreover, this place has Cronuts on their dessert menu.  I tried their Cronut dessert (at their Gough Street location), it was also very good.  It came with a tasty and sweet sauce.  The Cronuts were nice and crunchy.", "author": "Hiroshi K."}

There's a casual, outdoor cafe type vibe to the place, and to be accurate, I would say that pricing is approximately $$1/2. We had the ham hock tater tots and portobello mushroom fries as starters, which were delicious and flavorful. For mains, I had the Maine lobster roll, which was delicious. Fortunately, I didn't have an allergic reaction (yes, it's happened previously), but it would be an understatement to say that the lobster portions in the roll were generous. There were huge chunks of lobster, and it was awesome! Highly recommend. Only recommendation would be to expand the wine by the glass menu, as there was only one Pinot Noir available by the glass.", "author": "Ravi K."}

And when the sun goes down and SF cools off (as it's wont to do), they've got heat lamps out there. \n\nUnfortunately for the folks inside the actual restaurant, the door stays open and there are no heat lamps, so it's cold as fuck, and you probably have to keep your jacket on as you eat. \n\nMy whining aside, Sauce is a good spot. A better than decent beer selection, and plenty of specialty cocktails to choose from can take care of your beverage needs. (Personally, the barrel-aged root manhattan was a bit too bitter for my taste, but to each their own.) \n\nI haven't had the pleasure of a full meal yet, but for a snack I recently ordered the bacon-wrapped mini-meatloaf. I didn't realize that this dish is actually four mini-loafs, which explains why the lovely bartender pitied me so much (nothing sadder than a share plate for one). \n\nThe four loafs atop their bed of mashed potatoes makes for a SUBSTANTIAL amount of food, far more than I would've thought. They were solid enough; the bacon didn't add much, but the gravy/mashed combo was a good one. By extension, I think you could do a lot worse than Sauce for a cold, lonely dinner.", "author": "Peter D."}

I have been in a lull at work (bored), which actually makes me crazier than being insanely busy (not bored), so I decided to do all of those things I've been meaning to do but haven't. ... Restless person syndrome, and all. \n\nSauce is located in Belden Place, one of my favorite alleys for lunch in the Financial District. Be careful that you don't confuse it with Belden Taverna right next door--they have an extremely convincing hostess (but that place is fly too, so no worries if you have a brain cramp). \n\nI booked a reservation on open table with no hassle. Briefly, did you know you can't reserve a table for greater than five people on Open Table? Weird, because having a large party is probably a major reason to reserve a table in the first place. \n\nAnyhow, I was sat immediately for a 1:00 p.m. reservation on a Friday (hurrah). My friend joined, and we ordered drinks--he ordered an iced tea (bored), whereas I ordered a dark and stormy (not bored).  It was a solid cocktail-not too dark and not too stormy.  You can't really go wrong with black rum, unless you don't drink enough. \n\nSauce's menu is quite appealing. I wanted all of the social plates: mini chicken pot pies, sausage cheese bread, bacon wrapped mini meatloaf... All of that sounds smashing to me. Social plates at lunch, however, are hard to justify, so we skipped right to entrees. I ordered the salmon (bored?) and my friend ordered the burger (not bored). \n\nI note that almost everyone gets the burger, and it is a lovely thing to behold. It's a double, served with bacon, American cheese, chipotle aioli and ketchup. Yum--as an aspiring burger savant, I admit I was tempted to order it. But as a girl who has been clocking mad hours at the gym due to December's peppermint bark fiasco, I could not. I would not. \n\nBut as boring as I thought my order was, I was dead wrong.  It may have been the best salmon dish I've ever had. Sauce's menu describes it as \"sustainably farmed, spinach, bacon, tomato, horseradish and lemon.\" It is all of those things AND a new handbag!  Those flavors were complementary and so delicious together. The bacon--oh, the bacon. And the horseradish was just enough to give the dish a kick of excitement. The salmon was tailored to my taste--not so underdone that it's practically swimming off of the table, yet not so overdone that it's dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service is great. The price is standard for San Francisco. You won't be bored.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I was excited to see their beer menu-- they had a pretty good selection of craft beers. I chose one of the Firestone IPAs (it was perfect).\n\nI ordered the Seared Safe Harbor Certified Salmon. The Salmon was amazing because on the outside, it was slightly crispy due to it being seared, but when you pierce your fork through it, the salmon was soft on the inside. I was so happy when I ate it-- so freaking happy because it was perfect and was not even a bit over-cooked.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Braised Beef Short Rib Stroganoff. I know I really liked my salmon dish, but his was even better. The beef had a robust flavor, and the long/flat pasta (how I usually like my pasta) was supple. \n\nWhen we finished off our entrees, our waiter tempted us with the dessert menu. Normally my bf and I never order dessert-- but we just couldn't resist the PB&J (pan seared sponge cake layered with homemade strawberry preserve and frangelico peanut butter vanilla ice cream center). When dessert arrived at our table, the presentation of it didn't look like much, but when we dug in, I was able to quickly realize the PB&J flavor was apparent, the cake-y part of it was also light and fluffy. Such a good way to end our dinner.\n\nSauce is definitely a great place to dine. It had a nice ambience (it's funny how you can turn an alley into something so cool), great food, and a wonderful selection of craft beers. The only thing that inhibits me from wanting to give it the full five stars is that the amount of food that you receive isn't what you're paying for.

Split all three plates between myself and my manfriend and we were pretty satisfied. \n\nThe BAD: the service- our waitress was the nastiest most horrible waitress I've ever experienced. She was so snotty from the moment we sat down, told me her bartender would \"bitch at her\" if I ordered a gin fizz, so I asked if I could have a glass of sparkling wine and she retorted (with rolling eyes) \"uhm pick a flavor- look at your menu, I'll come back.\" And left.....\n\nGiven I hadn't had but about 45 seconds to look at the menu before she asked us for our order, so I get the lack of enthusiasm over my indecisiveness but she didn't have to be such a jerk.\n\nWith each time she returned to our table to check on us she was removing a plate while we we still holding food-filled-forks about to put in our mouths, that just feels so awkward. She literally pulled a dipping sauce away from my manfriend while he was dipping an avocado fry. She was forcing us out and they were still serving for another three hours (We sat at 10pm, serve until 1am)....\n\nNow I get that some people have shitty days, especially in a weekend like Super Bowl 50 and all its ridiculousness, and I do try to give people a  benefit of the doubt and show them I'm a pretty nice and accepting patron who'll not want to trouble you so, but she was just SUCH a rude person to us. \n\nI wrote on her receipt \"everything else was fantastic :(\" next to her small tip. \n\nShe just pretty much ruined it!", "author": "Erin W."}

They came probably 5 minutes after we ordered them so a little more heat and preparation time would be beneficial. For my meal, I ordered the salmon which was served on a bed of sliced spinach, tomatoes and bacon bits; large piece of salmon but was on the pricier side of $28.00. Another girl ordered the burger which looked amazing and another girl ordered the cob salad.

I ordered the deviled eggs per his recommendation and the beef carpaccio, my wife ordered the kale n spinach and mini chicken pot pies. The bar tender brought out a trio of hot sauces for the deviled eggs per my request and they were so delicious, the carpaccio could have used a little more something, say olive oil or dijon mustard, it was just a little dry but not bad at all, I'd order it again. My wife loved her kale n spinach, she said the chicken pot pies were ok then proceeded to eat all of them with ease saying they were actually very tasty. \n   The desert menu was brought out and we decided on the Strawberries w/ whip cream n  brown sugar and the PB&J.

The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly and helpful, and service is attentive.  The food is delicious and exactly the kind of food you would expect in a restaurant like this gem. \nWe ordered:\n1. Mixed Heritage Greens Salad\n2. Classic Tomato Bisque with white truffled grilled cheese \n3. Hanger Steak served with arugula, dried fig, blue cheese, and toasted almond salad and crispy russet potato skins. \nAlso we asked to split a glass of wine, which they gladly accommodated and brought a little carafe of wine so we can pour ourselves. \nOh, forgot dessert - MINI SMORES are soooo good, I wish they were elephant sized smores,  not that we had any room left, but still, you know... there is always room for dessert.  \n\nThe food was really good, not the healthiest option, but totally worth all the calories.  Specifically the truffled grilled cheese was really good and went to well with tomato bisque soup - I ended up stealing it from my husband.  The steak was very moist and tender, with arugula salad being a perfect compliment.  \n\nNow, you know how I mentioned special kudos to the owner? We had a little confrontation with another patron in the restaurant... Apparently they had a problem with some of the discussion we were having at our table, which had nothing to do with them, and why were they even listening??? The guy from the table decided to come talk to us and said a few nasty things, which got my husband boiling, who is typically a very nice and calm person... Luckily for me, I missed a lot of that and will leave in the unknowing happiness. The owner did tremendously great job resolving and smoothing the conflict, he was attentive and jumped right on the issue.  They moved us to another table, and did all they could to make sure we have a great experience.  Kudos for that and THANK YOU! \n\nI was very glad to discovered they have another location in the city since I loved the food and atmosphere... But might be a tough sell to come back to this place.

But, it's hearty and damned delicious, so, feel free to let loose a little (or a lot, depending on how tight your pants are before you come!). \n\nComing on yet another team outing several weeks back, our group of ten or so had the misfortune of being eating in the alley during one of the first major rainy days SF experienced. The overhangs, umbrellas, and heaters all certainly helped, but only so much - that said, their staff was fabulous and profusely apologetic the whole time, which was awfully nice given their lack of control over the elements!\n\nHow was the food itself though? Fabulous. We ended up getting their:\n\n* Appetizers: mini pot pies, deviled eggs, and tater tots to share. All solid, with the first two being particularly notable. \n\n* Main: wild boar chili, all to myself. Quite tasty, very hearty, and packed just a little bit of a kick. \n\n* Desserts: I think most of us were planning to skip this, but we ended up getting their ice cream cake and warm fig cookies. The cake? Oh. My. God. To die for. The cookies? Not quite as orgasmic, but still very, very enjoyable: basically a sugar cookie with some dried figs.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak to Sauce's interior, but the outdoor seating in the alley is all pretty accessible, though you may be find your chair parked on a left to right incline (rather than a forward to back).

Never been to Europe, but I trust when people say its a little slice of Europe's cafes with the outdoor seating.  I've been to Cafe Bastille in the alley before and Janice C. and I were looking forward to Sauce when we saw it was participating in Dine About Town.\n\nI called the restaurant a few nights prior since they didn't list the menu online, and they were very nice about reading me everything.  She and I got one of the last outdoor seats available though it was by the door so it was more so in the shade, but still great to people watch.  \n\nWe both chose the medium rare roast beef sandwich as our entree.  The appetizers came out first which were a sampler of their popular portobello fries and their deviled eggs.  Their portobello fries had a light batter which didn't take away from the texture or the wonderful meaty taste of the mushroom.  They were so good and served with a indulgent sour cream ranch dipping sauce.  Alongside it were the deviled eggs, I did give my other half to Janice, as I don't care for deviled eggs, but I have to say that these were pretty good though not my thing.  The flavor was mild and you gotta love that crispy sweet bacon piece on top!  Next came the mid rare roast beef sammie, I was skeptical that they would have gotten the temp right, but they pretty much did!  Mine was slightly borderline medium rare/medium, but Janice's looked spot on.  The portion was huge..lots of meat and a ton of veggies!  I forgot to ask them for the horseradish on the side as I usually don't care for it.  After about 4 bites in, the horseradish became intense as I was starting to feel it in my sinuses.  They coated both the bun and the bottom of the bread with it, so I picked some of the arugula off and didn't eat all the of the bread.  Fries were seasoned fries and fine.  The nice little treat was, that even though we were so full, they included a third course which was a fresh baked cookie with chocolate sprinkles and a cherry in the middle.  I ate around the cherry, since I don't like them, but the cookie was huge and had the right amount of sweetness.  \n\nService was attentive as well.

You'd think for a restaurant begging for customers on weekend nights, they'd have better service but not at Sauce. And actually even on weeknights, they have shitty service. I just like coming to Sauce because they serve decent comfort dishes, have a full bar and offer pretty good happy hour specials so everyone in my party is usually very satisfied with their selections just as they were tonight. I will continue to come here for their Steak, Mini Meatloaves, Portobello Mushroom Fries, and Deviled Eggs. Their Mac and Cheese is boring even with 6 types of cheeses but you have to get it since it's the ultimate definition of a comfort dish. It goes well with the yummy Mini Meatloaves served with Mashed Potatoes but it lacks flavor and breadcrumbs though it tastes better with some black pepper and Tabasco sauce. The Steak is prepared well and comes sliced up, drizzled with a sauce with a side Arugula Salad and Steak Fries served with baked potato fixin's. They have some good cocktails and a number of plain ol' Bourbons to wet your pallet while you wait for your Appetizers. You have to get at least one Appetizer or what they refer to as Social Plates to share. They have many great options but like I said their service sucks. They aren't very social for serving up Social Plates. The servers are not attentive and you don't get service with much of a smile.

Located in a cute little alley of restaurants that seems to be foreign of San Francisco, Sauce to me is just another mediocre contemporary American restaurant. Our party opted to sit in the heated out door seating for hopes to people watch and I have to say, this is the single impressive aspect of the place. \n\nWe ordered everything that everyone recommended on Yelp.\n\n- Mini pot pies -  served lukewarm with borderline cold gravy. Cute but unimpressed. \n- Mac and cheese - ok I lied, besides the out door seating area, I also enjoyed the mac and cheese quite a bit\n- Lobster rolls (x3) - our waiter had to do a double take when the three of us ordered three lobster rolls plus all of the above. We may look like little Asian girls but we can grub. While I can't really complain about the lobster roll, I didn't like it more than Woodhouse. Sure there were chunky pieces of lobster but it wasn't as tasty as I would like a $24 lobster roll to be. \n- Raisin oatmeal bon bon\n- Mini donuts\n\nI won't go into details about the desserts as there is not much to say. I liked the mini donuts more than the bon bons but probably won't be back for either. \n\nTo say that I was disappointed by Sauce is an understatement but I'm glad at least we were able to use the ScoutMob deal!", "author": "Tiffany U."}

It's not too hard to find but it can be sometimes hard to get to especially since you have to pass a few restaurants in a narrow crowded alley to get there. \n\nAmbiance: Super cute- almost has a European feel with the strung light bulbs out on the patio and the tight seating\n. \nDrinks: Moscow mules here are amazing. They're served in awesome cooper mugs with a fresh slice of lime. Just the right punch of lime takes this drink out of this world (it goes down easy!) \n\nFood: We ordered the Portobello Mushroom Fries, the Mac & Cheese, the Vegetarian Strudel and the Salmon entr\u00e9e. My favorite had to be the PM fries- they were perfectly crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside and it has a cool ranch dipping sauce. So yummy! I also enjoy the Vegetarian Strudel. Because I was sharing with my 2 girl friends it went fast! It has saut\u00e9ed vegetables wrapped in phyllo dough over a creamy tomato sauce. I found myself scraping the bottom of the dish for the remainder of the sauce after the strudel was gone. \n\nFor desert we got the s'mores bites. This desert I thought was okay- honestly, it was bit on the sweet side for me, but that is my own personal preference, but it was a solid dish. \nThe service was alright. It was very busy (even on a Tuesday night) and he took a while to deliver waters and the dessert took a little while to come out as well, but overall not a bad experience. \n\nI would for sure recommend this place for happy hour because of their yummy drinks and great selection of small bites.", "author": "Sam L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-07", "description": "I came here yesterday with someone around 11:00 PM, at first it was pretty hard to find because it was in an alley way on what looked like an empty street. In about the middle of the block you'll see the alley way, but once you walk down it you'll find the restaurant. The ambiance of the place was nice and for a Saturday night it wasn't as loud as I thought it might be. The waitress was very attentive, was very good about any questions and was pretty informative about our selections.\n\nSince it was pretty late we ordered from the social portion of the menu:\n\nFirst we ordered The Portobello Mushroom Fries those were very tasty, which is the first thing that the person I was with said when she tried them. I wish they'd give you a bit more though, seeing as to how it was $11 Dollars for the equivalent of One large mushroom cut into strips. Nonetheless, it was very tasteful with a light crispy crust as I imagined it would be.\n\nSecond we ordered the Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf with Mashed potatoes and Gravey. We were initially concerned that it might be too dry, but when we asked the waitress about it she assured us that it would come out juicy and tender. Thankfully her suggestion was spot on. The dish, came out in about 4 bites, good for a tasting and the bacon complimented the meatloaf well as I think all bacon should.\n\nFinally we ordered the Mac and Cheese, Not exactly the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. They added what seemed to be bits of pork in the Mac and Cheese, which helped add flavor. If I had the option I would have ordered another of the Portobello fries instead of this. The cheese was fairly mild and the pasta was on the soft side (maybe it was just my dish specifically) and the dish wasn't as tasty as somewhere like Homeroom in Oakland.\n\nWe also ordered 2 drinks (a cocktail and a cider) I didn't get to try the cocktail, but my cider (Crispen Hard Cider) was a bit too mild and seemed to be somewhat on the flatter side to me. Maybe next time I should just stick with the IPAs. Our total came out to be around 60 dollars for the meal. This is probably one of the better late night establishments I've been to in the city. If I am ever back here it will most likely be for the Portobello Mushroom Fries.", "author": "Bobby L."}

The other two ordered the mini chicken pot pies and tater tots. We were very excited for our food and we weren't disappointed with the taste, rather the portion size.

And boy, did we luck out! \n\nFirst off, Belden Place is charming nook and cranny of SF with dangling alley lights, and open patio seating of various restaurants that makes it so inviting. The space is small, so our hostess had to cram us in between two parties, so having a one-on-one conversation can sometimes turn out to be a screaming match! Our server was absolutely fantastic! She was gracious, warm, and a great sport. We came in time for happy hour and it was a great deal. A cocktail of the week (I got the refreshing gin fizz) and a plate of two sliders + chips was only $11! We started that off as our appetizer.\n\nWith our bellies aching for more, we opted for the clam chowder which was hearty and rich with seafood. Since I was eyeing the the entrees of the table next to me, we decided to order the short rib stroganoff with a side of their cheesy, flakey, pull-apart garlic bread. Best garlic bread I've ever had...and I'm a tough critic! Their stroganoff is fit to share for two and the beef was tender and flavorful. \n\nMy final verdict?

Asked the server if he would recommend the pot pies or the strudel and he said definitely the strudel. Very glad we ended up with this option. The dark mushroom (pate-consistency?) thing inside was really nice - it ended up tasting a bit meaty. And I ended up spooning up all the spicy tomato sauce that surrounded it. Kinda similar to a very fancy calzone.\n* Mushroom fries: A nice (relatively small) stack of delicious fried mushrooms with a creamy dipping sauce. Came out really fast, which I appreciated because I was famished.\n* Croissant donut dessert: Tasted as good as it sounds. Delivered.\n\nOther stuff of note:\n* Sauteed spinach and kale: Didn't expect anything brilliant and didn't get anything brilliant. Got it because I figured we should get a \"healthy\" option.\n* 209-groni: Strong, bitter, and excellent. I'm turning into a negroni person. That being said, I wish it was served straight rather than on small ice. The ice melting and diluting the drink really bothers me and forces me to drink faster than I would like. They probably do it to make it look more voluminous than it really is (but it was still a pretty small glass)\n* Bourbon -... smash? Husband got this. Sweet and sour. Also on small ice. :(.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

In San Fran for business and have had a great experience with so many wonderful restaurants but this was not one of them.\nWhere should I start? How about with bartender that literally did not say two words to us except to get our order.  We ordered a couple of beers and one was flat. The deviled egg plate was actually very good, however the rest of our food was way below par and bordered on bad.\nThe worst was the shrimp salad. Over done shrimp, some strange cocktail sauce dressing that wasn't even mentioned on the menu and loaded with soggy, wilted lettuce. We couldn't even eat it. \nSo there you go.

I decided to come here for dinner for Friday date night with my boyfriend. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. We had outdoor seating, surprisingly it wasn't even cold outside. Anyway, on to the food review. \n\nBacon Wrapped Mini Meatloaf: this was the main reason why I wanted to come here. It was pretty good, but definitely could've tasted better. The meatloaf wasn't salty enough for me. The mash potatoes it came with was deliciously though! \n\nMini Chicken Pot Pie: I was most disappointed in this. The shell of the pot pie was too hard and the inside was kind of bland. I would not recommend getting this. If it wasn't for the smallness of it, I wouldn't have ordered it. (I love mini things, btw) \n\nBacon & Eggs: The bacon on this was delicious! The deviled egg itself was like any other devil egg. Definitely better than other places I've tried. \n\nPB&J: This was the best part of the meal! It tasted just like a PB&J but with ice cream! So yummy!\n\nCinnamon Sugar Cronuts: I wasn't a fan of this. I'm not sure what cronuts are supposed to tastes like, but these tasted undercooked, like the dough inside was still raw. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience.", "author": "Lina C."}

I made a 5:30pm reservation but my bf came earlier and he got seated right away. (We also got the heated seats near the door so it was perfect! SF can be chilly at night so we had the shade and the heater too) We started with several items on the menu: They were out of the pork sliders so we opted for the Kobe Beef. It was alright - nothing too special about it. We had the bowl of fried chicken - this was served in a small basket and no bones so it was easier to eat. The crispiness was perfect and also wasn't too salty. We ordered the bruschetta - served on a soft bread which I liked. When you bite into it, it's less messy. We got the short rib sandwich - lots of cream but I enjoyed it. Cocktails were yum too! Though I forgot what we had. Oops! We also had dessert - their Panna Cotta. This was delicious. Not as good as Lupa's but very good. This is a great spot for people who want to have some nice cocktails and fast service especially after work. The Manager also is very funny - he talks to everyone and ensures that everyone is having a good time. One thing though - be careful with ordering from the happy hour menu.

It was a slow night and our waiter was attentive. He did try to take my plate before I was finished, but my lady friend was finished so it was understandable. Waiter also spilled a bit of red wine while pouring into my glass and told me I'd \"distracted him\" as I had asked for a glass of water while he was pouring. Maybe he was joking? I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming he was joking. \n\nCocktails were delicious with an interesting variety. I opted for the wine on tap. There weren't a lot of choices for wine and I wasn't very pleased with mine, especially at $12 / glass. Should have gone with a cocktail. \n\nWe order the cheese plate, I got the kobe steak dish, and my friend got the (only) vegetarian option, a veggie pastry in tomato sauce. She enjoyed her choice. I found the cheese selection to be fine, but with very small slivers of cheese (probably 1 ounce each, 3 cheeses) which was a bit underwhelming at $15 / plate. The waiter who brought out our cheese plate also didn't remember one of the three options and I had to ask him to go find out. My steak dish was okay. The sauce was delicious, but the potatoes were dry and flavorless and the steak was very tough (i had ordered it rare, too). We skipped dessert and went around the corner to Rickshaw for a delicious round of post dinner drinks instead - the right decision. \n\nWith the total check coming in at just under $100, not including tip, I expected more for the cost of the dinner. Maybe this location is really best for happy hour; I would not recommend it as a dinner choice.", "author": "Beckie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "Sauce is located on a street that will tickle any girls fancy. Located on Belden, Sauce is one of many restaurants lighting up this little alleyway. Tons of fairy lights, color and outdoor seating. Each restaurant plays their part in adding into the whole experience. With a whimsical feel, I'm sure any joint on this street would make a great date spot. \n\nMy gf and I decided to have a double date this past Friday, the night before Valentine's, with her friend and bf. Unfortunately it was pretty last minute. With only a few days before we were set to meetup, our options were pretty limited. I called a dozen other restaurants and they were all booked. No joke, Sauce was probably like my 15th choice. So I took an 8pm reservation for Friday, the 13th... eek!\n\nSAMPLER SOCIAL PLATE ~ 3 stars: This plate was topped with 4 deviled eggs, portobello mushroom fries, mini chicken pot pies and a bowl of bacon. The deviled eggs were creamy, light and delicious. The mushroom fries and mini pot pies were just ok. But the star of the show was the bowl of bacon. Man! Seasoned with black pepper and brown sugar, these things were a blast! They weren't crispy but instead slow cooked to a very tender texture. Excellent to much on and heavenly to eat. If I would have known, I would have just ordered a few of these as our starter. \n\nFRIED ORGANIC ROSIE's CHICKEN ~ 4 stars: The chicken was crispy and prepped beautifully. I didn't have to work too hard to get a big bite of meat each time. The whipped yukon potatoes were excellent. The gravy brought everything together while the sauteed kale added a bit of greens. An excellent dish. The only thing it was missing, in my opinion, was a little acidity. I probably should have requested a lemon wedge but it really wasn't a deal breaker. Great dish and I would order it again. \n\nBRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS STROGANOFF ~ 4 stars: Tender bites of short ribs sitting on top of parpadelle. Sounds amazing. But they takes it up another notch with their awesome cream sauce, buttered mushrooms and asparagus. This was a complete meal made for a king. The short ribs were tender, moist and completely to die for. The parpadelle was cooked perfectly and went beautifully with the cream sauce. Everything worked on this plate. I also like that it's a HUGE portion. My gf got this and luckily for me, she couldn't finish it. So I went to town on her leftovers. \n\nThe other couple ordered the PEPPERED HANGER STEAK and the short ribs stroganoff. I didn't try the hanger steak but judging by how quickly they cleaned the plate, it was probably pretty damn good. \n\nSauce also offers a pretty healthy list of premium cocktails. I tried their Moscow Mule and it was poured perfectly - tart and refreshing. I then followed that with 2 gin & tonics. Those were also poured beautifully. \n\nAll in all, Sauce was a hit. It's funny how it wasn't even close to our first choice for dinner but it turned out being a winner.", "author": "Bruce C."}

The location is a bit strange, it is literally in an alley which made it a bit weird but nonetheless once you get past that you will be in a quirky restaurant alley. The alley is well lit once inside, there are about 2-3 other restaurants located in the alley as well. There is plenty of outdoor seating and indoor as well.\nThe menu is not too big but offers an array of options that can satisfy any appetite. We decided to start with the portobello mushroom fries, ham tater tots and the crab cakes that were the night special. All were exceptional! By far the appetizers were my favorite part of my meal, I would recommend ordering a bunch of appetizers and sharing them for your full meal.\nI got the cut steak with salad as my entree, it was made very well at a good medium, however the portion is small. The fries that came with it were damn good as well.\nLastly we decided to have the smores as dessert, 2 of them that were perfect to end our meal.

That is actually more than enough to feed two people with explosive, intense flavors. I also ordered the chicken off main entree menu once, it was tender and flavorful but didn't blow my mind.

Nothing really stood out other than the bowl of bacon. Each of the appetizer made for good Instagram pictures, but they were just alright in terms of taste. For my entree, I got the Lobster Roll, and it was great. They fit chunky pieces of lobsters into a perfectly toasted roll, and each bite was filled with crispy-lobsterly goodness. The distinct taste of lobster explodes in your mouth, making you secretly wish you had an extra $27 so you can encore your order. Big bonus is that they serve some really good fries with your order, too.\n\nI gotta give a shout out to our awesome waiter, Victor/Richard (i think that's his name). Funny guy who really paid attention to us despite having to serve a busy restaurant. He brought a lemon for my girlfriend's hot water and asked twice if she needed a refill.

Yes, Sauce is mainly a bar, and there was no forgetting that fact with how loud other people were being.

At least Sauce doesn't have a host out in front trying to wave people into the restaurant. This place does fill up a bit during lunch hour, so it can't hurt to make a reservation (but definitely not required).\n\nPortions are small, which makes this quite a pricey lunch. There's a confusing footnote about splitting entrees on the menu. The social plates are free to share, but if you explicitly say you are splitting an entree, you pay $2 extra for an extra plate. They say they give you more food as a result of splitting, but I don't know about that. My friend and I ordered the below items and did not say anything about splitting, and we were not charged the extra $2.\n\n- Lobster Bisque ($14.50): Very creamy and comes with a very small island of crostini and a wee bit of lobster meat. I'm glad we shared this because the richness gets a bit sickening after half of the portion.\n\n- Mini Chicken Pot Pies ($10.50): This comes with 4 \"open-faced\" chicken pot pies, so it's an easy shared plate. Chicken was very tender and the whole thing is not too salty, which usually seems to be my problem with chicken pot pies.\n\nThe wait staff here were so sweet! The interior is relatively trendy with high top tables. The food isn't bad, but this was a light meal that added up to $16 each after tax/tip, so I wouldn't say it's a bang for your buck either.", "author": "Jessica F."}

Some people who I went with (who had been before) highly recommended the mushroom fries, so we got two orders for four people. They were pretty decent, slices of mushroom that were battered and fried, and came with a nice sauce.\n\nFor an entree I got the veggie burger, which was a little softer than I'd like and didn't have all that much flavor to it either. I also asked the waiter if I could sub out my salad for the tomato bisque instead, and he was really helpful and got that done for me. The soup itself was a little too creamy and didn't have enough tomato flavor, and the truffle grilled cheese piece that came with it didn't taste that great either. I know truffles taste amazing, but you can't just throw them into an otherwise mediocre grilled cheese and expect it to come out great.\n\nPerhaps the place is just a little less vegetarian friendly.

We decided to go with Sauce in the financial district. Belden Lane is a tiny \"seafood lane\" that is tucked away between two large buildings. I was surprised that they could fit so many restaurants into such a small little alley. I really loved the feel of Belden Lane.\n\nAt first I noticed that this place is a HOT spot for business people having a small beer or dinner after work. Everyone was dressed in business wear except for a small few. I'm guessing the happy hour is pretty sweet from 5-7pm, but unfortunately I missed it because my reservation was at 8pm.\n\nThe Dine About Town menu (~$37) was pretty limited other than the entree portion of the meal. \n- \"Bacon and Eggs\" (deviled eggs topped with a honey bacon and mushroom fries). (I liked the deviled eggs) That appetizer seemed to be a lot better than the brussel sprout salad. \n- Sadly there was only one choice for the dessert a pumpkin bread dessert which tasted really good. (very spiced pumpkin for all those pumpkin lovers)\n\n- I got the \"Maine Lobster Roll\" thanks to some Yelper reviews and overall I thought it was a good dish. It's definitely \"chewy\" as some reviews have noted. I was expecting a much creamer consistency, but it's literally chunks of lobster pieces on 2 slices of biscotti shaped pieces of bread. I enjoyed the roll though I can imagine that there are better places to get a lobster dish.\n\n- My boyfriend got the salmon entree also off the DAT menu and it was cooked slightly more than I'd like. The dish is a pretty standard salmon dish.\n\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed with my experience I'd say it's a bit pricy for standard dishes.", "author": "Alice H."}

But I was really bothered by how they did the bill, and feel a need to vent on the subject. \nThis establishment is not alone in pissing me off by calling out the Healthy San Francisco surcharge, which is simply a cost of doing business in this great foodie city where the employees that make the money for their employers need and deserve health coverage. \nBut Sauce took it a step too far for me by not sub-totaling the bill before adding on the surcharge (or the tax, which should also be excluded when figuring the tip, BTW). \nClearly the intention of presenting the bill like this is to have patrons figure the tip WITH the surcharge included, increasing the total to be tipped on --and to make us resent the mandate at the same time.\nSince I don't see restaurants pointing out that I am paying a portion of their electric bill, or the rent, or the fees they pay to the restaurant association and such like, I very much resent any restaurant pointing the surcharge out to me, as if to signal that I should be pissed off that the City requires it, when in fact I fully approve of this mandate. \nBut adding it into the bill as Sauce does make me think even worse of this place, and any others doing the same.\nIt makes me suspect that their business model doesn't allow for proper total compensation for their employees, so they have come up with a way to dupe customers into making up for what the business is not providing to their staff.\nAs someone who's waited tables, I'm very happy to tip well-- but this practice is simply sleazy, and insulting to both server and customer.", "author": "Cat F."}

The lobster roll came with a good portion of seasoned shoestring fries and some mixed greens in a vinaigrette. \n     - Niman Ranch hanger steak ($24). The steak was cooked medium-rare as ordered and a topped with a tasty sauce.

Couldn't figure how the poached eggs complemented the dish. Was I supposed to dip my steak into the eggs?\n\nOverall, the food was delicious but the portions were on the small side.

Might've been because we were so buzzed off the cocktail (read, ONE, not plural) we downed on an empty stomach at the Rickhouse down the block but all three dishes were solid without trying too hard to be creative. Flavors were not overpowering, overly salty or bland.\n\nStarted off with Deviled Eggs & Portobello Fries- simple, nothing special (Erika's had better) but it was fine for not being rich or greasy.\n\nThe Hawaiian butterfish with risotto croquette and brussel sprout salad: the fish cut like butter - delicious. I liked the croquette the least - risotto was a little underdone and gave the croquette a pebbly texture that was off-putting with the smooth fish.\n\nFor dessert, the Oatmeal Cookie Bon Bons were perfectly creamy and gave the impression of cheesecake. Even though the rum soaked raisins were just a bit too strong on their own and had to be paired with the bons bons with each bite, topped off with one whole strawberry, brown sugar and cream, the meal ended satisfyingly.... sweet.\n\nI couldn't decide between 3.5 or 4 stars for this place, but I would definitely come back again.", "author": "Liana L."}

The shrimp was done just right too. Finally, dessert. Chef Ben, whatever you did to make this your own, you just owned this. We had the peanut butter and jelly sandwich with vanilla ice cream.

Come here for apps and cocktails before a meal elsewhere. \n\nAPPS:\nWe ordered the sampler platter which included the crab rangoons, portobello fries, deviled eggs, and bowl of bacon. \n- Rangoons were nicely fried and the crab tasted fresh. \n- Fries were crunchy, meaty, and juicy with the right amount of seasoning. \n- deviled eggs were standard, nothing special but yummy none the less (would have been better if it had a little kick of cayenne or something). \n- the bowl of bacon was simple but awesome--candied but salty and smokey, almost with a grilled aroma. \nGreat yummy plate to start.\n(4/5 stars) \n\nENTREES:\nAmongst 6 of us, we ordered 2 braised short rib stroganoffs, 2 medium rare New York pepper steaks, and 1 seared salmon. \n\nStroganoff - the noodles weren't tossed very well and were in dire need of seasoning. the braised short ribs were tender and seasoned well (and served without rib). the hen of the woods mushrooms were a great textural touch in the dish, but overall nothing spectacular in flavor for this plate.\n(3/5 stars)\n\nNY Steak - I was most excited for this one because it's a cute play on steak and potatoes, but unfortunately was very let down. Firstly, the fig and blue cheese salad that the meat was served on was severely overdressed and over salted. The arugula was soaked beyond recognition in a dressing that was already so so so salty to begin with. The addition of the blue cheese did not help with the sodium :( the steak itself was cooked to a nice medium rare, but by the time it got to us, it was already a little cold-- likely because they wanted to serve everything at once and the cooking time varied for each item. It lacked the \"fresh off the fire\" look and taste, and became a little tough to chew. There was a big pool of demi glace around the steak (and salad) that was also heavily over salted. Half the amount of liquid over a fresh steak would have done the job. Sadly, the most enjoyable thing on the plate were the fried potato skins that came in a cute little brown paper bag and served with a side of sour cream, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese. This plate has so much potential to be delicious but the execution was lacking heavily and I just got mouthfuls of salt salt and more salt. Hopefully it was just an off night?\n(2/5 stars) \n\nSeared salmon - salmon was probably the best executed protein of the night. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and flakey. There was a nice sear and it had just the right amount of seasoning. Unfortunately the salad it was sitting on was also overdressed. IMHO salad should be a nice light crunch to compliment the dish-- maybe this restaurant believes it should be a vehicle for the protein's sauce? \n(3.5/5 stars) \n\nDESSERT: \n\nPB&J ice cream cake - brought my back to childhood! Nice and moist cake sandwiching delicious and creamy ice cream. Served with a berry sauce. Would try again. \n(4/5 stars) \n\ncinnamon sugar doughnuts - a lot denser than expected, wanted something more light and airy inside but just my personal preference for doughnuts. Also a bit over fried. But vanilla bourbon sauce was awesome. (3/5 stars)\n\nStrawberries and cream - the most simple and surprisingly the BEST of all the desserts. 5 strawberries served on a bed of fresh whipped cream with a pile of fine brown sugar on top. swirl the berry into the cream and roll it into the sugar-- wowowowowow. \n(5/5 stars) \n\nETC: \n- Belden place is a cute alleyway with other upscale places. Outdoor seating is nice if its not too chilly since they have heaters. \n- Service was nice. \n- The outdoor tables have plates set up before guests arrive, but they sometimes collect dust and ash from the surrounding restaurants so you may have to change them before actually eating.", "author": "Erin N."}

(Nuff said) and everything we had was great! \nWe started with the Portobello mushroom fries, deviled eggs, & brussel sprout salad and continued with the Grilled, Garlic Shrimp & Crab Louie salad and the Peppered Hangar Steak! Everything was delicious - the mushroom fries and hangar steak are a MUST have! They cooked the steak exactly as ordered and the mushroom fries are crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Scoutmob offered a deal on this place so my coworker and I decided to try it out.  We ordered the following:\n\nPortobello mushroom french fries \nBeet and Goat Cheese salad\nLobster sandwich\n\nThe mushrooms were probably my favorite out of the three.  Totally different; nicely seasoned.  It was a delicious surprise!  The salad was pretty satisfying.  Good portion with a decent amount of fresh beets.  The added touch was the deep fried goat cheese balls. YUM!  The lobster was my least favorite - not that it wasn't good, it was ok. I personally thought it was a bit on the chewy end and not as warm but then again, we were too busy eating the salad and the mushrooms, the sandwich must have cooled off.\n\nServer was friendly and attentive.  If it weren't for the scoutmob deal, I would say that this place was a bit on the pricey end for an overall \"OK\" meal.  But I came back again, only this time time around, my brother paid for my full price meal! Thanks Bro!", "author": "Diana M."}

Unfortunately the restaurant we were interested in was still closed for another 20 minutes, so we decided to go to Sauce in the meanwhile.\n\nWe both ordered one drink off their happy hour menu, I ordered the mojito and she ordered the margarita. Since we were hungry, we also ordered two appetizers, the bruschetta and the portobello fries. \nThe bruschetta was not a real bruschetta, since it had some sort of cream cheese on it (??? Why???), other than that it was just ok, the tomatoes were rather flavorless, but there's only so much you can mess up on a bruschetta, it still is bread and tomatoes.\nThe Portobello fries look great at first sight, but when we tasted it is kind of tasted like a bad batch of oddly breaded portobello mushrooms. \n\nOther than that, our server was a bit too eager and seemed a bit too excited to finally have customers (not in a good way). \n\nWe decided to pay and go to the restaurant next door, then when we got the bill it was a total of $45, for 2 appetizers and 2 drinks during happy hour?! \n\nNext time, I'll just wait the 20 min and stand outside until a better restaurant opens up.", "author": "Helen D."}

The Mini Chicken Pot Pies and the Mac and Cheese were particularly noteworthy. They shared the Lobster Bisque while we shared the Tomato Bisque and they were both delicious--although I preferred the Tomato Bisque since it was accompanied by focaccia bread with melted gruyere and truffle oil.

We were presented a prix fixe menu, for $60, with a a few optional upgrades, for an additional cost, such as foie gras for an additional $10. There was also a vegetarian prix fixe. I had looked at the website earlier, and was looking to order some of the menu items that were well reviewed, so I was disappointed with this menu.\n\nOur dinner started around 9:30pm and we had very long gaps between courses. After 10pm, a couple was seated next to us, and proceeded to have their entire meal, of three courses including dessert, prior to us being served our main course. That's one reason why we noticed they were not being served the prix fixe menu, they apparently were allowed to order off of the regular menu. This increased our disappointment because they were served a couple of the dishes I wanted to order originally. We did in the end actually order an additional dessert to share at our table.\n\nThe total bill was too high for the overall quantity and quality of the food. Our neighbor table's salmon for $22.50 looked like a substantial dinner entree. On the other hand, every one of our four courses in the prix fixe appeared to be miniaturized. One good point was the 500ml carafe of wine served at a fairly reasonable price. Unlikely to return unless I call and verify there is no mandatory prix fixe.", "author": "Eric L."}

In short, the three of us wouldn't shut-up with each bite exclaiming how fantastic everything was, with the exception of the cauliflower salad (it was definitely good, but not as fantastic as everything else).\n\nI could go on and on about each of these dishes, but in the interest of time I'll give the short version :)\n\nHighlights:\n- The bacon wrapped meat loaf was perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned - the meat loaf was out of this world. It comes with mashed potatoes, which were good but nothing to write home about. \n\n- The lobster bisque was perfect! The consistency was perfect, it was beautifully creamy and lobstery. It comes with a nicely sized and beautifully cooked piece of lobster on top.\n\n- The pork chop was amazing - cooked perfectly - so well that it would be easy to cut with a bread knife. The flavors were fantastic: at first you get the beautiful cherry and wine flavors of the sauce then a slight smokiness from the meat, then a tinny bite on the backend of the flavor profile of chili pepper. The sides are candied sweet potatoes, which we all practically were fighting over, and broccoli.\n\n- The Wellington...oh the Wellington!

For drinks, I had the barrel-aged root herb Manhattan, which was good but not great, and a drunk grandma or something like that, which had ginger, mint, and whiskey, and was very tasty.

I wanted to love everything, but it didn't work out that way. Sadly, they were short staffed. Our server was very pleasant but because he had so many tables to cover, it was hard for him to bring out the orders in a timely manner. Even asking for salt and pepper took an unusually long time. Which brings me to my next comment. Pros: Mac and cheese was delicious. Tomato soup was fresh and delicious. Mojito was tasty. Wontons were crispy and tasty. Wedge salad was yummy and creatively presented. Cons: Chicken pot pies came out cold, so are they prepared in advance or were they frozen? I had to return them to be heated up. And they were my least favorite. They had a consistency of mashed up dark meat instead of a creamy texture as is typical of pot pies. They lacked seasoning, thus the salt and pepper request. Steak was undercooked and lacked seasoning. We asked for medium rare , not rare. Lobster roll had very little lobster. \n\nWe did not order dessert. Next time, I hope to have more consistency in food seasoning and that the staff show up to their assigned shifts. Our waiter didn't deserve to be short handed.", "author": "ibby m."}

The outdoor seating isn't so bad, as long as you're by the heat lamps. Some days it can be really bustling outside since it's in an alley along with a bunch of other restaurants that have outdoor seating. \n\nItems we ordered:\n~ Maine Lobster Roll: be warned, the salad on this dish was extremely salty! I think it was a mistake and they accidentally washed it in saltwater. The lobster roll itself was delicious though, and tasted extremely fresh. The roll was toasted perfectly and there was no mayonnaise sauce to corrupt the flavor (or add unnecessary calories).\n~ Portobello Mushroom Fries: this didn't quite meet my expectations based on all the rave reviews it was getting. It only came with 8 pieces, and a ranch-like dressing (although better than your standard ranch). Maybe it wasn't quite as crispy on the outside or as piping hot as I thought it could be on the inside.\n~ Brussels Sprouts Salad: a sweet salad that was nice and refreshing.\n~ Seared Butterfish: I felt like this was slightly overcooked, but still tasty. The brussels sprouts and carrots went well with this dish. \n~ Corned Beef & Cabbage: great dish! The cippolini onions were so sweet and tasty. I normally don't like onions too. \n\nWe finished it all off with the PB&J sandwich, which came out much more frozen than the last time. It was so cold that the ice cream was quite firm -- you could pretty much bite into it, and the peanut butter was almost hard as a rock! This wasn't exactly what I remembered.

What was great was the ambiance on the patio, the service, the portobello mushroom fries, the wedge salad and the beet salad (I don't even like beets and it was delish!). What was just okay was the mac n cheese and the crab rangoons.  Mac was bland and the crab rangoons were also bland and a tad soggy.  I had a ginger cosmo, two of them actually, that was one of the best cocktails I've ever had and our friend had a couple of the rye cocktails with the candied sugar swizzle stick and said they were really good.  We will be back to try more of the fare, that's for sure.", "author": "Rachel H."}

The restaurant is off of an alley that it shares with maybe 3-5 other restaurants. It's cute with lots of patio dining.  We ordered the following:\n-Eggs & bacon: pretty solid deviled eggs but the bacon made them.\n-BOWL OF BACON: this was amazing. Being from Chicago, it seems like SF food/restaurants prices are a little more than Chicago on average. The bowl of bacon was amazingly delicious but I also considered the portion to be generous and based on the price, it's actually a pretty sweet deal. I'd pay more for this at home or in San Fran. It truly is thick cut bacon (awesome, places don't get this right). The brown sugar is perfect. Not too much. Not too breakfasty. So good.\n-Sauteed Spinach & Kale: pretty light, good way to get your greens in. My boyfriend and I actually added bacon to our spinach & kale.\n-Texas Wild Boar Chili: pretty solid. Also generous portion.\n-American Honey Side Car: I don't love American Honey but my bf does. Regardless, this was so tasty.\n-Bourbon Smashed Grand Ma: whooo boy this had a bit of a punch but it got better as I drank it. Kind of a bourbon mojito. Yum.", "author": "Emily M."}

I have honestly had better.   The two drinks my friend and I had were okay.  \n\nI ordered the burger- which I ordered Medium Well (I refuse to eat ground beef any more rare)- and well, after 30-40 minutes, my burger came out-  medium rare.   Maybe it was just the server didn't hear me correctly, or the chef decided he wanted to give me something I didn't order. \n\nEither way, when I told them that the burger was undercooked-  I was fine with just eating the fries and side salad-  as I rarely send food back and expect it to come back without any \"added\" toppings I didn't want.   That, and we had already been at the restaurant for about 45 minutes at this point.  \n\nThe waitress was adamant about taking the burger back and \"re-plating\" my salad and fries, after I said no it's fine.   The salad and fries came back, with either the manager or some guy that was the bartender for the evening- who had a complete attitude.  This is why they are getting such a low rating.  The food was okay, not excellent- but to get served a side dish of argument and attitude when I didn't even want the burger sent back, not okay.  \n\nThe customer is always right- and I was polite about my criticism.  The guy on the other hand took it upon himself to kind of \"argue\" with me and get an attitude, followed by sending out two drinks to hopefully compensate me and make me feel better about things.  \n\nGiven the horrible service, and attitude from management, I won't be back.  The waitstaff was great- management, yeah- you ruined it.", "author": "J B."}

Turns out it is a rather small caf\u00e9, but enhanced by outdoor seating in the walking-only alley which is Belden Place. the alley has a lot of options, and seems very European as others noted. It was nice the patio sections were partitioned off with plastic sheeting, which cut down on the cold wind factor, as well as noise. First off the waitress was really friendly and helpful - I'd give the service 4 stars. She was present when needed, helped me by recommending a cup instead of bowl of chili which was spot on. and turns out the Check Please episode was from several years ago.I didn't have my notes with me, so we ordered just randomly.  The shrimp and artichoke wontons were \"meh\".  I had one (of the 4 on plate) and didn't like enough to have another...which is rare since I love artichokes and like shrimp.  the taste was just off.  the ham Hock Tater tots were more plentiful, but really couldn't tell where the ham Hock was.  seemed like lightly flavored potatoes balls covered in panko and baked.  sauces were tasty, but not super.  The Corn and tomato salad was really good, however I would recommend they add more heirloom tomato and in slices.  the Boar chili was sadly mostly beans.  I think they were pinto but they actually looked like black eyed peas.  I t was okay, but not fabulous.  My mate had the steak and potato which looked very good.  The waitress had described the potato as a deconstructed potato skins, but it was really fries with the fixins.  still they were fresh cut from potatoes so i'll give it that.  The bathrooms are unisex, and very dimly lit...which is a pet peeve for several reasons.  It is also hard to use your purse to do makeup touchup when there isn't counter space. Overall it's a nice atmosphere and I would go back...but next time try the PBJ dessert, the Short Ribs, the Meatloaf, and the mushroom fries.  Oh, I am also not a fan of the trendy Kale, Mac n cheese, and Fried Chicken options that seem to appear on every menu on the West coast since 2010...rarely do any of these meet my expectations, and I wish every restaurant wouldn't feel like they have to have them on the menu.

I actually work across the street... never realized there was so much stuff in this alley!  Anyway....\n\nGood option for happy hour since it doesn't appear to get crowded, and happy hour lasts until 7:00 (so annoying when places stop their h/h at 6:00).  The bartenders are friendly and since they are not overwhelmed by a crowd, they are great about inventing drinks for you, which they make with just enough kick.  \n\nThe \"social plates\" are definitely the way to go.  My buddy and I shared a few of these along with 3 drinks a piece.  The food had some hits, but some things that were just okay.  Here's the breakdown.\n\n1. Bacon wrapped mini meatloaf on a bed of mashed potatoes = stellar.  This was a last minute item, that we ordered after eating everything else and were still hungry.  I was very impressed.  The meatloaf was flavorful and nicely complemented by a strip of crisp bacon (as opposed to soggy, which is usually how bacon wrapped stuff goes). \n2. Portabello fries = delicious.  These were interesting.  kind of like zucchini strips but with mushroom.  The serving size was appropriate (6 \"fries\") though the $10 price was a bit steep.\n3. Lobster bisque = okay.  The soup itself was alright.  Had better lobster bisque.  I really liked the piece of lobster and the crouton on top of the bisque, but it was a small piece, and I only got to eat 1/2 of it since we were sharing everything.  \n4. Corn and heirloom tomato salad = okay.  This was touted as being in a creamed corn emulsion or something, but it seemed more like plain corn off the cob without much seasoning to it. \n5. Deviled eggs = nothing to get excited about.  The texture of the filling was nice and creamy, but it lacked any kick, so overall the dish was bland.  \n\nOverall, I can see myself coming back to this place to try out more of their stuff.

She said it was fun, delicious food and great environment.  I was impressed with the phone call the day prior, confirming my reservation and also confirming that it was my birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted outside, I mentioned we had a reservation and were waiting for the rest of our party and would get a drink at the bar.  We ordered our drinks and immediately were told our table was ready. I liked that the staff was on top of things, but it felt pushy, especially since I had just mentioned that we were waiting for the rest of our party and just had ordered drinks. I again said we are waiting and would like to have our drinks at the bar.  The rest of our party arrived and we were seated.  The outside seating area is quaint and nice, European feel. We reviewed the menu which has quite a bit of what they call social plates ( small plates to share) and then entree's.  We decided to order some of the social plates. Portabello mushroom fries and the baked mac and cheese.   We mentioned to the waitress we would keep the menus so we could decide on our entrees.  Not 3 minutes later did another person come over and ask if we wanted to order.  I then mentioned that we ordered some starters and wanted to wait to order the entrees.  Again, this was a nice gesture, but I got the sense they wanted to push us out of there. We received the starters which were delicious.  Ordered our entrees and two of the couples asked if they could split.  We received our entrees which were beautifully plated, however, they didn't not split the entrees onto two plates.  Which is a little frustrating.  Dessert menus were offered and we ordered the cronuts, PB&J and coffee. Not once did they mention anything about my birthday.  I thought they might put a candle in the cronuts.  No such luck, both desserts arrived and nothing.  All in all I have to say that the food was delicious at Sauce. I just felt the whole dinner felt rushed, the wait staff had zero personality and I was very disappointed  that nothing was done for my birthday. Like I said a candle in the cronuts would have been a nice touch. Not sure if it was an off night for them, but I am not sure I would return.", "author": "Anne M."}

They both were a nightmare. In Germany they say that: when the food is too salty the cook must be in love. Sauce's cook must be madly in love, because both dishes tasted like if they had been cooked on seawater.\nThe other 2 dishes we had were uneventful and not worth to describe or mention. Probably due to the excess of salt of the previous ones.\nThe waiter and staff were nice and welcoming, that is why we can give the restaurant 1 star. \nI just wish the waiter would have warned us and directed us towards a better choice, but he seemed to like or had been instructed to push the Lobster Bisque, since when we left he recommended it to another guest.\nThe decor is pretty poor and they should work on improving the bathrooms.\nThe heaters outside work pretty well, so at least you can be outside.", "author": "Barca.cielo.ola B."}

I love how the bisque comes out with lobster sitting on a crostini in the middle of the bowl then they pour the soup over it when they bring it to the table. Amazing! Both dishes were soooo good and I'll definitely order them again but I doubt I'll want to share next time!

The staff was very welcoming and the ambiance is minimalist and modern, dim but not dark.  Having it to do over again I would have sat outside to catch a bit of a breeze because the interior felt a bit warm and stuffy, but not horrible.  However this is coming from Texas where I'm used to every business blasting ac and fans indoors, so it's probably me.  Our waitress was very attentive and upbeat, yet not overwhelming.  We got mushroom fries which had a good flavor.  My husband got the stroganoff which he really enjoyed, and I got the vegetable strudel which was also delicious.  The vegetables inside were cooked down which made it very cohesive and it stayed together well.  It's refreshing to see non-boring vegetarian options on a small menu. The portions were ample and we had no room for dessert.  Every other dish we saw go by looked well presented and appealing.  Overall, great experience, very solid meal with no downsides other than the price, but we knew what we were getting into.", "author": "Holly W."}

However, I was not a big fan of the food we ordered.  I was immediately drawn to the mini pot pies. I was hoping for true homestyle creamy pot pie and instead got something much more dry that truthfully tasted like dogfood.  I had read the mac n' cheese was bland in someone else's review and couldn't disagree more... It was super flavorful and salty, almost a little too salty and I love salt so that is saying a lot for me to call something salty. The last item we ordered was the tomato bisque soup, which I was also not a huge fan of but my husband liked it. I compare all tomato bisque soup to the Nordstrom Cafe tomato bisque, which is heaven, so my standards are a bit high. The service however was fabulous! Our server Shannon was very friendly and attentive and if I had any balls at all I would have told her what I thought about the food but I felt bad b/c she was so sweet.

My colleagues and I went here for our holiday party, ten of us. Kwame was our server, and he was AWESOME! He got all of the orders correct (food and drinks), the food came out in a timely manner, and at the end of it all, he happily took two credit cards and cash to settle our complicated bill. There's a nice assortment of bar drinks that everyone seemed to enjoy, and I really enjoyed my wine served from, for lack of a better word, a wine keg. It tasted like a freshly opened bottle, and one may purchase a glass or a caraffe (they also have bottles.) And for the food -- AMAZING! We started wth mushroom fries (admittedly they seemed weird at first because it's the texture of a mushroom rather than potato, but they were really tasty and great for sharing), and chicken wings (these were magical and came with a really tasty sauce, also good for sharing.) For dinner, I had the braised short rib with au gratin potatoes. Positively fantastic! Cooked to perfection and delicious. Several of us had this and liked it a lot. Another had the butter fish and reported the same -- perfectly cooked and delicious. A couple of people had and raved about the lobster roll. We also shared one dessert sampler, and all of the desserts were amazing.
