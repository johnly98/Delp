Ramen was first introduced to Japan in 1859 by Chinese immigrants. Many amazing ramen restaurants' owners in Japan have Chinese descendants. So I am always hopeful when trying Chinese owned ramen shop here or in Europe. Sadly I have never encountered a good one outside of Japan.\n\nI sensed star of anise in Coco's broth. It does not belong there. I think when you add anise in the broth, it become Chinese noodle not ramen.", "author": "Chie J."}

For awhile, I thought they forgot about us because the people waiting for a seat were standing RIGHT behind us. \n\nBut good thing, they gave us our tea and water. That seat would have been great on a warmer night, but I felt the AC was just right on top of us. Their ramen is a bit on the pricey side.. Would I come back? Probably not. \n\nParking is very scarce and it is all street parking. But we were lucky to get a spot nearby. \n\nI think they were annoyed at us because we kept asking for refills on our tea, they gave us a little teapot, but we drank it all and had to ask for more tea.

I had heard only good things, and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen ($12.95), while my lovely girlfriend ordered the miso ramen ($12.95). As an appetizer we got the Takoyaki ($6.00). I have always wanted to try it so I thought I'd give it a shot! \n\nThe Tonkatsu ramen was good! I had no complaints about my meal overall. It came with 3 good sized pieces of Pork belly, which is just about right, the noodles were tasty, and the broth was really good. My girlfriend especially enjoyed her Miso ramen, and I had some as well and thought it was good as well, even though miso isn't my favorite. \n\nThe Takoyaki tasted very good. It was my first time having it so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it tasted good to me! \n\nThe venue is a bit small, and once more people started to come it did get a bit cramped, but I go to restaurants to eat. As long as the food is good, and I'm not feeling uncomfortable I'm not going to lower my rating because of how cramped it was. Everything was good. Wasn't the best ramen I ever had, but I think 4/5 stars is a perfect review for it. Definitely a must try!", "author": "John James M."}

We did end up sharing a table with another party of 2 though because space is a premium here.\n\nI opted for garlic miso ramen, mild spicy, with pork shoulder while my brother went with curry ramen, medium spicy, with pork belly. At first, I felt like my noodles were a little less than al dente and too chewy, but as I let it soak in the broth a little longer, it did eventually reach the right chewiness for me. But what was most memorable for me was the pork shoulder! Most places slice their char-siu paper thin so to come to a place that gave (3) solid 1/4\" slices was amazing! It was also tender and super flavorful to boot - a must try, in my opinion! I also traded one slice to my brother for a slice of the pork belly. It was also very good: tender and melt in your mouth decadent...but I definitely felt like the char-siu is a winner here. We also opted to share an order of agedashi tofu. Delivered piping hot and freshly fried, I thought it hit all the right notes.\n\nAll in all, as far as ramen goes in San Francisco, I have to say that Coco's Ramen was probably one of the better ones I've had lately.

I was suckered into coming here because I didn't want to go into Japantown and wait hella long for ramen, so I decided to check out this place because it had a decent Yelp rating, and...\n\nI honestly have no idea how this place has a 4-star review because it tastes like... regular 'ol Chinese noodle soup. I got the Tonkotsu Ramen and it tasted like anything but. The fattiness and richness of the soup just wasn't up to snuff, and everything else about the experience, including the chashu and noodles was kinda gross.\n\nOn top of that, I also tried the Chicken Karaage which was a major disappointment as well. It's dry, but not even really that crispy and tbh I'd prefer to order some popcorn chicken from a local boba shop or something rather than get the chicken karaage here again.\n\nIf you're tempted to come here because you think you'll get okay ramen, THINK AGAIN. I honestly want to say I have pretty low standards when it comes to being satisfied by food - most of my low reviews come from places having bad service, but this place just isn't really good ramen.

They gave us one of the last tables, which we got super lucky.   The menu had a variety of appetizers and skewers.   And the other menu had their ramen choices.  \n\nWe got the calamari and it was pretty good.  The batter was perfect and it was fresh.  The Chicken Karaage was ok, the batter was a little be too much.   We also got the beef tongue skewers, which was overly seasoned.    It was so salty and chewy.  I felt they overcooked it. \n\nFor the Ramen they have flavors such as Miso, tonkatsu, seafood, curry and much more.  My friend loved their Curry one so much and you can tell them what level of spiciness you want.  I got the tonkatsu flavor one and i loved the soup.   You have options of getting your ramen with pork shoulder or the pork belly.   The pork belly usually has more fat, so if you like that, i recommend it.  However, i like the pork shoulder because it was very tender.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, the noise level is a little loud, it was hard hearing my friends.

The wait wasn't too bad, and we were able to be seated in ten or so minutes. The interior was very cozy, with dimmed lighting and is good for having conversations without too much noise.\n\nThe ramen menu is pretty straightforward with your popular ramen types such as shoyu (soy sauce base), miso (creamy base), shio (salt base), and even other options such as vegetarian or curry broth. For each ramen, you can adjust the spice level as well as choices of garlic and type of pork in your soup (pork belly or chashu). I liked how they used both pork + chicken stock in the broth here as some places that use pure pork tend to have soups that are a bit too heavy for my liking. \n\nI went with the miso ramen and added garlic in the broth for a more refreshing taste. The miso ramen came with bean sprouts, bamboo, and seaweed along with the pork belly. I'm not even a huge fan of pork, but their pork belly was extremely tasty and felt like it melted in my mouth. I'm always a huge fan of spicy food, so I got my broth extra spicy. If you're accustomed to spice, spicy or extra spicy is fine and not over-the-top. Japanese style ramen tends to be on the more hearty side rather than spicy, so don't worry too much about going up on the spice levels here. The portion sizes were very fair for the price, as there are definitely other ramen joints in SF that give you less for a higher price. I regretted not getting the side of extra noodles to really use the leftover broth after my first round. \n\nGood portions, cozy setting, and delicious pork belly: what're you waiting for? Definitely recommend checking Coco's ramen out if you're in SF.", "author": "Mike C."}

I'm a pretty avid eater of ramen and maybe it was just an off kind of night. \n\nWhy I was here // Came here on a Friday night around 5:30pm. I'm a bit under the weather and I told my bf I wanted something to warm my soul...his answer was ramen. \n\nParking // Street parking, after 6pm you don't have to pay for meter, but before then, make sure to have a few quarters in your pocket. \n\nService // I felt mixed about their service. When we first arrived it was pretty empty, maybe a like 3 other parties in the restaurant with ample seating. They asked us to sit at the bar, but we wanted a table, because their bar area is directly in front of the register where the other waitresses hang out...we wanted a bit more privacy while eating our food. They give us the table, but remark that normally they are so busy and that we would have to share a table...ok, that's fine with me...I just didn't want to sit at the bar with uncomfortable chairs. \nTheir bench seating is extremely uncomfortable, the table almost touches the tops of my thighs...\n\nFood // Disappointed \n-Appetizer // Beef tongue yakitori // 5.00 // This really whet our appetite! This was delicious and had really good seasoning. \n-Appetizer // Fried kabocha // 10.00 // Looks unique but is NOT worth it. Terribly bland. The waitress even mentioned that they didn't season with sugar to keep the kabocha flavor...but it was bland and had a strange sour flavor to it. They put an egg inside though... cool?\n-Main // spicy miso ramen with chashu // The broth was salty and thin; miso broth was advertised as creamy but it was completely clear and weak as a broth base.

Good enough to satisfy a hankering, but not something to go out of your way for nor subject yourself to a long wait.  Oddly enough, it's hard to find a tonkotsu broth better than what's offered by that chain, Ippudo.\n\nFried Kabocha: This looked too cool not to get.  Kinda like a Scotch Egg, but with sweet kabocha instead of sausage.  Unfortunately, it looked a lot better than it tasted.  While the thin outer shell was nice and crispy, the inside was cold and pasty.  Like this had been sitting in the fridge and they threw it in a deep fryer for a few seconds.  Also, it seemed like an excessive amount of kabocha paste compared to the amount of egg.  That really reinforced the pastiness.\n\nTonkotsu Ramen w/ Pork Belly & Black Garlic: It was decent, but nothing to go out of your way for.  The broth looked white and cloudy, but it didn't seem that rich.  Noodles were ok, chewy as they should be.  There was a generous amount of pork belly.

Very thin exterior and a flavorful filling. I think it could have been fried a bit longer but that's just personal preference.

Not something I'd normally order but I enjoyed it (3.5/5)\n3) Bacon wrapped mochi: I keep ordering these but I never enjoy them very much. Bacon wasn't crispy enough to contrast the soft mochi and mochi wasn't sweet enough to compliment the bacon's saltiness. Not bad but kind of just tasted neutral. (3/5)\n4) Beef tongue skewer: Very well seasoned and not too dry considering how thin the slices were. (4/5)\n\nRamen:\nI got the black garlic tonkotsu w/ chashu and my friend got the spicy black garlic tonkotsu w/ chashu. Despite the fact we almost had the same dish her's was far saltier than mine. The broth wasn't very rich and the black garlic oil didn't really add much. The chashu flavor good, slightly sweet and tender but some bits were a bit too dry for me. The noodles were on the thicker side which would work well if the broth was richer. Overall not bad but since this was the main course I was a bit disappointed. (3/5)\n\nOverall Coco's isn't an awful ramen place but there's better out there.", "author": "Vivian C."}

But we were surprised to see that Coco's had customers coming in and out on a Tuesday! Seeing the fuller restaurant, we decided to give Coco's a try since the reviews seemed pretty favorable regarding the ramen. The ramen shop is not too small - there are a good number of tables, but they only had half of their restaurant open for lunch service. The other half (seemingly a sushi bar) was closed otherwise there would have been many more tables. \n\nTheir menu is quite simple. They have a section for appetizers, yakitori, fried appetizers, and vegetables, but what they are popular for is their ramen. The prices are a bit more expensive than what you would pay for ramen in SGV, but it is SF - they offer the regular seafood, tonkotsu, miso, shoyu, vegetable, curry, and shio. Some broths are marked light, creamy, classic, flavorful, etc. which was interesting to see. What I found to be interesting was that instead of the usual chashu, they also give the option of adding braised pork belly to the ramen. \n\nMy family all tried the various ramen - tonkotsu and shoyu, but I decided to go with the curry. It's definitely more interesting, and I read a ton of good things about it. A ton of people also recommend adding the black garlic (additional $1), but I think all the bowls tasted fine without the black garlic. I was able to try all three bowls - they tasted pretty good; tonkotsu was more flavorful while the shoyu was a bit on the lighter side. \n\nI ended up being super glad that I went with the curry ramen. For $11.50, it was a pretty good deal! There was a good amount of ingredients inside, including half of a soft boiled egg. There was also bamboo shoots and green onion, but what stood out was the curry broth. I've tried curry ramen that didn't taste too great, but Coco's really perfected the broth! Not too heavy, more like a thick soup that went well with the ramen noodles. There was also carrots and potatoes in the broth, but the stand out ingredient was definitely the braised pork belly. If you love pork belly, you have got to order this instead of the chashu. It was sweet, tender, and melt in my mouth delicious. And they gave me a really decent portion, so I felt like I had a good ratio of pork belly to noodles! Noodles were cooked well - nothing too memorable about the ramen. I would come back to get this again. \n\ntl;dr - If you're craving ramen in the SF area, I would definitely recommend Coco's! Especially the pork belly with curry ramen! I overheard a customer next to me opting to forgo the chashu and pork belly and all I could think was ... give it to me! Glad I was able to find this place - worth the price.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

I'm a ramen snob. I lived in Japan for a number of years and ramen was my go-to, so i've eaten my weights worth of it. I base most of all my ramen experiences on soup and the soft boiled egg. You've been warned! \n\nCame here on a weekend to grab a quick dinner. They open at 5:30 so we got here right when it opened, so it wasn't that busy. I really wanted to try this place based on the reviews, but found this place to only be so-so.\n\nWe ordered some calamari and the tonkotsu ramen. The calamari was good. It was fried well and the squid wasn't chewy when you ate it. I liked the spicy mayo it came with as well. My tonkotsu ramen was underwhelming. The broth was salty and not flavorful or rich. I was expecting a creamy, pork bone taste and all I got was salt. The egg was cooked perfectly and marinated so well. The noodles were also cooked very well. Just the right. Chewy and not soggy or undercooked. I opted for the chashu and it was a little dry and un-flavorful. I will try the pork belly next time.", "author": "Junella T."}

My boyfriend has been here once before and had a great experience, so he wanted me to try it. There were 3 parties ahead of us. We waited about 10-15 minutes, not bad at all. \n\nI ordered the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly (non-spicy) and added corn. The presentation wasn't great to start with. I couldn't really tell what toppings were in my bowl from first glance. The broth was pretty bland and tasted watered down. I wasn't a fan of the pork belly either because of its sweetness, but I know that's just my personal preference. I was expecting something more savory. Toppings were good though. Egg, although overlooked, was good and my sweet corn was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the miso ramen with pork belly, medium spicy, and added bamboo shoots and extra egg. His broth tasted different than the first time he came here, even though he ordered the same thing. It was watered down and lacked flavor. The pork belly came really fatty and not crispy like the first time he says.\n\nThe service was alright. We were next on the list to be seated and a large table opened up (big enough to very tightly seat 6). The waiter asked the party who was after us if they wanted to share a table with us.. I think he should've asked us first considering we were next. So we were seated next to another pair and it just wasn't enough space for 2 pairs of strangers to comfortably enjoy dinner. \n\nOverall, I don't think I will be back. It was worth a try though. I know this place has pretty good reviews, so maybe we came on an off day. My boyfriend did mention that the last time he was here, it was during the first hour of their dinner service. This time, we were here closer towards the end. We think that has something to do with the lower quality food.", "author": "Ariana T."}

We decided to try Coco's based on Yelp rating and location. We were prepared to have a wait based on other reviews but were able to be sat at the bar right away. Apparently they also own the next door restaurant which serves Sushi AND Ramen so if you're going with a pickier group, that may be a good option.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n-Shio Ramen, Spicy with Pork Shoulder and Black Garlic ($11.50 + $1 for Black Garlic): This was mine and it was good. Tasty but a bit salty and not nearly enough veggies. The Pork Shoulder was a nice light addition instead of the Pork Belly you could opt for.\n\n-Shoyu Ramen with Pork Belly ($11.50): This was A's and it was good too. Very light but the Pork belly was an interesting contrast. Less salty than mine but still skimpy on the veggies. A was hungry at the end of the meal.\n\nOverall, Coco's was average. The service was quick (if not a bit brusque) and the price was right. I think if we come back we would probably try some of their appetizers since they looked really good and seemed to be popular.

And I thought I was lucky to find nearby parking...\n\nAlmost 2 years later, I decided it was about time to give this place another shot. After all, it's a pretty convenient location to get to, especially considering that all the ramen places in between San Mateo and San Francisco suck major ****. Being right off the San Jose Ave exit, I was determined to make Coco's Ramen my stop for great quality ramen without having to go too much out of my way.\n\nThe decision: OMG, WHAT CAR ACCIDENT?!?! \n\nJk, it wasn't that over the top amazing to make me forget what happened, but I definitely had one excellent bowl of ramen.\n\nAs I usually get at ramen shops, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, medium spicy. But at Coco's you get the additional option of adding BLACK GARLIC-- um, yes! The black garlic delivers a deep umami flavor that enhances the richness of the slowly simmered tonkotsu broth. Seriously freaking good. My only critique is, as other Yelpers have pointed out, that their levels of spicy are a bit watered down. For sure I'm going to order my bowl extra spicy next time.\n\nOther menu items:\n-COCO'S GYOZA (6pc not the 4pc menu option because that's different): I know they're just potstickers, but these were some of the best potstickers I've ever had. First off, I never order potstickers but I was starving and wanted something that wouldn't fill me up before the ramen came. To my pleasant surprise, the gyoza were handmade and the filling was really delicious. Moreover, it's served w/ chinkiang vinegar, aka the vinegar usually served with XLB. It's like they knew I have a weird affinity for vinegars...\n-GRILLED WHOLE SQUID w/ spicy mayo sauce: Perfectly grilled but served plain w/ spicy mayo on the side. I also don't really think the spicy mayo was the right pairing for the squid, but sprinkle some shichimi on that baby and it's good to go (straight to your mouth).\n\nI will definitely be back here more often for my ramen fix.

It's a Japanese curry flavor ramen that feels more like a stew. It isn't thick but comes with stewed root veg - carrots and potatoes - so reminds me of a nice watery stew with chewy yummy ramen noodles. They recommended the pork belly over the chasu because of the stew like tendency and I have to agree that was the way to go. I got the medium spicy but most of the spice was in the broth so the noodles themselves weren't spicy. I only really felt it when I slurped the broth at the end.\n\nI liked the change of pace in ramen flavors a lot. Admittedly I love Japanese curry so it wasn't a stretch for me.", "author": "Jean K."}

It's not completely authentic, but it gets the job done if you're craving ramen. \n\nI wasn't too crazy about the layout of the restaurant.

I'm pretty sure it was not really Tonkotsu - meaning that I'm sure they did not spend hours boiling pork bones to make the broth.  It completely lacked any of the silky creaminess, smokiness or fat that is so indicative of real Tonkotsu.  Instead the broth was thin and watery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-18", "description": "REVIEW #500. Thanks to my meticulous Yelping along with an obsessive compulsive gravitation towards ramen, I stumbled across Coco's: a horrifyingly unauthentic name for a Japanese restaurant, and an intriguingly nondescript storefront in which the only sign is a paper on the door with ramen written in wispy brushstrokes. \n\nThe kabocha is likely the best appetizer in existence, ever. It's a soft-boiled egg enveloped in mashed pumpkin, and fried for a thin crispy coating.... in this era with such crayziness over runny eggs and pumpkin spice lattes, need I say more. It's a bit pricey at ~$10, but it is a glowing bomb of deliciousness (FYI it literally glows if you sit at the bar stools by the windows around sunset).\n\nThe ramen is also quite good, and the way they arrange the toppings is exceptionally photogenic (t's disappointing when delicious ramen decides to humbly present itself on Instagram as a bowl of soup with a lonely mound of noodles). We tried the miso and shoyu, both of which turned out to be excellent broths: I suggest getting it spicy and with black garlic for an extra kick, because they don't charge extra for spicy and black garlic isn't available at all ramen places.\n\nIn short, I'd say their ramen is goldilocks style, i.e. just right. The broth has just the right amount of creamy richness, the various toppings in just the right ratio to complement the noodles, and overall striking just the right balance of flavors and textures. I was initially disappointed at the half an egg and single slice of the (heavenly melt-in-your-mouth) chashu, but it turned out to be just the right portion to leave you satisfied but not feeling fat and hypernatremic and volume overloaded (cue RAAS).\n\nTo complete the dining experience, the ambiance is cool: an authentic, Tumblr-worthy Japanese decor with a classy dark theme and wooden tables that make an excellent backdrop for food porn. The silly cow-shaped pepper shaker adds an amusing and unforgettable finishing touch. Service is polite and efficient, and they didn't rush us even though we stayed for over half an hour after we finished eating (I was stuck in a conference call... dinner took way longer than I had expected because we were absolutely enthralled by the kabocha and cut it up in artsy presentation) (don't ask).\n\nThe only downside of Coco's?

It was accurately described by another yelper as FUSION. For example, they serve their fried oysters with a sweet viscous chili sauce that is a Vietnamese staple, a sauce Japanese would never go near. \n\nThey used a generic \"curry powder,\" like a generic Mcormick style one found at Safeway or Walmart, to do their \"curry ramen\" (which I regretfully ordered.....BIG mistake..I should have known better, I know.....Not authentic in the first place just to have this on their menu).\n\nMy wife got the seafood ramen, also very un-ramen like, which was also a huge mistake.

Both can get pretty elusive if you ask me. One brings out collective groans from tripe-haters, while the other attracts the palate of every Asian in this city between the ages of 22 and 35. You would think I was looking for the former since I was on the 14-Mission past Cesar Chavez, but no, I was looking for this new spot off 29th Street right next to Crazy Sushi, another place that never caught my eye or wallet. Sure enough, it's the same owner who has decided to jump on the ramen bandwagon. So naturally I had to try it on a cold wintry night when I needed a bowl of noodles to comfort my soul.\n\nTheir signage consisted of a piece of paper taped to the front door (photo: http://bit.ly/1strz6g). Even though it was half-empty, I was relegated as a solitary diner to the little two-seat counter facing the front window, not the most comfortable spot in the place but at least I had it to myself. It should come as no surprise that I selected the $11.50 Tonkotsu Ramen, my personal favorite, even though seven varieties are offered. But first, some appetizers were necessary. OK, 'necessary' is an overstatement. I was just hungry from the long bus ride. I ordered the $8 Fried Oysters, which I thought were a bit overpriced for four semi-plump pieces as good as they were.\n\nThey came with some sweet-and-sour sauce which I didn't like much (photo: http://bit.ly/1C1EU5l) since I would have preferred a spicy aioli. Regardless, the bigger disappointment was the $5 Beef Tongue Yakitori, two skewers each with thinly sliced, barely there tongue nicely grilled but just so paltry in portion as to force me to surmise that I was given a child's portion (photo: http://bit.ly/1xjFtDr). They were gone in ninety seconds, I swear. At last, the Tonkotsu Ramen arrived. Now what was interesting is that they offer what kind of broth finish you want, so I ordered the black garlic based on a variation I tried at the Ramen Shop over in Oakland. But more strangely, I don't believe pork chashu was a complimentary topping.\n\nIt didn't matter so much in my case because I automatically ordered the double braised pork belly for an extra $3.50, but I would have been bummed if my carnivery was meant to be satisfied merely by the pork broth. The other ingredients, however, were all present and accounted for: the soft-boiled egg half, bamboo shoots, shredded vegetables, and nori (photo: http://bit.ly/1BgRNdV). The broth certainly had a palpable kick to it, and I just asked for medium. There's no telling what happens when the spiciness moves up a few notches. The texture of the noodles were reasonably al dente, so all was still right with the world. Although service was fairly attentive bordering on unctuous, I'd still place this bowl somewhere in the middle of the pack. Guess I could still look for menudo around these parts, I guess.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...reasonably good ramen has quite a kick but little else of distinction, especially a red mark for the paltry portions on the appetizers\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...pretty standard space as ramen houses go...some more real seating for solitary diners would be nice\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty enthusiastic\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a mixed bag at best as this entry into the city's ramen sweepstakes, still needs tinkering", "author": "Ed U."}

Per Coco's website, they take reservations for parties with 6 to 8 people. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50), medium spicy, and added pork belly (+$3.50) and black garlic (+$1). My favorite parts of the bowl were the al dente noodles, the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, and the tender and flavorful pork belly. The broth was unlike one I've had before and wasn't your typical creamy, porky tonkotsu broth. It was still savory and tasty nonetheless. The bamboo shoots were a let down. They tasted like they came straight out of the can and weren't treated so the shoots had that intense musty bamboo flavor.  \n\nWe also ordered the grilled whole squid app ($12) which arrived to our table after our bowls of ramen. The ramen came out pretty fast but I would have preferred the meal to start with the appetizer and the noodle soup bowls to follow at a reasonable pace. The squid was served with a ponzu sauce and a spicy mayo sauce. For me, the flavor of the spicy mayo sauce was like nacho cheese. Not a bad thing but just different. While the squid wasn't overcooked, it could have been grilled longer for a more intense flavor and to add some charred texture to the squid. \n\nFood price tags were a bit hefty but service was very friendly.

I noticed mine had literally only like two bean sprouts with some seaweed while his had a handful.  My broth was so bland, like it tasted like a water broth with just some orange food coloring.  His miso had a tad bit of flavor but was watery as well.  The egg was pretty much the only good thing in the bowl.  Some of the noodles were clumped together and seemed almost package like.  Also one pork slice was a lot more tender than the other one in my bowl.  A good noodle soup is based on the noodles and the broth, none of which were done well at all.  The sad thing is I feel like they probably use MSG (from the way my tongue felt afterwards) yet the broth had no taste.  The portions were on the smaller side too, and I wouldn't mind if they were smaller and that high priced if the quality was actually there.  $11.50 for each bowl, so disappointing!

Only one waiter and understandably you will be busy, but one can still treat customers nicer.  When looking at the menu, we noticed the page listing the ramen and next to it said \"spiciness\".  The waiter comes to jot down our order and I ask him what \"spiciness\" meant.  \"10\", he says.  uh... \"so what is your question?\"  he seemingly asked with a sarcastic tone.  Someone else then reiterates  the question and he explains that \"spiciness\" meant the level of spiciness of your broth (spiciness level 1-10, 1 = zero spicy). We all could've saved time had he clarified it the first time.  Anyways, my party and I put in our ramen order,  adding a couple of sides.\n\nwhen the orders arrive, there was a mistake in one order (gave us chashu instead of pork belly) and the waiter was kind to comp us the pork belly, which by the way is delicious:  very tender meat with the fat layer melting in your mouth. as I said, ramen is good, though soup is a little oily.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "description": "Coco's Ramen is a sister restaurant of Crazy Sushi which is right next door, and there is actually an opening in the wall inside that you can go back and forth the two restaurants inside. I have never tried Crazy Sushi; and just by looking at these two names I knew their food must not be related to the words \"authentic Japanese\" at all - well I was right about this part, but surprisingly Coco's Ramen is unauthentically good!\n\nCoco's is located in the intersection of Bernal Height / Mission / Noe Valley neighborhood. Kind of a hipster area. Went on Sunday evening, wasn't expecting any wait since it's pretty new but I ended up waiting for almost 45 mins. Couple reasons:\n\n1. Restaurnt is quite tiny, less than 35 seats.\n2. I guess the servers are still super new and they were pretty bad at tasks management - there was clearly a line outside and we saw at least 8 people finished their meals and left the restaurant, but the tables were left unclear and they couldn't sit people in.\n\nTask management aside - the service was pretty nice. Both servers were very polite and very willing to explain their menu, which is absolutely essential to a restaurant so new.\n\n[Tonkotsu Ramen] - A-.\nSo, without adding any toppings, it comes with chashu, cabbage, half a soft-boiled egg, some wooden mushroom, and of course ramen. I added black garlic, extra pork belly, extra cabbage, with mild spicy level.\n\nFirst, the broth. Is it authentic? No. Special? No. But clearly the chef knows what he/she's doing. The thing I liked about it was that it's considered pretty rich in texture, but it was not very salty at all. I guess they did't really put MSG in it which is certainly a plus. I can't eat too spicy so mild spicy was just about right for me. Black garlic did enhance the taste of the broth.\n\nRamen wasn't the best I have tried but it was not bad. If anything, I would be expecting thicker noodle and a bit harder texture i.e. less cooking time. For the egg, I wouldn't call that soft-boiled at all - it was 90% cooked. Maybe it was cut in half and heat could get into the egg easily?\n\nBut man, the best part was the meat. Pork Belly was bomb! I think I haven't had such good pork belly for a long while - super tender, fat portion was about 1/3 of the whole piece which to me was just about right; and the taste was super, super phenomenal. I should really have ordered quadruple pork belly. Chashu on the other hand was way above average too. It was very moist and thinly cut. Too bad I had it with pork belly and the chashu couldn't be compared at the same level.\n\nThe addition of cabbage was a nice touch to the ramen as a whole. I think it definitely served the purpose of neutralizing the broth, whether it's good or bad depends on people, but cabbage + rich tonkotsu broth was another thing I found quite unique about.\n\nThe ramen itself, without adding anything, costs $11.50. But I ended up paying $18+tax with adding all those ingredients. Definitely on the expensive side. One may wonder whether its worth paying such a price for an unauthentic Japanese ramen shop? It's a hard question, because I can really get an Orenchi with a beer with this price. But the pork belly really set this place apart. I will definitely come back to try their Miso Ramen next time!", "author": "Simon C."}

I have pudgy pudges all year round and multiple layers of clothing makes me look like the the Michelin Man. *le sigh*\n\nIt's ramen weather now so I've been on a hunt for a good bowl of ramen without msg. Admittedly, I was very skeptical about Coco's Ramen. It's from the same owners as Crazy Sushi and it's not Japanese owned or operated. I thought it would be another run-of-the-mill, Chinese owned ramen joint. \n\nWell, I was wrong....\n\nOpening on November 12th, Coco's Ramen serves 7 ramen varieties among typical Japanese apps (agedashi tofu, karaage, and gyoza), and yakitori. Ramen menu: http://bit.ly/1r14bH2. Sake, shochu, and beer is available (I had the sugar-free iichiko on the rocks and it gave me a good buzz). They use no msg in any of their food. Woot woot!\n\nWe started with House Fried Chicken Wings ($7) and the Gyutan: Beef Tongue Yakitori ($5). The chicken wings weren't exactly what I expected them to be but they were darn good: http://bit.ly/1zGu1FC. The drummettes were marinated, partially deboned, battered and fried. They were crunchy, flavorful, and moist. I found it odd that they served it with Thai sweet chili dipping sauce though. I would skip the yakitori. The gyutan was dinky, very thinly sliced, and overseasoned with shio (salt) and black pepper: http://bit.ly/1F7dQEe. Yakitori typically isn't seasoned with black pepper. We were given Teba: Chicken Wings by accident. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50) which comes with nori, half a soft-boiled egg, your choice of chashu (pork shoulder) or pork belly, and your specified level of spiciness: http://bit.ly/1AnvRhT. I asked for both protein options (+$3) and no spicy (I like to doctor up the broth myself with togarashi chili pepper). I also added black garlic (+$1) and corn (no add'l charge). \n\nI was pleasantly surprised with how good the ramen was for Bernal Heights. I think they accidentally added spice because my tonkotsu broth had a red hue but that was fine. The broth was rich and subtly creamy. It's not as creamy as other tonkotsu broths because they use a combo of pork and chicken stock. Seasoning wise, it was flavorful to me but people who favor msg-laden broths may find it a little bland. The thick, curly noodles seemed very commercialized but they were perfectly cooked; al-dente with a nice, toothsome chew. Definitely opt for the tender chashu over the pork belly which was dry. The highlight? The soft-boiled egg. I hate when ramen joint overcook their eggs. Here, the yolk was still custardy with a slightly molten core: http://bit.ly/1xGwsKp. Pure deliciousness. \n\nService was very pleasant and the staff was really nice. They checked up on us several times. However, they seem to having issues in the kitchen because it took 30 minutes for our bowl of ramen in an empty restaurant (one other couple there). Hopefully, they streamline their processes once they iron out their kinks. One of my gripes was they charged us for the Teba: Chicken Wings. A customer should never have to pay for something that was given to them in error. \n\nThe ambiance is quite quirky. It's like being in my Chinese great-grandmother's living room with antique Chinese furnishings (chairs were uncomfortable) and pictures of cute South East Asian children. It's a shared space with Crazy Sushi so there's only 5 four-tops, and 8 counter seats. \n\nParking in the area is pretty difficult after 6 pm (next to Pizza Hacker, half a block away from Ichi and Front Porch). \n\nFeedback to the Owner:\nI overheard the couple next to us asking a lot of questions about the menu which can be much improved. People may not be familiar with items on the menu like geso karaage (fried squid) or tonkatsu kushiage (deep fried pork skewers) so having short descriptions/translations of what these items are will be more efficient for your staff and your customers. Also, the ramen menu is not very clear: 1) There needs to be a clear distinction that you get a choice of chashu OR pork belly;  2) If you will be charging for black garlic, that needs to be specified on the menu (looks complimentary); 3) List all toppings (corn was available but not listed on the menu). \n\nLastly, making a flavorful ramen broth without msg is not an easy task. It's a great selling point for the area so you should consider adding that you don't use msg into the existing paragraph explaining how your ramen is made.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Cold, dreary and lacking sleep from an eventful birthday weekend packed with singing, dancing, drinking and sing-a-longs. After a hectic day at the office (and a vow to go on a diet), convenience overshadowed logic and resorted to yelp to find a quick bite instead of cooking. It was cold and we were dehydrated so ramen was the quick and reasonable solution. We wanted to find something in our hood, which is where Coco's was a beaming light in an otherwise dark Monday.\n\nWhile sitting in traffic, I scanned the reviews and vetted our remedies; My stomach growled in excitement and anticipation.\n\nUpon coming in, you notice it's a small joint where the restaurant is literally split in half by a curtain..... where clearly patrons favor the ramen over the sushi. The ramen side had a small wait while the sushi side was a ghost town. Maybe everyone shared our Monday blues?\n\nDue to popular demand, we started with the Kobocha as it peaked our interest and definitely delivered. The outside was perfectly fried and topped with spicy mayo. The anticipation set in as we cut in half, where the pumpkin mash and a beautiful slow cooked eggs greeted us with open arms. The combination of flavors, textures and sauces were a fantastic beginning of what was to come. At $10, it may be a bit steep for some but definitely justified as the only way to eat it would be to share. \n\nI had the curry ramen, medium spicy with garlic and pork belly and it was a game changer. It kind of reminded me of a Japanese version of bun bo hue; flavorful, spicy and full of full-bodied spices. One of my favorite meals is Japanese curry chicken over rice, which was this in soup form. The pork belly was beautifully tender and melted in my mouth, had yet another slow cooked egg and the noodles were cooked to perfection.\n\nShe had the miso ramen, not spicy with garlic and, again, one of the better miso broths I've had in SF. The pork belly was cooked wonderfully and they didn't skimp out on the quantity like some other ramen spots.\n\nWhile this may fall on deaf ears, coco's is the real deal. I have eaten ramen all over the world and, more specifically, all over japan and coco's is a front runner on the world stage. I foresee daydreaming of curry ramen with pork belly (ie: now) while all other ramen options get pushed to the back burner. Other ramen places charge an additional $4 for pork belly options, while cocos includes it making this an affordable tasty option as well. \n\nNote: while I didn't drink, they do have an array of premium sake options and Kirin on draft (most have bottled, there is a difference!). it does get crowded as tables are limited, so come early and come ready to wait. Totally worth it.", "author": "Ryan L."}

The pumpkin mash was smooth and flavorful with a perfectly deep fried crunchy outer layer, and the slow cooked tea egg inside was just heaven on earth. A little steep at $12 a pop but totally worth it!!!!\n\nSeaweed salad: standard. I like that it was seasoned properly.\n\nEggplant appetizer: I wish the eggplant was marinaded in the sauces more.

I liked that the noodles are el dente. I preferred the pork belly over the chasu, but for those who don't like fatty meats, stick to the chasu.\n\nWAS THERE A WAIT?\nThey don't' take reservations here so to avoid waiting, come when it opens at 5:30pm.

The broth is deep and unctuous, there's many thin slices stewing in the bowl, the boiled eggs gave off the idea that everything was br\u00fbl\u00e9e'd. The nori, was a bit of excess for the salt factor seeing as the ramen was already heavy and dense. The pieces of pickled ginger, helped alleviated with the umami factor however I wish there was a hint of citrus to cut through it all.\n\nThe Curry Ramen, was the more balanced of the two ramen. All of the flavors packed in reminded me of Curry Rice (if you haven't had it, you need to try it sometime). The deep under tones of Beef Gravy, Pepper, and Chili Powder came into effect. The scallions didn't really do much but add a tiny hill of green on the lake of curry. The only improvement I would make on this dish is to add beef slices instead of pork (the pork was tasty but didn't really do it for me).\n\nGetting here is a bit of a pain and street parking is very scarce, so be on the look out for Paid Parking lots to help alleviate your stress.\n\nMy overall score is a four, the cost, the flavors, and the ambiance were nice.

Don't scream at me, but I don't like the fat so I just cut the meat around it and it was super tasty.\n\nThe spice levels are either 1-10 or no spice, mild, medium, spicy, very spicy I think.  Depends on who your server is.  If you get NO spice, it comes pretty bland, but if you get MILD spice, it comes almost medium spice - I think it's some spice with chili oil or something so it sort of goes from 0 to spice just by adding it.  If you want the clean straight taste of tonkotsu get NO spice.\n\nReservations for large parties only (6 I think?).  Gets crowded for dinner.  Super empty for lunch. Not the most space to wait inside so you might have to wait on the sidewalk or squeeze. \n\nStreet parking is fairly easy over on Valencia with a short walk around the corner.\n\nShares space with a sushi place that was empty; bathroom is over on the sushi place.  They might be willing to seat you there if they can at least.\n\nSuper casual\n\nTakes major credit cards.\n\nCLOSED TUESDAY.", "author": "Traci H."}

Everything about the ramen struck me as Chinese rather than Japanese, not that that's enough to ding the place. The main thing was that the broth tastes exactly like INSTANT ramen (Shin Ramyun to be exact). It's hard to tell what went into making the broth when even medium spice overwhelms all other flavors (I suspect a heavy hand with the MSG). \n\nThe pork belly was actually decently cooked, nice flavors, but the egg that comes with the ramen is pretty awful. Not only do you get just half an egg, but mine came at the bottom of the bowl with most of the yolk floating away. No taste really beyond being the Chinese tea egg style. The presentation also was somewhat lacking, with random red threads floating atop.\n\nMenu is also somewhat confusing, and I wouldn't have realized that an egg comes with each bowl if other Yelpers hadn't mentioned it. It's also left unclear whether garlic is something they charge for, or whether it's just black garlic. \n\nIf you've had ramen anywhere else, you won't be impressed either.", "author": "Kevin L."}

The restaurant is pretty small so we had to wait for a table. When we finally sat down, they gave us 2 wine bottles of water (thought it was free alcohol.... Noooope haha) and menus. \n\nI ended up ordering the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly, mild spicy, with garlic ($11.50). I love that they give you the option to choose between pork belly and chasu here!! And also the option to add black garlic, but I wasn't feelin a $1 increase after seeing the prices here. An order of ramen comes with a soft boiled egg, a piece of seaweed, bamboo shoots, green onions, and your choice of meat. The bowls came out a couple minutes later and they looked so good!! We all dug in and were so impressed--you can definitely taste the pork/chicken combination broth here and it is delicious! Not too salty, no MSG, and light enough to the point where it doesn't get too rich. You can also really taste the garlic here!! Makes me wonder about the black garlic.. Mmmmm! Be careful with the mild spicy though, usually I'm okay with mild but this was definitely higher on the spice level for me. Kind of like a medium, so I'll probably get no spice next time. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The soft boiled egg was one of the better ones I've had at ramen places. I hate ordering a soft boiled egg and when I get it, it's room temp/cold, but here it was warm and the egg yolk was runny. The star of the bowl was definitely the pork belly though!! I've never seen a ramen place offer pork belly instead of chasu so I thought it was pretty generous/cool of them haha. They gave 3 thick pieces and it was more than enough for me. It was soft, tender, and definitely melted in my mouth!! I usually hate fat on meat but I don't mind it on pork belly... Makes it so good!\n\nService was okay. We literally only saw our waiter like 3 times, and it's a small place!! Probably because they gave us the water already. \n\nOnly gripe about this place is that it's a bit pricey... Paying close to $12 for a bowl of ramen? And corn is $2 more!!!! :( Also I didn't finish my noodles, but I can see how it's a smaller portion than other places. Still, I am giving Coco's ramen 5 stars because of that pork belly and the broth!!!", "author": "Tara A."}

Owner's are Chinese and the Ramen shop is adjoining their Sushi restaurant. Usually not good signs, but WOW!! This place was the exception to the rule.\n\nOrdered medium spicy Tonkatsu ramen with chashu and corn, the noodles were firm and chewy, held up well to the rich and full flavored broth. Perfect! I don't like that they charge extra for black garlic oil and veggies like corn, but the base price was SF reasonable enough, $11.50 plus $2.00 for corn. The hostess and our server were possibly like mother and son, with dad making occasional appearances, all very friendly and helpful. They obviously take pride in their clean and homey little enterprise.\n\nThe eggs were a highlight, perfectly soft and flavored, chicken drumettes were awesome with lemon squeezed over. Chashu had a little Chinese flavor, gingery, which I prefer. Meat wasn't notable, but everything else was.\n\n\nWay better than anywhere in Japantown, my other Bay Area favorites are Santa in San Mateo and Ajisen in Fremont is my current top due to the delish short rib ramen.

Okay, I guess that's pretty average in SF these days.  They give you a very fair portion of food, but the ingredients never seem that fresh to me.  The brussels sprouts and cabbage have zero flavor, like they've been sitting in a freezer for a week.\n\nThe broth however, is terrific, so it kind of masks the other ingredients.  It packs a spicy punch if you want it to, and is great to just drink on it its own.\n\nThe place is usually packed, parking is almost impossible in the area, and they do not deliver (womp womp :().

Usually don't go out for ramen since it is so easy to make at home and we are exceptional cooks. Should have stayed home. Went there on a Saturday night early. Lots of diners. Good sign. Service very strange as if the young woman has never done this before. Not a big deal. Ramen was good but very simple and did not quite taste like Japanese ramen. When ordering, waitress asked us how spicy we want the ramen. Strange question for a ramen place but understandable when the waitress told us owners are Chinese. No prejudice here since our group was mostly Chinese and Korean Americans. Ordered beef tongue and squid \"yakitori\" as appetizers. Both came well after our ramen was served. The grilled tongue was cold, tasteless, and was so tough it was almost inedible! I think they sliced the tongue raw than grilled it with no seasoning. Tongue needs to be cooked for a long time before you grill it. I don't think they knew that. The squid was huge, tasteless, and very chewy, and they served it with a Thousand Island like sauce. Not to say Chinese chefs  can't make Japanese food (most Japanese restaurants in SF are owned by Koreans and on the whole they are very good) but on this night, the food was simply not acceptable, especially in a foodie town like SF.", "author": "Hanuman C."}

Although I little bit of a drive from my apartment, the reviews were enough to get me out to Bernal Heights.  Coco's is a tiny place with maybe 8 tables total.  Luckily I didn't have to wait long for a seat.  \n\nExamining the menu, there are several broth options to choose from: seafood, tonkotsu, miso, shoyu, shio, veggie and curry. Coco's is one of the few places I've seen that offers a braised pork belly option, in addition to the standard char siu pork.  I personally think that the measure of a great ramen shop is the quality of their tonkotsu broth.  I ordered it spicy (short of very spicy), double egg and double pork belly.  Oh yeah, I went large on this one. \n\nMy steaming hot bowl of noodles and broth arrived within 10 minutes.  My first sip of broth revealed a nice richness, without being heavy, and a significant kick of spice.  Makes me wonder how potent the \"very spicy\" option would have been.  Overall, a very nice first impression.  The braised pork belly was nice and tender, but had an odd sweetness I didn't expect.  At first, it was a bit unusual.  But as the spiciness continued to build, the sweet pork offered a nice counterpoint.  But the real star of the show here might have been the soft boiled egg, which was perfectly done yolky unctiousness.   \n\nService is friendly and fairly attentive.

The salad was fine, just greens with house dressing and sesame seeds.  The eggplant was not great, Italian globe eggplant instead of Japanese, so a bit watery, but a generous portion.  The kabocha was... Holy smokes what is that?!? It was a delicious soft boiled egg covered in kabocha squash with a crispy outside crust.  Kind of like a Rebel Within, but warm and smokey and savory and sweet.  Huge and delicious.  Ramen noodles were nice and bouncy, broth pretty good.

I'm always happy and full after eating here. I always order the veggie ramen. I like that they let you pick the vegetables you want in it, the level of spiciness, and whether you'd like black garlic, regular, or none. As a garlic lover, that's golden! I highly recommend them for take out if you live/work in the area but must say they are a little slow for dine in during lunch or if you have any additional requests when you come to pick up your take out during that time. With a little more organization and attentiveness, they could be 5 stars.", "author": "Shav S."}

A few stars knocked off due to slow service and preventable wait time. \n\nCame on a Monday night around 7:30 with the SO. Wait time = easily 30-40 min. with only 3 small parties ahead of us. Why? Because this place is not only small, but the seating layout is SUPER INEFFECTIVE. Aside from a few spots at the bar, they have 5 large tables that seat parties of 4-6. Everyone waiting to be seated that night (and I imagine on most nights) were groups of 2-3. My SO and I were eventually seated at a table for 6 and ate our dinner while 3 other couples waiting to be seated had to watch us eat with 4 empty chairs next to us. Same deal at the next table over - another couple with 4 empty seats. With their small space, they should really replace their large tables with small single tables and just push them together as needed when larger groups come. Poor business decision imo. Wait time could have easily been cut down to 10-15min. \n\nService: On the slower side - 25 min for 2 bowls of ramen. Waiter was nice, but when asked what appetizer he recommended, he told us he \"honestly didn't know because all he's had on the menu were the chicken wings.\" Lolol...\n\nFood: \n+ Kobacha (4/5): yummy, rich, and filling! Recommend sharing among 2-3 people.\n- Miso Ramen (3/5): broth lacks flavor imo; skip this & get Tonkotsu ramen (4/5) instead. Noodles and pork belly were both solid. I like that you have the option of adding garlic and choosing your spice. Medium spice was more like mild - I'd up the spice lvl next time.", "author": "J C."}

We got there at 6 pm just in time to find VIP parking right in front!  Please note that parking is hard to come by in this neighborhood.  As we entered, we got the last big table for our family of 4!  Just as we sat down, people began to pile in and formed a queue.  There was a big party sitting behind us eating and drinking for a long while so don't expect people to come in, stuff their faces, and leave right away.  There were plenty of other parties that lingered as well.  The place is not very big so just be prepared to wait if you come during dinner time.\n\nFor appetizers, we got gyoza, grilled eggplant, and house chicken wings.  The gyozas were your typical delicious pan fried dumplings.  However, the grilled eggplant was super disappointing.  It was undercooked and we were also still able to see flour-covered fingerprints on the skin of the eggplant which we initially thought was mold.  We ate two bites and left the rest on the plate which is a shame because I usually love eggplant-anything.  \n\nWe asked for the house chicken wings to be made non-spicy for my older son and they did that for us without a problem.  Even though they didn't use their usual spices to make it their \"house\" special, the wings were still delicious.  They carve up the wings so that it's lollipop style.  The meat is still attached to the wing but the meat is easier to eat off the bone.  My kids happily gobbled them up.\n\nWe also ordered tonkatsu ramen and curry ramen.  There was just the right amount of chewy texture to the noodles and the broth was piping hot and full of deep flavors.  However, I was not a fan of the braised pork belly in the tonkatsu base.  There was way too much going on in one bowl.  I still ate it and it definitely melted in your mouth like any good pork belly should but I felt chashu would've tasted much better with the tonkatsu base.\n\nAt the recommendation of the server, we added black garlic to the curry ramen.  I see a lot of people raving about the black garlic, however, I think we could've done without any add-on's.  We both like our ramen pretty basic so we rarely order any add-on's unless they're highly recommended.\n\nAll in all, we think this place is a great find since there are hardly any decent ramen spots in this part of town.  We'll definitely be back again!", "author": "Ivy Z."}

We ordered drinks appetizers and ramen I ordered my ramen not spicy my partner ordered his mild  when I got mine it was mild spicy and my partners had no spice. We also order a beer and sake. They had to ask twice what type of sake we also ordered the raw oysters which we never received but were charged for.  When I asked they said oh so sorry it's very busy next door (crazy sushi) were they get the oysters but the funny thing was there was only a table of two people in crazy sushi so they obviously forgot the order.  \nIts really sad that such a good ramen house service has to drop as they get closer to closing time.

All five tables were taken up yet six chairs remained empty. And some tables that were up against the benches wasted seating space. They could have easily accommodated six more people in one hour.\n\nTO THE BUSINESS OWNER:\n\nGet smaller, two-person tables so you don't waste 2 chairs when it's only two people dining at a 4-person table. Rearrange these smaller tables into larger tables as needed. Rethink how to put these smaller tables against your bench seating to maximize use of the space. The large, heavy wooden tables you have now may look nice but you're losing business. You can get smaller, modern looking tables and still keep the ambiance since your decor is pretty modern anyway.

I was able to eat some of the noodles, but the broth was so spicy that I could not eat it. \nI've lived in Japan, and ramen isn't spicy there unless it's specifically requested. Perhaps Coco's thinks all Americans love spicy foods, or they think it's a good way to disguise a relatively flavorless tonkotsu-style broth. When I mentioned that I couldn't eat it, they gave me some lame advice about asking for the spicy paste (which isn't mentioned on the menu at all) on the side next time. I don't think there will be a next time.\n\nThe chicken gyoza were pan-fried nicely, but inside they were mushy and not very good.\n\n$20 gone and I'm still hungry.

Upon arrival, we were immediately given a table. It was already 1:30 pm and my appetite was voracious. There were only about 10 spots available and at that time only one server. We were lucky to get in when we did as the place soon filled up. I ordered the shio signature ramen (for a refreshing broth) with chasu and boy did it satisfy. Not only was the presentation of the ramen nice, flavors were perfectly balanced, representing the epitome of umami awesomeness!

No complaints there. I'm giving this place 2/5 stars because the tonkotsu ramen is one of the worst that I have -ever- had.  If you're looking for other food or a non tonkotsu ramen perhaps the rating would be higher. My friend and I adventure around the Bay Area trying all the tonkotsu ramens from Ramen Dojo, Himawari, Ramen Parlor, Orenchi, ramen underground, Ken Ken among many many others. \n\nThis tonkotsu was overpriced and very strange. It was almost a chinese take on ramen? My friend hit the nail on the head when we were trying to figure out what was weird about the pork belly-the pork belly had a christmas-y spice to it that was very unappealing. The noodles were okay, nothing to rave about but the broth was very unsatisfying an the broth is why my fat self loves tonkotsu. I'm a fan of spicy but unfortunately when you ask for spicy here they add a spice which mutates the \"should be delicate\" tonkotsu broth. It loses the creamy pork allure.\n\nAgain, nice people and clean but I don't recommend going for tonkotsu.\n\nPs.

Very flavorful broth and pork-belly, loved the egg. The husband got the seafood ramen which was also yummy. Nice ambience once you got inside. \n\nCons: Wait time was 25 minutes and service was pretty bad - really slow going to bring us water and forgetful about things we asked for like napkins or an extra plate (we gave up after a while). They also aren't straightforward about the wait time when you put your name down. \n\nSuggestions to Cocos: you could significantly reduce customer wait times if you put in two tops instead of 4 tops (especially since you seat 2 people at a 4 person table).

The bowls are excellent, particularly if you like your ramen hot spicy as I do, with a wide range of classic ramen broths and fresh ingredients. That said, while they indicate a range of hot spicing preference options, and the waiter actively engaged in conversation regarding the topic, we were surprised when my partner's bowl was delivered medium spicy though she had very clearly stated \"no spice\". When they suggested a completely different type of ramen, salty shio, and then brought that, they again offered hot pepper spice. The point here seems to be one of communications. So, if you need your dish without absolutely no hot spice, be really, really clear on that, ask for recommendation of a bland or salty broth, and reiterate your preference. They seem to be attentive to pleasing the customer, even if it takes some perseverance on both sides, and the extra communication effort is worthwhile.", "author": "Scott C."}

If your favorite ramen places are Orenchi and Dojo, I'd skip Coco's because you'll leave craving ramen from one of those two places and will feel the ridiculous wait times at those establishments would of been worth your time.", "author": "Nettie K."}

The two seem to share a space so if you don't want to wait in line for ramen, just get seated in the sushi bar and order yourself an uni nigiri appetizer.

So we just stood around, waiting for a table to open up and for someone to come by to take us to a table.\n\nWe were given our menus and I ordered the curry ramen with medium spiciness and my friend ordered the shio ramen. The over all meal was okay and passable, there was nothing particularly worthy to note but nothing wrong either. However, that being said, how no one bothered to address us when we walked in the door is in very poor service, no \"hello\", no wait time approximation, just absolutely nothing made it feel like that they didn't want to serve us. So for multiple reasons, I will be hesitant to come back as they didn't give me a reason to.", "author": "Richard C."}

Also, we ordered a small bottle of Nama Sake off the shelf, but no prices were listed in the menu. Huge mistake not to ask before as the tiny bottle ending up being $25. I can usually buy a bottle of Nama Sake for about $10-$12 dollars so I was a little shocked to see that price on the check.\n\nAll in all the ramen was amazing.

I had a stomach ache from eating some bad pizza earlier in the day, and I swear the Miso ramen calmed my stomach so much I was able to sleep great that night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-02", "description": "I guess some reviewers mentioned about the chaotic task management at the restaurant, but I didn't read through the long reviews to notice the warning.\n\nThe Ramen in general is good, nothing special, but taste good. The server mixed up my Ramen and my friend's. We both ordered Miso Ramen, but I ordered it without garlic and spice, but extra veggies. He handed me over my friend's Ramen and said it is the one with extra veggies, so I didn't question further even though I was suspicious. It looks a bit red (indicates chili source), and I can't really tell there is extra veggies. But the thing is the one my friend got doesn't seem to have extra veggies either.... we accepted them as is, but I was not quite happy about the fact of mixing up and the lack of veggies. We ordered hot tea, it took quite a while for them to serve, and the tea came out cold. They gave us new ones when we mentioned it, so that's good. My friend ordered a bottle of sake, but the server seemed a bit pushy to get us out when my friend was still enjoying his sake. I understand there is a line waiting, but rushing your customers is never a good thing.\n\nI actually have one suggestion for this place: open up your seats at Crazy Sushi since it's the same place, same owner. Why having your customers wait when the other side is empty? You are not maximizing your potential revenue!", "author": "Jenny N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-23", "description": "I had a very bad experience at this restaurant yesterday. I was a regular customer there and we had a family tradition of going there on weekend evening. We would always enjoy our experience of going to a friendly neighborhood ramen place. I had always gone there with my husband and 2 year old daughter previously, but last evening around 7:00 pm I went there with my daughter. This restaurant has two connected sections with seating in both sections. When I got there one of the sections was completely full except for two bar-style tables along the front windows. The waitress who approached to seat me asked if I'd like to be seated at the window seat with high bar chairs. Since I was with my toddler daughter, I did not feel it was safe for her to be seated on a high bar seat so I said no and that I would prefer to be seated at a normal table. The waitress replied to that and said that in that case I would have to wait. There were several empty tables in the adjoining seating area that I could see and I asked her the waitress about being seated there. To that she replied \"those tables are for sushi, you will have to wait\". So without even asking me whether I wanted to order sushi or not, she automatically presumed that I don't want sushi! I guess I must have had \"I don't want sushi written all over my forehead!\"\n\nAfter a few seconds contrary to her earlier statement, the waitress came back and led me to table in the \"Sushi\" section, which was possibly the most horrible and uncomfortable table in that section or the entire place. It was a really low table by the window, with very small and low and uncomfortable stools to sit on, even though there were several normal tables available in that section. My toddler daughter kept falling off the tiny stool all the time. I saw several people in that section eating normal food including ramen and not just sushi and when I questioned one of the waiters about it and that why I was told that this was the \"sushi\" only section when there were several people eating other food as well, he said that people in that section had to order sushi besides ordering normal food and that since I had a small child with me they had made an \"exception\" for me and given me a table in that section.\n\nAfter that I ordered 2 appetizers and a ramen bowl for main course. The order in which my food arrived was: 1 appetizer and the ramen and 15 minutes later the second appetizer. The waiter who took my order, specifically asked me if I wanted an extra bowl for my daughter for the ramen and I had said yes to that, but the extra bowl never arrived and when I tried to flag one of the waiters to try to get one, they deliberately avoided making eye contact to avoid me.\n\nCoco Ramen, you just lost a loyal customer! I am never going back to your restaurant and neither will I ever recommend it to anyone I know. I hope you learn to treat your customers equally, fairly, and with dignity and respect in the future.", "author": "Shalini D."}

Their ramen was solid, better than most of the ramen in Japantown, maybe even Suzu.  It's probably now going to stand toe-to-toe against Ken Ken or even Nute's Noodles, but that's going to be their competition from my stand point.  I didn't have their tonkotsu which is a real comparison point, but their miso was good and their veggie broth version was very good.  And they have solid ajitama eggs.  Not all places have these shoyu marinated slow cooked eggs and theirs was excellent, as good as Ken Ken's.  They put a lot of love into the presentation and included toppings.  Good (non-funky) bamboo shoot is refreshing too.  Highly recommend if you live in the neighborhood.", "author": "Christian G."}
