We decided to snag a brew and wind down our day. He said that he's been here before and it is a good spot to hangout. I concur. This place is on the older side, it is a neighborhood bar and I like the older feel. \n\nUpon walking in this place is divey; great vibe and a place I would want to become a regular, if I lived in the area. People are just watching TV, different sports are playing. There is only one bartender but she is not overwhelmed, there is enough people in the bar but not crowded. There are seats that go around the bar (as usual) and there are seats there are tables that fit four people where you can sit on your own. \n\nThe brews on tap are all we drank. I had the death and taxes and my bud had the Gose sour. Solid brews that aren't your normal choices. I always appreciate places trying different styles of beers that aren't your standard beers on tap. As far as drink, I have no idea of their mixology. The food pretty limited. There isn't a menu for it, rather its stricly bar snacks. You can purchase you own chips, but there is a popcorn stand that people can get complimentary. Just ask the bartender for a bowl and you can grab your own as many times as you want. There are condiments to add to it - more cheese, garilic and spice to your own liking.\n\nIn the back there is one pool table. Old school billards where you have to ask the bartender for change. My only qualm is that there was a hair in my second beer, it happens. Otherwise this place is a solid choice I would go to on a regular.", "author": "Mark G."}

Jolly Times was there when Tommy fell in the lake. Jolly Times was there when I plucked Tommy from icy hell & an arctic obituary. And Jolly Times was there as Helen, angel, savior, maiden of salvation, wrapped our frigid frost bitten bodies in hand woven woolen blankets. There, side by side with my comatose companion in our complacent cocoon, Helens eyes tore at my very existence. At the funeral, as Tommy's nubile corpse lowered into an eternity of unknown darkness & a massive abyss of emptiness, I passed a handful of Jiffy Pop\u2122 to Helen.

Such joy. Such love. Such... \n\nTo try to explain the torrential emotions that are brought to the surface of my once guarded heart by Jiffy Pop's delicate balance of flavors would be a fools errand.

No. And it is all the better as such. \n\nO Nepenthe, wipe clean the slate of my mind. Leave not a trace of this wretched history I have made. Sweet Helen, forgive my impotence.

Basically any qualities that make a bar a dive bar can be found here. \n\nSmoking after 11pm (and trust me, you notice quick), pool in the back, beer, whiskey, old men staring at young women, etc. \n\nOne of the grossest things... My guy friend walked into the bathroom and one of the older regulars hadn't locked the door and he saw him \"flogging the dolphin.\" Needless to say I made sure to avoid anything this guy touched after that. \n\nOtherwise... the bar is fun, pretty decent amount of seating, and I don't know who said there weren't beer specials, but I all I saw were signs everywhere posting different beer specials. None on the night we went except for the \"Ladies Discount\" (see Jessica L.'s upcoming review for more details on this!). \n\nFrom what I remember...\n\nMonday Night- Industry night (for those who work in restaurant/bar)\nWednesday Night- I think something like $2 Coronas??? \nuh... not sure about the rest... \n\nAlso I liked that the bartenders didn't scoff at the fact that I drank a lot of water.", "author": "Ali R."}

Not thugs, just sort of uninteresting and a little pedestrian. You would sort of expect that in a dive-bar but unlike the dives in the TL where the regulars offer a fascinating window into the world of human dysfunction, the Duck's patrons just seem like people that are way too into sports, trucks, and jet skis. Nikki H. hit the nail on the head in her review where she said \"It's the closest you can get to finding San Diego here in San Francisco\". And that's not a ringing endorsement is it? \n\nIn addition to the idiot friendly juke box (Sublime? Really? Is that the best you can do?) there seems to be some indication that the ownership supports our current idiot President and the occupation of Iraq. That's my interpretation and could be wrong but the place seemed friendly to that kind of jingoism and I'm not too keen on supporting it. \n\nThat being said, I've had at least one fun night here and the staff seem to know what they are doing, particularly the tall red headed guy. They have a pool table and some fairly serious dart players.  Seems based on other reviews there are some drink specials to help out the broke people who probably have the most reason to drink so at least they are performing a public service. There's usually a boisterous crowd out in front, particularly during local and high profile sports matches and the energy seems pretty good. I think I'd still rather go to the Fireside Bar but if my choices are limited to the Mucky or Yancy's well then the lesser of two evils gets my vote. And that's Al Gore.", "author": "lazslo t."}

What really pissed me off though were the ridiculous drink prices.  I don't know if they were inflating the charges because they knew it would be busy because of the game or what, but I was with several people that were drinking.

During the late 90's, it was the go-to spot in the Inner Sunset for all things shady.\n\nFast forward to 2006.  I've been here three times in the last year, and each time it's seemed that the old guard has moved along.  Yow...this place was just too young for me.  Every face I saw looked like it was within two years of legal drinking age.  Two girls in their early twenties to my right were clearly avoiding any kind of eye contact with me.  One lone youngster to my left had tattoos and a funky hairdo....he was about as engaging as a post-puberty kid while being lectured by his parents.\n\nDecor is standard issue beer-advertising schlock, a smattering of garden-variety NFL stuff, and a tiny bit of fairly weak sports memorabilia.  Well placed TV's and LCDs make the place a decent spot to catch a game, but the music is surprisingly old-guard, static, and stale.  A single dart board occupies a freakish spot towards the entrance, while a pool table sits towards the rear.\n\nThe Mucky Duck always seemed to be the Inner Sunset's haven for misfits and outcasts of all ages.  As of late, little has changed, save my observation that the collection of misfits seems to have grown younger.  Maybe I've hit this place at bad times, but on the three recent occasions where I've darkened the door at the Duck, I've failed to strike up any sustained conversation with the patrons.  Twenty-somethings may have a different experience, but I found it cold, lacking character, and middle-aged hostile.
