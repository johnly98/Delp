My parents are frugal Asians not particularly adventurous with food. Coming from an afternoon visit to the Asian Art Museum, we back to Civic Center and this place caught their fancy with the lunch special and familiar looking dishes. \n\nIt was quiet during lunch, we were seated right away. Probably more of a takeout/delivery place. The service was very nice service and prompt. Complimentary egg drop soup and slices of oranges post-meal. They had generous lunch special portion sizes of both the main and the side of white rice (my parents love white rice). Mains are little on the oily side.\n\nFive Spice Chicken - Fragrant but not too sweet. I feel like I'd enjoy this more with tofu instead of meat actually. A very generous serving of meat on top of fresh broccoli. The chicken wasn't that good quality, I had a few bites and left the rest for my parents.\nCashew Broccoli Chicken - The first thing noticed where the cashews whole cashews (not bits and pieces) and sizeable. The broccoli was cooked a little firm still and seasoned in a salty garlic sauce.\nBeef with Mushroom - Only ate the vegetables from my parents dish but they were well seasoned but too much of the starchy sauce for my liking.", "author": "Truc N."}

Well, this is that type of restaurant.  No no, not where they laugh or judge you for ordering the same thing every time (btw, meatless orange chicken is my go to), but the place that you always order your take-out from.  During my one month of living in the city, my roommates and I would order from GKT once a week like clockwork. So having never dined in this restaurant, this review is purely based on their delivery service and food.\n\nTheir delivery service is fast.  I usually get my food within 30 minutes of ordering.  I ordered from Eat24 one time and they were so fast the app didn't even have the chance to update the order status.  As far as the food goes, it's definitely not the best Chinese food I've had but for the price and portion you get, it's enough.  Their lunch menu items/combo is too much food for one person to eat. They also come with egg drop soup.  As I mentioned before, their meatless orange chicken blew my mind when I first tried it.  Combination chow mein lacked flavor and fell flat but they really pack on the meats (bbq pork, beef, and shrimp).  Their chow fun is delicious.  Egg drop soup could use more salt. Mongolian beef has way too much red bell peppers and lacking other ingredients but it's tasty and spicy.\n\nIf I ever live in the city again, I'd probably try other places, but GKT and I will always have fond memories of being young, broke, and practically homeless.", "author": "Anne D."}

The reason for the 4 stars is because that nothing ever WOWs me. The lady and her husband are really great, honest people which I love dealing with because I know every time I go in that it won't be a challenge just to get some General Tsaos Chicken and their Salmon Fried Rice. To me, that's one of the only reasons why I love this place because any restaurant that has salmon fried rice is my best friend. \nHonestly, they have been so consistent in their food quality and their service that I see why they are one of the lasting restaurant on the block. All but 3 out of 7 have stayed open during the wave, and they are one of them. But honestly, don't go if you're looking for a \"nice and hip\" spot to eat at. Go for the food and not the atmosphere.

The menu is pretty extensive and covers many of the main Chinese food dishes and there is also a pre-set menu for your large groups. \n\nI ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings with fried rice which was very good. The wings are pretty big and I liked the level of crispness without being extremely greasy. Yes I have has better, but these are by no means bad wings. They also came with a good helping of steamed broccoli. \nMy grandmother ordered the mango chicken and I was very impressed with what they served. This restaurant seems to be trying to fight the idea of stinginess because there was more chicken on that plate than broccoli that was on my plate! And the mango... I've never seen a dish (even fruit dishes) come with that much mango. The sauce was delicious because I could tell they used real mangos to flavor it, let alone be a main part of the dish. Definitely a thumbs up considering most places give you what looks like leftover scrapings of meats and fruit amidst a stir fry of vegetables. \n\nAll I'm all, a very good QUICK meal for very cheap. We were finished eating within 25 minutes of waking in the door, and each of our HEAPING dishes was about $7. Definitely a great deal for your money.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Well, this one isn't mine, but I guess it could be if I lived closer to the Tenderloin. Jamie W. and I were starving after a marathon community awards ceremony at which he was the recipient of four well-deserved citations, so afterward, we braved walking down Turk Street close to 9PM to grab something to eat here. No surprise that it was nearly empty with only one other customer in the place slurping some soup quite loudly.\n\nIt's bland stuff they serve here. It doesn't offend, it doesn't thrill. It's just the type of Chinese food you eat and promptly forget an hour later. But I'll try to explore the bowels of my subconscious and remember what we ordered. Oh yes, we had the $5.95 Fried Chicken Wings, pretty good value (you get eight...but who's counting) yet nowhere near as good as the ones at Capitol in Chinatown and strangely piled on a bed of fried noodles as if there wasn't enough grease on that plate (see photo). Next up was the $8.25 Mongolian Beef, which was overtaken by onions and lacquered in an inexplicable brown sauce (see photo).\n\nSpeaking of which, the brown sauce showed up again in the $7.25 plate of Sauteed String Beans (see photo), which really tasted like the vegetarian twin of the Mongolian Beef. But hey, how picky can you get near 10PM on a weeknight? The woman serving us frankly couldn't be more attentive, and the food came out in record time when we just wanted to wolf and bail. It's also a semi-scary part of town, so you don't want to be loitering too much later anyway. But Golden Kim Tar is what it is, so give the place credit for being no less.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...lots of brown sauce here, but I can still eat it\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well, there are plenty of tables at this hour\nSERVICE - 4 stars...she was always ready to serve us\nTOTAL - 3 stars...when you need a go-to place to go to...late in the evening", "author": "Ed U."}

So much so that I've ordered delivery from them about 20 times in the past year according to my eat24 account, but today will be my last time ordering from them.\n\nFirst of all, the driver demanded a tip. Yeah, that's never a good sign. Next, I take my food inside and set it on my counter, only to find that the container holding my extra hot Kung Pao chicken had exploded all over, ruining both that dish and the one on the bottom. The food itself was piping hot and I burned my hand in trying to save the dish below it, but I had to toss out most of the food I'd ordered. I got back on live chat with eat24, they're great as always and saved the day and refunded me.\n\nHowever, this is what happened when the restaurant called me while trying to resolve this, which is why I'm taking my case to Yelp. I got a phone call from a woman at Golden Kim Tar who I had a very tough time understanding as her accent was very thick, she was also loud and didn't listen to what I had to say. She first demanded I give the damaged food back, which I was incredulous at since most of it is now in my garbage. So I asked, you really want me to give you my garbage? Apparently yeah she did. I then made my own demand of a refund, and all I heard on her end was some unintelligible yelling and then she hung up on me. Sorry guys, you lost a loyal customer with some unacceptably crappy service.", "author": "Patricia M."}

My Chinese friends are always dragging me to some godforsaken place in Roland Heights, or Alhambra, or Stockton swearing on their grandmother's ghost that THIS will be the place that will convince me that Chinese food isn't terrible.\n\nAll to no avail.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when near starvation late on a Thursday night brought me into the only place open within blocks in a somewhat sketchy landscape where no doubt crack was more readily available than food.  They were about to close, but they could see the desperation in my eyes, and without even handing me a menu my server said:  what would you like?  I stammered a bit about liking kung pao shrimp and spicy eggplant, and in less than 10 minutes I was  served one of the best Chinese meals of my life.  \n\nAmazing service, amazing food:  fresh, flavorful.\n\nThen, a week later, I said to myself, \"I wonder what Yelp thinks about this little place?\"\n\nAnd lo and behold, I don't seem to be in the minority.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-14", "description": "After moving here from living abroad, various places int he U.S.  and whatever...blah blah, I am really disappointed with the food quality here in SF. So, before I write my review, let me explain this so that hopefully my review will help you make an informed decision on wither you want to order from this place, and ultimately anyplace in SF.\n\nOne of the big reasons why I moved back here is that there are tons of restaurants of pretty much anything you could ever want, in pretty close proximity. That is great, but the problem is that it seems like 85% are all kind of blah, the same thing, and not standing out for flavor profiles. Example: I've had 15 different bin mah sandwich's at 15 different places and non of them come close to the one's in Miami from one place (Miss Saigon), same thing with Fried Rice (either Chinese or Japanese) competitive with Denver and Miami (Go To Sushi -Miami- has the best Japanese fried rice that I have had outside of of the Kyoto tower and Osaka). This city is supposed to be Asian food heaven, but so far it has been a constant let down. Kinda like this place.\n\nThe good: \n1. They deliver, and they do it till late night with a minimum of $$$ for your order, and pretty quick (ours came in 35min), yay!\n2. Proportions are pretty big, yay!, you'll be eating it for a couple of days.\n3. Best overall pictures (taken by a person who works there and knows what they are doing..no stupid Instagram camera photo there) so you know what your ordering and what it will look like. \n\nThe bad:\n1. Everything is just.....bland, some people are writing that stuff here is yummy, but honestly, I have no idea what they are thinking. Have they been just eating non-big-favor food, were their parents horrible cooks? And, is just eating food is a joyous occasion because everything else in their lives tasted like cold oatmeal, without the flavor packets? Do they want the attention, of blathering on and on just to hear themselves talk (see what I did there...that's irony) I have no idea, but here is what we ordered, and why I was let down (so far have not found ANY Chinese places that are any better for delivery for when I'm particularly lazy):\n\nThai Ice Tea -- not very sweet (5/10), bitter, not enough condensed milk.\n\nPot Stickers (6) -- the thickness of the dough was perfect (thick but not a bun), and the filling was pretty good, but they refuse to give you any sauce, Which sucks, because that ginger, soy sauce, garlic green onion stuff is perfect for this, and I'm too lazy to get of my ass and make it, that's why we invented delivery.\n\nFried Rice -- Had the best pictures for any fried rice that I've ever seen (the guy who took a pic of the entire menu for Yelp did a great job), and was really excited. But, it was the blandest fried rice he's had. It was not the super oily, dark type (it was a short grain kinda fluffy, but you could tell that they were not using the leftover rice from yesterday, which is the secret for great consistently fried rice. But, there was hardly any flavor to it. They used dark meat chicken, did not add green onions, and asked for it spicy (not spicy). Fluffy=good, not tasty=bad.\n\nFresh Lemonade -- fresh made, semi sweet, perfect amount of sugar vs. bitter. Around 8 oz.\n\nGeneral Tsao's Chicken (Lunch Menu) -- Bland, no flavor, tasted mild spicy level (when ordered spicy), over use of corn starch = disappointment.\n\nWon Ton Soup (Large) -- Wontons where pretty good, but soup base was off, don't know how to explain it, but just didn't really go there like wonton normally does. Got directions correct for no veggies, but disregarded leave green onions.\n\nShrimp Wonton -- It means meat wonton soup WITH shrimp, not shrimp wonton soup.\n\nTofu Sweet Corn Soup -- it's eggdrop soup with tofu, corn and egg, not a unique soup.\n\nFried Crab Meat Rangoon (6) -- Oil has not been filtered (so that you can reuse oil), had a very burnt taste, refuse to give you dipping sauce (red cornstarch based stuff).\n\nOrder for 3 people.", "author": "Max X."}

I ordered the crispy Hunan fish with fried rice and expected to get a little plate with some soggy fish pieces swimming in sauce and some gummy rice...soooo not what I was served.  The fish was crispy and delicious, the sauce was spicy and garlicky, the veggies (zucchini, onion, tomato, etc) all cooked so that they were tender, yet crisp, and the fried rice was delicious and NOT gummy or overly oily/salty.

Tasted like oil and a little bit of salt.\n\nKung Pao Chicken: The worst of the lot. Bland. Slimy. Not much chicken. None of the conventional veggies in Chinese cuisine.\n\nPork Fried Rice: Looks great.

At lunch time, this place is pretty, pretty busy, but I have to admit there is this one waitress (and I believe she is the head waitress) who is amazingly fast and very efficient in handling the customers and the take-out orders.  She's great and she is such a valuable asset to Golden Kim Tar...just totally awesome and very hospitable.  I can tell she takes pride in her work and she certainly knows how to keep a customer (such as myself) happy.\n\nI love their scrambled eggs with shrimp over rice.  It's reasonably price and they are definitely generous with the pieces of shrimp (at least 8 or 9 pieces).  I seldom can finish it in one sitting and I know why...my eyes get bigger than my stomach.  Everytime I order from them, it is the scrambled eggs with shrimp over rice.  I know I need to switch up and try other items on the menu besides this and won ton soup.  I guess the next time I will try their Ma Po Tofu rice plate.   \n\nEarlier this afternoon I wanted won ton soup to go.  I placed my order with the head waitress and waited along with other customers who had take out orders.  The wait was a little longer than I expected...boom, it all of suddenly got pretty busy.   People were coming in for lunch.  It looked like wall-to-wall people and I wasn't sure if there were enough tables and chairs available to accommodate them.  Me, I would have been overwhelmed by the scene, but she and her crew of waitresses maintained their cool and pretty much handled everybody.  They worked that room \"like a piece of cake\" and I didn't care that my won ton soup was sitting on the back burner in the kitchen and I haven't paid for it yet.  I just watched and observed them, and they left me with a good lasting impression.  BTW, how was the won ton soup?  Piping hot and quite delicious with a couple pieces of bok choy and broccoli.  I had to blow on the broth and the won ton to cool it down before slurping it.\n\nSince I had no disappointment from this place, I will return for many more visits.", "author": "Carol C."}

It turned out that wasn't the case, but it was a little too late to change our minds as the lady manning the cashier ushered us in and showed us to our table. \n\nWhen she came to take our order, my roommate decided (I'm still not sure whether it was out of ignorance or a fervent desire for the extraordinary) on a whim that he wanted Burmese food, and so he asked if they serve this famous Burmese noodle soup. \n\nThe lady went inside the kitchen to consult with the chef, who actually came out and asked my roommate how the dish was prepared. Ten minutes later he came out with what looked to be a Burmese dish and said, \"Give it a try, see if you like it.\" What kind of altruistic, people-pleasing chef is this? Do they even exist? \n\nRubbing my eyes, I tried the dish with my roommate and it was a damn good imitation of the real dish (which I found out the day after when we actually went to Burmese Kitchen). My roommate agreed.\n\nWhen the check came, it was only for my meal, a rice plate that was pretty darn good as well. We asked the lady why we weren't charged for the Burmese noodle soup, and the chef came out and said, \"Well, it wasn't on the menu, and I wasn't sure if you'll like it, so no charge. Just come back next time and I'll make something else for you.\"\n\nI was in awe of the display of kindness and business ethics this guy has shown us.

Okay not really, but even though he was late he was EXTREMELY apologetic about it. Their ceiling got damaged from the storm and he had to try to fix the leak =( \nI really hope their restaurant did okay through the storm, the delivery guy was so nice.\n\nOk I can't believe I wrote a review about a freaking delivery guy...\n\nBut anyway! The portions for my breakfast were HUGE!!! And only $3.95!!!

Just kidding!  \n\nThe first time I was here, I wanted something soup-like, but I didn't want to dine-in which is the only way to enjoy pho.  That meant I couldn't eat at half of the places within a 2 block radius.  And I didn't want a sandwich.  That left only chinese food.  I've been wary about chinese food because I'm chinese.  And most Americanized chinese places are equivalent to mom-and-pop greasy spoons.  It's not exactly what mother used to make.  \n\nWhen I came in, I started scoping out what everyone else was eating.  The thing that looked oh-so-tasty and lip-smacking delicious was the soups.  Wonton soups.  Some had seafood, some did not.  I wanted some clear broth with that nice aromatic quality, no MSG and some plump juicy wontons.  \n\nLuckily, on the specials board (I wonder if the specials ever change?), there was a writing on the wall: Combination war wonton soup.  $5.99.  Why the heck not?  10 mins later and $6.50 later, I had in a plastic container some beautiful looking wontons in clear but robust sauce.  I hurried back to the office, threw my stuff all over Tyron's desk and started killing the wontons.  The sliced meat/shrimp in the broth was delicate.  More delicate than the mongolian beef i just ate from this place.  The wontons were generous and the skin was just the right thickness.  Noodle-like but not doughy.\n\nToday, I ordered the mongolian beef.  It was spicy!  It had a lot of beef, and sugar.  I think it was too sweet, and the beef was not as tender as in the soup.  But they sure gave me a whole lot of it!  I'll be eating that for lunch for the next few days, that's for sure.  \n\nIn the future, I'll stick with the wonton soup.  There was also enough to last two meals.  And I really love soup.", "author": "Christina C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-27", "description": "Simple version: Ordered for delivery, the food arrived an hour late and nearly cold. Rude phone service. The salt and pepper calamari was adequate but also greasier than I've had elsewhere. \n\nLong version: Filling in the blanks here from the simple version, I decided to order lunch for myself and my flu-stricken boyfriend at around 10:30a before his 1p work shift. Hopped onto GrubHub and selected Golden Kim Tar based on its being recommended by fellow users of the site, as well as by users here. Ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, won ton soup, and a small side of white rice to go along with some brown rice I had yet to prepare. Done and done by 10:50a, with an email order confirmation stating an estimated arrival time of 11:35a. Perfect, more than enough time to have a meal before having to send off the working man.\n\n11:40 comes around and no food, so I decided to call the restaurant to ensure delivery was imminent. I suppose rude isn't quite the correct word to employ here, though the call did end abruptly after she hung up on me. Maybe the right word would be... unprofessional? That's rather harsh, but the exchange went something like: \n\nMe: I ordered four dishes online that have yet to arrive, I just want to confirm they're on the way.\nHer: Yes, give it, like, 15 or 20 minutes. \nMe: 15 or 20 minutes? I ordered the food nearly an hour ago.\nHer: No no, the food is already on the way there, I said 15 to 20 minutes so you wouldn't get angry. \nMe: Sorry? Um, so it'll be here very soon, right?\nHer: Yes, it's on its way *click*\n\nSomething about that rubbed me the wrong way, and I waited for the food impatiently pacing, and maybe fuming. Given this, maybe I wasn't in the proper state to be judging their menu, especially since it was my first time experiencing theirs and it was food delivered. I will say that the food did arrive but not until 12:05p and that the rice was dry and cool, and the calamari was barely adequate and also cool. The Chinese broccoli was tasty, but I've hardly ever experienced a bad iteration of the dish. All of the dishes sat atop paper doilies that separated it from shredded lettuce, which was considerate but also a little odd. Nothing that screamed either authenticity or any consideration for aesthetics, though, again, this is a delivery order. \n\nI'd only go back for Golden Kim Tar if I were going to be eating at the restaurant itself, but don't imagine wanting to with other places like T\u00fa Lan or even Th\u00e8m Ky around in relative proximity.", "author": "Jake m."}

A nearby restaurant we order from occasionally did have party size trays, but they were pretty expensive and had an extremely limited selection - maybe 5-6 main dish options. They also did not deliver the party sizes. I began searching through Eat 24, looked at a few places and then found Golden Kim Tar. Their selection is tremendous (pretty much any main dish item you would get on the menu was available in party size, as far as I could tell) and prices are very competitive for the 5 lb. party trays of food. I planned on ordering through Eat 24, but called to make sure they delivered to our address, and to see how far in advance they needed my order. I ended up placing the order on the phone (which cost me the 5% rebate or whatever from Eat 24) because the employee who answered said I needed to place it immediately. Anyway, communications were not the most clear, but the delivery came within the time frame I'd requested and the food was really, really good! We kept it pretty basic (sweet and sour pork and chicken fried rice, General Tso's chicken, house special egg rolls and combination chow mein) but everything tasted great and the rice and chow mein had the biggest chunks of meats I've ever seen. Really delicious. I will say that there was more than enough food, more than we ever needed, which made for some great take home and next day leftovers at work.

The portions are HUMONGOUS!\n\n3. Supercheap! $20 worth of food consists of 2 huge full entrees, an appetizer and a free chowmein or fried rice which can feed 3- 4 people.\n\n4.  The dishes are actually yummy.  Not yummy as in \"I'll brave the TL to get to this food\" yummy but as long as I work around the area, I'll eat here. So far, I've had the Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, Beef with Black Mushroom, Kung Pao Tofu (my fave so far), etc.  They are all delicious!!! \n\nFor the first time last week I tried their delivery service.  I phoned in my order and they delivered the food to my office punctually as I requested.\n\nI was ecstatic!  It means that I can have Chinese Food Nights with boyfriend for cheap and just a phonecall away!\n\nThe restaurant itself is non-descript but the servers were very friendly.\n\nTip:  If you are visiting the beautiful San Francisco Main Library (SFPL), you can ask Golden Kim Tar to deliver your food to  the library. Just don't eat your food at SFPL.  NO EATING/DRINKING ALLOWED AT THE LIBRARY!\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Leah E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-08-28", "description": "This review is largely based on my most recent visit on a Tuesday evening.\n\nOverall: 2.25/5\nFood is definitely edible but some plates need more flavor. Beware the rice!\n\nDecor: 0.5\nPretty spacious. Glass-covered tables. TV playing movies for your pleasure.\n\nFood: 0.5 x 2\nMaybe I'm too Americanized when it comes to food, but the General Tso chicken is good. It's not too spicy or salty. For $6.25 (lunch price also available at dinner), it comes out really hot and steamy along with a huge wad of steamy rice even bigger than the pile of breaded and glazed chicken.\n\nHowever, the other saucy dishes are quite bland. Besides General Tso, which has a dark brown color, dishes using the light brownish sauce is really tasteless. Examples: the calamary that comes with twenty times the vegetables ($7.90), garlic chicken that doesn't even taste like garlic and has two times the vegetables ($6.25).\n\nPrice: 0.5\nLunch menu is a pretty good deal, starting at $6.25. If you get there before 2 PM, you get a soup with it. I don't recommend anything else based on price and quantity of meat. There are a lot of dishes using veggies as filler.\n\nService: 0.25\nThis subscore is based on my most recent visit. This would have been 0 were it not for the husband owner offering an extra plate so I could share my friend's dish. Other than that, the wife owner doesn't seem very happy. I'm pretty sure she can speak English, but she barely says anything or listens to our requests correctly. For example, we asked for separate checks, but we got a single check anyway. We asked for boxes to go, but instead of bringing them to us, she took only my plate (my friend's plate just had rice she wanted to take for later use). I saved quite a lot in order to have some for the next meal, but I'm suspicious of the amount actually put into the small box I got in return. In addition, I realized later that she didn't even include a significant amount of food in my to-go set. More specifically, it looks like I got maybe 6-8 piece of chicken out of maybe 15-20 that I saved. Don't even get me started on the pitiful amount of rice dropped to the bottom of the box. Considering this with her not initially taking my friend's rice (perhaps for later use?  a wild speculation) makes me suspect that they REUSE THE RICE AND FOOD. Not giving me the food I paid for and possibly reusing that stuff is not acceptable. So if you want to take your food to go, insist that you do it yourself. I certainly will, if I ever go back.\n\nOn other days, service is quite slow and unattentive, so this subscore would have gotten at most 0.25 anyway.", "author": "Brian H."}

For instance, I love the Thai Curry Noodle dish that is listed on the menu with chicken. With my need to know where my meat, poultry and fish come from, I assume that there is just no way that they could make the dish that they do at the price they do unless their meat is from indutrial farms, so I usually opt for a \"vegetarian\" option, that is not listed.

I'll admit, the chow fun wasn't stuck together like most places and it was cooked well and plenty.  But the flavor just tasted like soy sauce.  For Mongolian, I'd expect a lilttle more peppery flavor.  And the raw onion, no no no.

This sent me on a search for my scallops.  Turned out they were in there but shaved pretty thinly.  Once I started peeling off the breading I got to the scallops.  I discarded the mega breading and was left with an incredibly small pile of scallop shards and a huge pile of fried breading.  I then tasted the scallops, they were really very delicious and perfectly cooked and very succulent.  The walnut prawns were delicious, although breaded.  The shrimp fried rice was great, again the seafood was never overcooked, I really appreciate that.  So, be wary of the dishes, it appears it could be hit or miss.  I am not sure if I will give thwm another try or if I will pass, if I do try again, the mouthful of scallops for 13 bucks won't be among my selected items unless they get rid of the mega breading.", "author": "Jimmy D."}

Maybe it's one of those Cantonese things like when you're craving pei dan jook (preserved egg congee) or egg custard tarts, but nothing else will do. And I'm only Cantonese on my dad's side. \n\nAt any rate, I walked in here with the boyfriend, and when I saw that they had beef stew, that was it, and we agreed to not have stuff family style, 'cause he's a pescetarian. So the waitress came over and he ordered some veg spring rolls, a shrimp dish and rice first, and I ordered a bowl of beef stew noodle soup. She vehemently tried to persuade me to order family style and get a bunch more dishes. I explained that he doesn't eat red meat or poultry, and that I really wanted the ngau lam mein. She then tried to persuade me to order some seafood dishes. I told her that I really wanted ngau lam mein, and that I didn't want seafood. She pointed at the vegetable dishes. Again, I said that I really wanted ngau lam mein. Having tried and failed to persuade me to order meat, seafood, or vegetables, totally exhausting the menu of options save for appetizers, she finally smiled at me and said that if I wanted ngau lam mein, then I could have ngau lam mein. Yeah, it came out piping hot, the noodles were fine, and the stew meat that combination of chewy and tender that it's supposed to be, but the stew itself was really more like a thin broth with a few too many big old chunks of ginger. It also had broccoli, which is not what you usually get. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have insisted on ngau lam. The veg spring rolls were good, though.", "author": "Kristina L."}

However, the food is frequently substandard and inconsistent. I used to order the salt and pepper pork chop, but no more after paying for essentially a huge portion of fat and bone a couple of times.  I tried their vegetable egg foo young a few times and liked it. It had nice chunks of broccoli, carrots, onions,etc. You have to pay extra for rice so that's a rip-off but a lot of Chinese restaurants in this city do that. Tonight they used canned peas, carrots and corn in the egg foo young. No fresh veggies except the bean sprouts. What is it with these Chinese restaurants and canned vegetables? I had the same experience with Manor Coffee Shop (see my review). Also, the gravy was tasteless. It's listed on their menu under chef's specials at $8.25. Ok, I know that \"chef''s specials\", especially at Chinese restaurants, don't really mean anything, but considering the canned vegetables, it's a form of false advertising. Another dive Chinese restaurant. Survives, like many of them do, because of delivery orders.

I've liked everything I ordered except for one shrimp dish because the shrimp still had the tails left on which made it messy to eat.  They give you a complimentary large container of house soup even with takeout orders, which is great  (I've never seen a Chinese restaurant do this).  They also give you a slice of fruit for free, also with takeout orders.  Usually it's melon (honeydew, cantaloupe or watermelon).  I've ordered takeout and they're nice enough to bring you the fruit to eat while you're waiting.  Nice friendly people and I like that they're trying to do a little more by giving you these extras.  Food is good and consistent, prices reasonable.  They just started serving American style breakfasts (opens at 7:30 am) and what a bargain.  Most items are under $4.  I had a sausage and cheese 3-egg omelet with hashbrowns, an English muffin and free hot tea for only $4.25.  It wasn't brimming with sausage or cheese, but plenty of egg and done right.  The hashbrowns weren't very crisp but I didn't mind.  Filling, decent and so cheap.  Great option for that area.  I noticed they do a pretty good takeout business for breakfast and I hope they continue to get enough customers to keep doing this.  I noticed they also offer their entire menu because a guy at the next table was eating some seafood pan fried noodles at 9:00 in the morning.  This is great because most Asian restaurants don't open for business until lunchtime.  All in all, I like this place and will definitely be going back.", "author": "Mimi L."}
