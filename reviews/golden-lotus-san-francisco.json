I must say that Golden Lotus has everything I look for in a Vietnamese restaurant: cleanliness, impecable service, delicious food, and no cash only requirement. Yes, that's right. They accept cards! \n\nI've tried both the bun rieu from here and Pho 2000 and just say the one at Golden Lotus, this one is far more superior. They give you a large serving of crab, 2-3 shrimps, and a lot of cha (not sure what the English pronunciation is). A small bowl is $8.95 which is a little higher than Pho 2000 but it's definitely worth it! \n\nI've also had the banh uot here which is phenomenal and definitely reminds me of home as well due to the perfect taste of their fish sauce.

Same thing with the chopsticks...We ended up just fishing for chopsticks until we found ones that weren't sticky. The sauce cups were also dirty.\n\nEveryone was raving about the lemongrass pork rice rolls, so I had to order. It was decent, and unique from the typical spring rolls, but nothing epic. Wouldn't order it again.\n\nI was craving spicy and got the bunbohue.. i've had better broth in San Jose. It was a light, clean broth, but wasn't particularly satisfying. I did like the quality of the beef, steamed pork, and tendons though. \n\nI convinced my coworker to get the pho ga, since he's never had chicken pho before. and he really enjoyed the broth.

The beef was cut in small, easily chewable chunks and extremely well flavored.

A hot date would do it, but something tasty works just as well.  The likes of Lers Ros and Anh Hong?  I'd gladly come out here for them (or a hot Korean girl, but that's beside the point).  However, with apologies to my buddy's girlfriend, who strongly recommended this place to us, Golden Lotus falls short of joining that esteemed company for me...\n\nLocated in Turtle Tower's original digs, Golden Lotus doesn't look all that special on the surface, other than feeling a bit cleaner than its predecessor.  However, after giving the menu a once over, I could see the appeal.  The range of dishes is standard (appetizers, pho, bun, and rice plates), but within those categories, there are some interesting dishes to be had.  It's not often you see legit options like Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe), Bun Mam (Vietnamese \"gumbo\"), and Banh Uot (rice noodle sheets with fancy pork)!\n\n-- (#3) BANH CUON THIT NUONG - Rice Rolls with Grilled Lemongrass Pork, Mint, and Fried Shallots...$7\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-lotus-san-francisco?select=a1dMLokBwUmjmgbqLXyDOw)\nNot every Vietnamese restaurant offers this, so I was pretty excited to try it.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark for me.  The rice roll itself was fine, but I didn't care much for the meat.  It wasn't bad, per se, but I didn't care for the seasoning, especially in terms of all the lemongrass.\n\n-- (#2) CHA GIO - Imperial Rolls with Pork, Shrimp, Mushroom, Taro, Jicama, and Glass Noodles...$7.75\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-lotus-san-francisco?select=-qAn9eH946UEAysjk1F36A)\nWhen our order came out, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size - six rolls!  A lot more bag for the buck than my favorite (PPQ's in the Sunset), but not quite as tasty.  The filling was pretty decent, but the wrapper/skin was off.  It was crispy on the outside, but the inner layers were kind of gummy.\n\n-- (#21) PHO DAT BIET - Combination of Rare Steak, Flank, Brisket, Tripe, Tendon, and Beef Balls...$9.85 (large)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-lotus-san-francisco?select=KVuhH0F6OIetcAp3llv8qw)\nSetting aside how it was a little heavy on cilantro (ugh...), this was...okay.  The rare steak was fantastic and I liked the flank steak, but nothing else stood out.  It felt a little light on the noodles and meat, but my bigger qualm was with the broth.  It wasn't exactly bland, but it was kind of generic and wasn't very deep/rich.\n\nBeyond the food, I thought the service here was great!  The workers were all very nice and quite accommodating when my friend wanted to modify her order.  At the same time though, I can't say the food was particularly unique.  Solid, but not unique...nor something I'd come back to the TL for specifically.  While I'd come back to try their Banh Xeo or Bun Mam, if I'm out this way, I'd probably lean towards trying something new instead.  Sorry [buddy's girlfriend]!", "author": "Mike L."}

All the best to those guys but apparently my loyalty is to buildings, not restaurants, and this one remains great.\n\nThe main draw for me here is the pho chay, probably the best bowl of vegetarian pho I've had in the Bay. They stack it full of broccoli, tofu, and other green things and overpack it with unremarkable but perfectly serviceable rice noodles--I always go with the thick ones. Criss-cross the broth a few times with sriracha and hoisin and you're on your way to a flavorful meal that will satisfy without veering toward excess.\n\nService is prompt, respectful, and efficient.

Not exactly groundbreaking, but it'll fill you well, and I've noticed their meat is slightly more tender than other restaurants.  However, the reason you should go to GL is #62.  It's a special Vietnamese catfish stew; it's my friend's favorite and his exclusive order.  He's Vietnamese and despite having gone to Vietnamese joints around the city, we've never found the thing anywhere else.

While most are somewhat dry and lack flavor, Golden Lotus rare steak was soft, fresh and flavorful thin meat slices.  It was as if I ordered quality beef for shabu!  The broth was perfect (apparently wagyu beef broth), but neither of us could consume the entire cauldron set before us.  All the bean sprouts, basil and jalape\u00f1o slices were devoured with the noodles and tasty meat between us though!\n\nAdditionally, to the excellent pho we had here, these guys are really nice and friendly.

It was my birthday and I was having Asian food extravaganza. After going to Wing Lee for dim sum and Japantown for a Thai Tea with boba, boyfriend and I went to Sai Jai Thai, and then I wanted Vietnamese. I didn't realize there were so many Thai and Vietnamese places so close to each other, but after getting most of our Thai food in a to-go box, we walked around the corner to find this and another Vietnamese restaurant next door to one another. The first place was pretty small and pretty full. We grabbed a paper menu and stepped outside to look at it. We poked our heads into the next restaurant, and the friendly man behind the register walked all the way out to the sidewalk to try to usher is in. Sometimes this bugs me, but this time I found it endearing. The place had about ten tables; only one or two others had patrons when we entered around 7:15pm, but most of them were being used by the time we left a bit before 8:30.\n\nThough the waitress strongly recommended the imperial rolls, I had my heart set on spring rolls, which were delicious (as expected). The peanut sauce that came with them was also just right (I really appreciate it when a server lets me know what they like on the menu).\nI asked for her advice on which meat to get in my bun (vermicelli), though I usually always get pork. She suggested pork, as if it was no-brainer. The pork was sliced almost razor thin; I had rolling foodgasms. I couldn't stop eating even when I was full, it was just too delicious.\nI got a Thai Iced Tea and boyfriend got a Vietnamese coffee. Both were delicious, the coffee so strong, as they usually are. When I finally was able to pull my face out of my bowl of food, I asked for a to-go box. The waitress even brought a small container for peanut sauce and then when the amount I had left didn't fill it, she basically insisted on giving me more, with more crushed peanuts on top.\n\nThe entire experience was great, I've been singing the praises of this restaurant, the servers, the food, the atmosphere, everything about it in general. Even the neighborhood isn't a turn off because most, um, homeless and/or less than fully mentally competent people mostly keep to themselves, or are friendly rather than scary.

So, if you wait until dinner time, your selection will be limited.  2 entrees and an appetizer ran between $25-30.

BANH CUON THIT NUONG - This was a great appetizer to start us off - rice rolls with grilled pork and a variety of vegetables, which were crisp and crunchy throughout.  They didn't skimp on the amout of meat, and the rice roll had a great texture.  The only negative was the dipping liquid - I would have much preferred peanut sauce here.  I guess it's just a preference, but I didn't enjoy the sweet/sour liquid that came with it.  \n\n14. PHO TAIBO VIEN - This pho was not the best I've had, but also not the worst.

I have tried four other pho places in a two block radius -- including Four Seasons, Bodega Bistro, Mangosteen, and Vietnam House. \n\nPho 2000 is, by far, the best of them all by a mile. \n\nGolden Lotus having four stars on Yelp, helped alleviate some of my concerns. That was where the optimism ended. I typically get Pho Tai (Steak and Brisket), so that's what I'm basing most of my review on. First off, they didn't give me brisket, instead giving me tripe. I was too hungry to send it back, so I just started eating. I did tell them, however, so I wouldn't be charged an extra dollar (which they still did). Their broth was the darkest I'd ever seen and heavy (salty) on the flavor, which made tasting the nuances of sriracha, very difficult. Even squeezing lime into a spoonful of soup was disappointing. The steak did not easily break up from biting, requiring a bit of chewing. I like inhaling my food much better.\n\nThey made many other service mistakes, but it's really not that important.

I usually order the pho dac biet with beef on the side because I don't like my beef super well done. It usually gets tough and super chewy when it is. What I absolutely love about this place is that they serve Wagyu beef instead of regular, cheap, poor quality beef as compared to most pho restaurants. They easily give at least 6 pieces of Wagyu beef and it melts in your mouth. It's so delicious! There's also plenty of meat if you order dac biet (since dac biet is basically all of the meat they have to offer).  The noodles they serve are the thicker rice noodles but you can opt out for thin rice noodles or even egg noodles. I usually don't like the thicker noodles but I've grown to enjoy it with their flavorful and super hot broth! Besides pho, they also have different Vietnamese noodle soups such as bun rieu and bun bo hue. Other specialities such as banh xeo and rolled rice sheets.

They were great at bringing waters and teas for everyone and took everyone's orders promptly. \n\nHowever, there were a few things that went wrong during our dining experience. \n\n1. Firstly, we all ordered at the same time. Half of us ordered dry vermicelli and rice dishes and the other half ordered pho soup noodles. One of our coworkers got his order of pho noodles within the first 5 minutes of ordering, but the rest of us got our food at least 10 minutes afterwards. Which was strange...because you would think that the pho noodles would all come out first around the same time, but it was very sporadic. My co-worker that got his food first said his soup came out lukewarm too. So it left us all wondering whether or not he got a messed up order from a different party... \n\n2. Another friend from my group ordered the 5 spice chicken pho. However, when she got her chicken all her chicken pieces were pink on the inside (like abnormally pink) AND she said it did not taste like chicken. Some of us were wondering if it was duck.. It was bad enough that they served her under cooked chicken but it would be even worse if they had served here some mystery meat that wasn't chicken. Perhaps the chicken had freezer burn and therefore was extremely pink? She told the waitress and the waitress apologized and brought it in for the kitchen to re-cook. When the order of chicken was re-done, most of the chicken was cooked this time, except a few end pieces were STILL pink. She pointed it out to the waitress again because she wanted the kitchen know they kept giving her pink chicken. To have to send uncooked meat back to the kitchen twice is pretty terrible. Again, I am unsure as to why the chicken was that color (it was dark pink- close to red in color) but they should not have been serving it. I think they should have taken it off the bill but they never offered. \n\nWith those two things in mind, I ordered the dry vermicelli noodles with vegetables (egg, shiitake mushrooms and sprouts) and vegetarian imperial rolls. The overall dish was alright. Not the best. The noodles tasted like they were frozen and not heated back up all the way since they were slightly hard and not chewy. The Imperial rolls were good. \n\nI personally would not choose to come back here. You have plenty of other good/decent Vietnamese restaurants in the area to choose from. I would be cautious ordering their chicken!", "author": "Sam L."}

The menu consists of appetizers, pho, bun, garlic noodle dishes, rice plates, and vegetarian items.  \n\nWe ordered:\n- Pho Dac Biet Pho Noodle Soup - consists of rib eye steak, tripe, well-done flank steak, tendon and beef meatballs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-lotus-san-francisco?select=S_J1Y_bziS8A_NzMB7uSpw#dFkWM9Z_IKswokoO4Ce_1Q) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-lotus-san-francisco?select=S_J1Y_bziS8A_NzMB7uSpw#XVHMWJG3Ews2_7_WT2As4A).  With a choice of small ($7.15) or large ($8.15), I opted for a large bowl with the rib eye steak on the side so that I can place it in the soup on my own.  They don't use the typical rice noodles, but a slightly wider rice noodle.  The broth had good flavor, but it was not piping hot.  Also, the bowl was not comparable to the \"large\" size served by the establishment a couple storefronts down.  I would consider it \"medium\" in size.\n\n- Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio - consists of grilled pork and imperial rolls over noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts and peanuts.

For SF, Golden Lotus offers solid and affordable Vietnamese food. Disclaimer - I come from the land of cheap Vietnamese eats (San Gabriel Valley in LA) so  my standards are somewhat unrealistic and overly harsh.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the bi cuon (shredded pork rolls) to share. The shredded pork was reminiscent of my childhood and oh-so-yummy, and paired so well with the fresh crispiness of the mints. The flavor of the rolls was amazing. The size of the rolls were applause-worthy too. No sad, limp rolls here. There are 2 to an order, but they halve the rolls and it's definitely enough to be 4 rolls.\n\nI ordered the pho with rare beef and beef balls. I love beef balls (heehee). For those who don't, you can order rare beef with other options - tripe, tendon, and if you don't like those either, you can go with just straight up beef. I appreciated that they were not stingy with the beef and beef balls. One strange thing I did notice was that although you could choose the type of noodle you want, by default they used thick rice noodles which are not traditionally in pho. The pho is better off, imo, with thin rice noodles as the default and customers should be able to switch to another noodle type if they wish.\n\nMy boyfriend had the beef stew (bo kho). The dish was definitely hearty (as it should be). It had plenty of beef (including tendon which not everyone will like, he certainly didn't), carrots, and a small amount of noodles. Value!!

This, in my opinion, is a very typical order that they must get pretty often, but our waiter failed to mention that here, pho noodles means flat wide rice noodles equivalent to Chinese 'fun' noodles.  When my order came out, I was expecting the thin angel hair thick noodle that I was used to, and when I made a comment to the waiter, he said that this is their version of pho, and if I wanted to order the other kind of noodle, I would have had to request it as an alternative. I thought this noodle was very bland and lacked the texture and chewiness that other pho noodles have, and these wide noodles kind of just fell apart mushily even when I was just scooping it out of the broth.  Despite my apathy towards my dish, the waiter proceeded to convince that this was the \"better\" kind of noodle that is served fresh and has never been dried, and indicated that it was a fault on my part for ordering wrong (but this was just not my expectation when ordering a typical Vietnamese dish, and there were no pictures in the menu to indicate otherwise). The beef broth was also kind of bland despite being overwhelmed by an MSG-y taste that generally just left me parched and dehydrated for the rest of the day.  \n\nI came here looking to satisfy my weekly pho craving, and I definitely left feeling like this didn't meet my expectations at all.  The flavorlessness of the soup base really reduced or washed out the flavor of the meat, and the wide noodles were just really soft and unimpressive.  The only pro was that it was a relatively large helping of noodles, so quantity-wise it would have been worth it if i enjoyed that type of noodle.  Unfortunately, with Pho 2000 conveniently next door, I wouldn't bother to give this a 2nd chance.", "author": "Kathy T."}

Anyways, I was hungry so down I sat. \n\nWent with the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and crispy spring rolls). This is an extremely popular southern vietnamese lunchtime staple found all over Sai Gon. I've eaten it countless times in Viet Nam and when done right- it's incredible. Many times it's just so-so. Kinda like Pad Thai or Chow Fun- a good barometer of the kitchen's competence.\n\nHere at golden lotus they did everything right.\n\nMeat: Properly charred & caramelized slices of grilled pork with just enough lemongrass fragrance.\n\nVeggies- Good amount of shredded carrots, cucumber, lettuce, and bean sprouts in relation to the amount of Bun (noodles) provided.\n\nFried Spring roll- Crispy & well seasoned. Does it's job by adding texture and richness.\n\nFish sauce- Just sweet enough, although I would have liked to add some more chili to the concoction- and wasn't about to ruin my bowl with the provided table side Sriracha.\n\nPortion size was ample without being Amuricun obnoxious large.

I was shocked to see an African American waitress at this very authentic Vietnamese restaurant.  The owners must be progressive as it is rare to see this.  Clean, warm service and great food. We've been twice already.", "author": "Laurence H."}

They way I like it.\n\nBig time points for being CLEAN which is pretty rare sometimes in theTL.\n\nDidn't try anything else but peeked around and it looks good also.\n\nGood stuff all around.", "author": "Richard W."}

I live in San Jose and tried many Pho places but the quality of beef can never be compare with Golden Lotus quality.  The beef they used is so good that it's like butter that melts in your mouth.  The price was average like other pho place even though their quality of meats are way finer than other pho places.  The service i thought was better than other pho place.  Friendly smile and check up on water was on point.  Will definitely come back again.", "author": "Aaron W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-09", "description": "Average. I ordered the combination Pho and the Bahn Xeo. The Pho was not what I expected it had thick rice noodles that I didn't particularly enjoy but the broth was OK. The Bahn Xeo had NO FLAVOR it didn't have that fragrant smell that I had expected and it was just tasteless as I had to add a lot of hot and sweet sauce.", "author": "N A."}
