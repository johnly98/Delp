Sunday early afternoon (National Dog Day!) and we found a spot in the lot, no problem. Because it's primarily used for people with their dogs, I don't think people park it here for the day like they may in other locations. And it was beautiful - full blue sky and 65+ degrees. That's heaven in SF. \n\nThe steps down and back up are a little steep, but just take your time. Once on the beach, the free-range running and opportunity for doggie playmates abounds. Plus there's the water. Honestly our 4-year-old mix (mix of what? who knows?) had not really run out into the ocean...only small riverbeds.  But she took to it like a fish. Plus, when she made friends with another dog whose owner was throwing a stick in the water, she happily followed him out into swim territory (just barely - don't freak - not near the waves or anything). \n\nThe only thing that was strange was so many jellyfish washed up (I think they were jellyfish??) and several dead birds (a couple of whole, and several entire wing-spans). No idea how they happened. Oh, and the horses that came along and pooped on the beach. I believe I'm the only person bothered by the fact that horse owners don't have to pick up the poop (and on trails, as well) because everyone says \"oh - it's natural.\" Sure, but I still don't want my dog eating horse poop (which she did) and I don't want to step in it either.\n\nI digress. The wind was perfect to watch the hang-gliders and it wasn't crowded AT ALL. Tip for wash-off post-beach: take a large water bottle to fill a couple of times, as they have a bottle fill as part of the drinking fountain in the parking lot. Pour it over your dog with fresh water to get the sand off their face and paws for the ride home.\n\nLove love love this place and will return often!", "author": "Laurie H."}

I wasn't sure what to expect but I was totally down for exploring. We took an uber to the parking lot and walked through the sand and dunes to a point where you could take a small hike down to the shore. This is when I started to notice some doggies playing and walking with their people families. Once we got down to the shore I noticed even more pups and that's when my friend let me know that this beach is known as being a dog beach! I saw so many cute dogs living their best life. This was the best surprise!\n\nBeing an early Friday afternoon, it wasn't too packed and we were able to lay out, relax, and have some awesome one on one girl time.

It feels different walking here without you. With watery eyes and a heavy heart, we followed our steps we took a thousand times and felt your presence beside us.\n\nI remember the first time we were here like it was just yesterday. You were just a rambunctious puppy getting into mischief, getting chased by the older dogs, getting bullied, digging into the sand, sniffing everything in site and trying to put everything in your mouth. But eventually you learned how to play and behave like the other dogs and pretty soon, you were the big dog teaching the other pups how to behave. \n\nWe didn't have a ball then, but we played fetch with those branches that were even longer than you without a care in the world. You enjoyed every moment and showed me how to enjoy it, too. But then when we eventually got you a ball, we probably lost a dozen of them swallowed up by the park. Yup, this was our Bermuda Triangle of balls that kept disappearing. \n\nYou jumped into the wave head on and probably shocked the heck out of you. But you're a water dog, so you got the hang of it real quick. Running at full sprint at the beach made me grin from ear to ear knowing full well you loved to show off. Sure you weren't the fastest, but in my eyes you were the supersonic dog going full blast on the sand as the grains shifts under your paws as they get lifted in the air like slow motion. \n\nYour stunning gait and weird, sideway dash made you look like you were going to tip over when you ran at full speed, which was both a mystery and a joy to watch. You also broke your paw here as we had to put you in a cast, in which you kept chewing and gnawing off. Such a silly and stubborn girl you always were. \n\nAs we covered every inch of the path we took so many times, I can see you on every bend in every stage of your life. I see snapshots of wonderful moments we experienced that I would give a million bucks to relieve over and over again. \n\nThis was more than a park as we spent countless of hours here on my weekends and days off. These were some of the best times I spent, and it didn't cost me a darn thing. Well, maybe a dozen or so balls, but who's counting. \n\nAs we ended our trip and gazed at the view of your favorite spot, this will always be a part of you and expect me to take you on our next stroll like we did a thousand times over. \n\nI love you, Maxie. \n\nFebruary 16, 2006 - August 4, 2018\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7nIgf_uU1CU", "author": "John G."}

Everyone here had a dog (or several). I was impressed at how well-behaved the dogs were and my pup made a few friends. \n\nFirst, what to expect / what to wear - it's a beach, but it's more like a hike, so dress appropriately! Athleisure is perfect, and comfortable sneakers. Also, make sure to bundle up, because even in the summer it's cold and WINDY. Sunglasses are a must to protect your eyes from the sand and wind. \n\nNow, getting there / parking - just put Fort Funston in your GPS or google maps and you'll find it easily. Arrived at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning and discovered that parking surprisingly isn't an issue because there's a huge parking lot. Even when we left an hour later there were still a lot of spots available.\n\nBathrooms - the only bathrooms I saw were porta potties at the large parking lot, so plan accordingly to avoid having to use these. \n\nThe main trail is paved and easy to navigate. There's lots of side trails too if you want to explore, and a steep slope down to a beach as well. Plenty of water fountains and bowls for your pup, but we brought our own too. Lots of dogs off-leash, but kept mine on a leash because he's an escape artist, and he still had a great time.\n\nIf you're hungry after, west lake center has some dog-friendly eating options like blue line pizza, and is only 5 minutes away.

I wore flip flops and I was worried about trekking up and down a sandy hill. Not ideal. We didn't get end up going down to the beach. Too steep for flip flops.\n\n-super windy here so dress accordingly. Came in booty shorts and almost froze my a** off because it was cold.

Solution: Fort Funston to the rescue!\n\nAlthough a ways away from downtown, it's absolutely worth the ride over. I came a bit before sunset and was greeted by dogs roaming about, off leash. Dogs on leashes in the city generally look curious enough, but all the dogs here looked ecstatic! They were all too busy sniffing things and playing chase with one another to really even give any hoomans much heed. \n\nThere's about a 20 minute walk that leads down to the beach. The path itself is clean and well kept-- surprising given the density of dogs here. Then there's an extremely steep downhill walk to the beach (bring your sturdy walking shoes, the walk back up is pretty strenuous). The sandstone cliffs are majestic and beautiful. The beach itself is not one for sitting given the sand fleas, but it's great for watching pups frolick in the ocean.\n\nA corgi I met pulled a bait and switch on me by coming up all friendly, wiping its nose, then running away!

There's some paved trails in the midst of sand dunes (so watch out, doggie will come home sandy), cliffs with ocean views, eucalyptus groves, and military structures. It's not a particularly long walk There are water fountains for the dogs in case you forgot your water, and a few picnic tables for resting. For the most part, everyone's dog is off leash here so expect socializing and playful romps. Between the great views, sprawling space and doggie friends, it's a wonderful place to get your dogs some fresh air. \n\nRelatively clean for a place mostly for dogs. People are pretty respectful about picking up and keeping the place poop-free. BYO bags since it doesn't look like there are bag dispensers anywhere in the park.   \n\nThe park has two places to park -- a small strip (few spots) along the highway and a main lot. Parking hasn't been a problem even on the weekends. \n\nMain gripe is the lack of fencing around it so I guess in theory your dog could run off here if not under tight voice control / has bad recall skills. We didn't let our dog run around off leash here until I established recall skills in a fenced in dog park. Some trails run close to the parking lot so you might want to leash up before your dog gets too close to car traffic. Also, the place can get hella cold even in the summer (paragliding happens nearby to give you an idea of how windy it can get, even in July).

We got our puppy in April 2017 and that's all we've been hearing about. \"Go to Fort Funston! Have you been to Fort Funston yet?\" Since my boyfriend and I live near the San Francisco Caltrain station without a car, you can imagine the difficulty of covering the back seat of a Lyft ride and praying that we make it to the beach without getting kicked out. But alas, we made it.\n\nOz (our Siberian Husky puppy) gets excited at the beach. All he wants to do is dig in the sand and chase down other dogs. Because of that, I would recommend that your dog has decent recall before bringing him here and letting him off leash. There are some owners who get nutty about random dogs approaching theirs... even though it's an off leash public area. Ugh.\n\nWe brought Oz to an area of Fort Funston where he wouldn't be able to run up any cliffs and away from us. Great place to play fetch, though unfortunately Oz doesn't like fetch. He just likes to make friends and splash around in the water. He always has a great time in the cold, while my boyfriend and I are freezing our butts off, so don't forget to bring an extra layer while you're waiting for your furry companion to get tired out.\n\nWe'll definitely come to Fort Funston every once in awhile, especially for doggie Meetups, though there are a few other dog parks we'd like to visit in the meantime. It's not my favorite place to go, especially because I'm generally not a huge fan of the beach, but on a beautiful and sunny San Francisco day, it's hard to resist the idea of hitting the sand and watching your happy dog run around for a few hours.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

This is a great place for taking a walk with or without a dog. You can spend the entire day here (or at least a few hours). \n\nThere's a parking lot, which is nice. But I normally park on the side of the road off of HWY 35. \n\nThere's an upper paved area where you can walk in a big circle, then there's a huge beach area underneath. Tons of dogs and people everywhere, but it never feels crowded here because this place is so huge. \n\nMy two favorite things about this place: 1) This place is open and vast so dogs don't tend to fight each other, as there's no pent-up energy in a small confined space, unlike a typical dog park. 2) I love walking along the ocean! It is so beautiful here. You can really walk a very long distance along the beach. I've never been able to \"finish\" it. \n\nOf course if your dog doesn't have good recall, you'll probably have to use a long leash. It probably also takes some getting used to for the dog. I first took my puppy here when he was 5 months old and he was scared and overwhelmed, even on a leash, because it could be quite a far distance to walk with the noisy ocean and there are so many other dogs running around. But now he loves it! It's a great place to use the chuck-it stick. \n\nAlso, the ascend and descent to the beach from the upper paved part can be quite steep and strenuous for some. It also gets cold and windy, so always wear a jacket.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

My boyfriend (who's from Seattle) has noted it seems like you can't take your dog anywhere in the Bay Area, and he's especially right considering all the new regulations being proposed for off-leash dog spaces in San Francisco. So now more than ever, Fort Funston is the best place to hang out with your dog and let them enjoy some off-leash time outdoors.\n\nTONS of grassy and sandy space so it's easy on your pup's feet and joints. Even if I wasn't a dog owner I'd still come to 1) PLAY WITH ALL THE DOGS 2) enjoy the scenery! It's right by the beach and when the sun's out it's absolutely gorgeous. You'll see hang gliders at the end of the beach by the parking lot, and there's tons of space to sit down and hang out on the sand. You can walk down the hill to get to the ocean, and the walk back up is a considerable workout. \n\nBonus points for the huge parking lot too!", "author": "Angela L."}

If you're open to dogs off leash and probably going to run up to you, then this is the place for you.  Fort Funston is an alternative for people who want to take a stroll along the Cali coast with their dogs, without being too close to the water (though you can still access the beach a couple miles in).  Fort Funston is a very scenic park with a marked path and has a lot of sand paths so be prepared!  \n\nI usually run the sand hills for a great challenging workout. Instead of using the wooden man-made steps on the sand incline, try running on the sides and getting a good pump in.  I love that Fort Funston is super versatile where you'll occasionally see hang gliders preparing for take off at the edge of the cliff, runners, families, dog owners, and casual walkers/hikers.  There is also a huge parking lot for visitors! Definitely visit if you need a breath of fresh air or want to see all the cute friendly dogs running around.", "author": "Tiffany Z."}

He's currently passed out on the floor in a deep slumber.\n\nA word of caution, probably not the best place if your dog gets nervous around other dogs or is not well-socialized as there will be plenty of random dogs running up to you.\n\nI'm a fan of letting your dogs be off-leash but dog owners, seriously can you at least stay near your dog and don't let them wander out of your sight??  My puppy is very friendly but still learning how to socialize so I keep him on leash for this reason. Most of the dogs we met were very friendly but I still get nervous when several dogs start sprinting towards my puppy at full speed without any owners in sight.  One dog owner reassured me that his dog was friendly when the dog ran up but the dog started barking and snapping at my puppy, causing me to have to yank back my dog forcefully. Not cool dude. Another dog followed us on the trail for a good 20-30 minutes and we had no clue where his owner was.

It's a beach, an amazing series of path and off-path hiking trails, a dog park, and an interesting place to explore. There's plenty to do and see here at this abandoned military base. \n\nIf you like dogs, or perhaps can't have one at the moment because your feisty feline is a self-proclaimed only child, then this, my friend, is the place for you! Dogs, dogs, as far as the eye can see, and most leashed properly, excepting on the beach where they can play in the surf. Big dogs, little dogs, medium dogs, fuzzy dogs, skinny dogs all running around enjoying themselves, playing in the waves, fetching things, rolling in various dead items, and enjoying FREEDOM. I was in heaven. \n\nThe path down to the beach is steep and quite a workout to hike back up, just to warn you. The one we found was one of two *recommended* ways to get down to the waves. Although there are many off path places to explore, I would advise using caution around the cliffs. They are steep and unstable, according to terrifying signage placed for the stupid that surround us. \n\nOther than copious canine interactions, my other favorite part of visiting this place was the history. Fort Funston still has plenty of now defunct military installations ripe for exploring, or climbing and tagging, for some... Mortar Batteries still line the trails. You can read about it here:\nhttp://www.militarymuseum.org/FtFunston.html\n\nI found it very depressing that the dunes were once covered in wildflowers and abundant wildlife, which was steamrolled to build the base, but WWII was no easy time to live through. It seems they're working hard to bring back the ecosystem that once thrived here, and that was wonderful to read about on various informational postings. \n\nDid I mention that parking is free, and that there are plenty of water fountains and Port o Squats available?

And your trip starts off great with free parking (rarely is it full). And you know you're at Fort Funston with as soon as you leave your car (or bike or whatever transportation), and you hear a mix of barks from dogs of all sizes and types. Energetic barks fill the air with happiness--it sure is palpable and you're excited.\n\nWhat I love most about Fort Funston is that you feel like you're away from the hectic city life. Peer out into the horizon across the Pacific ocean, and you might spot the end of the Earth. Pop down by the succulents, read a book, and enjoy life with a view. If you feeling like you need to move, hike alongside the cliff (it's safe) or head down towards the beach. \n\nMy only hope is that this place continues to be a bit out of the way for most and doesn't too crowded...for the sake of all the dogs...", "author": "David W."}

I grabbed onto her and screamed for the owner to get her dog off of ours before the owner was finally able to get the dog to stop.\n\nI thought I had checked her thoroughly at the time but the blood did not show up yet, I looked through her fur many times and felt around and she did not whimper or cry but she is so fluffy that we did not see where it broke through the skin and the owner just kept apologizing saying her dog was still a puppy and did not realize its strength .. if only I knew it broke through the skin we could have at least gotten their information down and checked if their dog had all the shots!! Or they could have been responsible owners and do more than just apologize, like go with us to the Vet to make sure nothing was wrong! \n\nMy toddler was freaked out and kept asking what was wrong with our dog Poppy, I was so upset but did not want to show more than I already did which would scare my daughter more than she was already. We were just SO grateful that it did not seem like she was hurt but we should have done more. Now we have to contact the Vet tomorrow and we have no information we can give them about the other dog's vaccinations or any medical concerns that might be transferable, and take time off to get her checked etc.\n\n\nIf anyone knows this owner please forward this along to her, they need to know that it was not just puppy play, it was real aggression that led to another dog's injuries. Please keep your untrained dogs leashed! It could have been much much worse. I just hope everything is fine at the vet and there's no more injuries that we can not see.  \n\nIf this happens again to anyone else please get the other persons information down or go to the vet with them right away. I wish we knew more about the other dog's medical history.", "author": "Helen H."}

I'm young-ish, and I can't imagine someone older, overweight, with joint pain, or anyone out of shape getting down and up to the beach. Going down was easier but not totally for the faint of heart, but going up was a cardiovascular challenge.\n\n- No clear directions posted. There are multiple parking lots, multiples trails, and within the trails, there are multiple forks in the road. It's not obvious how to get to the beach. \n\n- Dogs galloping. People come here for the off leash nature. I have a Samoyed though so she can't be off leash until she gets to the beach. So it's a bit annoying to have dogs galloping towards you at breakneck speed\n\nCome here if you have ample time on your hands and don't mind an adventure.

In fact, I'm more of a cat person.

It's a bit hard to get to for a downtown dweller like me, I took the M to Stonestown and then the 18 will drop you off right by.\nI took a little hike and found myself in this beautiful scenic environment.\n\nSand. Sand everywhere. In your hair, eyes, lips, purse, and tiny crevice and crack to be seen. It gets windy here! The sand ca sting sometimes so wear leayers and bring a towel or something.\n\nThe wind is also unusual because it is the cause behind the changing landscape every week. I was sitting down on this sloping hill the first time I was here. The 2nd time? That beautiful slope was gone and is now this terrifying cliff drop. Whoa.\n\nOnce you hike down to the edge of the water, the wind dies a little bit and it's nice to walk. The sand isn't very clean and there's a lot of washed up sea creatures and the shells of old crabs and such. Not very pleasant, but hey it's the ocean.\n\nYou'll notice the abandoned remains of bunkers from time past. Bunkers where they use to camp out and watch for intruders in the sky. Pointing their guns into the air just waiting for days on end for something to happen, but hoping nothing does. Now the large concrete bases have fallen from the cliffs onto the sand below into their final resting place-until the waves will eventually wash them out into the ocean forever.\n\nHistorical, windy, hilly, isolated, and full of puppies.

Nice views but expect overcast, windy conditions as a norm.  You can surf here if you're not afraid of the freezing water.  If you're a dog owner, you flock there bc it's the one beach that allows off leash dogs.  The ratio of people to dogs is easily 1:1 at Fort Funston.  Could be a good place to bring the family and dogs.  \n\nHowever, I feel that those dog owners who do not practice common etiquette diminish the overall experience at Fort Funston.  I'm a dog lover but I do not love irresponsible dog owners.  I always notice that some people do not pick up after their dogs there.  Also, just bc this is an off leash beach, it does not mean you cannot leash your dog (especially those who need to).  Today, there were some little yappy dogs that tried to attack any person that would walk within a 40 ft vicinity of their owner.  Dumb dog owner - please leash your dogs.  I also witnessed a few dogs that got into a fight and the owners were pulling them off of each other.  Somehow one of the owners ended up falling down in the sand dunes.  Again, if you have an aggressive dog, do not let it go unleashed.  \n\nOverall, there are better beaches to visit in SF especially if you want a little more peace and quiet.

Lots of walking paths, sand mounds, water, etc. etc. I especially love the sand mounds because when my dog climbs to the top of it, it's like Lion King!

I say just be careful of what your dog starts sniffing.. gross gross bird feathers. \n\nI love coming here because everyone here is dog lovers! So no one will walk around your dog or anything. It's nice! I don't have a scary dog, but the social norms of having a german shepherd I guess. Here though, no one cares! \n\nYou meet a lot of dog walkers here. (: They're all really nice and friendly and know a lot about dogs. So it's nice to have people to talk to about your dogs. Though... one time I met a dog walker who was pretty mean and basically told my friend that he's training his dog all wrong. pshhh. \n\nBut just remember to pack a towel in the car and pat your dog down before he or she gets in. My car is still has sand even after a pat down. Haha.  Oh well!

The beach is clean for the most part, no dog poo left anywhere, not much trash or litter around.

Gets a bit crowded in the afternoon so you might need to circle around for a bit. Watch out for offleash dogs in the parking lot!\n\n+ Make sure you bring poop bags! You'll also be holding onto the poops for a while since there are no trash cans on the beach.\n\n+ Bring water for your pups! My two dogs got so thirsty right when they got to the beach (probably also from being silly dogs and trying to drink sea water, bleh!) They slurped up half a bottle of water right away.\n\n+ Watch out for horses! (And horse poo, lol, dogs love that stuff.) They get spooked when dogs follow them so make sure you call your dogs off, even if they're just curious about the strange giant beast with a human on top.\n\n+ The path we took today had some pretty steep stairs that made getting down to the beach super easy, but going back up was a different story!

THE ASIAN MALE CARRIES AROUND A KNIFE AND IF HE EVEN DARES SEES YOUR DOG CHASING HIS, HE WON'T BE AFRAID TO USE HIS WEAPON!!\n\nI was recently involved in a traumatizing experience, here at Fort Funston.\n\nI brought my pit bulls to the park, just like any other day (Mind you, I am a local and have been coming to Fort Funston for the past 3 1/2 years).\n\nA man's dog kept snapping at my pit bull. My dog has a very good temperament so, while he was being tested he remained calm. The other dog bit at my dogs nose/face area and my dog began to chase after his dog, for what was done. When the owner saw that my dog was going  after his, he held my dog down and began to stab him, about 5 to 6 times with a knife.\n\nAt first I thought the owner had been punching my dog, until I came close and saw a massive amount of blood gushing from my dogs shoulder/back area. I yelled to the onlookers to help and desperately pleaded for them to call 911. Once the owner and his girlfriend heard that, they fled.\n\nThe police came and I pleaded for them to help. Although they called in for park rangers to come down, they informed me that they couldn't help because Fort Funston is on federal ground - so, I couldn't even file a police report! They also said that they weren't supposed to respond to the call, but because a handful of calls came in about the same incident, they showed up for the circumstance.\n\nThe park rangers showed up and called Animal Control to transport my dog to the emergency. My dog was the victim here, and I wasn't shown any sympathy! The officer told me that I should expect what happened, to happen. How dare he? I'm supposed to expect dog owners to pull out weapons on dogs? My dog wears a choke collar; the owner of the other dog could have easily choked my dog, lie him on his side, pin him down, etc. But instead? He stabbed my dog, almost killing him.\n\nMy dog underwent surgery yesterday. His wound was 4 inches wide and 4 1/2 inches deep; a half an inch more, and it would have hit his spine, which could have resulted in paralyzing him from the shoulders down, or worst, killed him.\n\nWe always hear stories about pit bulls attacking other dogs and the media has done an amazing job exaggerating a bad rep for them. Yet, what about all the stories where wrongness is being done to the amazing breed as the pit bull. \n\nI was lucky. And I am so grateful to everyone who has supported my dog and I through this experience. But more thankful, to still have my pitty baby still in my life.  Sympathy from the officers of San Francisco was neglected, as well as the Park Rangers. But please believe me when I say, if this incident would have happened to another breed - I guarantee you, other measures would have taken place. I'm not trying to pull the dog breed race card here, but come on, seriously?\n\nNever will I ever go back to Fort Funston! An innocent dog was harmed because of another man's ignorance.\n\nAGAIN: WATCH OUT FOR AN ASIAN COUPLE.

And while Mila is running around, we humans get to soak in the amazing ocean views, feel the sea breeze on our skin, and walk peacefully along the sandy beach. It really doesn't get better than this!\n\nA few tips for newbies:\n-Come early. The parking lot gets pretty full the closer you get to noon so come early to avoid the crowds.\n-Picnicking. If you're thinking about picnicking, only do so if its warm and be careful of doggie visitors who'll want a bite of your food.\n-Wear layers. It gets foggy & cold in this part of SF so its always a good idea to wear layers to stay warm.\n-Bring towels. Your dog will get wet and dirty, towels help minimize how much of it gets in your car.\n-Schedule a bath afterwards.

Bring your dog here! \n\nYou can smell the sea, watch the sun set and get a good workout from climbing back up the trail that goes to the beach! Not to mention how happy you would make your dog by taking them here. \n\nPiece of advice; beware of untrained toy/small dogs. People think it's cute when they bark and try to attack other dogs, that's why they rarely correct the behaviour. But when they provoke your 60lbs shepherd, all of a sudden it's your fault for having a big dog that is just trying to protect itself. So please, if your dogs don't know how to play friendly or is just full on picking fights with every other dog in the park, leash him/her for the good of every other dog and their owners. When you come to this park, you can see that the breeds that have the WORST reputation are actually the ones that are most well-behaved. And the walking mop breeds are usually the one with no manners. \n\nThough I rarely see any of them at the park, I think people who gets mad when a dog tries to interact with them is a little bit mad.

The parking lot is huge, so one would almost always immediately find a parking spot.\n\nAt one end of the parking lot, there is an observation deck from where we caught a beautiful sight of the Philip Burton beach in front of us, Thornton beach to the left, Mussel Rock to the far left and San Francisco coast to the right stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\nThe North American and Pacific plates of the earth's crust collide off the Fort Funston coast forming the San Andreas Fault, which has cleaved mountains and volcanoes. The Mussel Rock to the far left is the place where the San Andreas Fault leaves the land and runs into the ocean.\n\nWe started our hike on the Sunset Trail along the coast that took us through the featured sand dunes. Soon we reached Battery Davis that was constructed in 1936 to hold two 16-inch guns to protect the Pacific Coast during wartime. \n\nAs we continued onto the Sunset Trail, we took the detour to the beach access. It was fun watching the dogs having a blast in the wave friendly beach. It did get me into some serious thinking about raising a dog!\n\nThe Sunset Trail connected with the Coastal Trail, which soon connected with the Horse Trail running parallel to the Coastal Trail. From the Horse Trail, which looked secluded and well-shaded, one can see the busy Skyline Boulevard and Lake Merced next to it. Soon, the trail took us directly to the main parking lot. The hike did satiate our wish to go on a mild hike to see some beautiful views.", "author": "Anu M."}

You may explore the woods which reminds me of a little forest. You can also run them up & down the high sand hills. You can simply take them on a walk down the trail.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-28", "description": "One of my absolute favorite places in San Francisco. There are two entrances, both with parking. One takes you directly to the top level, the other is from Lake Merced and involves a short, sandy hike up log steps followed by about five to ten minutes of trails (depending on your route) before you reach the top level. There are dogs everywhere, and it's paradise for anyone else who loves them. You will see labradors, beagles, chihuahuas, yorkies, poodles, huge lion-like mutts, everything! \n\nThere are trees everywhere and a good mix of sandy paths and concrete paths that are very comfortable before you reach the top level. At the top level, you'll find sprawling sand dunes stretching out before a beautiful view of endless ocean. On a good day, you'll have warm sun and nice breeze, blooming flowers, and hang gliders swooping and tumbling through the sky. \n\nAfter you follow the path along the sand dunes, you'll eventually reach a kind of wooden look out platform. There you can look down on the beach and watch the waves and people with their dogs and families or look up to see the ocean and hang gliders. You can even watch hang gliders launch themselves off the side of the hill into the air. \n\nFor all the history junkies, you can wander around the dunes and explore the old military stations embedded in the cliffside. These landmarks were meant for triangulating incoming enemy ships and have lots of really cool information. You can climb on them and imagine what it was like to live in them. :)\n\nI really recommend coming here to relax and clear your mind and just enjoy everything that's beautiful around you. Remember to slow down though! If you move quickly, there won't seem to be much more than dogs and sand, but if you take your time and just breathe it all in, Fort Funston is really lovely.", "author": "Grace T."}

The ocean? Perhaps the beautiful stretches of beach, or the flourishing foliage. What, you don't like the hordes of happy dogs? Fort Funston National Park is gorgeous. It's a reminder that SF is right on the ocean, despite the cool, foggy days. The ripples on the sand dunes mimic the ocean, and it's hard not to want to roll down them like a 10 year old (which I actually witnessed in action). Don't come here if you don't want a wayward dog to lick your hand or sniff your... knee. Everyone's really friendly, people and animals alike!\n\nThe pathways wend and wind in a big loop with offshoots leading to the beach.

If you have only one small to medium dog that can't defend itself and you, you may really not enjoy it. The place is teeming with large off-leash dogs galloping around, looking like they'd like to sink their teeth into something (like you or Fido!), not to mention overloaded novice dogwalkers trying to  sheepherd mobs of hyper dogs.  Oh, and how about the doo doo from all the walkers who don't bother picking up after their pets...oh so nice!\n\nSuch a shame.  In a more civilized era, I suppose people used to take peaceful walks admiring the beauty of the place.  With Thornton Beach trails no longer open, this is the next logical spot for walks and views but unless you have a pit bull or anti-dog device, you're kind of in danger because the owners don't do much to control their dogs - many unattended dogs beelined over to me from nowheres as I tried to walk.  I don't think the self-centered owners are going to be too cut up when their precious take a chomp out of one of the humans or dogs it encounters.

As soon as you get down to the beach, the wind will be much calmer & you have a few miles to stretch your legs & let your pooch romp to his heart's content.

I was worried about crowding and there are tons of dogs here but it's so big and open, there is no stress. I've been to parks where all of the dogs are on edge because they are in such a small enclosed space and there was not a hint of that here. I didn't see a single dog fight or scuffle, just a lot of happy people and dogs. We got a big lost trying to find the beach access but made it eventually. It's pretty sandy so dress appropriately. You do have to go down a slightly steep hill of sand to get down to the beach which isn't the most fun to walk up, but it's still worth it to get down to the ocean. My dog had just as much fun running around on the paths as down by the ocean, so you don't even have to climb down there to have a good time.\n\nIn summary, like everyone says, this place is amazing. If you have a dog, it's a crime to not take them here. I can't wait to drag my roommates and their puppies here soon.", "author": "Christine H."}

I, living in Santa Clara, thought I would escape the heat by checking out Forst Funston with my dog. Boy was I wrong, it was about 90 degrees at 11 in the morning! And for the first time ever I was sweating at the beach! IT was eerie. \n\nAlthough the walk felt more like a hike, possibly do to my shoes and the weather , I enjoyed every minute of our Funston visit. From the Golden Gate views in the unpredictable clear skies, to the very friendly dogs frolicking in the ocean.\n\nMy dog actually got in the water! He usually runs from waves but this time he dove right in and paddled to get his ball and even chased other dogs in. \n\nI was pleased to find a very pet friendly path to the beach. Doggies were happily running around all over the place and would run up to greet us. My dog was on excellent behavior off leash, but if you worry about your dog snapping or running off I would keep him on leash when walking the path to the ocean.\n\nThere was a water station half way their surrounded by silver doggy water bowls and about three fountains attached to a wooden post. \nI think they should install more though, it was not enough for all the dogs there that day. I also wish they would build a restroom instead of having a porta potty, for obvious reasons. \n\nOnce arriving at the shore, our hot ,what seemed like a long, walk, was worth it. The beach was very clean and the waves were perfect for dog paddling. Not very strong or frequent, just a steady, smooth, and cool rhythm. It was so hot that I got in the water myself, along with my relieved pup. \n\nThe people were friendly and were pretty vigilant as far as watching their dogs. This really is doggy  heaven and I am for sure going to be taking my dog back.\n\nThe walk back was really nice too, I could see Lake Merced, this brought back tons of memories from when I lived right across the street from the runners paradise lake. \n\nI had no problem with parking because it was a weekday,although it was pretty busy. I recommend parking near the port a potties because there is a nice little overlook where you can get a great view of the ocean crashing in to the cliffs.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Oh well, I guess I always gotta be different (but then, that goes with being a Christian in the Bay Area, eh?).\n\nNot that I didn't have the chance;  when I got married, I also inherited my wife's Australian Shepherd.  This dog *hated* other dogs, though, and would go into attack mode when she saw other dogs.  She would have died of a heart attack here, there are so many dogs here.\n\nObviously, I didn't come here for the canines.  Instead, it's a nice coastal park that's part of the GGNRA.  Nice view of the beach and ocean, when the fog isn't there.  Coastal vegetation that's probably unique to this part of the California coast.  Gliders.  Old bunkers and batteries from the war days.  And it spreads north a long way.\n\nCons:  Typical weather for this part of the coast, windy and cold.  Remote corner of San Francisco;  no problem with a car, but you can't walk there from your apartment in only a few minutes.  Can get lots of use on the weekends.\n\nBasically, it may or may not be worth the trip out here for you.  It's not for me, living in the East Bay like I do, but I still like it.

Strange dogs and their strange dog poop,  much like strange kids are appreciated AT A DISTANCE and should not be allowed to slobber on people, scratch people ( some woman's unruly dog scraped the crap out of my leg once) or gnaw on people's ankles. Fort Funston is NOT exclusively for dog owners it is a recreation area for many different types of folks from hang gliders and para-sailers to equestrians and yet it seems that the dog people think it belongs to them.  The dog owners are militant there and from what I understand from several conversations I am not the only one irked by their canine anarchist collective. \n\nJust last week I did get a good laugh from some signs that say \"There is no Poop Fairy, pick up after your dog\".

On a Saturday or a Sunday you're looking at a huge, huge doggie party, probably over 100 dogs or so. If you get bored of a paved trail, you can go on off road terrain hikes and of course, walk down to the beach. At the beach, I witnessed 1 of the most touching memories I've ever experienced with my boy. After a year and a half of being completely fearful of water, my boy finally broke his phobia. He made a great friend who wanted to play a little tag and lead my boy right into that beautiful Pacific Ocean. They both continued to run around, drenched with the biggest smiles of all time. I will never forget that. Thank you Fort Funston!", "author": "Patrick O."}

Little ol' Brimley was panting up the sunny climbs today and we had to take a few rests in the shade.  Got him to wade in the water with some of the bigger dogs, but he (wisely) didn't want to go in too far - the surf was strong and the aforementioned short-nosedness doesn't make a Brussels the best swimmer.\n\nThe abundance of professional dog walkers walking huge dog packs is a little off-putting too, during the week.  Contrast this to, say, Point Isobel in Richmond, and it's an interesting demographic indicator.  Lots of rich San Franciscans with little time and space to spend with their own animals hire dog walkers.  (also, big dogs in smaller spaces need walkers)  At Pt. Isobel, sure, there are dog walkers, but most people are just out for a walk with their own pups, even midday on a weekday.  More space, more time, less money to spend on dog walkers in the East Bay.\n\nI mention this in part because a condo-living dog owner walking a small dog in Emeryville stoppped me the other morning and asked me how often I walk my dog.  They didn't have a back yard, were afraid to walk their dog at night, and it was an older dog who probably had bladder issues.  I said \"about 3 times a day - morning, at lunch, and at night, and oh, he gets let out into the backyard late at night\".  The dog also got taken to doggy day care.  It truly helps to have space and time for a dog, although our little guy could use a little more socialization.\n\nGo to Funston by all means whenever you get a chance with your little pup, just keep some water handy for the small short-nosed toy breeds, they need it!", "author": "Joe B."}

Visiting for the first time with A made it all the better.\n\nIt has a huge parking lot, but on beautiful Sundays, definitely try to get there early because it really does fill up.

They'd probably be parking along the freeway later on in the day at the rate the spots were going.\n\nIt was really cool seeing the old WWII batteries and imagining the soldiers stuck in there searching for enemy warships.\n\nWe also walked along the beach and sat for awhile.  I think the amount of dogs outnumbered the amount of people that were there, so if you're not a dog lover, be forewarned.  \n\nThe stairs getting to/from the beach are KILLER.  I suck at stairs.

My and my friend walked around talking shit while his dogs enjoyed walking down the little trails.  \n\nI haven't been back to Fort Funston since then but it being so close, I don't have any excuse. I'll definitely get around to it again.  Just remember to bring your jacket (any self respecting San Franciscan would know to bring a damn jacket) cause it does get windy over here.

They're both well-behaved dogs but very curious...and just small enough for me to lose track of them if they go behind a bush. For this reason, I've pretty much kept them indoors except to go out to do their business and I feel terrible about it.\n\nLast weekend, at the recommendation of a friend of a friend, my roommate and I decided to take our dogs here since none of our dogs have ever been to the beach. As soon as we parked, we saw nothing but happy dogs and happy owners, and that continued for the entire hour we were here.\n\nI had imagined this to be like a human beach (long, flat strip of sand next to the water), just dog-friendly, but that is not the case at all. This beach is full of hills, sand dunes, plants, and partially paved paths for you and your furkids to discover. Only a small area accessed water so you don't have to worry about dirty, wet paws or drowning puppies. All the dogs were well-behaved (mostly unleashed) and all the owners were friendly and happy to introduce their furbabies to yours. There certainly were people there without pets but they were in the vast minority. As a matter of fact, if you come here without pets, you'll feel pretty left out.\n\nLong story short, this is like doggie heaven!

I was expecting nice clean sand like Capitola so I wore flip flops and that was a big mistake! I was getting stabbed left and right by sticks and whatever miscellaneous things in the sand.  Andddd... most of the sand is black!? What's that about? \n\nI'd definitely come back here again but I'll know to wear some shoes!\n\n++I found some whole sanddollars!", "author": "Vicky C."}

My only caution is that the dogs can get a little wild in this great atmosphere, and as a result require more guidance from their humans.  I saw 2 dog 'conflicts' forming, and fortunately they did not escalate.  So, +5 for the dogs, +5 for the nature, and some caution (sorry only a 4) for the humans.

My dog seemed to have a lot of fun, though if your pooch is shy, be warned that dogs are allowed off their leash here. My dog does not get aggressive at all but too many dogs got right up in her face with their humans nowhere in sight, and she was definitely getting overwhelmed. She is very friendly but also a bit timid, which we are working on. It was also difficult for her to be comfortable at the designated water stations/water bowls, because more confident (and some very big) doggies run up off-leash an lap away at the water, all at the same time, sharing the bowl. So if your dog is shy or you are still working on their socialization, it is a good idea to bring some backup water and a bowl in case they are too overwhelmed to share. My dog kept backing up to let everyone else rehydrate. \n  I'd like to see some owners have a little more of an eye on their dogs. Tons of owners do, but this is dog central, and many don't. I get that it's a real treat to have your pet run around and be free but there were some so far away from their owners, you had no idea who they belonged to and their owners would take quite a while to reach them. It's important to be within reach of your dog for their own safety and everyone else's. I personally was not comfortable letting my dog off-leash (12 lb terrier) until we were in a secluded area a ways away from the cliff edges. I usually let her off-leash when on a flat beach, but the beach here is more of a mud beach, not sand you can lay your blanket out on. Kind of a bummer, but there is plenty of sand up on the cliffs for you to pick your own little spot to hang out at. I don't know what other ways there are down to the beach, but we went down the sandy hill... fun going down, strenuous going up (I'm a little outta shape!)

When you look for it on the map, you'll see that it's not at all far from \"civilization,\" but when you are there, it's like you are in a whole separate world. Aside from this, the best part about coming here is watching the hang gliders. I don't think I'd ever have the courage to take off over a cliff, but watching the pros do it so effortlessly makes me feel like I could. \n\nFor those of you with dogs, this is a great place to run your dog.

Here are a few pointers I have found out to make you enjoy the park/beach more.  \nFirst, you will be covered in sand- in places you wouldn't think you could get sand in.  Bring any necessary things (towels, etc.) to make getting home easy and clean.\nSecond, this is the sunset/daly city area so you won't see the sun much (I spent a year in the outer sunset- ah, the year I missed summer!).  So bring a wide arrange of clothes to accommodate.\nThird, a nice tip if you want your dog to go into the water you might want to wear swim trunks and get in their with him/her.  I have seen a few guys doing this and I wish I would have thought of it. \nForth, besides at the top, there aren't any places to get water for your dog so bring some.  I have made this mistake and it won't be repeated (either for her or for me).  \n\nHave Fun!", "author": "Scott J."}

This is Turbo & my favorite hangout on a nice and sunny day.  We love visiting the area because dogs and people are allowed to be carefree and close to nature. Thanks to all the volunteers that participate in frequent group clean-ups, this national park is very well-kept and provides its visitors with a sense of ease and relaxation.  For the most part, visitors with pets are very considerate and do pick up after their dogs. Plastic bags are provided along the path in case dog owners forget to bring their own bags.  \n\nIt's also great that there's something for everyone at Fort Funston... whether it's hiking along the trails... walking along the paved paths... or romping on the beach... everyone that visits Fort Funston seems to have a great time.  It's a very family-oriented place and one of the few places where there's an absolute breath-taking view of both the ocean and the city of SF.", "author": "Vindy C."}

The stairs leading down to the beach is quite a trek and it can be very windy so bring a jacket. All dogs are off leash and the area seems pretty clean with owners picking up their dog's waste. They also offer hang gliding here so that indicates just how windy this area can get. \n\nOnly downside was lack of easily accessible restrooms. Also since it is an \"off leash\" area with many dogs frequenting, there is always a risk that dogs are not behaved or are aggressive. \n\nWe experienced just that when a dog, completely unprovoked by my dog was attacked with 2 puncture wounds requiring emergency vet treatment. The owner still has not accepted responsibility and as all dogs are off leash, the county or animal control cannot do much given the leash law is not being followed. And since the stairs leading off the beach are pretty steep, it was an ordeal to get my injured pet up the stairs and to the ER. \n\nOther than that horrible experience, the dog beach is a great escape and excercise adventure so close to the area.", "author": "Stella C."}

It's a true paradise for dogs of all sizes and breeds, and their owners. Just imagine an enormous scenic area with trails, woods and the ocean beach where you can walk your dog unleashed everywhere. \n\nThere were hundreds of dogs there today, running, and playing, and enjoying freedom, from toy terrier to Great Dane. But the whole area seemed pretty clean, probably because the park was equipped with waste bags and cans, and also water fountains and bowls for our four-paws friends.\n\nFew tips: \n\n- Don't forget to take your warm jacket cause this place is rather windy. \n- There are paved trails in the park but there is still lots of sand around.

Beautiful scenery, lots of nice people, 2 water holes for the dogs to quench their thirst, lots of room for the dogs to run around, access to the beach... My only complaint is all the dog walkers that bring WAY TOO many dogs at a time!  This has become increasingly worse in recent years. It's not only irresponsible, but unfair to the rest of the people that share the park.  They're way less likely to be able to pick up after a dozen dogs, less likely to be able to manage their dogs if something should happen, and are much more likely to lose one of the dogs (as I've seen all of these incidents more than enough times).  \nBUT, it's still pretty much the best doggie park I've been to.", "author": "A T."}

You park on the side of the road, where you see other cars parked, and you start walking up the trail. The hike is a tiny bit strenuous; mostly because my husband hurt his back the week before, and I wasn't very useful at helping to carry anything. At one point, you have to climb down a muddy cliff to get to the beach. \n\nTips: \n1. Bring a beach chair/umbrella \n2. Pack LIGHT. Expect wet dogs to jump all over your blankets if you have them out. \n3. Bring a light lunch/drinks. \n4. Again, lots of wet dogs...don't wear your nicest clothes out here. \n5. Your doggy will come home a sandy, wet, slobbery mess. Prep the car for sand, and get a doggy shower ready right when you get home. \n\nHamlet the little love pug had the time of his life there. First time seeing sand, water, rocks. Everyone there is a dog lover, so it's OK to have your dog off leashed, even during the hike. \n\nThere were NO aggressive dogs out there. Not even one. I hope it stays that way. \n\nHubby is the overbearing, hovering doggy owner, so he had a hard time at first having Hamlet off-leash.

There was so many other dogs on the hike and beach that if you wanted to give your dog a chance to socialize this place would be perfect.

Assuming you are parked at the lot near the Ranger Station and not on Skyline, here are the main walk choices in general level of difficulty.\n- take an easy walk along the flat-ish paved path \n- walk among the sand and ice plant paths on top of the hill.  On either side of the glider take off area\n- walk down the hill to the bottom of the V and come back up\n- walk down the hill to the end, make a right and return through the eucalyptus trees, parallel to Skyline boulevard\n- walk up and down the dunes and in and out  of the woods to your heart's delight\n- walk down to the beach.  Lots of ways to get down to the water, try them all. OK going down.  Steep, sandy climb coming back up after you're tired from walking along the beach and/or throwing the ball.\n\nSince there are no standard paths, so you can mix it up and have a totally different experience every time.\n\nThe weather is very variable.

It's an insult to my nose whenever I try to hike here, shallow breaths are a necessity in order to avoid the gag reflex....Gene A suggested that you remember your plastic poop bags because they are not readily available...ah duh! It's obvious by the smell how many people have no bother to bring poop bags or hike into the scrubs to retrieve the big stinky poo that their dogs have left behind. Gross, gross and gross! \n\nDon't worry dog lovers I'm not trying to insult you I'm talking about some dog lovers with a terrible lack of etiquette.

Since my b/f and I had 2 dogs this Saturday, we decided to visit this spot.  We got there a little uncertain of letting the dogs go off-leash at first.  So we walked them over to the beach access and let them go. \n\nWhat we soon figured out was they loved the freedom!  We had no problems with other dogs and ours stayed in watching distance the whole time.  I was also pleased that the other dogs were well-behaved and played rather than got mean with them.  Couple things to remember: wear tennis shoes, take water, and take a jacket.  there are a bunch of snd dunes with really fine sand but the majority of the area is rocky.  The hikes are really great but long; you will get thirsty.  And even though it was in the 90's in SJ, it was about 58 degrees in the area we were in.\n\nBut I fully recommend it and am excited to take the mutts back!", "author": "Jessica H."}

My shepherd mix and IG put in some serious time at both the beach and our favorite dirt pit,  Fiesta Island.  I have to admit when we put the pooches in the car to start our trek to nor-cal, I was not sure what the future would hold for their beach going lifestyles. I was worrying for nothing....\n\nFort Funston is like Dog Beach on crack. Great trails, expansive beaches and even some great art. This place is everything I have found to be good about the bay area - laid back, thoughtful people who hold pets in high regard and clean up the \"footprint\" all dogs inevitably leave behind, quiet beaches, wildlife filled surf and hiking galore mixed in with colorful history. \n\nDespite the recent security set backs (some wacko brought a knife to the beach), and the somewhat predictably unstable cliffs,  it's a relatively safe and welcome refuge from the daily grind. \n\nI can't believe this place exists.", "author": "Layla M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "I went to Fort Funston a few months ago, which is a giant off-leash dog park and beach area and part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Parks Conservancy. Fort Funston was formally a military outpost and two-gun battery in the mid-20th Century and you can actually see the remains of the battery up close. That was more of an interest to the bf than me or my shiba, Kika, but hey, history is cool :) There were great rolling sand dunes, cliffs, beach access and hiking trails for bikers, hikers and dog owners alike.\n\nI've been wanting to take my dog to another large off-leash dog area since moving up to the Bay Area and Fort Funston was it! There were off-leash dogs everywhere and you could just feel their energy and freedom. The number of dogs almost outnumbered the people there, but I didn't see any dog confrontations at all. They were all too busy sniffing and exploring and running around to bother other dogs, which is great for a dominant dog like our shiba. Kika stayed on-leash for the most part because the bf's overly cautious, but we did let her off leash when we were down on the doggy beach. It was flanked by the cliffs and far away from the roads and parking lot, so Kika was safe to roam off-leash in what we felt was a protected area. She was so happy trotting up and down the beach, and we let her get away with her selective hearing skills. ;) At the end of the day, her face was covered in sand and drool, which I think means a day well spent in her book!  \n\nIt's pretty hard finding off-leash dog parks where I feel confident enough to let my dog wander off-leash too, in terms of the surrounding area and cars or the dispositions of the other dogs.  Fort Funston was very spacious and far away from the highway, and I definitely felt secure letting Kika run around.  The park was big enough to give each dog their own space if they wanted it but enough dogs around if they're looking for doggy company and playmates.  There was also a good amount of trash cans and watering stations to keep doggies hydrated and for poop bags.  Unlike other dog beaches and dog parks, there were very few poop land mines around.  Overall, I thought the dog owners were pretty respectful when it comes to picking up their own dog's doodoo.\n\nFort Funston had with tons of rolling hills, trees, hiking trails and great coastal views to keep dog owners and dogs plenty busy and happy.  I will definitely come back  when the weather's a little nicer.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

So to come to the Dog Beach and watch him run freely is the best thing that makes it ALL worth it! \n\nAs many ppl know, Dachshunds are a bit protective of their owners and thus a little aggressive, but I do my best to train him away from this behavior as much as I can.

My poor puppy didn't fare as well and had lots of bleeding.\n\nI am NOT anti-Pit Bull whatsoever having had three of them in the last 15 years.  However, if you are going to own an aggressive breed at least take the time out to learn how to be a proper owner for this type of animal.

It was doggy paradise! The trail is great with lots of open space, and it's cliffside, so you get a beautiful ocean view. There are also tons of hang gliders in the area which is neat to see. Even with hundreds of dogs and people, it is quite relaxing. The trail leads to a pathway down to  a beautiful beach area where we let our pup loose and played fetch and socialized with other dogs. Our 2yo son also had a blast with all the running space and dogs. We live in the South Bay, but would definitely take a drive back here.", "author": "Stephanie R."}

I love taking Milo to the local dog park but sometimes, the local dog owners -- yeah, not so much. My dawg's a mutt, a lovable, loyal and super sweet tempered mutt. But a mutt nevertheless. Dog owners in my hood can sometimes not like the mutt. They like pedigree papers and a dog who doesn't look like Tramp  in Lady in the Tramp (and is 75 lbs at 7 months!).\n\nBut dear Fort Funston with all the cool sand and other owners.

Fort Funston is probably what it is like in Dog Heaven. My dogs love it here no matter what the weather is like.\nI would definitely give it 5 stars with the exception of all the people (usually the dog walkers with 6+ dogs) who don't have control over the dogs they have with them. I wonder if the people who are paying to have their dogs walked know how many dogs are in each group? Witnessing this only makes me never want to hire anyone else to walk my dogs knowing how greedy the dog walkers can be. They appear to be way more concerned about the money they can rake in for each trip than the well being of the beloved pets they are suppose to be watching over. The only thing they have going for them is that dogs are a very smart species. So pretty much what I see is the dogs walking a bunch of avaricious wayfarers.\nThe # 1 problem with this is when the dogs veer too far off the trails they disrupt the Bank Swallows which are a threatened species. Fort Funston is one of only two nesting sites for this diminishing species which makes this a crucial matter that I see overlooked on a regular basis. Not to mention all of the countless other types of plants and animals that live here. Don't they realize that eventually this can lead to strict regulations on where you can and cannot have your dog just like there is everywhere else?\nIf you are going to use (more like abuse) a place to run your business out of free of charge you could at least be aware and respectful of your surroundings. Just sort of seems like a lack of common sense to me, considering all of the neglected signs that are posted around the area.", "author": "Paulette B."}

Daddy would calm me down by always doing training exercises with me for a few minutes before getting off-leash.  As soon as that was over, mommy would throw the ball far and I would run to fetch it. Then we would walk down the wood chip area to the doggie-bar and get some water before walking all the way down to the BEACH!

You walk down a mild grade sandy patch.  I would recommend that you check the tides before you go, because its much better at low tide.  \n\nAt low tide you can walk out about 20 yards or so.  You can head either North or South on the beach...if you head North then you will eventually hit Ocean Beach.  We typically head south and circle back toward the parking lot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-22", "description": "Here I am going to wax a bit poetic, as Fort Funston is deserving of no less.\n\nA year before I moved to San Francisco, I flew out from Boston for a five-day visit that would prove to sell my heart on where I should be living. When I got here, I looked up an old roommate from college, whom I hadn't seen in years but with whom I had shaped some very fond memories of around-about-town adventures as we got to know the city in which we lived for four years. Despite the long pause in our friendship, she tucked me into her car with a grin and took me to Fort Funston, telling me it was her favorite outdoor place in the city. Upon arriving there, it immediately became mine.\n\nWhere else can you park your car, walk directly to the edge of land, and find yourself beaming like a small child with a new toy as you watch happy, brave people run off the cliff and lift into the air? The first thing you encounter at Fort Funston, if you go on a windy day, is a sky full of hang-gliders swooping gracefully above you. For me they are a half-hour distraction at minimum. Once I finally move myself onward, I love the left(south)-most walk down to the beach--the long path down the cliffside, the heat of the sand as you climb down the stairs, the ice plant covering the dunes around you, the still, flat part at the bottom where there is no wind, and for a moment you think it can actually be a warm day in San Francisco, and then the slide out of the dunes and onto the beach. \n\nThe sand here is much prettier than at Ocean Beach just a mile or two up the road--it's whiter, loser, easier to sink into as you walk. Peppered amidst stones and doggy-trampled bits of sand dollar you might find some whole ones or, if you have sharp eyes, even some fossilized ones (I have a large collection of them at this point). If you walk even ten minutes down the beach you might find yourself alone, and you might find a rock to sit on while you read a book. If you are there in the late afternoon, you might see dolphins. And if you are not an idiot or an east coaster, like the writer of this review, you might realize sooner than 20 visits in that any old day you want you can watch the sun set over the ocean there, as unlike the Atlantic this ocean faces the right direction for that treat. \n\nFort Funston is no Half Moon Bay, but as far as beaches in the city go, and in terms of beauty and peacefulness, it's league and leagues above Ocean Beach.", "author": "Lara F."}

Cons: 1) location from our home 2) when we went, there were a few families walking around with small children and no dogs...hard to know if they were comfortable around dogs so i put the leash back on when we were around these families just in case (i.e. defeating the purpose of an off-leash park) \n\nWe went to Ocean Beach immediately after for a picnic at the beach, and our dog had just as much off-leash fun.

Doggy went absolutely nuts with happiness here, jumping and running through the damp sand and the low hilly dunes. She started playing hide and seek behind the dunes and it was so cute. It was comfortably cool but sunny on the day we went. There are lots of really nice pretty trails heading from the cliffs to the beach. You can walk along the beach for miles. The huge scope of the place and the salty ocean smells give the dog (and you) a sense of freedom. The hike down to the beach is quite easy although sandy and the views are gorgeous. There are little turn offs along the way where there are spots of woods and fields. I was surprised how dirty my dog got, it was like she had been wading in wet sand up to her chest. Next time I will bring a towel. FYI there are water fountains at the parking lot but no water to be had along the trails. And perhaps the trail is very mildly strenuous when coming back up to the parking lot. Overall, this is a wonderful place to walk, rest, hike, hang out, enjoy with your doggy.", "author": "p v."}

I've had countless memories of hanging out at the wooden deck to just relax, contemplate the meaning of life, watch the hang gliders almost crash into each other, and viewing the sunset.  Unlike Ocean Beach and the Cliffhouse, the area is a bit secluded in that it's not super adjacent to any road/freeway.  Thus, this place totally epitomizes peace and quiet.  \n\nIt's also a great place to take your dog out or to just have a good bike ride along the Fort's trails. I will always cherish those memories if taking out our family Shih Tzu, Taiko, to take a nice walk, only to be almost eaten on a few of those occasions by bigger dogs, but nonetheless we both enjoyed our time there.

If you have a dog that freaks out at sounds like firecrackers or whatever, just be aware that on some days, the sounds from the nearby shooting range (somewhere over by Lake Merced, I think), can be heard from the area around the water fountain.  It's not loud, and it doesn't seem to bother most dogs, but I have seen 2 or 3 dogs bolt at the sound.\n\n2. The first time I ever went to Fort Funston, I got to see a rescue operation in progress for a dog stuck about a third of the way down the cliffs.  It was a lab that had been chasing a ball or something.  He was eventually saved, after hours spent by helicopters and hard-working rescuers, all paid for by the taxpayers.  Moral of the story?

It's really closed off so they can't run near a road. I recommend checking the SF tide table before going though. If the tide is high there is hardly anywhere for you dog to run and the high tide can be dangerous. When the tide is out, there is TONS of room for you dogs to run! Often times, we have a whole 1/4 mile section of beach all to ourselves and it's beautiful! \nYou have to walk down a bunch of sandy steps or a big hill to get down to the beach but it's a safe walk... just a little long. \nWe've never had a problem with any of the dogs or owners there, everyone seems pretty responsible and nice. There are often horses walking the beach so FYI if your dogs like chasing horses like mine do! \nThere's drinking fountains and dog water bowls up in the huge parking lot which is handy and often extra poop bags if you forgot yours.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-12-03", "description": "A whole bunch of people turning a beautiful park into a dog run and a toilet for their dog. If that were not enough, heaven forbid if I try to walk or jog unmolested along the path. No leashes, no control--they just plain do not give a dam about anyone or anything. There is not a single square inch of path a person can travel without facing off with a dog off leash and/or the feces and urine they leave behind.  How about this you supposed dog lovers, treat the rest of us using the park and the park itself like you expect us to treat you and your property. You know, how about I go piss on the hood of your car while it is parked at the Fort. Like that? No, either would I. Sound like non-sense, yes it does--now hold that thought. \n         I assume you agree that a national park deserves at least as much respect as a hunk of metal. Maybe you say yes, but your deeds say no. \n       What kind of self-serving illogic lets you reek havoc on this park and other non-dog owning users? How about I dump a bag of garbage on your doorstep everyday? How about I run my mountain bike down the Fort Funston paths--you would be hysterical because I might run over Fifi, but if Fifi cuts me off while I jog--that is ok?  How about when you let your dog off leash you at least keep him in your line of sight and when you see a jogger coming, heel him. As opposed to chatting away on your cell phone while Fido is wreaking havoc behind you. Such conduct is really not nice, demonstrates a poor upbringing and marks you for the selfish fools you are. \n        Really people, honest,  the paths are NOT DOG RUNS, they are SHARED walkways used by people without dogs who cannot use them when, well, when dogs act like dogs zig zagging all over the place.  We need to share this park, and turning the pathways into dog runs means that the rest of us cannot safely use this park.  (sorry to repeat myself, but I am at a loss how to communicate with people who watch their off-leash dog cut-off a jogger, and then still do not put the leash on. For lack of a better plan I am talking/typing slowly, using small words and repeating myself) \n       I have owned dogs most of my life and would never think of letting one run off leash in this area, not to mention let him join hundreds of others pissing and shitting all over this once beautiful place. Shame on you.  \n            NEWS FLASH--If you have convinced yourself that owning a dog entitles you to wreak havoc on a national park and prevent others from enjoying that park (warning--you might want to sit for the words which follow)--then maybe you should NOT OWN A DOG. (Dog owner suddenly feels dizzy and short of breath)  WOW. WHAT!!--\"You mean, if I live in a crowded urban setting and I do not have a yard large enough for my dog to get enough exercise in that yard, so that I must use public parks as my dogs toilet,  then I should think twice about supporting the puppy mills and maybe NOT OWN A DOG.\" (Dog owner either faints or reacts with uncontrolled rage). \"But that would mean thinking about the impact of my actions on others.....\" (blank look on face, pause, dimly lit bulb briefly flickers to life, but quickly darkens for good)  Wew--\"that was close\", she said as she stopped to watch her dog lift its leg on the bushes in front of her neighborhood school.  \n\n         Ok. Recognizing the futility of expecting you folks to engage your brains or to demonstrate even the slightest modicum of common sense or common courtesy, I will henceforth resort to Plan B while visiting Fort Funston. And it is an oldie but a good one---\"Do unto others as they would.....\" or, if I might be so bold as to delve in to those poop addled brains of yours and put it like you would put it--- \"I will treat the place like a garbage dump and anyone in the dump like the garbage they are because everyone else does.\" Translated---I will run and ride my mountain bike with abandon (with boom box strapped to the back and blaring away), stop and piss in the bushes, sing profane Marine Corps running songs, expel large wads of saliva in plain sight as often as my salivary glands allow and empty all the garbage from my car in to the parking lot before I leave--oh, hell, might as well save some money--- I will cancel my garbage service and make a weekly dump of ALL MY TRASH  right there next to the largest pile of dog shit I can find.  \n\n        In fact, and I am rolling now, I hereby declare Fort Funston the FREEDOM ZONE.  The place where we can each pick a law or two, or maybe just a few well founded rules of common courtesy or common sense, and IGNORE them.  So go at it--garbage, loud music, yelling, minature pigs, flatulence, profanity--let er rip. So screw you and everyone else, we are Americans and we are free.\n\n         And no whining from you dog owners upon witnessing all this, because, after all, this will be your world according to your rules. Welcome and everyone for themselves. How pleasant and thank you neighbor.", "author": "b g."}

Miles of walking along the beach. My dog had a blast--he ran around with other dogs, he climbed the sand walls, and we just walked around for hours. He came home and slept for the rest of the day! This is the best place to walk your dog in the entire bay area. It was beautiful, refreshing, and unlike some reviews...the place did not have any doggie stench! I was a little nervous to take my puppy off leash because he isn't great with other dogs (too playful), but everyone was patient and all the other dogs are really well behaved. After he got used to it, he was just like all the other dogs and just ran around and enjoyed the breach. This is the most amazing place to take your dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Sarah V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-03", "description": "This beach area and the surrounding cliffs are quite beautiful and it's surprising that it is so close to the city. On most weekdays the beach is nearly deserted but on week ends there are quite a few people. The downside, (and the only reason I give it four stars rather than five), is the fact that this is area where dogs off leash are permitted). I've had some instances with aggressive dogs and owners who could care less whether their dog is being a nuisance. There are too many dogs and the dog walkers are using this public beach to ply their trade. I have nothing against people trying to make a living but walking ten or more unruly dogs at once? Many owners don't follow the rules and don't pick up doggie's little deposits so the beach can get nasty. I wish the authorities could clamp down. It's not the dog's fault, there are just too many irresponsible owners and too many people who seem to think they have to have a critter to soil the environment.", "author": "Everett E."}

The 1 star rating is for the cheap incompetent dog walkers that is making Fort Funston an unpleasant place to visit.  Most dog walkers do not pick up after the dogs that are put into their care.  Which is making Fort Funston smell like a dirty toilet.  Then there are the dog walkers that have no knowledge of how to handle a dog.  I'm surprised there are people who would put their dogs in the care of these incompetent people who call themselves a Dog Walker.  They must be charging a very attractive low price for their service.  One so call Dog Walker is Brian Bageant of Out + About Dog Walking.  Every time I see him at Fort Funston, he's with too many dogs for him to handle.  The dogs that are put in his care are running wild with him constantly yelling for them.  Today one of the dogs he was \"walking\" bit my dog.  Again Brian Bageant had no control of the dogs.  My dog was running with two of dogs when an American Bulldog named Guido that Brian Bageant was walking ran over to try to hump my dog.  I tried to separate the bulldog from my dog, but the bulldog got a hold of my dog's ear.  The bulldog did not let go until Brian Bageant pried his mouth open, and got bitten by the bulldog when he finally let go of my dog's ear.  Not only is Brian Bageant an incompetent dog walker, he is even dishonest.  He tried to claim that it was my dog that bit his hand.  My wife saw everything clearly from 3 feet away.  It was the Bulldog that bit his hand when Brian Bageant pried his mouth open.  Wish I can contact the dog owners that are paying for the services of Brian Bageant, to let them know of the danger they are putting their dogs in.", "author": "S Y."}

It is just another slice of paradise that I found on our first road trip with the puppahs.  It is so beautiful, has incredible views of the city, the ocean, and sooo many happy friendly HAPPY dogs.  Our first time here, we started up the trail, not really knowing what to expect.  We didn't know if we could legally let the dogs off the leash so close to Skyline Drive, but we see a few dogs and their people walking around without their leashes on, so we figure, why not.  We make the climb up the sandy stairs and find ourselves in a grouping of dogs and their people.  Everyone is friendly and so are their puppahs.  We start walking one way and realize that we're going the opposite direction of the beach, so we head the other way and meander down to the beach.  We travelled off the paved walkway thinking we could find our own way to the beach, but it ended up meeting up with the paved walkway anyway.  Haha.  So much for our adventure.  Hahaha.  We then proceed down this really steep sandy slope towards the great big gray (I would say blue, but if you've ever really looked at the ocean, it is not a great big blue).  My dogs bolted towards the group of weary travelers coming up the slope to say hi and then proceeded down to the water.  When I finally made my way down to the beach, the dogs were in the water (only their second time in the ocean and seriously loving it this time, the first time they were a little bit timid and afraid).  They ran around like they'd been beach dogs their whole life.  They played, they chased, they splashed, and omg, they had a grand ol' time.  I couldn't stop clicking the camera, they were so adorable!\n\nWe are coming back again and next time, I am going to remember the towels!  :)", "author": "Agatha M."}

Large open area above the beach for dogs to run around and a long stretch of beautiful beach with a loop that's a great distance for dogs and humans. One of the only off-leash dog areas which is perfect for my two huge dogs (Malamute and Golden) who love to run around through the waves.  Dog owners here also don't try to tell you what to do and don't mind big guys either. Only bummer is that there are often horses trotting along the beach and a lot of dogs (including mine) tend to chase and bark at horses.  Beautiful views, beautiful dogs and hang gliders galore!

Ours is still kind of a puppy (11 mos.) so she has a ridiculous amount of energy and needs to run around a lot. She also loves playing with other dogs, so it's her favorite place to go in the whole world. Also, if you're a dog lover, it's really fun to see all of the different cool dogs people bring to the park. The scenery is fabulous, especially on a clear day. The only concern is the steep cliffs. A friend of mine who works for the parks department said there have been numerous incidents involving doggies falling off the cliffs and needing to be rescued.

I seek out these off leash places to recapture this picture. Every time, I feel immense gratitude that this is still possible, in a world where children are getting increasingly nature deprived.\nWe got our dog, my first, a couple of years ago from a shelter. It was immediately apparent that 'walking the dog' is a terribly inapt expression. Anyone who has seen a dog sprint, scamper, play and run for balls and twigs, realizes this in a split second. Dogs were made to run. Children were made to run. \nAfter discovering Fort Funston, we've called it 'Disneyland for dogs'. It is worth a special trip. As we approach our dog will whimper with excitement. There are always tons of dogs of all different breeds and sizes. On sunny weekends it is packed.  An enormous amount of JOY, in people and dogs alike, is generated at Fort Funston. It would be a sad day if that JOY was killed by restrictions.\n\nPlease write: http://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=303&projectID=11759&documentID=38106", "author": "Birgitta B."}

Sometimes ferociously rabid dogs try to pounce you, but for the most part people's dogs are pretty sweet, cute, and lovable.

Shortly after that first trip, Baron got neutered so he'll be indoors for a few weeks. While he was there, he had an absolute ball.  He's a whore when he gets to the dog park and has to give every dog he sees kisses. On my way down to the beach, I ran into a few nice people that I got to talk with.  Once on the beach, Baron went full speed towards the water.The night before, I just gave him a bath so I shut my eyes, cringed and prayed that he'd stay out of the ocean.  After a few seconds, I remembered he was a lab and knew there was no stopping him so any attempts would just be futile.  He played with a bunch of other dogs in the water and had a blast.  We walked towards the other end of the beach and after an hour or so, it was time to go. I was exhausted as was Baron.   Nothing but the comfortable seat in my car was on my mind until I saw that someone has brought the Half Dome to Fort Funston and to get back up, the pooch and I had to scale the faces of death of hand-made stairs constructed of mostly sand. I ran out of water and for a quick second, thought my only hopes of making it up top was to call the Coast Guard for a rescue.  Okay, it  wasn't that bad, but after running on the beach, it wasn't a pretty site as an elderly lady said \"excuse me, sonny\" and passed me right up.  Anyways, its the best place I've taken my dog yet and I can't wait to take him back there.", "author": "Milton W."}

I have give this place a five star rating because I was a fan even before I was a dog walker.  My dog Tito loves this place and so does all my doggie clients.  They can not wait to see all their friends in the park and make new friends on the way.  The hike is refreshing change from the city streets.  The dogs love it and the proof is apparent when you see their spirit lift, their tail waggin, and ears perked up with anticipation.  Not to mention the quiet satisfaction and long nap they take at home.  It is a win win for all.  The trails in Fort Funston are welcoming and diverse.  There are many different types of trails here.  You can take the steep hike down to the beach or you can take the paved roads.  There are sandy and grassy areas and you can even take a more sheltered route where the trees provide shade from harsh sun or wind.  There are plenty of baggie boxes for those who forgets to bring some and water fountain for human and dogs alike.  It is a great place to take a scenery stroll or social hangout for your dog.  It is a bit windy here so a jacket is recommended for humans.  It is a great place to socialize your dog and a great place to bond with your dog.  The space is open and the air is fresh.  Plenty of parking spaces for you car and lots of room to play fetch.  There are 2 entry points to the beach and the beaches are wide with plenty of space for a run.  My favorite spot for a walk and my dog's favorite place to play. I believe exercise for dogs is not complete with just a walk around the block or a mile run with you.

Dogs can go off-leash with absolutely no worries about cars, roads, etc.  The people who go here are responsible with their dogs (read minimal nasty piles of doggie bombs), and I've never seen a dog fight yet.  Perfect place to get the kinks out - for both you and your dogs!", "author": "Kristin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-28", "description": "This was a special place for me and my dogs when I lived in SF. I would take my two Rhodesian Ridgeback here at least 3 times a week. Watching them run about the sand dunes and play with their friends were happy times. I no longer have my babies (died) but I still remember those days when I would turn the corner in my car  into the parking lot and they knew they were close. Their excitement was pure joy.", "author": "D a."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-19", "description": "a  fabulous off leash dog area. My dog loves it and most of the  dog owners and walkers are really really responsible. the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the stupidity of parents. they let there small children run and play w/ toys... stuffed animals, balls and all the toys that dogs also own. even the best trained dogs are confused by the ownership issues. The parents get really uptight and there are 21 miles of parks and beaches that they could take their leashed dogs and kids with toys to instead of the only unleashed fun park for dogs.  the parents are so unaware of how it affects other dogs fun and makes the other dog owners uptight. this mainly happens on Saturdays and Sundays when the professionals are not there. I don't have the least interest in banning kids. kids and dogs are fun it is just allowing the kids to bring the same toys that dogs have. It is a wonderful community that gets a long really well that doesn't need the thoughtlessness.", "author": "mary r."}
