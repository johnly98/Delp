My wife, who has an insatiable sweet tooth when it comes to frozen yogurt, therefore decided not to commit herself to her usual pound of froyo and just tried a few ounces.\n\nThe flavor selection is decent. On top of the usual selection (chocolate, vanilla), there was also, if memory serves me, caramel popcorn and matcha green tea. The caramel popcorn was a little too sweet and the flavor of the caramel was overpowering, but the matcha green tea was probably the best we've had among the dozens of froyo stores and chains we've visited over the years. It was wondrously creamy, and the matcha flavor tasted authentic--I would believe you if you said it was made with real matcha powder, and if not, whatever alternative artificial flavoring was used was extremely convincing and didn't taste at all artificial! It was on par with green tea ice cream!\n\nI'm not sure if we'll be back next time we drop by Japantown. If they rotate flavors (having only gone once, I'm not sure if they do that, or how frequently), we might very well try it out, but there are also lots of other tempting dessert options in the area!", "author": "Jacqueline K."}

I know it sounds weird for a flavor, but it has a strong good taste of salted Carmel like that of Bi-rite's salted Carmel ice cream. The next best one is the strong flavor Pumpkin which was nice. It had a few black dots to show nutmeg I am guessing. The green tea has the weakest flavor of all. The boba balls or pop pop some of you call them, I was a bit disappointed in the texture which was too soft for my taste and I couldn't tell when the ball exploded because I couldn't taste the flavors of the juice and I couldn't tell when the ball burst. Of course this is just my subjective point of view. And for you, your experience may be different.  But I am just comparing with it with my first experience with a boba ball in a fro-yo shop. I have had better. The best way to judge if fro-yo tastes good is to limit your toppings so that you can really taste the fro yo yourself.

There were around 8 different FLAVORS, ranging from tart fruity choices (plain, mango, blueberry, etc.) to more indulgent creamy ones (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, etc.). My froyo philosophy is to always go for the fruit flavors because they just taste better in froyo form. And the plain flavor is nothing plain -- very light, refreshing, and just the right amount of acidity. The texture of all the flavors are very smooth.\n\nWhat really won me over were the abundant TOPPING CHOICES -- lots of fruit, different mochis, candies galore, various cookies (including whole madeleines), and my favorite...jellies! Like the little jellies you get in boba drinks. My favorites are the coffee jellies and lychee bubbles.\n\nThere was a line but it moved speedily along.

The flavors and toppings add up to a more Asian-friendly flavor profile, but that's not a bad thing, and it's arguably quite appropriate given the location. The price is appropriate, and the yogurt is nicely cold and creamy. \n\nThere aren't that many toppings relative to other places in the city, but what there are look quite fresh and good. On one stop here I saw one of the counter staff slicing up mangos and strawberries in the back so I can verify that their fruit is super fresh! The flavors they offer up skew pretty heavily toward fruit flavors, but I've found that some of their flavors are bit... off. I love their No Sugar Added Strawberry, their Original Tart, and their Vanilla, but their Chocolate is a bit chalky, and their Taro tasted too much like root vegetable and not enough like sugar. \n\nSo to sum it up: if you want the best Moyo's has to offer, load up on their fruit toppings and go for a light accompaniment of vanilla or original tart yogurt.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

After a quick shop in the stores nearby, a quick sweet fix at Moyo's fulfills the japantown visit. I usually choose caramel/chocolate flavors, but today I decided to try the fruitier flavors. I got the peach, strawberry, and lychee froyo. Then I topped it off with lychee, white chocolate chips, fruit like bubbles, and mochi bites. The price is decent. If you're not frugal with the choices and want to try a little bit of everything like what I did, the price comes out to be in the $5 range. The flavor really goes well with the warm San Francisco weather. The shopping center could be a little warmer on a sunny day, so the froyo definitely helped out with the temperature.

The girl went to the back, got a teeny paper cup and put in a small dab of Lychee sample in it . I didn't know they made cups that small. I thought it was kind of sour (yeah froyo, not ice cream). I said, Mango is a favorite flavor ice cream and wondered how the froyo versiion tasted.... but she walked away and was not interested in giving me another sample. I got a spoon and sampled my nephew's green tea from the cup he bought. I couldn't taste anything. I got the smallest (pretty big) cup they offered. I squish in a few inches of Blueberry, Mango, and yeah... Lychee. Maybe more will taste better? I topped in carefully with a few mango and lychee balls. A small spoon of different color mochi squares. I'm careful b/c the sign warns you that it is 45 cents an ounce. The cup itself must weight an ounce. I'm sorry, but the blueberry is nasty. The Lychee was OK with the flavored balls and the Mango was the best. The mochi squares were not worth the sugar or calories. In fact, you can buy a whole bag in Chinatown for a little over a dollar.\nMy cup came to 6 oz. and My son's was 9 oz. Why did he pick the heavy chunks of watermelon??? Anyway, the 2 little cups came to about $7. It might have been healthier than the ice cream next door but the sugary stuff we added probably took away any nutritional savings. \nI also like frozen yogurt a bit firmer. This melted too quickly. It was Ok... \nThe little kids liked being able to choose their own toppings and flavors. The place was very clean.", "author": "jane f."}

Not too too many flavors - green tea, lychee, pomegranate, taro, mango, original, strawberry. We only tried the green tea, taro, and lychee. The green tea is sweet - i like it. Taro is nice and lychee is more tart than sweet. \nThe toppings!  Personally I don't get frozen yogurt too much, so maybe this is new or maybe i need to get out more: the passion fruit and mango poppers!  They are like water balloons - kind of fun to eat :) Must try. \nThe owner (i think) is pretty cool too.", "author": "MissJ J."}

There's nothing wrong with that, but just something to take into consideration. \n\nThere were a lot of different toppings and everything seemed really neat, clean, and organized. \n\nI'll most likely come back if I'm ever in the area wanting frozen yogurt. :)", "author": "K.

It's good how they rotate their flavors, but I am glad they don't take our strawberry, not only it's sugar free, but it tastes like candy!
