But really happy they looked into it and solved the problem.\n\nWhile I love this bar, they seriously need to fix the soda machine. My wife is Type 1 diabetic and *cannot* have sugar in her drinks. So while I drink at bars, she orders a Diet Coke. However, every time she orders a Diet Coke at Virgil's her blood sugar spikes afterwards, ruining the evening. We even tested the \"Diet\" Coke with her glucose tester and it contained the same amount of sugar as a regular can of Coke!\n\nWe stress \"DIET\" in the order. We've replaced drinks and watched them pour. Sugar every time. It's fucked up.

This is one of my favorite bars in Bernal Heights because it's funky and unpretentious. The cocktails are simple yet creative. I usually choose from their selection of whiskies,neat. When I do grab a cocktail it's usually the awesome Marian and Vivian Brown,a Sazerac with blended scotch.\nThe bar is dark and cozy. It feels like a speakeasy but allows for an escape within the bar to an out door patio. The patio is perfect for sunny days when you need to unwind with a drink. You can also see through the fence to El Rio which allows for people watching when you're the only one on the patio.\nThe service is friendly understanding of the signs of someone coming in after a rough day at work(me)and they make great cocktails so tip well!", "author": "Zardu H."}

The staff is organized, friendly and accommodating and there is no charge for reserving tables inside or outside on the HUGE back patio.  \nThe vibe inside the bar is warm and welcoming - it's modern but not pretentious, laid back but not a dive, and the real deal jukebox has a solid selection of new and old school favorites. The patio has heat lamps over the tables, which are lifesavers when it's chilly out. When El Rio (next door) is hoppin' you can enjoy their dance music without having to yell into the ears of the people you're talking to. And the cocktails are fantastic - a creative menu with a diverse selection of top shelf liquor without the top shelf prices you'll pay in other parts of the city.\n\nEvents aside, it's a great place to chill any night of the week.

Virgil's doesn't have amazing decor, pretty garnishes on your drinks, or anything besides the essentials really, but the drinks are good / cheap and the bartenders are attentive.

The actual inside bar area isn't very big and I wouldn't describe it as modern or trendy but its intimate and dark. I could see this place being the perfect place for a first date night getting drinks, or the first stop for a group of gals or guys to talk and pregame. In fact I feel when I return it will be for one of those two reasons. The drink menu was nothing special but not tacky, I ordered a spicy tequila cocktail and it was great! Best part too was that it was only $9 which is totally unheard of in the city. I think for that reason I had 2 or 3- don't judge me lol. They have a cool outside area which is actually where we spent most of our time. We sat next to some sf hipsters eating burritos and nachos, I Definetly thought to myself next time I'm bringing food in too haha. We drank our drinks and since we were outside I was able to vape and overall I had a great time. Only thing missing were some sick beats, the music choice was old-school indie rock which lets be honest you can only stand to listen to that in a bar for so long and after so many drinks you just wanna shake your ass a bit. We could hear the music at el rio playing next door and we ended up going there next for more drinks and dancing. We actually closed the bar there haha. The two together would make for an awesome night out and they are literally next door to eachother so its an easy 2 for 1 night.", "author": "alix b."}

But a combo of factors just made me feel like I should have had the party somewhere else--not all of which were their fault.\n\n1. There was a dance party at the next door bar, the noise was insanely loud (and we weren't warned).\n2. The table we reserved was dirty and missing a bench. Both things could easily be fixed, but when I asked the bartender to assist, the response was very cold--even though they did fix it.\n3. There were lots of dogs on the patio where we were (10-15), and one kept getting into fights. Though people were really unhappy/scared around the dog, no one made them leave.\n4. All of the big tables that night were reserved, and my party was constantly being complained at by other guest for having rented the tables. I don't understand why the clientele would act like this if they know Virgil's rents the space. It was unpleasant. \n\nOn the plus side, the drinks were yummy. And we got a free bottle of wine with our reservation, which added a nice touch. But it wasn't enough to make me feel like I'd made the right choice. \n\nI think if you just wanted to drink, this would probably be a nice place.

I have been to many margaritas nights at bars, who instead of making fresh, will just pre-make them and poor (yikes). Virgil's makes each one fresh on Tuesday's (and everyday). I usually just go all out and get a double margarita for $4. However, even on Tuesday's, the margarita pitches are regular priced - $25, serves about 6.

I loved that it wasn't \"cute\", or wood-paneled, or taxidermied to (literal) death all just to please the bourgeois young gods of our city. \n\nBut my favorite part of Virgil's is how gracefully its owners play homage to everything that came before it - including Nap's iconic karaoke night, w Nap himself still at the helm. And how Virgil's effortlessly charts a righteous sea-faring path into our beautiful City's future via great affordable drinks and an infinitely welcoming atmosphere.\n\nOne of the more charming aspects of \"Nap's III\" is that they've created cocktails named after a number of San Francisco's fearless freaks, faeries, and charitable financiers. My favorite (as a matter of literal taste) is the Warren Hellman, a refreshing variation on the Kentucky Mule, named after that billionaire who continues to fund Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, even after his recent demise. There's also a cocktail after one of my favorite SF icons Frank Chiu aka the 12 Galaxies guy who is holding the Laughing Squid-sponsored sign of conspiracy theory \"gibberish\" at pretty much every SF street fair. Another is named after Vicki \"the liquid spine\" Marlane, who was a legendary trans performer at another of my favorite SF haunts, Aunt Charlie's.\n\nI also love that it's become a hot-bed for political activists. In an era when so many bars throughout SF are becoming so averse to public discourse on matters of true importance, Virgil's welcomes that discourse and stages events for people from all walks of life to engage on tough topics. It's a bar in the truest sense - that is, it's a place to gather, talk, debate, argue, make up, and make out over a neat cocktail or cheap can of beer.\n\nOne last thing - Virgil's is perfect for bar-hopping, in perfect walking proximity to Rock Bar, Knockout, Royal Cuckoo, and, of course, it's dear sister bar, El Rio.\n\nPhew, now I'm out of breath! I could really use a Warren Hellman right now...", "author": "Lee H."}

The negroni was the only drink with flavor, and it tasted like straight up Campari.

I LOVE the decor of this bar, like I'd love to have whomever outfitted it be my interior designer it's beautiful and charming . The specialty drinks are fantastic. A standout was the FRANK CHU , a nod to our beloved 12 Galaxies celebrity. My friends and I got a pitcher of margaritas as well and for the price it was good , although not as great as the non mix based specialty stuff they have on their menu. I do think NAPS had more backyard seating and I'd like to see Virgil's maybe follow suit since that backyard area is so big and special especially on nice summer days and nights. The staff was friendly , and the music selections were fantastic. I will definitely be back here", "author": "Lauren V."}

Great decor, solid drinks at good prices, amazing patio, consistently great service and all around wonderful atmosphere. I had been going here fairly often before my girlfriend decided to celebrate her birthday here. We made a reservation for a group of about 15 and the process was so easy. All of my questions were answered, and everything turned out perfectly the night of the party. They offer pitchers of mojitos and margaritas and that was the best decision I think I've made in a while! Totally delish and packed a perfect punch.  \n\nOverall, I dig this place as a go-to neighborhood bar for a regular night out, and I would definitely have another special occasion here.", "author": "Natalia P."}

They have fantastic craft cocktails for dive bar prices and their bartenders are friendly and quick to recommend new drinks and beers. The ambience is divey in a stylized, retro sort of way, and of course they have an amazing patio in the back.

Tom, the booking manager, was really easy to work with, and he made the entire reservation process stress free. Jesse and all the bartenders were fun, charismatic, and made delicious cocktails. I had originally booked the large and charming back patio for our party (it comes complete with picnic tables and heaters), but when it started raining Jesse let us move inside and spread out inside the bar. We were even allowed to purchase a number of drink tickets so that our guests could enjoy discounted drinks. Even without the drink tickets their many tasty cocktails were reasonably priced, and they have a nice beer selection too. I would highly recommend Virgil's Sea Room to anyone who wants to host a party at a bar with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, dynamic bartenders, delicious drinks, and a booking manager who is very easy to work with.", "author": "Austin M."}

It could of been a relaxing atmosphere but the music was annoyingly blasted at full-on decimal with Mariah Carey that felt like a ice pick stabbing you right in your ear drum. I am all for loud music at the proper time and place. All we wanted to do was relax with a well deserved beer in a chill atmosphere at 6pm and be able to have a proper converstation without having to shout at each other, we left after the one beer that we could not wait to finish. Sadly this is my second \"meh\" experience here and will not be back. Will be going to my regular chill jaunts like Rock Bar and Holy Water for that peaceful Sunday drink.", "author": "Nico B."}

I was on the patio for a friend's birthday and some other patrons brought their very rowdy dogs and let them run free. I'm all for well behaved dogs but these ones were running around, knocking people over and had to be pulled away from the birthday treats more than once. I realize that a bar can't necessarily prevent bad behavior on the part of its patrons but one of the employees came out to the patio at some point and totally ignored the dogs' ruckus play.\n\nIn addition to the obnoxious dog situation, the drinks seem to have been poured short. I couldn't feel or taste any alcohol in my drink and I'm generally only a bit north of lightweight. I probably won't come here again of my own choosing.", "author": "OnlyatBrandei S."}

Had to wait a while to get service at the bar on a Saturday, but not unexpected. I was having a great time with friends.  There was a ladder near the restroom that did not go anywhere but it was there. I climbed it. And then I got kicked out of the establishment. There was no sign to not climb the ladder. I think that was unfair, as there was no sign not to climb the ladder. What do you expect people that have been drinking to do when there's a ladder in public space with no \"do not climb\" warnings? Anyway, I suggest they get rid of the ladder or maybe put a sign up so people won't climb the ladder.", "author": "Marisa M."}

The 1st time we happened upon Virgil's was their opening party, we didn't know about the occasion and we were curious about the crowd at this new place. Despite the outside of the bar looking kind of dark and dated (not in a good way/1less star for this), we went in, received quick and friendly service -the bartender smiled, welcomed us and introduced herself as Jill before taking our order! Seriously impressed with this, as most Mission bars these days seem to lean towards bartenders with attitudes of superiority and you're \"lucky\" that you have been chosen to order a drink from this ultra being- god forbid order a cocktail on a busy night!- loving the way our 1st visit is going right off! I ordered one of their fancy cocktails, the Viki Marlene which was delicious and generous (love a good sized cocktail!), being a Bay Area native it was lovely to see the cocktail menu honor SF personalities.  I was adored the vintage wallpaper and nicely (not cheesy) done sea/shipping theme, we made our way to the patio which is HUGE (by SF space standards) and HEATED! The place was packed this night so we didn't stay as long as we would have liked, but we were excited about our new find! We have returned several times now (worth the trek out there, as we don't live in the neighborhood) and haven't been let down yet- still always friendly service, delicious cocktails (loving the Warren Hellman!) and very generous pours (yay!). Also great seating options when it's not so busy (comfy leather chairs in back, when you want that sort of thing) and on sunny days the patio makes me love SF even more!", "author": "M M."}
