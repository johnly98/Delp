So I decide to go on a mission to find the best cheesesteak around. And first on the tour is Phillies. I seen a lot of positive feedback about this joint so I had to go see what it was really about.\n\nI ordered \"The Works, Cheesesteak\" featuring Cheese Wiz\nA happy medium on portion size here. Its not overloaded with meat and all that extra other stuff. Some cheesesteak places I've been too think that if you just throw a pile of meat on the plate, that its a good well done. But thats not always the case. The meat has good flavor, I feel like the meat is more on the premium end. Maybe I'll order more grilled onions next time, but thats just my preference. The cheese wiz is a must! My buddy ordered with provolone and it was just okay. If you wanna get that authentic cheesesteak taste, go with the Wiz! Any other cheese, you'll just be searching for it in the meat. \n\nOn the side we also order garlic fries for $3.95 and tots for $2.95. Solid garlic fries, even though at first sight I was thinking it was gonna suck because of the lack garlic thrown on top. But it had the flavor so I can't complain. The tots were good, just you basic ones. I would probably get the cheese tots next time. The portion size is enough to share for two people so they give you a lot.\n\nThe two fella's holding down the restaurant were cool, quick, and friendly. Great cheesesteaks pair with good service.

Something about it absorbs the delicious meat juice, cheese, grease, and mayo perfectly. \n\n3) They do offer cheese whiz for the purists, and it is their best seller. But I'll stick with provolone for the time being.\n\n4) Holy crap do they have a great bottled beer selection and a few on tap.

As I watched, all I could say was \"holy chet, that's hella beef and it looks hellllla good\" \n\nAs I watched with a watering mouth I got really anxious to tear up this sandwich. I watched as the chef coated the bread with wiz first, then topped all the meat and peppers on top of that and then he put more wiz on the sandwich. They then proceeded to make the fries. Im not sure what they put in their pizza fries but it tasted exactly like pizza pringles. Some of you might think that is gross but them fries was C R A C K I N. Anyways, back to the sandwich.\n\nSo we ordered all the food to go. We got back to my friends shop and proceeded to eat.

Just suggestions.  Trying not to be critical or obnoxious:  The garlic appears to be small specks, tiny pieces of white garlic that for me don't add much in the way of flavor.  I think like the competition they should use soft peeled garlic cloves that melt in your mouth with garlic flavor.  The competition's are pre-roasted, however they are real garlic cloves. Also I noticed they took pre-sauteed onions from a metal hot box, reheating them on the grill with the meat.  My 5 Star uses fresh, raw onions on the grill.  They definitely have more snap & flavor. Also I think heating the Amoroso roll on the grill softens it too much, taking away from its 'chewyness,' not that there's such a word!  However like the other place I'm happy Phillies uses Amoroso rolls from Philly.  See pic.  It was delicious, & the mushrooms were fresh, cooked with the steak & very good.  Will be back.

We all got our drink cups but we opted for the \"to-go\" cups that come with a lid and a straw so we can take our drinks with us after we ate. Anyway, upon waiting for our food we filled up our cups with the soda of our choice. I opted for water while the rest of my party had soda (my boyfriend got root beer, my niece and her boy friend got the orange soda, and my cousin got the coke). Well by the time we got our food, my boyfriend decides it's time for him to refill his cup. When he took the lid off the top of his cup, THERE WERE ABOUT A DOZEN ANTS CRAWLING ON THE SIDE OF THE CUP! He was so disgusted and started gagging. At first I didn't know what was wrong with him but he showed me and I too was instantaneously disgusted as well as the rest of my party. \nWhen we went to tell the lady who helped serve us, she immediately got on the phone and called who I assume is the owner. Although she seemed concerned, she didn't apologize right away which I felt was weird. As we started walking out the door, I told my boyfriend who paid for all of our meals that he should get his money back since we didn't finish our food and our throats felt violated and disgusted. He went back in the restaurant and got his money back and it was then when she actually apologized. \nI know it's not her fault. We didn't disrespect her since she simply just works there but we are definitely NEVER going back there. FRICKIN' DISGUSTING!", "author": "May B."}

So my sister had a brilliant idea (not being sarcastic) to do a self-directed foodie tour of a nearby neighborhood on foot, since there was like a string of eateries up and down the street.  So she wanted to start at Phillies, which she already knew and loved, but wanted to share with me, a San Diegan, not a San Franciscan.  So, here's my past experience with cheesesteaks: someone says, let's get cheesesteaks, my mouth waters even though I'm thinking, oh crap, the calories!, but then because my mouth is watering, I go with the person to get the cheesesteak, eat the cheesesteak, but then feel like a lingering regret for eating the cheesesteak, since it tasted much better in my mind than what I actually had.  (And, yeah, I've never had a real Philly cheesesteak to compare anything to).\n\nAnyway, not wanting to be a killjoy and because I had the automatic salivatory response anyway even after all my past experiences (and because I knew my boyfriend would really want to go), we went to Phillies.  My sister asked them to slice the cheesesteaks into 3 separate pieces (we were on a self-guided food tour, so had to keep room available for other stuff).  We tried the Works, and man, this is the first time I can say that the cheesesteak lived up to what my taste buds imagined a cheesesteak could be and should be.  The meat was just so flavorful and everything else inside of the c.s. was like, complementing it and not overwhelming, all working together to create total cheesesteak yumminess-perfection.\n\nBut, anyway...we were attempted to just order more cheesesteaks and stop right there, because we all agreed, it was goood!  but we were on a mission, and we had to complete it...next stop, Batter Up, a corn dog joint right down the street...on we went, despite a strong temptation to just go all out at Phillies.\n\nReally good cheesesteaks! \n\n(Ambience= extremely casual.

And it only gets simpler.\n\nThere are also a variety of Cheesesteaks to choose from too, for the lazy and unimaginable (like myself). From the Mushroom Steak, Pizza Steak, or \"The Rocky Balboa\" (double meat double cheese). Prices range from $7 to $11. \n\nBUFFALO STEAK $7.50 - \nI was in the mood for some buffalo flavor. Maybe I was craving wings at the moment and Popeye's at the end of the block wouldn't suffice, but I got to ordering the Buffalo Steak with provolone, no extras. \n\nThe Philly consisted of their simple Cheesesteak but with \"SPICY buffalo sauce\". When my Philly arrived, it looked somewhat disappointing. It wasn't smothered in buffalo sauce or anything (good and bad) but the total amount of actual steak, onions, and peppers looked scarce. However, my Buffalo Steak sandwich itself was quite good. It could have been a lot SPICIER (I love spicy after all) and packed with more everything, but it was simple, made to order, and satisfied my craving. \n\nI couldn't help but ponder that the only thing that branded my sandwich different than any other Philly on their menu was pretty much the +$.75 for buffalo sauce..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-15", "description": "I don't think they're exaggerating when they claim there is \"1/2 Pound of meat in every roll\".\n\nI finally stopped by at this relatively new cheesesteak shop near my neighborhood on Geneva Avenue near Mission Street.  They've been open about three months, and they seem to be doing well business-wise.  The menu is pretty simple with mostly Phillie-type sandwiches and a few sides.  They offer steak or chicken \"wit or wit'out onions\" and a veggie one cooked on a separate veggie-only grill.  Just like my favorite cheesesteak place in the Mission Phillies imports Amoroso rolls directly from Philadelphia.  At Phillies though, the rolls are toasted on the grill so they have a very nice outer crunch to it.\n\nI ordered a Steak Cheesesteak wit onions, cherry peppers and Provolone.  You can have authentic Kraft Whiz or American cheese as well.  One of my pet peeves is cheesesteak shops that apply the cheese onto the roll instead of onto the meat.  They do that here too.  While it doesn't alter the taste of the sandwich it does make it a bit messier to eat.  Sandwiches are cooked to order so expect a bit of a wait.  I ordered a side of Fries and a fountain soda as well.\n\nWhile I waited I noticed the Peanut Chews candy bars sitting on the counter.  I bought one of each (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IQN7FHupd698zsc6XmvWQA?select=s3A3k0QFD4iMMAb_YdsT6g) to snack on after the sandwich.  The candies are from the Philadelphia area as well.\n\nThe sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IQN7FHupd698zsc6XmvWQA?select=r9TuC71djtOKEMyWy-MAPA) was brought to my table with a generous order of fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IQN7FHupd698zsc6XmvWQA?select=naPNmK52LP5FAaGNeyix6A).  The fries were very good cooked crispy on the outside and nice and meaty on the inside.  The cheesesteak was very good too.

(Spits) Phillies like the liberty bell is CRACKIN'! It's rocks like Rocky. It's fly like the Eagles. It's always Sunny and hell Phil's shows brotherly love, champ. This is the biggest thing to come from Philly to out here in the Bay Area since Wilt Chamberlain. \n\nFormerly 'Starvin' Marvin' this place made it's own place, it's grew into a great place. All about the Benjamins now, baby!!! While it's very successful, it has it's roots in good customer service and great food.\n\nYou know you're from Philly, when you can't eat anything without it wrap in a Amoroso Roll. Well, no worries Phillies here in Crocker is the place to be if homesick. Their steaks are 100% top loin. Chicken is 100% breast meat.  1/2 pound of meat in every roll. They import their Amoroso Roll from Philly.  \n\nYou can get Steak or Chicken wit or wit-out Onions. (6.50 to 6.75). You can get Pepper Steak with Bell Peppers, Pizza Steak, Steak Hoagie, or Veggie, but IMO, the Cheese Steak with Cheese Whiz and Mushroom Steak are the best!!! 'supposely' veggie are cooked on a seperate grill, but I been here so many times to know that's only half true. Warning: sandwiches are hot like burning hot like the 76ers when they were really hot back in the day. The peppers are hot for another reason, it's spicy!!! AHHHH!!!!! My mouth is burning! Excuse me, I just ate a pepper! \n\nU can add these sauces to your hoagie for 50 cents: cheese, BBQ, Buffalo, Pizza, Avocado, Mushroom, Peppers. \n\nBreakfast Philly are serve: egg, steak and cheese for 6.50 and tater tots for 2.50.\n\nPhilly Salad: (don't get, be a man and get a cheesesteak, please). 5.99. It's like going to a steak house and ordering salad. Who does that???! WAWA! \n\nSides: Fries (2.50). Chilli (3.00) Fried Zucchini Bread (2.50) Breaded Mushroom (2.50) and Soda (1.50).\n\nThe best day to go is Thursday as they have a special: Philly, fries, and soda for $10. \n\nYou can dine in, but it's kinda small quarters and the stools are bit wobbly at times. You can watch television while you eat, and near it is the sauce station, and fountain machine. Free refills on fountain drinks. There is candy on the counter, don't remember if it's free or not, never got to ask. Always forgetting to ask.   \n\nOverall: good sandwiches, good customer service, dine in location so-so. \n\nThey do need a couple of things to add to the menu, one day like Scrapple and Wooder ice!

But within a minute, someone came out to take my order. I decided to be simple and just get the regular cheesesteak with provolone cheese, onions, and peppers. The sandwich took about 5 to 7 minutes to make and the seating area was quickly filled with the wonderful aroma of melted cheese and steak while I was watching The Dr. Oz Show on their TV. The bread was a little soggy by the time I got home, but other than that, the sandwich as a whole was delicious! Lots of tender steak and a few slices of peppers to add a little heat. My only disappointment was that it wasn't cheesy enough. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I love the idea that Phillies uses a separate grill for the vegetarian sandwich. The menu is large and in-your-face when you walk in. There's not a lot of seating here, just three round tables and one counter table.\n\nI originally wanted to come on a Thursday to get the $10 combo meal, but I figured I'd save some bucks and just come on any other day for a sandwich alone.

The philly is just overflowing with meat and all the other goodness in it.  The meat is full of flavor that even a person who doesn't always care for beef will enjoy it immensely.

They have like 6 or 8 diff sandwiches basically just all standard phillies but like with pizza sauce, buffalo sauce, with or without mushrooms, peppers etc. there's one option to get extra meat an cheese and I don't think it comes with peppers or muh rooms but it's like almost $12 which is quite a bit pricier than the others which are in the $7 range. The one that comes with everything is pretty good, my husband got the mushroom one and he liked that one just fine. We got a sode of onion rings which were great, exactly what you'd want in an onion ring. BUT the problem with everything is that it's really skimpy. Our sandwiches were mostly bread and even tho there was barely anything inside the sandwich, only about 20% of that barely anything was meat. I'd eager a guess that they use about 2 ounces of meat in each sandwich. Same thing goes for the rings, an order had about 4 small and 2 large rings in it. Overall it was tasty food and we spent $22 on lunch for 2 but if we had opted to leave full we'd have spent $40. Prob won't return except maybe if I'm craving some onion rings.", "author": "Emma H."}

I will call it \"The Day of My Spiciest Philly\" day.  A purveyor of chilis and spices alike, I was anticipating the next creation from the Chef.  Today it was the BUFFALO STEAK. Now mind you, I enjoy the tear inducing effects of the hot stuffs and have nary a problem delecting on the spiciest of the spicy so my description may be a bit skewed to left(the left side being the spicier of the right and left sides). Unlike the Banh Mi', which when bitten into at strategic locations can give bursts of gunfire-like heat, the Buffalo Steak and the deep relish it is concocted in engulfs the eater's tender mouth lining with napalm-like coverage. Not to say it is the spiciest thing I have ever eaten, not by a longshot but for a Philly and with the constant refueling of the fire with the aforementioned nectar of Buffalo is what made it biteful. The loud flavor was neutralized modestly with a liberal helping of the Whiz, only to have the flavors flip again with a strong finish from the peppers.  You can always count on the meat being consistent so nothing more to say other than, d-lish-amundo. \n\nMy hands and face were covered with the sauce and cheese gravy.  I looked in the mirror and smiled. Yet another creation that  has satiated the spicy needs of The Food Ninja.", "author": "Fifteen F."}

When my car broke down on the freeway and barely made it to Geneva on Wed, I finally had my chance.  Lately, I've been the king of making the best of a bad situation so I figured I'd might as well hit their bathroom and have a good lunch before calling a tow truck.\n\nAs I walked in, the girl working the counter and the guy cooking in the back were really nice and greeted me.  The menu board was easy to understand and prices looked reasonable.  I ordered some fries and a cheesesteak with provolone, peppers, and onions...no whiz.\n\nI am happy to say that it was really good!  The meat of the cheesesteak was nicely seasoned and had good flavor.  I actually liked the taste of the meat (menu says top loin) at Phillies way better than the meat at Jake's which lately seems bland and underseasoned.  If Phillies increased the amount of meat to the level of Jakes, I would say hands down that Phillies has the ultimate cheesesteak in SF.  It would be so killer!  Regardless, I enjoyed it a lot and I can honestly say that it is definitely one of the best in SF.  My thought is raise your prices if you have to, but make it with too much meat and this thing would be legendary!\n\nThe fries were cooked perfectly too.  Nothing fancy, but hot, golden goodness.  I left full, happy, and prepared for the tow and whatever the day might throw my way.  As it turned out, I never did make it to work that day.", "author": "Roy N."}

Most importanly juicy because all that meat juice + cheese drips out of your sandwich in this messy but damn good kinda way. However, no worries about the dripping because there's definitely plenty of meat juice + cheese packed into your sandwich. I tried the steak hoagie + whiz & a mushroom steak + whiz. Both were very yummy. The mushroom steak was a bit monotone in flavor for me because of the meaty steak combined with the meaty mushrooms but it was definitely meat-tastic. At Phillies, when you add onions to your sandwich, instead of slightly sauteing the onions, they cook them with the meat so that it absorbs all the of that meat flavor and becomes super flavorful and soft. But really, it is the flavorful, tender meat and the wet, salty cheese that makes these cheesesteaks amazing. The rolls definitely play their part as they are soft and keep your sandwich together. I also ordered onions rings which weren't super greasy, had thick rings of onion, and were nicely battered.  An order doesn't come with that many rings though.\n\nService is good and they jump to cook up your order as soon as you place it. Ya gotta love the more than reasonable prices of the cheesesteaks especially considering their huge size! \n\nOn a sad note, romaine was the type of lettuce added to my cheesesteak which gave it a different taste than usual iceberg lettuce does. After having romaine lettuce on my cheesesteak, I think I much rather prefer iceberg. Also, I was asked if I wanted peppers on my cheesesteak and although I said yes, they forgot to add em.

I didn't expect the place to be open but to my surprise since there's very little people that there wouldn't be a hold up on my dinner.  Along with that they have an assortment of cheeses that you can ask for to top your philly (American, Swiss, Provalone, Cheese Whiz). Next time I should Get mine with Cheese Whiz.. They do offer a nice assortment of extras and if you don't prefer beef there is always chicken. They also have an assortment of independent IPA's by the bottle. Some beer and there's a two tv's inside so if you guys & gals like watching sports or the Giant's game on the tele and love philly sandwiches. Your best bet is to dive in here and take some time to enjoy your meal. Another thing I would prefer.. hopefully the O rings aren't pre made but... if they had the beer batter taste it would make me feel alot better that way I don't feel so heavy after eating my sandwich.\n\nThere's also some buzz about being their top eating champ in the area. The contest is to stuff 5x Rocky Balboa's and 1 soda within an hour. I'm tempted to try... but I think I'm lacking in certain departments. However, I do plan on asking them to add cream cheese and probably kimchi to their suggested menu items to make a sandwich. I asked about it the evening that I did go in and the gal mentioned that there was a guy that stopped on his 4th Rocky... hrm I'm really up for a challenge and I think even for my size my stomach can handle eating alot of things. \n\nAnyways, my mission is complete!!!

I've tried many places (like The Cheesteak Shop, Buffalo Burgers, etc) and Phillies has the best cheesesteak by far. It's small and in the most random spot and might be hard to catch, but you must find this treasure. I literally work right across the street from The Cheesesteak Shop and have been going there for years, but started getting fed up with the weak chopped up dry meat with barely any cheese, that they were providing. Not to mention the inside of that place smells like a hobo hotel.\n\nSeeing as Phillies is right in my hood I decided to give it a shot. Man, why did I wait so long?!?!?! Delicious!! The bf and I agree that this place is LEGIT when it comes to our cheesesteak fix. We love our meaty sandwiches, and Phillies does not dissapoint. The cheesesteak was supplied with lots of thick meats, cheese, and TONS of green and red peppers. MmmMMMm. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The onion rings were also huge and crispy - not soggy at all even when we took our food home.\n\nIf you like meat, try Phillies. It's meat-tastic.", "author": "Tay R."}

None of this \"extra meat\" charge of the chessesteak shop.  They proudly state \"1/2 pound of meat on every sandwich\" which seemed legit.  Nice fresh authentic rolls and toasted.  Perfect ration of bread to meat to provolone.  Good onions.  I bit swamped at 11:30 because the cashier was out doing some errand, but I will forgive.  Very fair price, which I expect is partly due to the fact that it's far removed from the high rent districts.  Not too convenient, but worth an excursion or as a lunch stop before your Daly City target run.  Also, like that they have a vegetarian sandwich and state how they cook it on a separate grill.

I said it was ridiculous & he said I was ridiculous for accusing him of not adding cheese.  What kind of business would argue with their customers when indeed all 3 of our sandwiches didn't have cheese and we all agreed the meat was tough and dry?  What shocked me was his attitude.

Now Phillies has wild-carded itself into my heart.  Jay's who?  Cheese Steak Shop huh?\n\nDuring my first visit, I had the steak hoagie, no mayo, provolone and peppers; delish!  On my second visit, I came in on a Thursday and had the $10 special meal combo with a cheesesteak sandwich with the whiz, fries and root beer.  I can honestly say that Phillies has some of the best fries in town; so get the combo if you've got the appetite.  \n\nSo what sets this place apart from the other?  I've gotta say, hands down, THE MEAT.  Its so moist and juicy, never overcooked and the juices run into the soft bread roll.  Drool.  The guys behind the counter gave us great service too.  The dude brought our sandwiches to our table which was a pleasant surprise considering its a fast-food joint .  The other thing worth mentioning is the cleanliness of the place.

What a pleasant surprise.  I've been to Jay's, Buster's, and the Cheese Steak Shop. All are pretty decent cheesesteaks, but I like Phillies the best so far.  It's only been one experience, so I'll have to check it out again for consistency, but so far so good.  I had the cheesteak with provolone, grilled onions, and peppers.  The steak was well seasoned and yummy!", "author": "A R."}

I liked the peppers and onions they added good flavor. my only complaint would be there wasn't enough cheese so make sure to ask for extra if you go with the cheese wiz. I will definitely be comming back as this place is only a short walk from my house. Cheese steak and fries came out to 9 something so not bad.", "author": "jeremy l."}

The bread was kinda awesome, too. One bite took me back to eating steaks at Primo's in Jersey as a kid.

I'm thinking it must be one of the disturbed people on Geneva ave. When I walk in the building I notice it's very clean but no one inside, incl the employees. As I turn around the guy on the phone IS the employee, lol!  While on his cell phone he takes my order & my money. As I wait for my change, a rude fat kid walks into the building and bumps right into me. I watch as he goes to the soda fountain to fill his cup, WTF!? Employee says nothing, neither does the kid. He walks right out w/ soda in hand & rest assure he bumps\nme on the way out. employee cooks the sandwich & it took awhile (I'm the only customer). He continues talking and gives no notice the sandwhich is done, however, I notice the to-go bag near the counter. I get it myself and leave the building. Great cudt service- not! As for the sandwhich, meat was over cooked & crispy. Cheese only to one side. Too much mayo. I've had much better service and phillys elsewhere. This place is here to make a buck as the avg Philly is over $7. Keep in mind these guys arnt cheese steak experts!", "author": "Cee B."}

It was later in the evening when we stopped in and were'nt expecting much but when they served our meals  we saw steam coming for the basket smelling deliciously ...lots of meat just amount of onions and bell peppers wth peppers on top.

Under seasoned/over priced is how I would best describe this \"cheesesteak\".   The meat had zero flavor and there was way too much of it.  I would rather see the sandwich a buck cheaper with a smaller quantity of nasty meat.  Plus it's called a cheesesteak, you shouldn't be charged 50 cents extra for cheese!  I say go to Jay's cheesesteak if you're craving cheesesteak.  Avoid this place!", "author": "schmoo l."}

The best philly cheesesteak I've ever had was a Pat's King of Steak in Philadelphia, and this one is about the only other one I've had that even comes close (esp. in CA). I got  the steak & mushroom wit onions and whiz plus hot/sweet peppes, and highly recommend it. An authentic cheesesteak is served with cheese wiz as the cheese and this is by far the way to go, and unforturnately in CA virtually nobody serves them this way.  I wish they would open a Phillies in the East Bay!", "author": "John G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-21", "description": "I tried this place out a few weeks ago and it was meh. I ordered the regular old cheesesteak with provolone and no peppers. They specifically asked me 3 times if I wanted peppers or not and I declined. I got my order home and it was dripping with peppers! It's not that big of a deal, because I can pick them off, but, if you are going to ask me, listen to my response! The meat was not really seasoned too much and ended up applying salt and pepper liberally to my sandwich. It wasn't very cheesy at all, which I found odd. I couldn't actually taste any cheese in it at all. I also was fighting a cold, so maybe a stuffed nose is to blame. The fries were tasty and the service was friendly enough. They take credit card, which is a plus for me. That being said, an just-okay cheesesteak where I couldn't taste the cheese but could taste all the peppers I said I didn't want, fries and a soda set me back 11 bucks and change. Maybe I'll go back and give them a day in court, but, I'm not sure.", "author": "Jessica R."}
