I was determined not to have them pass out on the streets of San Francisco thanks to my super nifty turbo tour guide skills. Nope! Not on my watch. I tried to find something quickly en route for our sight-seeing without reading reviews, keeping my fingers crossed this would satisfy their cries of hunger. You'd think I didn't feed them breakfast a few short hours before but all that looking can sure work up an appetite...\n\nTheir eyes popping wide open as they took their first bites and the chorus of mmmmm's & this is \"damn good\" reassured me that this place delivered...phew!!!  Oh wait, that was me saying, \"damn good\" and accidentally inspiring the 8 year old to repeat it after me...whoops!! But no really, they couldn't stop commenting on how tasty and juicy (not greasy) the burgers were. \n\nThe quality of the food is really good. Y'all may possibly know I'm not the biggest meat eater out there, but this burger was so good, my greedy little taste buds were left wishing that I had gotten the super duper burger rather than the mini burger. However the mini combo was just the right amount of comida for me.  The fries had that nice crispy factor going on. I added my secret stash of pink Himalayan salt to kick the flavor up a notch. \n\nPretty much everything  is noticeably good quality from the vegetarian fed meat (didn't say grass fed) to the cheese to the what seemed to almost be house made ketchup. You can select free toppings from jalape\u00f1os, pickles, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato etc. For a nominal cost a cage free egg, avocado or bacon add on is all yours. Yes Siree! (No, not Siri!) They serve beer, wine, lemonade, coke in a bottle, coconut water and the usual fountain drinks. Bonus points if they someday switch to cane sugar craft sodas.\n\nHappily, Super Burger saved the day ensuring I could continue to try to cram introducing my friends to all the quintessential city sights in one day...", "author": "Cyntia Q."}

I'm from Toronto and have tried the more talked about In-N-Out and Shake Shack burgers, and frankly, they don't really come close to the Super Duper burger. Friends from San Francisco introduced us to this place and we had:\n\n- Burger with super sauce, cheese and bacon: I'm a big fan of burger meat that's ground fresh daily and you can really taste the difference in terms of the quality of Super Duper's patty - it was really juicy, had a good crumble-in-your-mouth texture to it, and defibitely not gainy. In addiction, the bacon was nice and crisp, there was just the right amount of cheese, toppings/garnishes were standard fare, and the bun didn't get soggy from this greasy delight. If I had one quibble, it's that the burger was a bit too salty for my taste. But flavour-wise, a definite hit.\n\n- Double chocolate and chips shake: I was expecting it to be thicker/creamier but then realized it was made out of soft serve. I personally prefer ice cream, but that said, the shake definitely satisfied my sweet tooth as the chocolate flavour wasn't watered down and they had just the right amount of chips to give a good texture (and added chocolatey taste) to the shake. Also, this was a great counterbalance to the saltiness of the burger.\n\nIn addition, service was appropriately friendly and quick. And the place itself, while really busy, was clean and had a nice hang-out vibe to it. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to Super Duper. Maybe it doesn't get as much hype as In-N-Out or Shake Shack because of a more limited and straightforward offering, or a more low key approach. Whatever the case, it definitely isn't because of the burger itself, because that was outstanding. I'm from Toronto and my heart will always belong to Holy Chuck and it's daily-ground burgers over there. But when visiting the US, I'll skip the more hyped up burger joints and head straight to Super Duper the next time.", "author": "David Y."}

They have an open kitchen and I've sat at the counter three times to observe-- on all three occasions, my fries were sitting there for 5 minutes or more until served and not under a heat lamp (they don't have one). In other words, the fries are made in advance before your burger is ready instead of per order simultaneously. \n\nIn order to be objective and write a fair review, I've given this place three attempts.

This is definitely one of those places that you have to specify if you want the meat well done or not (a couple times there was some pink still), and the lettuce gets soggy WAY too fast so if you're ordering to-go, just don't order lettuce at all or ask that they put it on the side. Avocado is a must to balance out the savory flavors. \n\nAnd now for the subject most people wait to hear about: The Fries. Well don't hold your breath because the fries are a joke, and anyone who 'raves' about the fries just doesn't have good taste. They just don't go well with the burgers and a few times they overcooked my fries. \n\nMilkshakes (not real ice cream, but soft serve) are pretty good but if you're ordering, have them wait to do the milkshake until AFTER the food is ready because it's no fun spoiling your appetite sucking down the milkshake they immediately make and serve because you're waiting for the food lol.", "author": "Marquis A."}

It was close to 4pm and having driven from Sacramento on an empty stomach, I was on the verge of getting hangry. Not only was Super Duper open, we anticipated a long wait due to the long line and tables still waiting for their food. However, we were lucky enough to find a table and food was brought to us in no more than 10 minutes. While in line, a regular showed me the ropes and told me about the self serve jarred pickles. Huge shout out to him because I loooooove pickles and I totally would have missed it if he hadn't warned me! Shh, I went back for thirds. But only because I was sharing. :)\n\nLike I said, I was hungry so I ordered the works! A mini burger with combozola blue cheese, a fried egg and sliced mushrooms with garlic fries and a beer.  Ok I lie, I'd order the works on the regular, whether or not I was hungry. That's the only way foodies know how! Anyway, if I had to choose between In and Out, Shake Shack and Super Duper........that would be the utmost torture. No, nevermind, not even going there. I'm not going to make that choice if I don't really have to.  It's just that good! \n\nI also must add, management is great at this location. It was a bit chaotic but the lady at the register was calm, patient and knew to how to keep the pace going at the same time. My burger was also presented with a smile, literally! Check out my photo.

Maybe I recently had a really good burger elsewhere, or maybe the cooks were having a bad day. All I can say, is that I was unimpressed with my visit this time (not my first time at the rodeo). I order the Super burger combo: double patty burger cooked medium well, fries, and a coke. It was good, but there was nothing spectacular. There's been times where I'm sad when I finish my burger someplace; this was not one of those times. Overall, good for a quick bite and if you're craving a decent burger, but I wouldn't be overly excited about coming here again. Does that sound harsh? Maybe.

I go in during an odd weeknight on a rainy evening an hour before closing time.\n\nMy first time. I'm greeted with high ceilings, some woodwork, two counter/bar areas - one with a view out the window the other toward the grill. Toward the back are tables for large groups.\n\nMusic plays just loud enough to keep anybody over 40 years old out. Tourists, regulars and bar goers are here. \n\nI order the smaller burger combo. Grab a self serve soda as I wait. Although I didn't try it I noticed a real ice tea option. That is something I would normally drink so I appreciated that - I just wanted the sugary cola this night.\n\nThe place has few patrons so I get my burger super fast. Its different - this is no Nations burger. The bun has a little something substantial that you can bite into... but still... you could give this to grandma and her dentures wouldn't pop out. Don't worry about though - remember the music a touch louder than what people over 40 would care to hear? She wouldn't be in here anyway.\n\nThe meat itself was juicy just as expected. It was cooked just perfectly too. I didn't make any special requests and it had a touch of pink - beautifully done... not cooked to death.\n\nThe ketchup had a different flavor from the normal Heinz. Neither good nor bad. Just different. The sauce on the burger different too.... I wish I had tried one of their homemade pickles... the whole theme with this burger spot was that its unique and great.\n\nI see people here on Sunday mornings under the covered patio. Probably a great alternative to waiting for 2 hours at Mommas for weekend brunch. Would like to try their breakfast.\n\nAgain, for the time I went and what I ordered 5 stars easily. The 2-3 guys working top notch. Squeeky clean bathroom. Excellent value, especially for this neighborhood. I'm sure even during a busy time the guys working here would push out food in as timely a manner as possible and you can grab a beer while you wait.\n\nIf your a senior bring some ear plugs :)", "author": "Stefan T."}

I must admit that in a span of three days, I ate here three times. I had dinner one night (super combo), had breakfast the following day and a super combo again the next day. It's addicting, I'm not even gonna lie. \n\nThe super combo comes with fries and a drink (I got the swirl shake, which was good and had a bit of a malty texture), and the burger comes with double patties and cheese. If you order it with everything, then they add red onions, lettuce and tomatoes. You can also add (for free) jalape\u00f1os, grilled onions and pickles. If you like pickles, definitely get their homemade pickles. Even if you don't like pickles, try them. They're really good. \n\nI really want to know what they do to their burgers. They're soooo juicy! Like ridiculously juicy. I had burger juice dripping all over my hands and it was amazing. It wasn't juicy like from fat because it didn't feel greasy, so that's great. I ate my burger over my fries so they'd soak up some of that amazingness. \n\nTheir breakfast is good and super affordable. For $5.50 you can get an egg sandwich on an English muffin, a mini donut and a drip coffee. For a couple of dollars more, you get to add bacon or sausage to your sandwich and you get two extra mini donuts. Of course, I got the \"deluxe\" combo and got bacon on my sandwich - because, bacon. Their sandwich was yummy and I stuffed in some of their pickles for umami perfection. Their mini donuts are really good. Fluffy with a lightly fried exterior and I preferred the chocolate glazed over cinnamon coated. \n\nOverall, everything was great. I always stopped by the Marina location because they were opened the latest from all the other locations, which best suited my needs. \n\nThank you SDB for ruining other burgers for me and please consider opening a location in LA so you can show them what a juicy burger is.", "author": "Jonnathan B."}

What I didn't know until this past weekend is that they serve breakfast sandwiches too. Amazing. \n\nI was on my way to a completely different restaurant on Saturday when I saw the breakfast sandwich menu which stopped me in my tracks. I'm a sucker for an english muffin sandwich and wasn't terribly hungry so, this was a perfect stop. The menu has three different combos where are all super reasonably priced ($5, $6, $7) and they all include a cup of four barrel coffee. I mean, brilliant. Our local chain of burgers (Super Duper) has partnered with my favorite coffee roaster on planet earth...mind blown. \n\nPro tip: The cup of coffee is only $2.25 making it the cheapest/best cup of coffee in the Marina. \n\nOn to the sandwich. Nothing crazy, pretty basic but, fresh and flavorful. You can customize it to your liking and I opted for bacon and avocado which were solid choices. I opted out of the donut that comes with most of the combo meals and that was a huge mistake. Needless to say I'll totally be back for the combo soon.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

I sure did... sigh... \n\nI mean, it's not as bad as places that have lame banners saying that they were \"voted-#1-burger-in-the-city\" or that plaster their interior d\u00e9cor saying that they were \"voted best by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" like the arrogant bastards at Five Guys. But like an overhyped movie, Super Duper Burger felt more like a Super Dupey Burger... and in my case a Super Salty Burger. \n\nSo contrary to its name, my experience with Super Duper Burger was anything but super duper. The main issue that I had was that whoever cooked my mini-cheeseburger overseasoned it with way too much salt to the point that it was super duper salty. After just a few bites, I needed to refill my soda because I could feel my kidneys failing.\n\nMaybe it is because I went with the mini-cheeseburger, but I observed no \"juicyness\" to my burger as Super Duper claims. They claim that their burgers are juicy because their cows are fed vegetarian diets etc etc etc... But yea, my burger was dry. Then again, maybe all the salt in my burger dried it out the way salt shrivels up snails. \n\nAs for the fries - wait for it - they were also overseasoned. Too much freaking salt. Tossed them after eating only a handful.\n\nThe best part of the meal had to be the not-so-salty pickles. The bonus being that they are complimentary. \n\nFor being in The City the prices aren't too bad.

I'm a fan of Super Duper Burgers and the restaurant group behind this chain. These guys have the Midas touch. Every restaurant they open turns into culinary gold (eg Lolinda, Starbelly, Beretta, Uno Dos Tacos, etc.). \n\nThat's why my recent Super Duper visit was such a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger. But they completely botched my order, and I was literally the only one waiting in line (so it wasn't like the kitchen was slammed or anything).\n\nI was particularly hungry this day, so I opted for the Super Burger (Two 4 oz. patties, with Super Sauce) to go and requested all the toppings (lettuce, tomato, onions, jalape\u00f1os, pickles, etc.). What I like about Super Duper is that they cook all their burgers to-order, so you know you're getting something hot off the grill. 10 minutes later, my sandwich was ready and I was on my way out the door. Unfortunately, I was already on the road when I unwrapped my burger, only to discover that my burger had none of the toppings I requested. It was just 2 over-salted beef patties, a wilted piece of lettuce, and a tomato. No secret sauce, no condiments, no pickles, no flavor.. nothing. By the time I discovered how dry and barren my burger was, it was too late for me to drive back. Not sure how the kitchen botched this one. Perhaps something was off with their POS system. I don't know. \nAt the end of the day, it was just $8 out of my pocket (so not a huge loss). That being said, there are plenty of enticing burger options in the market right now. For example, I could've easily gone to In 'N Out and ordered a Double-Double (animal-style) for half the price. So yeah, I was a little bummed out by my burger experience. I'm going to chalk it up to them just having an off-day (which we all have). And I will definitely give them another try down the road.", "author": "Kevin B."}

I'm not opposed to grease (and it's to be expected on a burger) but being able to collect it on a plate is another level. \nThe fries were really good and they either use a ketchup that I've never tasted before or they make their own. \n\nGive it try!\n\nSuper Duper Burger, fountain drink and fries ($15.01)\n\nPros: Good ingredients, cook to order, fast, friendly staff\nCons: Gressy, drink selection, variety", "author": "Miguel M."}

The quality of the patty here is really good, juicy and obviously fresh. The topping choices are great. I love blue cheese, but don't usually get it on a burger because it overwhelms everything else. Problem solved here: the blue is Cambazola, mild and melty and perfect.\n\nThe other toppings were very fresh, and those pickles! They are serve-yourself from a pickle jar, so you're given the opportunity to fully load up. Take that opp; the slightly-sweet, not-too-sour, extra crunchy pickles make a great addition to your burger or a palate cleanser in between bites.  \n\nFries were great, and we had a side of the chipotle sauce which was an excellent addition. The spice level on the sauce was just right, enough to give the fries some zing but not so much that it killed your taster for that wonderful burger. \n\nThis was a great stop.

This is my new SF lunch spot.  Everything from the meat, to the ice cream is organic.  Except for the ketchup (more on that later).  I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was the best ckn/sanmiche I have ever eaten, hands down!  Customer service was great as well.  \n\nNow the ketchup. Super Duper Burgers being mostly organic, I was surprised to learn that they were using Heinz Ketchup.  This ketchup has lots of very dangerous chemicals in it.  On top of that, Heinz's tomatoes are 100% GMO.  NOT GOOD!  Had I known this before I ordered my French fries, I would of not ordered them. But speaking with one of the employees, he told me that they make a special organic sauce for dipping fries in.  So I will try that next time.  But definitely at all cost, stay away from Heinz ketchup.  I hope Super Duper trashes Heinz and gives us customers a more healthy organic ketchup.  Looking forward to my next visit.  6's.\n\nUpdate:  I have been meaning to update this review for awhile now.  I went back to Super Duper a couple of months after my first vist.  To my surprise, I noticed that they changed their ketchup from the poisonous Heinz, to an all organic, non GMO ketchup (Sir Kensington's Ketchup).  Very healthy, and tasty.  Huge difference in taste, and even looks like real tomato ketchup.  It has texture!  Not a creamy paste.  I must have eaten there a hundred times since.

It came with fries, a burger and a drink. This was plenty for me although I wasn't especially hungry.\n\nThe fries were OK. They were cut thin but not as thin as say McDonald's. They weren't as salty as most but that was easily remedied with ketchup and the sachets of salt in the store. I liked eating them but I wasn't impressed -- they were of completely standard quality.\n\nThe burger on the other hand was fantastic. The vegetables on it were fresh and in just the right ratios. The red onion was especially good. The patties were tasty and extremely juicy, so juicy that the toasted bun was pretty soaked on the bottom. This made for a delicious but very greasy burger. \n\nThis great burger had two flaws. First and most importantly, the sauce wasn't quite as flavourful as it could have been. The flavour it did have was very nice and added a little complexity to the taste, but it wasn't very strong. I added ketchup to my burger to make it a bit flavourful. The other quibble I had was that I had to manually add pickles to my burger. The pickles were scrumptious and really improved the burger. My complaint is that I'm sure there are customers missing out on this because they don't realise there are pickles in the store.\n\nThe drink was just a standard fountain drink. I wanted root beer but they didn't have a very expansive selection at the fountain so I got coke zero. Oh well.\n\nAll in all, it was a great meal let down slightly by the somewhat forgettable fries.

Don't be fooled by the \"mini\", it's actually a normal sized burger, and a tasty one at that!\n\nSuper Duper's artisanal buns and sustainably-farmed vegetarian fed beef (ground daily) comes with a TON of free toppings, including: lettuce, tomato, red onions, jalape\u00f1o peppers, and grilled onions. For an extra $1: you can add avocado or roasted portobello, and for an extra $1.50: a fried egg! While I did need more than one set of napkins to contain the juice that spilled out of my burger, it tasted amazing. It's like a fancier In-N-Out with more options, such as chicken sandwiches, veggie burgers, and salads. For the hungrier folks out there, you can double the meat patties for a Super Burger! \n\nWhile the price tag of $5 for a mini burger ($5.50 with cheese) is a little high by fast-food standards, it's a great price for a quality casual sit-down. If you do stop by, I highly recommend trying the garlic fries which come topped with melted aged cheddar, as well as a kid size dipped and swirled organic soft-serve cone to end your meal!", "author": "Christine L."}

Thanks to my Yelp friend Noelle J., I had this place bookmarked before my recent trip.\n\nUsing only compostable packaging materials and serving 100% Niman Ranch beef from sustainably raised cattle, Super Duper is an environmentally friendly restaurant which also embraces the farm to table concept.\n\nThe MINI BURGER COMBO ($9.25, including fries and a fountain drink) could sound misleading as it is actually a 4-ounce patty, which is equivalent to a quarter pounder.  Together with fries, this is usually enough food for most people, especially for lunch.  So this is not really \"mini\" at all.  Those with a big appetite can order the super burger which has 2 patties and is a half-pounder.\n\nThe patty was well seasoned and very tasty .  There's a good balance in the seasoning that it doesn't overwhelm the natural flavors of the beef.  The beef patty was awesome -- I could taste that it's high quality beef.  Cooked medium, juicy but only slightly greasy, this is almost as good as you can get.  The \"super sauce\" dressing was slightly tangy and really yummy;  although it could make the burger a little messy.  But hey, a good burger is supposed to be messy, right?\n\nThis is definitely one of the most memorable burgers that I've had.  It is more expensive than most fast food and even higher end order-at-the-counter places, but it's worth every penny.\n\nDowntown San Francisco.  Cable cars.  Market Street.  Union Square.

When I went to go pick up my order everything that I wanted on my burger was not on it..so she screwed up my order by not listening. Poo. \n\nSecond time.. I ordered a combo with the 3 dips.. When I got my food the 3 dips weren't in the bag. I walked up to the person working the counter && asked for the dip. He asked me if I paid for them.. I was pretty offended.. Seeing that I already paid $10-12 for the combo...I for surely wouldn't be trying to get over on them for their extra $1.50.. He then had to go into the register, pull up my order to verify if I had actually paid for it.. A total waste of my time for their screw up.. \n\nThis morning.. I had a little extra time before my shift && they were still serving breakfast.. I decided to give it a go. I ordered a egg sandwich + avocado && a small coffee.. My total came out to $7.44.. Then as I'm reading the special I see I could've gotten the same thing plus donuts && a large coffee.. I was a bit taken back at the fact that the cashier didn't point out the special && try to up sell me && then I left feeling a little hoodwinked because for an extra 50 cents I could've gotten a better deal.

I prefer the garlic to be toasted and my fries double-fried, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  \n\nSOMEBODY TELL ME WHO DOES IT THAT WAY IN SF PLEASE!!!  NOT THIS PLACE!\n\nAbout that raw garlic flavor.  I can still taste it.  It's 11:47 in the evening.  I ate at Super Duper at 1:30pm.  I even ate dinner at 5, and I can still.  taste.  raw.  garlic.  C'MON!\n\nSuper garlic flavor aside, this place is a keeper.  Neighborhood vibe was cool.  Service that day was nice.  The outside table we sat in was super clean.  Next time, regular fries...and take it to go.  The Palace or Crissy Field is a short walk away.", "author": "Eileen P."}

The flavors just didn't pop, it was not as juicy as they promised (they say all burgers are cooked medium but mine was definitely medium well, emphasis on the well), and the food took a while to come out. I ordered mine with grilled onions, super sauce (nothing super about it, didn't have much flavor), lettuce, and cheddar cheese. If the burger was a little bit less done and more seasoned, or if the sauce and other toppings had more flavor, this would have been so much better. \n\nI did enjoy my garlic fries- lots of garlic, and a little bit of cheese as well. Really good and cooked perfectly.\n\nMenu here is pretty small- burgers, fries, a few other sandwiches, beer and wine on tap, and shakes. Definitely not my favorite burger by any measure. It was definitely A-OK but I am positive you can find a better burger in San Francisco.", "author": "Seema U."}

It's so juicy and flavorful, and paired with their special sauce AND the red onions make it an extremely flavorful burger. It gets to be a little pricey when you add on other stuff (I always get mine with avocado and bacon), but honestly it's so worth it. And the garlic fries topped with cheese? IT'S JUST ALL AROUND HEAVEN.\n\nThe milkshakes are so delicious, incredibly creamy and frothy and perfect for a hot day.

The newest burger joint is located where the old Johnny Rocket's used to allocated on the busy corner of Chestnut St.\n\nAll Super Duper have great locations including this one. \n\nOf the three locations, the newest site is by far the smallest restaurant. But the restaurant has the great view of the hustling and bustling of Chestnut St. \n\nAgain I ordered the popular Super Duper burger ($6.50) with cheese ($.50 extra) for $7.00. I also get a basket of garlic fries with my burger. The two are my usual and my favorites. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CR5_3AHC-CqySDwOrynxWA?select=DrUbUzsGnQtCxnQL5uysLA\n\nI usually order beer with my burger. But the newest burger joint is waiting for the liquor license, which may take forever. So I ordered the Cookies & Creams milkshake. For $5.00, the pricey milkshake sounds unique and tempting. But no, the milkshake tasted diluted with lumps in the drink. This milkshake is definitely a lousy choice. Not recommended.

We also had some good seats and could see everything being cooked. We both got a super duper burger and fries. The burger was actually one of the best I'd ever had. The patties were the best and everything else on the burger was really great. I'm not sure what was different but the burgers were so much more memorable this time. When I finished my burger I didn't want to keep eating my french fries because I didn't want the taste of the burger to go away. The one thing I'd complain about is their fries.

I'm not a huge Umami Burger fan, and nothing tops In N Out, but I was happy and pleased with my meal here.\n\nWatching my wallet and waistline, I ordered a Mini burger and a fountain soda, no fries. The delicious, fresh, homemade pickles (FREE!) they keep by the drink station piled high in a paper dish were my side dish. And you KNOW I am 100% okay with pickles as a side dish. These pickles are of the dill variety, a little sour and not too salty. \n\nThe burger arrived hot and fresh - they come with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and special sauce but you can also add other toppings for a fee. Mine came sans onions and was packed with flavor for the small size. At first I thought it wouldn't be enough food, but for those with smaller appetites, eyes-bigger-than-stomach syndrome the Mini burger will do just fine - it was filling by the end!\n\nSomething I really liked about Super Duper is that they make it easy to compost all of your waste. They keep only a compost bin by the bus-it-yourself station and all of your leftover food (yeah right) and wrappings, etc. can go in. The metal trays and glasses go in another bin and you're on your way! Something I wasn't a huge fan of was how close together the indoor tables are...I felt like every time I or a neighboring table got in and out  that my a$$ or someone else's a$$ was hovering over the table.

I ordered a Mini Burger with cheese, which is a regular sized burger with one patty, and Garlic Fries.\n\nWhen my meal came, the first thing I noticed was the packaging. None of that brown paper wrap crap. Super Duper Burgers has customized burger wrappers and I loved the simple designs of them. It is so odd talking about presentation when it comes to burgers, but I loved it. The plate of food came neat and presentable--making me more eager to dig in.\n\nThe Mini Burger with cheese was fantastic. The meat was cooked medium and it was just the right portion. I loved that I could actually bite into it, rather than deconstruct it to fit it in my mouth like other places. The products and seasoning they used also made me feel great about eating a burger. Sometimes you leave other establishments feeling guilty or, for the lack of a better word, greasy; but at SDB, I left feeling good about what I ate.\n\nThe Garlic Fries are a must. The cook on the fries were just right--not too soft, not too crispy. You can tell they were fresh and it had just the right amount of garlic aioli seasoned on it.

This is also a good place to go for a real casual date, I guess lol, but I came here with a group of people. We came here after a fun & long day at Crissy Beach (which is only about 10 mins away). Try to get a seat as soon as you can because seating is very limited, maybe have someone order the food & someone else save seas. If you are coming here alone, find someone new to sit next to, make a new friend lol.  SERVICE: The service was good, nothing to complain about & nothing to boast about. FOOD: I ordered a burger with a fried egg in it (I forgot the name). It was good, but I definitely recommend putting the \"super duper sauce\" on it, it gives the burger an actual flavor. We also got a side of garlic fries, I have had better. Overall, I would come back here again & try and tackle the bigger version of the super duper burger, and maybe try a milkshake.", "author": "Cherise N."}

I was in the mood for a burger, so I yelped to confirm the quality of the place and it looked good enough to check out.  The problem was, my wife and daughter were not in the burger kind of mood.  So we went to Crab House on the pier which I didn't complain about. I love that place.\n\nThe next day, however, on the way back from an event up North, we stopped in for a burgerlicious bite to eat.\n\nBURGER:  It was very good, but not great. Better than In n Out, yes...but not better than The Counter if you're familiar with that place.\n\nGARLIC FRIES:  Big let down.  Just your average steak fries with a tiny sprinkling of minced garlic.  Sorry, them ain't garlic fries.  And some Yelpers and RAVING about these fries.  WHAT!!  Who are these people?  And how did they get this badly deprived of good garlic fries.  \n\nThat's all we had--oh, the pickles were a nice touch, but not outstanding.  Just OK.\n\nWhy does it bother me so much that people are going on and on about these garlic fries that just don't rock??  I can only hope that they come across some really tasty garlic fries and then, they will know the truth. :)\n\nBest garlic fries I've ever had, btw, was at Christmas in the Park in San Jose at one of those little catering trucks.  We actually go back every year just for the fries.", "author": "Darien R."}

He originally founded then sold Pasta Pomodoro but now has focused on a parallel track of interesting dining. On one hand you have Lolinda, Delarosa, Starbelly, Beretta and other hand you now have these series of Super Duper's cropping up. \n\nWas looking for some late night eats after seeing a talk and our original pick just closed their kitchen. As we drove around the corner we saw that Super Duper was still open. Headed in with 15 min to spare. Got a burger with bacon, cheese and a huge side of pickles. Meat was flavorful, juicy (the medium by default rocks) and sure hit the spot for a late Sunday. I know that there are a few more of these locales setup ready to open across the city and I think they're a welcome addition for those of us who want some quality in an expedient and/or late night manner.", "author": "Kim N."}

Super Duper's awesome friendly staff & management, superlicious vegetarian burgers (also a portabella mushroom burger that's no longer on the menu but they'll still make for you- that is if they've still got portabella left!), endless homemade pickles, perfectly swirled & curled organic ice cream, tasty garlic fries, upbeat music (from retro soda pop to dance), juicy burgers for my non-veggie family, and quick service without it feeling like \"fast-food\" has me addicted to this place. \n\nMy favorite has to be the vegetarian burger that is far from nasty boca or gardenburger types, which comes with cucumbers & hummus but you must add-on jack cheese & avocado; filling and superlicious. \n\nFor the meat lovers, they make their burgers juicy medium by default so make sure you specify otherwise if that's not your thing, not every meat should be well done. \n\nAfter you've had your burger and you're craving an ice cream swirl, get the kid's size, it's more than enough!

I had heard a bunch of good things about them, and they all turned out to be (mostly) true.  Between my mini burger, the garlic fries, and the service, there wasn't much not to like.  In fact, the worst part of the experience was meeting my friend at the wrong location!  Whoops.\n\nHoping for more of the same, I copied nearly my entire order - a Mini Burger with Jack Cheese and a side order of Garlic Fries.  Unlike last time though, my burger fell short.  The patty didn't seem as juicy or tasty as before, and the burger on the whole just felt dry and overdone.  The only thing that kept the whole meal from being a total bust was the side of Garlic Fries.  They were just as good as I remember!  Each fry was cooked to the perfect crispiness, and there was a ton of aged cheddar cheese.\n\nSuper Duper - even though this trip was a bit of a let down, I can forgive you since you were so good the first time around.  I'm sure you'll see me again, although it's 50/50 whether it will be at this location since parking is such a pain.  Just don't let me down again.", "author": "Mike L."}

I came upon Super Duper before I lived in San Francisco while strolling along Chestnut and now it's definitely my go-to burger spot, especially if I'm a little hungover and I'm craving something greasy and tasty! The first time I came here was with my ex boyfriend, who was super picky and annoying when it came to food, and even he loved it! This place is the best!\n\nI always get the mini burger, which is more than enough burger for me (add cheddar cheese, avocado, and sometimes if I'm feeling extra naughty- bacon!) The \"Super Sauce\" they put on their burgers is \"super\" delicious! The burgers are always juicy and flavorful and taste fresh. My sister and I split the garlic fries usually, and their garlic fries are probably some of my favorite in the city (after AT&T park's of course). They use grass fed beef and organic ketchup, which is cool with me! Their chicken burger is also a tasty option, but honestly unless they run out of beef or you're a vegetarian, just stick with the burger. Organic ice cream cones to finish off your meal! \n\nThe staff here at the Chestnut location is the nicest of all the Super Dupers in my opinion.

I originally wanted to go to Squat and Gobble, but it being Sunday, of course everybody and they mamas was there! So I trekked on to find a good hearty meal, and I stumbled upon Super Duper burger. I've been seeing it all over peoples IG's lately, and I was like whaaaaaaaat! COOOOOOOL. So I got in line, ordered a mini cheeseburger with garlic fries and the 3 sauces totaling to about $12\n\nThe mini cheeseburger was good. I'm not much of a burger connoiseur, and I don't usually crave or prefer burgers, so my opinion on the burger should not be too heavily weighed. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't blow my socks off. Maybe if I had added bacon, it would have. Actually, Im sure it would have. But that's what I knocked one star off for. Anyhoo. The garlic fries.\n\nTHE GARLIC FRIES.\n\nAre amazeballs. The best garlic fries I've had. I'm gonna say it.... they might even be better than the ones at AT&T Ball Park. There aren't actually pieces of garlic in it, so I'm guessing the oil they cook it/smother it with is just pure garlicky goodness. \n\nThe sauces that you pay $1.50 extra for, skip on dat. It aint necessary.\n\nBut the GARLIC FRIES...Yes. Just Yes.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

That ownership means a lot and it reflects in the way things are run at that location. \n\nMy only gripe might be the napkins not at the table or more importantly a bigger beer selection !!!

Once I picked it up though, the lust went to disgust. A puddle of grease surrounded my double burger (2 4oz patties). Tons of grease dripped off the burger and I showed my woman. She was grossed out and made that sour face that pretty women make. The thing looked incredible with avocado, bacon, and cheddar but unfortunately tasted incredibly average. Nothing really noteworthy here, just all size. Flavor wise a huge disappointment. The sauce is mostly mayo and ultimately a waste of calories.

We got the Super Duper burger (two 4 oz patties), which seems like a play on the In n Out double double.  Both the burger and fries were average. The draw to Super Duper was more centered around the old school diner decor. There are many better burger joints on Chestnut/in the Marina.\n\nThe highlight was the homemade pickles, which are available on a serve yourself basis. They were really good! They let them marinade for 24 hours and then serve them in the restaurant. This makes for really crunchy pickles that you won't find in your ordinary jar of Vlasic pickles.\n\nSuper Duper also does a good job of using environmentally friendly products.

The meat is tender and they taste fresh, although at times I've found them to be a little too greasy.   They offer a good variety of toppings and the house made pickles are especially good.  The fries are delicious as well, but best consumed quickly as they can get a bit soggy in short order.  \n\nThe soft serve ice cream is also good and forms the basis for their shakes and malts.  While advertised as organic, I can't really tell the difference between it and any other soft serve save for the higher price.  In fact if there is a downside to the whole Super Duper experience that's it; the prices are a bit high across the board.  \n\nAnother complaint would be the setup for takeout orders.  After standing in a line that stretches out the door if more than 5 people are waiting ahead of you, food orders are picked up from one side of the restaurant and drink orders from the other, requiring you to cut back and forth through that same crowded line.  \n\nOverall I'd say Super Duper offers a solid burger experience at a so-so value.", "author": "Kit J."}

My friend and I got to watch the cooks make a lot of fresh-made-by-order burgers. Everything was so fresh. The patties were freshly cooked and not pre-cooked like McDonalds. The fries were freshly fried in small batches.\n\nWe got our orders delivered to us by the waitress. The garlic fries were crunchy with grated cheese on top. So yummy! They don't squash the burgers like they do at Burger King or McDonalds. Instead, they only wrap half the burgers so that they are not flattened. My friend loved her Super Burger, and I loved my Chicken Sandwich. The veggies (tomatoes, lettuce, and red onions) were super fresh and moist. Super tasty. \n\nWhile my friend and I tried to take pictures, the waiter even offered to take our picture for us. He was super friendly and nice! While we ate, I can see that he was always working, walking around to see which counters need clean up. The workers here are definitely very hard working and friendly.", "author": "Elise C."}

After giving it more than enough chances, I can honestly say the burgers here are nothing special.  Is it an upgrade over Johnny Rockets (which occupied the space before)?  Sure.  But as far as burgers go, I have yet to bite into one and think I was experiencing something extraordinary.  Maybe that was due to expectations.  It's not a bad or bland burger.

If you're looking for a burger around Chestnut, Barney's is a better choice.  If you're looking for the best burger in the Marina, it's probably between Balboa or Umami Burger (please don't get me started on Roam).  \n\nSuper Duper isn't bad.  It's just not great.

You start with a mini burger (1 patty, $5) or super burger (2 patties, $7) and choose from an assortment of free toppings (lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalape\u00f1o, grilled onions, pickles) and add-ons (cheese, bacon, avocado, roasted portobello, egg, cambozola blue).  Ranging from .50 to 1.50, the add-ons can add up quick.  There are other items on the menu like chicken sandwiches, veggie burgers, salads, shakes, fries, and soft serve cones.  So many options and combinations made for staring at the menu for 5 minutes this first visit.\n\nI (finally) opted for a mini burger and garlic fries, and the bill came to $9.24 - slightly expensive.  The burger was dripping with grease and the fries were more cheesy than garlic-y, but the flavors and presentation were solid. The chipotle aioli added a subtle kick of spice, the aged cheddar on the garlic fries brought depth to compliment the garlic, and the zesty pickles diffused all that saturated fat I was probably ingesting ;) \n\nBottom line: if you're craving for that all-American favorite, Super Duper Burgers is a decent place to go.", "author": "Amy T."}

This isn't your typical cookies & creme milkshake as the cookie ingredients are homemade cookies rather than Oreos (remember this place is all organic). It tasted pretty good. The shake was not thick but had a good amount of creamy texture. You don't have to wait for the shake to melt a little to start drinking it.\n\nThe burger itself was very appetizing. The Super is 8 ounces of meat and it comes in the form of two patties. The patties are on the saltier side but I enjoy salty flavors. The sesame bread bun was buttered and toasted to a nice crisp. The lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, super sauce and avocado paired subtly with the entire burger. Nothing to overpowering in taste, just right. One of the best parts was the bacon.

Shake Shack being awesome and worth the prices and half hour waits for fast food, I knew I had to try to Super Duper. \n\nWhat a disappointment. I had a cheeseburger and fries. I would have rather gone to McDonald's. The patty was overcooked. The bun tasted stale and old. The fries I got were all the little bits and scraps you would get at the bottom of a bag--maybe because it was late and the staff didn't want to make new fries? \n\nI felt bad because my boyfriend and I were ragging pretty hard on our meal. A tourist seated nearby asked us if this was not a good burger. He was from Eastern Europe and until he overheard us he thought that this was the best burger he'd ever had.

I went there last night while bar hopping, and the burger I had was excellent.  I had a mini burger, and it was everything that a burger should be.\n\nThere are three main elements that I consider in a burger: the patty, the bread, and the fixins.  The beef patty was delicious.  Seriously, it was amazing; everything was right about the patty.  In my opinion, the bread is just as important as the patty, and they toasted their sesame bread perfectly, which made it crunchy yet still bread-y. Finally, the fixins.  Most burger joints over do it with toppings or throw on a nasty slab of iceberg lettuce.  They placed the toppings nicely on it, which actually complemented the burger as a whole. (I didn't though have any secret sauce, because I am not a huge mayo fan.)\n\nI can be pretty pretentious about my burgers, and it is RARE that I admit that I enjoyed a burger as much as a I did, so I really have no idea why there are so many low ratings.

Be sure to bring your own mints if you plan on having the garlic fries, unless you don't plan on returning back to work.\n\nThe mini-version was perfect for me.

She asked for onion but when her burger arrived, it had none. She also asked for the \"Super\" 8-oz size but they served her a 4-oz \"Mini.\" After realizing this, she sent it back and they politely made her a \"Super\" with onion.\n\nWhen we picked up the burgers, grease literally spilled out from the wrapping and pooled on our tray. The beef and bun were doused in oil and both lacked any resemblance of taste. I could have gone to Safeway, grabbed some ground beef, and thrown it on a skillet to get the exact same result. Very disappointing considering how delicious the burgers are at Roam only a few blocks/bucks away. \n\nWe also picked up some garlic fries, thinking they would be similar to those served at Pac Bell Park.

For an extra dollar, you can get 2 of their homemade sacues: susper sauce, homemade mayo and chipotle\n\nI love that they have something for everyone and are willing to make the extra effort.

If you have a large appetite, I suggest  ordering the signature 2 patty namesake, the mini just won't cut it. It's pretty much the size of a cheeseburger at you local in and out. Toppings are quite limited and don't contribute much to size.  Their fries share a similar texture to those found at in and out, crispy and crunchy.\n\nI really enjoyed the fact that burger patties are made to order and not defrosted. You can actually see the cooks frying them. Made there right in front of your eyes, theres not much to worry about except maybe that beef could be leaner, my wrapper had quite a bit of grease on it. \n\nService is cordial and pretty efficient. \n\nTip#1 get the garlic fries, way way way more flavorful than simple fries\n\nTip#2: If you don't mind splurging a little, add an EGG to your mini sandwich. It reduces red meat content and still gives you the same amount of protein at a fraction of the calories! It's also less expensive than the two patty meat overload. My cousin and sister tried it and loved it!!!! Hot tip******\n\nTip 3: soft serve is organic and very rich. Two people should probably share one  regular size cone. They are very big. I ordered a mixed chocolate and vanilla combo, the chocolate was a bit overwhelming for me but the vanilla was simply delectable! Highly recommended.\n\nTip 5: chiles included in sandwiches are quite spicy so be sure to order them on the side.\n\nOverall, food is decent and fresh but a bit pricey for the small servings.", "author": "Sue T."}

It was last week when I was passing Super Duper Burgers that I saw they had a portobello sandwich, and I dreamt about the ones from my trip to New York from Shake Shack (drool). So I looked up their menu once I got back to the office and decided that I should try it, though it will definitely not be up to SS standard. \n\nI just finished off my portobello sandwich and one word describes it: YUM! I got it to my liking too: no onions or tomatoes, with jalapenos please. The bread was incredibly soft and the \"secret sauce\" was just enough. The garlic fries are on point, not a huge serving (I love to eat, but I can't eat a lot). Wish I got a spiked milkshake to complete my meal, but there's next time. I brought my lunch back to the office, but the restaurant itself was clean and bright.\n\nI hope to try a real burger once I get off this diet!\n\nI was able to pay for my food and get back to the office within 5-8 minutes.

That's not so much of an issue when the foods great, or good, or fills a niche.  But when the burgers are \"just\" better than fast food, when the fries are dumped in a little fast food tray with abandon, and when for the life of them they can't serve a chocolate dipped ice cream without it dripping oily black streams of unsolidified chocolate down your hands and onto your tight button fly jeans, I don't know what to say.\n\nKids and families?

No on the later. Let's do this.\n\nRound 1: No hummus. Plenty of special sauce.\n\nRound 2: No hummus.

It had been my first time in 6 years since my  tongue has even touched an animal. I should've checked the patty just to be on the safe side but since I was careless at the time, I ended up taking a bite of beef. Immediately to my horror, I spit the disgusting piece out. Unfortunately they didn't comp the meal and only switched the burger, but at least it's something...Anyways I give this place four stars because their veggie burger is amazing and it doesn't taste like a bocca burger patty from the freezer. I love it when places like this put effort into making a veggie burger rather than heating it up. Also the best thing on their menu is the cookie shake - there's actually pieces of cookies in the shake! It's so delicious!!! The only bad thing about this shake is that its unaffordable but all in all, \nI really like this place but vegetarians beware!! \nMAKE SURE THE PATTY ISN'T MEAT.", "author": "Susie N."}

Grease rolls down your hands and you quickly put down the burger before the grease soaks into your sleeves.  You wipe your hands and your brand new napkin is already completely soaked in grease.  But that bite was so delicious that suddenly you don't care that grease is rolling down your arms and dribbling from your chin.  You take another bite and the yolk from the fried egg bursts over the meat.  When you finish eating, you unbuckle your belt because your stomach is bulging over your pants and you can't breathe.

Firstly, I don't eat burgers because I refuse to eat factory lot beef or chicken.  A sustainable burger - right up my alley!   My niece ate a mini burger, it was juicy and full of flavor.  The fries were perfect, and the milkshakes were to die for, perfectly thick and still drinkable through a straw.  The salad was great also, fresh and a pretty good serving size for the price.  While the service and staff were a little disorganized because it was their first day I am certain that will smooth itself out.  Hey, if you are expecting five star service go and pay for a five star meal.   I will be back.", "author": "D B."}

The chicken was a dud, but I thought I would give it another chance since the garlic fries were amazing.  So I went back a second time and ordered a super duper burger, which was superduperlicious!  For $2 more than the mini u get double the amount of meat, but I forgot about the law of diminishing returns.  I'm not sure how great it is to have extra meat, if u can't eat it!  Plus, I had to save room for the garlic fries!  This is a great place to go if u want to sabotage your diet!", "author": "michele k."}

I love the freshness of each patty, and the various options that you can add to make it your own.  It isn't comparable to the more upscale Umami burger, but I think this place is better than Five Guys.  The burger that I recently ordered was the Mini Burger adding Bacon, Avocado with just Spread and Red Onion.  The ending result = DELICIOUS.  Bacon makes everything better, and avocado is one of my most favorite things to top off any burger/sandwich.  The decadence of the combination was tasted in each bite and had me wanting more after it was long over.  I love their french fries and think they're much better than In N Out and Five Guys.  I wasn't a fan of the lemonade, I was expecting something a little sweeter rather than sour/tart.  I've gone to Super Duper for my lunch hour down in the Financial District on Market, and I'm always in food coma afterwards.  This is much better for dinner than for lunch.

At first glance i couldn't tell if it was open, or still under construction. There was a  mass of people, just everywhere, and they weren't customers either. I'm not positive about food safety laws, as they tend to change periodically, but im almost positive that if your not in uniform, you shouldn't be around food. THe girls weren't wearing hats or nets and the male weren't either. \n\nMy EXPERIENCE: When I walked in, i wasn't greeted with a hi, or a smile, instead i was confused as i couldn't tell who was working there and who was a customer. Then  guy greeted me and acted as if he was going to take my order, but instead told me that the guy next to him will. At that point i had already made up my mind on what i wanted to eat, it sounded so good...The order taker wasn't friendly at all. While he was about to take my order he was interrupted by two employees tying to clock in, which is fine i get it, they need to start working but he wasn't like it will just be a sec sorry for that or, what can i get started for you, no i was completely ignored. Then i proceded to ask what came on the burger, and if they could tell me if their sauce had pickles, considering that i am allergic to pickle, this was crucial information. The guy ignored my question the first time, i had  to ask twice more. After a brief explanation, I proceeded to order a mini cheeseburger with lettuce tomato, mayo and jalapenos and ketchup, he asked if i wanted onion, and i said yes grilled.  And an order of Garlic Fries.\n*10 minutes later* \nI get my food, and it wasn't what i asked for, first of all, the bun was cold, it had their sauce on it, the onions weren't grilled, and there weren't any jalapenos. i go up to the counter to ask for some and they guy doesn't wash his hands and just grabbed some form the container...gross. Then i realized, i crap this is their sauce i cant eat this, so i take the burger back, and they make me a new one, cool thanks, i get my burger, they put the sauce in he side... i thought i said NO sauce,  the onions aren't grilled and the bun is still cold. There must be a language barrier. none the less i eat my burger. it was flavorful but WAY greasy...not to be confused with juicy. \nI wont be returning to this place, first impressions are everything. If i could give the owners a word of advice, if you promote a SUPER DUPER burger, make sure there is SUPER DUPER service as well. and while i think its great that most everything is compostable, its not enough to bring me back.Maybe try working out the kinks before opening to the masses,  like the broken computer, the non working beer on tap, oh and the customer service training.I will not be returning To this or any location.

Sharp, metallic looking furniture and signs. The place is fairly new, only open for about a month. The menu is fairly simple: burgers, fries and milkshakes. I ordered the double burger, not sure of the name though. I also ordered a basket of garlic fries. My order came out to a little over 10 dollars.\nI pulled up a seat at the bar and watched the cooks making fries and grilling the hand pressed patties as I waited for my food. The food came quick. I unwrapped my burger. The bottom bun must have been taking a bath in the fry oil because that thing was soaked! I've never seen a greasier burger. You know when you have to dab the grease off of a pizza with a napkin because its so greasy? It was that greasy. At that point I would have put down the burger and just ordered a milkshake if I was willing to pay 6 dollars for one! The burger had no flavor to it. I make better cheeseburgers!

I love the self serve pickles, the perfectly cooked fries, the soft buns, and the flavorful burgers themselves.  I order mine with the spicy aioli they put on their chicken sandwiches - it goes so perfectly with the burger. My only criticism is their homemade lemonade - don't care for it.  But for burgers and fries - YUM YUM YUM.", "author": "Kristine S."}

Yea, the lines are long, but common, 6 dollars for a gourmet burger?  You also can't beat the garlic fries.  This place is usually packed, but for a good reason.  In my opinion the lines here move considerably fast.  The service here has been spot on every time I've come here, and I come here rather frequently since I like to stuff my face with artery clogging juicy double patty beef-o-liciousness... that, and I live rather close to this location.  Chestnut Yelpers don't like it very much when they don't have it their way.. I think they should loosen up a little because this place definitely deserves no less than 4 stars.", "author": "Darren H."}

I never write reviews on yelp but this place definitely deserves some recognition. The cashiers were very nice and the service was lightning quick.

Being that I was pregnant, their burger was the 2nd best I ever had. (First best of course is Kalbi Burger in L.A.) They know what well-done means - no pink meat. Rarely do restaurants comprehend that term. I got the super duper with cheese and a portobello patty, fries, and a chocolate shake. My oh my, it was greasy, juicy, and most important, scrumptious.

That being said this place has the \"Best Burger for your Buck,\" at $6.50. Basic menu with build your own options.Free-formed 8oz patty very juicy, perfectly medium well cooked, and tasty on a fresh cut bun. Burgers are not cooked on open flame but are cooked on a griddle. (Charcoal and wood chips makes major taste difference to me.) Fries are nothing special, next time I will try the garlic fries. They make good milkshakes and have a good beer selection on tap. Nice, casual and busy place to grab a quick bite and people watch on Chestnut.", "author": "Trev D."}

The burger was no where a mini burger, it was more like a 1/4 pounder, hey no complaints here!  The burger was juicy, very very flavorful!  I normally dunk my burger in ketchup due to the lack of taste, but with this Super Duper Mini burger, I didn't care for any condiments, no ketchup whatsoever! I inhaled that thing in less then 5 minutes!  Service was fast and efficient, staff were really nice and friendly.  The  food, place, staff, all deserve a 5 star!

The fries were over cook. i am shock that this chain can have two other restaurants in the city. I should have been smarter when they posted help wanted sign out in front of their store. oh the service is friendly, but the food is horrible. The owner of this place should have more quality control unless they using business strategy of hooter where they salt everything for customers to buy their dranks.", "author": "Stanley L."}

Since she would not look up at me while I was ordering, she couldn't be sure when I was finished so she kept interrupting me with \"is that it?\" or \"anything else?\". When I ordered a \"super duper\" burger she took the order as a mini and kept insisting that's what I wanted. I said no, I wanted the full size. She then said, in a rather snotty tone, that it was two patties. I am a grown woman who was rather hungry at the time, I know what I was getting into! Anyway, my advice it to actually hire people who want to be there. No one looked happy to be working there. I get it, I've lived/ worked in the Marina for over 40 years and have worked with the public. It's not an easy place to work and folks around here are not always polite but you still need to put on a face when dealing with the public. Especially a new place. Good luck! Oh, the fries were ok...too garlicky for me. It was Friday, Black Friday...rough day for us retailers!!", "author": "Nicole C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-04", "description": "amazing burgers! super fresh. the meat was perfectly seasoned and really didn't need any ketchup or other condiment, though i did like the special sauce (i asked for it on the side). i like that i can order a small (4 oz) burger as that's all i need. i got bacon and cheese on mine, and lettuce, tomato and onions (grilled, by request). the fries were a bit eh -- they're like in-and-out fries. the soft-serve cone with a choco-dip brought me back to a *real* summer day on the boardwalk back east. sadly, it was just another foggy and grey summer day here in SF, but Super Duper made it a good one. great service, too!", "author": "m r."}

What I discovered was that the milk shakes taste terrible! My niece ordered one and they gave it to her an inch short of the top - I mean if I'm going to pay these prices then I want it full! It didn't matter anyway because it tasted terrible. After one sip my niece (I had a sip too) said -\" this doesn't taste good - it doesn't taste like cookies and cream\". After rolling his eyes the fellow at the counter agreed to switch it out for a basic cone. I had a cone with the chocolate covering - have you ever had peanut butter stuck on the roof of your mouth? This waxy awful chocolate is terrible - don't do it! The ice cream is nothing special either. So come here and you can pay a lot, get subpar food and workers with attitude or you can go to the frozen yogurt place down Chestnut - it's still pricey, but it tastes way better and they actually welcome you! Wow! Imagine that!", "author": "Mary M."}

I come here ALL the time and although I've found the burgers to be slightly bland, the addition of chipotle aioli (instead of the super sauce) does the trick. Unfortunately, I've had a couple bad experiences. Two out of the last four times I went, I ordered everything on it, and they didn't put \"everything on it\" as advertised--because it happened the first time, I double checked the second time w. the girl saying everything on it, and then repeating each ingredient that was supposed to be included. The worst experience, especially being a regular, was when I came in one day and learned that they close at 2am--My friends and I specifically caught a cab home early to make it to Super Duper--get there at 1:50--10 minutes, yes! Wrong--we walk in, the manager says Sorry, we're closed. I said, well I know the sign says 3am but last time I was in here you mentioned you actually close at 2, so we came on time...I'm confused. He literally shrugged, turned and walked away without another word. I was completely shocked--I've never been treated like this in any establishment, let alone by the manager. You've lost my business.", "author": "Claire J."}
