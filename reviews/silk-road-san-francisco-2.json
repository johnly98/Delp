I am used to seeing sad options at a food court and then this one popped up with high ratings and I decided to check it out.\n\nI am not quite sure how to describe this cuisine. It is Asian/Russian themed I guess. They have Russian food like piroshkis, Indian like Pulav and Chinese like dumpling. Doesn't matter where it is from because they were all delicious. Tastes like it is home cooked and healthy. This is their first location and I really hope they do well. Super nice people as well.", "author": "Sunil R."}

I can smell that old fashioned wholesome scent of something my grandmother used to cook up that always started out by saut\u00e9ing minced garlic and chopped onions that would always turn into something super delicious, but not of the garlic and onions but the finished product. I was with my niece and we needed to grab a quick bite to eat before her wushu and I asked if she had ever tried a piroshki before and she said no. She's 8 now and I'm running out of things to share with her that remind me of my own childhood. \n\nI ordered each of us a beef and cheese piroshki thinking 'oh boy she's never tried one before and she's gonna love piroshki's! Well I tried it and it was so dominated by the taste of garlic, microwave heated halfway and the breading very dry and not enough filling that neither of us even finished them. Just tasted awful to me and my niece didn't like it either. I think it even had solid chunks of cooked garlic in it; just gross! The frozen ones at the supermarket taste better! Maybe I'll give this place another try sometime but the piroshki's they have here definitely suck! So two stars for now.", "author": "David A."}

One of the top rated places that showed up on Yelp was Silk Road. \n\nThis kiosk is located inside the foodcourt of Stonetown mall. I arrived a little before 11am and options/stock already seemed to be low. Staff wasn't friendly or very knowledgeable. \n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\nNapoleon ($4.5): I never had a Napoleon before (nor knew what one was). When I saw it on display, I thought it was a cake with a fancy name (it's not - it's a French pastry...according to Google). This was definitely the highlight of my experience/meal! The layers are super flaky and crunchy and the cream is super tasty (like the cream you find in cream puffs). The powdered sugar on top was a nice touch. \n\nChicken Samsa ($3.9): it was okay. Tasted like any normal samosa I've had.  \n\nPotato Piroshki ($3.65): new, cool experience! It's like mashed potato baked/encased into a pastry! Pretty good but my friend mentioned it was too salty. \n\nFood is actually 6.5/10 but the service and variety took a star away. Came for dumplings, couldn't get dumplings. Overall, good option to try if you're looking for a fast, quick bite.", "author": "Ida H."}

The flavors had seeped into the meat and the meat came easily off the bones. I had to ask for some of the tasty soup that the chicken was cooked in and was given a small ladle of it.

Sorabol, Panda Express, and California Crisp - FTW! Hey, I was in high school then and had zero standards when it came to food. The last several years when I tried the food again at my [former] top 3 food court places, it was terrible. No wonder food courts get such a bad rep these days.\n\nI saw Silk Road listed as a \"hot and new\" business on yelp and it piqued my interest (even though it's in the food court at Stonestown) as I've never tried Central Asian Cuisine before. In fact, I think Silk Road is the first semi brick and mortar to serve Central Asian Cuisine in SF (aside from a Uyghur Taamliri, a pop-up at Chug Pub). \n\nOn the menu is Manti (Beef Dumplings), Lamb & Potatoes, Roasted Chicken, Lagman (noodle stew?), Chicken in cream sauce, Plov (rice pilaf), Noodles, and Mashed Potatoes. Choose 2 entrees & 1 side: $8.75 or 1 entr\u00e9e & 1 side for $6 (mini meal). They also sell piroshki, samba (beef \"hot pocket\"), and pastries.\n\nMy friend ordered a mini meal for me of the Lamb & Potatoes w/ plov ($6): http://bit.ly/26f4JQn. Central Asian homestyle, comfort food was the best way to describe my meal. The rice pilaf (plov) was aromatic, flavorful, and delicious but a bit on the oily side. The lamb & potaoes (kuurdak?) tastes very home cooked which I appreciated but the lamb was really tough and the potatoes were a bit undercooked. A small side of what looked to be pico de gallo was provided which needed more acid. \n\nI also tried a bite of the Baked Potato Piroshki ($3.25) and I would never order it again: http://bit.ly/1STNYjD. The potato filling was incredibly salty and the bun was hard (didn't taste fresh). We ended up tossing this after several bites. \n\nFor the price, my mini meal was filling and the plov hit the spot. Silk Road has only been for less than 2 months so they can only get better. I'll definitely be back for more of that plov. Just don't tell me how much fat, oil, and/or butter is in it.

Unfortunately there were more potatoes than lamb.  Felt like an Indian dish, but with less spice.\n\nChicken in Creme Sauce: The creme sauce was amazing!  So rich and so tasty.  Unfortunately they were very stingy with the chicken, like only 5 little strips.  A bunch of mushrooms though.\n\nPlov: Basically a rice pilaf that is heavy on the carrots.  Seemed more exciting that plain rice.\n\nCabbage: Meh, just lightly pickled cabbage in vinegar.  Helped cut the richness of the chicken in creme sauce.\n\nBeef Samsa: Dumpling filling inside of a flaky baked bun.

For my side, I had the plov, which was a spiced rice dish with carrots and beef and very heavy on the cumin flavor. It was slightly oily but nicely spiced, and the grains of rice were perfectly al dente in the center. For the entrees, I got the stuffed bell pepper (filled with a mixture of rice and ground beef) and the central Asian lamb and potato stew. Both of these were decent, though the stuffed pepper felt a little greasy and the lamb was a little bit tough (not the greatest quality meat).

I'd had Silk Road previously and it was \"alright\".  However, I was in a bit of a rush Saturday afternoon and since there was no wait, I gave them a try again.  i had the rice, Central Beef / Potatoes, and a Chicken Cutlet + Chicken Samsa. \n\nUpon a second helping, the food was tasty though the Cutlet needs a knife to eat properly.  The Samsa is a bit salty but I finished it in no time.  The reason mall food gets a bad rap is that it's generally a variation of burgers, Asian, Mexican or Italian.  Silk Road is a good alternative to the options at Stonestown.  Give the folks some business as their food is a different taste but in a good way.", "author": "Donald L."}

I always wonder if this is food court food and already tastes this great, I definitely need to try more. Anyway, I always get the same thing: the plov, roasted chicken in tomato & lagman.

Think of it as food you normally get but with the flavors enhanced and amped up!\n\nThe mini meal is actually quite large and you get an entree, side, and salad that gives you the best of all worlds. The side is a grain (rice or noodles) followed by your meaty entree, and a crisp and tart salad. I recommend the plov+breaded chicken cutlet+ tomato salad combo--a perfect combination of texture and flavor. Think about it: would you rather get this or the run-of-the-mill rice/orange chicken combo you'd normally get at the mall?\n\n**Also ask for the cream sauce atop your chicken cutlet; it adds a whole new creamy dimension to the dish**\n\nI am super impressed and the staff is great as well!
