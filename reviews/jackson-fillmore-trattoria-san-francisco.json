I moved to SF in 1994 :O and this place was already there.  \n\nIt is a neighborhood restaurant, right on the corner of Fillmore and Jackson - thus the name :D brilliant huh?  Fillmore is a busy street with lots of stores so parking is hellish, so if you live in the hood you're better off walking over from where you live.\n\nAmbiance is cozy and friendly, service is good, and the wine list has a good choices.\n\nThe food is good, for American Italian. Jackson Fillmore is not an authentic Italian restaurant, and that is OK, but be warned: because of the American Italian nature of it, they tend to overdo it.  Case in point, in Italy pasta with pesto is typically a very simple dish. If you are lucky and have access to original trofie from Genoa, you add pesto, and you're done. The pesto is already so full of flavor that you really don't need anything else. Distracted by the company's conversation, I ordered the Ravioli al Pesto Genovese.  I did notice that it was ravioli, so I knew that the ricotta cheese filling was going to interfere, but they add green beans, potatoes and fresh tomatoes?? I mean it was OK, but that is the typical overdoing it I was talking about.\n\nAny place with Fra Diavolo anything is not authentic.\n\nAnyway, not bad, I have come here a few times over the years, mostly because some friend really wants to go, but there is better in SF.

I think I have a pretty good sense of the place. \n\nJF belongs in the 4.3 range, but given the options I'm given, it deserves a 5 in this particular rating. Why? Well, context is important: this is your neighborhood trattoria. It's probably not where you're going to get engaged, but it is consistent and excellent for a regular or semi-regular night out that is going to fill you up with great food/wine and won't disappoint.\n\na) Service - helpful, friendly, and just all around very good and decent people. Never had an issue, and they are more than accommodating with kids (even very young ones).\n\nb) Food - this isn't tasting menu type stuff (and that's not a knock), it's  homestyle neighborhood Italian comfort food and knocks it out of the park on that front. Don't miss the zucchini carpaccio. I generally stick with pastas, and on that front the carbonara is deeply satisfying. Don't forget to try the warm and/or cold zabaglione (I them making it a hot fire stove on the way to the bathroom and it was impossible not to order), it's something I haven't seen on many other menus and is delicious.\n\nc) Wine List - extensive and and you can find some great options at reasonable prices.\n\nDownsides? Nothing really negative, just get your expectations in line - it's a neighborhood trattoria, excellent, often rich home-style food and great drink. It (99% sure) used to be a sushi bar and not a ton of $$$ has been spent making it feel particularly Italian or upscale...so if that's a negative for you, so be it. It's not an issue for me!", "author": "W N."}

The special of the evening was a duck chorizo risotto. I had a bite and it was delicious. I ordered the pasta carbonara. Carbonara is my favorite and I was a bit disappointed that it was quite bland. I'm not sure if its because of the way the pancetta was cooked but there was no salty peppery taste that I love. The great ending to this food story was Mama's cheescake also on special. It is hands-down the best cheesecake I've ever had. If you like yours especially whipped, light and not too sugary this is the cheesecake for you.\n\nPrice/Ambiance/Space: 4 stars.

The service was rushed and curt, the food was extremely underwhelming and overall our dinner for 4 was just unremarkable.\n\nTo start, the bruschetta, while complimentary, was as uninspired and tasteless as it could get - a sign of the tastes to come.\n\nBetween the table we shared a number of items including the calamari, seasonal salad and baked artichoke. The calamari was the usual fried fare, the salad was swimming in oil (although the assortment of vegetables including the asparagus and peas were fresh and crisp) and the baked artichoke was bland and oily, too.\n\nFor our entrees I got the seafood stew and the rest of the family ordered a couple of the ravioli dishes and the gnocchi. The tomato-based components for dishes were lacking seasoning and would have been better off coming from a gourmet bottle of sauce from the store. The quantity of seafood was appropriate but none of it tasted fresh.\n\nLocated in a city with fantastic Italian restaurants, Jackson Fillmore Trattoria does itself no favors across its service and food. Between the rushed, ambivalent service and quickly prepared, flavorless food, I sadly have no intention of returning nor recommending it to anyone else.", "author": "Aaron B."}

There's not a lot of pomp and circumstance but for me, this is what makes a local regular spot. That said, I recently attended one of their wine makers dinners and they took it up a notch. I've been allergic to both Gluten and Dairy for 8 years now, and usually with Italian that limits my selection to 1-3 items, so when I called to see if they could accommodate me for their prefix menu I was shocked when they said \"no problem.\" Anyone who has been accommodated at a restaurant usually doesn't have high expectations, as your meal is an afterthought and made of what's left to use. For me this has been the case regardless of menu pricing. Not with Jackson Fillmore. Not only did they create a menu specifically for me, each course fit into the same theme as all other dishes. I left not only full and happy, but also touched that they went out of their way to ensure my experience was just as delightful as guests without accommodations, and having been able to fully experience their culinary vision for the night.

The MVP of the night was definitely the Carpaccio di Zucchini {Julienned zucchini with toasted almonds & pecorino} - a definite must-try! Another dish that must be ordered is their gnocchi! It is prepared in-house, and melts in your mouth. The Gnocchi Gamberi comes with prawns and shrimp in a light tomato sauce, that will fill you up and satisfy the soul. Sitting at the bar, I watched multiple desserts get their final touches and go out to diners, and if I had enough room in my belly, I would have wanted to try every single one! Everything looked light but rich, and the perfect end to the meal. I hate coffee and I even wanted to taste the affogato!\n\nTwo thumbs up to this dining experience. I will definitely be back!

In the past I have always been greeted quickly but despite the place almost empty it took almost 15 minutes for anyone to even say hello.\n\nWe got sat at bar (which I actually like) and our appetizers were good but our entrees were just terrible. All of us had pasta dishes, each were under seasoned and not cooked with the care and love I know this place for. Each one of the sauces were either watery(rather then creamy) or overly oily. Portion sizes for the price was very meager. Every thing (even the apps) was very one note. The pasta tasted frozen and not homemade. The staff seemed very off. Wait staff was polite but clearly something was going on. The kitchen staff looked like the were laughing about something about the wait staff and NOT paying attention to what they were cooking. It almost seemed like the kitchen was a drunk. \n\nThe place had the feel of one of those restaurants on those restaurant rescue shows. At one time was great but now the staff and owner just don't care anymore. So sad the food used to be SOO good. \n\nThink I will give 6 months before I go back.

I ordered the pasta fagioli soup with fresh shaved parmesan and it was delicious. Even better, it was served absolutely piping hot - an all too infrequent treat when ordering soup in restaurant these days. My entree was a fresh homemade linguine with sausage and tomatoes, and it was excellent - the best pasta dish I've had in a long time. And again, served steaming hot fresh from the kitchen. Just excellent service.\n\nI found the ambience of the room warm and cozy, suitably dim lighting and just the right amount of buzz in a busy room.

Solid, tasty Italian fare. A diverse, but manageable menu. Decent pricing. Fantastic seasonal specials. I was not \"wowed\", but I did enjoy my meal.\n*The service was great. Everyone was friendly, attentive, helpful, and polite.\n*The food came out quickly. We had our salad on the table within 5 minutes of being seated.\n\nNow for the bad..\n*The decor was awful. I felt like I was in a cheap sushi restaurant that was converted into an italian restaurant. There was a bar with big pop-up plastic food holders (like in a sushi restaurant), the floor was unattractive and out of place, the bar chairs were filthy from mid-leg down to the floor, there were holes in the bar (where people probably kicked it while sitting at the bar), there were tons of wine boxes piled up above the bar, and I had a direct line of sight into the kitchen, which is NOT one of these modern kitchens that were meant to be watched.. it was not pleasant to see. There was absolutely no charm in here. It could have been an old diner with white table linens thrown onto the tables.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-22", "description": "Jackson Fillmore is a pretty good restaurant.  I haven't visited for several years until tonight, and was reminded of how tasty this place is.  There are so many good restaurants in this area, and in a radius of about 1 mile, that sometimes I forget places that are of 3-4+ star caliber for no real reason...except for being distracted by other options!\n\nOverall, our meal was fine but not extraordinary. To start, the warm bruschetta (complimentary) is a great touch- and delicious.  The highlight of the meal for me was the arugula salad with slivers of salami- it was excellent.  The fried mozzarella appetizer was a large chunk of cheese overloaded with marinara sauce- and while it tasted OK, I probably will not order it again.  My wife ordered a gnocchi dish with smoked chicken in a cream sauce- she was not too excited about it, however I enjoyed it and will probably eat her leftovers for breakfast in about 10 minutes.  My dish was the Snapper 'a la diavolo'- which translates to snapper in a spicy as all hell tomato sauce. I recalled this dish from my previous visit several years ago and it's memory actually re-inspired our recent visit.  Strangely, I think I enjoyed it more the first time around- although it was Ok this time as well.  The snapper is completely coated with an extremely spicy marinara sauce, and actually looked on the surface like a larger version of the fried mozzarella dish!  The staff left a plastic pitcher of water on each table, which I thought seemed a bit cheesy at first, but I drank basically the whole thing to dilute the spice of the snapper.  Regardless, I enjoy this type of spicy punishment from time to time and I will order & enjoy this dish again on a future visit.\n\nFrom my analysis of the menu- there seem to be many dishes served on the spicy side (Calabrese sauces, spicy sausage, etc), so if you enjoy spicy Italian food (and I do), this may be an excellent choice for you.  Spicy Italian food may have one dish or so on a typical menu, however there seemed to be many here.  This is not a place for a quiet, romantic date- the place is very small and compact, and the tables are very close together.  The restaurant was very busy around 7pm on a Thursday (good for them!) and the mix was mostly a crowd of 30 somethings and up.  Don't come here if you are looking for ornate 'picture perfect' plates- each portion was on the heavier side and seemed rather 'sloppy' in appearance but generous in quantity- essentially what I have come to expect from a 'home-style' Italian meal.\n\nIn summary, our meal for two appetizers, two entrees, and two glasses of wine was $95 (tip included).  The meal was quite tasty, and I will be back, but at this price point there is a lot of competition out there, and I think I would prefer to spend a comparable amount at A-16, Flour+Water, Ristorante Milano, Capannina, or Via Veneto.  However, when 'spicy' cravings come around again- Jackson Fillmore will come to mind.  I'll be back, but not too soon.", "author": "Andy S."}

It was a beautiful afternoon which gave way to fog and a sweeping chill - classic San Francisco summer, right?\n\nIt's one of those unassuming places you walk past because the signage is discreet and the restaurant front is narrow.  The wind blew me into the narrow but long restaurant and I was instantly enveloped by warmth.  I was immediately greeted by the host who assured my date and I we'd be seated shortly.  Led to our table by our friendly waiter, it wasn't long before we decided what we wanted for dinner.  Thankfully the menu isn't ridiculously long, which helped us narrow down our choices in short order.  We both opted for the zuppetta di pesce and the waiter recommended wines for our entrees - a nice sparkling white for him, a nice barbera from piedmont for me.\n\nAfter taking our menus away, complimentary bruschetta was placed on the table for us to nibble before our food came.  It was a nice slice of toasted bread, liberally doused with olive oil, with chunks of tomato, crushed garlic and basil.  A great way to start the meal!  I liked the barbera our waiter recommended as well.  Medium bodied, fruit forward and grapey.  It wasn't complex, but didn't need to be for the zupetta.\n\nWe both enjoyed the zupetta!  It was a generous amount of food, with plenty of shrimp, mussels, and a firm white fish.  There were a few mussels that didn't taste quite fresh, but overall the dish was tasty with the chunks of herb stewed tomato chunks.  It was simple food done well.\n\nWhat was more impressive than the food was the service.  Great service ALWAYS elevates a dining experience, and our server, who mentioned we were his last customers before leaving to pursue a music career in LA, was excellent!  He came by often enough to ensure we were enjoying our meal, but not so often it felt like we were being constantly interrupted.

The three of us each ordered a pasta dish and shared two appetizers (fried goat cheese and filet mignon special). Each appetizer was probably two bites. The wine list was short but had some good choices, Montapulciano, Chianti, and Cabernet to name 3 of the half dozen reds available. \n\nIf you are lazy and don't feel like cooking Sunday night this is the perfect place to go if you live in the neighborhood. Really, small, casual and cozy place with lots of options. Sit at the counter order a nice glass of wine and try one of the specials (the mushroom and white corn risotto special sounded quite appetizing but salmon won in the end). You really have to look for the place since the outside looks ghetto. I probably passed the restaurant a million times while walking up and down fillmore. I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you are very hungry and want to gorge down a big serving a pasta.

My wife and I used to hang out there A LOT a few years back but things changed and we moved closer to Polk Street yadda yadda...\n\nAnyway, I was on the #23 approaching Jack's at about 8p last Saturday -- there were perhaps 10 or 12 really stylish folks waiting to get in -- a very good sign.  Getting off the bus I bumped into my bud and we threaded our way in the front door.\n\nJack was helping out table #1 -- the big one in the window .  Now everyone knows that Jack is EXPERT on Italian and Spanish wines -- I heard him doing his thing while we hung out.\n\nA few minutes later he \"created\" a two-top and we sat down.  The place was buzzing with conversations, food, wine, and just a very nice atmosphere.  We could see the wait staff \"sailing\" around the room with steaming plates.\n\nI ordered a Prosecco (naturally) and didn't even look at the menu.

The tomato/garlic melange is just perfect here -- another good sign.\n\n knew I wanted Jack's famous Julienne  squash w/ almonds and peccorino -- you know the dish from Jack's youtube video.

No, no, my paisano...it's a hefty piece of grilled sourdough toast piled high with a marinated chopped tomato mixture. It was such a treat to get right off the bat with no questions asked.

They ended up all trying mine and saying it was the absolute best, but I'm sure no matter what dish you order, you will be pleased!\n\nThe only complaint I have about this place was that they screwed up our total and charged us for an extra glass of wine that we didn't order. We didn't realize this until walking out of the restaurant, and after paying, so we weren't about to go back inside and complain. I ended up spending about $36 for my dinner + wine which seemed a little bit pricey considering my meal itself was only ~$16. And I KNOW I didn't drink that much wine. Oh well, I'll just have to pay more attention next time around. That little mess up isn't going to keep me from coming back to this place.", "author": "Ashley D."}

Another couple came in and were seated before we were.  Without reservations.\n\nHello?\n\nI realize we weren't \"regulars\" there and therefore don't deserve special treatment.

That ended up making it a lot of fun, since everyone could be in on the conversation. It was the ultimate Italian comfort food: gnocchi covered in cream and cheese, mushroom ravioli in mushroom broth, fish in rich tomato sauce. We all started with bruschetta dripping in olive oil and covered with ripe tomatoes. The wine (Spanish, in honor of the recent World Cup champions) was fantastic. Our server was a total character and managed our rowdy group expertly. You can tell he's the kind of guy who's made a career out of it.\n\nI am a hero in the family now for taking us all there.  Even though the place isn't exactly a secret, it's not much to look at from the outside (ok, or even the inside) but it exudes warmth and comfort and fun.

This isn't an edgy, new-wave fusion Italian place: it delivers on the classics with only the hint of a twist, but everything is downright delicious.\n\nAs to the food, others have noted how outstanding the warm bruschetta is that arrives, unbidden, to your table when you first arrive. I wanted to order an entire plate as my main, but worried that my friends might be a bit judge-y and so regretfully refrained. The zucchini dish, as our waiter told us, has been on the menu for 20 years and is a delicious classic (and I usually hate zucchini!). I got a special, with a roasted quail served on top of some amazing risotto, and it was transcendent. The tartufo dessert was everything you want in an ice-cream, served with a delicious little side of whipped cream.\n\nAll in all, solid Italian that won't fail to please.

I called for a last minute reservation, since my friends decided to make the switch from dinner at the early bird special time to normal people time.  The host was very accommodating in getting us in for dinner.  The decor is simple, but I'm someone who cares more about the food than a trendy atmosphere.  And the atmosphere was perfect for a cozy neighborhood restaurant.\n\nOK, onto the food.  My glass of Verdicchio hit the spot.  The complimentary bruschetta is a nice touch.  Their special appetizer of burrata with heirloom tomatoes was heavenly, but then again, you really can't go wrong with those 2 ingredients.  The fried mozzarella was tasty as well, but again, can you really go wrong with anything that involves frying and cheese?  Along the lines of cheese, I pretty much devoured the gnocchi.  My friend got the tortellini, which was pretty darn good also.  I didn't try my other friend's dish, the fra diavolo, since that's not my favorite dish.

I recently went there for dinner with two friends. The restaurant's decor is very simple in keeping with the family/neighborhood motif. We were immediately greeted at the door and sat on time for our reservation. A ton of reviews on Yelp complain about the size of the restaurant and the wait for a table. To those people who don't appreciate the cozy friendly neighborhood vibe of this place, you should hit the local Olive Garden. When a restaurant claims they are \"cozy\", it means they are small, so plan accordingly. \n\nI ordered the Linguini Fra Diavolo which claims to be \"a total Jackson Fillmore classic\", but sadly I wasn't very impressed. The sauce was nice, but lacked the spice that I usually find in a Fra Diavolo sauce. I was expecting my mouth to be on fire with the devil, but sadly it wasn't. My friends ordered the Zuppetta Di Pesce and the Polla Alla Noci. The Zuppetta Di Pesce was a hit and my friend was very happy with her cioppino-like dish. The Pollo Alla Noci literally disappeared into my friends stomach in 2 minutes. (I think he liked it.) The dish was a boneless chicken breast covered with mushrooms, walnuts, pine nuts, sherry wine and a touch of cream. It looked delicious. If I wan't allergic to nuts, I would have asked for a taste. The waiter was super friendly in that he noticed my friend inhailed his dish and we were still eating, so he offered to bring him some bread to slop up the sauce. \n\nI liked Jackson Fillmore Trattoria; however, I don't know if it tops my list of neighborhood pasta joints. The service is friendly and the price is right. My favorite part of the meal was the complimentary bruschetta for the table. I wasn't as impressed with my meal as my friends were with theirs. \n\nA final positive for the restaurant was that I made a reservation by leaving a message on their voicemail as their OpenTable.com service wasn't working properly. I quickly received a call back which was a nice personal touch by the staff. Too often restaurants don't call you back and assume you will call them again, which is just plain rude.", "author": "Alice S."}

The meal started out great with a very tasty complimentary bruschetta.  We started with the antipasti which was very good. Although I question the wisdom of storing a tuna salad in a broken sushi fridge. I'd feel far more comfortable if it was a working sushi fridge. ( As we sat in front of it for nearly three hours and it was never rotated, I'm sure the health inspector would not be pleased. ) Regardless, the tuna salad AND the rest of the antipasti was pleasing. Then we had the insalata primavera. It was Arugula, fresh shelled peas and fava beans, blanched asparagus bits, pecorino etc., but only a cheap olive oil as a dressing. Even using a good quality olive oil would require sone sort of acidity to balance the salad and make a dressing. No salt was added. We had to ask for balsamic and s&p it ourselves.  Then was the catastrophic burata funghi. Bland as could be despite the porcini mushrooms that leached so much water (this happens with frozen porcinis) that the toast beneath is was mushroom water soggy. No salt. Very little flavor. We could not salvage this dish, but the burata itself was delicious. Then we had the spaghetti carbonara, which was good, not great. We had to add s&p, parm and lemon juice to liven it up. Over all, we were far from impressed. \n\nThe service was polite and well intentioned but very slow. It took 30 min. to get our first (wine) order. Our Server was constantly in the weeds, plating cold stuff while customers wait. They'd be better off spending the $100. on labor and turning more tables. We were there nearly two hours longer than intended.", "author": "Fareed R."}

Yet, here it was, a new guy, a second date, a native from San Francisco, saying this place is a San Francisco \"classic,\" and I had never heard of it!  The location is nice, and parking on a Tuesday night was relatively easy.  It is very modest (read, simple, no frills atmosphere) and the service is actually charming, but very direct and to the point.\n\nI had the salmon and potato ravioli in a tomato broth (which was not overly rich, and you could distinctly taste the freshness of the salmon) and he had,  well I don't know...possibly paying too much attention to him.  We did share the artichoke appetizer, which is an entire, h-u-g-e Artichoke and you get to tease each other by ripping the pulp off the skin.  \n\nThey honestly have amazing  bruschetta (it is complimentary and has twice the amount of toppings then the bread it was on...\"perfect!\")  We sat at the bar...next to each other and that was the best.  It feels more personal...he did finish my food without hesitation, but he's like 6'5, 220, so the serving sizes might be a tad small for that kind of appetite.\n\nWhen asked for desert, of course as this was only the 2nd date, I modestly said, \"no I am ok\"   and he was like hell no, you have to try this.... \"this\" was the cold zabaglione.  It is bright yellow and thick, but not overly sweet and the crunch crumbles of cookies mixed in makes it wonderful (as well as the strawberry's that they are very generous with).\n\nOne last note, they do not take reservations (well according to other reviews unless you have more than2 people) but you can hold hands and walk in the park across the street while you wait or grab the side-by side seats at the bar.  Yes, it is very \"classic.\"", "author": "Mai G."}

I'm a gnocchi addict.  At times, I've had leaden, gluey blobs drowned in a viscous sauce that tried and failed to cover up the crime on my plate.

Jackson Fillmore, however, serves gnocchi that are light little pillows of starchy goodness gently caressed by a flavorful sauce with a sprinkling of fresh basil.  Gnocchi Heaven!\n\nFull disclosure: they let us order a bottle of wine while we waited for our table, so I'd been drinking for a bit prior to receiving my meal.

Not good. Pesto was really watery, and the potato's undercooked.

Mine was the one with mixed vegetables. Too much garlic dressing, still liked the garlic. Really large portion for $9. We could have shared.

Ollie will always give us the update on the Giants if we do have to wait.  Then he throws a little something extra about the Dodgers, since I'm a fan.\nThey know what bottle of wine we like to drink and that starts a perfect evening out.\nWe usually order a pasta and chicken dish, so we can have a little bit of both. Every time, the pasta is cooked perfectly (I think they may have the best baked pasta).  The chicken g.o.v. is awesome and full of flavor.  This is one place that we totally miss since we have moved to the mission.  But every time we go back for dinner, it just makes it that much better.", "author": "Valarie A."}

And the kicker was when we finally sat us away from the door, he said, under his breath, but loud enough for us to hear, \"it's not boston or new york.\"  as if that's supposed to make us feel bad about asking for a seat away from the freaking door??  truly, how hard is it to walk the extra 5 steps?  truly!\n\nBut now on to the food.  My friend and I shared the stuffed artichoke and it was wonderful.  A touch hard to eat because it was freaking hot, but the flavors were all there.  Then I had the pasta with veal sausage and it was wonderful as well.  Their house chianti was a nice pairing with the veal.  \n\nThe weird part was at the end when the table next to us was getting ready to leave and the mom felt compelled to tell my friend and I that we were small eaters.

We were smart enough to call a couple hours ahead to make an 8pm reservation on a Sat evening. Always a smart move, folks! \n\nIt's right in the Fillmore/Jackson area as its namesake explains and a place like this make me very jealous that I don't live in a such a great areas as Pac Heights/Fillmore. Back in my hometown, you wouldn't find authentic comfort food around the corner like this, you'll find instead - families hangin' outside of the Olive Garden by Southland Mall in Hayward dying to get the all you can eat Soup'n'Salad or the Tour of Italy a la fettuccine alfredo, chicken parm and lasagna. \n\nLucky for me, my friend's days are numbered in the city so we went to some of her fav hood joints - Fillmore Jackson being one of them. This place is cozy, you just might sit on your neighbors nap, but this place is bustling with locals, couples, families, post-sporting event fans, etc. \n\nCan't complain about the complimentary bruschetta, or the delish fig first course. Saffron risotto could've definitely used a bit more salt and my linguine di mare was alright too. The sausage and chicken dish though was definitely the best - definitely hearty portion for the boys. \n\nBest of all the dessert - get the zabaglione - uhhhh yum. I would've lucked the wine glass it was served in. It's the first time I've ever had it and I fell in love - chocolate cake was just as yum. \n\nWhat I like most about this place is you don't have to dress up and try desperately to keep your elbows off the table - this place let's you be you, and let's them serve up some comfort cooking that makes you take a short stroll home, change into your jammies and pass out with a smile on your face.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Great choice! The service was fast and attentive, the small but crowded interior created a warm neighborhood feel and the menu was full of inventive takes on southern Italian fare.\n\nWe started with the gratis bruscheta (I wish they would put this on the menu, I would have ordered more) and a couple glasses of barbera. Both were excellent.  Next was the prosciutto stuffed artichoke appetizer. Heaven!  I had the gnocchi and Jason had the mushroom ravioli and each dish was flavorful and satisfying. \n\nOnly one negative: Having to schlep through the kitchen to the small and grody bathroom.

The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. My friend had the gnocchi. The handmade dumpling reminded me of Italy and the sauce was fresh. The mushrooms in the sauce were a bit much.

It took a while for our party of five to get a table, and we literally had to wait out on the sidewalk because it was so cramped inside.\n\nWhen we finally got a table, it took forever for the servers to bring us our menus.

Initially, my way-too-Asian dining companion thought they were chopsticks, and kinda freaked out when I reached for one and put it in my mouth, LOL.\n\nAfter we ordered, we each got a HUGE bruschetta placed in front of us, on the house.

I hope Jackson Fillmore you will make every effort to seat ALL your guests and comp the next dessert and coffee for my friend and her grandmother. You ruined their day.

I could only lust after a plate of it meant for another customer, while it lingered at the pick-up counter, which Berna and I were seated next to, at the tail-end of the cramped bar. \nThe carbonara was pretty good (still not what Basta Pasta's used to be like *tear*), and I loved their complimentary bruschetta - thick sliced, and topped with wonderfully garlic-y tomatoes & herbs. \nWhy haven't I been back?  Cuz I have better things to do than be ignored by my server for most of my meal. \nI feel like this is one of those small businesses that gets so packed every night - they don't really care to please anymore.  Our meal took over 2hrs, and seated RIGHT next to the kitchen, we actually saw when our entree ticket was finally put in - long after our shared salad had been served and devoured.  \nIf someone else wants to take the extra effort to make ressies and \ngo here, I'll be willing to join up, but I've got other pork chops in this city to try.", "author": "CINDY K."}

We also got poor service. \n\nOur menus were dropped off and without even getting a chance to look them over, the waiter (I think he may have been an owner or manager, as he was the only one in plainclothes and seemed to be running the show)  asked us if we knew what we wanted.  Of course we didn't so we asked for a few more minutes to decide.  Approx 90 seconds had gone by before he came back and asked again.  Repeat two more times.  When asked if someone could make a simple switch from steak to chicken on their pasta, he was extremely adamant about NOT honoring the request.  I would have understood had there not been chicken on the menu, but quite a few dishes had chicken and it should have been a simple requst.  I ordered the Insalata Verdure and what it really was was a side-salad-sized bunch of chopped romaine and a few zucchini and cauliflower slices.  Not exactly $9 worth in my opinion.  It also came SLATHERED in a mayo based dressing, to the point where I thought I was actually just eating spoonfuls of mayo.  Bleck.  \n\nOnce the waiter had dropped off our food, he was nowhere to be found.  I had to wait for 5 minutes before I got a fork or before he even walked in our direction.  He seemed genuinely disinterested and possibly annoyed at our group.  We weren't even drinking (!!!).  I'd give the place one star but the free bruschetta barely brought it up to a two-star rating.\n\nAll in all, Jackson Fillmore Trattoria left a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively) and I don't anticipate returning when there are plenty of other Italian joints in the city.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

Go figure.\n\nSo I came last night before a fillmore show w/ Liz U. and I realized that there is a huge neon sign in the front window that reads \"Trattoria\".  Okay. Moving on.  We had a reservation so we didn't need to wait long, but there were two other parties of two so they divided a six top into three two tops.  It kinda felt like we were in a cafeteria since everyone was so close together and talking really loud, but the food - well, this was not cafeteria food.\n\nWe started out with a bottle of wine and were each brought a huge chunk of crispy bruschetta.  Yelpers don't lie... this is some good sh*%!!  They obviously either make their own or use a really high quality olive oil.  My dining companion even had the balls to ask for another slice and the bus boy gladly brought it over.  For our entrees, she got a chicken dish and I got the gnocchi with tomatoes and swiss chard.  Good god, it was delicious.  The gnocchi were melt-in-your-mouth divine droplets of heaven.  It is a pretty generous portion so I thought I wouldn't be able to move after eating the whole dish, but I surprisingly had room for dessert! :)  Liz got the chocolate torta and I got the infamous tiramisu.  The chocolate torta was so-so I thought, but OMG the tiramisu was seriously the best I've had since I was in Italy.  Liz even admitted that she liked it, and she usually doesn't eat the stuff!!

My girlfriend and I showed up for a 7:30 reservation fifteen minutes early and were greeted by one of the owners/managers, who offered us a glass of wine (which we paid for) while we waited.  We were seated on time at a small table that was packed between other patrons, but it was not too loud and the tight seating added to the ambiance. Very rare to feel this in a city restaurant.  We started with the Carpaccio di Zucchini which comes with toasted almonds and pecorino. One of the best appetizers I have had..the perfect amount of sauce and cheese, almonds were a nice touch as well. I had the Tortellini al Forno for my main meal. While a bit heavy on the cheese, the meat inside was very good as was the prosciutto and cream sauce. My GF had the Pollo alla Noci, and said it was a great piece of chicken, not too dry..she thought the sauce could have been a bit more creative.\n\nThe dessert menu is ok but we were too full from dinner so did not get anything.\n\nWhat makes this place stand out is the service and the feeling of the restaurant.  You can tell that the owner cares a lot, appreciates every party that comes in, and genuinely wants each customer to have a good experience.  Many of the customers when we were there greeted him by name and seemed to be regulars.  The staff feeds off him, and with it is a romantic/authentic dining experience.  \n\nLastly, try the specialty Italian sodas.

Well, he wasn't really listening either and once I asked if that was our table in the corner he rudely replied, \"Oh no, that's for a party of 10\" (which was ridiculous, they were cutting it close for 8 in this space), and then I had to ask, well did you get our reservation, I don't see another table for us...He arrogantly said, we can turn any table here into 8 and as I looked around, no one was even close to finishing.  This made me think that our party of 8 would be waiting for at least a half hour which is totally unacceptable given the confirmations that took place.

The place is usually very busy, so get a reservation and if you walk-in do NOT believe the owner when he tells you it will be 5-10 minutes.

Myself and two of my other 22 year old friends went in on a Saturday night without reservations, around 6:45.  The place was full, and there was a couple ahead of us waiting to be seated.  The man at the front assured us it wouldn't be too long, three seats at the bar should open up very quickly,  My fried ordered a glass of wine while we waited and myself and other friend opted not to (it had already been a long Friday of drinking for me).\n\nMaybe that was our mistake.  From that point forward, the couple ahead of us was seated, followed by another two people who waltzed in without reservations (\"They're regulars- the other people should be getting dessert and finishing it soon\"), followed by the two people behind us who became three last minute and were seated at a table recently vacated (they didn't seem to have any sort of reservations), followed by a party of four who I am positive did not have reservations.  They were graciously led to a table, while my friends and I were led to the bar seating (which also held four).  Everyone seated before us was in their 30s or older.  Got some more abrupt service from the waiter, nothing fantastic or friendly, just functional.  At one point he brought over a salad that we hadn't ordered, and I had half a mind to eat it since the billing system let me know that he hadn't written it down for us.  But somehow I figured it would come back at some sort of triple charge on our bill, so I gave it back to him.\n\nFood was fine- I had the spaghetti alla carbonara, and the free bruschetta was good.  They tried to charge my friend for the $12 glass of wine instead of the $9 one she ordered.

The mixed green salad was made with romaine, slathered in an extremely creamy dressing, and was scattered with carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, and cauliflower. The radicchio salad didn't have enough flavors to balance its bitterness. I think that I can overlook all of that though because the tiramisu was one of the best I've ever tasted.

Wish they had more wines by the glass selection. I'm not much of a drinker so I wouldn't buy a whole bottle. I've walked by this place for years and it has always been busy. Now I know why. I can't wait to go again.", "author": "Lisa J."}

People consistently remarked on the charm of the ambience, but also warned against the hostile service; ironically I heard little about the food. When I arrived for my 7:30 reservation they indicated unapologetically that they would seat my group in 10-15 minutes. When we were seated, the servers made utterly clear their desire to turn our table. When we ordered a second bottle of wine I think the waiter actually sighed in annoyance. My Chicken Sicilian was served in a more family style manner then I anticipated, i.e., no sides or garnishes. The flavor was okay, a bit mild and nothing to write home about. Ultimately, while it is such a cute spot, and a true neighborhood find, I doubt I will rush back.", "author": "Erin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-01-19", "description": "Overall, I was impressed with great tasting food using simple recipes. A couple friends and I shared the risotto, seafood medley and half-chicken. My favorite was the chicken with semi-crisp pancetta in a lemon caper sauce. Great combination of savory with a hint of tanginess. The seafood medley (clams, mussels, shrimp and fish) in a tomato base was a little salty for my taste. I was disappointed when I ordered a cab/merlot blend and they poured it in a small burgundy glass...I'm no wine expert, but it probably would've breathed better in a proper red wine glass. We capped off the meal with a zabaliogne freddo - a great treat since not many places serve this traditional Italian dessert. On the negative side, service was too relaxed and inattentive, and there were a few gnats cruising around our table.", "author": "James Y."}

I honestly believe Jackson Fillmore is too hyped up.  I tried this place 2x and got sick both times.  Tip:  stick to the basic pasta dishes (which aren't really that great) and don't order seafood or meat...you'll get sick.  Cute location, cute setting, conveniently located by my place...but there are too many other great places in the neighborhood that have more to offer.  Don't waste your time!", "author": "Maria S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-03-30", "description": "Food is okay but the service was awful!  When we asked politely to switch tables (we were seated next to the front door and  one of our chairs was uncomfortably close to the constant opening of it), the waiter rolled his eyes, looked over to the host and said, \"These people don't like where they're seated.\".   Incredibly rude!  After we moved tables, the service went downhill.  The waiter appeared completely put out, he never smiled, and he was comically abrupt.  There's nothing I hate more than bad customer service.  \nWhat can I say about the food?  I had the risotto and it was nice--good flavors.  My husband had the chicken which was tender and tasty.  The spaghetti was just okay. Unfortunately, I am one of those people who won't go back to a restaurant if I experienced distasteful service (and believe me, I'm not picky about where or what I eat, but a simple smile goes a long way in the ambiance department).  If you're just into the food, it's worth a try.  But if you want to enjoy the night without some rude waiter around, then definitely do not go the the Jackson Fillmore.  BAD, BAD, BAD SERVICE!!!!!", "author": "Luana L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-08-29", "description": "have been coming here with my family since i was nine. i love it just as much now as i did when i was younger. the bruscetta is the most perfect mixture of olive oil, fresh basil, tomatos, salt, and garlic. they bring it out right away. it is small, loud, and bustling, and blaring loud rock music, in the tradition of italian trattorias. the menu is simple, northern and southern italian highlights. go for the handwritten specials though, they shine and shine. the desserts are all wonderful, but the best is the zabaglione freddo, a frothy custard of eggs, marsala wine, cream and sugar. added are amaretto cookies on the bottom. it is out of this world, my sister-in-law swears by it and couldn't find its match, even in italy!!!", "author": "Lesley S."}
