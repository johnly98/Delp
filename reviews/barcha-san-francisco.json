The place is wonderfully decorated with the Mediterranean style lighting and colors.\n\nThe food was delicious. My group split the hummus, lamb meatballs, and the Turkish manti (dumplings). Group consensus was the dumplings were amazing, though my personal favorite was the meatballs. We then had a salad, with two entrees of the half chicken and the braised duck kabsa. All of it was quickly devoured.\n\nBetween the 5 of us we spent about $50 (we had cocktails too) but if we were more on a budget we definitely could have cut out a small plate and/or the salad (but definitely not the cocktails.)", "author": "Stephen P."}

The servers were extremely friendly, and our server, Noah, was awesome.\n\nThere are tons of vegetarian options in the appetizer and sides sections, but unfortunately, none in the entree section, which was a disappointment. I do hope that they add at least one vegetarian entree on their menu, so vegetarians like me don't have to fill up on appetizers and sides.\n\n- Bazlama: This is their Turkish flatbread, that you can eat with hummus and other dips. This was decent, but wish it was warm.\n- Hummus: The hummus was decent, but not delicious. \n- Muhammara: I ordered this without the poached egg. I definitely liked the flavor of this spread. It would have tasted much better if the bread was warmer.\n- Winter Ratatouille: This was delicious....I ate this with the Turkish flatbread and filled myself with it.\n- Blistered 'Shishito' Peppers: This was really good and not spicy at all. I was scared to try it first as I cannot handle spice. But it was surprisingly good.\n- Crispy New Potatoes: Delicious!!! Perfectly seasoned and cooked.\n\nWe did order Baklava, but the nuts inside tasted stale, so we had to send it back.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is really cool, and we all had a great time.

The waiters were friendly and the space reminded me of what Morocco and Tunisia may look like. The decor from the pendant lamps and the photos of tubs of spices felt very transformative. The noise level was far too loud for my taste and the music seemed off.\n\nThis place isn't keen on order changes as a lot of things are pre-made. A colleague tried to change something in the salad (not able to) and I asked if something could be removed from the soup (not able to). However, I ended up settling on the olive oil poached tuna and a saffron basmati rice side. The two together are so filling and probably could be split in half for two solid meals. The tuna was poached too long for me and ended up being more tough and dry than I had envisioned it to be, but the dressing and flavors were amazingly delectable. The rice was so colorful and flavorful that I practically inhaled all of it.\n\nMy favorite part was probably ogling at the beautiful plates.\n\nVerdict: I would be interested in going back to try out other unique food pieces that I seldom see elsewhere", "author": "Catherine W."}

The bread was soft and very similar to indian flat bread. We all really liked it.

We also ordered the Shishito Peppers and they were also good in combination with the hummus but were a little less flavorful than what I had hoped for. \n\nMain course: It turned out to be a Lamb centric night for us. As a group we ordered the Shakshuka with Lamb Merguez and the Rack of Lamb. Both were amazing and tasted nice and different. If you want something with tomato gravy the Shakshuka is a very good choice and the potatoes and cheese is very good. The potatoes were surprisingly flavorful. We ordered with a side of Persian rice. This was a very nice side order and it tasted like Berry Pulao that we have back home in India, coming from the Persian community there. \n\nSweets: we tried the Baklava and Basque Cake. One of the best Baklava's I have had in SF and the apricot went very well with it.

Even though the areas were well lit, there were no heating lamps so we went to go sit inside. \n\nThe next thing I noticed were the huge, beautiful chandeliers that were all different shapes. The light shining through the chandeliers added some texture to the walls - almost looked like wallpaper. There was also a cute booth on the side that kind of looked like a VIP table. \n\nOur drink orders were taken not too long after we were seated. The food came out pretty quickly, as well. My hubby and I always order way too much food. To start, we had the grilled spanish octopus, croquettas, tuna crudo, and lamb meatballs. The octopus was really tender. The croquettas were creamy on the inside and had a touch of sweetness from the truffle honey. The crudo was my least favorite. It looked like poke so I was expecting/missing avocado, and it needed more acidity. My favorite, though, were the lamb meatballs. They were so flavorful and moist. Something about lamb and feta together...yum!\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the rotisserie chicken and beef kebab with a side of basmati rice. I was already getting kinda full from all the appetizers so I didn't really need the rice, but it was still good. The chicken portion was huge! It was moist and had good flavor. I liked the way the kebab was presented - our server slid the meet off the skewer for me. The kebab was cooked to a perfect medium rare, it was so tender and juicy. I don't know what they did to that kale but it was addicting! I wanted to save room for dessert so I only took a few bites of the kebab and saved the rest for lunch the next day. \n\nThe pecan baklava was quite delicious. It's pretty filling so I took a few bites and packed that up, as well. My hubby had the g\u00e2teau basque which was a cake with pears. That was pretty yummy, too. \n\nI loved that they played hip hop and r&b.  Service was great - our server made some great recommendations and checked on us pretty frequently.

Having come here last night for a friend's birthday dinner, I've now finally tried both their lunch AND dinner menus. \n\nFirst off, you can't really go wrong with anything you order here, as pretty much everything I've tried here so far has ranged from decently good to outright delicious! Some of my favorites however is the sandwiches with a side of their crispy potatoes and mixed greens. I kid you not, these potatoes are literally the best crispy potatoes I've ever had in my life! I don't know what fairy dust they use to season them with, but the taste, aroma, and perfect texture of the skin makes it quite a treat on the tastebuds! And while the greens typically get relegated to being pushed on the side (sorry mom!) at most joints, the mixed greens here have been marinated in a delicious red wine vinaigrette and taste perfectly delectable! \n\nAs for the sandwiches, I've tried several of the shawarmas and skewers and have enjoyed them all. Keep in mind that the skewers are not the typical meat skewers that you might imagine. Instead, they are your choice of proteins and other deliciousness wrapped in a pita bread, cut into sections, and \"skewered\" with toothpicks. \n\nAnd while the dinner menu certainly was good, it just didn't quite carry the same level of appeal that the lunch menu did. \n\nSeating is available both indoors and out, and the ambience is definitely on the more upscale level. Service is very friendly and attentive, with very consistent refills of water and meal check-ins.", "author": "Alex C."}

We came at 4:45 on a Wednesday and although there was lots of space then, the host did say they were fully booked, so that we would have to leave by 6 - which was our intention anyways. We sat inside because it was a little chilly, but they did have a good amount of outdoor seating - although it would be loud out there (it wasn't particularly quiet inside either).\n\nThe Hummus was solid - definitely homemade. The flatbread was standard.\n\nGrilled Duck Meatballs were most disappointing. They just didn't have that much flavor. I did think that the fig paired nicely with it though.\n\nPotato and Feta Croquettes were quite nice. a little less feta-y than I had hoped (I do LOVE cheese), but they were very well friend - nice a crunchy, but not over done, with a good consistency inside.  \n\nTurkish Manti - these were SO good! Could have eaten many more! The spiced beef inside was very good, but what really stole the show was the garlic yogurt and brown butter tomato sauce and how they paired. Wouldn't necessarily think that the combo would be that stunning - but it was really just perfect and such an amazing balance of complex flavors.\n\nThey do have happy drinks - so look for that. \n\nIt costs what you would expect \"tapas\" to cost in the FiDi.

Yes. \n\nHubs and I were celebrating so we wanted to try something fancy. He had seen Barcha on a number of occasions so we decided to stop in. On a Friday around 5:30PM they were able to seat the two of us right away without reservations.\n\nOn this visit we started with the Chicken and Manchego Croquettes and Turkish Manti. The croquettes had a perfect crunch and were packed with lots of meat. These were absolutely filling and rich, and were topped with a honey truffle topping. The Turkish manti were my favorite of the two and a little more on the lighter side. Think dumplings filled with spicy beef. Might I add the manti were beautifully plated with a drizzle of garlic yogurt and chili oil, and a sprinkling of fresh herbs and spices. I could eat a whole plate (or two) of these. \n\nWe also had the Kale Caesar which is served with roasted beets and crumbled hard boiled eggs. It was dressed in the heavier side and I'm ok with that. Though I'm not particularly fond of having egg on my Caesar salads, it was rather satisfying. \n\nThe show stopper though was the Grilled Angus Beef Kebab; not so much because of the flavors, but because the beef was brought to our table on a food sword and placed on our plate. The beef is served medium rare with cioppolini onions, baby yams, grilled lollipop kale, chermoula (think chimichurri but Turkish).\n\nI'm a sucker for bourbon drinks; the Sousse was a lovely combination of Old Grand-dad bourbon, blackberries, elderflower, lemon juice, and creme de violette. It was a beautiful purple hue and very fun to drink.\n\nBarcha has a fairly large space which is great for groups. It does get rather loud so by midway through our meal we were definitely using our clubbing voices.

While delicious, the salad was also a bit on the salty side, due to all the briny ingredients. I also got to try a bite of the skewered lamb leg, which was amazing--the lamb was so tender and juicy and added a perfect warmth to the crunchy salad!

Made a reservation via open table for 7pm and when we arrived (Thurs night) it wasn't too crowded. Love the decor and warm service. Everything we ate was delicious and the ambiance and down-to-earth service made our entire meal experience great from start to finish.\n\nWe shared three apps, a salad and an entree and were satisfied but not stuffed. Started with hummus, prawns and meatballs. Hummus was amazing and smooth and the flatbread it came with was perfect. We had the kale Caesar and the kebab which is presented beautifully right off the skewer. Everything was cooked perfectly and flavors were complex but not inaccessible. \n\nThey have lovely outdoor seating but it was a bit too cold last night for that. Not sure if they have heat lamps but would love to come back and sit outside and people watch. Great location off market street. Prices were a tad high for the entrees but the mezze were priced well (we did wish for slightly larger portions). \n\nOverall, a great option in this part of town and I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Semuteh F."}

I never knew tomato sauce, yogurt sauce, and spices could come together to create so many different flavors. Add that on top of the beef dumplings and they're a glorious combination. It was so good that I was scraping the sauce off my plate and eating it by itself. \n\nNext we ordered the beef (med rare) skewer which was very juicy and had a nice bounce to it. We noticed that they didn't even offer salt on the table, because this was spiced to perfection. Nothing necessary to add. It was slightly crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.\n\nLastly, we ordered the egg, tomato, labneh dish with lamb (I forgot the name of the dish). The tomato was nicely sweet, but was a bit too much tomato and not enough other things Imo. The lamb sausage bits throughout the dish were my favorite parts. The egg tasted a bit plasticy too me but it might be because we left it to cook in the heat a little too long. The labneh went very well with the tomato.\n\nOverall, very much enjoyed the dinner, but it was a bit too pricy Imo than it was worth. However, it was still a good place to try out and maybe come back to on special occasions.", "author": "Edmund L."}

We walked in on a Saturday night, the restaurant was about one-quarter full, which should have set off warning signs, maybe? Also, definitely a $$$ spot.\n\nService was fine-- the waiter made small talk and was happy to step in and out as we needed him. The mezze (shared small plates) we got were so-so, but nothing remarkable-- the duck kefta (meatballs) did not really taste like duck and chickpea falafel with labneh was okay, quite lemony. Each ran about $8-$12, but within an okay range for pricey restaurants.\n\nThe one star is for the braised lamb shoulder. When we ordered the dish, the waiter suggested we get some sides with it. We declined, thinking that a $35+ dish should have some heft to it. The dish was brought to the table in a tall, La Creuset-style Dutch oven with a place for steam in the cone-shaped lid. I wish I was kidding, but when the server lifted the lid, we had to peer over the side of the pot to see the thin layer of lamb, egg, and sauce that BARELY covered the bottom of the pot. Mind you, this was described as something that could be served family style. The taste was fine, but the portion size was a joke.", "author": "Nicole H."}

Came here on a weekday for lunch around 1, and it was a full house. We were greeted and seated promptly to a well lit and spacious table. I have to give it up for their ambiance and decor - it's a step up from the other lunch spots in the area so if you have a date to impress, Barcha wouldn't be a bad choice. Their interior goes well with the Mediterranean theme, but in a more contemporary and upscale kindov way. I like.\n\nI ordered the hummus with flatbread as an appetizer and the chopped salad as my lunch. Overall, pretty tasty! I was definitely a fan of the flatbread. It was a little oiler than I would've liked, but the sprinkle herbs and garlic made up for it. My chopped salad was also pretty good - vegetarian friendly and an added plus that it already comes with avocado. \n\nI was pretty satisfied with my lunch, but overall, nothing was really mind blowing about my meal. A great, fancier option for a lunch date, but there's other tastier (and cheaper) spots around the area that would've be my first choice.

The duck meatballs were definitely the best thing we ordered, get this! The calamari and potato croquettes were adequate, but the scallops were not good. They were ocean- bland tasting, with a very odd citrus flavor that did not mix well. We could not finish this dish.\n\nBarcha vindicated itself in the desserts which were excellent.

I found it through Yelp/OpenTable trying to find a fun tapas place. I also specifically chose this place because it is next to my friends' offices but none of them ended up coming straight from the office. D'oh! My friend actually went back home and grabbed his car and was able to find street parking right outside on a Friday night so you could try your luck driving here if you want! \n\nOur waiter Jordan was amazing! Definitely made our dinner ten times better. Hope the manager is reading this so they can give him the props he deserves! Space is pretty big and we sat all the way in the back. Great for groups or dates! Totally made up for the subpar birthday dinner I had at Hakkasan the night before. \n\nWe ordered a ton of tapas and everything was delicious. Standouts were definitely the shrimp, crushed avo, and arugula salad. Some of their dishes look very different than your typical ones you're used to like the tabbouleh and their patatas bravas. \n\nMy friend ordered cognac and there was some confusion and she got some pisco instead and they happily took it back after she tasted it and didn't like it. I also got a cute dessert with a candle and everything that ended up actually being the only candle I got! Thank god for Barcha! \n\nI don't know why there are complaints for the high prices because it was VERY reasonable with all the food AND our 6 drinks and was the same price as dinner for four as it was for two at Hakkasan and 10x better.

The food is mostly delicious, with all my favorite Mediterranean flavors. Plus, the service is quite attentive and polished, so you feel well taken care of. Bonus: they offer both 3 oz and 6 oz glasses of wine, handy for lunchtime sipping. \n\nThe not so good: portions are tiny and prices are not. This is more of a spendy spot, especially if you end up ordering lots of small mezze plates to share (at $8-10, these small bites add up).

The calamari was a good texture, not too chewy, and had a slight smokiness. Loved the romesco/red pepper sauce! Lots of flavors in this dish that went well together. \n\n-WARM RATATOUILLE ($7) - 4/5\nServed with 2 pieces of Turkish flatbread, which were soft and fluffy, kind of like naan. The ratatouille was pretty good but not that spectacular.\n\n-CRUSHED CALIFORNIA AVOCADO ($10) - 3.5/5\n[poached egg, salsa verde, crispy chicken skin, pimente d'espelette]\nNot bad, but this really just tasted like normal guac to me. We mixed in the egg (poached nicely with a runny yolk) but it didn't really make the guac any different. Came with 2 pieces of that amazing Turkish flatbread.\n\n-HONEY POACHED PEARS ($10) - 3/5\n[crottin cheese, ras el hanout, arugula, candied almonds]\nReally sweet for an appetizer..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-24", "description": "2.5 STARS\n\nI miss working in the FiDi. Lots of eye candy in suits. All they're missing is holding a pup a la Tom Hardy style. *swoons*\n\nSeriously, is there anything better than a handsome guy and an adorable pup? Ok, maybe delicious food and booze.  \n\nMy friend and I wanted to do a pupdate so I suggested that we check out the newly opened Barcha since they have outdoor seating. Having been to their sister restaurant Sens, I kept my expectations low; other than the amazing view, the food was underwhelming. I read that Barcha's concept is casual Mediterranean so I was looking forward to having, you know...Mediterranean food. Disappointingly, the dinner menu is more New American with a touch of Mediterranean influence. For all you alkies, sorry, there's no full bar. \n\nMaybe we went on an off night but everything we ordered sounded good on paper and beautifully presented, except it was less than mediocre (my friend who is not picky agreed). The Mediterranean spices were absent and some of the flavor profiles just didn't work for us. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Potato & Sheep Milk's Feta Croquettes w/ rouille ($8): http://bit.ly/1QQ0ow0\nCrunchy, fried, plain mash potatoes but where's the cheese? We didn't taste any.\n\n*Pastrami Smoked Salmon w/ fromage blanc, coriander honey, pickled onions ($14): http://bit.ly/1SIhs5E\nBasically lox and cream cheese but nicely plated. Hard to mess up.\n\n*Crushed California Avocado w/ poached egg, salsa verde, crispy chicken skin, piment d'espelette ($10): http://bit.ly/1I1z8TY\nSo enticing on paper and it looked fantastic but this was just a suped up guacamole. It was very bland, needed salt, spice, citrus, chilies, something. The yolk was decadently creamy but the whites of were still raw and jiggly. The best thing of the night was the accompanying Turkish flatbread. It was like a naan and flour tortilla hybrid--so good!\n\n*Oven Roasted Australian Sea Bass w/ braised leeks, preserved lemon, chanterelles ($28): http://bit.ly/1Lovi7C\nCrisp skin but dry and overcooked--ended up tasting like tilapia, not a rich, buttery cut of sea bass. Chanterelle sauce was more apt for a steak dish.\n\n*Grilled Angus Shoulder Fillet w/ parsnip pur\u00e9e, cranberry, grilled endive, balsamic ($28): http://bit.ly/1Hb5zog\nAnother beautifully presented dish but the steak wasn't rested enough before slicing. It was dried out and tepid. The parsnip pur\u00e9e was excessively sweet and with the tart cranberry sauce, it ended up being an unappetizing pairing with the steak. \n\n*Walnut Baklava w/ orange blossom chantilly, spiced poached quince ($7): http://bit.ly/1PCqZ0l\nAlthough there was a thick filling of walnuts, there were no flaky layers as the top phyllo layers were smooshed into one. Also, the walnuts were burnt.\n\n*Dark Chocolate Ganache Tart w/ orange caramel, whipped cream fraiche, pistachios ($7): http://bit.ly/1l7OaT4 \nIt was rock hard and dry, like it had been sitting in the fridge for days.\n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nI know they're new so I'm not docking them for service but adequate training is needed. I made online reservations at 5 pm. The restaurant called me the day before to confirm my reservations at 5 pm. I get there several minutes before 5 pm and was told, \"We don't open until 5:30 pm\". The hostess was very nice but there was no apologies for their mistake. She did agree to sit me early outside as I waited for my friend though.\n\nMy friend had a sip of her wine but didn't like it (I didn't like two of the wines I ordered but I was not about to let booze go to waste). When clearing empty plates, my friend kindly told our server she can take away her wine as well. Usually servers ask if there's anything wrong if you've barely touched your order but she didn't ask (and we didn't want to complain). We were charged for the $12 glass of wine. \n\nThen, came packing up our leftovers. The busboy asked what we wanted packed up and we told him the apps and the fish. He took the apps away and we never received the leftover apps. Our server then brings us a box for the fish entree. So do customers pack their own leftovers or does the restaurant?\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nOpen, bright, and airy with an open kitchen. We sat outside which had good lighting but no heat lamps. The music was loud and the selection was strange for a Mediterranean restaurant--drum & bass, techno, then salsa music? \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nEasy street parking on the weekends. This is not a destination restaurant but rather a restaurant for a company paid lunch for FIDi peeps. \n\nAfter spending nearly $100 pp, we left unsatisfied and disappointed. I highly recommend heading to Kokkari instead for legit Mediterranean food or spending a little more and having a Michelin experience at Mourad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-15", "description": "Imagine my embarrassment in getting lost trying to find this place, especially since I used to work at 425 Market for a number of years. By coincidence, I had scheduled lunch with a colleague who happens to come from the Middle East, Iran to be exact, and I thought why not try this place since Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines have a lot in common. Right? After discovering that this restaurant took over the space previously occupied by Tully's Coffee and a convenience store, I was surprised how well it was transformed into a more upscale, somewhat exotic dining destination by owner Kais Bouzidi.\n\nHe also runs Sens at 4 Embarcadero, a popular happy hour spot for FiDi working drones. Sens? I was never too impressed with that spot, so the credentials didn't impress me, yet the lunch menu here did a good job of wooing my palate with a mix of mezze, salads, sandwiches and rice plates (photo: http://bit.ly/1QpNtSd). We decided to share the $6 Hummus with Cumin and Olive Oil, which was creamy and tasty and nicely complemented by the grilled Turkish flatbread that came with it (photo: http://bit.ly/1WV68tm). We both went for the $22 Chef's Plate, which granted was much higher than I usually spend on lunch, but we felt this would give us a true sampling of what they served.\n\nMy colleague decided to mix the classic shawarma of slow-roasted, free-range veal and heritage turkey with a half-dozen Grilled Wild Gulf Shrimp nestled on a bed of spicy bulgur with mixed greens and pickled onions on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1Mhd2kD). I also went for the classic shawarma but with the Grilled Local Lamb Leg on a skewer (photo: http://bit.ly/1ONbsdL). Both the lamb and shrimp were delicious, but it was the shredded veal-turkey shawarma meat that was the standout. Both of us got even more of the grilled flatbread, still warm from the oven, with a trio of sauces - garlic yogurt, cilantro salsa verde, and harissa - on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1X1FN7N).\n\nSince we didn't have a reservation, we sat at the bar which gave us a bird's-eye view of the vertical rotisseries as well as the comings and goings from the kitchen. The bartender Mariah entertained us with her good cheer as she shared what the owner was envisioning for the space. I'd say Bouzidi has a hit on his hands considering how bustling business was after only three weeks in operation. I'm definitely coming back for dinner with Jamie W. even if it is a bit premium priced since they offer $6 Turkish pizza (Lahmacun) which was quite a roadside treat when I went to Turkey a few years back. Definitely a solid find.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the classic shawarma is the standout item not to be missed\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice Turkish touches in the decor, a marked improvement over what was there before\nSERVICE - 4 stars...Mariah was a peach\nTOTAL - 4 stars...impressive new Mediterranean spot may not be completely authentic but it doesn't lack for big flavors.", "author": "Ed U."}

The food came out quickly with the service being efficient throughout the entire meal with water refills coming quickly. The hummus came out first of course and it was the perfect texture and paired well with the flatbread. This had a solid flavor to it and I was a fan of it. The shawarma came out next. The meat was cooked really well and pretty flavorful which was nice. I didn't leave any of it left on the table as it was just plain delicious.

Since there wasn't a lot of people there, they accommodated us with a seat at the bar.\n\nLet's go with the good stuff first.\n\nThe atmosphere is every inviting for a date night.  I loved how cozy & warm it felt.  Knowing we wanted some wine, the manager gave us a taste of 2 very affordable nice wines (our bottle cost $50).  This was GREAT. Never had been somewhere & asked for a recommendation of wines & the host get exactly what we enjoy right off of the get-go.\n\nWe started with the AUGULA AND ENDIVE salad.

After we got the wine, the bartender immediately asked if we were ready to order (no we haven't received our wine yet) or needed a couple of minutes.  We have literally been here maybe a total of 5 minutes.  We get our bottle of wine opened, said our cheers & we were asked again if we were ready to order.  Feeling like we were being pushed, the bartender said the kitchen is closing at 9 tonight.  Our reservation was for 8:30pm & absolutely nothing was said until NOW, they were closing early.  So... for this reason, I gave them a low rating.  \n\nDon't make customers feel like they are not wanted.

My friend and I got the following items: \n\nPersian Rice: Definitely recommend getting this with the ratatouille. If you are familiar with indian food it tastes like Jeera rice but a little more flavorful. \n\nRatatouille: This is definitely a must get! So flavorful and tasty. It is a little sweet but a good amount of sweet to enjoy the taste. It is served with flatbread and I would highly recommend to get the Persian rice to eat along with it. Out of all the items this is definitely my favorite as a big entr\u00e9e dish. Good to share with one person. \n\nCous Cous: My least favorite item. My friend and I could barely finish it because it tasted so dry and there wasn't much flavor to it. It is different from the other cous cous I tasted which is more moist and has more spices. This one was very bland. \n\nPotato Feta Croquettes: MUST get. Great side and absolutely delicious!!! I lost my phone on this night so I can't post the picture but so yummy I would definitely recommend. \n\nMy friend and I also shared cabernet together - their wine collection is great. I tried the Greek and Turkish and I enjoyed it. Overall, great place to dine after work and good for small entrees/tapas.", "author": "Tulsi M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "description": "These are my favorite reviews to write. Why? Because I came here with zero knowledge about the place and no expectations, and I was totally blown away by my experience. Barcha is hands-down one of the better FiDi/SOMA lunch spots to emerge in the past year. \n\nThe restaurant is quite massive, and yet there's still a long line at the hostess desk to snag a table. That's how popular this place is! My advice would be to make a reservation in advance. Keep in mind, this isn't your usual fast-casual joint. You're not ordering food at a counter and waiting for your number to be called. This is a legit restaurant with servers and a first-class kitchen cranking out top-notch Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nAlthough my lunch companion and I hadn't reserved a table, they were kind enough to seat us at the bar near the kitchen. I was delighted to see that they had a full bar, so I ordered one of their specialty cocktails - the Istanbul (a plum-infused bourbon cocktail with orange bitters and served over a giant ice cube). It was a like a Mediterranean twist on an Old Fashioned. I loved it. Could've slurped down 2 more of these bad boys if I didn't have to go back to the office.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Shawarma made with slow roasted free-range veal and Heritage Turkey. The succulent meat is served in housemade turkish bread with lettuce, tomato, onions and your choice of green salad or rice (I went with the salad). If you order this dish and like a little extra heat/kick, then be sure to ask for the paprika a\u00efoli and cilantro salsa verde on the side. I've never had a Shawarma so delicious before. All the ingredients were fresh, and the dish was beautifully plated. Best of all, it only took 5 minutes for us to get our meal (and this was in the middle of their busy lunch hour!). Unbelievable!\n\nOk, I'll admit... the Shawarma wasn't exactly cheap. It was $18. But you could easily eat half of your meal and be full and then take home the rest of it for dinner later that night. So as far as I'm concerned, you're getting two delicious meals for $18, and that seems like a fair price to me!\n\nThis restaurant really has an undeniable lively vibe. The decor is sleek and sexy (sort of neo-Mediterranean), the service is friendly and attentive, and I just felt cool for hanging out here.\n\nIf you're looking to impress a client or just grab a biz-casual bite to eat with friends or co-workers, I would definitely put Barcha on your SOMA/FiDi lunchtime radar!", "author": "Kevin B."}

When we arrived, we only had to wait a few minutes before our table was ready. \n\nI had the LAMB SHAWARMA and it was delicious! The lamb was well marinated and very tender. I only wish they served the wrap in a paper or something else because it was messy to eat with hands. Although I wanted to be healthy and get the mixed greens as my complimentary side, I went with the ROASTED POTATOES and totally did not regret my choice! The potatoes were perfectly salted and seasoned with rosemary, with extra crispy edges and fluffy interior. My supervisor got the SAFFRON RICE as her side and it was also very flavorful. \n\nFor drinks, we had the MINT LEMONADE and MINT ICED TEA...both very refreshing. \n\nService was attentive and we got our food pretty quickly while in the middle of a busy lunch rush.\n\nI'd come here again for a nice lunch in the FiDi.", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

The place has a lot of tables outside and is nicely set up. \n\nWe started off with the chicken croquettes and they were pretty decent. The highlight of the menu though was the Chef's plate. My friend and I split it and we liked every item in it. The shawarma with the turkey and veal was SO delicious that I had to fight my friend for the last few pieces. The saffron rice was really flavorful and accompanied the shawarma well. Top it off with the garlic yogurt and the meal was on point. We also liked the crispy potatoes, the gulf shrimp, the Turkish flatbread and the hummus. \n\nThe customer service was great and everything came to the table within a few minutes of ordering. \n\nAmbience - 5 stars.

It looked so promising, plus it is only a few blocks from my bf's place so I was really hopeful to add a great restaurant to our list.  We had reservations Saturday night at 8:30pm, walked and the place was about half full.  \n\nWe sat down and was greeted by the waitress, she was nice.  We ordered a few appetizers, the shishito peppers, gulf shrimp, tuna and the olives.  Everything was a bit under seasoned, the tuna didn't seemed fresh. Nothing really stood out.  We waited a long time for the shrimp to come out, and by this time they had already cleared our small plates, so when the shrimp came out, I asked for some and she never brought them over.  Our waitress also never came back to take our entree order and I had to remind her.   Several times my bf's water glass was empty and had to wait a long time for them to refill them.  \n\nI honestly don't know if they were just having an off night or what, but I seriously don't understand why this place is so highly rated...the food was below average and service was terrible and prices were moderately high for the quality of food we got.

As for the food: we liked the dips and dumplings we had for starters, but our main of stuffed aubergine rolls was not worth the hefty price tag (close to 30 bucks for a smallish vegetarian dish). The aubergine was undercooked and chewy and the filling of grains and goat's cheese was mushy, bland baby food. Despite the place's lively vibe, I won't be going back.", "author": "Coline S."}

Two of us shared the falafel, hummus, peppers, chopped salad (vegetarian), and grilled corn, and I'd recommend every one of them. I've had a lot of falafel and this was arguably the best. Served in 4 discs, not balls, it was very moist without any hint of being oily. The presentation was more elevated than what you likely imagine for a falafel plate. The Turkish flatbread served with the hummus was fantastic. The dishes' spices such as dukka and marash pepper provided an interesting twist to what might otherwise be standard peppers and corn. 5 dishes for the two of us was a good amount; I probably could have comfortably fit in half a dessert if cajoled. Finally, the cocktails were very well made with interesting ingredients, although the portions quite small, especially considering standard fidi cocktail prices.\n\nThe interior was surprisingly casual, but still nice enough to take a date.

Also, I was told by our server after we finished our meal that the flatbread is make fresh in house.

And they were family-style which was nice even for our small party of 3.\n\nI loved my 1st visit so much I came the very next evening with a friend - experience was just as good as the 1st, Lauren was our server again, and I converted my friend into a new fan.

Most restaurants in this area are similar: small portions, mediocre food with little to no seasoning and expensive to boot. \n\nWe went for the prix fixe menu on Valentine's Day and we were supremely disappointed. Nothing on the menu (we ordered 7 things) reminded me anything of Mediterranean cuisine. Few examples of the disappointment: \n- Salmon appetizer tasted like salmon cream cheese out of a plastic tub\n- Crab salad could fit into my palm\n- Beef (main) lacked salt and was completely under seasoned\n-Halibut (main) had a bland sesame crust and had guacamole salsa lazily thrown on top\n\nBarcha (and similar $$$ restaurants in this area) takes advantage of the downtown traffic and serve mediocre food.

The cocktails were really good (earned them one star) but the wine carafe we ordered was just ok.  The food was good -- enjoyed the octopus, kale caesar salad, red pepper dip with soft boiled egg.  We also order the steak kabobs and wished the restaurant gave us more than a butter knife to cut the steak.  The service was terrible.  We ordered dessert which came out along with a comment from the waitress that we had 7 minutes to eat it!  We paid our bill and I went to the bathroom... the waitress came by again around 7:35 saying she needed the table so we had to leave.  Seriously?!  We had a legitimate reservation and were getting kicked out after spending $300 for a party of 4!  Never again will I return to this restaurant.  We complained to the hostess at the front and he claimed the waitress didn't know we had a reservation however, before we were even seated, we were given the \"you need to leave the table by 7:30\".

He explained to us that the only way he would let us join our friends' table was if we ordered entrees, even though half the place was empty and there was space at our friends' table. We offered to sit at the bar, but he kept insisting we purchased entrees. Obviously the management at Barcha cares more about upselling their customers and not much else. If you want to be treated as another check at this place, be their guest. When we mentioned we were going to leave a review about our experience, their attitude changed and they offered to let us stay and order cocktails, but we took our business elsewhere.

No apology, no comp. \n\nWe all ordered our $30+ entrees, which were underseasoned and unremarkable. I ordered the eggplant and potato brik and can't even remember the flavors 2 days later. But it definitely didn't exude the goat cheese, farm egg, green tahini I'm seeing on the menu. \n\nSo now we're sitting here, and eating, and chatting, and we're done with our meals. Dessert! we say!

You didn't think to tell us the kitchen was closing and we should order anything else we may want?? Like EVERY OTHER restaurant?? \n\nThat's ok. At least we have leftovers.

Despite the fact that we were in a corner and against the windows, our server checked in on us regularly and made sure we were attended to. That was a plus. But honestly the food was disappointing. The best thing I had was the hummas appetizer. But it was a mixed bag. On the one hand the hummus was very tasty and fresh but I didn't care for the flat bread that accompanied it. The bread was fried (which in and of itself is ok if done well) and too greasy for my taste. It made the food seem just too heavy. Same comment for the shawarma I had. It was wrapped in that same heavy overly oily flat bread. Made me want to blot it before eating it.  In addition, the chicken filling and condiments not all that tasty and actually kind of bland. Not that usual medley of flavors you get from the meats, seasonings and sauces in a sandwich like that. I didn't even finish it. Plus, the side of salad that came with it was totally over dressed and soggy. Erg. My friend's salad was fine and she seemed to enjoy it. But overall, the food was to me was just so-so for the price point. There are many good middle eastern places downtown to choose from for lunch, so if you're going to charge that much of a premium (which they do), the expectation and the bar is set higher. I want to pay not just for the sit down dining room, but also for an elevated caliber of food.", "author": "Lori H."}

The sweet beets at a very nice touch to it and the dressing ratio on it overall is perfect! Must get! I will literally come in, just to get this dish alone. \n\nCHICKEN CROQUETTES- Another must get dish. Very moist and well done. Inside has a creamy white sauce mixed in but it's not too heavy. The toppings on top is another fantastic compliment. Gotta get 2 of these dishes, as 1 will not be enough.\n\nHUMMUS Flat bread- Another pick me upper for a mid-day snack or pre-lunch app. Well made with tons of flavor.\n\nSPICY PORK TURNOVER- Skip it. Super carb heavy and not all that. Get a 2nd croqueta dish if you want more food.\n\nBLISTERED 'PADRON' PEPPERS- My friend said the yogurt sauce in it was really good. \n\nLamb sewer- Kinda dry if you ask me. It's just mehh... Skip it. \n\nCRISY NEW POTATOES- Ok, not a must have. Simple and plain unless you get a side of their dipping sauces. Even then I would skip. \n\nWALNUT KATAIFI BAKLAVA- I normally love baklava, but this shredded dessert was kinda a mess. Took one bite and left it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-17", "description": "We tried this place out last night.  My partner's friend from college was in town for work and we wanted to take him to a restaurant that offers more unusual dishes and that is within walking distance to his hotel and so, check & check!  \n\nWhen we arrived, at around 7pm, the place was rather empty, with only about 2 tables occupied.  Soon after we were seated, our server asked us if we wanted to order any drinks.  We asked for a little time to get acquainted with the menu.  Within a few minutes, while we were obviously still discussing food choices, he was back again about the drink order.  At that point, we felt pressured to look at the drink menu and make a decision.  When we did, we were dismayed to see that the font for that menu was a size 8 or 9, too small for aging eyes, especially in combination with very dim lighting.  We finally settled on a carafe of very dry Turkish wine.  But the whole experience up to then was not exactly pleasant, with a server that is gruff and impatient.  Fortunately, after our drink order, the rest of the evening flowed better.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes: Crushed avocado, olive oil poached tuna, duck kefta, hummus and crispy new potato side dish.  My favorite items from all the dishes turned out to be the flatbread that came with the avocado and hummus and the potato side.  The flatbread was sooooooooo buttery and perfectly garlic-y.  The potatoes were exactly as described, and the simplicity of it is divine!.  While everything else is good enough, there was nothing outstanding to make me want to come back for more.  \n\nAnd while our experience with our server ended in a neutral note, I would advise the management to keep closer tabs on the staff in general.  For example, we noticed an employee (trainee?) knock down a jacket hanging on a customer's chair while passing.  Instead of picking it up, he turned his head to observe what he did, then continued on!  Also, though the restaurant was less than a third full by the time we were wrapping up and there seemed to be a good amount of people working, they were so behind in bringing out food that the chef got involved in serving!

As lovely as the vibe was, the chairs are kinda cheap; very rickety, hard, pokey and uncomfortable. I had to ask one of my party to switch with me and I sat in a booth so I could enjoy my lunch. \n\nI got the orzo salad with falafel on the side which was yum (with a nice little tzatziki cream), and my friend got a quinoa salad which she liked. The description on yelp says small plates, but they are actually huge with decent portions. I will definitely try it again, but probably as takeout (because of the chairs). The rosemary-cherry lemonade was good and the mint lemonade was like a virgin mojito.\n\nWe are coming back next month for our office holiday party, so I hope the chair issue is addressed and more comfortable seating is chosen. As they are in the Sens family of restaurants, I was surprised at the low-budget choice, given the rest of the d\u00e9cor.

A bustling atmosphere (sit in the back if you want it a bit more quiet for a business lunch), and they have one of the few outdoor dining areas downtown, which we have been sorely lacking in SF. \n\nThey have one of the best lunches in FiDi, but i'm not alone in that opinion, so you'll want to get reservations. Even as busy as they are, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a reserved table and there's never been a delay in my food coming out of the kitchen. Even at the busiest time, when the place is packed, my water glass is kept full.\n\nI've made it part of my regular rotation now and I haven't had anything there that I didn't like. The salads are great, but I have a difficult time not ordering the Schwarma when I go.  The Classic (Turkey and Veal) reminds me of a Schwarma I had once in Paris. I asked for the recipe, but no luck. If any of you are able to weasel it out of them, let me know! The sandwich is big enough to take 1/2 of it home if you're not famished - I'll often start with a small plate and then do exactly that.\n\nIf you sit at the kitchen counter you can see them making everything they serve - and it all tastes homemade.\n\nMy company hasn't used them for catering yet, but waiting for my table the other day a woman was bragging that her company brings in food from Barcha every couple of weeks. Maybe I need to switch companies, Ha!", "author": "Mark P."}

I asked our waiter for another salad recommendation and he told me a popular option, which was the kale Caesar, and then his favorite which was an endive salad which I can not remember the name. I am glad I took his recommendation because I will be coming back for this salad now.  It was so fresh, and delicious my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. With sliced apple, cranberries,  and candied nuts, you would think it was going to be a really sweet salad.  What was great was that the light citrus dressing, onions, endive, and point eyes blue cheese really balanced it out and all together made such a great combination. I wasn't too hungry, and my boyfriend to his regret had just filled up on fries at a nearby bar so we decided to go straight to dessert from there. We got a chocolate dessert which I unfortunately also don't know the name of, but it had a toasted marshmallow looking swirl on top which had a light hint of lemon in it. It was rich and went well with the wine I was drinking. I've tried desserts like this at other places and I got to say, Barcha nailed it. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic with gold lamp fixtures that displayed lovely designs all over the walls, and candles at every table. Even the manager wore a beautiful red dress that was very fitting to the mood of the restaurant. \n\nOver all, everything was delicious and our server had great descriptions of the wine for me and knew what to recommend.

I had the lamb kebab sandwich.  Very flavorful and also very juicy, which makes it a bit hard to eat with decorum, but worth the effort.  The sandwich comes with your choice of one side--crispy new potatoes, bulgur wheat or mixed greens.  I had the crispy new potatoes which were very good--outside crispy inside creamy smooth.  At $17, the price is a bit high for the portion size, but the overall quality is very good.\n\nThe wine list  is heavy on Mediterranean wines,  Greek, Turkish and Italian. Two pours are offered, a 3 ounce and a 6 ounce.  I had a full-bodied Italian red that was a perfect accompaniment to the lamb sandwich.  We did not have dessert.  \n\nEntrees were a bit slow coming from the kitchen considering the restaurant was mostly empty.  San Francisco is a seaport, so the restaurant should have more seafood offerings. An olive oil broiled salmon and a prawn sandwich are the only seafood on the menu.  I originally ordered the salmon, but they were sold out.  A fish of the day would be a welcome addition, as would a soup of the day.  It was a cold day when we ate there and soup would have hit the spot just right.\n\nOn the whole we enjoyed our visit to Barcha, and intend to return again.", "author": "patrick c."}

The meat they put in this sandwich was at least 50 PERCENT fat and gristle. It was completely flavorless, if you don't count all nasty fat crunchiness and cartridge. I'm not sure what they are doing wrong at this place -- shawarmas are meant to be ultra lean due to being cooked so slowly. Major fail at this restaurant.

We were offered additional pita to go with the remainder of our hummus (they bring you one, uncut). We were charged $3 for that additional pita, and again, never told about it when the waitress *offered* to bring us one.

We ordered two of the chopped salads, with shrimp added, one classic shawarma and one chicken skewer sandwich, and some sides for folks to share:  the potatoes and the bulgur.  Everyone liked what they had.  However, the chopped salads were not chopped at all.  There was no chopping that had been done on these salads.  They were full leaves of little gem lettuce, with the other ingredients mixed in.  Tossed does not equal chopped.  A CHOPPED SALAD SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOPPED.  The shrimp that was included with each chopped salad was in the container with the salad, but was still on the skewers as it had been cooked.  It was very messy to get the shrimp off the skewers, with plastic utensils.  I would recommend taht they take the shrimp off the skewers in the kitchen, for salad orders.

About a week and a half ago, my 2 friends and I made lunch reservations for 1:00 pm at Barcha.  When we arrived at about 5 minutes to 1:00 pm, we saw 3 people at the front desk, pouring over a computer.  They asked us to wait.  And we waited and waited, and saw that they sat 2 other parties (who just walked in off the street) before us.  They did not even try to accommodate us (we saw an empty table with 2 chairs -- most restaurants would have added a third chair and sat us).  We finally left at 1:12pm because of the total unprofessionalism of their staff (neither of the 3 people at the front desk appeared to know what they were doing).  Come on Barcha, if you're going to train people, please do not do so during a busy lunch hour.  And please don't seat walk-ins before those who already have reservations - that does not look good for you.
