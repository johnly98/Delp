On my personal tour de San Francisco almond croissants, looks like we have struck gold(Hoping someone catches the history reference here). \n\nThe exposed brick, the rustic furniture...its likehome n Country magazine come to life. Parking is somewhat of a challenge(yes some people actually drive around here), but it's so worth the struggle! \n\nThorough bread and bakery is a picturesque cafe featuring mostly French inspired pastries and freshly baked breads. There are also lunch items like salads and sandwiches.\n\nAlmond croissant - super flaky, buttery, and straight up delicious. The almond filling is not too sweet, featured inside the croissant, and brace yourself for this one...ON TOP of the croissant. Let's marinate on that for a few seconds....\n\nHam and cheese croissant - again with the buttery flakiness. I have no idea what the filling is, but it's certainly not simply ham and cheese. I would guess some sort of bechamel? Either way, simply delicious! \n\nSan Fran is loaded with world class bakeries, but with Thorough, Ive landed on my favorite thus far. One can say that I thoroughly....enjoyed. See what I did there?!", "author": "Donald S."}

Why?\n\nI've visited this place twice while I'm currently working in the area, and I think both visits were good. The pastries that I got were pretty yummy. 1st time I got the Almond Croissant & The Rustic in which I liked the Rustic more. Then 2nd time I got a Mocha, The Rustic, and Apple Frittata (?) in which I liked the Apple one more because it reminds me kinda like an apple pie. \n\nOverall this place is pretty rusticly cute, and it's cool they have a patio/backyard area for people to enjoy their pastry & coffee.", "author": "Amy C."}

You see, I usually find scones dry and tasteless, but there was something about this one that called my name. It made me want to give more scones a chance.

It's nice to be able to sit close to where the magic happens, and the display of breads and pastries is very inviting.\n\nThere's an outside patio in the back that has almost as much seating as inside.

Their coffee is always delicious and unassuming, this isn't Starbucks after all. Oh! Their almond croissanttttt. Get some of that and thank me later.\n\nI've always wanted to sit in their back patio and read a book, but it would appear that I'm not the only person who's had that idea.

So we finally got around to visiting together before work the other day. My reason for giving this place 4 stars is solely on the cafe itself. I would definitely come back here to enjoy a cup of coffee (while I didn't have any this visit, it is Sightglass coffee, so I know it will be decent). I believe this place could become my new \"work\" cafe, especially on a nice day. There is ample seating inside or on the front \"patio\" and the cutest courtyard in back. I imagine this place could get busy but unlike other coffee shops in the area, I wouldn't need to be on my computer with my elbows tucked in or with it on my lap. \n\nThis was a quick visit. So I got a brussel sprout/poblano quiche to go. While it was very very good, the crust was perfectly buttery and flakey, it was a bit rich for my liking. It was so rich I couldn't even finish it.

It had a multitude of thin, buttery layers and a tasty filling. I think the chocolate bread was made from sourdough. It had that distinct sourdough flavor and tasted pleasantly of chocolate.

So I didn't bother asking any more complex questions, like are the eggs pasture-raised, etc. The website has no info and when I emailed them I received no response. So with a lack of information to base this on (other than the fact that they serve Sightglass coffee) I'm giving a neutral rating that I'll update if I hear back. It's a pity because they are the bakery outlet for the SF Baking Institute - transparency on ingredients should be part of what they teach.\nInterested in writing green star reviews?

Everything looked amazing... I wanted to order all of it!!! It's a lovely coffee shop/patisserie/sandwich place. The decor gives you that rustic and homey feel, taking you back to your mother's or grandmother's kitchen.\n\nSMELL: Don't even get me started on the smell. The smell of fresh bread lingering throughout my entire 30 minute existence at the place can't accurately be put into words. Seriously, I'm not even mad that I still smell like bread.\n\nTASTE: I ordered the gougeres (amazing deal by the way), ham & cheese croissant, and chicken melt sandwich. All super tasty. They all had the right amount of flakiness and crisp that makes you wonder HOW?! \n\nTOUCH: The items that I ordered were soft and heated at the right temperature. Not greasy or oily like most pastry places.\n\nHEARING: Gosh, I love the customer service. Quick, friendly, and gets the job done!\n\nNote: Unfortunately, this place is not in downtown SF, so I can't just walk outside my office and it'll magically appear.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-18", "description": "Those that know me know that I like to frequent bakeries and that I like gougeres. A good friend at work lived near this bakery and once brought me a few gougeres from Thorough Bread. I had not heard of this place at that time, so I thought he had gone to a horse show. \nA few minutes passed, and I polished them off. I tried to savor all four, because they're small, but leave some carbs on my desk and you're asking them to disappear.\nSo naturally I paid Thorough Bread & Pastry a visit after that taste... and a couple more times after that. The childlike crayon logo is very charming.\n\nGougeres - 4 for $2? 12 for $4.50? \nI'll take 2 dozen please. I'll serve them proudly on a plate and pretend they are homemade. Just kidding...kind of. A gougere is a cheese puff. Given the price and inconspicuous appearance, you wouldn't think much of them, but I found them to be executed well. The dough was light and puffy, with many pockets of air. The cheese and chive flavor was savory and well-balanced.\n\nChouquettes - 4 for $2\nBasically the sweet version of puff pastry, topped with a few specks of pearl sugar\n\nCream Puffs - 3 for $3.50\nA rather light cream puff with chocolate drizzled on top, also with pearl sugar. delightful\n\nDanish - $2.00\nI had a blueberry and a cheese danish. Both were delicious and flaky with a glaze. The blueberry could have used more fruit filling. The cheese danish was just creamy and smooth.\n\nAlmond Croissant - $3.50\nThis is an excellent croissant, super flaky and airy with generous almond paste on top and lots of almond slivers. I think it rivals some of the best almond croissants in the city.\n\nApple Galette - $2.50\nVery good apple tart. Thinly sliced apples baked on top of flaky pastry. There was a shiny, sweet glaze on top that added sweetness and was probably a good glue to keep the apple slices in place\n\nChocolate Bread - $3.50\nI didn't have high hopes for chocolate bread. I thought it would be dry, but it was pillowy inside with a nice outer crust. The best part was it was loaded with chocolate chips.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - $1.50\nThin, crunchy cookie, also with plenty of choc chips\n\nBasil Mozzarella Sandwich - $7\nThe bread on the sandwich was excellent of course. The tomatoes & mozzarella tasted fresh. I love a good simple caprese sandwich, but I would have preferred it toasted. It seemed like they had just finished serving their morning crowd and didn't bother to ask us if we wanted it toasted. Oh well. It also came with some mixed greens. \n\nThorough Bread has a lot of variety - pastries, fresh bread, cakes, sandwiches, etc. Grabbing a few things to eat and hanging out in their outdoor patio in the back is a good way to spend a sunny afternoon.

Thorough Bread got onto my radar when I was walking on Church St one day, and I've enjoyed their delectable pastries ever since.\n\nFrom their almond croissants to their macaroons, I've never been disappointed in their baked goods.

So cool. Love when I discover those.\n\nWe ordered an almond croissant, some fruit danish, and an apple gallette. All of them were fresh, flaky, and delicious! We sat outside on the patio since all the seats inside were taken. It had been raining earlier, so the atmosphere was like a tropical rainforest. Quaint and quiet place to hang out with friends and/or pets while snacking on your pastries. Oh and don't forget to purchase a baguette on your way out! I'll have to do that next time.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I've had terrific pastries, coffee that's okay, and the staff is super friendly.\n\nHowever, if I'm honest, small things change over time that have made it not what I remember it to be. The prices, but I can live with that (costs are going up for them too I'm sure!). But then today, they told me they won't even slice the bread they bake anymore on request - at up to $10/loaf, is slicing such a big deal for them (or at least allowing me to even do it, which I asked)? And what bakery doesn't do something that simple, especially if a simple machine does it easily? While the frontline staff seemed apologetic for some management directive, there's no reason they could provide beyond \"we've been told we're not allowed to slice bread anymore.\"\n\nIt's one small thing, but I feel it's this gradual loss of feeling excited to give you the best product you can get for the customer by people who are so excited about you getting to try their work. You pay for that, but you know you're getting what's potentially the best product for 100s of miles. It's now more apathetic, and \"take it or leave it - we really don't care\" attitude. That's what I know is standard in other cities, but I've always loved shops in SF because they didn't do that.\n\nI'm just going to Whole Foods now for bread - I get \"take it or leave it\" and only marginally lower quality at much much less price. It's just not worth the hassle.\n\nADDENDUM: I think I was a bit harsh in my initial review.

Thorough Bread is reliable and though prices have crept up, it is quite affordable for the quality. \n\nRecently I spent hours trying to make chouquettes for a party. The sugar was burnt, they were too eggy, and they were deflated. I totally forgot I could just buy them here (prices keep changing but they are now 50 cents).

It was raining this morning and I really needed a good pastry to start the day off.

I got my croissant to stay, so when I sat down, took a big breath (and a few photos) and took a bite only to find that my croissant tasted overly chewy as if it was somewhat stale, I was a little sad.  It had all the potential in the world with a light dusting of powdered sugar and almonds, and wasn't overly sweet to the point where I had a hard time eating it.  It was cold, and not buttery and flaky like the croissants I had at other places most recently.  While I'd like to say that maybe some of this was because I didn't get them when they came fresh out of the oven, I also would think that by sitting down and eating it right away and by coming at 8AM would have prevented that.  In any case, I know that Thorough gets a lot of rave reviews from a lot of enthusiasts with tons of experience, so I'm hoping I caught them on an off day.\n\nIn a small additional minor note, a few people mentioned the poor customer service here, and while no one was overly rude to me in any way, I did notice the lack of enthusiasm and smiles when I was ordering and when I had asked for a small bag to take away my pastry in.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I recommend getting anything that has \"almond\" in the name and you can't go wrong with anything that has fruit in it.

Whoddathunk I'd end up buying so many pastries?! (Okay I had just the slightest inkling I would, but anyway...)\n\nI ended up picking up some cream puffs, a rustic fruit tart, almond croissant, bacon scone, and blueberry scone. Not even halfway through the batch yet, but I have a feeling this will still thoroughly cover my thoughts either way:\n\n* Cream Puffs - Their take on this classic, with some chocolate drizzle and sugar crystals on the outside, is divine, and probably among the tastiest ones I've had to date. I was super tempted to pick up another dozen of these before I left, but, the resistance was strong in this one.\n\n* Almond Croissant - Filled with frangipane of course, and also quite tasty. Not quite as stellar as some of the ones I've had in Seattle, but up there for the Bay Area, and gives the ones are Tartine a run for their money: choose Thorough's if you like yours slightly less sweet. And either eat it fresh here, or take it home and toast for some extra goodness.\n\n* Blueberry Scone - I still don't know if authentic scones are supposed to be soft and fluffy, or harder biscuit like things, but theirs is more the former than the latter (a la Arizmendi). Not bad on its own, but would probably be far more delicious when warm, and served with some salted butter.\n\nA solid 3.5, and a place I'll come back to, if not just for those cream puffs...\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A decent sized bakery/cafe, mostly filled with two tops to the side, and the pastry displays to the right. Fairly accessible when the place isn't packed, but I suspect getting back to the front door when there's a line might be a little difficult, as there's really only enough width for 1.5 people. As for the tables themselves, the two tops are small enough, with large enough feet, that you might not be able to scoot in as much as you'd like. It's not the worst, but it could be better.\n\nBathroom - Totally accessible!", "author": "Johnny W."}

AND I finally got my hands on some sourdough.\n\nI bought two sourdough loaves and one multigrain, which I smuggled on my plane home. My husband and I have been hacking into them for days and they are still really pleasant. I just love knowing they are in our kitchen.

Sandwiches are delicious, perfectly garnished and the bread, oh the bread ... the best bread in SF. But let me back up. When you walk into the space, it smells like a bakery. Slightly sweet like brown sugar, with a hint of fresh yeast bread, and coffee undertones. It smells like fresh handmade baked goods, but not so strong you can taste it. The pastries displayed are beautiful and fancy, but not intimidating. The staff is very kind and not rude when you don't know what you want right away like some other well known SF bakeries.\n\nThe cookies were delicious. \n*Brown butter chocolate chip - A++. Perfectly cooked, the slight nutty-ness of the brown butter coming through, crispy edges, and a good ratio of chocolate chips to cookie. \n*Oatmeal raisin - A. They thankfully do NOT put nuts in the oatmeal raisin so the oat flavor comes through. \n*Dark chocolate - great dark chocolate flavor. Solid B, would be amazing dipped in some coffee or hot chocolate. \n*Snickerdoodle - C. It was delicious and the texture was perfect, but it lacked the full snickerdoodle flavor. Like there needed to be a ton more cinnamon in the sugar cinnamon rolling before baking. \n*Castro Cookie - A+, a definite must. It's not only cute, but the recipe is perfect. Delicate crumb texture and flavor. And it's a great size.\n\nYes, we got other things, but the cookies didn't even make it through the ride home. No regrets. Don't want this spot to get popular. However, I want everyone to go and support them and treat your taste buds. Next time I will maybe make it to the outside seating area. But contemplating which sweet treats to get while enjoying an amazing sandwich is always too tempting.", "author": "J Z."}

Fortunately the best thing happened... a local walked over and asked if he could help.\n\nWe were wandering around the Castro district trying to decide what to do next since the shops were starting to peter out. So rather than ask for directions to a particular place, I said, \"Is there a good bakery around here?\" He suggested a few nearby, but his personal favorite was clear. Thorough Bread.\n\nIt was just a block off Market and the minute we walked in the door we knew we had a winner. It started with the whimsical loaf of decorative bread (imprinted with cupid and hearts for Valentine's Day). Then we might have done a collective sigh as we saw the pastry case.\n\nOne chocolate dipped macaroon and a Napoleon later and we were two very happy girls. Our blissful visit contined on the back patio which is a completely relaxing spot assuming you can find a table. This place isn't overly fancy and didn't have the long lines of some other cafes we passed, but it was pleasantly busy. I think it qualifies as a neighborhood gem.

It looked like they were sold out of their almond croissants, but it turns out more were just coming out of the oven, so I'm glad I asked!

My friends who have lived in the city longer than I have discover the shop from me. I admit the competitor a few blocks near has some good stuff, but I champion Thorough Bread all the way and I will tell you why.\n\nUsed as a training shop for the San Francisco Baking Institute, you'll see many intern graduates perfecting their craft in artisan-baking. You'll delightfully taste their training in everything you choose to indulge in. Behind the counter and cases filled with pretty pastries and cakes you can peer into the busy open kitchen while the aroma of fresh baked goods arouse your your appetite. Be awed by the occasional full scale sculpture they bake here (christmas tree and a Jean Paul Gaultier corset are two I can remember). \n\nThe shop offers a variety of fresh breads, pastries, cakes, cookies as well as sandwiches in an amazingly affordable prices.\n\nTheir most loved creation is the buttery and flaky almond croissant with its signature lightly sweetened almond filling and topping of crunchy almond frosting for $2.50 a piece. Available also are the chocolate, ham & cheese and regular croissants. Another favorite is the mini cream puff made by injecting fluffy cream into buttery chouquette then drizzled with a bit of chocolate and crunchy clumps of sugar crystals for only $2.50 per 3 pufflets! These delicious nibblers often accompany me to many dinner parties and picnic invitations. Other delightful items in the pastry category include a number of fruit danishes & tarts, chocolate & coffee eclairs and the savory mushroom vol au vent, bacon & potato turnover, and sweet potato turnover. I've had them all and they're equally delicious.\n\nThere's no better place in the city to get fresh and good artisan breads for such good prices (less than $5) than Thorough Bread. If you love bread puddings, you'll be happy to know they make them in large squares sweet or savory that easily fill up your tummy. You might have to share, only if you can of course.\n\nI've yet to dive into the beautiful cakes and good looking sandwiches, despite the fact I've been a regular for over a year. Trying everything means I have to order something different each time I go, which is hard to do when the memory of the last thing I tried still lingers pleasantly in my mind. I have no doubt when the time comes, I'll be just as satisfied with the cakes and sandwiches at Thorough Bread. They have a high standard here. If you love cakes, you'll love the variety here and the individual portion they come in. They also make larger cakes that you can pre-order or pick up on a moment's notice.\n\nI can go on and on about how I love Thorough Bread, but there's only three more things you need to know. First, service is always with a smile and efficient even when busy. Second, walk through the back door to a lovely secret patio to enjoy your pastry with a hot beverage. Third, take comfort in the fact the Frenchies frequent the shop.\n\nEnjoy and you're welcome!", "author": "Rina W."}

Scones elsewhere are usually bricks of dry dough, but this scone was lighter than croissants I've had elsewhere.

The price at this place is nice but thats the only upside.\n\nThe quality of the croissant was lame (very dry, not buttery) and tasted sour.  The Danish was a tart, not a Danish, and only about the size of a 50 cent piece, had no center filling bit just three raspberries, not even in a raspberry sauce or something, just sitting there in the center of some over dry unglazed pastry dough.  And lastly the service was only okay, the girl who helped us scoffed when I asked if they had a Danish as if I was supposed to know at this one bakery thats what they call a tart.

With the huge area, I don't think they couldn't put a better bakery but Thorough Bread.  \n\nWhile still being one of jurors, wife and I came here for dessert/snack for her lunch intermission. I was also on my way to work, which is also in the same building. I'm sure some of you know what type of dangerous work I do. \n \nEvery single pastries and bread are made in the actual bakery.The bakery is also a deli making Panini sandwiches made with freshest ingredients with the bakery's bread. With the elegant and nice presentations on the counter and depending on your desires, there are so many great options to choose. Also, wife was panting and salivating like a hungry-dog.  \n\nLet's see...okay, I'll start. I had one of the bakery's Almond Croissant and a medium Latte, both for $2.50 each. I've always enjoyed Tartine's Almond Croissant Pastry.

The $5.50 treat is a slice of Gallete soaked in a \"STRONG\" Rum. After one bite of the alcoholic treat, she felt inebriated, but happy. According to her, the bakery must've put Bacardi 151(proof) in the strong treat. Not a bad way to go back to court feeling buzzed. She also add a Peppermint Tea to complete the treat. The tea is from Harney and Son's Fine Tea. \n\nBaba Au Rhum: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MTIqLOBdISaon4G22qb5Lg?select=Xq_DgcRNxBSIx0K7AHxVPQ\nPeppermint Tea: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MTIqLOBdISaon4G22qb5Lg?select=GzlPSXyglbE1ef2_F_SLtw\n\nI'll defintely be back and check out more of the fresh pastries and check out the Panini Sandwiches.", "author": "Matt G."}

I was SO happy to see that there was only 2-3 people ahead of me in line! \n\nMy biggest complaint was that I felt rushed in ordering and felt like I couldn't really look at the selection. I ended up getting a Blueberry scone, eclair, and almond croissant. First of all, the prices were so reasonable and I walked out of there for under 8 bucks which I consider a steal for how delicious the pastries were. \n\nThe almond croissant was great! Although, it was a little bit too rich for me and I couldn't get through the whole thing. Halfway through, the almond flavor became too pungent and sweet. But it's great for sharing and is definitely worth trying. \n\nI don't like scones much but my boyfriend does and we both loved this one! He couldn't stop raving about it calling it the best scone he has ever had. It's not dry like those terrible Starbucks scones. It was moist and each bite basically had crumbs that trailed off because of how soft it was. \n\nThe eclair was good, too. It was no Tartine though- haha. \n\nThis is a great alternative to Tartine if you're looking for a pastry and don't want to wait.

My daughter was in baked-goods heaven, as were all the adults in the group!!!\n\nIt's probably a good thing that we don't live in the city because I'd be a 500lb person living close to this place. \n\nThe Almond Croissant was impossibly good, the Castro Cookies were fabulously fun, the quiche was sublime, the blueberry little cake was superb...I could go on and on. Really, one of my most favorite spots in the city. I know I'll be visiting there again when we go back to the city!!!", "author": "Colleen C."}

Like most bakeries, do not come here before closing and expect to find the best variety. This can be considered a good thing, since it likely shows that most of the baked goods were already bought out. \n\nI don't think I've tried even half of the items sold here, but everything I have tried tasted superb. The mousse cake varieties are my favorite so far. For you lemon fans out there, the lemon blackberry moussecake is especially  delicious. The moussecakes here are layered with a slightly spongy cake, followed by a generous mousse filling. \n\nThe macarons are pretty good too. I got petite ones that were pre-packaged in a tube. Flavors vary from day to day. \n\nOther things I liked:\n \n+Before entering:\nThe display window advertises the shop's crafty side. I've noticed multiple themes from skeletons made of bread to macaron trees. Each display is of intricate quality, revealing craftmanship, skill, and hard work.  \n\n+Backyard seating:\nThere's an option to eat outside of the shop towards the back. It mimics one's backyard, almost garden-like. Very intimate and refreshing. \n\n+Hot drinks:\nWarm up your belly with a steamy beverage. The hot chocolate and espresso based drinks pair perfectly with the foods here. \n\n+Cookies\nJumbo, crumbly, and soft. How every cookie should be.\n\n+Bread and pastry assortment:\nI love the concept used here. The breads and pastries look done free-hand style, not too perfect in shape or machine-made. There's a rustic and personal feel that really shines through, which is adorable and somehow alluring. \n\nI like this store and reccomend it to anyone embarking on a foodie adventure in castro. This place will without a doubt remedy anyone's sweet tooth. I will definitely be back for more moussecakes and to try new items!", "author": "Vaneza A."}

We split the one remaining chocolate bread, a generous-sized braided roll of chocolate yeast dough sprinkled throughout with chocolate chips. At $2.50, it was a good deal (and a much better deal than the insanely priced pie slices down the street at Chile Pies). The lattes were also good.

She came out and cleared up the miscommunication in a polite and direct way! I love that! Not only does it show accountability but also an individual approach. I am sure one negative yelp review for such a thriving business isn't a killer but the fact that she felt strongly enough to communicate to me and clear up the misunderstanding made me feel respected and valued as a customer. Really awesome! I am beyond impressed :)\n\nNow for the food! If you come here early enough the intoxicating aroma of fresh baking goods fills the air and envelopes you in a cloud of sweetness. The pastry I ended up sampling was a delicate on with apples layered on top. It was soft, light, flakey and just the right amount of not-too-sweet.

Haha. \n\nWe walked over and were amazed by the pretty little cakes! We didn't get any since we were stuffed and those cakes definitely would be better eaten at the bakery so we figured we'd just wait another time for them.\n\nI bought my grandpa a regular croissant, a almond croissant, a lemon pound cake, and I think sweet cake? It was $9 for all four. They were able to break my $50 and my boyfriend thought I paid $41 for everything! Haha. He was like whoah what did you buy? He got the ham and cheese croissant and the little diamond cookie things even though I told him they looked horrible. \n\nService was really nice and I wish we could've stayed and shared a cake or something because I would've loved to watch them make their magic in the open bakery. My grandpa said he had tons of baked goods already so I kept the sweet cake for myself. After reading these reviews, I wish I had kept the almond croissant, especially because I love almonds! Homph. Next time. \n\nThe sweet cake was a lot like bread pudding which is my favorite! It was filled with nuts and fruit pieces. There was also a white frosting on top but it all stuck to the bag by the time I ate it. The diamond cookies were eaten on the way to the car and they were pretty good, like little shortbread cookies.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Between my friend Helen and I, we shared a slice of the apple gallette tart and the almond croissant.  I also bought a bran muffin to eat later.  Verdicts:  \n\nAlmond Croissant - YUMMY.  Definitely one of the best croissants I've EVER had.  This 1000 calorie buttery sucker was oozing with marzipan, which I am typically NOT a fan of, but when it's carmelized and crunchy on the top, and melty in the middle... with glazed roasted almond slices on top of it... yeah... don't bother me I'm foodgasming...\n\nBran Muffin - Ok, so this was kind of a guilt purchase for consuming the oh-so-unhealthy, but oh-I-would-totally-eat-it-again almond croissant.  However, guilt didn't taste so bad this time. Muffin was moist, not too sweet, and had golden raisins in it - which are SO much better than regular raisins. If only guilt could be this sweet every time...\n\nApple tart - maybe 3.5 stars, which was sad because it was the prettiest dessert we ate. It was too thin though and the puff pastry it was baked on was kind of tough, maybe because it was so thin.\n\nAMBIENCE: This is one of the few places I've been to where the ambiance probably bested the food.  The inside of the bakery itself isn't much to write home about, but just keep going back and you'll enter a charming little patio outside.  Simply no better way and no better place to enjoy a gorgeous day in San Francisco (and DO treasure them because SF doesn't get many of them!) while having tea and pastries with one of your best friends. \n\nPRICES: Well... not cheap.  Not any more of a rip off than Starbucks either though, and between the two, I'd rather get tea here.  Helen and I paid about $15 for three pastries, a cup of tea and a cup of coffee. I'd pay $15 to enjoy that patio again.\n\nPARKING: HA!  Parking in the Castro?  Not unless you have a death wish.  Highly advise taking the N or J lines instead and getting off at Duboce and Church.\n\nVerdict - I must come back to try Thorough Bread's brunch!", "author": "Catherine C."}

On the recommendation of Paul K., this bakery was an automatic bookmarked destination.  When you arrive, don't just jump into the line as you'll find yourself stuttering, frazzled, or speechless when they ask for your order.  First, you start at the refrigerated case and select your sweets by process of elimination... do I need these calories?!  Then, you proceed to the small baked goods section which includes cookies, brownies, and coffee cakes.  Finally, before you reach the cash register, you'll see my favorite, the croissants.\nOn my most recent stop, my selections were:\na) Snickerdoodle - My favorite non-chocolate cookie.  Flavor was good and, as most cookies, great with that cold glass of milk.\nb) Chocolate Chip Cookie - Pretty good, though I'm used to more of a thick doughy texture for cookies (ala Specialty's).  Their cookies are thin and chewy good.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MTIqLOBdISaon4G22qb5Lg?select=8BhxmA88sJuj694dmY3jug)\nc) Almond Croissant - Heated one up for breakfast and, yes, it did not disappoint.  Buttery good on the outside with consistent almond paste flavor inside.  \nd) Chocolate Croissant - Light and flaky with just enough chocolate inside.  Another MUST HEAT before eating pastry. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MTIqLOBdISaon4G22qb5Lg?select=tMtiJTIslVSVeu4jhAwL3A)\ne) Chocolate Caramel Tart - Think of a gooey, delicious pie on a chocolate cookie crust.

Like, not burnt, taste great, and reasonably priced. My favorites have been the almond croissant, their potato bacon turnover, the sweet potato pastry thing, and most recently, the goat cheese caramelized onion turnover. (I think maybe the goat cheese caramelized onion turnover replaced the potato bacon? Haven't seen that in a while...) I've also had their bacon scones, ham & cheese croissant, savory bread pudding, one of the fruit tarts, some other stuff, and they're all pretty darn tasty. Try to get your stuff toasted, even if you need to run off.\n\nOh, and they recently started doing sandwiches!

One day I finally did and my head fell off my neck stick. Everything in here smells like heaven just shook out its dusty rug. Everything looks like a beautiful, buttered sculpture that's freshly been plucked from the oven and shoved in front of your eye holes. Everything tastes like it was made special for you by an entire swarm of French grandmas with family recipes. \n\nTo be fair, I haven't eaten many things here. But what I have eaten I've completely enjoyed. The always-fresh blueberry bran muffin gushes with juicy blueberries (but not too much so) and is tempered with delicious bran that makes me drop it like it's hot. Their macaroons make me thankful for being born. I vow to try every cake dessert they offer, because each one looks like a discotheque of sugar and sweets with prices so low I trip over them as I dance to the next display case. \n\nThe reason I give five stars? Because as I type this I'm \"chewing the muffin\" (if you know what I mean). And because, unlike most places in San Francisco worth their weight in saliva, there is never a line. It's generally busy, mind you, but what these guys get right in pastry deliciousness, they get even more right in service and realizing that you don't need an incredibly annoying line to attract people to your business. Each time I've been here they've had at least 3 cashiers helping the line along in an incredibly friendly and helpful manner - as if you are all together one and the same - united by the delicious snacks surrounding. This efficiency gets you in and out in under 5 minutes, with your delicious muffin sack tucked safely at your side. No line: a San Francisco miracle. You have the rest of the day to complete life goals! Like drinking the ocean, wondering if North Korea is real, and finally calling things off with your doctor who thinks \"you're a really neat girl\".

My sandwich had turkey, basil, tomato, dijon, & caramelized onions.  The onions needed more flavor & I wish the sandwich was more packed.  \n\nI tried the carrot cake as well.  That was pretty awesome, although I wish the cream cheese was creamier.  It is marzipanish, in a way.  It was still delicious, though.  We were a large group & they were especially accommodating.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, which included a variety of breads, croissants, coffee, & cappuccinos.  My niece's boyfriend swears by their chocolate bread, which he adds nutella to.  My niece buys a baguette every day.  They are both thin as hell, so I don't know... maybe there's something to the faddish \"French Diet.\"  hmmm.", "author": "Yelper Y."}

Except diamonds taste like glass.\n\nTheir almond croissant demands a plate, fork, knife, and a generous bib, the cape you don at a hair salon would work too (it's that assertive).  It's flaky, but not the least bit greasy.  Oh so light, but has enough chew towards the center.  The almond paste shell is smooth, mild, and delicate with almond slivers that graze on top.  THIS IS IT!  The coffee served in-store comes piping hot in saucer-sized mugs which I adore.   \n\nIf you see the delicate profiteroles (aka mini cream puffs) with chantily cream BUY AT LEAST 4, hell, a dozen.  Their dessert case alone is like an art gallery.  Yes, gaze at it, and sigh heavily like a Southern Belle.  The French own patisseries, and dammit, they know it too.  \n\nThe sandwiches on their flawless baguette is ridiculously simple and delicious.

Tartine's bread ties, but then you can't get T bread whenever you want it. In fact, you can't get it unless you know three, that's right three  days ahead that you are going to have a \"Bread Attack!\" \n\nAlmond Croissant IS the BEST in San Francisco! \n\nSticky Bun - The Same!\nExcellent Baguette and Sour dough bread!\n\nMy first visit, so you will have to wait for the cake and pastry review. How do I already know what that is going to be like?!!\n\n I feel like I am about to unleash the ten Plagues of Egypt. I know, so dramatic. Yet, here I am about to write the review that I never thought would be possible. \n\nFirst, I am a breadie, a sub set of the foodie (I'm all that too!) and there is, was, only one bread God in San Francisco. I was, for a long time, more than willing to put up with the inconvenience of serving the God of Bread, in order to have him/her provide me with that particular slice of heaven on those occasions that I needed my fix. And yes, a \"fix\" it was. There were pretenders to the throne, some of which were within a crumb's width of matching the God, yet none could quite get there. Outerlands, comes so close, their bread is outstanding!\n\nNow that is no longer true. Thorough Bread & Pastry has succeeded in creating a bread just as good as... sit down, ...Tartine's. \n\nDon't go all Al Bundy on me, if your Great provider has been overthrown, it is, after all, the way of the world. But wait you exclaim, \"You said that the bread was just as good, not better!\"\n\nYes, and thereby lies the tale. For those who truly love food, there is this (sometimes unspoken) relationship with those who create the food we delight in. For some, it is what we live for. Part of this relationship is the mutual respect that unfolds between the maker and the consumer of extraordinary products. In many cases this mutual respect revels itself when the artist who creates, thrives in knowing how well his creation is received. This is why, so many times, the ubiquitous Hole in the Wall place is so revered. The connection is intimate, and ultimately REAL!\n\nThorough Bread and Pastry succeeds fully, while Tartine, well made bread not withstanding, fails.\n\n Respect for the customer, understanding that while none of us who revel in what is made would ever, for a moment have any qualms over the producers of what we love so much, making a financial profit. It isn't ever about the cost of the product, it is always about having a mutual connection, and sadly, Tartine  believes it is a one way street.\n\n Thorough Bread and Pastry walks the walk. Their products are just as good and as noted in some areas exceed T. They also respect their customers in providing the products that they do so well, not as peasants who get whatever happens to be thrown their way.\n\nOf course what I fear most is adding to the numbers of people who will descend upon Thorough bread and Pastry when they read the reviews, but then, as they live up to their side of the bargain, then so must I.\n\nSo, if you are a foodie or better yet a breadie, then you must go to Thorough Bread and Pastry and try the recommended items, although once inside you will almost see delights that match your own preferences and try those instead (too?). You won't go wrong no matter what you decide to try.\n\nYou will get a big smile from the cashier (another plus for TBAP they have an efficient system that helps move the line, not an outdated someone takes order another cashes you out - slower and too many times one gets another person's order)\n\nBest of all, you don't have to call three days ahead - the ultimate slap in the face for those who truly love T bread -you can when you feel like having a really good bread, just go there and get it. For those who need to get it hot out of the oven, their Purple Wheat bread comes out by 11:30\n.\nThe cherry on top? The parking is better at Thorough Bread and Pastry. Baby cakes T, I know I hurt you with that, but then you deserve it. You broke the social contract - you believe that you don't need us. Worse, you could care less.", "author": "robert g."}

Actually Thorough's is flakier, tastier and best of all, not burnt! Also, Thorough's croissant is $2.00 cheaper then Tartine's. That's $2.00!!!! WTF! Really? \n\n3.)Thorough doesn't have me fighting over tables, chairs or benches. Let's just say, seating in general is a non-issue with Thorough. You don't have to behave like a prowling panther, waiting to pounce on any vestige of personal space. Thorough has this and to spare. \n\nI could go on and on, but I'll stop.

It is quickly becoming my new weekend morning routine.\n\nOver the last few weekends, my boyfriend and I took a lovely weekend stroll to Thorough Bread, specifically to try the almond croissant.  The first weekend, we just missed the delicious croissant by one customer, so we picked a few other pastries instead.  Every item we have tried has been mouth-watering delicious!  I have had the coffee cake (yes, I know, it is very middle-American of me), almond croissant, purple wheat baguette, and seasonal fruit tart.  I have always been extremely satisfied and always ready for more!  \n\nOf course, I cannot have a morning pastry without a delicious latte.  I prefer the whole milk double-shot latte.

A woman came, she asked what happened and I took the time to explain her the whole situation all over again, which was worse, she explained to me that some people had gone there before and lied about that, so if i didn't have the receipt then she couldn't do anything for me. I don't look or smell like a homeless person trying to steal some ciabatta bread .  She also said if someone forgot something there and didn't let them know they decide to give it away as a donation .

She only said\" well it's our policy\".\nI really wanted to talk to the manager but at that point I didn't feel like repeating everything again.

They do lack a bit of flair in my opinion.  For example, the ham and cheese croissant ($2.75) was light and tender, but without many layers.  I also like my croissants flakier.  The chocolate biscotti ($0.75) had great texture and taste: tiny chips, extra crunchy, dense - but it would be even better with some nuts or something extra.  The flavors are standard - almond or chocolate.  I'd love to see something more unique like Meyer lemon.  The snickerdoodle ($0.75) was tender and buttery but barely had any cinnamon on top. \n\nWhat a great space with the outdoor patio seating in the back, a bit of seating out front, brick walls and more indoor seating.  The colors are warm and rustic; the worn floor has charming hand-painted quotes.  They have an open kitchen though the bread is baked at their school (San Francisco Baking Institute) because they don't have the proper ovens there.  The bread is delivered around 9 AM and they offer discounted day-old bread.\n\nMorning pastries include scones, sticky buns, muffins, croissants, and Danish. I didn't see any brioche?  I wonder what types of sandwiches and soups they have - guess I have to come back in the afternoon to see.  The case had eclairs along with full sized and individual sized cakes.

When we entered , there was no line and yet about eight workers with their backs turned to us had us waiting to order for 5 min. When I did approach the front of house girl (note to whom it concerns, she had an upper lip piercing) if there was a menu we could see , she literally said\" yes there is, you can find it by the tip jar by the register.\" And so we went to this location and there was no menu, and the girl rather pretended to be busy when I think she was rather idling! Then another girl came to the register when we were waiting and I said\" hi, we would like to order some food? \" and she said\" somebody will be with you shortly.\" Then I approached the pierced front of house girl again and said \"do you still have sandwiches here?\" And she said,\" yes\" and was silent. Finally I just said \"can we order two pulled porks\" and it finally went from there. Basically, disappointing service ... And it took us 40 min to drive there, $3 to park, and then to just stand around and have aloof service . Here's a news flash: if somebody comes in with a baby and old man and they are standing at the register for five min, Help them! If somebody asks for a menu, get it!! If somebody asks do you still serve sandwiches, perhaps tell them which sandwiches are available for the day!

My SO complained that the croissant crust wasn't *quite* crisp enough and that it only matched up with typical bakeries in France, but it's downright impossible to do better here in the states.  The french bread had good hole structure, a chewey crumb and a golden, crunchy crust.  Clear Flour is my fav bakery back home (we're visiting SF for 10 days) and I'd say CF has the slightly better croissant and slightly worse baguette, but it's hard to complain about anything this good.\n\nThe apple gallete was downright amazing---tender, yet crispy crust; carmelized, yet firm apple slices.  Yummy!  You must try one before you die!\n\nWe went for breakfast today and ended up staying for lunch (sandwiches were quite good!) after learning that Thorough is a satellite of the SF Baking Institute, reading the \"Advanced\" book, meeting the VP as a result and chatting with a bread expert who was on staff!

Excellent baked breads and pastries.  Good, strong coffee in a generous sized cup, always hot and steaming.  Friendly service, personal greetings and kind words to welcome you in the morning.  Cream puffs that are so good they challenge my limited vocabulary.  Buttery butter croissants.  Savory bread pudding.  Don't be afraid to ask them to warm up your pastry for you.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that it highlights the lack of really good cafes/bakeries in the city.  This is a saving grace.  There are a few others if you exclude the ubiquitous Boulange (ahem... Starbucks) chain.  Tartine comes to mind.  But Thorough Bread is a rare find in a city that prides itself on the abundance of great food.  The prices are very reasonable - to the point that I often feel I'm being undercharged for such good quality.\n\nGets a wee bit crowded and confusing at times when the croissants and coffees are rolling out one after another in the weekend mornings.

I know the cute little SFBI students are schooled in making things taste good.\n\nCookies... cheap and tasty.  Sourdough... amazing.  Crispy on the outside, full of evenly spaced, gorgeous little holes, and a creamy color.  Perfect looking, perfect tasting.  A slight sourdough tang with complexity and a lovely depth of flavor.  The sesame semolina is excellent as well, boasting a nuttiness and crispy exterior that any baker would be jealous of.  Really, people, this bread is high class stuff.  And for $3+ a loaf.  I'm not saying I would pay much more... I mean it's bread, but I'm extremely happy that thorough, and SFBI is around.\n\nThey also have a number of delicious French and european things, like gougeres, and those almond macarons, and different kinds of cakes.\n\nOh and on the up and up, the service here has been rather good.  I'm not one to notice anything but the food, however, on the occasions I have been here, people have asked me whether I wanted to get free samples (yes!), helped me make the difficult which bread do I want decision, and been patient and understanding as I skulked around in general.

The bread is gorgeous, simply wonderful.  The sandwiches are great here too.  On a warm day it's nice to sit in their back garden and enjoy a hot cup of tea with a sandwich and a pastry (or two).  Thorough Bread and Pastry is the working portion of a bakery school and the employees are students learning how to run their own business.\nDid anyone else see the Christmas tree they made baked out of bread and decorated with cookies and baked goods.

Thankfully, I refrained from writing about them on my first visit (I wasn't especially impressed). My subsequent visits have been much better.\n\nMy favorite item is their baguettes. I usually grab the Acme or Semifreddi fare from Harvest Market or Golden Produce, but damn, Thorough makes some good baguettes. They also seem to be much fresher than what you'll find at the neighborhood markets. I also like the fact that they have a variety of bread sizes to suit your needs (love the little $1 ciabatta rolls)\n\nThey also have a variety of breakfast (fruit danishes, sticky buns, scones) and dessert pastries (cookies, brownies, fancy tarts and the like).\n\nI imagine this place will only get better with time. So if you have a bad first experience, be sure to give them a 2nd chance (that's my usual rule for fledgling neighborhood businesses -- it's all about supporting the local bidness).\n\nUpdate 5/29: I've upgraded my score for Thorough to 5 stars (from 4).

While it really represents a shift in my own perception, I have to say that their cakes are out of this world. After my dismal lunch experience, I was hesitant to dive into their desserts but I'm so glad I did. \n\nThe cakes are where it's at in Thorough Bread. For Christmas, I picked up a Buche de Noel from here that was a show stopper. Dusted with dark, tangy cocoa powder and combed with a serrated tool, it actually looked like a fallen tree limb. It tasted amazing: sweet but not too sweet and moist but not greasy. Then last night I picked up a lemon cream and raspberry cake that was mind-blowing.  We spent minutes dissecting the layers of the cake and discussing its construction. We all had second helpings and again, it garnered rave reviews.\n\nSo if you're looking to impress your friends and satiate your taste buds with deliciousness, go to Thorough Bread and Pastry. The coffee is good as well and that outdoor patio looks pretty sweet. It's slowly creeping its way into my food-driven heart.", "author": "Corey F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-18", "description": "4.5 stars to be exact! rating is for the pastries.\n\nrandomly walked into this little place a couple of years ago on the way to Dolores Park. i continue to thank the pastry gods to this day for deciding that i would unknowingly discover the greatness of Thorough Bread's baked treats.\n\nI walked in because their little chalkboard outside announced that they just introduced a variety of jalousie to their menu. ah jalousie, the last good one which i had up til then, in a little bakery in  Paris in the winter of a handful of years past. Thorough Bread offered a handful of fillings, and I asked one of the bakers behind the counter which she would recommend. She quickly said pistachio, and so I got that with a sticky morning bun to go. This was two years ago, mind you. i remember the flavors to this day.\n\npistachio jalousie: incredibly good. there were a couple of dark, tart cherries in there too, which was a great surprise. alas, they do not make jalousie anymore! i asked the french lady who works there about the jalousie on another visit, and she said they stopped making it due to its lack of popularity. felt a sharp jab to the heart, was about to fall to my knees with fist shaking in the air and scream 'NOOOOoooooooooooooooooo.....................'. refrained, got a baguette, felt a new kind of happy. but seriously, it would terrific to have their pistachio jalousie again. \n\nsticky morning bun: good, sweet, sticky. not my favorite item on their menu, but yummy nonetheless. make sure to have napkins and water to clean up after you attack this. best eaten with hands, the sticky fingers made me feel 4 again.\n\nalmond croissant: JUST DO IT. a must-order. 7 billion calories and 3 tubs of butter per croissant but choose to live a lot and jog the next day. love thyself, pamper your tastebuds with this. i tell people this; i'm not a fan of almonds, i'm not a fan of croissant. but together, and with all that butter... i choose to love myself. and jog til i drop tomorrow. maybe. when this is hot out the oven, GET ON THAT THING PRONTO!\n\nbaguette: so damn simple and tasty. i have the smaller one with butter and jam when i eat in, but it's amazing on its own too. just the right crunch/crisp exterior, with a wonderful pillowy and chewy interior. they do it right.\n\nchocolate bread: not usually a fan of chocolate, but this chocolate overload gets a thumbs up. chocolate bread with chocolate chips contained within. mmmmmmmmmm. i dunk chunks of this in hot coffee and indulge in feelings of BOSS.\n\nvol au vent: super flaky, with oozing bechamel at just the right richness and creaminess. the mushrooms taste super earthy, which brings tears of joy to my eyes. always a bittersweet moment when i finish one of these, because i do not want to appear gross and order another one when i have other pastries on the table. this is straight up delish.\n\ncoffee eclair: this was decent, it tasted good but i feel that the bakery's other offerings overshadow it.\n\nspinach quiche: not a fan, i thought it was way too eggy to be good. also, it had a light texture which did not seem to be up my ally. as i ate this, all i tasted was tamago/the sweet egg omelet staple served in most sushi joints.\n\nhomemade jams: Thorough Bread has quite a selection of these for sale. I've not bought an entire jar of any jam, but they do provide a small container of it to go with your baguette and other breads on request. i'm not sure how much they charge for this single serve, but do try out the different flavors. i love the subtle yet clear flavors of the jams, they taste very clean and 'natural'. the consistency differs per jam, with the runniest i've had being lavender. VERY floral-tasting; i liked it while a friend said it reminded her of her grandma R.I.P ... so to each his/her own on this. the plum jam is a personal favorite of mine, and i'm keen to try their rose jam sometime.\n\ncoffees: not the best, i personally think their basic black is weak most of the time. their lattes get pretty foamy though, which makes it fun to drink. i'm a fan of the milk foam 'stache, so i enjoy the froth. the mocha is alright tasting, not the smoothest i've had. would be great if they could up their coffee to match their splendid pastries, as it would elevate the pastry-eating experience to whole new level!", "author": "Eliza D."}

And so i had a croissant and bought a multigrain loaf, the bread was great and the croissant, fluffy and buttery.  That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship that peaked today when i discovered their sausage, mushroom bread pudding.  Seriously, this is the best thing since bread pudding.  It the breakfast cube of the future.  It's got eggs, bread, sausage, onions, 'shrooms, and a whole ton of yumminess.  I seriously have fallen in love with this.  Well it was a short lived relationship, since I kinda devoured it, but as they say, if you love something, stick it in your belly.  In addition, their coffee was strong and they bake a pretty mean bagel (though they need to get a better cream cheese spreader).  And I continue to pick up a loaf whenever I run out.  I also hear they have a pretty mean chicken sandwich.\n\nThe people at the cafe are pretty nice, and the patio out back seems perfect for those all too rare times when one may want to enjoy some time in the warm sun.  \n\nI definitely want to try out one of their purple wheat baguettes, I have so many ideas for what i want to do with those nubs on the ends!!!", "author": "Adrian L."}

There is a spacious patio in back if weather allows and you find the interior a bit cramped. \n\nThey serve a variety of pastries, all fresh and pleasing to both the eye and the palate.  Sandwich meats and cheeses are of the highest quality, all served of course, on homemade bread or rolls.\n\nOur favorites are the turkey sandwich served on a sesame roll and the roast chicken sandwich served on multigrain bread.

I like that they support the San Francisco Baking Institute's Bread and Pastry Professional Training Program. Contrary to others' comments, I don't think their prices are any different from any other good bakery in town, and, in many cases, are lower. My $2.50 lemon pound cake was a perfect afternoon treat and the little bag of sugar cookies I picked up from there on Easter was perfect.", "author": "Katie I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-21", "description": "Full disclaimer: I did not have any pastries during my visit here, so my review is probably skewed simply because of what I chose to order. Still, the sandwich that I paid almost $8 for was pretty lackluster. A turkey sandwich with carmelized onions ended up with minimal amounts of turkey, literally two small strips of onions and a whole lot of bread. And really, the bread wasn't so amazing that I missed out on the filling. For $8, I want more turkey!!! I want to feel like I got a good deal and a great sandwich, but I did not. I do like that they include a nice green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette with the sandwiches, but alas, even that wasn't enough to convince me to raise my score. Their pastries looked good, and according to the lady sharing my table, their croissants are \"decadent.\" I guess in my quest to not get fat this holiday season I missed out on their speciality. Their service was good and I like that they make their sandwiches to order, but meh, I probably won't ever need to go back.", "author": "Amanda S."}

The latte was tasty, and i think it was much better than the bland Church St Cafe that neighbors this store.   The baguette and focaccia were perfect.  The baguette was still warm on the inside, light, fluffy, delicious.  The focaccia was not only very tasty but also has an amazing buoyancy on the inside.\n\nThis bakery is a welcomed change from Tartine.  Although Tartine is DELICIOUS, this bread at thorough bread is also delicious, but you don't feel like eat bite is a pound of butter.  \n\nAlso, this place opens at 7am, which is a welcome change for the early morners in the area.", "author": "Andrew r."}

As soon as I arrived into San Francisco, first order of business was to go to two bakeries.. Tartine and Thorough Bread... and I'm so glad I saved the BEST for last!!  They're just in walking distance, roughly 7 blocks apart, so I deemed it 'exercise' to make room for more decadent pastries.  Very decently priced and even cheaper than Tartine.\n\nAlmond Croissant:  MUST TRY!!  Divine, heavenly perfection!  Do not leave Thorough Bread & Pastry without trying one or taking one home with you.  I ate one there and took two to go, which were eaten 2 days later and they were as delicious.  By far, the most amazing Almond Croissant I've ever tried!!  \n\nChocolate Bread:  Never had anything like it before, and I wish I bought more than one because it was just delicious. Crispy crust on the outside, soft bread with chunks of chocolate on the inside - just mouthwatering.  Mmmmmm.\n\nSourdough Bread Braid:  Good sourdough bread. Was super hard to eat the next day though.\n\nBread Pudding: with Mozzarella cheese, Sausage and Roasted Red Peppers - Savory, fluffy and the boyfriend loved it!\n\nSuper friendly cashiers!  Took the time to make recommendations and have patience with me as it was my first time there, and smiled the whole way through!  \n\nCan't wait to go back to San Francisco just to stop by Thorough Bread & Pastry..... so sad there's no bakery like this in LA.", "author": "Kat M."}

The drip coffee was incredible- the perfect balance of strong aroma and supreme taste. The almond croissant ($2.50) is the best dessert any dollar can buy. The other pastries we had were the apple gallette ($2.15), perfect flavor, very fresh tasting and not dripping with sugar or too sweet (apples are so sweet to begin with!). And the choquettes (4/$1.50) were delicious as well very fresh and sweet. Highly recommend. Only tried a few things this first visit but the pastry presentation definitely makes me yearn for more. Outdoor options as well- in front of cafe and back patio rare to find in the city in this area.

Why aren't there bakery cafes like this in Manhattan?  Almost makes me want to move back to SF.  Three features that really make this bakery a standout; I didn't give it a five star as I have not visited it 30 times or more (statistical sampling).\n\n1.  I love their almond croissants - easily as tasty as the ones from Boulange (Polk, Pine, Hayes, etc.) and Tartines. And dependable as I've had ones from the other bakeries that were burnt around the edges.  I could go on about the croissant's flaky, crispy layers of dough and just sweet enough almond paste filling.  I've taken them back to NY with me, and they keep well.  Just stick them in the toaster oven for a while and they crisp up nicely.  \n\n2.  The blueberry scones really set them apart from other bakeries. They are tender and bursting with an insane amount of plump, still juicy blueberries.  At times, the scones look like a clump of berries stuck together with a bit of dough. Easily the best in SF.\n\n3.  The patio is welcoming.  Serene.  My former fave patio was at Arlequin on Hayes until they expanded/landscaped the patio and it became the haunt of the bridge/tunnel pre-Symphony crowd.  Now they give you the vibe to leave the moment you've finished your cup of coffee.  If I want attitude, I'll stay in NY.", "author": "Jeff H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-15", "description": "Hands down best bakery, and one of the top cafes, in the City. Hopefully, no one else finds out- but they deserve the credit. Best bakery- yes, much better than Tartine, because they aren't full of themselves, despite being super legit (they bake their bread in the oven behind the counter... and speak French which isn't a pretentious thing- the main lady running the show is French), and don't hire out same hair-colored women who look like model robots to serve you your bread/pastries. Everyone has always been extremely friendly there, every time I have gone in. They have the BEST baguette in the City, and it costs $1.50! Far better than Acme or Tartine, too. I will admit I like Firebrand's whole wheat breads more (because I like WW), but they are not in SF (in Oakland, but sold in SF, thankfully), and when it comes to French Baguettes Thorough still wins. Also, they have delicious challah (but get it before 1pm! and also after like 8am, on Fridays). Their pastries are fantastic, and you can watch them being prepped in front of you. My boyfriend says that Tartine's are better depending on the pastry, but that it's more or less the same (but minus the line, attitude, and lack of seating like at Tartine). Coffee is delicious as well, nice selection of teas, they also have wonderful sandwiches and soups. The bowl of soup (today was tomato&celery w/cumin, mmm) was so hot and fresh, and came with a sliced up baguette, all for less than $5. The back patio is also a huge plus, along with the wonderful customers who frequent the place- not the pretentious hipster crowd, but the normal people crowd- old and young, sewing clubs and cute couples and people practicing their Spanish over coffee and pastries. They are also very accommodating to cyclists, as I often bike here on my way home from a ride and leave my bike in the entrance while quickly grabbing bread for lunch. I've also spent hours in the back patio and brought my bike back there with me (I asked first and they were fine with it). I can imagine how they wouldn't want more than 6 bikes back there though, the space isn't really for that.

They're different than any others in SF and I have tasted them in all bakeries in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-05", "description": "Thorough Bread and Pastry is conveniently located on Church not too far away from Market Street on the J-line. A very charming bakery indeed, there is even a small courtyard where you can sit and enjoy your pastries weather permitting. I came here on a Thursday evening nearing closing time. Bakers were busy rolling out dough behind the counter. I came here initially to try the baguette, at the suggestion of Nathalie L, so I asked if I could have a sample before I made my purchase. They were kind enough to slice me a piece of their crusty baguette, and I must admit it is quite good, definitely on par with acme rustics. Of course I couldn't leave just buying one baguette, so I decided on a lemon blackberry mousse tart which looked too beautiful to eat- yet somehow I managed to eat it anyway. The mousse was intensely lemon flavored, light and fluffy and the blackberry filling added a nice contrast. The thin layers of sponge cake sandwiching the mousse and blackberry gel was as airy as angel food cake (but not nearly as sweet). I will definitely be back to Thorough Bread for their baguettes (in the event that I cannot make it out to Berkeley for those from La Farine) and definitely to sample more of their magnificent pastries.", "author": "Kate A."}

The vegetarian sandwich was excellent, on really fresh focaccia. But the cookie was the best part.  Seriously, it was a damn good cookie.", "author": "Hill J."}

It was beautiful, with little maple-leaf pie-crust embellishments, and the pie itself was delicious.  And seriously, when I say I love pies, I mean I have pumpkin pie in July and March.  So I know my pumpkin pies!  Plus, they donated recently to a charity I support.  So great!", "author": "sara m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "The pastries are amazing and the employees were fun and upbeat and it was my everyday favorite until I began to notice changes in the employees and management. It seems like the employees aren't as upbeat and nice as they use to be. I stopped going and changed my everyday cafe. The atmosphere is dull and not of San Francisco. I miss the old Thorough Bread!!! GO if it's just for the pastries but if you're looking for a nice relaxing fun environment I wouldn't recommend it.", "author": "Peter S."}

Vegetable sandwich is good, caramel napoleon is great and I found chocolate bread is excellent today. They can do a little better job on interior, but it is not pretentious and the staff are friendly. They had an amazing bread-christmas tree last holiday. It is a bit pricey for a bakery, but a great place!", "author": "Charlie S."}

God, how I love the ham and cheese sandwich (just like in France), and the panetonni (better than the ones I've tried in Italy) which my whole family love. Brought home a couple of those for Christmas and they were a total hit! Another plus: the people behind the counter are polite and attentive.", "author": "Lee P."}
