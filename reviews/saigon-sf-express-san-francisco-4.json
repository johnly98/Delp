If they were dirt cheap then I'd overlook the quality, but some are upwards of $8 after tax.  They could probably make these better with a little more attention to spices and condiments.\n\nMeatball Sandwich: First thing I noticed was that there was no daikon, despite being prominently advertised on the menu.  Hence the sandwich lacked a very important pickled/bitter contrast that carrots alone could not salvage.  Also, I didn't noticed any mayo (which usually seems to be common on Vietnamese sandwiches), so it was a tad dry.  The meatballs were pretty mushy and lacked texture.\n\nSuper Combination Sandwich: No daikon or mayo here either.  I liked the \"fancy pork\" but wasn't feeling the chicken or regular pork.  They seemed kinda bland.", "author": "Adam B."}

That place is operated by two ladies, black belt masters of the baguette and the p\u00e2t\u00e9. This one doesn't have their expertise on the prep board, and you can tell because the sandwich is just not as good. Among their nearly dozen selections (photo: http://bit.ly/10TJD9s), I decided to try the $5.75 Super Combination Banh Mi, which had all the requisite ingredients - chicken, pork two ways, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, cucumber, and jalapeno (photo: http://bit.ly/10TJx1J) - but it was hamstrung by the paucity of meat and the hardness of the roll which became a jaw-unhinging exercise in futility.\n\nThe $5 pair of Spring Rolls are adequate, no more, considering they're prepackaged. I noticed they use iceberg lettuce and an excessive amount of vermicelli under the rice paper (photo: http://bit.ly/11MzVIA). What saved my experience from being a complete miss was the $2.50 Green Vietnamese Coconut Waffle, which takes a Belgian waffle concept but puts the freshness inside the batter (photo: http://bit.ly/13HSVJF). Although the color is greenish, the flavor and texture are enticing with a coconut tinge that allows for a lunchtime sweet treat without a lot of sweetness. Since the nearby Les Croissants makes a more satisfying banh mi, the waffle would be the only valid reason for me to return.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...marginal banh mi, satisfying waffle\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...not much to it and then you sit amid the confused tourists in Embarcadero Center\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast...that's about it\nTOTAL - 3 stars...saved by a green waffle", "author": "Ed U."}

I am not a complete picky veggie cuz I didnt want to start thinking about it. He made it pretty quick. The bread sits in this glass case and he warms a couple each time. I got a sandwich and a coconut water... all for about $6.

The meat, really good, great flavor, teh vermacelli on the other hand is dry, like day old noodles, that I don't like. This would be amazing if it was acutally warm. I will come back though an try their waffels, they smelt SOOO GOOD, I should of went with my gut and had a waffel, boo to me for trying to be concious of what I have for lunch. for now, I'll leave it at 3 stars, I'll bump it up after I try it.\n\nThe service was pleasant, a huge plus! especially in the Fidi!", "author": "S A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "Among the other food joints in the financial district, Saigon Deli Express is one of the few places I can go on any given day. 99% of the time I'll get the Super Combo sandwich and I'm never disappointed (though the coconut waffle is also delicious for those who aren't too timid to try a green waffle). The service is fast and friendly, I've arrived where the line was well out the door and still was able to order within a minute or two. You know the mark of a good restaurant when they runs out of food at the end of the late lunch hour because they get so many customers, so don't try to sneak in there at 2p. Also, the sandwiches are smaller than the average breed, but they're cheaper too, so if you're not someone that needs to gorge themselves with a burger, this is definitely up your alley.", "author": "Anthony C."}

The sandwich was a bit small and I was definitely hungry after. I should have probably grabbed a bag of shrimp chips along with my meal. \n\nI also ordered the Thai iced coffee. It had more cream than I usually like, but was still strong enough to do the job. \n\nIf I happen to be in the area and craving a banh mi, I'll stop by. Otherwise, I won't be going out of my way to go here.", "author": "Michael J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-18", "description": "I go to this place all the time.  I love their grilled pork sandwich, not to mention the meatball and the chicken sandwiches.  The green coconut waffles, made fresh while you wait, are to die for.  I really don't understand how people say that the Les Croissants place across the way is better.  This place has fresher ingredients, more flavorful, and their sandwiches are actually cheaper.\n\nBottom line, this place is great.  The service is top notch, the sandwiches generous in the amount of meat you get,  they taste really really good, and the prices are the best you can get around here.  My only problem with the place, is that I'm afraid I'll burn out on it by frequenting it too, well, too freqently.", "author": "FSK F."}

What I get consistently annoyed at though is that they always seem to sneak in huge slabs of straight-up rubbery fat in the pork sandwiches. It's a small sandwich, so it's not like there are huge mounds of meat in there. So you can understand why I get peeved with the inedible fillers. Or am I just wrong and I'm supposed to eat that part?

I was lured by my curiosity of green coconut waffles and my love of Vietnamese sandwiches. \n\nFirst time I tried my luck at the coconut waffle. As I step up the counter, I see that they're making a fresh batch so I ask for two. The cook stuffs a couple of the ones that have been sitting around instead of giving me the fresh ones. He says that these are ready to eat.  I figure I should trust the cook's recommendation and walk off with my waffles. I find that they're both room temp and one is crispy while the other is flaccid. To top it all off, the they were  bland. \n\nToday I get a hankering for a Vietnamese chicken sandwich and decide to give these guys a second chance. As I get back to my desk, I uncover my sandwich to find that it's just chicken with pickled carrots. Where's the cilantro? What about the cucumber you advertised? It may have been better had you remembered to put that on. \n\nIf it wasn't for their sloppiness I may have gone back for another.", "author": "Erick V."}

Where they really fall down in my opinion is the pickled vegetables. To me pickles are the essence of a good bahn mi,  my sandwiches contained almost no daikon and the carrots were 'gasp' grated!  You simply don't get the same crisp satisfying crunch you get from julienned carrots.\n\nFor the time being I think the sandwiches at Les Croissants are tastier.", "author": "Ian C."}

Even though there were about 5 customers behind me in line, I was the last person to receive my order.  They had to keep remaking the sandwiches because they couldn't get the order right. When my lunch buddy and I finally received the order, we both found 2 sandwiches we didn't order.  My lunch buddy ended up taking hers back, while I decided to skip the hassle and start eating. Then to my surprise, there was one entire slice of fat in my sandwich. Gross! Never coming back.", "author": "Sam L."}

On our way back from Osha we stumbled upon this spot. The first thing to entice me was the coconut jello screaming my name from the refrigerator. But then I see them pouring something into  what looks like a waffle maker, I'm like what the heck is that. Sure enough after close inspection of the menu I see something fascinating called a Coconut Waffle!!! Oh heavens, I just had to try it. Delicious, yep its got a blueish green color to it but delish, the husband and I shared it on the way back to the office. I will be back cause I love me some Vietnamese sandwiches and I must try the coconut jello too!\nP.S. I made a return trip and went with the vermicelli/waffle deal all for the small price of $6.50!

When my friend mentioned this new place I got to try it as my office is nearby.  \nBoy was I disappointed.  I ordered the combination (#1 on the menu).  First of all, the taste is way off compare to a regular vietnamese shop.  From what I can tell, instead of thinly sliced pickled carrots, it has shredded carrots which lost its crunch.  Not sure if it even comes with daikon or just cucumbers.  it is totally dry without any of mayonniase like spread that you normally expected in this sandwich. \n\nWould not go back again.", "author": "wyman y."}

They have enough shrimp to make me one about 20-25% of the time.  People, don't put something on your menu if you consistently cannot serve it.  I put up with that because it's not far from my office and the sandwich is good, but today was the final straw for me.  For once they had enough shrimp, so I bought a shrimp sandwich (which, by the way, is over $7, and is not very large), then while I was waiting decided I wanted a coconut waffle too.  The cashier refused to sell me one because I didn't have any cash and they have a \"$5 minimum\" for credit card purchases.  Never mind that I JUST SPENT $7.50 ON A DAMNED SANDWICH.  Um, and that minimum purchases violate your credit card company agreement.  I'm giving this place two stars because the sandwich and waffle are genuinely quite good by FiDi lunch standards, but I'm not coming back here anymore.", "author": "Sarah B."}
