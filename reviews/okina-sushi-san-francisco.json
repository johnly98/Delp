Very reminiscent of Japan.\n\nAs others have noted they generally only sell what is fresh so not everything is available all the time. Take your cue from the Chef. The night we were there the hamachi was unworldly. \n\nYou should call ahead for reservations even on the same day. They will work hard to fit you in. We found earlier dining is better, really no surprise. Also, note the place is cash only.\n\nMinus 1 point for technical reasons.

The sushi bar was full and the only other two tables had reserved signs on them. Luckily, they still accommodated us without a wait by seating us at the smaller table.\n\nWe ordered two sets of omakase. It was fresh and tasted delicious. The rice was seasoned so well and complemented the sashimi. Our favorite was the amberjack and hamachi. I'm not the biggest fan of hamachi, but this melted in my mouth and was so memorable.\n\nI'm honestly surprised that this place doesn't have a huge line out the door. There's only one sushi chef and waitress but the service was still above and beyond. It felt like I was in a Mom and pop sushi shop in an hidden alleyway at Japan.\n\nAlso, the price surprised the hell out of me. Our two sets of omakase and tekka maki only came out to $45.

Let's start by saying I've been here a couple of times in the past which this place has never disappoint. It's a very small place  that has about 15 seatings. It's always pack per reservations but the owners always try to accommodate as much as they can especially for walk in customers. They only open 3 times a week (thurs-sat). Even though they open at 5:30pm you can still call at 2p-3pm for day of reservations or future reservations. Mom and pop store. Chef reminds me of Jiro (documentary movie of the top sushi chef located in Japan). \n\nSushi is very good and fresh. He picks up fresh fish of the day so fish options are very very limited. The price is very reasonable/affordable. The only flaw is the fish options are very very limited- yes I know I just said lol. They don't make other stuff like udon, donburi, etc. They mostly serve sushi, sashimi and small selections of rolls. If your ok with limited good sushi at a good price than this place is for you. Not: best to make reservations. \n\nOverall... I still love this place and will be coming back. 4 star.", "author": "Christy V."}

Okina wins by a long shot. This place is truly deserving of 5 stars.  \n\nThey serve very fresh fish, almost all of it in the form of nigiris. Very simple, traditional, nothing fancy. If you're looking for crazy sushi rolls (aka not-authentic-Japanese food), you best look elsewhere. Food is served to you authentic Japanese sushi bar style - meaning, if you sit at the bar (which you should), the chef serves the nigiris to you right on the counter. \n\nThere are Japanese sushi restaurants that are comparable in taste (off the top of my head, Akikko's, Sushi Ran, Omakase, Wako, Kusakabe...), and they're fancier both in terms of atmosphere and preparation, but at those places, you'll only be getting something marginally more exotic for double to quadruple the price. Not at all worth it, in my opinion. \n\nThe prices at Okina are unbeatable. Omakase is roughly only $25. Nigiris are around $4-5 per set. You won't find prices like this with the utmost freshness anywhere in SF. Okina is a steal. \n\nAtmosphere is great too. It's very quite, small, and intimate. \n\nThis place is by all means, reservations only. You can call the same day, but it's almost impossible to do a walk-in.

We sat at the sushi bar and started with omakase but ended up probably trying everything on the menu and somehow our bill was still really low. It's no frills sushi here, no fancy rolls- which as a girl who religiously goes for nigiri/sashimi at sushi places, this was heaven for me. As per usual, my favorite fish reigned to be yellowtail and ended up in me ordering yellowtail probably 3-4 times. \n\nFour stars for me because of the service. The couple who run this restaurant are extremely nice and attentive. My friend and I were on a steady stream of constantly ordering that was only possible because of them. At any other sushi bar, I don't think we would have been as well taken care of.

It's a very small restaurant so reservations are must.\n\nSushi is overall just ok, not amazing. Cuts were on the smaller side. Rolls are pretty good deal though. A personal preference, they don't have plain salmon sashimi, only smoked salmon. They also started running out of sashimi towards the end of the night, which may be why we only had 5 per person? I am not quite sure how the bill added up, but the lady did mention she took off the cost of some of the sushi...\n\nService is excellent.

The omakase menu is affordable as is the a la carte menu. Everything is made right before your eyes in a very clean, small, cozy venue with limited seating without feeling like sardines in a can. \n\nThat's not even the best part. Chef has been doing what he does best for 30 years. He is nowhere near a jaded or grumpy 'ol grandpa. He is delightfully sweet and hilarious. He prepares each bite with ease while interacting and socializing away like there is nothing he would rather be doing. \n\nI asked chef where he got his fish. He told us about how his fish comes from different places... Spain, Philippines, Alaska, and he always knows how old the fish is when serving it. Before we knew it, we were immersed in his tales about how he started his business, what his upbringing was like, and what his sons do for a living. You almost feel like you were invited for a traditional sushi dinner in his living room and forget that you made a reservation in a place that seats about 10 people. \nThe waitress was just as sweet. To say the service she provided was attentive is an understatement. She radiates such a warm and mild-mannered personality. Before we knew it, the meal was already over.\n\nI'm not even clear how they totaled up our bill. We both went with the omakase, a couple of add-ons from the menu, and wine. Yet somehow the total was still about the cost of 2 omakase meals.\n\nMost of what we ate was nigiri. Each order comes in a pair. Everything was presented directly from the chef's hands. No plates, which is the traditional way. \n\nMaguro (Tuna) - sweet and clean to the bite. The fatty tuna almost melts in your mouth. \n\nHirame (Halibut) - smooth, subtle flavor,\n\nHamachi (Yellow Tail) - mildly sweet, meaty in texture\n\nKobashira (Scallop) - juicy scallop with scallions and tobiko wrapped tightly over rice\n\nAmaebi (Raw Prawn) - very sweet, tender, meaty shrimp\n\nTamago Nigiri - deliciously sweet egg omelette\n\nTuna Temaki - sweet, fresh tuna in mildly vinegary sushi rice & cucumber expertly wrapped in crunchy nori\n\nThe only minor thing I would say is the cuts were not all sharp or uniform-looking, but the flavor was amazing.\n\nDrink options are beer, wine, and sake. It was my mistake to choose white wine. It was weak and too sweet. It was only $2.50 a glass.\n\nIt's not too difficult to make a reservation, but definitely make a reservation and plan ahead. Okina is only open Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturday evenings. They only take reservations by phone no more than a couple of days in advance. Don't complain. It's a long-standing small business / sole proprietorship / mom & pop business, not corporate / restaurant chain / big box company, so don't expect it to be one. Definitely request the sushi bar!\n\nI usually get annoyed when a restaurant is cash-only, but for this awesome little joint, I'll walk a couple of blocks to Geary and withdraw some green.

What a gem in the Inner Richmond!\n\nThis place has excellent sushi for the price point. My boyfriend and I were shocked that several of the fish were imported from Japan! Lastly it was so cheap. We did the Omakase for two people...we also brought a bottle of wine (free corkage...!!!!!!), and without tip it came out to ~$85 total. Shocking. You aren't getting the super exotic fish here like barracuda etc., but he has all the standard fish like tuna, hamachi, mackerel, etc that taste superb. Some fish slices are thinly cut, but most are normal size nigiri. Also it was super easy to make a reservation! I think we made it the week of for a Saturday night. He was also personable and talked to us throughout the meal. The one sushi I remember vividly was his Uni. It came from Santa Barbara which is pretty typical, and can sometimes be a hit or miss depending on how fresh it is. He picked a super fresh one and it was quite mindblowing for Santa Barbara Uni!\n\nCons:\n-Cash only. There is an ATM in the market next door though!\n-No music in the restaurant. Kind of an awkward vibe. And the restaurant wasn't super packed either, so it has kind of a cold feel. Lighting wasn't very warm either since it's an older restaurant. \n-Fast meal in general. We were in and out within an hour. This probably isn't the place to bring your significant other for an anniversary dinner, but just a regular date night. Maybe even a weeknight if you're on the run. \n\nAnyway this is a SOLID sushi joint that I'm sad I didn't find earlier. COMING BACK HERE!!!!!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

A tiny restaurant with row of 6 seats by the sushi bar and a couple of tables. Bf and I both got the omakase, chef's choice, which consisted of 7 pieces. The fish varies each day, we ended having smoked salmon, tuna, squid, cooked crab...and a few other things. They were all good! Someone sitting by the bar asked him what his favorite fish of the selected selection he had, he said mackerel, so we got mackerel. That mackerel, soooooo good, sooooo glad we got it. We also ended ordering tamago nigiri and unagi nigiri. The unagi is heated up in the tiniest toaster oven, so fatty, buttery goodness. The tamago was just okay...Tani's Kitchen makes better tamago. For the amount of food we got, I thought it would have been around $80-100, it only ended costed us $55 with tax and tip, SOOOOO CHEAPPP!!!! I swear Kiki's costs more than this and that's the least authentic...I highly recommend making reservations! Only downside is that it's cash only and parking isn't the best.", "author": "Kylie L."}

Yes, he puts the sushi ON TO THE BAR, not on a little plate placed in front of you. \nGo with omakase and let Akio san do his magic. He does not drink while working, so please respect his wishes. Although he is 70 something odd years old (hence why Okina is only open 3 days a week. He's an old man okay, be nice), he still makes sushi deftly. \n\nExcellent quality fish although I must note that I especially enjoyed the ikura. He marinates the roe himself with a little sake. Ikura was not overly salty like many as Nobu K would say \"jive ass\" sushi spots. \n\nWhen dining here, eat the sushi the legitimate way - right off the sushi bar, with your bare hands, no soy sauce. \n\nBRING THE GREENS BECAUSE THIS IS CA$H ONLY! still, very cheap and affordable.", "author": "Susy C."}

The saba here is especially good, and I normally don't even enjoy saba nigiri.\n\nWhile i respect that he has his way, there are some downsides:\n  - It's cash only.\n  - Salmon is smoked.

If you crave California style fusion rolls laden with avocado, spicy mayonnaise, chicken, etc. do not waste your time coming here, this is purist sushi. \n\nThe spartan menu consists simply of nigiri, sashimi, and beer. Sashimi is priced the same as nigiri, which is fairly unheard of. Once you go you will realize this is because he uses the same sized sashimi cuts for both the sashimi and the nigiri. What fish is available will vary each time you come, as allegedly he only opens the restaurant with the freshest fish of the day. \n\nImportant to note, if you cannot make and keep a reservation do not come here. Walk-in dining is virtually unheard of and somewhat frowned upon at this tiny 12 person seating restaurant. They take reservations same day if you call the hour they open and it is possible to book a day or two in advance which is HIGHLY advisable as they book up for the entire weekend fast! \n\nThe bottom line: best raw authentic sushi, hours and reservations take some attention to detail to successfully execute, overall completely worthwhile, real hole in the wall, bring a date or a friend not a group.", "author": "Tomas K."}

Personally, sushi is about enjoying fresh seafood and fish in its most unadulterated form and this IS what you'll find at Okina! \n\nR E S E R V A T I O N S:\nA MUST! Okina is a small restaurant with several tables and sushi bar seating. \n\nOn Saturday, 11/20/10, my friend and I came to Okina at 8:30 PM. We had reservations at 8 PM, but thanks to the lovely hail and thunder we were running late. I called Okina to let them know and they said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nNOTE: Okina is ONLY open Thursday, Friday and Saturday for Dinner (5 PM - 10 PM). \n\nM E N U (CASH ONLY):\nOkina has a very small and limited menu:\n\n*Nigiri Combo Plate: ($11.50-$14)\n\n*Chirashi ($11.50): Assorted fish on a bed of rice\n\n*6 Maki Rolls ($3.30 - $3.60): \nCA (crab and avocado), NY (prawn and avocado), Alaska (salmon and avocado), Hamachi (yellowtail), Tekka (tuna) and Salmon Skin roll. \n\n*16 Nigiri/Sashimi ($2.30 - $4): \nTamago (egg), Saba (mackerel), Smoked salmon, Ebi (prawn), Hirame (halibut), Hamachi (yellowtail), Kani (real crab), Ikura (salmon roe), Tobiko (fish roe), Unagi (eel), Uni (sea urchin), Ika (squid), Maguro (tuna), Amaebi (raw prawn), Kaki (oyster), and Kobashira (scallop). \n\nYou can add a quail egg for $.30. \n\n*Drinks:\nBeer and one kind of sake (room temperature).\n\nF O O D:\n*MAKI ROLLS: CA, NY, Alaska and Hamachi\n\nAll of the maki's were SIMPLE yet GOOD! The FRESH crab, prawn, salmon, hamachi, and buttery avocado were tightly bundled up with soft, yet slightly al-dente sticky rice that had mild sweet tartness complementing the natural sweetness of the seafood and fish.\n\nNOTE: Okina's maki rolls are small and compact. They're about 50% smaller than the typical monstrous rolls you will find at other restaurants, \n\n*NIGIRI: Amaebi and Uni w/ Quail Egg\n\nBoth were AMAZING!!!\n\nAs if the Amaebi was caught from the Northern waters of the Pacific Ocean that morning, it was amazingly fresh with a sweet and clean finish. \n\nThe Uni was by far the BEST I've ever had! It tasted like a soft, creamy, sweet custard with a delicate brininess like a fresh ocean breeze that melts on your palette. The quail egg added a velvety layer bringing decadence to a whole new level!\n\n*SASHIMI: Hamachi and Maguro\n\nBoth the Hamachi and Maguro were perfectly cut at an angle and across the grain exposing a large surface area which highlighted the fresh and buttery flavor of the fish.\n\nS E RV I C E:\nTrue Japanese Hospitality!\n\nUpon entering Okina, we were warmly welcomed by Chef/owner Akio-San and the waitress. The waitress promptly took our order which was brought out within minutes. She was attentive without being overbearing and always made sure our teacups were filled.\n\nAfter finishing our meal, Akio-San graciously thanked us for coming and saw us off. He is so genuinely sweet and friendly that you can't help but love the guy.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nDIFFICULT! Okina is located in a very residential area of Inner Richmond, so expect to spend a good amount of time circling around. I highly suggest taking Muni and/or a cab instead.  \n\nWhen it comes down to authenticity and high-quality ingredients at affordable prices, Okina definitely fits the bill to a \"T\". \n\nI finally found my FAVORITE sushi joint in SF!

Moving like a machine and every time he placed something in front of me he would say \"hai, arigato ogozaimasu, thank you sir\".  Later on he got to know me a little and was smiling and laughing.

That way you don't have to show up extra early.\n\n3) On their door it says their hours are Thu, Fri, and Sat from 5PM - 9PM, CLOSED ON SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, AND WEDNESDAY.\n\nOverall Okina is a good, simple old fashioned sushi bar, no large sake lists, small fish selection, and as I mentioned before VERY CHEAP AND GOOD, and I LOVE IT!", "author": "Rudi A."}

We spent as much as we would've spent at say Isobune, but with 10x more fresh sushi, and wayy better experience.\n\nNext time we're craving sush -- real sushi -- we will definitely be coming back to Okina :)", "author": "Gina R."}

Other than that there's only two or three tables in the whole damn place. And it is almost as quiet as a church inside. I actually felt a little embarassed because I came with my polite though sometimes rowdy usual crowd of friends and I knew I wouldn't be able to stop the \"that's what she said\" jokes from shooting across the table. Luckily I don't think the itamae is terribly great at contemporary English mannerisms and he didn't really catch on -- or he didn't care.\n\nHot tea was great, sake was solid but basically just OK, that's not what you come here for. Of course, you come for the sushi.\n\n5 of us all ordered Chef's Omakase, 9 pieces or so and the price was very reasonable, $25 a head. Each piece was divine. We then ordered some more sushi combos to sate the rest of our hunger (and my hungrier friend got a chirashi box for herself -- she said it was good.) After a couple rounds of sake and some beer it was still only about $35-40 a person after tax and tip. Pretty amazing especially considering the great experience we had.\n\nI'll be returning regularly to my new sushi shrine.", "author": "Josh K."}

The rice was a little looser and colder than I would've liked and the fish was good.. enough.  Well, it wasn't rancid.  Out of the 11 things we had -- amberjack, tuna, smoked salmon, ami ebi, uni, ikura, squid, 2 types of mackeral and i forget the rest - none were really tasty except for the amberjack which was paired with a shiso leaf.  I'm a sucker for anything with shiso.\n\nI liked the prices.  We got out of there for less than $60 and that included a large Asahi split between us.\n\nI really like the sushi chef; he's much more amicable, friendly and KID-friendly than either Ino or Hama-ko (who is notoriously kid UNfriendly).  However, I would still rate Ino and Hama-Ko as the top traditional sushi restaurants that I've tried in SF.   Maybe stick Yu Zen in there as a definite 3rd.\n\nUnfortunately, I would probably even go to Zushi Puzzle, Kiss, Sushi Zone or Koo (yes, I'm know I'm mixing up my sub-genres here) before I come back to Okina as my experience, while pleasant enough, did not meet my expectations for good rice, flavorful and fresh fish or at least something to excite my taste buds.", "author": "Brian T."}

But I owe my fellow Yelpers, so I'll admit it - this is the best sushi bar in the country.\n\nThat doesn't come lightly.  I've been to Japan several times and have been to the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo at 5am for fresh sushi; and as I write, I'm on a plane coming from from NYC where I've been to many of the top sushi restaurants.  Okina blows them all away.\n\nI don't even know where to begin, so this is a random list.\n\nPositives:\n-- The sushi chef.  While his English is broken, he's a pleasure to chat with.  He shared that he's been in the business for over 30 years and doesn't do it for the money.  In fact, we tried to convince him to raise prices and expand, and he just smiled.  He does it for the love of the art.\n-- The sushi.  Fish is flown in daily or weekly from Japan.  We asked why not use local fish, and he just smiled.  He said he knows exactly where he wants his fish from, and does not deviate. Because of this, they are only open 3 nights a week for only a few hours each night\n-- The atmosphere.  Very cozy and intimate, feels quite authentic.\n-- The staff.  Errr, the one server.  She is very friendly and has also been working there for years.\n-- The soy sauce.  I hesitate to share, as the chef was pleased to tell us the secret, but even the soy sauce is custom made by the chef.  He finds most soy sauce too salty and overpowering.  His version is delicious.\n-- Price.  I feel guilty paying what we pay.  I always let the chef choose (Omakase) and it never comes out to more than $40/each, and you can easily fill up for $20.  The Sake is very cheap, I don't remember how much, but it was less than $10 for a bottle, I believe.  It's just stunning.  In NYC this experience would cost easily $150 (in fact, the place I was just at was $120 for the Omakase and drinks were $16 each).  Such an amazing deal!!\n \nNegatives:\n-- Parking can be tough to find.  The best bet is not to try finding it on the little streets (everything you think is a spot is either a cross walk or driveway) and go straight for Fulton St.\n-- Hard to get reservations.  It's small, so plan in advance.  Not good for large groups, unfortunately, max is 4 people.", "author": "Greg B."}

Instead, Okina is a sushi house.\n\nCharm does not come from vibrant music or attractive female waitresses  \n\"May I help you gentleman\" ...\n\nInstead, the vibe is a sanctuary.  With a full bar and attentive ears, easily I can over hear conversation.  \n\nStarting the show, greetings from the master chef.  With chiseled face, bald head, he resembled a samurai.  \n\nstarting off with saba, a vinegar cured fish with a strong fish taste \nThe chef offered three kinds ranging from salty, well.. .to more salty. \nThe three versions reminded me of an ascending salty note on a piano.\n\nServed directing on the sushi board, the nigiri pieces displayed the incredible knife skills.

The slice was thin and lacked character.  Stealing the show, the hamachi (yellowtail) is worth another order.  Just one bite, the buttery fish reminds me why raw fish is worth eating.\n\nAll the while I consume fresh fish, the chef tells stories.  Reminding me of my grandfather, he told stores about World War II.  \n\nNot knowing that Japanese history channel was on the menu, I enjoyed his stories.  Somehow, this adds charm.  In a culinary world where most meals lack connection to the owner, the experience was refreshing.\n\nAside from being the sushi chef, he played the role of story teller and comedian.  Sure, I did not get all his jokes, but who is complaining when my palate was being stimulated constantly.\n\nFinish the meal with Kani (crab roll).  For a buttery and sweet combination, the unagi (eel) does the trick.  \n\nFor a taste of a classic sushi house, Okina hits the spot.  For an authentic Japanese spot that adds a more hip hop charm, Hime is a great choice.\n\nNote: I attached a photo of the menu for pricies\nEnjoy Yelpers", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Menu is very simple with the typical rolls and nigiris. I went for the omakase where the chef chooses what you have. From sea urchin to toro, all the sushi tasted very fresh and high quality. It almost feels as if you are eating at a sushi restaurant in a village in Japan. Prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi restaurants in SF.

They won't take you if its 30 minutes to closing because they don't want you to keep them late, even though on average we are done in 20 minutes (I told her this), then they try to say it's because they are almost out of fish.

One day on my way home I stopped in to get to go and was scolded then felt so uncomfortable that I have made my visits less and less.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-24", "description": "To preface: I live right around the corner from this place and Arguello supermarket.  The building is owned by the chef himself and is only open on weekends.  He is very Japanese.  I really like sushi.  All kinds.\n\nAfter coming here several times over the past few years, despite genuinely wanting to like the place and food, I have come to the conclusion that I am not a fan.\n\nThe sushi bar is setup where Chef-san places your order directly onto the wooden bar along with the pickles allows lots of interaction and Chef-san can be engaging, he likes to say thank you... at the very least he has a funny accent.  But, when I go somewhere to eat the primary focus is on the food.  All else is secondary.  The food here is not very good.\n\nHe says he gets his fish fresh from Japan, don't really know the purveyor he gets his stuff from, but I'd rather eat fresh local fish than mediocre Japanese fish.  The aji on more than one occasion was a little on the unpleasantly fishy side.  Especially with an oily type of fish it is very apparent when its not fresh.  Instead of fresh salmon, he was serving smoked salmon that was lean, grainy and probably colored due to its unnatural pink hue.  The best thing I had there last time were the scallops, everything else was uniformly meh.\n\nAll the fish sits stacked pre-portioned in the case.  When it got portioned is up for debate.  I understand that it's pretty much a one man show, but when there so few customers sitting at once I'm sure cutting fish to order isn't so hard.  Plus, it adds to the experience as opposed to grab and go sushi.  It could be that he's old and can't move as fast or maybe it's just apathy, either way it doesn't make for good eats.\n\nNot meaning to knock on the other reviewers, but really?  Five stars, four stars?  I understand that there aren't many places in the city as quaint as Okina, but that itself doesn't warrant a higher rating.  Quality sushi and fish comes at a premium and maybe Chef-san is going for the middle road but in my opinion it probably be more fun and cheaper to go to a sushi boat place instead of Okina because at least you get what you pay for.", "author": "Lon H."}

Since there was only two other patrons there, I felt kinda bad making a noisy entrance with our relatively large group shuffling our bags and belongings--it seemed like the rule was to keep noise to a minimum though we find out differently later.  \n\nIt's REAL AUTHENTIC sushi with no frills, fancy designs, or any thing cooked (other than rice and tamago) for that matter.  Everything here is straight up fresh and raw.  The rice is different from your usual sushi place but it's best eaten without soy sauce. I loveeeed their scallop.  The BF says they have one of the best and freshest Uni that he has ever tasted--actually he loved most of the fish that he ate here.

What you see in Okina's fish cooler is the new West Coast's, Aaron Copeland \"Rodeo\" soundtracked, ad campaign - \"FISH... it's what's for dinner.\" \nDid cowboys ever eat raw?\n\nThis place feels like the real deal, a little bit of Japan in the non-descript USF neighborhood of Lone Mountain. After entering Okina and cheerful irasshaimase's faded we were asked if we had reservations. I was impressed to see a reserved sign at the bar. I think all restaurants should use this fear/guilt-inducing tactic because immediately I thought  \"damn, this place is so good I should've made a reservation. It must be a rare treat to sit at the bar.\"\n\nArtificial or legit guilt aside we were quickly seated at the few remaining places at the bar. I was a tad disappointed that no hot towels were dispensed but fresh, hot, green tea made up for it. No need for plates as the chef deftly dolluped an interesting assortment of cucumber, pickle, ginger, wasabi on the clean, lacquered, wooden counter. I was cool with eating off it, but only after talking down my inner germ freak, eyeing about hopefully for a bleachy wipe-down.\n\nThe chef was perky, oldish, calm, friendly and very bald. He quietly attended to us while saving his chatty-cathy side for his waitresses. This spry old fox prepared our sushi faster than I'd ever seen before. That's when I noticed something fishy in the immaculately arranged fish cooler, and it wasn't the halibut. Hey, wait a minute, it almost looked like everything was pre-sliced. He may have taken mis en place too far. I was a bit turned off that our Toro was more piecemeal than one big slice on top of its rice bed. This configuration sometimes led to the sushi coming apart before touching them with my chopsticks.\n\nSome things we enjoyed were the surprisingly good (whole pieces of) smoked salmon. It was very mild and tender not like lox. The hamachi was equally delicious (and whole) but I've had fresher and the temperature was too cold. The real crab and avocado california roll had a clean, fresh taste. The pieces were perfectly bite-sized and sported a seaweed exterior making it cuter than a sushi magnet. The unagi was fatty and tasty but could've used more time in the toaster oven cause I like my eel CRISPY. Its sauce was a bit unusual for me, less sweet carmelized soy sauce and more vinegary.\n\nSpeaking of vinegar, I noticed that the sushi rice was a bit peculiar and its vinegar more assertive than at other sushirias\u2122. I didn't mind it, but noticed sometimes it distracted rather than complemented the fish flavors.\n\nI like this place a lot. Okina's the epitome of Zen, simple, unassuming and very authentic, achieving its single purpose with aplomb. Just remember to bring some cash so you don't find yourself making making a mid-dinner dash to the ATM next door.", "author": "Brady K."}

I admit to not knowing everything about sushi but I can definitely judge the quality - er, at least my enjoyment - of sushi based on 3 things:\n\n- salmon nigiri\n- hamachi nigiri\n- sushi rice\n\nNone of these met my expectations. I'm an optimist too. I always have something good to say - but after my 1st visit to Okina (after a 20 min wait), all I could say was \"wow, not impressed.\" The rice tasted weird (too sweet) and the fish really had no flavor. Even the quail egg on tobiko wasn't as enjoyable as Tsunami's version...and I don't even love Tsunami.\n\nBased on reviews, I expected this place to be on par with Kazu - my favorite sushi spot in SF. I'm willing to go to a mediocre sushi spot if there's something else to entertain me - like good sake, ambiance etc - but this place is deathly quiet. The service was poor as well. The waiter told us that we'd have to wait 45 minutes at least. After 20 minutes, we were seated. Good thing we didn't believe him and didn't leave to try out Sushi Bistro.\n\nEnough complaining.

No offense against Koreans and Chinese who open Japanese restaurants (I am half Korean anyway), but for me personally I'm into the authenticity of Asian cuisine.  I mean, there are tons of people who like the \"Japanese-American\" style and that's why those types of restaurants are successful, and I like them at times, BUT I would choose a authentic Japanese restaurant any day. \n\nAnyway, back to Okina, although there isn't much of a variety, they have fish that is fresh.

It's a testament to how lucky I am to live in a country where food is plentiful. It's also a testament to the fact that most restaurants are run fairly well. Okina Sushi was a rare departure and left me badly disappointed.\n\nOkina is minimalist to a fault. A small place with virtually no decorations. The menu is extremely sparse. There's no edamame, miso soup, salad, tempura or anything else that you'd expect from a sushi restaurant. That OK, I thought to myself as I glanced over the menu, I'll just fill up on high quality fish. When our waiter came along to take my order he informed me that they had run out of hamachi. They were also out of prawns and unagi. I ordered some tuna and amberjack and a couple other pieces of nigiri. When I wanted to order more tuna our waiter apologized and informed me that they had just run out. At this point, there was almost nothing left for me to order so I paid the bill and left in disgust.\n\nI would be more understanding if I had arrived there at the last minute but I sat down for dinner at 7:30pm on a Saturday.

Thanks to Y, we were able to get quite chummy with the master chef and the waiter, and had a very large table reserved and waiting for us when we arrived (starving and ready to consume all fish in sight).\n\nSide note: Definitely make a reservation before going, as the restaurant itself is absolutely TINY (literally a hole in the wall), and will most likely be filled to capacity if you show up unannounced. They had to turn away several people last night while we dined, as reservations caused the few open seats to be unavailable. \n\nOn to the fish: Some of the freshest I've had in the while. I ordered chirashi for myself while my three dining companions shared an omakase. We also side-ordered extra saba, uni, and hotate (which sadly, I didn't get to try). The maguro, hamachi and saba were melt-in-my-mouth tender; the saba was particularly delicious. In that one bite of smooth, sweet, and salty fish, I imagined having the essence of the ocean in my mouth. The highlight of the night was definitely the UNI. I may be a little biased, as I am particularly fond of uni, but DAMN. That uni nigiri was seriously sex in my mouth. My tastebuds rejoiced with every bite as I closed my eyes to savor the sweet succulent flavor of the uni paired with the crisp, subtly salty nori and tangy sushi rice.

The place is similar to Ino Sushi in Japantown in that the chef is Japanese and if you're sitting at the bar, they put the ginger, wasabi, and sushi directly on the bar. The decor is very minimal. The ambiance is lacking as it is pretty quiet in there when the chef is not talking. The chef was nice and really talkative once you get him started. It was a bit difficult to understand everything he was said to us. Like everyone else has mentioned, he thanks you a lot.\n\nWe've never done omakase before but we decided to do it this time and boy were we happy we did it. We had 8 pairs of nigiri: jack, hamachi (yellowtail), hirame (halibut), maguro (tuna), saba (mackerel), hotate (scallops), amaebi (sweet shrimp), and oyster. We also ordered smoked salmon, unagi (eel), and toro (fatty tuna). The menu was very limited. We had probably tried about 3/4 of their nigiri menu. Most of the fish seemed fresh but they were pre-sliced, which wasn't too impressive. I don't usually go for hotate but it was really good. The hamachi and hirame were also good. Everything else didn't wow me. The amaebi was the least fresh of all. It was purple in color and it wasn't crunchy enough. The maguro and toro looked and tasted about the same to me except that the toro was a mushier version of the maguro. \n\nTotal for 2 people: ~$45. Cheaper than expected!\n\nDo make a reservation to ensure you get a seat. When my fiance and I were the only two people in the restaurant, another couple came in without reservations and they were turned away. It must have seemed really odd to them, being turned away when the restaurant was practically empty. We suspect that they limit the number of customers per day to ensure that there is still fish left by the end of Saturday. By the time we left, the restaurant was a bit busier.

At $75 for two for the awful sushi & sashimi today, I wholeheartedly disagree on the value.\n\nThings that went wrong at Okina tonight:\n\n1) Omakase sashimi: Toro - better to get it from Nijiya.  Aji - was the quality of this fish supposed to be served at sashimi level?  Other fish - not memorable at all.\n\n2) Nigiri - sushi rice needed more moisture.  Maguro was tasteless.  \n\n3) Condiments - radish (daikon) and cucumbers were obviously not shaved in skilled manner.\n\n4) Alcoholic drinks - poor selection.\n\nThe only good thing about this place was the sushi chef who was talking to you the entire time.

Presentation was a bit tacky with the plastic faux-lacquered thing going on but they keep their prices low which compensates.\n\nSome highlights:\nEngawa nigiri - Fluke fin\nEscolar\nUni - Santa Barbara\nAmaebi - sad times, they don't have a deep fryer for the heads. =(\n\nOverall a great experience.

So much so that even when I'm watching Finding Nemo (one of my all time favorite movies), I find I can't say no to sushi. Is it wrong that I don't even feel guilty???\n\nThis past Saturday night I was being a lazy bum and flipping thru the channels on tv when i came across Finding Nemo. Woohoo! About 10 mins into the movie, the hubby calls. \n\nHub: \"We're on the way home, you wanna have sushi?\"\nMe: \"Hell ya\". Click. Run to the bedroom to change. Realized I forgot to say bye to the hub before hanging up the phone.\n\nOur buddy Eric raved about Okina a few weeks back and wanted us to try it out. So this sat night we drove there. It's located in a random place. I don't think I would have ever noticed there was a sushi joint here.\n\nIt's a tiny place but right when you walk in, you feel like you're in Japan. Nothing flashy. Just a quaint, tiny ( i mean tiny!-very Japanese) place to get super fresh nigiri.  There isn't a lot on the menu, so like what other reviewers have said, if you want miso soup, tempura or teriyaki, you need to take your ass somewhere else.\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar, which i think if you come here is the best way to go.  We left it up to the sushi chef (I think also the owner, and get this...actually Japanese!) to create whatever he wanted for us.  All of the fish was amazingly fresh. The toro was so freaking awesome....it just melted in your mouth. The only thing I opted out of was the scallops (me and raw scallops do not like each other much- see review of Bar Crudo).  The chef was very nice and we all had a great time talking with him.  The prices were also very reasonable here too given that their fish is super fresh.\n\nThe only downside to Okina is that they only take cash. But prepared to come here with fist full of cash.\n\nWhen we got home, I caught the end of Finding Nemo. It just so happened to be the part where the fishermen are catching tuna. \n\nHmmm (slightly guilty feeling)\n...eh...\nthem tuna is probably going into the cans (guilty feeling gone).", "author": "Mary L."}

Bloody brilliant. \n\nA friend recommended this place to me, and it was literally such a tiny restaurant, that we walked by it twice before we realized it was there. We made reservations, also suggested by a friend since it has such limited seating, and I'm glad that we did. \n\nIt was great, bc the main dining area (not including the bar or small waiting area) was probably smaller than my living room. But I loved the intimate and family-like feel that this gave the place. There wasn't a large variety of drinks to choose from, but I feel that their limited choices really allows them to highlight their food and for the focus to be on the sushi itself. \n\nI got the deluxe sashimi plate, and although at first I was a little disappointed at the size, later it dawned on me that unlike many American restaurants, or sushi restaurants in the States, Okina doesn't want its diners to eat for quantity, but rather for quality.\n \nAhh. While I was a little embarrassed at first that my tendencies to stuff my face unabashedly have dumbed me down when it comes to recognizing quality food, I forgave myself and just enjoyed the experience. \n\nTo sum up, this is a definite must for people who actually love sushi, and by sushi, I mean raw fish. Not the rolls that have been fried or drowned in sauce/mayo, but the kind of sushi where they want people to enjoy the taste of the fish, not hide it. If you're that kind of sushi-lover, than this place will def be your cup o' tea.", "author": "Bel P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-30", "description": "First off, I need to thank you yelpers for saying that this place was reservation only otherwise I would have surely missed out.\n\nReservations only?-\nSo me being here on vacation from San Diego, I had time to kill after going to the academy of science before my flight. Whipped out my iphone/yelp app and found this small gem only accepted reservations. I called at 4:50 right before they opened, and got a reservation @ 5. Awesome that they accept reservations so short of notice. \n\nReview-\nUpon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by the sushi chef and was seated at the bar where we were immediately served complementary tea. Might I add, it was DAMN GOOD tea. The menu was quite small, offering only roughly 15 different types of nigri, and 10 sushi rolls. While small, they offered all the basic sushi selections. My mom and I ended up splitting a deluxe nigiri assortment, 4 orders of nigiri and 1 roll which surprisingly filled us up. I have to recommend the kanpachi (yellowtail); A butter-tasting fish that melts in your mouth. Service was FAST as well. As soon as we ordered something, the food was almost immediately in front of us; albeit there was only one other party of 2 in the restaurant at the time.  Best part of all... the bill came out to a little under $40! Very inexpensive. \n\nConclusion-If you're not a die-hard sushi lover and are looking for a selection of specialty rolls (i.e rainbow, crunchy rolls), you will be sorely disapointed. If you want to have a real authentic japanese sushi experience with excellent nigiri at a great price, this is your place. \n\nAfterthoughts: It also appears that this place is open only a few days a week (thurs, fri & sat?). On top of being reservation only, they must not make a lot of money leading me to a conclusion. They must be doing it because they love it...so awesome.", "author": "Michael S."}

Akio, the owner, chatted up my friend and I with sincere kindheartedness and humor.

From the start  to the end, you can concentrate on your sushi while enjoying a good mature time in the very elegance of Japanese atomosphere.

The owner/chef is a sweet old Japanese man who really loves his craft, seems to know his fish, and is very attentive to his customers.  The restaurant is a little hole in the wall in a residential area -- it's literally the size of your living room, with 3 tables and a sushi bar for 6.  They serve only sushi.  They have rarer selections like sardine.  The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 for an order of tuna nigiri).  Everything about it should make me love it.   \n\nBut I don't.\n\nI've come back twice now thinking \"maybe last time was a fluke\"....but it doesn't seem that way.  Why?  Well -- the sushi is just not right.  The rice has a texture of day-old refrigerated rice.  Kind of crusty and not homogenously sticky.  And the fish is cut paper-thin.  There's barely enough of it to catch a flavor of the fish...and then it's gone.  \n\nIt's really disappointing too -- this place has all the ingredients for greatness -- an attentive and creative chef, great fish, great unique selection -- yet they fail.", "author": "Eugene F."}

We sat there just staring at the tiny menu that didn't have a lot of items like we thought there would be.  We were about to order until the old man that's doing the sushi asked if we wanted the chef recommendations.  We just said \"ok\".  If you go there and the sushi chef ask you if you want the Chef Recommendation, say YES or ask for it.  \nEverything he put down was just amazing.  I only remember some of the names of the items he gave us, Toro, Uni, Halibut.  Right next to me there were 2 girls that were about to order their own items and then saw what we had, they hurried and changed their minds and had the chef recommendations also, that's how good it was.  One other guy that was leaving said one thing, \"sir, you are an artist\"!  I agree. \nSushi chef was a really nice guy, he chatted with the patrons and cracked jokes, you can see the work he was doing.  \nThis is one place you have to go to.

No special rolls, no cooked foods from the kitchen, ie. tempura and no more than 16 seats in the place, which somewhat resembled the downstairs of someone's home.  It's either rolls(no spicy tuna since they do not have hot sauce) or nigiri.  Great price for the value, toro nigiri for $6 and amaebi nigiri for $3, don't know where else to find these prices.  We wouldn't go to the Richmond just for this restaurant but if we were already in the area and felt like getting sushi, we'd dropped in.", "author": "bunnymouse k."}

The prices here are very reasonable for the quality that you get.  I was a little thrown off the first time I sat at the sushi bar and the chef placed my order directly on the wood display area instead of using plates.  The service is fast and friendly, especilly for a traditionl sushi place.  I always get my entire order within 10 minutes of ordering.  The only downside is that the place is only open 3 days a week and street parking is hard to find sometimes.", "author": "Janny J."}

The folks operating the restaurant are friendly, and even though we didn't have reservations they found us a table in this small venue (even though all other tables were empty for our entire dinner, save a couple of folks at the bar).\n\nThe food came fast, but therein lies the downside.  It seemed to arrive a little to fast, and the fish seemed a little dry, not glistening as though freshly cut.  Our assumption was that they maybe cut a few standards and have them on hand for the evening...  Was pretty tasty, and I'm sure it was very fresh, but as I'm learning that good sushi is about more senses than just taste (I'm thinking texture, look...) I'll have to say 3 stars.", "author": "Andy M."}

I had heard about the size of the establishment and braced myself for a wait.  Surprisingly, no one was there.  I easily scored a seat at the counter.  It's so true about the sushi chef...expect to be thanked many times over.  He is soooo nice and very skilled in his craft.  The wood counter is used to serve up your sushi...saves on plates and it's also an indication how serious they are about their sushi here.  A quick glance at the wall and you'll see their health inspection card of 100.  It's impeccably clean here with a minimalist design.  To continue with the minimalist concept, their menu is only sushi and sashimi, which suits me fine.  Since I was only snacking, I stuck with ordering nigiri...no maki for me.  I scanned the menu and ordered up my usual fare of amaebi, uni, and hamachi.  I was hoping for some sake (fresh salmon) but all they had was smoked, which surprised me.  I opted for a kani (fresh crab), which out of the nigiri that I ordered, really didn't do it for me.  The fish was very fresh and it easily won me over.  I won't say it was the best that I've had, but it definitely deserves the praise that it gets.  The hamachi was exceptional tonight and I decided to order 2nds.  My gracious host then informed me that he had Toro, which isn't even on the menu.  Having had the worst toro ever at Miyozen in Emeryville, I was looking for someplace to win me over with toro again.  Okina restored my love for toro once again.  Oh, and I did have 2nds of hamachi.  Total cost, $27.50 with TORO!  Next time...sashimi.  Great little not-quite-hole-in-the-wall sushi joint in the Richmond.", "author": "JeFF T."}

The chef is an absolute sweetheart, the fish is very fresh, and you can't beat the price. We had reservations at the bar and ordered omakase. With the size of their selection which is somewhat limited I'd say we probably tried everything they had. I didn't have a bad bite the whole night. Our favorites were the Thai red snapper, the halibut and the anchovy nigiri (which I hadn't had before!). Unfortunately they were out of uni. I like though that they won't serve something they don't believe is quality - they only serve smoked salmon because they don't like the quality of fresh salmon available. Service was fast on getting us some fish straight off which I loved, some places you wait forever for your first items. For four people with drinks and enough sushi for four hungry folks to all be full, it was $120 including tip, which I thought was amazing. We usually pay at least that for 2 people. We'll definitely be back! One note - cash only. We were relieved to have cash on us.", "author": "Sarah R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-30", "description": "Okina is good for value sushi. I like how they don't use salmon and instead use smoked salmon... not because i don't like salmon but rather because of the dangers of eating farmed salmon (which is most of the salmon you see in sushi places) as there are more contaminants in farmed salmon. I've never personally gotten sick fr/ salmon and actually I don't know anyone who has, but i think the toxins in it are bad for you. So it's good when a place actually recognizes the dangers and doesn't give it to you. I ordered the Chirashi and enjoyed it much as they provided the japanese radishes on top of the normal Chirashi toppings. For $10-11 for my Chirashi, I'm sure to be back.

I am slightly biased because it is around the corner from my house but you will not be disappointed.  The space is very small, but cozy, good idea to make reservations if you can.  I saw that some people have complained that it is only open a few days a week, but the truth is that means you are getting a fresher product.  No fish keeps very long, but many restaurants will keep it till it goes bad.  That can't even be an issue here since they are only open 3 days a week as far as I know.  Everything I have had here is great, and it is a good idea to just let the master behind the sushi bar, or the waitress to just guide you, they know what it good for that day.  The people here treat you with the upmost sincerity and the food stands up to their service.  If you want some fresh, awesome sushi...look no further.  The only downside is there is no music, but I have found it is kinda nice because then you can just talk at a regular voice and hear your conversation.  It doesn't hurt the vibe much.", "author": "Timothy O."}

With a menu so simple (compared to some of the other Geary street sushi bars with hundreds of rolls), the sushi should have been more satisfying in flavor and texture (my nori (seawood wrap) wasn't as fresh).
