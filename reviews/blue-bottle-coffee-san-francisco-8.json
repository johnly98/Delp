Furthermore, the brew itself had a distinct citrus taste, which I did not enjoy. I'm hindsight, I should have inquired as to the brew flavor before purchasing, but I took no more than 3 sips (each progressively worse) before disposing of the cup.\n\nLastly, as to the pretzel bun, I experienced quite a whirlwind of emotions, which I do not enjoy when eating a simple pretzel bun. Initially unappealing and unfamiliar, then somehow much more inviting and flavorful, but then, once again, becoming some sort of cheesy, doughy substance that I would not think of as a pretzel in bun form.\n\nConsidering the exceptionally high reviews for this place, I was very disappointed with my purchases and would not return here again.

It's small (actually, tiny!) place with a simple roll up garage to open up the store front. They're located on Linden Street (Hayes Valley) - but more like Linden 'alley' so to speak. \n\nThis isn't a store, so seating is curbside or standing. \n\nEverything here is delicious!

Gives me a great excuse to walk the 20 minutes down there to grab coffee on a nice weekend morning. My absolute favorite is the New Orleans Iced coffee. I know you can get those in a carton pretty much at any boujee grocery store but trust me getting it from the tap at the actual store is way better! I sometimes will get their bagged coffee to make at home and it always smells so good. Seriously someone should make a candle scent from it and I will buy them out!

I asked what the difference was between Cafe au Lait and Latte since both were on the menu. I always thought they were the French and Italian versions of the same thing. They told me that a Cafe au Lait is made with drip coffee and some milk whereas a Latte is made with espresso and a lot of milk. So not so much coffee. \n\nSeeing as I was at Blue Bottle, it seemed a horrific waste to buy milk but it was morning so I opted for the $4 Cafe au Lait. It looked like a latte with a foamy top but it was delightful deliciousness. Like the perfect amount of coffee and milk married together in creamy harmony. \n\nI sat in the tiny park across the way and watched an even tinier mouse gather food and take it to it's tiny underground nest. By the time my friend joined me, a huge line had formed. 9 AM seems to be the tipping point on a Saturday morning. We lined up to get her a coffee and I ended up getting ANOTHER one! It was so good.

It was my last morning in SF and I was glad that they agreed not to withstand the wait. Erika had already went to Blue Bottle and she guided us to this gem. Luckily, it was very close to Dottie's. \n\nThere was a bit of a line, but it only took about five minutes to give our orders. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I decided that I would experience this place on a food level. I was torn on whether to order a grilled cheese sandwich or the quinoa salad. So... I did what other foodies would do, and I ordered both. After all, I had a flight to catch and I could always carry it with me,  and that's what I did.\n\nBefore my order was ready, we stood and watched them make the picturesque espressos, and coffees. It was after they got their coffees, I still hadn't been given my bottle of water, that I asked about it. The barista graciously apologized and asked if I ordered still or sparkling water. Later as I was looking at my Square receipt, I noticed that I wasn't charged for a bottled water. The cashier must've thought that I wanted a complimentary glass of water and the barista was so kind, that he didn't even question me or ask to see my receipt. That was awesome and worth five stars alone. I'll be mailing a thank you note and and $3. \n\n The grilled cheese sandwich was perfectly grilled. It came with mushrooms and onions, which was not something that I would've requested, but I'm glad that was the way that it was served. I'll be adding mushrooms to my grilled cheese in the future. \n\nThe quinoa salad was served in a mason jar... unlike anything that I've ever had before. It was perfect for a mid-flight snack. I'm glad that the not so nice SF TSA agents didn't confiscate it. \n\nAll in all, I recommend this place for food and coffee.

Do they? Fascinating.)  \n\nBoyfriend - \"Okay. I mean, if it's easier for you to give them to me separately that's fine. I can combine them myself.\" \n\nA few minutes pass while he pours the coffee and espresso shot. My boyfriend and I are struggling not to laugh in his face about how rude and ridiculous he's being. He rings the coffee and espresso shot up for $7.50ish.  \n\nBoyfriend - \"Why didn't you just charge me the price for a coffee and an extra shot? Shouldn't it be $4.50 or so?\"\n\nAloof barista guy - \"Because they're separate.

But precisely at 6:30 the two gray garage doors slowly opened and out popped BBC.  I ordered a large latte and a small coffee.  The stoic barista put a coffee cup on a scale, a drip system on top of the cup and intermittently poured just the correct amount of water over the coffee to make a perfect brew. While he was brewing the coffee he made my latte behind espresso machine using conventional means. When done he placed two 12 ounce cups for me on the counter. At first I thought hey where is my large latte?, then I realize this is one of those places where they only make one size coffee(A little snooty!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-01", "description": "I have been visiting this Blue Bottle location for quite some time to buy bags of coffee beans for my friends outside of California. This coffee stand operates out of a tiny garage in a nondescript alley that is hard to find for those who are not familiar with Hayes Valley. On my very first visit a few years ago I had to catch a cab and not even the driver had heard of the street. One thing striking about their beans is the fact that they embody a deep aroma that is complex and highly sensitizing where prolonged inhalation can cause long term stimulation like Viagra for those who wishes to try it.\n\nAmong a whole gamut of beans available from all over the world, my go-to cup is the Giant Step with soy ($2.50). According to their website Giant Step is a blend of Sumatran and Ugandan organic coffees that is quite dark and chocolaty. It has a thick fuller taste with a satisfying finish that is hard to beat. Their handmade coffee is so popular that I often find myself in a long line before I can get a drip. Fortunately there wasn't a line on my most recent trip in the late afternoon, but service was still distanced and they didn't have as many beans available as before.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving Blue Bottle a 4.5 stars rating is the fact that my top choice for coffee is still Philz. Although Blue Bottle has superior beans that are second to none, their service is not as personable and I often felt very rushed to making a decision.  At Philz, it is their duty to personalize each cup until it is perfectly satisfied. Here, I had to add my own soy and sugar and the nature of interaction with the establishment is much more transient and disconnected. In spite of these limitations, I'm still a big fan as their amazing coffee should never be overlooked or dismissed. They also sell their beans online so I recommend for any serious coffee drinkers to check them out: http://store.bluebottlecoffee.net/StoreFront.bok. It's good coffee to the very last drop.", "author": "Daniel L."}

But I can see why...you really enjoy the true coffee flavors this way for true coffee connoisseurs. Which, clearly I'm not...I just love me a good girly latte with an excellent layer of foam.

Finally I picked one, and I mentioned that there was a bean that I've been missing for quite some time and it was what hooked me on Blue Bottle, and immediately the guy said \"Yemen?\" Oh wow. Yep....that was it. They've had different versions (or whatever the proper coffee-talk vernacular is) of a Yemen bean over the years, but the original one I can still taste. Mmmmm. \n\nAnyway, picked my bag of beans, brought it home....and it was *okay*. The problem is they're competing against themselves with something that doesn't exist anymore and so they can't win.

My friend and I thought that maybe they were just catching up on orders since there were a couple of people waiting around for their cup of coffee. \n\nAfter 5 minutes of no acknowledgement from any of the staff, the cashier finally turns around and asks us if we've been helped. My friend and I politely tell her no and she responds to us by saying \"okay. Carrie will help you when she's done\" WHAT???? Why would you ignore us, then ask us if we've been helped, and not help us?? \n\nAfter 5 minutes of my friend and I looking at each other, one of the girls from the other side of where we're standing notices a regular who's standing behind us and asks if the regular wanted her usual, an americana. So not only is the cashier and the other 2 girls ignoring us, they decide to notice the regular and make her order before they event took our orders! \n\nFinally, after waiting what seems like forever, the same cashier turns around and takes our order. My friend ordered the New Orleans and I asked the cashier for half a pound of the darkest roast for my boyfriend. She gives our order in 2 minutes!! It took us 30-40 mins of waiting for something that only takes 2 minutes to make! No wonder there's a freaking line all the time, bc they take so damn long to actually take someones order. It doesn't make any sense to me why they would take their sweet time to take someones order when they could make the orders so quickly. \n\nThe worst part of going to Blue Bottle Co is when my boyfriend opens the bag of coffee later on that night, he tells me that THEY DIDN'T EVEN GRIND THE COFFEE BEANS! The Cashier never even asked me if I wanted my coffee beans grinded  and just tossed the bag onto the table for me. \n\nIn the end, the New Orleans was meh.. and we can't even try the half a pound since it's not grinded so all we paid for was crappy service from 3 hipster girls.

I need my cup of joe before I can crack a smile in the morning or take coherent notes in class. \n\nBUT, i dont really know that much about coffee. coffee beans from some other part of the world that has a stronger something aftertaste than your regular starbucks....I mean, I understand the difference in taste..but i dont think i truly know how to differentiate or enjoy really good coffee...YET. but no better way to learn and discover than trying right?? :D I've heard rave reviews from friends, and after looking it up on yelp, i knew i had to go!! \n\nMy wonderful friend brought me here and it was really interesting finding the place. It was in a cramped alleyway and was in what looked like a small garage. No other signs or indications besides the menu and a small sign at the front of the bar. Oh, and of course, the line. (I think if the garage-like door was closed, you wouldnt be able to know Blue Bottle was there!) \n\nThere was something so charming about the place though. So neighborhood-y, down-the-block, no pretentious-ness. Wooden bar, simply blue sign and menu, and long line with dogs on leashes and what looked like residents of the neighborhood out for a walk. \n\nI ordered a latte and my friend got their drip coffee. I enjoyed the drip coffee better, because I felt like i could really taste the coffee. The latte was good, but was a little too milky for me and tasted diluted. (i expected more of a coffee taste.) So I definitely recommend their drip coffee! \n\nsome reviews mention \"New Orleans Iced Coffee\" and that founds interesting!! I really want to try that next time.", "author": "Eileen K."}

I move quick.  \n\nTheir Iced coffee is great.  I don't need to add any sweet or milky substances to mask taste.  It has a nice deep caramelized flavor that is a bit unique, but likable.  Reminds me of Caffe Streets in Wicker Park (don't worry Blue Bottle, your name is cooler).  \n\nThere are a few rare occasions when I think it's brewed a little too long, and the deliciousness boundary has crossed over to the bitter side, I'll add half a Splenda.    Which btw, can be gotten half a block away at the other, not as good coffee stand.  (Blue bottle doesn't have Splenda... goose!)\n\n\n\nCool location, worth checking out.

I assumed it was a brand of Vietnamese coffee and I was surprised to see that they operate this little kiosk out of a garage in a random alleyway. The menu here is kept very simple. The barista must have been so confused when I asked if the drip coffee could be prepared Vietnamese style with the condensed milk. Maybe they have that option at the other location or maybe it's a creation of Humphry Slocombe? \n\nAnyways, I settled for a latte, which they do very well. I got a cool leaf design, which I haven't seen at my usual coffee stops. They also don't add the sugar for you, which is foreign to me.

I tasted a Mocha and a Hot chocolate and they were only slightly sweet; the chocolate is all about the highlighting the cocoa flavor.

Wow, that sounded kind of horrible, but I am very firm on my belief that Philz is better.\n\nI'm a bit of a coffee snob. I think it's kind of well-known within my circle of friends that I love coffee. One day I got a reaction from a friend that was something like, \"Oh you go to Philz Coffee every morning? I've never been but I LOVE Blue Bottle and it's seriously THE BEST!\" Then I started hearing it from more people; \"Have you tried Blue Bottle yet? It's really popular.\" Alright fine, out of my obsessive quest for better and better coffee, I figured I'll give it a try. Blue Bottle Coffee is GOOD coffee, but it's NOT the best. I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? Just to reassure myself of my disappointment with all the undeserved hype, I went quite a few times (if a Blue Bottle location happened to be nearby). I've had their regular drip, their latte, their mocha, their cappuccino, and their new orleans iced coffee... in that order. MEH. Good, bold flavor but they don't have the variety or addicting factor that Philz hooked me with on Day 1. If anything, it's a little too standard. I'd pick it over Starbucks and Peets if it were nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.\n\nIf one more person tries to convert me, I really do think I will snap. Something along the lines of \"F#$% you and your hipster coffee. You don't know s@&% so stop soliciting me with your blue bottle bulls@&%\" would efficiently but inadequately express my annoyance. I've showed many of my friends the way... to Philz.

Tucked away on the tranquil, inviting Linden street, it's usually easy to spot this gem by the line that's often spilling into the street, but don't be intimidated, it moves fast. Bring cash and a craving and I guarantee you will walk away pleased. Their coffee is practically a religious experience. I recommend the drip coffee, which is individually prepared right in front of you. if your pockets are deep, spring for a latte or mocha -- but be prepared to pay for a \"small\" size what you'd normally pay for a large at most other cafes. But hey, we are talking quality over quantity here! You will taste the difference, and there are many fine reviews here on yelp to back that claim up.\n\nBeing a kiosk, seating is limited. You'll find a few benches nearby and plenty of well-shaded (and very clean) sidewalks. If you've never been down Linden St, this may sound uninviting--trust me, it's anything but! Linden is a nice place to hang out, feeling more like a park than a street (mind the occasional slow-driving car, though).

For some reason though I find this particular location a little annoying. It's sort of hard to get to if you approach from Gough because you have to play Frogger to get there. Once you are there you are greeted by a friendly group of people in a loooong line. I am used to all the blue bottles being a long line. However usually they dissipate rather quickly. This one on the other hand feels like forever. I could have sworn I sat in the line for 10+ minutes just to order. I know I could go elsewhere, but it was the principal of the thing ... I had waited that long already. Maybe I am just grouchy because I hadn't had coffee in the morning yet. \n\nAnyways I am always sort of intrigued by the baked goods that every location has. This one does not have croissants :(  But it does have snickerdoodles. They were ok. The rest of the stuff seems a little large for a morning snack on the way to work.

Kiosk is a code word for super-uber-hip alleyway coffee place only known by locals, and with only curb-side seating, aka no tables and chairs.  But that just increases the mystique.\n\nA good friend of mine from SF calls these places \"designer coffee\".  I just call it good!  They're really into espresso, how the coffee is ground (the doser), how fresh it is, how it is pressed into the filter basket, how long the shot runs for (25-30 seconds), and how to pull a ristretto.  The place just smells of coffee, but without the tiny sign on the street, how would you find it?  It's almost like they only want the determined, dedicated coffee drinkers to find the place.  And they do, coming streaming down the alley toward this place from all directions to form a line of 10-20 people sort of continuously throughout the day.  \n\nIf you are an espresso geek, you probably already know about this place.

A friend told me about Blue Bottle and explained that he got weekly deliveries to his house from them on the day when beans are roasted (Monday).  He recommended that I join their home delivery program, promising me that I'd be pulling killer espressos in my kitchen.  I sent e-mail to their sales department expressing my excitement at the prospect of trying their coffee and asking that I get home deliveries just like my friend.  My message was warm and fuzzy -- one coffee lover writing to others.  This didn't work out so well: since the home delivery program was accepting no new clients, I was advised to order by mail from the web site.  This took a long time to get going because they took a few weeks off for Christmas and New Years and because I wanted to order two half-pounds, whereas the web site wanted me to order whole pounds.\n\nFinally things got ironed out and my beans came in the mail.  How was my first espresso?  Excellent.  My second?  Excellent.  The coffee was very \"sweet,\" and it had a subtle and refined taste.  As you can imagine, the beans became noticeably less fresh as I got to the bottoms of my half-pound bags.  That was the end of my mail-order experiment; now, I buy Blue Bottle beans at the Berkeley Farmers' Market on Tuesdays and Saturdays in half-pound bags.\n\nSince the beans are roasted on Mondays, I get fresher beans on Tuesdays than on Saturdays.  For me, the absolute best thing about the Tuesday market is the antique propane-fired hand espresso maker, and the barrista who makes it purr.  This guy, whoever he is, makes a killer macchiato.  In addition, he insists on advising me each week on my bean selection.  Once he's reminded of my espresso maker's brand and model, he'll recommend the blend that will best for my home espressos for the coming week.  The recommendation changes from week to week, allegedly because he's taking into account the results of the previous day's roasting.  Maybe he's just fooling around and giving me random recommendations.  No matter -- whatever he recommends always tastes great to me.\n\nThe people who sell me beans on Saturdays don't offer me any recommendations, and I don't ask for any.  I buy the Roman espresso, and I take it home and make coffee.  I'm not especially in love with the famous Blue Bottle drip coffee because I find it a bit weak for my taste.  Nevertheless, I occasionally buy as cup if I want something to drink around the market.  I've yet to break out in hives.\n\nIf you live in the Bay Area and like coffee, you should try Blue Bottle coffee.  It may not be your favorite, but you'll probably admit, at the very least, that it makes a good cup.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

My boyfriend and I were randomly walking the wild and brutal streets of Hayes Valley. It really was a random walk -- I said turn right, we turned right, he said left and we turned left. At some point, I stuck my nose in the air and pulled him into a small alleyway. There, in front of our eyes was Blue Bottle Coffee, a coffee shop that we will, no doubt, be addicted to in the future. \n\nYou can smell the shop from a block away and yet the place is small enough that you would walk past it without noticing. I think the place is built in a garage or something like that. But oh, the coffee. \n\nI love coffee. I think I'm a bit of a coffee snob, in fact. I try not to be, but I just can't help myself. But the coffee here is fantastic. The latte was amazing. The milk was steamed right and the beans weren't over roasted and the grinds were pulled right. \n\nThere was some talk about a $20,000 Japanese espresso machine.

Found it that everyone in SF drinks Blue Bottle.\n\nSo i came to their original location which basically operates with semi long lines and artsy fartsy workers out of a garage! \n\nEach cup is individually brewed ensuring freshness. The first time I went, I really liked the blend they were serving. It was smooth yet strong and flavorful with a pleasant kick on the finish. The second time i went, i think they were brewing something else and it wasn't as memorable. They definitely brew it thick so it's actually something I think i'd drink with food and not on an empty stomach. \n\nMy husband also got the New Orleans Iced Coffee - i'm not sure what the rave is about it. I mean it's good and strong if you like cold drinks, but just tastes like Iced Coffee to me.

Then she suggested I get the Soy Iced New Orleans Coffee because adding soy to steamed coffee on ice makes it more bitter (i think that's what she said). Basically, I ordered a bad combo. Oops. I'm glad she spoke up because the New Orleans style (slow dripped) was pretty good. It reminded me of dark, dark chocolate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-11", "description": "Like others have said before, there isn't much more that I can add about how great Blue Bottle Coffee is. I usually buy their drip coffee as I am rapidly becoming a sort of coffee \"purist\" and although I am still an amateur coffee geek at best, I will say that they make some of the best drip coffee I've ever had. It is incredibly smooth, flavorful, and to me it is just the right temperature. I don't like scalding hot beverages although I know some people do enjoy their hot beverages that way. For those who don't enjoy their coffee black, I have also tried their cappuccino and New Orleans-style iced coffee and I can say with confidence that these are equally excellent. They also have an excellent selection of roasted beans for those who want to brew their own coffee at home with a variety of single origins as well as their own custom blends(which are quite good). As mentioned before by others, the baristas are very friendly and efficient. \n\nNow I would like to address something that has probably been addressed before here but I'll go ahead and address it anyway. I'd like to emphasize once again that I am no expert on coffee brewing and I am still learning but I can say that I probably know more than the average person. I've read some reviews where people found the coffee at Blue Bottle to be bland and lukewarm. While I heartily disagree I can see why Blue Bottle coffee may taste this way to some people. When brewing coffee, the three elements that are most important aside from the particular beans used are the grind, water temperature, and brewing time. If you use water that is too hot, you'll likely end up burning the coffee grounds and destroying the flavors. If you allow too little time for \"steeping\"(the part in which the coffee grounds are mixed with water) then you'll come out with bland, flavorless coffee. Allow the coffee to steep for too long and you'll have coffee that is much too bitter.  \n\nAt Blue Bottle and other boutique coffee shops, the baristas closely monitor the temperature and steeping time of the coffee and probably use other methods of which I am unaware of in an effort to produce the smoothest and most flavorful cup of coffee. From what I can tell, it is the relative lack of bitterness in Blue Bottle Coffee that causes many to perceive Blue Bottle Coffee as \"smooth\" while some might perceive it to be \"bland.\" Also, the baristas here tend to brew coffee at a lower temperature than other places so as not to burn the beans. To an individual accustomed to coffee being scalding hot or at least close to it, the coffee at Blue Bottle might seem lukewarm in contrast. I'm also certain that since the baristas are humans and not robots programmed with advanced coffee brewing algorithms, they do mess up once in awhile and produce unsatisfactory cups of coffee. \n\nAnyway, I'd be surprised if you took the time to read all of that but either way, go and check this place out! Even if you don't end up liking the coffee, Hayes Valley is a cool little neighborhood.", "author": "Michael C."}

They named a few spots, including Blue Bottle, and I had remembered hearing good things about the place. So off we went to BB.\n\nWe approached the literal hole-in-the-wall kiosk, which was interesting and unexpected. There was quite a line, but it moved fairly quickly, so I didn't take much notice. There were three efficient baristas working, with all three taking orders. A girl popped out from behind the counter, and while there were a good three or four people standing ahead, she made eye contact with us and asked for our orders. Apparently her hearing is of super power strength too, because we practically muttered our orders from where we were standing. Yet, she got everything easily.\n\nIt didn't take long before our coffees were ready, and when I took the first sip of my soy latte, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was exceptionally smooth yet bold, and there was a tinge of sweetness despite the absence of sugar. The soy milk probably gave it the subtle sweet edge, and whatever type they used was pretty perfect.\n\nMy soy latte was so good, that I actually finished the entire cup in a span of 15 minutes.

Speaking of baristas, John and Ashley make a great team behind the counter and definitely brightened my otherwise huge letdown of a post-holiday Monday morning.\n\nThe quality and service have been so consistent it's not even really a question anymore; if I'm nearby during operating hours I'm getting a cup of drip regardless of weather or line.  I'm sure eventually I'll admit my addiction to great coffee but that day isn't coming anytime soon.", "author": "Steven R."}

I think they may have scalded the milk just a wee bit, which affected the taste - but the flavor of the coffee itself was nice and smooth. His coffee was full-bodied, and rich.

I don't mind calling this emperor out on their lack of clothes; I found the coffee to be wholly unremarkable.\n\nStaff are efficient and courteous. Facility is clean; the \"fixin's table\" is well-appointed and tidy. Line moves slowly and the wait was always about 5-10 minutes before I could order. On a nice day, it's forgivable, as the garage is on a quiet side street and it's enjoyable to loiter (or \"stand about\").\n\nFor a while, I went here with a friend that was a big fan of the place. I should mention that I prefer rich, smooth coffee (French-pressed medium roast all-Kona) but because of the cost and time involved, you can't find it in coffee shops; you must prepare it yourself. This makes me somewhat particular as to what shops I purchase from, as I've noticed a move towards stronger coffee in the city's non-chain coffee shops over the last two or three years.\n\nI only purchased coffee at Blue Bottle, not espresso, so I can only comment on same. Blue Bottle coffee tastes like a finely-ground dark roast, made with 2/3 the regular amount of water. Aroma is unremarkable; taste is rich and strong without being bitter and over-extracted; it is, however, a little astringent (\"gritty\") in the mouth. That texture is somewhat unavoidable in strong coffee; cream helps soften it. The coffee seems to be a dark roast, which I don't care for; about the best I can say is that it doesn't taste burned.\n\nThe place didn't do anything for me except give me an excuse to leave the rat maze for 20 minutes on a nice day. If you like strong coffee, businesses operating out of garages, and/or hipsters, check it out.", "author": "Asa D."}

It looked like a scene out of Night of the Living Dead - zombie like masses converging on this little alley street.  They all emerged from the same street bearing cups of coffee and what I mistook for blood lust in their eyes was merely caffeine deficiency (or I guess caffeine Lust).  Everyone left that alley with a little more pep in their step and a look in their eye akin to that of a junkie who has just scored.  \n\nNow, the crack euphemism has been done to death here on Yelp . . heck, I am even guilty of it.  But crack is so much more accessible than, say, heroin 'cause when I think of a crack addict I can picture Whitney Houston in my head (and who can forget her angelic (yet bony) little visage in the \"Dance with Somebody\" video?) as opposed to heroin which brings up the mental image of John Frusciante in that sad and scary documentary when he was FUCKED UP.  Whitney all peppy and cute vs. John all wasted and wasted.   Anyhoo. . .so this stuff is at least related slightly to crack.  It is really, really good coffee that packs a caffeine wallop of love.  Coffee made with passion and exacting standards.  \n\nSo why only three stars?  Well because I have had Blue Bottle Coffee at other venues and if it's not made by their highly qualified and wonderful baristas, the coffee just isn't the same.  Anytime I've had it any where else it's been \"meh\" it's all right. . nothing special.  \n\nIt really is only made well when Blue Bottle employees make it.  But then again, I totally understand why they distribute to restaurants, etc.  While the passion for truly great coffee is there, it's also a business and businesses need to make money.   However, the caveat is that distributing it to other venues lessens the appeal in a way because had I not gone to the kiosk on Linden, I would have never known how truly good this coffee is.  \n\nAlso, it's a small world. . . and when you own a company you have to watch your actions as your actions will impact people's perception of your business.  In fact, I hate myself for even liking this coffee but I have to be honest and say that it is damn good coffee as long as you get it from one of their kiosks where it's made by people who most likely will get to know your name and ask you if you want your regular. . try getting that from Starbucks!", "author": "Lainie L."}

Back in DC, I loved my fantastic coffee shop (Murky), and I was hoping Blue Bottle would be something of a replacement.  Accordingly, I've gone at least four days a week in the hopes of starting up some kind of nice relationship.\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH BLUE BOTTLE\na two-part series.\n\n1.  The coffee quality is much lower than the snobbish attitude.\nThe coffee itself is fine--and I guess relatively high for the Bay Area, considering the other options. But aside from the general employee attitude, there's nothing telling you what beans they're using for any drink on any given day.  I understand they may have some uneducated coffee drinkers who don't care, but please, for the rest of us, a small sign would suffice.  It's already insupportable enough that they don't have sizes or other things that make life pleasant for consumers; at least let us make educated decisions about what to order.\n\nIn case you were wondering, I *would* like to just ask the baristas what I'm getting, but that's rarely an option, due to the fact that...\n\n2.  The service is bad.\nThey're busy all the time.  I get it.  But there are simple ways of making customer experiences better even when you're overworked, like allowing customers to pay when they're ordering (thereby increasing facetime and allowing customers to ask questions close to the register, something they may not feel comfortable doing shouting from ten feet away).  It would also help if the baristas spent time with each customer, instead of chatting away with one or two people while shouting at customers further back.    (It would also also be nice to get a glimmer of recognition after the twentieth visit in thirty days, but sometimes that can be asking too much.)\n\nAside from these two key points, I've had a lot of negative incidents where I've been ignored, brushed aside, made to wait while conversations were finished, and otherwise treated like a particularly obnoxious customer while waiting quietly for my drink.  I can understand this happening once or twice, but as I mentioned, I've got many a time since moving here and their attitude remains the same whether busy or slow, in the morning or near closing, and no matter who is working.  It's puzzling at best and infuriating at worse. \n\nI'll continue to give Blue Bottle my business since none of the other cafes around me have remotely good coffee.

It's the only iced drink offered at this little kiosk so, after hearing a succinct description of the beverage, I ordered one. The flavor was both uncommon and uncommonly good, with no ruinous bitter edge.\n\nI think I can give the place five stars based on my appreciation of this one drink, the quick-moving line, the awareness that they use Valrhona chocolate in their mocha and hot chocolate, and for getting to enjoy the blare of ACDC from the shop speakers during my last brief stay in the alleyway.\n\n*Returned yesterday and the New Orleans Iced Coffee was on the house because I agreed to be the taste tester.

Damn, I felt my Inner Kool Kwotient kick up about 5 notches just by breathing the same air as some of these SoHo BoHo types.  Never has the \"just-rolled-outta-bed\" look been more perfected.  I swear, even some of the DOGS milling about were having a BHDWA (Bad Hair Day With Angst).  \n\nJokes aside, it really felt like I was kicking it on some side street in Copenhagen or Amsterdam, marveling at the wondrous smells wafting from this virtual garage.  The demographic was a serious sub-set of caff-inators (great people watching material), the service was brisk, they had the wherewithal to serve their concoction in actual ceramic cups AND saucers (for those who choose the \"for here\" option), and the local park for hanging out was just a stone's throw away, to wile away the hours and read the Sunday rag of choice.  Oh, and BTW, Hayes Valley is without a doubt a haven for all things hip.  Where else could you find a corset shop next to a coffee bar?

I quickly found myself in the only Castro bar that I frequent - Lucky 13.  Okay, so it isn't really gay in the strictest sense of the word, but they ARE in the Castro, so you've got to give me that.\n\nAmid the free popcorn, good tunes and generalized merriment emerged Drunk Steve (aka Hipster Steve).  I had been playing the \"stare at you to figure out if you are the only other queer guy in here\" game with Drunk Steve for a while until he finally told me to make sure I say hello before I leave.  On my way out I said hello and Drunk Steve slurred \"I want to get to know you, I'll give you the best blow job of your life.\"\n\nWell, that guaranteed a date.  We exchanged numbers and a few days later arranged to meet for coffee at Blue Bottle.  A wise decision as the only things I knew about Drunk Steve is that he gave good blow jobs.  Considering that Drunk Steve could have also been a psycho/murderer (good blow jobs non-withstanding), I decided to meet Drunk Steve in typical craigslist/internet dating style, somewhere public and with easy escape routes.\n\nBlue Bottle's alleyway location seemed perfect for my needs.\n\nThe macchiato (the coffee with which I judge all coffee shops) was overextracted and far too bitter.  Also, my barista overfilled my tiny mug with milk giving me a sticky saucer.  Perhaps my expectations were high, but I've had better coffee in lots of different places.  I will try again as per the excessively good Yelp reviews, but another bad coffee and it is gone.\n\nPros: Drunk Steve = Not a Murderer!\nCons: Still haven't found out about the \"Best Blow Job Ever\"", "author": "Mat K."}

If you don't have a few minutes to get a gibraltar or cappuccino and talk with the barista, enjoying a perfect coffee out of a proper ceramic cup - you probably shouldn't be allowed to have one. Spend your time in line contemplating what you are going to have, wait with exhilirating anticipation as you see the barista making your drink, and spend a couple of minutes in pure contemplation while you enjoy it. Such a drink shouldn't be rushed - sloshed into a paper cup and chugged as you rush to your next appointment. As they do it in Italy and France, slow down and take a quick pause with a coffee and actually engage in conversation, or read the newspaper, or just take a minute to enjoy a perfect cup.\r\n\r\nThe consistancy issues that plagued them initially seem to be gone with the new roasting equipment, but at the same time, the individual character of the beans haven't been impacted.

Until I discovered Blue Bottle, I had been very disappointed.  The people here really know their coffee, and do it right on so many levels.  I could rant on and on about their technique, roast etc, but I'll just point out a few things I have noticed that sets Blue Bottle Coffee apart from the other coffee places I've tried:\n\nThe Beans:\nFresh, well roasted (not burnt.)  They sell blends and single origin selections to accommodate everybody's tastes --- mostly organic, shade grown and free trade.  Also, they won't sell beans roasted more than two days ago.  That's the benefit of being a \"micro-roaster.\"  Try going into any other cafe and asking when their beans were roasted.\n\nThe Machine:\nI was very surprised to find that they have a modified La Marzocco with PID from which they make all of their shots.  The La Marzocco is a great machine on its own, and the PID helps maintain the machine temperature stability with great accuracy.  Espresso requires a very specific temperature (194-200F), outside of which the shots will become bitter or sour. This is often overlooked by many other cafes. \n\nThe Grind:\nThey grind for each drink, vs grinding at the beginning of the day and dispensing pre-ground coffee.  Since espresso is sensitive to the freshness of the grounds, this is an important thing.\n\nThe Shot:\nThe sign says that all of their shots are double-ristretto, and they remain true to that.  This short shot of espresso brings with it all of the aromatic flavors and full body of the coffee.\n\nThe taste:\nWow.  Smooth, woody, caramel, nutty goodness.  Of the four blends I have tried so far, each has its distinct personality.\n\nIt's definitely worth the trip across town, or a long wait in line for this good coffee experience.", "author": "Shea G."}

Boy was I wrong, it is among the worst tasting coffee I have ever had - the flavor from those beans is sour and nasty, undrinkable.  I honestly thought the milk was sour, I was convinced it had to be that, and shocked when I found it wasn't.  Ug, horrible waste on overpriced beans, another star off.\n------------------------------------------------------\nIt would have been funny if it were named Blue Bottle after a bottle of  NOS, because, you know, the coffee does to your brain what a shot of nitrous does to an engine.  Okay, that's not amusing at all and just lame and geeky - I blame the wine.\n\nThe coffee was good but I still think my dark bean Graffeo made at home is a better balance of strong flavor sans bitterness. Other then that the mocha I've swigged off the husband's cup has been nice, but mochas always taste like some hot chocolate confection to me and it is hard to say how good the coffee is underneath all that.\n\nPoints scored for using organic stuff, creating pretty designs in the foam, attitude, and an earnest effort.  Prices are high and parking is a bitch, but that is a given with the area.  As others have stated, the lack of seating is a negative and it forces you to get coffee to go (paper cups are never as good for the joe in  my opinion), and then the stores hate you coming in with your beverage and will even ask you to leave it up front.  Best to go when you can actually sit there or are not planning on shopping, otherwise you might as well just skip the coffee and head to Suppenkuche for a pint and a schnitzengruben.", "author": "GIR .."}

But it serves a purpose, and might I add, a \"higher purpose\", at that.  \n\nYou'll find the original storefront in an alley, a 1/2 block south, and parallel to, the eastern end of the Hayes Valley strip (x Gough St.), and the location feels a world away.  The street is tight, and a bit dirty, but nothing overwhelming, given the nature of SF, and it has only gotten more and more cleaned up over the past year or two.  Blue Bottle is simply a kiosk - well, a large one with all the fancy grinding, espresso-making, etc. gear required for high-end drink preparation -  in an open garage, but some seats have been set out on the small sidewalks.  And somehow, this has helped foster a sense of community, like you're all out here in the street, drinking some great coffee (or hot chocolate) together - or something.  \n\nWhatever.. it's a good scene.  And the chance to strike up conversation with a stranger is higher than you might think.  \n\nTo continue, I am not a coffee connoisseur, but I do understand the concept of connoisseurship, in general (beer anyone?), and know that in such company, the coffee Blue Bottle roasts is held in high regard.  Check out a few of the beans, from various origins around the world (roasted in Oakland always not more than 2 days ago), and definitely ask if you would like some advice (although on a busy weekend, you don't want to be monopolizing everyone's time, I think). \n\nOf course, your service varies by barista and the amount of folks in line, etc., but in general I've found every interaction to be friendly, running the gamut from efficient (but pleasant) to extremely chatty (and I'm not a chatty one to begin with).  A smile gets you places, even in an alley in Hayes Valley. \n\nWhen I wanted to get some beans as a gift for a friend - with a more discerning palate than mine for coffee (although I guess, \"more discerning taste buds\" would be more accurate) - I mentioned her preparation method (moka pot) and maybe something about the general qualities I knew she liked (\"creamy\") and one of the gentlemen hooked me up with spot-on beans, and a leaflet to take home, describing others I might be interested in for the future. \n\nYes, so give it the benefit of the doubt - get over any hipsterness and/or snootiness you might fear  - and just give it a go.   For sure, you can find those things here (or anywhere in SF for that matter), but here you'll also have the opportunity to meet your neighbors and maybe learn a thing or two about this mysterious coffee drink (in several of it's most common forms).. \n\nIf you are in a hurry, or aren't into dirty-ish alleys, needing to be outside with your coffee.. or if you're looking for WiFi!.. I'd recommend a few other places.  No problem.  Otherwise, check out Blue Bottle; it lives up to the hype.  At the least, appreciate that it is there, even if it's not for you, because variety is the spice of life (yo).. \n\nAnd remember:  A smile gets you places, even in an alley in Hayes Valley (and maybe even moreso).", "author": "Eric H."}

I like to smell the neighborhoods.  Yes, some smell like pee but others smell like yummy ethnic foods wafting through the air.  I like to hear the sounds of people's lives  happening in the dense streets of the city.  I like to see laundry hanging in the windows because everyone has to pay for laundry in this city (I miss mom's FREE large capacity washer in the 'burbs!)  I just like being in a new world, discovering how other people live.\n\nOn a walk through Hayes Valley I came across an alley.  I noticed there was a long line of people patiently waiting for something addicting, something amazing, something I must find out for myself.  I walked by the line at first pretending to be passing by (hard to do in an alley with nothing else going for it).  Then I decided to just get in line.  I could have been in a soup kitchen line for all I knew.  It could have been a really good crack dealer at the end of this mysterious Must-have.  I didn't care, I wanted in.  This seemed like a spot where locals \"in the know\" go and I wanted to be part of the \"know\".\n\nTo my pleasant surprise at the end of the line was a coffee kiosk.  It looked like someone just opened up their garage door and started dealing cups of coffee.  As a long time Starbucks fan (I am from Seattle after all) I was happy to see the  individual cups topped with single cone filters.  This is a long process for an instant world, but the results are so much better (vietnamese coffee also falls into this category).  Any coffee place that would take the time to care for each cup like that was worth my money and curiosity.  (note that's why I'm pissed Sbux went automatic with their espresso, no more artistry).  \n\nI ordered a simple small latte.  The foam was good, the coffee was great.  Strong in flavor but smooth in finish.  I'm a fan of dark bitter coffees, but the smooth finish on Bluebottle was refreshing.

I mean I drink it, sometimes, but mostly decaf, and always with soy milk instead of dairy milk, and unfortunately most places provide soy milk as an afterthought. It's sometimes vanilla favored (why would they do that? If I wanted a flavor shot I would've asked for a flavor shot, ew), or they switch up the brands they buy all the time so the resulting drink has no consistency even if you get it from the same place every time. So I've never ever savored the flavor of coffee; I pretty much just drink it when I'm with a friend at a coffee shop, just so I don't feel bad about taking up space. Sometimes I also drink it because the other people I'm with are getting coffee, so I just roll with it and get one too. That's how I ended up at Blue Bottle on a visit out to SF.\n\nI have never in my life had a coffee that is so delicious! Until now I would never have even used the word delicious to describe coffee.

Mellow and sweet even without any sugar added, thick and creamy even with soy instead of dairy milk, and almost chocolatey in taste, even though I had decaf instead of regular.

Incredibly rich and smooth and scrumptious, and my favorite latte in the world.\n\nThis place was great when it was just the walk-up stand, but then they opened up in the Mint and I really love that spot. But what really makes them unique is their Japanese siphon bar, which is the only one in the world outside of Japan. It brews regular old coffee very very slowly over some insane period of time, I think 36 hours. When I was there they had just opened it and were running around giving out free samples in little beakers. It was very smooth, not bitter at all, and definitely unique. A must-drink for a coffee snob.", "author": "Leanna G."}

Perhaps the hype surrounding this cute little shop got my hopes up too high.  \n\nWhen I try a new coffee shop, I try a latte first, and if that's good, I'll go to espresso shots.  The latte is so I can determine whether the cafe knows their espresso, and can finish a moderately enjoyable drink, even if the coffee is bad.\n\nWhether they had poorly-roasted beans or just needed to clean the espresso machine, I couldn't tell, but the espresso was so incredibly bitter, I couldn't even drink it with its nice foamy mask.  No way would I go back and stand in a line for 15 minutes for straight up espresso.\n\nI did go back 2 times for lattes and drip, out of sheer appreciation for the literal hole-in-the-wall coffee joint, and out of wanting to like their coffee, but each time it was so bitter, I stand by my initial take.", "author": "Lucca C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-27", "description": "(I put this on the Farmer's Mkt location when it should have been here. Still true though!)\n\nAlright people, get it together. There's little point in writing yet another review about whether the BBCC coffee is good or not. Overwhelmingly, it's pretty damn good.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\n1. Don't sweat that they don't grind your coffee for you. Buy a grinder. Or bring it somewhere that will. Or buy it elsewhere. You've got options. Use them.\n\n2. What kind of 'experience' should you really be expecting? Having more than coffee is what Starbucks purports to do. Let BBCC do one thing and do it well. Go elsewhere for free wireless. Or learn to crack WEP/WPA so you can lean against the wall opposite BBCC while you sip your brew.\n\n3. Your version of bad service can happen anywhere. At a place like this, where the workers are standing for hours on end, you might stop to consider that they're not going to get down on their knees and blow just because you're there to get your latte. They may not be happy automatons you've come to love from your mall shopping trips. They're just regular people who have good days and bad days. You might be there when one or more of them has a bad day. Whatever. It's coffee. It's an interaction of only a few minutes. Plus, I'd wager that if you smiled and said hi, they'd likely smile back. Just be nice. And damn, no business or customer service person is perfect. If you've ever worked in retail or a restaurant you'd realize this and adjust your attitude accordingly.\n\n4. It's going to be a bit expensive. You generally have to pay for quality. It's not more expensive than Peet's or Starbucks anyway.\n\n5. Face it: the neighborhood is bourgeois and hip. Complaining about a coffee kiosk is pointless. If you really cared about the social effects of so many hipsters and yuppies in SF, you wouldn't be voting for Gavin Newsom press release politics that amount basically to the status quo. You'd figure some other sh*it out. Talking smack about style is fun sometimes, but it gets old.\n\n6. It's a line that probably won't last longer than 20 minutes. Talk to someone else in it. Share standing duties with a friend. Or just get some coffee elsewhere. Whatever.", "author": "Ian M."}

It operates out of a garage behind a roll-up door.\nIt will be the most amazing coffee you have ever tasted.  It will re-frame other brown liquids passing as coffee immediately into an 'other' category or possibly 'inferior'.  Those who remember what Starbucks did to elevate expectations for coffee when it expanded across the country will discover a similar impact with Blue Bottle Coffee.  Starbucks will never taste satisfactory again, as it is evident not only in the quality of the beans but also in the roasting how rich, complex and flavorful the coffee is at BBC.\n\nThere is a sign at the end of Linden and Gough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-11-15", "description": "I've been struggling with this review for days.  Blue Bottle is a tough call for me.  The verdict is kinds still out on these guys.  There is technically nothing wrong with the coffee.  The latte was good; no harshness, good temp, good froth; kinda expensive, but still alot better than some other coffee I've had.  The thing about it was that it didn't stand out, it just wasn't bad.  \r\n\r\nI actually walked around abit to figure things out.  So I went back to see if adding more espresso will do.  So I asked if I could pay a little extra to have more espresso put in.  And the man kindly obliged.  So I asked where they got their coffee to which he replied, \"We get our coffee from all over the world.\"  This had to be the most pretentious and canned answer I've ever received.  No shit freak'n Einstine!  We all get our coffee from all over the world.  So he proceeds to ramble off a list of countries that they get their coffee from:  \".... chiapas.... honduras.... indonesia....\"  I only picked up a few because he as talking very fast.  What I did figure out was was none of the origins he spoke of is really known for making good espresso beans.  Typically, African coffees provided the best flavor for espresso; but most of the time it's a blend of african and beans from everywhere.\r\n\r\nHe also mention that they do a \"East Coast roast which is different from what everyone else is doing in the City.\"  East Coast roast is also known as a cinnamon roast, which is a light roast.  A cinnamon roast is totally different from a espresso roast, which is a very dark roast.  You would never make espresso out of a cinnamon roast.  This explains alot.  If you use American coffee, also called milds for their flavor, you're not going to get alot of harshness or alot of peaks and valleys in your flavor profile.  So when you drink their latte, there's really nothing wrong with it, it's just very mellow, non-offensive.  \r\n\r\nOne more tidbit: you should never get coffee from someone who has the back of the espresso machine turned towards you.  You should be able to see exactly what they are doing.  That's a big minus for me.\r\n\r\nTo me, their coffee takes very little risks; there's nothing wrong with it, it's just missing alot of flavor which should be there to create a great cup of coffee.", "author": "Rick K."}

I think I am just going to stop drinking coffee in the US and save all my caffeine highs for trips to Europe. \nJust like every 'gourmet' coffee place, they over-roast the beans. I like to have just plain espresso and you can really taste that OD on the roasting in an espresso. I know they make all their pulls ristretto which I like IF THE BEANS ARE NOT BURNED, but again, ristretto at Blue Bottle just tastes like a charred log.\nI think people rave about this place bc SF so desperately wants a 'great coffee place' to call its own, and heck, the name Blue Bottle sounds cute and catchy and Americana or something or other, and whatever. \nThe beans are burned.\nAnd no dumb arguments about SF coffee being more smoky and whatnot. That is French Roast people, not espresso.\nAlso, the two times I tried cappuccino here, well, I got a latte just like every dumb coffee place in SF. It is not just 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk and 1/3 foam, all separate and stuff. The milk part has to be this kind of foamy milk melange that mixes a little w/ the espresso. Not bam, espresso up to here, then liquid milk up to here and the foam sitting on top. \n \nTake me to the Termini train station in Rome, the magazine stand near the platform that takes you to Paris. You can get the perfectestestest espresso in the world there for 90 cents. GOD SHOTS. \n\nI boycott American 'gourmet' coffee. If places like Blue Bottle would charge 90 cents instead of what $2 something for an espresso, then maybe I wouldn't complain.\n\nUPDATED:\nI got a message from someone who sent me info on BB's roasting processes. He was trying to explain that they don't burn their coffee. So it could be another reason why the espresso tastes charry:\n\nIt is possible then that they may not burn their coffee. The problem then might be that the baristas are letting the water be in contact too long with the espresso grinds. That could be a result of tamping way too hard or the grind being too fine. So the water sits too long, extracting all the *bad* unpleasant bitterness and masking the *good* coffee bitterness :o). Which becomes especially noticeable in a ristretto shot.\n\nI am not sure if they have one of those machines that grinds, dispenses and tamps automatically. If that is the case then the dispensing and tamping are probably consistent, and the fineness of the grind is the variable. The grind for espresso should be checked regularly (more than once a day) because weird things like humidity affect it. \n\nI worked in coffee for about 8 years and learned all of this interesting (boring) stuff hehe.", "author": "Jackie P."}

I don't want to admit that I have gotten used to fair-good cup of coffee, but  this is quickly confirmed when tasting Blue Bottle. It is amazing and has a flavor like no other coffee I have tried. Can I describe it? Not really but I can say it is worth the rain, the plane delays (compliments of Jet Blue) and the line at the small coffee counter. I used to believe that the coffee at Kings Road Cafe in Los Angeles was the best I have ever had, but now I am in love with Blue Bottle. New Yorkers love to hate California. I am not one of them.

The coffee has nice well-rounded flavour, not bitter or sour like starbucks - bleh!  Furthermore, the mocha was the best I have ever had.  It had a nice bittersweet, rich chocolate flavour, not chalky and overly sweet. The drinks had perfect creamy foam; for soy, if the baristas don't know what they are doing, the \"foam\" can be bubbly and unappetizing.  They also take the time to make a pretty leaf design where many coffee places don't take the time to do anymore - nice touch blue bottle!

Each drip coffee order is brewed individually, and their espresso drinks are amazing.  I especially like their mocha---good quality chocolate, and not too sweet.  Their New Orleans style iced coffee is also great when you're enjoying a rare warm day in the city.  They're tucked away on a little alley in Hayes Valley, but not to worry, they have a stand at the Ferry Building Farmers Market on Saturdays as well.  And their whole beans, roasted in small batches, are out of this world.  The line can get a little long, but it's totally worth the wait.", "author": "Leslie R."}

Three stars for their policy of toasting in small batches and no selling after 48 hours + donating the remainder. We bought half a pound of Giant Steps blend, let's see if my Brikka likes it.\nUPDATE: woowie! Giant Steps rules with my Bialetti!\nUPDATE2: EEEEWWWW!

It's obvious they know their regulars who obviously care that BB cares about them.\nThe coffee was very good, I thought. No bitterness, no gross aftertaste.

As a frequent customer (well. whenever I'm within a 20 block radius, I'll go), I've noticed the service vary. The quality of coffee doesn't change, but depending on the day and time of day your experience will vary. Baristas are very friendly most of the time, but there have been days where I've felt a bit snubbed by the service, so beware, but don't be too critical. If you were working and nobody bothered to tip or say thanks, wouldn't you be crabby?\n\nStill, doesn't affect the quality. \n____________________________________\n\nI accidentally discovered Blue Bottle. Sure, I'd heard it's name whispered among well-learned coffee connoisseurs, but never thought much of it- I mean, how much 'better' could coffee get? A latte at Starbucks and a latte here would still be espresso and steamed milk, right? Well, to be cliche, wrong. My first trip here was when I cut through an alley to get to a store in Hayes Valley and noticed the small shop. The open garage door, the skinny table outside and the incredible amount of people just waiting for their drinks drew me and and I found myself in front of a smiling barista, who seemed more than happy to make me a soy latte and a small square of lemon shortbread from Miette. I walked for another block before I looked at the latte in my hand, a slight white paper cup and a flower made of steamed milk looking back at me. I sipped, sipped, and sipped again, and found myself in what I can only describe as one of the single greatest love affairs of this century: the latte wasn't just a drink- it was a work of art, carefully brewed and poured with precision. It was nothing short of wonderful (except, well, I think it'd be really cool if instead of plain cups, there'd be a small blue bottle on the cup somewhere..but that's just aesthetics for me). The coffee is great too- flavorful and bold, without making your taste buds cringe. \n\nThe warm weather is coming so don't sell yourself short and say it's not 'coffee weather'. Their iced coffees are out of this world as well- phenomenal. Simply phenomenal.", "author": "Shelby C."}

I don't mind waiting on line, but when I get to the counter I expect what I ordered. Beware of putting a tip in their huge tip jar before you receive your coffee, you might want it back after they mess up your order and then get mad at you for asking for what you really ordered.

I try to not complain in reviews b/c I don't find it very helpful, but today I really need to comment.\n\nCoffee: Overall, very good, very fresh, very strong. I only tried the drip coffee; I'm curious how I might like a frothy specialty coffee. 3.5 stars for the coffee.  \n\nBaristas: Were overall professional, and after we asked why people who ordered after us were getting their lattes before us, they explained it takes longer for drip and apologized for the wait. \n\nAmbiance: I knew this was nothing more than a kiosk, so wasn't expecting much w.r.t. decor. But, from the moment we walked up, I felt uneasy and tense. The energy here on a Saturday morning was not good. The customers all seemed aggressive in a \"I-come-here-all-the-time-who-the-f*ck-are-you\" for this \"super hip awesome\" place...or maybe they were all in severe caffeine withdrawal. Like the yuppie couple behind me who kept pushing against me (I'm a yuppie too, but I still know about personal space and queue etiquette- like, back the f*ck off, lady), the odd woman who parked herself by the counter while drinking her coffee, to the man who walked up to the counter, w/o waiting in line, and wouldn't move so that my brother and I both had to reach over him to get our lids and sugar. All this culminated in a woman walking up to aforementioned man and yelling and calling him an \"inconsiderate asshole\" for hitting her car. Turns out she works at Blue Bottle! Niiiice.\n\nI understand now, after having read a bunch of the reviews, that there is clearly a sense of entitlement to this place. I'm new to SF and still exploring. I'm looking forward to the day I feel a similar sense of smugness for a local coffee place and have no qualms about being incredibly rude and inconsiderate to my fellow customers. \n\nWill I go back: Hmmm...maybe but not on a Saturday. I'm actually really interested in checking out the cafe with the $20k coffee machine that is supposed to create coffee from the heavens...", "author": "Anju P."}

We live on the peninsula and we drove up to find this place after reading about it on Televisionwithoutpity.com ....ok,ok ,we are dorks what can I say.My car does have a \"Nerd Pride\" sticker. My hubby ordered me a pound as a gift. We started having them deliver it and we are hooked. I just doubled our subscription as we run out every month and the Starbucks beans were just not as good. Their hook is that they deliver the beans within 24 hours of roasting and the aroma fills the whole mailbox when you open it up. The Hayes valley spot is literally a hole in the wall and parking is tough so I suggest having the beans mailed to you and I recommend the Chiapas", "author": "Sharon H."}

I stood in line behind some dude (who ordered up about all the inventory in the place) for about 5 minutes, impatiently checking my watch and looking over my shoulder back towards Gough, imagining that my unplugged meter was resulting in a ticket and an unintented $40+ capuchino. When I finally did get to the front and got my small cap, I was shaking with excitement (or maybe it was caffeine withdrawal). I saw that this place, in addition to the pelthora of 5 stars here, is rated #2 in the city on coffeeratings.com. My fave - Martha Brothers - is only #35 there, so I have lots of coffee drinking to do! So, I got the cap and was a little disheartened to find that there was no splenda, or any sweetener alternative. Just regular sugar. I decided to taste it sans sweetener. It really is a good cup. It didn't need sugar. It smells nice and is smooth and easy to drink. In the end, though, I missed the more \"roasty\" flavors I find in Martha's and even Progressive grounds (to a lesser extent). I agree with one of the reviewers below: Nothing wrong with this place, but it doesn't really stand out for me. There weren't any pastry items to speak of (except macaroons, which I don't call a pastry item, really), and the cup was $4 for a small. I won't be going out of my way to this location, but if they opened one closer to Bernal/Mission/Noe I may stop in from time to time.", "author": "Scott M."}

Being lactose intolerant (damn my Asian genes) however, I am forced to look for cafes that  can create a cappuccino with that perfect ratio of espresso to hot foamed milk.  Oh, and of course, it must be topped with velvety thick foam.  I've tried it numerous times myself and it always turns out with either too much lifeless foam on top or too little foam (let's just call it a shot of espresso).  SO, I give props to anyplace that can make a good cappuccino from soy milk.  This hole-in-the-wall is one of the few places I've found that makes a decent soy cappuccino.  The taste of the espresso is actually what made the capp good--intense dark caramel-like flavors danced in my mouth.  The foam on top was not as thick as I would have liked, but again, it is difficult to achieve this w/soy milk.  At least, my soy cappuccino resembled a regular cappuccino--having the same ending artisan touch of a pretty leaf design in the foam.  \n\nHow I miss the cafes in the bay area.

To taste the true quality of an arabica roast coffee..the simple straight espresso is the way to go.  If it's overly bitter or requires more than one and a half tsps of sugar to eliminate that bitterness it's not a great coffee as the acidity levels have gotten too high which could be caused by a variety of factors, a bad barrista or old coffee or overly roasted beans.  One can have a good or bad experience here.  I was not blown away or overwhelmed.  Hype is for the sheep, so be your own judge and listen to your taste buds not by the length of the line.
