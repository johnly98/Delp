There weren't many other customers but lots of staff available, yet it was a struggle to get their attention and help. Even asking for some water without ice took 20 minutes - we would see our waiter idly sitting at a far away table not helping out anyone. My boyfriend had to stand up, walk across the restaurant, and remind him to get us some water because he had forgotten about it. \n\nWe ended up splitting an order of beef pho between the two of us. When we tried it, I noticed it was very salty and mostly broth. In fact, the only flavor I could detect from the pho was salt - and a lot of it. There was hardly any meat and a subpar amount of noodles. \n\nNeedless to say, I was disappointed in our food and experience. I'm surprised this place has such high ratings despite our terrible experience here.

I actually ordered mine without the noodles, extra veggies instead, and they sure did deliver! Tons of shitakes and bok choi and broccoli, and the tofu is fried to firmness, not that soft boring stuff they usually add. Fresh toppings were your typical basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime. Each table is stocked with chop sticks and chili sauces, too, which is convenient. I dislike having to request them. \n\nPortions are so generous, I left stuffed, and still packed some to go.

One bowl looked big enough for my boyfriend and I. In our to-go order, we got Bun rieu and Bun Bo Hue. Bun bo hue was good. My boyfriend is vietnamese and he's actually from Hue so he knows what's up. So his biggest complaint is when bun bo hue is not served with the banana leaves. But that didn't bother him because he still finished it.\n\nThe Bun Rieu was for me and I love bun rieu. Flavor of broth was awesome and felt very homey, but the items in the bun rieu were not my favorite. It had an entire egg in there and didn't have the crab paste thing. Why?! That's what it's known for! However, the pork and shrimp and the stuff actually inside was delicious. The crab paste thing is what makes bun rieu, bun rieu. However, I know with these home dishes, every place has their own unique spin and recipe to it. \n\nBecause of this I took off one star; however I loved the people, the service, portion sizes, and the food!

I'm not even that into Viet food but I had seen this IG vid on how it was cooked and suddenly, I couldn't get it out of my head. Good thing R loves viet food, especially Pho. We got here around 8-ish PM, which is the sweet spot because that's when people start leaving and we got seated almost instantly. R got the beef pho (#5?) extra large and I got the Bun Rieu. We also got an order of the imperial rolls. The imperial rolls were super filling and we felt like we were already a quarter full! The noodles came out pretty quick. R's extra large was so big. But we later discovered that the amount of noodles in there is not too bad, just that there was a lot of broth. The bun rieu was awesome. One thing though-there literally is only 3 shrimps in here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-07", "description": "Let me start by saying they have the BEST bun rieu I've tried in a restaurant thus far. For $8.95 you get a generously sized bowl of hearty and flavorful tomato based broth filled with crab paste, tofu, shrimp, eggs, lettuce, mint leaves, and vermicelli noodles. Ughhh it was so perfect and hit all the right spots on a freezing winter night in San Francisco. \n\nMy friend ordered #6 - pho with sliced beef and tendon. I tried some, and it was equally as delicious! The broth was flavorful and not overly loaded in MSG.\n\nShe finished her bowl of pho first and watched as I slowly ingested each piping hot bite of my flavorgasmic bun rieu. I kept reminding her how much in heaven I was. While working on devouring my bowl in its entirety, the waiter comes up with the check and two fortune cookies. He asks if we are finished eating, to which I reply that I'm not done yet. Next, I see him pick up my plate of chili dipping sauce (\"hmm, what's he doing,\" I think to myself) and then.....*clank* the plate drops into my unfinished bowl of bun rieu. =000000000 connect those 0's and that's how my face probably looked.  Jaw. Dropped. Heart split into a million pieces. \n\n\"I...I said I wasn't done yet,\" I gasped. \n\nHis face had the literal expression of OH SH*T WHAT DID I JUST DO. \"I thought you said you were done...\" he replied.\n\n\"Oh, no... I said I was NOT done yet...\"\n\nHe looked at my bowl and I could see him thinking \"oh god what do I do. She didn't even have that much left, but I f'ed up :(\" He apologized and responded saying he would go ask the kitchen to make me another small bowl.\n\nI felt so bad! I told him that it was alright and that I didn't need the extra bowl. He rushed to the kitchen.\n\nHe then comes back with another fortune cookie and says that they are working on making me another bowl right away. By then, I was already set on not getting another bowl and asked if I could just get a discount on the check. Instead of giving me a discount, he takes the entire bun rieu off the bill! \n\nI was just in shock from the whole sequence of events. My dining experience went from pure bliss, to sudden heartbreak, to sympathizing, to utter disbelief and gratitude. 5 stars for the service and the food! Miscommunications happen. I totally understand. I'm 100% coming back to finish 100% of my next bowl of bun rieu there. ;)", "author": "Cheryl N."}

There's tasty fried tofu that soaks up the broth as well as a good selection of veggies (broccoli, bok choi, carros, mushrooms. Who knew broccoli would taste so good in pho). For the broth, you can even choose vegetarian, chicken, or beef for pseudo-vegetarians like myself. I thought the chicken broth could have used more flavor (my gold standard is Turtle Tower's pho ga) and it was borderline lukewarm (or maybe I just spent too much time taking food pictures and it cooled down). Overall it was satisfying and refreshing, and the topping of fried garlic added a nice touch.\n\n2) Their broken rice entree ($12) is essentially a sampler with 7 specialties, and it's a dish I've never seen at a restaurant before. One can scoff at the composition as a hodgepodge of miscellaneous items (or, as I've seen in another review, it's a peasant's dish of leftovers--hence broken rice--that ironically costs more here as a special). However I did appreciate the various textures and flavors, ranging from umami BBQ prawns and chicken, to the sweet shrimp-wrapped sugarcane, to crunchy classic imperial rolls. It also comes with an interesting egg thing (sort of like an omelette), a pile of shredded pork (reminiscent of sukiyaki), and a fried tofu skin roll (no idea what was in the filling but it was good). The concept reminded me of street food because you try bites of traditional, time-tested favorites. I can totally imagine myself nomming on a sugarcane shrimp on a stick while strolling in an open-air market. \n\nKim Son very local business-y--a homemade cooking style and a family-run vibe, the server was a very friendly lady who looked like she may be the owner.

It's just one of those things, you go because your friend could not get you into a better place as it was closed. As of late, I find, that people sometimes try to impress me, they would remove their hoodie to wear a proper coat, because \"you are stylish\", and I think it's becoming so prevalent that I feel like telling them to stop, as I have become a bit too self conscious with the way I dress. And then it's the food. They want to impress me with their food selection. I like novelty, oddity and rareness. Not once but twice varies friends have taken me to Cockscomb, and so many had suggested Trou Normand, but here is the thing, I like good food, but I like my companion more, despite how they are dressed or where we end up eating at.\n\nKim Son is an excellent place to demonstrate such concept. It is the perfect place to eat mediocre food with some of your closest or new friends. The restaurant is open at all hours, even on a Sunday afternoon it's crowded. It's a straight shot from Inner Richmond to Outer, meaning, you don't have to waste your brain cell to figure out how to get there, if you are coming from the lower avenues. \n\nFor food that is lackluster, it's fairy expensive, that part made me a bit uncomfortable and thus a reduction of rating. I'm perfectly good at shoving $20 for a good bowl of noodle soup, but a very typical pho is not worth the $9 they charge. It's just not that great. \n\nHere is the thing, if you really want to get a good bowl of pho, go to Oakland and San Jose, or stay in Inner Richmond, why bother with this joint? But sometimes we end up at a place because that's where we end up. We don't always control our immediate destiny, as you know. \n\nWe finished the food. T liked his just fine. I had taken more than half of mine to go. And we headed out to see the sunset. Wait, here is the silver lining, sunset on Ocean Beach from this place is one minute drive, and not ten if you are coming from Inner Richmond. And your companion, is as dashing as one could be for a man in the late 40s: slim and tall, jacket and jeans, dark rim glasses and a beanie. Which, by the way, in case you are wondering, is the mandatory look and standard attire for all male Midwestern transplanters of a certain age.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I'm just visiting this week, but have eaten here twice already.  Extremely fresh ingredients and delicious grilled meat and prawns.  The owners and waitstaff are so sweet and accommodating.  I ordered the grilled meat and prawns with all of the vegetables and mint that you wrap into your own spring rolls, but I also tried their fried rice and fried Spring rolls.  They too were  exquisite.  The fried rice was evidently prepared on a very hot wok, so had that almost charred flavor with very little oil that you can only accomplish on a very hot wok.  The spring rolls were delicious with a good portion of pork in them and a fresh made dipping sauce. \nI would come here at least once a week if I lived here.  \n\nI can't say enough about the genuine care the owners and staff put into this place. It's very admirable for people who were not born here to have made such a wonderful place to dine.

The bf likes his soup with a bit more shrimp paste, so feel free to ask them for a side of shrimp paste and add for your liking.  The serving size is generous and I have a hard time trying to finish my bowl.  \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Credit cards are accepted\n*The restaurant is clean, food comes out in good time, and the older workers are friendly\n*Variety of noodle soup dishes and a broken rice dish (a rare dish to find in SF)\n*Closed Thursdays\n*Street parking", "author": "Nicole S."}

We arrived at lunchtime 1pm on Saturday. All the tables were almost filled up. People were eating soup and clay pots which looked good. I ordered #25, the broken rice with two thin pieces pork chop bone in, baked egg with nice ingredients inside like glass noodles and looks like mushrooms? and shredded pork. And my friend ordered the lunch special with BBQ chicken, an imperial roll, salad and brown rice that comes with an interesting house soup with tofu and squash. I will go home and make a dish like that. It's a nice combination. \n\nWow, the BBQ chick was plump, soft and flavorful! I will need to come back and order the chicken!! My friend enjoyed her dish and said it was really a lot of food for one person. I enjoyed my broken rice dish, but it was hard to get used to the texture of the broken rice because it is very fine and grainy and very light. This is just my personal preference, but others may enjoy it. Everything else on my plate I enjoyed and was happy with my order. Yes, it was a lot of food for one person. Didn't leave much room for dessert, so had to walk around the block. My friend and I will definitely come back to this restaurant in the future for they have so many other dishes that looked good. Service was good and food came timely. :-)\n\nFunny to note that peasant rice dish (broken rice) costs more than regular rice. I was looking up what is broken rice. It is a lower grade rice made that way during cleaning when rice is harvested with not much nutrient value and makes rice it stickier.", "author": "Priscilla L."}

We ordered two pho gai tans and one order of imperial rolls. The portions are HUGE and I love it. Pho is served with a plate of toppings on the side (basil, jalape\u00f1os, lime, and sprouts). One of my main test for good pho is the flavor of the broth. This broth was great! My only complaints about the food was that the meat in the pho was sliced thicker than I'm accustomed to and was a bit over cooked. The imperial rolls also weren't as crispy as I liked but the filling was great. \n\nWhat I especially appreciated about this place was the service! We were served very quickly, our water glasses were refilled 3 times (very uncommon to ever get a refill on the east coast) and the owner was SO SWEET! Because we arrived so late we ended up being the last ones left eating in the restaurant as he was trying to close up.

The older servers are always very polite + attentive, but the younger wait staff can be quite rude.\n\nThat being said, Kim Son's food makes up for it. They have one of the more extensive Vietnamese menus in the city, with rice plates, noodle soups, stir fries, and plenty of seafood dishes. Food can sometimes take a bit to come out (~15-20 minutes if they're really busy) but it really is worth it.\n\nI like ordering the Hu Tieu Nam Vang, the Bun Rieu, or the Seafood Pho on a cold day. \n\nIt's very clean inside and plenty of seating.", "author": "Lauren C."}

Not that I'm the only one it seems - my friends didn't know it was called Kim Son either until we walked in.  But hey, it's not the worst way to be known, especially considering how many people go to Purple Kow.  Plus, it's better to be known of than not to be known at all!\n\nAs far as the food goes, I thought everything I tried was just okay.  The IMPERIAL ROLLS my friend and I shared looked great on the plate and were perfectly crispy.  However, the taste was pretty typical, for better or worse.  Hard to get excited when it tastes the same as everywhere else!  Plus points for how the order included some vermicelli noodles though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kim-son-vietnamese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=PVLnCtRAe3ohteKqsXLZCw#QUJ7HqOazs_TUd5wS2bR4Q).\n\nSimilarly, my bowl of PHO TAI GAN (Beef Pho with Rare Steak and Tendon) didn't make much of an impression either (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kim-son-vietnamese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=PVLnCtRAe3ohteKqsXLZCw#-MSrW39w4yLPfSQIwG9wQw).  The broth had some decent flavor to it, but it felt a little greasy/oily to me.  Still not bad though, and not as big of an issue for me as how light on meat and noodles my order was.  Maybe the size of the bowl made the portions seem smaller than it really was, but it seemed like there was a disproportionate amount of soup to the good stuff dropped in.\n\nAlthough the food wasn't super amazing, it's nice how everything came out fast and was priced so friendly.  Kim Son may not be a place I set out to eat at again (parking can be tough at times), but they aren't a bad choice if you're in the area...or if you're looking to grab something to eat before/after a trip to Purple Kow.  You know, that place next to Kim Son.", "author": "Mike L."}

Ordered two number threes which is the Chin Nam aka sliced well-done beef flank (no tripe).  The broth was oily and not clean of fats and oil.  Taste-wise it was not great.  The noodles were limited and the actual beef was five pieces.  The beef quality was low.  There was significant gristle and cartilage which should not be the case for this dish.  We eat pho on a weekly basis throughout the Bay Area traveling all the way to the South Bay and this pho was unimpressive. \n\nADVANTAGES :\n+ Quick seating despite being full.\n+ Prompt service and polite staff.\n+ Quick turn around for to-go orders.\n\nDISADVANTAGES :\n- Soup broth was not good.\n- Low grade meats used.\n- Very small portions. Do not go if you have a good appetite.\n- Parking on Balboa is limited due to Purple Cow and Balboa Theater.\n\nTIPS:\n+ If you must visit park towards 38th Avenue and circle the adjacent streets for parking.\n+ If you can handle a quick bus or drive in SF consider visiting Good Noodle Restaurant at 239 Clement between 3rd and 4th Avenues.  The food quality is better and portions are far more generous.\n\nYour mileage may vary. Good luck!", "author": "Teddy .."}

During my most recent experience, I came here with a couple of friends for dinner on a Sunday night.  It was not too crowded, and the hostess told us to sit wherever we liked.  I ordered the pho with bbq chicken. \n\nThe food came out quickly.   The pho was at best, mediocre.  The MSG leaves you exceptionally thirsty for water.  The bbq chicken, which was served on a separate plate was moist and full of flavor.  However, I will have to subtract a star for the presentation of the dish.  There were two pieces of feather still left on the cut of chicken about the size of a paperclip.  It was not attractive to look at.  It is a shame, because it was quite good.  Another factor for the low rating would be the temperature of the chicken.  It was served at room temperature.  \n\nAfter we were done eating, as tradition, we played credit card roulette to determine who would be paying for the meal.  +1 additional star because I did not have to make my wallet sad.    :)\n\nI would be willing to give this place another chance.

But they were super courteous and warm. Here's one absolute thing to note: none of the Vietnamese people I saw in there at the time were having Kim Son's noodle soups. I also found their noodle soups on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nI ordered the Bun Rieu, the SO went with the regular pho. While the beef pho's soup was flavorful, it lacked the punch of a good soup base. It didn't have that long drawn out flavor, it was much too light and only good enough. Barely formidable against the pho noodles, which completely drained out the taste.\n\nMy Bun Rieu? Was relatively laughable. It was bland and I felt like I was putting it away, just to be putting it away. The SO didn't think so poorly of it but I guess growing up in a Vietnamese family changes my palette.\n\nThe BBQ spring roll was actually really good. The meat was perfectly cooked and the sauce complemented it endlessly. It was one of the best BBQed meats I have ever had.\n\nAs far as noodle soups go, I probably won't be interested again. I might come back to have a sit-down family dinner if I ever come back, it looked delicious when the table next to us received all of their food but if I had a pho craving... I might just have to sit it out.", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

The chunks of egg and fried tofu was something I'm not used to in my bun rieu either. Maybe they use it to distract you from how mediocre the soup base is?

Does this explain the clientele that dines here?? \n\nSpecial here is their Broken Rice:\nCm tm, or broken rice, is a Vietnamese dish made from rice with fractured rice grains. It is usually served with grilled pork (either ribs or shredded) plus the Vietnamese dish b\u00ec (thinly shredded pork mixed with cooked and thinly shredded pork skin) over broken rice. The rice and meat are served with various greens and pickled vegetables, along with a prawn paste cake, trng hp (steamed egg), and grilled prawns. Typically, restaurants will serve this popular combination rice plate with a small bowl of nc chm, as well as a small bowl of soup broth (canh) with garlic chives (to cleanse the throat). The dish cm tm b\u00ec comes with a ch trng egg meatloaf. The main ingredient, broken rice, is a traditionally cheaper grade of rice produced by damage in milling. Broken rice has a lower fiber and nutrient content, but generally has a similar energy content to intact rice.\n\nDishes are more expensive that what I'm used to paying for Vietnamese and I found my pork chops to be a bit tough. I've definitely had more flavorful and tender pork elsewhere. First time to try crispy Vietnamese noodles -- definitely different from HK pan fried noodles (same concept though). Don't think I'd come back. Sorry yelpers.", "author": "Cathrin P C."}

Kim Son is pretty outer Richmond and was kind of a trek, but I was drawn by the yelp photos of Bun rieu.\n\nWe started with imperial rolls, which have the more bumpy crunchy fried outside.  These were freshly fried, super juicy, well seasoned, and of course amazing with fish sauce.  Warning - they are VERY hot.\n\nI got the bun rieu, which is supposed to be a crab paste tomato noodle soup.  It was more tomato dominant.  I think the traditional way should be more of a crab-egg-pork ball, but there wasn't as much crab in this one as I had hoped.  I think I actually preferred the noodles more in the #1 (traditional beef pho).  The pho was a HUGE bowl - like the kind for an eating challenge.  The broth was well seasoned without being too oily.  I also liked that the garnish included not only bean sprouts but also thinly sliced cabbage.\n\nThey were very nice about refilling water.  Food comes out quickly.

I thought it was done with a lots of flavors. \n* Bun Bo Hue (4 of 5) I also quite enjoyed this noodle soup. It had a nice lemon grass spicy taste to it.\n* Combo Rice Plate-shrimp wrapped sugar cane, imperial roll, shrimp cake, bbq chicken, baked egg, bbq shrimp, shredded pork (3 of 5) Lots of choices and huge plate, but overall most of the choices were only ok tasting. The shrimp wrapped over sugar cane was a little dry. The imperial roll was a little soft in the middle, not sure what happened there. The shrimp cake was only ok. The BBQ chicken was very juicy and soft. I think this was probably the best cooked dish on the combo rice plate. The baked egg was very mellow tasting and I didn't think I liked it too much. I skipped the bbq shrimp, but the plate came with three pieces. Lastly, the shredded pork tasted ok. The dish looks impressive, but individually each piece is only so-so.\n* #1 Pho (4 of 5) Not bad of pho. Really big soup bowl and medium amount of noodle. There is definitely a lot of soup. Everything was fairly tasty. I think the soup was a little sweeter than other places I have been to.\n\nOverall, I would go back to this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-18", "description": "I visited this restaurant on the recommendation of friends.  It was a cold, windy Friday night when I was there and as soon as I walked in the first thing I noticed was other patrons enjoying huge bowls of pho.  It was the perfect night for hot noodle soup.  The waiter greeted me and we backtracked to a table in a corner nook at the front of the restaurant.  I opened the menu to discover a vast selection of noodle soups, rice plates, noodle dishes, appetizers and a la carte choices.\n\nOn both side walls there are dry erase boards with daily specials and brief descriptions written on them.  I must admit that the waiter's service was not ideal as he chose to wait on two tables who had entered the restaurant after I had entered seemingly because their faces were more familiar to him.  It would seem like he sat me in the corner so he could forget about me.  Ignored, I finally flagged down another waitress who in return gestured to the waiter and said something to him (not audible to me).  I believe it is a husband / wife team that waits on the tables.  The waiter returned to my table, apologized and asked if he could take my order.\n\nI knew the menu pretty well by this time, and I might have been a bit grouchy too because I was hungry.  I ordered the Fried Prawn Rolls appetizer from the specials board and the Pho Bo Ko, beef stew with noodle soup.  Since I didn't get any hot tea I ordered a canned soft drink to quench my thirst.  The waiter brought a plate of pho accompaniments (bean sprouts, jalapenos, fresh basil and a piece of lime) immediately along with a canned soda and a tall glass with ice.  He even popped open the can and poured the soda for me.\n\nThe kitchen works fairly fast as food arrived a short time later starting with the Fried Prawn Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C7e1ZvLk-X3vGmZj5fuUAQ?select=-XpjMba2tlmEYZKUGJRK6A).  These were tail-on shrimp combined with a pork and seafood paste then wrapped in layers of scallions and basil leaves and wrapped again in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried.  The result was a crispy sensation of shrimp, creamy scallion and basil.  The taste of the meat paste was kind of lost next to the basil but these were delicious nonetheless.  These came served with pickled carrots, daikon and scallions (very good) and a chili sweet and sour sauce that was more sweet than it was hot.\n\nThe Pho Bo Kho (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C7e1ZvLk-X3vGmZj5fuUAQ?select=BozMllpEuOaeGOa9zFVucg) arrived as I was enjoying my crispy appetizers.  I love Asian beef stew and Kim Son's is very good.  The meat was simmered long and had absorbed much of the flavors of the seasonings.  The meat was extremely tender too.   There was a good assortment of meaty pieces combined with fatty pieces but no tendons.  I'm not a huge fan of the tendons anyway so this was perfect.  There were two huge pieces of soft, simmered carrot and the amount of soft rice noodles in the bottom of the bowl was very generous, and the thick, brown broth was rich and full flavored.  I even tasted some star anise in the broth.  The beef stew noodle soup was excellent.\n\nThe service started out poorly but improved quite a bit after that.  Judging by the foot traffic this is a very popular Friday night eat spot as folks were still coming in and seated after the posted closing time.  The foods I tried were delicious, and if I'm ever in this part of the City again I won't hesitate to go back.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

However, with a new job in the horizon and an upcoming move to a part of California where Panda Express will be the only Asian food in sight, even the \"boonies\" are looking pretty appealing to me nowadays. So, with easy access to Asian cuisine soon to be a distant memory, I've been risking my health to gorge on as much of it as possible while it's still a viable option. Incidentally, Kim Son was the first stop in my little venture. \n\nI LOVE Bun Rieu and the one served up at Kim Son is no exception. If I had a Vietnamese mother/grandmother, this is what I imagine their home cooking would taste like. Hearty and full of flavor....who knew crab paste and tomato could create such a delicious medley of flavor?! I'm loving the fried tofu cubes and shrimp that's added in too. Also, make sure you come hungry because portions are outrageously large. For roughly $10, I left with a full belly and enough money to still get a boba at Purple Kow (don't know if that's actually saying much though considering it's only $3 and some change). \n\nThey do have a $10 credit card minimum, and while it's technically illegal for any establishment to enforce one, I've never had the balls to question a minimum just yet. However, given the friendly and attentive service that Kim Son offers, I'd feel bad about choosing them as the place to start. \n\nMy only regret is that I didn't discover this delightful spot sooner.

The broth is beefy with a lovely depth and balance of spices.  I didn't think it was overloaded with MSG, though I'm not that sensitive to MSG (Since I'm Chinese, I grew up with MSG).  All of the cuts of beef were delicious, including the very tender, silky tendon, beef balls, thin shreds of tripe, thin slices of beef, etc.  I liked adding the fresh jalapenos and their pickled jalapeno slices, along with the fresh bean sprouts and fresh basil.  \n\nMinor flaws: The rice noodles were a little too soft and they gave me a wedge of lemon (I prefer lime).\n\nIt's not a fancy place but it feels clean.

I even came back a week later to dine in and ordered pho, imperial rolls and a thai tea. The food looked delicious and tasted good but as I was sipping on my Thai Tea, I noticed something dark, swirling in my drink. I gave it many glances and realized that it was a cockroach looking bug with wings, dead in my drink! I immediately called them over to take the drink away and they brought out a new one. There was no sense of urgency or apology from the staff though, and when she brought out the new one, I asked if I can redeem the drink for free since there was a bug. She said okay but I don't think she understood what I meant. I finished what I could of my food and asked for the bill. The Thai Tea was still on there and when asked how come I was still being charged... they said they gave me the drink with the bug for free... but still have to charge me for the new one! This made no sense to me. I was not too happy about that and explained that I shouldn't have to pay for the drink with the bug in the first place and the manager said if I don't pay then he loses money on the drinks...I didn't want to argue so gave them my credit card. And then I noticed kitchen staff from the back came out and peeked at me, probably because they knew I wasn't happy and there was a bunch of chatter behind me...that made me feel very uncomfortable. 2 minutes later the manager came and told me he voided the first transaction and I won't have to pay for the tea.

She'll run through torrential rain, wind that painfully blasts sand over your body (free apricot scrub!), and through nipple hardening, snot inducing weather.\n\nAfter a particularly difficult run along Ocean Beach where it felt like Kim Jong Il was testing a new freeze death ray on us, the only thing that got us to the finish line was the thought of hot food. I told her about Kim Son, but warned: No PHO!\n\nPatra: What? I can order Pho if I want. Pho Shizzle!\n\nMe: You can't order a Pho-king thing unless I say! So sit down, Jennifer! \n\nPatra: *raises fist* What did you call me? This place better be Pho-tastic, or else you'll be eating a knuckle sandwich!\n\nMe: Does that come with Oyster sauce?\n\nPatra: *PUNCH*\n\nMe: Ow, sheesh, fine... Trust me, it'll be good.\n\nIt didn't go exactly like that since Patra B's easy going, but we ended up at Kim Son, nonetheless.\n\nNestled in the outer Richmond, Kim Son is one of the BEST Vietnamese places in the city, hands down. It's so damn good, you don't even need to eat the Pho to get a fantastic meal, which was my challenge. Don't get me wrong, the Pho is EXCELLENT and sized huge as well.\n\nWe order Lemon Beef to start, which is completely raw, topped with lemons, onions, (the acidity \"cooks\" the meat) and fried sweet garlic http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uhsxCM-63ZhDIgvZFsDcvw/l It is simply delicious, comes out quickly (minimal prep time), and healthy to boot.\n\nThen we got my personal favorite, the special combination appetizer, which comes with prawns (sometimes), shrimp over sugarcane, grilled pork, fried egg rolls, noodles with peanuts on top, and pickled veggies and lettuce so you can make your own wrap http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/D07vcehiTpZ0fn7eCNelGw/l They also give you rice wrappers that you dip in water to soften, so you can make a roll, as well. Dunked in the cups of fish sauce they provide, and you can make as many combos as your heart desires. This is not a meal for the weak and timid and will induce food coma if eaten correctly.\n\nSo to fight the coma, we also had their drip coffee http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/e3tZIk1ppOesU4nb3NYOJQ/l . Tasty, sweet, not too heavy. \n\nAt the end, the beef salad came out http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/GPXMqo3neqEo24n0-0DPrg/l but we were pretty damn full by then. The beef salad is shredded lettuce, carrots, and greens, sliced beef, and covered in fried garlic. They add mint for an occasional flavor explosion. After eating this, I scoff at Western salads. *Throws head back and laughs*\n\nBy the time we finished (yes, we ate it all cuz we're oinkers), I felt so good I knew I could walk up to a miniature golf course and hit the ball through the windmill. On the first try.\n\nYes, Kim Son makes you feel that good. And Patra? You can try the Pho now.", "author": "Jason C."}

The egg rolls were nice and crispy, but eat with caution or you'll burn your tongue...they're hot inside!  They give you the veggie platter and rice paper wraps, so it helps to balance out all the fried stuff....or that's what I tell myself.

I ordered a large once, and ended up sweating and having to adjust my belt trying to finish it.  After that first time, I go with the regular sized bowls.  The pho and ingredients are pretty good.  The broth is good, especially if it just prefer brothy without any lip-smacking goodness like with stock made lots of tendons, bones, etc.  If you order a bowl with rare beef in it, you can ask for the rare beef on a sideplate for $1.  It's like pho and shabu shabu in the same visit!\n\nService is decent, and for the price, it's fairly good.  One gripe is they give you one napkin unless you ask for more...a practice which irks me because they have disposable paper table mats!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "A solid three stars; after speaking with Kate V. last week over her methods of reviewing restaurants/etc., I decided I would put her method to use. Basically, instead of writing a review right after the initial visit to a new place, I waited to try the place again before I could get a full grasp of the atmosphere/value/etc.\n\nThis is what I did with Kim Son; I first came here last Saturday (not so long ago, I know), mainly because I was out hunting around for wonton noodle soup per my dad's request (apparently, Taishanese people eat noodle soup on their birthday because noodles symbolize longevity/long life). I wanted to find a place in my neighborhood, and Shanghai Dumpling King was super busy/not worth the wait that day. So I walked around a little more and stumbled upon Kim Son; looked at the menu outside, and found what I was looking for. I went inside and ordered my wonton noodle soup.\n\nFirst impression: well, the place was packed for a Saturday afternoon, which I wasn't too surprised about. The place appears to be family run,  with the younger members of the family being the servers on the weekends. Decoration is bare-bones/not overly fancy, but I don't think that's what they want to play up to draw in customers. Overall, the feeling I had last Saturday was that the place was very family-friendly and more concerned with catering to locals.\n\nI received my wonton noodle soup quickly; took my time in eating it. The place emptied out relatively quickly (within a half hour or so) as people shuffled on out to enjoy the gloriously sunny day. Nothing seemed super special about the wonton noodle soup: it had wontons, it had noodles....not like I had never eaten either before.\n\nYesterday, i went back to Kim Son to try something a little different. I was turned off by how unfriendly the first server was to me when I entered...not sure if she found it irritating that I didn't seat myself (I didn't see a sign saying \"Please Seat Yourself\", plus, on Saturday I was seated by one of the other servers anyway). \n\nI ordered the #36 Bun Nem Nuong (BBQ meatballs with vermicelli and fish sauce); portion was HUGE as expected. They were generous with the meatballs in the dish; throughout the whole time I was there, I felt like the server wasn't too friendly to me, which turned me off a little more. Hey, I'm sorry if I'm not one of those locals who comes around often...but if you want me to become a returning customer, could you at least treat me a little better? I noticed she was fine with all the other customers, which further made me feel like I wasn't being treated fairly. Sigh.\n\nThe price of the food is average for dinner; the lunch special prices/deals seem good though, and they're in effect all week (Monday through Sunday) from 11-3. \n\nOverall, Kim Son is okay. I may or may not come back, depending on how I feel in testing the server's attitude towards me again.", "author": "Helene K."}

Slurping up my dish, fatty here gets the food sweats and slight burn on the tongue (yes it was that delicious). You can typically nom on some bean curd cubes and find the occasional crab paste (couldn't tell if it was shrimp paste). I wished there were pieces of pigs blood/blood cubes but I guess we can't get everything we want *cries*. \n\nTheir Pho Ga (Chicken) was mediocre tasting and the broth looked and almost tasted like beef broth. Now it could be because I was still slightly ill, and my taste buds were out of whack. The cuts of chicken were tender and the noodles were nothing to rave about being a typical vermicelli noodles. \n\nOverall I think this will be the go to place for Vietnamese food if you're in the area, however there are plenty of restaurants in the city that offer better food. Interior is nice and the restrooms are just toilets with the sink outside which is a convenience. Staff is really nice and welcoming, and will take the time to describe their menu for those who never really had Vietnamese food (saw it first hand with another table).

Kams used to be large and took up both this store and the one next door.  I at there many years ago.   When I walked in, I was surprised it was no longer Kams Restaurant.  In fact, I just walked into the other half of what used to be Kam's Restaurant.  It's now a Vietnamese Pho restaurant.  No big deal since I was eating there with a bunch of friend.  So I ordered the \"Number 1 Pho\".  It's the only bowl of noodles I tend to get every time I walk into a Pho Restaurant.  And I've had my fair share of Pho #1 so I know what I'm talking about.  When I got the bowl of noodles, it consisted less noodles than all the other restaurants I've been to.  I've asked for the #1 Pho and large.  But when I got it, the bowl was the same size, the soup was the same amount, but the noodles were less.  From the get go, I've used my chopstick and spoon and was able to scoop with all the noodles in one scoop.  It was the side of about a little more than a baseball.  Not much at all. Usually when I eat the #1 Pho, I'm sull when I'm done.  This time at this restaurant, I left still hungry.  So I know they give you less noodles.  On top of that, the Pho soup didn't taste as good.  Like watered down soup.  Just not tasty like all the other Pho soup I've had.\n\nAlso, my friend had a clay pot rice bowl.  One of those rice dishes served in a clay pot because when food it cooked in a clay pot, it taste better.  You get that \"rice cookie\" on the bottom of the clay pot.  To our surprise, the rice dish that was in the clay pot wasn't cooked with the clay pot.  They may have served it in a clay pot with a cover and the clay pot is a little hot, but it's not cooked in it.  The rice was cooked with a rice cooker and the food was cooked in a wok, then all placed inside the clay pot to look like it was cooked in it.  Disappointment and fake. No taste again.\n\nWhen we asked for out check, they give us a wrong bill.  With three people eating, I respected to pay around $30.  But when the bill came, it was $75.  WFT!  So I asked them why so high.  Turns out, they gave us the wrong bill and laughed about it.  So we got the correct bill.  What if I didn't asked about the bill and they didn't say anything after I paid the $75.  That wouldn't be good.\n\nThis was my first time eating here.  The food wasn't nasty, just not good.  The service was okay.  If the food was better and didn't skim out, I would give it a 4 star.  But for the lack of taste, the face clay pot, and lack of noodles, I'm giving it 2.", "author": "Jack L."}

You'd think that would give you some sort of guarantee for good cooking, but it didn't. All the dishes were probably pre-cooked and delayed because guests were arriving late from out-of-town, but that's still no excuse.\n\nWe had about 10 dishes, and all of them were average at best and mediocre at worst. The fried calamari (muc chien don) appetizer had a lot of batter and lacked the substantial chewiness of good squid. The clay pot catfish (ca kho to) was pretty good, but anything that's so sweet has to be. The salt & pepper prawns (tom rang muoi) were not plump and flavored with a too-sweet sauce (perhaps the wrong dish even). Most of all, the salt & pepper crab (cua rang muoi) was thoroughly disappointing - lacking in breadth and dry. I suppose that the barbecued beef (bo nuong) was good, based on table commentary, but I didn't actually have any since everyone else snatched it up.\n\nI did leave full, and I guess the service was alright, but the food (none of which was pho, by the way) just seems to be prepared poorly and from low-quality ingredients.

Anyway, the bun rieu was one of the best noodle soups I've had in a while, and it really hit the spot on a gloomy evening. The tomato-y broth felt comforting, and the crab meat paste was delicious. After I tried my bf's broth mine tasted bland in comparison, since his was so spicy. Honestly either way you can't go wrong with the broth. I still don't feel like the pho was that amazing, but according to some Vietnamese friends of mine it's some of the best in the city, so maybe my taste is unrefined? Either way, this experience shows me that I should branch out and try more entrees at Vietnamese restaurants.", "author": "Jacqueline K."}

It's been years since I've been back and decided to try it out again.\nI came here on a sunday, no wait, ordered a different dish instead of the 5/7items rice plate (by the way is good as i usually order that dish). I decided to order bun bo hue (BBH) as i was craving it. Also got the 3 color drink and raw beef salad. The 3 color drink was just ok, not enough goodies or ingredients inside, still ok though. The raw beef salad did not look appealing, the beef looked really pale, lots of lemon slices to try to beautify the dish but the taste was just ok too, mediocre. There was ample of onion and garlic though. The noodle dish (BBH) i ordered also didnt look appealing, does not look like a typical BBH dish, does not smell spicy at all. After i taste test it, i was deeply disappointed. Flavor was bland, watery and very differ from the BBH im used to eating. I even added a lot of peppers to try to increase the flavor, but in the end, I'm still left unsatisfied.\nOverall i will only order the rice plates, dont order the bun bo hue!", "author": "Hao B."}

Because they know how to serve vegetarians (not that I am one), but I try to make it my daily goal to eat as many vegetables as I possibly can. And honestly, this place serves you a LOT of vegetables on your plate / bowl. This is the main reason why I have come to love this place. Many restaurants don't do that. They don't fill up your plate with vegetables. Some places fill it up with so much rice / noodles, and just a few pieces of vegetables.

I just can't get enough of chinese sausage, shrimp, and chicken with rice that is baked onto the clay of the pot it is steamed in. But I don't get any of that baked on goodness here because they don't actually bake the dish in a clay pot; rather, they just dump the ingredients over steamed rice. Totally not a clay pot. I could deal with that, though. What I can't deal with it the consistent ignoring of my request for no ginger. What is it about \"no ginger\" that is difficult to understand? For the third time today, I opened my steaming ingredients over rice clay pot wannabe and bit right into a strand of, what else, GINGER! So then I had to go through and try to pick out every last strand of it.

The number six pho soup with beef and tendon is very satisfying, and with ample fixings of fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, a healthy dip of Sriracha and hoisin sauce, you've got yourself a great soup.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is small and quaint and the wait staff are all courteous and efficient, always allowing a small group to sit anywhere you'd like.  I think I may have ordered a beer here long ago, but don't quote me - I usually go for some Thai iced tea to break up the salty goodness of my bowl of pho.  Great place", "author": "Lewis M."}

I think it stems back to my childhood. When I lived in Hong Kong I ate things that scared me. Everyone else seemed to be enjoying these strange things with fat and bones and blood (oh my!!) but I was not getting into it at all! Maybe I am too white, because even though I consider myself to be an adventurous eater, there are some things that are just not good to me in Asian cuisine. So, when my Vietnamese friend wanted me to have the \"real\" Pho experience some years back and ordered me something that had all of these elements, I had flashbacks and was not okay! Since then I always order the Pho with rare beef....its safe, and I like it. \n\nBecause of this I am easily able to compare the same dish at different restaurants. The Pho here is not bad at all. I would say it was okay before the change of ownership but has improved greatly since then. The service, on the other hand, is the worst ever!!!  We had our order taken, got our soup, and never saw a worker again until we yelled to the back for our bill...and there were NO OTHER CUSTOMERS AT THE TIME.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-21", "description": "YO HO HO and a BOWL o' PHO!\r\n\r\nActually that doesn't quite rhyme, because I'm told 'pho' is actually pronounced more like 'fuh' with a little inflection.  So why isn't it spelled 'fuh,' you ask?  It's simple, my friends:  who would want to sit down to a steaming hot bowl of FUH?  NO ONE!  FUHGETABOUTIT!\r\n\r\nSo 'pho' it is, the classic SE Asian rice noodle soup that is fast becoming ubiquitous.  Alas, good pho seems hard to find, and after dining at Kim Son I regret to say I will have to keep looking.\r\n\r\nMind you, it's not bad, and it looked like Kim Son had a wide array of interesting Vietnamese dishes to try, but if you're looking for the best pho in SF, move on.\r\n\r\nMy pho was served with the traditional tasty accompaniments of lemon wedges, thai basil, sliced hot pepper, and bean sprouts.  So far so good.  I ordered Pho Tai Nam (pho with sliced eye of round beef and flank steak), which is only slightly more adventurous than the ultra-banal (not that that's a bad thing) Pho Tai (pho with sliced eye of round beef).\r\n\r\nThe bowl was jam-packed with a heaping wad of rice noodles, so no one can accuse Kim Son of skimping.  Or can they?  I poked around looking for my meat, but I could only find a couple slices of each kind.  So I rationed it out, wolfing down mouthfuls of noodles with a few nibbles of meat slathered in delicious Sriracha (the red sweet spicy sauce).  Just as I was winding down and filling up, I swirled the broth with my chopsticks and--lo and behold!--a treasure trove of meat was malingering on the bottom of my bowl.  Chagrined, I stuffed in as much as I could, but by then it was too late.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most crucial pho component is the broth, and this is where Kim Son did not impress.  It just wasn't tasty or savory.  I like a broth that is rich and complex, with lots of cilantro, onion, and so on, and this wasn't it.\r\n\r\nOn the up side, the Thai iced tea was appropriately served, with strong home-brewed tea on the bottom of a fountain glass with a generous portion of sweet condensed milk on top, just waiting for your swirling pleasure.  Sometimes it's premixed and poured right out of a bottle, and that's no good at all.\r\n\r\nOh--the SERVICE!  How can I forget the service?  This was the most, uh, memorable part.  I went at 7:30 on Friday night, and the little place was rockin'.  Nary an empty table, with people waiting at the door.  The poor staff (I'm guessing extended family) just wasn't up to the challenge.  It took a long time to get a menu, a long time to get served, and a long time to get my check.  They were curteous and apologetic, which was appreciated, but swift service would be better.", "author": "John D."}

My friend decided to do the same, plus #49, Cha gio $5.95.\n\nThe food was pretty fresh and satisfying overall and the service was adequate, but it didn't include pork blood like My Canh (on Broadway) and my bowl was full of what I affectionately call \"the clear things\" (tendons).  I hate that stuff.  Plus I did not like the imperial rolls as much as Golden Flower's (on Jackson Street).  These folks didn't even cut the rolls in half.  zzzzz  No VIP service for me tonight. I can imagine someone with poor chopstick skills trying to break one of these very crispy rolls in half.  Bam! It goes flying off the table.  On the upside, I'm not nearly as thirsty as I usually am after downing a phat bowl of pho.  So either these guys do not use MSG, or other pho places use alot of MSG, ...or both?  :P\n\nAfter we finish eating, my friend tells me about how he couldn't immediately find the light switch in the restroom.  He figures, oh, this must have one of those clapper things.  So he claps his hands several times to find that the lights still do not come on and he's looking more and more like a fool. HAHAHA  He turns around to notice the switch behind him near the door knob.  HAHAHAHA  (see my pic)  As for my story, hmm... Let's just say, it's a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly before using the toilet (if you are a male) if you like to break up the jalapeno peppers into your soup with your hands as I do.  :P\n\nPretty decent place overall.

We were seated immediately, served hot tea, and the waitress took our orders.  The food came quickly, and they gave us a big plate of sprouts, basil leaves, and limes for 6 hungry people.  Everyone, except for me, ordered noodle soup.  And for the first time ever that I've seen, they bring the cooked meat and shrimp out to you on a side plate, instead of it already in the soup.  After your big bowl of noodle arrives you drench the meat in, add the sprouts/lime/basil and all the other goodies.   Being the person-who-always-regret-what-she-orders, I felt kinda lonely being the only one who got the B.B.Q beef over rice.

I already had one bad experience with pho in the Inner Sunset at Perilla so I was looking for something better. My friend lives in the Richmond, we were cold, starving and hungover. So after walking along Balboa looking at EVERY menu in the window for vegan pho, I decided to eat at Kim Son. Both of my friends weren't Vietnamese so they didn't know the difference between good and bad pho. I went in with not so high expectations though. Turns out they had a few vegan options! One of my friends ordered beef pho but didn't realize it was raw beef. So he didn't like it much and after eating it said he would have rather had a vegan bowl of pho as well. I ordered one vegan pho and one bun cha gio chay (eggrolls with noodles and salad) for my friend and I to split. He was overwhelmed at the portion size so I ate way more than half of it all but I didn't mind because it was delicious.

So many places fail in not having the oil hot enough, making the rolls very greasy and arrive in a pool of oil atop some lettuce.\n\nI've also had the steak salad which is ok, just but be sure to share it with someone, it's huge.  The seafood on crispy noodles is yummy as is the seafood chow fun and the seafood pho...hmm I guess I like the seafood.  The shrimp in clay pot is delicious but skip the catfish in clay pot - too much work in picking out the bones.  \n\nTony loves the sugar cane shrimp with vermicelli.  Cameron orders the BBQ pork chop combo EVERY time he eats there.  It's really a great deal because you get soup, a generous portion of pork chops, rice, salad with a shrimp and an Imperial roll, all for $7 - hard to beat.\nJames has tried both of the fried fish and likes both but prefers the one with the ginger sauce.  \n\nTry it - you might like it!", "author": "April F."}

I haven't tried anything else here, but broth is very clean and light, the vegetables are fresh and their BBQ pork is good. The place looks a little bit like a dive, but nonetheless its clean inside, not too expensive, and definitely not trendy.", "author": "Anton L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-08", "description": "This review is for the PHO only. One word---Tasty!!! Second in SF only to Golden Star in Chinatown. The broth is aged to perfection with a wonderful depth of flavor and the accompanying plate of sprouts, basil, peppers and citrus is always fresh and crisp. The shrimp spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce are pretty darn fine too. The service is friendly,  the restaurant clean, the serving size is huge and the price is el cheapo. A bit of a ride to the Outer Richmond, but well worth it especially  since the beach and the park are right there too. If you are a Pho fan, pick a foggy day and head on out.", "author": "b g."}

You would think that everyone eating breaths a collective hot breath and exhales.  Anywhoo, I went here last weekend with a good friend to catch up and eat soup.  However, I was totally distracted by a version of the #52 at Kim Son (please see my review for Thanh Tam II).  Kim Son's version was a bit larger.  The imperial roll was rather hefty but not as flavorful as Thanh Tam II's).  The pricing was comparable, not competitive.  So, if you are on Balboa, this place is pretty darn good (especially on servings).  Minus half a star for the uber slippery floors on a rainy day and another half of a star off for circling the block 20 times before getting a parking space.  Minus one whole star for the older waitress who allowed herself to be exploited by a group of white folks who asked her to hold a sign that said, \"Happy Birthday Cynthia\"!  Sorry, I had to say it.  For the most part, it's a decent place to kotch and have some Pho (pronounced FA as in fa-la-la-la) and or Thanh Tam II's version of #52.", "author": "Dorothy S."}

Kim Son is right next to the Balboa Theatre, so if it's cold and foggy (or raining) after your movie, slip through the steamy, brothy doors and the nicest family in the world will warm you to your marrows. Their vegetarian spring rolls are incredible, with crunchy tofu and mushrooms...delicious! And you can't go wrong with the pho. I've had the house beef pho, the free range chicken (could raise the dead) and the barbecued pork (slap your momma good). They are all so good, they'll make you cry. Seriously, I had cravings for Kim Son even before I was pregnant.", "author": "Sarah Y."}

I come from san jose so I had high standards to be met for the pho here. This is the closest you're going to get other than going down into the tenderloin. If you're looking for a good place to eat near the beach, and very fair priced.", "author": "LINH B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-08-22", "description": "I just moved into the neighborhood and was thrilled to see a place nearby serving one of my favorite dishes - pho.  Big dissapointment.  The broth was super greasy and the restaurant itself gives off a vibe of uncleanliness which some of the other reviewers have commented on.  The table felt oily as did the utensils.  And I can well believe what someone else said about witnessing a staff member not washing up after using the restroom or finding a cockroach.  There's no way that this place is staffed by people who truly care about being clean.  Yuck.", "author": "Missy L."}

We found Kim Son on Yelp...and it lived up to it up to its 4 star reputation. It is in a nondescript strip of storefronts on Balboa. It is as uninviting as it gets from the outside and the decor is....well...nondescript. On the positive side, there were mostly Vietnamese patrons when we arrived on a Sunday at 1pm. We ordered simply; an order of Spring Rolls with BBQ pork and Pho - an order of the tomato-crab paste and an order of the BBQ Pork and shrimp (#13 and 24 respectively if I remember correctly. Both of the Pho dishes were excellent, although very different. The BBQ pork is superb - do not miss it. The Spring Roll was a revelation. I have never understood what they were all about. These Spring Rolls were delicious. The whole meal, including a beer was very affordable. We will be back! You will not be disappointed.", "author": "RJ T."}
