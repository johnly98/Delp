When he'd give them to me, I'd pretty much just eat the chicken and the bun part, while avoiding the black mushroom and the hard boiled egg part.  For the price of 1 at Out The Door you could get 2 or 3 in Chinatown or on Clement.  \n\nBut all I gots to say is, BEST OVERPRICED CHICKEN BUN!  The meat was so flavorful and moist.  The bun so fluffy and it all still tasted good 20 minutes later when I got back to the office to eat it.  It also didn't have a hard boiled egg or a nasty black mushroom which I so appreciate.

This is located behind Slanted Door and seems to be its to-go Cafe. Like every other restaurant in the Ferry building at the peak lunch hour like there was a huge line to order. I dutifully got in line and after about 5 minutes was up. Due to a late breakfast I decided to get something light, so got two Steamed Chicken Buns ($3.50) to go.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of ordering someone came and told me that they were out of chicken buns and if I would like something else. On hearing a no, the person walked across to the small station that sells steamed buns and got me two from there. It seems that small station is also an extension of this place so I was getting the same product.\n\nLet's come to the buns. They were piping hot, decent sized and two would be enough for a complete meal for a light eater. They were perfectly steamed and had a decent amount of filling. Overall they were pretty good. The question is, were they $3.50 a pop worth? I mean you can get steamed buns for $1.1 each in Chinatown and even cheaper in other places so a large part of what you are paying is for the location not the food. I mean these were much better but not 3x better. \n\nOther entree's too were all in the $15 range so this is definitely one of the more expensive to-go places to eat in FiDi. Looking at the overall package of quality, service, price and value I'd say this is A-Ok at best.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I only tried one piece of pork, which was on the dry side, but very flavorful and filling.

I know it's a simple aspect, but I've never really liked rice paper that much until these rolls. The filling could have used more protein, and what is this creamy mayonnaise-y spread? Inauthentic and unnecessary. Their peanut sauce is unique and creamier than most I've had, which would effectively eliminate the need for that mystery spread. Pretty damn delicious sauce, but could be even more delicious with the addition of crushed peanuts. Overall, would eat again, but $9 for two rolls is a bit much. \n\nVietnamese coffee: Not strong enough. I appreciate the authentic Vietnamese coffee filters doing their thang in the corner, but the resultant product was much too weak, especially with the munificent amount of ice. Stronger coffee, less ice please. \n\nThe workers were very friendly and quick with their service, which I appreciate. \n\nOverall, a good option when craving Vietnamese food when in the Ferry Building hood.

There's no seating area and a meal will come to the same as a medium-ranged sit down.  However, they use quality ingredients that taste SO good.  I love the spring roll ($$$, but just better than other spring rolls I've had), the beef pho, the salads, and the chicken banh mi.  Everything is probably a 25-40% premium over other places, but it just has a clean and amazing taste I have not found elsewhere.\n\nI decided to venture to Dragon Eats for their chicken Banh Mi today.  And, while it was $6.50 vs OTD's $11, it was not quite as good and OTD's has 1.5-2x the meat.  With the OTD sandwich, I can have over two meals.  So, it's definitely $$$$, but still my go to in this area when I'm craving spring roll, pho or banh mi.  \n\nIf prices were $1-2 less, it'd be a 5* place in my book!  but, I imagine Ferry Bldg rent ain't cheap.", "author": "Kathryn C."}

The pork bun was my favorite though, it was so flavorful!  It sort of reminded me of a xiaolongbao but without the soupiness.

I have had positive experiences with Charles Phan restaurants in the past, like Slanted Door when I turned 16 and also Out the Door when it used to be located at the SF Westfield Mall. I mean I knew I wouldn't get a beautiful dining experience and service of sitting in front of the Bay Bridge, but I expected a dish that would have the casual version of the same caliber! I wanted a rice dish, and when I saw the Lemongrass pork with vegetables I was sold. However I can't say my tastebuds were sold. \n\nI think I waited about 10-15 mins for my order. When it finally came, I had to hope to get a seat or standing room at one of their tables. It's first come first serve, which is frustrating since some people have finished their soup 20 mins ago but are still catching up with their friends and lounging around. \n\nAnyway, I took my first bite of my lemongrass pork. Cold. Took another bite. Cold. Took a look at my vegetables - it was actually just broccoli, no variation. Took a bite of broccoli - cold. Took a bite of the rice, which was short grain. WARM AND DELICIOUS!!! ....to think that my favorite part of the disk was the rice. Really now? \n\nMy total was $13 for the whole thing. To be honest, I'm fine with paying that much for a fancier lunch that comes from Charles Phan, but not if my food comes out cold. Disappointing. And another tip for the restaurant, it's super frustrating to be given numbers that don't put the guests in numerical order. They should do something similar to in-n-out where you can anticipate where your order is in the line.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

Compared to those below-4 star-reviewers, perhaps I just ordered well off the menu.  I opted for their Chicken Noodle Soup aka Pho Ga and split a Vegetarian Steamed Bun with my sister.  \n\nThe pho was portioned to my liking in that I thought it was a generous and healthy serving for takeaway.  I had ample noodles and the breast meat in the soup were tender and cooked well.  I was also provided with the usual dressings of lime, bean sprouts, basil, etc.  Before I added the dressings, I thought the broth was good, but not necessarily bringing the \"pho\" flavor I was expecting.  If you're looking for pho, you may be disappointed when it doesn't quite meet your expectations.  However, maybe that's the reason it's listed as Chicken Noodle Soup as opposed to Pho Ga.  After I added the lime & co, I got more of the \"Vietnamese\" flavor in pho, but it wasn't the same.  That being said, I still enjoyed the meal.\n\nThe real star of my takeout experience there was the Vegetarian Steamed Bun.  After splitting it with my sister, we immediately went back for more and then some more on top of that for the long road back down to San Diego.  The filling is of mixed mushroom, glass noodles, and spring onions.  The flavors it brought to the steamed bun were fantastic, especially for being vegetarian, and the steamed bun part was wonderfully warm and pillowy (I can use that as a word, right?).  *drool*  I appreciate a good vegetarian dish anywhere, but THIS was a fantastic find and alternative to traditionally meat-based Asian savory buns.\n\nI'll definitely hit up Out the Door for more of dem buns next time I'm at the Ferry Building!", "author": "Halstene A."}

Both would have been amazing,  except that the chicken pieces were gross and disgusting.  If you are picky at all about the pieces of chicken, avoid any dish from there that has the meat. The roll and veggies from the sandwich were fresh and delicious. The rice and flavors of the clay pot sauce were spectacular. We just couldn't bear to pick through and trim the chicken. We did recycle and give the meals to a homeless person who I hope enjoyed it...but I'm not sure.

The wife had a chicken dish described as chicken with potato and carrots in a stew type sauce. That was nearly $14. You automatically know that when you go to a restaurant or any shop in the Ferry Building that you are going to be paying top dollar, so that part did not bother me.\n\nThe reason that I can only give them two stars is that my wife's dish was TERRIBLE. First the chicken that was included was two drumsticks, the cheapest and most difficult part of the chicken to eat. The chicken was almost undercooked and did not look appetizing at all. It did not have a lot of flavor either. Then to top it off there was not a single potato in her dish. She didn't even want to eat it, so we ended up sharing my sandwich.\n\nI don't know how they had such a long line when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.

My uncle and grandparents are not convinced that expensive Vietnamese food made with fresher ingredients could be much better, whereas my sister absolutely loves Slanted Door for their shaking beef.  I am somewhere in the middle, because I agree that some dishes such as bo luc lac could stand to benefit from better quality ingredients; however, I also would never pay more than $8 for pho.\n\nI was interested in trying Out the Door as a representative of the middle road between cheap Viet restaurants and Slanted Door.  It was okay.  I got the Vietnamese crepe (banh xeo) on the special menu.  The crepe had much more meat and shrimp in it than the banh xeo I am used to eating (both in restaurants and made at home by my family members).  I always remembered banh xeo as being more on the bland side (and that is why we add the fish sauce), but Out the Door's version had much thicker cuts of beef and was saltier.\n\nThe main detractor for me was the fact that the crepe was extreeeeemely greasy.  I got it to-go, and the bottom of my to-go box was soaked in grease (see http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CALxYrt__KaPU-4JA3MvsQ?select=BxRr5DAQ4Cf-UIlGI49_JQ).  The first half of the crepe tasted good, but by the end - with the fish sauce and all the grease - I didn't feel all that great.\n\nThe menu is expensive for what you are getting, to be sure.

The Ferry Building booth is not as adorably decked out as most other stands, but there is usually a small crowd during lunch hour. There is limited bar seating and a few standing tables. Service is very efficient and everything comes in a to-go container.\n\nI got the Crispy Duck and Green Salad with rice ($12). The cashier warned me that it would take 7-10 min to make, but it probably took closer to 5-7 min. I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail in my little to-go box. The green salad comes with a light balsamic vinaigrette dressing and grapes (for your daily fruit intake). The duck wasn't as crispy as I hoped, but it was restaurant-quality meat and not too dry. The rice was topped with green onions, which added an unexpectedly fitting kick of flavor; I'm going to have to try this at home.\n\nOut the Door is slightly pricey, but nothing unheard of for the high quality and thoughtful menu options. The flavors are more Vietnamese than Western, which makes this an fusion-yet-authentic lunch stop.", "author": "Jessica F."}

The peanut dipping sauce has the perfect amount of garlic and spices. I'm salivating just thinking about it. \n\n2. Lemon grass pork with vermicelli noodles - The pork (marinated in sweet sauce) compliments the pickled vegetables.  I always order this with extra noodles, because they give you so much of the meat.  It's a good problem to have. :)\n\n3. Grilled 5-spice chicken bahn mi (sandwich) - This is my boyfriend's favorite.  He said the chicken is very flavorful and never dry. \n\n4. Pork bun - In taste and flavor, Out the Door's pork buns are comparable to the ones you can find in Chinatown.   In quality of meat, Out the Door blows its competition out of the water!  They use lean pork pork for the filling, and it doesn't have fatty chunks or chewy ligaments. \n\n5. Wonton noodle soup - Good broth, decent wontons, but it won't knock your pants off. It's a good rainy day dish. \n\nThe service is not always the best, but you can't expect too much from a place that serves food to-go.  I wouldn't let this deter you from trying the food.

The takeout version of the highly raved Slanted Door offers different selections and price compared to the main dining.  Having dined at their main restaurant Slanted Door (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ZuhygpLHdwsELMWa3Nbymw), I felt that Out the Door is a much better value and is a 'steal' as you get to enjoy quality meal below $10.   \r\n\r\nStaff's highly recommended Hanoi beef noodle soup ($7.50) was quite delicious; furthermore, I was impressed that they packed the soup and the noodle in separate containers.  When I first opened the well sealed noodle container, I was surprised that the thinly sliced beef was still raw, but when I poured the hot soup, it became cooked just like shabu-shabu.  It was a noodle dish adjusted to taste buds of non-Vietnamese customers, like me.  There was so much that I couldn't finish it.  \r\n\r\nAnother takeout that was really good was their Braised pork spare ribs with rice (around $7), which was on special.  Pork on bone came in easy to bite sizes and make it a really nice lunch.  Flavoring was nicely done, although I felt it was a bit strong in flavor like many of their dishes at Slanted Door.\r\n\r\nThey have other light dishes like green papaya salad and jicama salad.

Maybe it's that I'm trying not tax my system with bold flavors today.  But this jook wasn't the simple delight I was expecting.  Loaded with white pepper, fried onion, raw green onion, cilantro, and large slices of fresh ginger. it was an explosion of flavor.  I like the chicken which was soft and delicious.    I personally thought it was a bit watery and could also have used a bit more rice and cooked a little longer to breakdown the grains.  Props for the slices of fried bread to put in it. Nummy!\n\nThey also switch the lettuce in their fresh spring rolls to iceberg (I'm fairly confident it was romaine before.)  I understand the economy sucks and it's a good way to cut costs, but it just isn't as yummy.\n\nI like their selection of food items and it's convenience and will still be going back occasionally.", "author": "Susan C."}

The spring rolls were just delicious, I am not even sure of all the ingredients besides shrimp, lettuce, clear wrap and pork possibly?  I could not stop eating them.  So fresh and delicious!  The chicken, which I assumed would be spicy since wings usually are, we not spicy at all.  They were a crispy burst of flavor that pretty much melted in your mouth.  YUM!\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e as basic and bland this may sound, I went with the cellophane noodles with chicken, broccoli and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!  It was the perfect portion to fill me up and not knock me out too.  The noodles were just divine, I could have easily taken a bath in them they were so light and fluffy.  The seasoning was so refreshing too, made for an overall great plate.\n\nI would like to set you up with the size of my party; there were about 16 of us for an hour lunch.  The servers just were not on their game.  They seemed extremely overwhelmed and forgot to bring some items including one of our main plates because he simply \"forgot\" to put the order into the kitchen.  Nothing horrendous happened, you could just feel their overwhelmed vibes.  \n\nSide Note: I simply went with water for my drink but can I please tell you about one of the most unsettling experiences in the history of my texture-obsessed life?  This by no means affects this review it is just a side note because this place was GREAT!   Others in my party had tapioca tea.  Being a fan of \"normal\" textures I was not ready for this experience.  I assumed that the tapioca part would be similar to the pudding, which is why I never eat the pudding but it was not like what I expected at all.  First of all it comes with this huge straw in order to suck out the balls.  I got one in mu mouth and I almost projectile shot this gooey little sucker across the room.  It was like a ball of rubber cement and not something I wanted to chew.  So weird!!

While the prices here are not as egregious as The Slanted Door, they are higher than your average Vietnamese restaurant.  But don't expect traditional renditions of Vietnamese food since the food here is Vietnamese fusion, so it is marketed to people who are used to paying more for their food.\n\nThe chicken congee was surprisingly delicious.  They put it in a large tub, that was larger than the regular quart sized containers you would normally get for soups in take out restaurants.  The flavor of the congee is more robust than your average Chinese congee because it had acidity from lemongrass and lime juice.  There are chunks of succulent chicken that settles at the bottom of the container, so remember to scoop some out while you are eating it and add some of the fried dough that accompany the congee on the side.  The finishing touches of fried shallots and cilantro rounded out the congee.  I was a happer camper eating this congee and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a nice filling porridge for a cold day or if you're feeling under the weather.  I would definitely order this again.\n\nThe lemongrass pork with vermicelli was not as fulfilling as the congee.  Contrary to large quantity of congee given with an order, there was less given for this dish.  The ratio between the pork and the vermicelli with salad was off because there wasn't enough vermicelli noodles.  This would probably be sufficient enough for a light meal in case you weren't that hungry. But it's not substantial enough as a sole meal for lunch or dinner.  I probably wouldn't order this the next time I drop by since I didn't love it enough and there are plenty of other things to try out on their menu.", "author": "Kai C."}

Really disappointing.\n\nI had heard really good reviews about the Slanted Door / Out the Door group of restaurants and when a few of us were at the Ferry building at lunchtime, we were excited to try a few dishes from Out the Door.  Unfortunately, the food was pretty horrible.  \n\nWe ordered Vegetarian Imperial Rolls, 5-Spice Chicken, and two of the daily specials - a curry dish and a chicken dish.   Of these, the Imperial Rolls were great (as was the iced tea that we had to drink).  However, the other dishes were so unappetizing, we actually threw them out after only a few bites. \n\nThere was a huge line so it took a while to get up to order and then we had to wait for the food to come up.  Because we had ordered separately, the food didn't come up all at once and we ended up trying the curry first. All of us agreed that it had a very bland off taste (hard to describe - kind of reminded me of dish soap).   The curry was so unpleasant, I actually went back up to the counter to ask about it and the girl said the the curry was \"supposed to be bland\" with a look that suggested that we weren't the first people to have this reaction.  She was friendly and offered to make us some Lemongrass Tofu instead.  \n\nThe 5-Spice Chicken came next and did not taste fresh, the sauce was unbalanced, and the chicken had a rubbery texture.  After a few bites, we agreed that it just tasted terrible and having already said something about the curry, we did not want to complain about a second dish and ended up tossing it out.   \n\nThen we tried the Imperial rolls and the chicken dish that was on special.  The chicken special was a stir-fry dish with chilis (I don't recall the exact name).  While not rubbery like the 5-Spice chicken, the special chicken was very greasy and extremely salty.  It had no flavor otherwise.  We ended up throwing this out as well because it was just too greasy to eat. \n\nWe devoured the Vegetarian Imperial Rolls because we were hungry and they were MUCH better than anything else we had tried - crispy with a nice mushroom flavor.\n\nFinally, the Lemongrass Tofu came up (by now it had been over an hour of waiting in line and waiting for food).  This dish was better than the others but still not great.  It was also greasier than other Vietnamese food that I've had and it lacked the nice fresh, clean flavors that I am used to from other restaurants.\n\nI would not go back.", "author": "R M."}

I do miss when eye round comes raw so you can get some rare portions as it slowly cooks in the broth.  The noodles are thicker than typical rice vermicelli, kind of like the Northern Vietnamese style.  All the basic greens are included, though they do skimp on the cilantro.  The broth itself has a great beef stock base, but lacks the complex spice (such as star anise) and herb combination found in the better phos throughout the city.\n\nSteamed BBQ Pork Bun: Very strong ginger flavor in the meat.  The sauce is ok, but could have been a bit more BBQy.

Fast forward to Saturday afternoon, and I find myself sitting at Out the Door having lunch.  Power of suggestion?  Perhaps.  Whatever the case is, I have visited this sweet little takeout arm of Slanted Door twice in two weeks, and with or without Stanley Kubrick in my head, I will go again.\n\nMy favorite dish so far has been the Duck Rice Porridge.  The warmth and smoothness of the porridge is fortified by the duck meat and brightened by the strong flavors of lemongrass and ginger.  In my opinon, this is a near-perfect dish - absolutely delicious, and the only thing I would change would be to add a little more duck meat.   Even if you manage to get a stool at the counter, get  the take-out container (not the eat-in bowl) - it's one of those heavy, large sized ones that  you can take home and use over and over.   It will make you feel like you got your $7.50 worth if you are worried about that.  Plus, you will only be able to eat about half of this dish unless you are really ravenous.  It comes with a side of this fried bread which is very good.\n\nI have also had the Clay Pot Chicken, which was tasty (although the sauce was a bit salty) - it came with sticky rice with grains that were so small, they were almost like couscous.  These micro-grains had a wonderful texture, and I would love to find that rice to cook at home.  \n\nMy Chrysanthemum and Lychee Iced tea was refreshing and a great accompaniment to the richly flavored food.\n\nOn my list to try for next time:  Spring Rolls,  Daikon Rice Cakes, and the Nieman Ranch Beef Salad.  \n\nBeware of one thing - on Farmer's Market Saturdays, the customers can be a little bit cutthroat at the counter and especially around those stools, which are a hot commodity.  Remember that guy in Full Metal Jacket that talked to his gun and ended up shooting the sergeant in the bathroom, while Matthew Modine looked on in horror?  Yeah, that kind of cutthroat.

Luckily the dipping sauce was really nice and picked up the slack. There were two rolls in the order, but they were longer than usual and were cut into thirds, so i guess $7.50 is a fair price.

Vietnamese classics.\n\nBesides the food being way over-priced compared to normal Bolsa prices, or any other REAL Vietnamese joint even in SF.. the food was.. aite? Nothing spectacular; not bad, not good.. just aite.. for a lack of a better word. The Coffee had the bitterness to it, but wasn't the same.

Check out the daily specials board as they sometimes have interesting dishes (halibut, flank steak, short ribs, etc.).  Hard for me to order the pho since Chinatown is only a few blocks away.  Staff is very nice, but orders can get confused if there are long lines.  Check your order before leaving.", "author": "Mike C."}

It's pricey Vietnamese food, but you are getting quality food and great taste.  And besides it's the Ferry Building.  Everything is expensive as it's a tourist trap, but you get what you pay for and what you get here is good food!  Love the Imperial rolls.  It's crispy and they give you a side of lettuce leaves to wrap them in and some vermicelli noodles on the side.  The chicken noodle soup is great for a cold day if you just want some comfort food.  The lemongrass vermicelli bowls are easy to eat and to-go containers - which most dishes are easy to grab and go.  It gets super busy on Tuesdays and Thursdays because of the Farmer's market days.

Slanted Door is one of the most popular restaurants there and I wanted to give it a shot.  I came for a late lunch, however, and it was closed.  Out the door is a to-go place that serves some of the dishes at Slanted door in bento boxes.\n\nI had their pork bun, lemongrass pork vermicelli noodles, and lychee drink w/ boba.  \n\nLEMONGRASS NOODLES W/ PORK:  The vermicelli noodles were delicious.  They chop the lemongrass up and mix it in with the noodles.  That gave them a really nice, spiced up flavor.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the meat too much.  It was covered in an adobo sauce that gave it kind of a mild spice.  In my opinion, this sauce was not necessary and it didn't work.  If you get this dish, definitely don't forget to use the fish sauce (the sauce in that plastic container) and mix it up real good with the lettuce (at the bottom of the bowl) and the noodles.  This dish was okay, but it isn't worth $9.  \n\nPORK BUN: This is a steamed bun that's filled with pork.  The pork is like something you'd find in the middle of a dumpling at a dim sum place.  It's perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I just don't feel like it's worth $3.\n\nLYCHEE DRINK W/ BOBA:  I recommend this.  Strong, distinct lychee flavor.  It's sweet and the boba is nice and soft.  \n\nOverall, the food here is pretty flavorful.  As can be expected in any fusion place, some of it works and some of it just doesn't.

I've given it two chances and so far, I haven't been impressed. I've had their Hanoi beef noodle soup, chicken rice porridge, and 5-spice chicken with vermicelli. Honestly, you can get the beef noodle soup and chicken vermicelli at any Vietnamese restaurant and it'll taste just as good (if not better and more authentic) for a fraction of the price. The soup was tasty enough but there wasn't enough of it for me to eat the noodles with. The chicken rice porridge (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CALxYrt__KaPU-4JA3MvsQ?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ) is a little different than the Chinese congee I'm used to. It was flavourful but tasted oddly sweet to me - not the comfort food I was looking for. Maybe they're trying to cater more to the American palate. The Chinese donut that comes with it is stale. It's supposed to be crispy so that when you soak them in the congee they soften up. I'd just walk 10 to Chinatown and get some cheap congee there. \n\nAlso, $3 for a steamed bun is ridiculous! Just go to Chinatown and get a giant baked/steamed BBQ pork bun (or steamed veggie/chicken bun, since that's what they have on their menu) for $1. I'm also sure that any of the Vietnamese sandwich shops on Polk will serve a better sandwich for $4 than the ones they charge $8.5 here for.\n\nOne last pet peeve is their so-called \"Hong Kong milk tea\". For the record, real HK-style milk tea is made with evaporated milk, not sweetened condensed milk. Not only do they not make it properly, they have the audacity to charge $3 for that cup of crap. (I know the misuse of condensed milk is an issue in most of the Bay Area, this is the only place I've seen that actually calls it HK-style in the menu... AND charge you a ridiculous price)\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for authentic, reasonably-priced, and tasty Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown or the TL.", "author": "Steph L."}

Yes, it is expensive, but you're worth it!\n\nThe food:\n1) Chicken Bun:  A mouthwatering chicken filling inside a light, fluffy bun.  Well, the bun isn't always light and fluffy, but when it's perfect, it's perfect.  This is so much better than the minced meat filling and tough bun that I usually have elsewhere.\n2) Pork Bun:  Much like the chicken bun, but with a savory, fatty pork filling.  Also one of my favorites here.\n3) Vegetable Bun:  Unless you're a vegetarian, I would recommend skipping this.  It's good and has a filling of noodles, sliced mushrooms, and other veggies, but the chicken and pork buns are so much better.\n4) Vietnamese Sandwich (banh mi): A luxurious amount of meat combined with a nice balance of vegetables (pickled carrots, cucumber, cilantro) inside a crispy baguette roll.  I prefer the grilled 5-spice chicken sandwich over the Saigon roast pork sandwich which has very large amounts of fat.  Overall, a nice alternative to your typical Vietnamese sandwiches to enjoy once in a while.\n\nI haven't tried their spring rolls yet, but if the peanut sauce that comes with it is anything like the peanut sauce at it's sister company, The Sliding Door, then buy those spring rolls and eat that sauce!", "author": "Joe G."}

Of course, now that I'm a new resident in your area, I figured it'd be awesome to try out lunch at Out the Door.  The last few weeks I've been absolutely OBSESSED with Bun Mee's Lemongrass Pork Bun bowl.  Naturally, when I saw the same item on the menu, I absolutely went for it!  After taking two bites into the pork, it was completely overcooked.  My pork was tough, dry, and lacked a lot flavor.  For $8.50, I expected to be blown out of this world, especially since Bun Mee's bowl is cheaper.  I hardly had any noodles, and the flavor of the nuoc cham didn't have enough garlic in it.  The vegetables that were in there were fairly standard, so really it came down to overcooked pork in my bowl.  This just wasn't worth the amount of time spent and the money paid.

I ordered a roast pork sandwich and it was awful. I love me some banh mi but this was dry and flavorless. After trying to choke it down I gave up.\n\nI was starving so I ordered a green papaya salad and some spring rolls to share with another person in our party figuring they should be fairly safe and . . . the spring rolls were decent. Not great, but decent. I didn't care for the sauce that they served with it -- it was not nearly as flavorful as the sauce I've gotten at every other Vietnamese restaurant, the hundreds of times I've ordered this dish at the scores of other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to -- but it wasn't awful.\n\nThe green papaya salad was awful. It was dry and what little dressing it did have was flavorless. To make matters worse, the green papaya was woody, tough and flavorless. I suspect it was maybe too \"green\" to use.\n\nMy niece said the broth of her Pho was \"decent\".\n\nSo, all in all, it was pretty awful. I would definitely NOT go back to this place.

I am always slightly unnerved by how much more expensive it is than other Asian places and how the food never quite lives up to the price, but it's decent and I chalk the prices up to the Ferry Building location and the supposed effort they exert in sourcing local, sustainable veggies and meats.\n\nBut today, I had a beef pho dish that bordered on disgusting.  The beef broth had almost no flavor.  The flavor in the beef (uncommonly fatty, dull brisket and rare beef) also seemed to have been leached out by boiling.  A good broth will give flavor to the raw bean sprouts and noodles, which add crunch and texture, respectively.  But here, the naturally flavorless ingredients just enhanced the overall grossness of the dish.  I felt like I was eating thick, smooth, tasteless noodle chunks (yes, the noodles had broken up into chunks, making it impossible to eat with chopsticks) with raw bean sprouts, floating in warm water.\n\nI have had decent meals from here, even decent pho, but I almost never think the food is worth what you pay, especially considering the awesome, affordable options you can enjoy in almost any other part of SF outside of downtown.

Robust flavors.\n\nNot Bad:\n\nChicken Claypot - Great flavors, but we were told this would be the spiciest dish option on the menu. Well... It wasn't spicy. At all. But the flavors were there.\n\nPepper Corn Duck - I love duck. It's a flavor that can't be beat. But for $19.50, I did expect a bit more of a gourmet flair to this dish. It was very good, but disappointing for the price.\n\nNot a Fan of These:\n\nFresh Spring Rolls - The spring roll wrap was tougher than I would have liked. The peanut sauce didn't have enough flavor. I feel like if they had made the sauce a tad bit sweeter, it would have brought the flavors of the shrimp & basil together better. I've had better.\n\nThe Lamb Sirloin - Don't expect a big chunk of lamb, because you're getting smalled chopped pieces in a stir fry, that ended up being a little dry. If you're going to serve lamb, do it so that the customer can appreciate the flavors of the meat.

I'm not looking for authentic fare, I'm looking for a place that uses sustainable, fresh, and good quality ingredients.  Plus, I'm looking for something that is healthy and reminiscent of home cooking (i.e., rice, certain flavours, and ingredients).  \n\nI feel the prices are reasonable for the ingredients they use; I cook quite a bit and shop for the best ingredients, so I know how much things cost and understand the time it takes to prepare it (time is money).\n\nThey are definitely hit or miss items on the menu, but I've stuck to items that are usually a hit for me.

Why not give people a little better quality of fast-food than we're used to.  Why not indeed.  For anyone who grew up in a culture of great street-food, this is no revolutionary concept.  Why it should be revolutionary here in the States, I still have no idea.\n\nBut Out-the-Door misses a bit on the execution.  Now to be fair, I tried only one of the dishes, Rice with Duck and Watercress.  The rice has chopped up green onions, and the duck is roasted well enough.  But the duck is still missing a bit of that juicy crispy goodness that good Peking duck has.  This duck had a consistency half-way between roasted and smoked, not bad but a bit schizophrenic.\n\nThe rice could have used some more umph.  Simple white rice is not enough here.  It needs something more.\n\nThere's still a lot of potential here, so I won't condemn the place.

Like its name, everything here really should be thrown \"out the door.\" I don't understand why people bother eating here. I haven't bothered wasting my time writing reviews for sub-3 star establishments thus far, but this place was so far below average that I felt compelled to write my first one. Hanoi Beef Noodle Soup for $11.50? Spring rolls for $8? Vietnamese iced coffee for $3? Wait, this place is TO GO right? I came here with my parents on a weekend and ordered the above items. Wow I'm still amazed we waited in line at this place and still see one sometimes(!?) when I visit the Ferry Building. I guess we discounted the fact that people were hungry and just didn't want to wait in even longer lines elsewhere. This place fits your typical \"bad food + not worth it\" experience - the worst possible combination. We sat down at the small table that seats maybe 5-10 people and waited around 15 minutes before our food was ready. The pho was extremely diluted, the noodles were extremely average, the meat was extremely difficult to chew, and the garnishes were extremely lacking. Since this is supposed to be a takeout place, I'm not even complaining about the cheap plastic bowl and utensils they provided. The four small finger-sized spring rolls (more than $2/piece after tax) were very average without much food. To be honest, the best thing going for it was the dipping sauce. Finally, I was expecting some decent Vietnamese iced coffee, but it literally came from a pre-brewed pitcher of diluted \"coffee\" (more ice, milk, and sugar than anything else). Was this made from instant coffee? Perhaps The Slanted Door is actually \"good food + not worth it\" or even \"good food + worth it.\" Perhaps. But that is a bet I'm unwilling to take.

Instead I ordered the claypot chicken rice dish, papaya salad and the spring rolls. Yes I know the prices do seem steep \"for Vietnamese food\" but I've heard so much about Charles Phan, I just had to see if his food was really all that by getting some of the basics. Taking price out of the equation, I enjoyed the food very much. I had reservations thinking that the food would be too bland or Americanized for the non-Vietnamese palate. As a Vietnamese person, the food stuck true to the basics. The papaya salad and claypot chicken were as expected, tasted like the stuff I would eat at other Vietnamese restaurants and I enjoyed it. The spring rolls were soft and moist, I think there was mayo on the pork to make it more moist? The sauces were as spicy as it should be, not too spicy but growing up, my parents always kept the extra peppers and chilli sauce on the side for the people who can handle it, so just ask for more if you need it. I was very pleased with the choices. I'm glad the Vietnamese elements didn't get compromised too much. If you want to eat cheaper Vietnamese food then go elsewhere.", "author": "Giang L."}

Still, there is just something, I don't know... something very impersonal and robotic about them. Plus, what do you do with the damn thing?

According to the one of us not writing this review, Out the Door had recently upped their prices, but, according to the same source, her salad was also a bit more generous in size. Both were very good. I think I am actually brainwashed to the point where I like tofu an may even go so far as to consider myself able to discriminate between tasty tofu and nasty tofu (but the ability to discern anything between edible and crap still escapes me). My rice could have been just a tad stickier. Though my skills are unimpressive, I prefer chopsticks with such dishes and good sticky rice makes me look better at using them. The green papaya salad, which I was forced to try, was also very tasty and, I might add, quite chopstickable.\n\nOther reviewers point out there is no place to sit and eat, which confuses me since this place is so obviously geared to take-out customers. I suspect they also complain about the lack of waiters at McDonald's. The prices are, sadly, a bit steep in my book, not crass, just that the food, experience, and price don't really balance each other.

Apparently its the new \"Hot Spot\" so my boyfriend and I decided to try it out.\n\nI went to Slanted Door Restaurant on a Friday afternoon during lunch. When we got there they said that only the bar was open for seating. But since that was packed too ... we decided to check out the take out window ... \"Out the Door\".\n\nThe line was fairly long and when you order, they give you one of those pagers. But seriously, our food took less than 5 minutes to be ready. We ordered the Crispy Imperial Rolls, a Meatball sandwich and tea. Oh wow the food was so yummy!!! The rolls came in 2 and were cut up into 4 pieces. The sandwich was a good size too. A little bit messy to eat but it was still very good!! \n\nThe only reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was cause of the price. You can probably get the same quality of food for a lower price somewhere in Chinatown! Oh and ... though I drink tea regularly, I wasn't a fan of their Iced tea.", "author": "Hiyasmin D."}

I might be grading Out the Door a bit harsh here because I am Chinese and I know how to make porridge, but I only found their's to be average. To be fair, it is far superior to that of say, Quickly's, which is more like watered down rice with a generous serving of corn starch for thickening. However, the main problem with OTD's porridge is that it's completely possible to make it at home at a fraction of the cost. Just make sure you throw in those chicken bones and simmer with the rice to extract all the natural chicken flavors. If you're not someone who knows how to make porridge, then this is a good alternative. It's as close to homemade porridge as you can find anywhere. Just be prepared to pay a premium for it. It's also a good idea to get it before noon, especially during Farmer's Market, because I've seen it sold out on multiple occasions during the late afternoon.", "author": "Jenny C."}

Phew!  I ordered the two salads+rice plate and decided upon the special green-bean salad with the most amazingly delicious sauce as well as a noodle dish that was out of this world!!!!!!!!  I could not get enough of this scrumptious food, and wish I could eat it as much as humanly possible, especially because it would be awesome for my non-allergy inducing diet, which restricts cheese, dairy, wheat, etc.  If you have a chance to go to Out the Door or the Slanted Door, do it!!!

Everything I've ordered from here has been fresh and flavorful. The chicken buns never cease to amaze me. These moist rice flour buns are stuffed with a very gingery chicken and bits of mushroom. The vegetarian spring rolls are a refreshing snack- rice paper encasing layers of lettuce, cabbage, carrots, tofu, and mushrooms, and served with a chili peanut dipping sauce.I've also had the green papaya salad, which was delicious.

I also tried often praised vegetable bun, which was good but no better than the one in my freezer I picked up at Kukje Korean market in DC, and certainly not worth going there just for that alone. The $5 rice pudding was fantastic, with hints of ginger and cubes of fresh mango, maybe the best rice pudding I've had. I couldn't eat any more pork so I traded with my wife half way through for her chicken curry. Delicous sauce, rice like couscous, and lots of chicken.

Yes it can get pricey but the jicama salad, the rolls, dishes and desert + the austrian riesling make it all worth it.", "author": "jess l."}

I've been craving vietnamese lately so I went to slanted door's little take-out station in the ferry buildling today and got myself the pork spare ribs (one of today's specials) and imperial rolls.  The spare ribs were so-so, I felt they weren't marinated or cooked long enough so was lacking a bit in flavor.  The sweet corn that came with the dish was really fresh and extra sweet though.  The imperial rolls were probably the best I've had among many vietnamese restaurants, there were chunks of tasty shrimp in them.    I also got an iced vietnamese coffee which was oh so good, but got me on a huge sugar high because of all the sweetened condensed milk they put in it.  On another occasion I tried their curry chicken and was sorely disappointed, there wasn't much flavor, really below average.  I got there before the lunch crowd today (before noon) and the line was very short and service was quick.", "author": "Jen Ken H."}

Today I first asked for a meatball bahn mi but, at 10:30 am, they were already sold out!  So I got the pork and it was kind of bland for a bahn mi.  There are less then a dozen \"seats\" here so it's not good for a crowd (inside at the Slanted Door they have room but I'm only reviewing Out the Door here) and I doubt the help could handle a crowd all wanting food at the same time.  Took them about 10 mins to fix my little sandwich (and nothing had to be cooked in it), and then it cost $9.  I gave them a $20 and only got a $10 back; I brought this up to the guy running the register but he insisted that was the correct change--so I didn't leave a tip.  This place is priced for the tourist trade and their food isn't anything to write home about--you can get better and cheaper elsewhere (and close by too).  I'll skip the Slanted Door and it's back Door from now on.", "author": "Kai T."}

I called ahead but they wouldn't take my order over the phone because it was for 4 and did not reach their minimum of 10 people.  They promised I would have my food in no more than 15 minutes.  Now mind you, the ferry building is a weird place to find parking- so I took the risk to park up front and ran inside to place my order and get the food.  Hey 15 minutes, why not? They took my order quickly...but it was 50 minutes later before I actually got my food.  They felt so embarrassed  (especially when other customers asked me quite loudly if they had forgotten my order) when they realized I was the person who called earlier that they told me to get free desserts... now do I really want desserts if I didn't order them??? I shook my head no (since not even their hired help speaks English) and left-luckily my car was still there without any tickets).  Get your Sh&% together people!", "author": "Anne L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-04", "description": "Bad news.  Have been going to Out The Door and Slanted Door for 10+ years and have always loved the food.  Last Saturday we had breakfast at Out The Door at the Ferry Building and got the Hanoi beef pho and the duck porridge.  The porridge was burnt!  I am an Asian cook and the taste of burnt rice is very distinctive and a pot of burnt porridge should never have been served.  Serving burnt porridge means that the cook did not taste the porridge or worse, they tasted it and served it anyways, thinking that these tourists (we are locals) won't notice.  The pho broth was tasteless and for $9, there was exactly 3 pieces of overcooked beef and 3 limp branches of basil and couple of slices of peppers to go with it.  Again, pretty lame.  We were just in Hanoi last month.  Hanoi pho usually do not come with veggies on the side like Saigon pho so the tiny plate of limp veggies did not go with the dish in the first place.  The plate of hot pepper sauce with soy sauce was also not the kind of condiments you get with Hanoi beef pho.  All in all, very disappointing, especially when the price was so high.  $9 pho should at least be good and $8 porridge should at least be not burnt, especially for take out!  Previously, the food was so good we did not mind paying for the premium prices but this really is not expectable.  Sorry to see a good restaurant slide.  I hope this is just a blip but a place with a reputation like Slanted Door or Out The Door should not have a \"bad day\".  We will most likely not go back again.  Too bad.", "author": "Hanuman C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-02-19", "description": "the kindest description would be \"underwhelming\".  The most truthful would be \"terrible service, miserly portions, obscene prices, only mediocre quality compared to other Vietnamese places that charge half as much, did I mention terrible service?\"  Our waitron had such a thick euro accent he was nearly impossible to understand.  Our appetizers didn't begin to appear until half our party were well into our entrees, and even then, half of our appetizers showed up as some in our party were finishing their entrees, making for a very clumsy lunch for our party of 8.  Unlike most cheaper Viet plaes, we had to beg for simple condiments, so by the time they arrived the food was cold.  Absolutely, positively, unquestionably will NEVER go back.  Would give negative stars if that were possible.  Since gratuity was included, we couldn't even show our disgust by leaving a small tip.
