Hotel is great, but unfortunately this restaurant is not.\n\nFirst night we ate dinner - it was only 1/3 full at prime time on Friday night which should have been our clue.  We both had the crab and corn chowder - Taste was good but soup was served lukewarm.  My partner had crab cakes and was not impressed - I had fish and chips with garlic fries which were okay but not memorable.\n\nFood was 3 stars and service was 1 star - our waiter went through the motions but rarely checked in with us and obviously didn't care.\n\nSecond night we just had a drink in the bar - service again was just lacking and bartender checked out.", "author": "Lynn A."}

The food came out quickly and their portions were great for the price paid.\n\nI give it three stars, however, because this is a restaurant and their food was just alright. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious either. It just was. It was food and I was hungry, so it provided me sustenance. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice and their outdoor seating area is lovely. It's also in a nice area with great ambience. So I still suggest you give this place a shot because maybe my tastes would just differ than yours.

Both plates were delicious, although I got to add that the New England clam chowder did taste better than the Manhattan. The Manhattan is more for chili bowl lovers, as it has the tomato soup base to it. It was still good though. This is the perfect spot for grabbing something quick but yet still in a fashionable decore restaurant. It's perfect for those windy chilly moments down at the Wharf.", "author": "Georgina E."}

We went in and sat at the bar. We sat down about 12:30 on Sunday 04/14. The restaurant was half full, same with the patio and no one at the bar except my wife and I. It was over 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. The most frustrating part was several employees went behind the bar (the server from the patio a young lady with glasses, the manager a lady with a vest and the other ended up being the bartender) and not only didn't say anything but didn't even make eye contact. \n\nI would expect at least a \"Hello, someone will be right with you\". Even McDonald's does that. I would expect a restaurant in the Argonaut Hotel to provide better service than that.

Still he smirked and didn't say anything. We ordered a couple of beers and some food and it was fine from there, but I still had a real bad taste in my mouth from being ignored. \n\nTo add to my poor experience I noticed the next two parties that sat at the bar and they were treated totally different. Eye contact, and a pleasant greeting. Even gave one guy a taste of different wines before pouring a glass. I'm not sure what we did wrong. All we did was walk in and sit at the bar. \n\nI really hate to go this way, but I have to say perhaps it's because I'm African-American? What else could it be?

Its located near Fishermans Wharf so its a great place to eat when you're a tourist because its next to many things to see. We went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded and we got in right before they closed for dinner. The staff was very attentive and friendly as well sine they knew we were tourists.\n\nWe went solely for the purpose of the legendary chowders. We tried the sampler trio and each one was delicious that we ended up ordering a bowl of the Manhattan clam. They do provide fresh bread to accompany your soup which was a nice bonus. Overall satisfied.\n\nIf you're ever in this area, it is a must go to!", "author": "Michelle M."}

Next, we figured it was just bad service one off incident, but when eventually we were allowed to enter and order our food it took over an hour to get our food and it wasn't even busy. While my husband ordered clams they gave him a full sized fork rather than a clam fork, which was very surprising as this is supposed to be a seafood restaurant and any server should know a full sized fork does not fit into a clam.\n\nAnyone is way better off going outside the hotel to fisherman's Wharf rather than eating at this place.", "author": "Samantha J."}

It's the Wharf. \nThe bartender was very cool, even helped me track down some Pliny the Elder. The fish and chips were good, but nothing overly special. The chowder was very good.  They're famous for their corn chowder, and it was good, but the shrimp and red pepper one was delicious!  Good beer selection, with local options highlighted.  The oyster Rockefeller was also very good. Huge oysters, lots of butter and parm. We were stuffed, and happy.  Try the chowder, and beer, maybe an app, but you can get a better overall meal somewhere else.", "author": "John F."}

But my friends and I just happened to be around the wharf area, so we decided to check it out.\n\nThey had an outdoor patio with heat lamps, but unfortunately it was not in use. The inside was really nice with nautically themed decor: rope, worn wood, deck chairs, sails, etc. (You should check out their restrooms; gorgeous.)\n\nMy friends and I were hungry, but not hungry enough for a full meal, so we got 2 sets of the Trio Sampler that included all 6 of their chowders (Dungeness Crab and Corn, New England Cam, Manhattan Clam, California Clam, Mussel and Sausage, Shrimp and Red Pepper) and Mediterranean Mussels. It was fun to try all the different chowders, but I think my favorite was the Shrimp & Red Pepper and the Crab & Corn chowders. The mussels were top notch and the sauce (white wine, garlic, tomatoes, basil) that went with it was so good that we dumped our oyster crackers in it instead of the chowders. \n\nThe only real complaint I have is that the chowder sampler portions could've been bigger for $12.

We had salmon Cesar salad, crab Louis, Brussels sprouts, and both the Manhattan and crab & corn chowders. I'm sure the bread and croutons came out of a Safeway package, and the salmon was tasteless colorless farm-raised. The so-called award-winning crab & corn chowder was nothing special. The Brussel sprouts were so hard and bitter, they were almost inedible, although my buddy persevered. The deconstructed crab Louis was unorthodox and came with pesto sauce.

I'm a local and this isn't a real seafood restaurant.\n\nThe interior should've tipped me off---the decor reminded me of a chain restaurant and the waiters all wore striped nautical shirts (that were a mere $85 if you wanted to take one home). It is attached to the Argonaut hotel, which has a seaside theme. \n\nThe food was just ok. I had the seafood trio (salmon, crab cake and a shrimp skewer). The shrimp was tasty, but the salmon had an odd flavor to it which might have just been the cut of fish, but the crab cake was downright soggy and I couldn't eat more than a few bites. It comes over a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes which were both good, but there was a butter sauce over the entire entree which I could've done without.  I had a wedge side salad that was boring and bland which I didn't finish.  The other people in my party weren't thrilled with their items, either (fish and chips and a crab salad). \n\nThe portions are fair and the price is about average for the area. \n\nOur server Brian was on top of his game and was really friendly. However, the food runner was rude and seemed miffed that I would need something as simple as a spoon or GASP lemon for my seafood. The others at my table noticed it and made a comment to me. \n\nWe came in for a child's birthday and they gave us a comped dessert (chocolate pot de creme) but they didn't have anymore birthday candles and they didn't sing to our birthday girl. \n\nAll in all, this is a typical slightly overpriced touristy hotel restaurant. I probably wouldn't come back, but the hotel itself looks nice.", "author": "Bianca U."}

After searching for this place for about an hour after a friend recommended it, we finally found it and were happy to sit and enjoy a meal given how cold it was. We sat in a spot where there was a chill by the door and I asked him if it was possible to change locations. The response I received was eye rolling and some huffing and puffing as he walked away to ask the manager. He returned and suggested another spot which was even worse and we stayed where we were. we ordered coffee for my dad, tea for my mom, and a martini for me which I had asked the manager about to ensure they have bleu cheese olives and she said she would have them made. He took the order but then snapped and said they don't have bleu cheese olives and to \"order something else\". When I let him know of what the manager had said, he snapped back \"FINE! I'll ask. what else?\" At this point, I was getting annoyed, but kept my cool because I didn't want to go out again searching for yet another place because we were on vacation and I had no clue what another good spot in Fisherman's Wharf was amongst all the new nastiness taking over the area. He came back with 2 coffees and set my dad's down in a way that coffee spilled out. He didn't apologize and when I stopped him and reminded him that my mom ordered tea, he snatched the cup and started mumbling under his breath as he started walking away which is around the time I lost it and asked \"Are you going to have this ***tty attitude for the rest of the time or is this gonna end?\" He snapped back that he wasn't having an attitude and I said that I would like to see his manager. She came by and apologized and said she'd talk to him, but by then I told her I don't know what kind of person he is and I'm not going to deal with that attitude and the risk of him spitting in our food so we got up to leave. She came after us outside of the restaurant apologized profusely and begged us to come back and said she would talk to him, but by then the damage was done. I refuse to ever visit this establishment again and I don't recommend it to anyone else either because when you are on vacation and are spending good money on a meal, the last thing you want to deal with is some rude person who is probably angry about their own life and lack of accomplishments to then be taking it out on you.

It was too creamy for me and it seemed to be filled with fillers.  My lukewarm opinion of the chowder is likely  due to my own tastes as I prefer a crab chowder that highlights the crab as the main focus -- not the extras like cream, corn and potatoes. The crab chowder I prefer is only available at the Dead Fish which is outside of the city in a suburb called Crockett.\n\nBecause I was at the hotel for a conference that week,  I gave the Blue Mermaid another try.  This time I ordered decaf coffee and the dungeness crab cake.  The decaf coffee was not fresh.  It had a burnt taste obviously left too long without being refreshed.  The crab cake was served with a spring mix salad.  The salad had no dressing and the crab cake was cold.  I sent it back.  The waitress I returned with a warmer crab cake but even that couldn't help the taste--too much filler and not enough crab.

If I can't find a hotel room with a kitchen, I usually have to make due with tuna, nut bars, and rapidly aging leftovers brought from home. As I'm sure you can imagine, I'm excited to find any chef that can safely cook for me. And with my insane collection of food allergies plus gluten intolerance, I'm generally lucky to get a plain piece of meat and steamed vegetables. \n\nChef Adrian not only cooked for us, he cooked spectacular, creative, five star meals for us for three nights in a row while we were staying at the attached Argonaut Hotel. And he was excited to do it, too! He told me he enjoyed the challenge. Our meals were so gorgeous, delicious, and beautifully presented that I'm pretty sure the other diners were jealous - and I can tell you I'm certain *that's* an experience I won't be having again soon. \n\nThe whole experience was smooth and beautifully handled from beginning to end. I took my allergy card in the day we arrived in town - a few hours before we hoped to eat - and spoke with Courtney the restaurant manager. She immediately assured us they could handle cooking for me and popped in to the back to fetch Chef Adrian from the kitchen. He came out, reviewed my allergy card, and discussed possible menu options with us. When we arrived at the restaurant that evening the hostess advised our very allergy-aware server that I had food allergies and that Chef Adrian was cooking a specially adapted meal for me. Chef Adrian came out to go over the ingredients before cooking our meals and then delivered our meals personally to the table and walked us through every ingredient.\n\nFor our first night he adapted the special so that I could eat it. For the second and third nights he cooked us completely original meals using all of the ingredients on their menus that I *could* eat, plus a few he brought in just for us!

The house red and white wines are good, along with the Spicy Chicken Drumettes and shells and cheese.  During lunch, I tried the Grilled Ahi Tuna BLT and the wedge salad.  Both were unremarkable, and nothing I'd bother ordering again, which was disappointing, since I was looking forward to a good wedge salad and sandwich, especially for the price.  On the plus side, the restaurant is great if you prefer a quieter spot in the busy wharf area that is clean and has an outdoor patio.", "author": "Julie S."}

Our party (party of 6) came in, the restaurant wasn't pack or crowded, but it took about 15-20 minutes after being seated before our waitress checked up on us to take our order. \n\n5 of us ordered the award winning dungeness crab and corn chowder and one ordered a club sandwich. The chowder itself was pretty good. It was nice and creamy with good size bits of bacon.  The added pepper and tabasco is a must!  I wish i could have tasted more of the dungeness crab, but overall the bread bowl was filling, but that's because our group devoured 2 plates of bread in our wait, that took seemingly took forever.\n\nMy friend said that his sprite was flat and tasted like it had some soap in it, we got it replaced with iced tea instead. For 5 chowders, a club sandwich, 2 iced teas, and a coffee our bill came out to $113 gratuity included, which seemed a bit too much. There was also a \"SF Good Health Fee,\" wtf is that?!\n\nAll in all, it seems like a touristy spot that charge you a premium for what it's really worth. The service was really slow.

The chowder was absolutely delicious. Infused with flavor, creamy, without being overbearingly thick. The basil oil drizzled on top was a nice touch , bringing the whole dish together. The crab taste was subtle and I would have preferred more crabbiness. \n\nThe Linguini w. Manila Clams was served in a plate overflowing with little tasty morsels tossed in a light, yet garlicky sauce although the linguini was slightly overcooked for my tastes. The garlic sour dough toasts were great at sopping up the leftover sauce. \n\nSmall Seafood Platter for 2 was nothing fancy but a simple dish allowing the sweetness of the shellfish to shine through. Out came a tray with mussels, half a dungeoness crab, a few oysters,& shrimp accompanied by lemons, mignonette and cocktail sauce. When I questioned the waiter about the types of oysters included in the platter he confidently answered 'West Coast Oysters\". Um, no shit? They were fresh, perfectly shucked and appropriately briny nonetheless. \n\nThe Caesar salad was quite large, but the cook was heavy handed with the dressing and Parmesan cheese, making it a bit too salty to finish. \n\nAlthough it's touristy location may warrant prejudgment on the taste & quality of food to be found here I was quite surprised with the solid seafood dishes utilizing super fresh ingredients.

We came here upon local recommendation with the advice that clams are never local in SF, just purchased in cans (makes sense), and that this restaurant was good otherwise.\n\nI had the Grilled Alaskan Salmon. It was a relatively small portion sided with diced sausage, beans, corn, etc. But there's no flavor contrast. They could've used less salt on the entire plate. It didn't wow me for the price. We were a party of five, each paying separately by CC. They give you a slip showing an automatic 19% gratuity. My dinner with tax would've been $32. But here's a tip about the tip: you actually get to add your own tip amount to your subtotal and tax! Nice 19% guideline. LOL\n\nMy friend had the Mahi Mahi. And while the fish portions she said was good (or that she was hungry), they were small. She finished it amazingly quick. She didn't touch the black rice. I tried it. It was too flavored but not in a unique way. So again no contrast. Texture was weird, too. Not completely satisfying. Her total was also quoted at $32. Ouch. Hopefully she didn't mistakenly add tip on top of that.\n\nAnother friend had the Dungeness Crab Cakes. That's plural, so they give you two cakes, each the size of a child's hand. This was what I wanted originally. It sounds good. It comes drizzled with what looks like thousand island dressing, and the plate had some lettuce and diced tomatoes. Maybe they don't do crab well because he said it was just a salty flavor. The menu says it's $3 more than the Salmon.\n\nSo those were off their \"Wharf Favorites.\"\n\nAnother friend got a seafood sandwich. Maybe a custom order. I don't know. It looked tough (as opposed to tender) for the type of bread. He took his time eating it. He took a long long time. Nice thing was that the waiter made practically any order possible and easy.\n\nSome of us ordered the Crab Chowder as appetizer. It's $9 for what looks like an 8 fl.oz. dish. I didn't get it. But no raving comments. One friend said the texture was odd and that the chowder taste was common. Another friend got the chowder Sampler. It was three little bowls (cupcake size) of three different chowders. Nothing special he said.\n\nI would conclude that this restaurant has only the prime location to attract tourists. Parking is horrible unless you've already committed elsewhere (for the nearby attractions) or next door (hotel). Decor inside the simple front door is distinctive and powerful, but I would not want to eat here again for dinner.\n\nIt's not worth it IMO. Maybe their top chef got the night off.

Had made a reservation on Open Table, but it wasn't really necessary since there were plenty of booths and tables available. Plus side the hostess let us know we'd get a free appetizer with the Open Table reservation. Service was impeccable, our waiter was attentive, very informative, and also hilarious. \n\nEverything we ordered was delicious. At first it seemed like the prices were a bit high for such a casual restaurant, but it was so much food the price was completely reasonable. We should have ordered one less entree between the 4 of us.\n\nThe fried calamari was very tasty with a surprisingly spicy kick. The bits of asparagus added a nice complement. The linguine with manila clams was amazing. Pasta was cooked perfectly all dente and the sauce was just lovely with a little bit of spice. The plate was just covered in clams, they did not skimp on that like most places and the texture was just perfect. Cioppino was very good; the tomato broth was more creamy than other places I've had it, but I liked it that way. There was just so much seafood in it, enough to probably feed 3 people! Shrimp was tasty, salmon and halibut were good, clams and mussels cooked perfectly, only the calamari was a bit overcooked in the broth. Weird thing was a garlic bread at the bottom soaked in broth (actually pretty tasty). The pan seared scallops were some of the best I've had in a while. Buttery garlicky goodness, and that forbidden rice was just amazing. \n\nLoved this place. Next time I will need to order less food so I can have room for dessert!

It was ok. There were a lot more clams than I expected but linguini was oily and not fully cooked. There are so many ways to make seafood without it tasting like a mouth full of flour and oil.

Well, for starters, I told the waiter to bring everything out at once, since we were just eating salads, soup and appetizers.  Yet, the crab dip came out first, followed by the rest of the meal a few minutes later.  Next, they brought me the wrong soup...I ordered the Crab and Corn, and they brought out the Clam Chowder.  That's not the worst of it.   The crab dip ordered by my husband was awful.  No lump crab whatsoever, and there was way too much of some flavor we couldn't identify...possibly lemon?  Yet, without that flavor, it would be absolutely bland.  My soup was also bland and also left a bad taste in my mouth.  Lastly, the Caesar salad ordered by my husband was the worst he ever had...no flavor whatsoever, nothing but the bottoms of the Romaine hearts with no leafy greens, and croutons that obviously came from a bag (small and absolutely no seasoning).  Oh, he had a piece of salmon in the salad that also had no seasoning.  Bottom line is that it was the worst $61 (not including tip) we've ever spent on a meal.  Yes, $61 for salads and appetizers.

Our waiter was nowhere to be found. I had to get the attention of another waiter to get a water refill. I got the fish and chips - very greasy and lots of fish bones still in the fish. The garlic fries were really good. The crab and corn chowder was good but under-seasoned. My husband got the seafood trio - he said the best part of his dinner was the mashed potatoes. He was very disappointed with the actual seafood portion. Surprising, considering this restaurant is in Fisherman's Wharf. \n\nUpon checking out of the hotel, we noticed a $130 restaurant charge to our room on the hotel receipt. We had only eaten there once during our stay and paid with a credit card. The restaurant manager was hassling the hotel clerk about removing the erroneous charge. Oddly, the charge was dated for the same day we had eaten there but over double what we paid. My husband even provided proof of the charge to our credit card. The clerk had to convince the manager that it was an error, we paid with our card, we didn't eat twice in the same night, etc... It took a while but they finally removed the charge. What a hassle!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-16", "description": "Admittedly, I've never been inside the restaurant.  I live in San Francisco, so why would I go to Fisherman's Wharf to spend a small fortune (Fisherman's Wharf) for what's probably mediocre food (again, Fisherman's Wharf), most of which I can't even eat (being one of those no-meat sorts).  \n\nSo why 5 stars, you say?  Last night I was going on the beloved FW-as-a-ghost-town super late night walk with the dogs (and my gf and her brother) and as we walked by, lo and behold! they were blasting T. Rex's \"20th Century Boy\" through the speakers.  Now, it's a lovely late night walk, but not the place you expect to hear Marc Bolan come at you like a much welcomed ghost.  Dean Martin?  Sure.  The Doors?  Yeah, drunk tourists looking for an outdated SF love them.  But Bolan?!  \n\nSo, while I have no experience with the food or interior (snarkiness aside, it may be good - I really don't know), I can say their choice of music if phenomenal.  So if you're staying in the area and want to eat at a restaurant that may be great, and is surely as good as any in the dreaded Fisherman's Wharf, with some fantastic music for your dining enjoyment, try the Blue Mermaid.", "author": "Ces Gens-L\u00e0 Z."}

The Mermaid Chowder house was delightful.  The nautical d\u00e9cor was tastefully done (not kitschy), the service was perfect and my food was yummy.  Their house specialty is their Dungeness Crab and Corn Chowder, so of course I had to try a cup.  It was yummy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-02", "description": "While staying at the Argonaut Hotel for a wedding last fall, I had a craving for dungeness crab. Granted I'd already had the garlic crab two or three times on that vacation, but this time around I had a hankering for it in unadulterated steamed form. Since Blue Mermaid was connected to the hotel lobby, it was an easy decision to head there and quell my craving.\n\nIf there's anything I learned about San Francisco on that trip, it was that most places in the city that serve seafood do it so right. I suppose an argument can be made that it's hard to mess up steamed crab, but given how much crab I consume in a calendar year, I can tell you that there are certainly ways to screw it up. No crab I consumed in SF had that issue, and Blue Mermaid was no exception. In fact, they did it so right that I came back the next night and had the garlic crab, which was fantastic and very different from the garlic crab I'd had earlier on the trip. Their version was much less messy, as it wasn't in a garlic sauce but instead had actual garlic pieces cooked with it, a touch I really liked since I felt it showcased the crab better.\n\nAs for their other dishes, the award-winning Dungeness Crab and Corn Chowder was really delicious: It had a home-style comfort-food feeling to it without being too heavy. Their Seafood Cioppino was a bit thicker than other cioppinos, and it had huge pieces of shellfish, which showcased the seafood without taking away from the depth of the broth. My experience with the service may be a little biased, as my boyfriend really hit it off with our waiter and ended up having a few beers with him after he got off shift. From what I could tell with the other waiters though, the service is decent.\n\nBlue Mermaid follows the nautical feel of the Argonaut, and while the decor is appropriate it also rings as very touristy. I imagine that local SF-ers aren't too keen on ever stopping by this place, but if you're ever in the neighborhood and you like seafood, I think it's worth a stop. I will certainly recommend it to my friends who plan a trip to SF and staying in the Fisherman's Wharf area.", "author": "Leizl M."}

TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK! Either the people doing these stellar reviews are friends of employees, or maybe they are locals who get treated well because they come again and again. Us? Oh, ya know, we are the tourists who walk in from the hotel and will tip you 20-25- or even 30% if you do a stellar job. Yep, you read that right. But the night we dined here was a night that was not even worthy of the tip we left, out of being nice people who are Catholic-guilted internally into tipping even for bad service. Our experience here from the word go was downright awful. It looks cute from the outside and we are chowder fans (still going back to Connie & Ted's many times over as a result), so after reading the five star reviews here, we thought this place was a must do since we were staying next door. Oh no, no... no... no! Do not do it. There are a bajillion restaurants in San Francisco and this is not one of the best, or even one of the mediocre ones. We walked in from the hotel side. A bar back, the person who we later learned was the manager (we think, she disappeared later too), and two waiters saw us... and still, we waited at least 5 minutes to just get greeted. Let's also explain now how DEAD the restaurant was. Five tables max, and no one at the bar. So we get seated beside someone having a birthday party. The manager tells us that our waiter will take our drink order after he is done cutting/serving the cake for the birthday party next to us. If she doesn't see him do it in a little while, she will be back. I am not kidding or making this up. That is what she said to us THE MOMENT WE SAT DOWN! Again, let's review: the restaurant was not packed. What was she doing that was so important that she couldn't take our drink order? Then there are the bussers: clearing tables, then immediately going to pick up new plates of food to serve without washing hands in-between. And when they serve you your food, you will be grimaced at, not smiled toward. They joked with each other, yacked it up in the bar area and smiled a lot to each other - but not to any guests. Why do we know this, you may ask? Because we had plenty of time to watch them while waiting for our drinks, food, check, every little thing. Our waiter finally arrives (no luck on getting drinks from the manager because she disappeared along with our waiter), and is sweating all over us/the table/everywhere. We try to make small talk because his hand was all bandaged... to which we got _____ (insert crickets here). So we ordered drinks and food all in one go. Who knows when we would ever see someone again! This is a poor excuse for a restaurant, let alone a Kimpton-tied restaurant. They need to clean house (yes, I'm suggesting firing everyone) and start over. It is clear the management couldn't care less and that trickles down to all staff. Drink glasses were dirty so we asked for new ones - insert another 5-7 minute wait here. Bussers take away our plates from the appetizers (the chowder is not as good as Connie & Ted's - go there for real chowder), and consequently we have no silverware for our main course. Don't think of asking for it because when we asked the busser, I thought he was gonna haul off and hit me or my guy. Seriously, this is how angry he looked. WTH is going on at this place? Finally, we got cold food (I ordered some kind of seafood pasta dish - forgettable especially because I barely touched it due to it being cold and sticky). Yelp world, I hear you - I HEAR YOU! I would have complained, but to whom, and when?!? Manager was nowhere to be found, our waiter was also MIA, and the bussers were hostile at best by this point because we dared to ask for water refills and fresh silverware. So we waited, pondered about going to the front desk to ask for our check since no one was visibly working (bar was empty too). After even more waiting, our waiter reappeared and had the gall to ask if I wanted a to go box.... We paid, and almost ran out to get dessert at another place down the street. The Kimpton management either needs to disassociate the hotel from this place or seriously bring in their ranger team to fix it from top to bottom. Stop having your pals post good reviews and start paying attention to actual customers. When we told the front desk person the next morning about our experience, she asked why we didn't complain to the manager and, again, we told her, \"to whom? How and when? No one was around!\" Try at your own risk - if at all. Better yet, do yourself a favor and try one of the other amongst the thousands of restaurants in the city. You will be glad you did.", "author": "Jen V."}

Being that it was a holiday, I find it to be a perfect time to review this restaurant especially after having such a wonderful experience during one of the busiest days of the year. \n\nBlue Mermaid is located conveniently within the Pier 39 area. The appearance is that of a modern swanky type, enjoyable by all types of crowds. Its different from many Pier restaurants in that it does not have that  old \"by the bay\" restaurant feel like Bubba Gumps and Crab Shack. \n\nMy first impression of this place was the quick service. It was obvious that we came in during rush hour, however the hostess wasted no time in finding us a seat outside the restaurant. The weather was great in the bay this day so we did not mind being seated outside. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Seafood large platter. AMAZING. Sheer perfection in terms of fresh seafood. The platter came with over a dozen mussel prawns, a dozen oysters, some shrimp, and a large crab. Words cannot describe how delicious and fresh each item on the platter was. Suffice it to say, that we were quite happy with our main entree selection. I must also add, that this platter is more than enough for two people. \n\nMy one complaint, which actually is quite minimal in regards to the meal as a whole, is in the cocktail sauce. I have never really heard of many places doing this, but this particular restaurant puts wasabi sauce on top of its cocktail sauce. Not a bad idea, however the Wasabi overtakes the cocktail sauce with impeccable force. The first dip into this mix sends you into a world of pain, as the wasabi penetrates the sense and opens up every airway possible. The experience was by far horribly uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, I am a fan of this place. One  small detail, did not ruin my experience.\n\nThe price for the meal is perfect, and the service was great....... I recommend.", "author": "J A."}

The salmon was flaky and the fresh lemon wedge provided that right amount of citrus. The chardonnay was approachable and unoffensive (a very drinkable wine).\n\nThe prices are what I'd expect.

Everything was delicious. Fresh seafood, well balanced flavors. I love it when a seafood chowder has some bacon in it, it's a very good combo.

I hate tough seafood. Plus, everything was also piping hot and crisp. The fry seafood well here. \n\nFor one of the best bargains ever I'd get the Seafood Cioppino. I got a mountain of mussels, baby clams, pieces of salmon, shrimp, crab legs, and calamari swimming in a bath of tangy creamy tomato sauce. I was in heaven.

There was a delicious orange sauce but it was only on a small part of the fish. I could have used more sauce because of how overcooked the fish was. They cooked it like trout and it was rubbery. I actually had to use a knife to cut it. It was on a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies. There was hardly any mashed potatoes. \n\nWhile our meal was edible, we do not plan to ever go back.

And in San Francisco, the Blue Mermaid's clam chowder is king.\n\nI think a lot of tourists walk right past this place while ambling up and down the Wharf.  You'd be wise not to.  The food and drink here are both fantastic, and you can avoid some of the ridiculous lines you'd get at other eateries closer to Pier 39's tourist hub.\n\nPrior to your meal, they offer you warm sourdough bread to snack on.  This gets you in the mood for whatever you have coming, especially if you ordered the chowder.  If you did, you'll notice a bit of spice (and some celery) that Boudin's doesn't seem to use in theirs.  That little touch sends it over the top.  The bread bowl I got was a bit smaller than the one I had at Boudin's, but neither I nor anyone around me finished it anyway.\n\nThe menu is simple, by that I mean there aren't seven pages of things that are difficult to pronounce and even more difficult to afford.  The lunch menu I was handed was one sheet, front and back.  All the favorites were on it, dominated (as expected) by chowder and other seafood.\n\nTake special note of their mixed drinks.  The adult beverage selection is fairly robust, and they have some interesting combinations that may interest you.  I highly recommend the rum-and-ginger-beer concoction.  Prices are fairly high for what you get, but I suppose one shouldn't expect anything less from one of the most expensive cities in the United States.", "author": "Dan W."}

We also tried their Oysters Rockefeller which were 5 enormous oysters beautifully displayed and extremely delicious.\n\nWe'll definitely avoid the other Fisherman' Wharf tourist-trap restaurants and stick with The Blue Mermaid.", "author": "Mirabella G."}

It was as if they all loved working there.\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant, not overpowering, like a TGIFridays. The music was at the perfect level and played fun old songs mostly from the 70s. \n\nEach time I'm served sourdough bread, I'm reminded that I don't like sourdough bread! I asked them to warm it up, as it was served cold, and it was better warm. Their butter is right out of the fridge, so it was too cold and hard to spread. I like my butter to be room temp.\n\nThe service was top notch. The calamari was a bit bland and arrived less that perfectly hot. The popcorn shrimp, on the other hand was nice and hot, and very good, even a little larger than most popcorn shrimp.\n\nI had the special; swordfish steak with mash and green beans. The fish was pleasant, not the best, but enjoyable. The beans could have been cooked a little more. Wonderful mashed potatoes.\n\nMy guest had the Mahi Mahi. She said it could have been fresher and she didn't care for the Hawaiian relish on top (fresh fruit and such) but she loved the cole slaw.\n\nI loved that they had creme brulee on the menu, however, I was left wishing I had tried the chocolate bread pudding. The brulee was decent, a little heavy, flavorful and perfect carmalization on top. It was served with a dusting of powdered sugar and a shortbread cookie, which was too lemony for my tastes.\n\nLunch for 2 with no drinks, 2 apps and a shared desert came to under $90. Nice location, near the hot spots of the Fisherman's Wharf area, but there are no views. I would eat here again, but I'd prolly try their chowder instead of an app, and I'd try their sandwiches instead of fish; or give the fish and chips a try, but I with the calamari, I didn't want more fried food.\n\nBonus points for using biodegradable flatware for to go items/doggie bags.", "author": "Penguin S."}

We walked around and found the Blue Mermaid Chowder House.  We had the option to sit in or outside, and since is was such a nice day, we decided we had to sit outside! It was in a nice little courtyard, so it wasn't too noisy or crowded.  Since it was a chowder house, and we were visiting San Fran, I decided I would have clam chowder for bfast.  Nope, they don't have it before 11:30.  We were there at 11, but it was still too early.  I decided to go with oatmeal, decided to be on the healthier side, since I had fish and chips the night before.  It was decent.  Its kind of hard to mess up on oatmeal after all.  It came with a little brown sugar, apples, and raisins.  The perfect things in oatmeal.  My cousin had an almond croissant, which she thought was good.  I can not remember what my aunt ordered, but I remember she liked her meal.  The waiter was very friendly, making sure we had water, and that we were doing okay.  He shared some jokes, which boosted the experience.  I would recommend this place for breakfast.

I can, however, attest to the weird-ass freaks who work here.\n\nSunday afternoon, my hunny and I wander in because occasionally we like to go around San Francisco pretending to be tourists.  It's a game my sister and I started back in high school, when we'd go up to Fisherman's Wharf and other tourist destinations and give ourselves fake names and fake accents and do cheesy tourist things because we were bored teenagers who loved clam chowder in a bread bowl.\n\nIt is because of clam chowder that we ended up at Blue Mermaid.  The hunny and I decided to check it out after the robot lady voice on our GoCar GPS system told us that Blue Mermaid won an award for its chowder.  And by \"won an award,\" they actually mean, \"Blue Mermaid gave us money to make you go to their restaurant.\"  But for 20% off our entire bill, we figured what the hey, it's worth a shot.\n\nWe walk in and we're waiting for a table and the \"host\" tells us we're going to have to wait another 10 minutes for a table.  \"Why is that?  The restaurant's half empty.\"  \"Well, because I have to let my waiters catch up!\"  I look at my gf and we're like, nah, we don't want to wait 10 minutes for food-- we're starving and cold.  So we decide not to wait and as we're leaving, the host snaps his hip at us, rolls his eyes and gives us a \"forget you, then\" look.\n\nLook, you bitchy *ss queen.  We live in the Castro and we're surrounded by da gay all the time, so don't give me your flamer diva attitude when you're the one who doesn't know how to host.  What the fuck do you mean you have to \"let your waiters catch up?\"  I have a suggestion.  How about you hire another waiter for your busy weekends or seat people with a glass of water and let them wait over a basket of bread?  Otherwise, don't take it personally when your customers don't want to wait unnecessarily for a seat at your half empty restaurant.  Really, it's not ABOUT you.  \n\nService at Nick's Lighthouse was better, except that I was trapped by strollers in a corner booth.

Repeat. SO so good.\n\nWe also had some hot wings (five for 3.00, pretty typical pricing at .50 or so cents each) and fried calamari.\n\nThe Wings were good, meaty, standard. Could have been spicier, and I usually ask for tabasco but I didn't bother. I was having a good time escaping the chaos outside and enjoying the good atmosphere, beer and soup.

The rep assured me that the chef would be able to have something for me and that they would make sure to get some bread so that I could have toast in the morning. So with that all set I figured no problem- right? We arrived at the hotel and they had put out a plate of veggies and hummus in our room with a note that said \" let us know if you need any help in finding GF restaurants.\" I thought great- they got the message! The next morning we went in for breakfast and I felt like we had entered the land of NO. I explained that I had made previous contact and the waiter said they knew nothing about this. Any bread? No. Ok so I would order eggs and potatoes. He said the potatoes had spice on them that had gluten so I could not have that either. Needless to say I was not happy. Afterwards the manager came over and apologized. We talked and he said that really they don't get a lot of requests for GF. Really? Then why are they listed as having GF on other sites?

The bar didn't have a bartender for over 10 mins and when he did show up, he just got what I needed and left the bar again.  When I finally was seated, the waitress rushed me into ordering.  It was as if I was bothering her while she was working...rolling eyes, shortness with responses, and saying why don't you just get this.  It was so hard to get their attention for a glass of water.  The dishes sat at the table, uncleared, until someone else brought the food.  Staff basically ignores you unless you have to pay.\n\nSO now onto the food...\nI ordered the manila clams for an appetizer.  It was a descent size plate.  Too bad it didn't taste good.  Everyone I know can't wait to dip bread into the broth that clams/mussels are cooked in.  I couldn't even bring myself to do that.  It was so watery and bland...UGH!  Next came the \"award winning chowder\".  I thought to myself..how the hell did this win an award?  It was so watery, and the pesto stuff they put on top made it oily and watery.  AND it tasted like bacon...not dungeoness crab and corn.  I love bacon, but I wasn't expecting it to be the main flavor in my chowder.  So so sad.  I also tried the crab sandwich.  It was nothing spectacular.  I could've made it myself with a big heap of canned crab...probably better tasting and much cheaper.

They (the Tennessee Tourists) raved about the clam chowder and seeing the outdoor seating and the heat lamps, I stuffed 2 dogs under the table and made myself comfortable!  \n\nThe 4 of us dining that night ordered a wealth of appetizers: chicken wings, popcorn chicken and mussels before we each got a bowl of the famed clam chowder. They had a bunch to choose from - the classic, the Californian plus at least 5-6 others.  They even offered a sampler as a menu choice (your choice of 3). I was most delighted with the mussels and found them to be excellent.  The chicken wings were pretty standard and the popcorn chicken was okay as well.  I wouldn't have been able to notice a difference if they'd just ordered a bunch from KFC.

You'll most likely be pretty partial to whatever chowder you end up ordering.

He didn't even ask for my name or anything and just seated us. I had made some special requests as it was our two year anniversary and my mother's birthday. We got married at The Argonaut hotel 2 years ago. The host wouldn't have known this as he didn't check us in.\n2. After he has seated us he says very quietly (the restaurant was loud) that a server would be with us soon. For once my husband and I were early for dinner and my parents late.

The food comes pretty quickly; 3 salads and 2 soups. No one asks if we want pepper on our food so we notice the pepper mill close to the table and help ourselves...

My father had dropped his fork and could not flag down our waiter or anyone else for that matter. He got up and found someone and had a fork brought to the table. As I said, no one had been by to check on us or to find out if we needed anything.\n5. The entrees had arrived, but not all our plates had been cleared. Some fumbling with the dishes, but everyone's food looked great. The waiter left the table, but had a helper to bring all the entrees at once. My father then asked if we could order another bottle of wine. The other server/waiter said that he would inform our waiter of our request. We have not seen our waiter and were wondering if the other waiter had told him about the wine. My father was getting annoyed by this point as he likes to eat his meal hot and with wine. Finally the waiter comes over and says that we drank the last bottle of the wine we previously ordered. He brought another bottle with him and it was fine of course. We're not picky wine drinkers. My father is a known asshole when it comes to things not being right at restaurants. \n6. He says to the waiter in the most douchebag of tones, \"Look, I like to have my meal hot whilst I drink my wine. I couldn't find you to order sooner, but you have not been very available all evening so far. I've read on yelp that the reviews suck and this is why.\" SO EMBARRASSING! He goes on and on to the waiter and the waiter says nothing. Yes, he hasn't been available for most of the evening, but there is a time and place to mention those things. Like after dinner!!! The tone is also how he makes people feel bad. He's a little aspy, but that is no excuse to treat someone that way. \n7. I told my father he was being an asshole and he says to me, \"If I'm going to be paying this much money for food I want damn good service!\" I told him that I completely agree, but he's embarrassed us all and pretty much ruined the evening. I felt bad for the waiter and went up to him and apologized for my raging asshole of a father. He said it's okay, I should have been more available. I said be that as it may, there are ways to treat people, a time and a place, and also tone. The waiter was very sweet.\n8. We had planned on walking through the lobby of the hotel to remember the good times, but I was too annoyed and went to fetch the car.\nOverall, the service was not great and the food was good. We may or may not be coming back here... Certainly not with my father.", "author": "Melissa B."}

It is buttery, sweet, creamy a little salty and topped with a yummy swirl of a pesto oil that just brings it all together perfectly. They have a rustic indoor cafe and a patio that opens up into the Cannery area where you can often eat and listen to live music on the weekends. The crab sandwich on fresh sourdough is also tasty. Slightly grilled with cheese, tomatoes and stuffed with sweet fresh crab.  It came with garlic/parsley fries. Nice thin, crispy fries and just enough garlic for flavor not drowning in garlic oil like alot of restaurants seem to do.\nThe drinks are a little pricey but then again it's at the Wharf so your gonna pay more. I've always had good service, they are very friendly and knowledgeable.", "author": "Ang x."}

I was looking forward to a great Mother's Day brunch, but Blue Mermaid didn't even come close to par.  The only good food I had was the New England Chowda.  (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt & assume that all their chowdas are good.)  I had the crab sandwich which was mediocre  and a Caesar salad without the dressing tossed.  Not to be complicated, but I find it hard to toss dressing on a salad that's on a plate.  \nI also tasted their beer battered fish which tasted too bitter!  My daughter had the grilled cheese, but the cheese was barely melted!  Not to mention they forgot to give her drink.  \nAs my husband asked how their cioppino is prepared, our server explains to us what cioppino is.  Note to servers:  if you don't know how a food is made, just honestly say so.  No harm done.  The cioppino came in with hearty portions of meat but tasted smoky.  \nIt was such a horrible dining experience that I didn't even bother trying their desserts.  \n\n\nP.S.\nFYI-Parking is horrible around this area.  You still need to feed the meters on Sunday.", "author": "Jo B."}

We were there around 8pm and waited about 40 minutes for a table.  We enjoyed a drink at the bar while we were waiting.  The drinks are good, fast service and bar tender was nice.  Once seated we did wait about 10 minutes before service, which made us wonder if we should have just eaten at the bar.  But once we had first contact, the waiter was there prompt the rest of the time (and we did not say anything about the wait).  We had the Dungeness Crab & Corn Chowder, Popcorn shrimp, 1/2 Dungeness Crab and  Garlic-Parmesan Fries.   The Chowder was good, we liked that it had bacon in it, but were bummed that there was not much crab in it.  The popcorn shrimp was really good, very fresh and not chewy at all.  I wish I got the full Dungeness Crab as I could have kept eating that, it was sooooo good.  We could have done without the fries because they were too salty.   Its a casual restaurant, good with kids.  It was very clean and the staff were very friendly.  I wish I could go back and try more items off of there menu.

We decided to eat there Sat night since we were leaving that night and our bags were right next door at the hotel baggage check.  We had been walking around all day and we actually had shared a Boudin clam chowder in a bread bowl AND a crab cocktail, so we were not super hungry, but decided to try the Blue Mermaid anyway because of the \"award winning\" crab and corn chowder.\n\nIt actually was really good.  It's not your typical super gooey chowder, it had a lighter consistency with some smokiness and spiciness to it.  It was definitely interesting and unique.  One of the typical NE clam chowder ingredients is some bacon bits, and in the case of this chowder, it felt like the crab bits were rendered until slightly crispy and then added into broth.\n\nWe also shared the mahi mahi with mango salsa and asked for veggies and fries (garlic parmesan).  We were afraid we were going to explode (well, I actually had eaten almost all the bread bowl from Boudin) but when the food came, it was so tasty and fresh we didn't mind chowing down.  Unfortunately my Mahi Mahi had come in a bit undercooked, which was a big deal for a pregnant lady (me), so they took it to re-cook.  I'm actually glad they did not refire a new one but I'm sure they would have if I asked.  \n\nAs we waited for them to cook the Mahi, we started on the veggies and fries and those were VERY VERY YUMMY.  The veggies were french string beans with some cooked tomato.  They were crisp without having that super vegetably taste and some of the mango salsa from the fish had mixed with the string beans giving it a really fresh flavor.  The fries SMELLED AWESOME and tasted even more awesome.  They were about the size of the string beans (skinny too) and were very garlicky and flavorful, yet amazingly I couldn't actually SEE the garlic bits, which means the garlic was infused into the fries.  Seriously, they were delicious, perfectly crisp and did not get soggy throughout the night amazingly.\n\nSo as we finished devouring our large portion of sides, our waiter brought our now-thoroughly-cooked Mahi Mahi with a plate full of veggies and fries!! dejavu.  The Mahi Mahi still had the great grill marks, fresh taste and the slightly smoky flavor.  The grilled lemon that accompanied the dish helped keep the fish warm when squirting on the lemon and gave it an extra smokiness as well.  Mm.... it was like eating really good grilled chicken in a way.  It surprised us how good this food was considering how simple and plain to see the ingredients were.\n\nBy that time we were stuffed, so we took half the fish and the rest of the dish to go.  We microwaved it the next day and everything still smelled fresh and tasted great, even for my mom who wasn't even there to taste the original.  I would definitely go back just to eat the fries and try all the chowders!\n\n- Food was of very high quality, seasoned just right and seafood was incredibly fresh\n- Crab and corn chowder is definitely worth a try as it's very unique\n- Server was attentive\n- Garlic-Parmesan Fries were also very good", "author": "Windy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-17", "description": "Why isn't there a grade BELOW 1 star???? We live in San Jose, but we decided to spend 4 days in San Francisco to play tourist, get away from San Jose, and eat as much fresh Dungeness crab as possible. Where we eat is defined by where we are allowed to eat with our little Yorkie. That means patio or sidewalk dining & it means being made to feel welcome. The Blue Mermaid Chowder House was on our list of places we had to go back to. We last ate there in August when we took my parents and a lot of other members of our family. The service in August was great, our Yorkie was welcomed by the Wait staff and they even gave her a bowl of water, the food was good, but the crab & corn chowder was awesome. So this past Monday, before leaving our hotel for the walk to the Blue Mermaid, we called ahead to see if we needed reservations or not for patio dining. (I am disabled so it was important to know that before we made the long walk.) We told the young lady that there was 5 of us plus our Yorkie so we needed the outside seating. She assured us that there was plenty of seating on the patio at that time so we gave our name and said we would be there in 20 minutes. When  we arrived, there was an older, red haired woman in a purple dress who told us that she could seat us, but our dog would not be allowed on the patio with us. My wife told her that we had just called and we were assured that dining with our dog would not be a problem. This lady very snootily stated that she didn't know who said that but they were wrong. I asked her why? She stated that it was against health code. I asked her when this occurred. She stated about one year ago. I told her we just ate there in August and we had no problem then. She stated that the City passed new health codes right after that. Well, she was changing her story so fast that I figured she was either a real crappy liar or simply someone with a real crappy attitude. So I asked why other restaurants in San Francisco allow dogs. She responded that the law only applied to the Fisherman's Wharf section of San Francisco. Huh? The City cracked down only on a part of the City that brings in huge revenues from tourists? I pointed out that I could clearly smell cigarette and cigar smoke, so why is that allowed? And pigeons are all over the patio and on empty tables, crapping everywhere, so how is that not a health code violation? She simply got snootier. I told my wife that we should go eat somewhere else and I turned to walk away. My wife though had her heart set on the crab & corn chowder so she said that if we get a table by the fence, she could keep our Yorkie right next to us, though technically it would not be within the patio. My wife got the lady to seat us, who then threw the menus down on the table, and walked away from us. That left my wife & I and our three daughters all sitting there in stunned silence! By this point, we were very insulted & upset and I made a comment that I thought the lady was lying, because this was San Francisco, the most liberal City in the world where even dope smokers smoke openly and animals have more rights than humans. Our waiter was serving the kids at the time and overheard me talking, so my wife asked the waiter if it is really against the law to disallow dogs on the patio in San Francisco? He laughed and said 'of course not'! That was the manager's rule. We ordered our lunch and periodically the lady manager would do something rude near us like once she loudly 'dropped' a chair right next to our table for no apparent reason and made no effort to apologize. We also watched as she argued with other customers and we watched several potential customers walk away after receiving a confrontation from the manager. I don't know what this lady's problem is, but if I was determined to destroy my business or my business's reputation, I would hire her. Since YELP is a public forum, I will describe this lady as nicely as I possibly can by saying she is 110% BIATCH! By the way, her name is Lorraine or Larraine, not sure which. Her last name might be Skank. There are many good places you can go in San Francisco to play tourist, get a decent meal, and spend a lot of money in the process. No one needs to go to this place just so you can be treated like crap while you dump a lot of money into her pockets. We will NEVER go back to this dump and we will inform everyone we can to avoid this dump too! Maybe the health department should check this place out. I think the manager is a walking health code violation! Avoid this dump!", "author": "Dwight M."}

The Mister and I finally sat and ordered, respectively, the New England Clam Chowder and the Dungenness Crab and Corn Chowder, both in bread bowls of course.  We also ordered a side of garlic parmesan fries.  The chowders came out, and yes they were quite delicious, but I don't know if they're the BEST ever. It was probably our mistake to get it in a bread bowl (how can you resist really), but we've quickly realized that you don't get much soup when you get it in the bread bowl.  The bread soaks it up and there's not much substance left except what's in the chowder.  So yes, the taste was great, the portions were okay (again probably our fault for the bread bowl situation) and the service was great too.  The fries were pretty good.

I haven't tried the other seafood items on the menu so I can't say for sure if they put as much love into them.  I know its in a touristy spot, but you should definitely give it a chance if you get caught playing tour guide to your outta town visitors.

The Chowder House bar offered a chowder sampler which was right up my alley.  $8.95 and I get to try 3 out of the 6 or 7 chowders offered.  Score!  Each chowder came in a little bowl which was a bit dissapointing, but I guess I couldn't complain because it's only a SAMPLE.  The award winning crab and corn was good and a bit spicy but not too hot.  The regular new england clam chowder was the second best chowder I've ever tasted.  A bit different, as the broth was a bit thinner than I'm used to, but definitely packed with a lot of flavor.  The 1st best chowder I'ver ever tasted was a bowl I had in Boston if you're curious.  The 3rd sample was a shrimp and red pepper chowder which wasn't that great, so I ended up picking the shrimp out of it and calling it a day.  The sampler tided me over for a while, but I definitely wasn't full.  It's more of a lunch time item.
