Stopped by this Starbucks location on Friday, July 28th around 6:45am. It was early and a weekday, so it wasn't too busy. We easily found a table for two after getting our coffee orders.\n\nI got a triple espresso and I believe my friend got a flat white? I have no idea what that is, but apparently it's espresso with steamed milk? Isn't that just a macchiato? I'm honestly not very versed in all the different Starbucks beverages, but our total ended up being $7.60 for both drinks. I'm not the biggest fan of Starbucks espresso in general as I find it weak, but this did the trick early in the morning.\n\nNice location as it seems comfy and there was plenty of seating when we got there. But I'm not the biggest fan of their coffee. It is convenient though as there are Starsbucks locations everywhere and I can easily use their app to do mobile ordering, etc. Overall, three stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Needing caffeine, I planned on going for a coffee run, and asked what they wanted me to pick up for them. So the conversation went like this: \n\nme: Hi, I need these... (looking at my phone for the list) \nCashier: Sure, what can I get ya?\nme: Grande ice white mocha\nC: Whipped cream?\nme: I don't know, do people usually get whipped cream?\nC: Not usually, but some people want it, so I always ask.\nme: Then, no. \n\nme: Also need a tall extra hot non-fat latte\nC: Any sprinkles?\nme: Huh? Do people usually get sprinkles?\nC: Some do, but you don't have to.\nme: Then, no. \n\nC: Anything else?\nme: Yes, a croissant.\nC: Would you like that toasted?\nme: Uh .. do people usually like it toasted\nC: Some, yes. It's flakier\nme: Then, yes.\n\nC: Anthing else?\nme: Yes, a cinnamon coffee cake\nC: Would you like that warmed up?\nme: What? Seriously!? ...um... do people usually want it warmed it up?\nC: Yes, if they're going to eat it soon.\nme: Then, yes. \n\nC: Anything else? \nme: Yes, venti drip, little room for cream. Can you tell which one is for me?\n\nWe both laughed at the series of questions. He was a great sport for having the patience.\n\nThe interior is large, spacious and have tall ceilings. There are large black & white prints on the wall, and almost every table was occupied at 9:30 am with people chatting with their friends, and others on their laptops. I like this location, and I would come back if I'm staying with my friends again. And of course, my venti drip managed to wake me up and got my day started ... so thanks for that! \n\n* Street parking may be a little tricky as there aren't too many spaces, and others park & wait for the next space.", "author": "James L."}

I've recently been using my mobile app for my orders, and have been sorely disappointed. I've had issues with the food portion of my order. Once I had to wait 15 mins because they were so behind. Thankfully, the barista Victor addressed this issue before any of us customers who were waiting for our food orders addressed it with the staff. Granted, it was busy, and during the rush, Victor was very proactive on trying to figure out why this was happening and busted his butt to make sure we were all taken care of. \nToday was a different story. I went later in the morning with the expectation of it all being better. Nope. My beverage was waiting for me. But again, not my food. I waited for about 5 mins, got not acknowledgement so I made the first move. I asked about my breakfast sandwich, to which I received and immediate reply from the barista who was making coffee right in front of me the entire time i was standing there...she said \"oh yeah, that girl grabbed your sandwich instead, but here is hers, its the same one, just take it\"...WTF? Really? Oh, and it was the last one. They offered to re-heat it. NOPE. They offered a refund. I was hungry so I said screw it, I ordered something else. Not happy with the mobile service there.

As I waited for my order, the barista (I forgot to get her name but she's a young lady with curly hair) called out my name with my order, which was given to me in a hot cup. Confused I asked her what it was and with a sarcastic voice, she said, \"decaf cafe americano.\" I said to her that I ordered iced. Her coworker even verified my order by saying, \" Did I not put \"iced\" on there?\" The barista grabbed the coffee then she rolled her eyes. She grabbed a cold cup to put water in it, pushing the water dispenser so hard that the water splashed from inside the cup. The coffee she grabbed from me, poured out the content then threw the cup in the trash in a tossing manner. As I waited for my new iced coffee when she finished, she tells me \"Here you go,\" as she tossed it on the counter in a sliding manner.

Obviously he didn't mean that they had water, although they DO have ice in them. He explained what he meant and asked her to make them again. Already having an attitude, the barista proceeds to make the Frappuccinos again - only this time one by one - taking her sweet time and whispering to one of the other baristas behind the counter. So the Frappuccinos were better the second time around, but had been sitting on the counter because the barista decided to make them one at a time. What's with the attitude?

They have a big long table for laptops, high stools/tables for 2s and I especially like the 4 comfy, big lounge chairs - makes you feel as if you're at home and want to ask,  \"Where's the fireplace?\".   \nUpon entering, you'll see the enticing merchandise for sale and to the right, a wall full of mugs, thermos, cups.  At this time, a few older merchandise are marked for sale, but only reduced by about $4.  There's the usual SF items - a lovely ceramic SF decorated tall mug with gold colored cap, about $23 but I would be afraid to use it outside the house because if you drop it, it will shatter.  There are the thin, transparent glass water thermos and plastic ones with SF decorations.\nThe counter has a lot of enticements for you to buy, food, snack bars, etc.  It just feels so much more spacious.  I was surprised at the number of folks in there at noon, on a weekday.  A couple of pairs of cops also stopped by for coffee at separate times.  The budget conscious cop or non-Starbucks coffee drinker would buy purchase their coffee from the place next door, so there are options other than SB coffee.  Molly Stone's market is just a couple of store fronts away.  \nToo bad SB is raising the price of their coffee, by as much as 30 cents.  A venti mocha and tall latte cost $8.  I could get nearly a whole pound of SB beans on sale for less than that at Safeway such that buying a cup of coffee at SB is more a treat than an everyday thing.", "author": "Ry T."}

I've gone in here multiple times when I hear about a starbucks special and they always have some excuse to not honor the promo or they change the promo slightly.\n\nToday I went in for the free tall starbucks blend coffee. As I stood in line, their sign even said \"free tall starbucks blend coffee--until noon\". So I'm like OK cool i guess they are having this promo. I'd come in a few months ago for a separate promo only to be told it wasn't on during that day. \n\nI get up to the register, making sure to get the order correct. They tell me I need to also buy a 'pastry' to get the deal. OK there is a big line and I dont want to make a scene so I get the pastry. No big deal. Then I went down the street to a starbucks inside a safeway to check what the deal was, and they're like yup you can get a drink. no need to buy a pastry. I already have my cup but wtf. \n\nI buy my share of starbucks coffee and gift cards but it just leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you go in thinking you will get a deal and they even advertise it.

The lack of parking will be evident, unless one is willing to wait or search for parking in the nearby side streets and walk a block or two.

He's so kind, funny, and super quick at taking orders and making drinks. \n\nThe morning crowd of post-drop-of-kids-at-school parents can be daunting (long lines), but this location is well-staffed and quick at getting everyone in and out. \n\nParking might be worth complaining about, but I've never had a major issue with it and I'm stopping by this Starbucks almost everyday. I rarely have to circle around to get a spot. It might be hard to get a front and center parking spot, but you can usually find one closer to Mollie Stone's or in the next lot over. It's about a 2-second walk anyway, so who really cares?\n\nOnly advice--- avoid this area during the school year between 11:30am-12:30pm. The high school kids have off-campus lunch and they crowd up the Starbucks (and every other store in this place). I sometimes end up coming during that time anyway, and it's not a big deal.

Starbucks now has a rewards program that is rather minimal, but still offers rewards, and you can only be a part of this if you have a registered Starbucks card. \n\nWhy would you do this? Well, the big benefits are this: 2 hours FREE Wifi every visit, free syrups and free drinks every once in awhile. \n\nThe best part about this is that you don't need to spend any more than you normally would. Even if you go to Starbucks infrequently, get a gift card the next time you go. Instead of paying for you drink, put $5 on the card and use it to pay. When you're done, you can register it online and then use free wifi (which you normally would be paying $9 an hour for). \n\nHope this helps!", "author": "Tom A."}

They are intelligent, switching gears fast according to what's needed at the time.  They all work in sync.

The place is BIG for a San Francisco Starbucks....big enough that I've never had a problem finding a seat here.  And from a customer-demographic standpoint, the crowd is typical of any Starbucks....no age group, ethnicity, or definition of hip seem to rule the roost.  Better yet, the customers at this location are largely sedate, solitary, and delightfully dull.  \n\nAnother reason to like this spot?  Fog.  Fog or light precipitation lends a bit of ambiance to the ideal coffee vibe.  And when fog rolls into San Francisco, the top of Portola is usually one of the first places to see it.  Other positive aspects include standard-issue wireless access along with laptop-friendly A/C outlets every 12 feet.\n\nBad points?  Myself and rocket-fuel went our separate ways many moons ago, and the decaf coffee at Starbucks seems to be abnormally high in residual caffeine.  The bathroom door is customer-accessible, but it's usually locked...and using it requires badgering the staff for a key.  It's out of the way location is a mixed blessing:  Though it hinders access, it also helps to keep the masses at bay.  Still, Forest Hill MUNI is only several blocks down Laguna Honda, and the 48 Quintara makes a stop 50 yards from the front door.\n\nIt's quiet.  It's solitary.  It doesn't host a horde of beautiful people or packs of social lions, but it doesn't attract screaming toddlers or exuberant teens either.  All in all, it's a pleasant trade off...one where human interaction is sacrificed for the sake of unhindered solitude.  Nothing about this location is either extraordinary or unpleasant, but it has it's place.  If you're looking to get away from society for several hours and you're willing to take a bus to do it, that familiar green sign at the top of Portola could be an option...", "author": "Mike W."}

The workers here are extremely friendly. They greeted me with a \"good morning\" and left me with a \"have a nice day!\" and not only that, but they were super energetic. The open lounge area is comfy and spacious. Although, at times it does get quite busy. Overall, this is one of the best Starbucks I've been to. I love it here!", "author": "Stephanie H."}

Starbucks accommodates all my moods and is a great place for me to collect my thoughts and enjoy great coffee. \n\nThis is my favorite starbucks in the entire city.

If anything I need coffee to stay awake from a long day at work and this is just the place to do it.  I can come in before work or during lunch; it doesn't matter since it hits the spot.  Some people don't like Starbucks because of it's enormous corporation, but hey this coffee works for me. \n\nI am not familiar with the names but I have almost always had good service and a small conversation with the staff every time I go.  I only order a couple different things off the menu so they usually know what to expect for me.  However, I did have this one bad experience at this Starbucks.  One day I came here I look around to see if any of the usual familiar baristas are there, but no one that I have recognized before.  As I order my coffee, I am charged $1.95 for a grande cup of coffee, which I expect.  The cashier is of course not paying attention and takes my money.  He gives me back $8.05...unbeknownst to him theres nothing wrong with that except for when I paid with a $20 dollar bill!  I am going to admit I do have quite a strong memory, so I strongly remember that it was a $20 since I had that bill in my wallet for quite some time.  I explain to the cashier that I gave him a $20 bill.  He responds, \"Let me check the receipt--it says you paid with a $10 bill.\"  I, however, do not back down from my statement that I gave him a twenty.  I told him to check the cameras and check his till.  He again replies, \"I don't have any twenties in my till.\"  I told him to look again, and therefore he explains only when another customer orders is when he can open the till.  \n\nAs I wait by the cashier to prove him wrong, the next person orders and the till opens.  There IS a $20 in the till and he absolutely does not want to believe me.  I cannot believe this guy tried to short change me, after the loyal customer I have been.  Eventually, he calls his manager over and he forks over the rest of my change.   This one time experience makes me think about how this happened in the first place.  That gentleman MUST have been new because I had never seen him there before then and I do visit frequently enough for the rest of the workers to remember me.  As for all the other workers, they deserve 5 stars, but this one cashier gets minus one.", "author": "B T."}

The waiter gave me a quizzical eyebrow look and questioned \"latte\"? I nodded \"oui\". Frenchie then returned with a cup of tea. TEA??! I SAID LATTE!\r\n\r\nWHAT'S COOL about Starbucks, they never make that mistake and if you're ever homesick while traveling abroad, just step into Starbucks and BAM! It's like you never left your American city home. I like the Portola store because of the easy parking, choice between table or couch seating, and the cozy fireplace.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S UNCOOL about SBs:\r\n-When someone gets their drink before me, even though I ordered first\r\n-When they short me a couple of ounces on a 16 oz cup\r\n-When they ask for my name to write on the cup. I silently giggle and say \"Al Coohalic\"\r\n-The calories that accompany an ExtraHotGrandeCaramelMarchiato\r\n\r\nDid you know the Starbucks logo is a sea siren, a two-tailed mermaid whose songs would lure sea men to their deaths. Seductive siren = seductive drink.  Earlier versions of the logo displayed the nekkid mermaid in its entirety, navel revealed and two tails spread Penthouse style.

I would seriously like to know whose idea this was.  What suit in a boardroom thought it would be a good idea to take a breakfast sandwich (that may have tasted pretty good in a test kitchen or at the point of preparation) and ship it to a zillion locations where they can nuke it for you to order?  The sandwich was VERY hot, with microwavey chewy-on-the-finish bread, tough eggs, and a little bit of redeeming cheese.  Yeah, yeah, but what really got me...  the bacon.  It's a very sad fate for bacon to end up on a Starbucks breakfast sandwich all pathetically limp and soggy.  It's hard for me to see bacon like this because, me and bacon, we're close.  And the final offense...a sticker on the breakfast sandwich bag that reads, \"Great coffee deserves great food.\"  Really Starbucks?  I just looked up great in the dictionary.  Hmm.  Well, shame on me for desiring something warm and delicious and believing I might get it at Starbucks.  I mean, my expectations were sufficiently low, but even so, I was totally disappointed.  \n\nOh, but no ill-feelings about the staff (friendly) or the ambience (Starbucks-y.)

Now if I'm paying almost $4 for a latte I expect it to properly made. They do a fine job with the espresso but they have absolutely no idea how to steam the milk. This has happened over and over and over again. I even tried to explain it to them but they got all pissed. The milk is supposed to be velvety and smooth. The foam is supposed to have small bubbles and the foam is supposed to last for the entire time it takes you to enjoy your drink. What you get instead is a thin watery drink. I even told them to make it just like Peet's does but they didn't get it ;-)", "author": "Pablo P."}
