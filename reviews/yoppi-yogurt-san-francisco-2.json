Its entrance is on Pine even though the formal address points to California Street. It is supposed to be open till 5 pm but a lot of time I've found it to be closed after 4 pm.  \n\n It has about 7 to 8 rotating flavors on tap at a time. The fro-yo here is a little too runny for my liking. As there aren't too many options around I have to make do. Current price is .69c an ounce which is high but fine for the area. A half full small bowl will run you just under $5. I think they have a 10% discount in the last 1 hr before they close, but that is if you manage to get them open at that time. The only other fro-yo place that I know of in downtown in Caffe Ambrosia which has even more limited flavors, is not self-serve and is more expensive and of-course has much better quality than Yoppi, but Yoppi will do the job that it is intended to do.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

There's the classic French Vanilla, Pink Grapefruit (which my friend raved it tastes like a nice rich champagne mmmm), Cappacino, my favorite Coconut, and many many more! They have new flavors tested out randomly which they have their customers rate on for feedback. Nice!\n\nTHE Sides: woah, I was in Topping Heaven. Other yogurt spots have fake frozen toppings, but that's not the case here. All the fruits are served completely fresh and bite-sized: bananas, mangoes, pineapples, strawberries, raspberries, basically anything ending in 'berries, and  even those little yummy Tapioca balls that you find in Pearl drinks. The other topppings were also massive, so much that I had to really try & narrow my options down: granola, almonds, chocolate almonds, dark and white chocolate chips, gummy bars, and whatever else you name they probably have it. Sigh, rememer: Topping Heaven!!?? I'm not lying.    \n\nBottom line: at .45cents an ounce and seeing the great selection available, I see Yoppi in my very very very near future... hmmm Monday again?

When I bought a new wallet, I realized that I am scared of being pickpocketed not because of identity theft or my money being stolen, but what the hypothetical thief would think of my collection of stamp cards at locations all around the Bay Area. At least when I'm downtown I can relax, knowing that Yoppi's frequent buyer program is tied to my phone number instead of a piece of paper, leaving one less froyo stamp card for my hypothetical pickpocket to snicker at. That alone wouldn't keep me coming back, but Yoppi offers fresh, convenient, and modestly priced froyo solution if you work in the area. \n\nI am boring and usually stick to their non rotating flavors of Vanilla or Original Tart, but I've tried their Taro, Peanut Butter, Caramel, and Pumpkin Pie flavors, and they're all delicious! They offer a nice variety of toppings whether you want to go for candy and chocolate  or the nominally healthier tons of fresh fruit route.

They leave an \"option\" to taste every flavor, enough that if you're satisfied you won't need to fill your cup too much.  Well I just like tasting froyo.  The day I went they had banana (not impressed), cheesecake (great) and yellow cake batter (my friend loved it).  They also had other flavors like original tart, vanilla, chocolate, pomegranate and blueberry.  I will probably have to check out the other flavors another day since they change often.\n\nThere are a TON of toppings.  After getting chocolate, cheesecake, vanilla and tart all mixed together in my cup, I opted to be healthy and only covered it in cherries and strawberries for toppings.  They didn't have lychee which is my favorite, so I was a bit disappointed.  I look proud of my $3.50 cup.  Then I look at my friend's cup - yellow cake batter and chocolate completely drenched in sprinkles, colorful candy and sugar of every kind.  I swear hers was a scene from Willy Wonka.  She had a major sugar crash after that.\n\nOverall, it's okay but I've had better.  The froyo was a little watery for my taste.  In fact, it almost melted by the time I crossed the street and headed back to work.  I normally prefer Yocup.  The yogurt there is more dense and lasts longer.

I don't know what it is about this flavor maybe it's the childhood flashbacks I get remembering when as I child I would try desperately to eat as much of the cake batter mix as I could before my mom was able to get the cake in the oven. With this cake batter frozen yogurt flavor it's like the taboo of eating raw cake batter has been released because suddenly it's actually OK for you to eat and maybe even healthy for you! Oh and the best part is that I think it's one of the low- fat or non- fat flavors but if it's not I don't want to know and who cares anyway! I can't get enough of this stuff!  \n\nThank goodness Yoppi has one of those preferred customer programs where you rack up the points with each purchase.  Except Yoppi does the preferred customer program right where they just store your phone number to keep track of your purchases.  This is great because who can ever save or find those little stamper cards.  At other frozen yogurt places I find myself frantically looking for my stamper card while my frozen yogurt melts on the scale.  Plus this is more green!  To top off the amazing experience you will have at Yoppi you get to pick the color of your spoon maybe you would like to coordinate with your outfit gotta love that!", "author": "Marlene S."}

About 8 flavors, compared to the Sansome location's 4. And they have this cute board where you get to vote for next week's flavors.\n\nOf course, like its Sansome counterpart, the yogurt is delicious, especially the plain tart. \n\nWhere this location loses to Sansome is in its topping--- just granola, that is-- but I am a huge fan of granola. The Sansome location has 3 or 4 choices of granola, including plain and other yummy ones like apple granola. This Yoppi only had granola.. am i a picky granola eater? maybe.\n\nOverall, I love it, as you can tell from the 5 stars I gave it.

I'm pretty sure it's better alternative than a McDonald's sundae, as long as you don't go too hogwild on the toppings which is hard to do, they have so many options! Cereal, sprinkles, graham cracker crumbs, these little fruit flavored explosions. This place makes me appreciate my work surroundings that much more.", "author": "Tatiana D."}

I also love the fact that you can control your portion size.  The only complaint I have is the fact that they only have one register.  The line got long, quick.", "author": "She-Ra .."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-23", "description": "Love the yogurt at this place.  The best-looking self-serve froyo place I've seen.  Love the sample cups and the tart flavors.  I suspect that the voting board has very little to do with which flavors they pick each week, but thats good because every time I'm in there green apple tart has no votes and they had it this week! (yay!)  I wish they had sig tart plus 2 other tart flavors at all times.  I also think its annoying that you have to remove the cup from the scale in order to find out how much it costs AND using the phone numbers to keep track of purchases is a bad idea.  Thats a pretty long string of numbers to type in and folks don't exactly love giving out their phone numbers.  But none of that will stop me from coming here.  How bout opening some stores NOT in the financial district, though, that are open on weekends too.", "author": "Maureen K."}

I would give them a higher rating but I think something's wrong with their scales.  I pretty much get the same amount each time but it jumps from $2 to over $4 every other time.  They have this annoying thing where they keep reminding you to take the yogurt off the scale - please put up a sign or something - I think it would save the staff from having to repeat the same thing to every customer.", "author": "Nin J."}

It's much more sour that how I usually like my yogurt. I was a bit confused at first by how the pricing works - basically they weigh the bowl (at 45 cents per ounce). My bowl today sets me back $3.50, not too shabby being a little picker-upper for Monday.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I'd like to think I'm an afficionado rather than an addict, and Yoppi is definitely at the top of my list.  They have 8 different flavors(5 of which rotate out on a weekly basis) and a wide variety of toppings, so there's something for everyone.  Yoppi is best known for their yellow cake batter fro yo, so if it's your first time here, you MUST try it!", "author": "Vanessa K."}

I like that they charge by-the-weight, so if you need just a little something sweet in the afternoon, you dont have to pay a lot.", "author": "brewgirl b."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-12", "description": "I'm only going to rate one flavor because that was the best flavor that I chose for today, which is their classic chocolate.  I am a fiend on sourness so most of the condiments were out of the question because I wanted something really sour.   I just grabbed some strawberry and kiwi.  Personally, I think this flavor can stand out on its own without the condiments . It's 45 cent per ounce.  I am curious about the ingredients in the yogurt.", "author": "pengrin .."}

Loved the topping of the mango-flavored caviar thingies.  So good with the mango and regular tart yogurt.  Definitely worth checking out!", "author": "Lisa M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-20", "description": "This review makes me sad but it must be done. I was a regular at Yogi, often going 2-3x/week.  Unfortunately the increasing rudeness of the main store staffer has curtailed my visits.  Perhaps the manager, you'll recognize her immediately she the one who looks full time miserable and always there.   She hates Yoppi, her life, and most of all you.  Consistently nasty and rude she behavior hit a new low last week when at 5:55pm she came up behind me and mumbled \"We're closing, get out \". I thought I must have misheard her, but then she repeated the same message hateful tone and all to the other group of customers.  How can someone surrounded by yummy candy treats be so unhappy?", "author": "lisa g."}

Every flavor I sampled was great, and really tasted like what it was - such as the Red Velvet Cake and the Yellow Cake Mix.  This was my first visit to Yoppi, and I will definitely be going back.  The price is good and the yogurt is only 100 calories per 4 oz serving.  And they change the flavors up every week!", "author": "Lisa T."}

They have great flavors that you can vote on weekly and I always find something new and delicious. Oh and they also have a great assortment of toppings! Today I had white chocolate raspberry and chocolate fro-yo with nuts and chocolate chips. Definitely a great escape from my computer!", "author": "Cherie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-15", "description": "I love Yoppi!  I go there nearly every single day, since they are in my building.  It is my guilt-free pleasure.  The cake batter flavor is wonderful, especially if you add a dolop of French vanilla, chocolate and sprinkle it with cake sprinkles.  Unlike what someone else said, I like the little orange ball toppings.  They are called \"fruit caviar\" and give a little burst of fruit flavor when you chew them.  I wish they didn't have Red Velvet at the same time as they have chocolate because the flavors are identical and they'd have room for another flavor if they omitted it, but that's a small thing compared to the yumminess of the experience.", "author": "Jo Anne C."}

I also loved the yellow cake batter, that's right -- yellow cake batter frozen yogurt!!  It hit the spot for my sweet tooth and I'll definitely go back.  I wish they'd drop the 45 cent an ounce price and help out my recession wallet.", "author": "Cabo G."}
